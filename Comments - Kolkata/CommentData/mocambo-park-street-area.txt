Mocambo is one of most elite restaurants in Park Street. The Pork Sirloin steak is my personal favourite. Another must try here is the Stuffed Tandoori Chicken. The layer of chicken mutton liver on the tandoori chicken makes the entire dish even more appetising.

Mocambo - one of the two restaurants whose name I was familiar with even as a kid of five years. Two decades later I had the opportunity and company to finally visit this restaurant. After an hour of standing in the queue, we managed to get a seat. Service was prompt, however, I didn't like the turban wearing waiters sporting the vestiges of the British era. They still think India is under the British rule, and those ignorant of her language is quite unworthy to even breathe the air of that establishment. Thankfully the suited waiters were quite amiable and didn't destroy our mood.
Chicken ala Kiev and chicken paprika was what we ordered. Chicken ala Kiev was a beauty, loved every bit of it. Chicken paprika was unique too. However, with both dishes I couldn't find any zing, except the pasta of chicken paprika which was the only thing spicy. Both of the dishes had a lot of items in it , thus creating flavours targeted towards all the corners of the taste buds, each sadly neutralising the other ...which can be summed up as 'good food with no zing'.

The ambiance is just like any other fine dining . 
What makes this restaurant special is the food.  
The quality is top notch and the quantity suffices a person. 
Looking forward to visit this place again. 
The pork sirloin steak is worth a try.

Mocambo, one of the authentic must to visit places of Park Street, has really disappointed us with it's service. Though I won't go for comparing the food with the other restaurant, because each one evolves with their own speciality. But the service was horrible. The table cloth was not properly done. Every item arrived after 30mins we've placed the order. They served the butter naan n after 15mins they served the paneer butter masala when the butter naan had already turned leathery! The waiters were in such a hurry that they dropped the curry filled spoon on my suit n spoilt it. Even after this, they never said "SORRY"..!! 
Undoubtedly it's a well known place, but does that mean to render service in such hafhazar way!

Always a reliable option if you are in Park Street. Dim lights, cosy conversations and prompt service. And of course delicious food. We had the deviled crabs-the only crab dish I eat, tuna with toast and beef steak. Lot of other dishes to try here and quite a few of them seem to be unique to Kolkata.

The perfect place for a good dinner. The food and ambience is fantastic. Our order did take some time to reach the table but the wait was worth it. The staff is courteous and well mannered. All in all a good place to spend a Friday night. The prices are quite reasonable too when compared to the size of the servings.

We went to Mocambo on 1st January. The service was very slow and disappointing. The didn't give us the menu card at first, we had to ask for the bill for three to four times.
Coming to the food, we had orange juice, fish ala diana, chicken roast, mutton mocambo, chicken Peshawari kebab and baked alaska.
Fish aladiana was superb with stuffed mushroom and prawn within the fillet.
The chicken roast wasn't upto the mark.
Peshawari kebab didnt kebab taste good at all, and disheartening.
Mutton mocambo was really good.
Baked alaska was definitely the cherry in the top!

I am not so satisfied with their food quality. I ordered strawberry blossom, meat lasagne And chicken ala kiev. Firstly They serve the order after an hour late. They first serve us strawberry blossom it's not a good actually it's taste quite like milk shake. Although lasagne is a far better taste than the chicken ala kiev. Over all I am very disappointed of their food quality so I give them 1.5 star

We went there on Navami night. And to enter the resturant we had to wait for more than 2 hrs. 
Each and everyone was frustrated.. 
But wait! 
What can take over all our frustrations!? 
Good food and Professional service! #being_foodie
And tbh we were surprised and I would say more than happy to receive such an amazing service and uncomparable food quality during that busy hours. 
The pictures below could easily explain you much more. 
Won't say much... In brief I would say if you are searching for a budget resturant with multicusine facility.. Don't wait,... Just enter Mocambo. 
The Continental food was really awesome.. 
Well it was an awesome experience for us.. 
Thanks for saving us from that hungry condition! 😂

Best for continentals. But if your r looking for starters then it will be a bit depressing. Only kababs and chili chikens are      f4r                r     c r  c t 4tf  or option. Chicken chipolata is an        (3./5). For soup we ordered mulligatawny(house special) it was delicious (4.5/5). Here soups are gravy type soup. Pork sizzler was also so so(3/5). And baked alaska(4/5) was baked ice creme under baked pudding. It was also good. Roast chicken, tasted here long ago, was great. Service was bit slow.

So I had been here for the 31st for lunch with friends. The ambiance is certainly amazing! We had the Italian style prawns and shredded chicken strips for starters. Loved the taste but the quantity was really less. :(
Moving on to main course, we had the grilled chicken sizzlers and the fish steak sizzlers. Not a very big fan of sizzlers though, these were surely great and quite filling. They were served with boiled veggies and half boiled egg.
Overall quite a good experience. 💓😍

Mocambo is one of the restaurants that people would generally recommend to others when they ask for good restaurants in Kolkata. And it is a true gem when it comes to ambiance but sadly, that is the only good part. Ever since my friend told me about it, i have been meaning to go there with my parents. And today when i finally did, i was a great disappointment.

 For Appetizers we order Chicken Meuniere and it was a good start off..but the main course was an actual let down. I order Spaghetti Carbonara and it lacked the beautiful blend of cheese and meat..it only tasted like cheese noodles to me. My Father order Cream of Spring Chicken, which is a soup, but he was disappointed because it turned out to be grainy and not creamy at all. My Mother order Chicken Biriyani and it was a complete shock, it tasted exactly like a kind of fried rice where you would add packet biriyani masala( the one you get to buy in the stores). It tasted like a combination of the biriyani packet masala and cinnamon powder..what more is that the rice used wasn't even basmati. 

I absolutely do not recommend this restaurant to any one at the moment, unless they change this for good. I hope they do improve because it once might have been a great restaurant but now its only running for its name.

Apart from the ambiance, there is nothing really pretty about this place. 
This was 31st of December 2017 and as we expected, park street experienced a steep increase in footfall.
We, (3 people) managed to enter the restaurant around 12.15 pm and were planning on lunch. 
After ordering one sizzler dish and two baked rice dishes (one of which was chef special), we waited. 

We also ordered lime sodas for the wait. Extremely sour and sugary to say the least.
we had to flag down a bunch of waiters couple of times before we could get our order. 
The food items arrived one by one and i noticed there was no steak knife for the sizzler, so had to flag down a waiter again. 
Even though the food looked tasty, it failed to achieve the status through its taste.
It is not like the food was BAD, it was just that there are other places in park street that serve WAY BETTER sizzlers than what we had and paid twice as much for. 

We were done with the food but the experience was not fulfilling. So we decided on three milkshakes. All of different flavours. The pistachio was the best and chocolate followed it closely. The coffee milkshake was only good because it was strong. Some people might not like how bitter it was ( I like my coffee strong and bitter).
 We asked for the bill which came out to be 2000 inc taxes. 

For the food we had, it was not at all worth. But since it was a festive day, we decided to let that go and focus on the positives.

Overall, the decor, polite staff and lovely lighting was not so bad.But there are a lot of flaws in Mocambo's attitude and quality.

One among the culinary legends of the city, Mocambo has always been shining with its name not only within town but outside as well when it comes to heritage eat outs serving continental cuisine.

Went there for 31st lunch. Lovely decoration for the christmas eve. I would suggest reservation on festive days, as personally I genuinely hate to wait when it comes to food. Service is a bit slow but considering the rush that day it can be overlooked. The staff seemed considerably amicable and attentive.

We ordered,
Crab Meat Cockatil - please don't order this dish. It was a complete disaster, mayo was awful and the crab meat was raw and stank badly.
Fish A-La Diana - This dish was the superstar of the day. Th prawn and cheese together melting in my mouth....just yum!!
Chicken Parmigiana - this was also quite a delicious and enjoyable dish!
Chicken Chipolata - This can be a big hit among meat lovers. Although I find the sauce a bit tangy and sweet, not bad but different.
Baked Alsaka - all's well that ends well...so goes the proverb. Absolutely so it was and it coverd up for all the minor drawbacks.

Considering the speciality of the dishes and the quality of food that that they serve price is reasonable enough. Quantity of the food usually serves on adult.
Overall a nice experience.
Definitely going back because most of theire heritage specialities remaind untasted.

The legendary Mocambo restaurant needs no particular description about the quality of food! Quality,taste is superb! Pretty expensive, quantity is little less if you consider the prices of each dish.

Both the cocktails-screwdriver and gimlet gin were good !

Tried their devilled crab as per zomato's suggestion.. and it surely was heavenly.

Fish a la diana was creamy but had a distinct fish smell.

Chicken a la kiev was oozing with butter...one poke with a knife and the whole plate gets filled with butter.

The showstopper of our dinner was the sizzler, chicken chipolata . It was served piping hot and tasted super amazing. Completely fell in love with it .

The only complaint I have is regarding their staff's behaviour. The person was pestering us to give him a tip. Although, I believe , giving tips is completely the customer's discretion. The whole experience of a beautiful evening at Mocambo was marred by this 'tip' story at the end.

Yesterday was the third time I went to this restaurant. The food is definitely delicious however management and service are extremely poor.

Today when I had been there the restaurant was full and we were into the waiting queue which was quite likely on a Saturday afternoon. We were given wait time of 15 mins approximately, however even after 40 mins our turn didn't come however I could see people came after us were getting table before us. On questioning I got a reply stating this is because difference in group size(we were 3 heads). Fair enough, but I got irritated when I have seen a group of 4 got the table ahead of us. I had asked why didn't you allowed me instead? The reply was the same. I had asked do you have 3 seater table and waiting for that to get empty (which is very unlikely in my experience. Generally 4 seater table accommodates 3 heads? They said we do have 3 seater table. Surprisingly after 55mins when I got a table, I have seen that's a 6 seater one.

The waiters are not either cordial at all. They do not even smile while asking for order.

After all these, the food was very good. We took firdousi kebab, mixed grill sizzler and chicken steak sizzler. I took a Chicken oriental a la Mocambo.all were quite good on dessert fruit salad with ice cream
irh. Ambiance is also good.

P.S:  A little advice to the management to add descriptions of the mocktails and coctails you are offering in the menucard.

One of the Heritage Restaurants in the City of Joy, Mocambo lives upto its name when it’s about serving good food. Been there on the 29th (Friday), we didn’t have to wait more than 10 mins which was a plus point when compared to other restaurants. The look & feel and the ambience was nice. The staffs were prompt in handing over the food menu. The food was delicious as always however the quality has slightly taken a hit during the festive season. The chicken steak that was served on a sizzler plate was lukewarm and the texture of the chicken steak also not upto the mark. The service was a little upsetting as i had to wait for 10 mins to get a simple thing like Capsico Sauce. The chicken meunière was delicious and served hot. The all time chef’s favourite (Chicken Orientale Ala Mocambo) brought a delight to the taste buds. There was sloppiness in service post ordering the food.

Mocambo is one of the oldest and very famous Restaurants in Kolkata...Mocambo serves a good quality of continental food... Been here on my girl friend's birthday...And I definitely had my lunch sorted...The restaurant is located in Park Street which is quite easy to locate...
The ambience is so awesome...There are couches for sitting..shaded light and all those things make the place so classy..
Now coming to the food..


1. FISH A LA DIANA :
This is the backed item...Bhetki stuffed with prawn and cheesy smashed potato...This is cooked in cream sauce..A small chopped carrots,beans are in this creamy sauces..I found heaven in the every bite of the dish..i highly recommended this dish...itz really bliss...
RATING: 5/5


2. CHICKEN STEAK SIZZLER :
I listened they served best chicken steak sizzler...And after tasting it i must say the same..There is thick chicken patty tossed with sauces...On the top of the dish there is a poached egg...some veggies like carrots,peas are there...I gave 4.5/5 for this dish..
Staffs are well behaved...I would like to visit this place again..
Rating:4/5


Service:  we entered into the restaurant...after 10 minutes gave us water ,menu chart...  dishes was served  late but ok... after completing the dishes... we asked for the bill... ..also  they took another  20minutes to  give bill & changes..
thatswhy  so many people were waiting outside...

Located in Park Street near. This is one of the finest restaurants in Park Street. They have a wide variety of items on the menu, from Continental to Mughlai they have got it all. However their Continental dishes are the best.
I recently visited mocambo with my family. The ambience is good. The staff are polite. Service is quick. And the food is delicious. I ordered the Irish Chateaubriand Beef Steak, Chateaubriand Beef Steak with Mushroom Sauce, Cream Caramel & Vanilla Ice Cream with hot chocolate sauce. However the portions was small😞. But overall the restaurant is good.

It was my second visit in here on 25th dec.As we all know its a famous resturant in parkstreet,it was damn crowded pn that day.We had to wait for about 1hr to get the table.the decor was nicely done with ballons and other Christmas stuffs. The staffs were decent and polite though but they were in rush all the tym due to the crowd.
We ordered-
1.fish muniya-well,its our starter of the day,recommended by the staff there.I wonder why its not  in their must try/recommend section in  zomato,coz its the best dish I had that day.
Fish fillets cooked in cheese and cream batter served with few feingled potato crisps.6pcs  per serving.It was soo juicy and tasty.I recommend it highly,mainly fr the cheese lovers its must try.I rate it as 5/5 .
2.Chicken ala kiev-well,it was in recommendations.ppl said that they love it.well,fr me it was a disaster,I dint like it at all.chicken fillet served with butter rice,garnished with shredded butter.The whole thing was smelling like eggs.too bad an experience.rating 1/5

3.chicken orientale ala mocambo-its a chef's special dish,served nicely with boiled veggies,potato cubes,salad,peas,though the egg topping was missing.The chicken fillet was shaped as a cloesd cone,crispy outside and juicy inside,filled with white wine and cheese sauce.I loved it very much.try it guys.
We also ordered bread rolls wth butter.
Whereas we didn't ordered ny dessert,as they have very common options.so,we went to naturals fr that.

All I ordered were three dishes. One and a half hours and still no food. The food came when my hunger was dead. Rissoto was moderate, chicken Tetrazzini was good and angels on horseback was abysmal. Even good service and ambience cannot compensate for the long wait.

I visited this place on Christmas Eve! As expected Park Street was crowded not just crowded but it was herd of people pushing each other. THe place obviously full
We had to wait for a while. The ambience is warm. With hues of white and reds. The staff though is in attentive, we had to wait for a long time for menu, then to place the order. The food came in 45mins. Which was a big let down. 
The place was not well kept and dirty. 
The saving grace was probably the food. 
We ordered the chilli cheese poppers and spaghetti which were the only few veg options 
Again a big let down 
The poppers were yummy n warm. The spaghetti was baked with no vegs at all. Was simply noodles in tamato sauce. A bad expiernce. Would definitely not recommend this place

Located in Park Street near. This is one of the finest restaurants in Park Street. They have a wide variety of items on the menu, from Continental to Mughlai they have got it all. However their Continental dishes are the best.
I recently visited mocambo with my family. The ambience is good. The staff are polite. Service is quick. And the food is delicious. I ordered the Irish Chateaubriand Beef Steak, Chateaubriand Beef Steak with Mushroom Sauce, Cream Caramel & Vanilla Ice Cream with hot chocolate sauce. However the portions was small😞. But overall the restaurant is good.

Just like the legendary restaurant Peter Cat, I noticed almost 10-15 people were waiting outside when we decided to have lunch at Mocambo. Yes, it was my first time at one of the most well known restaurant of the city.

After entering into this place, it seemed an extended version of Peter Cat, mainly because of the focused lights hanging on the table. Other than that the ambience felt very nice but tables were completely filled up at that time. With their staffs guidance we managed our sit.

Heritage dishes of Legendary Mocambo :
------------------------------------------------------------------
I was fully determined to order their heritage dishes only, those items were in red boxes on their menu card. After all it was my first time here, So I wanted to try their best…

Devilled Crab (2/5) :
---------------------------------
2 pieces of crab with a layer of cheese on top was served beautifully on banana leaf. This looked damm exciting until I took a spoon of it. The crab was filled mostly with cheese and mashed potatoes with very less amount of crab meat that was easily visible. It tasted below average to me & seemed overhyped. Time it took to be served, this item was in their special menu, I also noticed few others having the same, all this made my expectations so high but that fall into the ground and broke like an egg. 

Chicken Supreme (4.5/5) :
----------------------------------------
Now it was something special and Mocambo made my mood with it. Chicken topped with ham and fully coated with cheese, all baked together this dish tasted just brilliant. Even boiled peas and carrot tasted heavenly good with the flavour of butter in it. Chicken and Ham was beautifully cooked, those tasted just wonderful with balanced accurate spices and cheesiness. Just a bit less use of mashed potato would’ve made it perfect. Waiting so long for this dish somehow justified its taste.

Service :
--------------
Their service is extremely extremely slow. We entered into the restaurant at 2:30 after waiting for almost 20 minutes outside. After only 2 appetisers it became 4pm, so we directly asked for the bill, otherwise we needed to wait for another 1 or 2 hour to complete main course & desserts. Even after several follow ups they took this much time to serve only 2 dishes, also they took another 20-25min to give bill & changes. 

All total just for having 2 dishes over here we needed to spent almost 2 and half hours. Now I understood why so many people were waiting outside, because they simply can't serve the crowd. If you're planning to visit this place then its better to take the full day out for completing meal over here.

Pricing :
--------------
As per their category pricing was on average side and justified overall experience except their poor service.

Final Words :
-----------------------
If you believe in “Patience is virtue” then you can stand in the queue for Mocambo. But this doesn’t apply to every dish they offer. Overall a must try for everyone.

One of the oldest restaurants in Park Street, this place is a must visit for all the continental food lovers. The classy ambience will gain your confidence the moment you occupy a table. The staffs are courteous and helpful. They will ask you to try their best dishes when you ask for some suggestions.

We ordered Fish Florentine as a starter as it was in the list of their famous dishes on Zomato. Trust me, it was one of the best starters we've ever had. The fish was so soft and yummy. We had some beer too.

Then we asked for Mixed Grilled A La Mocambo and Chicken Garlic Steak. We also ordered some bread along with these two dishes. Both these dishes tasted really well but the Chicken steak was a bit too much salty. If you like and eat different types of meat, do try out Mixed Grilled A La Mocambo. It had bacon, chicken sausages, mutton liver along with veggies, pasta, mushroom, etc. In the end, we ordered for Fresh Lime Soda.

The experience was a nice one. I would like to visit this place once again. Their clean washroom gives you a hint that how much priority they provide to hygiene.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: 1300 for two (approx.)

The ambience has a touch of old Calcutta, the intricate carpets the drooping lights and the mildly comfortable seating arrangements makes you feel the vintage in the place.

The food is not hugely superior than any other continental place, considering the price you pay, not sure about the north Indian cuisine.

If you are looking forward to an almost fine dining, with a bit of snobbishness playing in the air amongst a vintage setting, this is the place for you.

They were all great. 
Warm ambience and a great place for every occasion.

Mocambo needs no introduction. After moving to Kolkata from Mumbai this place was one of the top ones on my list. Did not disappoint of course. It's been an experience I'd like to experience once again, hopefully soon.
We went here for lunch, me and my folks and began with the lovely Cream of crab soup. It was delicately spiced and wonderful. This was followed by a Beckti Steak, Chicken a la Kiev and a portion of Paratha and Kima Curry... My Mom didn't like the Beckti much, but the Chicken and the Paratha and Kima were excellent. We ended the meal by sharing a Brownie with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce.
I'm looking forward to a visit again as this was not enough for me to experience all the lovely dishes Mocambo has to offer.

In other words, I love the decor, the lamps and little sitting arrangements make it really ethereal.

Went there on a December evening with a group of friends. After scanning through the menu for quite some time we finally decided to order Screwdrivers, Chilli Baby Corn,Chicken Cordon Bleu, Chicken Supreme, Meat Lasagna, Macaroni Cheese Casserole, Mushroom Soup and Chicken Kebab. The Chicken items were made to perfection with handsome amount of cheese, it will be a delight for cheese lovers. The Chilli Baby Corn was not upto the mark according to me. They took almost 30 mins to prepare our food, may be because of the number of items we ordered. Although the baby corn and screwdrivers came early as requested. The food lives up to the brand name & will leave a mark on your tongue.

They have a large variety of sizzlers worth of trying. The environment is also very good. The waiters are not good enough though. They will specifically ask for a good amount of tips and stand beside your table as long as you do not give it to them. This type of behavior is not expected from waiters of such a renowned restaurant.

Been here on Christmas. And I definitely had my lunch sorted. The restaurant is located in Park Street which is quite easy to locate as well. The ambience is quite similar to that of Peter Cat (since they both are run by same group) so I have no complains about the decor or feel of the place. So that has a 5/5.
Now coming to food , we had ordered Fish Steak and Chicken Steak Sizzlers , Prawn fried rice , veg pillau and chilly chicken.
The sizzlers were too good. Both the chicken and fish were succulent enough and it tasted great. 
The only thing that caught my attention was , the quantity of the rice items were too less to feed two persons. So I give a 4/5 on that.
And about services , we had no complains either.
Overall I had a good experience and would like to visit again.

A very prestigious place. One must visit there at least once (or multiple times like me). Among the food items, chicken cordon bleu is sinfully good! With each bite you'll taste the ham and chicken with delicious molten cheese. Heavenly. Also the bacon wrapped chicken is truly Angels on Horseback! A must have. They also make a killer spaghetti carbonara.
The ambience is amazing. You've to be there to experience it. The staff is very polite.

Food is good here, but there r issues with people working here. We had ordered Baked Alaska for dessert. It was bitter in taste. I asked the manager why it is bitter in taste, to which he said that they put brandy in it for the burning effect. But there was leftover brandy all through the plate which made it taste bitter. He wasn't in a mood to accept the fault but kept on giving various arguments like excessive baking is not good, etc. When the bill was paid, the waiter was adamant on getting his tip. I mean it is fine if I tip the waiter but it is certainly not your rights to demand for tip. I was anyway going to pay but exercising rights here is not acceptable.

Mocambo admin - please pay proper wages to ur waiters so that they do not haggle.

Featured as one of the legendary restaurants in Kolkata, I had to drop by this place. We went tgere on a Saturday late afternoon and found the place decently filled. Famous for their steaks and sizzlers we tried their Mixed a la Mocambo. It had bacon, sausages, egg, chicken wings. We went for the sizzler version. The food was decent nothing extraordinary for the matter of sizzler. Maybe next time I would like to comeback to try more authentic steaks.
The service is slightly slow. The ambience is wonderful and its a good place to go with family and friends.

Behaviour of few odd staffs leave a bad impression about the whole place. Thats exactly what happened yesterday when i checked into Mocambo to enjoy a pre-christmas dinner with family in the beautifully lit park street. Thumbs up to the laid back, old world charm of the british by gone era inside, though it can be a little irritating if you are starving and have to bear with their painfully slow service. We ordered for peas pulao, mutton rogan josh, chicken kebab masala, chicken pavlograd for the mains and brownie with hot chocolate sauce and baked alaska for desserts. Everything was upto the mark except their famed Baked Alaska. I ordered it sply for my granny and it was such a let down. It was bitter ( three members of my family tasted it, including myself) and when pointed out to the manager he said that he cannot cancel the order. I tried to reason with him asking him why shall i pay for something which i could not even eat. He was totally unapolegetic and told me flat that he would ask the management if it can be cancelled. After about 20 minutes he came back and said the management has decided to cancel the order however they tasted the dessert in question and could not find anything wrong with it!! Such audacity!! I mean, is this the way Mocambo treats its customers?! There have already been instances where question has been raised on Mocambo's hospitality and this time we faced it and know it is true indeed! I mean give us a break, we pay you and its not the other round! Learn some manners...

Had been wanting to visit Mocambo for a long time but alas! It's Kolkata! I'm always confused about where I should go and eat since the options are way too many!! I was finally taken for lunch to Mocambo by my friend Joydeep! On Park Street on a winter afternoon! We sat there and he immediately ordered the devil's crabs! I was blown by the portions and the pricing of sea food there! It was so soft that it just melted in our mouth! The next was a sizzler for him and a chicken paprika for me! We were way too full to eat it immediately some got them packed but managed to gobble it in the evening! It was glorious! @

Though it's a bit on the expensive side but food is love and you can try it atleast once it's really great.

This vintage and classic restro needs no introduction. Quintessential continental junction. We tried chicken meuniere, golden fried prawn and Irani fish. Both the meuniere and Irani fish were amazing in taste but the prawn disappointed us. Would love to visit the place to try their signature dishes. The delivery can be a little faster.

Very sadly indeed, Mocambo got embroiled in an unfortunate controversy, a while back. But pleasantly indeed, the controversy has not been able to either reduce the foot falls at Mocambo, nor marr it's great tastes. The food remains iconic and as delicious as it always was. There are so many other restaurants serving a similar genre of food, Mocambo has held on its heritage.

I have heard stories that people wait for hours to get a table here on weekends and I had waited here as well, and left with disappointment. I finally had a lunch here on a Saturday this December and well, I wasn't disappointed. 
The place lives upto its name, bring the crowned jewel of Park Street. Let's not talk about drinks cause you get everything here. 
We ordered Devilled Crab meat, Chicken Paprika and veg item which I don't recall. The reason is I was absolutely stunned with the Devilled Crab meat and Chicken Paprika. 
Devilled Crab is served on the crab shell from where the crab meat comes from & the meat is minced and served with cheese and mustard sauce. One plate has 2 servings which is enough for 2 person. And i loved it! 
The Chicken Paprika chicken was served with chilli flakes, pepper along with rice, sauted veggies and pasta. It's one of their signature dishes as well.

I would definitely visit this place again as there are loads of delicacies to enjoy and I already feel guilty enough for not visiting this place despite staying in Kolkata for 4 long years.

Happy dining!

We have orderedChicken MilanaiseChicken Orientale A la MocamboFish WellingtonChicken ImperialFood was really Awesome. I did not like the ambience may be for the heavy rush.

Mocambo is of course an old Park Street classic. Despite the recent negative press, the food remains as good as ever. The devilled crab and the Fish Florentine are particularly to die for. In our last visit, we tried a starter called Cecil's Jazzed, which were meatballs with an onion-garlic stuffing. I can't say I cared much for the taste, but they were okay to munch while we waited for the rest of our group to turn up. In the main course we ordered the Chicken Orientale a La Mocambo. It had chicken fillets cooked in red sauce with a portion of rice and grated eggs. It tasted pretty good. The ham steak sizzler with mushroom sauce was also extremely delicious with its chunk of soft succulent ham cooked in mushroom sauce and the sides of vegetables. No visit to Mocambo is complete without their Baked Alaska. A lot has been said about this dessert already and there is little more I can add to it. But if you haven't tried it you have definitely missed something.
The prices are what you expect in that area but the service is a tad bit slow these days. The waiters also seemed less attentive. But you still want to go back for their food.

Finally at the heritage restaurant of Park street after postponing the visit for quite a while now. I have to say that this would surely go down in memory as the most memorable and delightful lunch I have ever had. The ambience is what stole our hearts at the first go with the orange tinted lamps exuting a traditional aura to the whole scene.
Now to the much talked about hits of Mocambo,
Angels on horseback -- If food could sing, this pretty dish would be the best orchestra I have ever heard with the flavours creating a symphony on my palate. The base of flavoured tangy rice topped with a generous helping of bacon wrapped chicken makes me salivate even as I write the review... The chicken was well cooked and the macaroni added to the sauce along with the sautéed chopped sausages lifted the texture of the dish to a whole different level. The slightly roasted potato and the carrots and peas supported the dish mindblowingly.
Chicken paprika-- Another stellar of a dish. Served with a helping of flavoured rice, the sauce oozed with a generous amount of paprika and creamy macaroni with finely sliced chicken in it. The sauce was a bit heavy but then who loves macaroni without a bust of cream and cheese to go with it!! The potatoes and the carrots were a perfect marriage again.
Now to the mammoth of the evening,
Baked Alaska-- The most surprising thing ever presented on a plate to me for sure. The dessert had the theatrical element of a whipped meringue set on flambe which exuted the smoky bitter flavour perfectly. The meringue was light and smooth just fine. But the surprise pops out as you cut into the cake. On a textural level, the cake grabs all the stars. Layered with slices of banana, walnuts and a horde of other fruits with raspberry sauce and strawberry foam to go with it, this was the dessert I would go back to again and again.
The staff was courteous enough but they took an enormous amount of time to just present the bill which led to us being late for our other engagements. Other than that, it was one hell of an experience at Mocambo and I would be elated to visit this restaurant time and again😊.

Mocambo: Pork Sirloin Steak = grilled minced pork
Yes, this did happen to me on Saturday. I ordered a Pork Sirloin Steak and what I got was a plate of grilled minced pork. When I confronted the steward, he said that was how it is (something to that effect) with a deadpan expression. I should have got an inkling right in the beginning when, while ordering the steak, I asked if the steak came in different shades of cooking like medium-rare or well done - to which he just shook his head. Unfortunately I am unable to find any place on the Mocambo FB page to vent my experience (they probably disabled the comments section after that unsavoury incident of not letting a driver into the restaurant around a year ago).
This was just shameful and I feel cheated without any avenue of redressal!

Okay, this restaurant was in the news few months back for all the wrong reasons but I tried to ignore that. But, upon reaching this restaurant, i felt being judged by the waiters there for the first 10 mins. It took me some time to figure out that you need to be in your air of pride to call a waiter near you, not to mention that your dress matters too in this regard! ;)
I was alone but was enthusiastic to order something that was signature to this restaurant. So i ordered a portion of Chicken Tetrazinni and a portion of chicken ala kiev. Chicken tetrazinni was good, properly layered with cheese, chicken and lasagne. But the chicken ala kiev dissapointed me a bit. A piece of chicken ala kiev is actually a hollowed breast pieace of chicken which is filled with butter and the outer side of the chicken breast piece is covered with flour, egg and breadcrumbs and then deep fried in oil. Upon having a first bite of the piece, i found the inside was partly filled with butter and had water mixed in it... I wonder if thats what they offer in the name of chicken ala kiev or is it just me.
Anyway, the chicken in it tasted good so picked up my pace of gobbling down whatever i was having on my plate. Service was quick and prompt. Staffs and the waiters would have been more useful had they been a bit friendlier. Overall, experience wasnt that bad as people say, and i sincerely hope that the authorities of this restaurant takes a note of what i had to say about Mocambo. Best of Luck!! :)

Angel on horse back coupled with prawn cocktails is my favorite combo there. Good ambience and decent crowd! Only reason why I dint rate this restaurant 5/5 is because it has a long waiting time on weekends! It speaks good about the restaurant for sure but at times when one is famished, it’s irritating.

There's no point in discussing the quality of the food. Let's admit it, they're probably the best value for money continental restaurant in Kolkata. My issue is with the waiting time, both inside and outside the restaurant. 

I think there's something really not right with the amount of time they take to deliver the food to your table. They make you wait, wait and wait, till you start losing your appetite and then the food is served. 

If things are managed properly, I think the turnaround time can really be improved a lot. This would make the queue outside much shorter (but do they really want that... I think by making people wait outside is how they boast about their restaurant, so not much change can be expected here).

Mocambo doesn't need any flattering introduction as the food they serve speaks for itself. Located in the heart of Park Street, it's almost reigning the taste buds and hearts of many with their veritable continental preparations. The red and white interiors exude simplicity and elegance. Staff is courteous but service a tad slow. Anyways, the food compensated the wait.
The order consisted of their classic dishes : Deviled Crab, Chicken Paprika and Chicken Tetrazzini. 
The Deviled Crab, interestingly served in a crab shell was oozing cheese and tasted heavenly. Chicken Paprika was a flavourful platter as well. Chicken Tetrazzini was gooey with shredded chicken and spaghetti in sherry sauce. The meal was so filling that     dessert had to be skipped. Nevermind, will indulge my sweet tooth in the next visit. Cheers !!

This Old Calcutta Legend is one of those places in Kolkata that you can't miss. 
They serve authentic continental dishes in all their simplified glory. 
The steaks are good, even better as sizzlers. For the love of steaks, totally try the surf and turf. Deviled Crab, Chicken Cordon Bleu, Fish a la Diana, Stuffed Tandoori Chicken are among their most celebrated dishes. Give some these a definite try if you're in this place! 
Service is slow and have issues. Like real, problematic issues which account for the low rating. But otherwise, food is remarkably good.

Regarded one of the legendary continental places on parkstreet. I was in the mood for some steak. Ordered a beaf Irish steak. They staff was helpful enough to help me choose the suitable variant. Coming to the steak, the meat was quite well made and soft which is the critical thing. The garlic butter sauce went very well with the steak. They were kind enough to give me some complimentary mashed potatoes to go with the steak. The ambiance was classic. Antique lights above your table preserving the old essence.

Absolutely rubbish service. I understand the rush during Saturday night, but if you can't serve so many people then you should really decrease your seating capacity. Moreover they were not at all interested in attending us. We were served food like after 1 hour, and that too cold. The steak was hard, making it difficult to chew. Got the perfect explanation why there rating is deteriorating day by day.

Visited this place last puja on ashtami.
The place is well known for the delicious food they serve. Nonetheless , the hope is justified.  
We had a plate of prawn cocktail for starters , chicken sizzlers and some fish dish (can't recall the exact name) from the main course and baked alaska for desert.
Prawn cocktail : the dish tasted good but the quantity was unbelievably small. Once I cooked cream corn out of my own recipe and it tasted exactly like the prawn cocktail  (the creme part). So , it wasn't something new for us.
Chicken sizzler - it tasted good . The chicken pieces were juicy and soft. Moderately recommend. 
Fish dish - it tasted awesome. It was unbelievably soft . And the taste of fresh bhetki lingered. Highly recommended. 
Baked alaska: NO words for it.  PHENOMENAL! Loved it ❤ a must try.
Service is average.
Decor is fair.

Mocambo is my favourite now. 
After rushing from here and there in park street we chose to go to mocambo. 
Though it was my first time here. We didnt ecpected the food to be this good. 
Chicken kebabs and soup in starter were good enough. 
Then came the speaciality of the place. Ala kiev. 
Ala kiev was more than satisfying. 5/5
Then came the beef steak. I love beef and it was decent though the mushroom sauce could have been better. 
We even orderred chicken biryani and my father loved it. 
Its good to have a lunch here and i will look here to go again.

Someone needs to tell them that adding bucket loads of white sauce and cheese to food doesn't make it better. I don't think I have had a single dish here that hasn't been doused in their signature cheese sauce. It's okay if you're reallyyy craving cheese....I guess. The ambience is no doubt very soothing and classy, although I always got this feeling that the staff sort of looks down at you. Have to try the non cheese based dishes the next time.

Mocambo is a place where every Bengali goes to fulfill his/her cravings for continental dishes. Feel like having a steak or a sizzler? This is one of the best place for it!
Ambiance is classy and the price for every dish is quite reasonable.

One of the finest restaurant in Kolkata undoubtedly. The ambience is classy with courteous staffs. The place will freshen up your mood with the sizzling whistles of the sizzlers. And they are good. The pork cutlet is heavenly bliss. Fish Ala Moutarde and Fish Ala Diane are equally delicious. Fish Ala Diane is a bit heavy with lot of mayonnaise but the prawns and beckty will surely make it up . Ala Moutarde is a bong delicacy with beckty baked with sunflower seeds. Chicken sizzler is satisfactory. Please try the Brownie with Vanilla ice cream , it will surely make your day.

I have always ordered Devilled crabs at Mocambo, this time I tried Almost Famous which is a new addition to their specials along with the crab. Mixed meat risotto and chicken tetrazzini made for a sumptuous main course. Great place for reunions and new beginnings, Mocambo remains one of the cosiest places to visit.

My entire childhood is filled with memories of food from here. The sizzlers, the ala kiev or the pavlograd, the fish á la diana, the iconic prawn cocktail- among literally anything else in the menu. The best part is, this place is the same, progressively better but never ever worse than I, or even my father in his childhood, remembers. You could order *any* dish from the menu and it would blow your mind.

My favorites here are Chicken Chipolata(sizzler) and Angles on the horse back.
I am a huge lover of bacon's and trust me in this when I say they serve the yummiest of bacon's in kolkata(Angels on the horse back is a seasoned bacon wrapped around chicken) .
Was skeptical about the cold chicken buffet with salad, but it was awesome.
Though they don't serve in huge quantities, the quality makes up for it.
Do give a visit. ❤

There are absolutely few places you can go to in Kolkata with the assumption of never being disappointed. Mocambo definitely tops that list. 
There have been ugly rumours surrounding the place in recent times and I can assure you they're far from reality. 
I had a slight finger burn before entering and asked the service manager for a bowl of ice. In a span of 1 hour, they changed the bowl 4 times without asking a second time. If this is poor service, I have no idea what good is. 
The food here has bad days occasionally, like the last time I visited back in 2016. 
But with yesterday's (07/11/2017) experience, Mocambo is back to the top of the favourites list. 
From the Beckty Fish Muniere to the Crab Cocktail, the dishes stay in your aftertaste for a really really long time. I'm someone who prefers Carbonara for some unknown reason and I can say this with absolute experience, the Carbonara here is one of the finest you'll ever taste. 
Top that with the ambience and the class, a good dinner or lunch (or anything in between) deserves a Mocambo experience if you've not had it in the past.

One swallow doesn't make a summer...but in the food business one bad meal can break the reputation of a restaurant! And that's what happened here at Mocambo in the autumn of 2005! One Chicken Kiev ruined it for me 😣
Now the time is ripe for a second chance (everyone deserves one after all) - and Mocambo has truly redeemed itself with their "private" menu of Mutton Peshawar kebab and Chicken Firdoshi kebab!

When it comes to restaurant this place is amongst the stalwarts of Kolkata. Located in Park Street, it is one of those few places which has still managed to keep the flavours of the dishes intact.

The ambience is great. A perfect place to spend time with family and friends. The staffs are courteous and helpful with the dishes. The red and white colour of the interior has an appealing effect to the eyes.

Cream of Spring Chicken. It is a thick soup with white gravy. It did not have too much masala. It was mild and easy to the taste buds. Just one complaint that the amount of chicken was extremely unsatisfactory. There should have been more chicken.

Mutton Peshawari Kabab. Soft succulent lamb kababs which were "melt in the mouth" delicious. The masalas had not overpowered the taste of mutton.

Beef Surf and Turf. A combination of fresh prawn and tender chateaubriand bead steak with mushroom sauce. One plate of this is sufficient to fill your appetite. It's accompanied with potatoes, pasta carrot.

Chicken tetrazzini. Strips of fillet of chicken cooked with pasta and green peppers and mushroom in a sherry sauce. It was baked with cheese.

Overall a very good experience. A must visit for foodies.

We went to this heritage restaurant in kolkata even after hearing about certain incidents which had occured, well to our delight the staff appeared quite courteous, the ambience was cosy, with that vintage look that mocambo is known for, the low hanging dinner lamp, the cosy sofas. Coming to the food, we had ordered the Al la keif Chicken, the pork cutlet and the pepper devilled crab. We were not disappointed...the food was fantastic reminding us that it was one of the oldest continental restaurants in kolkata. The devilled crab was succulent with minced crab meat and melted cheese covering served inside a crab shell. The pork cutlet was next, we were worried whether it could be as good as the crab, well it turned out to be great the cutlet contained ham, chesse and minced pork served with tossed vegetables peas, carrots and potatoes. Now came the chicken, being great fans of meat, we thought the chicken was going to be a let down, and thats when mocambo showed true class....the chicken turned out to be the showstopper as it was probably one of the most unique chicken dishes i have had. The cutlet shaped like a closed cone with a stem attached to its base looked unique and one bite into it..showed us how good it really was, it was filled with melted butter inside. The shell contained chicken and cheese with an external crispy coating. This was served with tossed veges. Must say what ever is written about this restaurant in the press. Its food is still legendary.

One of the best legendary restaurants in Kolkata.
Every element of the restaurant is perfect, be it food, ambiance, staff and anything you can think of. 

We ordered a lot of things as it was an office get together.
Ordered Chicken Tetrazzini, Chicken Mariana, Chicken Supreme, Angels on Horseback, Fish A La Diana, sizzlers, Risotto Arossto, multiple Hilsas, Devilled Crab meat along with prawn cocktail and other drinks. All the dishes were delicious. The Angel on Horseback, Chicken Supreme,Hilsa and Crabmeat were absolutely outstanding and highly recommended. 
For dessert we had Brownie with Ice cream, a chocolate souffle and Baked Alaska.  
Would like to visit personally for a romantic dinner.

Note:
You should be a continental lover to love the delicacies served here.
Table should be booked beforehand or else the long wait will kill the taste buds..

I ordered a chicken steak and grilled fish. The waft of steak was enough to entice me. It was perfect to soothe my grumpy olfactory senses. Thumbs up for the chicken steak. However, they did skimp on the quantity of grilled fish. People still visit the restaurant which is evident from the queues outside. They dont make reservations and the regulars have been whining about the deteriorating quality. Maybe the managers are happy with the amount of footfalls but they really need to revamp the quality of food.

CHICKEN CHIPOLATA was average...if you want a whole meal with chicken, sausages, bacons, vegetables, then only you can order....else not recommended......

While the ambience of Mocambo is very familiar to most Calcuttans, it remains the first thing one notices as the enter this restaurant opposite to Burlington's. It's a great place to go for private meetings /dates and decor reflects its warmth. I had the pleasure to dine here with my aunt and was once again marvelled as I was when I was a kid. There is no fancy molecular gastronomy or fusion food here, just good, old-fashioned continental classics. We ordered the mandatory prawn cocktail, and although the quantity of prawns has reduced (thanks to inflation, no doubt) the quality remains as good as ever. The Deviled crab was next and it still rises up to meet their exacting standards.Next, we ordered the chicken a la Kiev, another staple and pork sirloin steak which is a slight deviation for me. Rge pork was well tenderized but after the prawn and the crab, failed to spark. The chicken absolutely fizzled out.it was absolutely bland and for the first time in living memory i had to use a condiment to eat it. However, all in all a rather  good experience and the lacking food redeemed by good company

Went there yesterday for lunch. The time was not exactly for lunch so we got place without waiting. We ordered fish munier and chicken hariyali kebab as starter. Fish munier was so tasty but I feel the kebab was less in quantity. Then we ordered fish Florentine and chicken a la mocambo for the main course. All items were awesome, quantity was bit less again. We ordered tutti fruity as our dessert. It was okay-ish. 
Coming to the service, we waited for like one hour to get one dish. It was very slow and there was no such crowd ! Bit disappointed in that.

Mocambo was always my favourite place right from childhood. Located just in the heart of park Street and serving the most delicious continental dishes ever, this place never fails to amaze me. Recently went there after a gap of two years and the place was exactly the same. Dim candle lights and courteous staff and quick service was the plus point.
Don't forget to try the chicken Tetrazzini, chicken  angle on horseback, fish aladine and fish Florentine, These are the signature dishes there.
For desert please do try the baked alaska! It's the best dessert ever! 
Also tutii frutie is good enough.
Will keep visiting this place!:D

Visited Mocambo after years during a recent visit to Kolkaka. This is one place  where the food has remained absolutely consistent over the years. We indulged in some Prawn Cocktail, Deviled Crabs and Pepper Crabs for starters followed by Fish and Pork Sizzlers. The crabs were delightful, well baked, right blend of pepper, cheese and mildly spiced. The fish sizzler was awesome, bhetki is a rare find in this era of Basa. The pork was soft, squishy and tender and there was no over indulgence of barbeque sauce.  The brownies were so good that we ordered an extra one !! The only thing that disappointed was the famed Baked Alaska. The strawberry ice cream did not go well with the concept; vanilla or butter scotch would have been perfect.

One of the best places to have a continental affair. Had the all popular chicken cordon bleu. Simply loved it. Crab meat cocktail was very average. 
Screwdriver cocktail was very light. Their cocktails are seriously mild. Guess they are for the old tradition that cocktails are for women and women don't drink alcohol. :-)
The Irish chateaubriand beef steak was too freakin good. So was the Betcki Florentine. Loved the Cordon bleu so much that got one packed as well along with Chicken pavlograd (upped version of an a-la-kiev)

Overall, if you wanna eat your heart out. This is one of the places to be. Along with good beer as well.

If there's​ one place that's total value for money, this one's got to be one of them. Great food, great ambience, excellent staff, streamlined service, pocket friendly rates, where do I stop? If you are a fan of Continental, you HAVE to try to place out. They have so many signature dishes, it is difficult to recommend just a couple. Go for chicken stroganoff, angels on horseback, whole bhetki fish, pork chops, crab thermidore, or the traditional Indian cuisine. Even the desserts are to die for!

It might be due to the huge rush during the puja(nabami) The chicken oriantale was a "okay okay"type and for dessert i had ordered cold everest which was average. The two -in-one flavour of the ice cream didnot go well with it . The ambience was excellent and staff were courteous.Over all it was a average .

An absolute gem of a restaurant sitting in the heart of the city. Every element of the restaurant is on point. Be it food, ambience, staff and anything you can think of. The staff is very friendly and do suggest their best on the menu and not the costliest. The food is absolutely lip smacking. The ambience is perfect for any kind of groups. A highly recommended place.

This is one of the worst places I have been in Kolkata. It is so bad that I decided to write the review while sitting in the restaurant itself. The service was superrrr slow... The waiter had some kind of attitude. The steak was brittle.... Yes brittle.. We asked for Medium and it came super Well done...
Wastage of money!!!

Park street is known for it's restaurants and nightlife. Whenever I am at Kolkata, Parkstreet always is on the 'to visit' list. So this time, after ages, I decided to hit Mocambo. Been here as a kid several times and loved it in every way. So this visit had nostalgic expectations!

It was pre-puja times. Decided to lunch here. The good old decor and ambience was oh too welcoming. Instantly got a table,which I loved. Though the tables seemed to be crammed up against each other, we didn't mind much. Then came in the pain! Started hunting down for the menu. After waiting 15 mins,someone came in with a menu. I was comfortable as I knew what I wanted to order. But others wanted to choose, and were well helped by the house to choose from the menu. So ultimately, after hunting down once more for someone to take the order, our orders were placed after 30 mins wait. We were already hungry and expected prompt service as we had ordered simple dishes off the menu. But the entre' came in after another half an hour. Again,after we finished off and waited for the main course to arrive, another 15 mins lapsed before I asked someone to expedite.

I will say, food was very tasteful beyond expectation.  The desert was served fast, as I had already started asking for it half way through our main course.

Happy we were as our overall experience was not bad so far. But then came in the bill which we paid using card. I was in no mood to tip the waiter as the service was horrible. But my husband still tipped well. There came in the shock! The waiter came in while we were leaving and collected the tip mumbling at us that people should tip atleast few hundreds at such restaurants!!! Well,who decides the minimum tip amount? Why do they expect a tip in the first place? What kind of management keep such people on hospitality service?

Though food was good and I would like to go back otherwise, sadly the service and behaviour of the waiters have forced me to decide otherwise now.

Mocambo has been an absolute favourite since forever. Loved their Fish florentine and Chicken Ala Kiev. But on my last visit, I was a little disappointed with their service. The quality of the food didn't seem that great.
We ordered for -
•Fish Florentine
•Chicken Orientale
•Fish Ala Diana
While the Chicken Orientale tasted average, rest of the two didn't match up to my expectations. Hoping to get a better service next time!

I guess if there's any restaurant in kolkata that is very homely in it's ambiance and serves continental food that would excite an Indian's taste buds, Mocambo would be ideal. 
Be it the spicy tuna fish dip or the hawksbay prawn cocktail or the devilled crab or the chicken ala kiev or chicken oriantale or the pork cutlet or a subtle rare medium diamond cut chatauebriand beef steak, it truly amazes me everytime. However the time taken to serve or to issue a check can be a bit of a hindrance so if you visit, make sure you've a few extra minutes on your hand. 
The alcoholic beverages stand out too. Specially bloody Mary and cork screw. And they've a good collection of beer. 
Thank you Mocambo for living up to my expectations.

The ambience of this place as known to all is very soothing and peaceful. With the dim lights and well decorated interior, it gives you a nostalgic feel. The waiters are inattentive and lacks politeness. Once you are done paying your bill, they will keep hovering and won't let you sit for an extra minute. Coming to the food, we ordered-
Sweet lime soda- good.

Seasonal juice (mousambi)- was nice but a bit bitter.

Devilled crab- This is a must-have. The perfect taste and texture of crab meat blended with cheese and spices will fill your heart.

Vetki bell meuniere- This is a very tasty and sumptuous dish. The vetki fillet was very fresh and the dish was cooked perfectly.

Chicken orientale a la mocambo- A combination of buttered rice and chunks of chicken in a gravy which was slightly sour. The chicken chunks were a bit smelly . Not recommended.

Cold everest- A decent dessert.

Had the waiters been well-behaved, I would have nothing to complain about.
Price is a bit on the higher side but at par with Park Street standard.

Like Peter Cat, Mocambo too is one of the iconic restaurants from the heart of Kolkata i.e. Park Street. We had a few beers here along with some excellent starters before plunging into the main course for which honestly we didn't have much space left. The best item we found was the Murg Firdausi. This was something unique never had before. Even the prices are relatively moderate considering the location.

One of the oldest standing restaurants in park street,  Known for British colonial food delicacies.  This place is a nostalgia for the older generation.  The food quality here Isn't satisfying as most of the dishes taste similar.  Its overrated when it comes to food. I ordered for - Chicken milanaise,  Chicken paprika and griled Chicken.  Talking individually Chicken milanaise was way too cheesy.  Chicken paprika had rice, bland veggies and again a cheesy Chicken curry with a hint of paprika.  Grilled Chicken was really disappointing because the didn't serve a proper sized Chicken to fill a single individual. For desserts - meringue with Vanilla and hot chocolate,  Tutti frutti is what i ordered. The presentation of a 3. 8 rated restaurant in totally heart breaking.  There wasn't any presentation at all.  I hope the restaurant looks into this matter as people really has high expectations from this place.

Among the few icons in Kolkata.Located in the heart of the city.Went on the eve of Nabami with a group of 6.
And entering it for the first time,the pretty classic ambience with dim lit lights,the dress ups of the staffs with pagdi,and the whole get up was surely exciting and a mood changer.

Started off with a small Bacardi and to food with Grilled Chicken and Chicken chipolata sizzlers.Moving on to Moghlai we ordered Masala Kulcha Tandoori and garlic naan with chicken butter Masala and another chicken preparation(the name I forgot).
To end with we ordered 2 Tutti frooti large.
I felt sizzlers has a long way to go.
Though the price on a higher side;it was okay as per the numbers we went.

Bollywood has 3 Khans and so has Park Street. Peter Cat, Bar B Q and Mocambo. Mocambo compared to the other two biggies has a lesser waiting and popularity but for regulars like me its a place with an unique quality. Once you are in Mocambo you should not miss the steak and sizzlers. There range is way beyond other restaurants in the area. The staff is courteas and welcoming. The varied deserts can also feed the sweet tooth.
Overall the taste of food in Kolkata is incomplete without Mocambo..

This is the second time I had my luncheon in Mocambo, one of the legendary restaurants of Kolkata. I just realized I haven't reviewed this place the first time, because I wasn't into writing reviews back then. Not much have changed since then. I guess these places aren't meant to change, they are supposed to bring back a glimpse of your good old days. However, I do feel it's time to change the attendants because they lack warmth and don't seem to like their job anymore. 
Coming to the food,  we started off with chicken golden drumsticks, chicken meuniere and Greek drunken prawns.  The meuniere was exceptional in taste with tender chicken pieces, the rest two were average good. The original chicken garlic steak sizzler was nicely cooked and lip-smacking.  Chicken pavlograd is actually a jumbo version of chicken Ala Kiev with an avalanche of butter once you dig inside. But eat it while it's hot or you won't be able to finish it. It was fun watching the your dessert Baked Alaska ablaze and baking in front of your eyes. As for its taste,  I would recommend you to try it once and experience yourself.

Recently the restaurant was in the news for all the wrong reasons but despite it all it's time to change my stand and give them there due credit.
Mocambo as we all know is one of the legendary restaurants of our city and has been around for quite a while.
Ambience- an old world feeling greets u when u enter there which is great but I do believe the place needs a redo badly or maybe I'm just bored at looking the same place so many times.
Food- exceptional as always. Chicken ala Kiev being there champion.
Service- not at all warm n very ill tempered despite of everything. The stick is so far up there arse that they forget that there salary comes from the patrons cheque. Immediately sack the present staff and get some new ppl who know how to make ppl comfortable as service is a major part of fine dining
Price- nothing as exorbitant but neither reasonable.
Overall a place for good fine dining.

Mocambo is an icon of Kolkata's food world. Ambience and service was great, I absolutely loved it when they served beer in good old silver mugs( may have been white metal but adds to the heritage of this restaurant).
Ordered the fish fingers first . It was served with a good tartare sauce. The batter was perfect ie light & crunchy and locked the flavour of the fish perfectly.
The chef's special pork cutlet was awesome. It was literally a monster sitting on the plate. Had a thin , crunchy & tasty (actually perfect crust). Inside was a filling of cheese , bacon and minced pork which was perfectly balanced and I just fell in love with this dish.
The Sirloin stake was good too and the meat was perfectly cooked not to mention a great bbq sauce and tasty coleslaw. 
The cost was surprisingly affordable.

Overall a great experience. Recommended when you are in Kolkata.

Well talking talking about the staff they are good but a certain man who was taking our order didn't seem to be quite in a good mood!
Coming to food. I had ordered ▪Prawn Cocktail ▪Paprika Chicken ▪Fish a la moutard
Quantity was really good and satisfying.
The food was delicious ! How ever the rice portion these two main platters was really pale in taste. Other than that I couldn't find out a flaw. My bill resulted to 1185 inr. Lastly it is worth the money and the food leaves you with a desire to revisit.

Entering this place, takes you back in time with like red lamps, sofas instead of chairs and individual cubicles. Pretty classic. 

We ordered the very famous Chicken Ala Kiev. Its a deep fried fillet of chicken with melted butter inside. So as soon as you cut it, melted butter just oozes out. Its tasty but heavy!

Then we ordered the pretty classic Chicken Tetrazzini. Again tasty but heavy. 

We also got the spinach pillows. Very nice. I could have made a meal of these. 

I was so full after this meal, that I couldn't think of even looking at the dessert page of the menu.

This restaurant has my childhood memories . I had been visiting this place since I was 6 months old . My family always preferred to reserve the table before hand since it is always occupied with guests . I visited this restaurant during last February and I won't regret my visit at all . They had extended their dining area and had done some renovations in the bathroom area . Coming to our dinner menu , We had chicken reshmi kebab , fish mayonnaise and prawn cocktail for starters . Each of them were equally good . Added to it , I had cream of chicken soup . For dinner , I preferred to have chicken Tetrazzini which was loaded with cheese , chicken and spaghetti along with mushrooms now and then . I actually couldn't complete my dinner and so I preferred to take back home as parcel . Dessert is mandatory after dinner in which I had vanilla icecream with brownie since they were currently out of stock with my preferred desserts . Otherwise , thumbs up to the service .

I visited this legendary outlet today for a date with my better half. We entered around a quarter to one and found it nearly empty. We were seated on a 2-seater table just in front of the entrance. We ordered Chicken ala kiev and Irish Beef Steak along with our drinks. I simply loved the juicy buttery Chicken ala kiev whereas found the steak to be okay-ish. The staff were very friendly, helpful and polite. Only downside I found was the waiting time for the signature dishes. The price is reasonable to be frank and the classy ambience is a bonus. Overall, a nice experience!

Visited the restaurant after about 20 years. Went for lunch on a weekday. Place was quite full - an indication of its popularity. Old fashioned menu - don't think they have modified the menu in the last two decades. Wanted to go back in time and taste the lobster Thermidor - it came smothered in cheese. Looked tempting - however it was not very warm and the cheese had congealed - gap between kitchen and serving staff perhaps - distinctly appeared that it had been prepared and set aside for quite some time. Too much cheese and white sauce did not allow the true taste of lobster Thermidor to come through. The boiled / sautéed vegetable sides were cold and stringy. My friend ordered a fish la Diana - it also had cheese - perhaps a pinch of salt would have made the dish perfect. Pork cutlets were good.

The only thing good about this place is the ambience.. Food is pretty average.. Although they have included some vegetarian dishes, staff is super arrogant about any further customisations.. High time the staff need to tone down, given the options opening up in Park Street.

For those of you who do not know this, Mocambo is owned by the owners of Peters Cat. You will get the same feel as PC when you enter this place. Same ambiance and decor. Much better in service thought. Food quality wise i felt PC is ahead.

We ordered:

1. Chicken Steak Sizzler - Standard serving of a sizzler includes rice or noodles but this one did not have either. I wanted BBQ sauce which they didn't have. Chicken was soft n juicy and the mushroom sause was decent. Overall 3.5 on 5.

2. Saag Panner - 4 on 5 as it was full of flavour.

3. Chicken Do Pyaza - 3.5 as chicken pieces were a tad big and not as soft as they should be.

4. Matar Pulao - 4 on 5, it had that classic buttery texture you get at PC.

5. Orange Blossom Mocktail - 5 on 5

6. Crepe with Chocolate Sause - 5 on 5. This is a must order dessert. Its a crepe which has vanilla icecream inside and topped with Chocolate Sause, walnuts and cherry.

Overall i would not recommend the place for sizzlers but rest of the items were good.

We chose this place for mine and my brother's birthday treat and guess what, it was a complete disaster. We were literally cursing ourselves that why we decided this place as our destination. 
We were very excited to have some real good food. Since we were mostly biriyani lovers, we ordered *mutton biriyani, *mutton dopiyaza, and *chicken oriental ala mocambo which was a chef's special dish! And from staters we had *mutton peshwari kabab. Now coming to the stater, we were literally awed to see the mutton pieces which were not actually pieces but may be the left overs from their kitchen. Then coming to their so called chef's special oriental dish, it was just the worst dish we ever had in our life. I wonder how could this be their 'chef's special'. And now the biriyani and the dopiyaza, they tasted mediocre but the quantity was so less that I think one have to have two biriyanis for getting one's tummy filled properly. And yeah they gave us chicken biryani in the first place even after ordering mutton biriyani.

Very pathetic experience we had here, and most importantly it ruined our treat. We could not even gather the courage to order for dessert, thinking again how bad would it be!! 
*Filled with regret*

There was hair on the garlic bread and when mentioned to the staff they simply got another one placed it and was simply walking away without any regret or apology, looks like a dropping hair on the food is a common phenomenon here.

One of the legendary restaurants at Park Street which is slightly over rated and very much overpriced.

The taste of food no longer matches the "Mocambo standard" except a few items. They still make awesome Fish Muniere (Beckti) but the Sizzlers have a long way to go. The chicken is chewy and not juicy enough. 

Service is good, though at times the staff (the older ones) behave quite indifferently.

Price is on the higher side.

We visited Mocambo on our trip to Kolkata as tourists. While the ambiance and environment adds a lovely Calcutta touch, we were hoping to get a taste of the heritage, which was the disappointment.

We started with the Hawksby Prawn Cocktail, which was also a heritage dish but didn't live up to our expectations, and that was a big put off. We had also ordered the chicken sicilliene and irish beef wasn't that great either. To top it off, we were served extremely stale dinner buns. The only dish to remember was the meringue sweet dish. Quite disappointed considering it's such a famous place.

A posh dining place in the posh area of the city. The ambience looks very classy and service is good as well.
However, the Food is not so great. I had ordered a meat lasagna. Turned out that meat lasagna does not have a tomato base sauce in it but had slices of raw tomatoes on top of the lasagna layer. Something very unusual. Other dishes were all "okayish".

Legendary place . The food here was simply awesome ,the standout being the devilled crab . Being in Kolkata u expect the fish preparations to be awesome and they were . But they had very snobbish captains and had a " I am doing you a favour " expression throughout . The stewards were very polite though . The ambience is very nice . Repeated visits are a must .

Super good place if you like cheese and friendly staff. I really liked the casual way in which we were suggested different items. 
We started with veg cheese Alexander which was great. Spinach and cheese pillows were good. The chef's special chicken mocambo was a average fare. Basically almost everything had copious amount of cheese flowing and we got tired of it towards the end. Good location though and nice decor.

First of all, after seeing most of the shops and restaurants shutter down on 15th August, I was happy to see my destination open. Saved my reputation in front of fiance and would-be-sister-in-law!
This was my second visit. So I confidently ordered deviled crab which is a blockbuster. But the wrong step was to order the lobster thermidor, which is of exactly same taste as of the crab. Both the items were full of cheese, and over consumption of it made us uncomfortable. I wish I ordered only the lobster (last time I had it at Ocean Grill, who served only the outer shell of it!).
Bekti bell meuniere was okay. We already had tastier food, so it did not cut deep.
Mixed fried rice was good. Full of chicken.
About the service.. not very happy. We waiting for only 15 minutes for the crab, most part of that time went by clicking selfies. But after that we had to wait more than half an hour for the main course to appear. We ordered another mixed fried rice which took another 20-25 minutes to be served.
I saved my coming up wedding by saying " you are looking damn beautiful, they want to hold us longer" 😛 But for a heritage restaurant like this, I guess there is nothing to do. Usually they don't listen to customer feedback as they are long established.
Suggestion: if you are not a fan of cream, cheese etc, ask for the preparation before ordering. Most of their items are full of it.

If you are from Kolkata, or a foodie visiting Kolkata, I am sure you are here because you have heard so many good things about this place. And i shall not give you a very different outlook here. The food is top notch. The alcohol is moderately priced (sometimes the choice of beer is limited). The ambience and decor is just as you saw in the movie Kahaani.

My friends and myself are frequent visitors to this place anytime we crave for beef or pork items. Chateaubriand beef steak or Pork cutlet, either of them has been on my plate every time I am here. But do not forget to try their prawn cocktail. Actually I just cannot start naming dishes here, else i would have to convert their menu from jpeg to a word file. 

Pro Tip - This place is always under rush. If you are a couple or visiting with family, it would be easier for you to get a table. Stags and solo enthusiasts, you will get your turn, but need to wait longer than desired. Visit the nearby olypub in the meantime and treat yourself with some cheap alcohol. 

Gentle reminder - I hope you haven't forgotten the famous incident. Be dressed for the occasion or at least be presentable, if you are not here on a visa.

Ahh, being an Kolkattan and a food lover, how can I forget this place ? It used to be our to-go-place for continental food in childhood and youth. Even today, if I am looking for some old-school value for money joint, probably, this will come in the top rank. 

Now, here, I order few pre-decided items and frankly, for some unknown reason, couldn't go beyond them. The first one definitely is the devilled crab and/ or prawn cocktail. a good amount of crabmeat, mixed with capsico and served in re-used crab-shells- it it the signature dish of the place. Ans, so is the prawn cocktail. With the rising cost, now, the quantity of prawns is on a decreasing mode, but taste-wise, it's still one of the best. Now, for the chicken a la kiev, I know, Olypub makes it at a pocket-friendly price (2 pcs), but taste is far better here. The sizzlers are okay-ish and nothing special, maybe because, I am not that big a sizzler fan. But, the next dish that I always order is chicken a la dianne. It's basically chicken breast stuffed with then-prawns-now-shrimps and covered with sauce dianne- a definite must-have. The final item that is not to be missed is the Baked Alaska. The simple reason is, they put a heavy dose of meringue and that makes the most difference. 

A meal for 2 would cost around 1000/- and is justified. Service is on the verge of being snobbish and stiff collared (some call it shitty), but never mind. Food compensates for it.

We ordered Irish beef steak ( although we ordered for a well done steak they gave us medium rare ), and Angels on horse back. The bacon wrapped chicken tasted good. Ambience was decent so was the food.

The term Mocambo is an Ambundu word meaning "hideout"; however the facade of Mocambo is no frills affair.

To me it's a legendary outlet which has never let me down each and every time I visited w/ my friends and family. We were greeted and shown to a corner table by a well-spoken gent. The decor inside is very homely, infused with incandescent lighting thudding off the lively walls. Sections of the walls had customer testimonials and notes displayed, further enumerating the reasons why this place has thrived!

We kicked off w/ a Chicken Cordon Bleu, Angels on Horseback and Chicken Ala Keiv, followed by a Chicken Tetrazzini, Pork Cutlet, Surf & Turf and a Mixed Grill Ala Mocambo. The food was extremely well cooked and sumptuous. The best part is they have retained the standard for so long.

Though they have increased their inner space it's still one of the most crowded restaurants of Kolkata; hence, they may need to increase further. Apart from that there's no other reason that has ever let me/ us down.

I've made Mocambo my go-to restaurant, their quality will remain the same if not exceed my expectations.

Thank you for serving us over the years w/ such warmth and really really good food!

Regards,
Sayak

I'm part of the third generation of a family that has been going here ever since it was opened. After all these years, the pleasant ambience hasn't changed and the food is still delightful. 
If you're there, you must try their Crab meat Cocktail/ Prawn Cocktail & Chateaubriand Beef Steak with Mushroom Sauce. The combination has almost become a family tradition.

Well if I am in Park Street for lunch and dinner my first choise is always Mocambo. I am a big big fan of their devilled crab and Chicken Ala -kiev even have tried lots of different platter and I was never disappointed. The problems of this place are the long queue and the waiting time and also the staffs can be pretty rude sometimes.

Undoubtedly it is one of the best restaurant in park Street. Excellent ambience with ethnic interior decoration. We orderd mocambo ala sizzler plater, fish florentine,  spaghetti with meatballs.  All the dishes were delicious. Fish florentine was excellent. Costly one but it's OK looking at the ambience and food .

Quality and taste of the foods are deteriorating day by day. Staffs are also not behaving well,don't cooperate in any manner, refused to serve foods and even few staffs are arguing with the customers unnecessarily without considering their lacuna in services. Service is also very slow and the staffs are concerned only to few known faced customers. Now time has come to reject/ leave Mocambo.

One of my loved restaurants on park street! 
Pros - Nice decor, great food particularly the sizzlers, great place for friends and family, parking on road in front (but depending on your visiting time you may find ir challenging)
Cons - Nothing as such
Advice - Is it possible to add a light jazz music to the environment.
P.S. - A recent incident @deterred its image but I feel that has been a bit exaggerated and blown out of proportion. The restaurant allows anyone and everyone who is decently dressed and maintains basic etiquette.

A visit to park street on a weekend brought us to yet another iconic name in the foodscape of Calcutta..this place alongside Petercat are both owned and run by the same management and they have maintained their tradition of serving delectable meals to satiate all your cravings..we ordered murg firdosi bari kebab as starters followed by mixed grills ala mocambo,chicken paprika,chicken supremo and chicken biryani..the grill items were tender and tastefully spruced up to my liking..both the other items were nicely decked up and were a delight for us..numerous visits counting and yet Mocambo never fails to live up to its reputation..

Waiting on the street for an hour. With parents. Not even offered a chair/stool to sit on. Plus, pathetic attitude of staff towards waiting customers, no empathy whatsoever. Does not seem like the renowned restaurant it is touted to be. Hugely disappointed.

Park street, the heart of the city, known for having best restaurants. Mocambo is the one of the most popular and classy restaurant in park street area. One of the best thing of Mocambo is its ambiance. Juat awesome. Behaviour of the restaurant staffs is very polite. Food quality to very good and price is quate average and pocket friendly compare to other restaurants. Do visit this place. Being foodie!!

Not a good visit. Had to wait really long to get our turn. The place they provide us to sit was good though. Had few items like the famous crab meat. But i feel the aithencity of the crab was missed in the dish by putting meyonese. Had sizzlers which was again not up to the mark. Dont know whether we will pay another visit or not.

We visited this restaurant during Durga puja, it was full house on that day so we had to wait 10-15mins before we got seated.
Ambience is just awesome with the perfect combination of lighting and arrangements.
We ordered :
Chicken Ala Kiev : One classic dish, this one couldn't hv gone wrong.
Deviled Crab : it's absolutely delectable.
Chicken Tetrazzini : This one was one hell of a dish, so delicious that I plan to come back for this dish only.
Chicken Chitpolata Sizzler : didn't like it much though.
Baked Alaska : this one was a sumptuous looking dish, perfect way to end our dinner!

Service was fast although staffs weren't much attentive.

Heard a lot about the "devilled crabs", but it turned out to be a disappointment. There were bits of shells present too in the dish. The other dishes were just okay, nothing extraordinary. Even the trutty frutty ice-cream had a load of banana and apples in it, instead of papaya or peach as I had expected. Bananas really did not go well with the item somehow. Overall disappointing, considering the price!! Nice ambiance though.

The most vintage restaurant in Calcutta so far. Located just in between of Park Street. This place is usually very crowded to a get a table.
The decor and the interiors were classy and vintage.
We ordered grilled chicken sizzler and golden corn and cheese risotto which were amazing.
For desert we ordered Baked Alaska which again was amazing.

Well this place is utter disgusting. I believe this place should shut down immediately. Stale food. Disgusting atmosphere. Uncourtesious staff. I just had my lunch here and it was horrible. The chicken steak it was cold and stale. The veggies were from yesterday. The beer was good that's it. I won't go to this pace ever in my life. My childhood Mocambo and this mocambo is way too different.

One of primemost heritage restaurants of Kolkata, located on the left of the Park Street and RaniRashmoni Road crossing. We still use it as a landmark for directions around Park Street. It has a very old English kind of feel and the moment you enter you feel as though you have been transported to the Victorian age. The waiters are very well dressed prim and proper. Going down to order some food is simple, just follow what is there is those red boxes marked specialities. We started with the Creamy chicken soup and then went to Devilled crab and Pepper crab(one of my all time favourites here). We also ordered the roasted chicken ham salad along with the staters. Then we ordered individual sizzlers. The pork sirloin steak was my choice to go with chicken steak and meat lasagne by the rest of the group. For the dessert we had Baked Alaska and couldn't stop ourselves from polishing the dish off the plate in no time and craving for more. We had a full belly and a content heart as we left the place.
Would love to revisit any number of times.

P.S. - I couldn't find the Chicken ala Kiev in their Menu the last time and I was very disappointed at a cword favourite being pulled off, could you include it back again.

The interiors of the restaurant is no doubt top notch and is well furnished. But the serving staff's manners were quite questionable. Firstly, they didn't cater to our need in a proper manner. Not only that but also they handed us with the bill, though we hadn't finished ordering our food items.
Coming to food quality, it was quite good, but not the best I have tasted. Also the price is quite unreasonably high given the taste and quantity of food served. To be honest, this restaurant is for people who can afford to pay high in return for keeping their stomachs empty.
Overall, I would say I wasn't satisfied with the restaurant and that proper justice wasn't done to its brand name.

yet again Mocambo has sustained it's reputation of being arrogant.....went inside for a good experience...instantly got bombarded with lack of hospitality and humbleness...i dont understand..what is the cause of their arrogance ? are they nuclear scientists at ISRO or engineers from IIT? what is exactly their business model ? i feel that their business workflow goes something like this :

1) invite guests inside --> 2) behave with them like pricks --> 3) show them the way out --> 4) if new guests have arrived go to step 1.

After waiting half an hour inside , being offered a rickety corner table with dimensions suitable for dining purposes of serving a squirell or a skunk ..we were asked if we ordered our food....well...they forgot that they need to provide the menu card first....we requested a chair to keep our belongings...but we were denied (in quite an obnoxious manner) ..then some random guy in suit (they probably think wearing a suit is the only attribute needed to be a gentleman but somehow they end up being pricks..without fail)..comes up and asks if we have given an order (without being offered the menu card altogether)...we could not wait any longer because the bahavior was pathetic enough to douse our hunger....we left the place after that...sans food...sans hospitality...

Mocambo , you are a piece of shit restaurant....and will always remain a piece of shit restaurant....wearing a suit does not translate into being a gentlemen....having good oration skills in english (for you it's "INGLISSSS" ) and having a shit attitude does not translate into being classy (for you it's ke-la-ssiikk)..and having arrogant employees will not translate into making profits reaching the zenith....behave yourself Mocambo....being shit is not the way towards good business...

Had dinner at the famed Mocambo, Kolkata last night. Staff, ambience, service time, all OK. Clean washrooms :) No maddening crowd, being mid-week. 

Ordered two (small ones) of JW Red Label and Veg Seekh Kebabs. Food (Vegetable Cannelloni and Mixed Grill A La Mocambo was good enough (could have done without the mountain of grilled chicken liver though). But had some hangover today morning. Any way to know if the liquor we order is the liquor that is really served? JW should not be giving me a hangover, surely!!

Mocambo is my all time favourite restaurant in Kolkata. The sizzlers are awesome, the devilled crab inimitable and as for Cecil's Jazzed -you won't know unless you've had it. I also recommend the Lobster Thermidor, the a la kiev, meuniere, hilsa, fish a la diana and the list goes on. The decor and service are great. If you haven't been there, I'd recommend a visit.

Today, I went to Mocambo for lunch, for the first time. I went with high expectations, having heard extensive praise for this piece of Calcutta's food heritage, from a number of people. However, my experience was shockingly bad, to say the least and I would highly recommend that those of you who haven't been there just stay away from the place and save your time and your money.

After ordering an appetiser (shahi kebabs, which were average) and drinks, I ordered the Chicken Tetrazzini for my main course. After encountering extremely slow service (the food took almost an hour to reach us), I was finally served. Being almost halfway through the dish, I happened to encounter shards of bone that I almost choked on, which I subsequently showed to the staff. They profusely apologised, as the dish was meant to be boneless, and promised to replace it. As the others were already ordering dessert, I asked for the dish to be replaced and packed. 

I came home, opened the box that I was given, and was shocked to see that Mocambo not only failed to replace my dish, but also packed the shards of bone that I had shown them. I speculate that the callousness and carelessness exhibited by the staff comes from the baseless sense of entitlement and superiority that this restaurant reeks of, given that it's been around for several decades in Calcutta. However, just because something's been around for a long time, it doesn't mean it deserves to stay around. It is my strong suggestion to all of you to not bother with a restaurant that promises a fine dining experience, and instead delivers arrogance and disappointment.

It's is considered as one of the best restaurants in park Street area. It also has its popularity for sizzlers after Peter Cat. 
A couple of days ago I went there and ordered Mixed Grill ala mocambo.
Ambiance and staff behaviour was very good but the food was not as per expectation. Taste could have been better. Chicken/mutton (I don't know) liver was not boiled enough and tasted bitter. Sausages were also not that good.
Overall nice experience but not satisfied with the food they offered

One wonders how do you mix up royalty with good food and then you know there is MOCAMBO. One of a kind heritage restaurant in the heart of the city . Its spacious , you do have the liberty to enjoy personal waiters and the interior is majestic.
The beautiful paintings and simple yet attractive lighting is commendable .I myself have been here couple of times and its feels new every time . Cleanliness is a regular duty for the workers which takes the place at par with global standards.
NOW , bringing the crowds attention to the food in mocambo 
I personally loved it .Only last day I had two great chicken dishes with fine cocktails and at an average price and it really felt good . The dishes are mouthwatering and it caters to variety of cuisines each made with due care and taste .
When one thinks of park street I guess mocambo is one of the best places to have good food and enjoy the classic ambience.

Yet another popular restaurant apart from Peter Cat, which is known for its Sizzlers in Kolkata. Mocambo, one of the well-known restaurants for their continental cuisine. 
This place is usually crowded and people wait to get-in late into the night. It is very surprising that none turn back. The décor of the restaurant is very pleasing to the eyes. It isn’t very quiet here as the tables are placed pretty close to each other. Service is prompt, and I genuinely appreciate their efficiency. Now coming to the food, we had ordered for: 
1.	Fish A La Diana: The fish was prepared very well, tender and juicy with lovely cream sauce. It served perfectly as a starter.
2.	Fish Florentine: This is one of the Chef special dishes. Bhekti steak in chopped spinach cheese sauce. This is amazing! 
3.	Fish Steak Sizzler: When it comes to fish it is either Bhetki or Pomfret. Mocambo’s sizzler specialities are mouthwatering. We had opted for Pomfret, and the taste of the sizzler lasted for long. A sumptuous dinner indeed, and a must visit for all who would like to have good sizzlers.
                    
Ab "Mocambo ne khush kiya" :D

The ambience is classic retro. The lighting is dimmed and that is what creates the feel of the restaurant. The food compliments the decor. Varieties of options to choose from. Perfect for a hearty meal and heart to heart conversation with your special someone.
The portions served is adequate. 
The service is a little dicey. If there isn't much crowd then you will receive your order on time but if it's getting crowded, you might have to wait a little longer than usual. The quality of food is good. The staffs are cordial and prompt. The place is a little expensive but the food is worth your every penny.

The only complain I have is that the table cloths look ancient with stains of food and drinks on them.

If you are going on a weekend specially in the evening, make sure you take your time and go because the cue is pretty long.

Must try: deviled crabs, angel on horse's back, lasagna, chicken supreme, pork cutlet.

I visited this place last week when I was in Kolkata and the best part about this place is the old world charm it still retains.

This place churns up the best continental fare. Year after year the spinach and cheese pillows still taste the same. The desserts are the highlight for me as this is where I tasted meringue for the first time.

This place is an eternal favourite because it serves Continental and Indian food at the same time. So it is one of the places we go with my dad as he prefers Indian food.

We ordered

Spinach and cheese pillows
Paneer Tikka

Tomato Spaghetti
Mushroom and asparagus risotto
Mushroom crepes

Navratan korma
Veg begun bahar
Naan, roti

Meringue with ice cream
Tutti fruity

The crispy flakes on the spinach and cheese pillows make it totally delectable as the softness of the pillows coupled with the cheese sauce and the crunchy flakes make it such a perfect dish.

The Paneer Tikka is really yummy and so is the other Indian food as Mocambo belongs to the same group S Peter cat which is famous for their chelo Kabab and other kebabs.


The tomato spaghetti here is my favourite as there is something special about the tomato sauce.

The mushroom and asparagus risotto is a must try specially for people opting for vegetarian food it is a great dish with a perfect balance of flavours and loads of mushroom and asparagus packed in.

This place offers really good crepes and crepe lovers can definitely give it a try.

The meringue is an in house special dessert and I opt for it every time we go.

Long queues, haughty and disrespectful staff, overpriced food. You are in park Street doesn't mean that every dish should cost an arm and a leg. On top of it, it sometimes seems to me that the waiters here are the owners of this place. 
Coming to food, we ordered a meat lasagna, which came cold, as if from refrigerator. On asking the manager about it, he started defending it saying that lasagna is always served cold.

Will never go to this place ever again.

Mocambo is unparalleled when it comes to 'continental' (Calcutta's name for European cuisine).  Try the devilled crab, prawn cocktails, sizzlers, stuffed tandoori, a la kiev, fish a la diana, baked alaska (that emperor of desserts) - actually everything on their menu is great. I wonder why they have removed the Wiener Schnitzel and sad as I am, I'll still give them a 5 star. For their super courteous service and for remembering to give me my beer in pewter glasses :)

This restaurant owns its name because of its food quality and taste. we ordered pork cutlet from chef specialities as starter. It matches every word of description given. it was stuffed with ham and cheese which was insanely tasty and mouth watering with bread sides and coke.. then as main course we ordered meat lasgana and fish a la diana - both was super tasty. fish a la diana had both vetki and prawn and both nicely cooked. At last we had vanilla ice cream with brownie with hot chocolate sauce it was typically good. Sayan Mandal

I am pretty sure that the word of mouth spreads way faster than reviews on zomato.. but I believe zomato has a database of niche customers who love continental food... So, to appease them, I went out last evening with my family to this wonderful heritage restaurant.
We ordered fish diana, chicken a la Kiev, chicken cold salad, crab cocktail, fish moutarde, chicken garlic steak and baked Alaska...
Fish Diana is not anymore that creamy gooey cheesy thing of mocambo.. I in fact believe that one step up makes better diana now a days. Fish moutarde is not something special and you would forget the item right after having it.
But what stood out are mocambo's heritage a la Kiev, cold chicken salad, garlic steak, crab cocktail and baked Alaska. Crab cocktail was a sheet delight , cold and filled with crab meat mixed with cream. Yummm... A la Kiev is a dish which needs no introduction. Deep fried, butter filled chicken dressed with boiled veggies. Wonderful.. cold chicken salad is one of the best I ever tasted... And let's come to baked Alaska.. my suggestion to every customer would be to try this without a miss. This is awesome with fruit mixed custard cum cake inside a creamy cover ... A must have.
The hospitality of mocambo is very good, no complaints about that... 
Heritage ambience, classy hospitality, great taste and sheer pleasure... That's mocambo for you in a nutshell..

Visited this place yesterday with some friends of mine. The place is quite easy to locate. The ambience is pretty good almost like peter cat and the food is amazing. The price is a bit on the higher side but it's worth it.  The staff was good. The only reason I didn't give it a five star is that they were super late in serving our orders.

One of the finest restaurants I have ever visited.
The food as well as the ambience is very nice.
If you want to have the best continental dishes in kolkata,come to mocambo.
It is also more or less pocket friendly compared to other places in park street

Dinning st Park Street simply means Mocambo. All time favorite place. Chicken Alakiev is just awesome especially when you dip it in d oozing butter and eat. Then comes the Fish Florentine they make the best. Have eaten fish Florentine at other places but Mocambo makes the best. The next best dish is Fish Ala Diana it's just amazing and a must for all fish and prawn lovers. It's like a fish cutlet stuffed with shrimps topped with sauce cheese mushrooms and u have small portions of veggies to go with. Tried a new dish this time that's Fish Wellington it was also good but one should not eat the Ala Diana first and then have Wellington (you will not appreciate Wellington because the latter is just awesome). Coming back to dessert the presentation of Mango Alaska is beautiful (check pic) tried a new dessert called Cold Everest, it's fruit cake topped with fruits covered with ice cream and garnished with walnuts it's good. There's one more drink it's called Strawberry Crush it's good too.Do try these signature dishes and fall in love with Mocambo over and over again. Happy Eating.

Situated at the heart of Park Street, this place has always been a crowdpuller. So, when we entered after a 30 minute wait, we ordered appetizers cream of asparagus soup and a cocktail. Steak is a must have here and we had chicken steak in mushroom sauce. Tandoori grill mixed a la mocambo was great too. In main course, we had meat lasagne and risotto. Finished the meal off with a brownie. Though the food was very good, it lacked a little on the other service aspects, may be because we were visiting  during the rush hour.

Mocambo - the name does rhyme with an age old hindi cinema villain but this place is a hero is its own right. A perfect fine dining restaurant which oozes class and personifies the age old classy feel.
Service is good and pleasant. Everyone knows about the menu which is of great help.
We had ordered a Chicken Ala Kiev and a pasta in white sauce. The chicken was spot on with butter oozing out of it. The pasta was tasty but had too much cheese and corn starch for my taste.
Also Mocambo is located in an awesome place so I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Kolkata.
PS - They have steel beer glasses. Pretty cool.

Visited this place with a couple of friends seeing that this place is always crowded, however so not worth the wait! We waited 1hr for a table for 4 on a Saturday evening.  While the food menu is limited with the bare minimum options for vegetarians, the service was swift.. We had a mix of non veg and veg dishes... Pork cutlets, drunken prawns, paneer tikka, prawn curry, paneer curry all of which tasted alright.  However,  Pls do not venture to try the mushroom crepes, it was quite sad to end my meal with this dish. Also not recommended if you're vegetarian. Overall a below average experience.

They take time to place your order but the waiting turns into happiness as the foods are heaven. If you are a food lover you may visit the place. I must go again.

This place is a bit okay-ish.
The ambiance is good, the waiters, though I know there is a big fuss about them, were decent. But, the food was just average.
Their signature dish Devilled crab is good, but Strogonoff and Chipolata both are nothing special. They overdid the Chateaubriand steak. Finally, the baked alaska was just not for me. Overall a pretty mediocre experience.

My colleague and I had visited Mocambo much before the furore over the driver Manish occurred last year. We had ordered Chicken Cordon Bleu for appetizers, Beckty Bell Meuniere as the main course and Chocolate Souffle from the dessert menu. All of them were savoury, and our tummies felt happy after the lunch. However, the lighting inside appeared too dim....perhaps the interiors could be made a bit brighter and, consequently, cheerful!

Yes its legendary for non vegetarians, but for veggies like me, there is such limited options available here. Tried their only veg sizzler, which was very basic, boiled vegetable's actually, the aloo tiki was also normal, nothing exciting.

The second dish I tried was spinach corn crepe, which was good, had very high garlic taste and strong spinach presence, the upper layer of cheese was awsome, the white sause also was very high on flour and I could taste flour out of the white sause. Over all just once a try for vegetarians for the nostalgic feeling it has created for itself.

Bottom Line: It's primarily super famous for steaks/ sizzles. However if you're a vegetarian, you can surely give this place a skip, since they only have one vegetarian steak option, which was surely not to my liking . On the other hand, it has the old world charm and legacy value which one can go for and has the all time fav dishes too. Non-vegetarians it's a heaven for! 

Sight: there is no doubt that Mocambo has managed to freeze itself in town, what with the cubicle seating and white capped waiters 

Smell: since it's a star in the space of sizzlers, there's one for sure on every table and so the place is always filled with its aroma 

Taste: as mentioned above, it's a heaven for non vegetarians!

Well had a huge crush on this place till the moment I stepped in. Starting with the food, everything looks very pleasing to the eyes. The things are decorated with colorful veggies boiled to perfection and your appetite goes on a roll. The moment you taste them, a slight disappointment creeps in. You are still not sure enough to trust your first bite and you go for the second and try another piece on your plate(hell, you got things to choose from because all the platters are wholesome!) .And now totally sure that things aren't going to get better you silently surrender. Like even the dessert wasn't 10/10 which is an exception for me.  I like almost every dessert.. :P 
Coming to the decor, it looks amazingly posh, I have no clue why. 
The waiters were a disappointment.  We being a small close gang were loud and obnoxious as we were having a final outing together, and the waiters kept ignoring us.. :P 

Something about this place reminds me of the proverb, not everything that glitters is gold.. :P

One of the best places to be in, if you believe in superior and consistent food quality.
The ambience is pleasant, with waiters dressed in traditional attire.
The pork cutlet is outright delicious, and the Irish Chateaubriand beef steak is in a league of its own.

Visited this place on numerous occasions. But never got around to writing a review. Always thought, so much is already written about this place, do I really have anything new to add ? Anyway, for the sake of record, here is my take of this restaurant.

Every major city in the world will have a few restaurants which has become something more, they have become a part of history of that city. Mocambo is just such a Kolkata institution. It is a place with a retro look, serving retro food. It transports you to another era with the servers wearing dresses similar to those I have seen on some History channel documentary on the British Raj. The so called "continental" food served here is from a different era as well. At least I haven't come across Chicken Tetrazzini at any modern UK restaurant or any other restaurant in continental Europe for that matter. Nevertheless, I liked the taste of most of the dishes that I tried here, with spicy tuna fish dip and devilled crab being my favourites. Some of the Indian dishes that I tried are quite good as well, although they are somewhat less spicy than more traditional versions found elsewhere.

The servers and managers here sometimes display too much attitude and service is a tad slow. But when a restaurant packs its tables day in and day out for decades on end, they must be doing something right. Here you can be guaranteed food of a certain standard at a reasonable price. So if you are in a mood for food plus bit of history, do visit this place.

Items ordered:

1. Devilled Crab and Spicy Devilled Crab
2. Fish a la Diana and
3. Mix Grill Sizzler

The crab was too creamy and cheesy that i could not even pick up the taste of crab at all...
Fish a la diana was perfect and that is why this item is one of the best selling, perfect fish, prawn nd gravy.
Sizzler for me was ok, not bad and not great either...!!

This place is located beside tung fong in park street.
One of the legendary restaurants in the party street of kolkata which often finds its mention along with peter cat. Specialising in continental cuisine, this place has a very long and exhaustive menu and makes u spoilt for choices. Each dish is a meal in itself.This place is always jampacked,with customers waiting outside for their turn to come on sunday afternoons.we went there on a sunday evening and the place was quiet empty. We orderd for meat lasagne and steamed betki with spicy sauce and boiled vegetables.
Coming to the food:-
1. The fish was properly cooked and quiet soft and the sauce was bang on.
2. The meat lasagne on the other hand was burnt and had to be replaced.
This place was on news for their ill treatment of a customer based on his financial background. So we were a bit apprehensive about the service here. However things went well.
On a personal note i didnt find the food here out of the world as some people describe. I have had better. But overall it was a nice experience. A second visit is recommended

This place is fantastic. The food is absolutely delicious. Mocambo is a go to place if you're looking for an impressive meal. The steaks are my personal favourite. I'd definitely recommend the beef steak with the butter garlic sauce. That just leaves you on cloud nine of food heaven. Efficient service and reasonable prices makes the place more appealing. I feel like the decor can be worked on. But all in all, it provides for a wonderful experience.

I have visited mocambo numerous times. Certain items on their menu can never bore the taste buds.

On the top of my list of hits on the menu are, Devilled Crabs as an appetizer / Cream of mushroom soup. Don't bother trying prawn cocktail if you don't like thousand island dressing. The prawns are smothered in it. I don't like the sauce , so I steer clear from the dish. The fish fingers are smelly. You can get way better fish fingers at the city clubs like Tolly/ ILSS/ CRC.

Chicken Tetrazzini/ Prawn thermidor/ lobster thermidor for the entrée. Singaporean steak / Ham steak is equally good. Angels on horse back / chicken Ala Kiev is too much of the same thing. Gets difficult for a person of an average appetite to finish. Stroganoff/ Chicken steak is so so. Not a hit for me. The risottos are too dry. They have lovely garlic naan in case you go for Indian. However I don't find their Indian sides appealing.

For desserts mango Alaska in season / Baked Alaska. I feel it brings an interesting end to the fine dining experience. A person should try a baked Alaska atleast once. It may not appease everyone's taste buds. I don't find the fruit cake they place inside it upto the mark as compared to the quality of food they serve. However it is a highlight dessert which I feel everyone should experience atleast once. Souffles( both mango and chocolate)/ meringues are average . The meringue looks appealing though. Strawberries and cream is average. Vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce is divine. I love their age old method of serving the chocolate sauce in a gravy boat. Their chocolate sauce has a distinct taste which I prefer with my ice cream as compared to Hershey's chocolate syrup or any other extra chocolatey syrup served elsewhere. Theirs tastes very different . Peter Cat serves the same sort of syrup. Both are to die for.

I know most of the people reading this review will be interested in the baked continental dishes. A word of advice , don't order an appetizer and an entrée which are both cheesy. It creates disutility. I was very sqeamish once I tried so. Try avoiding such a situation, if you know you have similar issues.

Update from 25/6/17

This time we tried "Cream of Mushroom soup" and "Devilled Crabs" for starters .
"Chicken Tetrazzini" , "Chicken supreme", and "Tandoori mixed grill" as mains. The baked dishes were mouthwateringly good as always. The quantity of the devilled crabs have been highly reduced, although they have worked on the presentation. I really think that the quantity needs to be increased for this dish in particular. The tandoori mixed grill was also disappointing. The taste of the kebabs were fine but it didn't quite sit right with me. Other than that , I will definitely keep visiting them for their baked dishes and absolutely sumptuous cream of mushroom soup.

Update from 18/9/17

This time I decided to try a few new items on the menu . The "mulligatawny soup" was lovely and so was the "cream of mushroom" and "cream of chicken soup". This paired with with " buttered bread rolls or garlic bread" makes for a perfect start. Then I tried "pepper devilled crabs". It's not at all spicy. It has a subtle hint of pepper with big fat mushrooms and crab meat stuffed in with a cheesy filling, indulgence at its best I tell you. For the main course I chose a "beckty fish sizzler". It's a lot like their fish meuniere on the sizzler base but since I hadn't tried either of the two dishes before , I decided to give it a shot. The fillet of fish was thick and filling. The sizzler brought the sumptuous meal to a sumptuous end. This was the best sizzler I've had at mocambo and I would definitely recommend it.

I had to wait for a very long time in terms of years, but I finally managed my first visit to the iconic Mocambo restaurant in Park Street along with my family today in celebration of Mother's Day.
In terms of appearance and ambiance, Mocambo was spot on, very similar to its counterpart Peter Cat.
Now to the food and service. We started of with appetizers consisting of Prawn Meuniere and Fish Florentine. Although the waiting time was a bit too long, the wait was worth it as the food was quite delicious. Having a tad of moist in the meat made the prawns just melt in our mouth.
Next was the main course, the orders were for a chicken paprika, prawn thermidor and a lobster thermidor. The thermidor dishes were accompanied with bread rolls and butter. And I must say, they all were unique in their own ways. The chicken paprika's creamy texture along with the accompaniment of rice really helped the dishes' flavours to come out on its own. The prawn thermidor was the surprise winner for me as the taste of the prawn and the base of white cream sauce made to perfection really went hand in hand. Add to that the cheese crust, and I could see my sister craving for wanting more of it. And lastly the lobster thermidor which I had ordered was one of the best lobster dishes I'd ever had. The portion sizes of the lobster, that were properly grilled with the cheese crust on top, accompanied by sauteed vegetables and few pieces of spiced macaroni really made this an outstanding dish.
Overall the first time experience was good, but where it lagged behind was the delay in services despite having a 60% capacity. Secondly, serving of water and non availability of tissue paper was a let down and had to be asked for after several attempts.
The food was the real winner for me, and I hope to visit this place and replenish my appetite for amazing seafood sometime soon.

An icon that contributes to Calcutta's heritage landscape.

I am vegetarian and went for the spinach & cheese pillows. Main course was veg tetrazini. The pillows made for a satisfying indulgence. Now I cannot claim to have had an authentic tetrazini; I had to look up its origins now. In comparison, there was hardly any spaghetti but plenty of veggies. Without comparison, I found the cream element overpowering and the whole disk generic due to its blandness.
 The pineapple blossom was glorious, just so refreshing. Are blossom drinks a Calcutta exclusive concept? I realized I haven't seen them on menus in any other city. 

I'll put all other information aside and say this is a must visit for being so distinctly unique.

After that huge turmoil and controversies this is my next visit there. Overall its third. The main thing I like about this place is the ambience. If you are in search of good food then you should definitely drop by this place, order some good continental food and enjoy a quality time. While placing the order just ask the attendant about the details of the food as the names
 are quite  unconventional. I have ordered chicken a la kiev, fish a la diana, devils crab and mutton steak. 

Food:- 4/5
Decor:- 3/5
Ambience:- 3.5/5

Great food, the sizzlers here are the best in Kolkata.
This resturaunt's  ratings have fallen due to the recent fiasco, but the food is still good, and I've never personally been told to stay out because of any dress code, even though I have worn shorts to this place.
Must tries are the devilled crab, and chicken chipolata, if this is your first time here.

Mocambo is like one of the most classic places to satisfy your taste buds if they are seeking for continental food or steaks.
Food :
Chicken papprika : Served with small portion of rice and tastes really good. 
Chicken steak sizzler : Perhaps one of the best sizzler i have tasted in kolkata. Its perfect and the chicken is juicy with the correct amount of everything.
Spaggheti with meat balls : The spaghetti tastes good and the meat balls are perfectly done.
Fish Florentine : its cheesy and it tastes really good.
The ambience is all lit up and nicely done. Perfect place for dining out with family and friends.

It is only fine dine not meant for families even 5 stars dont behave like this.we were with our 1 yr baby he was sitting on the table just playing.manager on duty told us to make him sit on the sofa only.
Now comin to food..we ordered for fish steak n chicken steak both served cold.n not fresh. We did not complain as we were already irritated.

I always wanted to dine there..nd when I went,  it was so crowded that we had to wait outside for almost 45mins and because of that we got a little irritated first, but later our mood changed after seeing such a decorated restaurant..it was very spacious. we  ordered devilled crab nd mutton cutlet as a starter along with drinks. , Both were very tasty. They served drinks in some copper mug, which was very attracted.Now, as in main course we had chicken sizzler. That was awesome..the waiters were very prompt..they dressed like some "rajsahi type"..finally I must appreciate their beautiful  decors. We disliked only one thing, that it was a bit noisy!!!!

Mocambo is the legendary restaurant of the city. When i was young i visited this place ample of times . This is one of my parents favourite restaurent so on 21st of this month, on their anniversary I thought of treating them in Mocambo. Ambience is still that same and it gives the 90's feeling. Coming to the food we ordered sizzler, chicken stroganoff, Beckty bell meunière. Each dish was amazing and they never fail to keep the same taste and quality. Its always a pleasure visiting this restaurant .

I went there with my family for lunch,we ordered angels of horseback (4.5/5) , mutton hamburger steak (3.5/5) and the fish A La Diana (4/5) and for dessert we opted for the mango alaska (4/5).The ambience as usual was very good and the decor was soothing,there was quite a rush as it is a holiday.The service was a bit slow due to the huge rush..

I went there with my friend to celebrate his birthday.
We ordered fresh mango juice and strawberry blossom for drinks.
Then for the main course we had Chicken ala Kiev and Meat Lasagna.
First the Chicken Kiev - It was very nicely cooked along with baked potates,pasta and salad.
The whole thing was stuffed with cheese and the preparation was just superb.
Secondly the Lasagna- It was one of the best lasagna I ever tasted. It was stuffed with a lot of cheese too. Each bite I took, made me want to eat more and more of it.
Finally for dessert we had a tutti fruity item ().
The only drawback was service was a bit lagging, they took more than 15 minutes to bring our food.
We liked the food immensely and it made up for that delay.

I had wanted to go to this place since a long time, but its long queues always made me leave and eat at another place. But after the incident, the place has really lost its crowd. 
We went there last week and got seats without waiting(yaaay). The decor is really nice and the staff were on their best behaviour.
We ordered devilled crab, pork cutlet, pork sirloin steak, angles on horseback and chilli beef. The devilled crab came on the shell and was full of cheese and I felt that the crab was lost somewhere. The pork cutlet was really good. It had cheese oozing out from the middle and was cooked well, with the aioli as a perfect accompaniment! We ordered the pork sirloin steak as a sizzler and it was good too. The angels on horseback was a bit of a disappointment as the chicken was overcooked and the bacon wrapped over it was limpy. The risotto that came with it cant be called a risotto, it was more of tomato rice. The chilli beef was on their special menu that day and it was delicious! 
Overall, mixed experiences as some dishes were really good and some fell flat!

I have been here twice and both the times I was highly impressed by the level of service which Mocambo has to offer. Words would be less for you guys. Starting from the doorman to the managers, everyone is courteous. The gentleman who served me... I am sorry I don't remember the name but I am pretty sure his employee no.  Is 5. He is an asset to your restaurant /company. The food has been amazing everytime I have been here. They have a lots of variety from the menu to choose from. Honestly I dislike when it comes to continental cuisine but I think I have developed a taste for it now. There cheese and spinach is something you should try. The dessert cold/cool everest is wonderful.its a must actually. The food portion is proper and the prices are reasonable. I would surely be back once again. Thank you for the service. Keep it up!!!! 😊

This legendary restaurant was long in my bucket list..finally paid a visit..the staff was very friendly and courteous..guess they have improved after the turmoil..
The ambience is warm,cosy..those lamps on each table make it extra special..
We ordered Meat Lassagne...well this dish is one of the best Lassagne i have tasted in years..creamy cheesy stuff with minced meat..mamma mia..5 star dish..
Next..the original chicken garlic steak..again a great dish...handsome piece of chicken..well marinated..juicy..soft coated in a finger licking sauce..accompanied by fried potatoes,veggies and an yummilicious pasta..tad bit disappointed by absence of mashed potatoes...
Roast Chicken with garlic toast..quite similar to the steak..the chicken was a bit fibrous..average dish for me...
Overall a nice experience...

Mocambo - One of the oldest restaurants in Park Street, and indeed, the whole of Kolkata.
The restaurant is famous for its continental and north Indian food. The ambience and decor are pretty nice and this restaurant is perfect whether you are going for dinner with your family or with your friends. The staff are extremely efficient as well.
We ordered the famous Fish A La Diana - bhekti stuffed with prawns. It was amazing. The cheese gravy in which it was provided was simply awesome.
We also ordered the Lasagne, but sadly, the crust was burnt. The manager, however, was extremely efficient as he immediately prepared a new one for us.

Overall, a great continental restaurant with delicious dishes.

Innumerable fancy cafes and pubs may have sprung up in every nook and corner of the city, but even today a good continental craving drags us to nowhere else but Mocambo. Fancy names coupled with 'done to perfection' taste entice not only our taste buds but also bring out the food connoisseur in us.

Being a citizen of Kolkata and writing about Mocambo is indeed a very partial and cliche thing to do! No matter how many times you visit this place the food never fails to impress me. 
Do order for Chicken Al Kiev, one of the best dishes this place serves. So the kababs and the steaks are a delight. So if you are someone who is visiting Kolkata do check out this place for a sumptuous treat.

Awful experience. Stewards and bearers are impolite and haughty. Had to wait for almost 1.5 hours for the order to arrive. Had ordered screwdriver but there wasn't any liquor in it. When I enquired about the same, a senior steward told me that he had been in the business for 20yrs and it couldn't have gone wrong. He didn't even taste the drink to ascertain the same. In addition, he lectured me on how light a drink screwdriver was since it had only 30ml alcohol... However, the next screwdriver was perfectly fine and the difference was evident. Had never seen such arrogant staff even at roadside dhabas. Food was average. Nothing out of the ordinary. That was the first and the last time that I tried Mocambo... There are many restaurants in the Park Street area which are far better...

We had actually planned to have lunch at Peter Cat, but the length of the queue outside the establishment demotivated us sufficiently. Mocambo seemed to be a good second option. It was pretty crowded as well, but we were lucky enough to get a table as soon as we entered. I was half expecting a burst of old-world-charm to hit me in the face, but the decor turned out to be quite contemporary, and a bit under-whelming to be honest. The ambience, though, was quite pleasant.

My friend, who had been here before, insisted on starting off with a plate of Tandoori chicken. I doubted whether North Indian food would be their strong suit, but inspite of my meek protest, we ended up ordering one. As I had suspected, it turned out to be quite ordinary. It wasn't bad, but not exceptional either. Better sense prevailed when we ordered the main course - Fish a la Diana and Chicken Milanaise. The Chicken Milanaise was a riot of cheese, with some amount of shredded chicken and ham thrown into the bowl. The taste of cheese overwhelmed all other flavours, but being an admirer of cheese, I found it quite to my liking. The Fish a la Diana was more flavourful, and a bit on the tangier side. It was a healthy mix of prawns and mushrooms and some other stuff which I failed to discern. Both the dishes were extremely fulfilling and we had to struggle a bit to finish them, which further made me doubt my friend's wisdom on having ordered the plate of tandoori chicken.

All in all, it was a pleasant experience dining at Mocambo. If I am to be honest here, it lacked the charm that you would expect from one of the so-called "legendary" restaurants of the city. But if you go there without any expectations, you'll find the place quite agreeable.

Mocambo much needed to expand, which they have done . The new section is very tastefully done up . But the food quality has gone down tremendously . Continental dishes are just an overdose of white sauce and cheese and butter . 
We ordered a Russian salad which was good , so was the desert . Main course was surf and turf , served cold and was insipid, the chateaubriand steak was again served cold with macaroni, two bits of potatoes and peas . The mushroom and pepper sauces , well the less said the better . Not a very nice experience , heart bleeds to see a landmark if Calcutta in this state . Sir please improve , we have no where else to go !!!! We love the place , Our Mocambo !!!

Food is awesome as usual.This is one of those unique and oldest restaurants in Park Street which is still holding the tradition of European food.Chicken steak sizzler in pepper sauce/mushroom sauce is the best here.I have tried chicken steak in so many places but this restaurant's steak is my most favourite.They do give pure Bekti in Fish steak which is very tasty and we foodie Bengalees can easily identify real Bekti over Basa.Drunken fried prawns is excellent to start your lunch or dinner.Chicken a la Kiev is a Russian speciality and is cooked to perfection in Mocambo.Fish a large Diane deserves special mention.It is Bekti stuffed with King prawns in creamy sauce.
Staff who deserves special mention: Pranab Lama.He is very courteous and knows how to treat guests cordially.

This is one of my favourite restaurants in the park Street area. Its name bears the vintage feel of calcutta. Quite a heavy weight restaurant in name and fame. It was indeed a superior quality oriented restaurant but recently I found the price not justifying the quality and the quantity. Anyway mocambo would always be my favourite. 
Their ambience is good. Decor quite nice.
Now coming to my favourite- the dish, angels on horse back. I simply love it. The name is fascinating and also the look. The Continental preparations are much better than the indian ones. 
So my advice to the first time visitors here, don't try their indian cuisine, instead feel free to choose any Continental menu from their la carte. :)

Now here's a slice of history if you're a food buff. This place will evoke nostalgia from almost all Kolkata old timer and quite a few of the new gen too. Its one of the classic restaurants of the city and amongst the favourites too. They may have lost a few points due to that incident some years back but they have not lost their classic tasting fare at all. The crab cakes are still yummy and the steaks still leave the most wonderful aftertaste in the mouth. Each and every item served here is pure class. The interiors may have dimmed down a bit with the passage of time but they have maintained their standards very well over a long period of time. A must visit if you're a foodie and in Kolkata.

PS...Crab cakes are must have. Haven't found better anywhere else.

This is one of favorite restaurants in Kolkata and this time also Mocambo didn't disappoint me..well atleast to a large extent :-D The ambience was good as usual and the staff was also courteous. Now coming to the food, we had ordered the Irish Chateaubriand Beef Steak, Fish A La Diana and Fish Florentine along with Bud. The meat was perfectly cooked-medium rare to be precise..it was fresh and succulent but the sauted vegetables served along with the steak was nothing extraordinary. Steak without the mashed potato was a bit disappointing though! 😞 Fish A La Diana was also quite nice. The beckty stuffed with prawns dipped in the creamy sauce was the perfect item to devour after the oh-so-awesome steak! After these two dishes, the Fish Florentine was a big let down! Maybe since we do not like spinach that much and the item had ample amount of the same or some other reason I don't know but it really failed to live up to the expectation. Overall a nice experience!

Amazing place. For people who have been in peter cat, this place will look similar,the carpet and the lampshades specially. 
Food was brilliant. Chicken cordon bleu is one of the best dishes I've ever had. The ham inside was bliss. Meat lasagne was enjoyable, but it gets hard if it's cold (like all lasagne), so have it quickly upon arrival. Angels in horse back was also good, but the rice felt really sweet. Also, I felt that the chicken could be less tough. 
Overall, an experience one should have time and often. Despite some incident maligning the restaurant, judging solely on food and ambience, Mocambo is a gem of Park Street, and of Kolkata.

The restaurant enjoys a great fan following till date and will continue to do so but me and my friends’ impressions were on the downside. We ordered for two soups- cream of spring chicken and minestrone italienne (veg), veg lasagna, chicken tetrazzini and devil crab. The chicken soup was good while the veg counterpart tasted simply like a tomato soup. The lasagna and tetrazzini were tasty. However, to me, the devil crab was just ok keeping in mind that it is one of the signature dishes of the restaurant. 

The interiors are impressive and the ambience ok. Considerable attention needs to be given to the conduct of the waiters. And yes we had to wait really really long for our bill to arrive. Not looking forward to another visit in near future.

Mocambo is a well known, seasoned name in the Kolkata food scene. For years it's the place to go for delicacies from an era gone by. Known for their sizzlers and meats you can't go wrong here. Being here is like being in and getting a taste of the bygone days of Kolkata. Hours can pass here in the glow of the incandescent light. Service is good, though the servers need new uniforms (some of them put Michael Jackson to shame) and the school keds are a whole another thing. All in all one can't help but feel a little nostalgic here and leave with a sign and those unfailing words ringing in your ears "Mocambo khush huaaa"

The desserts weren't that great (had the chocolate and orange mousse - it says soufflé on the menu - it is NOT a soufflé lol). Maybe the other stuff on their menu are better. The picture is of angels on horseback.

Iconic restaurant of Kolkata..one of the best n the oldest in the heart of Park Street..

Cordial staff but a bit late service..
This place is famous for its continental n italian dishes..Sizzlers r really amazzzzinggg..
Cocktails n desserts r cherry on the cake..
I had ordered a Chicken steak sizzler with mushroom sauce..it was really yumm..Must visit atleast once😍

Visited this iconic Kolkata restaurant on the 20th for dinner. The décor with the lights hanging over the tables is something of a trademark now. Ordered the chicken chipolata sausages and the fish Wellington . The food was well cooked, not overdone at all. The service could be a bit better . 


The breads rolls ordered as accompaniment were a little disappointing. Overall, it is still one of the restaurants to eat at in Kolkata.

The decor and lights give you a feeling of 70s.
Only thing which I didn't like last time is that their staff literally kept standing near our table.

Mocambo is quite a known name among the Bengal elite. The atmosphere and arrangement of the entire place reeks of the royal vintage treatment the visitors are accustomed to receiving. The price they charge is a tad too much for it, though. In my humble opinion, this place earns more points for the decor, etiquette of the staff as well as the overall feeling of grandeur it radiates. I visited this place one fine night with my date. We ordered Strawberry smoothie, Deviled Crab, Ham steak and La Kiev Chicken for the main course. The smoothie was disappointing. The crab and steak were too delicious, and I thoroughly enjoyed the presentation and the way they tasted. For dessert, we ordered a Baked Alaska and immediately regretted doing so. To put it plainly, it was horrible. The taste was too bitter and nauseating. The cream or the ice cream couldn't mask it either. The walnuts present at the base were also stale and bitter. Also, the staff took outrageously long to take orders and serve the food, even for a terribly crowded place. We were unnecessarily delayed in being given the bill as well, and that caused us a lot of trouble as returning from Park Street on a Sunday night at 11:30 PM can be a nightmare. I've given this place a 2.5 solely for it's steak and decor, and also because of the hype this place already gets, perhaps.

This place is among the most elite restaurants in kolkata. The place is seemingly very good for continentals and what I found out personally, this place has a good old charm about it. Even the people dining were sofisticated enough to call it a big restaurant. However, for a Miyabhai, this place is shit as I can never get in terms with having devil crabs and meguine while missing out on kebabs and chaap. The genuine feeling was I never wanted to be there although my friend had wanted me to be there. The place is good for people wanting to have continental but not for a guy like me who craves for Mughlai.
For the selected bunch of people in love with continental!

This place was in my wishlist since a long time and finally visited this place.
The interiors are pretty with nice hanging lamps giving a candle light feeling.
We ordered a Devil's Crab for starter which tasted heavenly.
For mains,we had Chicken chipolata which is a sizzler that came in a bed of vegetables and sausages,bacon.It tasted pretty good like any other normal sizzler.
The Fish Diana is a unique dish and tasted nice.
But the chicken Ala kiev is full of disappointment.The deep fried crust is too thick with a not so tasty stuffing and full of butter and served with a spoonful of pasta and vegetables.
The staffs are not at well courteous.
Service is prompt.

Another iconic park street restaurant...used to serve fantastic continental dishes but their quality has somewhat faded a bit and the service definitely needs to improve...they need to buck up and stop basking in past glory coz there are new quality restaurants coming up everyday in kolkata...that being said,their devilled crab and prawn cocktail still hold their place as one of the best in kolkata...I quite like the ambience created by the dim lights and they have expanded their seating area...it's recommended to reach this place well in advance because of the huge queues almost everyday...

A Pre-holi lunch date with my BFF(s) . We went around 1:45pm ..it was not much crowded .We ordered a)chicken strognoff -it was not bad but I have had better at other places 
b) chicken steak sizzler - the sauce was tasty the quantity was good there was ample amount of cabbage carrots onion rings everything but the chicken was not of an extremely good quality ( i found it not to be fresh) but it was good .
c) bhetki bell meuniere - this was the show stopper undoubtedly but again the fish was not that fresh .
d) Fresh lime sodas- i know nothing to complain about but could have been better

Staffs were attentive not extremely but pretty much .

Pinch on the pocket - pretty much  reasonable for a group of 3 .

This was not my first visit .The quality has definitely gone down the line . 

Nothing with the taste but quality should never be compromised with .Atleast not expected from a heritage .

Even after a lot was 'said' and 'done' Mocambo remained one of Kolkata's favourite spots of all time. It's been at the heart of Park Street for so long now that it's existence and glory is impossible to ignore. It's always been one of my favorite picks in the city as well. But sadly both their service and quality of signature dishes have somewhere faded over time. While their most popular devilled crab still holds its place at a foodie's heart, their Chicken Chipolata has degraded drastically. The service has been rather compensated. One of the the things that turns me off about a restaurant personally is if they don't change my used fork/spoon while changing the plate (they were in it). Something that I at least do not expect from Mocambo. One of the stuff members just simply picked it up from my used dish and placed it on the new one. Plus, in spite of telling them specifically to serve the appetiser first followed by the main course they gave them all together. Even the much loved souflle couldn't cheer me up in the end. It's high time with all these lovely promising new places all around the city, the old ones if not raise at least maintain their bar rather than loosing it all with bad moves.

The chicken steak was simply amazing and mouth watering because it was so juicy, soft and tender. The chicken biryani was good too. Overall the bill along with drinks and food was fitting our pocket.

Part of the over hyped restaurant group. With a terrible ambience and a not so courteous staff. Never order their meatballs or should I say pepper balls. Their crab appetizer was "hairy". More of a drinking joint where non drinkers can go for the chex mix. All in all, mocambo khus nahi hua.

Well this is a quintessential Kolkata restaurant. A hard core resident of Kolkata would swear by some of the restaurants in Park Street and Mocambo is definitely one of them. The restaurant has recently added some extra seating and that can cater to a lot more people now. There are a few all time favorites of this. The Devilled Crab, Crab Cocktail, Angels on horseback are all must try dishes. Basically if you want a taste of Old Kolkata with its colonial feel Mocambo won't disappoint you.

Mocambo is heaven. It represents the love for food for the people of Kolkata. The fact that it is located in Park street adds more to the hype. There's nothing that needs to be written about this legend. All this place needs to do is keep doing what it has been doing for so many years. The food is as good as it can be. The fish florentine is my favourite. The sizzlers sizzle as much as a sizzler should sizzle. The ambience has its own charm.

Today I have visited the restaurant with my hubby. The restaurant is maintaining it's legendary essence as always.  The staffs are very courtesious. The ambience is calm and peaceful. Now when coming to the food quality it's always been my favorite continental cuisine place in Kolkata.  First we have ordered Fish La Diana (Two big pieces of Betki stuffed with cheese mushrooms prawns and served with sauted boiled vegetables)   which is very yummy and delicious. Then we ordered for Chicken Chipolata (Rosted chicken legs served with barbecue sauce and boiled vegetables) and the famous and my all time favorite Chicken Alakiv (a whole chicken with a crispy coating and stuffed with butter and cheese).  Overall The restaurant fulfilled my expectation and would like to visit again and again.

Even though being the only guests at the restaurant, the food didnt seem upto the mark.

We order an angels on horse back. The tastes over all was moderate. But we found the chicken undercooked, chewy and dry.

Following that came fish a la diana. The worst thing that could happen was raw fish. Prawns fleshy and undercooked. The horrible smell of raw bhetki stunk for a while.

But still with hopes remaining we waited for baked alaska. A burnt alaska arrived. And somehow the cakes and walnuts underlying the white icecream were all bitter. It felt terrible.

Promise to never return again.

When new in town seems to be the buzz around town - places like Mocambo remains true to the old world charm and essence of Kolkata. The heritage food is always good for all d foodies in the city. Although, being a vegetarian I can hardly savour a minuscule percentage of their menu. However, their veg continental dishes like cannelloni, veg surprise etc r always a delight for d taste buds. They should work on improving their linen, tableware and service.

My first trip to Kolkata began with a bang. By that I mean, Mocambo is the first place I went to after landing here. It was highly recommended by my dear friend Shubhranshu who lives here. I personally love Fish and he gave me a list of things to try out. As I entered, the ambience was very appealing and the welcome was very warm and friendly. I had the Spicy Tuna dip with Garlic Bread Toast points which was fab and Betcki Bel Helen Fish which is a mildly sweet  main course with prawn, mushroom and veggies. Thoroughly satisfied. Will recommend it to everybody who visits Kolkata.

Serving since 1956 Mocambo in true sense is really a legendary restaurant. As you enter into the restaurant will get a warm welcome. Staffs are v.courteous and cordial. Interior is classy. Will take you back to old days. So definitely 5star on interior and ambience.
Now coming to the food ordered their famous DEVILLED CRAB for starter, ANGELS ON HORSE BACK, MUTTON HAM BURGER STEAK (sizzler) for the mains.

*DEVILLED CRAB- One of the signature dishes. Crabmeat served with mustard sauce and gooey cheese spreaded all over topped with egg slice. Served beautifully on crab shell. A MUST MUST have. This dish is to die for. 5/5

*ANGELS ON HORSE BACK- Another recommendable dish. Chunky pieces of chicken fillets wrapped in bacon served on a bed of onion and sausage risotto. Added with potato wedges and fresh salads.
The risotto is just mind blowing. The meat is so tender and juicy. The salads, nicely cooked sausage and bacon were complimenting each other so well. Another hi5 for this. 5/5

*MUTTON HAM BURGER STEAK (Sizzler)-Must say this is a giant dish. Me and my friend remained awestruck for few minutes. The popping sound of the sizzler, the tempting smell made us more hungry.
A huge burger served with sizzled salads, grilled tomatoes,zuccinis and potato wedges. I didnt liked the burger much. I found it dry and much fried. But the portion was really really good. 3/5

It took 2hours to complete them all. Me and my friend was so full with these that there was no empty chamber for desserts. 
All in over a worthy visit. And again do try their Devilled Crab.
And now the price. Again it took away my heart. Costs 1265 bucks. V.reasonable comprising of quality and quantity. A must visit for all. 😊

Visited Mocambo after quite a long time around 3 years. Must say this restaurant has changed a lot when it comes to their food quality, hospitality and service. Nothing to say about the interiors and ambience - as usual nothing much has changed. It has a soothing ambience of a 1970s diner. We were 10 - had to wait for 20 mins to get in. Ordered veg florentine and spinach and cheese pillows for starters. Even though served In 30-40 mins Both were delicious and worth the wait. Then we ordered standard North Indian breads, Chana masala, dal Makhani for main course. Again the food came in 20-25 mins - bland dal, ordinary chana masala - rotis were good. Service is very poor. Staff is not at all courteous - they seem to have that sense of superiority but probably they aren't aware of what this restaurant has now become. 2.5/5 only for starters.

Mocambo, One of the quintessential continental restaurants of Kolkata.
Before going there I had made up my mind to taste all their recommended dishes.
The ambience is pleasant and the restaurant is quite spacious.
Here's a list of things we had ordered-
Chicken Paprika, Angels On Horseback, Fish A La Diane, Chicken Ala Keiv, Risotto with Chicken Liver, Devilled Crab, Fish Florentine, Chicken Cordon Bleu, Chicken Steak with mushroom sauce, Grilled Chicken, Pork Sirloin Steak.
Each and every dish which we had taken tasted equally good.
Fish A La Diane and Fish Florentine were cheesy and too delicious.
Devilled Crab, a beautifully crafted dish that was full of crab meat, cheese and egg.
The Risotto was also good.
I haven't tasted such delectable steaks before in my life.
To all those who are planning to visit Mocambo try all these dishes. You won't be disappointed.

Mocambo is my favourite and one of the Park Street's oldest food joints of all time.Their red shaded yellow lights hanging on top of the tables always attract me.
 If you want to have real continental dish then come to Mocambo.

I visited this place twice and each time they left me in aww!
For foods we have ordered Devilled Crabs,Chicken Liverto,Pork Sizzlers as well as Pork Cutlet,Chicken Chipotola.
Fish  A La Diana and Fish Florentile are two fish preparations that we had and absolutely loved.The amount of cheese they put in a food is so tempting that i can't tell.
If you are in the city and looking for a fine restaurant with a vintage touch then come to Mocambo.

I recently went there in order to attend an informal marriage party. I have been here before 13 years ago. There is no change in the decoration and ambience. More than enough sitting arrangement. A large number of waiters on the move. 
I had entered with the hope that I would be able to savour some very classic and authentic continental cuisines, but since the organisers preferred North Indian, I had no choice.
They chose an assortment of veg and non veg kababs and biryanis to go with it. I found the kabab pieces too small. But the food was very tasty. 
The staff was very courteous and expert. But that does not make up for the fact that the food arrived way too late at the table. The children in our team suffered due to it. Other than that , I found nothing to complain. Great experience.

Although termed as a legendary Park Street restaurant, I didn't have that good an experience here. Went here with a group of friends for dinner. The quantities of dishes, mainly in main course was very less. Also, the staff seems least bothered about anything and the waiters are quite rude (this point has been repeated in so many reviews I wonder why doesn't anyone take notice). The ambience is good though. I would say either avoid, or just go there for the ambience and food taste without much expectations of a friendly environment.

The legendary restaurant serving good food for decades now. This was my visit after a gap of almost 5-6 years and accompanying me was my jijaji who's as enthusiastic about exploring new places as me. We went after 7pm and thankfully my jijaji had booked a table for two of us beforehand. The place was not full back then after as the night grew darker, the place also became more crowded. And by the time we had finished at 9pm, we got to see more than ten persons waiting outside for their turn. So please book a table beforehand if you're planning for a weekend visit here. The ambience is great. You get the feel that it has been serving foodies for decades once you're inside. Serves almost 70-80 people at the same time. The staff is courteous and very helpful. We chose Tuna fish Dip for starters. And along with ordered screwdriver and one black dog (large and small) for two of us. Appetisers came quickly within ten minutes or so. Tasted very well. Then we ordered Chicken Pavlograd and Risotto with chicken, Ham, Bacon and Mushrooms in the main course. The food took quite some time to arrive but once it arrived, we had forgotten about the time delay because of its taste. Special mention to the Chicken Pavlograd : it couldn't have been better. I highly recommend it. Not one for the calorie conscious people though. Risotto was delightful to taste. All the ingredients were balanced in the right proportions. Service was really good. Cost us around two thousand rupees. A must visit!

One of my favorite place to dine out in Kolkata park street area. The all time preferred order is 

Fish fry with tartar sauce as starter
Chicken Steak Sizzler with Mushroom Sauce
Mutton Roganjosh with Butter Naan
 Caramel Custard as the best finish

Quality of food is up to the mark and value for money
Ambience is authentic with the traditionally dressed humble service men are the added flavor to it.
Only you have to wait a bit to get the worm food prepared. 
No per-booking option to avoid the queue.
There will be a long queue on every Sunday and any other rush days. Which other way shows the popularity of the place
You have to have at least 45 in - 601 min waiting time to get a table

Overall a delicious experience to go out with.

Back in the hallowed dining area of Mocambo after ages and its almost as if not a thing has changed. The decor, the servers and the maître D's all seem as if they are stuck in a time warp (in a good way) because the old world charm exists in abundance in this place.

I always raved about the continental food and sizzlers in both Mocambo and Peter Cat and this we ordered the following:-

1. Spinach and Cheese Pillows - full of spinach and cheese baked over literally as soft as a pillow with a melt in your mouth experience.
2. Chicken Chipolata Sizzler - served on bed of veggies with lots of sausages, Bacon and ham to go with it. Just brilliant.
3. Beckty Me Meurine - a grilled beckty served with  potatoes, carrots and peas. Left me reminiscing about the days when there was no Basa because this was proper beckty.
4. Caramel Custard - all time favourite dessert as yummy as always.

Always a pleasure to dine at this place.

Cheers,

Mocambo is also one of the oldest restaurants in park street. Easy to locate. Famous for its devilled crab. Mocambo best serves the continentals than any other type of cuisine. Continentals served has classic taste. What I personally felt that you can getter better food in less price in other restaurants in park street. Mocambo has that colonial gesture and ambience..but on the basis of food you can reject it for many other places

I am not a continental buff, but as a recommendation of a dear friend I visited this restaurant with lot of hope despite it's latest wrongdoing.
It was the last week of year-end so, the place was full with lot of people, and fortunately within 10 minutes we got a pair of seats. Despite, lot of people to serve and cater, we literally grabbed one of them to get us served, that too after half an hour. Really, felt very annoying as many restaurants give super attention to each one of their customers.
We ordered Devilled Crab, Fish a lã Diana and Fish Meuniere. All of them are good because these kind of food cannot be found in whole of Kolkata. Really, a paradise for people who love to eat different food and different cuisines. But, here comes the hiccup!!! I don't know, whether I have distaste for cheese or not, I found all foods are unnecessarily poured with lots of cheese, sometime so much that it ruined the distinct taste of fresh fillets of fish. I wish, there would have been courteous amount of cheese if it requires at all, to enhance the creamier nature of food.
I would love to go to this place again, if they don't bang their head because of some weirdo dresscode/etiquettes. We foodie don't have any etiquettes other than dipping our soul in tasty foods. Rated 2 because you cannot judge anyone by their dresscode if you don't set a standard for yourself. WE ALL ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT.

Steak Lovers, stay away that's all i am gonna say.The definition of Steak was completely murdered, you cannot grind the meat and then serve the paste as Steak.Disappointed to the core since i was planning this visit for a long time now.They need to seriously find a chef who can cook Proper Steak the one's they serve is ridiculously, remotely not even close to what a steak actually is.Until they serve proper steak i am gonna stay away from this place and also advice other steak lovers to try their luck somewhere else. Grinded, minced meat....you gotta be kidding me.

This place is not worth spending money for ur food.
Ambience is classy undoubtedly...service is delay ...staffs are not sober... If u r a big time foodie like me this place is definitely  not the right place for u to dine 'cause quantity is not much morever pocket pinch is high. Overhyped .
Not at all recommendable 'cause there are hell lot of options there in park street which offers great food with enough quantity and they will satisfy both your taste bud and worth spending money for.

After the famous horrible incident at this place, I prefer to avoid this place at all means.
Yes. It is true from my very own experience last year and many others' and almost everyone will notice the weird high-rise-nose attitude in their staffs.
Ambiance is good enough for a family dinner. Service is very slow.
I had very high expectations from the Chicken A La Kiev because I'd heard so much about it. Very disappointing. That much oil and butter oozing out from it will make you lose your appetite. Even the chicken wasn't anything special. The Irish Chateaubriand Beef Steak was good though which was served with a tasty butter garlic sauce.
If I ever go back then it will only be for the Devilled Crabs which is in my wishlist from a long long time.
Too costly for an experience so mediocre and a food so overhyped.
-0.5 for their racist behaviour and low value for their customers.

Mogambo is the same fine dine restaurant which refused to admit a lady with her driver. Though I do not wish to go into commenting about the infamously famous incident, I would love to write about my gastronomic experience there. Situated at the famed Park Street, Kolkata, this is one of the best fine dine eatery in Kolkata. The personnel are polished and know their cuisines well. The ambience is opulent and seating comfortable, with light music complementing the relaxed feel of the place. The menu has a host of authentic and novel dishes and the prices are not sky high, unlike Delhi.

As I was in no mood for a bargain.  But, unlike my expectations I enjoyed dining there n would definitely go sometime soon. 
Wonderful food. Excellent ambience. Nice, quaint interiors. And a warm welcoming staff. What more would a hunger stricken foodie look for?

Not much to say as all food lovers know what Mocambo can offer you. This is one of my personal favourites and visited quite a few times. If you want to have a real mouthwatering delicacy along with the Sophistication and Hospitality of Vintage Calcutta, you have to and I repeat YOU HAVE TO visit MOCAMBO.
Last time visited for a Family lunch on Nabami afternoon. Though we had to wait for 1.5 hour to get a table but it was totally worth as always. Ordered Devilled Crab, Pork Sirloin Steak, Chicken Steak with Mushroom Sauce, Mutton Biriyani, Tandoori Roti and Nalli Gosht. All of the items were finger licking good.

Personal Recommendation: 
Devilled Crab: Their signature dish. Crab meat served with Cheese in Crab Shell.
Nalli Gosht
Lobster Thermidor

Will visit again n again over the time.

One of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata with an ambiance well suited to its cultural heritage, Mocambo is definitely worth a try, not just for the ambiance, but for the food as well. I went with family so I had the opportunity to try different dishes and frankly, I was satisfied by all. The risotto with chicken liver was amazing. So was chicken a la Kiev. In my opinion, Fish a la Diana was scrumptious. The combination of fish and prawns would make any seafood lover happy. Service was good, the staff was courteous and food arrived timely. Highly recommended.

The ambience is very warm and cozy. The food was just amazing till date they have maintained their standards. We ordered for the famous prawn cocktail and it was simply yum. The only thing they need to improve on is the serving time. If not too much but yes serving is being delayed. Except for this portion, everything is amazing about this place. Folks you should go and chill out in this uber classy place.

Being under the same ownership as Peter Cat, Mocambo too, delivers on the expectations of it being a legendary eatery. Delicious food, great ambience and warm hospitality makes this restaurant one of the finest in the city. People often praise the Fish Muniere and the Chicken Tetrazzini they serve but I'd like to mention the Fish Sizzler and Chicken Orientale a la Mocambo too in my must have list. The sizzler is white sauce based and they put tender juicy mushrooms in it. The creaminess of the Chicken Orientale a la Mocambo will entice your taste buds and leave you craving for more.
P.S. If you want to skip the long queue at Peter Cat, this is the place to choose out of all the restaurants in Park Street.

One of the iconic places to visit in Park Street, this restaurant has been my first love for years.The ultimate haven for Continental food in Kolkata is undoubtedly 24 Park Street.From Steaks to Crepes to Risottos Mocambo whips it up in style.My staple has been the cheese corn salad to start with.Chicken Pavlograd(a cheesy version of Chicken a-la-kiev), Chicken Stroganoff and Chicken Paprika are my favorites here.Not to forget their Lasagne; the thrill of passing your fork through all the layers and finally savor the taste of molten cheese and meat; and the Chicken Tetrazzini;pasta and chicken in creamy sauce.The Chicken Steak with mushroom sauce is another dish which is highly recommended.Steak lovers try the Chicken Chipolata, served with sausages.A must try is the Chicken a-la-kiev; you should wait till the molten butter gushes out of the ostrich-egg shaped delicacy; I love that part(such a pretty sight).A personal favorite is the Chicken-au-gratin!And then when it's time for desserts try Baked Alaska(don't miss the blue colored fumes), Mocambo special souffle and the hot brownie with a dollop of vanilla ice-cream and molten chocolate syrup.Tango for the Tastebuds!
P.S Ambience, decor, music(10/10)

One of the oldest restaurants of Kolkata. Authentic continental food is served here. Despite all the negative publicity, we went for it  and ordered  devilled crab, prawn cocktail and chicken ala kiev. Prawn cocktail and chicken ala kiev was really good but didn't like the crab prep. Less crowded and ambiance was ok, but staffs were not that friendly. Also tried the baked alaska and it taste was good. Little overpriced in my opinion. Overall a ok restaurants in park street.

I have always been a fan of Peter Cat but not that much when it came to Mocambo but yes it is a heritage restaurant and thus it has its own charm

This review is just based on my last experience 

My order

Prawn cocktail 
Mulligatawny soup

Veg sizzler which my friend has asked for 

Prawn cocktail 
Tasted like rubbery old prawns which were kept in the freezer for couple of hours or even a night over and therefore served out 
The issue I believe is the way it was stored which completely annihilated the taste and freshness of the prawn  so was completely not what I expected 
When committing a sin of devouring fat it should at least be tasty 

Mulligatawny soup : 
Not too my liking , this is the first time I tasted this as on recommendation from my friend 

It was boiled thick lentil soup with rice and chicken pieces. Nope not what I would want to have in mocambo so it turned out to be quite a unexpected dinner for me 

The veg sizzler on the other hand tasted well
Yes sizzlers and veg that is a joke but yep It did Taste good and nothing great About it but was edible unlike the other two

So the name might be big but definitely not worth the visit 

Service was good... for the first time of the multiple times I have been here in my life  :)  

Recommend: nope when it comes to having these dishes being served to you. Other dishes on the menu, I can't comment on them but I'm sure it would be good.

If you're thinking about continental food then this place will be appropriate. Decoration is good, ambience is brilliant. Overall good fresh food, brilliant flavours blended all together, nice texture and brilliantly served! Management seems to be much more stronger than what I experienced when previously visited. If I say anything about cost, then its definitely reasonable. So, in conclusion, I can say that they're following Total Quality Management (TQM) and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) from all perspective though they've to work little more harder on these two for better result in the forthcoming days!

The amount of food delivered cannot even suffice one person and they take hell lot of time take to deliver that small morsel. if you order next, you are in for a surprise as you are bluntly denied for it would have taken another hour to deliver another small amount of the overhyped food.

Colonial continental at its best. Guess its the only restaurant in the world now which serves this kind of turn of the 19th century continental. Apparently they have got an innovation department. From what I have seen, all their innovation is directed towards infusing more and more things with cream and butter- not that we are complaining.
Anyways, coming to food. We have our standard order. Devilled crab- butter and cream mix of crab in crab shells, delightful. Fish Menuierre, my personal favourite. Prawn Cocktail, mind bogglingly sweet, but liked by my friend. There ends our starting list
In main course, we ordered irish steak in garlic butter sauce - yum yum, the garlic is just right; chicken pavlograd - looks like a cream bomb with a wick; and fish a la Diana - grilled fish stuffed with guess what, prawns & cream and butter.
Sometimes we have the baked Alaska, this time we didn't. All food as expected, outstandingly good.
The service has gone up by several notches; courtesy the past fiasco - all the better for us.

Mocambo is one of the oldest restaurants and one of my personal favourites. It offers a wide range of Italian, Continental and Indian dishes and you surely need to try all of these. My personal favourites are Chicken Ala Kiev, Chicken Corden Bleu, Chicken Tetrazzini. The Indian dishes have keema kulcha, different kinds of naan, buttery and thick butter chicken, paneer items and other North Indian dishes. The Sizzlers are the biggest attractions and I order them everytime I visit Mocambo. The Appetizers include items like Prawn cocktails and others which are well-presented. The deserts are also very innovative. The ambience provides a quiet and calm environment with nice decorated Chinese lanterns above your table. It's a spacious area and the staff attends everyone with equal attention. The service and ambience gets full marks from me. The food is top notch. Though pricey a bit, it retains its position as one of the most prestigious restaurants in the city and the food is worth the price. A must visit for every citizen of Kolkata.

I ordered a spinach and mashroom lasagne along with beer and a beaf dish(sorry dont remember its name). The beaf was good but the lasagne was not up to the mark. The sweetness in the lasagne ruined its taste.

However, the ambience was good and sophisticated.

But the service was quite slow.

The highlight of this joint is their continental spread. Food served was very fresh n quantity is also quite sufficient. But the waiters  are not at all hospitable.Really a old school kind of food joint.Just go for d food n don't expect good hospitality from the staff.

We all love food as children. But as we get older, we start to realise the nuances of a particular place that we didn't notice before. It's true that the food is not just about the ingredients, it's about the service and the ambience that comes with it. 

Mocambo has given me a similar experience over the years. As my favorite restaurant since childhood, it has given me the best of food memories one can have. But recently visiting the restaurant only results in dissapointment. Many will say the food is not what it was before. Well, the food is exactly as delicious as it was ten years ago. The only thing that brings the dish down are the intricate complexities that come with it. 

The unnecessary attitude of the waiters, thinking that it's a blessing for us to be served by them at mocambo, with the unexplained delay of a starter which takes up to 30 mins to come nowadays. The missing warmth that Mocambo had, was the key ingridient to all it's dishes. Sadly, it seems to be missing now. 

Ambience is as it was - the retro, vintaged, red-orange look, with a musty smell of roasted peanuts all around. 

Service has been drastically reduced to a point of hostility. 

However, the food remains so strong that even if someone gets ticked off by a waiter, it's immeditely forgotten if he or she has a spoonful of those mouthwater devilled crabs. 

Must Haves: 
Devilled Crab
Fish Florentine
Baked Hilsa (Seasonal - Monsoons)
Chicken Melanaise
Fish A-La Keiv

One of the best restaurant in town. I really like the way they have still uphold the heritage of kolkata. Very impressive decor and service. Now coming to the food, well I love their sizzlers. Recently i tried a bectki dish which is supposedly their heritage dish, . It was nice and cheesy. Would try the lobster thermidor soon.

I just have to say one word and it is AWESOME. Ambiance is bit like a fish market but it's gets over shadowed by the food. All thought it is known for its continental dishes but yes the fried rice and chilly fish was also up to the mark.

Visited on 30th December 2016 for Lunch; beer was served in normal glass for drinking water (completely out of standard for serving Beer in any professionally managed eateries) instead of Macombo's traditional beer mugs; on complaining for same the manager said that all such mugs are occupied and argues that they do not manufacture mugs (very unexpected argument)!!!......this goes absolutely against the stature and class of restaurant like Mocambo!!! Even though the food is good, service plays important part which now a days they even don't care for. Would not recommend.

The age old legendary restaurant beautifying Park Street with its everlasting waiting queue outside 365 days. A must visit for all visiting kolkata. Some of the must try dishes would be devilled crab, fish florentine, bhetki muniere, chicken ala kiev, meat lasagne, angel on horses back and many more..... sizzlers and dessert including baked alaska are their speciality as well. Rated 4.5 for maintaining the elegance till date. Rest 0.5 can be achieved with a little care on the building renovation, clean outfits for the waiters, new clean carpets and temperature control ACs. However the taste and elegance of each plater can make you forget all these nominal drawbacks.

If you go and have food here you'll be like "Mocambo ne muje khush kiaa" , very cordial staff, cream crowd, beautiful interior ! Cocktails are nice and food as well ! Presentation of the food is good and the taste too be it vegetarian or non-vegetarian! Keep doing good Mocambo 😊

This place is a prize winner. Be it the ambience, be it the food, be it courteousness. Well the first time I visited this place with my friend I was bowled over by the ambience. And why not. this is one of the most famous places in Kolkata. The chairs were cozy and very comfortable. Each chair had a separate lamp which secluded each table from the other.

Now let's talk about the food. I had the Beckty Bell Meuniere and Fish A La Moutarde. Both were delicious. Especially the Beckty Bell Meuniere. This place is also famous for its continental dishes. One should taste the Devilled Crab because I doubt if you can get it anywhere in Kolkata.

Last but not the least - the waiters - they were very courteous and had patience which was the key ingredient to the great ambience of such a place. The place was clean and tidy also. The lavatories are just ok.

The price range is on the higher side. But I would compromise that for the quality of food I got. Unique!

So I would conclude by saying that you would definitely miss a good place for your taste buds if you miss Mocambo.

Legendary place which got bashed up recently. Went there on a treat from my wife on her Birthday. Started with Devilled Crab which was heavenly. Other items ordered by our group were Chicken Chipolata, Chicken Steak Sizzler, Bekti Bell Munierre, Chicken Imperial & Chicken A La Mocambo. Among these, Bekti Munierre, Chicken Chipolata & Chicken Imperial were awesome. Will surely go back more & more.

Great ambience Greater food... Good service... After that incident most probably... Alcohol is affordable that is what matters... But if you wanna have a full course starting from soup, starter, alcohol, main course and dessert you can no way manage it within a 1000-1200 for cost of 2...a pocket pinch of 3k to 3.5k for 2 is required for a full course satisfying meal... If you visit this place try and have the best dishes with as much as weird name as possible... Try the tuna in mayo... Try the crab pulp cocktail... Try the crab meat soup... In main course try surf n turf it has beef and prawns... You may order it as sizzler or without it... In dessert ofcourse don't miss out baked alaska and the brownie ice cream... Overall it was a good experience... I would like to advice you may accompany your meal with either vodka or whiskey(Indian preferably) ... Don't have beer it'll spoil your experience with food...

Five friends went on a dinner. The place is too crowded on a Saturday thou we got a seat since we went early. We ordered pork cutlets which were delicious. Later on we ordered sizzlers & steaks, it was not so good taste. Would not recommend it. Since the amount of Bill paid the food is not worth satisfaction to your taste buds.

Well nw what to call this?
I faced a bad experience yesterday on Christmas eve 24.12.16. Me n my frnd was standing in d queue of two ppl's table after listing names fr more than a hr since 6.50 pm. At 8pm we were d 2nd couple to enter. Before us there were an elderly couple. At 8pm a white lady along with her one female frnd came. The person writing names gave them an estimate of 1hr+ waiting. The two ladies wrote the name n was standing there too. Meanwhile let me tell u they were far behind in d list of two ppl as in ds one hr many couple's/two frnds hv written their names too before thm. After a minute or so a person frm inside came n was abt to cal the name next in d list. Pronuncing half midway he stopped when he saw d white lady n her frn n called thm instead. Whn protested they lied. Same old story. Mocambo doesnt take reservations. Now wht u call ds? Racist nah?

Was thinking of visiting this place for a long time now. Atlast todays christmas eve stroll along park street made it possible. It was packed up as usual. The lower staff starting from the doorman to the waiters were more courteous than the head waiters. The head waiter had the attitude like they were doing their job as they have to.

The ambiance is like one of those 1960s kind of ppsh restuarants. Gives one a good cozy feel.

Coming to the food, this is one place in the city where certain rare dishes happen to be available. The devil crab is one of the dishes i tried and i LOVED it.  Starting from the presentation to the taste, it was great . The second on the platter was the chicken cordon blieu. This was a bit so so on the taste. I would say i have tasted similar things which are better in taste. The chicken ala kiev in olypub is a better alternative. The third item was the desert, in which comprised of Baked Alaska, which again was fabulous. The most awesome thing apart of the taste was its presentation, when it came it was literally still lit on fire. And not forget the whiskey sour was on the drinks, it was also really good.

This is one of the oldest and well known restaurants in the Park Street area of Kolkata...Well,let me tell you that this place is no muck and you can easily concur with this if you just go through their catalogue of dishes...They serve dishes , you might not find elsewhere in Kolkata and to be honest I was alien to more than half the dishes on the menu...I did my waiting and finally went there yesterday with my girl and with a trumpetting stomach, a drooling tongue and sky high expectations..In the end , was left pretty disappointed and this is because of many reasons...
Firstly,the overall seating area is very limited for a restaurant of such repute and stature..Secondly,the seating arrangement did not go down well with me...I could not even fit in my legs within the gap between the chair stands..How can one enjoy the food if he is not enjoying seating there ?
Coming to the food, we had ordered one of their signature dishes, the chicken ala keiv...It did not taste half as good as it seemed , when we went through the description in the menu.. It was served with boiled potatoes (which were really tasty) ,macaroni and boiled carrots plus peas which were tolerable....The outer coating of the Ala Kiev was the most disappointing and tasted no different from the bread pakoda crusts you would find on any roadside shops....The butter filling tasted good but was too much in quantity to do your appetite or you health any good...The chicken fillet was really good though both in taste and quantity..
The only thing that seemed somewhat appreciable was the service..the staffs seem to do their routine job well..Prices are on the higher side as expected...I would obviously recommend this restaurant owing to the uniqueness of what they serve and might also visit again someday, but I cannot give them more than 2 for what I experienced yesterday...An additional 0.5 for the diverse and unique menu...

This place has been a favourite since my school days. Even though it's almost been a decade of moving out of Cal, this place would always be a part of the Calcutta I know. It's the place which one can go have a good lunch or dinner no matter what the occasion- with family, friends, colleagues or with a loved one. True that the waiting in line to get a table, and once you get a table waiting for the food is more than what one would prefer, but that being said they still make a few dishes better than any other place I've known. My favourites still remain the prawn cocktail, the devilled crab and the lobster thermidor. I've always ended a meal here with their tutty frutty. In fact I was there 2 weeks back and the experience still warms my soul- there's just something else going to Park Street on a December night for a dinner to this place. The food was great as always (I'm ignoring the waiting for a table/waiting for the food part). Unfortunately the Mutton Peshawari and the Tutty frutty was not as great as what I remember from the time before, but the other dishes totally made up for it.

Though I planned the late lunch at Tung Fong but ended up with Mocambo as Tung fong was closed. It turned out to be a nice experience. The ambiance is very cozy and sophisticated. We ordered Chicken Milanaise & Meat lasagne, both were baked items and were served in the baking bowl. Taste was good though it needs improvement it terms of continental taste. This place would be in my list for a second visit for the ambiance and the different kind of menu.

Had an awesome time with one of my besties (almost felt like a date) ! We ordered screwdriver, bloody Mary and chicken siciliene. Food was average but was totally bowled over by the ambience! So perfect for a romantic date! Will definitely visit next time with a special someone ;-)

For a few minutes let us keep aside what they did on the day of the incident and think of it as a normal restaurant and forget the restaurant. Don’t get me wrong, I am not saying what they did was right but that is known to all of us, let’s think about the other things. First of all the decoration of the place gives you a royal feeling and you feel as if you have gone a few years back in time of the British Era. The one true essence of the Park Street Area is well maintained in here. The place seems deserted after the incident. You rarely find people sitting here now specially after the ratings for the restaurant

Last night me and my parents went to this heritage restaurant of Kolkata: Mocambo. Last time when I visited the place I was maybe 5yrs old but still had a faint bt happy memory :) it was time to rejuvenate that feeling. The interiors were the same and had a old world charm which felt nice. The reddish hue of the place gives you warmth much like how it feels to live in the city of Kolkata. We had ordered Peshwari mutton, a fish starter (name i forgot) and usual drinks. Both the starters were equally good, well marinated and well cooked specially the Peshwari mutton, making us repeat the dish 😅. Then we order the Risotto Di Scampi and Chicken Pavlograd. Both these dishes were unique. The risotto was cooked with crabmeat and prawn which tasted beautiful. The chicken pavlograd was a better version of Chicken Alakeiv..I love alakeiv and evidently i loved this more! 😁 Overall it was a good experience for all of us. Only con was it took a long time to serve the dishes but the taste of the dishes made us forget that. The heritage restaurant has still maintained its position  among all the old and new and surely the upcoming restaurants in Kolkata.

One of the oldest, respected and heritage restaurant in park Street area. Its mainly famous for its continental cuisine. Nice Ambience, prompt service, good decor and delicious food without burning a hole in pocket is some of the reasons to make it a standalone restaurant in kolkata inspite of some bizzare incident happened recently. 
I had been there numerous times. Will try again in future.
Last time I gave a treat to my cousins and friends. We had a wonderful gala time there. 

We had pork cutlet stuffed with ham and cheese served with pasta and vegetables, ham steak king sizzler, surf and turf sizzler which was a mix of prawn and mutton, fish Florentine the cheesy awesomeness - bhetki steak baked with cheese, chicken paprika -  served with rice, macaroni, white sauce based chicken, chicken chipolata which was full of sausage bacon chicken breast and saute vegetables.

Out of all those, pork cutlet, chicken chipolata and fish Florentine was something great.

Final Biased verdict - 4/5

Food - 4/5
Value for money - 4.5/5
Service - 3.5/5
Ambience - 4/5

Word for management, we have a lot of good memories and sentiments with mocambo. Please try to maintain that legacy. It need some upbringing to cope up with the changes and other issues. All the best.

Visited there after a long time on Sunday evening and to my surprise it was quite deserted.
You wouldn't find any good beer or cocktail in their menu. The vodka based cocktails are in a base of white mischief. They don't have any better brand.
Coming to food the taste of the food was obviously good but portion was less. The serving tray is so cheap even in our home we serve in better tray.
All I felt it has lost it's old glory.

After a long wait in the queue trying to get a table at Mocambo, we finally reached early one fine day and grabbed a table for 4. It was with few office colleagues. I had heard about this place from a lot of my friends & peers so couldn't wait to be here. The behavior of the staff was pretty good but as it was too crowded that day, so it was tough getting hold of someone easily. Chicken A La Kiev is one name that comes to my mind every time I visit here and my gosh, this one is enough to feed one empty stomach .A thick fillet of chicken breast, is hand pounded till flat and then stuffed with a slab of frozen butter. This beautiful thing is then crumb coated and deep fried to perfection. This was as tasty as it sounds. The moment you cut into the cutlet, butter gushes out with its utmost elegance. Simply enjoyed this... The Cocktail that I experienced there was Bloody Mary and it was not what I expected upto the standards. The actual taste was missing and the effect of Vodka was missing to some extent. Overall had a pretty good dining experience. But not pleased with service of the staff.

Good ambiance.. Though I'm not an ardent fan of Continental cuisines, tried Chicken Ala kiev and  a few other dishes with some queer names..... However, i will not be stepping into this restaurant anymore due to the managements' cheap mentality where a Richie Rich is given a warm welcome and an average class, hard working person is denied entry...... Not my cup of tea

I simply love Mocambo because undoubtedly it is one of the best place for continental food! Have been there a number of times and each time this restaurant has made my happy! 
We ordered tandoori fish and chicken siciliene as starter. Both the dishes were well cooked. The chicken starter was really creamy and yum! For the main course we ordered fish steak both sizzling and non-sizzling, fish wellington and chicken orientale a la Mocambo. All these dishes were amazing; tasty and of good quality and quantity. One who likes continental food will surely love these. N finally for dessert we ordered orange souffle which was a cherry on the cake! It had right amount of all the flavours and tasted brilliant. Il really suggest this dessert.  
Both the service and ambience was good. Overall a great experience! 

Ps. Il surely continue visiting this place.

It's surprising I haven't written this place a review yet. Been here a thousand times I guess and I just love Mocambo.
They are the best in continental for sure. What have I not had here yet.
Let me mention the unmissable ones so it might help any newbie over here!
For starters don't miss the Heritage devilled crabs but I recently tried the Pepper devilled crab and yes it is very spicy so order at ur own risk but I loved it. Highly recommended.
For mains have anything! Chicken tetrazzini, meat lasagna, fish florentine, bekty bell muniere, chicken ala kiev, chicken pavlogard, chicken steak, risotto di scampi a few I can remember at a go.
For dessert don't miss their meringue with vanilla icecream and chocolate sauce. The souffle and baked alaska are good as well.

Lobster Thermidor, Crabmeat Cocktail and Orange Souffle were excellent. Can't say the same about the other dishes. Ambiance is good. Pricing is a bit on the upper side. Overall food quality for most dishes need improvement.

[WARNING : This review is going to be pretty long. Procced at your own risk.😅]

After multiple failures of trying to get a table at Mocambo, we finally reached early one fine day and grabbed a table for 4 after waiting for 10 minutes in the queue, on 17th April 2016.

I have read some overwhelming reviews on Zomato and hence I couldn't wait for the food experience to begin.
It was a Sunday and obviously every stuff member was running from one corner to the other but, we were not neglected and they were prompt enough to make sure that the food reached our table on time.

Coming to what we had and how we felt about it :
1) Devilled Crab @Rs.306.00, (4/5): [Sufficient for 2] A beautifully smooth and stupendous crabmeat mixture was stuffed in a crab shell and then baked with cheese on top. Each bite was something to look forward to. Crabmeat was not compromised on and the taste of the delicate crabmeat was well maintained.

2)Tuna Fish Dip @Rs.253.00 (4/5) : [Sufficient for 3, as an entrée] I have had bad experiences with canned tuna in the past, so I was a bit apprehensive when it came to ordering this dish but I tried to brave for once😂😝. What we got was nowhere near to how disgusting I thought it would be.
Well cooked tuna meat mixed with cheese and cream (obviously!) because cheese and cream makes everything better. 😍 Came with 6 mini squares of garlic toasts.

3)Chicken A La Kiev @Rs.339.00 (4/5) : [More than sufficient for 1] We couldn't go to Mocambo and not order the mighty Chicken A La Kiev. A thick fillet of chicken breast, is hand pounded till flat and then stuffed with a slab of frozen butter. This beautiful thing is then crumb coated and deep fried to perfection. Doesn't the description higher your adrenaline level, already? This was as tasty as it sounds. The moment you cut into the cutlet, butter gushes out with its utmost elegance. Loved it!

4)Chicken Mocambo @Rs.247.00 (0.5/5) : [Sufficient for 1] The description in the menucard sounded too good and this being a signature dish of Mocambo, my brother decided to order it. What came in was appealing to the eyes but disgusting to the taste buds. Watery, uncooked tomatoey soupy gravy, with unseasoned rice and tasteless chicken at the base accompanied by some absurdly cut stone cold boiled egg. My brother was on the verge of throwing up and it was the same with me. We somehow gulped it down as we don't believe in wasting food. Pretty bad experience with this one.

5)Fish A La Moutarde @Rs.375.00 (4.2/5) : [Sufficient for 1] I love fish (obviously😂) and fish is something I am always curious about the way it is cooked, when I come to any restaurant that is not chinese or mughlai. We were served 2 fillets of well cooked, flaky fish cooked in a mustard sauce with the pungency of mustard inatact. It was served with Saffron Rice (3.5/5), Roasted potatoes (4/5), Cold pasta salad (3.5/5) and the usual boiled carrot sticks + grean peas.

6)Pork Cutlet @Rs.364.00 (2/5) : [Sufficient for 1] The moment the plate came to our table, our eyes popped out seeing the humongous cutlet - almost like a side pillow (Kolbaalish). The cutlet was fried impeccably. But something was gravely wrong with the inner portion. The meat was not smelling quite right. We figured out that It was to some exteng raw and hence the smell. Not eating pork ever again at Mocambo.

7)Tandoori Mixed Grill @Rs.330.00 (4.25/5) : [Sufficient for 1] Components of the tandoori platter were : 1 piece of tandoori chicken, 1 mutton seekh kebab, 2 pieces of tandoori prawn, tandoored shallots and half a piece of egg bhuna. The flavours were flawless!

8)Tandoori Roti @Rs.41.00 (3.5/5) : Crisp and well tandoored roti.

9) Cream Caramel @Rs.128.00 (3.35/5) : We obviously wanted to order baked alaska but because of time issues, we just went for cream caramel. I have had better. The caramel lacked the slightly burnt flavour which is required in every caramel pudding/custard.

We also ordered 2 portions of garlic toast (Rs.32.00/plate) to go with the main course.
The bill came upto Rs.3133.00 [Rs.2604.00 + Rs.151.00 (5.8% Service charge) + Rs.377.58 (14.5% Vat)].

Recommended. (For some selective dishes only.)✌🏻
Happy eating.😁😁

The place may have received a lot of flak, bad reviews and negative attention recently, but it still doesn't change our experience here. 

We adored a few dishes, and a few were a miss, but overall we would still rate this quite a pleasant experience. 

We had the crab meat soup- which was creamy and delicious and the portion was pretty decent too. 

Their signature dish- the devilled crabs were the best thing on the menu and the presentation was pretty interesting too. Like the menu says, it really is an excellent starter.

For main course we had- Chicken A La Kiev- this was not what we expected! This was half a chicken l, deep fried. But the insides were like boiled chicken- hardly any salt or flavour in it. This was a little disappointing, especially because four of us were struggling to finish it. 

The next was the Fish A La Diana- and this is what you call a creamy delight. Prawns and Bhetki's beautiful union and melt in the mouth consistency. I could have another plate, please! 

Last but not the least- Tuna crepes- they sound like a light dish but the cheese says otherwise. 

I can say, this place really does serve some good dishes and I would love to come here again!

Mocambo continues to be a great eating-out experience. But this time I want to focus on one particular aspect.  Elegance in dining is a huge value with us. Right from the setting of the table to serving the after-meal coffee. Usually we opt for the crepe dessert, but this time we decided on coffee and I was very happy to see the way we were served our coffee. The coffee cups were placed just right and the coffee service was reminiscent of old world charm and grace. Again proved my point that it is not only the food that has to be good, but the whole experience has to be gracious and elegant. Thank you Mocambo! (I tried to put in a picture but couldn't - never mind, next time you go to Mocambo, order the coffee!!)

I went their last week, Monday evening to celebrate my wife's birthday. But somehow wasn't quite satisfied , the service was slow , the foods were bland in taste, we ordered some pretty regular dishes like sizzlers and chicken alakiev but some how didn't get the old feel that we used to get from this place, either they have gone wrong or now there are better places to eat which have changed our taste buds.

And God said... Let there be Conti....thus Mocambo was born. Thats how I felt when I celebrated Mom's birthday today at lunch. Superb conti food viz. "Chicken Meuniere" it was so yummilicious that I would visit again for this. The "Fried Fish" was full of elegance and the heavenly aroma ruled all over the place. Before going I was a bit curious about "Angels on Horse Back" & "Chicken Chipolata" but Bingo.... I was absolutely correct on my imagination, a lovely meat lovers platter to savour. The traditional Chicken Steak as a Sizzler was like the old wine in a new bottle just can't get better. A cozy ambience with quick and smiling service made my day memorable. One thing that they need to improve is the crumbled table linen which was not certainly the Mocambo way...

Some of us like it, some of us hate it, but none of us can deny the a-one quality of the food served here.
Mocambo is your go-to continental cuisine restaurant when you're up in the food street of Calcutta.
Besides their Devilled Crab and Paprika Chicken, the restaurant also sells a lot of other tasty food items.
One of them would be Chicken Sausage Cocktail. Comes in six pieces- smothered in sauce made from scratch. This is served with shredded potato fries and ketchup.
Next is their Chicken Chipolata. You can go for their sizzler one or their regular one. There is a big chicken breast that comes with a pile of sausages and bacon. What is more interesting in this platter is the smoky cabbages shredded to one side. It tastes heavenly. Breaking down the other elements of the dish, we have carrots, peas, potatoes, roasted tomato and other regular sizzler things.
Service was fine. The waiter attending our table really took care of all our needs from insisting on taking pictures of us and our food to making small conversations. Food was served on time. Looking forward to visiting Mocambo again!

Recently , Mocambo was all over Facebook for all wrong reasons. I came here for a lunch with my bestie. Keeping all the heard negative things away, I will give my views based on the food, ambience and behavior of the staff that I experienced that day.
Ambience is really beautiful..cozy and calm..the dim lighting adds that extra charm.
Well , coming to the food...one word - Heavenly... we ordered some lobster dish which was not in the menu card and also ordered Chicken Supreme. The behavior of the staff was very good, they were polite and courteous. I would highly recommend Mocambo

Ever since my childhood I loved the chicken stake of Mocambo. Now I stay outside Kolkata but whenever I visit my hometown I make sure to dine at Mocambo at least one time. Out of so many delicious goodness I would like to highlight few of my Favourite dishes. Fish a la diana : this is an awesome combination of fish stuffed with prawn cooked in delicious cream sauce, chicken steak with mushroom sauce sizzler : I just love the juicy chicken which the veggies, Devilled Crab: crabmeat with cheese mix is just perfect for those special dinner menu. The service is very good and the ambience is calm and soothing.

They create scenes on their doors. Make their customers wait outside even if the seats are empty. We went there inspite of the bad reviews but no their staff are really ill mannered. They behave like they are the only good restaurant in Kolkata. The sophistication they aim to create is hollow. Very unprofessional behavior inspite  of the outrage social media showed for their discrimination. Won't recommend anyone to go there

After that shocking incident I must say they didn't changed much.Yesterday I visit Mocambo.It was supposed to be a romantic dinner date but thanks to them they spoiled the whole evening..We ordered drinks & some foods.but I was shocked when I found a mosquito floating on fresh lime soda....
However they replaced it but it's really embarrassing.No one excepts such things in a place like Mocambo..

As a food reviewer, I would like to keep my views aside on the incident and focus on what's important, the food, so here goes.

Mocambo is a place which seems centuries old to Calcutta, I've been here on multiple evenings and had always had to wait to get a seat inside this restaurant thanks to the crowd, so, a change of strategy saw me visiting here for lunch and voila, got a seat. The managers were courteous and so was the staff, coming to food, we ordered:

Chicken a la kiev - This was just amazing, first of, the piece was huge! And as soon as we put the knife to cut it, butter just burst out of it, the crispiness was perfect and wasn't burnt, just how it should be! 

Pork Steak - We ordered for the pork steak and it was amazing, the right amount of fatty and the glaze on the steak was amazing

Meringue with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce - The perfect dessert to end the meal with, just amazing, I cannot explain this one, you must experience it.

Overall great service and great food just that on some days you might have to wait.  

For photos of places where I eat in Calcutta or other cities, follow me on Instagram. (Same name in both places)

P.S. My rating is PURELY based on the food and service I personally received.

One of the best restaurants in the town. Keeping aside the management team's attitude and all let's focus on the food. Mocambo serves absolutely delicious continental food right on the heart of Kolkata. Fish a ala diana, fish florentine , chicken cordon bleu, prawn cocktail, fish fingers, prawn thermidor, chicken pavlograd, surf and turf, baked alaska, meringue with vanilla ice cream are absolutely heavenly and so very satisfying. Love their food.

When you get to Park Street,this is the place for awesome food :)Calm and divine aura inside.Haven't had better food than this.
Angels on Horseback,risotto,beef steak,meat lasagne and the meringue tasted awesome with the hot chocolate.Every dish is complete in itself,served with little amount of pasta fresh veggies butter and garlic.
Just don't see the ratings.This has gone down due to some inappropriate posts.This place is undoubtedly one of the best in the cities.
They serve the best Beef steak in Kolkata..
Chicken supreme is a cheesy blend of tender chicken and ham..
Interiors are so soothing.. the entire time out there seemed to be some fleeting glimpses.
An out of the world exper
experience.

I wanted to give it a try because life is too short to hold the grudges and to err is human.  After we went there the waiters were courteous but the manager taking the order was not,let's say he was cool. I was trying not to be too judgemental about this restaurant but I had to put a scrutiny into that. I can't live without their signature "Chateaubriand dish" for too long which I have been eating for ages since my childhood. Chateaubriand steak  is a meat dish cooked with a thick cut from the tenderloin filet. In contemporary times, chateaubriand cuts of beef refer to "a large steak cut from the thickest part of a fillet of beef'', trust me its beautiful and Mocambo do the real jusctice to the honest foodies when it comes to this particular steak. They serve it with a Chateaubriand sauce which  is a culinary sauce that is typically served with red meat.It is also sometimes referred to as "crapaudine sauce".It is prepared in a series of reductions, and typically accompanies chateaubriand steak.On starters we had a beautiful veg cheese spring roll which was another mouth melting dish.I was quite dissapointed by the Indian section food. The Keema Nan was okay, but really not upto the mark, and chicken bharta ordered by the other person accompanying me was too oily and not really blissful. Above all, I think they are trying to modify them after the recent controversy that has happened but they still little more to go..

My first visit to this legendary fine dining restaurant located at the heart of the city happened today and I can doubtlessly say that I had one of my best lunches ever. Me and my friend were welcomed very humbly by the attendants and the warm, classy ambience of the place was an instant mood lifter. From the overhead hanging lamp to the divine artwork carved on the walls, every feature the place has on offer augments the richness of the atmosphere. The staff team was very cordial and approachable  in my opinion, making recommendations and catering to us during our stint of lunch. 

The decision to choose something from among a plethora of quality dishes was a very difficult one. I was looking for a non-seafood appetizer and despite having a number of soups to choose from, I wasn't too insistent on it. I must admit I expected more options in the appetizer section since i'm more of a meat person, but owing to my experimental nature when it comes to food, I decided to order a Devilled Crabmeat. The presentation was beautiful, the meat being stuffed inside the shell of the crab, expertly prepared with mushrooms. A light yet delightful appetizer. 
In the mains, my friend ordered Paprika Chicken, a tangy and cheesy delight served with veggies and a bed of rice. I ordered the classic Chateaubriand Beef Steak served with pasta and veggies with the choice of a sauce. Hands down, it's the best steak I've ever had. I cherished every bite of the filling steak and the pepper sauce only exalted the rich taste of it. 

Each dish that we ordered are rightly priced, given their succulent taste and delightful presentation. Service was very prompt. The place by no means is overrated and there was barely any room for remonstrance. 
Very few restaurants have the ability to furnish an experience like this and this place sets the perfect example of consolidation of legacy. Now I know the reason behind Mocambo's legendary status.

This is arguably the most famous restaurant in Kolkata. Ask anyone, "Hey, Brother. Where can I go for some fine dining in Kolkata?" Nine out of ten people will refer you to Mocambo. And actually, this immense popularity is not without a justified reason. It has a history of serving great food to its patrons. That's why once people come here, they always return to its palpable nostalgia. Mocambo is and will remain Kolkata's most cherished restaurant. 

I had ordered a Chicken Cordon Bleu, Chicken Chipolata, and a Meringue with Vanilla ice-cream and hot chocolate sauce. Every food item lived up to its expectation. I especially loved the Cordon bleu. The different herbs used made it a treat for my taste buds while the stuffing with cheese added a certain richness. The Chipolata was also up there, right at the very top competing with the Cordon Bleu for supremacy. The Meringue, however, was what I'd call average. For some reason, it just didn't appeal to me. 

The ambience inside is kind of bohemian. Very appealing to look at. There is a general notion that service in Mocambo is not very friendly. I won't debunk that. I found the service slow, and the servers possibly bored. It isn't very expensive neither is it damn cheap. In a nutshell, it is a fine place for fine dining.

I was expecting to enter a fine dining restaurant and that expectation wasn't met. The food was so-so but I really must tell you about the dessert. I called for the baked alaska and it was so bad that I don't even want to know what a well-made one tastes like. The waiter apologised privately; said it was a popularly bad dessert.

Mocambo, located at the heart of Park Street, has been a very old restaurant known for continental food and even today it does justice to it's reputation.
Behaviour of the attendants are pleasant and also have sound knowledge about the items.
Coming to it's strength-the food here is highly delicious and value for money. Some of the items that deserve mention are devilled crab meat and nalli gosht for which I can visit this place unlimited times. 
Ambience of the place is attractive with hanging lights on top of every table and every table well spaced and arranged.
Definitely worth more than a visit

This place has been in the news for the wrong reasons recently. Amidst all the fury I would like my Zomato review to be strictly on the food and the restaurant ambience of my experience. 

Mocambo is a very famous restaurant and one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata. The while ambience inside the restaurant will take you back in time. The place definitely has its own charm. 

When you visit the restaurant be sure to try out the sizzlers and the continental dishes. They are famous for it.

The famous dishes out here are the Devilled crab and the chicken ah la Kiev to name a few. Chicken chipotle is also very good.
The service was quite quick and efficient. They were very cordial too..

Loved the food and the ambience at the restaurant.Don't know why it is rated so low on Zomato.The servers were friendly and even the guard who opened the door was so warm.Even while we were discussing on what to order,they didn't seem irritated since we took a long time to decide.We ordered Devilled Crab,Chicken a la Kiev and Baked Alaska.Loved the presentation of all these three dishes.The Crab was the one I loved the most though I thought Baked Alaska could be made in a better way since it was too sweet for me.Overall its a nice place to dine where I celebrated my birthday,and I think deserves a much higher rating.We have to keep our heritage alive.

Now-a-days, lots of talking regarding Mocambo make their business down.In my view,there may be some rules of a restaurant but that should not hurt the humanity.Lets go for the review.

Mocambo is in my long-awaited desire lists and finally my wait was over.The ambience of this place is classic and makes you feel calm & cool.The attendants are well dressed and serves nicely.

Now,the food--yeah,the main attraction.We ordered chicken paprika- the famous one,chicken a la kiev-the yummy one,angles on horseback-the sexy one.Chicken paprika-the platter is adorned with yummy chicken,smelled rice,well cooked potatoes & pasta,green peas and carrot.Chicken a la kiev-a well stuffed(chicken) coat makes you mad.Angles on horseback-again a toothsome chicken is beautifully served with rice,baked potatoes,pasta,green peas and carrot.
 
At last,I ordered one sweet dish-brownie with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate,it was also awesome.

Ambience-4/5
Foods-4/5
Staff-3.7/5

Thank you

This place is recommended for continental food.personal favourites are fish ala Diana and devil crabmeat.a disappointing factor was that though the devil crabmeat mentioned having mustard in it,bt it was lacking when we had it and it was more shocking when the waiter/attendee instead of replacing it, denied it completely.so guys plz verify what they mention is atleast served.

Did not like the devil crab and the chicken mocambo in asparagus and mushroom. It tasted he'll bad. My partner and I are foodies and we ran as fast as possible post realising the mistake. Later we settled for road side ice-creams which was much better in quality and quantity. Mocambo should realise that their era is gone and do something at this time to keep on their restaurant business

Went with my parents and cousins the place is usually crowded and noisy we ordered fish steak , tomato soup with cream , chicken steak , butter naan , chicken bharta , caramel custard. The food was good. I had ordered some as parcel where i told them to pack in foil as the white sauce is soaked by the paper itself they said they would but after i reached home i found the same old way of packing. Not only this time when ever we go we ask to pack in foil and every time they say they will but they never do. The service staff behaviour is also very bad the wull walk and talk to you will full attitude, they act as if they are serving food and doing a great deed.and the MOST ANNOYING THING THAT I FOUND WAS A STAFF WAS STARTING AT US LIKE HE HAS NEVER SEEN PEOPLE .i hate the experience. If i have to go there again then i might think a thousand times before going.

Visited after a very long time, two years almost. Well, never did like the service previously as well. The waiters were rude very often, however the food used to be great. For the fist time ever we did not have to stand in a queue, which is a positive, however the food quality has deteriorated hugely. We had ordered beef steak in with mushroom sauce and chicken a la Keiv. The a la Keiv did taste good however the butter filled in the chicken breast wasn't unsalted, as it is supposed to be. We wanted a medium rare steak however it was more than well cooked, a bit on the overcooked side. The baked alaska was nice and fluffy, nothing extraordinary though.

The only option for wine available was Sula, and we had to buy it by bottle. However the waiter did not allow us to take the bottle home, as we couldn't finish even half if it. I mean, what's the point? If we can get the unfinished food parceled, why not the wine. We have bought it, so it's up to us whether we leave it or take it. More importantly, why did they not inform us beforehand that we have to finish it, while insisting us to buy the wine by bottle.

Utterly disgusting customer services and below average food.

Devil Crab one of my favourite dishes amonst many others in this authentic continental fine dine is always yummylicious. Inspite of the recent incident I did not find anything bad on their part on welcoming the customers on my recent visit. The newly extended space gives you the same elite feeling once you step in.

Though I've been here innumerable times, couldn't make time to review it. As we all know, Mocambo is a legendary restaurant and part of Kolkata's heritage and "to visit" list.  The ambiance is perfect for corporate dinners or lunches or maybe a family outing. The dim lighting creates a good atmosphere. The food is no doubt very good. My personal favourite is the chicken chipolata. Mocambo is a steak lover's paradise. I've also tried the devilled crab, which was creamed to perfection. The fish steak is simpe, but flavourful. The quality and quantity of food is very good. There is just one point to note. There has been a recent upheaval about this place and not all of it is false. They do need to improve on their service. The waiters are not very helpful and have an air about them. There are no complaints about the food and ambiance, but the service could be a bit better.

I never wanted to set a foot here after the incident of the driver,but ended up there on the insistence of my friends on ashtami for lunch. Well the waiters and staffs proved no less arrogant than before. They got annoyed when we were taking time to order. I mean they are just waiters who gets paid to serve us, they should be concerned with the customer satisfaction, but where do they get so much attitude from?
Coming to the food.. it wasn't great either.... only the starters - tandoori chicken and some fried prawns were nice.
The sizzlers were tasteless.
NOT RECOMMENDED! EVER!
mostly because of the behavior of the staff.

Mocambo was and is our first choice in Park Street. Whenever my husband and I feel confused about a restaurant choice at park Street, we always make Park street, the choice of the day. I do not have any first hand bad experience with Mocambo. I do not know the truth and I do not believe something based on any random post. So, I will review the food, ambience and the service Mocambo provides rather than speculating the 'Chinese whisper game'.

On Durga Puja 2016- Oshtomi, we went to Mocambo along with our 3 friends to  have dinner. To my surprise, We did not have to wait and this happened for the first time. We got a table near to the main door. I do not mind this sitting arrangement as I did not want the privacy, we wanted to have some good food and fun. Eventually, it helped us to remember our college days. Even, we took the water ourselves from it's stand which was just beside our table. It was fun and we made comedy out of it. Yes, of course, if it was a romantic kind of dinner then I would seriously get irritated. The waiters were having smiling faces which was a good sign to improve. 

Our order :
1. Prawn Cocktail - I seriously do not indulge myself to have a mayonnaise based dish. So, personally, I did not like it. For me, it was very sour. For a friend of mine, it was her favorite. So, I shall go with her taste. She liked the Prawn Cocktail.
2. Chicken Paprika - It was good. 
3. Chicken Orientale Ala Mocambo - I found this dish over powered by the rice. Chicken portion was on lesser side. It tasted good. But, I would have been very happy if I could have some more chicken.
4. Chicken Chipolata (Sizzler) - This was was really tasty and good. The sausage, bacons, chicken were complimenting each other. A must have dish.
5. Devilled Crab- This one was the show-stealer.  It was too tasty. Another must have dish here.

After having these many things, we could not stop ourselves to have the dessert.
6. Brownie with Vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce - Tasty. But I would suggest not to eat this one alone. After having 2-3 bites, it becomes too sweet. With some sharing partners,  it is a super dessert.
7. Cold Everest- This one is actually a 'cream' version of Baked Alaska. Ice-cream+fruit+cake covered with heavy cream topped with walnuts. It was tasty and a very good dessert.
8. Baked Alaska - It used to be the favorite dessert in Mocambo until this day. They used 10 ml brandy instead of 50 ml brandy and burnt it. The meringue was so burnt that from every side, it tasted bitter. When we told this to the waiter, he said that they serve it in this way. But, it is not the truth. We had Baked Alaska in Mocambo at least 5-6 times, but it never tasted so bitter. Anyway, they happily agreed to replace it. As a replacement, we ordered;
9. Crepes with Chocolate Sauce - Vanilla Ice cream wrapped in a Crepe was topped with chocolate sauce and walnuts. The replacement paid off. It was super tasty and I would recommend this dessert from Mocambo.

Finally, the ambiance was good as always.  I found that the service had been improved compared to the previous times. The recent incident may take some credit for this, I guess. 
Overall, it was not  the best experience at Mocambo, but also, it was not bad at all. The experience was good and I shall again go to Mocambo. After all, first choice does not get faded away from the memory easily !
I shall hope that Mocambo will come back with all it's glory. They will use their service, food-quality and good behavior to win the hearts all over again.

Ahhh...Mocambo! The best place to dine whenever you are in Kolkata. With the old colonial style decor and little dim light, the moment you step inside the restaurant you get a good feeling. I found the behaviour of the staff, every one of them excellent. I don't know if they have become more polite after the social media trial but I have always found them perfect, with the right blend of formal greetings and warmth. Now to the food, ordered cocktails (two Screwdrivers, one Bloody Mary) with the appetizer Devilled crab. Cocktails were really good and the deviled crab was out of the world. For the main course, we had a beef steak, one cordon bleu, and Angels on horseback. I didn't taste the steak but my friend was very happy with it and he was at Mocambo for the first time. The other two dishes were perfectly made with the right amount of spices and cheese. And, then the bill came at around 2600. I think this is the most affordable elite restaurants in Kolkata at the moment. There are so many places now in this city but whenever I am back home, I prefer eating at Mocambo or Peter Cat rather than all the new popped up places.

Review: Mocambo

Currently there is a negative air about this restaurant in whole Kolkata, and it is for all the right reasons, still I must admit that the food it serves are actually good. This review is though about my personal experience analyzed with section by section scoring, where they score a comfortable 4/5, but for humanitarian reasons my final awarded rating to them is 1/5.

Location - 4.5/5
At Park Street, the elite restaurant hub of Kolkata, very easy to locate this one.

Facilities - 3/5
No dedicated parking place, finding a parking spot infront of the restaurant is also not so easy, even during weekdays. Expect to walk for about 500 meters from the parking spot unless you get lucky.

Ambience - 4.5/5
Proper lighting and comfortable seating arrangements, with plush interior makes it a comfortable place for having food. No dedicated takeaway facilities are there.

Food - 4/5
From whatever I have tested from their dishes, from their continental menu Chicken sicillene, Chicken Tetrazzini & Fish Paprika are recommended, from Italian menu the Rissottos are worth tasting. For the steaks, there are places in Kolkata which are better than Mocambo. Perhaps this is the only restaurant in Kolkata to offer most variety of continental food to satisfy the foody desires. The price is on higher side, but the exclusivity of the food and the ambiance compensate for that mostly.

Service - 4.5/5
I have never felt anything bad about the service. Professional & courteous, probably one of the places to follow most etiquettes of placing the forks, spoons and plates correctly.

Overall - 4/5
This is a very nice place to satisfy your desires for Italian & continental food, with great ambience for a romantic/ family dinner.

But, personally I will never visit this restaurant again after the horrible thing their service staff have done to that poor guy. Restaurants like this deserves a closure, or at the least a complete ban from foody community.

So, I'm scratching the whole rating to finally award it the minimum marks of 1/5 of the zomato ratings to them, because they have done something that is totally unacceptable for anyone with even a little "humanity" left in them.

Sadly the restaurant does not live upto its pseudo high esteem. Overall very unsatisfactory. Waiters weren't bothered about customer satisfaction. The chicken sizzler,was very very average and could have been much better. The chicken tetrazzini was great and thank god was suggested. But who could go wrong with extra cheese, spaghetti and chicken right ? Probably the only recommended item on the menu. The dessert were below average. Even a small stand-alone outlet serves better brownie and chocolate sauce with vanilla ice cream. Overall unsatisfactory.

Despite all the negative vibes about this place I am giving this place a rating of 4.0 just from a foodie point of view. We went there on ashtami evening at around 5'o clock after a very disgusting experience at Blue and Beyond. Actually we weren't actually planning to visit mocambo and was just passing by it with a hungry stomach and realised that the restaurant was almost full. We just casually asked whether there a table for 2 was available or not. They just told us to wait for 10 mins. Standing outside when we were busy deciding where to go the manager called us in and hence began our unexpected and unplanned food experience at mocambo. 
This is definitely a legendary restaurant with a very nice ambience and an elite atmosphere. 
When we first ordered the drinks the manager asked us for some ID. They strictly doesn't serve alcohol to people younger than 21 yrs of age. But for us that wasn't a problem. 
Among the food items we ordered pepperd crab devilled, then came fiah ala diana,  and chicken paprika followed. 
Among them the best was fish ala diana. I've had better devilled crab in One Step Up.  Chicken paprika was good to taste but in the menu it was stated as an award winning recipe which I found to be an exaggeration. 
Allover it was a nice experience. You may visit this place for the sake of good food once you are done with the recent negativities about this place. 
P. S- The pocket pinch may hurt a little.

As always this classy restaurant won my heart and appeased my taste buds without fail this puja.I had ordered their Malai kabab as an appetiser and it melted in my mouth ..next I went on to order a grilled chicken sizzler and I guess you should taste it to experience its goodness.I had also ordered paneer butter Masala and masala kulcha which were okay and nothing extraordinary ..yet I suggest you must definitely give this restaurant a try for its awesome ambience and delicious specialities like sizzler 👍🏻

A legendary place to dine in!! We went in here today and fortunately we got a seat because it is crowded most to the time.. the place and the food is definitely overhyped.. we ordered
1) one fish ala diana
2) one angels on horseback
3) rum collins and
4) the screwdriver as the drinks..
rum collins is rum based ( as the name says) and screwdriver is vodka based.. both tasted pretty good. Now coming to the main course, the fish ala diana was good.. this is my 4th visit on mocambo.. i last visited this restaurant 5 years back.. the only thing i felt is that the food quality is not like before.. i usually visited this place for the fish ala diana.. but this time it was just ordinary... now coming to the angels on horseback.. the chicken pieces wrapped in bacon were extremely moist and textured.. but the sauce was way too tangy.. otherwise everything was good.. overall a good experience like always.. :)

Overrated and over priced. One time is ok but not for second time. Stiff behaviors need to change but anyway it's the mindset of a restaurant on how they want to serve the customer. It's definitely lagging on fine dine restaurant. 

There are plenty of awesome restaurants in Park Street and this is a No No from my view and experience.

Visited this place on august, this year. The ambiance and food is not bad at all. It is average. The cream tomato soup, was delish.. but everything else was bland.!!!. took mushroom steak &risotto.!. everything lacked proper seasoning...; Now the staff behaviour... They didn't behave badly with us, not at all... but they don't have any decency. No smile, on face., no greetings, etc etc,.................... what you expect from a fine dining place.. this is a major mistake. I must say.; they, are not true professionals at this... and the major reason for my rating is the waiting time... at first we had to wait nearly 3 minutes, for a table, that too when there was lot of empty tables !.. It's really empty compared to other places in park street. We found that out, after we went inside.  and then the food came after a long 45 minutes, and they served it like, one dish at 15 minutes, another at 40, and then another at 45... this thing is what i hate, in any dining place.. Other than that, about, food I  no such big  complaints. Well, yes they are costly, for the food that they give, and they should make up that for good service, which they don't. Will I go there again ?, No, there are way too many better places in park street.

Have heard a lot about this place,so went there for a dinner with a lot of expectations. Have ordered for the Chicken paprika,Fish A La Diana & the Fish Wellington. The chicken Paprika & Fish A La Diana was truly delicious.Fish A La Diana brings together two of the most delectable fishes, Bhetki nd prawn & it tastes heavenly. Fish Wellington however was not dat tasty, it tasted too bland. But I would like to mention the service was absolutely disappointing.They served all d dishes together that too after a long wait of around 50 mins,further we have to call d waiters tym n again for refilling even water.

Am surprised to read such awful reviews about the best continental restaurant in town! Just taste their food to get a taste of European cuisine. It is the pride of kolkata. On weekends there is a long waiting line to enter place. Surely there are many who will agree that it is one of the best eateries we have in kolkata serving authentic, delicious continental cuisine like Fish Florentine, Chicken ala Kiev and Angel on Horseback.

T'was a weekend luncheon when we hit one of the popular dining location in Kolkata.
Being a first timer to Mocambo, the things one would find it in here:
1. Awesum ambience-Pretty decent ambience with light music.
2. Good Continental food- Every item we ordered was great. Especially the chicken chitpole I ordered was heavy but it was awesome.
3. Courteous staff- We were calling the staff for food or drinks every now and then, and they responded very courteously.
Though it was weekend and afternoon, we expected a decent amount of crowd there but it was not so much,maybe because of the past incident but I did not find any such attitude in the staff.
Overall would love to hit it any time...

But seriously staff behavior needs to be improved. They first told us that there is no place you have to wait and after 5 minutes they told us to come in and when they did allow we found that the entire section was empty completely. Very weird. The waiters were so arrogant and full of attitude and I dont know why and what harm we did

Well to be frankly speaking Mocambo is just a normal restro, might call themselves a "fine-dine" whatsoever.  Food quality is average, takes long time to serve even though the restro is partially filled.
P.S : Zomato if you want I will mail you the images as a prove I went there once, only came back with a pathetic exp. But thank God the ACs worked well, no sound. Kudos. 5/5

This is a real bad place. The service is not good at all. Most of the foods are overpriced. 
If you are in Kolkata, enjoy street food - that is much better (and a lot cheaper).

Food here is not good, very much overpriced, they put cream in everything, the ambience is not what you want from a "FINE DINE". The behaviour of waiters are also not good, should avoid this, as there are many other good place around in park street to dine.

We went for lunch today. We got a very good table because it wasn't much crowded. However, the waiters were very self satisfied and didn't care much about hospitality. Such a behavior wasn't unexpected. They took a really long time to serve the food and they weren't even serving water on time. We would have to continuously ask the waiters to give some water. However, coming to the food. We ordered :

•Mushroom garlic prawn : They served crispy fried prawns in a sauce with mushrooms served with some cheese. Packed with flavour and a generous quantity of prawns makes it a good choice. I'll give it a 3.5/5
•Chicken cordon bleu : Baked chicken and ham in yummy cheese and tomato sauce served with vegetables. It's very filling and both the ham and chicken were served in huge proportions. The meat was very juicy. But nothing exceptional so I give it a 3.5/5
•Fish florentine - Baked fish and potatoes in cheese and tomato sauce. Generous proportions of fish served. The sauce is very gooey and all that a cheese lover can ask for. I give it a 4/5
•Fish a la diana : Best of the lot. They serve fish with stuffed prawns and cheese. It's absolutely heavenly and extremely heavy also. Totally worth every bit of the money. I give it a 5/5
• Brownie with hot chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream : The traditional desert . Good to taste. The hot chocolate on the brownie was very tasty. I give it a 3/5

Overall a good experience.

I have been to this restaurant many times over the years. I have witnessed its steady decline. Here's why.

The staff at Mocambo have become increasingly snobbish, ill behaved and sometimes downright rude. Elitism runs in their veins. As the wait time in front of the place is invariably long, the least that can be expected is courtesy. Which of course, you won't get here.

The food is over hyped and overpriced. Apart from a few items on the menu, like the prawn cocktail and chicken cordon bleu, the palatability of the food is debatable (and I'm being nice here).

I've had way better at much less prices. Hakuna Matata, for example. Or Trincas. Or even One Step Up or Bistro by the Park. All much better options and much less elitist.

The environment inside the restaurant was good and the sofas were also very nice. The food however was average, especially I did not like their bacon preparation. The dessert was a saving grace. The service was not anything special. I wish we had been provided a bit of guidance from the staff when we were ordering. Apparently, we chose the dishes poorly.

Great ambiance and one of the best restaurants in town for continental delicacies.  Devilled crabs, chicken steak sizzlers and prawn cocktail are a must try!  Although I'm not too fond of the Chinese here. I would prefer ordering only the continental choices.  Have always been there with my friends and family and had good memories and will continue doing so! And having said so, let me tell you that if you are about to try this place, please go ahead and do so and not rely on any biased reviews against this place that have been doing the rounds lately. This place is 60 years old and was there even before Zomato's birth. And the place has always had consistent high rating, only because of their food, service and ambiance. 

It feels sad that some people are getting overly emotional and biased against this restaurant due to an unfortunate incident ( which again, nobody exactly knows if at all happened or what the real circumstances were.) And good that Zomato is keeping these review regulations. At least I, being a foodie, would only like to know genuine reviews of people who have actually experienced a place. And not a single person's personal views and experiences resonated through thousands of mouths as a result of some synthetic biased media hype! Wake up guys! Use this space for posting first hand experience and not your moral judgments, that is what this forum is for!

Best wishes, Mocambo! keep serving the best food in town :) happy eating all you foodies !!!

The heritage restaurant learnt the finesse from the British and chose to satiate the culinary fantasies of the Indians once they left. It is a treat not just for the belly pot hanging ahead of most,  but also to all other senses that get activated at this venue. Smell as once savours the relishing food; touch of lip smacking sizzler;  sound of happy chirping revellers andsight of a pocket friendly bill. A must visit in Kolkata.  Mogambo Zaroor Khoosh Hoga!

I have been here once, a couple of years ago, and it's a shame that I neglected to spare the time for writing up a befitting review of this place. I should have done it earlier. Zomato wants the review to be about the restaurant and not about the furore in the social media, so be it.   

The food is pretty average. Nothing really stands out. However, its not very bad either.

What I really found agonizing was the quality of service in this restaurant. It was pathetic, albeit. The servers were dismal in their approach. They made us move tables in the middle of our dinner, which was tacky and bothersome. Overall, the service staff were dismissive of their customers and I wouldn't dream of going back there again.

If you are a hard working bourgeois trotting in your working class outfit, don't try to go there. They will throw you out, as we all have found out recently. However, even if you are going about in your No. 1 Savile Row, flaunting your estuary english with a ringing trap-bath split, don't bother going here. They might still mistreat you.

Back in my school and college days in Kolkata, I have visited this place literally dozens of times or even more to hog on to prawn cocktail or devilled crabs. However, in recent times things have changed drastically and for the bad. For example, cockroaches were seen and the authority was never bothered. The plates were clean but somehow seemed old that need to be changed which never happened as the management is living in delusion of serving "fine dining" which clearly they are not. Also, the staffs wear uniforms that look dirty and seem like they are from ancient time without wash. After experiencing such unhygienic ambiance last couple of visit in Kolkata, and such u friendly and rude behavior from the staffs, As a food lover, neither I , nor my family would ever visit Mocambo again. NOT RECOMMENDED.

I was there recently with an Australian friend and we tried the wiener schnitzel, which they call authentically Australian. but it was not authentic. and definitely not good enough for the price. They claim to serve all fancy authentic dishes, and people accept it because they might not know what the dish really tastes like. 
But i can tell you for sure there was nothing Australian about it. It tasted quite sad. May be they are good with Indian dishes...but I am definitely not going there to find out and end up having another food disaster.

The ambience is good but food is not worth the money you have to spend. Standing for more than half an hour for dinner does not make sense at all. They try to hurry you off the table because others are waiting outside. Mutton dishes are not fully cooked. Better avoid this place and find some better restaurants in Park street.

Had been here 3months ago. My friends and i had made a reservation in advance and yet we were asked to wait for 30-40mins more despite there being empty tables inside. We decided to wait since we had heard good things about this place. We then went on and ordered chicken steak,veg au gratin and chicken ala kiev and a few drinks. The staff seemed quite disinterested and looked like they were doing us a favour (which might be true but thats not how the hospitality industry works). The drinks were all served in water glasses, which is strange since the foreigners had the right ones. We didnt say anything and waited for our food. Wasnt value for the money we paid at all. Quantity was small. Taste was quite nice. But the rest of the experience was just something we wanted to forget.

All in all, there are way too many options in kolkata. This place is NOT worth a visit. Staff needs to change their attitude and so does the management. Its not going to work out till they learn some humility. They have been famous for a long time and have forgotten that business runs cuz of the customers. Soon they wont have any. 

And yes i am writing this review a little too late. Keeping the recent incident in mind i thought ppl should know what snobs they are. #humamityfail #boycottmocambo. Now going to make sure i write on TripAdvisor!!

the staff attitude was weird...they were behaving as if they were doing great favor in serving us food...we asked them to change our seat as the restaurant was mostly empty but they denied to do so...giving a single star for staff attitude..wud have got a bit high rating if the food was exceptional...will never bother to visit here again!!!

Mocambo is located at the heart of Kolkata and is known for serving people since the last three decades. However, the event that occured in the recent past led to a sharp decline in their long earned reputation. Visited Mocambo just 3 days after the incident took place. The ambience is cozy and the behavior of the staff were cordial. They were too courteous and paid invidual attention to each person. We ordered Chicken Orientale a la Mocambo. The food was delicious but the price is too high compared to the quantity of the food.
Coming back to the incident, I, by no means, support the way they treated the driver just because he belonged to the lower strata of the society. I really hope they treat every individual with equal respect to earn back the same respect which they now lost.

Iv been here umpteen number of times especially since my early years in Kolkata...as I settled down in this great city. Mocambo is the other 'name' for good continental cuisine for many in this city and for many outside the city. I understood why they say so, the day I dined at this legendary fine dining restaurant.

Mocambo is one of the hyped restaurants in Kolkata since a long time so thought of paying a visit over here sometime back with my friend. But not everything old is gold always, and so is the case with Mocambo. The food is not something special to go gaga over it and neither the staffs will give you a warm welcome. Also the price is too high keeping in mind the quality of food served. I am not visiting here again for the second time. Kolkata has come up with a lot of options these days so why waste your money and quality time in something that is not worth it!!

Trapped in a time warp of what passed as "continental" cuisine in the bad old days of the 1990's because we didn't as yet know any better, Mocambo is an underwhelming dining experience. The food (avoid anything that threatens to be italian) is mediocre at best and the service isn't particularly better. Go if you're desperately seeking it's particular name brand of nostalgia, but even for that, Park Street and Calcutta has better options.

I visited this place with a lot of excitement but was thoroughly disappointed with their food and service. I think this place is overhyped. My favourite Park Street place is Peter Cat. They are just the best when it comes to Chelos and Sizzzzzzzz. Nobody makes it like them.

The language that has been used to review this place is English. Expect that people with a basic literacy level in English will understand that I did not like the restaurant. 

This review only, only and only showcases my experience.

The food is overrated and overpriced and mostly does not taste or look at all like they ideally should. For instance their wienerschnitzel has the texture of a cross between sinewy hard to chew rubber and a piece of cardboard. On top of this, the waiters are arrogant and racist. And so is the management. Thus making the ambience pretty vile.

wait was longer than informed (said 10 minutes, waited 25), thus organization was shoddy, food was good, presentation (of the food itself) was good, the cutlery, the decor, the ambiance was all sub par for such a hyped restaurant, a fine dining restaurant is supposed to be about more than just the food, so kudos to the chef, but royally disappointed, in that i expected what was supposed to be a "royal" treatment, what i got was a rather uncomfortable average restaurant with painful decor but good food. The disparity between expectations due to advertisement and actual experience, deserves the lowest rating. Don't call yourself fine dining if you can't provide the experience it implies.

The conti food is old fashioned and very tasty. Now coming to the recent incident it was in really bad taste & i dunno both sides of the story so i wont comment on it. If the team is reading this, ensure that nothing of this sort happens before, Youll have a big heritage to protect.

Now foods, I feel I don't have to mention anything regarding this fine dining restaurant. We ordered keema nun, chicken tandoori cooked with chicken lever , mutton . The food was awesome and the next time we ordered sizzlers, still now I can't forget the taste. Do visit this place if you want to have great food and stupendous ambience and want to spend quality time with friends or family.

I have been to Mocambo twice and have decided not to go there anymore.

Reasons:-

1. Waiting time - In most cases, they will keep you waiting outside for anything between 15 - 45 mins. They claim they have to do that because of seating limitations but in reality they do that to satiate their ego of a 'fine dining' restaurant. However, if you look through the windows, you will see lots of empty tables but they will claim each one of them is booked.

2. Rats - The next time you're at Mocambo and feel something nibbling at your feet, don't freak out. Those are just the elite pet rats (or could be roaches as well) of Mocambo who are a part of giving the entire 'fine dining' experience.

3. Microwave a' la carte - Most of the foods served there are hot but bland and you can tell that they have been microwaved several times. The last time I went and tried their Mutton Kababs, they were soggy and tasteless, certainly not deserving the price charged for it. Don't expect fresh and tasty food at Mocambo.

4. Rude staff - You will be made to feel that the staff of Mocambo are doing you a favour instead of you doing them by visiting their place. The waiters are arrogant and will whisper ugly nothings behind your back if you tell them to change your dish or not hand them a fat tip.

Overall, I find Mocambo highly overrated and arrogant. They might have had their charm back in the day but now they're just a cocky eating place serving sub-standard foods at exorbitant prices.

There are lots of other restaurants at Park Street that are way better than Mocambo in terms of quality of food and overall hospitality.

This place has long waiting times. Food is expensive, not worth for the amount you pay. Staff behavior is horrible, as if they are doing you a favor by serving. Waiters are running around all the time and dont have the time to take you order. Once you order, it takes around an hour for the food to arrive. The Ambiance is dark enough to not know if you are dining with your friend or a stranger.
All in all, it was a bad experience. They have a lot of improvement to do. This restaurant is an insult to the other places at park street.

Have been here 3-4 times to try different things. Found the food to be okayish except the Chicken Tetrazinni which I kind of liked. But your eating experience maybe marred by the pathetic staff behavior. They will make you wait long enough even though there will be empty seats inside. And after that, they won't let you choose seats according to your preference for no reason whatsoever. I will prefer not going there from now on. I feel I have given them enough chances.

Bad staff behavior and pretty average food... Found nothing special... Much hyped and the restaurant  maintains its utmost effort to project its 'so called aristocratic' environment... But honestly... Not worth paying a visit! I'll Just say its Just one of those restros which is thriving in its vintage!!
And lately they have started making wonders by working disasters!! So folks.. visit only if you are well dressed!!

This had to be updated since Zomato kindly decided to takedown my review. Let's make this clear. I loved this place and the legendary food here. This review is about their service.

I have been a regular at this place, taking particular pleasure in devouring mountains of their expensive fish muniere, deviled crab, and sinful old school desserts. They used to do great whisky sours as well. The portions were small, but that's the price you pay for exclusivity, one supposes. The waiters were stuffy yet polite, but the managers inevitably size people up, and the waiting. Oh the waiting. Despite empty tables, it was the norm to make people wait, which is the practice with all Kothari Group restaurants. I believe this makes them feel exclusive. The delicious irony.

This place makes people feel like they're doing their customers a favour. That in my book goes against the grain of hospitality. Delicious, overpriced food aside, I've never felt comfortable eating here.

Peter Cat and Mocambo are owned by the Kothari Group, who also own Bar-b-que, One Step Up, and Flavours of China. This rating is a warning to review your manners and management style, and a call to boycott this group of eateries until a public apology is issued, and strict instructions issued to control discrimination.

Visited this place 2 years back. Must say the food is shit , specially the prawn cocktail, it was fried prawn dipped in sugar syrup. I wonder why the chef took so much time preparing it(it came after 20mins). I dont remember what else I order but surely wasn't worth remembering. The sitting arrangement is clumsy, you expect it to be better when you are paying such high prices.

Had orderd a steak, rissoto and mutton rogan Josh. On a very special evening. Had a chivas and a beer between the two of us. If you call minced pattie fried on a grill and called a steak then it certainly was. Un edible. 

Rissoto made with basmati rice? Like where what who does that? 

Rogan Josh was on point. Liked that. Ruined my evening nevertheless. I ate only the rogan Josh and left to go to Peter cat which served phenomenal food and made up for the mistake I made. 

Tip : clean your menus they are oily and smelly.

It is a very overrated place. The food is nothing to boast about. The quality of service is sonething that is particularly dissapointing and the management does not take an note of that even after repeated incidents. The culture and behaviour of the attendants are particularly rude. I have been here twice and both times the attitude of the management was very unsettling. They take the customers for granted for sure. Surprisingly, the managers are living under a rock and making no changes to their outlook.

Well....that's my review. Because I was never disappointed while visiting Mocambo. Serves one of the best food in the city. Am happy for my numerous great delicious moments I spent there.

Now regarding the hot topic, well I stand beside the restaurant. Did it prohibited the person because he was a driver or because he wasn't clean enough and hasn't dressed properly? Its the clean part. Is it right for them to do this....well should have been handled better but yes, they are right in doing so. Its not like they have prohibited someone for his social status but more for his appearance. We ourselves don't visit or sit to eat if the place is not a bit polished or eye soothing.
This issue is blown way out of proportion by the so called media and hypocritical mass. How many of us take our maids and cooks and sit with them and have food? How many of you have ever thought of taking or even giving atleast one plate to the beggars waiting outside?
In short, I won't mind again visiting this joint and hope to get those wonderful pepper crabs.....yummm

Devilled Crab
Vegetable Surprise
Chateaubriand beef steak medium rare done
To wash it all down we had 
Bloody Mary
Whiskey Sour
Tom Collins

On a prior occasion I had almost driven one of their manager crazy over the phone with repeated calls to fix the menu for an office party.  He was ever so polite.  And educated me on many food item s and the amount I should order when I was ordering too much. He did not go with me which would have given him more sales. he told me to order less. 

And after all this for a day of phone calls to and fro I cancelled the entire do for some reasons entirely mine; still Mr. Sean was very polite.

No we too do not have any club membership etc. Just simply working professionals from Calcutta and Bangalore.

I feel in this industry some restaurant manager or staff who have been serving for a long time in the restaurant, tend to think as if they are the boss and somewhere they take the customers for granted. Well they are not so well read and have a mind of their own. All i can say is the owner would never let such a thing happen. It's truely shocking how the manager behaved but i feel the management should get a chance to explain themselves.

This is one of the most prestigious and iconic restaurants in kolkata.  
How can you guyz go all over a place only by listening to one side of the story.  
Mocambo  in the past  as well has been a well mannered restaurant  and it is till date.  
I have been to mocambo  multiple times with friends and family Nd of course along with  domestic helps too.  
Never ever faced such an issue so its hards to believe.  
It is definitely done on purpose to try and tarnish Mocambo's image.

All I can say is Shit up you hunch of self righteous idiots. Mocambo is , always was and will always remain an iconic address in Kolkata. . Before shunning such an institution, please delve into your own and ask yourself " when was the last time you took your driver out for dinner? When was the last time you enjoyed your meal with someone who comes across as a "not so ok profile" to you specially when you are with with your wife or your girlfriend"? Which club you go to allow you to share your table with your house maid? Name one! Stop bullshitting and get real guys!  You guys have no freaking power to do good to anyone ..at least do good to yourself but not doing bad to others. Pardon me if I have offended anyone but I am just venting my true feeling just like a lot of you guys have done.

Do not opt for the Indian menu at Mocambo. The place is great for the old-world Continental food. Great flavours, as if preserved since the olden days. The Fish Diana is my favourite! No restairant makes it like Mocambo.

Why can't people understand the meaning of 'Fine Dining'??
This is one of the 'Legendary' restaurant of Kolkata.
I feel dress codes should always be maintained in these classy restaurants!

There r so many restaurants in Park Street, the lady (with his driver) could have visited some other restaurants. There is no point in boycotting or creating an issue over this petty issue!
Btw, The management didn't disrespect them, they just said the restaurant is full.

People should put themselves in the place of the restaurant managers also!
Why judge?

The food is ordinary or even worse, it is mostly stale and when you complain of it being burnt or undercooked they refuse to change it.The cutlery and plates are hardly suitable to be served in, especially at a place which charges so highly. The staff especially the waiters are disgusting, they hover over your shoulder to see how much you have tipped them and they are never happy and make it obvious by not even serving you water or pulling out your chair. Although entry should be on a first come first serve basis it is not the case- it is more on how they like your money flaunting attitude. To be avoided at all costs

Dear Mocambo Manager, 

With respect I want to ask some questions. 
But prior to that am appolizing for my poor ENGLISH. ..

I know u all have done doctorate in ENGLISH  from world famous Universities apart from your hotel management courses .

1.But my question is after having all these degrees why u people are serving here ??? Can they justify ur EDUCATION? ??

2. Do you people serve hard drinks ??? If yes ,then if I get drunk over there what will be my punishment ???
3. Which English do you prefer ? BRITISH OR AMERICAN? ??am planning to learn or will ask my friends who wants to go ???

4.I had never been at MOCAMBO,  but I always wished to ,so I was saving money for that but now I think I can never visit your place , cause now I come to know to visit ur place I have to save more money ,so that I can buy a I7 and dresses from Manish Malhotra or Ritu  Beri or any renowned fashion designer what I can't do in this life . But after knowing the fact that I will never get the chance , just for curiosity I want to know what will be the minimum cost of the dress ???

Another suggestions for poor people like us please you update all the details ( dress code , price of the dress , eligibility of speaking foreign language,  and other basic requirements in  Zomato along  with menu chart )

Thanks and regards 
Nivedita Majumder

I have not been here recently but my past experience with the restaurant has been good. This review goes out to those countless pimps who have rated this good restaurant 1 star without visiting the place, without tasting their food and based on some idiotic unverified comments. 
My request to Zomato, please take down these ratings as these people are just basking in the glory of some unfortunate negative publicity that this place recently had.

Went there with family a month back. The ambience was very nice. Got a cozy seat in the corner after waiting for a short while. We were dressed in casuals but there was no problem.  The waiters themselves took our orders in bengali and they were pretty well behaved. Food was delicious. Although we ran up a bill on the higher side,  it was a pretty satisfying experience. I find it hard to believe the negative stories  being circulated without checking its veracity. There are usually two sides to a story.  People often tend to forget that.

The staffs are discourteous to the hilt and are extremely judgmental about you. At the restaurant they do not consider a human as human alone but discriminate and stratifies them into classes based on subjective biases of skin colour, dress, language spoken and accessories flashed. Just because you doesn't fit into your description of a perfect customer for any wierd reason they might deny you service. The staffs also haggle for tips and the way they do it is outright preposterous! AVOID VISITING THE RESTUARENT

We don't offer a glass of water to the delivery boy, but when it comes to taking down a well-reputed restaurant #mocambo, people are becoming so rebellious. We reserve separate cup-dish,glass etc for domestic workers and we talk about Mocambo ignoring a roadside driver for not allowing him to dine. Bunch of hypocrites everywhere.

examples of being a hypocritic Indian (including me) 

1. Insulting Muslims as "mullas" but never missing an opportunity to hog biriyani in their homes on Eid.

2. a lady gets molested/raped in public, everyone ignores. But everyone will walk the protest march to show their sympathies.Weird!

3. Liking and sharing videos on child labour. But in real life "abey chotu jaldi khana laa yaar".

Facebook is now the new supreme court of India. And these so called social media celebrities and stalwarts are the honourable members of the jury :')

I have eaten at Mocambo many times and have simply loved the continental food. They have maintained their standards and yes they still offer value form money. It is a place where people go to celebrate special occasions. There has been a lot of brouhaha on social media on the insensitivity shown. While I fully empathise with the person being refused entry , I also remember the right of any service establishment which says 'Rights of Admission Reserved'. So while it is a free country for a customer to choose it is also a free country for a service establishment to choose their customers.

I swear all this reaction is so unscrupulous! How can a Facebook post be considered 100% authentic and honest?  Why do the online  regiment conclude and deduce, everything that is exaggerated is of prime importance as well as factual! The social media over reaction is enough to sabotage someone's hard work which you do sitting behind the monitor. Also, all the online portals/media outlets please maturely do your homework  before publishing fake FB page ranting in your articles. No one vocalised any official statement of boycotting 'roadside people'.  ''Mocambo Kolkata'' is a fake page which went on orating fake abuses to reviewers, whereas just ''Mocambo'' is the real page which haven't issued any formal riposte yet.

If there is one place on earth where I do not have a favorite dish... Then it is mocambo.... The reason I do not have a favorite dish here is because I love each and every dish on the menu card... Whenever I visit this place, I take eons to decide on what to order coz I want to order everything... I just love the food... On the recent controversy... We all are indebted to our domestic helps in more ways than one... But no one will offer them any form of luxury back home... If someone was so sympathetic why couldn't she treat the driver at her own place at her own dining table on her own laopala dinner set??? What stopped her... It's very easy to criticise...

Everyone who is commenting is purely judging out of sentiments and emotions. How many of you are thinking logically and rationally? What the mocambo staff did is extremely wrong and they should be penalised immediately but did anyone try to think why the manager or the staff did that? Get to the ground reality, this is purely based on feudal mentality. The British started this and we are doing alike. Humanity has fallen beyond shame but and a big but! Before blaming the manager, look at yourself, those who are cursing him. How many of you can take a street child and try going to mocambo with ease and comfort and not thinking once about your so called 'reputation'? It's not your fault, it's not our fault but fault of our mentality, our society. Feudalism has taken over humanity. Don't go with the crowd, if a car hits a pedestrian and if the pedestrian is completely at fault still the 'crowd' will bash up the driver of the car. So instead of going with the crowd think logically, where the root cause of this feudalism lies? People who are commenting 'shut down mocambo' are emotional fools. One spoilt fruit doesn't make the tree worthless. Mocambo serves one of the most exotic dishes in India. Love the fish a la diana and the devilled crab especially.

This review is not a sudden outburst after checking the social media but this is from a personal experience a little over 6 months ago. I am born and brought up in Kolkata but I am out of the city for more than 5 years now. I have been to Mocambo many times before and have enjoyed the food almost everytime. But my last visit there around 6 months ago made me think that how backward the management of Mocambo is. We three went on a Saturday afternoon to have dinner at Mocambo. (Me and 2 school friends of mine. All guys). Upon reaching Mocambo at around 7pm, we enquired about a table and was asked by the person standing at the gate how many we were? I said 3. He asked all guys? I said yes. He said it will take 30 minutes to get table even though you could see many empty tables inside. Still we waited for 30 mins and when we came back, they said that it will take more than an hour to get tables now as there are reservations. Upon enquiring about the empty tables, I was told that those tables are for families. Bachelors section is different and separate from families. That came as a shocker for me. I have never heard of a bachelor segregated section in a restaurant. That was very shocking and I just couldn't imagine how backward the mentality was of the management there. It was really shocking. The discrimination was baffling. I don't know how the owner of such a reputed restaurant can employ such cheap and disgusting mentalities. I had decided to not visit the restaurant ever and even more so now after reading the incident on social media.

Note: In case anyone is interested, we were all suited booted, talked in English and were absolutely not drunk when we went to Mocambo.

Suggestion: Head over to Marco Polo in Park Street for a fantastic ambiance and excellent food if you are looking for a substitute of Mocambo. To clarify again, I am NO WAY related to Marco Polo. Just a foodie. :)

In light of the stories that I'm going over in Facebook I would also like to share my experience - rather bitter experience - here.

The last time I had visited this place,which was some good 1 year back, we were in a group of 10-12 colleagues. We had ordered Scotch Whiskey, and they were served in water glasses (the long ones used to serve water,you know). When asked why scotches were served in water glasses, the answer was "We serve Indian scotches in water glasses only". How sick can that be? Being an Indian restaurant, and boasting of its heritage, this is completely unethical and uncalled for.

Incidentally, one of my friends was also there with his family. They had ordered beer, which was again served in water glasses. While inquiring on the incident, we came to know that beer mugs were only served to "Foreign Customers". Now again, this was acutely irritating, if not racist.

That was the last time me and my friends ever visited and will visit the place. And post this incident, I've also made it a point to not prescribe this restaurant to any of my nonresidential friends visiting Kolkata.

Such a shame!

@Mocambo We pray to god that "you should be out of business soon" Such a shame!!!!Zomato wants the place to be rated professionally (Unbiased of the media, judging on Food, Ambience and service ). So I am changing my review.

1. Judging from palates :    (2.5/5)
Average! Skillful execution. No fineness. Average plating.

2. Judging from wallet :       (-1.5/5)
Worse! A lot expensive than what it should be even Restaurants in Vegas are somewhat cheaper than this place! Highly not recommended. 

3. Judgments on comfort & ambiance:  (2/5)
Bellow Average to the costs they charge. 

4. Judging the smile on my face (conduct & services) : (-3.5/5)
OMG! Its the hardest part. Lack of decency. Attitude is worse. Its like paying the bills with (6% service taxes) for arrogant services and rash behavior .. 

Final rating : (-0.5/5) Unfortunately, the lowest provided rating in Zomato is 1. In short, definitely not Recommended! Do something good with your hard earned money rather than wasting it here.

Without even knowing what would have really happened people are drawing out conclusions. People who haven't been there or to Kolkata are even commenting ... Guys there are joints in Goa n Kasol where Indians are not allowed .. Now what do you call them ... We just need a spark everybody jumps in to comment ... I Haven't been to this place though

The media then adds on to it ... "ROADSIDE" Driver .. Haha u got the brownie points ...

Really horrible service...was waiting for more than 45 minutes and they would only do favouritism and let those customers go who were regulars...such hypocrites...In the end had to walk away...
I would recommend people not to end up there if you are not a regular...
Such services from Mocambo is NOT EXPECTED.PERIOD.

Last month i went to Mocambo to treat my guy with my first earning & we had a lovely time.. the food was great the cocktails were great.. in fact we were planning to get back to the place some time just for the amazing risotto! But this incident was such a disappointment. This is not expected from a heritage restaurant which has served people since so many years. It's shameful. I'm so heart broken.

History repeats itself !

In 2013, Paradise restaurant of Hyderabad is mired in similar controversy like of Mocambo, Kolkata. 

Paradise fired a bouncer but didn't fire the manager on duty (Read it again. there is THE difference). 

A few weeks later, paradise might be clocking the same revenues.

After all business is nothing but a machine to provide dignity of life to many (Employees, Customers, shareholders etc.,). That does mean who provides better dignity generally survives. Dignity can be termed value too. 

Now, Mocambo may come out with an apology. A few more restaurants may get sensitized to the issue. An employee may get fired. It's essential for Mocambo to change their attitude but it shouldn't die because 'business is about dignity. '

We wants things to change and need not behave like Cauvery river protesters (on social media and platforms like Zomato) !!!

A free advise to resurrect your business Mocambo : How about calling that person to restaurant and serving him a finely made meal and publishing it along with an apology.

Disclaimer: Never went to Mocambo neither I am a fan of fine-dine restaurants. Even I don't understand the meaning of 'fine-dine'

I feel like coming there naked with a limo and see how do you respond. You should just get yourself out of Kolkata. It's not a city you deserve to serve. You piece of sh*t...

Last time I was here in 15' Nov and found these waiters pretty snobbish...which was already annoying. To be fair, the food was better than decent. But the inhuman behavior you've shown is NOT pardonable...bye

Food has deteriorated a lot in past 3-4 years. 
And it used to go on just because it was a heritage an iconic thing to have food from Mocambo. Now the last bit of thread is also gone, 'll never step into this "fine dinner" again. 
            Now the sizzler which I found it brilliant a few years back is nowhere near it's taste nowadays.

Yes I am also writing a review after reading the stuff about their funny attitude.

I had been to this place about 8 years ago and was amazed at their low prices. Coming from Mumbai that seemed like the menu of Stomach restaurant.

One thing is for sure its not a fine dining or a place for elite.

There are better places in Kolkata for such claims.

Food was decent as there was nothing exceptional as I tried sizzlers there but Yokos definitely tasted better.

All in all a decent place to eat.

You will not be earning my business and I will make sure none of my business partners in Calcutta ever eat at your place.

Food is so average here nowadays. Covering everything with cheese does not make it taste good. I haven't had steak as bad in a long time. I don't know what's their snooty attitude all about at times. They don't stick to any standards with regard to food. It used to be a place people went to due to lack of options in the city. Now it's mostly just managing to remain pretentious because of the legacy it had built. Just go somewhere else if you can. You'll save yourself the trouble of eating a bad meal.

Being a Kolkatan I have heard of Mocambo a fair bit, with some people swearing allegiance to it ferociously. Last December I finally paid this hallowed establishment a visit.

First impression :: What is with the lights? Its way too dim. If you must, then go for candle lights or similar lighting effects which have a much better impact. The seating arrangement needs a overhaul. Seated at the centre left me with a rather odd feeling. I prefer my dining experience to be quiet and not disturbed by the constant chatter of the waiters next to me and their clattering around with cutlery.

The food was frankly average or barely so. It failed to make an impression. I am aware much cheaper establishments across India serving food of similar quality.

So what are you really paying for? Based on my experience I would say legacy and not quality. I cannot advise this spot to be on anyone's list.

————

This review has been long overdue. However, recent events prompted me to pen this down. About the incident with the lady and the driver, the find it absolutely disgusting that the establishment didn't have the nerve to give the lady the real reason, failed to offer an alternate solution, and finally resorted to blatant lies to deny a man entry (based on perception). I noticed someone quoting Mocambo's response. It is woefully inadequate, digs a deeper hole for Mocambo and actually leaves them with an image which would be hard to recover from. I suppose it would leave Mocambo loyalists a little red in the face, for the sake of decency if nothing else.

An excellent joint for continental cuisine, especially the sizzler is worth living for.

All negative comments will dwindle in next few days and people who are criticizing will soon join the queue with impatient hunger kicking from within. I am sure the other side of the story is not being heard nor reflected properly with people fast coming to conclusions. Nothing to worry about, a pan India phenomenon.

I have always been a loyal customer of Mocambo..Restaurants in Park Street like Bar B Q, Peter Cat, Trincas and Mocambo are heritage restaurants. I don't know who the manager was and if he really behaved like this he should be apologetic for such a RACIST behavior. Please don't forget, if you are still surviving today, it is because of the love of the customers and their trust on you. Is this how you show your gratitude towards them? There are thousand other restaurants serving better sizzlers and better continental than you guys, but still people come because they feel the warmth at Mocambo. In hospitality business learn to show hospitality even to a driver. Really disappointing.

A very unexpected incident which took place at your Restaurant had led everyone looked down upon your staff, waiters and watercress which concluded in the mind of other food lovers the hatred and preferences that your Management/Restaurant had shown towards the food lovers or a normal human being which is very disappointing,  which could end the taste buds of others to even come close to what you guys serve out there.... Please maintain the love for the customers as without them your Quality of food, ambiance, relationships would tend to vanished sooner or later ..... There are many well wishers out there who could turn around the managing skills and a positive attitude towards other human being.....A Humble, Positive, Friendly, Equality Manager or a Leader would do Great in Maintaining Your Restaurant.

Visited this place twice. Never really did I like the food. You really shouldn't classify yourself as a continental restaurant, let alone a fine-dining one. Even the interiors put me off. It's dark and dingy. As for the staff...well, the less said, the better. Most of them are incompetent pompous pricks. You really do not know the true essence of the word hospitality, but surprisingly, that's supposed to be the soul of your business. Kolkata is known for her warmth and hospitality that she extends towards her guests. After the recent incident that I read about, you surely have tainted Kolkata's image. Who gives you the right to do that? You reserve rights to admission, right? After what you guys have done, I believe you will find it a lot easier to screen your visitors because the volume will decrease. No one likes to go to a place which judges people on their attire and just assumes stuff about them. You guys should be ashamed, and that's the least that you can do.

I have been here on multiple occasions, not out of my own volition but for the sake of my friends. Both these times, I've been extremely annoyed by their staff who really force English out of themselves, leading to so much miscommunication. The place does have a very old place vibe to it and along with that so does the food, which honestly should fade out. Everything from the meat being frozen, to the grumpy management, It just feels like one is getting service out of their graciousness rather than our entitlement branching from the fare we pay for the service. 
Sometimes I question the fact that this restaurant is running too well for the quality of service one gets. Everyone going here thinking that this is a fine dining restaurant, please wake up. THIS IS NOT A FINE DINING RESTAURANT. Their menu is too wide to be called so. It would be more apt to call them a "VINTAGE MULTI CUISINE RESTAURANT". I'm sure some people will disagree with me on this but they have to realise that it's time to wake up and stop paying so much money for such lousy food. And if they still disagree, just remember, the likes of CHILIS, BARCELOS, IRISH HOUSE, TGIF and the likes are there. Would you choose to pay the same amount to go to this place where I doubt they have cooks (not chefs) who even know what they're doing, I wouldn't know about you, but me personally, I would pay lesser and eat at a dozen other places for half the prices for north Indian food.

Too crowded and less leg space in between tables. People (customers) literally have to push the other tables to get in and out of seats. dim lit place. even of I request the authorities tell me that they can't do it since it would be problematic to others. Asked for a spicy soup, told the waiter to order whichever he suggested. Brought me a Thai soup kinda which was tasteless. Products doesn't match the costs charged.

I have had dinner before at your restaurant. But, the kind of disgrace you have shown in not letting a person wearing simple clothes to your restaurant portrays that you don't deserve to call yourselves a fine dining restaurant. Fine dining is not just about chandeliers and food served in China plates, NO. It's about the experience you give to your costumers. Do you have a rule book that doesnot allow people wearing clothes that according to "you" doesnot qualify for the standards of your restaurant? When you provide service to someone in lieu of the money they are "ready" to pay, you should quietly just do your job. Try working atleast half as hard as the driver who was shamefully disgraced the other night, maybe then you can decide on who enters your restaurant and who doesn't.

After a long time I enjoyed food. The deviled crab, the chateaubriand steak were all so nice. We reached early for dinner so it was easy to get tables. If you are late be prepared to wait. The food is great, the ambience is like old style Kolkata restaurant. The decor and the waiters all remind you of some 70s movie scene. The wine list is not vast but will satiate your needs. Beer served in silver mugs.. A new thing.
Overall I enjoyed the time there and the bit of nostalgia helped.

How shallow and inhuman have we become ?

Last night being my last day in Kolkata decided to try out this popular restraunt called Mocambo' at Park Street .I decided to go with my driver -Manish bhaiya here whose great service and care throughout my stay in Kolkata for a week was excellent  . ( Also yesterday afternoon he missed his lunch because I forgot to tell him to go for lunch - uncertain about the time it would take me to finish the meeting -he missed his lunch ) 

Guilty of my mistake  . I decided to go out for dinner with him .

As soon as I reached Mocambo at around 8:40 PM . I asked the staff to give me a table for 2.

Staff : There is a waiting of 15 minutes .
Me : *as excited I was to try out this popular joint *happily agreed 

Staff :* by this time they observed I was with    Manish bhaiya * walked up to me and said it will take 45 minutes for the table to get ready .
Me : *little confused by time communicated *earlier ...now eagerly asked but you said 15 minutes 

Staff : yes the table was going to get empty but they ordered for more food 
Me : *peeping through the glass windows *but I can see some empty tables inside .
Staff : they are four seaters.. today is Friday we cannot give that table .
Me: ok 

After waiting for 10-15 minutes . When I see people who came after me getting the table .

Me : why are you not giving me the table ?
Staff : Maam we can't give you a table 
Me : But why ?
Staff : who are you with 
Me : subtly pointing towards Manish bhaiya .
Staff : aahhh....Maam he is not properly dressed .

Me : * he was cleanly dressed in a cream trouser and a shirt tucked out .. And floaters * 
I asked what is your dress code ?
Staff : we don't have a dress code .
Me : then ??
Staff :No No he is not properly dressed it's a fine dine restraunt 
Me : *agitated by now *what's wrong with his dressing tell me and is there a written dress code he is not following ?

By this time Manish bhaiya understood parts of the conversation in English and by the daunting looks of the staff -walks up to me and says - 'Didi hum Nahi Khaenge aap Khana Kha lijiyega na '

Me : * hurt with his innocence and inhuman inconsiderate behaviour of the staff at Mocambo *
Me : call your manager give me a valid reason why he cannot come in . 
Staff : goes and calls another person 
Me : sir why can't he come in ?
Staff : because he is drunk 
Me : *furious and baffled with the audacity of the staff *How do you know he is drunk ?
Staff : because my other colleague told me he is so 
Me : on what basis due you make such assumptions . Did he drink in front of you or did you even go near him * they were standing 2-3 meters apart *He is driving me around since 8 o clock in the morning leave apart being drunk he is not even had food 
Staff : but I know he is drunk 
Me : prove it then 
Me : what's your name 
Staff : I can't tell you my name 
Me : why ?
Staff : No No I can't it's just I can't let you in with him 
Me : I Don't want to get in to your racist restraunt walks away with Manish bhaiya with deep grief in my heart on how Inhuman and shallow the world has become :(

Manish bhaiya is one of the finest human beings I have met in a long time he took good care of me and did his duty with all his heart .He is a simple man make 275 Rs a day for 12 hours of driving and sends more then half of the money back home . he has a difficult life Still he laughs a lot shares a lot of stories and is more human and empathetic  then any I know .

To Mocambo staff and restraunt at Park Street Kolkata Which doesn't consider human as human and differentiates, discriminates  and stratifies them into classes just because he doesn't fit into your description of a perfect customer . ( doesn't own a iPhone maybe doesn't talk in English ) I m sorry you don't deserve a fine human like Manish bhaiya sitting and eating in your racist restraunt .

We chose this place for its past ratings. 
How misled were we!
With more than adequate waiting staff, we shud have been served well. 
But No. 
The boring, Out-of-fashion, Raj-Style-Pagdi-Tunic was as slow and uninterested in service as their menu.
In its "Torn-To-Pieces", Menu Card - we saw not more than 7 Tall Drink recipes. 
Yes. 
They Have No Mojito. No Margarita. No more than just a few drinks.
(Beware, the tall drinks too are only 30 ml.)

The Bekhti in Mustard sauce (not creme) is extremely/over salty.
So, do not opt for Fish-A-La-Moutrade. 
We gave this feedback to the captain. He politely ignores us! 
We ignored the Bekhti
The Peas in the veggies, small and dry-wrinkled. 
7 small strings of Pasta & some Potato Cubes accompanied it.
But a small portion of some good. 
Rice saves the day.

They do not serve bread rolls with a baked/Cheesy dishes.
And an extremely over priced Piece of Bread Roll (with 1 cm x 1 cm butter cube) is wilted and stale! 

The Chicken Tetrazzini was good and appreciable..

This Restaurant has not woken up after August 1947.

Heard a lot about this place. I wonder why I didn't go there when I was studying in Xavier's. Went there last week. Great ambience. Quality and taste of food is also unquestionable. That's why it is one of the famous and classic places in park street.

But the quantity is very less compared to the price of the dishes. One mutton item is not even sufficient for three people. Same with the Fried rice thing. Overpriced I would say. But people in kolkata have always been a little hype following. And expensive things must be very good. So Mocambo and other ambience oriented places made their fortune. But I don't like to spend my hard earned money just to sit in a quite and lovely place.

They insisted me to sit in the new segment of their restaurant. Nice place but all the staffs and waiters were standing there watching us dine. It was so uncomfortable. It was like a backstage. They were chatting and all. Sometimes looking at us and chatting, laughing.

One of them took an about to be empty 'kadhai' of Rogan josh, which had some gravy in it, out of our table without even asking if we were finished.

Very classy and sophisticated and rich people will love it. Not "masti wala" place. Not at all suitable for "matargashti" friends gang.

That day it was raining hard, so hard that we couldn't wear nice outfits and shoes. Well you can guess the kind of look I received from the staffs. 

Or, Maybe I was just having a bad day.

Thanks.

The place is famous for its sizzlers and non veg items...but it didn't meet the expectations...A strict no no for a friend group meeting..Food is very average..And the bugs spent doesn't matches up with the food delivered..It's particularly for the very traditional and sophisticated class of old families who are used to a very quiet atmosphere..But for a Matargashti gang it's a strict no.

After hearing a lot about this restaurant, finally got the opportunity to visit it with my family in the month of August. And it was food riot. I loved the ambience . I loved the decor. I was just gobsmacked with the menu and the varieties in it and the food that they served. We had devilled crab. It looked the best and tasted divine. Next we had prawn cocktail. A faultless dish. My son had Chicken Steak twice . One among that was on Sizzler platter. Me and hubby had the surf and Turf Sizzler platter. They served all with the amazing mushroom sauce. We also tried a fish item too. I forgot the name. It was good too. Lastly I ordered the Mango Alaska in dessert. It was great. The presentation was mind blowing indeed. Overall we had a great experience dining out there. Would love to go another time to try out the lobster and the tenderloin and pork steak again.

Mocambo is a food heritage @ Park Street .. Have Devil Crab and steaks .. Do not go for regular main courses .. You need to utilise the menu card you have in your hand ..

Yesterday we visited Mocambo, one of the oldest as well as famous restaurants in kolkata. Decoration was very beautiful and classy. The staffs heartily welcomed us. We tried their chicken a la Kiev, mocktails, devilled crab, chicken chipolata and tutti frutti ice-cream and the total bill was 2350. Chicken a la Kiev was excellent and buttery(as expected). Other dishes were also good. But the taste of the devilled crab, oh my God! It was heavenly good. I mean the best best best dish I have ever tasted in any restaurant. I salute the chef for creating the magical taste of devilled crab. Must visit this place who hasn't visited yet.

Most amazing food. Highly recommended for the bestest continental food this side of town. Kicked off with a haryali kebab as an accompaniment for the chilled beer. 3 fish dishes to savour and relish. Lemon crepes to end it off. 

Fish Muniere and Devil crab -perfect start to a hearty dinner. Fish a-la Diana, chicken chipolate and chicken tetrazinni to follow. Must end with lemon crepes. Amazing food and service.ť

Mocambo is One of my fvrt Place. A perfect combination of ambience and good food..the delicious word will be less to define the taste of #devilcrab..the fried prawns are the best starters to order... The mouthwatering chicken Sicilian is always in my order list....mocambo  is the best place for the continental  food lover

MOCAMBO. This name is not unknown to any bengali.
One of the legendary restaurants of Kolkata, located in Park Street.
Famous for its continental.
Last Saturday had gone there for lunch. And we tried Angels on Horseback (which is one of the notable dishes of Mocambo) and Chicken Paprika(another mouth-watering dish)
Great ambience, still holds the heritage touch. Very well managed place. Staff was very good.
No doubt it is one of the best restaurants of Kolkata and pretty sure every foodie will find this place to be paradise. Avishkar Srivastava

One of the oldest and most renowned restaurants in Kolkata, Mocambo lived up to the expectations on my first visit. The dishes I tried out were chicken cordon bleu and fish steak. Chicken cordon bleu was a revelation. The chicken stuffed with ham and cheese was delightfully succulent and the fish steak was also worth a try. The ambience was truly satisfactory and I will definitely drop in again to try the other items on the menu.

If you are a Calcuttan or if you have ever known anyone from Calcutta, chances are that you have eaten at "Mocambo" or have heard Calcuttans bragging about this, older-than-your-Grandparents, legendary eating place. We cannot write in just one post about it's awesomeness, really. So, expect lots of post on this one. Here, we have the Chicken Cordon Bleu. It's a pounded out piece of chicken breast that's rolled up with ham and swiss cheese and then fried in a breading. Once you cut open the beautiful crispy stuffing, what oozes out is tons and tons of happy calories! Cheese, ham and chicken plus the nostalgic taste of our good old Mocambo, that has managed to still make our hearts beat faster, even after so many years. Mocambo was, is & will always be, close to our heart.❤️

Park Street is mostly about food and that rich nostalgia that hits you where it's supposed to. Anyone who has been to Park Street is well aware that Mocambo is a huge chunk of that nostalgia. The decor is serene and puts diners at ease. My personal favourite is the Mutton Hamburger steak and the fish steak. Of course, every item on the menu is worth it.

the old kolkata charm serving continentals from the olden days. there's nothing that goes wrong in places like this, simply because they set the standards. expect good food and a lovely menu, courteous, well dressed and helpful waiters. also expect a good crowd and sometimes a queue outside waiting to grab a seat.

Day before yesterday we had planned a family dinner there were in total 7 of us. My father had reached there early as he headed straight from the office towards the restaurant and with him was my cousin. So, when they reached there he called us up to know by what time would we reach but due to the heavy traffic we were late. So, he requested the manager at the gate to allow them to have their table so that he could order starters atleast but the manager was so reluctant on the issue that he didn't allow him to enter even saying he would only be allowed after the whole family is here.This furiated him. This was total arrogance on his part and has was not at all sorry for their  behaviour .
Too hell with your restaurant . You guys cannot respect a customer what will you serve them .
And I have been over 50 restaurant in kolkata never seen such an irresponsible and insensible act on the part of managers.

Well as this is a one of the oldest continental restaurant /bar of Kolkata so lot of heritage food is available here.. To start of CHICKEN ALA KEIV , CHICKEN TATRAZZINE , PEPPER CHICKEN KEBAB , PRAWN COCKTAIL and DESSERTS as MERINGUE with ICE CREAM and CHOCOLATE SAUCE .. And believe me all are as good as it sounds.. All these dishes are very different and a special mention to the chocolate sauce.. I have never had such tasty molten chocolate sauce ever.. May be they make it by themselves.. But with all these good stuff there are some things to be noted as well pls don't try the fresh lime soda or the strawberry shakes.. These were awful.. No garnish and even tasted like no heritage.. All over good /different foods, ambiance good for hangout with friends or dating.. Service not that great.. may be will be again visiting for the DESSERTS... 😂 Piyali Saha hopefully this girl will agree with me..

Mocambo has become a trademark name at the centre point of Kolkata's food station, Park Street. Overlooking the ever busy pavements thronged by gala revellers , Mocambo is your answer to enjoying a quiet satisfying meal with your special one. The service I brilliant, the waiters exceptionally trained. On our maiden visit, we had the kebab platters for entres and a gala spread of Chicken Orientale, Chicken Ala Kiev, Mixed Grill, Lobster thermidor. Every item was well seasoned and pleasing to the palate. For dessert we ordered the Baked Alaska, vanilla ice cream with fruit salad and Chicken soufflé. The soufflé was a little bit of a let down, but I enjoyed the baked Alaska. 
Looking forward to visiting again soon.

Awesum ambience....the food is delicious too...
Just in my opinion they need to work a bit more on the quantity part of the food....
It would be great if the quantity could be increased since the dishes are on bit expensive side....
Overall, starting from behaviour to food to enjoyment, its a great place to have dinner or lunch with family or someone special....

It is very sad though for what i heard recently about the misbehave the management did....i just cant even imagine that the people whom i saw so well behaved and helpful just few days back was a part of such an incident....i m reducing the rating....#sad

first thing we noted was the lovely ambeince , formal yet very comfortable and tasteful .

we had a comfortable table and the service was courteous and prompt .

first things first - beer in silver ( or metallic ) mugs tastes much better - I discovered . 

the spich n cheese pillows were well made with lots of stuffing and yet  yet with a sheer wrapping that held out well. 
the fish and chicken items my friends said was yummy and the portions large enough .

cannelini was what was suggested as a must try item and i liked it

Given below is my review before the recent incident wherein a man was denied service based on his perceived position in society. Re-rated the place, because what's the point of good food if the service is this inhuman? 

"Wish these guys spent some money to spruce up the ambience. It is one thing to evoke a sense of charm but it is quite another to be miserly with your purse strings.

Oh well. The food certainly lives up to the hype. Try the Surf n Turf. Or the Tetrazzini. You will not be disappointed. Very good impressions of a Chicken Cordon Bleu and a Fish Florentine as well.

Average desserts though, with the Cream Caramel being my pick of the lot."

As shown in Kahani, cosy, quiet, dim lighting, perfect for a dine in after a long day. Their steaks are to die for, the kebabs are tasty, and they take quite some time to serve your dishes so that you have a lot of time between your meals so that you can savour your food. The restaurant's good if you have time in hand and wish for a chilling place. If fast is your speed, then this isn't your destination.

Mocambo has already more than thousands of reviews mostly speaking of its delicious food items, mocktails, cocktails and hard drinks.  I have been here several times before but at that time I was not aware of writing reviews in zomato. So recently when I went there I was determined to give a review of my experience.  We were total 8 in numbers including 2 kids.
 Among drinks , orange slush , screwdriver and hard drinks were ordered. 
Though it is famous for continental dish, for starters we ordered chicken malai kebab, chicken firdousi kebab and drunken prawns.  Only chicken malai kebab was good in that we ordered one more plate. drunken prawn was nt at al good. The prawns seem to be overfried so it was rubbery.Chicken firdousi kebab was a total waste of money and it was ordered on being suggested by the waiter. So its better not to experiment always. 
After awful experience of starters we thought not to experiment further. So we ordered the famous devil crab , fish ala diana n chicken sizzlers and they didn't disappoint us. 
My suggestions would be if you are visiting Mocambo go for the continental items as you are going to love them surely.

Visited in the month of January.Birthday treat of one of my close friends was the reason  to choose this classy restaurant unbiasedly.Experience with the touch of experiment was what ,earned.Wide range of varied dishes in continental, italian, north Indian might confuse you but the staffs are helpful enough to guide and suggest  the proper food as per taste and mood.  They took some time to deliver the food on table or we were empty and too impatient to wait was difficult to figure out. Chicken paprika was creamy and perfect, with the touch of pasta chicken tetrazzini was equally satisfying.Chicken imperial was cheesy and mushroom gave immaterial joy. For me it entered  in the list of re-visit.

Mocambo has always been that legendary restaurant in the city that can't go unnoticed when it comes to grilled meat, steaks and SIZZLERS. I ordered one grilled chicken and a chicken steak with mushroom sauce. Both of them were perfect in every way.
I had a baked alaska for dessert and my friend had a brownie with ice cream. It would recommend you to go with the brownie with ice cream if you have a sweet tooth.
The ambience is good enough, with well behaved staff and affordable delicious food.

One of the most famous, reputed, popular, wonderful and definitely one of the busiest restaurants of Kolkata.

For the people who are from outside the city, you would have seen the famous Mocambo in Vidya Balan's Kahaani.

And yes Mocambo is as good as the hype.

The meat burger, the sizzlers, the cjicken tetrazzini are just to name the few delicious dishes available here.
I have not been fortunate enough to try out the Devilled Crabs but hopefully that day is not far off.

You can never visit Mocambo just once,you will definitely come back if you get the chance.If not with the food you will surely fall in love with the ambience and the service. Hopefully that will get enhanced after the ongoing renovation.

A restaurant of a lifetime.

We ordered a fish sizzler and the waiter suggested a chicken dish for starters . The chicken preparation was good . When the fish sizzler arrived I realised that the sauce was exactly same as the one served with chicken , the staff did not change the sizzler and when asked for a different sauce they gave it on additional charge . A little disappointing experience

My boy friend and I always wanted to visit one of the legendary restaurants in town and our 1 year anniversary was the perfect occasion to do so. A legendary day at a legendary place. The place was warmly lit and the staff were extremely cordial. We had ordered Fish Ala Diana and Angels On A Horseback with a side of bread rolls and fresh line soda. The bhetki with the prawn stuffing was fresh and cream sauce was velvety smooth. The chicken wrapped bacon on the bed of risotto was moist, juicy and the bacon was done to perfection. The service was a bit slow but then the food was so delicious that it did not matter. We had a memorable day and mocambo was the icing on the cake...
I changed the rating today. Had we known this restaurant is only for richy rich people I wouldn't have stepped inside it to celebrate such a memorable occasion.

Mocambo is tradition, nostalgia, class, experiment, quality and courtesy combined into a restaurant. Our generation took the cue from the previous one to patronise it and I was seriously pleased to note that even the new generation frequents the place. The menu boasts of classical western dishes - steaks, grills, pastas, etc. For those who are used to Chili's, TGIF, etc. may not find novelty in the menu, but bear in mind that Mocambo is several decades old and one of the few western restaurants that still hold fort and is popular & busy. Try their Surf & Turf or Pork Sirloin and satisfaction is guaranteed. For starters, do try their Mutton Shahi kabab and Fish Hariyali Tikka. Cost for a couple - Rs. 1,800.

I have visited this place a number of times,don't know how I forgot to write down the review. Okay...so for me food makes me happy. And mocambo is one of the places that always satisfy my taste buds. I just love their ambiance..it has a classy look with old elegancy. Their sitting arrangements are good,the staffs are very courteous and professional. Some of my favourites are..fish aladiane,which is basucally bhetki wrapped prawn in cream cheese. Deviled crab,which is served in the crab shells...a yummy crabmeat preparation. Chicken alakiev..this is what I order everytime I visit. Chicken balls,staffed with cheese and butter inside...and the breadrolls accompany this the best. Even I find their breadrolls very tasty too. 😍😁 The paper deviled crab,whole staffed chicken roast,mutton ghost,crabmeat soup are also very delicious. Above all these sizzlers are their signature dish..chicken steak sizzler is my favorite among those. their dessert items are also lipsmucking..Baked alaska is what I always order for dessert..and it is just amazing..so hot and yummy. 😄

Just as Metro and Trams are synonymous with the essence of the traditional 'Calcutta', your Kolkata experience would remain incomplete if you don't gorge on Mocambo's continental dishes. There's a reason why some places are legendary and remain so for ages and Mocambo is one such exalted place and the reason becomes quite evident once a person dines over here. 
The moment you enter there you'll feel a bit nostalgic by their vintage & classic Calcutta decor. Basically the ambiance is serene & peaceful there. A perfect place to unwind yourself from the chaos & cluster of Calcutta.
I went there with my friends for lunch. Firstly we ordered our beers as the starter.
For the mains, we have ordered Vegetable Cannello, Chicken Cordon Ble, Pork Sirloin Sizzler, Surf & Turf, Chicken Paprika. 
The foods are undoubtedly delicious especially Chicken Cordon Ble and Surf & Turf. The Chicken Paprika was tasty yet light. Quality and quantity of food deserves to be lauded over and over again. Service was highly commendable and the person who took our orders helped us in choosing a vegetable dish as well.  
This is definitely a place made for revisits to hangout with your friends,family and loved ones.

I've been going to this awesome restaurant since my childhood . Always love dis place for its Continental delights. They serves delicious food.

About restaurant: The ambience is good enough nd has well decorated . Comfortable sofa sets,nice wall hanging,decorative hanging red lamps gve some extra spice to create a dreamy atmosphere. Service is also very good nd servers are well behaved. 

About food: coming to food,Umm!! What can i say. Continental food what thy have been expert form years. we ordered snacks at yesterday eve. these are fresh lime soda,diamond fish fry,chicken supreme, chicken sicilliene.

Nothing to say about Fresh lime soda.

Diamond fish fry- It is a complete meal i can say. Here they served a big size fish fry with mayonnaise mixed with chopped parsley,boiled vegies,cooked pasta.
Crispy fried fish was too good. Quality of bhetki fillet was undoubtedly excellent. And even cooked pasta,baked potato was also good to taste.frankly speaking Boiled vegetables was not tasty. But as a whole the platter was lovely.

Chicken supreme -must try it !! Its jst suprb. Chicken patty with two layers sauce . One of dis is white creamy mushroom sauce another one yellowish spicy sauce. Served with smashed boiled potato,boiled carrot nd peas and baked with a slab of cheese.t his was absolutely tasty.

Chicken sicilliene - its almost same as chicken supreme. Cooked chicken,mushroom,asparagus with creamy sauce and baked with cheese. Thy also served a slice of boiled egg as topping which is different from the above one.

As thy are providing good service and food quality is fantastic,prices r on the slightly higher side bt not expensive. Evening spnt well at mocambo. I'de like go there again and again. This place is absolutely perfect  for any occasion to visit with ur loved ones or family for a memorable experience.

Mocambo- the restaurant does not need any introduction to the foodies’ world. I visited there multiple times- sometimes with friends, sometimes with family, Mocambo never disappointed me; so I keep on going back there whenever I need a solid food therapy and I don’t want to take any chances. Apart from the aristocrat yet warm ambience, the mouth-watering dishes- what attach me more to this restaurant is its consistency and I think its consistency is the quality which keeps its head high even in the surges of many upcoming multicuisine food options- Mocambo has a dedicated fan-following. 
Earlier queue for getting a table was a negativity which is partly resolved after they expanded the floor area recently. Still I prefer to visit there at 12PM/ 6:30 sharp for lunch and dinner respectively to avoid any waiting period whatsoever. 
Coming to food options, cream of crab meat and cream of asparagus soups are my all-time favourite. The distinctive taste and flavour soothes my nerves and aggravates the appetite. Another must have there is ‘the devilled crab’. To have an all-round Mocambo experience- devilled crab has no alternative. One tip- you should always ask the server what is cheff’s special available for that day and you should try at least one dish from the list. On multiple occasions, I have tried Fish A La Diana, Surf & turf, fish steak, chicken steak, risotto, and off course lobster so far. All the dishes are well cooked and presented with beautiful garnishing. I have provided only 3 photos form my recent visit here. As I am stating multiple times, it’s not about only food, it’s an experience for all sensory experiences. Throughout their multiple visits, people find their own favorites from the plethora of options available.

we were confused at initial stage where to go. Peter cat or Mocambo. Finally we decided to go Mocambo and I don't regret. The ambience was fantastic. Ample space for sitting. It was very comfortable. Now comes food, We ordered Kingfisher Strong, Mango Juices, Chicken roast, Pork weener, Chicken chipolata sizzler, Mix Sizzler, Mutton rogan ghost, keema nun. All were very tasty. I loved the mutton rogan ghost. It was so tender and juicy. Mutton was perfectly boiled. Keema un was another thing to taste. It was very tasty. Only problem is food delivery time. it is bit slow. But as long as you are providing such delicious item everything can be forgived

One of the names that represent the kolkata cuisine. Continental food is what they have been expert of from years. Went for a sunday lunch and somehow got the seats earlier than i thought.
The ambience- 8/10
Service - 6/10
Food- 9/10
Coming to the pleasure of palate, we had the authentic shrimp cocktail and chicken cordon bleu. The latter, a beautiful patty of chicken and melted cheese- just heaven. The pork steak was succulent and quite satisfying. Baked alaska as a dessert- fire and ice- perfecto. I would say a must visit to know what the british culture left to fill the hungry Kolkata's appetite.

I am not a huge fan of the Park Street restaurants. Most are snob, and are using the brand value, which were made when Calcutta had limited options for a proper family dine out. But there are few exceptions. And Mocambo is one of them. 

Unlike their rude cousin, Peter Cat, serving ordinary dishes, Mocambo is a place where the servers are well behaved and at times even friendly and the food really good. 

I love their Ham steak mushroom. One dish which can make you happy everytime you order it. The Deviled Crabs are also my favourites. I always wish there were more after completing this dish. 

A good place to visit with your loved ones for a memorable dinner.

Mocambo! - what can I say... food, nostalgia and probably the best steak in town! The restaurant has now expanded, incorporating the Wine shop next door - thus lots of more seating and less queue (this was the most irritating part of Mocambo, and those who had waited hours outside would know what I am talking about). Coming to the food,

Starters:
1. Cream of mushroom soup - I felt this has now been diluted and isn't what it used to be earlier. Less of cream and more of pepper n water.
2. Pepper Crab Devilled - A must try! This is a stunning dish which tastes as good as it looks! Cheesy and spicy crab meat served inside a crab shell. What more can I say!

Mains:
3. Chateaubriand Beef Steak - 5 Stars. This is probably the best steak I have tasted in Kolkata! Contrary to most of the other places, which serve minced meet being made into a steak-sized patty, this was actually a thick slab of sumptuous beef. I tried it with pepper sauce. I would recommend Medium steak which is much more juicy and softer than well done!
4. Fish steak - Fish steak with a creamy mushroom sauce, this was absolutely tasty.
5. Fish Filipino - Fresh bhetki fillet with a creamy sauce, herbs, veggies and roasted baby potatoes. Highly recommended.
6. Chicken Chipolata - Roasted juicy thigh of chicken with sausages and bacon, this one is a classic and wholesome meal.

Dessert:
7. Cherries with cream - 5 Stars. Though Mocambo is serving a whole new lot of new dessert dishes, I still feel this one is the best. Its very unique, and the blend of fresh cream with juicy cherries is heavenly.

Overall another highly satisfying gourmet evening spent well at Mocambo! Never change 😊

As far as my memory goes Mocambo is one the very first restaurants I could relate continental food with. Back when Kolkata only had a handful of eateries serving elite Continental food Mocambo peaked the list. The retrospective ambience, smooth music and world class steak is something I associate my childhood with. Over years this restro has not faltered in terms of the quality of food and service. It still excels in providing you with vintage Kolkata treatment.
If you haven't had a chance of dining at this restro yet please mark this at the top of your priority list.
Recommendations: Must try their succulent Steaks, they come in a lot of options.
And don't forget the Sizzlers and the best Walnut brownies.

MOCAMBO.. the name itself is enough to describe grandiosity and heritage value of this age old restaurant in parkstreet.
Ambience- spread over a huge area this place is a mix of old retro style ambience with a new age touch.
And the hanging red lights add the extra glow!
Food - we went straight for main course in our last visit two days back. Ordered a fish Florentine( highly recommended) and a pork sirloin steak sizzler... both were served with lots of veggies. And both of them tasted fantastic. And I've to admit this sizzler was one of the best one I ever had. It was soft with the perfect blend of flavours and smokiness.. loved it till the last bite. And the fish Florentine has already become a star dish of this place. Soft melting fish mixed with the perfect richness of cheese and herbs gave a burst of pure soothing flavours inside the mouth with every bite.
For desserts we had one brownie with ice cream and a caramel custard.. the custard was average. And, the hot brownie with vanilla icecream was unexpectedly too good and was the best way to end the awesome lunch date! :)
Prices are on the higher side.. but it's worth it if you order wisely! Do visit this place which is perfect for absolutely any occasion.

Mocambo food just seems to have lost its touch. Not liking anything there of late. Please give it a miss for a few days until they start working on their quality and taste and not taking customers for granted. You go there to eat, not for the name only! I guess those days are gone.

Bumped into mocambo on a drizzling Sunday last.As usual full house & was given 30 minutes Que time.Thankfully my better half joined later & it was only me enjoying the drizzles on park street alone.Then ultimately got a table for 2 after 45 minutes.Nothing new to be described in terms of ambiance,interior & people.They still showcase the old world charm.However only mention able observation is that the cutlaries need to be replaced with new one since they've built in scratch marks due to continuous usage.The order was for fresh lime soda, prawn cocktail,chicken paprika & fish ala diane. All of them are their signature dishes & did justify their fame.But i somehow feel that the cocktail sauce was bit more pungent than it is supposed to be according to my taste & the bekti could have been little more well done.It was medium done for me.Chicken paprika was spell bound.We were so full that could not try any dessert.May be next time. Till then Bon apetit.

Well not my first visit, but definitely this is the first time that  mocambo was so empty as it was a weekday.. coming to the food we ordered for lobster thermidor, mixed grilled steak a la mocambo along with fresh lime soda.. and as usual the food was awesome, the cheese on top of the thermidor was melted to the best and the meat inside just melt inside the mouth.. the steak which was ordered by my friend was equally good, the chicken, bacon and the pork sausages was cooked to its perfection.. well I have been going to this place since my childhood, so lots of nostalgia with this place..

This place has a very regal feel to it. Once you step in,you immediately understand that this place has been here ruling the food scene of kolkata for a long time and will continue to be one of the best restaurants in town for many more years to come as well.
The staff was extremely courteous and inspite of the huge Sunday rush,they took good personal care of each and every table.
Coming to food, I ordered the spicy version of devilled crab. Yummilious! The biggest obstacle in the path of enjoying crab meat happens to be the shell. These people took the crab meat out of the shell,mixed it with a hell lota cheese and mushroom and put in back in the shell. Genius,right? This is one dish I'd ask everyone to try atleast once.
Mocambo deserves a pretty 5 out of 5 rating. .if not for the desserts.
I ordered baked alaska and chocolate brownie with vanilla icecream. The chocolate brownie icecream was decent,but I've definitely had better before.
The baked alaska was a treat for the eyes. Flames burning around the dessert which extinguish after caramelising the outer coat. .beautiful! The taste however was horrible. The caramelised area was more like burnt and it wasn't sweet at all except for a small area near the base. The cake they used was simple britania fruit cake that's available in the market. This dampened the whole dining experience a bit.
Even though the desserts were a disappointment,I'd go back to this place again for its food which is excellent.

A true legend of Calcutta. I guess the 'grills and steaks' say it all. But the best thing about this place is that the quality of food hasn't been affected by it's status. One can feel the texture of the food with every bite. A must visit for anybody and everybody.

I'll start with how disappointing the food and service get every time I visit this place. I have been here a number of times. As a foodie in Kolkata, that's expected. What's not expected is my general opinion about this place. It is spacious, and has a beautiful decor, but when it comes to food and service, I have kind of a mixed opinion about this place, especially after my most recent experience here.
I love a cocktail or two with a nice piece of soft beef steak, and I've tried these a couple of times here. The list of cocktails is too small here, and even though they taste alright, they offer no kick you'd expect from an alcoholic drink, even after two or three of them. The beef steak at mocambo has never been amazingly impressive. It comes with tasty sides and a gravy, but the steak itself is always chewy; they insist on serving it well done, even though I have asked for their suggestion, and also their opinion on medium to well-done steak. I have had some good chicken and prawn dishes here. In my most recent visit there, I decided to order something else - the server suggested ham steak, something I had never tried before. My partner went with their famous Surf and Turf. I have never been more disappointed with a meal at a reputed restaurant in my life. The ham steak tasted like pressed meat out of some super market store, served with leftovers from an average restaurant. The Surf and Turf was equally disappointing. The hero of the dish i.e. the beef, was well-done, of course, because even though we wanted to order it medium, the server insisted that in case of this specific dish, it tasted best when done well. The end result was the worst steak Mocambo has ever put on my plate. It was either so dry that the fibres had become crumbly, or they had cooked the steak with minced meat. Either way, we were stuck with something horribly leathery, and every bite needed to be chewed for an eternity to become soft enough to be gulped down.
The service is generally ok here. But on my last visit, I found them very slow and inattentive. When my first drink didn't arrive long after I ordered for it, I asked the waiter about it, and it seemed that my previous order had not been taken at all. This happened quite a few times that day. Also, for the first time, I had this weird trouble of getting seated at such a table that the diners at our neighbouring table could hear our conversation, and we could hear theirs. You can understand how uncomfortable it got when the diners at the table beside ours reacted awkwardly to our conversations and comments. And this table was shown to us AFTER we asked for a less crowded and less noisy part of the restaurant. On asking for a chocolate dessert, all they could suggest were clichés - brownie with ice cream, and chocolate ice-cream; while the brownie with ice cream tasted fine, it was just so boring! Honestly, I'm starting to wonder if Mocambo is, after all, the Salman Khan of Kolkata restaurants - just an overhyped restaurant with a judgmental attitude towards diners based on their clothes, appearance etc., running on a brand value it had earned a long time back, with neither good food nor proper service to back it.

In our childhood days, this was one of the handful fine dining restaurants which served authentic continental cuisine in town. Their steamy hot Sizzlers and succulent steaks, had introduced us to the continental dishes. The creamy souffle and aromatic walnut brownie made place into the dessert list of sweet tooth Bengali. After decade , still this place is a favourite haunt for foodies seeking for pukka continental dishes. A confluence of posh retrospective ambience with sumptuous food has made this place a appealing restro for all the gourmet out there in town! A must visit.

The place is one of the legacy restaurants on Park Street. I would like to call out that the service is painstakingly slow. However, the food does live up to the hype. We had ordered soup, rissoto and some kebabs. The freshness and quality of each of their offerings was top notch. The ambiance is well done and is very similar to other legacy places around. I would suggest checking out the place if you are fine with the excruciating wait.

What have you done Mocambo? How much can your business go on simply based on the name it has earned over the years? Why stoop so low and treat customers like that? Rejecting a customer and calling him a "roadsider" who was having Jhaal Muri. Such behavior is unacceptable and what it does is ruins the brand name you have built over the years. Shameful! 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                Think of Park Street and two of my favorite restaurants are Peter Cat and Mocambo. The interiors are nicely done. You might have to wait a bit to get a table, but it's worth it. 

The food is amazing. Just order the Devilled Crab. It's sensational. You're gonna love it. I also love their Chicken Pavlograd. It's a twist on the good ol' chicken a la Kiev. As they say everything tastes 'better' with 'butter', you can never go wrong with this dish. The chicken Pavlograd is just spectacular. You cut into it and the butter just oozes out of it. Yummy!!! 
Also the Fish Florentine, Spaghetti with meat balls and  Chicken Oriental A La Mocambo are worth a mention. 
Haven't been there yet? Make plans already!!

Hands down my favourite continental restaurant in Kolkata. Don't get me wrong, I do love sorse illish and enjoy Bengali food a lot from time to time and no! I am not a 'Bong' but, Mocambo has bowled me over time and again.

Their chicken paprika, mother of all risottos and cannelloni are just a few dishes that are unquestionably top notch. Not only that, this restaurant is very reasonably priced for the kind of ambience and food they provide. No wonder there almost always is a long line of patrons outside the restaurant awaiting their turn.

They are so worth it. No trip of mine to Calcutta is complete without visiting Mocambo at least once.

P.S. Alcohol here is relatively cheap as well.

Had been here today with my girl Disha Ghosh as we had been searching for some good continental food and mocambo is well known for it.We ordered the Chicken Steak and Risotto with chicken ham and bacon,the chicken steak was perfect as the meat was cooked well and the vegetables were served in the right quantity and as for the Risotto it was perfect too, a perfect blend of rice and meat.It was by far the best lunch we had in a really long time as we finished off our meal with the perfect dessert in the form of brownie with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate.The service was good, the ambience was warm and the food was perfect.All in all a very good experience.

One of the best family restaurant in Park Street. Peter Cat & Mocambo are probably two brothers.But I feel now a days Mocambo's taste has exceeded Peter Cat. Mocambo maintains its standard always and I love the ambiance of Mocambo. It gives us feeling of dining in vintage old kolkata.Chello Kebab...

But the service and behaviour of staff is very important! Customers are someone you should worship! We don't worship God by their status or something. All God are equal. But here in Mocambo I have faced several times this situation of making to wait even when you have vacant seat or allowing people coming late than us to enter first giving lame exuses like they reserved earlier or table is apprpiate for their count. Good food is important but if you don't get that hospitality then it turns you off! No restaurant can rise without good hospitality.

Its always been a vintage feeling that pops in when you check in to Mocambo.  The ambience,  interiors, perfectly lit lamp shades, very courteous staff. When we reached it was almost empty but by 8.00pm it was like bursting to capacity. 
Coming to food, we ordered beer with Chicken Steak with mushroom sauce which happens to be their speciality and mixed tandoori platter which was also equally awesome. I think I will revisit for trying out some of their other offerings.

It's a shame that I got to visit Mocambo after such a long time of roaming about the streets of Park Street for new cafes and restaurants. And now, it is one of my two favourite places in the area, the other one being Peter Cat for obvious reasons. Their Angels on Horseback, with the succulent bacon wrappings and delish chicken sausages is the best continental dish I have ever had.

Great food in a casual environment. Seating arrangement is very good. Sofas are very comfortable. Dim lighting really adds to the glamour of this place.. All in all great ambiance.
Chicken - a la Mocambo, Fish a la Diana and Devilled Crab : Simply brilliant dishes.
But what a mess they make of Chicken a la Kiev. Simply could not understand that dish.
Good service and the rest as they say is history..

Not happy with the recent behaviour in news. Anyway ur staff was volatile and not cordial enough.

If you are looking for some legendary restaurant in town for dining, then M sure you can't ignore Mocambo! This is so special and popular enough that you don't need any word for itz intro!

Located just Next to Vodafone store in Park Street,,walk toward New Market from Vodafone store, you will find Mocambo of the Left foot!

Decorations are very much perfect for family dining, dating or spend some real good time with your dear one! Dark background and table lamp hanging from wall make this restaurant really a great place to make your mood fresh!

Service is fast, Waiters are all good trained and very polite and helpful to decide your dish!

We ordered two main dish and two desserts by checking some reviews on zomato!

Chicken Paprika - In one word, the dish is just wowwww! Super fine well cooked rice, served with chicken dipped in pure cheese and mayo sauce, steamed green peas, vegetables make this dish really delicious! 4.5 out of 5!

Chicken Ala Kiev - You can't even imagine the surprise which is hidden inside of the dish, until you try this! Deep fried from outside and butter filled from inside make this dish really a special one! Serverd with steamed vegetables! 4.0 out of 5!

Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream & hot Chocolate Sauce - Believe me , this is the best brownie I have ever tried! Served with Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate sauce on top make this dessert a perfect one! 3.5 out of 5!

Meringue with Vanilla Ice Cream & Hot Chocolate sauce - This is my first time I tried any Meringue. Crispy at first and then melt in your mouth, you can feel that for sure! Served on a Vanilla Ice Cream! Hot Chocolate Sauce was served separately in a pot! You can use it, as much you want! Try it! 4.0 out of 5!

With all the food mentioned above, it cost 1.2 k approx, which I think not high enough!
In conclusion, I can say if your are fond of food of different taste and types, the Mocambo is a must try spot for you!

Till now, it was holding 4.0 rating from me, but after that incident, M changing my rating! I think this place deserves a big ZERo rating from me!!!!! Shame you Mocambo! Serving good food is always not a big deal, but such a poor hospitality to you customers should be a big shame for you!

Today's brief stint at mocambo smashed those cozy sweet childhood memories of savouring smoky sizzlers and a la keiv with my family. Gone are the days of ever smiling hosts who would immediately make you feel at home. Today's experience taught me how rude and impolite and unprofessional mocambo has become. It's 12 years after I think I went there and the stark difference from the past warmth left me astonished and angry. I think the new hosts of mocambo are more inspired by the particular MTV show host with a sharp tongue. We went today, a group of eleven for celebrating our friends birthday. It was a fault( well now it seems like it) that we didn't know that they don't allow such. We were made to seat, and told to wait for 5 mins before they would confirm us if we can just cut the cake there after dinner. After few such '5mins' and asking different people every time we got the same answer. And after some odd 30 mins when we decided the menu and was going to put our order anyway, I asked the host again about the confirmation on cutting the cake, when he threw his judgement to our face like the local goon, " we won't allow that" he said. We were so taken a back by the response, that we immediately decided to leave as we felt like we were unwanted guests. Even when we were leaving and asked him about his rudeness he was too arrogant to accept the fact and thrashed us with the same adamant reply. It felt bad as it soured my beautiful memories there. I hope it was just a bad day or a misunderstanding and would hope that no one faces situation like this again. But I would surely think twice before selecting mocambo for my next outing.

This place doesn't need much introduction as this is one of the most old and famous continental restaurant in Kolkata.
It has been my must visit place for many years and ultimately I made it few days back. Six of us went there on one fine friday night. And we ordered the following:

√ Devilled crab : This is one of the most famous preparation at Mocambo. This falls under their ' Heritage' category. It has crabmeat stuffed in cheese and mustard sauce and served in a crab shell.
This could have been great had it not smelled a bit weirdly.

√ Lobster thermidor : This is also their heritage dish and tastes almost similarly like devilled crab but served in the lobster shell. This was the best of the lot. It was really mouth watering and awesome.

√ Murg firdosibari kabab : This is not a typical kabab as it has stuffed chicken inside a chicken wrap. This was really delicious.

√ Smoked hilsa : This was a complete disaster as the amount of hilsa present in this dish was really less. It had more carrots and peas instead of fish. The taste was also nothing outstanding.

√ Chicken supreme : This had boiled chicken breast pieces and ham stuffed in cheese and served with vegetables. This was reallllyyy good.

√ Chicken a la kiev : This had one big piece of chicken fillet stuffed with butter and served with french fries. This was really awesome.

√ Nalli gosht : This was more of a main course mutton dish but this was not upto the mark. We had this with butter naan. Each plate had two pieces of big nalli with hardly mutton on it. We expected more mutton in this.

√ Meringue with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce : This was a dessert for us. This was so-so for us.

Overall, it is a must visit place in Kolkata for continental lovers but was really dissapointed with their Devilled Crab preparation. I will come back and try out their other dishes.

Mocambo needs no introduction, a sort of institution when it comes to continental food, and Anglo Indian dishes it has created a niche among Kolkatans who swear by their chicken a la Kiev and devilled crabs. I ,along with a few friends of a Facebook group had a lovely dinner there after many years. Along with the aforementioned dishes we also had a wonderful tandoori platter, beef steak and chicken chipolata. We had beer,screwdriver cocktail as drinks. Every dish has retained the old world charm and tastes just as divine.however,i noticed a deterioration in their once impeccable service.hope they do something about it.. hail mocambo!!😉

This is our 3rd visit..Nothing new or special to write about this heritage restaurant. Nice sophisticated old Kolkata ambience and mouth watering food (sizzlers being their specials) at affordable price.
We have ordered -
1.Veg.Sheek Kabab - So-so.This we ordered as starter.
2.Chicken chipolata sizzlers - It has bacon,sausages and assorted vegetables.It's simply yummy!!
3.Mixed tandoori sizzler - This is a soft,juicy tandoori based sizzler having a big piece of chicken,mutton,livers,fish, prawn and egg.The fish needs special mention - it was simply fantastic.
If you have still not been there, go there and gobble up some of their fantastic sizzlers and foods.

This is one of those heritage restaurants of Kolkata. My eating spree would have been incomplete if I hadn't tried out this legendary restaurant in Park street.

Luckily we didn't have to wait outside though it was a Sunday afternoon. I heard that this place has expanded. The interior looked quite well and had a beautiful retro ambience. The menu is quite impressive and they are famous for their quality continental dishes. 

So far starters we just ordered the Tandoori chicken which was average. Could have been better. 

Then we went on to order our main course. There is a choice of a dozen of entrées on the menu. We ordered the Chicken Cordon Bleu, Chicken Ala Kiev, Chicken Chipolata( sizzler ) and Chicken Tetrazzini. 

I personally had the Chicken Chipolata which sizzled my taste buds quite away. The bacon and the chicken was properly cooked. I tried out the other dishes as well. The chicken Tetrazzini  is one of the best dishes of this restaurant. It was lip smacking good. Chicken Cordon Bleu is also a must have for all you foodies out there. The chicken was very juicy and succulent. The only dish I didn't like was the Chicken Ala Kiev. It was very tasty but it looked like a valley of butter all around the chicken. A bad choice though.

Service was apt. The staff were very courteous. Overall I had a nice experience. It lived up to my expectations. Will be back again in a few weeks. Cheers. :)

This is one of the classic restaurants of Kolkata and though the food lived up-to the expectations, the service did not. The ambiance is nice with low lights and all. We decided to quench our thirst with the Screwdriver cocktail and Virgin Mary.Then we ordered the Chicken Meuniere as the non veg started and spinach and cheese as the veg. The meuniere was great with few potato fries sprinkled over it and I really loved it. We had to order a sizzler so we had the Mutton Steak Sizzler and Veg a la Kiev as the other main. The sizzler was good and more than enough for 2 people. We ended the lunch with Mango Souffle (which was delicious) and a Brownie. Now coming to the service, the waiters there had problems understanding what we were saying and also in the middle of the lunch we were asked to change the table for no valid reason.

Yes I am going to edit this review and say if you don't have basic human values, your food cannot be digested

Mocambo...well it is perhaps THE DESTINATION for continental food lovers of Kolkata!! :D 
The ambience is fantastic, coupled with the food, has made me induldge into them...I first visited Mocambo way back in 2010, and since then I am in love with the place!! 
My suggestion to every foodie out there is to visit Mocambo at least once, while they r in Kolkata, else surely, they will be on the verge of missing SOMETHING UNIQUE!

Mocambo. A place of very fond memories. Everytime i had food i have never been disappointed. Well the ambience is really great. I like the way they have gone about their lighting. It's dim and intimate with the ceiling hanged lamps just bright enough to see the face of the person sitting opposite to you. The staff is exceptionally polite and courteous, but maybe a little too aloof for my taste. They have done wonders with their new section. It looks really beautiful. The chairs and tables are more like american dinners. Only that the  tables have white table cloths adding sheen to them. The food. Well I feel they are one of the best restaurants in kolkata. Try the chicken ala Kiev, Tetrazzini, pork cutlet, angels on a horseback. Try any of the fish and you will be mesmerized. Their fish and crabs are a foodies delight.  Even the tandoori they serve are damn good. The beef steaks are also something worth mentioning. The irish one is the one I prefer. I had visited them two days ago, the ala Kiev had less butter than before, and the crust was a little overdone. Hopefully it was an oversight and things will be better next time. I really wanted to deduct half a point,but then the memories are too strong. So 5 it is.  And yes , dont mind the price, the food ia worth it.

We ordered chicken steak sizzler, chicken strogonoff,chicken paprika  and chicken tetrazzini. We wanted to try the famous devilled crab but it was not available at that moment. The food was good.

The place represents western ethnic features, which is very soothing.

Coming to food, I had Fish Steak, which was creamy and the best of all..
Then came the Rissoto, tried it for the first time, it seemed a bit dry not sure if it really should be..Desert specially Baked Alaska was awsome, it had a sweet and bitter flavour..
Ended with Icecream..
All together a quality time with dear ones and a different taste if your taste buds like to experiment..

Every time I come to Kolkata, it's become a habit to visit the Park Street restaurants especially Mocambo. Working through the menu, this time it was Angels in Horseback. A chicken dish with some bacon in it. The chicken was cooked well and the juices from the bacon had floen into the chicken which made it taste good. The rice contained sausages which again made it better than the simple. It may not be a signature dish of Mocambo but surely it can eaten for a welcome change. As Mocambo itself is undergoing change with its interiors, will surely go back again next time, hungry for more.

Visited the place on my birthday. Heard a lot about this and the place lived up to the expectation. Firstly the place is a vintage eating house. Secondly i always wanted to go there :p coming to the food it was really great. I had ordered fish and my girlfriend had orfered tandoori sizzler alongwith virgin mary. The staff was pretty nice and i must say they take a bit time to serve you maybe because they serve freshly prepared items. Half point taken because of the interior. I am a fan of rather brightly lighted restaurants. Cheers

Good to see Mocambo again charged up... After renovation or rather extending their property, this was my first visit & i am absolutely surprised by their commendable service & good food. Good ambience as always. The only thing that I didn't like at all is 'baked-alaska' that was genuinely horrible. Otherwise things were good & Had a great time ..

Another of those old places in Kolkata that calls for a must visit. Fortunately made it here last Saturday with a bunch of college buddies. More than the food you eat, here it's all about the charm and ambience that bowls you over. No wonder, once in, we knew our plan wasn't a waste!
A couple of my friends opted for veg due to the Saturday factor and ordered Spinach and Cheese. From what I understood, it was more of some spinach stuffing dripped in rich cheese. Their expression indicated it wasn't bad by any means! Additionally they ordered Veg A La Kiev which was more of a giant vegetable chop in appearance. Taste? It's Mocambo for god's sake!
For us non vegans, we opted for Chicken Mueniere which was surprisingly excellent in taste! For a second dish, we took the Mutton Steak Sizzler which sizzled our taste buds quite some way!
Fir dessert, we ordered Choco Brownie and Mango Souffle. 
Overall a fantastic experience in one of Kolkata's famous and premier restaurants. Care for a revisit? Ah why not? After all, "Mocambo khush kiya" ! 😉😉😉

For the inhuman treatment read in FB post! Shame.

Old - Don't think this one requires a review. My eating spree would have been incomplete if i hadn't tried out this heritage restaurant in park Street wd long queues outside their door. I learnt that they have expanded. My debut here was good. Loved the simple ambiance, the hospitality. And also compared to other restaurants these days its not overpriced. Gives you quality continental. A red dot friend of mine would always order a chicken Tetrazzini. So u may try that. Also to mention, they blend one of the best sweet lime soda :)

A restaurant synonymous with Kolkata, Mocambo is ingrained within the culinary culture of this city. Located off Park Street , it is THE place to visit if you're looking for Continental delicacies. From the Ala Kiev to the Stroganoff , from the Devil Crab to the Chicken Steak - - each and every morsel is an outwordly experience. Food quality is top-notch and staff never fails to disappoint. A 5-star if there ever was one !

All the heritage and legacy this place brings is just brilliant and makes the dining experience unbelievable. The red leather chairs and the dim lighting of the red haning bulbs. 
The menu too is super impressive with continental being their main forte. 

Murg Firdausi - its a property minced Chicken tandorri item but I wasn't too impressed by it maybe because of the lack of punch in the spices

Chicken Stroganoff - its one of their signature dishes and rightly so. Silken sauce with good amount of well cooked chicken with brilliantly buttered rice and some fried onions.

Vegetarian Tettrazinni - I loved this because it was so fresh and the cream was cery light. The flavor of the vegetables was coming through brilliantly. A little sweet for my liking though

Chilli Chicken - the boiled chicken did not do any favour to this one but the crisps 'something like a bhujia sev' they put on top made it tasty.

I have this checklist of places which are well known and legendary. Each time I visit one of these, I chuck their names off. So the next time it's the next name. Mocambo had always been there in the checklist. I had heard great things about this place but to be honest I think it is a bit overrated (or maybe not). What is really confusing about this place is that some dishes like the phenomenal devilled crab are too good while some like the chicken a la kiev, cannot be spoken for. The super creamy cheesy texture of the crab left me foodgasm ed. However,  I guess the chicken of the chicken a la kiev had committed suicide swallowing gallons of butter ( that thing was literally swimming in grease once cut open). The ham steak and the screwdriver cocktail was a nice thing I tasted.

I had heard a lot about this place and I recently went there for dinner. The ambiance is wonderful, with dim lights and cozy yet spacious seating. Staff behavior was very courteous. The food was good. We started with something known as "mutton special kebab" and it was delicious and ready to melt in the mouth. We also had their famous Devilled Crab, which was my favorite dish of the day. Cream and cheese and crab meat served on a crab shell: what's not to love? For main course we had a Spaghetti Bolognaise and a well cooked Irish Beef Steak. I'm personally not a fan of tomato flavored pasta. Hence even though it tasted good at first, it soon lost its charm. The beef was tender and flavorful and this was the first time I tried beef and I did like it. For dessert we had a Baked Alaska. This is also something I've heard of before. The interior layers of fruits and ice cream and cake were very delicious. The foam on top was soaked in alcohol to enable the flambe. I'm not a fan of the bitter taste of alcohol either. So I didn't like the exterior. But in general, this dinner made me very happy. So, thumbs up!

Though I had been here quite some time ago, I am glad to hear from my friends who have visited more recently that the restaurant has not lost its charm. 
The life of a veggie foodie is dull, they say, and though my veg steak was nothing more than lettuce and raw to medium cooked sizzler, my non-veg friends relished every bit of their steak and sizzler! 
Good place to spend lazy evenings!

The day I went to Mocambo was a very special day for me. Indeed this place had fulfilled my desire of celebrating that day with my friend. The place serves you a tinge of classiness with its dimly lit spacious ambience. We have ordered Fish Wellington which was very delicious made with Bhetki. I have delightfully enjoyed my Grilled Sizzler. Among the drinks I took Virgin Mary that was truly great in taste.

I have been visiting Mocambo since my days of toddling and it's very hard for me to criticise this establishment which is now a heritage institution of Calcutta and has given me some of my best childhood food memories(it was the place where I had my chocolate soufflé). 
Ok,fast forward to today,we had ordered the cream of chicken soup and devilled crab for starters. The soup was almost like a shorba. I found it had an Indian twist to it. Next time, I'd give it a miss. The devilled crab(one of their signature dishes) did live up to its reputation. It smelled of lovely, warm crab meat and cheese. Even though the dish is mild(in terms of spices used), it has a very good and strong flavour. I would definitely recommend it. Special thanks to our server, who assured us that there would be no broken crab shells in the dish(had faced it once before) and he did keep his words. 
Main course was chicken sizzler with mushroom sauce. It was delicious of course. If your looking for something that's not dry,then definitely give this a try. 
P.S. They have expanded and added a whole new section to increase their seating capacity. And the new toilets are absolutely spick and span. 
So here goes, food-3.5/5, service-4/5,value for money-4/5 😊

Though being a hardcore Delhite, another city which steals my heart is Kolkata..Thankfully my parents decided to settle down in that city post Dad's retirement so I get a chance to go for an annual vacation to Kolkata. And if there is one place which I never miss going to is 'MOCAMBO' ..Yes so you if you are reading this you already know my love for this place. AND IF YOU NEED TO PICK JUST ONE THING FROM THE MENU THEN IT HAS TO BE DEVILLED CRABS (Unless you are allergic to Sea-Food like my spouse)..IT IS THAT GOOD..This year thankfully I got a chance to devour the dish twice during my annual stay in Kolkata. (If you like it a bit spicy then you can choose the Pepper Crab Devilled)..Another one of my favourites here is the Chef's Special Pork Cutlet (Stuffed with Ham and Cheese)..It is a HUGE cutlet made of minced Pork with slices of Ham and Cheese at the centre. I also highly recommend the Meat Lasagne, the meat here has a hint of cilantro which makes it very suitable for my palate. My husband has tried out the Beef and the Pork Steak which were pretty good too. During this visit I also tried out the Mushroom Garlic Prawns which were amazing. Before I end this 'never-ending' review a special mention about the ambience which takes us back to the British-Ruled India Era with the authentic looking lamp shades and the white uniform and turban wearing staff..Overall a wonderful wonderful experience and definitely a place 'NOT TO BE MISSED' if you are visiting Kolkata. Before I end I would like to share why I am not giving it a perfect five, the reason being the dessert section. It is definitely good but does not match up with the rest of the Savoury Dishes..Thanks for Reading!!

I had heard a lot about this classic restaurant in Park Street, and finally got a chance to visit it. And it completely lived up to its expectations!

Mocambo is a non pretentious place, with a beautiful retro ambiance, fast service...good, knowledgeable and cheerful staff, not-heavy-on-pockets pricing and delicious food!

It is spread over a large area and has many many tables. Each table has comfortable red sofas with and its own lotus-y lamp on top of it...which is pretty much all the lighting decor there is in here, and it looks spectacular! We were three people but we were given a table of six(the only table empty that time), in a secluded room in the restaurant...which we really appreciated! Brownie points for this :-)

We ordered Chicken Chipotla Sizzler, Chicken Kebab Masala, Malai Kofta - made spicy to order along with Rotis and Naans. Both the gravies were delectable! We thought the sizzler would come with rice or noodles accompaniment, but it didn't have any...and the sizzler was less spicy...liked it all right...but not as much as the gravies! Their bar menu too, is restricted to few cocktail/mocktails and had drinks. Straight forward...which I liked!

Overall, a really great dining experience! And good value for money too! If you haven't already, you must visit Mocambo for sure :-)

Mocambo being one of the legendary Kolkata restaurants lived upto its expectations. We ordered a chicken a la kiev which was almost as good as always. I'll rate it 4/5 and then there was a fish a la Diana which was simply out of the world. I'll rate it 4.5/5 as was the fish Florentine. We also ordered baked Alaska, it was truly innovative. However the service was slow. Thus I'll recommend you take enough time in hand and visit the place and sink into the leisurely Mocambo culture. 😃

It was a rainy sunday afternoon and what better place for a get together than mocambo. Classy interiors and staff were really courteous. We ordered peperred deviled crab for starters to go with our beer and the combination was heavenly.Next we ordered chicken sizzler steak with mustard sauce which was served hot and tasted lipsmacking. For the main course we ordered chicken tetrazzini and fish ala diane which are highly recommended.
No doubt i am paying another visit soon.

We had ordered Chicken a la keiv (shredded chicken stuffed with butter and deep fried... trust me .. its lip smacking... once you pierce the piece with your fork... liquid butter oozes out and fills your plate... its a delight), Chicken orientale a la mocambo (its creamy and absolutely delicious) and Mango Alaska (ice cream scoop with mangoes, coved with egg white and set on fire). Absolutely loved the place..!

Ordered mango juice & fish kabab at starter ...both were well prepared..after finishing both the items we ordered for the main course ..fish a la Diana & chicken sizzler..both are the signature dish of this restro..well fine.. chicken sizzler is quite good to taste bt fish item has lot of excess cheese..
Service is not great..very slow..waiters are rather busy gossiping among themselves.....not up to the mark....Monisha

The roots run down to 1956 and since then mocambo has been serving  food with finesse. Being near by and not visiting them will certainly be a foodie crime. So in my 1 day visit to a friend we decided to give mocambo a visit. A sultry afternoon could not stop us from our plan . This restaurant is well located in one of the posh areas of Kolkata that’s park street and legend has it, they have been here since long.
With a royal attire and grateful smile, we were welcomed genially and asked to chose table of our liking.
The place has dim table-specific lighting and a red theme to it. The menu card however was surprisingly vast. You  literally have to brainstorm a bit to select your orders.
They have highlighted their heritage dishes with red in the menu, if that helps you.
We settled in for prawn cocktail, Italian garlic prawn, angel on horseback, chicken sicilliene 
Prawn cocktail – this is first of a kind I had that day. Looked really simple and served in a metal cocktail cup. Fleshy prawns dipped in thick cream and Mayo viscous mix. Had a good balance of sweet and sourness to it. 1 would be enough for 2 people.
Italian garlic prawn – 
This was certainly the disappointment of the day. Garnished with grated fried potatoes this had nothing Italian about it. A simple north Indian garlic prawn. 
Angel on horseback-
 Fillet of chicken wrapped with bacon, served with rice and fries. The bacon and chicken were cooked rightly and certainly bacon as in angel will ride you to your craved divine feeling when you chew with Chicken.
Chicken sicilliene – 
Breast chicken sautéed with mushroom and asparagus dipped in cream sauce and backed in cheese. To all cheese lovers out there .this is it for you if you are craving for some cheesy meat with no spice factor. It will swoon you over its creaminess. It was accompanied with oddly cut carrot and some peas.
Service was quick enough and commendable. 
Unfortunately we had no space left with us to try out the must try baked Alaska as suggested by everyone. Maybe next time ...

Finally had the chance to visit this legendary place. Ordered devilled crabs, chicken chipolata and chicken orientale ala mocambo. Devilled crabs were nice and cheesy. Chipolata had sausage, bacon, chicken roast, grilled potatoes n tomato, bolied peas n carrots. Meats on the dish were too smokey for my taste otherwise cooked to perfection. The orientale was as promised - buttered rice with conti-oriental gravy with deliciously juicy chicken chunks and mushroom. Would love to visit again :)

It was my bday and my husband decided to take out for dinner that evening. We decided upon Mocambo by chance as I wasn't too cheese friendly!! When we arrived around 7.30 in the evening, the place was quite empty.. And by the time we had our starters, oh boy!! It surely was a crowded place. 
Since it was just the two of us, we didn't really order many items, in fact, we just ordered a soup, risotto & tetrazzini. Since it was a Tuesday, so the choice was veg. 
The environment inside was warm & cozy, a typical place for a perfect dinner date. The food was delicious although I don't enjoy Italian much!! But there, I thoroughly enjoyed the risotto. So next time I visit that place again, I will make sure it's not a Tuesday 😄

Mocambo, is one name we can associate with the heritage of calcutta... this place speaks of the colonial Bengal and food here is just lipsmacking. Continental food in calcutta as good as mocambo is very few still now. Devil's crab, chicken ala kiev, angels on horse back are just a few to name... every dish is worth a try here.

So I am really fond of having dinner at park street, mocambo was in my list for last few years finally yesterday night was the day..... So the ambience was similar as peter cat specially the look and feel, family environment... This place is famous for there continental dishes when I was a kid my favourite was CHICKEN AL KIEV... A piece of chicken with butter all inside it.... The dishes which we ordered are CHICKEN PAPRIKA the chicken is served with tjis yellowish rice which tastes really good... CHICKEN ORIENTALE ALA MOCAMBO.... White rice served with chicken peparation which tests a bit sweet but was good... A new dish CHICKEN CORDON... A fried huge piece of chicken leg stuffed with cheese and ham... Mouth watering. This was about our main course in starters we had FISH FINGER.... And GIMLET a cocktail with imported gin.... All pver experience was really nice and pleasant

Heritage mentioned items are their signature dishes
Indian cuisine not up to the Mark
Tried Dal Makhani and Malai Kofta
Breads are fine
Tomato soup is good
Asparagus soup is average
Paneer Tikka is good

The list of legends in Kolkata in the restaurant business is quite lengthy and the list is incomplete without this one. Surprisingly, I've never been to this legend, so to visit this place was right in my bucket list, for quite a long time.
Last Saturday, my group of "jegree" friends, my missus and I finally visited this place.

Location: it is located adjacent to tongfong.
Popularity: well its a legend and the perks for them and perils for foodies like us, is that you go in the prime time or miss your chance by even 10 mins the waiting time will be 1hr at least.

Ambience: Typical, old world, carpeted floors, high walls and comfortable plush seats n sofas accentuated by soft warm yellow dangling lights over the table and the vibrance of fellow foodies puts in an impeccable ambience for dine in. Rating: 4/5

Service: Attendants and stewards are lazy, moving at their own predefined pace. We even had to ask them several times to fill our glasses with water, to provide the fork or the spoon etc. The service time of the dish right from ordering is pretty high.
Well, let's just say it's not just their strongest point. Rating:1.5/5

Comfortably seated and updating our Facebook statuses and post taking our mandatory selfies in the restaurant, we were attended by a steward. We were 4 hungry souls and had almost pre decided our respective poisons and hor d'oeuvres. We ordered a crab meat cocktail, a pepper crab devilled and upon suggestion from the steward a chicken meuniere.
They took eternity to arrive and in between we started and almost finished on our drinks.

Pepper crab devilled: ahhh, this was my choice. I had my 1st devilled crab in one step up and from that time I had been in love with it. It is the same devilled crab dish only with tinge of pepper sauce in the creamy cheese filled belly of the crab. It is delicious. Though I might say,many ppl will not like it cause it has a smell of its own and it's not at all spicy as the menu claims. Rating:3.5/5

Crab meat cocktail: the age old favourite of kolkata, a cold starter. Served in a steel pot, morsels of crab meat swimming rather dumped in a creamy goo of mayonnaise, tartar sauce. The sauce tasted nice, however, the presence of crabmeat was seriously doubted. Rating: 3/5.

Chicken meuniere: This dish was nothing short of a revelation. Shredded pieces of chicken served in a thick molten cheesy base garnished with tiny pieces of mushrooms and shredded fried potato, was the definition of delicious. The chicken was so tender and the cheesy base tempered to the perfect point, that they melted into arms of one another, like long lost lovers and it tasted nothing short of a creamy heaven, in each of our taste buds. The addition of fried shredded potatoes was icing on the cake to the dish. It was so good, that we repeat ordered it. Rating 4.5/5.

While finishing our entrées and the poisons, we ordered our main course. I went with sizzler: chicken chipolata and one of my friend with a pork sirloin steak. My missus ordered a fish Florentine and my another friend zeroed in on the house favourite: fish ala Diana. Again it took ages to arrive. But eventually it did, one by one!

Fish Florentine: it looked like baked valley of cheese served in the glass vessel. I had few scoops from it. It tasted essentially cheesy and the spinach ensured for me not to indulge in it anymore. My wife though tried to enjoy it but kept on whining about her choice of food. Her rating: 2.5/5

Fish ala Diana: my my, if anything looked seductive that evening, it was this dish. The sauce had a reddish tinge to it and tasted yummy. The bhteki was stuffed with prawns and together with its awesome sauce it was a knockout. My friend was delighted by this dish and I concurred the same. Our rating: 4/5

Pork sirloin steak: the dish arrived with its complementary sizzle. A premium slice of pork meat cooked to perfection, served with sauted veggies and a gravy on top. Though I'm not a pork lover, I had a few bites of it and it tasted nice. My friend enjoyed every bit of the dish. His rating: 4/5

Chicken chipolata: it looked an absolute beaut when it arrived. The dish is a hearty piece of chicken grilled to perfection and served with sausages, buttered potatoes, onion and unwanted veggies. The chicken was tender and juicy and the gravy on top increased its taste. The dish was sizzling hot and okay for me, nothing out of the ordinary though. Rating: 3/5.

After this we decided to have a baked Alaska as dessert. Again it took ages to bake the Alaska ;) and then serve it.

Baked Alaska: they light the dish with fire and serve it!! It looked amazing. Digging thru the burnt fruity outer cover and reaching its Alaskan core was a delight for us. The cold ice cream mixed with cake and the outer core was just heaven in our taste buds. We four even had a fight over our share of the Alaska. So we reordered another one. Rating 4.5/5

Looking back at the logs of that evening, I must say, at some parts mocambo showed it's touch if genius and at some parts it was pretty ordinary!! But then, it's a legend at the end of the day with atleast 15 ppl waiting in queue even at 10 PM.
Overall rating:3.5/5

PS it cost us 4.5k

I've never had a bad experience at Mocambo till date. The price-quality ratio has always been excellent. I've been coming here for over 4 years now. The fish muniere, mushroom sauce risotto, and pork cutlets are all highly recommended. I always come here for comfort food and so far they have never messed up. I'd give it a 4.5 rating if it wasn't so crowded all the time.

Mocambo close to bharat petrolbunk and just Next to Tung fong.....has a beautiful set interiors and well lit hung lightings all over the seating area.The sofa was soft and comfy which makes us settle down & the place is calm with loads of people who chat with a glass of either a wine or a Beer Glass.The menu is Vast with loads of items to choose from. We ordered for Reshmi malai kebabs which was nice and succulent & the spices were flavourful, then comes the meat balls with Pasta in a tomato based sauce which was blank did'nt like it much though.Then came in the Beef Stakes with boiled veggies was okayish......could have been better.Then finally ended up with the dessert.....Mango mousse....which was Yum...If u had to dig in you will find fruit cuts with mangoes inside...tastes great. Its more of a decent family Restaurant where we go out & dine in to have a Peace of mind or to relax ourselves....but mind u.....its not like any other normal restaurants where budget matters.....Its a highly expensive restaurant where you can go once a month...Overall for the lush interiors i will rate it as *4 STAR.....The dine in experience *3 STAR.....and for their Service i will give it  * 4 STAR. So  sure go ahead and try out  their food if you have not....no issues but thats upto your budget....Happy Dine in.

Mocambo- the legendary place that still maintains the name and fame till date. It's not just the food or the ambience...it's beyond that.
If you haven't been here, then better be and I am sure you will go back again. This place is perfect for every occasion.
Service: can get slower at times when the place gets crowded.

My favorite: Pepper crab devilled, Chicken steak with mushroom sauce sizzler and Grilled chicken. Dessert: Baked Alaska but I would suggest the Mango Alaska which is seasonal.

Looking for that classic Park Street feeling? You will get it here.

Mocambo is one of the old time favorites in Park Street Area, restaurants have come and gone, but Mocambo holds its place of pride in in the culinary map of Kolkata. I visited with friends after many years and was happy to see the same old world charm, smartly dressed servers, reminding you of the days of Raj. Also good to see they have added another dining area on the same floor.  On Friday night, the place was full and buzzing with energy. We were  promptly seated and ordered the following

Mushroom Garlic Prawn
Spinach and Cheese pillows

Nalli Gosht

Vegetable Begumbahar
Roti
Butter Nan
Beer and fresh Mango juice.

My friends enjoyed the non-vegetarian dishes and also praised the vegetarian ones.  I personally liked the Spinach and Cheese Pillows a lot that was a bit heavy on the Cheese side and totally justified the name.  The drinks were at the right temperature to consume and I am glad there was no ice in the Mango Juice to dilute it.  The vegetable Begumbahar was liked by all of us and it had very good consistency, aromatic gravy and perfectly made.  
Due to heavy rush, the service was a bit slow hence the rating of 4. Even when we came out of the place at 10:20 pm in the night there was a long waiting outside, that kind of speaks about the popularity of the Mocambo.

A very good place to have continental food. They have a good mixed menu covering north Indian, chinese, continental, beverages etc. The service is good.The ambience is very dull and old it needs to be changed into a cheerful one. Food is very good in taste and presentation and has value for money . It's very traditional in their food and ambience . It's famous for its great sizzlers and continental food . Overall its a good experience.

We had heard of the place from a number of people but it proved to be a complete opposite. We went for lunch and it was quite hot outside. 3 out of 4 of us had arrived but they denied us a table till all 4 were available. Waiting for 15 mins in the heat, even when tables were available, was enough to make us pissed off. When we got the table we ordered soups, spinach & cheese pillows, sizzlers and veg surprise. The place disappointed us with all 4 dishes. Abysmal way of welcoming your customer along with below par taste of food is what can destroy a restaurants customer experience. It has to be the last visit by all 4 of us to this place - with Pulkit Bansal, @Bhavana Surapaneni, @Mukul Jain

There are very few restaurant in Kolkata which serves CLASSICAL Continental cuisine. The best one out of them is definitely Macombo. 
We visited Mocambo last Monday afternoon. We were seated immediately which was a big plus. 
The ambience was amazing, every table had a personalized hanging lamp, very very classical. 
Our order consisted of -
¤ Pineapple blossom
¤ Beer
¤ Peshawari kebab
¤ Spinach and cheese pillows
¤ Veg surprise
¤ Chicken Paprika
¤ Fish A la Moutarde
The food was good. 
The two starters were amazing. 
Out of the 3 main courses the best was without no doubt Chicken paprika. 
Nice experience, do try the place out if you haven't and write down your experience in the comments below. 
Happy dining.

A true classic, with the food either good or always great ! The menu is simple, straight forward and has enough variety to really keep you coming back for more and more ! 

The beer tankards add a nice twist of heritage and I wonder how they maintain the service staff uniform in this day and age ! 

Though there almost always is a wait, the staff at the gate are always courteous and accurate in telling you how long you have to wait. I hate to be told 5 minutes and then wait for 45 ! 

Too many classics to really list, but the Sizzlers and the tutti fruity completely work for me ! Oh yeah, have to mention the steak !

Another one of park streets favourites, mocambo is again one of those places where people go, wait in line and get in for the good food. Service is prompt and the servers are helpful and friendly. 
We ordered a host of things which included spinach and cheese pillows which was light, fluffy and cheesy, their recommended fish ala Diana and recommended chicken speciality. In today's world where we have more and more restaurants opening and experimenting with food, these guys are holding up with their very old classic flavours. The chicken was okay but the fish was absolutely yumm, a big recommendation.
When you're at mocambo you simply must have their baked Alaska, a desert which contains fruit and ice cream, covered with an egg white, brandy added on and flambéd. More exciting than the taste is the theatre with which the desert is served. We also ordered the Everest desert, which didn't look much, but tasted yumm.
Park streets favourite, will definitely keep coming back for more.

I don't think Mocambo needs any review. It's loved by most Bengalis and has been around since 1956. If you are a true Bengali then dining in Mocambo once in your life is a must. Well, this is my first time there with my family. It was a nice experience 👍 👌 We ordered devilled crab and fish kebab as starters. For main course we ordered pork sirloin steak, ham steak & betki fish steak. The ambience was nice & retro. The food was tasty and filling. Overall a very nice experience. A perfect place for some quality family time :) :D

There are few places in all of Kolkata that are more popular than this one here. And now I know why is it so. The food is delicious, obviously. The tenderloin lives up to the name. Chicken a-la Kiev, needs a special mention.

One thing that I'd definitely suggest is the the cold salad with ham. The generosity with cream at this place was what caught my attention the most.

Kolkata's park Street gets its identity from these vintage places and Mocambo happens to be one of them. 
There is a rush every evening so I'd recommend you keep buffer time. Excellent variety and taste of food. Drinks are very basic and prices that will keep you happy.  
Must lay your hands on the  must have recommendations in the menu, they are worth it.

I had went there like 8-9 years ago with my family and we use to eat devilled crab. It was my favourite.
After so many long years I went there today.
We had of course the "devilled crab" ,"Angels on horse back" and "Tuna fish crepes" and my date had a beer.i wanted to have the baked Alaska but we were totally full.so It was an amazing date.
And the foods were really tasty.

There tandoor items are something special and even though I'm not a big fan of veg dishes but the baby corn  florentene and paneer butter masala are really good. The only issue with this place is the quantity of certain dishes apart from that it's a must visit place specially because of it's ambience.

I had been to mocambo several times,but after the racism post on fb,i too want to share mine.
The last time i went along here,i was  in tracks .The waiter did make me wait for about 20 mins,i was astonished and i asked why??
They told tables reserved,and i accepted their mark.
On entering i was to discover,the tables were half empty.
I ignored the fact for i was in a merry mood and didnt want hassle.But now i realise,that day even they were actually having a problem for me to enter coz i was in shorts.
Its not a club that u need a dress code,and if yes,your restro do have some rules,DO MENTION IT OUTSIDE.
Watever so,the manner u acted with mohan bhaaiya is very pathetic. :(

Mocambo's ambience is definitely great. As for the food, the Chicken A La Kiev is one of the best dishes to have here! Also, the Mutton Peshawari Kebab, ordered on their suggestion, was splendid!

Very nice interiors and ambience. But having that in mind the glasses they give are really cheap in looks. Both for water and for soft drinks. Very ordinary in looks. The beer mug is just apt for the environment.
Costs can be a little less but variety that is offered is excellent. If you love continental go for Mocambo. 'Khush to hogai'.

Really mocambo you have shown your true colours today. Let me ask you something, who the f**k are u to decide whether a person is rich or not? When you do not have a dresscode, then you do not have any right to not let a person enter your so called 'fine-dine restaurant' because of his/her outer appearance. People of Kolkata used to take your name proudly as one of the oldest restaurant of this city but from today onwards, you will be known as a misbehaved place where you are ready to take in rich people's shit but not a common man's love for food (which is pathetic in your place btw)

Mocambo is a very reknown restaurant in parkstreet area, better to say in any bengali foodie's mind..it was in my wishlist of zomato from the very beginning.
It is actually situated beside Tung Fong.
Ambience is very nice...vintage type...it obviously has some feel good type treatment..in the weekend a long queue used to wait outside,so try to avoid usual time..
Coming to the food...we ordered one chicken kabab with hard drinks and keema nun with mocambo mutton...all food quality were superb...this time we tried some offbeat dishes..but mocambo is popular for continental food basically..Will try it next time..

Devilled crabs of Mocambo will be my one last dying wish of ever be.
Also worth a mention are their betki muniere, fish a la Diana, sizzlers and the steak.
My only wish is that the waiters at park St stop waiting for tips.

So we decided to have our office party tonight and bang on came up this legendary stalwart

Even on a friday they could easily sneak us in and we were lucky to get a complete isolated enclosure

The staff as always were ever cordial and brilliant and so were they pretty well versed


Angels on horseback
Cordon bleu
Pork sizzler
The beef was perfectly medium rare and the mushroom sauce was like bonus

Each of the dishes were perfectly blended and the service was top notch

And u have that classic cult parkstreet feeling if u are down here

Teal mocambo
If u are reading this, its a brilliant hi5 from me to u

A fine experience. Very nice decor, well mannered staff. This is the 4th time I've visited this place.

Coming to the food, amazing in taste, but the quantity i must say is less given the amount they charge.

We ordered prawn in garlic herb sauce which was okayish, then chicken cordon bleu it was very good with the cheese stuffed in with the chicken breast, then angel on horseback was a brilliant dish. Coming to the main course, we ordered a pork sirloin steak, grilled tandoori platter, Irish beef steak and a chicken Tetrazzini.

The Pork sirloin steak was the best of the lot, the pork was tender and juicy, the beef was cooked medium rare & with mushroom sauce it was nice, however it became difficult to chew with time. The grilled tandoori platter was good and had a good VFM. The Tetrazzini was was decent, have had better ones at One step up!

Overall quite a pleasurable experience, and must increase the quantity to take it to the splendid level!

At the place right now and my initial reaction would be this place is overrated. The ambiance is good but they cram you in these very small seating. The restaurant is fairly  empty still they do not seat you comfortably. The staff is very cold and does not respond and is not attentive. The waiters...

An unplanned visit to this place on a late rainy afternoon here. Drenched from head to toe. Maybe that is why the staff were rather cold or maybe it was the chill of the ac working on my wet clothes.
The front desk guy was a little cold and was way too hesitant to provide a better seat or rather a more preferred seat even though the entire restaurant was empty.
The decor was the usual old school furnishing that most of the legendary restaurants in park street offer and bank upon. A little clumsy and crowded but this being one of the finest places as per public opinion, you cannot really say its bad else it would be taken as offensive or more like a sin.
Ordered a Chicken Tetrazzini and a beef steak. The tetrazzini was nice when you take the first bite but becomes too cheesy and mundane if you have more than a small portion. At least 3 people should share it or it will be more like a cheese goulash overdose. Now the steak was where they offer you a lot of customisations. A well done one with recommended sauces etc was opted for and it was more like an Indian Curry edition steak though I am not really complaining. It did taste well and different from the standard steak.
I wanted to visit this place since sometime but the overall experience was a little on the southern side of the scale. Maybe i was expecting much more than I should have, much like my parents do!
But then next time maybe they make it up.

Yes, that's what I have rated this place, not for the food, but for the service we have received here. I was awestruck by the way the waiters behaved with me and my friends. 

I am a regular at Chili's and used to the service I get there. Maybe Mocambo should send the people tending their tables to Chili's so that they can learn something about customer servicing. 

The waiters will not even lean forward to pour water in our glasses. They did not come once to ask whether we need something. Frankly guys we spend thousands of bucks on clothes and spend our weekends boozing at Chili's. We can afford your service. Yeah, we were not in our Sunday best. But, then again we did not think we would have to dress like Queen Elsa to get a decent service from the Mocambo waiters.

This has been in my bucket list for quite sometime as this is one of the "heritage" restaurants in Kolkata. At last went yesterday evening for dinner with full family.

Talking about the decor, white walls decorated with lamps and artificial creepers. Orange bulb Lamps hanging from the ceilings and also the ceiling is decorated with orange works. The mirror glass work on on the partition walls is beautifully done. Overall decent ambience.

Staffs are very cordial and helpful. Patient and suggestive.

Prawn Cocktail - Just loved the preparation and the gravy which was served along with the prawns.
Devilled Crab - Crabmeat speciality in cheese and mustard sauce served in the shell from which it came - This is also very good in taste.
Murgi Firdosi Bari Kebab - Good one again.
Chicken Chipolata Sizzler - Chicken Grilled and Served with sauteed onion, sausage, bacon and buttered vegetable.
Grilled Chicken Sizzler - The chicken was nicely cooked.
Peas Polau - Found it bit too oily.
Chicken Curry - Nice gravy
Chilli Fish
Tandoori Roti

We were looking for Chicken Fried Rice instead of Peas Polau, the server himself suggested not to try their Fried Rice as it would be disappointing compared to other preparations.

Overall Experience - Mocambo (read Mogambo) khush hua! ;)

I have always related laid back Sunday afternoons to Mocambo. Maybe because those have been the occasions I have dropped in here the most. The idea of gathering up a bunch of friends or taking your family out to lunch on a Sunday afternoon to Mocambo is quite comforting isn't it?

There are many many dishes offered by the Mocambo kitchen that I have loved, but a few that have managed to stay on my top list are the chicken paprika, the chicken ala Kiev, fish florentine and the tetrazini. The North Indian food does not do much for me , neither do the desserts. The only saving grace on the N.I side of the menu are the kebabs.

Over the last many many years, the place has been catering the same level of food. While that is a good thing, there is also a tad bit of a concern where younger participants in the market are gearing up to leave you behind in you own game. Somehow the flavor of the dishes have taken a dip and that is a bit disappointing for Mocambo Patrons, if you are not absolutely blinded by its nostalgic glory.

One of the best places to have a mind blowing meal.
Do start with the crab soup along with devilled crabs, a signature dish.
Move on to the main course with fish Florentine or Tetrazzini.
The Tetrazzini is very different from other places and is a must have at Mocambo!
This place has friendly staff members and service might be delayed due to a large number of customers present.
I'm sure the food is going to compensate for that.

One of the best vintage places in Kolkata for continental food. There's usually a 5-10 mins waiting time as the restaurant is on Park Street and the place is usually crawling with people, be it week nights or weekends. 

The service may be a tad slow but the food never disappoints. The food prices are reasonable and the cocktails are interesting. 

My reccos: Devilled Crab, Fish Florentine, Fish a la Moutarde, Fish a la Diana.

A true foodie knows that the parkstreet area is the hub of some of the most fabulous and well known eateries & food chains present in the city. Mocambo will blow u away on your 1st visit & continue to amaze you on all your further meals here. I was really impressed by the overall quality of the food. It is surely top class.

Reviewing Mocambo (a heritage restaurant of Kolkata situated at the heart in Park Street) is itself an honour. Located on Park Street Free-school Street crossing. What it serves is absolutely mouth-watering finger licking continental food. Don't even try ordering for anything except continental. For starters go with the Prawn Cocktail, if you wish you can try crab meat cocktail as well.The spicy tuna fish dip with garlic bread is also worth a try.But their all time favourites are Devilled Crab, Pork Chops, A-la-kiev.

Park Street e khabo equals Mocambo te khabo!! Which in English means Park Street = Mocambo.

This restaurant is responsible for introducing conti dishes in Kolkata. The exquisite dishes like devilled crab, prawn thermidor were introduiced by them. We had no idea such dishes existed before Mocambo!
The place is frequented by celebrities, and the ambiance is very family friendly. There's a queue outside every weekend.
Dishes to try: Chicken Ala Kiev, Prawn Thermidor, Devilled Crab and Pork Chops.

Reviewing Mocambo (a heritage restaurant of Kolkata situated at the heart in Park Street) is itself an honour.
The ambience is a dim light dining, with variety of food and liquor on offer. The seats are comfortable cushioned sofa like laidback chairs. The staff are quite hospitable and keeps their good ear on their customers. The thing I felt lacking was maintaining the neatness of the table, cutleries in proper position when adding them up and attention to the basics like serving water, refilling water or be it removing plates at a better pace and swiftness. All seemed a bit haphazard.
The food no doubt was a tickle to the tongue. I tried the cream of Crabmeat soup, which was flavoursome and well balanced but the chunks of crab missing, which will be very much sought by any customer. The crabmeat had released and were more like small threads over the soup, which is good but chunks of Crabmeat are always desired.
Then I had a wonderful preparation of the mutton kebab, which was well cooked and smoked. Loved this.
Then moved on to the Angels on Horseback dish, a heritage dish here. Chicken wrapped in bacon with saucy rice and some pasta. Amazing deal on a plate. It tickled my tastebuds, with a light tangy flavour in the rice. Loved this.
Then moved on to yet another heritage dish, Fish a La Diana. Bhetki stuffed with prawns, the simple thought of it excites a bong. Amazing balance of the preparation, the cream was well suited to the entire dish. Loved it.
Then moved on to the Pork Sirloin Sizzler, this I thought could break the bridge...but it was just another Sizzler on the table. Liked it. I missed the Yorkshire Pork Chops, which on enquiry they said they have stopped making it. Phew!
Lastly the Baked Alaska, a dessert of a kind. Very famous and resembles a French dessert. The alcoholic base enabling the flames on the edges. On top was the marshmallow, inside of which was the vanilla ice-cream, inside of which were fruits and nuts, walnuts. Amazing this...thoroughly admired this innovation.
All in all, a must go and worth the wait for your turn to step in. :)

Mocambo!! (main) Khush hua. :'D This place being on my list for long, had a chance to be here. The moment you enter this place, the feel you get is of a classy and elegant place. The interior is extremely calm and cozy. 
In terms of food this place has a lot to offer. Mostly specialized in main course from a variety of cuisines is a great place to dine in. 
Our order was on the continental side which comprises of Chicken Cordon Bleu and Fish Wellington. Just an info, be prepared to exercise a bit more (if you do) because of the amount of calories you'll accumulate after having both these dishes together. The Fish Wellington is a fish preparation with beckty fish cooked with mushrooms, pasta and white sauce and covered with a thick layer of cheese. The moment you have the first gulp of this, you'll be able to feel the taste, creamy texture of this dish, and trust me it's worthy. Next on to the Chicken Cordon Bleu. It's a chicken dish have crusty covering inside which filled with chicken, ham and whole lot of melted cheese served with caramelized pasta and boiled vegetables. A must have in the house. To end it up with the desert we had the Mango Souffle. The creamy texture and chunks of mango just melts in your mouth.
The service disappointed me a bit, but anyway it was good. So if you want to be here just go ahead with your decision, you won't regret it.

One of my old time favourite. They have recently added some more space but still you would have to wait a bit before getting a place. Such is their repute of cooking up good quality Kolkata Park Street continental food. A must have is their devilled crab - lovely crabmeat in cheesy white sauce just heavenly for a cheese lover. The hors d' oeuvres is a platter of 6 signature appetisers ( my favourites being prawn cocktail, tuna salad, chicken mayonnaise salad, ham with cheese and pineapple). Have been to this joint  umpteen number of times and always want to go back for more. Also a fan of their dishes like Prawn Thermidor, Like a neat fish, Surf & turf, Chicken a la Kiev, Pork cutlet and Baked Alaska. I can just go on and on. A must visit for any foodie. Their quality and taste has remained the same for ages.

Finally made a visit to this legendary restaurant of Kolkata. Ordered Bloody Mary for beverage. Tasted extremely bitter, sadly. So had to request for a change. Next time was okay, but not upto the mark that I had the same cocktail at other legendary places. Moving on, Devilled Crabs was served as the starter. Oh it was creamy, craby and heavenly. Can't forget the first spoon even now! For the maincourse we ordered Angels on Horseback. The risotto was cooked well with the salamis. The minced chicken balls tasted great too. The bacon was good for some sides and slightly undercooked for others. However, the platter tastes good and definitely worth the price. Next was the meat lasagna. Extremely cheesy for normal people and heavenly for cheese lovers. Oh yes, I loved it! Although I felt the layer of meat to be thicker. We were suggested to take a bread roll with it, that was served with a cube of butter. That was felt tad unwanted as the butter wasn't molten and application and stuff was a hectic thing then.
I better not comment on the decor. The ambience gets set up right as you enter there. The person who took our order could be a bit more amicable on his hospitality quotient. However other people were really very helpful.
Overall, a great experience for a foodie like me. Would love to visit the place again!

I asked the waiter to suggest me something good to drink and he responded that it's there in the menu and it wasn't very welcoming. 
Food was good - Devil Crabs, Fish Florentine and Chicken Kababs. 
3.5 stars - because of the service.

We planned for a lunch and blind option was Mocabo. I am not much aware of mocabo as it was suggested by colleagues. We were welcomed by smile and got table right after we reach restaurant. 

We have ordered Devilled Prawn which was very yummy!!! we were delighted with the taste. Fish a la dine was delicious... we were in paradise with the feel when we were having it... Then we have ordered Ristoo, Fish florentine and tandoori mixed grill. Ristoo was very different as I never felt that taste ever, ish florentine was very enjoyable and Tandoori mixed grill was just awesome. We ordered screw driver for a munch. Totally enjoyed the lunch. Thank you mocambo for such lovely dishes served to us. Worth spending. A big cheers :)

Had a lunch at Mocambo today with my friend.It was an awesome experience.The ambience was calm and serene and nicely lit with lanterns overlooking the tables.The food was delectable as well.We began with the trademark Italian dish Chicken Tetrazzini and the Russian dish,Chicken Pavlograd which is a modification of Chicken Ala Kiev,another speciality of Mocambo.Both were mouth watering and tickled our taste buds.Next we ordered Fish Ala Moutarde, which is a fish preparation with mustard sauce,along with pasta and buttered rice.It was good,but not perhaps their best..We ended our course with Baked Alaska,one of the most attractive desserts in their kitty.The dessert too was excellent,with a hot coating outside and delicate ice cream and nuts inside the filling.Overall,The experience was very nice and I would highly recommend this restaurant

Went to Kolkata and checked reviews about Mocambo and went there for Sunday lunch. Since reviews were mostly great so had a good waiting for 30 minutes before we entered the Restruant. Post that we place our order and to our surprise the wait didn't end as the order was served after an hour. Sorry to say but wait was not worth the food. I mean to say that the food was not really special as described by on zomato. Maybe as per local standards it's really good however I've had much better food compared to Mocambo. I will say this that the price was not much so it was not heavy on the pocket.

Was at this place with great expectations as it was in my wish list from a long time, but this place didn't impress me much as per food served to me. 
I ordered devilled crab which was really good and was as per my expectations and I ordered murg fidosi kabab, beckty bell meunie, chicken fried rice, nalli ghost and stuffed tandoori chicken masala. The kabab and fish was good but not so good. But the worst was the nalli ghost and stuffed tandoori chicken masala this dishes were pathetic which were suggested by the captain. 
The chicken masala had minced chicken leavers in it which tasted yaak. Even i had been taking medicines from that night. The 3.0 rating only for devilled crab. For me peter cat is much better option than mocambo.

There's not a compliment new to add as a description to what this place offers. It's still got the settings of the old world Kolkata of the colonial times. I'm a fan of their Chicken Paprika, Chicken Ala Kiev, Devilled Crab, Chicken cordon bleu, Fish Florentine, Bhekti Meuniere and of course the legendary Baked Alaska! Forever in Love with Mocambo ❤

The place where my dad use to take once a month. 
I have to say it 
Beef steak wasn't good as i thought it will be 
But chicken paprika was something wonderful
But Veg lasagna was the show stopper cause our group happened to have a vegetarian around..... 
Although a nice place for dine in

Adding to my previous review of - "The service could be improved, and there could be a major rejig of the staff - they aren't professional to say the least. However, they're hospitable enough to warrant a repeat visit by one and all given that the food (read : Steak) is the distinguishing factor. 
We tried the Canelloni and Steak. It's been 2 months since we visited Mocambo. 

The steak has stayed with me since. 
Enough said."

Never visiting this place now, not sure if I will fit their bill of a 'good' customer who 'dresses well' and isn't 'drunk'.

Before my trip to this city, did my homework by checking out reviews and found this place being recommended by Shaili Desai  . This got added to the list of places to visit and reached here for dinner along with my mum. Like all the other legendary restaurants here, this place also has the same kind off seating as the others do. The staff here are dressed up in uniforms that are similar to the ones who serve in the Rajya Sabha.
Our order included, Mutton special kebabs, Chicken Paprika, Devilled Crab and watermelon juice. Being a seafood lover, devilled crab was the highlight for the day. The food was awesome however the juice wasn't good. Overall a place worth visiting again!

Ps: Pics do the talking! :)

Mocambo is one of the most reputable restaurants in the city. It is truly a legendary place to dine in for any and every occasion – office meetings, family gathering, romantic dates, birthday treats and sometimes, just because you want to. I have found myself seated under the iconic lamps of Mocambo more number of times than I can count, and I would continue to do so every time I get a chance. 

My orders:

-	Chicken Chipolata: A sizzling platter of grilled chicken served with sautéed onions, sausages, bacon and buttered vegetables (such as peas, carrots, tomatoes and cucumbers). I relished every bite of my platter – the taste of the vegetables, the succulence of the meat, and the taste of the hot sauce. This one is worth every penny! 

-	Risotto with chicken, bacon, mushroom and ham – The mother of all risottos, I had this one ages ago and I still remember how much I savoured every bite of it. Everything from the flavour of the ingredients, the seasoning and the creamy finish was beautifully done. However, one of my friends did convey to me that she did not enjoy the risotto as much as we both had before, so take my word with a pinch of salt. 

-	Risotto Alla Parmigiana – From the Italian kitchen, this risotto is for those who prefer their meal to be slightly bland and not as an overpowering mix of numerous ingredients. The risotto rice with cheese and garlic acts as a perfect comfort food for your soul.

-	Angels on Horseback – This popular dish is a heady combination consisting of chicken fillet wrapped on bacon and served on a bed of onion and sausage risotto. Avoid it if you are not an avid and regular meat eater. Go ahead if you can handle it!    

In addition to the above, the Sweet Lime Soda here is a classic favourite as well. 

Suggestions/Feedback:

-	I love the menu items and perhaps the menu itself is part of the restaurant’s unique style, but I have always found the menu slightly difficult to navigate quickly, and I personally would prefer a more systematic menu card. 

-	The servers, while well-dressed and fast, tend to be impolite at times and I strongly feel that the behaviour of the staff is highly important for a wonderful dining experience. For instance, on my last visit, despite my request, the server flatly refused to serve us the food on our respective plates. While this may not be the general custom, I would have very much preferred a friendly face. 

-	A little bit more flexibility in the portion sizes is recommended as well. 

My complaints aside, I am of the opinion that Mocambo is renowned for a reason. Its reliable delicacies, soothing charm, and inviting ambiance beckons you to re-visit this golden favourite time and again. Peace.

Back in the 50s,,,, Mocambo was the place where everyone went to shake a leg nd grab a bite while jazz singers crooned guests.... Mocambo was eclectic nd kitschy European for its time... Today,,, much of its past glory has been translated nd retained especially on its Continental menu... The Fish à la Diana,,, Chicken A-La-Kiev nd Prawn Cocktail are my favourites,,, definitely worth ordering. The Baked Alaska dessert is a MUST TRY.....

Ignore the bottom review. this restaurant should be banned.
How can b people like u can be so disrespectful....


One of d oldest and classy restaurant, I guess need no introduction. A perfect presentation of sizzler, continental dishes. And yes those are at their best.

Environment: yes, it is very soothing. On that day it was not that crowded. So, it was pretty good, in terms of soothing atmosphere :P

Now mainly coming to the food

Soup: we had cream corn veg soup. I found it a bit flat. But after mixing salt n paper, it was pretty good.

Starter:
________________
Spinach cheess pillow : excellent. Veg dish. Superb in taste. 4 pieces of spinach pillow with cheese wrap.

Prawn cocktail: heavenly in taste. Do taste it if you go there. I guess best prawn cocktail in the town.

Murg kebab: it was pretty good, not excellent. chichken stuffing with wrappers.

Main course:
_________________

Vegetable steak: its a sizzler based presentation with veg dish. Decent in taste ( please note: I do not prefer veg that much, may b that is why I found it decent)

Grill Chicken sizzler: very good, I wanted to taste something without gravy n all. I found it pretty good.

Chicken a la kive: ohh.. That is owssummm.. When u cut this molten butter comes out. That is something owssum in taste.

Chichken milanise: chicken baked with pasta, ham, cheese. Superb in taste.

Devil crab: very good in taste.

We had not enough stomach left for the desert. Next time will try.

Do try it. It's a pretty good experience.

A classy place with elegant interiors, great food. If you're looking for a place with great continental and Italian cuisine(haven't yet tried North Indian) and somehow passe ambiance, Mocambo is just the place for you. Have almost tried all of vegetarian continental and they were just too tasty that you still crave for even when your belly is full. Portion served were just right.  As such do try the heritage dishes suggested in the Menu, they won't disappoint you at tall. Service might appear a little slow but manageable. Overall, no complaints, the food does most of talking there. :)

Heritage... Ecstasy... Classic... Elegance... It has all the charm to make a foodie go bleak on his knees. I had tandoori mixed grill platter sizzler styled, crab meat risotto, stuffed tandoori chicken and baked Alaska. Each of the main course dishes were equally competent in creating magic on palette... The risotto was indeed very rich and flavorsome. The baked alaska with the rich taste of vanilla ice cream and walnuts and the soufflé and alcohol were so good that I have no words to express my feelings. The waiters are great and price is reasonable( I don't know why people think that it's pricy). Actually this restro does not need a review for checking in, the name is enough.

I know people might kill me after reading this piece – but this is exactly how Mocambo is as of today. This review is a result of my visit today (a disappointment nonetheless). That makes me wonder – Was it amazing many years back & then deteriorated over the years or were they consistently like this over the years & people then were not as exposed to Global cuisine as today and hence thought this was great. I don’t know the answer. 

The restaurant is super retro (will remind you of 'Pulp Fiction'). The place has been like this for ages. Red cushioned leather look sofas, colorful table lighting, waiting staff wearing what we would see butlers wearing in the days of the Raj (thus making themselves 'heritage' as well). 

Coming to the meal, we started with their house specialty (I always prefer house specials). Devilled crab. It was crabmeat on cheese and mustard sauce served in shell. It was a cheesy, creamy filling loaded with calories but good to taste. Amount of crab was suboptimal and excess cheese somewhat overpowered the flavor and the taste of fresh crab. Couldn't feel the taste of crab meat thanks to overpowering feel of mustard! After that, We ordered Fish a la Diana – betky stuffed with prawn cooked with cream sauce. Excellent betky, superb prawns , great texture, very good to taste. Sounded exotic, great ingredients but the dish failed to impress much as the sauce was clumsy. Slightly sweet penultimate salt, not sour and corn starch thickened texture. Next dish we ordered was Surf and turf – fresh prawn and chateaubriand beef steak with mushroom sauce. Great ingredients but bad execution. Very Good steak – perfectly done, prawn was succulent inside but covered with a batter I don’t know why. In a city that gets the freshest supplies of prawn, what’s the point in ruining it a with batter. Once again the sauce was a disaster . I poured it stop the steak and after a first bite, cleaned the steak and enjoyed it as it is. For dessert we ordered Pineapple soufflé. It was nothing short of a horror story. It was like the cheap roadside pastry cake icing with egg white added to it to increase density. The texture was somewhat sticky and too creamy. It was a challenge to finish it. We ate half and left the rest. 

Oh wait! Its not over yet. More disappointment is yet to follow. On recommendation by the staff, we ordered Mixed grill platter that had chicken leg, sausage, chicken liver, mutton liver, bacon. This was a nightmare. Three out of five items – chicken liver, mutton liver & Chicken leg were meats gone bad. The refrigerator must have conked off or the chefs must have been messing with us! The chicken was surely heritage – so old & stale. To counter the bad taste in our mouths we then, pathetically ordered, Chicken firdausi kabab.  was a roll with chicken mince& dal inside it. The dal quantity was more – hence the taste and flavor of chicken was sub optimal. Mutton cutlet was excellent though (our savior)!! It had thick and juicy mutton filling with good amount of spices in it. The seasoning was perfect. The outer layer was crispy. The proportion of crispy outer and juicy inner was perfect. 

I know, you must have dozed off by now...but please stay with me a little more. Please. I want to share my utter tragedy. I really do. So to make things even worse, We also ordered Prawn Portuguese. I doubt that the Portuguese have their prawns this way. Once again the prawns were batter fried & topped with sauce & cheese. Taste was good but nothing beyond that. Last dish we ordered that evening was fish steak (yeah you heard that right - 'last dish' reminding me of my 'last supper' here ever. The fish was surprisingly good though (at last the universe looked upon us with benevolence). Fresh lime soda was something I loved it here the most. It was strong, had a character of its own, acted as a great palate cleanser, had superb balance of sugar,salt & sour.  But the angry Gods are hard to please, aren't they? Damn right they are! Chocolate soufflé was again bad like the pineapple souffle. There you go - we are officially the biggest murgas of the day! (Round of applause please)...

Worst visit to Mocambo this time. Experiencing a great visit last time had visited again.To refrain from experimental massacres had repeated some of the menus ordered on earlier visit Murgh Firdaushi kebab,baked alaska and a sizzler.However a chicken Risotto was a new addition to our menu.
I was really surprised Mocambo degraded so much with time in terms of food quality and hospitality.Staffs had no courtesy,didnt bother to attend to the visitors.Even for a glass of water  they had to be called again and again.
Coming to the food blunder,dessert served before main course.They pleaded that staff is new and we agreed for early dessert.Baked Alaska first served cold without any flame.On request they served a new one with excess of spirit like liquid which they claimed to be brandy(yack!!!.stinged like alcohol)
The chicken rissoto was horrible. Firdaushi kebab was not upto the mark I had last time.Sizzler was bit better.
Overall a very bad experience.Hope Mocambo people pay a bit tribute to their heritage instead of money making.

This is not just another restaurant in Calcutta. It is a vintage one with the old school charm. So dining here is not just about eating it's an experience altogether. The ambience is beautiful. Those peculiar lamps, the typical seats is sheer nostalgia for people who have been going to this place forever. Amongst the food this place is famous for It's steak, pork chops, fish Florentine and chicken paprika. The prawn cocktail is amazing too. (Tried it all! :D) One tiny glitch though, I wish the waiters were a little more polite and subtle in handling customers. I understand people tend to hurry in rush hours but maintaining a good behavior and too see that the customers are not dissatisfied is a part of their job. :) However, this is too negligible a reason to not like a restaurant you have visited since a kid. Must visit. Duh. :D
That was my previous review.
However your attitude towards people who are not well off has forced me to take away the rating. So shallow mocambo. A person who's a driver by profession is denied food? really?

We 4 went to this restaurant on a Sunday lunch. Since we like  Conti. we ordered the heritage and iconic conti. dishes. They were really live up to our expectation.  I had continental dishes in India's 5-star hotels as well, but to me Mocambo's Conti dishes are taste-wise better. 
The starter "Devilled Crab" was definitely the star of show and my recommendation to anyone would be must try.
However, I am bit disappointed with the approach of the service staffs but I think this is because they are old timers and not really care about the service aspect as such.

As far as food is concerned, they can challenge any star restaurants any day..

Another legendary and heritage restuarant of kolkata.. located at the food hub of this city. They serve awsome continental dishes..specially the steaks are simply delicious! Though the pork cutlet which we ordered had too much cheese and the pork seemed to be underccoked  😡Though they are mostly basking in the glory of their 'brand name' inspite of being quite mediocre cooking of the dishes they serve!  But I'll say Mocambo has a great ambience for a lunch or dinner outing with friends and family.

Even with the extra space i had to wait for an hour to get a table for two. That speaks a lot for the food i suppose. A bit costly and if you are an ardent alcoholic tong fong or oly pub serves you good at a lower tag.
                 But MOCAMBO is a place for its foods. Start with the soups. Glide along kebabs. The stuffed chicken tandoori is unparalleled . Try the devilled crab or the prawn tornado. If you are a fish fanatic as most people in bengal are dive in the creamy balls of fish a la Dyna. If you are left with the left do plunge in the chicken a la Kiev or MOCAMBO's personal modification of the russian delight chicken a la pavlov.
             On warm and moist afternoons munch on  the fish and chips. Or ask for a fish biriyani. That's all in fish i will say. Too bengali.
            But on sleazy nights do sizzle..and that to with the surf and turf. If not a beef lover try the ham steak or the chicken chipolata. Last day i had the MOCAMBO special mixed sizzler and its like a lot for one person.
               End your extravaganza by a chocodelite if you love pinapples that is or try the pudding. But if you go by my suggestion drop the deserts walk around and dig in to flurys for icecreams.

I visited mocabo for lunch a couple of days ago. This place has been an old favorite for a really long time and is my absolute go-to when I am in the mood for continental food. We ordered the firdousi bari kebab, chicken shahshlik a la russe (very similar to the chelo kebab but served without the egg) , the ham steak(with mushroom) , bloody mary, fresh lime soda sweet and 3 beers. The bill amounted to Rs.2400. Although it is a little overpriced, the service is excellent and the food is delectable. Looking forward to next time.

An iconic restaurant in the food district of Kolkata - and carrier of British legacy - serving primarily continental, anglo-indian khansama food. Once upon a time it was a place frequented by the who's-n-who of Kolkata. It still maintains that same ambience and decor, however, the indian-mughlai section in their menu just does not gel with the rest. Probably this is to cater to the people who still could not opt for western style cusine. 
We had a large group and had blast sampling the delicacies like fish a la diana, angels on horseback, chicken chipolata, cheese and spinach pillow and many other dishes.. the traditional folks amongst us went for nalli gost (spelt GHOST in the menu card!) kadhai chicken and else... nice experience, great service but the air conditioning was not ok

Needless to say, it's one of the most well known restaurants in kolkata. The ambience simply reminds you of the bygone era,and also the menu has perfect combination of Italian & north Indian cuisine. I have tested the Chicken tetrazzini & chicken cold & salad. Both were exceptional. The hospitality of the management makes the outing more happy.

One of the most prestigious and heritage restaurant in kolkata, they have an awesome interior decoration, and the behaviour by the management as well by the waiter is awesome they greet and treat their customers as if they are family. Now let's come to the food. We ordered one pork sizzler and one mocambo sizzler. As they mentioned in their restaurant that they serve the best sizzler in the town, yes!!! They are really great and simply the best in town. Over all this is a must visit for the city's best food craving people. Best in sizzler absolutely... if you go once you'll go always ... absolutely a great place to hangout with you family and along with your friends. This place is a bliss in the city..

Lovely continental cuisine. Amazing presentation. You will love the creativity. Although Chinese and Mughlai cuisines are available, I would advise you to explore the continental menu more. The tetrazzini is amazing. For dessert, baked Alaska is a must.

Full 5 star from me. One of the oldest eating joints and yes of course a legendary one. The sizzlers, kebabs, and the continental dishes are simply delicious. This place needs no new introduction to native kolkatians. For everyone else if you happened to be in Kolkata you should be visiting this place. Special recommendation lobster thermidor and devil's crab.

Updated because of the inhuman behaviour!!

I was visiting Kolkata and as always, Mocambo was on my bucket list. Had been here for dinner with high hopes. Felt slightly disappointed. The food was good but nothing great. The quality of food and service has decreased over the years. We tried their specialities.. hara kebab and chicken ala kiev and veg sizzler.. it was okay. Prawn cocktail was good. Tried grilled hilsa which was nothing exceptional as the waiter described. Please try to keep up the heritage that Mocambo is !

Went for a friends b'day party. The decoration was very Chinese. First of all they objected in us celebrating by cutting a cake. After some talk they let us cut the cake but did not allow to light the candles nd told us to not make any noise by singing happy birthday (so rude). We ordered chicken biryani, grilled chicken with bread rolls and paneer and naan. The food was really really tasty but the service was toooooooo slow. It took us almost 2hrs to finish. We even had to call the waiters to fill our glasses which is quite unexpected In these kind of restaurants. Will visit again maybe for the food. Experience was disappointing. And specially after what you did with the driver never coming back again. You guys don't reserve a rating. U call urslf fine dining restaurant, the quality of staff nd management that u have is worse than my para's chai dukan. Fix ur mentality or get lost. U guys don't deserve to be in d hospitality business when u don't have any hospitality. Shame, just so much shame on u. Hope ur restaurant closes as soon as possible. #boycottmocambo

I came here after ages. Was in town for a wedding and came here with my cousins for nostalgia sake. And I am so sorry that came here. The food is next to tasteless. The service is soooo slow and poor. They don't care, just don't care as its iconic and the place is full, so why should they care. The guys in black suits are obnoxious, and rude to the level that you have to have extreme patience to behave yourself. Even after complaining that the food is not good they don't care to even react to it. I swear, I wish they get to know the ground reality soon...the only thing I liked was the old world ambience and the beer mug.

Another icon on park street, 
Perhaps the most cozy and 'ambient' dining room in all of Calcutta. The deviled crab to start with is excellent. 
The fish or chicken steak is great. Another good dish to try is the chicken paprika if you're feeling creamy. 
Honestly, everything on the menu is prepared well. I even like the fried rice here ! (strange but delicious)
This sort of cuisine is very specific and peculiar to the city. Nowhere else in the world will you find this creamy, sticky and well flavored concoction that is "Indo-Continental". Mocambo and Peter Cat seem to have a patent on it.
Great for a date-meal. Very affordable.

I write as someone who has been going to Mocambo for ages - Mocambo was (is?) absolutely my favourite restaurant. I visited the restaurant two days back with a friend. Most of what I ate was bad - the Devilled Crab was not that bad, but it was all cheese and little crab. My friend had a Chateaubriand and that was possibly not terrible (although he had to get it changed because he asked for 'rare' and was served 'well done'. I ordered Pork Steak - it seemed to be all maida. I complained and they offered a replacement. After much thought (because I did not really want to have fish or chicken) I went for Prawn Cocktail - I thought it would be safe. There were a few rubbery prawns in a huge quantity of very warm mayonnaise. It is hard to make bad Prawn Cocktail, but that is what happened. Also, if you order a cocktail, the first few sips are alcohol-y but after that it is only a sweet drink. I am very disappointed with my favourite restaurant.

Is it overrated? Yeah,probably and especially if you're coming from out of town.

But,as far as the city goes it's a place with a legacy. It's got okayish standards,although the décor looks cutout from the 80s.

The fisherman's turf is the sole winner for me,even after my third visit.

Final edit - their mediocrity finally hit the roof. Denial of service pointlessly, paired with shoddy food.

People may say that there is hardly anything for the vegetarians that's not true. Both veg and non veg persons can eat here. Amazing sizzlers and continental dishes to chose from. Baked Alaska is amazing. Recently they have increased there seating capacity. I definitely recommend it.

Don't we all love the food and hate the waiting outside when it's Mocambo? Wonderful old school continental is what I go back for. It's been a while I need to go have a meal there soon with my parents and wife.

Went back post the controversy which I feel was a mountain made of a mole hill. I feel it's a private property and has the right to choose who gets to enter. Mocambo is not a government property  benfish who have to open its doors for everyone. I'm sure greateastern hotel when it was run by the government (till Jyoti babu ran it into the ground with all the free meals) had a "right of admission reserved"  notice some where in the hotel. 
Coming back to the food ... just loved it and a lot is left to cover of the menu.

This place have become a part of Calcutta's history. But unlike many other heritage restaurants, including it's cousin Peter Cat, they are actually good. Ambiance is old world and waiters are courteous and attentive.

I love the Deviled Crab here. Always felt like having more after finishing this. Also their Ham steak mushroom. Only negative here is the vegetables served along with the steak are plain boiled. They should toss them in salt and pepper.

Among dessert Baked Alaska is my favourite for it's look. Tastes pretty normal and it is actually a simple dessert.

In all a good place for quality family lunch / dinner.

Mocambo..located in Park street is undoubtedly one of the best continental eatery in Kolkata with a dimly lit interior and well behaved staff. We had indulged ourselves in a dish called angels on horseback...small pieces of chicken wrapped with bacon served with sautéed vegetables and risotto. Next was Fish ala diana..a feast for the fishlovers with bhetki stuffed with prawns in creamy sauce. The desserts Cold Everest and Brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce provided an icing to the cake. So if you are ready for some gastrointestinal delights and wanna pamper your taste buds..this place is strongly recommended.

Mocambo is not just a restaurant. It is an integral part of the culinary culture of Kolkata. The old world charms of this place would make one forget the outside hustle and dig into out of the world food. A gourmets delight. To me Mocambo is synonymous with continental food. The recipes are authentic and till now the food is the best I have ever had.

Needless to say,Park Street and Mocambo sound complementary to each other.
No doubt ,this is one of the most popular joints in the area and when I tried a meal,I was left with no option but pen down this testimonial .
  This is one of the few places to serve safe and delectable pork dishes,we happened to try the Angels on horseback, a preparation with chicken cubes wrapped in bacon ribbons,strewn in a spicy sauce and served with rice and sauteed veggies,the dish being more of a meal for single pax.
We also tried the prawn and crab cocktail ,which was prawns and crabmeat submerged in a pool of thousand island dressing,served in a dessert bowl. The idea of the dish is appreciated however the too much of the dressing was rebelled against by the frantically working tastebuds.
The above dishes followed by chocolate mousse for dessert was the way my taste buds called for truce.
As for the ambience,its decent and peaceful with warm greetings by the staff,dressed in white and turbans.
The interior is dimly lit,however is ideal for a quiet  conversation  or a family dinner,even a date.

After hearing a lot of rave reviews about this legendary place, we decided to try dine out here for lunch... The welcome was fantastic and the ambience, the interiors are one which can match any top notch restaurant... 

Coming to food, we ordered prawn cocktail, Italian garlic prawn, angel on horseback and chicken sicilliene... Food was served within minutes... Prawn cocktail was good... It was more of a cocktail which tasted like being made up of mayo... Italian garlic prawns was good but there was nothing Italian about the dish... It was like any other normal garlic prawn... The potato fries accompanying the chicken made the dish taste more Indian than Italian... Next was chicken sicilliene... This was the best of the lot... It is a heavenly dish for cheese lovers since it is baked with cheese... This was a perfect continental dish cooked to perfection... Next was angel on horseback... Whatever the name is, the dish was good... The chicken along with the bacon were nicely done... The flavoured rice served enhanced the taste of the dish...

Overall a pleasant experience... Would recommend everyone to have food at this legendary place simply for its continental food...

A bit disappointed with this iconic Park Street heritage restaurant. Went there a 2nd time on recommendation. Had wanted to try their beef steaks. Indulged in Irish Chateaubriand beef steak cooked in garlic butter which was not quite up to the mark as expected. A palatable dish but lacks the essence of a succulent beef steak. The fresh lime juice though was refreshing. I've also tried their veg. canneloni a long time back but didn't like it either. As for ambiance, the semi-dark cabin-like corners with red sofas, decorated partitions and hanging lamps almost give it an antique touch of a bygone era.
But I have to say their outlook should change for if they keep on catering to only their "elite" guests they would have to shut down soon. True it may not be a "roadside dhaba" as the authorities claim but what they have done is even worse than what guests are treated at a dhaba! Even a dhaba extends a more warm and hearty welcoming hand to its visitors!! Mocambo's treatment has clearly shown that they not only lack proper hospitality and management being an age-old heritage restaurant but also humanity and ethics.

Its speciality devilled crabs are truly an experience for connossieur, the ham steak in mushroom sauce was also very good. However a special mention needs to be made of the dessert baked alaska which was hot outside and full of walnuts,cake and ice cream. Overall a great place to dine and a beautiful experience for the culinary senses.

The restaurant is one of the most popular restaurants in Park Street and it's fame has just increased ever since its mention in the Blockbuster starring Vidya Balan which I believe everyone is aware of ; Kahani!
I had visited Mocambo once with my parents and once with my grandmother and aunt. The first visit with my parents was at best, good. My parents are fond of Indian cuisine, so they went with roti, dal and Butter Chicken (not sure what the exact name in the menu is but it was essentially that only from what I saw!) I on the other hand love continental food and I ordered Fish alla Diana (again name could be wrong in terms of spelling!). The Indian food was nice, but that's where it stops. I mean it was just nice and nothing spectacular as could be expected. The fish dish was also nice, but gradually it felt like a cheese overload and I could not taste anything else! Though the meal was filling and not exorbitantly priced, we were not really excited about it.
The second time I went, I really wanted to try a risotto and Prawn cocktail. So I ordered the aforementioned dishes whereas my grandmother went with chicken cutlet and my aunt chose mutton cutlets! :-P
So the cutlets were nice, the chicken one was chewy but the mutton one was quite soft and melting in the mouth kinds. I was not really a fan of the Prawn cocktail though. For me the dressing was a bite overpowering, but maybe that's the way it's supposed to be. I don't really know since I tried it for the first time. The risotto to my delight was absolutely delicious. It felt a bit too dry maybe, but again that's in comparison to what I have seen on TV. This was my first risotto and regardless of it being dry, I absolutely loved it!
So Mocambo to me was a mixed bag of highs and lows and hence just an above average rating. I look forward to going again soon and maybe with a nice experience, the rating might push up! 
In light of recent events, I am compelled to rate this place as low as I have! This was highly unfortunate and really bad on the part of the restaurant as a whole! #Humanity #Shameful

we were shifted to another table...wid one of its chair broken and shaky to our surprise..

we ordered fried fish..which smelled and tasted terrible...stale fish it was.. and wat added to the disappointment was that the tartar sauce accompanying the same was served to us after we were thru 75% of our meal..I informed this to the manager .. and all that i recieved was we are sorry Ma'am ..there was no attempt to even correct the situation..the experience was that terrible that we left without our main course and opted for a dhaba instead of MOCAMBO !!

We went three for Sunday brunch and ordered chateaubriand beef steak (medium) with pepper sauce and mixed meat risotto. Both dishes were cooked to absolute perfection, esp the risotto. Most people overcook liver and make it chewy and rubbery. The liver in the risotto would just melt in the mouth. Perfection. I would have preferred If they had more beer variety.

Old yet Classy!! My wife and I, were here on the recommendation one of her 'JNU' friend. Despite having stayed in Calcutta for nearly 25 years, I have never been to Mocambo, primarily it being a non-vegetarian paradise.  Now to treat my wife to some sumptuous food, we settled for Mocambo. 

The place is  huge and it have so many serves attending each and every table. The dull lighting and graffiti on the walls provides an essence of it being the City of Joy. Being a vegan, my options are limited, I ordered for a Spinach and Cheese Pillows while my wife settled for Tandoori Chicken.

Spinach and Cheese Pillows- Fried spinach cubes dipped in cheese. If you by chance you have guilt in the intake of calories, this is blasphemy. Every and every bite has gallons of cheese however the chef ensures, the spinach taste is remain intact. I have fallen in the love of this dish.

Tandoori Chicken- my wife was every particular for this dish. Chicken had to be tender and the green pudina chutney is a must. The same was on offer however order was served late and cold. The taste was kept intact.

The  serves has been efficient and the entire restaurant was fully occupied despite it being a weekday. Loved it!

Its one of the very few restaurants which has made me fall in love with continental food,a cuisine of which i am not otherwise very much fond of.
The ambience is delightful and classy and the restaurant is spacious and well designed.
For starters we took devilled crab which is undoubtedly the best crab dish i have ever tasted in my life and is one of the best dishes of mocambo.Cream of spring chicken soup was delightful and so was mushroom garlic prawn and chicken peshwari kebab which we had taken as starters.The kebabs were extremely soft,melting in ones mouth.For main course we had chicken paprika;their signature dish...a perfect blend of chicken,pasta and rice in cheese,angels on horseback which was a delicacy in red sauce and chicken orientale ala mocambo which was equally good.My other friends had ordered dishes like mutton biriyani,murg musallam,nan and chicken sizzler which were comparatively ordinary.
The best of all were again the desserts.We took crepes with lemon,orange and chocolate sauce and souffle ala mocambo surprise.Both were delicious.I would love to visit this place again.

Mocambo is an all time favourite. It has an old world charm, like many other eateries on Park Street. I have loved the various dishes I have tried here over the past years. Whenever, I visit this place, my wife always reminds of a particular visit when I had almost dropped my contact lenses in the soup.Mocambo has one of the best sizzlers in the town, and I have had enough of it. So these days, whenever I go, I try to choose one of their other dishes. We ordered Risotto di scampi and Chicken pavlograd. I love their sizzlers, but I have had enough of them, so, thought of trying something else.
The risotto had generous amount of cheese, prawns and crab meat. The flavour of garlic came out very nicely, not too strong, not too light. The rice used for the risotto was of the longer and thinner variety. However, generally the rice used for risotto is short grain and roundish, and more sticky. Nevertheless, the risotto tasted very nice.
The pavlograd is a modified version of chicken a la kiev. It's chicken fillet stuffed with cheese, butter, green pepper, tomatoes and onion. The onion is not mentioned in the menu. A big fried ball shaped chicken fillet is presented to you and when you cut through it, the melted butter flows out and fills your plate. How heavenly it is!! The only issue with the stuffing is that, they use raw onion along with the other ingredients. Since the onions are not cooked, the flavour of the onion becomes too strong compared to the rest of the dish, and does not go well.
For desserts, we had brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate soufle. They were quite good.
Mocambo has expanded, and they have opened another sitting area. Staffs are quite friendly and guide you on the food if you ask them.

Good location, nice ambience, not for regular visits. Timely delivery and nice reception.
Ordered lobster thermidor and ham steak mushroom. They will gave u two lobsters, more than enough for 2.
Service tax and vat is extra.
Parking is problematic. Please follow the rates of Rs.5/hr for bikes and 10/hr for cars. The agents charge same rate for both bikes and cars.
Vat and service tax extra.

Finaly my long awaited first dinner at mocambo. First the good things. Awesome ambience, best and the most diverse menu and quite reasonable for the quality. Chicken tetrazzini was absolute delight. Pavlograd not so much but still quite good ( guessing its parent dish i.e chicken a la kiev would have been better).

Now the bad. Too much delay in preparing orders. Waiters and management not very eager to attend guests (especially if local). Tried meat lassagne which was horrible. The original lasagne is not a pie of minced meat but a soft sandwich of lasange pasta and minced meat and atleast is tasty though subtle. Please improve. We expect much more from mocambo.

What can be said which has not been already told about this restaurant. Bursting with old age charm, this is one of the most nostalgic places that you can dine in. In the last 6 months I have been to this restaurant 3 times and everytime I have been a happy camper. Things that are an absolute delight are - Prawn cocktail, Galouti Kebab, Chicken milanaise, baked alaska etc. Waiting time can be a pain but th restaurant has recently done some major renovation and have added ~40 covers. Do sit in the new wing as it is more airy.

Located just beside tung fong,this place is a must visit if you want to try exotic continental dishes. A huge number of choices for continental dish lovers, starting with chicken, fish as well as pork. The sizzlers taste great. I would recommend Chicken paprika, chicken a la kiev and fish muniere.  all the dishes are properly served with good combination of sidings and garnishings like fries,creamy rice,veggies. Staffs are very courteous and their suggestions are good as well.

Mocambo is an all time favourite, a place so entwined with the essence of Calcutta and it's old school brilliance that you cannot forget your experience here.
Food is beautiful, I've never been too experimental here because I'm too much in love with the dishes I've been eating here for ages: the Chicken Cream of Asparagus Soup, Fish Muniya for starters followed by a regular sizzler or a Risotto. Must tries are the Angels on Horse Back or the Fish a la Diana. With their newly added seating section, now there are less chances of being disappointed by a long queue when you arrive to enjoy a good meal on a holiday!

"Mocambo serves an excellent array of continental dishes. For me fish Diana and devilled carbs are the stand out dishes. The look and feel of the restaurant is also nice." - above was my review few months back.

But learning of their racist attitude towards others, I wish I could have rated them zero !!

This is a legendary restaurant in park street, famous for its non vegetarian food. It serves Awesome food, a chicken lover's delight. Even the vegetarian dishes are tasty. The service is a class apart and the ambience is also nice. The rating is less than 5 only because I need to visit a few more times to check for consistency. The first and only experience was fabulous.

Go here only if you like Cheese and Baked Italian stuff. I went here for a lunch outing. The restaurant is undergoing renovation but still it felt good inside, probably I stepped in after a brisk walk in the outdoor heat.
Order: Gin Fizz Special, Bud Pint, Corn Spinach Pillows, Chicken Tetrazzini, Veg Cannelloni and Garlic Bread.
Before placing the veg order I asked the waiter for recommendations. He recommended Corn and Spinach pillows for starters. And for main course he said most of it is white sauce and baked. When  I enquired about the sizzler that would it come with a rice or noodles in sides, but the waiter declined. With limited options available the only tomato based dish was veg cannelloni. 
The drinks were just fine but the food was a bit too cheesy and turned out to be of good quantity.

I am editing my old review of 5 stars and I know everybody else i doing that too. Come out with a public apology and mend your ways. This kind of class conscious behaviour will not be tolerated in our city. Get rid of your colonial hangovers. There are no British left in our country. So beware. We are all 'Manish Bhiyas' and we will stand for each other.

(OLD REVIEW)
                Before anything else let me take a bow first to The Baap of all continental joints in the city... You donot need to think anything when u r in doubt... Just close your eyes and trust in Mocambo !!!
Donot miss out on Meat Lasagne, Chicken Supreme and the most well made beef steaks in town !

This is the birthplace of the best steak in Kolkata. Chateaubriand done medium rare paired with the right wine here is the perfect celebration dinner. Love the liveried servers, the old world decor which is genuine vintage. This place has more than half a century of history in the city's party street, yet is unpretentious, discreet and goes about its daily business in the best way it can, which is continue to serve fabulous food in its own sweet way. Sweet nostalgia!

We ordered Angels on Horseback, Chicken A-la-kiev and chicken do piyaza. The food was superb,service a bit slow, but cant blame them,saturday night. Price, I felt was a bit towards the higher side. In short, the food was awesome, and we did have a great time. Ambiance was good and hope to visit soon.@

Mocambo was on my wish-list for long!
The ambience is very nice and Mocambo has got its own charm. I'm not very fond of continental food but always wanted to check what Mocambo has to offer.
My reviews of the dishes we had:

Starters:
• Italian style garlic herb prawn - Awesome according to my friends ( I'm allergic to prawns 😥 ) I tasted just the sauce and it was tasty 📷
• Fish Kabab: Soft, juicy and really good 📷
• Mutton Special Kabab: Amazing, I loved it

Main Course:
• Fish Florentine: Good, not that impressive for me 📷
• Chicken Paprika: Really good, must try. A Hungarian dish 📷
• Chicken Chipolata Sizzler : Very much disappointed, the chicken had a very much raw smell, just had the bacon and sausages. It got wasted. 📷

The service is at a snail speed so place order well in advance for main course as the waiters don't care if you are waiting after finishing starter.

Overall average experience, over priced. Not sure if I'll visit again but may visit for Chicken Paprika and to try the much hyped Chicken A La Keiv, next time!

I love Mocambo. Definitely one of the better restaurants in Kolkata serving European and continental food. Their Prawn Cocktail, Angels on Horseback and Bhetki stuffed with prawn are my favourite dishes and definitely a must try. Mocambo is always crowded so be on the alert about that when you decided to visit.

Around the corner of the very busy Park Street, with locals dawdling around, you will spot the name board hidden behind aerial roots. A humble ambiance with pretty lights over each table, reading the menu will fuel your appetite. The stuffed crabs are a must try and so is the garlic prawns appetiser. The sizzlers are delicious as well.

Went for a Saturday lunch. The moment you walk in you will get a old Kolkata vibe. 
We ordered prawn cocktail, devilled crab, angels on horse back along with screwdriver to start with. I loved the prawn cocktail and devilled crab reminded the last time I ate here - a long time ago, I was a kid and was in awe with the idea of a hassle-free, tasty crab experience.
In the mains we tried beef steak and the day's special - nalla ghost. Both were delicious.
Overall great experience with prompt and courteous service. Perfect place if you are looking for a sumptuous meal in a authetic-Kolkata-ambiance.
Only thing is even though Zomato doesn't recommend to book a table here, it would be good idea to make a booking, we had to wait around 20 minutes to get one.

This is definitely one of the legendary food joints in Kolkata. Located at the heart of Park Street, this restaurant is famous for being a little different from the other ones in the area. Though this is a pure continental restaurant, yet you would get most of the popular cuisines prevalent in India. The foods are really heavy. Would suggest you to go in empty stomach to make the best of their menu. The price satisfies the quality and the ambiance of the restaurant.

Such discrimination are quintessentially reminiscent of British Raj's "Dogs and Indians are not allowed". There are no place for such bigotry and partisanship in a democratic civilized society. The question arises that are they even educated and will they teach their children the same? Generations have passed but they didn't get over their post-colonial mental blockage. With #PeterCat just around the corner people can care less about your fine dine propaganda shit. They serve everyone with better quality of food and reception. Your restaurant has shabby interiors, incommodiously cramped areas between two tables, serving average quality food and snobbish waiters and managers lacking basic etiquettes or humanity for that matter. Talk about their hospitality, they are so shallow that they stooped down to such shameful act of humiliating. They detest people speaking regional languages, want them to look rich, which is insane. Moreover they had the audacity to accept and acknowledge it on a social platform. It is man that makes clothes; clothes doesn't make a man. Swami Vivekananda had once said in America "In your country clothes makes a gentleman, in my country character does". Also, they don't provide the Wi-Fi password unlike other eateries at being asked. After this public incident I will not visit this place and I'll also suggest my companions to #BoycottMocambo! You are a disgrace and you had it coming; totally deserved!

Reducing my rating from 3 to 1 because of the incident that took place recently.Shame on guys.Serving people food is one of the most generous acts that one can perform.And the way you have kicked humanity in the face,YOU PEOPLE SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED TO SERVE FOOD TO ANYBODY.6months ago,this is what my review was:-
Went there after a long time on a friend's bday.The ambiance is great but somehow I like Peter Cat better.The food is good but a little pricey.I was longing to have their chicken firdousi kebab.So we ordered a plate for the starter and regretted it immediately.It's very heavy and has got minced pulse as the stuffing which I did not like.Did not taste good at all.We had 2 beers.For the mains,we ordered the irish beef steak and chicken chipolata.Both taste good but nothing extra-ordinary.The steak was soft and succulent with a side of pasta,potatoes,onions and veggies and a butter sauce.The pasta had ketchup in it which was kinda gross.The chipolata had a big piece of grilled chicken,sausages and a side of pasta and veggies.But we couldn't finish them and had to pack it home.The food quality is good but the standard has dropped down like hell.

A long awaited wishlist gets ticked off. Good news is they are going through renovation in a an effort to maintain the feel of this cult classic but at the same time improve ambiance.

In beverages started with a strong beer served in their trademark brass mugs while in starters had Devilled Crab. The crab is one of the heritage dishes they are still proud of. Indeed a classic one with presentation and taste. Creamy cheese with tender crab meat melts in your mouth.

In main course had Chicken A La Kiev. A Russian classic with filled butter inside. However due to too much frying the outer crispy shell lost its taste. 

Similarly in dessert the Baked Alaska is an innovative dish but again didn't like the taste or didn't feel any taste at all.

Service is at snail's speed. Servers are absent minded, one have to chase them for order status update. Wallet pinch, obviously who have to pay the price for having a bite at the heritage.

This is an old world charming restaurant ,with its decor and staff very well trained.
One of the oldest restaurants  in kolkatta,with the perfect location, this is one of the few places one shouldn't miss.
I had just one disadvantage- being a vegetarian.
They have an explicit choice for poultry and sea food.
Ordered spinach and cheese pillows for starters , their signature lasagne, and veg surprise accompanied by freshly baked bread rolls (which were so fresh that our bread literally melted over it)
We had absolutely no complaints with regards to the food,be it taste ,quality or quantity.
A must visit if your out on a date .

This is one of "The Landmarks" in Park Street, and one going on a weekend is surely find a long queue. The usp of this place is the fine blend of cusines with drinks. It intelligently caters to virtually all age groups to their satisfaction. The staff is well experienced and the dim lit ambience adds to the flavour of tyhe place. Personally I preffer this place for continental and Italian dishes. The pastas and spagettis are a real treat to have. My all time favourate has been Devilled Crab and Fish florentine which in turn happens to be the usp of the place. The sizzlers are worth trying as well. Rarely had ventured into the Indian cusine (too many places to have that) but the few time that i had was not dissapointing in terms of taste.Comming to desserts (who doesnt love them). Mocambo probably has some of the best in the area. the brownie with hot chocolate simply melts in the mouth. Baked Alaska is some visual treat !! and so is the scoufle. The has stood the test of time and shall continue to flourish.

Nothing much to say about this place as it is already a popular name among people who are looking for some good quality continental dishes. A variety of sizzlers, taste is undoubtedly awesome. Quantity is more than enough. For a person with normal apetite a single plate of sizzler will be enough. I'd suggest rather than trying some traditional dishes, explore the wide range of continental dishes and sizzlers they have. Their dessert menu is good and everyone of them demands a try.

We had gone to Mocambo sometime back. The amibience was really nice. We ordered Betcky Bell Muniere and Devilled Crab as starter. Both the items are full of molten cheese and very soft. We liked them. In the main course we had fish a la matarde and mutton steak. Fish a la matarde is soaked in mustard sauce. This kind of decreased Betcki's actual taste is what I felt. Mutton steak is good. Now coming to the part I didn't like. The service is slowest I have seen in years. If you have 3 hours of relaxed time at your hand at least, then only visit this place.

Here in Calcutta ( prefer the name) for a conference. Heard a lot bout this place for its continental. For starters ordered spinach cheese pillows which were really good ! Chicken stroganoff was ok   But chicken Kiev was too bland for my north India spicy palate . Ambience good but the service too slow! Overall a just ok experience!

Excellent place to be for a celebration with your near and dear ones.
Been there a number of times, still only one word can express my love for Mocambo; "Amazing!!"
Be it the sizzlers or other continental dishes, Mocambo lies deep within my heart.
Lovely place that carries the legacy of my ever green native place.
Some must try dishes they mention as heritage are Prawn Cocktail, Chicken A la Mocambo, Fish Stake Sizzler, Chicken Stake and a lot more.
Another delicacy of mine is Browny with ice cream and hot chocolate sauce. Melts in every bite.
Ready to be amazed whenever you step in.

One of the oldest and famous restaurants in kolkata , you can never get bored of this place... They have so many things to offer you.

Location(4/5): Located amidst the busiest roads of Park Street, the parking will be the biggest challenge... For sure you will park in one end and the restaurant will be on the other end... Expecting a pre-reservation? Then you must be in a dreamland... This is mocambo... You've got to have a lot of patience.... The wait time nearly an hour(minimum)... But the wait is worth.... The result is delicious...

Food(5/5): My sister and i was already half full because of the park street food festival so we decided to jump onto the main course directly.... My sister ordered Chicken chipolata which was a combination of chicken, bacon, sausage and herbs.... I am a bacon lover and this combination was mind blowing... It was presented superbly.... But i am a lobster lover as well... So for me it had to be Lobster Thermidor.... The filling inside the lobster was meat, cheese and herbs.... You should definitely try this out... Even if are not a lobster lover you will fall in love with this....

Ambience(5/5): top-notch and perfect for couples who are looking for a candle-light dinner place....

Service(3.5/5): the service was quite slow... Actually wont blame any one for this... It was indeed quite crowded.... A little improvement will be just perfect...

Digraceful ! Disgusting ! Inhuman ! What more can I use for scumbags like you. Touted to be one of the most talked about and heritage restaurants, I am ashamed that I had once given a good rating to such filthy piece of shits! I take back all my words. Considering the filthy mentality, I guess even tasting the food shall poison me.
Get this straight! When it comes to food, nobody is an upper class, middle class or lower class. Every person on this earth has the right to enter a restaurant and eat the food there. No one has the right to demean a person whosoever may it be. Moreover, we do not eat your food for free. We pay for it, and oh boy! we actually shell out a huge amount for your so called "fine dining" restaurant. The staffs are really bad, the appearance of the restaurant is filthy and you have the audacity to speak ill about a person in this way.
Extremely sorry to say folks, I ge has now come to cook the food and eat it all by yourself because your end has arrived!
Thank you for restoring our faith in inhumanity!

Heard a lot about it.... and finally got to visit The Mocambo... i dont know about mogambo but mai to khus hua :P it has a old but posh and distinctly dress code of the staff reminds of the time when Kolkata was called Calcutta. Coming to food we ordered crab devilers with a cocktail . in the mains we had a beef steak in mushroom sauce and ham sizzlers singapore .      So definitely once more.

 Try to check in a bit early .. as it gets crowded and noisy afterwards.

Mocambo truly lives upto its fame of one of the best resturant in kolkata serving mouth watering delicacies over the years. It didnt disappoint me on my first visit either. The cooperative staff helped me to choose the best of the best dishes. Murg Firdousi Kabab set the tone as a starter followed by a stuffed Vetki speciality and phew!!! we had to chill with a Baked Alaska to sign out for the eve. A visit must for all.

Highly average experience, really think the place is overrated. The only reason why the place has a high rating is because of the staff. 

We went here on a Saturday evening and it was crowded which automatically resulted in slow service. 

Ordered the Chicken Pavlograd, the Fish a la Diana, the Beckty Belle Helen, the Grilled Chicken Sizzler and the Corn and Cheese Salad. 

The salad was good, the Belle Helen was delicious, the Sizzler was average, but the problem elements were the Pavlograd and the Diana. Something wasn't right with both their stuffing. Another downside was that the Pavlograd was chopped up and then served. 

Expected more but didn't get as much.

A heritage restaurant of Kolkata, located at the junction of Park Street and Mirza Ghalib Street. The ambience is excellent, the tables, the lights, the chairs all scream HERITAGE. Not much has changed over the years, the service is still of Gold Standards.
A very good place to visit with family or for official lunches/dinners.
On our most recent visit we ordered Chicken Pavlograd and Angels on Horseback. The taste of each was as good as ever. 
After a good lunch I felt like saying 'MOGAMBO khush hua'.
It's impossible to savour all the flavours of Mocambo in one visit...you need to come here on numerous occasions to try out the different stuff that they serve. I assure you every visit will be worth it, as has been the case for me.
Nothing much to add....keep going Mocambo.

There's very little I can add as a reviewer of Mocambo. It is a legend and, finally, when I went for my first meal there, I found that it lived up to its billing. The Deviled Crabs and the stuffed Crepes in Orange Sauce are to die and kill for. I will surely be back! And the prices have been kept at a "value for money" level - and that's such a relief.

The food was no doubt tasty and ambience good too but the behaviour of the staff spoiled the mood. The head waiter had a horrible mode of conduct and sense of hospitality. And the wait time was also a lot. Seemed as if they have a shortage of chefs as a result of which the queue time is long. It seemed as if the old Mocambo has lost itself somewhere down the timeline. Hope that it finds its old self back some time soon...

Located on Mirza Ghalib street in between Tung fong and CCD, Mocambo is one of the leading restaurants offering the Continental cuisine in our city.
                     My friend and I went for a dinner that comprised of 3 main course items and 2 desserts. Pork Sirloin Steak Sizzler was palatable but was a bit overcooked to our taste. Chicken Orientale A la Mocambo is a preparation of chicken fillets cooked in cream sauce and wine; topped with mushroom, tomato, asparagus and boiled egg; served with buttered rice. It was good but nothing extraordinary; tasted just like an Indian chicken preparation with rice. The item which really mesmerised us was Fish A la diana which is a preparation of bhetki stuffed with prawn in cream sauce. The fishballs were well cooked, soft and really delicious.
                As dessert, we chose Brownie with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce which by definition was tantalizingly delectable. But the Souffle A la Surprise Mocambo was surprisingly  disappointing as we couldnot differ its taste from that of a pastry from any bakery shop.
                  The eatery is spacious with comfortable seating arrangements, although I would have been happier if the two sitter tables were a bit larger...it could hardly fit 2 dishes at a time. Further, the servers' performance was bit of a let down as they served all the 3 main course items together (we hadnot ordered an appetizer) and we had to request them to take one item away so that we could have some space to eat.
                 Overall I would say that my experience in this restaurant dint meet my expectations from it.

Theres really nothing much to explain what mocambo means to the foodies of Calcutta. The legendary restaurant with a oh-so-posh feeling interior also satisfies your tastebuds especially from their continental menu. I personally feel chicken ala kiev or the newer version of chicken pavlograd is a bit overhyped one . I mean its great ..but nothing to go gaga about. Chicken chippoutala on the other hand treats you well if you are meat craver. Fisdoushi kebab was good. Which was surprising was baked alaska... you will go on having it yet to discover the "mysterious" meringue (i think so) dessert. Perfect end to a fine dining experience

Pros:
* The food's good (no doubt), especially their continentals
* The ambience is good (one can spend a couple of merry hours with who you come with)

Cons:
* For the ridiculously high price u pay (with all the taxes in the world levied), if you expect a good treatment in return, This Is Not The Place for you.  Should something go wrong, the management will blatantly say it on your face "It is your fault that you did not keep a tab on our service". 

Verdict - Up to you to decide.  Happy Munching (but not at the cost of your pride :) )

Well,not sure if its a speciality here but all of us ordered their sizzlers,albeit different ones at that.Took quiet a bit of time for the food to arrive.Mine was chicken steak sizzler.Surprisingly not developed a taste for it as it was way too bland.Must be very healthy but not so preferable for my taste buds.Had to add salt and pepper too many times.Quantity was generous.However vegetarian sizzler seemed slightly better.Next time will try trying the recommended stuffs on their menu.

The heritage place of kolkata that serves the best food and quality service. Been there today after a long time. The signature dish Ala kiev was my choice. Poke it and your plate is flooded with butter oozing out from it. Angels on horse back another delicacy, that is fillet of chicken wrapped in bacon served on a bed of onion and sausage risotto, Fish florentine( beckty steak baked with cheese and sausage and chopped spinach), Macaroni cheese casserole( pasta cooked in cream and cheese sauce till light brown colour).  Ambience is very pleasant. Service is good.

Short review:-

Food-4.5/5
Price-3.5/5
Ambience-4.5/5
Hygiene-4.5/5
Parking-3/5

Detail:-

One of the elite restaurants situated on Park Street food hub. Nice ambience. Food is equally good. Good service. The thing I like about this place is that it is not too noisy, not too silent. Very enthusiastic crowd. Someone there to celebrate, someone there just as regular. The restaurant has a European touch to it. Especially the window side appeals me a lot. Coming to food, must try- prawn cocktail or crab cocktail. Its a creamy concoction of sauce and mashed prawn/ crab. Its a delicacy out here. Look out for heritage tags against the menu items, which are traditional dishes of the restaurant. Chicken A La Kiev is a Russian delicacy with molten butter inside a chicken cutlet. With peas and carrot. It sinfully melts into a great stuff. Drunk prawn is another delicacy which is famous here. Its prawn cutlet served with honey dip and a sour dip. The dips were bit diluted and the cutlets bit not so tasty inside. But they were crunchily cooked. Chicken Paprika was a sweet sauced chicken pieces with macaroni and onion and carrot pieces. Meat lasagne was nicely cooked with right mix of spicy meat and creamy lasagne. Wonder part is that even serve chanachur/ chakna/ namkeen along with drinks. That's surprising considering even this is pretty upscale restaurant. Meal for 4 with 6 dishes and 6 drinks costed 4k.

This is one of those vintage restaurants in the heart of Park Street which needs no recommendation.The ambience is so cozy and relaxing! Just perfect for family dinner / a date or  be it a business lunch. You have to be really lucky to get a table on weekends without waiting outside.I have seen celebrities waiting outside this restaurant and trust me, we never mind waiting even for hours.Few recommendations from my favorites:1) Fish A La Diane : Those who love cheese, prawn and bhetki fish2) Chicken Cordon Blue3) Devilled Crab : This dish is a special recommendation for those who loves to eat crab but does not want to struggle with the shells.  Crab meat is served in the crab shell and all we need to use a spoon to enjoy the meat.

Located in the heart of Park Street, Mocambo offers a wide range of continental dishes. Being one of the most popular and old restaurant of Kolkata, you may find its dealing with a huge crowd in the busy hours, so be prepared for a waiting time. They do not have any waiting area, so there is place but the front porch of the restaurant. Food is decent here. We had baked chicken, baked fish, creme of chicken and chocolate soufflé. The fish and chicken were delicious, good taste, accompanied with assorted veggies and garlic bread. The creme of chicken is a must try here. The soufflé is nice, but it requires to have a better consistency. Overall nice experience.

Mocambo. The name itself is enough. Veg Canneloni like none other. Tetrazzini that blows you away. Garlic Toast baked to perfection. Veg Seekh Kabab extremely sumptuous. And a Tutty Fruitie to top it all.Old-world charm, quick service, unmatched taste and total value for money. I would never be able to enjoy Continental stuff in Delhi anymore having had a taste of Mocambo.

This is one place I have visited quite a few times but never wrote about it! Last night spend here with close friends was real fun and hence its review time, finally!
I have been a great fan of their alluring menu for ages.. Have tried a lot of their varieties. Last night though, we went for full-monty!
Devilled Crab, Pork Sirloin Steak Sizzler & Chateaubriand Beef Steak (both with Mushroom sauce), Fish Florentine, and Meat Lasagne... You cannot choose one to be your favorite! Though my lion's share was of Fish Florentine, but we did taste each other's dish.. Pork Sirloin was a perfect balance of crispiness and juiciness! & the Florentine, was a poetry in the mouth! Devilled Crab is something I always order and it never ever disappoints! For desserts, Creme Caramel and Chocolate Brownie with Vanilla IC and Chocolate Sauce...Both were as good as it can get! All this went with some beer and cocktails! We randomly ordered Whiskey Sour and ended up having loads of it! It has a delightful taste (but the quantity of whiskey is only 30 ml). My friends from Bangalore had a superb time and so did my Kolkata friend and I! A dinner which will stay in our memories not just for the food and drinks, but for the time spent !! I think that is what places like Mocambo are all about!

It's been a long time since I have visited Mocambo. I think they have extended the place because it definitely looked much bigger. Although the ambiance is good the service is little slow. The food here is much overrated, starting from the Mulligatawny soup to Baked Alaska. The Garlic prawn as a starter and Chicken Mocambo as a main were the only ones I can say were good. Other than that the Devilled Crab, Beckty Belle Helen and Chicken a la Kiev were very much ordinary. The sizzler( Chicken Chipolata ) which Mocambo is so famous for was a huge disappointment. Even the fresh lime soda came in a small glass compared to other eateries.
Alhough all three desserts like Chocolate Delight, Baked Alaska and Crepe with chocolate sauce looked very tempting, the taste could not match the look. The Baked Alaska was all fluff and I have tasted better.

Also if you are a fan of prawns, the crab meat and prawns risotto is a must have!

If you want to have a good continental dinner or lunch, you know where to go. Old world charm, dim lights, great food. Nothing to complain about.

This was one of my favourite restaurant in Calcutta, but today's dinner did change my views. The food was not upto Mocambo's mark,well I expected much tastier food which I have tasted here so many times earlier. Hope to see, that this thing has changed & Mocambo is again serving their best.

Changing my rating to 1 in the wake of recent discrimination. Will never ever visit your place!

In stiff competition with their next door neighbours, this place is as good as it can get. 
One thing about Kolkata is that the food scenario never ceases to amaze me. If you are visiting this city, then there are a couple of places you would not want to miss at any cost. 
Great ambiance, good food and you have to book in advance. During the pujas you are lucky if you get a reservation...

Amazing place to catch up with friends, priced according to the quality and quantity, located right at the heart of the city, and amazing service and ambience. Steak, pork sausages, crab cocktail and pork dishes are the best out there.

The taste of the sizzlers in  Mocambo never cease to amaze me, although I have been there so many times. This time I ordered Chateaubriand Beef Steak and my ordered Fish Wellington. In the deserts we had Brownie with Hot Chocolate Sauce and Vanilla Ice cream and Tutti Frooti Ice cream.

If you want to experience good continental food than definitely I would suggest Mocambo undoubtedly. I have been here many times n they have never disappointed me. Their interior, service n quality of food, everything thing is excellent. Steak n Grills are definitely must try here. Highly recommendable.

So u guys are judging people by their dress?Do u have a dress code ? If not then why??? Shame on u guys...will never  visit  this cheap place anymore 

Came here with a lot of expectations but was fully dissapointed. First of all the manager gave us a bad seat where there was no dimlights and the table was litle bit dirty even there were good seats available. When we asked him whether we can change our seat or not he gave fake excuses that those tables were meant for family purpose only.

Now coming to food we ordered Angels on horseback,Irish chateaubriand beef steak and hot brownie with vanilla ice cream. We have to wait for more than half an hour for the foods to be served after order.

Angels on horse back is served with rice,bacon,pasta,peas,carrots and chicken pieces. The rice was just plain rice covered with a sweet sauce,the chicken was tasteless..it was just like boiled chicken dipped in sweet sauce.

Irish chateaubriand beef steak was okayish....nothing special just like any ordinary beef steaks.

Hot Brownie with vanilla ice cream was very good.

Time and again, Mocambo has been recommended to me by sources all around! Finally I visited the place, last afternoon.
You will have to wait for sometime as the place is always crowded and gather attention not only from Indians but also from non-Indian tourists. Once you enter the place and head over to your table, you wont complain the wait. After you have consumed your dishes, you will say, "It was worth the wait!"
We had ordered Chicken Tetrazinni, Chicken Chipolat noa and Chateaubriand Beef steak. The sizzlers were indeed tasty, but the one dish that won my heart was the Tetrazinni! The sauce was delicious and the chicken was absolutely yummy! I wonder why Tetrazinni hasn't featured in the recommended dishes list for this page.

Overall - 4
Food - 4.5

Best fish tikka ever. Being a novice to coastal cuisine, I was very apprehensive about it. However, the smell dispelled those apprehensions. Succulent, juicy, tangy and oh so tasty, the dish was a sheer delight. The decor is cosy... it is just a shadow of its former self but the service is still as fantastic. Had a brilliant experience here, not giving it a rating of five only because I got to taste only the fish tikka (heavenly, I reiterate).

Oh and pocket friendly.

Mocambo is regarded as one of the best restaurants of Kolkata providing delectable continental cuisine..It surely serves good food as long as you are interested in the items available as starters or main course but the once you focus on the dessert the scenario changes for the worse.the chef at Mocambo really needs to undergo a proper training at making simple desserts like the baked Alaska or the chocolate mousse...I say this because when I ordered the former at one of my visits to Mocambo I was served a semi burnt avatar of the same and at one of my next visit when I desired to devour a chocolate mousse I found myself gulping down spoons of whipped cream mixed with chocolate sauce it was horrendous to put in one word.I mean seriously do they actually know what junk they are serving behind the disguise of a popular dessert name..we pay a good amount of money for dining at popular restaurants as Mocambo  and this was not expected of them,they cannot fool their customers and patrons in such a cheap way.

Mocambo has always been one of my favourite restaurants. The angels on horse back is a must try and also one of my absolute favourites is the devilled crab. Quite often you have to wait in a queue before getting to enter but the wait is absolutely worth it. The decor is very vintage and old worldly. Its one of the legendary restaurants in Kolkata and rightly so. Definitely should be on foodie bucket list.

I tried chicken sizzler, fish sizzler and beef steak (well made). In spite of being a rush season on New Year's eve, the quality of food was nevertheless extremely good. The only downside is that we had to wait for 30min to finally eat what we ordered. Out of the above three, beef steak is a must try at Mocambo! Will definitely be there again.

So, this is one of the legendary restaurants in Park St, Kolkata. Been there for ages and the quality hasn't faltered. I went there for a family dinner. Had to wait nearly 30mins in a queue but I didn't mind coz its the price you have to pay to eat at a famed restaurant. Once inside, and when we had placed the order, we got the food soon enough. We had ordered Fish florentine, stroganoff and tetrazzini. All were equally tasty. The tetrazzini could have been less of gravy though. The stroganoff was just perfect. Unlike the usual chinese preparation of soups that are available everywhere else, they serve cream of chicken soupes that I loved. I've  The waiters still wear turbans and the entire place still has a mid 1900's aura about it with the yellow lamps . Looking forward to dine here again.

Mocambo is one of the Legendary restaurants of Park Street, Kolkata famous for it's continental food. We tried out the Cream of Spring Chicken soup which tasted creamy and good. As starter, we ordered  Beckty Bell Muniere (Boneless Beckty) which tasted sweet and creamy and delicious. For main course we ordered Chicken Pavlograd, Chicken A La Kiev and Chicken Steak with Mushroom sauce. Chicken A La Kiev and the Steaks in Mocambo do not need any introduction. The Pavlograd was like the A La Kiev with Cheese and Butter inside instead of just butter. The Pavlograd is too heavy and A La Kiev is recommended instead of Pavlograd. For dessert, we ordered Baked Alaska, a signature dish in Mocambo. However, this dish disappointed me and was not up to my expectations. The baked alaska had a thick egg coating and the custard ice cream inside seemed to be less, which I personally did not like.
There are no complaints regarding their service and the restaurant has an old world charm and the colonial hangover. If you want to get a flavour of real "Calcutta" this is definitely the place to visit.

A very good atmosphere and ambience, with a wide range of delicious dishes. It's ambience resembles of an English style restaurant with classic and chivas decorations. We ordered chicken tandoori and kebabs as starter which were too good. I didn't like their raita mich as it was sweet and I prefer the 'original' one with sour 'dahiwala' taste. Overall, it's a calm place to have good food 😋 with family as well as friends and has well cooperated and decent staffs.

The place needs no special introduction to  generations of food lovers out there...I personally call this restaurant a phenomena in continental cuisine...with probably the widest continental menu , almost all the global delicacies  will take u through a memorable gastronomic trip ..from the chicken -ala- Kiev (for those who don't mind the extra butter) through chicken Madagascar to  Sicilian chicken, it feels like an unending journey baked with love and expertise ... the steak sizzlers are wonderful too esp for those who like it brown ...the vegeterian delicacies like lasagna and au-gratin are good too.. for those with a sweet tooth, one can choose between Baked Alaska and sweet caramel amongst the other desserts..
The best part  is that the portions are good and aren't very overpriced considering the way they tantalise the taste buds... ! It truly deserves all the adoration it boasts of!

A restaurant that bears a heritage of serving some legendary continental, italian and north indian. Yesterday was my first visit to here. This food joint wasn't that crowded and we immediately could get a seat of seven people. We tried their meat lasagne which was extremely creamy, cheesy and melted immediately inside the mouth, chilly baby corn and risotto alla florentina. All of the dishes tasted really amazing. Coming to service, it was very very poor!

The place is a disaster...had lunch there and went with 'continental' as they are supposedly good at that...devilled crab and chicken tettrazini...both were gooey cheesy gunk...neither crab nor chicken can be tasted...everything carpet bombed into submission by the cheese. They were gracious enough to bill us only for the chicken paprika...which we ate as we were desperately hungry...that too barely passed muster...greasy raj/railway dishes from the 40s and 50s...completely out of sync with the times...I can imagine a regular diet here leading to a massive coronary...

Ambience- Lovely, warm ambience suited for a romantic dinner with your lover. Loved the soft lighting. The kind place where one can have wine, Italian food, and a heartfelt conversation. 

Food- Damn delicious. Had Fish Florentine, Fish a la moutarde and Veg Sizzler. Absolutely loved Fish Florentine. Fish a la moutarde was delicious, and the sizzler was pretty good. Had brownie with ice cream and hot chocolate sauce for dessert. Nothing unique 'cause you get it almost everywhere. But as expected, it was wonderful.

Had to wait a lot for my turn. But it was definitely worth it, just like my Peter Cat experience.

I was in Kolkata last week, and had planned to eat here.

We had an exceedingly pleasurable Christmas lunch here.

I am not going to write about the interiors as that was low on my list - suffice to say that it was warm and welcoming.

The service was efficient, prompt, and courteous. What more do you need? 

Our server knew the menu well, was very patient with us [gave us plenty of time to peruse the menu] and based on our preferences, made excellent recommendations.

We had :

The Fish A La Diana - creamy and delicious.
The Beckty Belle Helen - grilled fish, and very tasty. 
The Pork Sirloin Steak - soft and delicious, and the best I have tasted in a long time.

Everything was perfect, and I deeply regret that my wife and I had no time for a second visit to try more on the menu. 

Very, very highly recommended. A *must-visit* if you are in Kolkata and like continental cuisine. Seriously.

This place has always been one of my favourite restaurants in Kolkata. Located very conveniently in Park Street corner, it has good food, nice drinks, helpful staff in proper attire and a laid back comfortable ambience. Start with prawn cocktail and finish with baked Alaska. Anything that you choose in between is bound to bowl you over. On events and ocassions, the place can be quite crowded.

I maybe a little biased towards writing this review as i am a true mocambo fan. Frankly this place is no less than a heritage for a true kolkata foodie. Located in park street this place holds a class of its own. The place is more than almost five decades old and till date it stands as one of the most legendary restaurant of kolkata. I have been to this place many times and i absolutely love it here. Be it the cozy sitting arrangements, the ambience, the hanging lights over the table as their hallmark or the brilliant dishes served, the place is top notch in every aspect. My favourite amongst the dishes is chicken chipolata. This is a must ordered dish from my side whenever there. It is a very well ensemble dish, with a big piece of chicken, bacon and sausgaes along with pasta and fried potatoes. The sauce in which the dish is tossed is delicious. Another favourite of mine is their speciality chicken orientale a ala mocambo. This is an excellent cooked dish with a light buttery rice and mushroom and chicken in a savoury curry. The fish steak, the chicken pablograv and fish a la diana are some of the other dishes i had here. Needless to say each has a distinct taste and yummy to the core. The dishes served here are also visually also very enticing. The price of the dishes are perfectly in sync with the quantity and definitely the quality of the food. However if visiting this place on a weekend there is an invariable queue in front of the place and a wait of half an hour is quite common. The waiting time almost increases to an hour on festive days. But if an ardent foodie to the core, the food here is worth the wait. I love the food here and this place is highly reccomended for all the food lovers out there.

Our friend turned Santa Swarnadip Chatterjee surprised us with a sumptuous treat here. At the end, even after retiring to my home it feels like a dream which just doesn't want to snap.
Lets begin at the beginning. Longchamps 750ml tastes sublime especially when accompanied with Chicken Pavlograd & Fish Diana. Personally, Fish Diana was a little better, keeping in mind the tough competition it had. They literally increased the hunger!
Deciding not to confuse our tastebuds with rice, roti or any of the kind we went straight to the Irish Beaf Steak, & Mixed Tandoori Sizzler. Sizzling Sizzler sizzled our slurping tongue and lifted us to gastronomical heaven.
With Mocambo on plate, sauted in friendship, the evening left us glowing from within. It is a warmth we will definitely remember with a fond reminiscence!

Had I not given a 5 star rating, I would have done great injustice to this place :)
Mocambo is located on the left side once you turn left from Park St McDonald's. If you plan to arrive on weekends, I wish you good luck for the queue !

The ambience is superb. They specialize in their sizzlers. Almost on every table, you will notice sizzlers being served. We ordered creme of soup with spring chicken + some drinks as starters and 'chicken steak' + 'grilled chicken' in main course. The soup was unique and tasted excellent. I personally preferred the chicken steak. The waiters are very courteous and they took very less time for serving the food, in spite the restaurant was very crowded.  I will definitely visit again and again.

I took fish a LA Diana  and a bottle of sprite . 

The fish a LA Diana was just too good , fish balls with smashed potato with vegetables .

One of the better thing I had for a long time .

Total cost 544rs . A bit on the  higher side but you expected the price in here .

The ambiance was  nice as usual . 

PS. If the restaurant authority starts WiFi then I will give five to them . Hope they will read my review .

I am exploring Kolkata and this place is suppose to be the most popular as far as good continental food is concern , so i had to go there. About the ambiance , it is very spacious yet cosy, it reminds of good fancy restaurants of 90s unlike the cafe and pubs of today's time. Personally i loved the tables facing the street sides,it gives you a sneak peek at the hush hush  of the street while you calmly enjoy your food and drinks, so overall its gives you a happy feeling. Coming to the food , they have amazing menu , they have enormous option to chose and everything seems tempting so i took good 15 minutes to chose while sipping my drink. Food tastes as good as is advertised in the menu. The steaks are must try and pork chops to die for . Their desserts are very authentic , i tried the caramel one it was exactly it should be without any Indian touch to it. So to summarize , if you want to have amazing food other than Bengali in Kolkata , this is the best choice.

The quality of the food is simply awesome. Been there for most of my dates and special occasions. Its the best restaurant in Kolkata. Try fish Diana and chicken ala Kiev ...too much on calorie..but u won't mind munching it. Superb...@Rajannya Raha

Came here on a friday afternoon at 2pm for lunch and luckily we didnot have to wait! However it was crowded and almost full to its capacity.
The decor and ambience of this place is posch and classy nd resembled with petercat except that it was brighter..However it is quite conjested. Owing to the heritage of this place, the old school ambience is quite unique and appealing..However it looks a little rugged, and i felt a bit of renovation would do.
Now,coming to the food, we had ordered meat lasagne, angels on a horseback, chicken siciliene and an irish cheteaubriand beef steak .
The meat lasagne was really good in taste.. grounded meat in a rich creamy baked cheese layer..was blissful in taste. Highly reccomended.
Next ,the chicken siciliene was a similar dish but milder in taste accompanied by a half boiled egg on top nd a few assortment of veggies and potato.. it tasted delectable with soft tender chicken coated in creamy cheese sauce.
The angels on a horseback is a real deal here.
Accompanied by onion nd sausage rissoto nd a small portion of pasta wid few veggies nd potatoes..it makes for a complete meal. The bacon wrapped chicken was delightful..nicely spiced tender chicken cubes with nicely roasted bacon strips on top..too good to be true... must try!
Next came the irish chateuabrind beef steak accompanied by garlic sauce. I opted for a well done steak instead of a medium done..
So the meat was tougher..however i liked it.. i wud say medium done are d best but sometimes if undercooked, the steak can spoil ur whole eating xperience so i didnot take any chance nd opted fr d well done. It tasted really good nd was nicely charred...the garlic sauce really complemented the steak..overall the best steak i had in kolkata so far..however wud go back for the medium 1 next tym.
The portions of the meal is apparently quite small for some dishes.. the service is very slow..we had to wait for an hour or more before we got served..servers are polite but dont expect an waiter to attend ur table all the time.
Also some dishes can have more meat nd less of the rich creamy sauce that has an overpowering effect sometimes..
But then this a heritage institution just like petercat nd some of their dishes are truely minblowing!
Must visit.. this place has an aura of its own!!

Mocambo, is one of those places which have achieved a legendary status over the times. Situated in Park Street, Mocambo is "THE" place for continental food. This was my second visit. I ordered Chicken Steak and Chicken Tettrazini. Both the dishes were absolutely cooked to perfection. Quantity is a little less but one dish is sufficient for one person! Mocambo probably serves the best steaks and sizzlers in Kolkata. Happy Eating! :)

The old world charm and topnotch food beckons me to visit this joint quite often. You cannot go wrong with this place, ever. I love ordering the Sizzlers, and the Chicken Tetrazzini is my all-time favourite. The Baked Alaska could do with some improvement though.

This is one of the olden golden places of Kolkata. Located in Park Street, it has a cizy atmosphere and crazy good food. Been there quite a number of times - the latest being in March this year - and this place has never disappointed. 
We had the Devilled Crab which was mindblowing! We also had Angels on horseback and Fish Muniere. All of them heavenly.

Mocambo is an all time classic restaurant. Been there quite a few times, for celebrating special ocassions! But in my recent visits i feel like, the food isnt as great as it used to be, the sizzlers were dull. And the service wasnt satisfactory too, like there were plenty of free tables with no rush, still they made us sit in a crampy 2seater, even after requesting for a change. One can only visit for the legendary status, but not for the continental food!

Let's face it. I love Mocambo.

Despite the lines, despite the ridiculous crowd, the frustration at having to wait, the at-times-disappointing food, I love this place. Why? Because I love Park Street. And Park Street is just not what it is without Mocambo. And well, Peter Cat. Way too many times that we have been here. Went last week with a friend who has never visited Mocambo in her 30+ years of existence! Now that had to corrected right? This time we surprisingly didn't have to wait much. Maybe because it was a week night? Anyhow, we ordered our usual round of beer that comes with the neat bowl of chanachur. For starters we had what we always have, the devilled crab. Baked, cheesy crab meat in the half shell with a wee slice of boiled egg on top. Sheer decadence. It's been our eternal favourite and frankly the main course seems tame after this. Anyhow, my boyfriend ordered a good old fashioned A La Kiev. The buttery goodness oozing out of the deliciously crumbed chicken. It's how perfection tastes, I believe. My friend ordered a scampi risotto, it was cheesy and nice, I tried a spoonful, but I didn't quite fancy it. My cousin had a bacon risotto which was really very good. My friend's husband had a fish steak sizzler in white sauce, which was pretty bland, but fresh and nice otherwise. I was as always confused about what to have. I have a hard time deciding between the Fish a la Diana or the chicken steak sizzler or the Bhetki Bell Muniere. (Please don't have the chicken sizzler with the fried egg, it tastes like a train wreck). This time I wanted to try something I have had before. So I ordered the Fish a la Moutarde. And it was sheer DIVINITY. Maybe because the Bangali in me is a sucker for all things mustard, who knows these things? It was like an exquisite, anglicized version of bhetki paturi blended with cheesy goodness and came with a side of vegetables and fragrant rice. The fish was so fresh and baked to perfection, and the mustard was strong and sharp- just the way I love it. 

Crowd or no crowd, muttered curses under the breath or happy, wistful sighs while gently patting the belly, I cannot help but love Mocambo. There's just something so classy about the typically European decor and ambiance, right from the inverted tulip shaped red lights to the seating.

And if someone likes Indian then do try out the Murgh Musallam, it's the best in Kolkata! The decor too is legendary, such that you can identify the restaurant just by the decor! Do arrive at the restaurant with an hour in hand and have patience!

My tryst with Mocambo was a short lived one. It was already late and we almost had to rush through the dinner. The food, however, lived up to its reputation. 

We had Chicken Ala- Kiev and Motton Steak. The steak was cooked to perfection and was served with potatoes and fresh green vegetables. The ala kiev was sinful-oozing of thick creamy butter.

This place has so much more to offer. I am definitely visiting again, the next time I am in Kolkata.

Have visited Mocambo several times since my college days years back. It is one of the institutions of Kolkata which probably every food loving Calcuttan has visited at some point of time or the other. While I did not feel the need to review this place as its already legendary with most people knowing about it, my last few visits to the restaurant prompted me to put in a review which could probably make my experience better there.

Although some of the dishes that Mocambo serves are still good, somehow I felt in my last few visits that place was diminishing in its over all quality. The place has an old feel charm which is still there, but that does not justify peeling walls, old and ill maintained chairs and couches and stained carpets. These are basics in a good restaurant which should be well maintained no matter what the stature. Mocambo is not a cheap restaurant and meal does cost 700-800/head. At the range its important to maintain this. I also found the floor staff to be a little too inflexible in terms of requests which I remember they use to accommodate a few years back. Food is still good, but then the restaurant needs an upgrade. 

Some might argue that this would change its legendary aura but then it does not mean basic restaurant interiors need not be well maintained.

Being a foodie I always wanted to visit this particular restaurant on numerous occasions but the place is so much in demand ,we couldn't get the opportunity. But finally my wish came true on a Saturday lunch treat :) Excellent place ,Nice cozy comfortable ambience and to add on this the service is very prompt and interactive.We ordered for Pork Cutlet ,Ham Stake with Mushroom sauce Grilled fish in white sauce and some dessert ..oh n yes dat GIMLET was excellent.. Punching of gin with lime cordial was so perfect :)

Withdrawing my good reviews..Shame on management .

I know it is difficult to tackle so much people in a single day but still I would say it is not that welcoming anymore as it was in my very first visit . 

Fourth visit with my team ...ate a lot .as usual food is great and my new favourite is Pork Sirloin Steak .

A legendary place that I believe has kept its reputation intact purely by maintaining the quality of food. Chicken Tetrazzini, Chicken Paprika, Mushroom Garlic Prawns were all perfect. Our vegeterian friends were also happy with the lasagne and dal makhini. Paneer was just ok. The desserts and cocktails multiplied the goodness of this place. Gimlet and collins are perfect as a light drink in the afternoon. Brownie and strawberries were a perfect end to our little reunion lunch! Cheers to the Mocambo team!

Some places are legendary for a reason. Mocambo in Park Street is definitely one of them. With its dimly lit interiors, paintings on the walls, with the low hanging red lamps at each table decorated with a small brass pot with flowers, it has a wonderful ambience.

The Chicken Firdosi Kabab was quite interesting. A filling of chicken and dal encased in a thin layer of chicken, it was unlike any other kabab I have had before and tasted lovely with the green chutney and onions.

The main courses are definitely the star dishes at Mocambo. Delicious and filling, they form a complete meal all by themselves. The Fish a la Diana was lovely, with the tender bhetki (or beckty as they call it) contrasting with the textural bite of the prawns, all encased in a cream sauce that is to die for. Served with a side of mashed potatoes, carrots and peas, it was delicious.

The Angels on Horseback is another of their specialities. Huge chunks of perfectly cooked chicken wrapped in bacon with just the right proportion of meat and fat, served on a bed of risotto full of the flavour of caramelised onions and liberally sprinkled with sausage pieces, with some carrots, peas and pasta on the side, it is certainly my favourite dish of the lot.

The sizzlers at Mocambo are quite lovely too. The chicken chipolata sizzler is a huge mouthful, with a piece of chicken breast, 4 sausages, a piece of bacon, potatoes, carrots, peas and caramelised onions. And extremely appetizing it is, too.

Coming to dessert. The cream caramel was nice, with a touch of bitterness in the caramel sauce which I like. The Baked Alaska looked impressive but most of the meringue had become inedible on account of charring from the flame. Inside was a small portion of vanilla ice cream on a sponge cake base with some pineapple and walnut which tasted nice, but the portion size was a bit small for my liking.

Service was okay and the waiters were courteus. There are a lot of other really good dishes that I have yet to try, and I hope to do  no-nonsense, fuss free, delicious and filling meal, Mocambo is definitely the place for you.

It reminds us of the famous Mr.India dialogue 'Mocambo khush hua' but in this case Mocambo har time khush karta hain.
Visiting this place since last twenty years,the dishes are as consistent and as good as possible.
It is partial to name one or two signature dishes of this great culinary heaven,to my opinion most dishes are a class of its own.
my all time favourites are chicken a la kiev,fish a la diana,chateaubriand steak with pineapple sauce ,pork chops,fish belle meuniere and baked alaska.
The nan also bears a special mention as it is much better than most indian restaurants but I had it only twice.
The service is little laid back but the food helps us forget it.
You cannot be a complete kolkatan or a foodie if you have not eaten in this place atleast a few times.

This one time, the waiter had brought beef steak ordered by someone else, and its smoke caused the fire alarm to go off! Nice to know that safety arrangements are in place.

Well they say as a foodie you do not cover kolkatta if you didnt have meal at Mocambo. We had planned our last supper at Mocambo, it being saturday they did not take reservation, hence had to wait for 30 min; well worth it. Hospitality was outstanding. Tried Fish A Diana, staff recommendation, it was perfect, nicely cooked and very nice filling. Also had Chicken tikka masala, outstanding,  Also had recommendation to taste Baked Alaska, but had no space to adjust it, but never the less there is always a second time. Mocambo; will come to see you again...

I have been visiting Mocambo for the last forty years. My uncle used to take us there and as I grew up in Kolkata, it became a favourite place for me - whether for a quick drink after office hours or for a leisurely dinner with family. 

On the 19th of November, 2015, I visited Mocambo with my family and my in-laws. It was my mother-in-law's 75th birthday celebration and what better place to take her to than to one of Kolkata's fine dining experiences. Unfortunately, it was not to be so. 

We had a leisurely dinner with the typical Mocambo food that is legendary in its own right. However, after the meal we took out a cake that my wife had bought and cut it together, three generations celebrating a 75th birthday of someone loved dearly. And then in the midst of this celebration, a steward walks up to our table and says in a loud voice - "No outside food allowed!". I was speechless and asked him to repeat himself. "No outside food allowed" he said again. I was horrified. This was quickly turning into a disaster. I walked up to the floor manager and explained... "She's 75 years old. Couldn't your steward at least been a little more discreet? I understand you have rules. But imagine if your mother was in her place. How would she feel?" 

There is a distinction between fine dining and good food. Mocambo undoubtedly serves good food, but fine dining... well I'd say there are far better places in Kolkata or in this world that you can go to. 

This was my last visit to Mocambo. Will I miss the food? I don't think so. I'd rather go somewhere where food is served in an atmosphere of fine dining.

The restaurant is plush and neat and has a good ambience. The service was good and the quality of the food was good as well. Among the dishes, I felt the prawn cocktail was better than that at PeterCat. Moreover, the steaks were good. Among the desserts, the soufle is a must-try. People who want to have a taste of vintage Kolkata should visit this place. The entire experience will be memorable only if you are not cost-conscious.

They say........'Mocambo khush hua'
Sometimes this tag line does not suit to this restro not only because people has to wait for a considerable amount of time but also for the food they serve.
Had Angels on Horse Back, Chicken A La Kiev, Fish A la Diana,  Ham Steak, Devilled Crab. Angels on Horse Back was neatly wrapped chicken with bacon while Chicken A La Kiev was made of boneless chicken breast pounded and rolled around cold garlic butter. Both the items tasted great after adding salt to them. 
In fact rest of the items were kinda bland  until addition of some extra amount of salt.
Our not so satisfactory moments ended with Baked Alaska which had a classy presentation. And it didn't disappoint us in the end.

This is the all time fav place for lot of people of Kolkata. They make lovely deviled crabs and steaks are also quite. You can order anything here and you wont be disappointed. The only glitch is the management and their hospitality. They don't care for customer satisfaction that much cause the are overconfident of their stature. Management should improve  their behavior with old customers at least.

So during a 10 hour layover in Kolkata my friend decided to take me to Mocambo for lunch, and that I think is the best decision he has ever taken in his life. The place has a fan following, and I am saying that because we had to wait for a little over 45 minutes to get a seat on Saturday late afternoon. I am glad that I did that, even at the risk of being late for my flight. 

We ordered some lasagna, chicken steak sizzlers and drinks and all of that were just so great, along with nice ambiance and very friendly & articulate staffs who give you a sense of luxury dining even though the place is decently priced. I am looking forward to going back here when in Kolkata next time.

The place is fantastic. The ambience is really nice. I think it's the best continental restaurant in the city. The food is worth eating. It's just yummy, perfect treat to your testbuds. One should try Chicken Tetrrazini, Chicken Ala Kiev.. it's just awesome. The cost is also much less than described in zomato.Cost for two people will around 800 & your stomach will be filled that's for sure. One thing is that beer is not available, so beer lovers might avoid the restaurant, but in terms of food it is unavoidable.

A visit to Kolkata always includes a meal at this place. With its old world charm that included not only the interiors and furniture but also the cutlery (scratchy white plates) and waiters (some of them are so old you'd feel embarrassed being served by them). Be prepared for easy service and some Bengali chit chat with your servers. Their menu is huge and don't be worried if you get confused between the long list of continental and Indian dishes they serve. 
Must order their chilli cheese crab (a delicious concoction of crab meat, though scarce, and cheese sauce served in the crab shell itself), dinner roll (huge soft bread served per piece with butter to mop up the goodness around your plate). Tried a chicken dish at the suggestion of the server (it was deliciously prepared with succulent chicken and such a yum gravy; I couldn't get enough of it) -unfortunately I'm forgetting the name of the dish right now; will definitely find out and add it here when I visit the place next time. Dessert for me was their baked Alaska (a large spoonful of chopped fruits and nuts covered in a dome of meringue that's set on fire when served so make sure you put it out as soon as it is served on the table else like me you'll end up enjoying the fite show and getting portions burnt to bitter black) and chocolate soufflé (was a bit uneven in texture).

Okay so this review is based on my personal experience.
Food is good but for the price you pay the quantity is too less.
Coming to the ambiance it's good too and the behaviour of the staffs is horrendous. It's hard to get a point why they act so superior while greeting their guests. Most of the other staffs are clueless about what is in the menu and they are so rude.
Apart from food, I find nothing good in it and after the incident which took place no more mocambo.

One of the famed legendary restaurants in Kolkata, Mocambo has become a brand in itself for its delectable sizzlers for sure. Firstly, the ambience creates a nostalgic feel good factor. The service is efficient and quick. The food above all is finger licking, especially the devilled crab, angels on horseback, chicken a la kiev and the sizzlers. Overall, a memorable and lovely experience. :)

one of the favourote places to go eat and hang out.. and made better with the favourite bunch of people.. this time for the post diwali lunch.. and a feast ranging over the delectable spread of starters comprising of prawns, fish and mutton.. that too double servings twice over! and followed by steaks of pork, chicken and fish! with the continuous supply of liquid also being ensured! 
yes.. continues being a favourite. period.

"'Mocambo' khush hua". 

To start with my first line speaks it all. Yet, popularity prevails and surpasses all the good reviews given so far. 

This was my first visit with my siblings and cousins. We had met for luncheon and which went for 5 hours. It was a small group of 6 people. A nice cozy place, homely like all other Park Street restaurants. The service was good and well behaved. The place was busy all time. 

The food, it is indescribable. The menu is full of varieties and delicacies. All of the dishes differ in tastes, in looks and in presentation. One can go for family or business purpose. Non-alcoholic wouldn't feel left out, as the menu would successfully suffice your taste. Vegetarians can feel the garden dipped in cheese or sizzling with smoke. So this place should be in the list for foodies.
 
One should be here to taste a piece of heaven.

Excellent food. Great ambiance. Prompt service. Only issue, if it can be called that, is the noise level. But that is the side effect of providing so many nice things at an economic rate.
I liked it even more every time I went there.

This legendary place is my favorite for there delicious sizzlers... visited today after a long time.... my past experience was awesome.... but today I don't have the same experience.... after a wait of 20 to 25 minutes be got our seats.... as they are to busy they not even cleaned the table well... also to handle the pressure they are using short cuts for changing the table cloth only by inverting it... whatever ordered the food... 1. Apple juice... nothing special only cold appi freez.. 2. Screw drive.... excellent... 2. Grilled chicken sizzler.... excellent... 3. Mix grill a la mocambo.... excellent... 4. Bread rolls.... Very bad, served cold with hard butter...5. Fried fish... Very good. 6. Baked Alaska... ok type, nothing special except presentation... yes there preparations of every dishes was very good... deco was pretty good... service was ok... here there standards fallen down remarkably... need to take care about that... mixed experience about the staffs... some are very good and courteous  but some are very unprofessional... also they are watching that how much trips are you paying to them, very irritating.. never the less pocket pinch was on the higher side...

Good place for a quick continental meal. Cocktails were okay. Go for the spinach and cheese pillows for vegetarians. And in non veg the devilled crab was amazing. Try the angel on horse back if you're looking for something in chicken. Prawns, try the mushroom garlic prawns. Overall good service.

"Its not Mogambo khush hua anymore,its mocambo khush kia for me.1 pose out of the book of Kshudhasutra"

Mocambo,was beyond my expectation.Great food and ambiance.
We saw a huge queue in front of PeterCat and decided to walk into Mocambo.
The output turned out to be exciting.We requested the staff to bring us a Kebab first.It was Chicken Firdausi,with less chicken and more stuffing the kebab is not like the usual kebabs.It was more like a dissected hot dog and tasted 20 times better than it.Interestingly the wrap was made of Chicken.Kudos to the staff for suggesting this.Over the Kebab and drinks we decided to have the main course.I and Abhida wanted something with rice base,and our other two partners Satyakida and Goutam ordered beef steak sizzler and ham steak sizzler respectively. Abhida decided to go with Chicken Orientele Mocambo.I was perplexed between Chicken Ala ki ev and Chicken Paprika.Hence I had to call the waiter again.He suggested me to have the later and try the former in our next visit.
To tell you I had had this dish before in some other place but I never remember the name,but accidentally I met my old darling.SautedCarrots,greenpeas,pasta,chicken,little yellow rice,pepper flakesand cheese.This dish had a blend of almost all good taste within it.Sweet,sour and spicy,it was playing with my taste buds.I was hungry and I finished in no time.Just to realize neither I offered a portion to my partners nor I had from them.I have to visit mocambo again and again.Lovely place.Leaving drinks,the bill was around two thousand and two hundred which was purely justified.
Nice place,kudos to Goutam for taking us to this place.

I am ashamed of myself for previously rating this place 5.It used to be one of my favorite joints in the city but I will never go over here again. If they do not treat humans property they do not deserve to be part of the Hospitality Industry. I guess I will have to do without the Chicken Tetrazani, Sizzlers and Baked Alaska which I guess to be in love with.

Its a legendary restaurants which really needs no review at all. Situated at the heart of park street this restaurant is serving excellent foods to all.
The decorations with hanging lamps creats a romantic mood. Coming to food we took chicken lasagne and pork steak and chicken ala kiv and screw driver as hard drinks.
Each and every iteam tastes great.

Its highly recommended to have a visit.

Visited the place for couples of drink. It was the 1st thought that stuck my mind of checking   out different places in Park Street. Park Street area is a rare combination of all varieties of food available in the city. This is the place where I first tasted Cheese Cherry Pinapple and got fond of it. It changed the mind conception of just seeing the restaurant from outside but should even try from insides.

Mocambo was always a synonym for great food and it still stands fir that, but on friday the 13 th nov left the restaurant with a bitter taste Thanx to Mr.Shaun.To all of you patrons the front table near the window are always reserved for the directors which i never knew as they never take prior reservations.Secondly we were asked to wait for 5 min as we were 9persons in total so no issues about that and just after a couple of minutes we were asked to wait for more than an hour though restaurant occupancy was nearly 50% and the tables whch could accomodate us remained empty.When asked for explanation they didnt have any , horrible experience overall probably my last visit Thanx Mr.Shaun

Mocambo is place I loved to run to because of the great food and the delicious Bloody Mary. The different continental dishes had me absolutely stuck here. Then one day I visited that place with a friend and we ordered Baked Alaska for dessert. The dish tasted bitter and horrible. When I complained I was told "Maybe the alcohol is too much in it. Better luck next time ma'am". Bye bye  Mocambo

Go there for a taste of the calcutta of yore. Off park street this Kolkata fixture has been on our list of places to eat for a while, we went in for lunch on a weekday and found the place buzzing. Plush sofas, a deep (slightly old) carpet and I could almost visualise the orchestra and the singers in the corner belting out sinatra and presley hits, sadly the music was missing. 

We ordered a cream of asparagus and mulligatawny soups, both came out hot and tasty - accompanied with fresh warm bread rolls, the soup hit the spot. For the main course we had a fish florentine - which is fillet of fish on spinach and mashed potatoes with a cheese layer baked, a chicken a la mocambo - which turned out to be a chicken curry ( or jhol as we bengalis call it) made with western ingredients and a chicken sizzler.

When the food came out, the portions were generous and the sizzler the cynosure of the next four tables. The chicken pieces in both dishes were large and well cooked, the meat tender and juicy. The fish though was a little bland either the dish was meant to be or perhaps it wasn't marinated.

The desserts were disappointing though, we ordered a chocolate soufflé which turned out to be a very poor mousse in a cup, a creme caramel which tasted eggy. The only decent dessert was vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup- but at 150₹ certainly not value for money.

The total bill at 2400₹ was a tad high for the standard of the restaurant but probably par for park street.

All in all a lower rating for the disappointing dessert but probably a decent choice for "continental" in Kolkata.

Wanted to check out Mocambo after I found how legendary park street is with music and food. I visited Peter cat one week earlier and it was perfect. Though they have the same owner, I liked peter cat more. 
We went to mocambo around 8 on a sunday and swiftly found a table. We ordered Pepper crab as the server told us devilled crab is not that spicy and it justified well for a starter. ratings: 
pepper crab : 4.25 (starter, not very spice, has cheese)
spinach and cheese pillows : 3.7 (a veg starter, a treat for cheese lovers)
angels on horse back : 3.5 (non veg mains)
tandoori roti and panner matar curry : 3.5 i guess. 
total around 1350 for 3 people.

My first experience at Macambo and it was pretty nice.

Its usually crowded and overcrowded on weekends.

So we went on Saturday and had to wait 5 mins for the seat.

We ordered -

• chicken with cheese and mushroom cream - It was amazing. Fried chicken in mushroom and cheesecream was mouth-watering.

• Their prices for hard drinks are really affordable so we had Carlsberg and vodka.

• For desserts we ordered Vanilla ice-cream with hot chocolate sauce - It was good, nothing very nice yet suitable. Served with waffles and hot chocolate cup.

• Baked Alaska - kind of foamy , I personally didn't like it much. Yet nice.

Hope to try their signature dishes soon.

Just a 5 minute walk from the Park Street metro lies the heritage Kolkata restaurant, Mocambo. You step your foot inside and you see a very well decorated restaurant and a sense of peace everywhere. Waiters are very well educated about the menu, they escort you to your seats even pull out the chair for you. We got a table for two and ordered two Foster's Lager beer which were very reasonably priced. Then asked for a recommendation on the sizzler and he suggested the Chicken Steak Sizzler with hot Mushroom sauce, and boy I tell you it was freaking awesome! Everything from the mushrooms to the last bit of chicken and the egg, ate every bit of those.
Then we ordered the signature dish of Mocambo, "Angels on the Horse Back". The Chicken wrapped Bacon was absolute heaven. The bacon was amazingy crisp and tasty. Boiled veggies went perfectly with the Onion and Sausage risotto. Coupled with the beer, you can't ask for anything more on a perfect friday afternoon. These two dishes were soo filling that we were hardly left a place for desserts.
So overall it's an amazing restaurant and it is keeping up with it's name and popularity that dates decades back.

This one is Calcutta's pride when quality of food is considered. 
Mocambo has mastered in continental foods, sizzlers. If you want to rate it, rate it based on these dishes. Because Mughlai items are not their speciality. 
Usually we order (Dad introduced me to this one in early 90s.) Devilled crab, Pork Cutlet, Fish a la Diana and Beckty bell Meunière. 
Believe me they have maintained almost similar (if not better) quality since 1993-94. 
Especially Fish a la Diana and Beckty bell Meunière are out of the world experience. 
It is a problem to find a place here in weekends and Christmas time, and in those times some times you can expect delayed service. 
Ambiance is good. It still has the aura of those bygone days. 
Highly recommended for foodies (non Mughlai lovers)

Hi foodies!

-Intro-
What more can you say about a heritage restaurant at the heart of Kolkata that hasn't already been said? This is just the description of one of the innumerable times I visited here. (October 20th, 2015)

-Decor-
In short, this is a better lighted version of Peter Cat with lesser space. The seating arrangement is a little bit cramped at places so do select a proper place (provided you do get a seat during rush hours). 

-Staff-
Just like Peter Cat, the staff is divided between differently uniformed waiters who clear and clean the tables and the staff who are well versed with the menu and take your order. What I like is that these staff do not hesitate when doing the job of the usual waiters. Also, if you are new here, do mention your preferences and they would recommend the best dish for you.
Note: They informed  

-Food-
My review includes items which are either the house specials or the most loved ones. All pictures are included.

1) We started off with the most famous starter:  Devilled Crab. It shell is filled with crabmeat with a topping of cheese. Yes, it as yum as it sounds. 

2) We moved on to the mains; first the Fish A La Diane. This is a bhetki based fish filled with prawns on a layer of cheesy cream. Fish lover or not, you WILL love this.

3) The second main dish (Chicken Cordon Bleu) was slightly a bit disappointing. This is a deep fried dish so you may find the crust a bit dry. The stuffings (ham and cheese) were decent.

4) Lastly, the dessert included the Baked Alaska. This is a wine based dessert and the presentation is excellent. You can see the rim burn in alcohol when they serve it. Note: You may not like this dessert if you are not used to the taste of wine.

All the above items were sufficient for 3 people and the bill was 1800 (approx).

CONS:
1) The usual con of serving time being lengthy is stretched during rush hours.
2) Also, even though this place is unique for it's continental items, you will notice that most of the items are cheese-based. It is easier to make a dish tasty when there is ample amounts of cheese in it. But it does tend to be overwhelming sometimes. If you do not like cheese, do mention that to your server; there are other great non-cheese items too.

-Endnote-
I do wish to cover the other famous items in my next review. However, Zomato mentions a dish named "Yorkshire Pork Chops" under the "What should you order?" section. This item, though sounds tasty, is unfortunately not present in the current menu. If you love pork, try the Pork Cutlet. It is similar to Chicken Cordon Blue.

Bon Appétit. :)

Disappointed with the very first experience wherein I was stopped at the gate and the gateman was literally barricading me from entering until my family reached me who were just 1 minute away, as they have the policy that until and unless everybody of a group arrives, they are not allowed entry. Next, the moment you seat, the captain was constantly standing beside you, not even giving a minute to decide our menu. Now, regarding the food:
1. Risotto di scampi - it was supposed to be with prawn and crabmeat, but hardly any crabmeat was found. However taste was excellent
2. Mixed meat risotto - again only sausages to be found, but hardly any liver or ham or bacon as mentioned in menu. Tasted good
3. Macaroni cheese casserole - good taste with the right sauces. However, very strange they only serve the food but they do not have any Italian condiments available. A pinch of Chilly flakes was served with much difficulty but no oregano or tobassco.
4. Chicken steak with mushroom sauce - was served absolutely cold. When the waiter was informed, he simply took the plate and served it again as it is with the dish just by heating a little in the microwave. Tasted horrible as there was nothing inside when you cut the chicken breast piece.
However pricing is quite reasonable

So the food here is excellent but I was so so so so SO SHOCKED when I asked for some chilli flakes with my bread despite having placed order for continental starter the manager refused us outrightly saying you will get chilli flakes only with placing continental order so I ordered my mains and then he said that it will only come with your dish not now. I mean how much did he think I will consume with a dinner roll? So I asked him to charge for the spice and still he was hell bent and refused over and over again saying it's our rule that oregano and chilli flakes only is served with the continental/ Italian items. I wondered which cuisine does bread fall under? Isn't it Italian !!?!! I told him it's like refusing salt, I mean it's just chilli flakes! Refusing for chilli flakes - one of the cheapest spice comes as a super duper shock to me.. It's not like I asked for truffle oil! Have never heard of this ever before. So next time guys carry your chilli flakes if you like spice which you can pick for free from dominoes or Pizza Hut before coming here.. Also the spring of the sofa was broken,. Ambience need super maintenance..

Hello.

Kolkata, seriously what is wrong with you???
      MOCAMBO, I know a legend. But not all legends are good. 
Had it been some other restaurants, I would have let it go, may be would have even given a rating of 3/3.5, but this is MOCAMBO we are talking about here. 

The food does not stand out in any which way. One could find the same food elsewhere at a cheaper price even. 
 In a restaurant, it just can't suffice, with some English spoken servers smartly dressed in suits/liverys and pleasing ambience, all of which the restaurant has aplenty. 
But the food was a LOOOOOOOOTT below expectations. 
   Special mention the "fabled baked alaska", HORRIBLE. A very bitter after taste. I know flambe n all, but atleast use some good quality whiskey, you are not giving it for free, we pay for it. 
Beef steak sauce not tasty, moreover steak not cooked to order.
Too much cheese in (never thought would ever have to say this, until i tasted) DEVILLED CRAB, no taste of crab meat just a lingering smell.

Definitely a disappointment.

Chicken pavlograd was amazing and so was their signature dish angels on horseback. Ambience was perfect for a quiet afternoon lunch. Service was impressive too. But I was really disappointed with the dessert we ordered- baked Alaska. The taste was really unpleasant and the texture was foamy. Had ordered it after going through reviews here in zomato but was really disappointed with it.

When it comes to Mocambo, not only is the food legendary, so is the ambience.. Standing strong since ages, Mocambo is a heritage for food lovers. Standing tall in the middle of Park Street, this restaurant offers class apart continental as well as Indian food. We went there last Friday and tasted the Devilled Crab, Meat Lasagne and Prawn Timbuaro. Dessert blew away my mind when we ordered Baked Alaska, and neither the decor nor the taste was something I had tasted before. A place class apart

This place does not deserve anything short of 5.0. The price of a dish here is slightly on the higher side, but it is the best that money can buy in the city of Kolkata. It is a must visit for all the foodies, especially those who love continental or sea food.

However, the service could be better.

This place needs. No introduction and for good reason. One of those old timey classics which wtill retains its charm. From the carpeted interiors to the suited waiters. To the dressed up servers. Who by the way were all polite and attentive inspite of the Sunday afternoon rush. We ordered deviled crab for starters. Which was creamy cheesy and just perfect. Next up in sizzlers was mixed tandoori sizzler which was again brilliantly done. Each and every piece of meat on that mixed platter was juicy flavoursome and to die for. The fish a la diane was again pleasantly unique. With the prawns stuffed in fish. The chicken orientale a la mocambo was juicy chicken chunks cooked in creamy rich sauce with boiled eggs and again perfect
So the low or average rating for this place must have you puzzled. It was cos after the truly amazing meal we were thoroughly led down by the desserts. The famous baked alaska which mocambo is known for was eggy and had a bitter taste in each bite which completely ruined the taste of the previous two courses for us. The meringue with ice cream and chocolate sauce was only marginally saved by the rich chocolate sauce. But the meringue was powdery and resembled one of those 5 rs biscuits you buy at the local chai wala rather then the flaky goodness it is. All that being said. Will definitely come again for another round but will steer clear of the dessert section next time
Round 2 & 3. Love for sizzler continues. Also fish a la moutarde. And chicken cordon bleu. The latter is a must try. Cheesy creamy goodness with crunchy outer coating not to be missed

It is an absolutely amazing place which simply does not need a review. All that you have to be is:
a) be a lover of flesh: ham bacon pork beef chicken crab prawn fish you name it they have it (in various tantalizing forms)
b) absolutely adore continental food
c) have relatively deep pockets
Voila that's all you need to have a mesmerizing experience. Don't waste time reading reviews for this place. Just make a reservation and then dash off to give your taste buds a treat to remember. Bon appetit. For guidance you could try what I ordered the last time I visited the place. Prawn cocktail and deviled crab for starters with bread rolls and garlic toast. This was followed by Angels on horseback for the main course. Chicken supreme is another good option along with pork cutlet and chicken tetrazzini. For drinks try out their cold coffee with ice cream.

I love this place. Its like generations one after the other have always visited this place. The best food item of this place is the crab devils. Its a cheesy crab flesh stuffed inside the shells of the crab. And if u love cheese u are gonna be in heaven after having this dish. I always order the crab devils for my starters whenever i come here. Another favourite oF this place is the fish steak. Its beyond amazing and a must have dish. The keema nun is also good however this time we tried out the sizzler which was a treat to the taste buds. The desert does not have a high variety however the tuty fruity for fruit lovers and the regular brownie with ice cream is quite appropriate! However I trued their special mocambo soufflé this time. The sweet is low but i liked it lot like the mousse with low sweet content! Best place for family dinner outs or just simple dinner dates with your closed one.

Last but not the least....
Mocambo was a dark horse that came up right near the front....
I was super impressed with the energy of this place... Very 'Calcutta' ... amazing character.
A few similarities with Peter Cat... especially with the hanging orange lamps.... that's where it ends... won't be surprised if both are being run by the same family / consortium
The service, esceptionally good 9/10
Chicken Le Cordon Bleu 7/10
Pork Cutlets 8/10
Chicken Mayonnaise 7/10
(could have been better)
Milk shake 7/10
Ambiance 8/10
Value for money , a big question 8/10

Over all a solid 4/5

Highly recommended
Must visit
Great value for money
Good potion sizes.

Recently visited Mocambo after a long time. The quality of the food has not deteriorated which is a big plus because last time I had to complain about a dish. The service has improved but the plates and glasses smell odd. This time I had to ask the waiter to change the glass. Despite taking away the old glass, the waiter forgot to provide me a new glass. This is not expected from a restaurant with such repute.

However, the food helped me to forget the weird incident and the Chicken Tetrazzini and Chicken Pavlograd were delicious. It was so filling that I had to abandon the idea of having Baked Alaska. However, that part was settled with Chocolate Shuffle which was pretty good.

I went to this place during Panchami, Durga puja with friends and had a great evening. We tried Italian dishes and I must say all tasted delicious. The service was very fast in spite of the crowd and staff were polite. Chicken Paprika and Chicken tetrazzini are worth a try. The ambiance was also very peaceful. Cool place to hang out with friends and family.

Visited this place on the Nabami eve.... I had a chicken Sizzler, a prawn Risotto and Mutton Rogan Josh... The food was tasty except the sizzler of course.... And they charged 1150 for such minimum quantity.. Didn't even fill my stomach. Wastage of money.. And Another experience was in the washroom.. There was a crowd building up... I just needed to wash my hands hence I had to stand in the cue and wait and wait for 20 mins!!! A single common washroom in such a restaurant is such a hell.

In 2015 Durga Puja I visited this place for the first time, but since then many times I have been there. 

Let's talk first with the Drinks part:
Though I went for the alcohol section, but as my girl prefer the Cocktails, so with every visit there now have seen their every varieties of Cocktails, but honestly saying nothing exiting they offer at least in the Cocktail section. 

Food:
As of now we have tried many items here. Apart from their Beef parts, I really like their every variations. But my favorite is their Pork Cutlet and Fish Steak. But you can feel free to try anything you want from the menu, I hope you would not be entirely disappointed after seeing that item on your table. Cost wise you would get Cocktails - Starter - Main course within around 1500-1700 for two including all taxes, provided that you're trying their signatute dishes, otherwise the amount would go in lower side than what I mentioned above. 

Note: If you're planning to pay a visit here on the weekends, chances is high that at the peak hours you may have to stand on the queue.

Today I visited the esteemed restaurant around 8 PM. I must tell visiting patrons must have culture to accept the arrogance of order taking staff in this restaurant and also planning to go there customer should carry at least mosquito repellent with them. Today we killed 2 mosquito over there while waiting for the main course and shown to their staffs. They don't have culture as we visited the restaurant with a 1 year old infant and the infant was just sitting on the table their staff started facing problem with it and they asked us to keep the infant be seated on the seat.
We don't understand such high standards of this restaurant n such low maintenance.
It should be only kept for elete class people.
Isn't it.

Somehow have been forced to change my 4.5point review after 9months due to the really disappointing experience of food here. Smelly devilled crabs filled with crab shells, excuse of a prawn cocktail where the tiny prawns were lost in sauce and extremely mediocre mixed meat sizzler where chicken was bland and dry, weird tasting bacon and sausage. I feel very sad when the quality of restaurant i have admired before falls so drastically.

Had a steak , a crab  and a prawn dish  as a starter.
I don't remember the exact exotic continental name but do remember the taste for sure.
Steak sizzlers were pretty good.
So were the starters and the desserts.
Value for money as well.
All in all a satisfying experience.

This has been one of my favourite places in park street area for some years.But after a recent visit I had a very different opinion.

I visited this place some 10/15 times before,ordered different dishes.Loved their devilled crab,ambience & yes the price as well.On shoshthi 3 of us visited this place.We had to wait for 20 mins before given a seat.
When the menu came I was astonished to see the drastic changes in terms of prices & also noticed that the starters have also changed.
We ordered chicken malai kebab & fish kebab as starters.Both were quite pricey but the quantity was inadequate.The fish kebab had only 3 pieces,the pieces were well cooked.But the chicken malai kebab had only 4 pieces & we couldn't find neither the malai nor the tenderness required.
We went for main course-devilled crab,grilled chicken sizzler,chicken chipolata sizzler.Devilled crab was tasty as usual but comprised two small parts & sizzlers were okayish,not something for which we've to visit mocambo.
We also ordered some drinks as well & the bill was 3.5 k 😳
No plan to visit in near future.The place has compromised quality but increased price.

Food was good but very less in quantity (specially if u order any kind of Rice)

Service was too damn bad....staff was almost throwing tissues and crockery on the table. They were in a hurry and not even listening to the order properly. Service was very slow and not that much hygienic.

BAD EXPERIENCE... IT IS RUNNING JUST BY THE NAME, NOTHING ELSE.

Never recommend my friends to visit this place.....

Liked the Fish item in main course. But I really want them to improve their service and ambiance.

The place has an amazing decor and the food is really good. We had sweet lime soda,chicken pavlograd,angels on horseback and baked alaska. The pavlograf was good but what i really liked was the angels on horseback. The risotto was just amazing and the chicken wrapped in bacon tasted heavenly.
The baked akaska was something which I did not like,it had some kind of effervescence and the cake inside tasted bitter.
Apart from that a really good experience.

Best italian and continental dining in kolkata.... variety is abundant . ... Starter , risotto, sizzler was awesome.... sizzler and risotto is a must try here..... in desert I had chocolate souffle which is great..... I gave 5 star for my experience. But, they must have a written plate blog outside the restaurant as I heard recently about a driver is not permitted here due to not wearing the attire rightfully. Anyways, the restaurant have certain rules which must be followed. Trincas and Peter Cat also had the rules. Great restaurant! .5 less given now for not having the board outside.

Visited this place many times when I was in Kolkata!!! Had sizzlers!!! Awesome place but now a days it is very much crowded. Ambience has therefore degraded over years!!! Yet, this is one of my favorite restaurants of Kolkata!! Scenes from movies like Kahaani have been shot here and Mocambo and this place oozes with history. Royal Treatment!!! Place is less about food, and more about history and Royal treatment!!! OfCourse, veg and non veg dishes are equally good here!!!

We went there yesterday for dinner with my boyfriend and his friends. Even though we didn't find much information about the dishes from zomato reviews. But as we all well aware of park Street resurants so thought of trying mocambo again. Especially during durga puja time we all wanted to try some continental dishes in Kolkata that to authentic.
I must say, everyone of us found all the dishes quite awesome.
The dishes we ordered:
Devilled crab
Motton sikh kabab
Chicken A La keiv
Pork chop
Chicken chipolate
Fish A La Diane

And last but not the least is desert.

But one small thing we didn't like, they didn't have the platters yesterday. Not sure if they have excluded the platters for puja time only. But we really wanted to try that. The quantity of deviled crab was really less. You can get more quantity for the same dish in less price @ one step up in the park Street area only.

Anyway the over all experience and the service was really good.

We went with family at about 7:45pm at Saptami. Place was a bit crowded had to wait 45 mins to enter. The ambiance was good and service was very prompt compared to the rush. We ordered chicken munier and prawn with mushrooms and chips for starters......... but it fell short of my expectations. The fried potatoes provided with the dished were  chipped and small compared to the expected french fries. For main course we had angels on horseback, mutton rogan josh and malai kulcha and fish biryani. Fish biryani was very good, angels on horseback was ok though I found the quantity of bean sauce a bit high in all the dishes. However the mutton rogan josh was a complete fiasco. Though the quality of mutton was excellent the cooking was fully let down. I felt like eating a tasteless bit of paper. However the service was very prompt and cordial and behavior and attitude of the staff was most pleasant compared to the rush.

My favourite restaurant of kolkata. Been there many times but never uploaded any photos. Will do so today the 21st Oct 2015, on the occasion of durga puja (astami). Heavenly food both indian and continental. Those red chandeliers are mesmerising as always. Service is always great, never had a problem. Those red sofas add beauty to the ambience. I would recommend it any day of the week. Suitable for family, couples as well as friends.

Oh Mocambo, the sweet mother of steaks.

This is not a place where one visits once, Mocambo draws you into itself, and you find yourself visiting it over and over again.

Simply put, excellent ambience, and those steaks. Just amazing.
Almost always, you will have to wait for your turn, as its a really busy place, but so worth it.

Heartily recommended, will visit again.

Mocambo, to me is that place which would not fail me, EVER.. It is that place, which sets the parameter for judging continental food.. When I am having continental food anywhere, I am usually comparing it in my head to the food served at Mocambo..It is revered to such an extent that, even if I am served better continental food anywhere, it would be equivalent to sacrilege admitting the same.. The sizzlers are royalty, the Ham Steak is heavenly and each and every dish that I don't mention is a champion in its own right.. When it comes to continental, the fact that Mocambo cannot be dethroned, is the best compliment I can reserve for it..ENJOY

One of the many legendary restaurants located at Park Street, Mocambo has an old world charm to it. The lighting and decorations are pretty impressive, along with the food. For starters, Deviled Crab is one of the best starters I have ever gorged on! Fish A la Diane is another speciality, but I would advise against it if you're not much fond of tomatoes/capsicums. Contrary to popular feedbacks, Chicken Ala Keiv didn't quite satisfy my taste buds. I do plan to try out other preparations in the next visits, though!

Situated in the bang opposite of the golden dragon restaurant in park street, if you turn left from flurys. 
There's nothing to say about this joint. The reviews written by other people are self-explanatory. The food is brilliant. I ordered a chicken ala kiev, a tuna dish(don't remember the name) and a shredded chicken. They were fantastic. Tasted even better with the beers. 
Service is excellent. They were pretty fast, considering the quantity of the orders. The price is well, quite well. But hey, you have to give something in order to get something. Phyalo kori, maakho tel, as they say. :P

True continental indulgence.
In sizzler, try Pork sirloin sizzler. Meat was delicate and soft and juicy which really melts in mouth.
End your dining with baked alaska. Taste wise may not be the best, but the presentation always steals the show.
Overall, a must try restaurant for continental food lovers.

When you talk about continental food no other restaurant in Kolkata serves better food than Mocambo. Well chicken ala Kiev and the sizzlers are something I die for at this place.. The ambience has a restro feel which makes you nostalgic and the service personnel are very well groomed and professional. My only advice would be if you do not like continental cuisine then ask the waiter about the preparation of the dish that you want to order because many find continental cuisine bland. 
But apart from that it is a must try restaurant in Kolkata..

I've been going to Mocambo for the past 10 years and they have never failed to delight me. Right from the starters till the desserts, the food was always excellent. Just one small issue. Recently when I went after a gap of almost 6 months, though they have slightly increased the prices, the quantity of food has been cut down. The portions have become a bit smaller. For example:-with reference to my strong memory, prawn cocktail or ham steak used to have much more quantity than what they are serving at present. Quality of food is still first class and will always be but just that they shouldn't reduce the quantity.

One of the many legends of Kolkata and a foodie's heaven it is. 
Mocambo has been on my list for a long time and it happens that the mission has finally been accomplished. A true non-vegetarian restaurant it has a variety of continental stuffs to order and it is this very menu that sets it apart. Let me arrive at each aspect one after the other.
First, the staff. Helpful and caring staffs would instantly make you feel happy right from the moment you step inside.
Second, the decor. A soothing ambiance that warms your heart and prepares you for the food to be served.
Third and finally, the FOOD. Well, the presentation, aroma and taste makes it beyond perfect. We ordered for Chicken Ala Keiv and Angels On Horseback. Such delicious they were.
This place will make you want for more and will make you visit it again(which I surely will do soon).

Its a recist restaurant . Many of the staffs are literally bothered about how u show off.Their gesture and attitudes vary widely depending on the customer's speaking and dressing. Which actually shows how naive they are. Betterto avoid them. Now a days many restaurants make good foods, but behaviour matters. Unless the staffs really behave wisely its point less to rate high just depending on food.

This place and me goes long time back and the history is not very hunky dory. When I was a bachelor, I would never get a place here during weekends, the security would just brush me away. But after I got married, things have changed...now getting a place is breeze when I've got my wife to accompany. Food is fab, service is stingy, old Kolkata charm. They used to have a beer called Dansburg, seems like they've stopped it. Chicken alakiev.. Delicious.

If u are one of those ppl who find cheese the best topping in the world or feel continental the palette that tickles your taste bud this is the place to dive into Mocambo is the place 2 b. While Mr. Kothari's serves delectable food in all his restaurants this one always catches my fancy. With the transcend of time very less has changed in the place. The a la Kievs, the mansions, steaks or the devilled crab we ordered were lip smacking and precise. Only thing that I can complain is that they replaced the mashed potatoes with roasted ones. Bon appetite...

What treat this place is. I definitely make it a point to visit Mocambo every time I go back to Kolkata. The place serves amazing food Garnished with hefty serving of nostalgia. My most preferred place for Continental food.

Food :  
Fish Ala Diana : Bhetky Stuffed with Prawns cooked in cream sauce. If this was a religion, I would have killed for it.
The crispy bacon on tempting chicken cubes in angels of horse back or the overflowing molten butter from Chicken ALA kiev, or the rendezvous with guilty pleasures through their pork cutlet , make every dish in Mocambo a story to remember and spread   -  5

Ambiance : It gives you a quick taste into old school kolkata, with the British culture revolutionizing and blending into the bengali heritage.    -  4

Service: Always qualms what so ever.

Mocambo se hum khush hue!! So we had gone for shilpa's birthday as it was on a Sunday and as usual she was travelling for work to Kolkata, we joined her on Monday and all 5 of us went to this historical joint, where the ambience makes u feel as if you will meet rekha or jaya bhaduri of 1970 any moment. The staff is soft spoken and courteous. We found a table in 5 mins of reaching there and then the party began!! Thomas baba.. The orignal mallu Bengali ordered:
Fish fingers-4/5
Cheese pineapple-4/5
Crab dish cheesy and signature-5/5
Rogan Josh and naan-4/5
Beef steak- now this was sad we told him it should be well done and yet it was pink inside and the one dish that was not upto our expectation went to the birthday girl!!
The other two beef steak were nice and the sauce was also fantastic.
We also ordered a fish which was fried and cams with mushroom sauce was also great!!-4/5
Chicken steak sizzler- sizzle ka awaz aur dhuan kam that..taste wise it was great!!-4.5/5
The ambience 5/5
They didn't have mojito so was sad.
Over all fantastic place and had a gala time as usual!! Loved the place.
I wish that one steak was better.

Had soup which was promptly served, really appreciated at 9 in the night, minestrone was a bit indianised but who is complaining! Then I ordered chef's special fish florentine- now we are talking, subtle flavours- as continental as it could be.

Loved the experience

Fish Belmuniar... I loved it when i went to Mocambo. Had great time. Good ambiance but did not like the treatment of the attendants. I have received far more cordial response from other joints.

Was at Mocambo today and it was pure nostalgia. It took me back to the times I used to go there as a kid with dad and mom. The place remains in that time warp with the waiters still dressed in their white khansama type uniform with their turbans.Loved it. Nothing like old worldcharm. The food too was extraordinarily good.They are known for their continental cuisine and that's what we ordered.The veg.tetrazinni was excellent as was the chicken imperial ordered by my friend.

First off, know that if you are coming to Mocambo, you are coming more for the nostalgia, a legacy, and a feeling of comfort from the food. The decor is circa late 50s early 60s, and has been impeccably maintained, to the point that it is so old-fashioned that it is back in fashion. Did I see Don Draper at the bar? Frank Sinatra seated at that red leather booth? It hearkens back to a time after world war II where 'Cuba' was not just a place, but a productive imaginary for Kolkatans. Knowing this, perhaps you might not be surprised that the "continental" dishes have been as well-preserved as the decor. The meals look like they came right out of an American cookbook from the 1960s, minus the gelatin. The peas and carrots will be artfully arranged, but still be just peas and carrots. The Chicken Tetrazzini will be comforting and full of cream and butter, but not much else. The Angels on Horseback (bacon wrapped chicken over rice) will taste vaguely sweet and sherry-ish, and be delicious, but not surprising or invigorating. If you know what you want and this is it- Mocambo is the perfect place. It's servings are generous, and the quality of the service is impeccable (your water glasses will refill themselves, as the staff will take care of you to the point of seeming invisible). However, at least from the continental dishes, don't expect anything experimental or particularly flavorful, as 'flavor' will come solely from meats, a bit of cheese, cream, salt, butter, and a bit of wine here and there. The meat dishes will be technically cooked well, but nothing veggie will be crisp-tender or raw-ish in any way. It is heavy eating, but was certainly avant-garde at one point- A point about 50 years ago. We didn't sample their Indian fare, so perhaps there is more flavour on that side of the menu.  Their desserts might be a little dramatic in their presentation (baked alaska anyone?!), but weren't particularly good aside from the brownie with fudge- which again, like most of the dishes, felt more 'American' than 'continental'. I would suggest going somewhere else for dessert. Also worthy to note that the souffles are not souffles, but rather mousse desserts, and not dairy fresh cream-based but rather oil-based. This is likely just a terminology relic from the time the menu was first designed (cool whip and jello abounded). The highlight of the menu were the fish dishes, as the flavors, though not striking, were tasty- and let the fish shine for what it was without smothering it to badly. Perfectly textured. All in all, Mocambo might not have the most tasty fare, but I am certain that for generations of Kolkata-ites, it tastes like home- reminding them of the times their families both now and in the past, went there with an occasion to celebrate. Or simply because it was Sunday.

Being a hardcore foodie , just cannot accept the fact that you denied entry to a customer, however he may be. A big thumbs down from my side. You run the eatery with waiters , who doesnt have any talent at all but a driver is much more sensible as a human being coz one mistake can guide him to death along with his passengers. So cheap and filthy from your part. I think time has come for u to bring down ur curtains.

Rating Mocambo is a futile job although. From crabs to prawns to Indian bhetki, fish lovers like me dipping into continental food is a heaven. I am a steak love and no matter how many times I go I will recollect memories there. The little lanterns makes the ambiance so special with the nice behaviour by the staff. Love Mocambo.Love Kolkata for Mocambo.

Went at the peak hour on saturday night knowingly that its gonna a tame eternity to find a way in. The agony of waiting for almost an hour gone with angels on horseback-chicken wrapped in bacons with rice, fish a la diana-succulent fillins of betki n prawn in cheesy gravy served with mashed potatoes n boiled vegetables and chicken stroganoff- eternal classic made to perfection.

This was my second time here. We ordered hot and garlic prawn and another chicken dish for starters. For main course we had chicken supreme, which was chicken balls covered with pasta, and a pasta in white sauce. The food was absolutely yummy. Ambience was appropriate for family casual dining, and I liked the fact that our conversation was not drowned under loud music. Overall, do try it once at least.

Mocambo is one of the best places in town to have continental dishes. With a horde of other continental places in Park Street this place has still not lost its charm. We had ordered a Chicken Ala-Kiev, Chicken Tetrazini and a Mixed Veg Risotto. We were extremely pleased with the food. The price too is very reasonable. 
The tetrazzini is a must try when you visit this place. 
Keep calm and eat continental. :P

I associate Mocambo with childhood memories and a lot of happiness. Thus, it is irrelevant to me if their service dips or quality if food falls: I love Mocambo. Period!

Thankfully, no such things as cited above happens and the restaurant manages to retain its legendary status. They serve great food- even in an age of boutique/  theme restaurants- they hold their own. Yes, for us Kolkatans- who have grown up on Mocambo, Peter Cat and Bar-B-Q, this is still the place to go to when looking for great food. The long queue always found outside is always a constant reminder that they are still a leader in their game.

Now, cut to the food; they serve continental, Italian and Indian. I have never quite tasted their Indian dishes- although it figures in my dad's list of favorites. I love their continental and Italian. The best food, I say. 
Over the years and recently, I have visited this place so many times that I have mostly samples all of their items. It is hard to recommend all. Ask for suggestion, the waiters pay attention to what you need and guide well. 
My personal favorites-
1) Pork Cutlet
2) Chicken Supreme
3) Ham Steak
4) Chicken tentrazini
5) Agel on horseback
6) Fish Florentine
7) Meringue with  vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce

I can go on and on. But let me stop here. There are a lot of others on the menu that are worth a mention here. But I need to draw the line somewhere, so I stop here. Rest, you can go try and find out for yourself.

Totally agree with Arghya Deep that Mocambo does not care what you rate them. They still will have overflowing guests Mocambo has been a favourite for ages. Even at 4 in the afternoon I could not stop myself from ordering a Grilled Chicken sizzler. The service might not be prompt, but I do understand that they will take time to make the nice juicy grills. And I am never in a hurry when I know whats coming. I also love their desserts. The Chicken Ala Kiev was also very good. I have tried their fish , chicken , lamb and quality has been excellent all the time. If your a food lover you cant miss this. The ambience is also nice.

One of the oldest and most revered restaurants of park Street, it does live up to your expectations. It's continental dishes are superb, the Indian dishes are also worth a try. Lots of options available as far as drinks are concerned, not so many in case of food though. Ambience is nice and cozy.. And service is good, though waiting time is a bit too much for the liking..price wise, its a bit costly compared to other park Street restaurants.. But it is worth it.

Tradition is what defines Mocambo. One of the oldest and the best restaurants in the city, Mocambo has a special space in the hearts of the ones who love park street. This is one place which has not faltered with the quality of their service for many years. If you haven't been to Mocambo, do check it out, because with Mocambo, it is not just about the food, it is also about the royal vintage Calcutta treatment.

There are certain joints which just don't care what you rate them. Mocambo is on the top of the list. Variety on the menu,splendid taste, & quite prompt service awaits you as you step into this restaurant recommended by almost every foodie of the city.
The only problem is the wait time regarding the peak hours.
The best time is to go there around 7:00pm (excluding puja days) else you may (rather definitely) have to wait around 30-45 mins.

Bringing down my rating to 1* for their recent discriminating behaviour towards the underprivileged.
& Vowing not to visit again.

A lot of new restaurants that have come up in Kolkata in recent years claim to have the best authentic continental and european cuisine. However none of them is as good as Mocambo when it comes to continental cuisine. Mocambo is an iconic landmark in Park Street with a rich lineage associated with it. To start off your dinner, Garlic Prawn, Italian Herb Prawns, Drunken Prawns are some of the best dishes to go with some cream of chicken / sweet corn chicken soup. Breads which are feshly baked / toasted and served along with a whip of butter can be tried with this. Some of the signatute dishes that I suggest for the main course would be Chicken a la Kiev, Chicken tetrazine (baked chicken pasta preparation), Chicken Pavlord (chicken stuffed with butter, chese and mushrooms), Strognoff and Sizzlers (pick any option, most of them are good). Though I have not had Indian dishes a lot many times, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the Indian cuisine had a pretty good taste as well, especially the mixed indian fried rice to go along with some chicken butter masala / tikka masala. All said and done, the desert still remains. Well, how can u miss the Baked Alaska if you are in Mocambo. Do order for a portion of baked alaska to wind up your dinner.

Anyway apart from memories it has a superamazing ambience & the food uhh..fish florentine is my favourite dish there.
& I also liked chicken ala keiv.
Though there are various places to have continental in kolkata but mocambo stands first for me at least.
One thing that I would suggest the management to serve a better quantity cause ppl like me might be still hungry after one plate of florentine :p

Gorged on the offerings here as part of a birthday treat and I must admit I was absolutely blown away! The food here was incredible and every single dish I had would make any foodie go weak in the knees! The Chicken Florentine was scrumptious as was the spaghetti with meatballs... The meat was tender and had just the right blend of spices and simply melts in your mouth. The Fish Cordon Bleu was outstanding as well. The staff are extremely well mannered and the restaurant is fashioned in a certain Mediterranean style with very comfortable seats and lovely lights. The entire setting is very soothing and sets you in the mood for a romantic date with your palate. Will go back sometime to try the steaks...

The management people were a bit slow with their orders, service and everything, but the food came out real good. Though we expect even better quality from a renowned restaurant like Mocambo! We had the Chicken Fried Rice(not so good), Chicken Paprika(the pasta and the chicken part was real tasty),Chicken stroganoff (very delicious),and Chicken Tetrazinni (the best of the lot)! They can improve their quantity too taking in consideration their price. But it was a grand lunch and i really can't get over their Chicken tetrazinni dish which i aim to have more often in the coming days :P

My saviour  when the tongue  wants to liberally indulge.  My first & last destination for Chicken  Alakiev, deep grilled  bhetki, bhetki  sizzler. The Lobster  Thermidor is pure gourmet  relish, so is the cordon blue. If u want to eat continental  food which not only justifies the taste but also the price this is The Place. It still keeps up the Kolkata Park street heritage. Passionately  recommended.

Mocambo is my all time favorite. I have been dining here since the last 15 years. After Blue Fox (which sadly has closed) this was our continental destination. I would have rated it with a 5 but after my last visit I was utterly disappointed!. 
We had ordered ham steak sizzler, one of our favorites. But we were surprised to find canned ham served as steak sizzler. Upon informing the  manager we got a reply like 'we have been serving this for the last 10 years'!
Canned meat as a steak! Mocambo just lost a very loyal fan!

Visited this restaurant yesterday for dinner. It was quite crowded being a Sunday eve but luckily we need to wait for just 10mins. Wanted to try out different dishes so ordered a mix tandoor sizzler, a chicken paprika, a full stuffed chicken tandoori. The paprika was itself a complete meal and the white sauce based chicken was yummilicious. The sizzler was a mixed bag though but the stuffed tandoori chicken was the winner. It had a chicken liver curry in which the tandoori portions seemed to be sauted, too tasty. The price was reasonable as well.

Dim lights, vintage chairs, aging waiters and seasoned stewards welcome you to this iconic eatery of Kolkata. If you are from Kolkata, you have been here and you know what I perhaps would write. If you are visiting Kolkata make sure this is on your 'to do list'. The chicken ala kiev and deviled crabs are to die for. Cant wait to tuck into my favorites once again ...... sooner than later.

I had tried to have dinner at this iconic place a number of times but the rush is always too much. We finally managed to get in on a weekday somehow.

The Avocado soup was quite a change - we quite enjoyed it with Spinach cheese pillows. You'll enjoy the pillows if you like the smoky flavour. The Veg surprise with rice was pretty nice but the Broccoli corn bake was the high point of the dinner. The garlic bread came in an old avataar which was again gratifying. The sight of the loads of butter oozing out of the Chicken a la kiev which one of us was having almost made me a non-vegetarian - a very tempting traditional dish it was indeed

This is perhaps the only place in Kolkata which serves the Baked Alaska - it was a treat to have it after ages. The decor, staff and cutlery everything about Mocambo takes you to the era when Kolkata was Calcutta

There is nothing left to be said about the food served in Mocambo. Its sheer awesomeness, its pure gastronomic delight. The butter spilling out of Chicken Pavlograd or the cheesy inside of Devilled Crab does make a foodie's heart skip a bit. Mocambo is undoubtedly one of the best places to have continental food in Kolkata.
Or is it? Sadly a restaurant is judged by the service quality too. And Mocambo deserves a big zero in that aspect. The waiters (funnily dressed in colonial outfits) are arrogant, unresponsive and couldn't care less about customer satisfaction. Its really disheartening to receive this kind of service from a restaurant of this stature. I will come back for the devilled crab for sure, but not everyone will.

Off i went to park Street to meet one of my best buddies... we thought to check in at Peter cat but at around 2.30 pm and as usual it was full. So the next stop from my side was Mocambo.
Mocambo is for exquisite continental dishes and so we ordered hamburger steak. The interiors were nicely laid out with beautiful decor. The staffs were cordial and the food was awesome.
Overall a very nice experience and the pocket pinch for 2 hamburger steak including taxes came around 800+

Some places in Park Street are legendary - Mocambo, Flury's, Peter Cat, Trincas, et al. Some have continued to maintain the quality that made these places legendary in the first place and Mocambo is one of them thankfully. I hate the fact that it's so crowded all the time, but that's something one has to put up with if one wants their food. Everyone recommends the crab cocktail, so it definitely is good. I'll also recommend their prawn risotto. Delightful indeed.

Experience at Mocambo is always amazing. Starting with the seating, the ambience, service and obviously the food. The ribs are good. We loved the Chicken Bleu, stuffed with cream and ham. Crab cocktail, that comes in a chilled cocktail glass is amazing too. Only thing I hope they include is the table reservation system. I was shocked to find out, they do not offer table reservation on a Saturday. Since standing in the queue is an inconvenience. Although, we hadn't had to wait this time. Anyway, I'll take back a lot of memories from this time.

If someone wants to try authentic continental dishes and also from one of the well known old restaurants in Kolkata,  Mocambo is definitely one of them . We went for lunch with friends of course and it was a pleasant experience. We ordered Fish Ala Diane, Chicken Ala kieve,  Fish florentine , Chicken paprika,  chicken siciliana,  Meat Lasagne,  along sweet lime soda .The lasagne and the Fish Ala Diane was awesome and I strongly recommend these 2 dishes. Rest were also good . In the desert , we ordered Brownie with vanilla ice cream & chocolate sauce , Chocolate souffle,  Cold Everest,  Baked Alaska. Among these cold everest and brownie were just mouthwatering. The most important thing is it is not very expensive as compared to its quality. For 2 persons around 1200 will be enough .

Enough has been said about this place already.
A friend recommended Mocambo for quick bite. Being a vegetarian, it was a little difficult to decide on something that'd be a treat to my little appétit. All in all, I'd visit again if I can remember what exactly my friend ordered for 😆

The food is simply excellent ! The Devils crabs and boneless Hilsa are must haves. It's not particularly expensive, the ambience is charming and the service is sprightly. 

Overall it's a must visit in Kolkata.

Love the ambience and super love the food . The prawn cocktail , lobster thermidore , devilled crab , chicken ala kiev , not to forget the sizzlers and the risottos !!! Slurppppp!!!!
This place is classic and an one stop go to for delectable Continental food !! With

What more can I say about a restaurant which has held its standards along with a really soothing ambience for decades? Although most people in Kolkata are fully aware of this restaurant's sheer class, for those who don't know, the food quality is top notch and totally finger licking. It's one of the most prestigious restaurant in Kolkata. The price may seem a bit high, but given its heritage and quality it is totally pardonable

What is a good restaurant, if you can't have a good time admiring the surroundings in which you eat. What is a good restaurant, if you can't tell stories about it to your friends and family. What is a good restaurant, if you can't find the absolute joy of discovering that hidden gem in the menu. What is a good restaurant, if you don't have a sense belonging to its heritage and finally What is a good restaurant, if doesn't give you an absolute sense of joy while you enter it's premises each and every time. Mocambo is one such place for me, its just beyond food and certainly beyond comparison with other contemporary places that are sprouting every other day(no disrespect to them). Mocambo gives you an experience which few can provide, it seems like a time machine when you enter its gate and boy doesn't it feel good to be back in time. I have been there numerous times and each time it gave me a memory to savor. So anyone who's looking for a dinning experience which is beyond unique, please try these place and yes for food preferences ask any of the waiters or managers they will be the best to guide you and you certainly won't be disappointed. Cheers to the experience.

Visited this place ,after checking out zomato's reviews and friend's suggestion.coming to ambience, it was nice..best for dinner.here,I am not much sure whether to write about what we ordered ;).Actually I am not crazy cheese or butter lover,but did a mistake while ordering..had order chicken al-Kiev and Fish o Diana.. Both full of butter and cheese respectively.. Was okay.. But no awesome .we are so full with these.that we have not ordered anything more :( .. Will try something less cheesy /buttery next time. Heard sizzlers and rissoto items are good.Coming to price.. Its little expensive.well saving money to visit this place again.Hope we get best taste .. Will write another review once I visit again...till then having guilt of not ordering perfect combinations ... :(
Still pls those who are not cheese or butter lovers..do not order both things at the same time...
Hoping to have good time in next visit...

Finally I visited this place for second time,This time,we ordered carefully ;)
Had fish and chicken sizzlers as starters.It was yummy.Liked the fish one more.
For main course,had risotto .Its a dish made of rice,cheese,chicken/fish/mushroom etc.
Really yummy.So ,now I think I can give some extra marks to mocambo :)

Mocambo seemed to be vintage restaurant which allegedly maintained its food and reputation for more than 50 years. I visit this place on my short trip to Kolkata with three other friends. It made a good first impression with its nice interiors, upper middle class & diverse age group crowd.

We ordered veg penne pasta, veg lasagne and one non veg lasagne along with beer and vodka. Second impression was not that good; they served dishes separately, each with a lag of 10 minutes. This was disappointing as some of us were waiting while others eating. Food was also unable to make an impression. Lasagna tasted good but it was too cheesy which prevailed over other ingredients. Pasta too had excess cheese and both dishes tasted very much alike.

Best part of the hotel was its price followed by ambience. As a resident of Gurgaon, I find this place very cheap considering the location and reputation of the restaurant.

Ambience: 4*
Service: 3.5*

Well well well !!! It seems my forecast (see below) has finally come true in exactly a year's time with the management going overboard with their snobbish attitude this time in denying a fellow human being entry to their "fine dining" restaurant. Seems they were too eager to show that they mean business when they put up a sign "Rights of Admission reserved". But sadly, they couldn't have fathomed that this would not be one of their lucky days when they woke up this particular morning. 

Even worse, the owner, Mr. Kothari, who incidentally owns Peter Cat as well, doesn't seem to think that his staff didn't do anything wrong when he commented that the person was not allowed inside coz he was not dressed properly.

Guess he deserves a boycott of Peter Cat as well.

Sadly, this "legendary" joint of Kolkata has been going downhill over the past couple of months. And that's evident from the fact that nowadays if you are visiting Mocambo at around 10pm, you'll find quite a few vacant tables unlike previously, when you had to wait at least for half an hour to be seated.

The fish fingers are growing smaller by the day and crab meat is missing from the Devilled Crab. The Prawn Thermidore was sad with around 4-5 pieces of prawn in a whole bowl of creamy sauce. The Tandoori Mixed Grilled Sizzler nowadays comes with an unidentifiable piece of mutton as against a proper piece of meat that they used to serve before.

And let's not even discuss about the attitude of the staff ... seems they r doing you a favor by taking your order. PATHETIC ATTITUDE!!!

Their days are numbered if it continues this way - September 9th 2015.

Though we had to wait one long hour, trust me you will forget all that, once u step inside. The ambience is awesome; the waiters are good behaving and the service perfect! Coming to food, the restaurant has a long legacy and it does live up to that, till this day. We ordered Irish Beef Steak, Pork Cutlet and Mixed Risotto. All the dishes were cooked to perfection and tasted heavenly. If you love to eat and is in Kolkata, this place is a must visit and believe me you will not be able to keep yourself from coming back!!

Mocambo is one of those places where you get an authentic experience of what a good sizzler joint is supposed to be. Locatedon park street this gem of a restaurant is a must visit for people from within and outside kolkata. As soon as you enter you'll find sizzlers sizzling everywhere. Don't bother ordering anything else because the sight of those sizzlers is enough to call one of the mamy friendly waiters and say i want that. The food is ansolutely marvelous and the desserts as well. The flaming or sizzling brownie is a must have. Mocambo is also know for its deviled crab. Don't leave without having it.

The ambience was quite pleasant and my personal favourite, dim lights! :D

We ordered Chicken Tetrazzini, Fish A La Diana, Chicken Chipolata Sizzler with Bacon (which is complemented with bread rolls and butter), Surf Turf (Beef Steak), Devilled Crab, Greek Drunken Prawns and Vanilla Ice Cream with Hot Chocolate for dessert.

We ordered the above in two sections. Well, the food took a lot of time to be served (say, about 25 to 30 minutes) but when they did arrive, everything was worth it. The presentation of every dish was a marvelous delight to look at. DELICIOUS, SUMPTUOUS and EVERY dish filled my mouth with a blast of flavours. Chicken Tetrazzini (has become my absolute favourite), Surf Turf (Medium Rare), Chicken Chipolata Sizzler and Devilled Crab are the dishes worth mentioning. You MUST try them or you are going to miss some serious ecstasy.

Except the Greek Drunken Prawn. The coating was rather hard and overall, it had a less than average taste. Also, the staff had to be reminded at least three times to fill our glasses with water which was a bit annoying really. That was the only disappointment about Mocambo, hence the 4.5 rating.

Other than that, I am in love with that place. Absolutely, truly in love.

Recommendation? OF COURSE!

I was at Mocambo recently with Sui Bun on an early Sunday afternoon, during my trip to Kolkata. I have been here before and I am a big fan of their Chicken Ala Keiv. Anyway, this trip was not planned as we were looking for a light snack but ended up have a meal!

The restaurant was almost empty with just one table occupied, which is not the case during prime time. Usually there is a riot getting a place here on the weekends during the peak hours. The restaurant has a royal British era set up with lights hanging just over the table.

I had to order the Chicken Ala Keiv along with which we ordered the Devilled Crab on Sui Bun's recommendation and some Garlic Toast. Even though the we were the second set of guests, our order took about half an hour. But it was worth the wait!

My first shot at their Devilled Crab which was served with slices of Boiled Egg, Lemon and Fried Parsley. Mushy, cheesy, crabby! Squeezing the lemon over it, gave it a wonderful twist.

The Chicken Ala Keiv was served with some Pasta, boiled Carrots and Peas and baked Potatoes. What I love about the Chicken Ala Keiv is the butter that flows out of the Crumb Fried Chicken Shell which forms a pool in the plate and I can soak the chicken in it and enjoy the fried, buttery, crunchy goodness. What was different from the last time was that they had some stuffing along with the butter last time. Although, I would have preferred the old version, the new was pretty insane too.

We were done with the meal and felt like some dessert. We were not sure which dessert to order and based on the waiter's description of the dish, went for the Baked Alaska. It was a cake topped with Vanilla Ice Cream and fresh fruits and finally covered by a flaming layer of Egg White. This is something where we went wrong. Didn't really like the taste of the egg white and everything inside was just ordinary.

Our total check came to INR 1050 which was super duper reasonable. I just wished we wouldn't have ordered dessert and wrapped it under 1k!

On a scale of 5, my ratings are:

A. Food - 4.0
B. Ambiance - 4.0
C. Service - 3.5
D. Wait Time - 3.5
E. Value for Money - 4.5

With an overall rating of 4.0!

I recommend this place to anyone looking for some great Continental food and one can choose their specials without looking at the menu!

I doubt if Mocambo really needs a review. One of those places where I can keep hogging and never get bored.
Decor is similar to Peter Cat, some old oil paintings on the wall giving away the rich heritage of this amazing restaurant.
My favorites :
Chicken Ala kiev - Chicken cutlet infused with tons of butter that bursts out the moment you place your first cut. This is servd with boiled peas and carrots and is very filling.
Chicken Stroganoff - Creamy and cooked to perfection , one of the best Stroganoff in the town
Fish ala diana- Amazing in taste if you love bhetki and prawns.Creamy and a fillet of bhekti filled in with prawns. Very heavy ,and a full meal for one. I am too much in love with this one ! 
Fish steak- Freshest piece of bhekti, well marinated and served on a sizzling plate.
Outstanding is the word.
I like their screwdriver as well, served with tasty munchies
Overall the more you eat here the more you get addicted

If a "fine-dine" restaurant can judge customers based on their clothing and show linguistic racism then i will judge you based on your utterly disgusting thought process and mentality. And thats what makes me give you a 0 rating (1 coz zomato doesn't allow a 0).
I feel ashamed that i visited this place and actually gave good rating in zomato once. Food is not the only parameter to judge a restaurant and u people proved it.

It is turning into a tiny bit of a disappointment lately, this place which I used to frequent ever since I was seven.
I ordered a beef steak and it was very well done, stringy and just not very attractive in general. The chicken which was ordered had a bit of a stale taste to it.
The pork sirloin steak, in fact, was a big transformation from the otherwise mediocre dishes previously ordered. Was pretty good and soft and juicy.
Dessert never fails me, though! I've tried everything multiple times! Always here for the meringue with ice cream. Excellent, indeed.
Ambience is also pretty nice and cozy.

The dining experience at mocambo could range from outstanding to 'very good but not the best' to 'pretty sad' depending upon what dishes one orders.

The dish I would rate as outstanding is the Devilled Crab. I have had it everytime I have visited the place and I highly recommend it.

A notch below the top grade but very, very good items are -

A) Chicken Mornay (I hope that's the name for a cheese based starter because I always ask the waiters for it and have not been able to find it in the menu);

B) Beef Steak (though I wish the pasta would be better. I am not sure if they can cook rare or medium rare because I have always ended up with well done even when I ask for medium rare), and

C) Fish Fillipino which is a wonderful cheesy tangy delight.

D) Prawn cocktail - though slightly tangy, the mayonnaise is very nice and the dish has ample shrimps.

I have found most dishes with white sauce bases decently good ( tetrizzianis, chicken paprika and other fish dishes) along with the fish in mustard sauce. Baked alaska, amongst desserts, is the most popular one, and at least for me it gives a childish bliss on blowing the fire out on the flambes.

Now the dishes to avoid absolutely:

(A) Chicken steak - in pepper or garlic sauce ( which are very sweet). I can be as liberal as I want, but i still cant call it a sauce !

( B) Grilled Chicken with sausage - which had no sauce and was so difficult to even gulp down. The bread rolls are always below par, garlic bread being a slice of normal bread with lots of garlic and salty butter on it.

C) Pastas - all of them. Dry, unseasoned, and about the worst to have.

D) Chiken orientale ala mocambo - a signature dish which is a chicken curry and rice plate, separated by chucks of boiled egg. No idea who conceptualised it and made it into a signature dish.

E) Chocolate Mousse - is very bad and the brownies never made me happy.

Alcohol is very reasonablly priced here. And the ambience is old-schoolish and dark-ish but they have recently done up the olace newly and expanded, and importantly the place comes with very clean washrooms.

The continental cuisine is really good here. The ambience is nice. I liked the peshawari fish kebab, the grilled hilsa and chicken firdausi kebab.
In the grills section, I particularly liked their grilled beckty. 
The hospitality is quite good. 
Only thing they can try to improve is the kind of veggies they give with each dish and the type of bread they provide with continental dishes.

It is a place where you can booze up with no restrictions of smoking and doing other things with your girl friend.. Ambience is A class one ... Just like a foreign restaurant..check in with groupon coupons in winter it will cost 500per couple.. The pitcher and other things will make you feel better.pasta and Italian items along with it just make you a high. It has a smoking place... Go bindaas with ur gf or any close friends.. Enjoy it... With no restrictions

Authentic Continental & Italian Cuisine, located at 5 mins walking distance from Park Street, been there last Sunday. We had chicken paprika, angels on horseback, chicken ala keiv. The food and ambience of this place is beyond the mark. But disappointed about the hospitality of this place, the waiter of this restaurant expects a huge tip, though they did not serve promt and upto our expectations. Oh, we had a peg of vodka also, a very nice place for a romantic dinner, cheers :)

Great ambiance, quality service, nice location & exotic food quality. The continental & Italian dishes are just too good. Fish florentine, Fish A La diane & Pork chops are so mouth watering. Prawn cocktail disheartened me a bit. I still like the Calcutta club one over this. But I must say, if you love continental & italian food, do not miss this one.  I just love this place.

A true Calcutta Classic with its famous Deviled Crab, Chicken Ala keiv and the list goes on..Our personal favorite remains Chateaubriand beef steak (the only place in Kolkata where you get it medium-rare when asked for) and fish mueniere for years now..Meringue has been always the choice desert!!

A Casual Walk in on a fine day. Tables are not easy to find. The place has made a name for itself for the amazing food since decades by the food that they serve even today. The place needs a makeover. But the FOOD IS AWESOME. That is what makes it still running the show in the busiest of the area in Kolkata. 
Love the food and when the food is so deliciously amazing to the mind & stomach, I can't complain much about anything. Love the place.

Coming to the food we had prawn cocktail and devilled crabs as starters...we ordered chicken a la kiev, fish a la diane, chicken chipolata sizzler and chicken tetrazzini in the main course. A la kiev and chipolata were good. Go for tetrazzini only if you are a cheese lover. Fish a la diane is a must try...

Located in the heart of the city this is one of the best place in kolkata to have continental food.Although I am not a big fan of continental dishes but I must say my first visit to this place has made me fall in love with the place.As we reached quite early we had no issiues finding a table.Here I must add its a must to be there early or else u have to wait for as long as 1hr for a table.coming to the food that we ordered both the dishes namely chicken paprika and fish florentine were simply fantastic.both the dishes were non-spicy.I must visit the place soon again to taste its other signature dishes :)

Mocambo will give you the feel of visiting Calcutta as it was, back in the day. Everything about it oozes of nostalgia as one enters the place with the loud and happy crowd, waiters swarming around with orders and the authentic sizzle coming to ones table all the way from the kitchen! Coming to food, ordered the Chicken Chipolata, Crab Soup, Irish Chateaubriand Beef Steak and Chicken Garlic Steak. Food was hands down amazing! Overall, a very happy experience it was. :)

Macambo has been a calcuttan's favorite,always ! The crowd, the class, the service,everything is so Royal. I will not talk about a particular dish here because that would be so unjust. Everything they serve is extraordinarily delicious and you just dont want to stop ordering ! It's a perfect pick for Family Dinners, Business meetings and dates :)

I have been going to this age old restaurant for as long as I have lived in Kolkata and it never disappoints.
The ambience . .the service . .ever the overhead lights are lovely . .
I never miss the chicken pavlograd when I go there . .its better than delicious . .the chicken-butter bomb . .
Another must try is the fish a la diana .
I tried a mustard fish dish last time which was not as good.
The prices are reasonable for the quality of continental food they serve.
Also I think they have the best chocolate brownie,served with vanilla ice cream.
Going again soon to try their devilled crab which has been on my wish list forever.
A must go to place in Park street.

A visit to Cal is simply incomplete without a Mocambo trip. It has become a pilgrimage of sorts for us. This place exudes genuine old worldly charm, not of the artificially attempted variety. The menu is awesome not just in variety but also with the descriptions (not your typical succulent chunks of blah blah in a blah gravy...)

The food is obviously at the core, with classics like the a la Kiev. Very few things in life give more pleasure than puncturing the a la Kiev and seeing the buttery goodness gushing out! Most of the menu items that I've tried over the years here would hit the mark, but I guess it's the overall experience and legacy that keeps bringing me back here!

Mocambo is that one restaurant around which the Bengalis have woven a massive veil of nostalgia. The nostalgia has heightened to such extent that it's almost like no Bengali can call themselves a proper "foodie" without having been at least once to Mocambo.

*Time for some Reality check*
Let's face it. The food is not that good. I mean it's just okayish. Presentation is not mention worthy when compared to relatively newer and less popular restaurants serving the same cuisines (at lower prices of course). The cocktails taste more like virgin fruit juices.

For starters we had the very famous and much recommended Prawn Cocktail and the comparatively less talked about Tandoori chicken. I had loads of expectations from the prawn cocktail. But when the dish arrived I was really taken aback to find that it had nothing but a few prawns in a cup full of mayonnaise with a wee bit flavor of ketchup. So, did I like it? NO!! NO! NO! I mean, if I wanted to have spoonfuls of mayonnaise I could very well get myself a jar from the market and gorged on it. However, the chicken tandoori compensated for the prawn cocktail. The tandoori was amazing. It was perfectly cooked and the chicken was tender.
For the main course we had Chicken chipolata sizzler and Chicken a la Mocambo. The sizzler was good but not great. I've had better at other places. Chicken a la Mocambo was okayish.

Over all verdict- Mocambo ne khush nahi kiya. So 3/5 is just enough.  
Another thing....this one is for the management... Please for God's sake change those glasses you serve water and cocktails in. God!! They look primitive and extremely unpleasant.

This reminds me of when this city was still called Calcutta,it just has that vintage vibe.The decor and feel is certainly colonial.Continental food,good service,great ambiance only drawback being the slightly cramped seating.Over the years the food quality keeps fluctuating.But I always,always have the chicken,chipotle sizzler.Would recommend the baked dishes,beckti sizzler and chicken a la kiev.The desserts are quite unlike any other restaurant.Also they make a really good Bloody Mary,the best I have had apart from the Bengal Club one.This is one of those restaurants that I know I will keep going back to.

This place has acquired a legendary status over the years, and for reasons enough. Went there on a Sunday, naturally had to wait a bit for a table to vacate. Once in, the ambiance is great. We ordered a screw driver and a pint of beer to start with. 
The tough thing here is to decide on what to order looking at the menu if you don't have something in mind already. We went for the Chicken Tetrazzini and the Chicken Paparika. The Tetrazzini was wonderful and cheesy enough to last a whole week, the paprika on the other hand was peppery and with the sides- a good dish over all. 
The service staff are all very friendly. The pocket pinch is a fair amount, but then you should be expecting it coming to a place like this. Would I recommend? Definitely. 
This place gives you the old calcutta feel, the one you see in all those movies. One of the many reasons my girlfriend loved it. :)

I am so embarrassed that I went to this place & it was there in my bucket list.
A "fine dine restaurant" behaving in a such a manner brings only shame & nothing else.
I still don't understand how did u people judged someone by their clothes, I mean how on earth did u??
Bloody Stereotype
Your job is to serve people with food not to judge somebody for their way of dressing.
Just like you people serve us with foods & that is your job, its like that person had a job nobody cares that if he was a driver or a waiter or a doctor 

Stop all these non sense behaviour & you guys should apologise in public for your inhuman act.
Or put a tag like u did before with "fine dine restaurant" that "dress like a rich people, carry an iphone & speak in english else we don't serve food"

Was badly hungry when I decided to pay a visit to have grilled food from here. Read in zomato that this restaurant is specialise in continental. But very disappointed by my visit..and came out without having anything here.
First of all, as I decided before going that I will order only continental, so I ordered Grilled Chicken and fish. 
I was in some doubt while ordering only because the waiter was not enough trained to explain the dish I was ordering. Within no time during the conversation I knew for sure that he knows nothing about the dish. And he confessed that there is nothing like Grilled items in their restaurant, all Grilled items in the menu are all PAN FRIED. So it actually misguiding. There are no grilling machines in their restro. All the grilled items are marinated and pan fried. So stop calling this a continental restaurant. Its actually misguiding. 
But above everything I really appreciate the honesty of the waiter that he revealed the fact. Kudos to his integrity.

If you are in Kolkata for the first time, you will go to Park Street and if you go to Park Street for the first time you will definitely go to Mocambo or Peter Cat for fine dining. Mocambo is a legacy running for more than half a decade. And as we all know Kolkata foodies won’t let an eatery continue for so long if it is not ‘A constant outperformer’ among the peers.   

A nice décor with colourful lampshades hanging from the top will surely grab your attention. On weekends you have to calculate beforehand to not to stand in the long queue.

The liquor is priced a bit high. Coming to the food, I must admit that the service is pretty fast given the exotic quality it has. We ordered Prawn cocktail and Devilled crab. Succulent prawns soaked in cream and mayonnaise will leave you craving for more and more. Now for the crab, I seriously am out of my words to describe it! The tender flesh of the crab and small chunks of mushroom will take you to the ninth cloud. For main course we had a Pork Cutlet and a beef Steak. Mark my word, they serve the premium quality meat only. The steak gets tastier with a unique sauce (mainly with the stock) they provide. How about layers of juicy ham playing with cheese and minced pork??To add cherry on the top, they provide a special tartare sauce having a pungent flavour with the Pork Cutlet.

If you are a voracious eater like me and still hungry, please go for the Baked Alaska to end the course on a sweet and fulfilling note. Will definitely come again and again.

Mocambo is one of the vintage and royal plc to visit in Kolkata.. This was my second visit in order to dine out with my family.. The decor and the ambience was top notch..as we had reached the plc quiet early at around 7 pm we did not have to wait in order to gt a table... Cumng to the food tht we ordered were Prawn cocktail, paneer tikka, devilled crab,fish florentine, and a chicken item cald sumthng lyk chicken milanaise (although i dont remember the name correctly).. And i must say that all the items are equally good.. V hard to decide which was better.. Though i wud blindly go in for the prawn cocktail.. Each tym i go thr and i order thr prawn coctail.. Its tht good!! Coming to the service the stewards were good and polite.. Overall i had a pleasant experience visitng this plc! Highly recommended for all the visitors out thr to try out the vintage restaurant!

In my humble opinion, this is the best standalone restaurant in Kolkata. Located in the busy park Street area, it is a treat for foodies. Starting from the fish and chips and the crab cocktail in starters to the stupendous continental spread, it is a paradise. The chicken ala kiev, chateau briand, risotto, lasagna.. I try something new every time I've been to Mocambo, and they did not disappoint. The orange hanging lamps add to the atmosphere.

I might be a little biased towards Mocambo because of the Lasagne they serve. Well, its not the usual Lasagne with lot of layers made in red sauce. Instead, it made in white sauce, lots of cheese and less layering. When I first saw it, I was like 'WTF!'. But after I tasted it, there has been no stopping me from going to Mocambo just for that Lasagne. 
The ambience is breath-taking! Gives you a legendary feeling. Right spaced tables with comfortable seating and lighting. Lovely place to go out as a couple, friends or family. Service was satisfactory as well. Go Mocambo!

Visited another well known historical eatery - Mocambo, couple of weeks back with my best friend! The decor and ambience was top notch and it wasn't crowded as we went at around 6pm.

I had already planned about what I'm going to have there! So, we ordered one Chicken Tetrazzini & Chicken Oriental A la Mocambo (dish name might not be fully correct but it's the signature dish) & fresh lime soda.

We enjoyed both the dishes but loved the Tetrazzini more because you know (err, cheese)! Just, one complain would be, if Mocambo gave a little more quantity in respect to what they are charging. Would love to go back & try out other dishes.

Pricing is slightly on the higher side as it comes with the 'premium' tag!

Actual rating: 4.4

We were lucky to get table on a drenched evening. The first thing you will notice entering the place is the old world charm and truly a legendary restaurant. We were four of us and we're terribly hungry. We ordered chicken soup - a typical continental soup and good to start with. Then came the main courses - the signature chicken a LA mocambo - a tangy gravy with shredded chicken dish served with rice and boiled egg...  The chicken tasted a lot like sweet and sour chicken with strong flavor of capsicum. The deviled crab was a delight and served with the shell and people need to be little careful with it. It's creamy and yum. The chicken shaslik was served with peas rice and the chicken kebabs were render and tasted delicious. A must try. Also ordered fish steak sizzler...served with white sauce it was the show stealer...its creamy, soft and perfectly made. Also ordered fish biriyani which was served with betki cubes and tasted decent.... A nice foodful Friday evening well spent...priced decently..and they serve alcohol as well....

Went to Mocambo today for lunch. Theres nothing new about the specialities and the menu out here. But the service has gone down considerably and below par. We had to wait for 50 mins approx just for the starters to come. The main course was a further wait of an hour. It was miserable and deplorable.

What can be written about this place that has not already been written. This is a true heritage restaurant of Kolkata. Decor is very much old style and waiters wear uniforms that resemble the British times. Now to come to the food. For starters pork cutlet is just awesome. Devilled crab is a must try. One can also try chicken a la Kiev. For the mains, I loved their fish item items. Fish a la Diana is quite nice. Becty muniere is good too. What I did not quite enjoy was their mixed grill sizzler. It was filled with chicken liver.

Don't follow British bro. You will be searched naked at there airport...... And about customer quality, you are just a roadside food option not Oberoi, Park, or ITC Sonar. Wealth people go there. .....

Well, I dig continental. and Mocambo is just the place to be for the cont yums. And they practically top so far sizzlers are concerned. 
The atmosphere is cozy, and perfect for a weekend get together with friends or partner.

"Mocambo" one if the very famous restaurant in the park Street area...
It was my third visit to this place, tried lot of delicacy on all the occasions and I must say all the dishes are equally good, very difficult to decide which is better, its just what you want to eat, the service staffs are so experienced you just need to describe your mood and what are u craving for, they will suggest the best dish they have.
This time I ordered for pork cutlet which is stuffed with ham and cheese accompanied with boiled vegetables and garlic aioli.
This one was heaven on the planet........
The ambience is very good, the orange coloured hanging lamp,comfortable chairs and couches will make you feel pampered....

First of all let me say I've deducted 0.5 rating because of the bugs hidden in the sofas and whose bites made the swellings almost the same colour as the sofas.

Else the experience was very good.We walked in late and that's probably whey found the place empty by their standards.Found a cozy seating and gave orders.

Now Mocambo truly is a legendary restaurant.In their heyday I've hard them refusing patrons for not being properly attired or properly shaved.Might be an exeggaration but shows the high esteem that people hold them in.Also people who grew up in the 70's and 80's will know that Mocambo always held a more premium space in comparison to Peter Cat or Bar B Q.Their competition was The now defunct Skyroom some distance away.

We ordered Mutton Shammi kebab and Mutton special boti Kabab as starters along with some fresh lime and a Suja satori red wine.The starters were fantastic,especially the Shammi Kabab.Not too oily,not too burnt.....perfect.

We followed it up with the legendary Lobster Thermidor,Beckty Belle Helen and a mixed grille sizzler.The Beckty was extraordinarily fresh and tasty,the lobster thermidor overestimated,cheesy and deceptive and the mixed grill sizzler amazingly filling with a variety of meats like sausages,ham,lever,chicken etc.They served it with bread rolls and food can be termed an uniform 4 on a average.

We did not have desserts and special mention of the kind and friendly service which was at best haughty the last time I went there.Welcome change,keep it up guys,you have a couple of decades ahead to carry this tradition forward.

Another wonder of Park Street...this place is a foodies paradise!! the devilled crab is a must have...most of the continental and italian items are lip-smacking to say the least...have not tried the Indian items in the menu though...the meat lasagne, fish florentine and seafood risotto are my personal favorites...have been disappointed by baked alaska for dessert...but the souffle is good nonetheless!! overall a must-visit for all food-lovers...

Went there last sunday with 2 friends. Had this anxiety which did come true.Despite the restaurant being more than half empty at around 7:15pm, they told us that they can't give us a table as all of it apparently was reserved!!! That too without a single "reserved" plate on the tables. Perhaps they have their own reservations about allowing a guys only group entering their premises but they can always put up a board outside declaring that instead of taking all these silly & humiliating routes. Whatever be the food that they serve but they definitely don't have taste.

Its hard to rate this place low. You simply can't do that injustice. Being at one of the most traditional places in Kolkata and having a wonderful ambience makes you feel good.

Pros:
1. Traditional Restaurant in Kolkata
2. Ambience
3. Friendly Waiters
4. Food can never be termed bad
5. It not too expensive considering this place as one among the best dining places in Kolkata.

Cons:
1. Waiting time: They wont let you get inside until places are empty. (You may get luckier if you move in as a couple)
2. Seating place was too extra comfy (Not proper Dining chairs)
3. Tables should have been a tad bit larger as you can't keep more than 2-3 dishes on one.
4. Serving time (Pretty much at dinner time)

Food I had: It was steaks for which we went this time. Not the best steak I had. But definitely can be rated as 4/5 in steak preparation, serving & keeping the price in view. 

Will visit again.

Situated in park street and visited often by me and my dear friend just to have their beef steak which by the way is soft, juicy and well cooked served with peas and mashed potato. never tried their other dishes but planning to have their sizzlers on my next visit.

The food at mocambo never ever fails to satisfy our taste buds... Probably one of the best continental food in Kolkata is served here

The garlic mushroom prawn just won our hearts with the very first bite...
The devilled crabs could have done with a bit more crab and a little less cream

But then came the eternal wait for the main course... Service was slow and poor
Water wasn't served
Napkins not provided
Even we had to ask for cutlery

But nonetheless the food never disappoints..be it the fish a LA Diana or the prawn cutlets or the pork sir loin..each of them did melt our heart inspite of such poor service!

Buck up mocambo.. Take a wee bit note on the service and care of your customers.. Only then we would be saying
"Mocambo ne khush kiya" ;)

It was raining heavily last night in Park Street, many places we tried was just heavily crowded and it would have taken at least an hour to get a place to sit. However at Mocambo we didn't to wait and got in easily. Been there after a longtime. In terms of food it was as usual good but the service was a bit let down. After giving the order we had to wait long and the associated service was also not upto the mark. Whiskey was served in normal cold drink servicing glass and on asking was told rudely that on Scotch was only served in whiskey glasses. That was just not acceptable keeping in mind all the options we have these days. But still Mocambo gives a feeling that is quite exclusive to them.

I love the food here. The risotto, devilled crab and chicken cordon bleu is especially good. But I feel compelled to write about my lunch experience today. Three of us ordered three dishes. The waiter brought bread rolls and we assumed it came with one of our dishes. We had only half of a roll with some butter Midway through our meal the waiter told us we would have to pay for the bread as he had mixed our order up with another table's. We asked him to take it away. He told us we will be charged for one piece of bread and one portion butter and took away the bread and butter dish! We eventually did not have to pay for it as we conveyed our displeasure. It is obviously not about paying but the whole experience reeked of cheapness. I don't think I want to go back to the restaurant. The good food is not worth the terrible attitude.

A legendary restaurant in kolkata and not visiting would be silly. The restaurant was quite chill & because they r legendary so their staff behaves like a bit of govt. employee :) :)
Foods are really good specially chicken tetrazzini.
Wow was the answer to it simply amazing. And along with a beer had made me enough. if u planning to visit on weekend get ready to face a long queue. because  they did not reserve table unless u don't have good rapport with their staff or manager as I said they are the legend so its quite acceptable.
If u want to.enjoy.take a lot of.cash or else it's not worth it.

Park Street boasts a fair number of wonderful eateries. And Mocambo is up there with the very best this place has to offer.

The ambience is mostly quiet and unassuming even with the place almost full. The service is also top of the line. Unfortunately the air conditioning wasn't at its best when we visited but the food more than made up for it.

Devilled crabs are something everyone must try at least once - we loved it. Other than that, both the continental fare as well as the Indian food is very good.

For lovers of fish, I'd recommend the Fish a la Diana. Prawn stuffing wrapped in Bhetki fillets - what more could you ask for?

For desert, both puddings and souffles are recommended.

It's quite a treat dinning at Mocambo. Rightly listed as a legendary restaurants, it is one of finest in Park Street. The interior décor is elegant with the on-the-table handing lights and the place offers some of the best preparations in town.

Although the rates are towards the higher end but it's absolutely justified after a delicious meal and a great service. It's a must visit destination in town.

Location: A few meters from The Park Hotel.

This outlet was visited on a very special occasion. The ambience of this place is too good. The hanging lanterns and the sitting couches were perfect at its place.

We ordered--
Devilled Crab: Amazing it was!! Starting from its decoration to its taste is must try appetizer for every visitor.
Chicken Orientalle A La Mocambo: Their heritage dish... A thick creamy red sauce over soft boneless shredded chicken pieces was truly delicious.
Fish sizzler: Unfortunately it was a big disappointment. Heard about their speciality on sizzler, so we ordered this. A strong aroma of Calcutta bhetki fish was coming on every bites which was not likeable. A big improvement is needed on this item.

Tucked away in an unassuming corner Mocambo is a Rare gem.From outside it may not look so great but once u enter u r transported to some different world.With hanging dimly lit orange lights,the bar stacked at one corner it is a truly different scene.
The waiters are very friendly and the ambience is great.Coming to foods,among the many foods ordered... Fish Wellington,Chcicken orientale,Meat lassagna,Chicken sicilli stood out.In the deserts Baked Alaska was just heavenly with its flaming appearence.
Just a tip-do make sure to make e reservation before u visit.

Mocambo belongs to the league of legendary eateries tucked away in the heart of Park Street. Coming here has been on the wishlist for a while now. And I'm so glad that I did! Out on a dinner date on a rainy day, my husband & I hopped in here last night. The decor is warm & romantic. Every table has a big, red lamp hanging above & cozy couches to sit in. If you're looking for a perfect place to take your date out, this is it!! The food is superbly delicious. We had ordered for Roast Chicken & Chicken Paprika. The chicken in both the dishes was cooked properly, the veggies on the side were just the right amount steamed/grilled. The sauce in Chicken Paprika is one of the creamiest I've ever had...and too yummy! We also ordered for Cold Everest, a dessert which consisted of sponge cake heaped with vanilla icecream & dry fruits - a welcome change to the usual desserts served at restaurants. A complete value for money, I highly recommend this place to all my fellow foodies in the city.

We ordered Fish Florentine, Chicken Orientale A La Mocambo, Chicken Sizzler and Chicken Biryani as main course. Chicken Biryani was not so good but the rest of the dishes were awesome. Specially Chicken Orientale A La Mocambo satisfied my taste buds very well. In the end we ordered Baked Alaska. Overall it was a nice experience except the waiting part!!

A long over due review of Kolkata's one of best restaurants with continental offering.  Their crab preparation have no parallel and fish florentine and meat lassagne are equally mouth watering. I have been here on two occasions including a 31st December afternoon.  If you are there by 12 or 12:30 chances are that you will make it pretty easily ( I did it on 31st dec) . After 1 o clock the crowd really sets in , and it's really a fun to see the long queue as you enjoy their awesome platters one after tge other. Despite their best in class continental offering a kind of saturation sets in your mouth which was very evident from my second visit.  They put too much cheese into everything and more than the taste of the actual food its all cheese that you get to taste. Nevertheless thier service and ambiance are unparalleled and one should enjoy throughly and experiment with all the varities on offer. Staffs are extremely polite and courteous and the overall experience completely justifies the price they charge.

This one belongs to the 'Legends" category and hence commands for a deliberate review. Nevermind the history and all that jazz about this place- it's alot.

Coming straight to the ambiance- the place adheres to old world charm of dim light dining- with red being the color of the mood. Well placed seating area and exquisite antiquated decor- be it the furniture or the wooden side panels. 
Coming to the food- ordered a beef steak sizzler with pepper sauce, and being a steak aficionado I can assure you it was well done - literally and taste wise. 
So the beef steak is highly recommended. Another dish that we ended up ordering was the mushroom and prawn saute- which again was very nice, rather brilliant I think. The staff were quite friendly and were mostly happy to help except a few of them who were rather busy stalking some guests including me. Everything else was just fine. 
Looking forward to visiting again and will update this post with stuff that I have in the future; and why do I say this? well they have a nice collection of dishes I'm very keen on. Cheers :)

Yes in all these years I had never been here. And I really regret it. A dimly lit place right in the middle of park street , Mocambo offers a wide array of continental and gourmet foods. I went there with two of my friends , and we had the chicken a la Kiev, chicken paprika and the chicken steak , all of which were excellent. They were served with boiled vegetables , roasted potatoes and pasta. As I broke into my chicken Kiev, the butter started oozing out and rapidly pooled all my vegetables and filled the plate. It was amazing , although I expected more herbs inside as stuffing. But then the authenticity of the Kiev would be lost. But anyway , I enjoyed it a lot and so did my friends. In the end we ordered a baked Alaska , which is also very good. Do go there , and do try out the fish florentine.

Wanted to go to this place with a group of my friends for a long time. After a lot of planning, we finally visited this place for dinner last Christmas. We were a group of 5 friends. We had reached at around 7:15 pm & after waiting for about half an hour, we were taken inside & were seated. 

It was my 2nd visit to this place. The ambience of the place is simply great with the red sofas & the hanging lights and the festive joy could be felt all around at this legendary restaurant. We immediately placed our orders as we were hungry & knew that the food will take quite some time to arrive at the table considering the Christmas rush. We ordered five dishes- a Chicken Pavlogard, a Meat Lasagne, a Chicken Chipolata Sizzler, a Chicken Tetrazzini and a Pork Sirloin Steak. 

The food arrived after around 45 mins giving us a lot of time to chat & it also increased our hunger. When the food finally came, we all dove in and had bits and pieces from every dish & had a great laugh about it & also felt nostalgic thinking of the school tiffin times, where everyone's hands used to be found in everyone else's tiffin boxes :)  The Chicken Pavlogard was extremely delicious.. The Chipolata Sizzler was also good, especially the chicken sausages.. The Chicken Tetrazzini was also lipsmacking- soul satisfying comfort food.. The Meat Lasagna was also good but my other friends somehow did not like it that much.. Cannot comment about the pork dish since I didnt taste it, but my other friends said it was tasty as well..

The bill came to around 2300.. We had an excellent time there & it was one of my best Christmas celebrations ever.. :) 

Looking forward to my next visit..

The food was in adequate portions.cocktails bloodymatry and screwdriver was average.in starters mutton kebab and fried prawns were delicious. Their chicken ala kiev and devilled crab were tasteful yet a bit dissapointing owing to some crab shells present with the cooked meat.overall a nice experience and fairly priced considering the ambience and portion sizes.

F off mocambo management. Kolkata doesn't need racist and pretentious people like you serving them. Let's see how long you survive, satisfying your so judged pompous class of fat-cats in the city. #boycott_mocambo

We had visited the restaurant just a few days before it gained instant fame because it was present in a scene in Kahaani. My first visit somewhat this way - We entered the restaurant @ 6 pm and ordered in 15 mins; they forgot our orders once and bungled it up twice more. But meanwhile drinks were a good company. Whenever my friends went out for a smoke, we saw a huge crowd standing, even at 10 pm. We considered ourselves lucky to have got a seat.

The next 2 times I came here, the service was exceptional - they helped us with our luggage, called for the taxi, took time to suggest the best dishes etc. But I realised that the vegetarian fare is pretty limited and the starters and main course may taste the same if you're not careful. Also, we weren't offered the drinks menu which surprised me.

Regarding ambiance, it is one of the best in Kolkata. Gives an old world charm and good place for a date or a party with friends. 

PS - in future, we got the drinks menu.. The staff as usual, was very polite and helpful - that is the reason why I am increasing the rating to 4.5. Have rarely been disappointed with this place (especially if you get to sit) ;)

Enter into the time of the Raj as you enter this place located on one most amazing places in Kolkata for food lovers called Park Street. 
The Deviled Crab served in a crab shell is to Die For. The rest of the continental fare is equally delectable. Warm staff. The only drawback this place has, as is the problem with popular joints is getting a place especially on weekends. 
I would rate it higher than its equally popular counterpart right across the street.

Visited this place today with my friends in the evening. The shop could be easily located. It was around 7:30 PM and so getting a table for 7 of us was not at all a big problem.
We ordered Devilled Crab, Pepper Crab & Chicken Tikka Kabab for starters. The chicken preparation was a bit spicy but the taste was awesome. Crab preparation was as usual superb. In the main course, we had ordered different chicken preparations like Chicken Shashilk, Chicken Supreme, Chicken Paprika, Chicken Mocambo. The taste of Chicken Mocambo was not that good.
Overall it was a good experience. The bill was okay.

One of the all time classic restaurants of Kolkata. Be it the enormously delicious food, or the ambience with it's old world charm - this is one gastronomic experience you do not want to miss!! :)

Regarding the food, where do I even start!! Having been there quite a few times with friends, I've mostly had dishes from the Continental and the Italian sections of the menu. The Chicken Meuniere in the appetizer section is pretty good. I've heard wonderful things about their famous crab dishes. 
The first dish that I had here was the Risotto A La Scampi - the seafood risotto. Being an ardent lover of seafood - this dish was like the ultimate soul food for me. 

The Fish Diana is a heritage dish here - and with Plenty of Good reason! When you take your first bite of that gorgeous prawn wrapped in a Bhetki fillet covered in that beautiful sauce - you're in gastronomic heaven!! ..and you'll want to stay there! 
The Bhetki Meunierre is another great dish - bhelti fillet wrapped in a gorgeous white sauce!

The Prawn Thermidore is paradise for those who love seafood lost in cheesy goodness!

The Chicken Tetrazzini is arguably the Best in town!
There range of sizzlers are pretty extensive .

For lovers of pork and chicken - Angels on Horse Back - a heritage dish - will be Disneyland for them! Chunks of chicken wrapped in bacon on a bed of onion and garlic risotto - this one is for keeps.  

Dishes like Pepper Chicken and Ham Steak are classics and have fans of their own.

The service is brilliant. And the price range is quite rational for a n excellent place like this!

All in all, calling Mocambo a jewel in the culinary map of Kolkata will be a gross understatement. It's all that and So much more!!

Despite the dim and slightly weird decor, Mocambo whips up some amazing food. The service is impeccable and delightfully old school and the culinary aesthetics eliminates any shadiness induced by the mildly dinghy feeling.
We had the Devilled Crab, Irish Chateaubriand Sizzler with a glass of Gin Fizz made with Bombay Sapphire and Screwdriver each. The drinks were served first, followed by the Crab and the Sizzler. The creaminess of the Crab and the butter garlic sauce on the Sizzler was nicely rounded up with the dessert- the Mango Alaska. Icecream, Mangoes and cherry cake covered in whipped egg whites and sugar and sprinkled with brandy. Then set on flames for a spectacular gastronomic delight!
All the above are highly recommended!

Located just opposite to the Park street Pizza Hut outlet , this continental hub MOCAMBO has a wonderful ambience & decor . 

To me their menu card seemed very confusing , they wrote short stories for a few dishes , instead of mentioning the ingredients , few had ingredients too . 

We thank the person who took our order  for helping us make choices . 

Now starting with the dishes , 
Murgh Firdosi Kabab : tastes good with pudina chutney 

Portuguese Chicken : soft , crispy , juicy chicken , a must try , really good 

Chicken steak Sizzler : lovely taste with the salad , the chicken was well cooked 

Russian salad : good 

Chicken garlic steak : well , this was something new to me , the garlic touch made the chicken steak better , a must try . 

Chicken biriyani , mutton biriyani : was below average , did not like at all . 

Mango Alaska: ok ... we thought this would we something good , but this was a full flop to me . Brandy & egg white combination did not at all  taste good . 

Caramel custard : good . 

Their service , courtesy was good .

its special. a visit to this vintage restaurant is always special. After all this was the first restaurant my dad had brought me to. This time i was accompanied along with a friend. The aura and decor of this place has been witness to the changing time. You indulge yourself to the grandeur of the place as soon as you place. dim lighting. Yes you can hear the opposite person speak. On weekends it is difficult to get a seat even for two but you see it is worth waiting. We had ordered Chicken de la orientella ,risotto di scampi, chicken tetrazini and baked alaska as sweetdish. Chicken Tetrazini is my favourite recipie at Mocambo. Its both filling  and delicious. Ya surely it contributes a lot to fat. Baked Alaska is special and is more about presentation , but this time around they had spilled a little more vodka. Over all the visit like always was special. You arrive like a commoner and leave like a King from Mocambo. The service is quick and the waiters are very helpful. This time around they even helped me get a cab. Thank You Mocambo.

Came here after a long time. We had to wait outside for 10-15 minutes on a weekday...you can guess the place's popularity! We ordered a Chicken Pavlograd, Risotto Di scampi and Chicken de la Orientelle. The food was sumptous as always. The risotto had the right mix of creamy and crispy and the Pavlograd tasted amazing with its buttery, cheesy stuffing. The service was good and the lighting was intimate and classy...ensured some good pics! =P 
Overall, we had a great lunch here and can't wait to try out all the dishes from the extensive menu!
A must visit for all continental lovers in the city.

A must if you are a meat lover. It is there steaks that will make you fall in love with them. The very eager faces of the staff, willing to serve you, the orange hanging lamps, the very park street style dressing of the place make it unique. The place oozes appetite. The grilled fish, the meat platters are a must try. Situated on the free school street for a precise location but the place transports you to the world of food. So go, eat and rhapsodize!:-D

Almost any place in Park Street (at least the uber famous ones) emanate an old world feeling. And each of these places have some popular dishes. The same goes for Mocambo. Their popular dishes are devilled crab and the baked alaska (dessert). Tried both along with the Chateaubriand Beef Steak.

The overall food here was pretty good but none of them were the best in their category. So yes, overall a cheap place with pretty good choices. Definitely recommended for the cheap prices (by Park Street standards)!

We went there for sunday lunch.But had no problem in getting a table. The ambience held an old world charm with it's comfy chairs,wall portraits and pretty lampshades. The service was excellent,i was advised to go for chicken paprika since i was craving for something a little spicy.It was heavenly.The staff were very friendly and helpful. We had the chicken chipolata,chicken paprika and becty belle ellen(a fish dish) .The food quality and taste were well upto standard. For desert,we had the baked alaska.Personally,i found it a little burnt,and didn't enjoy it much.But we were told.thats how it usually tastes.Overall,it was an enjoyable meal.Jagriti.

The thing I have realised about Kolkata is that you will need to shed your Fancy Hotel search book back in NCR / Mumbai and be open to learn an entirely new culture. 

The Bongs love eating out and that's a given. 

The city loves it's Old World Charm restaurants and that's what makes this city so unique and sets it apart from the other New Money metros and upcoming Millennium cities 

Mocambo is one such destination. 

No fancy bars imported from Ireland. Or deep Oak furniture. 

It's a place straight out of the 80s when we were grappling with Heritage woods and American diners. 

It's a No nonsense restaurant. Comfortable seating though little extra leg room would have helped. 

Beers and family outings dot this joint. The waiters are polite and brisk. Service is fast. Taste is delicious. Prices are a throw back to the early 2000s. 

So go on and enjoy the restaurant. Go early on a Sunday afternoon (by 1 PM) and you lol not have to wait in the hot Sun outside for a table for 2. 

Cheers@

Wish there was a rating higher than 5.0. This place surely deserves it. It is a Continental food-lover's delight. Mocambo has been a big name in the Park Street area although it is situated off Free School Street. 
        Once you enter this place it seems you have been transported somewhere else. The continental food is a delight. Try out the Mixed grill or the Bekti Belle Helen (basically a fillet of betki in sauce with prawns and veggies). If not go for a sizzler which do not disappoint. The prawn cocktail is also a good choice if you want to experiment.

        This place is lip-smacking good!

My Mumbaikaar friend came all the way to  Calcutta and I was determined to bring her to Mocambo for some good old legendary Continental fare.
I have been visiting Mocambo since I was a child and I can vouch for its consistency.
Mocambo is the integral part of Park Street.This place is the reminiscence of the British influence over Bengali cuisine.
Ambience- Since its establishment,this place has never received a new makeover and this adds to the charm of this place.
Service-The service is extremely dependent on the season and the time.You will expect a very prompt service during lunch time but service during dinner can upset you.And if you are visiting this place during Durga Puja or Christmas,you have to overlook the severe problems you may face from the service.Nevertheless,all the F&B staffs are extremely seasoned and has a good knowledge of the food and can surely help you in ordering their House Specials and some Classics.
Food- Devilled Crabs & Surf n Turf Medium Rare is what we ordered for lunch.Both of these are the house specials and you can't simply miss them.The Devilled Crabs were  cheesy-peppery where the crabmeat was cooked out of the shells and then served in the shells.The crab was absolutely fresh and soft.The cheesy white sauce was warm and DELICIOUS.Oh!I can have that for breakfast,lunch and dinner.Lipsmacking amazing!
Next came the Surf n Turf Sizzler.The Surf n Turf is a mixed platter of Marinated Prawns along with a Beef Steak and buttered vegetables as accompaniments.The main aim of the dish is a fusion of seafood and meat.Surf n Turf is my Mocambo regular and not ordering this is against the rule.A juicy,moist Irish Chateaubriand with prawns and veggies.What can be better than this!My friend absolutely loved this and considering the beef ban in Maharashtra,she was extremely delighted to have pure cow beef and no carabeef!
Mocambo serves no nonsense Sizzlers and other Continental fares at an extemely competitive rate. If you are bringing a non-Calcuttan kin,you should bring them here for once.
I am also uploading few photos from my earlier visit at this place.

Mocambo - Arguably the best restaurant in Kolkata if you are looking for delectable continental affair. My all time favourite dishes would have to be chicken supreme, chicken tetrazzini, angels on horseback, spaghetti carbonara, chicken and garlic stake - in that order. Have tried their chicken a la keiv and chicken pavlograd but found them to be too rich and buttery for my taste. As for starters, there is of course the universally loved and raved about devilled crab. (you might want to try the pepper devilled crab if you like it hot.)
Personally I love the ambience of Mocambo, and the staff here is super courteous (something which sadly can't be said about Peter Cat - the other restaurant owned by the same management). If I had to pick a negative, it would be the service, which tends to be on the slower side at times. But honestly the food here is worth the wait!
Three cheers for Mocambo!

Though the service is a bit slow, though they should renovate the decor, and though their must be an arrangement of sitting for people who waits outside for quite a long time, still..Mocambo is the heart and soul of continental and Mediterranean food in Kolkata. Their vintage dishes like Fish a la diana, Chicken chipolata, Chicken Pavlograd, Chicken a la kiev..they taste just like heaven. Bekti Muniere and Angels on horse back are two of my  personal favorite. Other than chipolata, the house sizzler is also very good. I also love the Meat Lasagna. For the desert I love Meringue with ice cream the most. The ambiance is peaceful and nice. I love their menu card with the beautiful descriptions..:)..All in all, this place is very close to my heart. Every time I visit here and pledge to come back soon.

.....Wait a min..... say that name,"Mocambo" to anyone and kolkatans all around the world will refer to it as one of the heritage restaurants of kolkata apart from being arguably the eldest!
As pointed out by many that the Italian influenced reśtora was home to many British people as well as rich bussinessmen at one time.The hanging orange lamps,the cheekily or rather cheesily designed menu is one of the best i've ever seen....the waiting time during weekdays is no different from weekends...well,here's my rating for the following:
1)Ambience(impotant factor)-4/5
2)Decor-3.5/5
3)Service(X-factor)-4/5
4)Food(the most important thing)-4.5/5
Well i hope to enjoy even more when i visit you again just like my previous outings!!

Pretty famous place which is always crowded and one has to wait for some time to get a place to sit.
Moving to food  there each and every food item is unique , worth a try and service is really fast.
Bad part here is the amount you pay (Bit higher side )for there food does not include the cost of  dining in a relaxed environment because anyways its very crowded apart from that the table are very small and the area becomes very congested and noisy.

I have been mocambo a number of times and never had a thing to complain about the food.every time I had a different dish...starting from risotto,angels on horses,sizzlers to deserts. But the ones I liked the most was tettrazini and lasagna.both of the dishes are kind of similar...with stuffed chicken and beacon in molten cheese.honestly o have never been a big fan of sizzlers but the mixed grill sizzler had me thinking otherwise.
And if you want to eat the food that looks as good as it tastes...then go for the pablogard.The only downside of this place is Its washroom..very dirty and poorly maintained
Otherwise it is a great place to have some delicious food once in a while with a slightly bigger pocket pinch.

Now I know why Mocambo is an institution of food in Kolkata. From what I understood the prawn cocktail is a favourite with everyone here. The devil crab is pure sin. As for the 'risotto di scampi' .....it tastes different. Not bad though. And the sizzler is .... The correct word would be....sizzling.

So yesterday i visited mocambo after a very long time and since it was a sunday, had to wait for a while but got a table within half an hour. The service is fast but untidy. My napkin was dirty, i had to ask them to change the glass as well. Coming to the food, for starters i had the famous devilled crab and truly its worth every praise. The cream sweet corn soup was also good. Fish a la diana did not suit my taste buds at all. Plus it could not be finished by one since it was so creamy. Chicken paprika was average . Overall a satisfactory experience.

Recently I came across an article listing the most over-hyped restaurants of India. Well yes, oh! the horror, Mocambo was featured in the list. No, they couldn’t be more wrong. No matter how much the purists condemn Mocambo, it’s going to be one of the best restaurants of Calcutta. I have gone there multiple times and each time the food has been better than the previous time. I had the first Lasagna of my life in Mocambo, when I was just 13 years old. Around that same time I had my first Cannelloni. Well I could safely say that Mocambo paved the road for me to be the foodie I was later to become. And trust me none of the fancy restaurants around Calcutta, Bangalore and the other places that I’ve lived, could match up to the Lasagna at Mocambo. Definitely, there are much better places now, but Mocambo was one of the first restaurants in Calcutta which brought home the European fare for the masses. Mocambo was the place which introduced me to red Wine. A smooth Chianti at that. So good places will definitely come up Calcutta, much better and grander than a Mocambo or a Peter Cat, but nothing can replace these inimitable classics which reflects the true charm that Calcutta is. Attached is a picture of a starter called Devilled crab. Crab baked in cheese and served with egg, which i had around 6 summers ago.

Mocambo is one of my favourite restaurant in Park Street. After every visit I feel so happy and satisfied. They have the best bacon and sausages. Angels on horse back and chicken steak are too good.

Mocambo, apart from being known as the Kahaani waala restaurant, exudes an old world charm which few can. The service is swift, and the food is delectable. Their steaks, Chicken Cordon Bleu and Angels on Horseback are as exotic as they sound. A must visit to complete a Kolkata itinerary.

We all know that Old is Gold. Mocambo is the best example of this. It is a very old place for dining but so much contemporary till date. There is a shade of light and dark in the interior which will give you a cozy comfort. Food is no doubt very tasty. My own favorite is the Risotto. It is all time favorite destination of mine.

Expenditure / VFM : 1200 for 2 people
Service/ Ambience : It is old yet contemporary, plain yet elegant and quiet amidst the uproar of Park Street. This place tells the tale of this city through the ages. This place has truly been the favourite of a few generation of Kolkata dwellers. And needless to mention that its my favourite too. Hence, its all the more difficult to do justice to a review for this place.
In one word, this place is timeless.
What to Order : Beckty Belmuniad, Chicken Paprika, Fish Florentine, Angels on HorseBack, Grill Fish Steak, Chicken Tettrazini, the Risottos and Baked Alaska for desserts
If you love food you would have to love this place. They add their own flavour to every dish which includes the bread rolls and the sautee veggies. My Kolkata visit is incomplete without a visit to this place.
To non-Calcuttans, next time you visit Cal don't forget to check it in your to-do list.

If anyone asks me what my favourite restaurant in Calcutta is, I'd definitely name Mocambo. I've been there countless times, with my family, and with friends too. Almost every dish I've ever tried there is utterly delectable, the service is absolutely top notch and ambiance-wise, it has that quintessential old Calcutta charm. 
My favourite dishes there are: spinach and cheese pillows (as starters) , mushroom crepe, fish a la diane, chicken cordon bleu, fish florentine, pork chops and angels on horseback. Their Continental is the best I've had in a while. The only reason I didn't give 5/5 is because the desserts could be better; the souffle they serve is basically mousse and the baked alaska is so-so. One restaurant every Calcuttan (or non- Calcuttan) should definitely visit is Mocambo!

A great place. Lot of good reviews made me try this place. Didn't get disappointed.
Mix veg rissoto was great
Chicken biriyani was good.
Didn't like cream caramel at all. Service was real slow. 

Edit-  I can't really rate a place with such inconsistencies. We ordered Chicken paprika, Fish A La Diana and a Chicken steak sizzler. The sizzler was so disappointing, first we found a dead fly in it, which was replaced after waiting for about 10 minutes for the manager to attend us(the restaurant was pretty empty around 6PM). Coming to the taste of the chicken, it was just bad, one bite made me reach for the water so that I didn't spit it out. The rest of the items were good yes. But I was so miffed by the sizzler. The manager kept frowning at us for not liking the food, which was again weird. I'm done with this place.

Nice place,good ambience. Not a suggested place for friends hangout,very good for family or couple outing. Very good place for Italian,continental and steaks. And if taken with a small peg of whiskey it becomes tastier. Last but not the least,the location and the restaurant itself gives a colonial hangover. Beautiful place overall.

I have been dining at this restaurant since 2006. I share a homely relationship with the guys working over here. But in recent past, there has been an entry of a few new staffs. These people don't even know the basics of hospitality industry. They behave rudely and shout over you if u r even a minute late after 11pm, if u cannot finish ur food within 12 in the night.

Well what can I say about this place... It's a great restaurant, I went there today with a friend. We had Chicken Tetrazzini, Beckty Belle Helen, Garlic Toast and a pint of Heineken and a peg of 100 Pieper. The food was absolutely awesome, the Chicken Tetrazzini is specially recommended, although some might find the restaurant to be a bit pricey but the quality and service along with the ambiance makes up for it more than enough. Our total bill came around 1600 but we were very happy with the food and the service. Hope to return soon.

Mocambo is considered as one of the legendary restaurants of the park street area. I visited there on a weekday but had to wait a lot so prior reservation is a good option. The variety of food available is also diverse. I liked the veg tetrazini and also the lasagne. The service is also good. The ambience is also great. All in all a must visit place for any person who visits Kolkata.

Mocambo is one of those places which still senses the Old World charm of Park Street..This place help alongwith a select few help us to reminisce the lost Anglo-Indian culture, a bit of a colonial hangover..Right from the decors..the comfy couches,the dim lighting, the attire of the servers to the unique signature dishes served here will surely make you nostalgic..However off late I have been a bit dissappointed with fall in standard of this legendary outlet..The service have particularly annopyed me during last visit..so rude and careless..Also the waiting time will make u move to some other joints unless u r really crazy for their food..Coming to food it is the Sizzlers which defines this place..Their huge array of Colonial,American and Italian cuisine will surely satisfy your craving..Its better to avoid the Indian dishes here..also the prices off late seems a bit too steep for the quality and quantity of food served..Last time after having drinks at Oly Pub we decided to crash on this place..we ordered:
Chicken Chipolata: personal favourite..a mild,subtle flavour..a chicken breast,few sausages and cubes of potato grilled with lots of green peas on a cabbage base..Passionately Recommended..taste the special sauce served with it..
Chicken Cordon Bleu: A modified version of the famous A-La-Kiev..however this should have tasted better..
Chicken Shaslik: One of the my friends wanted to have this..however this tasted pretty mediocre..the chicken was way too stiff..overcooked..also the rice served with it tasted bland..
Mango Baked Alaska: This was easily the best part of the meal..it was not overly sweet,something I like..flavour of mango was dominant,the meringue on top was also delicately prepared..Highly Recommended..
My friend ordered a Crepe which tasted nice as well..Overall our total cheque comes to approx RS.1700/- for 3 of us..Definitely a piece of Kolkata's food heritage,u should visit once if u haven't still but they need to pull up their socks..

The ambience is classy, the food is amazing and on top of that, it is one of the famous restaurants at Park Street, Kolkata.
I won't say that the cost is cheap by any means, but for a restaurant of it's standard, the price is very reasonable. 
High school and college students can easily afford to have a meal and pop a drink at this place.

Mocambo - the name itself has a reputation that will surpass any review. Primely located on Park Street, it's a restaurant that just must not be missed.
The ambience is cosy and the orange lamps cast a warm glow to the interiors. A classic place for a date or an evening out.
Mocambo specializes in steaks, Italian and Continental. The variety and novelty factors really make me love their menu. The rissoto and the chicken wrapped in bacon are must haves. Also, the beef steak, ham steak and the chicken lassange are worth a try. Ham steak is served on sizzling plates with lots of carrots, tomatoes and mashed potato. The menu is varied and comes with a short description of every dish, which basically makes you want to have everything! This is one of the very few restaurants where I've tasted the desserts. The meringue with vanilla ice cream is a recommendation. 
I recently tried the cold chicken salad and loved it. It is delicious; perfect if you want to eat light and healthy. Chicken Milanaise is also a great choice! The portions are more than enough. The soups alt Mocambo are also something one ought to try.

My first visit to Kolkata. My first restaurant in Kolkata. 

And, I must say I am very impressed. The food here is simply delicious. 

We ordered two cocktails. They seemed quite normal. Nothing out of the great. I think a perfect complement to continental food is wine but that was absent. A bit disappointing. 

Iv never had crab the way they make it here. The dish was called Devilled Crab and it was simply mind blowing. I have had crab only twice. Once here and the other in Goan cuisine and this dish made me fall in love with crab. Absolutely loved it. 

We ordered the Angels on Horseback but it tasted alright. Nothing great. 

We also ordered two pastas. One was the Fish Florentine which was simply brilliant. I dont remember the name of the other dish but it was brilliant too just liek the other. Sooo cheesy and soooo yum! 

For deserts we ordered the chocolate souffle. I have no words to describe it. It was pure joy! It tasted brilliant. 

The ambiance is really good. Very classy it looks. The only thing I didn't like about this place was the fact that we had to wait in line to get a table which was fine except for the fact that they practically threw us out of the restaurant while waiting. They don't have a lobby for customers to wait which is kind of disappointing when you have to wait. 

Else, it is a really good place. Would definitely visit again.

It's been long that we tried out Mocambo, almost a year I believe; so this time as we were wandering 'round the area, we did not give a second thought to hop-in. The place is bearing the same charm & aroma of the mouthwatering dishes, the sound of the sizzlers all the way the same; that we had experienced a year back.  It's I believe one of the most legendary and authentic place to have best sizzlers in city.
We tried this time the 'Chicken Siciliano', which was a bit of creamy of mayo and melting cheese topped with egg halves - but of great tastes and then the 'Orginal Chicken Garlic Steak' - the aroma is perfect blend of garlic and the sauce; well-balanced. The last had to be a sizzler and we did not spare. We ordered the signature sizzler 'Chicken Chipolata'. The fuming dish with aroma of the sizzler itself a view. The service was good and very courteous. We really had a great time there.

Mocambo holds a special place in my heart. The combination of Mocambo and Flury's is all I used to look forward to before we visited the city of joy, everytime. The place with it's adequately lit interiors and charming hues brings a wave of nostalgia everytime I visit. The last time I went there, I had ordered a Risotto and a panache. Servings were in generous prolportions, and the panache was a cracker. Do visit, if you're in town.

Mocambo was in my bucket list since the last 5 years I had been visiting Kolkata and the last time when I went around 8 months back... There was a long queue and we were too hungry to wait! However, I was lucky this time. Went with my parents...Ordered the famous "devilled crabmeat" and OMG! It melting-in-you-mouth kind of tasty! Additionally we ordered a fish sizzler which was in white sauce... Exquisitely subtle. No wonder the place gets mentioned in the zomato's "Legendary Section" . I would definitely love to come back for the crab again!

Situated in park street this place with its decor gives you a feeling like the kahani movie when Vidya Balan came to meet Mrs. Agnes Demello. :-) My spl mouth watering dish is meat lasagna, its just heaven with every bite. Orange Souffle in desert I'd a special mention too. In proper lunch time you have to stand in a queue before you taste the yumilicious food... After all patience bore tasty food... :-)

Mocambo has been a standout in the elite park street zone. But the food turned out to be so-so. Service was prompt, good. Decoration on the plate was average, ambience was too mundane to my expectations. The steak which I ordered was too rare and had to go medium. But that can be excluded. Overall the name is the only thing still holding the fort for this heavyweight. As a well wisher I would like to only help by suggesting improvements. Still one of my top ten restaurants in Kolkata.......:-|

This restaurant is awesome. I was happy with most of the dishes that I ordered. First we had the devilled crab as an appetiser, then for the main course we opted for ham and bacon spaghetti and a chicken sizzler dish (whose exact name I cannot remember now). We ended our feast with a delicious chocolate soufflé and not so delicious baked Alaska for dessert. I loved the crab dish a lot. The crab meat was prepared with cheese and I enjoyed every bite of it considering this was the first time I was consuming crab. But my friend was not very impressed and according to her it contained so much of cheese that she couldn't taste the meat at all. So I guess it would be thumbs up for all cheese lovers and thumbs down for people who are not a huge fan of cheese. I would also like to mention that the baked Alaska was pretty bad. The meringue got burnt from the top when they lighted it. I mean you are supposed to torch or bake it just so that the top of the baked Alaska gets some colour and not burn it. So I request the chef who made this to take care of that fact. So the final verdict is the food was excellent if I ignore the desert fiasco and I would definitely visit this restaurant again to try out the other exciting dishes they have to offer.

Tucked away in an unassuming corner of Park Street, Mocambo is one rare gem! Don’t you confuse the name with Mogambo - though you may very well be tempted to say Mocambo (mein aake) bohot khush hua! The restaurant to me truly represents a distinctive British Indian Style. The menu is mostly what every Londoner would crave! Add to it the dim lighting, the uniformed unobstrusive waiters and a view of a rain-drenched Park Street – and I shall not fault you if you wonder whether you have travelled some decades into the past. Park Street has several establishments, all of which have a charm of their own. But on a day when you wish to eat a lot and eat good, choose Mocambo. You wont regret it! The best thing: Almost everything on the menu is consistently good and all of it is always available. I have rarely had a waiter tell me, a dish has not been prepared on a day. Reserve your seat. There are hundreds rushing to the restaurant even if you are not!
Their devilled crabs are something you shouldn't miss, also the prawn cocktails are one of a kind ! Even the Indian section is top notch, can't just pick out one dish and rave about it, everything is perfect! For desserts do try their baked Alaska and I am sure you will keep coming back for more.

Mocambo was on my wishlist for a ,long time  A great place in park street for the food lovers like me. Food is awesome. I tried 
Devil Crabs:two pieces of tender crab flesh prepared with cheese & herbs.. melted in my mouth within a second!...
Chicken Tetrazzini:pasta,chicken & cheese looked delicious, wow, wow & simply wow....
Coming to deserts. Deserts are also delectable.... Baked alaska is presented in a great way. A foamed covered heap of pastry, cream and fresh fruits. i liked the concept a flaming iceberg is coming to you.

Really good experience. I would definitely go back to try other 
dishes!!! :-)

This rating is offered for the INHUMANITY served to the visitors!  
A Strict No No when it comes to recommending & visiting Mocambo !
Being one of the signature restaurants of Calcutta  Mocambo used to serve fantastic continental food . Once they even made a hater of continental food convert into a lover of it & yeah that's me !
But Unfortunately,  the incident of not allowing a person from less privileged part of our society was a sure eye - opener for us , the food lovers. 
Thus this restaurant should be served the way they treat their visitors.
SHAME  on the INHUMANITY served instead  of Good Food & Hospitality !

Club rule applies, stags are not allowed :-P. Seriously if you are riding solo don't consider this place as they are only interested in big fish I.e. families. They ll give you a shit located seat, right from handing over menu to serving it dish will be awfully late as they are busy importing (seating arrangement) for big fish. I'm writing this as I'm waiting for my menu to arrive :( Rest is left to ur imagination n experimentation as I did m love to :)

The below review was before the inhumane behaviour of the Mocambo Authority came to light. I had to change rating from 5 to 1. Highly disappointed with their attitude and behaviour. How can they even dare call themselves "a fine-dine" when they do not have the minimum courtesy of treating their guests. Shame on the authority. As it is I have stopped visiting this place a long time back just because it always so damn crowded that you would have to wait for a minimum of 15 minutes. Also, the tables are so damn close to each other that one doesn't get enough room to even talk privately to his/her companion without letting the person in the other table know what they were talking about. There are many more better eateries in the city that have opened. My suggestion is please visit those and ignore this snobbish place.

What more can I say about this age old legendary restaurant. The sheer variety of continental dishes might keep you guessing for long time. One of the iconic Mocambo dish is their Chicken Ala Kiev. Also don't leave without having the Chocolate Souffle. 
P.S: Do make prior reservation cause this place is ever-crowded.

One of the legendary restaurant eh?
Well to be correct it is, at least in terms of food. Sizzlers and kebabs.. Delicious.
Speaking if ambience, they really need to redo the decor as years or crashing in and parties are evident. Need to change the crockery as well. The staff are well educated and give genuine reviews about what to take and what not to. A little toning down on the beverage prices will also help. Overall it is a A.ok place to b in.

Disappointed.. very much :(( .. Visited this famous restaurant yesterday and unfortunately my experience is not at all good.. Ordered Devils crab which was OK
.then for Chicken Pavlograd ..well it's below average.. And above that ,while ordering that item we particularly said not to mix capsicum in it. But  they did not care to maintain that and even the gentleman who did take the order tried to convince me that it was not capsicum!..nice try but buddy I am not a fool.. Apart from that..fish steak was again just eatable..None of the food item excited me So with this experience I feel that it was my first and last visit to Mocambo..

Mocambo holds a special place in my heart for all the childhood memories. Their soufflés are still to die for! The quality of fish served is consistently superior. don't forget to ask for the day's specials. The warm family atmosphere, reasonably priced alcohol, and delicious food, make me want to go there again and again. :)

I've been hearing so much about this place that I can easily count this as one of the legendary restaurants of Kolkata. Finally, I get to visit Mocambo and it was just about fine.

Ambiance:
The only thing I genuinely liked! Sounds of cutlery filling in, clothed lamps over every table, a bit of greenery up on the sides of the roof. This place screams vintage! Very classy yet casual.

Food:
This is the okay part. The grilled chicken sizzler tastes alright but seems healthy. A huge piece of grilled chicken on a bed of sizzling cabbage leaves with spiced potatoes, carrots, peas, onion and a little salad. A good choice for all the health conscious peeps.

The fish a la moutarde is just about okay. Two pieces of bhetki is served coated with yummy mustard sauce. The sauce was a tad bit overdone and since it has a strong flavor, it was a bit too much! It served along with yellow rice which tastes very plain and some veggies on the side.
The fish biryani is delicious. For someone who like lesser spicy food, this biryani is a win-win. The fish is fresh and tasteful.
Coming to the better part, desserts! The conventional vanilla ice cream with brownie and chocolate sauce is very, very palatable. The fruits with cream too gives a healthy sweetened end to the meal.
Their garlic bread is a farce. Never eating that here again.

Services:
The staff is decent. The service is quick. The prices are a little on the higher side.

All in all, visiting once is enough. I might just come again keeping the ambiance in mind!

Simply Awesome.
They serve the best sizzlers in town and I still crave for them. My birthday, celebrated there, was a memorable day. The service they gave, the decor were too good, not to mention the waiters' uniform.
I loved the sizzler with beef and prawns with a sundae.
If I'm given a chance to go there again, I won't hesitate for once. Prices are high though but the food is worth the price.
Please all try this place once. You will never forget the charm.

After years and years of plans/procrastinations ,with just "drive-thru's " into n out of the The Park, finally Got Down to it- made a plan with the Bong_One himself and post Ola and a few strides we walked in (safe to go around 830ish) The first step in and I was kind of amazed myself - the place was so "family-friendly" and a  Perfect compliment to the status of 'FineDining' - call me crazy but maybe the name sounded too "filmy" and West-ended which left me pleasantly surprised (guilty) Really minute a fact but the seating was so comfortably compatible to the seating of Two's - many Two's...like fitting pieces of leggoS :p 
Drinks - whisky Sour - marvellously tasty the drinks with it's effects playing in ice and smooth -as the conversations and Pune recollections piled up,the orders doubled along too.Dont be misled or put off by the 'Mocktail-like' with A straw presentation- frankly I had kid it off as 'Jaljeera' ; but amazing preparation;Must for all those lovers of this famed drink ;) The complimentary 'Chakna' here -Chainachoor (namkeen to all) 
Good Food - Tuna in dip surrounded by bread squares (buttered & toasted) ;  he was so Right - I Do love and have an unbiased love for Good tuna - shreds working along with the tidbits of capsicum and n exceptionally Firm yet cool sweet tomato serving (I couldn't put my finger on it but my tongue recognised the freshness of a Good tomato !) 
Devilled Crabs- the pictured would compliment my words more : the Only reason I refrain from crabs- too tiresome,too taxing - and then minor amounts of meat in the mouth in the end :( ... But in this case - that's exactly what worked for me - a shelled coven to the buttered creamy cheese dipped succulent crab meat - BEST Scooped with the teaspoons, add the side fried herbed greens Over each spoon to add a something extra to it (not that it Needs any!) 
•Chicken sizzler - A Chicken Breast, 5-6 chicken sausages, boiled veggies With a butters and herb Simple and tasteful and Very Very continental - but maybe not the best follow up to the Feast that we had before (or maybe the best in the overall picture - Some compensations to our gastric overactivities) 
The Manager was overtly careful and caring and seemed all so cautious all the time -but an equally helpful and successful staff. Finally - the bill - some sweet a surprise - Fine Dining comes as so economical does leave you smiling off :) 
Thank you Kolkata; finally!

Boy if you are a foodie and love the old world charm try out this place. Am not particularly fond of kolkata but this place would be solely credited for changing my mind. Well dressed usherers and captains are what meet your eyes as you walk in. 

The place isn't done up in a modern way but has retained its old flavour in as much as the seating arrangements are concerned. Though the tables are a bit clamped up. Enough of the preamble. Now for the kill. If you love sea food simply go for the devilled crab. 

The mere thought of it in my mouth makes it flooded with salivary juices. Done to the right proportion the dish is both a qualitative and quantitative delight. Delhi restaurants should take a tip or two from the management here. 

From memory I recall the Wellington fish in brown sauce is another sin to indulge in. The fact that I am writing this after my single visit two years back signify it's importance. My sister whom I trust a lot on food also informs from her recent visit that their prawn cocktail is also mouth watering. The captains are courteous and note done special requests. A legendary place to visit.. 

UPDATE: years later I revisit this place. This time I order pepper devilled crab which is even better if you like things hot and spicy. The much touted and talked about prawns cocktail and angels in horse tails didn't do much to impress me though it had many takers, probably because I have had better stuff at other places. The beef steak is good though and recommended by me.

UPDATE 2: this time I tried chicken pavlograd which is a juicier version of chicken ala kiev. The entire contents are rolled inside a chicken ball which itself is deep fried with bread crumbs...slurrppyy

There was a time when I used to like this place. This place is perhaps one of the most legendary restaurants of this great city. But arrogance may have brought this place down from its former glory. Or at least I would love to see it go down. One of the most humiliating and unpleasant experience of my life has been in this place. I practically have gone to this place like hundreds of time, but the last experience was particularly very disturbing for me.

Two weeks back on a Saturday I went to this place with two other friends of mine. One was a bit late as it was raining. We entered the place and asked for a table of three. The waiter behaved very harshly and also rudely and said that we cannot have a table of three until the third person arrives. After a lot of tussle with the guy, I asked for the manager and he said which I quote "for you I am the manager". This kind of behavior and attitude was very much unexpected from this place as I have been to this place a many number of times before. The place was also not crowded at all at the time we went, hardly one or two tables had people seated.

After that day, I never stepped back into the place, although it has been only two weeks, and in the meantime I have been to Park Street on many number of occasions. After a few days from that day, I heard from another acquaintance of mine whose wife has faced similar kind of attitude and treatment from that place.

Its a shame actually, I used to like that place. The food was good enough and the ambiance was also classy enough to deem fit as a reasonable restaurant of the classiest part of the town. It has been a real shame and a real disappointment.

One of THE RESTAURANTS of the park street area. I, accompanied by my dad had went in there, famished. My dad ordered Indian; I , wanting to try something different, ordered continental.
The price, as expected was high. The food ,I am sorry to say , was not upto our expectation.
The Indian tandoori roti and chicken chap was OKAY.
The continental , spaghetti with meat balls , brought tears to my eyes. The spaghetti was so bland, I only picked up the meat balls and ate them.
I don't want to give up on this place so I am hoping that it was me who had made the wrong choices.
Whatever you eat, don't eat the spaghetti with meat balls.

If you are feeling nostalgic and you are great admirer of park street and continental quisine ,this is the place to be. Mocambo has been serving Calcuttans the best continental food, polished high quality service and rustic ambience since the late 70's.
        I have visited this restaurant numerous times but my favorite dish here which i order is the Chicken Corden Bleu which is more an art rather than food, loads of cheese rolled between layers of ham and stuffed between chicken fillet and deep fried, i mean how better can it get than this.The beer in this restaurant is served in silver mugs which i find quite fancy.

How does one review one of the restaurants which make up the quintessential appeal of the very city it resides in! Mocambo is best known for its Continental and Italian fare. I have been here countless times and I love their steaks and sizzlers. Among food suggestions, one can try the Surf nd Turf, the Irish Chateaubriand (beef steak), Fish Al a Diana, baked Alaska among other options.

The signature red lanterns, the waiter uniforms and the queue outside the restaurant all add to its old world charm.

Definitely visit if you are in the city!

Mocambo tops my list of the hot restro spots in the city. Infact, Mocambo serves one of the best continental delicacies in town. Meat lasagne deserves a special mention along with the sizzling mixed grill. The dishes of bengal might take you by surprise too. The dimly lit ambience with the giant hanging lights & the retro couches are the true icing on the cake.  Hardly any cons to highlight.

Classy restaurant, lovely ambience and awesome food, makes Mocambo, one of the best restaurants in Park street (in the league of legendary restaurants such as BBQ and Peter Cat). I have been here quite a few times, and my all time favourite dish here is Chelo kabab. Though, 'sizzlers' are served on most tables during lunch hour, as that is sort of a 'signature dish' here.

Mocambo has always been my favorites. The kind of food they serve is what to die for. Even if I have been here numerous number of times but still cant get over their food.

The decor and ambiance gives you a soothing feeling and yes the uniformed butlers around makes this place royal and rich. 

From the Menu my favorites Would be Fish muniere , Devilled Crab , Angel on horses back and the classic sizzlers and steaks too yum. Recently tried new dishes like firangi Kebab and chilli beef both were excellent and quite enjoyed them. I will alwys love to go back and enjoy their food again and again. 






********************************
After the shameful incident took place I dont need to explain why changing my rating. Inhuman and a totally shameless act. No comments at all. 

Brilliant food with great deal of delicacy
.... Ambience is just like any Italian restaurant... Try there devil crab and angel in horses back and steaks for what they are famous for ... Go for it...

Whenever I'm in my hometown, somehow I magically find myself outside this place at least once. Whatever resolution I make to try out new restaurants only, it dissipates at the sight of this familiar joint. I have lost count how many times I have visited this place since my childhood, but it never fails to attract me. I think this introduction totally emphasizes the favoritism I show towards this restaurant, but I believe that if you're in Kolkata and want a taste of the Anglo-British cuisine &  culture that still seeps through the city's veins, you need to dine here at least once.
      Now for the sake of being objective, the ambience is very nice and cosy, but if you're with a big group you may feel a bit cramped for space. The food is always the best thing about this place, but I humbly request please order continental food here and not Indian dishes! (they have an Indian section in menu also). The service is decent enough, though I admit it can be a tad better on rush weekends. Overall, I absolutely recommend this place for it's food and experience. One of my favorites in Kolkata.
Ambience: 3.5/5

Let me start with the negatives:
Mocambo is best avoided on weekends as the normal weekend rush makes for long waiting times, below par service and I have often found that dealing with queues is not the forte of the staff and they at times tend to be impolite, besides waiting by the side of the road for up to an hour is not my idea of a fine dining experience.

Additionally I am not a big fan of the decor can't explain why but just don't like it.

Now to the review:
Crab starter is heavenly and I feel one of their most popular dishes. I have never tried any of their other starters as I feel that the crab is without equal.

For the main course  "Angels on Horseback", "Chicken Steak","Ham Steak" or the "Mixed Grill Sizzler" are usually my favorites although I have been known to go wild and order the "Chicken Tetrazini" or the "Fish" dish once in a while ( talk about living on wild side). PS I am not a big fan of the "Kiev" too much butter for my liking.

For Dessert- Brownie or Baked Alaska, again wish they had Blueberry Cheesecake or Apple Crumble with cream or if nothing then a simple sponge cake with custard. There is nothing like Apple Crumble and cream or sponge cake and custard to end a meal on a sweet note. ( PS it has been a while since I have last been so maybe these items have been introduced, if so GO MOCAMBO if not HINT HINT).

Overall a good place a 4 from me cause of the queue issue and casue I still don't like the decor. PS Apparently they also have an Indian Menu which I once made the mistake of trying (enuff said).

Mocambo was on my wishlist for a,long time.Before leaving Kolkata for one more time...I dcided to strike this name,off my list.

So on a sultry Saturday me and an equally foodie friend land up in Mocambo.I like the cozy seating which was open yet had a touch of privacy.Started of with devilled crab and chicken muniere chilled beer and  cocktails to go with.The fevilled crab has always been d talk of the town and yes its really awesome.

For main course I chose fish steak whereas my friend opted for beef steak vith of which were tender and delicious.

Expenditure level -high
Satisfaction level -super high

Mocambo is truly a legendary restaurant with amazing food and ambience.

Well-decorated; some light music could have bettered the nice ambience; waiters were polite and explains dishes nicely. We ordered Chicken Paprika and Chicken Oriental. Quality and taste was outstanding. I love continental dishes and this resto is a must for all continental food lovers.

Went to Mocambo for the first time after reading a lot about it on Zomato. We got a waiting time of half an hour which was usual. Ambience was good but space is very much cramped.. You and neighbour are practically sharing the table.
But the good part is the food is awesome. I tried their signature Chicken Pavlograd and as expected, a buttery delight oozed out from inside the chicken.. The other dishes we tried were chicken alla florentina (amazing risotto with creamy chicken liver) and an oriential chicken item( forgot the name but it was good too)
Really good experience. I would definitely go back to try other dishes!!

If you are craving for continental food , this is the place to be. This is a heritage place and you will feel the charm of old Calcutta here. The food here is wonderful and delicious. The dishes served by them are amazing. We generally order 4 to 5 dishes here and two of my all time favorites are Devilled Crab and Chicken Cordon Bleu - this is something that never fails to make me happy and has a got a different taste that i have seldom had at other places. The Chateaubriand is good too which we order often. If you like your food really creamy and cheesy then go for Fish Florentine which is good butt too cheesy for my taste. The Chicken Ala Keiv is reallly good and a must try too. The waiters are polite and courteous and overall it is a wonderful place.

Surprisingly this was my first visit to Mocambo..a visit to this place had been there on my wish list for quite some time now and to the Almighty's grace i finally could make it over there on a sultry Monday afternoon :-D

Ambience- Extraordinary with these flourescent lamps hanging over your head.

Service- Okayish.

Now coming to the food- We were already full since we ate few starters at a previous restaurant. So we ordered one Chicken Tettrazini and one of their signature dish: Bhetki bell Muniere.
The tettrazini tasted out of the world with generous portions of chicken, mushrooms and cheese although just looking at the dish will add to your calorie count..too fattening :-o . It cost 329/-
Next was the bhetcki muniere. It came accompanied by a whole lot of boiled veggies and fried potatoes. Tasted fair enough. It cost us 362/-
Total bill came to 816/-

Overall a good experience. Looking forward to coming here again!!! :))))

For the first time,I was quite confused while ordering. The mughlai food was very well cooked. The decor is amazing. I've no complaint regarding the quality and taste of the food.
But now, after knowing how you behave with your customers.... all my fondness is gone! Hope you have a peaceful fine dining, with no indians inside!!

If I had to take someone on a date or take a first timer in Kolkata out for dinner to give him a taste of the erstwhile aura of my city, this would be the place! Being an ardent fan of continental cuisine, I am never tired of the Devilled Crabs, the Fish Muniere or the Chicken Tetrazzini! And if you are a veggie try the Spinach and Cheese pillows to get bowled over! I eat them everytime I'm here and given a chance...I can eat them everyday...and why, the baked Alaska! I love how this place breathes a British Kolkata from the moment you enter. The enormous mounted paintings, the low lighting and those lovely red lamps transports you right back to when Calcutta was riding high in the British domain! Do I need to give more justifications to declare my love for Mocambo?

The food is indeed very good. In fact it serves great food however it could not earn the 2 stars for 2 main reasons. 1) they really need to improve on their presentation of food 2) they need to add new dishes to their menu. I am simply bored of the restaurant now. I loved it so much that I started going there literally every month but now I am sick of it. New dishes,please?

A lot of hype but in reality its not worth it at all.. Went to this restaurant with high hopes, but was utterly disappointed. Food was really not tasty at all, the mutton steak was saltless >_<
Only Foster regular was available- I mean seriously!!! Waste of money.

Excellent recipes. Been there with 2 of my friends and enjoyed the food at it's best. Specially the chicken paprika and grilled chicken was awesome. Chicken Tetrazzini was also very nice but we were in such a stomach full condition we couldn't finish it :-( The brownie added some extra excitement to our lunch. Happy with the service as well...

This place lived upto its reputation. My oh my, what textures in the food.

The ambiance has its pros and cons. The decorations are very soothing to the eye, but to cater to the ever-increasing popularity, they have crammed up the place with tables, that's a turn-off.

The service is good. Due to the fact that they are full almost always, the service takes a slight hit. But still, they keep a happy face and keep everyone happy.

The food is just mouth-watering. The dishes take time to prepare, and are well worth the wait. Had the Chicken Tetrazzini, Chicken Orientale A La Mocambo and the Fish A La Diane, and I would recommend all these dishes to anyone who visits this place. They overdo the white sauce a bit, but that's ok by me.

Ambiance - 4/5
Service - 4.5/5
Food - 5/5

Mocambo is an icon in itself,located at the heart of park street...this place has history and retained its charm over the years with its signature dishes....

We ordered or Fish & Chicken steak along with brownie as a dessert.

Coming to the steaks,...The fish steak was simply delicious. The spices ingrained deep into it and topped up with the sauce which will only add a zing to it. The peas and veggies are an added bonus along with yummy mushrooms and macaroni. The chicken steak was a let down,which was a shock,because its known to dish our one of the best chicken steaks in town. It had brittle bones scattered all over it...literally every alternate bite ended up uncovering one small tine one....Upon complaining to the representative who took our order,we were told that such bones are usual in a steak. We tried to explain,neither did we receive an apology or an explaination for such a slack in service which is very much unlike of this place.

That left a sour taste in the mouth though. Didn't expect such a cold shoulder towards patrons who love this place.

Coming to the desert the brownie was simply delicious as you dig into it you'll relish each and every bite of it....

Pricing wise its justified with the service & quality of the food (I hope this let down we faced was an one-off incident) but if such occur more,then I must say the service is becoming a let down and the brand name will suffer.

Mocambo...the name always reminds me of the dialogue from a bollywood movie "Mogambo Khush Hua"

Just changed my rating cord of your attitude towards common people... You guys really need to evolve from monsters to humans...

Yes literally a nice place if you want to dine out with your family,friends or loved ones.The decor is excellent so as the food.
Try their varieties of sizzlers specially beef steak sizzler.
The service is upto the mark and it is very prompt too.

You need to dine at this place if you stay in kolkata or planning to visit Kolkata

I can't remember exactly how many times I have been there but each time I came out, I felt like it was the first time. Coming to the food, Fish-A-La-Diana is on top of my list. One can try Chicken Pavlograd or A-La-Kiev as well. Opting for Sizzlers can be a good option too as they have a lot of variety in that section. Although I am not a big fan of chocolate, I do like the brownies they serve with hot chocolate sauce.

Exceptional experience! The ambience makes the visitor feel like lunch in a restaurant in colonial 'Calcutta', not modern Kolkata! Now the food, which started with chicken muligatwani soup ( pardon if spelling is incorrect) and garlic bread, along with prawn cocktail. Soup was smooth and tasty, but the prawn cocktail is something extraordinary. It was boiled prawn marinated in a white sauce and the whole mixture was served ice chilled! A big WOW! In the main course there were chicken steak sizzler, chicken a la kiev and Tuna fish. Chicken a la kiev, ah, what a nice dish! The moment you try to cut the conical cutlet, melted butter tsunamies your plate. Now it's your choice to get drown or swim through! Chicken sizzler and fish tuna was also good, but not extraordinary, as per my opinion. At the end of lunch we had baked alaska, a pudding with burning beer inside! Overall very nice experience.

Most of the times this place is full and one has to wait for a table. I decided to hit this place in the afternoon which saved my friend and me the trouble to wait. The ambiance and service is top-notch. We ordered a chicken steak and a pork steak sizzler. Both of them had perfect taste combined with the right level of tenderness. Altogether it was a good experience.

My absolute favourite restaurant in Kolkata. I've been going here since I was a child and it hasn't changed one bit. The food has always been excellent and the prices super affordable as compared to Delhi and it's skyrocketing prices. 

I love the Lobster Thermidor, Devilled Crab, Chicken Firdausi Kebab, ANgels on Horseback and the Chicken A la Kiev. These are my favourites at Mocambo and every time I visit - I order one of these things.

If you're in Kolkata you must, must visit Mocambo even if you have time for just one meal.

Atlast... Atlast I visited this legendary restaurant during Holi. Being a non holiday, we did not need to stand in the queue. As soon as I entered, I was captivated seeing the elegance of the interiors. I did my home work via Zomato and prepared a list of items that I would go for. Accordingly, I ordered Chicken Caprika and Fish Florentine. The taste of Chicken Paprika was simply heavenly. Fish Florentine was though proportionately prepared and was also very delicious but my girl friend do not like fish items much and so I had to eat that whole which made my stomach full because it was too cheesy. Then she ordered Chicken Ala Kiev and that ought me to taste that a bit inspite of being full and it tasted stupendous. Moreover, the service was very good. One Mr. Neel, who was looking after our table, was very helpful, prompt and courteous. We had a great time over there and will visit again soon.

This place requires no introduction. I first visited mocambo when I was too small to give a review :p... So this year on my birthday mocambo became my food destination. We entered the restaurant at 4.30 afternoon when people were actually leaving after having lunch. Yet, I have to admit that their service is very slow. We had to ask for water every time and after 2 to 3 calls, they responded.
Coming to food, I absolutely have no complains, hence a 4.5 rating. We ordered fish steak (sizzler), grilled ham steak with mushroom, risotto with ham, chicken, pork ( below it was described as the mother of all risottos) and chicken Tetrazzini. All the dishes were superbly cooked but, the fish steak deserves a special mention. Loved the ambience and immensely enjoyed the visit.

This was my very first time at the Mocambo. Famous for its continental delights, this place really needs no special introduction at it has rightly been listed as one of the 'legendary' food destinations. I finally got my chance to appease my taste buds with its mouthwatering delicacies on a very special friends visit to Kolkata n ohh myy..Im glad I did so..
We were so hungry we dived straight into the main course without delay :p I ordered one of the signature dishes of this place Chicken Mocambo.Being an avid meat lover..spaghetti with meat balls was my next choice..we also ordered chicken paprita. I was so impressed with this last dish; it was a beautiful platter on my plate ..so visually appealing ..with fried vegetables and pasta. The streded chicken dipped in buttery sauce takes away the trophy.I'm so glad I ordered this one.
Next I come to chicken mocambo; after tasting this great dish, I was full..the quantity of both butter rice and chicken is ample to fill u up. The meat balls in the red juicy speghetti were very soft,tasty and stuffed amply.
The ambience is very classy..just the way I like it, very peaceful and cosy. You can relax and have a really good time. I'm impressed and glad I came here and im looking forward to come n try out the sea food here :)

Considered one of the best legendary restaurants of Kolkata, Mocambo has indeed lived upto its reputation. I had been to Peter Cat earlier and it is difficult to choose between the two. The ambience is good, similar to Peter Cat with the mordern hanging lamps. We had to wait for around 45 minutes and the prices are a bit on the higher. But, considering the quality of food and service, its acceptable. We ordered Chicken Ham with Bacon Risotto (Italian delight) and going by the zomato suggestions, Angels on Horseback and Fish Florentine as well. The Italian cuisines are quite mouthwatering. Overall, 4.0/5.0.

The food here is satisfactory, but overpriced in my opinion. You'd much rather go to Marco Polo on Southern Avenue for similar cuisine at the same rate, but a MUCH better meal.
One thing that really irked me was the fake Tabasco sauce served with the meal.
You see, I am from the only region in the world which manufactures authentic Tabasco sauce, Louisiana. Whenever I see "Capsico" being served at any famous eatery, I think to myself that the management might be using other cheap substitutes for their ingredients.

Other than that, the food is not bad at all. The sizzler is pretty good, and the pasta is alright.
However, like I said; if you're craving continental cuisine, this is not the best place to choose.

Ambience is old i have to agree comparing with all the new restros that are in town now. But the feel is quite homely n classy which makes me wana visit again and again.
I love the way the waiters are dressed up adding to the whole feel of it.
Food..umm.. So far i have tasted almost evrything that was in the menu considering my numerous visits. So by far my favourites are mixed grilled sizzler,yorkshire porkchops, meat lasagne, chicken a la kiev, pavlogard. For desert baked alaska and cream caramel stole the show. The foods i mentioned above are totally worth evry penny. Trust me and go for it ;)

Mocambo- the name itself oozes out a lot of sophistication and elegance. Considered to b one of the top three restaurants of Park Street it has been on my wish list for quite some time now. Been there yesterday for lunch with my special one and enjoyed it thoroughly.

First things first. I have been to Peter Cat and each and every time I have been at park street I have seen a long queue outside it. So I had this idea that Peter Cat was better. N moreover Mocambo being tucked away in a by lane makes all the difference. However having visited both Peter Cat and Mocambo its really hard to choose between them. 

The ambiance is super cool with large painings on the walls and orange lamps hanging over each table making the place cosy and homely.

Basically we did not want to loose our appetite and hence refrained from ordering any starters and went straight to the main course. Ordered one chicken sizzler and and one tandoori grilled sizzler. Presentation I must mention is one of the best in town.
Chicken sizzler was a let down. It did not live up to our expectations at all. Consisted of chicken,aloo and a lot of leafy vegetables and and omelette. Not quite what we expect from a pioneer in sizzlers!!
On the contrary Tandoori grilled sizzler was superb. It consisted of one chicken rib piece. Nice amd meaty.2 boneless pieces of chicken. Juicy and well cooked. One mutton kebab(i m not a very great fan of mutton yet this one I just loved). There were two huge chunks of paneer and a big aloo. Aloo most of the time goes uncooked but this one was boiled to perfection. There was a boiled egg cut into half.Apart from this it contained one chicken liver piece and one mutton liver piece which I did not like. They also do add pork in it but on request of not doing so they readily obeyed. Taste is somewhat which I do not need to mention about. Words like marvellous and fantastic will be understatement for that hell of a dish.Service is prompt. The one thing I would like to add is that waiters should me more polite.

Finally ordered The famous BAKED ALASKA as a dessert. It did not disappoint me at all. On the first look it looked like a pudding sort of a thing. But one spoonful and you will regret of having thought anything about this beauty.
I am definitely going back to Mocambo sooner or later for trying out the other dishes on the menu.

I found nothing unique about this place. Here's food is really average, like the quantity is ain't satisfactory. Though, the Pork cutlet was really good. Then comes ambience, oh well...seriously quite General/Usual/Common kinda, nothing to praise about. And service is okay.
But when it comes to pocket, it definitely gets high, which actually made me feel uncomfortable and unnecessary. I didn't really felt it praise worthy. I wouldn't recommend Mocambo. :(

This Mocambo only cares about "khush karna" by providing 'one of the', if not 'the' best culinary experience in all of Kolkata. When any dish doesn't just taste, but looks perfect everytime, it shows that they really care about their clientele. Every dish is like a signature one here. Do give their Italian stuff a try, and don't forget the sizzlers! Highly recommended place.

The problem with most restaurants serving continental dishes is that they seem to think the excessive use of cheese makes the dish more palatable. Though cheese is an important part of continental cuisine, it is not always a necessity and using liberal amounts does not make it more continental. The food here is good but as aforementioned lacks the understanding of proper continental food.

Yes it's a bit expensive but the kind of quality food they serve the expense part doesn't play that much...
If u want something good u have to pay for it and yes this place is just that only...

I happened to hear a lot about Mocambo before I could finally go there , a few days back .. the restaurant was fairly big with great ambience . Overhead dim lamps give you the sense of old fashion.. quite unlike most others . Service was excellent and waiters were polite . We had ordered mutton peshawari Kebab , Mixed Grill A la Mocambo sizzler and Chicken Al Kiev . The kebabs were soft and succulent . Sizzlers were great though the chicken in the sizzler could have been a bit more juicy . the al kiev was really good and  oh my ! what a feeling it is when the melted butter pours out of the crisp , conical chicken ! pure bliss. Prices are a little on the higher side but I find it worth it . Will love to go back any day!

Well the worst experience for starting the soup was horrible 2. The fish served was too salty and got it replaced twice then also it horrible 3. Dal had no salt and to top it up there was no bread rolls at 10.30pm . 
Food is not too good . It's just park street hype that's y ppl coming here . It has lost its charm.

A good restaurant in Park Street area. Tasted three items there.. Devils crab, chicken sizzler and cold everest. First two were awesome and the third one was average. Must visit for couples.

Been here just once few years back definitely had chicken steak sizzlers, veg begambahar, peas pulao.
Sizzler was good but the veg was extraordinary rich thick gravy with a huge chunk of paneer with stuffing inside just too yummy.

One of the worst continental food I had in a loong time and service equally bad . 
Devilled crab lacks crab meat .. Stuffed with potatoes and cheese.. Very very less crab meat .

Vegetable in the sizzlers were not boiled, chicken had small bones and its not a solud chicken slab ... Its like something minched chicken mixed with put in batter. 

Chicken kiev 's top coating is too hard and the layer of the chicken is  very very thin and again all vegies not boiled properly. 

Russian salad was nice and so the fish dian. 

Had been to loads of restrurent bussy/ expansive/ less expensive than mocambo but never seen a single waiter or stuart not coming into help when a todler is crying while parents heavig dinner..

Extremely Disappointed! I went to this place on 19th Feb with a bunch of colleagues. I was the one to pick this place and even convinced the group that the long waiting time will be totally worth it. Not only they have an extremely laid back and ignorant staff, the food they served totally lacked any flavour. Everything is so full of cheese that it will eventually make you hate the sight of it. Ever heard of Spaghetti with tomato sauce loaded with cheese. Well, there it is. So not worth it. Totally avoid!

We stepped in at this place, and one of the managers said Mam we cant give you a 4 seater,  even though we were 3 people.  Outrageous. He said that since the third member was not there he cant allow us in.  Like seriously. Not coming back again.  
Oh also we were not served water for almost 15 minutes.

Being a slice of the heritage that Kolkata has to offer, Mocambo has always been my one destination in Park Street when I want to try anything other than Indian food. Beautifully decorated with the decor having a certain rustic feel to it, Mocambo has always been an experience for me. The last time I visited, i tried out the Irish steak and the Angels on Horseback. The former was sort of average but the latter was exquisite!! My usual favorites include the Chicken Chipolatta, the Chicken A La Kiev and the Grilled chicken. The service is friendly and the staff, attentive. All in all, my trips to Park Street don't feel complete without a visit to Mocambo.

A very lovely place to dine! The ambiance is excellent. There is usually a crowd waiting to enter but the staff make sure that you are served as early as possible. The menu offers a good number of dishes. Veg dishes are limited though. The service is good too. The place is always full of people. I would go there again more for the ambiance than for the food.

this had been on my wishlist for so long that when i finally went i had quite high expectations. 
well they delivered...
ambience- cozy warm and loved the soft glow of the downlighting 
food- we ordered devilled crab as a starter and it was delicious, served on an open shell the meat was melt in the mouth soft buttery and seasoning was on spot. for main course i had the fish a la diane with bread rolls (they give you an option of sides like rice etc) i loved it. it was basically stuffed fish with prawn and cheese and it was wonderful and really filling. after the starter we had our doubts about the quantity but i could barely finish the main course. enough and more for 2 people.
service- that's the only problem i had. personally i agree that the dishes take time but it was quite a long wait and we were getting impatient.
overall not a bad experience.

After waiting for years to just be to this place, I now feel the wait was worth. I never found a place giving you such privacy despite the seating being so closely placed. Beautifully lit, it feels wonderful to be here -- just for the ambiance. Coming to the reason everyone is here -- it would not disappoint you. Visiting with my friend, we ordered the mushroom garlic prawn which can be counted as a must try. For the main course we tried chicken tetrazzini and sicillene, which were well flavoured and served hot, the creamy taste though became too heavy at the end. We wrapped it up with the chocolate souffle which was just okay, maybe a different choice of dessert would have been better. Would of course visit again.
PS. A more prompt staff would just make the experience flawless.

Mocambo! The name says it all. A legendary food hub located at the Free school street, park street. Honestly what is park street without Mocambo? My eating out journey started with this place so whenever I turn up here, sheer nostalgic memories occupy me completely. ^_^ With the beautiful interiors, the pretty decorum, the orange hanging lights, the mini flower pots on every table and the comfy couches-Mocambo is amazingly beautiful. The attendants and staff is polite and warm in their gesture. I love everything about this place. To start with the food, Devilled crab should always be in the list of your starters. Sizzlers have made Mocambo what it is today. So go for any sizzler like Chicken chipolata or Grilled chicken. I swear by Grilled chicken sizzler everytime I visit the place. Chicken a la keiv is also a beautiful dish. Apart from all this I love their chicken tandoori & biriyanis as well. I am not a huge lover of their desserts to be honest. This is an expensive outlet obviously so whenever I hit this place, i make sure i am with my parents. ;) Do go for this place if you have not gone yet. You'll be delighted. Take my word for it. Hail Mocambo!

Amazing intalian and continental food. Really loved the pewter mugs in which they served ice cold beer. Very cozy and comfy ambiance. I would never forget the two desserts i had- Baked Alaska & Mt. Everest.

Ok... How do I put this is the most complex decent way!! Totally overrated!! I mean if your outta town folk, there's nothing great about this place!! Food quality is ok.. Just ok! Service is slow... Which is pretty fair considering the fact it's always crowed! Not sure why though.. I took my folks for lunch and no one was impressed!! It's good for Indian food, I loved the naan!! That's all!! The soup was served luke warm.. Although covered with fancy relic\antique cover!!! And kinda paid 4 star pricing!! Plus you can't have just one washroom for both males and females.. I means thats sad!!  Well overall I would rate this place " never going again".

Another enigmatic legacy bearer of the great Park Street food scene.

Mocambo has not disappointed me ever , while we gorge on the delicious food for the last 30 years !

Chicken Sicilien with a rich , creamy white sauce , Fish A La Moutard with 2 big bhekti fillet coated with mustard and served with buttered rice , pasta and boiled vegetables and Fish Wellington with a thick cheesy sauce and boiled vegetables on 2 huge bhetki fillets tasted heavenly ! !

Garlic toasts were made to perfection with freshly cut garlic beads on top.

The professionalism and skill of the kitchen coupled with a sensible administration makes this place ticking for so long !

A definite 4.5 on my books !

Well, its not legendary without any reason. Had heard a lot about it, being a Gurgaon person having a million Cal friends! The place was GOOD! 

1) The ambience- is perfect. To chill with friends, with family or even for a romantic time. (The hanging lamps will woo you)

2. The food was awesome. Mutton steak and Chicken chipolata (or whatever it was called, ask them, they'd tell :P) should be tried! A lot of options available. Go experiment!! 

3. Hailing from Gurgaon, I'd say it was better than value for money! 

Khoob bhalo!

One of the most iconic restaurants of Kolkata with a total retro feel: from decor to waiters to brassware to the menucard. Look for the 'heritage items' if you're a non-vegetarian. For herbivores, give the food a miss and go there to slash an item off your Kolkata list.

The starrer was just superb.  Same as baked fish. Baked chicken quantity was not good. The service was hopeless.  Will think twice@ to be there again.  As I was regular there.

Lunch here was sponsored by my old time friend, but, I had a very heavy breakfast, so I had just one item. Veg Risotto...and it was good. Slightly heavy with spices, but very much tasty. The serving staff seem a little overwhelmed by the number of tables they have to wait, but then again, the ambiance kind of makes you forget the time you spend waiting. Good place to take along your loved one for a cosy evening together....Now all I need is to find a better half and go omnomnom right here!

The change in the rating from 3.5 to 1, is being made because you don't know how to treat their customers. Be it a billionaire or a rickshaw puller, you must understand that they are your customers and customer is king.

This is a restaurant that needs to apparent introduction. Anybody familiar with Calcutta's food history/heritage must be familiar with this joint. 

Arguably the most popular continental joint in town, Mocambo is quite famous for its decor - that regularly features in so many movies. The 60-s ambience significantly enhances the food served here. We have discovered so many dishes here ! - the sizzlers, the tetrizzinis, the Yorkshire Pork Chops or the Barbequeues, the pepper steaks - its very difficult to pick any particular dish that could stand out. One can safely certify the entire spread. Among the deserts, my favourite is the Cheery-with-Cream which momentarily takes you to heaven. 

The only flip-side of this joint is the booking/queue. No booking in advance is allowed and usually the queues are pretty huge. One can safely assume a couple of hours of queuing up for your table. I pray they do something about that.

This restaurant was in my wish list for a month.. Finally got a chance to visit and try it's well know sizzler speciality....
The interior was lovely with a similar touch of Peter cat.
Serving time was nominal but quite disappointing when it comes to the taste of sizzler we ordered. Special "sizzler la mocambo" was just a mixture of all the stuff you find in individual non veg sizzler where as veg sizzler was just a big lump of potato surrounded with vegetables with dry gravy and sauce..
We already tried the sizzlers in peter cat and found the sizzlers way better than mocambo.

This is one cult place that will always have my most brilliant and cherished memories ever since I had been to it for the first time with my Nanajee during my childhood days. The ambience is heartwarming and has a simple old world charm that is very very nostalgic. The continental stuff is too good and every dish is a must try. I have been to this place very often and would keep going each time at every phase of my life and each visit has been nearly perfect and the very best experience always. A great place which is a favourite for all of us ...

I have been going to Mocambo forever. As a child with family, during my schooldays with friends from my school Loreto House nearby, in my college years, with my sons now....and we continue to have reunions with friends here. Well I love everything about it. The bright orange hanging lamps, the comfortable sofas, the bar counter in a corner. ...and the food. We went yesterday and tried out the chicken tettrazini and the chicken a la kiev which have remained the same. The bekty st. helen had a mix of prawns and fish and was quite good. But the dish which surpassed everything was the baked alaska...the flame continues to enthrall us. Waiting for the next trip to Mocambo.

Although being a frequent visitor of this comparatively cheap and famous restaurant around Park Street this will be my first review.
This place is awesome for hangout with buddies and a proper lunch/dinner. Nevertheless this place is also very good for fine dining.
I'm always impressed by their sitting arrangement , wonderful ambience and really wonderful staff!!!!
Now coming to the food over there, I ALWAYS prefer the grills and sizzlers over there. All of them are great as I have tried each an every one of them. But I specially like the Chicken Chipolata sizzler and Irish Grilled Tenderloin(along with a Budweiser). As a person not having much of a sweet tooth I haven't tried any sweet dishes but hope to try them out the next time.

Straight into my goodbooks....another beauty was the chicken Firdausi Kebab...a bit on the dry side...bt an enjoyable dish overall.... The irish beef steak was the star main course..medium with garlic butter....washing it down with a bud was truly the stuff dreams are made of....I'd strongly recommended this to my friends...with the warm decor and quirky menu...its sure to be fun revisiting this place again and again.

Mocambo is and has always been one of the best restaurants in the Park Street area. Not only does it provide quality food but also leaves its customers walk out with a satisfied smile on their faces. The very obvious hype around it makes you wait outside on weekends for anything from 15 to 45 mins but once to do get to claim a seat you are the king and you will be attended to with utmost care and attention. I personally have special affection for their Greek Drunken Prawns, Fish Muniere and Chicken a la Kiev but their cheese based dishes like Fish a la Indiana and mouth watering sizzlers are a rage among many foodies too. The food is filling and food lovers are bound to appreciate their desserts such as the Almond Souffle which is just as nice and leaves you craving for more. Only improvement that I think they need is to do justice to their garlic breads which are only toasted bread sqaures spread with garlic paste and butter. Other than that its a food lovers paradise for sure :)

This is very unusual that u see such behavior from such a restaurant,  these guys r just rude and irritating,  spoke to the guy he just doesn't understand's the value of time and tells 4 of us to wait for 2 people who gonna join in ten min,  they think they serve food only and there are no more restaurants in town,  sorry mate u r mistaken and by me writing this review I will ensure all forums u publicize this creepy behaviour

BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE - NOT ONLY ARE THEY COMPLETE RACIST PRICKS, THEY ARE CHEATS TOO. The price of Corona on the menu is 195. The actual price charged is Rs 450 not inclusive of taxes. Save yourself the torture of being looted, insulted, humiliated, and scandalised by their atrocious behaviour. NEVER VISIT THIS PLACE

I absolutely and totally love this place. This place is a must visit every time I come back to Kolkata. The food is great, specially their Chicken Paprika, Chicken Cordon Blue, Devilled Pepper Crab. 
       The ambience is great and it's location in the prime location such as Park Street just adds to its charm. The service is great although you might have to queue up to dine here as Mocambo is busy throughout the year, but most specially over the weekend and other holidays. 
         This is one place everyone must visit to really understand why most people believe Kolkata serves up some of the best food in this country.

Went there today. As we were running late today we were worried that the place might get too crowded and we would have to wait, but luckily we got there just before the place filled up! . 
The ambiance: This was our first time here.. and the feeling i got once inside is "why  have i not come here before?" the place  is very nicely decorated with the hanging lamps and super cozy seating arrangements! The chairs were super comfy! 
The Staff: I really have to admit the people here are one of the best! (if not the best!).. They are friendly, courteous, well versed in the menu specs, and just the perfect mixture of formal & informal! They are superb! Their good service made our day even brighter! 

The Food: Now comes the actual thing.. We ordered Chicken Cocktail Sausage, Angels on Horseback and Beef Steak in Pepper Sauce. and cold coffee with ice cream.  
The sausage comes six a plate with sauce,kasundi & finely fried potato slices  (just say "jhuri jhuri alu vaja!")  cooked to perfection!
Angels on Horseback is a spellbinding preparation, Chicken pieces cooked to be very soft & tender are wrapped by bacon and served on a bed of really fine rice (with chunks of sausage!!) along with sauteed veggies, potato, pasta on the side! It was a marvelous dish! 
The beef steak, done medium rare, was a little bit too chewy for my liking.. maybe it is supposed to be that way i don't know since this is the first time i tried beef steak.. So I guess I did not enjoy it that much & i have to be careful what i order :P ..
and the dessert is pretty good to.. nothing to highlight..
So in conclusion: 
Ambiance: 5.0
Staff & service: 5.0 surely
Food: 4.0

Hoping to come back again to try other exciting dishes & have a really nice experience ! 

Recommended dishes: Angels on Horseback, Chicken Cocktail Sausage

Unfortunately, my last visit to Mocambo's was very disappointing. The service was unsatisfactory. The mains were good, with portions just enough for one person per plate. But the dessert (Baked Alaska) was awful. It had probably been overdone, because the thing tasted burnt and bitter. We couldn't finish it. Really hadn't expected this from Mocambo's- it used to be one of my favourites.

This place is undoubtedly the pioneer of good continental cuisines in Kolkata. Visited this place numerous times with friends as well as family. Quality food, beautiful service punched with great ambiance makes this place a paradise for continental and Italian food lovers in the city. 
           My last visit to Mocambo was on this year's Durga Puja. Few dishes like Devil's crab and Chicken Cordon bleu needs no intro. Being the most famous dishes, they were top notch as usual . The new thing which we tried was the Chateaubriand beef steak. It was the best steak I have ever tasted! When sliced it showed the beautiful red color in the middle , gradually turning light to dark brown in the sides, the sign of a perfect medium rare!! The combo of garlic butter made it a heavenly experience! Another dish worth mentioning is the Risotto(I forgot the exact name :P) . The rice was nicely seasoned. The meat was cooked well! The sauce was delicious with right amount of flavors. 
Overall, another delightful experience!!
Ambiance : 4/5

CURRENT REVIEW:-
I heard that it is more discriminating than Donald Trump. So, 1 star. Would have given it 0 if I could. However, the food is not overrated.
PREVIOUS REVIEW:-
Had an awesome experience at Mocambo yesterday. I was recommended by the regular patrons to order Devilled Crab, which I did order. For the main course, I used my discretion to order the Surf n Turf.
The crab tasted as divine as it can get, with the perfect creamy taste of the combined flavours of the tenderly cooked crabmeat and the cheese. Then came the big boy, the Surf n Turf. I opted for the well-done, pepper sauce, sizzler one. It turned out to be one of the few food items that a person will remember forever. The tender yet crunchy prawns, and the perfect beef steak underneath, accompanied by boiled vegetables. Every mouthful was enjoyed, and a mental note was made to taste the Surf n Turf again. I even tasted the Fish a la Diane, and it was delicious as well. The service was very good, and the waiters very cooperative. The ambience is a special mention. It made the food experience all the more glorious.

Went to this place for the first time on Christmas eve. somehow never managed to go to Mocambo though visited Peter at or other restaurants so many times. We had to wait for more than 1 hour but at the end it was worth it. I fell in love with this place at first site. It was like having food in a festival as all the tables were full and nearly as many people queuing outside. The food? Is marvelous. We ordered for chicken a la kiev - oh that buttery feeling...OMG. The grilled fish sizzler was awesome and very filling. It was served with boiled peas, carrots, potatoes etc on a bed of cabbage. We also ordered for mixed grill sizzler and it was a wonderful combo of chicken tangri kebab, lamb, mutton seekh kebab, paneer and egg. Would love to go back to this place again and again.

Today, me and some ex-college friends met after a long time..and we decided to go to Mocambo for dinner. Was surprised at the behavior here. The person at the door told us straight that a table for 5 people would take around 1.30 hours. We thought at first that this was natural, the day being a Sunday. But then, looking around, we found that there weren't any people waiting. Surprised,we asked the reason, and the person told us that only "2-seaters and 3-seaters" were available. We accepted, and were waiting when we saw a group of 4 come and enter. The person at the door then said that a table for 4 was available, but there was not place for 5. It was almost as if they did not want us to enter..and so we finally went to Bar-B-Q. It was a very disappointing experience from what is supposed to be a very famous restro at park street.

Mocambo is one of the heritage restraunts in Kolkata..up there with the likes of Peter Cat..it's silightly on the expensive side...but the actual issue for giving it a 1 rating is the quality of service...its poor...we were seated at restraunt at 6.30pm and got the first order around 9 and there is no over exaggeration to this..the other feedback that I would like to give is the suggestion from the waiters do not come at all....

After having Chicken Ala Keiv at this iconic restaurant in Kolkata, I think I have conquered one of the highest peaks that an Indian foodie can conquer. It's almost like attaining food nirvana. And everything else at Mocambo adds further to that joy. Ambience is equally amazing. I don't want to write a lot. So to wrap up, the place is too good!

It was Mocambo where I had my first fine dining experience and it has not disappointed me till date. I believe very few restaurants in Kolkata have such a nice spread of continental dishes like Mocambo and I have always preferred to order the same. With its décor and ambience, this place gives a vibe of old Calcutta during British times.

 I love their prawn and crab cocktails (basically a mix of meat and flavored mayonnaise) in appetizers which are served in interesting chilled glasses. In main course, their chicken-a-la-kiev and fish-a-la-diane have always been my favorite. Sometimes it is difficult to interpret the description of the continental dishes- if they will be cheesy, saucy or having separate portions of rice, veggies and meat, but one can always seek the help of the waiters. They also serve good sizzlers and you would pretty often experience the hissing sound and charcoal smell of the same being taken to neighboring tables. 

Overall, it is a stylish place in a vintage way, appropriately priced keeping in mind the location, continuing to serve good food and keeping Calcutta happy 

A great place to overpay for your meal. The pork cutlet, supreme chicken and the cheese garlic dips are sublime. While the beef steak tastes like something so bad that it is hard to describe and grotesque to look at. 
Most of the people there are so serious that calling ambiance grim and dull would be an understatement.

Mocambo is my favorite restaurant in kolkata.  I always drop here when I'm in kolkata. The ambience is excellent,  location is good. The food is awesome. My all time favorites include cream of crab meat for starters,  main courses contains chicken a la Kiev,  Angels on horseback,  chipolata sizzlers,  etc. Followed by desserts like baked Alaska or cold everest. Exceptional quality. A must for all foodies out there.

I took my daughter to Mocambo because Feluda had mentioned going there with Topshe and Lalmohanbabu. So, first of, it is the historic and nostalgic value of the place. Second, the ambiance and food which is good. The attitude of the attendants, their colonial attire and their somewhat sloppy mannerism evoked mixed feelings- in me one of vague sadness and a annoyance and in my teenaged daughter, one of amused curiosity. The place is vintage and food authentic and satisfactory. It is always a pleasure to visit.

Mocambo is a part of the Kolkata experience. Anyone who's been a Calcuttan for a very long time would have frequented this restaurant. Same stands for me and out of my countless visits MOST of them have been pleasant. However, recently, we were served rotten potatoes and cold chicken and beef which is unacceptable  from a restaurant like Mocambo. However, apart from that the Chicken Ala Kiev is to die for and my personal favourite is the Tandoori Mix Grill. Though it isn't a conventional Moghlai place, their Kebabs are exceptional. Everything on the menu is pretty great and the Fish Florentine, Tetrazzini and the sizzlers in general are must-haves. Definitely worth the (longgggg) wait. :D

We went in on a Monday afternoon and I was immediately taken aback by the ambience.In one word.CLASSIC.
We ordered the deviled crab, fish sizzler, chicken sizzler and paprika chicken. They were served promptly.
The deviled crab was too cheesy for me.
The fish sizzler took top honours,twas gobsmack delicious.
Paprika chicken and the chicken sizzler were no less either esp the sausages which were flavor explosions on every bite.
Service is decent enough and it's extremely well priced.
Do not miss this one.

Mocambo... Rest assured this place has not changed... Be it the decor, be it the familiar faces or be it the most important part, the mouth-watering delicacies... Went there after a long time last Thursday afternoon, and it being the middle of the week, did not have to wait at all to get an empty table...

Coming straight to the food, we ordered prawn cocktail first, which was ethereal in taste... This dish is a must try... Next, we ordered Chicken Cordon Bleu, which again was brilliant... Next up was a Mocambo specialty, Angels on Horseback... The chicken tossed in bacon and delicious ginger rice is out of this world and is indeed a must have if you visit this place... Almost full by now, we still decided to put the elasticity of our stomachs to full test by ordering another fantastic dish, Fish A La Diana… The grilled fish stuffed with prawns, served with mashed potato and vegetables was a perfect end to the already sumptuous lunch… Would like to go back many times over for the love of the familiar and even the not so familiar dishes…

Love, Love, Love this place to death!
Right from their Devilled Crabs to their sizzlers to the Baked Alaska, everything is simply finger licking good!
The environment is as appealing as is the food here and every time you step in, you know your taste-buds  are gonna dance with joy! I keep coming back for their range of sizzlers which are by far the best in the city. 
The place keeps to its heritage and the taste of food has never deteriorated. Once might compare it with Peter Cat, but, for me Peter Cat doesn't even come close to Mocambo.
Mocambo has a varied menu and everything on it is a novelty worth trying. The servers are super hospitable and very cordial, none of which I find in the afore-mentioned rival.

I want every sea food lover to try their devilled  crabs. I assure you, you will wonder why you are paying so less for ride to heaven that it gives to you!
No wonder you have to fight your way in even on weekdays!

I literally updated my WhatsApp status as "Mocambo Khush Hua" on the very night I visited the place..  I know that billions of words had already been written to admire the astounding interior or the appeasing ambience of Mocambo so it would be rather wise not to look for further superlatives and straight come to the point..And the 'point' is food, food and food.. Here, I had the best (yes, I mean it) beef steak in my entire life.. Every time the brilliantly cooked Chateaubriand steak, served with pepper sauce entered my esophagus, the God of Gastronomy definitely gave a standing ovation.. And I was quite assured about the quality of the other delicacies in the menu when the cliché Reshmi Kebab tasted heavenly..The attendants were humble, suggested us rightly what to pick from the menu as we were in a slight hesitancy..Mega-Giga-Tera 'Like' for 'Mocambo'..You are 'Gorgeous'.. :)

Those orange lights and the seating is cheerful with all that brightness...chicken paprika and fish biryani was good..creamy spring chicken soup was excellent... but I dint like the prawn fried rice I felt that the prawns were still raw...angles on the horse back is surely recommended...we had a really good time and its been an unforgettable experience at mocambo...I suggest who ever are visiting kolkata to visit mocambo too

I went to Mocambo after hearing about it from many of my friends. Some gave me a negative opinion about this restaurant. But frankly saying,it's excellent. It's one of a kind.
The two of their items which made me go there once again are Fish Florentine and Angels on Horseback. But the waiters were a little erratic as it was a rush hour.

To me you are just another version of Peter Cat. What I like here the most is the prawn and mushroom salad. Then there is cheese and fish filleto with garlic bread that comes in a bowl, chicken pavlograd, angels on horse back and the A La Kiev. Fish Diana is good too. Rest i didn't taste. But I prefer the Peter Cat chelo and sizzlers.

Update (30/12/17): Has turned very average, with slow service which renders the food cold. The food is average as well, with their decor still the same old thing. Maybe best avoided.  

Iconic in Kolkata, Mocambo is iconic for its food too, and there is no other way to say it. The only reason I haven't rated it a full 5, is because I have dined out here far too many times! If you haven't been to Mocambo ever, today is just as good a day as any other. The same applies if you have been here. :)

The food is perfect in portion, and as good as it gets in preparation. Presented with class, the City of Joy offers very few alternatives to a dine out at Mocambo! The place just screams happy. The food, from soups to sizzlers to softies, are all to die for. Just order anything really.

The ambience is good, the staff are professional.
For a high class meal, the bill is extremely low.

This is my father's favourite restaurant, and for good reason, what else can you ask for from a restaurant? If you're asking for the perfect night out, look no further.

Update (25/11/2015): Perhaps just as good as they were last time I visited. I always end up ordering the Crab meat soup, and that's probably the only aspect of last night's meal which may have lacked the exceptional quality we all have come to expect. The star was the Angels on Horseback, but take nothing away from the rest of their food. As good as ever!

Thanks for reading, and pardon me for any grammatical mistakes I may have made. :)

Mocambo is my favourite restaurant in all Kolkata. But on weekend the wait time is long, so if you don’t want to wait and get a seat as soon as you arrive, my advice, reach there before its 8.  I have come here many times and have never been disappointed. Yesterday I went in went with a couple of friends. We Ordered Devilled Crab for starters, it was absolutely orgasmic, melts in mouth leaving an absolutely fabulous taste and a tandoori platter. For main course we ordered Chicken Cordon Blue, Chicken Paprika, Fish A La Diana and Fried Prawns. Every single dish was spot on. The Chicken Cordon was perfectly cooked with cheese cream oozing out if its centre, absolutely sumptuous. Fish a La Diana was mouth-watering, Soft savoury and perfect and the chicken Paprika is a wholesome meal , with vegis and a little flavoured rice and chicken on its side, a light meal but equally delicious. Admittedly the bill was a little on the higher side, but seriously can’t complain. We walked out of the restaurant with our stomach and hearts full . Mocambo is not only a must visit but also a visit again repeatedly anytime you don’t have to stand in line .

NO LOVE IS GREATER THAN THE LOVE OF EATING

The above quote always appears to be appropriate every time I have visited Mocambo. The food here is always up to the mark and one keeps on relishing it.

The sitting though cluttered, it is always buzzing with activities, people don't mind waiting a good half an hour to an hour to lay their hands on the evergreen delicacies.

On this visit we tried Chicken Paprika, Chicken Tetrazzini and Irish Chateaubriand Beef Steak, all of them turned out to be really great. The steak was perfectly well done and the Paprika and Tetrazzini flavour blended completely with the steak.

Overall this joint always have worked out pretty well for me and have left me with a craving to return for more.

Being a lover of ITALIAN foods we ordered Risotto Di Scampi a preparation of rice with crab meat and prawns and Risotto with chicken bacon and both were very tasty But a litlle bit of seasoning would have been better . We also ordered Chicken steak with mushroom sauce in sizzler variant and it was good too .

Took a couple of my friends out to this iconic restaurant ....disappointing to see that the quality of service has come down and the nimbleness which was there earlier...was missing. I was visiting Mocambo after a decade I guess.Yes the queues etc are still there...but if there are no efforts to also keep up with the times...I am afraid this restaurant will go down in the history books as " Once upon a time in Calcutta....."

Mocambo is one of those restaurants which I have known right from the day I understood What food is and how you should judge its taste. Visiting the eating hut with my family and enjoying the great taste here is one of the best thing I do when I am in Kolkata. Really the dishes are yummmm and attractive. And as with time the quality is becoming more and more elegant and enlightening. The perfect food hut for ALL!!!

People visiting Kolkata ....should visit MOCAMBO once!!!

those were the days when the movie kahani was much discussed about in every circles....and with that movie a few places in kolkata became more popular or so as i guessed....though it maybe the case that they were popular form the beginning....nonetheless the name of mocambo became popular with the people living outside kolkata..me included....so I decided that this place should be tried out no matter what....as with any good restaurant in park street mocambo can also be identified by a long queue of waiting people outside the gate. so like other people i also decided to wait and try the place no matter. once I entered along with a friend of mine the ambience jst struck me....it was pleasant with good lights....with clean tables and comfortable chairs....the cutlery was fabulous too...felt almost royal....now comes the most important part and that is the food....which was not at all a disappointment...we mostly ordered non-veg and it was delicious well cooked and served as we wished to. i loved the cecil's chicken and the sizzler we ordered was equally good. the drinks' menu was an interesting one as it had drinks graded according to price too which was something I havent found in any other restaurant i have eaten. more or less it ws  satisfactory....though a bit expensive but we can all once in a while afford to spend a little extra fr such food and an overall nice experience...I have been back to mocambo a couple of times and wasnt disappointed ever....a must try i would say if u love continental food....

Starters were the best. Particularly enjoyed the deviled crab. Our main course reminded me of my grandmothers cook books from the 1970s though, a little dated in style and side veggies over cooked. Great ambience though and service was excellent.

Tried chicken pavloguard n chicken paprika n both were awesome... Chicken pavloguard is a richer creamier version of chicken ala kiev n it's surely better than alakiev with that oozing butter just melts my heart which tastes absolutely divine with baked potatoes n little pasta in creamy tomato sauce. Some steamed veg also accompanied the dish... Next chicken paprika is a creamy gravy based chicken dish with little flavoured rice, baked potatoes n steamed vegetables... Tasted awesome. Looking forward to my next visit.....

This is one of the famous eateries, located at the heart of parkstreet which actually grew to a brand over these years and the bustling crowd here during the whole week, only adds leverage to that fact. Visited this place a couple of days back with few of my friends and as expected the ambience and food quality was quiet well. We tried the continental and a few indian dishes. Both were equally delicious. But frankly speaking I was not very happy with the service. Though i agree it was a weekend but still the food took nearly 45 mins to get served and even for the bill we have to wait for nearly 15 mins. So overall a nice resturant with quality food but surely need to take care of their services.

The most awaited restaurant of Calcutta, oops KOLKATA. The fish malai kebab is my hot favourite here. Though the long line may disturb your enzymes a bit but it could have been no better process to increase it's TRP :p well it may let a pinch in your pocket but it's worth it. The service is really good apart from the crowd. Must go and check the kebabs and other continentals.

We went Mocambo on 20th September, 2014. Most awaited restaurant which we wanted to give a try..This restaurant is there from ages....
The ambience is good..crowdy, dim lights and chit chats all around..
Coming to food..we had ordered
1. Devilled Crab----Yummy, tender n creamy...5 star to this..
2. Chicken Paprika---It was like chicken with stir fried veggies n rice...Was Ok Ok..
3. Chicken A La Kiev-----It was good..nothing extraordinary...
4. Chicken Steak with Mushroom Sauce Sizzler----It was good...
6. Irish Beef Steak...which one of my frnd ordered...according to him it was fabulous...
7. Pork Sirloin Steak Sizzler---It was the best among all sizzlers...
8. Mix Sizzler---which has chicken steak, sausages, mutton/chicken liver and slices of bacon...it was big in size but tastes Ok Ok...
9. Meringue with Vanilla Ice cream---nothing extraordinary..but yummy...
10. Souffle Ala Surprise Mocambo...Ice cream with pistachios...Was good...

Overall it was good experience...I think it's overrated as per taste but big in quantity..
Service is too bad and slow...
Will come back for sizzlers for sure..

Cheers!!!!!

This is my all time favourite restaurant and i love to visit it again and again. Last week i took the opportunity of visiting this place again with my friend. I absolutely love their ambiance which obviously includes the cozy sitting arrangements. This time i wanted to try out something new so i ordered chicken chipolata and i suggested my friend to order chicken oriantale ala mocambo ( because i really like this dish ). This dish contains chicken along with mushroom and this is served with rice- a very light dish and in one word worth it. I was equally in love with chicken chipolata- it had chicken piece along with 4 or 5 sausages and bacon also pasta and veggies. I really liked the taste of the sauce and in totality i was impressed. The other dishes which i absolutely love are chicken pavlograd ,fish a la diana and chicken steak. I feel they serve good food and in comparison to it the price is not that hiked. I always forget to take any pictures because the moment the food is placed i just can't wait but eat.

I love I love I love this place. A beautiful blend of tradition with modernity. It very boldly upholds the Victorian Calcuttian heritage and at the same time has been a fav hotspot of genY- ranging from Bollywood to Tollywood. There desserts are particularly mouth watering.

I couldn't help but write this review for a place that's almost a heritage restaurant in the best of kolkata-park street. The trigger was a sumptuous lunch at mocambo and a dear friend admitting she's never been there! I'll keep it short and tasty. Meat lovers, this is the place . sophisticated, heritage, great food.I would definitely suggest the pork cutlet.it lives upto being insanely tasty. Do give your taste buds a piece of chicken chipolata sizzler.others mentionable is irish beef steak, tandoori mixed grill,fish florentine, chicken a la kiev.overall great place

Excellant food and old authentic continental and Mediterranean food...

A must visit resturant if you are a food lover...
We loved the devilled crab.. Which ia baked crab meat with cheese and mayo...
Then fish floretine.. Chicken ala mocambo... Chicken steak sizzlers are awesome..
But chicken ala kiev is unique...this is must try and it is made nearly perfectly... It is a must have..
Deserts are also delectable..Baked alaska is presented in a great way.. It comes with a blue flame.. Outside is egg white, qhile inside is Icecream, fruits and cakes... Awesome very unique!!!

1. Food - 4.5/5
2. Ambience - 3.5/5

The taste has deteriorated for sure, I could myself differentiate within a span of 4 months. Though its one of the few places where one can get authentic, continental food. I wish they pay a little attention in improving their foods, then it might regain its old position.
Though I love the fact that this is a place where you can get Chicken, Pork, Beef & Fish items under one roof..

Mocambo having such a reputation fails to live up to any of it. The continental stuff is okay at maximum and the desserts are a big, big disaster. We ordered for a chocolate and orange soufflé but were presented with two cups of curdled mess which was inedible. Even the baked Alaska was nothing but a huge disappointment. We regret coming here....will definitely not recommend it to anyone.

Whenever the name mocambo comes to my mind, it brings a lot of old and cherishing memories of childhood in front of my eyes. I was introduced to this place by my father when i couldnt even pronounce the name "Mocambo" and i barely could get my hands to the dishes in the table. Mocambo is the final and inevitable destination for our Weekend dinners and sunday brunches. Dining at this place is kind of a tradition that runs in our family. I cannot recall a single day when i visited this place and didn't started our treat without ordering the evergreen "Deviled Crab", then approaching towards " chicken ala kiev" or "chicken tettrazzini"etc. As my father said, he started coming to this place when he was a teenager and according to him everything in this restaurant from the decors( the sofas, carpets, the layouts) everything was the same. Till date whenever i see those red leather sofas, those soothing lights over the tables; it takes to the vivid trip to my childhood days. Days and years have passed i have grown up but whenever i enter this place it seems like the time has stucked still forever. The food is still that succumbing, the waiters were as friendly and helpful as ever. And the long queue outside the restaurant during every late evening glorifies the legacy of Mocambo. Thankyou for preserving my precious childhood memories with such perfection.

I don't know why I haven't reviewed this place yet, I mean this is & has been my go to place! I love Mocambo, everything about it- the old world charm, the decor, the ambiance & most importantly the food! Perfect continental to subtle Indian, they serve it all.
Yes, you may have to wait for a very long time on most of the days but its worth it. 
Coming to the food I have had so many of their dishes so many times that I can't write about them all here. To name a few of my favourites from their elaborate menu - Chicken tetrazinni, Deviled Crab, Stuffed Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Ala Kiev, Chicken Orientale a la Mocambo, Fish Steak, Chicken steak, Fish A la Diana Murg Firdausi kebab etc.
I highly recommend this place to all. Just a word of caution: they serve subtle flavors, & some of their dishes might taste to bland to those who are accustomed to junk food! :P

middle of Park Street, right beside Au Bon Pain. I can vouch that it is one of the best restaurants in Kolkata serving Continental cuisine. It will be a herculean task to find another eatery in Kolkata providing so many choices in continental dishes.

Talking about Décor- it is the same from ages. It provides an old-worldly charm taking us to the Raj era.

Make sure you reach there a bit early as there are queues during the dinner time. This shows that it is very popular among everybody out here. 

Mocambo offers both Indian (Mughlai and North Indian preparations) and continental dishes (steak, grill, pastas) – vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Some of my favorite dishes that you must try are Chicken Tetrazzini, Angels on Horseback etc. For Sizzler lovers, try Chipolata or Surf n Turf. Their steak is awesome specially Irish Chateaubriand and Beef Steak. Don't go for well done option, because they overcook it, try the medium.

The staff always looks a bit grumpy; it surely does help if they are friendlier!

Been here twice and would like to go many times for sure in the future. Tried Fish Meuniere which is a heritage dish served by this restaurant. The Chicken Chipolata was another great dish having chicken wrapped in bacon and veggies. The Chicken A-la-Kiev was a delightful thing with butter oozing out of the chicken as soon as you cut through it. The Pork Sizzler was tasty. We tried Baked Alaska and Mango Souffle for desserts. The Baked Alaska is a speciality here. A kind of a pudding with a fruit cake inside served with a halo of blue flame. The best thing is beer is still served in copper mugs.One place in Kolkata which you cannot miss. Must visit this.

One of the few places in this city that serves perfect continental dishes starting from the gushing of melted butter from their chicken chipolata to the creaminess of the fish florentine. Their dishes are just perfect. The prawn cocktail is the best I have had ever . You won't be satisfied by coming here just once . Cause u have to try the rest of their menu . Each is tastier than the other

Mocambo has been my sanctum ever since I visited Kolkata for the first time. It's old world decor takes you back in time (the prices too). Its continental specialities including Devilled Pepper Crab, Fish Munieure, are to die for. Though not a beer fan I make sure to order that every time I go there as it's served in a silver beer mug :). I would recommend this restaurant to every avid foodie traveling to the city of joy.

If you are looking for a place which serves ideal European and Mediterranean delicacies then Mocambo is the ideal place to go and relish their food items. The restaurant situated in Park Street is famous for traditional Mediterranean dishes. I remember last time when I was there, a plate full with crab meat cocktail was something to start the meal. Crab is my weakness and the dish was unforgettable. Among the soup I preferred cream of spring chicken. Next was fish Wellington beautiful dish. This has the real touch of your mama’s cooking fish curry. Rice is my first preference so I ordered mixed fried rice and mutton dopiaza. And the two were complementing each other. The meal got its fabulous flavour with mutton seek kebab and another fish item tandoori fish. The restaurant has risotto which is a famous Italian dish and I am going to taste that next time. And my meal got finished with strawberry milk shakes.

Sorry to rain on another's parade but I have tasted better. Yes the food is good but it is marginalised by the service and ambience that need overhauls.

This legendary restaurant is an institution and shall always remain on top of my list of must-visit eateries in Calcutta. Apparently the only fine-dine restaurant that continues to serve Anglo-Indian cuisine after the closure of Skyroom. My favourites here are Chicken Paprika, Oriental Chicken a la Mocambo, Ham steak, Chicken Pavlograd, Veg. Lasagna and their famous Baked Alaska! However, one of their most talked-about dishes i.e. the Deviled Crabs came as a huge disappointment as I personally felt that the huge amount of cheese was killing the delicate flavour of crab meat - so I think this can be given a miss. I usually don't write about the ambiance of a restaurant but this one is worth a special-mention - it's spectacular, I must say.

This is one place in Park Street that I never get tired of visiting. From food, to looks everything in here makes an evening perfect for me! Some people might think of the decor of the place as shabby, but to me it feels like home as I've gotten used to it.

The food....oh what can I say! Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! all along!

The Chicken Ala Kiev, Fish Diana, Fish Florentine and so many more....each and every one of these dishes packs a big punch. I kinda mouth watering now :(

Anyway, if you folks go there and you like chicken make sure you order the chicken cordon bleu. I'm sure you won't be disappointed one bit. I wouldn't recommend the sizzlers so often these days cause to honest, the quality of that particular dish in my opinion has hit a rough spot. There's too much usage of raw cabbage at the bottom compared to what they were earlier. The chicken breast too has shrunk in size, which shrinks my heart :(

But overall, its a great place to hang out with your buddies and family for a good ol evening! 

So have fun, enjoy and get that tummy worshiped!

Cheese pillows are a must try! It's a veg dish and comes with spinach stuffed within, but it's totally worth it! The chicken paprika is a well balanced dish, not too cheesy and neither too spicy. Although it doesn't beat the Chelo Kebab at Peter Cat, the mix of rice, veggies and chicken in this dish goes down sufficiently well for one person. The risottos are not overwhelming, but decent. Maybe less Italian than one might expect (they don't serve pasta in arrabbiata?!!) The food, however, is well complemented by a glowing ambience and cozy seating...

Mocambo is my personal favourite of all the places in Park Street to get continental food. Its somewhere I usually suggest to my friends whenever we are going for a dinner together. The ambience is amazing, the Menu card is very detailed and one can get a lot of variety in the type of dish to order. I love the Pork Chops, Angels on Horseback and Chicken Tetrezzini of Mocambo. The cocktails are also excellent. The desert menu is a bit limited but overall an excellent place to have lunch or dinner. One of the top places to eat in Kolkata for me

mocambo is one of the best restaurant where you get good continental, i simply love their creamy yet light fish florentine, the meat lasagna is also really good, the best thing about this place are the waiters they really help you out when you are really confused by seeing such mouth watering delicacies and cannot understand what to order they are a life savior and after knowing your preferences the recommend the best dishes. the chicken ala kiev is also good and the sizzlers are also worth a try.
            

Everything is good but this inhumane behaviour is not and we in this 21st century we should not tolerate it, so please avoid such restaurants where people lack basic humanity.

The place certainly does exude an old world charm, though I wish it wasnt this crowded and I missed my privacy.
On another note less crowd is too much too expect when the food is this good.
Chicken a la kiev...chicken chipolata sizzler..chicken orientale a la mocambo. .. stuff dreams are made of...
Delectable awesomeness. .! ;)

First of all the interiors will take you back someplace in the classy past. But had to wait for about 2hrs to get inside!! Yes let me come to the food first! You should know your dishes before you order! If you order something random I don't know what will be your experience! I ordered chicken steak with veggies and it was good! Inspite of that my sister ordered chicken siselini ( sorry if I have spelt It wrong :p) but it was awefull and also the chicken Tetrazzini! The starters were incomparable , though I can't remember the name! All over its a good place to have a drink and good food but not to get wasted!

Great place to have continental food and light drinks. Good food, ambience and service. Would love to come back. On the negatives - probably the dessert menu and quality can improve.

My introduction to crabmeat of super quality. Pepper devilled crab is a staple order for me whenever i visit. So is the fish A La Diana. My friends tell me that the rest of the menu is stellar too, though i rarely venture beyond these 2 dishes.. good setting and friendly service is a bonus. Don't venture into the cocktails (not too great), rather stick to beer or plain liquor of your choice. A must visit, a Kolkata classic :)

Wow... U cant ask for more... This restaurant has every dish u want it and it is just awesome. Once u eat here you will love the food. The quality and quantity is excellent and the.service too is good. Ambience is alright. Of those who love fish must try here. The prawns, fish dishes are above average. It is indeed a place to come relax and rejuvenate yourself if you are in  Sort of bad mood.

mocambo is one such iconic place where you will seldom find food to be average, from its delicious pork chop to the amazing surf & turf ( well done without sizzler and with pepper sauce ), mocambo has it all , a perfect blend of mild ambience, variety in cuisine and obviously fabulous food.

A legend of its own & perhaps the only one liner fitting good for it is
'whatever you go for, it has to be good'

Pork chop, spaghetti carbonara, devilled crab, Angels on horse back, chicken pavlograd, chicken tetrazzini ( heavy on cheese ), fish a la Diana ( irresistible ), Beckti Filipino, surf and turf ( signature ) & baby Alaska .......& the list will continue

Well these are few among the long list of 'must try'

Mocambo is a place I've been visiting since my childhood... A few dished never grows old... Chicken imperial.. Chicken a la Kiev... Fish Meuniere... And ofcourse chicken paprika...

The place brings nostalgia and the quality of food is more or less still the same...

Been here quite a few times. One of the best restaurants in kolkata serving continental fare. There is so much to choose that it becomes difficult to decide. The Prawn Cocktail and Fish Munia is a must try for anyone visiting Mocambo for the 1st time. In the main course there is a lot of whole food that can be ordered including variety of sizzlers. But my personal favorite is the Chicken Aa-la-kiev and Chicken Cordon Bleu. The decor and ambiance has a very vintage feel with the waiters dressed in while pathani suits and turban. Also the service is commendable even in heavy rush which is always there. Even though there is always a long wait to get in but I have always come back stuffed and satisfied.

639 reviews in Zomato already. So I will just briefly give my two pence worth review. It's a stalwart amongst the numerous Park street restaurants.
 Mainly a place for continental food items with innovative and gorgeous names.
 They have a long hall type room with 4 rows of seating arrangements with sofas and chairs. But the low lying lights give a sort of privacy for each set of seats. 
 The decor has been maintained properly which doesn't show deteriorating cutlery or the drapes and table cloths-which is the case with many other peers of the area.
 The servers are all senior people with an air which might be deserving. 
 Items are named too fancifully which sometimes leave you clueless but for the detailed description. For example Angels on horseback and Baked Alaska- both of which are delectable.
 Chicken tetrazini, A la kiev, Fish a la Diana, Moutarde, Angels on horseback are all hot favourites. Baked alaska is superbe. Crab preparations are innovative. Lots of cheese and butter are used in their preparations.
 Pricing is decent for the area.
 It's a must visit place for me and I recommend it heartily.

They will serve you with the best Continental food in Kolkata, but the overall experience will not make you happy. 

The Fish ala Diana and Chicken ala kiev and Chicken Oriental Mocambo are really good. Their beef steak and sizzlers are also pretty decent. Ambiance is cool. Price is a bit on the higher side, as expected. But the rude behavior of the staffs, especially the doorman  is simply unacceptable.

Good foods can make anyone happy. Anyone. It doesn't matter whether you are a foodie or sad or tired or frustrated. It straight hits to your soul and make you happy or may be more than happy. Yes, Mocambo is one of them which will definitely make you happy. You would definitely fall in love with their foods and simple old Kolkata restaurant decor.

As per the food and service both are good though you would have to follow the queue on weekends and special events. But it's worth to wait, no matter whether it's nearly 45 minutes. We did. But once the waiting is over, it's your territory to grab the menu and just bang on. Mocambo people are at your service.

Food complement : I would say 'wow' in Saif Ali Khans wonder tone. just had some of their signature and regular dishes.

Devilled crabs: well, dear o dear if you are going to order this dish one plate than I must suggest you better not go for it, within few minutes your plate would be empty and you would ask for more. The best one that they serve. A true Mocambo class.

Meat lasagna : Top one. (Though I found it little salty and a bit extra parsley)

Angels on horseback: delighted. Must try this one.

Chicken ala keiv : killer. :P the best one, that I ever had. Butter and butter, loved it.

Fish florentine : Stunning signature dish. A humble respect to the souls of bhetki gilled with cheese. Had it. Respect given, salute :P

Baked alaska: liked the concept a flaming iceberg is coming to you, you would love the looks but real fantacy starts when you break the ice and dig it to the center....loved it, but don't forget the cherry, just had it yeaar it's fresh :)

The more I would say about this place the more I would wonder to re-visit again. A perfect restaurant in the heart of kolkata, pleasing continental food lovers!!

Been there only once two months ago. So won't talk about their consistency about which I have heard not so good. I was there with my friend & ordered beef & fish steaks. Both were mouth watering. Decor has a old world charm. We had a sit by the window by the road side that made the ambience really good. Service is helpful but need to be faster.

When memories crash, it hurts and hurts real bad. Had a disastrous experience at Mocambo day before yesterday, gone is my once upon a time favorite food joint of Calcutta - right from the décor to the service to the food, everything was pathetic, laid back and ‘dry’.

My cousins had reached the place early and were already there at the table when I went in. A sour-faced guest-in-charge who ushered me in, didn’t even bother to guide me to the table, I was left to look for them on my own. Dusty, faded carpets folded at odd angles (almost tripped twice), cramped space for 5 given to the 6 of us, which finally was shifted to a proper table for 6 on request, watery side plates, marked the beginning of the crack. There were too many ‘service providers’ around, all seemingly busy without business. Almost after 15 minutes of wait, we were forced to beckon one, to take the order. We started with Murg Firdausi Bari Kebabs and Fish Fingers. Both lacked that subtle juiciness, both were so dry that we had to literally wash them down with our drinks. The main course that we had ordered included Chicken Sicilliene and Chicken Milanese (both cheesy chicken conconctions with no visible difference except for a shredded boiled egg on the top of one). Tasted good though, those two were the only saving grace of all that we had ordered. My Irish Chateaubriand Beef Steak Sizzler with Garlic-Butter was more of a minced meat patty, chewy & dry to the core, served with some over-boiled vegetables on the side. So was my cousin’s Mutton Hamburger Steak, which she had to literally push down her throat, don’t think she could finish it either. The icing was on the cake however, was my cousin brother’s Naan with Saag Gosht, which the waiter had recommended. The look was ‘hum pe ye kisne hara rang dala’, the addition of colour was that obvious! He had ordered for two naans. One was served with the food and they conveniently forgot about the second one! Dada kept on waiting and considered to be one of the coolest in the family, he too looked visibly upset. We had to remind them and then after a good 10 minutes the second naan was served but guess by that time Dada’s appetite had gone for a toss. I refrained from ordering dessert, my niece did and the cream caramel pudding was a watery, very badly presented concoction; tasted good though, as in the kid liked it.

Very very heartbroken, not sure if I’d want to visit Mocambo again…

Good ambience but poor service. Had to wait 1 hour in rain before I got entry. Adding to my grieve order took 50 minutes to be served and it was cold. I called up the manager to have a word and he was indifferent to me. He was busy "managing" other things. It did make me angry and I left the food there only. 2000 bucks I spent for one bite. Even after all this the staff didn't have the courtsey to apologise. Pathetic place to have food.

Itz a cosy place,the tables are placed not even a hands gap in between...but the orange hanging lamps,the couches will make you feel ease. A place where you can be with friends or family.
We ordered for Chicken Paprika and Chicken Tetrazini from chef's special. Both the dishes are finely done and tastes awesome. But Tetrazini itself will make you full and high calorie.
Service is also quick enough.
Hope to visit this place soon to try the other dihes.

One of the famous joints in park street area, Mocambo has warm seating options. This place serves continental and Italian food. There is not much to say about the decor, It is like a usual Kolkata restaurant with those orange lamps  hanging right up to the table which gives it a warm feel. 
Food:
It is hard to miss the consistent and quality food this place has been serving over the years. I ordered chicken a la Kiev, one of the classic Continental dishes . Perfect and well flavoured , this dish is not for the calorie conscious. We also had La fish a la diana, and the thought of the dish makes my mouth water. Would recommend both the dishes to anyone going there. 

Overall, Mocambo is a great place to satisfy the hunger pangs, have a real satisfying meal and spend some quite/noisy time with freinds/ family. Worth the indulgence!!

After 1633 votes and 624 reviews, there isn't much about the place which hasn't been said about. A legend in the making and situated in one of the most happening streets of the city, this place has a tale of its own.

25B Park Street, near the crossing overlooking Flury's, its an easy catch. Dressed in the old 'Calcutta' style exterior, this restro dates its presence from 1956. An European Oasis of Glamour and Jazz, as put forth by the New York Times, this place still holds a lot of its old world charm. The live dance may be a history but the fuzz is retracted in its impeccable food quality, even today.

It was a Nabami night in durga puja day and we were lucky to wait only 45 mins to get in whilst a good crowd was waiting outside to gorge in the charm of the vicinity and the aura of the past.  Seated comfortably, we went on with a plain sweet lime soda at first. As everyone was out and out non-vegetarian and so were our choices. We ordered devilled crabs, meat lasagna, Fish florentine, Angels on horseback and Chicken ala kiev. The devilled crabs , fish florentine and the meat lasagna were the clear winners in the evening but the perfection in the taste was much beyond the best! It was something which makes the customers coming again and again... and thats what makes this place legendary. They got everything right on the Angels on horseback except the overcooked chicken. THe risotto and the pasta along with the sausages were great but the chicken were a bit overdone. The chicken ala kiev looked exciting but didnt appealed to me much though the taste was good.

The desert menu had only one inclusion - The baked alaska. A foamed covered heap of pastry, cream and fresh fruits, studded by fuming alcohol on the curve... this was a treat to watch. The taste was fine but yes was expecting a little more spark.

Whatever it is, its very difficult to judge a restro of this stature by tasting mere a handful of dishes when it has so much to serve from the rich palette which has been sweeping people off their feet for long. Still, the experience was amazing... and its defintely on my to-go list again.

So, to savour a nice continental treat this place is definitely on books everywhere. Just soak in the atmosphere and there's nothing to get you disappointed. Happy Eating!!!

Mocambo in Park Street is one of the pretty-good restaurants to hit. The decor is nice and classy, ambiance with good crowd and great music, and fine service makes your time an enjoyable one. Must try dishes are the Devilled crab and Chicken paprika, and also please please try the lamb steaks and pork chops! We didn't have dessert here so not much clue regarding that. Reservation highly recommended since there is always a line outside, waiting.
The waiters could do with a little more elaborate knowledge about the dishes, though..they often take time in clarification and refer to another person when asked. Otherwise, service is good.

Must visit here. :)

Though a bit pricey, it's worth it!" That's what my review looked like Two years back. But after the recent inhumane , racist and downright disgusting incident of not letting a person enter on some absurd grounds that he wasn't properly dressed, I am compelled to edit my review. Shame on you!

This is my second or third encounter at Mocambo, this time during the Puja with a large crowd waiting outside for their numbers or names to be called out. We were three in the group, wishing to taste continental in a good one, to change the over-dose of chinese and mughlai for the past 3 days. After a wait of 1 hour, we got in. Mocambo gives me a good feeling with its warm ambiance and settings, it's so romantic and elegant. 
We have ordered for Angels-on-horse-back, Chicken-chipolata, and pork-steak. The Angels tasted like real angels inside the mouth with finely fried chicken served with risotto. The steak was as usual yum. The chipolata with bread roll was somewhat disappointing, I did not like the taste. 
The service part is swift and good. Mocambo has a bar option also like many restaurants of park street area. The price is definitely not on the light side and 3 dishes can clinch you a 1500 bucks almost with taxes. 
But it is worth visiting!

P.S. I love clicking pics of my friends here, gives a very nice woodwork background if you sitting in the middle, and the hanging lampshades just adds to the wow.

Had loads of expectation on them.but they failed disgustingly to serve me tasty delicious food.we ordered fish a la Diana and chicken a la mocambo and chicken sizzler...fish was served with stuffings and tangy white sauce.  The combo tasted horrible in mouth. Chicken mocambo was good but quantity was poor. Sizzler was pathetic...pathetic than any dish. Wanted to skip beef and pork.that's why we decided fish and chicken.for this resin,we skipped or dessert having here.
This was my first visit and the waiting time around 4 o'clock was 10 minutes.food arrived after 45 minutes.
The ambience need a change.they must match up with the food price.

I would say not the best but a very very famous and old restaurant in our city.
I personally have three favorite dishes... and they are great...

1. Prawn cocktail: cold prawns in cold sauce..the sauce is basically a mixture of white sauce and tomato tangy but trust me...feels like heaven if you love prawn. 

2. Fish a la diana: a wrap of Bhetki stuffed with prawn and mushrooms and cooked served with some boiled beans, carrots, peas and potatoes, bread and butter. 

3. Chicken a la kiev...a kind chicken stroganoff

4. Baked Alaska...if you love desserts.

old review:Food and ambiance were awesome.  one thing that irritated me was before we finished the dessert the bill was on our table and also fresh plates, spoons were stacked up at one corner of the table. .well i understand during "Durga Puja" they have a huge demand and i could see a long line outside the restaurant but this behavior is not acceptable from them. . but yes the food, ambience and the people were very good ...

A legendary place in the heart of my city and hadnt been there even after spending 23 springs..I was suffering with a guilt, which drived me to visit the place on this Maha Panchami evening along with 3 more friends. Old wooden furnishings, dim orangish lights, comfy seats.. Decor and ambiance was pretty appetizing. Waiter came almost instantly, we decided On having
1. Devilled Crab- Self proclaimed heritage item on the menu..it was an automatic choice..two pieces of very well cooked crab, so well done that you can pierce through the shell with a fork and inside the shell you will find a creamy(And yummy) mixture of minced chicken and cheese. Presentation makes this dish even more appealing. Two thin slices of egg resting on a sheet of melted cheese..high on calorie, high on taste. I personally would hav loved a hint of black pepper in it.
2. Chicken Tetrazini- Looked delicious, tasted not so delicious. Though highly recommended for cheese lovers, I personally felt a little funny sensation as the loads of cheese went down my throat. Its basically chunks of chicken, strips of bell pepper and pasta in a bed of cheese.
3. Mutton Peshwari kebab- Classic kebabs.very soft, very tender, alnost kept falling off the forks it was that soft. With ample amount of lime juice, it was a hit!
4. Angels On Horseback- Ya, angels came down from heaven..medium boneless pieces of chicken bacon wrapped, served with a saucy rice base, pasta,and boiled veggies..a continental food lover's ideal comfort food. Must try!
5. Washed it down with Aerated drinks.

Total cost- Rs 1750
Pretty descent On price and slightly abive descent regarding quality. Being a continental lover would love to go back to try to Fish items and chicken a la Kiev.
Overall, nice experience! Cheers!

For all the hype and talk.. i decided one day to visit the famous mocambo restaurant. As usual we were told to wait.. It was almost 9.30 and i could very well see a few seats vacant. So after waiting sometime i decided to go ask the guys at the door to ask for one of those vacant seats.. to which he said..."they are 6 seaters "...i was like hello.. its almost 9.30 are u expecting more customers.. u might jus give the seat to us... anyways.. after making us wait some more time.. i donno wat he thought..he let us take that exact 6 seater..
Upon entering i found the ambience truly appealing.. seats wer comfortable..but i found the food to b nothing spectacular(for all the hooplah).
My advice.. try the fish items..they are good ..so was the chicken paprika... overall an ok ok place...for all the hype i found the place too costly (1800 fr 3 of us ).. and food ordinary.. i hav had better...

I have had food at Mocambo before, but never did I think I would have to face such a situation. I am utterly disappointed with Mocambo for their service, food and pretty much everything.

Due to certain amount of tension that has been raiding my mind for a pretty long time, me and my partner S, decided to relieve all the tension with the help of some good food. Mocambo seemed like a pretty good choice for both of us. Since this is a very old joint and we both have eaten food here, we decided to try their delicacies.

We arrived at around 2, roughly and had to wait for around 2 minutes to get a seat. The seat was not at all private as it was one of them two seat table situated very close to each other. However, we were not that discontented as we knew that the food would be compensating for everything else.

We ordered Chicken Sicilene and Fish Wellington. The service is rather slow but that is accepted with the huge number of customers who were all very hungry. Finally, the food arrived and it looked rather delectable and we slurped on the cheesy white sauce. We both were very enthralled with the taste and started gorging on the dish. However, when I reached the fish, it tasted BAD. Plain BAD. It had a very bad smell and I couldn't, just could not take any more than one bite of the fish and to think of it, the fish constituted the whole dish. S, had chicken who thought the chicken would however be consumable. However, the chicken possessed a very awkward smell, very similar to the fish and seemed like it was stale food.

We both could not eat the main portion of the dish and just ate the sauce and the minimal amount of the vegetables that accompanied with the fish and the chicken respectively. 

The bill amounted to Rs 874/-, which not might not be a big sum of money if you have good food, however paying that much without eating the main ingredient of the dish, was quite a pain to us.

I am highly disappointed with today's serving of Mocambo and I would probably refrain from visiting it again.

After hearing all the heavenly praise about this place...finally found a chance to visit this place one Saturday eve. The place has beautiful ambience with Colonial feel.

The service is quick and the waiters were courteous. Ordered Chicken Paprika and Fish Al a Diana. Fish tasted amazingingly soft, just as you expect in a Bengali dish. The chicken was also good. Loved the plating. A must visit of you come to Calcutta.

Mocambo has been an old favourite when it comes to continental cuisine. Visited the place after a long time with high expectations and I was not disappointed! The restaurant exudes an unmatched old world charm. I would call it a 'heritage diner'. 

  We had ordered Prawn Cocktail and Devilled Crab to start with. The prawn cocktail was a little grainy while the Devilled crab was smooth & creamy with a fine mustard flavour. Next on our table was Chicken Pavlograd, Yorkshire Pork Chops and Chicken Orientele A La Mocambo. Pavlograd seemed a bit overloaded with butter but the Pork Chops were divine. Succulent meat on bone cooked to perfection and the veggies on the side complemented the smoky meat flavour. Chicken Orientele had the taste of the A La Kiev with a hint of sour tomato flavour. We had skipped the famed Baked Alaska and finished with Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream.

  The portions were good, the manager well spoken but the service has deteriorated a bit over time. It was pretty slow. We had to wait for almost half an hour for our first dish to arrive! Apart from this minor point Mocambo lived up to my expectation. Must visit place if heritage dining is in the mind.

So, finally it was mocambo that i thought of visiting after having read about it on zomato so much! The decor of the restaurant is similar to the peter cat's : like the hanging lamps over the tables, concept of both being same( same cuisine). 
Well, i had the cream of asparagus first! The soup was good enough in taste! Fish sizzler had the bekti fillet , beautifully marinated and cooked in white sauce ! This is definitely dish of the house! Delectable from every dimension! 
The next thing i ordered was chicken paprika! It was creamy chicken topped with chilli flakes and served with rice and baked potatoes! ( baked potatoes and steamed carrots are the sides for every dish, i suppose) few of the chicken chunks were a bit rubbery to chew ! The overall taste, though ,was commendable! 

The manager was really friendly but the waiter seemed quite funny to me, because he had less knowledge of the dish, than i did! And i was the one telling him ! Service was quick and i had a perfectly delicious lunch!

Oh Mocambo! You're my favourite!
This place never fails to make me happy. The food, the hospitality, the mood that it creates makes me go back to this place again and again. 
Prawn Cocktail, Mixed grill a la Mocambo, Fish Florentine, Fish A La Diana, Chicken Chipolata are my favourites. Cooked to perfection and they don't make you wait for long. 
With starters , main course and dessert expect the pocket pinch to be around 1500 w/o liquor.
Another great thing about this place is the crowd. All in all this is a one stop destination when you are celebrating with your close people who appreciate good food.

Didn't quite like the place at the first instance. Not happy with the service as well. You should know from before and decide what to eat and must order just that. Don't expect the waiters or even the manager to help you with something. Food,on the other hand, is much better than the ambience and the hospitality you expect to receive.

My favoritest joint in the park street area simply because of the perfect blend of fantastic food, variety in cuisine, warmth of ambience and availability of alcohol. On a typical visit i would order devilled crabs, pork cutlet, chicken a la kiev and a beer in the brass mug; would make a perfect lunch / dinner or date

My experience will be always the same, no matter how many times i visit Mocambo.
The very old charm of ParkStreet..Mocambo is keeping all the traditions of excellence! The ambience is smooth, elegant and brings solace to mind,And the warm behavior of the staffs will fill your heart!

Coming to the food - we ordered Rum Collins as our Mood rejuvinator.

The Prawn Cocktail and deviled crab was our choice of starters..we also ordered chicken cream soup. But somehow felt that the cocktail sauce is way more sweet.
"Mocambo khush kiya!"...borrowing a snatch from a famous villain dialogue from a popular Hindi film but that is what you may say after devouring their Devilled Crabs (as a starter), the softest crab flesh i've ever had! Tender crab flesh prepared with cheese & herbs.. melted in our mouth within a second!
My advice would be to go there once and no more, and to stick to the deviled crabs and the fish a la Diana. :)

Dessert was Tutti Fruitty IceCream and Meringue with Vanilla Ice Cream and Dark Chocolate Sauce...the Meringue was simply melt-in-mouth.

Recommended for those who care two hoots for calories and dig the passion for good gourmet.

If you are continental food lover then there is no place better than this. 
A perfect place for couples as preparation takes time and the ambience and environment gives you the best time of your life.
If you are here don't forget the devilled crab and Chicken tetrazzini. Both are just amazing and utterly delicious.
In vegetarians veg surprise is a great surprise for taste buds. In desert you should try souffle ala mocambo. I have heard the baked Alaska is also good so you may try that.
Its a place you can savour the food and go when relaxed and have time with you.
Food is fresh and that's the reason it takes time. Perfectly baked and cooked food with perfect blend of continental spices is what all I can say in few words.
A bit expensive place but a memorable experience of food.

Brilliant food. One of the best places to have continental - provided you are able to actually get a table without getting frustrated with the wait time and moving to other restaurants.

"Men may come men may go but I go on for ever" well this is what mocambo has to say to the foodies. There has been no dearth of restaurants and eating joints. Even more spring up with new concepts but none could sway the crowd that line up to enter this restaurant. The only thing thats stands tall here is the food quality to be precise. Be it sizzlers, prawn cocktail, deviled crabs or the baked alaska no where in the city you will get the equally matching stuff. Competition is just not existence for this restaurant. Finally it says " Mocambo khush hua " to all others.

Visited this joint yesterday to meet up some friends after office. All were in a mood for drinks so we ordered beer and since we were just 3 we opted for 2 starters . The ambiance is indeed quite peaceful and pleasant. Service was decent . The drinks were chilled and nice. Coming to the food we ordered

Fish banjara kebab 
Chicken reshmi kebab

The kebab were excellent specially fish banjara kebab. Prices were decent when it comes to drink but on a higher side when it came to food. Around 320 per kebab. The quantity was quite less when one takes the cost into consideration. 
A chilled out and nice place to hang out with family or friends to sum it up..

We had been to this place on a Christmas eve. Heard about this restaurant from parents and movies. Was marked against "Legendary" in Zomato. So being a foodie, we thought we should give a relief to our tastebuds here at our earliest.
In starters we had asked for Devilled Crab, which was lip smacking. I had always like crabmeat and this dish made me fall in love with crabmeat even again.
In the main course, we had ordered for Chicken Orientale A La Mocambo, since this dish was tagged as the most popular. Although I liked the dish very much, my partner didn't. However, Baked Alaska ordered at the end tasted pretty good. Would like to come again to taste the other dishes here, specially sizzlers.

I have been waiting to visit this place for a long time. Had heard lots about it but my experience yesterday was kind of disappointing.

Of course, for a restaurant of this scale, it had a great ambiance. Loved the seating, the hanging lamps.

Their service was good too. Prompt, efficient, quick- nothing to complain.

What really disappointed me was the food. I am not saying it was bad. It was good but we don't expect good from Mocambo, we expect great.

We ordered a Cream of Chicken Soup, a Chicken Orientale A La Mocambo and A Risotto with Chicken, Bacon, Ham and Mushroom. The soup, surprisingly, was served just a bit warm. A little bit warmer would be nice. Also, it lacked salt, completely.

The Chicken Orientale was good, but not up to the mark for Mocambo. Same goes for the Risotto.

The rice of the Chicken Orientale lacked the buttery taste. The chicken was good but the Boiled Egg really had no part to play in this dish.

The Risotto lacked flavor, plain and simple. From the description, a lot more flavors were expected.

All in all, it was an average experience. Maybe I am gonna return there one day to try more.

Mocambo is surely Kolkata's one of the best offerings. One simply cannot miss the mouth-watering Italian delights and desserts, specially Baked Alaska. The service is good. Located at the heart of Park Street, the ambiance gives you the true flavour of Kolkata's night life. Definitely one of my favourite restaurants of all time.

Went to Mocambo on my birthday, it was a Saturday. It was 8.30pm and the place was packed, luckily we got a seat for two in the corner. I had heard a lot about the restaurant so the expectation was quite high. The decor was colonial and lighting dim. We ordered pepper devilled crab for appetizer. The presentation of the dish was nice, (a gooey concoction in a crab shell) but all I could taste was cheese nd mushroom and very little crab meat. Then we ordered chicken cordon bleu. The portion size was huge, with massive amount of chicken, ham and cheese, taste was nothing special. Finally we ordered pork cutlet. To our surprise, it looked almost similar to chicken cordon bleu! The portion size was huge with pork stuffed with cheese. All we could taste was cheese and more cheese! Felt violated by cheese! Overall the experience was very average. Nothing but hype.

One of their speciality that I have taken up recently is their Devilled Crab. Being a crab lover I love their different approach in making this dish, and the cheese and my smile is almost synonymous. I have also tried their Chicken A La Kiev and their Sizzler and I cant complain. The décor is soothing and ideal for a quiet, simple meal with your dear ones. In fact I vividly remember my times spent here and it truly deserves a place in Kolkata's heritage provided they continue their service because I remember a not-so-good "controversy" about a soup they served.

But north indian is pretty bad.. I mean i had the worst Tandoori roti here priced at 40bucks each and a pretty tasteless Murg Masallam. It's my bad I should not have gone for Indian so this is just a warning from my end.

For a long long time it had been there in my long wish-list, finally I made my wish come true and brought it under my been there category.... Aaaahhhsss! Sometime I feel is there really any need to write a review for such a legendary restaurant ??!!

Everything is so perfect when you go inside and sit there. For a long time I was trying to figure out what are the differences it has with its noisy neighbour (Peter Cat), and I hardly found one or two. One of such is the wooden staircase and second is the legendary Chelo Kebab.

The Persian or Middle eastern dressed waiters are also missing here.

Food - Our order was simple and risk free. 1 Chicken A La Kiev, 1 Chicken Paprika, 1 Baked Alaska and 2 Soft Drinks. I felt the outer layer could have been thinner for the Chicken A La Kiev, rests were lip smackingly delicious. Chicken Paprika was the best according to me....buttered rice and Béchamel sauce prepared chicken was at its pin perfect best. Baked Alaska was good with ice cream, fruits and nuts in it but the burnt outer layer tasted a bit bitter. To be very frank Chicken a la kiev didn't stand out up to its high reputation for me, a plate full of liquid butter failed to make the outer coating juicy and tasty. It tasted blunt.

Service - It was good and quick and expertly handled. There was little space available to sit, we were two and thus we were lucky to get a place to sit. There were most probably only two seats available which we occupied. Attendants were expert and guided us properly to our seats. Order was taken quickly and also they suggested and helped me to place my orders.

Ambiance - Same like Peter Cat this eating place also brings you the flavour of old Kolkata, 70's or 60's days peep out through the cozy sitting, suspended lamps and underneath carpet. Nothing new, nothing special but the place was buzzing on the Sunday afternoon. That's the charm…

Definitely a second, third, fourth .........nth visit would be equally good and worthy. I am looking forward to taste their sizzler and tandoor next time.

Mocambo sizzlers!..*sigh*.. Makes me drool over them. This time wanted to have something unconventional. So ordered only a chicken steak sizzler and chicken orientale a la mocambo. The latter was rice along with a chicken n mushroom curry topped with diced boiled eggs. Oh my! It was sheer awesomeness!! We were two of us and we just couldn't have enough of the food. We were almost full when we decided to try out the chicken milanaise (the ingredients were quite appealing). Another treat to the taste buds! How can they make such good food?! The waiters were very warm and friendly. This delightful experience was for only 1700 bucks.
P. S. We had a pint of beer, a screwdriver and a small vodka too. So I guess, my stomach and my pocket were both dancing with joy :)

Writing about this place is making me really nostalgic. Childhood memories aplenty rushing back to me. Mocambo and I go back a long way. This used to be my favorite place for a very very long time. We all have that one place where we know the menu at the back of our hand, the order is decided even before setting step into the place and our taste buds are tingled each and every time quite remarkably just like the previous times. This is the place where i first realized FOOD is HAPPINESS. The ambiance of the place has really remained unchanged over the years and i am certainly not complaining. Iv loved their setting always. The hung dim lights, the comfortable sofas and the whole feel of the place. The service may have declined over the years but still is decent enough. Now the reason why I, my family and a host of other people keep going back to Mocambo is their food. It really was unparalleled and their signature dishes still cant be had elsewhere. My family order usually comprises of Prawn Cocktail and fish fingers for starters. Fish Florentine, Chicken ala kiev, Sizzlers, and Devilled crab for main course. This is followed by Tutty Fruity for desert. All of them absolutely delicious. I really have to revisit this place soon.

A place where you would go for a great continental dinner/lunch. It is towards the old park street and ambiance is similar. Cozy leather couches, fantastic food, spacious enough for maintaining privacy..ideal for a nice date. The service is fair enough. If you have a liking towards cheese in your food, this is the place. Go out and enjoy the time while you are there.

Friday night rendezvous.

We were half expecting the place to be packed like last time but we were pleasantly surprised. We had the fish a la Diana. 5/5. We had the chicken Firdausi. 4.5/5. And also the mocambo special sizzler. It was delicious too. And they serve the beverages in those metal mugs from the medieval which just adds to the charm. Recommended for a fun evening with friends.

Visited this place 3-4 weeks back with the family. I had this restro on the wish list but after reading through all the ravishing reviews it was time to check out this place. The decor the ambiance really gives the old nostalgic feel.

To start off and the much reviewed one, prawn cocktail and deviled crab. Prawn cocktail so far the best in Kolkata, devilled crab too good. Chicken Ala keiv, you will have it to surprise you. Angels on the horse back is lovely and finally chicken tetranizinni, you will simply love it.

In terms of the service, it is equally good. A really good place for good food with the family.

Having heard a lot about Mocambo since childhood, as being one of the favourite restaurants of all Calcuttans, and having lived in Calcutta for most of my life, I was a little embarrassed to admit that I had never been there till now. Nevertheless, I was delighted to enter a restaurant which surely looked grand in its appearance, palatial and ancient yet taken good care of. We decided to order Pepper Devilled Crabs, which we had heard praises of, and Chicken Tetrazzini, which was known among all I know, as one of the must-have dishes at this restaurant, and we were far from disappointed. While the chicken tetrazzini melted in our mouths, to infuse our senses with the taste of heaven, as we scooped spoonfuls of it after breaking the crust on top, the Pepper Devilled Crab was crab meat cooked like nowhere else. It was just the right blend of pepper, sourness, sweetness with the goodness of cheese, and I was scraping the shell for just a little more, long after I had finished it off. Chicken Paprika, while being definitely good, did not match up to the high standards set by the other two dishes. However, we were delighted with the experience that this restaurant gave us, and will surely pay more visits to it in the future :)

Continental food are great if prepared the right way. It is very rare to find proper continental food but if you are in Kolkata, it isn't an issue. Mocambo is the perfect choice for you. I would suggest everyone to try the "chicken A' la kiev" and "lobster Augustine". Kolkata has never disappointed me when it comes to food.

Was here on a wednesday evening. However, the place was jampacked as if it was a weekend! We were on a italian spree so can't comment on other cuisines. Their Meat Lazane is out of this world. You guys should try it. I would rate food five on five. Only problem with this place is the huge gap between the order and serving time which is very annoying if you aren't someone who like to wait.

Mocambo is quite an old name in the parkstreet restuarent competition. Its food is quite good no doubt. But the decor is not very impressive. The tables are too close for comfort. And the lighting is too dim at times to be of comfort.
That being said, its cheaper than most restros in those area and its sizzlers are definitely amazing. So if you dont mind standing in the queue for a while you can surely give it a try.

This place is outright funny! The people here would rather make you stand on the road waiting for your friends than in their empty restaurant on a weekday (Thursday)....that defies even basic courtesy for women, forget a gourmet restaurant etiquette! Well, I guess the management isn't too concerned about losing out on large groups and the bad word of mouth that follows.Guys running Mocambo, Park Street in Calcutta is not the end of the world. Please arrange some basic etiquette lessons for your staff...the joints near you serve better food and yet are humble enough.And people going to eat here, please do not enter (the empty restaurant on a weekday) if all your patrons haven't arrived, you'll be in for a rude shock.

"First give us the pepper deviled crab. we will order the mains soon" is how I always start at Mocambo!! The pepper deviled crab is a must have. The mix of sweet crab meat, spicy chili and creamy white sauce equals pure satisfaction. The menu here is an enigma to me. No matter what I order it never runs out of more interesting things to consider. The chicken terazini, spahhetti carbonara, chicken cordon bleu, fish a la diane, vetki muniere, chicken paprika, chicken a la kiev, pork chops, beef steak....see how I can go on and on and on about my favourite things!! Apart from the deviled crab I can not decide on one favorite here. One thing that bugs me are the portions cause I never seem to get enough.
The staff are good here and consistent unlike there sister establishment Peter Cat. 
Mocambo is like those family heirlooms passed down through generations. I hear my parents fond memories from their visits and my children will probably here similar stories from me.

I took my family on lunch recently here, and to the surprise it was a hit. Ambience was good, comfort sitting with good music.

We ordered mix and match of traditional food. Spine less hilsa wih sauce with fried rice and fish steak with chicken biryani. The quality of food was excellent. Fish steak is delicious and is a must to try  for anyone. Hilsa was good to taste but had a little raw stink. I look forward to dine in here again soon. Overall a good experience.

The hanging orange lamp shades and the whole ambiance will give you an old calcuttan feel. The Best-est crab starter is here in Mocambo Devilled Crab. The cheese oozing out from the platter is just mouthwatering!!! OMG!! Another starter I can suggest for the fish lovers , Mushroom garlic prawn(a perpect blend of garlic n mushroom with spices).
For main course,we ordered Chicken paprika(a platter of chicken with chilli pepper flakes and red pepper served with rice),Chicken A La Kiev a must try for all the foodies( brace yourself with the chicken steaks in butter),Fish A La Diana  (Beckty stuffed in prawn with creamy sauce).
We didn't order any dessert so that it can not have an over empowering effect on the amazing platter we just had.
The service was brilliant and the food was worth every penny..

Kolkata is the best place in this country for food. Mocambo is one of the best places in the city for continental "cheesy" food. Old British style red interiors, old furniture, old staff and great food. Vegetarians will be disappointed by lack of abundant choice. Try out Veg Cannelloni - it is out of the world. Generic advise - do not try sizzlers in Kolkata - including Mocambo. The service is slow and do not expect to get awed by the same.

According to me you get the bestest Chicken Ala Kiev here in Mocambo!!! OMG the butter oozing out of the kiev is so ambrosial!!! The way the preparation is done is simply superb and worth every penny. The consistency the restaurant has maintained over so many years is a commendable job. Remember going there with my parents as a kid and now going there with friends and hubby. The taste lingers on and makes me crave for more more & more of the Chicken Ala Kiev. It maintains the ambiance of the sixties and that old Calcutta feel even today. One of the best place to try out continental dishes in the city. A must visit place for foodies.

Let me describe in Bollywood style how I feel everytime after my meal in Mocambo is done --- "Dil Garden Garden Ho Gaya".

Hands down the BEST-EST(cannot stress enough) Continental Food in Kolkata (which doesn't belong to a 5-star hotel). Let me tell you the perfect menu for a special dinner/lunch.

Starters -- Devilled Crab , for those with a spicy taste, have the Peppered Devilled Crab. (Do not have much starters, as the upcoming main menu is to take by storm)

For Poultry lovers : Angels on Horseback/ Chicken Pavlogard/ Chicken A-la-kiev/ Chicken Supreme / Chicken Imperial is what you should try!

For Fish lovers: Fish A-la-Diana/ Fish Florentine/ Fish a-la- Moutarde is all you need.

For Red Meat lovers: Irish Chateaubriand beef Steak(definitely with mushroom sauce) / Mutton Hamburger Steak(in sizzler) / Yorkshire Pork Chops will cover it all.

For the Clawing delight -- Lobster Thermidor / Surf & turf/ Lobster Augustine is amazing!!

For the Grill Sizzler specials -- Chicken chipolata / Mixed a-la-mocambo / Tandoori Mixed grill should satiate your needs.

For the sweet tooth -- Their Baked Alaska is Awesome!! Try also the Merigue and Souffle. Never have a chocolate dessert that will have an over-empowering effect on the amazing Food you just had.

Bon Apetite!!
            

Changing the rating -- Reasons -- Behavior of the staff -- The awesome food do make us ignore the ignorant and snobbish behavior of the staff but sometimes, the ambiance and the environment makes it up for bad food as well. We expect the behavior of the staff to change and make everyone at their door feel special in a good way. It is never too late. Once, rectified , my rating for them will be increased again. Nothing can replace kind words and happy smiles.

One of the best places to have continental food in town and it has maintained tge same standard over the years. I remember visiting the place when I was small with parents the ambiance is the same.. it can be called old world charm. these truly falls the legendary category.. the food is brilliant be it chicken tetrazini or fish florentine or fish and chips which is a very popular dish or chicken ala kiev to name a few.. each and every dish is worth trying.. not to mention the awesome caramel custard. . mocambo will always be a favourite eatery for people who love food..

Wow! I remember this place from my school days and chose to review this specially for the 200th time on Zomato! A brilliant place off the main road on Park Street, this cute place is one that has been a favorite to me since time immemorial!
The red coloured lamp shades above each table gives this place a vibrancy, where you feel the urge to eat, drink and yap away!
The waiting here is quite an issue on weekends but it's worth the wait. Once you are inside, the uniformed waiters are busy nagging you on in your order and even recommending what's good to eat.
They have a really wide array to select from. The fish and chips is a hot favorite for me. You get continental food, great finger snacks, all the booze you want and then if you want the dinner in mughlai, it's there!
The crowd here is good, a mix of youngsters and middle aged both. It's a typical mix in ambience of the post British era and the Bengali culture that gives this dining place a distinct touch. 
The service is good and they do manage a big crowd pretty well too. If you go here with your romantic half (!), and manage to find a small 2 seater table to yourselves in a remote corner, your evening is done with its ample opportunity for romance!
The menu offers a good balance of vegetarian and non-veg options. Fish fries, golden fried chicken drumsticks, pastas, steaks etc. they have it all!
So fellas, if you do visit Kolkata, ask your cabbie to bring you to Park Street and ask any tom, dick and prick where Mocambo is. You'll land up here in 2 minutes flat from you are. Come, drink, eat, enjoy the evening at this great cosy place. You will love to live it! Cheers!

For me Mocambo is one of the 3 Musketeers of Park Street.
There are very few dishes which are left to be tried at Mocambo, over the years.
My favourite appetizer is definitely the Devilled crab.
When it comes to the main course, Mocambo is THE place to be to have steaks made to the perfection.
I think I’d never get bored of the Surf and Turf and the Irish Chateaubriand Beef Steak sizzler.
The amazing steak, the mouthwatering sauce, the delish veggies, all are just too wow.
I think it’s mandatory to have the Baked Alaska every time I visit Mocambo. Overall, this is one of my favourite eateries in the city.

The Ilish was good in taste generally but not as normal biriyani . Guys who dint love fish please dont try this. The Bhapa ilish was just awesome (*****). We also had Doi( curd) ilish. It was ok. Service was excellent and ibthink they can increase the fish amount in their offerings . Overall 3.5 stars..

Possibly the best Italian one can have in Calcutta. Loved the cannelloni and paneer chilli. Lasagne was satisfactory. The ambience is perfect. Just that I don't like the service there. All waiters are aged,  not good at serving. You for once feel bad to get harsh on them. I've been there 5 times, and same was the case each time. Except for the service part, the experience is GODLY.

When I was growing up, our family fine dining stop was usually this restaurant. So my review would be partial and emotional. I went back with some friends from out of town and their feedback is crucial to this review. The food is good, but has been tuned to the Bengali palette, some dishes are definitely sweeter than it needs to be. However as a dining experience, it's like turning the clock back to the golden age of restaurants in Kolkata. Needless to say, it's definitely worth a visit.

Mocambo, Park Street, Kolkata

Visiting Kolkata and not stepping into the legendary restaurants of Park street is sheer waste. Our No 1 itinerary was Mocambo and visiting the same would make us “ Khush Hua”. So on Thursday, 3rd July after Natak (Bong Play) at the academy of Fine Arts we proceeded to Mocambo for dinner.

Mocambo was, in fact, independent India’s first nightclub, where a 17-year-old chanteuse named Pam Crain belted out numbers with a six-piece band led by Anton Menezes. The standards set by the restaurant can be judged from Kothari’s words: “A German architect designed the interiors and my dad got an Italian chef flown down to design the menu. Kitty Bryanan, a British fashion designer, made the dresses that Pam Crain used to wear at Mocambo—they were mermaid-like, flared at the bottom—while the dance floor was of reinforced glass imported from Belgium, with coloured psychedelic lights below. Only the crème de la crème would dine there, and dinner jackets were mandatory.” Our visit to this iconic place was like pilgrimage to Calcutta, we knew!
We were greeted by the door man with a salute and were ushered into the end corner 5 seater which I noticed is still the bright red non leather curved type sofa. Waiters wearing the same white uniform and the place had the air of a long gone era with crowds of people asking for the same favourites. The place was filled in and I felt a tinge of nostalgia.

We were hungry so we got down to brass tacks and ordered from the menu. My father in law ordered a Fish (Bhetki) Steak Sizzler at Rs. 360/- and a Tuborg pint, My brother in law ordered a Beef steak at rs. 348/- with 2 large blenders pride, My sister in law ordered a Bloody Mary with an Irish Beak Steak at Rs.348/- and my wife ordered a Bloody Mary with a Fish( Bhetki) Florentine at Rs.355/-  . I settled for a mixed grill Sizzler at Rs. 360/- with a Large Absolut Vodka with tonic water. I was footing the bill and had steeled myself to a 10k bill as it would have happened in aamchi Mumbai.

The Bloody Mary was authentic with a tinge of tabasco so subtle that the drink felt more like Tomato juice. This was the best bloody Mary in a long time. Food was served in 20 minutes which saw us thru loads of gossip and discussion. My Mixed Grill had a poached egg perched on the top of the sizzling meats which consisted of Chicken sausage, chicken breast, Mutton was restricted to the liver and lots of vegetables. Considering almost 95% was chicken I wondered what would the difference be with a Chicken Grill? Taste was fine but the meats and sizzlers clearly lost their sizzle. This was the clearly the ultimate sunset of all things continental that Calcutta stood for. I was dismayed!!! The Vodka and tonic water tasted the way I wanted. My Father in laws Fish sizzler was yummy and exactly the way all things fish were served in the by gone era. My wife’s Fish Florentine was baked and had the taste of baked fish as good as possible. My Brother in laws Beak steak was not a tenderloin or sirloin but a chunk of beef smashed good with a malette, well done, juicy, not too burnt and the vegetables lovely. Sister in Laws Irish Beef was similar by looks to the Beef Steak with chunk of meat and boiled vegetables. So what’s the hullabaloo about? Kya Mocambo Khush Hua!!!

Clearly Mocambo had come to age and it was time for a change over or shake out. I know I am stepping on many die hard Bong toes but the truth is Kolkata is in reality History in the modern world.

Desserts were once again a shocker as we ordered a chocolate soufflé at Rs. 133/-, Cream Caramel at Rs. 118/- and the piece de resistance – Mango Alaska at Rs.159/- . Every single dessert took us back to circa 1945 where desserts were worth giving your life for!! The Flambé performance by the waiters Fantastic!  My pictures will speak better than words. The total tab was Rs.4797/- a major shocker!

In a nutshell how do I describe my experience – Mocambo is struggling to keep afloat with its unbelievable miniscule prices. The rates/prices were incredibly Kolkata – Poor where the people continued acted like the bourgeois but kept the tab sharply socialistic. I do declare I liked it with fond memories but clearly …………………….

Ambience – 7/10 cosy, warm, merry, upmarket

Menu – 6/10 Excellent Italia and Continental  

Taste – 7/10 Some were good and some lost to the bygone era

Customer Service – 6/10  waiters were far too old, cheeky and rigid

Value for Money – 12/10 Shockingly under priced

Recommend – Worth the Historic visit along with the Victoria memorial!!

Well this  was one restaurant which was brought into the limelight due to my favourite movie Kahaani where Mrs Breganza invites Mrs Bakshi ( Vidya Balan). 
Now lets decide whether its Value for Money or not.
Jumping directly on the food I must say its delicious to say the very least. They serve both North Indian and Continental. Talking about N.Indian food first because I had  that more out there, I must say food is good. Wouldn't say excellent because the variety is a bit limited for vegetarians but it shouldn't be seen as its limitation that should keep you away from it, 

Continental is its strongpoints which I do recommend you to have , Lasagne is an all time favourite.
Coming to Deserts , its often seen that restaurants serving Indian food don't have such good deserts. But the case is different out here, the deserts are mouthwateringly delicious and ensure that you keep sufficient space in your stomachs to  try the variety of its deserts. 
So is it value for money or not ?? Ofcourse yes, and if you are non-vegetarian you are in for a treat.

Park Street has been the scene of party goers, merry makers and gourmets in Kolkata for decades. It boasts to have some of the best restaurants in the city, with great ambiance and great food. Mocambo is certainly one of the best restaurants in Park Street and adjoining areas The ambiance at Mocambo wore a very classy English touch which replicated the 1956 AD established British Calcutta. The lighting(hanging red lampshades) was soft and adequate. I so loved the Chicken A La Kiev and the Deviled crab. This dish Chicken A La Kiev will just bowl you over. A huge deep fried grenade of chicken served in a bed of mashed potatoes. The grenade is full of tender chicken braised in butter. It’s served hot, so when you cut open the grenade the molten butter oozes out. Gives you a heavenly feeling altogether. Chicken tetrazinni and Chicken Milanaise are other dishes one must try.The waiters were very attentive and it had a cosy atmosphere I would thoroughly recommend it to any Calcutta visitors or indeed Calcutta residents. Mocambo the name itself sounds pretty weird  to state so. Reminds one of the punch lines ’’MOGAMBO KHUSH HUA’’ of Amresh Puri in a very popular Bollywood potboiler.Yeah main toh bohut KHUSH HUA :)

Mocambo was in my wish list since my last visit to Kolkata. Later, the movie Lootera fastened my visit to Mocambo when I reach I Kolkata second time. The decor is really good with simplicity. But the waiting time for food is a bit too much and also service people are not that keen to attend the table. Food is delicious as we all expect from this place. I've tried one pork steak, and two other dishes from continental section (chicken and fish). 

Highly recommended if you ate in Kolkata!

This restaurant is a paradise for sea food lovers,with a wide variety of Crab,lobster and prawn cuisines.I had heard a lot about this place before I visited .It happens to be one of the most sought after old restaurant located in park street.the ambiance is soothing and gives you a vintage feel.
The hanging orange lamps and comfy couched seats with the bar section at one corner provides you a sense of privacy midst the extensive crowd. Now that's cozy It was great to witness the waiters dressed up in an uniform,most of them very senior,which means the restaurant has preserved their loyal staffs.
We ordered a Chinese chicken and sausage cock-tail as starter..it was mouth watering..the sausage melts in our mouth .
Then we ordered  devil crab/pepper crab.This was one delicious dish one should definitely try.
Its was  lasagna  style combo of cheese,crab ,mushrooms and loads of cream..

The only thing they can improve is the quality of glasses in which they serve water.it was clean but very basic dhaba style..

Look forward to visit again to try some more dishes. :) :) :)

One of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata, located on Park Street, it exudes old world charm. The ambience and lighting is beautiful and service is smooth. It is almost always packed and you have to wait sometime to get seated. I've tried almost everything on the menu, as I've been going there since I was a child. The prawn cocktails, chicken ala kiev, mixed grill sizzler, chicken chipolata, and chicken tetrazzinni are my favourites. The food is mind blowing and I keep going back to Mocambo.

This is my first restaurant visit in in the food crazy town of Kolkata. Seriously awesome place if you are foodie

Coming to Mocambo, located at the amazing park street, this place is a class apart. Even though we had to wait for like an hour to get in, it was worth the wait. Beautifully architectured and designed. It had a dark kinda ambience with the overhanging lamps. Nice seating arrangements with courteous management to take care of your needs. Amazing m/.

We started with a Prawn Cocktail and drink and those prawns were just amazing. Nice rich creamy sauce and prawn dipped in it was just mind blowing. Next each one of us ordered separate dishes. It was a long time ago so i seriously don't remember each of the dish names. Though looking at menu i remembered mine - it was Chicken Sicilliene. The chicken and cheese combo was so delicious. Being a cheese fan, i always love when the dish is baked in cheese. The amount of cheese oozing from and around the chicken made the whole dish just too good. 

I would definitely suggest all the foodies to go to this place to try out some unique dishes and enjoy the flavours of kolkata

Cheers !!

One of the best fine dine places I've ever been to. The fish delicacies were exquisite. We had fish wellington and fish a la moutarde. They were very well prepared and appropriately garnished. Even the interiors added to the mood. But only thing that stopped me from rating it 4.5 star was the insistence of the waiters who asked us to leave shortly after we had paid the bill. Still I would love to come back to this place.

A visit to the food capital of India - Kolkata would be incomplete without a visit to Mocambo. Located in the heart of city at park street the place boasts of some delicious food, ambience and crowd. This was my 3rd visit to the place in last 1 year and this time I ordered spaghetti carbonara , fish florentine, Greek drunken prawns and mango soufflé. The carbonara must say was Out of the world. The cheese cream sauce with the spicy bacon was just ohh la la. Fish florentine was a classic too. As I write this review my mouth is watering again. Must must visit.

Ambience - The first time you step in, you'll feel warm and welcomed. The Orange fall colors with the lanterns have a certain charm that makes you wanna come here again and the aroma of the amazing food in the air can make your foodlust go wild. 

Service - Considering the fat crowd of foodies our food came quite fast, in about 9-10 minutes. The waiters were polite and served us (upon request) our meal. 

Food: The food is what makes it an amazing eatery particularly the wide range of non-vegetarian dishes. When you see your food coming to your table you know it's going to be amazing. And when you taste it - you get exactly what you wanted.

3 years in Kolkata and I never visited this place; it was a regret I wasn't going to let linger. On a separate visit to Kolkata years later, the wife and I decided to finally visit the legendary 'Mocambo on Park Street'. No points for guessing what we had, there. I will forever remember the night we had the two portions of Devilled Crab (no sharing this) and one portion of Chicken A La Kiev. Eating any more would be an insult to what we'd just had. 'Nuff said.

All in all
Food - 5/5
Service - 4.5/5
Ambience - 5/5 (Classic !)
Value for money - 3.5/5 (Kolkata'r standards onujayi)

Suddenly we planned to have platters and sizzler and friend of mine suggested Mocambo.
We booked a table of 6, had to wait for around half an hour, though it was Sunday evening. A waiter came, he described each food very thoroughly, suggested few fish dishes for one of us. The ambience is nice without too much noise.

We ordered 2 platters, 1 chicken sizzler, 1 fish sizzler, 2 mutton sizzler and a fish la diane. This was the best mutton sizzler I have ever had. The food was brilliant. We ordered Baked Alaska for desert. It did burn a little more, because we were too busy enjoying the flame in the food.

Overall a very nice restaurant in the heart of Kolkata. Even the price is not so high.


Edit- After hearing that Mocambo didnt allow a person with her driver because of no one knows what reason (or maybe because of the fake class) i am going to rate 1. I am not coming here again and I will not advise anyone to visit this place.

Visited Mocambo, after so many days, and it was raining. Drowned in nostalgia, we entered. Thankfully didn't have to wait too long for a seat and in around 5 minutes we were comfortably placed in the soft couches underneath those iconic lamps. We started off with a pair of Budweiser and ordered some Fish meuniere and Chicken Sizzler as sides.

Coming to the food, the meuniere  was heavenly in every sense of the word. Soft, juicy and mellow with lot's of creamy butter rich gravy. The kind of food, you can't stop having once you had it. Totally living up to the reputation. 

The sizzler being a speciality came after sometime, sizzling it's way to glory. The hot mushroom sauce and the chicken steak with baked potatoes created an irresistible temptation that was divine.  We took some time, and basked ourselves to the delightful flavours. The tangy sauce with the juicy chicken packed the right flavours, a very happy phase of gluttony. Will definitely come back soonest.

Visited Mocambo with my brothers for a quick lunch and ordered Chicken Tetrazzini, Mixed Grill and Beef Sizzler along with a few beers.

The Tetrazinni was well made. The beef was a bit chewy but tasty. Tried their famous Baked Alaska for dessert and it is really a stand out dish which one must try when dining at Mocambo. Over all a good experience once again. 

***Update 14Aug2016***

                You know a restaurant is popular when it has more than 490 reviews, almost all of your friends 
recommend it and quite a few swear by it, there is not much that you can add by writing a review for a restaurant which is already a legend for a couple of generations or more. 

Located almost at the heart of Park Street,  Mocambo is a must go restaurant for each and every foodie in Kolkata. Interestingly it is a favoured place for going on business lunches for clients coming from Bangalore to Britain ! I have visited Mocambo several times but never thought of reviewing it as unfortunately it has not been able to impress to that extent. Definitely it is a great place to dine out but not the best when all the avenues are taken into account. 

Ambiance: Enter the restaurant and you will be teleported directly into the 60s or 70s. The antique furnishing is reminiscent of the 60s american-italian diners. I went here once dressed in a formal suit and I felt like a Gangster from the Godfather movie :P

Coming back to the present, I visited Mocambo last weekend after quite some time and tried a variety of items. We tried cream of corn and chicken soup, Fish Meuniere and Chicken Tandoori. The soup was light and creamy but tasted great after adding a bit of pepper. The fish meuniere ia a personal favourite and it was really well made last weekend. A bland creamy white sauce based fish appetizer. Perfect to start off your meal. The tandoori Chicken was not that great, very average. 
Next we asked the waiter to suggest a non veg starter which is a specialty. The waiter suggested some Kebab, the name of which i dont recollect but it was an absolute disaster. There was hardly any chicken in it and tasted almost like a veg hara bhara kebab. Next up, I ordered a Chicken Ala Kiev which arrived after 40 minutes of ordering. I agree it was a Sunday evening but I have a strong feeling that the order went to the kitchen at least 20 mins after we initially asked for it. The ala kiev was equally served by the waiter and it did taste yumm. Last time when I tried the Ala Kiev here it did not taste up to the mark. Though a bit over priced (approximately Rs 275 for one piece), it restored my faith in Mocambo Ala kiev :) 

For dinner my friends ordered Butter naan, Chicken Bharta and I ordered a Chicken Stroganoff. The chicken stroganoff was a delight. A platter of light creamy baked chicken served with buttered rice and vegetables. I loved the smell and taste of baked chicken along with rice. I have tasted better stroganoff but this one was quite delicious. I did not taste the chicken bharta so cannot comment. According to my friends the naan and chicken Bharta was average, nothing spectacular. 

On previous visits to Mocambo, I have tried the chicken tetrazzini and it was decent, once it was a bit watery. I have also tried their sizzlers but Peter cat wins hands down when it comes to the taste and consistency of the taste and quality of sizzlers.  

Yes, we had drinks as well. Alcohol is priced as per Park Street standard. Its better to stick to one or two beers. My friend ordered for a Gimlet and it was nothing to write home about. 

Conclusion: Mocambo for a lot of people is one of the best restaurants in Park Street, I agree it is but they are inconsistent and few items are a bit over priced and over rated. Service is good usually and waiters are polite and respond to your calls almost immediately. With a range of mixed experiences over the past few visits, I would rate Mocambo 3.5

What can I say about this place??? Its there since the time my family started taking me to restaurants when I was a kid (early 80's). And I still visit this place whenever I come to Kolkata (I work in Delhi now). Its the best continental food I have had anywhere in India. Their menu is a class apart. Baked or grilled, everything is perfect. And each dish is sufficient for 1 person. I have tried almost every continental dish available on their menu, and each of them is simply too good. I live in Delhi and have visited so many continental restaurants out there, but nothing comes close to Mocambo. And the price is so reasonable. 

I have never tried their Indian dishes, so I wont comment on that.

If you are visiting Kolkata, this place is a must visit. My favourites are prawn cocktail, Devilled crab, fish ala Diana, Chicken Imperial, Cordon Bleu, Chciken tetrazzini, Fish Florentine, Chicken Supreme....its endless...

Dress up and go visit this place.

One of the two restaurants I had given a perfect 5 rating till date. however, given their recent inhuman and discriminative behaviour, I shall never visit them again. you have lost me as a customer.
http://www.vagabomb.com/Kolkata-Restaurant-Mocambo-Refuses-to-Serve-Customer-Her-Roadsider-Driver/


Below is my original review.
and So far, this is the only restaurant I've given a perfect 5. This restaurant has every element that defines a perfect restaurant.
The food is simply out of the world. The waiters are well informed and can make good recommendations on the dishes to order. And surprisingly the alcohol is very fairly priced. The decors are quite old fashioned and give it a vintage touch (think godfather).
The only negative is that they do not accept reservations and you will often see people waiting outside, sometimes up to an hour as well. But to me this adds to the dining experience. This forces you to reach the restaurant before dinner time at probably 7pm, grab couple of drinks and then proceed to dinner. On the whole giving you a good 3 hour dining experience.
This is one place you should not miss if you visit Kolkata

In one word, one of the best restaurants in Kolkata where you will have to wait no matter when you drop by. A restaurant which carries decades of history along with it. Ambience good, dimly lit. Service ok, maybe because of the huge number of people to be served is a little slow. But thats something one doesnt mind when you come here with friends and want your sweet time together, Food I would say is fantastic. The steaks, The sizzlers all are good. My favourite, chicken steak in mushroom sauce.

Took a lot of time and effort to visit this place first time. But once I got the taste of the blood it has turned into my favorite place to have continental food in Kolkata. If you get a place fast enough then the food is to be savored for long. From the menu Prawn Cocktail, Chicken steak and fish Florentine are my favorites.

Cheesiest, creamiest, most delicious Italian food. The staff is very friendly too. Park street has a bad reputation for not wanting to serve alcohol to all gi groups... But one day, I was alone and waited for a friend who was 45 mins late and the staff was extremely sweet and served me my drink(s) and kept refilling my chanachur bowl.

After a long plan I went there finally.First of all I loved the old British ambience.Their reception is good.and finally the food.....wow, simply wow..We ordered chicken ala kiev, chicken tetraginie, chicken ala mocambo....all are very good.It is a place which justify the proverb 'the easiest way to win one's heart is through his stomach'....
p.s. I personally did experience a very good hospitality from them. But I strictly don't support the behavior they did with that guy.

Mocambo, being one of the oldest and heritage restuarants in the City Of Joy, has been quite of a brand name since long ....... Its one of the best options u can have if u r a fan of continental dishes .......not many restuarants would give u so much variety  in continental food as this one ....... Being situated in the posh area around Park Street , its quite crowded in weekends ..... for dinner, u might have to wait outside for 40-45 min. approx ,or may even 1 hr if u r not going with our family ( or going in a boyz only grp)  in weekends ...... 
Speaking of staff behaviour, its quite professional ..... waiters are dressed quite traditionally .....the ambience along with the lighting inside is quite cozy with plush red seats .......
Talking about food ..... i have tried chicken tetrazinni .... the problem i find with continental dishes is that they pour excessive cheese in most of their items ...... so, not being a lover of continental dishes, i would say i didn't like it that much ...maybe a true continental lover would say otherwise ............ Have tried sizzlers , the fish sizzler is quite good in taste i would say ....... Among the italian dishes, i have tried mixed meat risotto ...which i liked quite much ...... its just that the quantity i found is very less .......
Being one of the best options for continental dishes in the city, pricing as expected is on the higher side ...specially considering the fact that quantity is less ...... so if u r a big foodie and want to have your stomach full , u would have to order quite a number of items thereby burning the hole in your pocket bigger and bigger .....  :)

It is currently counted in Kolkata's one of the heritage restaurents. The ambience, decoration everything is good, not changed for a long time. the service is a bit slow, may be due to crowd. regarding food i have tried here chelo kabab, fish sizzler, chicken sizzler, chicken tetrazeni, mixed meat risotto. sizzler is very very good, one of the best in kolkata. chelo kabab n risotto is also good, but risotto quantity is quite less compared to price. tetrazeni was quite traditional. in general, food quality is very good, though the price is on the higher side...
but the major point to note is if someone wants to visit here on weekends after 7 pm, must add almost 1 hour waiting time in his estimation. the crowd is mainly gathered to feel the heritage over the taste...

Three big eaters and one pansy went to Mocambo today (the pansy being a vegetarian obviously) and ordered for the following:


Deviled crabs: this dish was highly recommended by zomato users but I found it to be overrated. I found it to be too cheesy which wouldn't have been a bad thing had the cheese not completely overpowered the subtle flavors of the crab.



Veg lasagna: undoubtedly the best vegetarian dish served here. Far from the authentic Italian lasagna but very good nonetheless. Even though I'm a carnivore I wouldn't mind eating it.



Chicken paprika: the best dish of the evening (and the best dish I have had in mocambo so far), tender pieces of chicken in a creamy sauce with hints of paprika and served with rice and standard mocambo accompaniments like potatoes and carrots - the stuff legends are made of.



Oriental chicken a la mocambo - another brilliant dish. Chicken with oriental flavors on a bed of rice with mushrooms - it doesn't get much better than this. All in all a very balanced dish which does not clog up your arteries (unlike most dishes served here)

Ham steak - thick slice of ham cooked to perfection with jus and caramelized onions, again very nice.


Mother of all risottos - the risottos here are cooked with basmati rice. This one was cooked with chicken, bacon and mushrooms. It was good but I prefer the standard, rich risotto cooked with arborio or carnaroli rice.


Tutti fruity- the quality of the ice cream in the tutti fruity was very nice and creamy but I think their selection of fruits was wrong. It included apples and bananas but no pineapple. I personally prefer my tutti fruity with canned pineapple only (like the one you get at barbecue). It wasn't bad but I prefer their creme caramel.


Apart from the food we had ordered for two kingfisher beers and two fresh lime sodas and the bill came up for Rs. 2909. Not too expensive for the quality and the amount of food that was served. On the basis of today's experience, I would rate it at 4.

As i sit down to write this review,im flooded with memories of my countless visits to this heritage joint....my last visit being ystrday..as usual,despite it being a weekday,we had to wait...that itself goes to show how popular mocambo is...
As we were ushered in,the all too familiar decor,the noisy atmosphere,smokey sizzlers and turbanned waiters-i felt at home...we ordered our staple off-the-menu starter--- chicken meuniere....its the perfect start to a continental meal i feel...bland and creamy,it sets the mood for the gastonomic delights that follow...the chicken siciliene,garlic chicken steak, chicken orientale were all great..in fact iv tried most of their menu,and each dish surpasses the next...be it the ala kiev, the chipolata,imperial or tetrazzini...in short,for authentic continental fare,this is THE place in kolkata.. 
For those lookin for something differnt, they also serve pretty good indian(palak paneer) and italian(risotto)..
Desserts are pretty ordinary though...souffle,creme caramel,meringue....u may try the baked alaska for some novelty...
Service is sometimes a bit slow but all in all this is a must visit...I came to know they r expanding the resto and im sure this is a most welcome piece of news for all kolkattans...
This place was,is,and,will continue to be one of the golden immortal restos of kolkata...

I've been saving this one for a long time for my 100th review. That's partly because this is at the top of my personal brag list.  :P 

We had made a quick, hasty decision that autumn day. The unavailability of seats at Golden Dragon across the road and a steady chill outside had forced us into Mocambo. From the very moment the large door opened to reveal the warm, smoky, almost exotic interiors; it felt as if the sixties were back. Mocambo lived up completely to the image I had of it in my mind. The feel of the place is so reminiscent of what it might have been in the heydays of a flourishing Anglo Indian society centred around Park Street. The delicately painted walls portray scenes of dancing and merriment in the years gone by. The skirting line of bright green foliage neatly running around the frames, creates patterns on the otherwise light creme colored walls. There are small yet delicately carved wooden partitions between the seats. Of course, the best feature was the hanging lamps over every table hung by long thin metal chains from the ceiling with red shades looking like opening lotuses. Also, the powerful yellow watt bulbs make the tables glowing islands in an otherwise hazy interior. The seating arrangement divides the floor into two distinct parts by a beautiful half wall. From what it looks like, there's a family/ friends section with large seats settled in a half circle in the arching fashion of typical American Diner restaurants. Each small area may seat a party of 4 -5 . And there's a romantic / business section with small tables and one on one seating. Overall there's a gentle relaxed sense of laziness which uplifts the spirit into a sense of coziness. The glistening, bouncy foam seats, large and rounded done up in bright reds or greens also help.

Service is on a whole different level. From the uniformed usher giving a grand salute to the helpful, the bowing floor manager finding us a seat to our personal server patiently describing the dishes, we felt like royalty. The servers are among the best I've seen in the city in terms of service ethics, technique, courtesy and of course, patience. Food takes a while to arrive owing to the perennial stream of guests throughout the day, but I wasn't put off by that. The longer inside this place, the better I reckoned.

We may have felt like royalty, but my less than fat wallet reminded me otherwise. Much to my dismay, the prices seemed a bit more than I bargained for, forcing me to settle for a light lunch. Mocambo is costly; that's probably an understatement considering it's one of the greats in Park Street. Deciding on what to have was a herculean task. The menu is large to say the least. There are pages upon pages of specialties. The foreign delicasies look as enticing as the Muglai ones. And the names are priceless. Sample this : Angels on horseback. Ultimately, we had just one dish. But what a dish it was.. :D 

We had Chicken a la Kiev. Apparently, the only dish, she'd heard of earlier. It's a fillet of chicken stuffed with butter and deep fried from the top. There's cheese, baby corn and assorted condiments that mingle with the butter in a large bowl. A solitary tomato on top makes it look appealing while a generous dose of paprika and pepper make it savory from within. A touch of herbs complete the dish. The chicken was sweet and soft, broken into countless little neat round meatballs. The rolling buttery gravy was sweet, sticky and yummy. It's a fun dish. Maybe it was all the unsaturated fat, but it proved to be a struggle for the both of us. The menu says that the Russians love it. We followed suit.

I guess I rambled at parts. Sorry. I may seem like a little fanboy. In fact, I am one. :p

Chakraborty Tips : We had went there only a few days after Kahaani hit the screens. I made it a point to sit at the the table which Vidya Balan was shown to have occupied in the film. There must have been four or more groups of people who came after me and was distraught to see my smug face. :P The amused yet helpful manager obliged. The point is that these guys are there to assist you in any way, so don't hesitate to ask.

Visited this place yesterday and it was my nth visit to Mocambo. One of my friend wanted to taste different kinds of meat especially pork and without any doubt we went for Mocambo. Got ourselves a beer first of all and then got myself Pork Sirloin Steak with some BreadRoll while rest of my friends settled for a chicken steak and chicken oriental. One of my friend who never tasted pork, tried out my dish and loved the way the pork was cooked. After we were done, I asked them to try out Angels on Horseback(one of my favourites). As usual mocambo scores 10/10 on food and ambience. But the thing which I dislike about this place is their service. We had to wait for around 30+ mins for our dishes. We were told it would take 15 mins to serve angels on horseback. But it stretched beyond the 15 min mark and the food was served to us in the 35th minute. The waiter never asked us for water after serving us water in the first instance even though the glasses went empty. This is the only place where it needs improvement, big time.

Can't really comment about the cuisine which I hear is good . Had an argument with a rather cantankerous waiter who tried to make us (3 people) sit at a place meant for 2. The only reason he gave was " tees saal se aise ho raha hai". So much for customer is king ! Horrible service. Mocambo bilkul khush nahi hua.

It was a week day and I booked a table in advance which is well advised given its popularity. Between eating and tasting the dishes included please prawn cocktail crab cocktail chateaubriand beef steak  and a garlic prawn starter. The cocktail was seriously "tok" the difference between zing and sting. Little bit more smooth texture and less sour would have created a bit more magic. 

The steak was average. The flavour and the juices failed to get / stay in  the meat which is quintessential to a steak. Thankfully the sauce on the side aided in chewing the food!!! 

The prawn starter was quite interesting. Light and they garnished the dish with aloo bhaja. Very nice twist which indeed added a nice crunch. The prawn was also cooked to perfection.

Went very recently with family. Great place for satisfying all continental cravings. We ordered the chicken stroganoff; pork sirloin steak and the pork cutlet all from main course. The food came very tasteful and fresh. Real great management at the kitchen. Cheers to that both the portioning and the taste awesome. These are the reasons it's in the legendary category. To cite the not so good sides was an awful lot of mosquitoes underneath the table and most head waiters "the black coat ones" simply love gathering together and chatting more than anything else. The in restaurant experience definitely needs improvement learn from peter cat.. Food wise awesome shall come again

From the very first time, this place takes me back in time every time I visit. It's a great place for a hearty meal and (loud?) conversation. I never go without ordering the Devilled Crab which they serve in the shell. Divine! Meat lovers should try their meat lasagne. The Chicken Cordon Bleu and Chicken Orientale a la Mocambo are personal lean meat favourites. The risotto di scampi is something I always take back home because I never have enough room for it. Dessert options are poor but you won't need any anyway.

--------
I've had a couple of bad food experiences lately. Food doused in ketchupy sauce, ingredients that aren't fresh are just a few of them. Disappointed. 

--------
In light of recent events, by which I obviously mean the ridiculous reasons and unacceptable behaviour of the restaurant towards a lady and her chauffeur, I don't regret changing my rating of this establishment and my decision to never visit again and making sure to say the same to those who ask my opinion on it.

Whenever I say Mocambo a bollywood villain comes to my mind "MOGAMBO" but Mocambo is hero like a hero to me.
It was last Sunday when me and my friend visited this place.It was 5pm.We were tooo tired and hungry.A very old kind waiter helped us to find a seat.
After some discussion we orderd screw driver and rum as drink and as main food Chicken Tetrazzini,Pork sirloin steak,Chicken orientale ala micambo and Baked Alaska as well.
Tetrazzini was bit salted cheezy pasta and it was ok not that good but steak was awesome.The orientale was mmmm....  mouth watering.In the end baked alaka was hevenly. Over all it was a great experience..I must say the waiter was very helpfull.Comeing back for sure as "mocambo ne kush kiya".....LOL

It was a Sunday afternoon couple of weeks back when eight of us decided to have lunch at Mocambo. When we had called them up the day before they said they won't be able to reserve tables for Sunday. So we decided to reach there early since we were well aware of the rush and queue on the holidays. When we reached there around 12 noon and went inside, the manager (or maybe he was the in-charge for the day, whatever) told us the place has been booked by the 'management' for the entire day and they will not entertain any guest as a result. We were quite puzzled and then when he heard we were a group of eight and others have yet not arrived, it seemed he decided to change his mind! He asked us to come back when the entire group is present, for the time being he asked us to stand outside!! We were stunned by his attitude! We walked down the lanes and waited outside for another 15 minutes and when rest of us arrived we again went in and found already few more groups were having their lunch, and as we expected they were not from the 'management' as already I found one of my old college mate in another table with her group!! Anyway we tried to erase this episode from our mind and ordered for food which included so many dishes (which later amounted to more than Rs.8000/-) that much to our shock this 'manager' came to our table and started looking after our orders closely. We ordered for Cream of tomato, Chicken Chipolata, Chicken steak, Devilled Crab, Tuna Fish Dip, Vegetable surprise and among Indian dishes - Kulcha, Kadai murg, Chilly panir, etc and several drinks along with these. Quality and taste of food is the only and the biggest saving grace for this place for ages. If I forget about the reception we received at this place we can still think of going back and again having few dishes like the Devilled Crab, Tuna Fish Dip, Chicken Chipolata, etc. So here is my granular rating for this place that speaks the rest of my mind and sums up to give the overall rating of 2.5 out of 5:
a) Location & Car parking - 2/5
b) Food: 4/5
c) Pricing: 3/5
d) Ambiance & Decor: 3/5
e) Hospitality: 0/5

As d resturant was already full we had to wait fr a little while.
On entering it was all together a different environment.i dont know how bt inspite f being crowded it was absolutely calm.it was quite spacious,wd comfortable sofas to seat around small tables(i felt our table was too small fr 4ppl).it has 2sections separated by a wooden wall.
Now coming to d food.we odered peas pulao,kadai murg,chiken kabab masala, butter naan.all d dishes were yummy,very good in quality.when u go thru d prices on d menu card u wont feel dat it is costlier in comparison to other resturants in prk st bt once d food z served u cn understnd a portion served in a plate is enuf fr jst 1person,tuff to share.
U vl recieve a Warm and cordial service.
I wud luv to go bak again for d desert,chocolate souffle.it was on yesterday's spcl menu. delicious,creamy...i felt lik spnding another hour in leting it melt in my mouth.
Bt d waiter arrived wd d bill???? 
Which came as ₹1864/ for 4 persons.
A little suggestion or u may tk it as a request fr d resturant authority.kindly improve d state of d washroom.i knw ppl go there to eat n not fr using d washroom.still..its condition wasiserable.

It used to be my favourite.  Recently,  I felt that the service has deteriorated.  In peak time, be prepared to wait for one and half hours outside to get a sit and then 1 hour inside to get served. Even the yummiest steak becomes tasteless after that.

And I am simply in love with their every type of Sizzler platter !
If you are a sizzler fan and visiting Mocambo for first time, do order their Sizzlers .. you will be amazed with the taste.
Enjoy ! :)

By far my best in Kolkata. Heritage restaurant very busy. Be sure to reserve in advance to prevent long wait. The menu is very nice and the food amazing. Continental and Indian is what they serve but i would recommend the Continental food. The service is excellent and the captain does suggest the right food to newbies. Absolute value for money though a little expensive. Ambience is also very classy and it is bang on the main road.
Must Visit if in Kolkata and do try the fish preparations

old players do not wear designer attire to impress their mostly senior (already known) and some new aged clientele .. it's easy to hide much needed interiors re done in darknesses.. anyways abt the food.. it's like any Venice restaurants where Menu cards are written in a language which most people can not figure out/ lengthy.. what to order where to end.. it's not certainly the very same case scenario here.. however they put more than necessary cheese in some preparation, reasons unknown.. may be to overcompensate.. instead of so much cheese.. some proper spices/ seasoning should have been applied to make the dish towards more authentic.. most of the continental preparation had reduced to their Indian versions.. like Chinese food in kolkata or in other cities too where it has become indo- chinese mostly with lacs of options.. frm the sidewalks to the five stars.. an example of authenticity is their version of fish and chips (a classic dish).. it's merely a simple bengali style medium sized fish fry with some potato helpings which is not even fresh and packaged version.. we understand that they can not use cod, haddock, salmon and so on.. but some other new restaurants in Kolkata are doing it.. they pretend to use bekti which we expect at least.. but it seems to be basa as it tastes or something else.. portions in all dishes are becoming smaller for a big eater like me.. other people agree sometimes with me.. still whatever they are offering.. mostly tasty and not easy to find somewhat.. you just have to forget the authentic 'Continental, Italian' outcome from them.. make your expectation moderated and let them serve whatever they would like to in their own style..

I started visiting this place as a kid! And yet going to mocambo excites me! The only draw back is the crowd for which we have to wait outside and it becomes too crowded inside...! My favorite starter there is a chicken kabab stuffed with minced chicken... Its mouth watering! For the main course I would recommend fish ala Diana, chicken princess and vegetable Florentine! The baked alska for the dessert is good too!

Though the calorie count shoots up a bit with cheese used in every gravy...but who cares when its their b'day.  Mocambo got my thumbs up.

This is one of my very favorite restaurants in town. I used to work in Park Street, so being here was a piece of cake for me. I simply love their food. There is one thing that they need to improve on and that is their wait time. For starters I always have Pork Chop. It is simply my favorite. A big chunk of meat and whole lot of cheese in it. Other than that Greek drunken prawns are worth a try as well (I was fascinated by the name). All the other food they serve are pretty good as well. A must visit if you    are in Kolkata.

BEFORE READING THE REVIEW: These guys suck as human beings. Racist to the core.

I can write an essay about this place. This place undoubtedly serves the best continental dishes in the city. If you are not among those who sacrifice taste for religious beliefs, then the beef steak over here is a must try. Or, even better try surf and turf, beef steak topped with fresh shrimps from the ocean. This place is not as big as Bar b que or Peter Cat but when it comes to food they have the same level of expertise. If you are a food lover and have not been to this place yet, then you are going to end up in hell as this is blasphemy to the God of food.

Well, this is a heritage restaurant. It feels and looks like heritage and premium as well. I personally love the elaborated menu card. You don't have to ask the waiter repeatedly about the nature and chief ingredients as those are already explained.
In innumerable number of visits, we rather restricted ourselves to few continental dishes and never tried the Indian ones.
We generally start with Soups, served with utmost care. Chicken spring soup, creme of crab are smooth in taste and fair in quantity. One serves two in general. 

Prawn cocktail is another one what we like to have, small in quantity, but extremely good to taste. My earnest advice is, never miss Vetki Bell Meuniere there, it's too tasty and crunchy. Serving is good looking too.

In main course, Garlic Breads are must. Bread roll are ok, but tends to become rubbery as it gets cold. I never forget to order Fish ala Diana. It's light on taste, but, the stuffed betki pieces are too awesome to resist. Cold Chicken Salad is another dish to mention. Just try it once. You will loooove it. Chicken Tetrazini is so-so and possibly this is the only dish which disappointed us. Meat Lasagni is very good. 

Chicken ala Kiev is a signature dish of Mocambo and it's too good. If you are bored with this dish, try its congener Chicken Pavlograd. You will like it too. Vegetable and prawn staffing instead of molten butter in Pavlograd is highly palatable.
Chicken and fish steaks are fair. Heard a lot about their Tuna fish, but yet to try.

Now, in desert section, Baked Alaska is beautiful with unique garnishing. But, I should say Baked Alaska was better even a year ago, than it is now. Brownie with Chocolate Sauce is finger licking good. And their Souffle, is one of my favourite!!!

And here are those where they fall short-
1. Cheese and mayonnaise everywhere (continental dishes generally have them, but in mocambo these are too much)
2. Garnishing are highly monotonous- Smashed potato... boiled peas... boiled carrot. Oh ho...give me a break.  :-(
3. Fine dining experience? No buddy, it's Not. Just old same décor. Heritage ? It's true... but....
4. Few dishes taste just the same. Need to update their menu.

And still.... I AM A BIG FAN OF MOCAMBO !!!!! :-)

One of the oldest eateries of Park Street, Mocambo doesn't really need a review to prove its standards. One of the best places serving the best quality continental food in Kolkata and can easily beat any new restaurant, be it baked fish or the mixed grill sizzlers, everything will leave you absolutely delighted :)
And don't forget to leave the place without having the Baked Alaska, ahh, what lovely dessert it is !!
happy eating :)

Being born & brought up in Calcutta, Mocambo is no stranger. Their menu consisting of Chicken, Bhetki, Crab, Beef, Ham, Mutton has always tickled my tastebuds.
We were in for a rude shock when the management didn't allow us to celebrate my cousin's birthday by cutting a cake inside their restaurant. We were 8 of us. After a bit of pleading with the Captain, they offered us to cut the cake but told us we could not eat it inside the restaurant.
Request Team Zomato to mention it so that people like us can decide before going to a restaurant for celebrating birthdays.

P.S. - This rating is not for the food.

Mocambo is a landmark in Calcutta's foody list . It has been the most authentic Continental food joint for as long as Calcuttan's can remember. Nothing much has changed in the restaurant in the last couple of decades except for the pricing of course and the live music they used to play long back.

The food is sumptuous and reliable. They have an Indian menu but if you are going to Mocambo for once try non-Indian items. They make the most authentic Chateaubriand and the Deviled Crab and Prawn Cocktail yummmm. You will actually never get bored with ordering the same item though in my case I think I have been able to taste most of the stuff they have in their menu :-).

Dont forget to sum up your food experience there with a Baked Alaska or Cream Caramel. Mocambo will probably never get old for us no matter how many new food joints grace our city.....

Nevertheless, you need to get your luck ok work if you're trying to find  booking during the festive season. Dont forget to try Chicken Chipolatte.

We were 5 persons in office & in lunch time decided to go for sizzlers with wine instead of routine roti & bhaji, that's why  we had our lunch at mocambo.

4 varieties of sizzler & one risotto we ordered.
Risotto & tandoori sizzler is just mouth watering with red wine.

Mocambo still stands tall in the Kolkata foodscape in spite of so many new restaurants and their fancy cuisines and interiors hitting the city each year. Mocambo certainly has got what it takes and despite its dim lighting and somewhat shabby interiors, it sees a good crowd throughout the week, dropping in to taste its delicious Continental fare. They do offer Indian, Mughlai and Tandoori food, but their Continental preparations do the trick! The Chateaubriand with Roast Potatoes on the side, the Devilled Crab, Fish Ã  la Diana, the Mixed Grill, Ã€ la Kiev, Chicken Cordon Blue, Grilled Hilsa served on banana leaf, Baked Alaska, Cream Caramel, Trifle Pudding, CrÃªpes with Lemon or Orange Sauce are simply out of this world. They have a bar too and a glass of classic cocktails does wonders. Quiet service is a bonus.

All Heritage dishes are worth trying. I always have there devilled crabs for sure. Demolishing the Chicken A la Kiev is a delight in itself. The Raj-era food plus the dimmed lights makes it a must visit place @kolkata....!!!!!

Mocambo was just an accidental place we hit traveling from IITKGP to Kolkatta, and guess what, our wait for the venue was worth for the energy spent in traveling to the city. The place has its own chilled atmosphere that makes you feel warm. Spaghetti with meatballs, risotto, sizzlers and of course some cocktail made our day. The quality of service was up to mark with respect to time. The place seemed to be full even at 5 in the evening which suggests there's some magnetic attraction for the people for its food.I hope to give it a visit once again sometime in the near future.

As a continental lover i find this is the best restaurant to serve continental. i visited this place several times. Each and every time i was just mesmerized by the experience. There are some signature dishes of mocambo which you can try by reading the food description, following that you can try any one of them (if you are not aware about that dish). Prawn cock tail , chicken Sicilliene, Fish A La Dianai is my favourite

There are some places in Kolkata which takes me to a joy ride back to my childhood when i was still in fluffy pink frock holding my Grandmum's hand and awaiting for wonders. One such place is Mocambo. I remember one day, it was 23rd June, my bday and after school my Grandmum takes me to lunch to this fairy land. and from that day Mocambo is nothing but a fairyland to me. Every time i am there i miss those hands tiding my napkin on my lap  and smiling back at me. I could write a muse on this place. Literally. Mocambo is not subject for any introduction it is a brand on it's own , a parameter or rather a yardstick as far as excellence in food is concerned. You cannot feel gloomy with those red lamp shed hanging above you illuminating what you are indulging to. The smell of citrus and washed laundry always amazes me and then you hear the sizzle of those gigantic metal platters and you know good times have just started. Gladly my fiance loves this place as much as i do or more and whenever its something special and quite often it is (that happens when you are in love) we know where to head. I love everything in their menu but that is very partial of me as i have not tried their Indian dishes at all.  The Chicken Chipolata Sizzler or non Sizzler will sizzle you alright. The sausages are as of you are eating the best in Germany. The chicken is always tender and i have ordered this dish for zillion times now. The sauce is mild, perfectly embalming itself on the dish. Chicken Cordon Blue which is  just oozing with homely goodness of ham, cheese, butter and everything that makes you not stop eating. Its a perfect combination of crispy in the outside and oozing moistness in the inside. Chicken Pavalograd is like a bounty to be cherished peppers, butter luxuriating through your pallet and the mushrooms making even your worst mood vanish. Its a dream. Buy my favorite stands the Gothic combination of crab and oven.Devil's crab is  beauty in the most sinful way. Crab meat cooked in perfection in white sauce and ingredients which you can only enjoy but cant seize to recognize served and baked in its shell with cheese crusting in galore. Every time i have it i feel that i know the purpose of being alive. Its very obtuse of me but i have always ended my indulgence with Baked Alaska which is "Everything Nice" for me. Foam of heavily beaten egg white and powdered sugar warm yet keeping cold the vanilla ice cream candied fruits and cake hidden inside it like a yet to be discovered island. The taste of whisky and the effect of setting fire in the ice......Could one want anything more...I guess No

This place is one of my very favourite, located in park street, is well known among all in kolkata.... Renowned for its continental cuisines the food never let's u down....

the ambience in very good, with unique lamps hanging over the table and the comfortable sofas makes the experience even more enjoyable....

coming to the main part i.e the food.... Being to the core non-vegan, the chicken ala kiev and the chicken cordon bleu made my day.... my other favourites of this joint are the meat lasagne, fish ala diana, spaghetti with meatballs and the chicken pavlograd. The service is also commendable and is pretty good.

for me,
Food =
Presentation: 4.2/5
Quality: 4.8/5
Quantity: 4/5
Ambience: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Overall: 4.2/5

talk of continental food in kolkata and the resturant
( rather one of the best ) that comes to my mind is of Mocambo's. Hope they continue their service like this in future, too.... wishing them all the success !!!!

Location: Park Street
Pros: Already quite famous (shown in a Bollywood Biggie where the actress was shown eatin' inside), bein' situated in the 'food para' of Kolkata, this continental resto serves good food! Despite huge rush, the foods are served hot and in a low dim environment!
Cons: The servicin' is a bit slow. Avoid weekends and holidays.
Don't leave the space without: Havin' the wide range of continentals!

Mocambo- Consistency is thy name:- the Fish Meuniere`, Devilled Crab and the Fish A La Diana have been the same over the last 20 odd years. 
The disadvantage here is waiting for a table, though the advantage is that they serve Alcohol!
If you are lucky to get a table away from the door you can enjoy a sumptuous meal. (People actually peer into your plate to gauge how long you'll take).

A restaurant carrying a mixture of old world charm and dash of modern recipes..that is MOCAMBO. An array of exotic Italian cuisine is sure to tease your test  buds even though everything contains a distinct overdose of cheese.The "resotto-de-scampi" is scrumptious and the "spaghetti with meat balls " wont disappoint you. Indian food though available,is a bit extravagantly priced compared to their quality and quantity.If you are looking for an exotic experience of  cheese and pasta make a trip to this  dear old place in Park Street;but if you are more of a "spice n chilli" person,give it a pass.

I had visited on yesterday night .In that gusty rainy night I have to wait for 30 mints thought I booked the table 1 hours before. So already upset with their service. Come to the Menu ; Tested chicken A LA Kiev and Chicken Cordon Blu with bread roll and Bacardi .The A LA Kiev was just super I just scoffed it. The Corden Blu was not so much good as expected .The ambience was just superb. But I don't know why they prefer families first. I just disgusted with the haughtiness of the  managers. For family member it is an Elysian place to visit for a dinner but with friends I am afraid it will be a very bad experience. In short Good Food with ill-mannered attitude.

Perhaps one of the better restro bar I have been to in years. I have always been a very huge fan of many restaurants that have been present at park street and hence I visited this place for some brunch. 
My order was a pint and a Sizzler to get me going through the day.
This place has got great style within itself to project its own class. The ambiance is just too perfect no matter what time you visit it, be it day or night.
The staff is very hospitable and help you in making your orders even more comfortable.
My advice to you would be to visit the place and fall in love with it.

The king of park street is mocambo. Unchanged since its inception the place is the best joint for beef steaks, baked alaska and some cocktails. Its difficult to get a seat. Its always full. The service is excellent and represent the days of the Raj. The steaks they serve is the best I have had In India... the price is amazing.. if you're in Cal mocambo is a must in your list.

The restaurant still maintains its heritage..Though not for Indian palette. But can go once in a while to try something different than routine. their signature is fish muniyere..cant be found on menu though. Highly recommended and delectable. Not recommended for sizzlers. if u r not from Kolkata, u can get better sizzlers in other cities. We had fish Florentine as well which was tasty. The place is crowded after 8pm

this would be a very short review. if i think of mocambo, all that comes to my mind is - 1. good place to have beef steak, 2. reasonably priced alcohol, 3. long queue to get in. the first 2 are positives and the last one is a big negative! however the continental food items on offer are good. getting parking place at park street is another annoying issue which is growing each day, so that's another small negative. interior is cozy and the waiters are friendly.

old old old heritage sight to eat...nicely done old world charm interiors...great floats,amazing crab meat served... !
The Interiors, are cozy warm and inviting! The couch will seat you really comfortably. The waiters are dressed traditionally in the white British-India style !ALthough the managers were cordial,the white-dressed waiters...well they seemed to be distant cousins of those at the Indian Coffee House.Weirldy,even at Mocambo,they literally stood near the table to see how much we tipped,almost bending over my back to see the wallet,shameful !

However,the food...oh yes...
chicken tettrazini,meat lasagna and the stuffed chicken breasts with cheese and mushroom,chicken pavlograd...yummy !--------------------------------------------------went again...2015 Puja and yes,it is one of  my most favorite places in Kolkata...a must visit for me...the spaghetti carbonara this time was extra juicy and the portion was ...enough for 2 ppl - the chicken grilled sizzler was...well lacked flavour,but the tettrazzini,fish biryani and the mixed grill kebab platter...were exquisite !it would have been a 4.5 but the #hosts/black shirt order takers were not very warm-no interaction,no eye contact almost - COLD and abysmally plastic - the platers were rather better - the management MUST look into it and make sure the chef's hard work does not go to waste ! Interaction in service is very important !

Its one of my favorite place among all the Italian & continental restaurant.. I have visited this place many times.. But mocambo have never made me disappointed.. The Prawn starters like hawks bay prawn is so mouth watering, a must try dish & in main course risotto di-scampi (because I'm a huge risotto lover) is the best risotto u'll get here among all the restaurants 7 Chicken Sicilian is superb & chicken Paprika is so delicious.. Price is very reasonable here and worthy. Quantity & quality is really awesome.. Service is good.. u have to wait for sometimes after placing order of ur foods.. But the quantity n quality will suffice ur desire of getting the best delicious food of the town. Decor & ambiance is good but not upto the mark.. Price of drinks is reasonable. So in food: I will give 5 out of 5 in ambiance & decor: 3.5 out of 5 Service: 3.5 out of 5 Price: 4 out of 5 So my average rating for this joint is 4.5...

Mocambo. Old world Calcutta charm :) 
So on poila baishaak me and some friends thought lets go to one of 'THE' places in Park Street and hence, Mocambo !

The Interiors, are cozy warm and inviting. I love the individual ceiling lamps ! The couch will seat you really comfortably. The waiters were dressed traditionally in the white British-India style uniform which at first painfully reminded me of my history book =.='
Now, lets talk about the food. So we were four people and we ordered :=
1. Prawns with Mushroom and Garlic- I have rarely and let me emphasize that RARELY tasted such a delectable prawn appetizer. Generous shavings of garlic, the creamy ,tangy, sweet, perfectly balanced sauce and the best touch was the shaved potato crisps. Yes you heard me right the bengaali style jhuri aloo bhaja !  It was the highlight of the afternoon.
2. Meaty Lasagne - My friend took that and it was really tasty with loads of cheese and tasty meaty filling.
3. Chicken Tetrazzini- This was one of my favorites, it had chicken, mushroom, spaghetti, and of course cheese !  all baked to perfection.
4. Chicken Milanese- I took this and it was so creamy and smooth. It was chicken and ham in a rich cream sauce topped with guess what ? CHEESE! 
5. Chicken Steak with Mushroom sauce- To cut off all that cheese ! we ordered this dish as a sizzler. It was all very dramatic , the hot plate, the smoke and it was delicious , there is something about this place and the mushrooms , I tell you. 
6. Souffle- Chocolate and Mocha-  This I was not very impressed with. It tasted like chocolate ice cream beaten with whipped cream. Not expected from such a restaurant and was rather a let down. 

The Service was nice and polite although when it came to the payment I noticed many waiters standing around and watching, that was rather rude. Also their card machine had certain problems so that my card got declined while when I checked it via an ATM outside worked perfectly ! So that needs to be looked into. The waiting staff need to be taught to not be so obviously intrusive. 
The food is certainly worth coming back for despite certain glitches here and there !

It has been my favorite restaurant since my childhood. Let it be any occasion  if my opinion was asked we always went to Mocambo. I love their Prawn Thermidor ,Chicken Pavlograd and Prawn cocktail. As a child i cherished their desert "Baked Alaska" ,specially its fire ring around it. I make it sure that every time i visit Kolkata i do go to Mocambo. Simply love its food.

382 reviews! That says it all about the place. 
I had a feeling that the service might be rude because this is a Kolkata heritage but I was wrong. We went a little earlier than the normal lunch time to avoid the rush and line. The servers politely showed us our table, gave us enough time to choose before taking our order. 

Other than the ever so famous chicken a la kiev, the chef's special chicken tetrazzini is a MUST try!  After reading the zomato reviews, I had made up my mind to taste the Baked Alaska. After finishing the main course when the servers asked if he should bring the dessert I nodded happily but tsk tsk I was disappointed.

The froth was extremely bitter. The fruits and ice cream that followed the froth could not make up for the bitterness that had already entered my system. I could not finish the rest of the Baked Alaska. I wonder what made people like this particular dessert. I would have given a 4 to Mocambo for this bitter experience but the a la kiev and tetrazzini surely scored a LOT to make up for anything.

I would personally suggest you to try some other dessert. Beautiful red and orange lampshades, courteous staff and the feel of old Kolkata nostalgic dining! A must visit although there are better places now all around the town, but a must visit anyway!

I'm absolutely omitting the part about Mocambo's history- my fellow reviewers have already raved about it a lot :3

ambience- the ambience is beautiful, specially the lamps that hang. The red sofas and the black seats are comfortable enough too. 

The food- we ordered a cola ice cream, vegetable queen, veg cannelloni, veg steak sizzler and tooti frooti. 
The cola ice cream basically had a blob of vanilla ice cream on coca cola. It tasted nice. 
Next came in vegetable queen- a thick bread with vegetables in white sauce. It came on a bed of potato crunchies. A dash if capsico sauce- and It tasted lovely!
Next came in the cannelloni. The cheese layer was burnt, and the waiter wasted no time in sneaking it past us. They served it without keeping it on the table! The taste was good indeed. 
What disappointed me was the veg steak sizzler though- maybe because we were full by the time it was served. Nonetheless, none of us liked it. 
We ended our meal with tooti frooti. Unlike other restaurants, they serve fresh fruits in here which was a pleasant surprise. 

The service- the waiters were a big disappointment. No one bothered to come to take our order unless we called, the glasses weren't filled fast enough. The waiters didn't even bother replying us.. All they did was pass the orders to the juniors. We called for the bill and the waiter just shouted behind his bck "bill laa ke de". You don't expect such demeanor from a restaurant like Mocambo! 

However, we had a lovely evening and therefore goes a 4 from my side!

It is safe to say that Mocambo happened to be a part of my growing up and used to be the comfort zone food wise Calcutta had to offer back in time. I came back here after a while and still is pretty much in awe of this joint. I witnessed the societal robbing of our colonial past but Mocambo is the blooming resistance to that onslaught and still retains its past colonial glory.

I mostly fancy their Pepper Crab  Devilled  with Chateaubriand Steak/Fish Steak and  if you are having your lucky day then have a crack at their Baked Alaska !   "Gluttony is an emotional escape",

Cheers !

The only negetive thing about this place is you have to wait for a long time outside during any occasion.. Otherwise the food is really delicious.. They have a variety of sizzlers.. Last but not the least their dessert. You'll surely get confused about what to choose.. Liked their brownie with hot chocolate. The qualty of brownie is just way too good. Better than any place indeed. Also liked baked alaska and its appearance or garnishing whatever you call was really good and so was the taste infact.

I ate here thrice and each time the experience was the same. The food was not anything out of the world, but it was quite good. I have tried most of the steaks and they taste great. The biriyani is good too. But the spoiler is that it takes ages for the food to be serves. The service is quite slow and the waiters seem to work in slow motion. Other than that, the ambience is congenial and the little red lamps over each table makes for a very pretty decor. I will not say that the food is cheap, but its not expensive either. So if you want to try out Mocambo, then make sure you have heaps of time at your disposal.

Mocambos as the Calcutta hardcore' will recall has tried hard to maintain its food standard but barely so !!! I guess the D'Sousas,and Chaytors who  served delectable Anglo Jhal freizes,prawn cocktails,Steaks ,and Chicken Maryland have all gone Nonethe less the Sizzlers, and grilled Beckti are worth a visit.From a haunt of Jazz and Jam session lovers Mocambos is now a quiter place.The music and Glass dance floor is a thing of the past but then Alas those were the heydays.
Mocambos still shows glimpses of the 50s,and 60s,and is well worth a visit. 
The ambience and service is good and the variety available is satisfactory---.....however they should stick to the good old menus and not compete with the modern teeny bopper eateries lately come to town.

I think there was a phase when the popularity of this restaurant and the curiosity factor was at an all time high - and that too all because of Kahaani and the Agnes episode! But in real life too this place is part of the Kolkata culinary heritage bandwagon alongside the legendary Peter Cat, Bar-B-Q and Flurys!
Getting a place here is a struggle like almost everywhere else on Park Street - the queues for Lunch and Dinner can go right around the block but once you're inside its totally worth it!
I recall the last meal that I had there in 2012 - it was a beautiful dinner with my then fiancee , and my now wife! 
I can't recall exactly what all we ordered , but I think there was a Chicken Lollipop, a Fried Rice of some sorts, a few drinks and sweet dish. The exact items don;t really matter because I remember that we had a lovely time in a wonderful ambience with pleasant service,
The only problem is that this place is located a little too off Park Street because of which the parking is a major problem. I remember that I had struggled big time trying to find a spot right opposite to this place and ultimately had to park opposite the Loreto House School.That was a major bummer!
Still I would recommend everyone to visit this dainty little place - if for nothing else , at least a slice of history!

the last tine i went with 4 people and we all ordered different dishes.fish a la diana,chicken paprika,chicken pavlograd,and mutton steak.all the items was  cheezy.
its safe to stick with their sizzlers for which they are known.

Two of the best Sizzlers are chicken chipootli and pork sizloin steak..(i may have gotten the names wrong,but they are wonderful-must haves)

Mocambo is surely one of the best restaurants in town when it comes to Continental cuisine.The Steaks, Cold Chicken Salad, Fish Muniere along with deviled crab are the hotties.They also serve a well variety of drinks as well.The interiors could be better as i feel the management is not bothered about the same.And the only backdrop is the service which they should definitely look upon.

After reading umpteen good reviews, it coaxed on me to visit this heritage continental address. So went there for lunch with a colleague of me. The ambiance was quite cheerful and this place certainly exudes an old world charm. The lighting was graceful and the artwork doning the walls added to its glory. Coming to the food, we ordered their heritage Fish Steak as starters and two Fresh Lime Soda. The fish was very tender and juicy. All I can say is it was yummy and made me even more hungry.

Next we ordered a continental specialty- Spaghetti with Meat Balls for myself and a Chicken Cordon Bleu for my colleague. The service did take its time but all that wait proved worthwhile. Perfectly balanced was my spaghetti with the  quintessential amount of cheese and the soft and tender meatballs. I was too full but I had a bite of the Cordon Bleu. It was a chicken wrapped around cheese and ham. The sight of the oozing melted cheese made it even more desirable. It was classic and so was delicious. The price was not much considering the royalty it enjoys and cost us just 1400/- . Had a very good time and already looking forward to my next visit to try out the other items in the menu. A well deserved 4 stars from me....

Close your eyes and visit this restaurant, may take a lil more time than other restaurants to serve but when they do, everybody watches.... enjoy..

Mocambo is a place am always ready to visit and three generations of my food loving family have patronized it .... it therefore saddens me to have a meal there that did not quite live up to the bar it has set for itself ! Even making allowances that it was a Saturday night I honestly expected more.
We ordered Devilled Crab which is crab meat in white sauce and mushrooms stuffed in a crab shell , covered with cheese and baked and yes it tastes as good as it sounds.... excellent. Our other starter is called Vegetable Queen and I am not sure its still on the menu .... basically a slice of thick bread is cut into four pieces and fried and then its topped with vegetables in white sauce and served with freshly made potato sticks ( not the packet variety ) again and old favorite and delicious .... for those who find it a bit bland add a dash of Tabasco Sauce on it. Both these dishes got our meal off to a great start and we were looking forward to our main course.
This is where we met with the disappointment ..... We ordered four dishes ..... Vegetable Surprise which consisted of veggies and cottage cheese made in a sauce of that was a combination of both red and white sauce and was served with yellow rice.... good flavors and everyone liked it. Then came the Cheese and Garlic Risotto which was again very good though I found it slightly drier than I like my Risotto personally but flavor wise it was good. Fish Steak Followed which is a fillet of bhekti drenched in a white sauce with mushroom which was served ice-cold and found it slightly bland. Now I have eaten this before on more than one occasion so was quite sad to have to settle for such a poor version of a usually good dish. The biggest let-down was the famed Surf and Turf which is essentially a Chateaubriand served up with four medium sized prawns on top which I ordered with a Pepper Sauce. The quality of the steak was really poor , tough and charred outside to the point one could not cut parts of it and underdone inside. The prawns were rubbery and not fresh. The pepper sauce was just average. Again I am zapped because this is a dish that I have ordered a number of times earlier and was always good. We ended with a Cream Caramel which was very nice. Service was decent enough and food was served fairly quickly however the disappointment lingers , I certainly hope this place serves me good food next time because its one of those places in Kolkata that is Legend however it would be hara-kiri to compromise on the quality of the ingredients that they serve !

My idea of foodie heaven is Mocambo .... it transports me to a bygone era when Park Street was actually Party Street !!! Whenever I dine here with my parents I never get tired of hearing them tell me about the good ol' days when they came to Mocambo and Blue Fox to dance the night away and point out where the live band played and where the dance floor was located. In those moments I truly wish I had a time machine to transport me back in time ! The best part of eating in Mocambo is that it still looks and feels exactly the same ( I have been visiting since childhood with my folks). The food makes me happy .... that's the best way I can put it ! My favourites are the  Mulligatawny Soup which is a must have along with the Devilled Crab both of which are super yummy and my favourite ways to start my meal. For the main course I am always spoilt for choice between the Chicken A La Keiv , Chicken Cutlet , Fish A La Diane , Fried Fish or Lobster Thermidor or the Chateaubriand Steak all of which are delicious and flavours I have grown up eating. This time however I decided to order the Chateaubriand Steak with Pepper Sauce (which I had not sampled in a while) and my dinner companion decided to try the Yorkshire Pork Chops (pictured below) which were succulent , soft and delightful to taste. The perfect sweet ending to this lovely meal is the Tutti Frutti Ice Cream or the Cream Caramel.



----- 07 Aug, 2012 -----

I simply love Mocambo .... when you step in you feel like a time machine takes you back a few decades. 
Start with the Mulligatawny Soup which is excellent and a personal favourite and for your mains either order Devilled Crab or the Chicken Ala Keiv. Chicken Cordon Blue or Fish A La Diane are excellent choices as well. Finish off with a Tutti Fruity. 
They serve decent steaks but personally I don't find the Steaks and Mixed Grill as good as they used to be.

Mocambo, of course, needs no introduction. One of the gems of heritage Park Street cuisine, its food has been winning the hearts of generations. Although my family personally prefers other restaurants, we have eaten at Mocambo on a few occasions when some close relatives treated us. Having heard much about its fare, I was eager to try out their versions of some of my favourite dishes. Their Indian, I have to say, is good. The kebabs are flavourful and well-cooked, and the paneer and chola are also enjoyable. Nice; standard Indian fare. 
However, I am disappointed to note that their continental ia really not to my taste. On one occasion I ordered a chicken tetrazzini. The pasta was too soft, the chicken bland and it was all drenched in WAY too much white sauce! I had to leave most of it untouched; it was simply roo heavy. On another occasion I ordered the spaghetti carbonara - another favourite. And did I regret it! It's unfortunate that most Kolkata restaurants add a huge dollop of cream to carbonara - when traditionally the recipe doesn't call for it - but at Moxambo, it's a task to even find a bit of bacon or pasta in all the cream swimming on the dish! Once again, I had to leave most of it; all that cream was making me quite sick. The vanilla ice-cream I ordered to ease my stomach was also bland, with very watery chocolate sauce. 
It's sad that my experience of such a renowned restaurant was so poor. I know how many accolades it's received and I honestly wish my view were different. But the way things are, it's unlikely I'll return there. And the Indian isn't remarkable enough to warrant a second visit. 
Not what I'd hoped for from a place like this. :/

Friends from delhi were visiting and we decided to meet at Mocambo, on a bright sunny afternoon. On arrival found my friends already seated & sipping on their respective vodka straights & beer. I also ordered for a vodka with fresh lime n soda. The service was prompt & soon we were frisking for starters in the menu. A spicy tuna with dip was ordered with extra garlic bread. 

After a few rounds of drinks, we ordered for main course - angels on horseback, chicken ala mocambo & fish florentine. I personally love the fish & the angels on H. Whenever I visit, always opt for european dishes, as it's their forte. The service is quite quick, the place always packed & weekends you are bound to wait a good period before being seated.

Its one of those heritage evergreen restaurants, probably why some recent movies have been shot here. It's a landmark in kolkata.

However, sometimes I wish the servers would smile more often. What I hear from my father, they did back in his prime. Wonder what went wrong over the years~! 

Nevertheless, a big round of applause for Mocambo.

FOR AN EATERY WHICH SCREENS GUESTS ON BASIS OF RACE AND SOCIO ECONOMIC BACKGROUND , ZOMATO SHOULD INTRODUCE A ZERO RATING. I AM HAPPY SEEING ZOMATO REVIEWERS CELEBRATING ITS FUNERAL THIS WAY. 

Mocambo opened its doors in 1956, an European oasis of glamour and jazz on Park Street, Calcutta’s famous cabaret row.The interiors would definitely run a flashback of the good old 60s red carpet intimate seating,red silk lampshades hanging upside down like tulips and red sofas. Even the shabbiness of the place seems intentional, since a part of us want to live in the past..especially when it comes to a descriptive Continental menu.

It was the last friday eve of feb, when me , flocked by my two besties decided to gorge on some extra cheesy-buttery conti delicasies ; and i bet there is no better place in the city to savour such than Mocambo!
We started with the PRAWN COCKTAIL and the DEVILLED CRAB.both of them were bomblastic good!! our taste buds were literally taken on a joy ride :)
Next, FISH ALA DIANA was nice as well for me, but my companions found the fish a bit stinky and decided not to order fish here anymore. we wanted something on the spicier side now,and went according to waiters suggestion-The CHICKEN STEAK WITH PEPPER SAUCE SIZZLER which was again a super hit! CHICKEN PAVLOGRAD followed, as i think one must have ala-kiev or this when ever in mocambo- the first incision and molten butter squirted out and filled the plate..thats more a visual treat to me and we completely indulged ourselves in it. the last dish was CHICKEN CORDON BLEU which comes as fried breast of chicken stuffed with ham and huge amount of liquid cheese..we were too full for desserts and skipped it!

the staff needs to be bit more polite and attentive to the guests, the washroom needs immediate reconstruction, we found a strand of hair in pavlograd,though the dish was immediately replaced on complaining but there was no sign of apology from their side,this also reveals the unhygenic conditions of the kitchen.the cutleries,especially the old style glasses need to be replaced...even gold needs repolishing once in a decade for its brighter shine,so does MOCAMBO!

The home of continental food in Kolkata.I had not visited Mocambo for a long long time before one of my friends took me there.Have to thank her for re introducing myself to this place.Coming to the food

The Murg firdosi Kebab is a must have,Havent tasted anything like this anywhere else.The Crab meat Cocktail and Prawn Cocktail are other signature dishes.The devilled crab is another delicious dish.

Their Tandoori Mixed grill and Mixed grill ala mocambo is excellent.So is the Chicken Chipolata and Chicken Pavlograd are equally good.

Dont forget to order the baked alaska.You will be in for a surprise

The most renowned continental restaurant of Calcutta since ages located in the heart of park street is always crowded with locals as well as tourists. A popularity rare to be seen,a 15min queue is the least you have to wait during weekends or peak hours.
Ambience 8/10
The hanging orange lamps and comfy couched seats,with the bar section at one corner provides you a sense of privacy amidst the extensive crowd. Now that's cosy!
Food Presentation 9/10
Whatever you choose from the continental section,you'll find that being served alongside noodles & stir fried vegetables! And it looks appetizing!
Food Quality 10/10
The chicken a la kiev is the signature dish here,where you get a conical chicken cutlet stuffed with molten butter which kinda explodes when you cut it. Tastes excellent! The chicken cordon bleu is a chicken cutlet wrapping a huge slice of ham and liquid cheese! A lovely combination. The orientale a la mocambo is actually a chicken dish served alongside buttered rice. From the fish items,we tried fish a la diana which was the best of all! Never had such amazing continental stuff in my life!
Food quantity 8/10
After having one dish all by yourself, you'll feel like having a bit more.
Cost effectiveness 8/10
Yes the place is a bit expensive but you won't get such quality at cheaper prices.
Overall 43/50

I remember the day I went in here as a little kid in the winter of 1995. I was there with a huge family gathering & we possibly stacked up to a number of 12. And we did have a jolly good time back then. Smoked Hilsa is the only dish I can recall now, sadly.
After many years of obscurity, back I came to Mocambo 18 years later& hey presto, the place hadn't changed one bit! The same seating arrangements, the same red seats& the same dim lights greeted us 18 years later& I got high on a bout of nostalgia. I now well knew how the restaurant functioned& what it specialized in. As it was a lazy Sunday evening, I wanted to have something that was light on the stomach. We were a group of 3& we ordered a plate of peas pulao, chicken reshmi masala& chicken firdousi kabab (yes, in spite of knowing what this place specializes in). When there's an Indian section associated with a Brobdingnagian name like Mocambo, you expect the standards to be mammoth. Unfortunately, there was nothing that stood out in the food. A lot of people have given rave reviews about the Firdousi kabab here, but I found it to be completely unappealing. Some dry vegetarian filling wrapped in wafer- thin peels of dry  chicken didn't quite appeal to me.My throat was almost parched. The other dishes were pretty good, though the quantity of the rice was...ahh well, let it be.
I went there again with a friend last October& decided to conform to the basics..as the au courant man often says-"While in Rome, do as Romans do". I ordered three continental dishes back to back, each of which oozed with class, style& loads of substance. I am emphasizing on 'substance' purely because the dishes- chicken pavlograd, lamb steak& fish diana were a class apart, unlike anything I had gulped down before. The pavlograd was loaded with cheese, veggies, mushrooms& other goodies within a thick, deep fried crust of chicken& came with boiled vegetables. If you are on a diet, beware; this dish would make your calorie- count sky- rocket to abominable levels! The meat steak was also very good, but tasted bland once it went cold. The piping hot fish was exceptional too. There was a deep feeling of contentment once I was through. These are the dishes (apart from the rest of the continental fare) that define the aura, grandeur& legacy of the legendary restaurant& needless to say, you should well know by now what to order when you visit Mocambo the next time. Two highly contrasting experiences in one calendar year, both memorable ones, again for contrasting reasons! 
I will conclude by saying that not for nothing does the average Kolkatan 'swear by Mocambo'..Give it a shot (if you already haven't given it one)..It is indeed worth it.

Excellent food quality..but had to wait approx 45min before entering and anothr 15min to actually get d food ! Also the service is very poor, we ordered for 2 starters and 1 main course but had to ate in one small plate only..nobody actually attended to fill up the sauce bowl or the glass with water..and at last during payment the waiter was irritaringly asking for tips and passing foul comments which not at all goes with the stature of the restaurant..I will give 5 star for food and 1 for service and management..

An overburden of emotions! Lingering of names of many unknown dishes and utterly sweet reviews by my grandparents! That summarizes my view before visiting the restaurant. 

Then on a fine Sunday I was invited by one of my most respected college senior for a small family gathering. And god I was excited! The atmosphere as well as the ambiance was filled with energy. And after leaving the restaurant I would say it is great not to visit the place with these predetermined thoughts and a free mind and outlook for this place would do best!

I visited this place in evening and it was already crowded at around 7:30 pm. Good though that we got a place to sit and start seeing the aftermath of incoming crowd. The best thing about the restaurant was the menu. It is no doubt an elaborate one. And my senior, a veteran of the place had identified great platters for the dinner.

We had Chicken a-la Kiev and Fish a-la Diana and Chicken Orientale a-la Mocambo at the start. And the flavor and taste of some of them is still lingering in my mouth. However, when came the part, where we ordered the sizzlers, it was not so great. There was not much variety of flavor in the fish steak that we ordered and monotony grabbed us in the end.

I would again say that one should not be biased before visiting the restaurant with old memories and thoughts and be there as you would try a new one on the block. This place still has a lot to offer in its cards and a great brunch or dinner could be planned readily anytime.

Nothing really left to place a review for Mocambo...
Before lot of my foodie friends have already done this before...

But I can share my experience, which is really very good..

This is the ultimate of continentals . . .

With no doubts it is serving quality of continentals challenging with other restaurants in Park Street from a lot years ago..
and succeeded to create a history of tradition in its own..

And there is a new fact that, Mocambo own the "Certificate of Excellence 2013"

If you want :-
Comfort..
Tradition..
Delicacy..
& 
Quality..  together

then Mocambo is really one of the best. . .

Normally i do not re-review restaurants... especially ones where i have had negative experiences but this time I am compelled to. Mocambo not only used to be my favorite outlet, giving it a negative review was hurtful to me as well .

I have literally grown up on mocambo and have always sworn by their chicken a la kiev, chicken imperial, fish a la diana and mixed grill.

I had very bad experiences the last few times but last week i was invited for dinner to mocambo for a friend's anniversary and i was pleasantly surprised. My faith in them is re instilled. The service was brilliant and the food was even better. I loved the deviled crabs and the cannelloni was melting in the mouth just like it used to be ages ago .

Although the baked alaska was still disappointing. People who have had the Baked Alaska 20 years ago will agree with me on this .

Park street its a street that never sleeps.... its life of kolkata. Whenever I visit Park Street its always a confused situation which restaurant to go & I always end up selecting MOCAMBO & it brings smile on my face "Mocambo khush hua".
Food at its best not yet found any any restaurant who serve such amazing continental food in entire India.
Money wise I always feel its worth paying the amount if you get something which satisfy your soul from inside & thats why never complain on that. I have tried all the sizzlers but my favorite is Chipolata. Prawn cocktail is a must try and Horn D' Oeuvres is to die for. Now comes to main course if you are a fish lover then try Fish aladian & florentine. Its really tough to suggest the best dish but one must try the angel's on horse back and Chicken tetrazzini. Steaks are amazing. If you are n Indian food lover then Indian kebabs & dishes are equally good. 
Its a place even after your 100th visit you will never get bore I can assure you that. People keep Complaining about the waiting period but nothing to say they are the best that's the reason they have crowd & space is limited. So I will suggest who really need to visit please be thr before time. They lack on few points but everythng can be forgiven once you get the amazing food. Thanks !! Keep the good work
My favourite since from childhood it will remain till i die...

In the Midst of bustling Park street, across the road from the legendary Flury's, stands this other place that serves decent continental food. Their range of food on the menu is appreciable, and there is justice done to a lot of it on the menu. You shouldn't try to compare the preparations with food that you may have eaten out of the country in the west, because it caters to the local taste buds looking for some good continental food. They cook their meats well, letting it be succulent, and sauces and dressings are tasty too. Could get here with friends and family and savor some good continental food, and have a great time!

How can i allow the winter to pass by without gorging on continental food? And if one has to have continental in Kolkata then the go-to place is the Golden Oldie-Mocambo.
In this visit we had a mix of Indian kebabs and their signature continental dishes. Along with drinks- Johnie Walker Red label and Rum Collins cocktail, we had their specialty Murg Firdosi kebab and the Mutton Peshawari kebab.Words and a liberal dose of adjectives will still be inadequate to describe the two dishes.I mean they were out of this world.Rocking start to our meal i must say.
In the mains my friend had the Lobster Augustine and yours truly had the fish steak.As usual tough to find fault with bot the dishes.Fish used-top notch quality,cheese sauce and the cheese stuffing in the lobster was delicious.
Though we had plans to try out the Baked alaska for dessert, we gave it a pass as we were quite full.
An evening well-spent and a meal worth remembering.
This is my  second review  based on a recent visit and is a follow-up of my earlier review. Substantial improvement on several aspects is what comes to mind if i am asked to summarise my experience. 
Firstly the courteous behaviour of the staff and not the earlier snooty types, comfortable seating for stags, being allotted a spacious table unlike the earlier cramped and tiny two-seater ones and last but not the least serving drinks in the appropriate glass. So far so good.
Now coming on the main topic of discussion of what else - food of course!!!On this visit we decided to stick to the heritage and hot favourite continental dishes. To start off we ordered the surf and turf-grilled version.My friend loves his food hot and spicy and thus opted for the pepper sauce. The dish comprised of a  beef steak and a couple of mid-sized prawns placed on top of it. Boiled veggies on the sides completed the dish.The presentation was nice though we found the steak to be slightly tough and chewy .Thus faced a torrid time dissecting it with a steak knife.The good old fish steak was delicious and just perfect.In fact every bite of the steak served in a creamy sauce( dunno know the name though) was pure bliss.The beckty used was of top-notch quality. In fact continental food lovers flock to Mocambo to sample such dishes and have been doing so since 1956.Next item was another heritage dish-Angels on Horseback.This is a customised version and not to be confused with the  original dish that comprises of oyster wrapped in bacon.Here they serve cubes of chicken wrapped in bacon and is served on a bed of sweet tangy basmati rice( instead of risotto-once again Indianised) that also had generous amount of mushrooms, boiled veggies and sauted onion. Very filling dish and yummy.Loved it. Next on the target list was another old gem-Chicken Chipolata.This dish will surely make a true meat lover fall in love with it. A huge breast of chicken, sausages,bacon, buttered veggies-it packs quite a punch indeed.
The special of the day was Lobster Augustine.This dish comprises of a huge lobster with a generous stuffing of spaghetti, cheese sauce,mushroom and boiled veggies on the side. I did not taste the dish since i am allergic. and had packed it for my my folks. They found it to be awesome. This dish is slightly spicier as compared to the equally famous lobster thermidor.

My humble word of advice  would be to stick to three dishes for the main course and have a dessert to wrap up the meal.There are adequate options in the dessert section too-though am yet to try them out.Baked Alaska is an obvious item to order since they are experts in it. This should be more than sufficient for a couple.People who are accustomed to having Indian dishes get it all messed up while ordering at Mocambo. Here each dish is a complete meal in itself and the portions of meat/fish are substantial and thus very filling.The Indian dishes are pretty decent too but let's leave them for discussion for some other day.
Truth be told- Park Street is known as Food Street due to the much famed trio. Mocambo for Continental cuisine, Peter Cat for Indian cuisine- incidentally both have the same owner(Nitin Kothari) and Bar-B-Q for Chinese cuisine. I guess not many foodies will dispute that.

----- 29 Jan, 2014 -----

Experience of my first visit to the joint was a "mixed bag".First the good part.The food was pretty good considering the variety that we had opted for.Indian starters-Mutton Seekh kebab and the unique Murgh Firdosi kebab were really juicy and succulent. For the main course the steaks-Pork Sirloin,Beef  Steak and Chicken Steak was surprisingly very consistent and good.Given the fact, many continental food joints  tend to serve chewy and stale meat-especially pork and beef, this was a pleasant surprise.Perhaps we were lucky on that day!!!

Now the bad part.Be prepared to be treated like shit if you do not have a lady accompanying you.I witnessed a father and son duo being denied family seats because the staff thought that the duo did not define a family sans a woman.Weird but true!!!
The seating for stags is very cluttered,uncomfortable and the tables are tiny.Waiters are not attentive and have to be reminded to fill up the glasses with drinking water.Service is slow and some amount of barking will ensure that you get the desired attention.Last but not the least the crockery needs a serious overhaul.Drinks and water are served in glasses that  you would find in a roadside tea stall.Well folks who reside in Kolkata may find the service to be normal and usual, but for me who has always stayed outside Kolkata, service at a joint like Mocambo which has been in existence for perhaps half a century needs to be classy.

Brief: Mocambo khush hua. Sounds like a dangerous place? No its not. Haha. Not a purely non vegetarian place too.  

I had visited this top restaurant as listed in zomato's restaurant list today. I have been hearing most of the bengali's saying i want to go mocambo, i love mocambo, mocambo is my favorites. So, this review is dedicated to them on a special priority too. :) 

What is Mocambo? 
As i had visited Peter cat which is situated near the Au bon Pain, park street, i decided to give Mocambo a visit which is situated bang opposite to new Pizza Hut n subway. When i visited this place, it was jam packed and the manager was writing the name in the waiting list. I am sorry to say that his coat was looking very improper and dirty. After waiting for half an hour, i somehow got a place. I thought i have come to the sister concern of peter cat. The red velvet sofa seats having the look of bulbs as same as peter cat mesmerised me. However, what i noticed is that there are orange and red lights in Mocambo. However, much better ambience was there at peter cat. Nevertheless, when i was served the a la carte, i thought it was somewhat like a menu which is been going around since years just the usual like peter cat. However, i preferred looking at the peter cat a la carte. Well, the first thing which i thought when i was made to sit in Mocambo was "crampy". There was nothing sort of privacy when you sit with a friend or partner as all the tables are so so close just to accomodate which i personally did not like. As it was a first time experience at Mocambo, i hardly could relate to the a la carte. For this reason, i had asked their steward to help me with the same. The thing i noticed here is people were not as friendly as they were in Peter Cat and Bar B Q. Secondly, the service is not prompt. They take a lot of time to serve. 
 
You might be thinking why i gave this restaurant a 4? Yes, i will tell you. Have patience. 

Food description: 

As i sat in the seat, i had placed an order for :- 

1) Veg Surprise( For Vegetarians who thought Mocambo is just non vegetarian) - I personally tasted this dish and it turned out to be lovely. It had all vegetables sauted in their special sauce served with rice and cheese. It was damn yummy and the food just changed my view. Its a saying ' Dont judge a book by its cover and thats what Mocambo is.' The sauce was damn tasty and i would like to thank the steward for suggesting me the same. 
2) Murg Firdosa Bari Kebab - It was a very very unique concept of kebab out here in Mocambo. It had a outer soft chicken layer and inside there were minced chicken cooked in their special way. It was yumm. The second thing which i loved was the green chutney. I have become a fan of Mocambo. 
3) Chicken Paprika - Boneless small chicken pieces cooked in a very different sauce comprising of cream and served along with their special cooked rice, boiled potatoes, carrots and beans. It was damn damn damn damn damn good. I loved the chicken sauce. 

Pros:-
1) Located at prime area
2) Food quality is super
3) Food presentation is outstanding
4) Prices are as per the standards
5) Serves alcohol too. 
6) Ambience is fine. 

Cons:-
1) Service takes time. 
2) Crampy when made to sit together. 
3) Staffs are not as friendly as should be. 
4) A la carte requires a change. It is too outdated now. 

Suggestions:-
1) Menu should be changed
2) Should not be made to sit in a crampy way just to earn mere profit
3) Service should me much more prompt
4) Staffs and stewards should be courteous

Summary:(For those who does not want to read long review)
Food presentation 5/5
Food quality 4/5
Food quantity 4/5
Service 3/5
Ambience 4/5 
Hospitality 4/5
Little pocket pinching price. 1000 rupees approximately for 2. 

Conclusion: A good place to chill around with friends. Little costly but worth it. Worth all the wait. Planning to revisit it for its famous sizzler. :) Satisfied totally. (As food made it up)

I came here for a normal sunday brunch and had to wait for 1 hr flat just to get in. That aside, everything about the meal was great.

The menu is quite elaborate and interesting. We started with Devilled Crab which came in the shell of the crab itself and was yummm! in fact I am craving for another plate of it as I'm writing this!

Next came the main course...I ordered a queer combination of prawn and beef steak sizzler called surf and turf in pepper sauce and my friend had chicken a-la-kiev. Both the dishes were well rounded and filling. For dessert there was orange souffle which was exceptionally light and zesty. 

The staff is courteous and the ambience has a charm to it. I think if we don't go in with the baggage of huge expectations from years of hearing about it from our parents/relatives/seniors (the list is literally endless), we'll enjoy Mocambo for just what it is...a restaurant that serves great food with a charm!

There is nothing new about this place that  almost every Kolkatan has not felt or said. If you're a tourist make it a point to dine hear. The service is as excellent as the food. Especially the Chickrn Chipolata or the Shepherd's Pie. One suggestion, do avoid Mughlai or Indian but their Continental fare is the best you will find in the city. :)

I am a fan of continental food and last day I happen to visit mocambo with a friend, we ordered two dishes chicken pavlogadro and devil's crab with garlic toast ( which was very disappointing ). But the devils crab was so good that i could hardly complain about the dishes which were not upto the mark. I wish to visit mocambo again just for the devils crab, if you are cheese and mayo fan, its a must try, very filling too!

One of the heritage of Calcutta, located in the midst of busy streets of Park Street. Also, my first preference whenever I feel like eating something in and around Park Street.
2 of my all time favorites that I never fail to order is their Chicken Steak and the Chicken Pavlograd.
The chicken Steak comes with mushroom sauce and its awlays perfectly grilled with the vegetables baked with the right amount of heat.
The Chicken Pavlograd oozes butter the moment you try to dig into it. 
Also try the Fish Florentine if you are more fond of seafood.

Well this is one of those places one should put on their bucket list when they are visiting kolkata....I have been here last with my family and the dining experience was truly memorable....

This is a heaven for continental lovers....one MUST try the Devilled Crab...it is an absolute delight.....couldn't stop ourselves from ordering seconds....then comes the Prawn Cocktail. The Chicken Ala Kiev, the Baked Fish and the choices of sizzlers....

The ambience of the restaurant is quite pleasing and lives up to its heritage....and the service is quite decent too...
Basically, its a place to dine-out and just simply enjoy and celebrate the food...and the name that is Mocambo!!

Food quality is quite good - of course if you choose Continental. Non-Conti food is just average. And service is just terrible !!! Shows why Kolkata is lagging so far behind in the India map. They simply don't care ... will just throw the dishes somehow on the table. They don't deserve even ten bucks tips.

My mother literally grew up eating at this restaurant and so did I. For us, Mocambo is a tradition, a nostalgia confused place. The fish muniere and devilled crab are to die for. Every time I have outstation guests visiting the city, Mocambo is a must-visit. The owner personally inquires about your likes and dislikes- which says a lot about the service. And it definitely helps that he is pretty pleasing to the eye.Keep up the great work Mocambo!

Quite decent food. I didn't like the much hyped crab. I was not able to find any crab flavour as well as can meat in the dish, though the presentation was good. The oriental chicken with rice also did not impress us. The service is good after you enter the restaurant. Till then it is a nightmare. 

Though it is good to have da one time experience, I think not worth the money.

Food is very good hear especially the continental dishes. But in spite of having so many waiters the service is poor. I had to wait a lot of time before they took my order, served my dish, and lastly gave me the bill. Ambiance is quite good, the place is filled with tables leaving out very less spaces between tables. Your privacy may be hampered. Leaving some on the Pros the place is quite good and its a part of Old Kolkata Food. In weekends you might just have to wait. But lastly all comes down to the food which is quite good. Must Visit.

Mocambo is one of those all-time favorite restaurant that has been standing for years in Park Street. The restaurant has its own goodwill and is on Zomato's top list from quite some time. This 1st January, I decided to have my lunch here after coming back to Kolkata after a vacation.

The restaurant serves North Indian, Mughlai, Continental and Italian cuisines. It is best known for its kebabs and other north Indian food. The Chicken Kebabs and main course dishes are good enough to give a try. Fish kebabs and main course is also available which is equally good. Recommendations are, Tandoori Chicken, Fish Kebab and any Chicken main course. Chicken Biryani is also good and breads such as Naan is good in size. The restaurant also specializes in Sizzlers and gives a tough competition to its adjacent Peter Cat. So a sizzler is also good for a cold day. Desserts are standard and nothing special.

Prices are kept high simply because of the good name of the restaurant but it is fine as long as your taste-buds enjoy. Service is sluggish, the food is served to you after a wait of about 20-25 minutes and even plates are given much later after you are seated. Waiting time for the restaurant was 30 minutes (today 1st January) which is far better than Peter Cat's crowd, but I don't think it is the same on a typical weekday. There is ample of seating capacity in the restaurant, however the tables are very small leading to congestion. Chairs are comfortable though. Aesthetics of the restaurant cant be complained as it is beautifully decorated with dim lighting and an aquarium. The toilet however is an unexpected nasty surprise, it is comparable to those K.M.C. paid toilets. There are no soaps, tissues, hand dryers and even good sanitary units.

Overall impression on this restaurant is that Mocambo used to have its good name but they are constantly loosing it to other competitors in Park Street. It is very much visible by the lowering footfall day by day. They should not try improvising their food as it is already sufficient however they need to concentrate on the services and aesthetics to give competitors a tough time.

Bad behavior and denial of entry to a customer's driver has made me take away the good points from my review. There are other, less discriminatory restaurants in Kolkata that serve great food!

Pas Review:

                So this happens to be my most favorite Park Street Restaurant. So please know very well that I am totally biased about it. The reason that I am biased is obviously the food, the ambiance, the heritage and the style. I have tried it all...Chicken Tetrazzini, Chipolata, Angel on Horseback, you name it. Oh and all of these are recommended. If you like fish, do try out the Bekti Munier! It is veyr very good. You may also want to try the Prawn Cocktail here because it is simply delicious. I have never tried anything apart from continental at this place because I have never been able to cure my love of these dishes that I have already mentioned. The only hitch is perhaps the beer mugs which are made of steel. Maybe it is part of their decor but I do not like it!

Please do try this place out if you want to try Kolkata continental food!

We went for dinner on 23rd December, and as was to be expected waited for 45 minutes to get seated! Now, while I've not too a great opinion of the food here I was in for a pleasant shock. We started by ordering the Deviled Crabs which are quite famous here… It was absolutely delicious!! I don’t know why I've not tried it before. It’s this creamy cheesy crab meat, so you just have to scoop it out without getting messy. And if it tastes this good on such a crowded night, its surely commendable! We also tried a kebab recommended by the order taker, nargisi kebab but it was totally bland. It was a cashew nut & chicken mince but we didn't get the taste of either things. For the main course we ordered Grilled Chicken, Ham Steak sizzler, Fish Steak sizzler and Spaghetti Bolognese…
The first two items were superb!! The fish was quite smelly and the Bolognese quite frankly looked like brown gravy with some spaghetti floating in and tasted equally bad…
This is the second time we were ordering fish here and both the times the fish was smelly…
So over all great value for money but stay away from the fish!! The reason for the 4 star rating is the price :)

The management mentioned that I had to wait for half an hour to 45 mins in order to be seated.After an hour of waiting he still  was unsure of the waiting time and started giving excuses .Mocambo has no value for time and no respect for customers and  this place by far has the worst management I have ever encountered! Frustrated and hungry I left the place,went to Tung Fung the restaurant beside Mocambo.Tung Fung instead had really good customer service,got seated within 10 minutes of waiting   and of course the food was simply delicious!!!! 1 of the best Indo-Chinese restaurants in Kolkata.

In short,Mocambo Sucks!!!

Mocambo is named after the famous nightclub  in West Hollywood, California, on the Sunset Strip, by the same name. Mocambo is one of the older restaurants in Calcutta and needs no introduction.

I love most of their dishes, particular favourites being the sizzlers and the devil crab. The Punjabi stuff is great as well. Another speciality of theirs is Baked Alaska - one of the last places in Calcutta which serve this dessert.

A place which is a must for all seasons.

My college is on park street so I am familiar with most of the restaurants, but I had never seen Mocambo and wondered where it was located. well my wish was granted when one afternoon me and a couple of my friends went there for a late lunch. it was almost four in the afternoon, so i thought most items would be unavailable as it frequently happens in most restaurants!! Also I had hoped Mocambo to be posh and not so promising like another overrated park street restaurant and a neighbour to mocambo but I was surprised to find that it had continental and north indian food both!! 
The ambiance is extremely nice, lives upto the old world charm that it commands. the service is good, it is quite prompt. we had tandoori chicken, mutton biryani and a chicken side dish. the food was quite good. the biriyani handi might look small but they provide an enormous amount at a reasonable price.  over all a nice place to have a laid back lunch or dinner. I would say it lives up to its name more than its more famed and overrated neighbour.

I read a lot of reviews about Mocambo,about its continental food,north indian  food ,ambience etc.
I was eager about visiting this place.Finally on the Christmas day i visited Mocambo with my family.It was a special experience.the food was scrummy.We ordered alot of dishes ,but not a single dish dissapointed us.we started with"CHICKEN TETRAZZINI ",and "CHICKEN STROGANOFF".These two dishes were sublime .Then we also tried some authentic NORTH INDIAN foods, "STUFFED TANDOOR CHICKEN " WITH "GARLIC NAN" was a deadly combo altogether.Then we  opted for deserts,we had "SOUFFLE ALA SURPRISE MOCAMBO" .It has two flavours chocolate and orange .Both are exceptional.Ambience is dazzling.
Its a  paradise for
 continental food.
Talking abou the cons,
the service is not extraordinary,we waited alot after ordering.
The prices are on higher side too.

I went to Mocambo on a very special dinner with my family and I loved it! It was my first time to Mocambo and I had high hopes from it after hearing so much about it from friends, colleagues and all. It's not even a year that I am here in Kolkata and visiting Mocambo and Peter Cat were some of the things which I wanted to do after coming to this town! So, here is a short review of this place:

Food: We had ordered Hawks BayPrawn Cocktail and Crab Meat Cocktail for the Starters. After finishing these two in a few seconds, we ordered a Tandoori Chicken and trust me, it was yummilicios! I rarely had this kind of juicy, tender and yumm tandoori chicken in my life and I have become a fan of Tandoori Chicken of Mocambo. For the main course, we all ordered different cuicines but I had Chicken Steak sizzler! I have no words for the dish! Its another delicacy which one should absolutely try once in Mocambo. Although I badly wanted to have Chicken a la kiev, I couldnt manage the guts of ordering it after reading on the menu card that it will be full of butter! (I am on a diet these days!) but I have promised myself to vsit Mocambo again just to try Chicken a la kiev!

Ambience: It was very stuffed and we had to wait for an hour to get our table. Apart from this waiting thing, everything else about the place is nice. The cosy atmosphere makes one feel comfortable and the dimmed light was adding to the beauty of the place. 

Service: The ones serving the dishes were very polite and courteous. They were always with a smile on their face and even helped us order the best food!

Over all Experience: I have loved the evening spent with my family and I loved my visit to Mocambo! I am looking forward to go there once more in the near future! Kudos to their yummy food!

One of my favorite places to eat in kolkata. Still preserving the Old Charm of Kolkata on Park Street, Mocambo defines Continental Cuisine. I dont know which one to leave and which one to write about, everything on the menu is amazing. You can start of with their amazing prawn cocktail, which is amazing with your drinks, if you are more into their speciality continental cuisine,  you have a variety of dishes to choose from, my favs are chicken tetrezzini and fish florantine. Both of these are quite filling......if you want something exquisite, try their lobster thermidore....it is to die for. and after this hearty meal finish with their cherry in fresh whipped cream. The restaurant is a perfect mood lifter and still one of the best in the city.

I definitely agree with the fact that you serve real good Continental, for which me and my wife drive a long distance and come. The fact that I fail to understand is that the guys in suits who takes the order has real big time attitude problems, mainly the new folks. Please learn some customer Service & mainly manners. You display an arrogance in your attitude, is that because you have a lot of people coming in every day? Don't do that, its going to affect your business.

Places like Mocambo are all time classics. No matter how many time you visit you end up ordering almost the same things. I don't know whether its restricted only to me or not, but I find it very hard to deviate from a list of 4-5items in this place
1. Chicken Sicilliene
2.Chicken Supreme
3. Mocambo steak
4. Spaghetti carbonara, not the best in town but does it for me at least

The staff though could do better in managing their guest. That is a let down for me and where i think lot of improvement can b done.

One more drawback of this place is u need to wait way too long for your food

Staff is in-courteous and here's my experience that explains the Avoid rating-
-The restaurant staff doesnt bother to look at your table and you need to wave or shout to get their attention when you need to order something or ask for the menu card.
-If you order Indian Whisky, they serve in normal water-drinking glasses. No scotch glass.
-They serve beer in bottles. You need to request them to provide you with a beer mug.
-Beer bottles are just kept on the table and left, without even asking if you want the beer to be poured in the mug or not.
If you are looking for a nice family outing, this is not the place to be. This does not count as a fine dining restaurant.

We are new to Kolkata, and had heard about Mocambo much. Sunday lunch time, we were happy to have to wait for around 10 mins. The ambience of the place and attitude are both old world. Seating was comfortable though the tables seemed too close to one another. We didn't benefit even after asking for recommendations from the staff.

Tried the cream of mushroom soup, which tasted good. Though the chopped mushroom in it felt a little doughy. For main course we had spaghetti in red sauce and vegetable cannelloni.  Our request to add some black olives and mushroom to the spaghetti was turned down. The red sauce in both dishes was similar. It seemed a little over cooked  and didn't have any fresh herb taste. Cannelloni was good but spaghetti did seem a tad boring. We skipped the dessert as veg options were few. 

For all the hype, I found the place to be average. Only relief was that it is not hugely overpriced. I am not sure if we would feel like returning to the place.

After a pretty long time I went to mocambo for dinner. I ordered for fish steak (mocambo's best). First of all they took some where around half an hour to deliver the food. The food quality has gone down like anything. I had fish steak previously and it was amazing. But what I had today is disgusting. After getting such pathetic service and not at all good food, I really have to remove Mocambo from my favorites.

After the lady's Facebook post went viral I felt it was my duty to let Mocambo know that not only is their food deteriorating but their service quality has hit rock bottom.


Each and every time I visit Mocambo I have to deal with a dilemma. A dilemma of choosing that day's main course. There really is a lot to choose from. Make sure that you start with the devilled crabs. You will love it if you enjoy spicy food. Now begins the dilemma. What do I order? I love the chcken tetrazzini, the ala keiv, the pork shnitzel, the tenderloin steak, the beckti muniere. Man there are too many to choose from. Oh did I mention the risotto di scampi, the ham steak, the yorkshire prok chops! Make sure you try the meringue and the baked alaska. The only other restaurant other than La Terasse at The Oberoi Grand to serve the baked alaska. The decor is once again old school and the garb of the staff is as old school as it gets. Once again like peter cat the service is a little high handed at times and the staff especially the maitre'd s and stewards can often be arrogant. Otherwise there are really not many negative things to say about this place. Go there order your food enjoy your company maybe with a a drink or two and get lost in the world of amazing old school Kolkata continental cusine. Oh and North Indian too.

I never ventured into Mocambo until recently,so I do not share the nostalgia and fondness of many other Kolkatans. Their continental fare is so highly praised that I have been mostly tempted to finish off the continental selection in my multiple visits.All of the dishes I have tasted have been consistently delicious,though not to-the-T authentic always.For me,Consistency is the hallmark of excellence. That is what Mocambo serves you,each time,unfailingly.
One of the best parts about this restaurant remains the cosy sofas,and the soft romantic lighting.You can enjoy a whole meal alone over here engrossed in the beautiful lampshades and soft warm glow of the lights.
The service over here is relaxed and informal,makes you feel  comfortable.
After trying much of the continental fare,Angels on Horse Back and Chicken Cordon Bleu remains my top picks.Risottos and the tetrazzini is undoubtedly good,but I will  always remain smitten by Tetrazzini from Moulin Rouge's. 
To finish off the meal I prefer the light,soft souffle,though the Baked Alaska is a good choice too.
Definitely worth a visit,more so because of the light pocket-pinch.

I hadn't had continental for quite a while, the last time being 2 years back in Siliguri. So I called my friend up and asked her to suggest a place known for their continental. She suggested Mocambo. We arrived at 3 on a sunday afternoon. The place was jampacked . But luckily we just had to wait for only 15 minutes without having to queue up. Once inside, the first thing I noticed was that the tables were too close to eachother. We sat down at the table and the waiter arrived in about ten minutes. I wanted to have a soup so we ordered Cream of Asparagus. The soup was brought within ten minutes. It was a bit heavy, had a dense texture. But it tasted quite good.

For the main course I ordered the Chicken a la Kiev because I had read reviews about it being one of their signature dishes. My friend, also my date for the afternoon, ordered the Fish a la Diana. The food arrived after around 40 minutes. So yes, service does tend to be a bit slow. But once it arrived we realised the wait was worthwhile. Once I dug my fork into the chicken breast, out came the warm butter. The sauce on the side was too good, with the right blend of sweet and sour. A small amount of pasta they serve with the chicken serves as the right contrast. The mashed potatoes, the boiled peas and carrots just about go with it.

On the other side of the table the Fish a la Diana smelled quite well though it didn't look as appealing as the Kiev. Well my friend was generous enough to let me taste it. It was great even though I couldn't make out the fish with which it was prepared. Both the dishes left us full but we still decided to try desserts., Almond Soufle and Chocolate Soufle. Not very sweet, light, which is good since we were already so full. And that was that. Well, it was a good experience. Definitely made an impression. Always looking forward to going there again.

This is my first choice to eat out, always!
Mocambo is quite an old restaurant where food is no wonder top quality and the portions served are equally great. Dishes like Chicken A La Kiev, Pork Cutlet, Fish Muniere, Chicken Muniere, Fish A La Diana, Chicken Pavlograd, Steaks and many other such delectable items are found here! They taste so good that a foodie would definitely want to eat and try all that’s there in the Mocambo menu! Apart from some wonderfully prepared, strict Continental dishes, they also serve Indian food and has a fat bar loaded with labels. The staffs are really well-groomed and lift up the environment quite a lot. The ambiance is that of calm and personal with no rapid music in the background. The food and the whole experience is an uncompromised satisfaction! You’ll always leave with a promise to return! 

I had been there on my last birthday and had the pork cutlet....
The restaurant by itself a reason to go there!

Mocambo! Ah! Well, to be very honest the place where it's situated it's always so difficult to choose which one to enter finally. The competition is immense here with peter cat, bar b q, flurys, pizza hut, etc etc surrounding this place. Nevertheless, Mocambo is always one of my favorites in the city.

The ambiance here is magnificent. You can get both Indian and Continental food here. The quality of food is undoubtedly very superior with the continental slightly overtaking the Indian dishes. The soups and spaghetti is delicious. 

My advice: If you really like continental food, this is one of the best places in the city.

From what i heard, Mocambo is counted among the top 5 must-visits in Park Streets. Now coming from a middle class family, trying out all the classic restaurants in Park Street was somewhat  inconvenient for myself! But to my own surprise when i was walking towards the exit door after having a satisfying meal from Mocambo..i definitely felt content! To break it down....
1.  The ambiance is palatially soothing! An unknown nostalgic feeling gets hold of you once you're in!! Although the glass-plates' quality were merely average & disappointing! And its a request to the owners to do something about those big-ugly stand-fans! total kill-joys they are!
2. Service was a little slow..my friends had to ask for water  quite a few times.
3. The food...even if as SOMEWHAT OVERPRICED they are, the food was marvelous!! I had to taste d Biriyani from my friend's plate..It had d exact Hyderabadi-fragrance with the texture of badshahi pulao.The Tanduri Sizzler & their special item Chicken mocambo were too good! but the Chicken Kebab Masala and the Murgh Mussalm were just average.
..the next i'll be aiming for a more 'continental-approach'!

For sizzlers or steaks and other continental dishes, Mocambo is the place.
Been here only once and it was truly brilliant. Best beef steak I have ever had. The meat is tender and delicious. The sizzlers here are only second to Peter Cat. Absolutely amazing in every way.

Thanks to the featured review by Apala, i just realised that i haven't yet appreciated mocambo and this review for mocambo being my 83rd and 287th for the place comes with feeling of lots of guilt!! 

Mocambo was incorporated in 1956 and is a legend in this industry. It means for continental food exactly what bar-b-q and peter cat mean for chinese and north indian cuisines. I feel park street is what it is, a lot for this trio !!!! 

Located near on track restaurant on park street, its a big and spacious restaurant. The decor is very nice with overhead lightings for each table. The sofa seats are a bit unique but very comfortable. The best part about mocambo is that inspite of the rush, they haven't congested the sitting space. I dint know it earlier but recently discovered that they take their last order at 11.15 which is a big plus and there was a queue till 11.00, if i noticed it correct, which speaks volumes of its popularity!! The staff is polite, courteous and service is pretty fast which is a given !!!

They serve indian and continental food and i prefer the latter. The sizzlers is loved by everybody but alas, there is a single option on the menu for vegetarians. Vegetable steak sizzler is one of my all time favorite sizzlers. Their continental offers are pretty vast and my favorites being the vegetable tetrazzini, macaroni cheese gratin, rissotto parmigiana. Indian food is decent though my last experience did not go so well but i can go with it !!! I love cream of corn soup served here which is rare   since almost all other places serve sweet corn soup. Baked alaska is my favorite for the dessert. The pricing is very reasonable and would surprise anyone visiting here for the first time.

Mocambo introduced me to continental food when i was a kid and has not disappointed me ever !!

I have to admit that its sad that even after spending all my life in this city, it took me quite a while to visit this legendary place. So when a friend suggested Mocambo for lunch, I immediately agreed ! The ambiance was lovely...old world charm redefined. The lighting, the overhead lamps, the cozy seating.....it was delightful ! :) Now coming to the food. My friend ordered his favourite- the Chicken Cordon Bleu while I went for something rather unusual- Spaghetti with Meat Balls.....a Continental speciality. My friend also ordered a Beer while I settled for a Fresh Lime Soda.

The drinks arrived fast....But the food did take a while. Service was a bit slow, but the moment the food arrived, the wait seemed worth it. My plate of Spaghetti had the perfect amount of cheese and was drizzled with olive oil. The meat balls were soft and tender and tasted awesome ! It was a filling meal all by itself....and a delicious one at that ! My friend took one bite of the Chicken cordon bleu and his reaction was enough to tell me that he was in foodie heaven ! The oozing cheese from the chicken fillet....it looked simply yummy.
I was too full to try any dessert. :( Reading all the lovely reviews here makes me wanna go back and try out all the special dishes ! Till then, 4 stars from me. :)

Well.. We went with the idea of a Sunday brunch with fine Italian cuisine. Had to stand in a queue for half an hour and got a table. After ordering the food we had to wait for almost an hour before the food finally arrived. I must say we were totally bored and frustrated waiting and we were hungry as hell. But we couldn't complain as the food was worth the wait. Totally yummy Italian food. The Chicken Paprika was a stunner as well as the Chicken Tetrazzini.. Added to that was the Italian style Prawns in Garlic herb with a tangy sauce which was an absolute delight to the tastebuds. Just order some fine wine along with your food and you will not be disappointed

Each time I come home to Kolkata for vacations, a visit to Mocambo makes it complete. It is my favourite restaurant in Park Street. The decor is simple and warm, with the beautiful over-head lamps and comfortable leather seats.

Being highly inclined towards continental food, I have never tried the Indian items on the menu, but I hope they are as good as the continental that they serve. Their Prawn Cocktail  is probably one of the best that I have had in the city. Its creamy, tangy, delightfully chilled and loaded with lot of prawns. The other variation of this dish is the Crab meat Cocktail which is equally delightful.

The main attraction of Mocambo is their steak. I have tasted all the ones they have on their menu, and I like Ham Steak Singapore the most. The juicy pineapple piece that is served with the steak is heart melting. Their Chicken Ala Kiev, Fish A la Diana, Chicken Tertrazzini, Chicken Pavlograd are some of the items that are to die for. 

I haven't had their desserts much, because each time I am so full with the starters and the main course that we decide to skip dessert. I did taste their Cream Caramel, which is a decent way to end a lip smacking meal.

All in all, a lovely place to drop in for a meal. Highly recommended!!

Whenever I feel like having Continental, there is no better place than Mocambo. I went there with my friend Susanta Bhattacharya , who is not very fond of Continental. We ordered 'Fish A La Diana' and 'Chicken Pavlograd', both my personal favorites. I just love their signature dishes 'Fish A La Diana' and 'Chicken Pavlograd'. Each item was just perfect! The chef knows what spices and herbs to add to make each dish delectable. Yummylicious I say. 'Chicken Pavlograd' was first to appear, an authentic dish with some superb flavours! Cutting 'Chicken Pavlograd' with a knife itself was soooo exciting. Tasted awesome, believe me!! We finished it in a jiffy...!! Next comes 'Fish A La Diana'.. Vetki stuffed with prawn, mushroom & some vegetables cooked in rich creamy white sauce.. tasted yummmyyyy!!!. Service is slow. However, the waiters and stewards are usually polite, and do try to speed up service when asked. My personal suggestion would be to throw caution to the wind and indulge in some rich heritage creaminess when in one is in the mood for it. Pricing is moderate and should not pinch you, considering the heritage value of the property and the amazing food.

Located at a decent and convinient location in park street its a fairly large restaurant with a good ambience specially i like the overhead lamps. :-)
Luckily i didnt have to wait behind a long queue as we were two.I ordered Mutton kebabs,Two irish beef steak, with one being the sizzler variety.Beer and the Baked Alaska.
The beef was tender and succulent,well made and prepared with all the correct spices and veggies around. The accompanying roasted potato was exquisite.And the meat definitely tasted amazing with the beer. The waiters were very helpful.But the service was a little slow.Maybe due to the huge crowd on the weekend. 
The baked alaska was one thing i have never had in my life .It was a surprising combination of cake,icecream with toppings and a tinge of spirit perfected to satisfy the dessert buds.I liked it as it was completely new.
Prices are average.more on the upper side i guess.Well it was around 1600 for two people.
Overall experience was very nice.A little different from any other conventional restaurants with the uncommon and exquisite names and dishes on menu.
Definitely Recommended.
Will be visiting again ....soon i hope!

Mocambo is an old time iconic restaurant in Park Street, and you can be sure of atleast a 30 minute waiting time on any given weekday.

The place offers a good dining experience, but falls short of expectations in terms of food quality. We ordered a sizzler and a continental dish for main course after some fish/mutton appetizers with beer. Everything was just average, and not good value for money. The sauces used in the sizzler did not appear to be freshly made.

I remember a visit 5-6 years back, and the food was definitely better. 

Had it not been for the ambiance, I would have given an even lower rating to the place.

AWESOME FOOD - is what sums up the Mocambo experience. Tucked away, in the Mecca of good food (i.e. Park Street), Its difficult to spot, but one great place to eat. A friend of mine had tagged along, to partake in the post-puja bingeing session, and we ended up having lunch here. We didn't go with the regular hors d'oeuvres in the menu, but ordered a fabulous Chicken Chipolata Sizzler to start off with the food fiesta. For the mains, we ordered Ham Steak Mushroom, which was equally delicious, and since we were quite hungry for more, we finished off with an absolutely heavenly cheese-cum-butter filled dish of Chicken Tetrazzini. We didnt try any of the desserts, though, but I'm saving it for the next time I'm there. Overall, here are the ratings : 
Taste :4.0
Quality : 4.5 (The bacon is simply amazing!)
Ambience: 4.0
Value for money : 4.0

A favorite dinner place. Been there over a dozen times in the last 6-7 months.  Have not tried the Indian and chinese, but we love the steaks and sizzlers. . Heritage dishes are worth trying out. Desserts are good, but doesn't live up to the deliciousness of the main course.

I have been having a great time exploring the city and experiencing culinary delights. The city has its own charm just like Bangalore. Mocambo is one place you get to hear about, the moment you step in Kolkata which brings with it a dose of contemporary culture. It is quite opulent by Kolkata standards. I got to know the place became more popular since Bollywood actress Vidya Balan was seen sipping coffee in the movie, Kahaani. 

The dimly lit ambience creates a cozy atmosphere. The old fashioned red leather scoop seats and hanging lampshades will not put you off but render a royal feeling. 

I ordered a chicken steak and grilled fish. The waft of steak was enough to entice me. 

However there are few quirks. People still visit the restaurant which is evident from the queues outside. They don’t make reservations and the regulars have been whining about the deteriorating quality.

Friday afternoon a Group of 3 of us Reach Mocambo by 1:09 Pm , We are Welcomed very politely and ushered to our table. We take 5-7 Mins to Place our order which comprises of 1 Veg Quin, 1 Veg Steak Sizzler,1Veg Cannelloni, 1Macroni Cheese Casserole and 1 Chicken Tetrazzini. By 1:20 pm our Ordering  was Complete.
Ten Mins Post The Steward comes up to the table to inform us that the Veg Starter Veg Quin is not available. Fair Enough.
We are Waiting ............ The Clock shows 1:56 pm now and there is no sight of the food so we politely ask the waiter about the whereabouts of the food and he has a blank face. So we wait another 5 minutes and ask for the Steward and politely request him for the same , To which his answer was he is checking and getting back .Fair enough . Ten Minutes Pass By and its 2:08 pm we cannot find the Steward who was supposed to get back to us on the same so we ask another Steward about the same and he turns around that there is a Labour Problem and Staff Shortage you will have to wait for your Food but i will try to get it fast , to which our reply was that its been over 45 mins and now you tell us that there is a staff problem you should not take tables then, He walks off.
Its Now 2:28 Pm and the Limit has been Crossed i Fire the gentlemen on the same matter and after 5mins he gets us the Steak and Cannelloni but there is no sight of the Macroni and Tetrazzini, to which the Steward's Reply is that its coming .
Its now 15 mins since part of the food has arrived and waiting on the table  The Chicken is nowhere in Sight and all i can see is one gentleman bringing in the Macroni.
Great , Now when we enquire about the Chicken he says its coming. Its now 2:50 pm and finally The Limits, I go up to Cash Counter and try and Find the Manager when i am juggled  around from one Steward to the other who god damn does not know what is happening.  Finally i Find the Manager Mr manek  who has no reply but is apologetic . But Now what is the use .
When i ask for the Owner's Contact Details i am told he is traveling outside India and we cannot let you contact him or help you with his phone Numbers,
I just walk out of the place leaving behind my credit card for the outlet to charge me ,
I get hold of the owners Name and Contact Number and i Call him . 
After a Full Length conversation on the same and giving him all the details he informs me that he is being Gracious enough not to charge me and i can have my card collected when he supposed to send it back , He cannot Send back the card as he facing Acute Staff Absenteeism. So i should have it collected . He is Arguing with me about the fact i should not have left my card there for them to charge me and he said he was  gracious enough not to charge me . My Point here is i did not go to eat for free and nor did i want his  graciousness to be extended. All I wanted is that i go order eat and pay and leave but there was sure a hue and cry on the same made out for no use that it seemed that they had done me a favor by not charging me.
Not a hint of Apology from the Owner only a bubble of EGO.
.

 The reason for me to write this and bring this up is just to highlight the fact that Establishments have spent generations to Build a name and goodwill in the country but the new generation  is not bothered as they have taken everything for Granted and are refusing to add professionalism  in their systems.

On the Contrary This is not at all the Case with other Restaurants on Park Street Like Barbq and Flavours of China , Kwality and Oasis all frequented by me as well and never have they given a chance for the customer to get upset.


It should be  taken note that unless you have 2 Hours to Spare without complaining you should not go to Mocambo to eat and you should not care about Service when you go as you have to make do with what they have to offer and they are not ready to do anything about it .

I have been visiting mocambo for what feels like forever. Whenever we go to park street, visiting mocambo is a must and I have yet to be disappointed. On weekends there can be a bit of a wait but it is most definitely worth it. Service is impeccable- prompt and hospitable. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming. And the food! It sends you packing straight to gastronomic heaven. The starters and soups are all very good though the cream of chicken soup can be a tad under seasoned. But that is easily fixed. The chicken Tetrazzini is so good that I end up ordering it almost every time I visit! The pork chops I once had were overcooked though. The fish ala diana is perfection itself. The desserts are all excellent especially the brownies with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce. The baked Alaska didn't really appeal to my palate though I know many people who have looked. All in all, visiting this Calcutta institution is an extremely pleasurable and a must visit for all tourists and Calcuttans alike. 
And I love the picture on the first page if the menu of a man eating accompanied by the message " there is no greater love than the live of eating". So true!

Had heard a lot about Mocambo from my peers and had gone through lots of reviews on zomato but had not had the chance to pay it a visit until last saturday(which incidentally was 'astami' of durga puja in kolkata).But boy oh boy what an experience it was.We were a group of 8 and had to wait for almost 2 hours before we could find ourselves seated at a table inside.But it was worth the wait as the food and ambience more than made up for it.Mocambo is one of a handful of restaurants in Kolkata which serves its entire range of dishes even on the days of festivities.We kicked things off with cream of spring chicken soup,russian salad and kebabs.The appetizers did their job as by the time the main course arrived we all had worked up a ravenous appetite.The main course comprised the famed mocambo sizzlers,three varieties of risottoes, meat lassagne,fish ala diana and of course the iconic chicken ala kiev.The dishes were cooked and rendered to perfection,and by the time we were through with it our tummies were already full and satisfied.The cost is on the higher side but given the quality of cuisine it is worth every penny.In a nutshell Mocambo is the place in Kolkata to try out authentic continental cuisine with my pick being the fish ala diana,meat lassagne, and of course the chicken ala kiev!!!

This is the place to be if you love sizzlers....They also has a pretty decent sense of authenticity....If you are with a loved one and want to spend the evening in a romantic way "mocambo" will give you enough time to chat along....All fish items are deliciously cooked...Yes if you visit this restaurant in dinner time you have to wait 30 minutes or so but the wait is not so bad If you compare it with the quality of food...Lobster thermidore is also a innovative dish which I considered unique....PS-They must improve their gents toilets...

it was not a very heartening experience for me. The devilled crab we ordered as starter was bland. Hated it.
The waiters were too busy to attend to us. Though we were the first customers of the day, we were treated as a liability in the beginning. 
These aside the food was great. the indian dishes are aplomb with flavour and that made up for the shoddy service (may be because of the puja rush). one more thing.. i dont know why but the  brownie with ice cream and hot chocolate sauce was cold allover, and i would have preferred a warm brownie with cold ice cream on it and not the way it was served the otherway round.

I had heard about Mocambo from my friends in Calcutta for many years, so when I went to the City Of Joy I made sure I finally got there.  The menu, the service and the food take you back to a bygone era when running a top class restaurant was a calling not a business.  Here they do things well and rarely do you ever find an empty table at meal time a true testament to a well run establishment.  One had to wait for about 15 minutes to get a table at dinner time which apparently is pretty good, once we sat down their service was super quick. For starters we had the Mushroom Garlic Prawns, it was very good, the sort where you clean up the sauce off your plate.  For my main course despite hearing so much about their Chicken A La Kiev, I decided to try a variation of the same, it was called Chicken Pavlograd which apart from the butter is also stuffed with cheese and mushrooms.  Needless to say that was top class too.  I will be visiting here often since my work does take me to Calcutta, often in the winter.  This establishment really lives up to that old saying, "Old is Gold."

Mocambo!!!sounds like an old war horse and is definitely one.It is located in the hustle and bustle of the city(park street) beside the bengal hyundai showroom. I have been visiting this place since my childhood but never has this place disappointed me.
The last visit to this place was just impeccable.

Now coming to the details which i have observed-:

1)Interiors-The restaurant is in a building which was built in the british era.The height of the ceiling is more than 20 feet.
a)lights-An allongated hanging lamps is used all through out the day in order to lit the tables below.The throw of the light is just perfect as it does not hampers the ambiance.

b)Seatings and Table layout-The hanging lamps goes hand in hand with the red sofas made out of fine quality rexin.I found it very comfortable.
The tables are well positioned and are spaced out well which enables to achieve optimum level of privacy.

c)Carpet-The inclusion of the carpet gives it a premium outlook.

d)Partition-The see through partition also plays a pivotal role in depicting the wooden craftmen work conducted.

2)Moving on to the service
The service process initiates from the gate.The doorman greets you with a smile.Enter the place and you see service personnel busy taking and dispensing orders but much to your delight a manager will always spot you even in the boisterous of periods.Greeted again and escorted to the most approriate table .Now the cutting edge which i found here was the way they make u sit.The manager or the server will always pull the chair and the moment you have positioned yourself to sit they push the chair back.This requires minimal efforts but can create an indelible impression on a persons mind.Shortly the menu was presented which i think was a big tick in the box.The menu was very elaborate as they serve fusion cuisine.Proper description about the each and every item gives you the exact prerequisite of the food .The restaurant offers a separate alcholic menu which comprises of a lot of spirits and cocktails.
a)placing the order-The personnel working in the restaurant have adequate amount of knowledge with regards to the items they are serving.Upsellig traits were evident when we were ordering.i ordered for chicken-ala-kiev , chicken butter masala , two butter nan and crepes with vanilla icecream and chocolate sauce.
b)order dispensing-The order took an eternity to complete its journey from the kitchen to my table.This has been a regular problem with mocambo.The dispensing speed has been really slow. 30 minutes is a regular affair which is on the higher side.Eventually the food arrived and lt compensates for the delay.

3)Food and beverage production
a)chicken ala kiev-A French preperation which has been justified here in mocambo because of the way it is presented and the sheer taste it has. The dish itself acts as a chamber of butter , when slitted the butter inside oozes out and creates a bed of butter in the entire plate.The accompaniments served are boiled carrots,potatoes,beans and maccoroni pasta.Amazing is the word for this dish.
b)chicken butter masala-The indian dish was equally good due to the unique taste it had. The chicken was well cooked. Tomato , red chilli powder and kasuri methi were the pillars of this dish and were very well engaged together.
c)Butter nan-The bread makes a huge difference for a diners experience.The yeast used to fluf the bread and the heat at which it was baked was just perfect.Soft and crispy at the same time.

d)crepes with vanilla icecream and chocolate sauce-The dish was just an iceing on the cake.It was a dessert well balanced.The slab of vanilla icecream wrapped in the crepe with chocolate sauce lingering over it was fantabulous.

experience
This restaurant is a symbol of excellence when food  and beverage service is concerned. The culinary fiesta out here can drive any diner crazy.A must visit place for all age groups.Hats off to the management of Mocambo for running the show so smoothly.Miraculous efforts guys.keep up the good work!

One of the old school places, the one place to drop in when you are hungry and are not sure of where to go.  On 2nd October, we ended up there for the umpteenth time to celebrate the Mister's birthday. There were five of us, including a kiddo. We reached there at around 4 pm, and were promptly seated. Nothing to say about the decor and the ambience, Mocambo has over the years retained its charm which I hear of from my parents. It had completely slipped our minds that 2nd October is a dry day, and were a little disappointed. But then, the food made up for it altogether. Me and the Mister settled for fresh lime sodas, while our friends ordered pineapple and musambi juices. Now it was time to go in for the food. We ordered for starters our all time must-have Spicy Tuna Fish Dip, and followed it up with some Devilled Crab. The kid ordered for the Beckty Belle Helen. For the main course, we ordered the Lobster Thermidor, the Fish Steak Sizzler, the Mixed Grill Sizzler a la Mocambo, the Grilled Chicken Steak and the Chateaubriand Beef Steak Sizzler. All the dishes were cooked to perfection, just the way we wanted them. For dessert, we opted for the Baked Alaska and the Chocolate Souffle. The Baked Alaska was a treat to watch, and the desserts were just perfect. We packed a FIsh a la Diana for Mom and we left, the bill coming close to Rs. 6k, and all of us feeling well fed :)

Mocambo Is an upscale continental fine dining restaurant, located in Park Street (Near On Track)
A Classy Ambiance With A High Profile Touch, is just the right medicine mocambo has patched together to jazz up one of the most historic places in Kolkata.
Best :
1. The Menu (Extravagant with amazing descriptions that will keep you drooling)
2. The Ambiance (Un-Comparable to any place in a 50 mile radius)
3. The Service (Well Dressed, Well Informed & Gold)
4. The Desserts (Just Amazing)
My Favorite - The Chicken A La Kiev (Butter Delight)

Flaws :
1. No Valet Parking (Only Street Parking that is almost 50% unavailable as its Park Street)
2. Reservation A Must On A Weekend

A Great Place, A Gem For Kolkata.

A classic restaurant! but the food quality varies sometimes, coz, I get good quality every alternate time I visit !

Love all the food they serve ! pretty good I would say .
I am a lover of cheese laden food but my dad is not, so this is a place where we kinda have truce because
the Indian food is really nice and the italian food is , well, awesome!

The price is a little on the higher side but then since it is an old classy restaurant on park street , that is quite obvious. But atleast you can have a hearty meal  with lots of flavours. But like I said i get good food every alternate time !

I wish they make it consistent

Mocambo is a legendary restaurant located in Free School Street just off Park Street. If you are craving steaks and sizzlers then this is the place to be. Countless reviews have been written which leaves very little for me to say, they have the same menu which hasn't changed much in the last few years, everything on the menu is outstanding. I must have tried all the steaks on the menu steaked and sizzled. Some favourites include the Chateau Briand  beef steak with mushroom / pepper sauce, Chicken Chipolata, Surf 'n' Turf, Pork Sirloin Steak all cooked medium, The pork chops are yummy and also the 'Beckty' A La Diana. The entire menu is mouthwatering. Mocambo is one of the top 5 restaurants in Calcutta. Too bad I don't live in that city.

However much  one praises Mocambo it is hardly enough. My parents say that its quality has gone down. But for a first-timer like me, it was bliss. It was my report card treat, and it WAS a real treat! We ordered Chicken A La Kiev, Chicken Pavlograd and the Chicken Chipolata. The A La Kiev was to die for...crisp batter, with a soft thick layer of buttery tasting chicken..and lashings of warm butter flavoured with the juices of the chicken...*sigh*..the Pavlograd was the same sort of fried fillet, but this time stuffed with irresistible mushrooms and cheesy capsicum..then the Chicken Chipolata came as a sort of palate cleanser after the cheesy buttery chicken..It had soft chicken coated in a light flavouful sauce, lots of fresh boiled vegetables to soothe a mother's heart..:D then two tasty spiced sausages and gravy coated bacon slices that were delightfully chewy..also a side of tossed pasta with a peppery kick. To finish we got the Baked Alaska..mounds of soft meringue, burning blue flames, and lovely cake hidden right inside! It was a gourmet experience to be treasured. A 4.0 because they lack variety and choice in their non-alcoholic drinks and the lighting is rather dark, so you have to peer at the menu and the food.

Its simply wow... only one word of advice... reach early if you want a seat there, else you will have to wait at least half an hour to even get a place... and don't forget to dig in to the devilled crabs!!

I completely second the review of Amarrtya Jana. Being a bong it is one of my greatest pride to have such a fantastic delicacy in my city. No matter how many times people have praised it but legends are always talked about....centuries after centuries.... Mocambo is such a legend on the glorious 'food street'...Parkstreet. My favourite starter for all time is Fish Meuniere....the soft bekti js melts inside and the potato chips nicely mixed with cheese and mushroom just add the extra love for it. The place is actually very popular for its fish dishes....the fish sizzler is definitely a must try. Chicken Supreme is also like heaven to me....you discover the dish slowly and you gorge on the layers of chicken and bacon and cheese.... You can also try Fish ala daina, chicken ala daina..even the mixed sizzler is good. Chicken chipolata would come with some veggies so that goes well for balance with high protein chicken. The waiters are dressed in typical british era clothes and that gives you an essence of the heritage of this place. Any time for the dinner and in weekends even for the lunch you HAVE to stand in a long que. But i can bet no one minds to wait that long to get into such an enormous experience of food!! So, this place is a must visit for anyone in the city who haven't gone there yet.

Mocambo does not needs a review...I believe. The food, service, everything from top to bottom makes the sense PERFECT. No words to express as every single words are used in other reviews but hobby can't be neglected, hence, try the stakes as well as the cocktails. The ambience will make you feel KOLKATA as CALCUTTA. Every seat has its own significace as it has the touch of history of ROYAL CALCUTTA. One of the key reason that the city has been named as "CITY OF JOY"

Visited Mocambo with my BFF on an impulse yesterday. Was a debut there for both of us. Had to wait for around 15 minutes. Loved the decor & ambiance. Classy..much better than Peter Cat. Ordered a Chicken Chipolata, Chicken Tetrazinni, Pineapple Blossom & Strawberry Blossom. 
Food took a little too long to arrive. But the wait was worth it.
The Chipolata was this huge dish with a large chunk of chicken, many yummy sausages and ham strips. Veggies were nice & fresh. The sauce, very tasty & authentic.
Tetrazinni was almost like lasagne . Cheesy, lotsa chicken strips and fine spaghetti. Tobasco sauce made it even nicer. Both the dishes were extremely filling.
Strawberry Blossom was bang on. Fresh. 
But the Pineapple Blossom was extremely weird.  Firstly it tasted of lime...almost like lime cordial...but with a heavier pineapple froth floating on top. The glass almost looked liked a beaker with a chemical reaction going on inside. :-D Funny, nevertheless we gulped it!

Our bill was an interesting exact 999!!

P.S. The cushions are supeerrrr comfy!

With nearly 300 reviews, there is nothing much left to appreciate about Mocambo over here but still I would like to salute this place. Mocambo has definitely burnt the idea that to be good you need to be different. I have been eating out here for the last 5 years and apart from certain service issues at times I have had nothing much to complain about Mocambo. Oh, yes!! Another thing that is a personal grievance is the long queues that have to be faced. Now a days the queues are their even on weekdays. Last Wednesday I was here at around 8 pm and had to wait for around 45 minutes. But the deviled crabs and Chicken A La Keiv had enough niceties to satiate my wait. I have always stuck to their signature dishes and never felt the need for venturing beyond the recommended ones. My personal favorites are the Chicken Pavlograd, Chicken A La Keiv and angels on horse back. Don't waste time reading reviews of Mocambo and go and have a hearty meal instead

The first place I head to whenever I visit Kolkata. I have tried pretty much every dish there. The Kiev (both veg and chicken), Surf and turf, Betki bel meuinere are my favourites. Beer is served in the most charming mugs. I would have rated it 5 but across the last few visits I encountered carrots that were past their prime and a not so prime cut of beef. 
Service is good and the waiters attentive.

Mocambo has been a favourite for a very long time now. the only reason I rate them 0.5 less then a full score is the slow service but then at times this slow service also allows you to spend time with someone you really want to be with.
This place is a delight for people who like med and continental cuisines. Also people who like sizzlers with a cobtinental touch yet satisfaction guaranteed to the desi pallet. 
Some dishes I recommend would be the house speciality known as devil's crab. Tried this pork blanket cutlet, truly out of the world.  Other favourites remain in chicken stroganoff,  the salads and any sizzler that you think will make your day.

The best Indian style English and continental food hub in the city. No adventure is complete for food without this place in Kolkata. The staff is courteous, though not very friendly, and yes, they don't care about anything, as they feel, they are the best in town. The quality of service has much deteriorated with time, as do the taste of their signature dishes is also declining, but, there is no doubt, still they serve best Indian style continental in Kolkata. Their starters like prawn cocktail (as good as skyroom), devilled crab, mains like chicken tetrazinni, fish florentine, prawn stuffed fish a la diana, tandoori mixed grill sizzler and fish steak sizzler and tutti fruity ice cream and baked alaska are the heritage recipes to die for wherever you are in the world. You may have a much authentic version of tetrazinni or florentine or whatever, with mozzarella and permassan, but, the taste, I bet you get nowhere what they make even with flour. So, mocambo rocks and rules, no doubt. .5 off only for making them understand that they are deteriorating.

when u enter this place , just devote yourself to the food and relish it.....i cant pick any single name  as each one of them is unique in its own way and is carefully cooked to perfection....but one dish without which this review would be incomplete is the one and only chicken a la kiev which is their signature dish....u need to wait for 35-40 minutes to let it arrive to your table.....but once it arrives,you forget everything and you are taken to a different world altogether....the chicken breast is all filled with delicious butter and it just melts in your mouth...they serve it with boiled peas,carrots potatoes and all....the kebabs are good but nothing exotic and sizzlers and chicken steak (did not taste their beef) are equally good...the hospitality is fine....5 stars from me

Was thoroughly disappointed with the service: lots of stewards hovering all around but few to actually attend to customers. We had booked a table well in advance but on arrival precisely on time, discovered that they hadn't a clue. So we waited around and were shown to a table near the counter and kitchen which I objected to. Then began a still more prolonged period of waiting while the stewards walked about, and took no notice of the fact that we had been sitting there for over 40 minutes, until I called one of them and asked whether it would take still longer, in which case we would leave. This resulted in some action, for we were served - the dishes not in sequence as we had planned but as the kitchen could produce them. 
The ambience might be great for those with pleasant memories of an older Calcutta; I think the place looked rundown. I admit that I see little sentimental value in old crockery, slow service, tables that shake, and lights that hang so low that even a child is in danger of being struck by the bulb. Maybe modernisation isn't such a bad idea.

Well, my experience out there was satisfactory.
We ordered the iconic GRILLED CHICKEN SIZZLER which was awful.It was too small in portion and too highly priced.
Disheartened we followed it with CHICKEN SICILLENE and GARLIC BREAD which was awesome and literally finger licking good.The quantity was also enough and filling for two.
The PLAIN PEAS PULAO and KADHAI CHICKEN was also great and tasty.

But the service on the other hand was pathetic.Staffs were ill behaved, laid back and didn't even know their menu properly.The slow service was also very disappointing.

If you plan to ignore the service, you can definitely drop in and enjoy some good dishes that they serve :)

Nothing else evokes nostalgia in me in the same vein that the whole row of eat outs on Park Street does. Growing up in Patna, Calcutta was my yearly summer vacation haunt; and the pinnacle of those summer trips used to be the trip to Park Street to gorge on the delicacies of the family favoured restaurant, Mocambo. 

Mocambo is certainly one of the pioneers of Continental cuisine, and while extensive travel & exposure to various cuisines in subsequent years has made me question the authenticity this "continental" cusine, there is no question that what they serve is heavenly.

Some of the eternal gems dished out here are:

Chicken Cordon blue: A block of cheese stuffed inside a chicken patty, coated with batter and deep fried. This one is all about texture, the crunchiness of the coating, the succulent bite of the chicken and the gooey cheese oozing out from every pore.

Chicken A-La-Kiev: A lot like Chicken Cordon Bleu, except the interiors of the chicken is stuffed with good old wholesome butter; and dollops it. One poke on the chicken and the butter gushes and floods the whole dish. Not for the weak hearted, this dish, but gastronomic heaven nonetheless. 

Chicken Tetrazzini: Pasta and chicken slices cooked in a buttery sherry infused sauce. Another hearty dish.

The ambience and service are all right, but if like me you're coming here for a trip down memory lane, everything else is immaterial.

Kolkata has retained a part of its colonial charm and it has managed to do so because of places like Mocambo. Your visit to Kolkata will be incomplete if you do not experience this Authentic Continental Cuisine paradise. Anything that comes in a box titled Chef Special is a blind choice. I say it because I have gone to a college across the street from here. And in that much time, it wasn't difficult to try all available options. Try their Beckti Fish, in any form. Or the sizzlers. Or cutlets. My favourites are the Devilled Crabs (choose the peppered version if you have a sharp tongue), the chicken Chipolata, the Pork Cutlet, Fish Florentine, Beckti Belle Helen & the Beef Steak with the mushroom pepper sauce. There are enough choices in the retro styled menu; so once you've shortlisted what meat you want, just go for whichever preparation appeals to you. I can assure you that you won't complain about how the food tasted.

Been here 4-5 times. My favourite restaurant in the city. Love the classic ambience. the continental food is too good.
The surf n turf, beef steak, ham steak, prawn cocktail are worth mentioning. Chicken-ala-kiev is a great dish but a little heavy on the stomach. Great for family outings. The waiters and manager are very friendly. Might be a little heavy on pocket, but its woth the food they serve.

Yet again mocambo gave us a good dining  experience last night with excellent food and service. Was served by a very young waiter who was just 18 yrs old. he was very attentive. Although he was a bit shaky when serving our bottle of wine. But he was  right there when u needed anything. Our steaks were perfectly cooked and tender. Thumbs up again to mocambo.. Keep up the good work..

Love the food. Especially the beef steak. Had fun talking to a waiter who has been working there from the opening of mocambo that would be more than 40 years.

If you want to visit a classy and elegant restaurant that brings you back to the early 1900s than this is the perfect place. It has not changed a bit I guess from the old times and the food quality served here, is same as ever - great in its literal sense.

For me, whenever I feel like having Continental, there is no better place than Mocambo. My wife is not very fond of Continental and thus, the frequency has lessened post marriage but even till date, whenever there is a friends reunion and Continental and Beer is the theme we decide upon for the evening - Mocambo is the place. I have very rarely ordered anything other than Continental here so can't comment on that but the Continteal cuisines here are going to make you ask for more.

The service is courteous and attentive and the food quality simply lip-smacking. Having a beer here with friends is supposedly, one of the most memorable experience you will have. The ambience can't get better and you will feel you have tasted the flavor of Kolkata truly. Pricing is moderate and should not pinch you, considering the heritage value of the property and the amazing food.

Mocambo oh Mocambo! Regardless of what experience one has, it is difficult to give it a miss.

On a lunch visit on 18 July with a friend and her kids, the experience was much the same as always, but then again quite different.

We walked in early-ish and got a good table. We ordered our eternal favourite, the pepper baked crab. The shell seemed smaller than before, as did the over feeling of satiation. Taste was like always. My friends ordered the chicken liver platter. It looked delicious the way it was served... lots of liver with some pasta, fried onions, carrot, peas, potato. The colour was perhaps what made it look so inviting. Unfortunately I do not like liver, so I tried out something new... The chicken chipolata! I asked for a breast piece. It came with a portion (quarter) of chicken, 3 sausages (chicken I think), one solitary rasher of bacon, and the usual potato, grilled tomato (looked salvaged), onion, carrot and peas. As usual the lettuce bed was clear, which meant it was not sizzled enough! The brown sauce it was served with was extraordinarily watery. I looked at the piece and found I was given a thigh piece instead of the breast I had asked for. I asked the steward to have it changed and changed it was. The new piece that came (they took the old one away... I wonder if they were going to serve it to someone from my half eaten plate) was larger, succulent, tender and juicy. I enjoyed cutting it and chewing on it! The sauce too was right, of the correct consistency.

What was disappointing was the Thumsup. I have never had one so bad there (I enjoy it with my meals). Something tasted off. It was either that the bottle was old stock, or the water used in the ice cubes had something wrong with it.

The next visit shouldn't be too long away.

Review for a meal on 05 September 2012. I am very fond of Mocambo, visit fairly regularly, but this one instance kind of took the cake. The reason fopr posting this is to say what can, and has happened!

We ordered two pepper devilled crabs crabs and a prawn cocktail. The former was tasty but had hardly any crab. The latter was passable though not even remotely chilled. A sacrilege.

Main course... one of us order a tandoori mixed grill. It came, nice, but had too much liver (none of us eat liver anyway). My wife ordered a chicken tetrazzini and they forgot all about it. I had asked for a chateaubriand sizzler... dared to try out the Irish version (garlic butter sauce). It came, very tough and completely devoid of any taste. Not even salt. Awful meat. I asked them to take it back and make it a regular pepper steak. When it came back... it was a similar tough meat shabbily put together. Meat once again inedible and this time they got a real piece of my mind and it worked. The third sizzler was probably the best done meat... a medium well done one. Nice and succulent. My wife's tetrazzini came after all this!

Dessert. we ordered a Baked Alaska and two large Tutti Fruttis. Baked Alaska was terrible. Mostly thick egg white. And they got one small Tutti Frutti, which they then had to change. They weren't too great. Once again room temperature fruit instead of cold ones. And I preferred the caned ones mixed in because of the papaya etc.

So much so for a Calcutta icon. And all this drama when there wasn't a major rush either.

Mocambo is a diamond amongst the other chain of restaurants in Park Street. Be it in the reel life at 'Kahani' or a real life instance when i want there with my family Mocambo ne humesha Mogambo ko khush kiya hai!!

I have had chicken supreme there and also tasted chicken pulao and baked beckti there... they were all extremely tasty and also the staff there was quite courteous. 

Overall, Mocambo is a nice place to hang out, quite affordable also.

Mocambo was a real shocker!!!!!!!!!!!!

it seems that there is some problem with the staff in this once upon a time outstanding restaurant... it really makes me sad to see this restro going down badly, my experience was also pethetic, i just hated their lousy idea of not allowing the customers to sit in the restuarant when the group has not come, does not make any sense therefore just for the sake of one person of my group we were waiting outside for a long time. The food we ordered was to salty and lousy. 

Certainly this place is not what it use to be its rather lousy, i found the service staff rather rude and the attitude irritated me.

last monday i had visited mocambo and i must say the food here is terrible, the food use to be very good but of late the food is aweful. The glass of water that was served to me was dirty and had not been washed. The chowmein had a tiny insect in it and it was disguisting and spoiled my appetite. I had to wait for a long time when the restro could have easily accommodated me and my friend. The fish grill should be taken off the menu its simply terrible. I am not a person to make too much of a noise in public but i thought i would bring this to the notice of authorities.

Certainly not recommended these days at least.

I wish the scale had option for negative marking. First time visited one of Kolkata's so called "favorite place" with few friends in a celebratory mood. It took us exactly half an hour to regret our decision of coming down to this awful place. It started with a big visible hair on a side plate and then we found hair again in our tasteless Fish Biriyani. Although they claimed to change that biriyani and told us they have made it again from scratch. I doubt that.Fish Masala was equally awful but given the spread yesterday that was better than other food we have ordered. Chicken Steak with Mushroom sauce - reminded me how these places are fooling customers for ages and probably have made their taste bud also like their cooking style. Having tasted cuisine in quite a few "famous sizzlers places" in the world, it came as a shocker. However, the experience got bitter with my own fault when I ordered Fish Wellington. If Mocambo wants, I can share authentic Beef Wellington recipe with them. Wellington all over the world comes with a pastry which wraps the meats and other filling. I enquired before ordering what kind of pasta they are serving in the Fish Wellington. The Manager (who claimed to be the one) informed that it is flat pasta. I was not sure what it was until it reached our table. It was flat indeed but not PASTA. Flat bed of white flour topped with grilled cheese and smelly bits of Bhetki and Mushroom inside. I don't waste food at all but couldn't tolerate that crap. Requested one of the staffs to call the manager who listen to all my complain and reacted in the most cold manner possible. No customer services, No food quality and I doubt about their hygiene standards too. To all Kolkata foodies, who bragged about Mocambo's continental dishes, please get your taste bud checked or just check online recipe to understand particular dishes. I have tried to contact the manager twice from yesterday and yet to get hold of him. Any decent place of dining, would have not charged for a dish which a customer is not happy about. If this is what such a reputed restaurant of Kolkata is all about, I better share my own recipes with them to upgrade their standards. I thank God that we haven't fallen sick after that meal.  Never visiting this place again and would not recommend also. It's better to celebrate anything with a roll from the roadside snack bars at Park Street!

Today i visited mocambo and it was a real shocking experience, the place which is packed with people as i was told was almost empty i was thinking twice before entering the restro... anyways since i a really grubby so i decided to order a few items from the menu for me and my friend. 
I ordered a Chicken a la kiev, Angel on horseback and crab meat soup and bhetki Bell Meuniere. 

The a la kiev is not what is use to be and i thought there was too much of salt in that, the same goes for the crab meat soup it was too salty and spoiled the taste, Bhetki that was served was slightly off and i had to leave the bhetki after consuming two or three mouths. Angel of horseback was ok. Therefore the standard of mocambo has gone down from what it use to be i tasted their food around three months back and it was really good but these days its not quiet.

I think this is the best restaurant in Kolkata. For me as the Cadbury Bournville ad says "You have to earn it" similar emotions are applicable to this place. One often has to wait outside for the food but it's worth the wait.  continental food is what you come for and the best is whst they serve you. start with their hors d'oeuvre maison or devilled crab both of which are to die for. the taste of the Raj continues with their insanely delicious Angels on Horseback which is essentially grilled chicken breasts wrapped in bacon or the cheesy pork cutlets which melt in the mouth.  The fried fish wi tartare sauce is a timeless classic so is their Lobster Thermidor. finish off with probably the best Meringue in town served with sinful chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream. one lsst warning- You will be well advised to skip a meal before going there to enjoy and do justice to the food

If you like continental food,then mocambo is the place to be. For me,Mocambo serves the best continental food in Kolkata. I have been to this place many many times and have tried almost all of their continental items and never have i been disappointed. 

They also serve Indian food,but that is no where as good. The deserts are also not as good as the food.

One has to wait quite a while to get in at most times and almost always on weekends. It is testimony to the quality of the place and I for one feel it is worth the wait.

The sheer quality of the continental food and also the starters make it one my favourite restaurants.The items which are worth recommending include the Devilled Crab,Meat Lasagne,Chicken Milanese,Chicken Pavlogard,Yorkshire Pork Chops,Mixed Meat Risotto.

Love it or hate it, Mocambo towers over the Park Street restaurant scene. It is not exaggeration to state that this is possibly the most sought-after restaurant for Continental food in the city. The queues outside every evening (and afternoons on weekends) are testimony to its popularity.

Having said that, one should also caution that Mocambo has also become so successful that its infrastructure sometimes cannot support the rush that descends upon it. This is perceived through slower service in the last few years, and the occasional missed/crossed order. Also, prices have risen, but quantities have shrunk.

In spite of all this, the food is certainly worth it. The Prawn Cocktail, served on a bed of ice, the Devilled Crab (with its Pepper Devilled Crab spinoff), the Angels on Horseback, the Cecil's Jazzed, or, best, the Maison Hors d'Oeuvres - all these are among the best starters available in any city restaurant.

The main dishes are too many to mention individually. Personal favourites include the Fish Wellington, the Fish a la Diana, the Chicken a la Kiev and its cheesy cousin the Pavlograd. The "Like a Neat Fish" (fried fish), the Beckti Belle Meuniere, the Chicken Cordon Bleu and the Chicken Supreme deserve honourable mention. The sizzlers here are also quite good - one should mention the Chicken Garlic Steak and the Yorkshire Pork Chops. Reports suggest that the Surf & Turf, as well as the less complicated Irish Chateaubriand Beef Steak, are also worth it. Among the Italian dishes on offer, the Meat Lasagne and the Spaghetti Carbonara are good, while the risottos are usually average.

The place where Mocambo fluffs it are the desserts. They're no good. Their famed Baked Alaska is a shadow of its famed self (if there was one worth ordering) and their Trifle has no substance.

Bowing to popular demand, Mocambo has now introduced Indian dishes (Saag Meat and other abominations), which are for the exclusive consumption of the barbarous hordes, and should not even be mentioned in the same breath as the restaurant.

Service, as mentioned, is slow. However, the waiters and stewards are usually polite, and do try to speed up service when asked. The decor here is muted and tasteful - the comfortable chairs and sofas, coupled with good lighting, make it a good place to sit in. Overall, a very good restaurant to go to for Continental food.

"Mocambo" is a household name in my family. It was the place where my dad use to go for good food when he was just a boy and where I had been when I was just a little girl. Time passed by and life went on but the foodie could never ignore Mocambo and its sumptuous delicacies. The mesmerising prawn cocktail, the mouth watering Devilled crab or the heavenly Lobster Thermidor. The list of my favourites at Mocambo is ever ending as I'm in love with almost all of them and tried most. Starting from the Virgin Mary to the scrumptious Chicken Pavlograd, which one to ignore. They all are so wonderful and so very special. The quaint ambiance, the lowly lit passageways and those corner tables, they had in them so many unforgettable moments of my life. I have cherished my ecstasies, my  happiness, my sorrows , my loneliness, my love and the warmth of my family in those tables  with the tasty treats at Mocambo. I like every bit of the place, be it the long queues of weekend or the delays in rendering the orders but it will ever top the list of my favourite places to pamper my taste buds in the city of joy. I am always ready to wait patiently for my turn into the restaurant. Mocambo rocks!!!

Yesterday we went to Mocambo for dinner to celebrate my Dad's birthday. We have dined there innumerable times right from my childhood, but I was surprised by their behaviour this time. Firstly, we were not given a table since all of us had not turned up together. Then, we had bought a cake and wanted to celebrate it there but the steward impolitely asked us not to do so. We were shocked and saddened by their rude behaviour. Undoubtedly their food is amazing but that does not mean that they can be rude. We had to leave the place.

Visited Mocambo for a dinner couple of months back. It was on the list for long. We learnt that Mocambo and Peter Cat are run by same management.
We were surprised to see a waiting at even on weekday!!! Had to wait for 20-25 minutes, and that too on street.
After we got a table, we ordered quickly- Fish A La Diana, Chicken Orientele A La Mocambo and Chicken Pavlograd. All the dishes were extremely tasty and well presented. Quantity wise also they are sufficient.
Overall, was quite happy about the entire experience sans the waiting.

Mocambo is another must visit in Kolkata. It is definitely one of the better continental restaurants in Kolkata.

This is a higly recommended place for continental food lovers. There are a lot of dishes worth mentioning but there is one in particular which I think no non-vegetarians should miss. It is the Devilled Crab! Crab lover or not, you will love the dish!

I love my continental food but sorry to say this Mocambo's food has gone down in my rating ever since i have taste the food of Mango People especially if you are a continental food freak. But yes some of the food items like the chicken chacolatte and steaks are still good. But i think there should be more variety in the menus, its been there on the cards for a long time and needs to be changed. 

The deco at the restaurant also sucks!!! and needs to improve compared to some of the brilliant restaurants in town they are not only good in their food but also in its deco and service. 

The rule of making people stand when their is place available is really lousy just become a few of my friends have not come, please change these stupid rules, at least have the decency of letting people to sit in the resto instead of letting us get wet in the rain. Lousy service staff.
The waiter was very rude. delay in bring the bills to us had to tell the waiter three times before i got it. They are more interested in seeing to other customers and forgetting their basics.

I am a very lazy person and wouldn't care for submitting reviews in Internets. But this restaurant is actually one my favorites. So can't just ignore writing this. When I enter it, I feel the essence of Calcutta's elegance and feel really proud. The food is too good for me and I prefer ordering Golder Corn Cheese Risotto with Fish Wellington which would go well with Beer. You may try the Steak which would be good too - and for deserts choose from a big list. I am not into deserts much so can't comment. Tried Baked Alaska once (comes with firing Rum), tasted modest. 

Last but not the least, the serving hands can't be more elegant and classy here. And cannot define how interesting the menu card is - will take you back to their origin through stories and pictures. You would not believe so much of these are available behind the not-so-gloss entrance door of "The Mocambo" :)

Since i love continental food i have tried the chicken a la kiev and the fish and chips and chicken  cordenbleu, all were terrific. Although the place was noisy and the deco quiet ordinary but yet the service was prompt and professional. The service staff were also nice and polite and give me good recommendations when i reqested them to suggest what were there specialities. 
But if i did rate the two three as far as continental food goes 

1st Mango People

Did you say 'Continental'? I'd say 'Mocambo'. It is as synonymous as it might get, as far as I'm concerned. And the best part is that they have kept up with the quality through out the years, which is actually the hardest part. Keep up the good work.

One of the oldest restaurant of Park Street. Ambience is good. Service is also good. I have tried :-
Mutton Biryani @ 199 : It was bad. It contains small pieces of mutton (around 3-4 pieces) with cooked onions giving it a bad taste, although they have managed to provide soft pieces of mutton. Quantity is less for a male foddie.
Chicken Ala Kiev at around 295/- : A Russian dish. The fillet (big in size) of chicken with a thin crust of a fry on outside and butter inside as a whole give it a fabulous taste. It is served with salad and pasta( small amount). Quantity is Sufficient for one person.

At first, I was a bit apprehensive about visiting this place, as i not too fond of continental food. We (me and my partner) ordered for Devilled Crab, Chicken Cordon bleu and Chicken Chipolata. I won't say i am dissapointed with the starter. Devilled Crab was just fabulous. Nothing can beat that. It was a delicious dish.  Chicken Cordon bleu was not too bad either. It was very filling and tasty. We wanted to try a sizzler, so went for chicken chipolata. It was one of the worst sizzler we had till date. Chicken was caramelized way too much and there was hardly any bacon. i would definitely go back there again for the lovely crab meat and Baked Alaska (Desert) which we couldn't order as we were already full.

Yummmm... is the only word you shall keep saying every time you take a bite of Mocambo's food. Continental at its best. Yorkshire Pork, Beef Steak, Angels on Horseback, Mixed Tandoori Grill, Chicken A La Kiev, Bhetki Muinuere, Devil's Crab, Prawns, etc..... these are few amongst other food available at Mocambo. Each of them is just another trip to food's heaven. The menu card is also a fun thing to read with their witty descriptions. My personal favourite is Non-Sizzler Fish Steak. Anyone would love it.

Sitting arrangement is a problem. Need to upstart their cutlery. Mocambo is a sure 'Go' and was my favourite in whole Kolkata, even before it was popularized by 'Kahaani'. It is like any day, anytime, a la carte at Mocambo. The restaurant is very old but still holds its head high among many new competitors; their food is mood lifter :)

Mocambo! A name recognized amongst every foodie in Kolkata, and then some. Possibly the last stalwart restaurant serving proper continental fare on Park Street, Mocambo has endured through the years while others have come and gone.

I recently visited the restaurant after a gap of nearly half a year - quite long, since I frequent the place, and I was somewhat shocked by the drop in quality. The Prawn Cocktail - one of the staples in my menu there - was warm, instead of being pleasantly chilled like I remembered. Moreover, there was some strange brown liquid floating in there which completely killed my taste buds, leaving me horrified. The Ham Steak and the Chicken Ala Kiev were both smaller portions than what I had eaten before, while the pasta served with the entree was another let down.

But as a dilettante foodie, I believe that one small slip-up isn't enough to lower my opinion of Mocambo. Even though I was disappointed that night, I wholeheartedly believe that Mocambo will bounce back...it's been around since I was born, and I'm sure it'll keep going strong many years into the future. 

That said, one thing that has never decreased in quality in all my time at Mocambo is their signature Devilled Crab. The cheese-and-crab flavour was as easy on my gustatory system, and as quick to delight the senses as always. The mushroom sauce with the Surf and Turf was perfect, and the Pork Cutlet remained as mouthwatering as memory served. The menu - which, by itself, is an experience to read - offers a host of other fantastic dishes, some of which include the Mixed Grill Sizzler, Fish A La Diana, Angels on Horseback, Prawn Newburg, Thermidors (both Lobster and Prawn). Yes, I do love me some Mocambo food. The restaurant has always served the best quality of meat and fish, and their sauces are to die for. What's not to love?!

On an afterthought, the restaurant serves quality Indian food as well. I confess that I've never tried any of it besides the occasional taste from my friends or family, so I'll give it a thumbs up from memory. 

That said, the ambiance of the place is quite decent. A reddish-golden aura envelops the restaurant and is quite comfortable, though the same can't be said for the seating. But the space-crunch hardly matters when there's good food and good company!

To sum up the review...go there. Eat.

Really eat.

PS. Baked Alaska. In other words, heaven.

You cant afford luxury of taste at the expense of your pocket. Not when you are almost a pauper. But, a benevolent friend can always come to your rescue. And yes, when your salary has been quietly deposited into your account.

Us, my bestie and me, needed to explore Park Street. Us both, were already done with our part of Chello Kebabs. And so, we needed to explore the traditional enamour and glory of Park Street. Mocambo is certainly synonymous to it. And I bugged him to take me there and treat me well a sumptuous luncheon (with drink and dessert). The dessert never took place. Because I am a scanty eater. He, well, wouldn't suffice much. And we took Hors d'oeuvre as our starter, which was certainly the most delectable and fascinatingly charming platter before us. Each dressing was savoury, each meat (from ham, chicken and shrimps) was dressed to perfection and the salad seemed quite a healthy feast for us! We coupled it with Chicken Orientale A La Mocambo, which couldn't really match up with our previous fare. They served it with Butter Fried Rice. One thing that we both constantly yielded to was the peeking over to the other tables (yes, we had been oblivious of all table manners); the Chicken a la Kiev looked like a smacker (they said it was one of their signatures) and so did the sizzlers.

The menu card would seem like a very neat story book. Take your time and read them well. Ask for help if you don't understand what they mean ( I, for one, couldn't infer most!). The ambiance wont fail you. Old Calcutta charm is always a winner!
Bon Apetit!

This restaurant reminds me of good old days. I have tried some of their dishes and my favorite is "Bekty newberg". It's a mouth watering platter consist of bekty fillet with white continental sauce. SLURP! You would love to visit this restaurant again and again for their huge multi cuisine delicacies.

Mocambo repesents a palate of food that is a delight to any audience. Last Saturday was no different for 9 of us. It started with the usual hour wait (expected on Saturday night) but what followed erased all memory of the wait. It started off with chicken and mutton starters which melted in our mouths!!!

This was followed by pork chops stuffed with cheese and ham, irish beef steak with a heavenly garlic and butter sauce, pork sirlion steak and mutton hamburger steak. This was followed by mango souffle. Needless to say the quality has not changed over the years. It still reminds me of the Kolkata when trams ruled the road. Always worth the visit.

One of my all time favorites in the city. This place has a very distinct Calcutta aura to it. Plush leather chairs and sofas and low lying lights give this place a very old world romantic charm.

This place serves both Indian and Continental dishes but I have only had the continental fare. For the starters order the Devilled Crab Crabmeat or if you prefer it hot like me order the Pepper Devilled Crab Crabmeat. Your taste buds will be tantalized. Mocambo is my go to place when it comes to Steak.I love the Chicken Steak Sizzler with mushroom sauce, the Fish Steak, Chicken Chipolata and the Hamburger Steak Sizzler that they serve here. But my favourite is the Mocambo Mixed Grill. It contains a piece of chicken, chicken liver, mutton liver and the best sausage I have tasted. This particular dish has never failed to make me happy. All the steaks comes with sauteed vegetables and roasted potatoes(not mashed potatoes out of a can). They earn extra goody points from me for the perfect roasted potatoes. For dessert try their Mango Alaska. They only make it during summer that too in limited quantity but if you get it it would be your lucky day. They also make a mean Baked Alaska.

Another thing I really like about this place is the menu card. The way each food item is described is hilarious. It is a very fun read. Everytime I go there I make it a point to read their entire menu card. 

I have one suggestion for this place. Please start stocking up on some breezers,

I had heard so much about this restaurant and couldn't resist the visit.... but i was really shocked with my experience. Firstly since i was with a friend (two pax) we were given a secluded seating which we were not very keen about.. we were told that our seats would be changed, but that never happened... other were given the seat. while our main course was being order we had ordered for beers... which the server left on the table for us to open ourselves (eventually when no one came i had to open the bottle with the spoon on the table) !! the staff later made their hub just next to our table and keep on chatting about guest, management, their salary and other things which surprised me !! they didn't give a damn that we were on a table just next to them. food on the contrary was okay... i had asked for medium done steaks and it was well done.. the only think i could give a thumbs up to was the pork chops. i needed to step out to get a cake for my best friends b'day so i paid my bill of 3,700 and told the service personnel that i would be back in 10 mins... when i was back i saw that my table was give to someone else and i was made to stand till i received my packed order (BTW it was my friends B'day) and when we came back with the cake i had no option but to take my packing and leave... even tough i wanted to have a couple of more beers !! My first and worst experience..

Nostalgia marries quality when the spouse and I hit the joint. We have been frequenting this place long before it was made popular and famous by a Bollywood flick. The sizzlers are to die for. They even cater for purely vegetarian people, upon request, my mom being one.

well .. this is one of my fav continental restro in kolkata.   
today i am writing this review r8 inside from the restro...
i ordered mocambo ala continental...
it was made with wine sauce served with butter rice, fresh tomatoes, mushroom topped with as-prgus & boiled eggs...
i was served plain white rice ..no tomatoes .. when i asked the waiter he replied that the tomato is mixed with wine sauce :-)
looks like they have started understanding the way to fox customers... 
very shocking....

What can I say about this place... No compare if we talk about continental dishes.

I hate fishes..but this the plave where i never miss fish-ala-diana... Awesum saala !!

Any kind of Grill/steaks are just mouth watering here.

Expect a decent wait time here...

if you love to eat good food... missing this place in kolkata is a crime =)

Its the place for continental food in kolkata; its ambience, its decor, its service, its food, its pricing - all are excellent- in a class of its own. Actually Peter Cat and Mocambo are owned by the same gentleman, Mr. Nitin Kothari, but behaviour of the staff at Mocambo is far better than the other place. The menu is startlingly different too. but the quality of food is awesome. As with most restaurants in Park Street area, there is no parking available, so on a weekend - any self driven guest will feel a bit worn out before he sits for his meal.
A nice place to hang out with friends and family if you do not mind the occasional waiting.

Start with a prawn cocktail and devilled crab, wash it down with a nice cold beer, served in their age old Mugs, with the Mocambo inscription on. Move on to the surf and turf. In the middle of finsihing your main course, ask the waiter to prepare your baked Alaska for dessert (it takes a while to prepare). Enjoy the visual spectacle of your dessert as it is served to you. Recede in your red leather chair as the fantastic gastronomical experience fellates your foodie spirit. 

Walk home.

Think of awwwesome continental food in town, & Mocambo should be the name that comes to your mind first. I personally have never tried their North-Indian food though, so can't comment on that. They have must haves all over the menu, but Chicken tetrazzini should have a special mention. Very good quantity of food also. The ambiance, nothing great to have a special mention, but very Old world type. Very Park street. Cheers!

It has been months since I had visited Mocambo. Every time I get continental food craving while in Kolkata, Mocambo is the first place i can think of. Even on a wednesday evening the place was completely crowded by 8pm. We had lots of time so ordered a tandoori platter.to go with a  few drinks. The tandoori platter priced at about Rs 270 serves two people. It is basically a platter with one piece mutton sheek (tender and melts in your mouth), one chicken tandoori liver, one mutton tandoori liver (soft and tasted good), one chicken tikka kebab, one fish tikka, one prawn in tandoori masala, and one small leg of tandoori chicken. Every piece of meat was well marinated, soft and flavoursome. Oh! And there was a tandoori paneer cube as well. My only advice would be that the concept of a platter is only where one can have a little bit of everything. But it should be a starter for at least two people. I am not saying that the quantity they serve is insufficient. However, they should increase the price, and serve two pieces of the smaller meats like prawns and fish and chicken. The sheek kebab, liver and tandoori chicken could be shared. Nonetheless, this was a great order to start the evening.

Then be ordered their signature prawn cocktail. The ever so creamy sauce, excellent consistency, smooth texture with the tartness from tomatoes and the tangy taste of tabasco sauce - this dish is undoubtedly my favourite and highly recommended. 

We were quite full for main course so we prefered sharing a prawns thermidor. This was prawns baked in a creamy cheese sauce, served with boiled carrots and peas. Looked bland, but tasted great. This being my umpteenth visit to Mocambo, it never disappoints. Its incredible to see the staff loyalty, same faces over soooo many years, they are so consistent with the quality of food and prompt and friendly service. 

My recommendations:

Continental - Prawn Cocktail and Devilled crab for starters. Angels on horseback and chicken chipolata sizzler for mains. Love the mixed meat risotto as well. 
Indian - Murg Firdausi bari kebab.
Desserts - Baked Alaska, Cold Everest and Brownie with ice cream. (No, its not common, the homemade brownie makes all the difference)



----- 08 Dec, 2012 -----

I was quite disappointed after my last visit to Mocambo a few weeks back. However I'm glad that I gave them another chance and visited them again today. I must admit that there has been quite a deterioration in their sizzlers, however there is still a lot on the menu card that one would like! 

Waiting time: We reached at about 2 pm. We were lucky to have got a table within 5 minutes on a Saturday afternoon, however I would advice everybody to either book a table or be prepared to wait for about 20 minutes.

Service: I must also mention that both times i was not happy with the service. They don't seem too interested in taking the order. They took close to 20 minutes for the starters and another 40 minutes to serve the mains. They took a while to present the bill as well.

Food: On our last visit, we had ordered an Irish Chateaubriand Steak and a chicken chipolata sizzler. These sizzlers were not very impressive. Meat was not well marinated and somewhat hard and chewy. However, today we ordered the continental mains. For starters we ordered a deviled crab and prawn cocktail. Both the starters were very well prepared. The prawns were fresh and soft. The cocktail sauce was a good mix of tomato, tobasco, pepper and mayo. Topped with lime and served on a bed of ice to keep it cold, the prawn cocktail is one of the most refreshing starters on their menu. The crab was a lovely warm creamy combination of crab and cheese served in a crab shell. 

Next we ordered a chicken tetrazini. This was a baked dish made of chicken, green pepper and mushroom served with sherry sauce and topped with cheese.
Angels on horseback, one of Mocambo's signature dishes was delicious as always. The chicken was soft and well cooked wrapped in rashers of bacon. The meat that they served was of premium quality. The prawn thermidor was slightly more bland than the tetrazini, both had a white sauce yet the tetrazini was lighter and tasted better. 

The baked alaska is a must try to end your meal on a sweet note! 

Advice: They should really try and improve the service.

Overall satisfaction: Very good (4 on 5)
Meal for 2: 1200 for two (without alcohol)

Classic restaurant in good old Park Street.

Speciality in continental. If you go on Sundays, be prepared to wait for a table.

We tried Fish A La Diana and Chicken A La Mocambo.
 
                     In the first one, bhetki is impregnated with prawn, cooked in sauce with green peas, carrot etc. 

                      The second one is a chicken preparation in white sauce garnished with boiled vegetable etc. Both are complete food themselves and extremely delicious. Price is medium, ambiance is good. Only the table for five, in which we were seated, seemed to be small for us. But they have to cater for more. 

And, if the food is good, who cares about space.

Located in the middle of kolkata's most famous street, it has been one of my favorite places because of their heritage dishes namely Cold chicken and salad, Chicken steak.

Last date of visit: 19th may,13... Finally i could manage a place on a Sunday afternoon at  around 1.30. Though the place was empty but i was seated in a  very small table of two which was very very close to another table. Since i wasn't comfortable i asked the manager to put me in a different table but my request was not entertained. 

AMBIANCE: Not a very spacious restaurant, decor is a bit shabby. It is crowded most of the time specially during dinners BUT when it comes to their FOOD- they serve some really good sizzlers and cold buffet. Offers a wide variety of sizzlers and continental dishes which are very tasty. They haven't compromised on their food quality over the years.
SERVICE: The service is good, We ordered a dish by mistake thinking it to be a sizzler but they were nice enough to replace it.
PRICE: A meal for two will cost somewhere arnd Rs 1000 incld taxes. (without drinks)

Wishing them all the best, keep up the good food part!

this place is another classic example of how vintage kolkatan dining experience used to be..perfectly located in the posh location of park street,this place offers an array of delicacies which are going to take you to a ride of food heaven.but i would request you to give the indian part of the menu a miss,as they serve lip-smacking continental delicacies..chicken a la kiev is my all-time fav.. along-with steaks,sizzlers and other dishes..surprisingly they prepare one of the best risotto that i have ever tasted..simply perfect,and i must humbly tell you that i have ha my fair hare of risottos across the globe..the ambiance is classy and old-fashioned with comfortable seating arrangements on leather couches..service is prompt and warm,makes your fooding experience rather enjoyable and memorable one..again i do not see the point of urging my fellow zomatans to step in and try as i am sure almost everyone has been there at least once in their life..

Visit the old favourite of the city and you'll never regret it. Food is great, service is good and ambience is old classic type, good.

Everything tastes good here, but continentals are still better. Fish ala diana and chicken paprika are the best. A must try. The ambience is similar for both mocambo and peter cat(which is just on the opposite side of the street)..but its definitely among the best restaurants in kolkata.. So just go and give it a shot.. U will never be disappointed..

I have visited Mocambo very many times and this place has never failed to satisfy me! The ambiance is of the good old days, not too much, just nice pretty and comfortable. The green or red leather couch welcomes one and all, though they are a bit heavy to lift or move! 
The menu is extravagant, and elaborate. I am sure it gets difficult for people to choose. However i usually recommend this place for its continental than its Indian. Over the years I have formed a list of my favourites and i usually stick to the list! I list up my favourites below :
1. Chicken paprika,
2.Chicken cordon bleu
3. Chicken Pavlograd
4.Chicken Tetrazini
5, Fish A la Moutarde
6. Ham steak 
7. Chicken steak! 
Their Tetrazini is the best by far that I have tasted. Chicken Pavlograd is a really nice modification of my favourite chicken a la Kiev! Fish a la Moutarde has a little Bengali touch to the dish which I love! Their Ham steak is my all time favourite! Unfortunately I have never tried any dessert here since i have always been full by the time I'm done with the main course. The sound scrumptious too, so please try! 
Service is quick,friendly and accurate! Please visit and Enjoy! :)

Went to Mocambo yesterday with my family. Chose our starters from the day's special list, & were quite good. In the main course, Chicken Tetrazzini, Chicken Steak, Chicken Chipolata & Prawn Thermidor was ordered along with Mutton Rogan Josh & Keema Nan. The Continental dishes were awesome but the same cannot be said of the North Indian dishes, they were average. The price is on the expensive side. The biggest turn-off is the long serving time, which is about 20 minutes. Overall a good experience.

Located bang in the middle of Kolkata's entertainment street, the food here is quintessentially continental. The chicken cordon bleu is exquisite, so are the cream soups. But what takes the cake is it's list of sizzlers. The bekti steak being really good. The ambiance leaves an old world charm. The best part is the fact that it's not too pricey.

You can always get to Mocambo with a couple of friends to have a quiet dinner and a glass of wine to accompany it. The ambience is kind of old and comfortable. Service though not very friendly, is very efficient. 



I have been there a lot, from the times when eating out in Kolkata meant 2 or 3 places in Park Street. I have tried almost all their continental dishes (I am not a big fan of North Indian cuisine). You can always start with a Mulligatawny Soup. And then scratch your head deciding on the main course. I don't like their risottos. But everything else in the menu is a culinary delight. You can be conservative with a Chicken Stroganoff or be experimental and order "Surf & Turf", its all safe. Wash it down with appropriate glass of wine or if you are a teetotaler their Pineapple Blossom is just the thing for you.

We went to mocambo to try it after a really bad experience - two gents (who they can't seat in the 'family section' - which comprises the entire restaurant except three tables). At 9:20pm, they asked us to come back in half an hour. Promptly, we returned at 9:50 where the most accomplished idiot, Shawn, told us it would be 'two minutes'. Twenty minutes later, we were told that the party whose table we were supposed to get we're 'paying the bill'. Ten minutes later (and remember you are waiting in sweltering heat ON THE ROAD), we ask to see the table where we find the diners casually finishing their mains. Upon expressing our dismay, we were faced with yet more arrogance and not an iota of remorse. PLEASE don't visit this place unless you've got absolutely nothing better to do than wander about the streets of Calcutta in the middle of summer, hungry, sweaty and filled with rage for Shawn and his non-existent partner.

In the beginning only I would like to say there is nothing really negative about the place and the only reason why I deducted 0.5 is due to small and crumbed up place and it is always crowded. I love their food whether Continental or the hot and spicy Indian food. I have been going to this place since I guess I was 5 years old and believe me till date they have never disappointed me. The pricing is reasonable compared to food quality and quantity and you should complain about its prices. Let me warn do come early because this place is super crowded all the time especially weekends and you got to wait for a minimum of 15-20 minutes which is horrible if you are hungry. The service is swift and impressive. This one is located just before 'Tung Fung ' the lane opposite to 'Flurys'. 
Overall a must visit place do not miss this one at any cost.

It used to be a good place for "food priced reasonably" and, long hours of talk. However, I've noticed that it has steadily declined in service and food quality over the last 2 years. The upholstery and the general maintenance of the restaurant is taking a hit. I'd recommend steering clear of the salads - they use a form of mayonnaise that might just not be suitable for the palate. Stick to the recommendations and perhaps you may have a better chance of having a good meal. The lunch crowd during weekdays is very loud, so, if you are unfortunate, you will be squeezed in between two loud bunches of lunch patrons who couldn't care less if you are having a bad "man in the middle" situation.

I wanted to say something really poetic and exuberant about Mocambo but really, it's just gone to that place where there is no redemption. A couple years after I moved out of this city proper I went back here. People had always raved about their devilled crabs, prawn cocktails, their a la kievs, fish a la dianas, baked alaskas, and that was good enough reason. 
I am no food connoisseur. I don't really understand subtle differences in textures, flavourings and etc. Here is what I do know - stale mashed potatoes do not cut it for me, steaks made from minced meat are not steaks after all, and tasteless crabs bereft of crab-meat and full of shells are not my idea of a great starter. 
Mocambo, i have come to believe, runs solely on its name these days. And it costs a bomb compared to Park Street standards. I'd much rather visit any other establishment on Park Street that doesn't make a big deal out of the number of years it's been around and serves a good meal instead. Visit it if you want to go "Mocambo" but not if you want "great, value-for money food" that is readily available elsewhere in this city.

Mocambo has a nice, cosy, old-worldly ambiance.
Food is pretty good. We ordered Devilled Crab, Pork Yorkshire and Fish Wellington.
The Devilled Crab was amazing. Rich and chessy, just the way I like it. The portion was however a bit small. Pork Yorkshire was good, I would say, but not amazing. Fish Wellington was also quite yummy, however it tasted a tad bit similar to the Deviled crab....a mistake we made in ordering.
 
As far as service is concerned, the staff is courteous. However a big turn off was the serving time, which was definitely on the higher side. Also, the waiters had to be reminded again and again for the bill....

The pricing is quite moderate compared to its other upmarket competitors. 

All in all, its definitely worth a try.

It was once a premiere restaurant in the Park Street area. Now, with the innumerable fine dining restaurants and smaller food joints dotting the area, it might have lost its relevance to the present younger generation, but still remains one of the hot  favorites for persons who used to frequent Park Street in & around early/mid 2000's or prior to that.

Coming to the food, their prawn cocktail is one of the finest served in Kolkata. Even I enjoyed it in spite of not being a great prawn lover. Next comes the Chicken Sicilliene - oh ! how I love this tender chicken with mushroom and asparagus in cream sauce baked with cheese. Yummylicious I say. Chicken tetrazini and Ham Steak mushroom are well worth mentioning. 

If you would prefer some old world charm of Park Street in place of the prevailing glitz and glamor, then do try out Mocambo, I bet you won't be disappointed.

If anyone wants to experience the ambiance of a typical Calcutta Restaurant of the 1960s, should dine at Mocambo !!!  It has its own class and charm.  I suggest that you try out from its various fish dishes.  Cost of food is reasonably cheaper for its class of restaurant.  I strongly recommend it to food lovers.

One word "wooow". I would love to come back again and again. 

1. Great Ambiance - I always like it every time I have entered the place. 

2. Italian Food - I found everything best. The Italian food they serve is authentic.  I have lived in Rome for 2 years, I can vouch for the taste. I recently tried Carbonara - awesome !!!

you may try anything. You are going to like it.

3. Staff - they are helping and have good knowledge of the menu and how it is prepared.

4. Decor - attracting 

5. Pricing - not pricy.

Agreed that the food is good , the ambience is nice , but the service SUCKS ! AND I REALLY MEAN IT... took my guests from Bangalore there , and to our rudest shock , the waiters were the so disrespectful and so lazy . We asked them to suggest a good Dish , the reply was : ALL IS WRITTEN , JUST SEE AND ORDER!!!
They hover around you until they rush you into ordering a dish!!

A legendary restaurant with a HUGE gulf between the quality of food and quality of service. While iterms like the Devilled Crab and the Prawn Cocktail are unforgettable, the waiters, especially the maitre-de's are least bothered about giving you a friendly hospitable experience.
 Arrive anytime after 8pm for dinner and the surly one will make you wait outside for 60-90 minutes--you can't leave your mobile number and come back afterwards, as you would with any civilised place, because this is the GREAT Mocambo--the sad thing is that the older generation does wait, because it respects the place so much--the younger generation knows that for every place which can't be bothered whether you stay or go, there's a dozen others waiting for your custom. 
Add to it, the other maitre-d', the smooth one, who will insist you take bread rolls, bill you for the same and never actually deliver them to your table!
Not a place I'm planning to come back to, despite the excellant food.
I'm sure Mocambo will still get on just fine, though--there are just too many oldies and foreign tourists, who know the name and will keep on coming back there.

I have been going to Mocambo ever since I was a child and I have been having their Chicken Ala Kieve every time I go and it's the best there. However I tried their fish Diana, for the first time today and was somewhat disappointed as it was merely cheese an tomato. I also sampled from my friends chosen dishes and found everything overtly cheesy and tasting somewhat similar. It wasn't bad but Mocambo seems to have remained stuck in time. Even their decor has become a bit shabby. But everything becomes negligible when you try their baked Alaska-the sizzling marshmallow topped ice-cream is one of the best ever and when you leave the restaurant, you relish the old world charm it retains. I will definitey go back again and again- because for me it serves my comfort food! I won't experiment there. One of the best things about Mocambo is it's pricing which is very modest and doesn't pinch your pocket too much. It's quaint and could do with a bit of redecoration but when one sums it all up- one goes out with a smile!

We(4) went to Mocambo on 26th February, 2013. The ambience was good and the service was fairly quick.
We had prawn cocktail, and the two types of crabs for starters. All were very good(specially since our tummies were empty!!). For main course we had Mocambo's special Sizzlers. We took Fish Steak Sizzler and Chicken Chipolata Sizzler. As they say, the sizzlers really did the talking! Delicious! Last of all we had Meat Lasagne. It was the best of the lot! So delicious that it can't be expressed in words! The food was heavy due to all the cream and mayonnaise.
Overall, it was good experience.

N.B.- Compared to the quantity, the price is high.

The first time i went to mocambo i had to wait for three long hours outside. Why?? because not even one table was free. So i waited outside seeing those people relishing their food. But then when my turn came and i went inside i came to know why i had to wait the food really desevered to be relished, especially the beef steak.

Where do you think you can get authentic Chinese, lip-smacking Italian and mouthwatering north Indian cuisines at affordable rates? Well, just visit Mocambo at Park Street when your gut craves any of the above delicacies! As you walk in, you can see a cosmopolitan crowd inside Mocambo - tables occupied by foreigners, Anglo-Indians and of course, food loving Bengalis who are ready to taste delicious dishes. The restaurant has become even more popular all over India after being shown in the super-hit Bollywood movie Kahaani released last year. People rush to the place where Vidya Balan was seen sipping coffee in the movie. 
Well, I got a chance to taste the food at Mocambo before Kahaani hit the silver screen. We were a group of four friends who were tired after a shopping spree at New Market, dropped in at Mocambo to taste their delicacies. Mocambo's colorful and elegant decor impressed us. The dimly lit lamps hanging from the ceiling creates a warm, romantic and cozy ambience. We had ordered Devilled Crab, Angels on Horse Back, Chicken A La Kiev (my favourite!), Chicken Pavlograd, Spaghetti Bolognaise and Mixed Fried Rice. Our desserts included delicious Coupe Mocambo and Chocolate Delight. 
Each item was just perfect! The chef knows what spices and herbs to add to make each dish delectable. We could not taste their north Indian dishes, though I have heard that Mocambo prepares some exotic north Indian cuisine. 
Satisfied after having eaten perfectly flavored Italian and Chinese dishes, we have decided to eat here time and again. The money that you spend here is worth the food that you get to taste here. And what shall I say about their service! The reputation of any restaurant depends on the competence and efficiency of its staff. Mocambo employs competent and efficient waiters who responds to your needs promptly. 
So, the next time if you are in or around Park Street do not forget to taste delicacies at Mocambo!

Lovely ambience and a wide variety of options to suit your palate. I was spoilt for choice between the pork sirloin steak, pork cutlets and surf and turf. There was plenty of Kolkatas famous beteki fish was well on the menu. And I was amazed by the price points. Lobster Thermidor for 500 Indian rupees was quite amazing. I opted to satisfy my meat and seafood craving by opting for the surf and turf which consisted of a nice beef steak accompanied by 4 large prawns in a perfectly flavored pepper sauce accompanied by sautéed vegetables. I also tried the grilled beteki which had a light egg batter and was cooked to perfection. And the fish was really fresh. Competent efficient and courteous service, a true reflection of Bengali hospitality.

Ambience: Decorated wall mirrors, focus lightings on each table and leather upholstered plush seats takes you to the bygone cabaret-era! A great place for a romantic evening with that special someone. Love it.
Service: No service glitches so far for this foodie at Mocambo. Found the service regular.
Food: I love their continental spread so much that I havn't bothered to try the other cuisines here, even after umpteenth visits.
Recommendation: Chicken tetrazzini (cheese lovers' delight) or Chicken ala Kiev (butterlovers' paradise) are to die for...the seafood options are good too! A word of caution for the weekend night long waiting period though.

One of my favourite restaurants for Continental Cuisine in Kolkata, Mocambo is one of the prime eateries in Park Street area with some great delicacies. A good ambience and lovely service makes it a nice place to dine . If you can get through the queue outside , you will have a ball of a time specially for continental delicacies. Do not forget to try the innovative 'Chicken Pavlograd' , the awesome 'Chicken Tetrazini' and other continental dishes. 

A lovely place to dine for couples as well as the family. Pocket -pinch is a bit high but somewhere you need to compromise to get the feel , isn't it? Those who love continental food and have never been there, check it out !

Why do people still visit Mocambo? I was there today for the second time in the past year and was shocked to see and taste the degradation. The food is going downhill by the day and the management don't seem to care. They are happy with the ques outside their restaurant, nevermind the quality of food they serve. The food I ordered included a Prawn Muniere which was prepared in a questionable oil in which fish had been fried before. It stunk so much that I couldn't finish the dish. The Fish Muniere was inedible, the fish had gone bad - and the management agreed with me and took it off my bill. 

Mocambo had been my favourite haunt since Sky Room shut it's doors. It was THE place to go for Continental cuisine. But alas, gone are the glory days for this restaurant. It might still lure in the crowds for it's economical pricing, but connosuiers of good food are well advised to avoid this place. I hope Mr. Kothari is listening.

I don't agree with the view that Mocambo is "the" place for continental food in Kolkata. It is definitely a very good restaurant, but surely there are better places. First of all getting a table is an ordeal here. If you manage to get in, the service is very rude and lousy. They consider themselves pompous representatives of an era that sadly does not exist any more. In this paisa-vasool and value-for-money age, you cannot really expect a customer to be in awe of a restaurant where he goes, unless the place itself demands and extracts that respect from him. Mocambo does not, and so the behaviour of the staff comes across as childishly rude, unreasonable and outrageous at times. Their attitude is that they don't care if they lose you as a customer - there is a queue outside the gate, they point out. This outlook is slowly chronicling their shark jump. The ambience is good, but the service really spoils it.

But still in spite of this negative beginning, I had to end up giving it 3.5 because once you are through with the service, when the food lands on your table, it is delectable. The kebabs are fantastic and the presentation is splendid. The chicken a la kiev or  the grills are all-time favourites at this place. As I said earlier, the continental spread is overhyped, there is nothing more special about it that sets it apart from other places. Maybe 25 years back when there were no other options, people used to go ga-ga over their food, but they have failed to capture that market monopoly since the turn of the century. In the dessert section, the baked alaska is a classic.

Verdict: If you are ready to overlook their shortcomings, the food is fine, although heavily priced - I would put you at Rs. 1200 ($25 around) for two adults.

Mocambo a nice place if u like continental food. Indian food though might not be the best in town but nevertheless is satisfactory. The decor is cool but would be preferred more by couples and youngsters. Service is nice. People who don't prefer places with loud music and noise would definitely prefer mocambo. Overall a pleasant experience.

Old charm of ParkStreet.. delicious cuisin.. Mocambo is keeping all the traditions of excellence! The nice retro ambience, warm behavior of the staffs.. will fill your heart! 

The serving time was li'l on the higher side.. the hot 'chanachur' helped us killing our time, as well as our apetite :-( The Prawn Cocktail arrived in a while.. We somehow felt that the cocktail sauce is way more sweet... :-( 
Then arrived the Devilled crab.. the softest crab flesh i've ever had! Tender crab flesh prepared with cheese & herbs.. melted in our mouth within a second! 
Chichen Ala Kiev was the next to appear.. an authentic dish with some superb flavours! Cutting Ala Kiev with a knife itself was soooo exciting :-P Tasted awesome,believe me!! We finished it in a jiffy...!! 
Next comes Fish Ala Diana.. Fish stuffed with prawn,mushroom & some vegetables cooked in rich creamy white sauce.. tasted yummmyyyy!!! 
Not to forget the Meat Lasagne, which was ordered by an ardent mutton-lover... Mutton keema with loads & loads of cheese.. 

To get out of the cheesy feeling inside, we decided to order a Mixed Tandoor sizzler, which contained varieties of kebabs of chicken, mutton, liver, fish, panner, tomato & potato in a sizzling platter.. loved the look, loved the smell, loved the sizzling sound, last but not the least, loved the taste of these indian delicacies! 

Next was the time for some dessert.. We ordered Baked Alaska, Chocolate souffle, & Caramel Cream.. Baked Alaska appeared with the flames.. the egg-cream-fruit combo was mind-blowing as ever! The chocolate suffle was just perfect... & the Cream Caramel.. was the best that I have had in my life! 

Full & content, we were done with our Mocambo trip! The topping was the Banarasi Pan just outside Mocambo.. Do not miss it!! :D

Give it a shot ...but service is pathetic !

  After watching Kahaani  was resolute  on my next trip to Kolkata must visit this restaurant .
Located on  Park Street thisrestaurant is always crowded  ... even at 3pm !
It was interesting to see the crowd at this restaurant ...a mix of anglo -indians , foreigners  and hard core bong foodies !
Decor is colorful and pleasant ,  the hanging lamps give it a cosy feel ! What disappointed me was the service , the waiters seem to be least bothered -  waiting  time for the food was too long . We had ordered a  Lobster Thermidor which was good  but not too impressed with the portion .
We also ordered chicken and fish steak it was ok ...must say I have had better steak s    !
 Try out the Angels on Horse back its one of  their signature   dishes !
So on the whole not too impressed  but no harm give it a shot atleast once !

Had a chance to go to Mocambo after a very long long time. Was amazed to see the crowds outside the restaurant even in these times of plentiful choice. The service was relaxed (which is an euphemism for slow and chilled out). The chairs seems to have been the same ones the restaurant had when they started out I think. Thoroughly enjoyed the Devilled Crab and Angels on Horseback. For dessert, had the Baked Alaska which could have done with some more ice-cream - seemed to have too much egg for the amount of ice-cream. Coming from Delhi, was pleasantly surprised at the cost - was extremely reasonable at Rs 1400 for a dinner for 2.

All in all, a great experience as always.

Actually the wholesome food experience is like a mightbe in this famous Dine-inn, the restaurant is not that hassle-free. It requires great patience, few outbursts and company of a lady perhaps, to get one inside the place. Minimum waiting time is around 45mins. They accept no reservations, happen to go by the FIRST-COME-FIRST-SERVE basis. However, in reality it happens at the discretion of the staff, taking the names, who actually are very impolite and have a disgusting behaviour. This happens all the time these days. Recommended for only good food, but at the cost of time, patience,money of course and RUTHLESS BEHAVIOUR!!!!!!

People say this place dishes out good continental. Well decent food moderately priced good location - yeah, but good continental - nah, sorry folks can't agree. 

Before getting into too many details; the food is good, price is affordable, very long waiting time, ambience cozy, dim lighting (personally I like it kinda gives you a bit of privacy), cutlery is old but clean enough, service depends - are you from Calcutta - if yes then you won't bother if not you will find it below par. Most of them don't come from a hotel management institute and have been working here for better part of their life. Some of them actually knows some customers by their name :) 

Key thing to remember here - they don't take reservation during weekends. Seating is boxed up - five's a crowd. 

Going by the traditional definition of continental cuisine yeah they seems to have the french and Italian combination. But stuff like good olive oil, fragrant herbs - rosemary thyme for flavoring, red wine, garlic, black n white pepper  and cheese - all seems to be there but it fails to create that quintessential continental taste I'm looking for. 

My quick pick 
Chicken Cordon Bleu
Fish Florentine ( Not sure if its Beckty or Basa )
Angels on Horse back 
Chicken a La Kiev ( if you're health conscious watch out)
Chicken Paprika
Beckty Belle Helen
Lobster Thermidor (too darn small :> ) 
Fish a La Diana

From the Indian 
Firdosi Kebabs 
Tandoori Chicken

There are some Sizzler options, worth trying, ain't bad. 

If I were you, I will stay away from beef and pork main dishes. That meat is not safe in Calcutta and leads to issues with your skin - stay away from that. 

Enjoy the meal.

Mocambo has been our favourite restaurant for "Continental" food. And, some of our favourites are Chicken Ala Kiev and its variation Chicken Pavlograd, Fish florentine, Chicken Steak and Baked Alaska. Normally, at lunch-time there is a wait for a table, but if you do not want to wait then reach around noon.

There is not much of a scope to "share" jokes on www.zomato.com unlike other social networking sites. I'll try breaking that myth today, right now. :) 
If you're in a mood to read a good joke and have a laugh/smile, read on, else you can do some serious work of yours. :P
Stepped into this place and was greeted with a staff arranging a chair for us to seat.Very pleasant sight indeed.  Comfy chairs,fancy lights, has got all the ingredients to be a so called premium dining place, just lacks salt. Ooops!
A well dressed waiter comes in smiling.We order a Screwdriver and a Carbonara.
Screwdriver had nominal quantity of alcohol in it (far from what a screwdriver should be). The chips given with it tasted cheap! 30 minutes since we have placed orders. We order one more Screwdriver... Almost 45 minutes on the clock and the hunger keeps growing. By the time the drinks are gone its almost an hour! 
We call him and ask "Where the hell is our Carbonara brother?"
He says "DID YOU ORDER A CARBONARA? !!!" :P
Really? WTF man! :D :D :D 
When served we realize it was in the kitchen and no one even knew :) 
Tasted pretty good though... but there was no time to appreciate the taste since we were HUNGRY! 
Without wasting further time we called for the cheque and a waiter stood by watching us take out the money. "Show me the money!"
No one even cared to come and ask if we needed something else all the time we were sitting there.
We paid just the amount and left NO tip. The waiter stared as if it was mandatory! We're glad that money was not snatched from us. Phew!
We were hungry and angry but we laughed much on this restaurant while coming out.
They win a "BIG JOKE" tag from us! :D

PRICE : INR 800 + Taxes for a couple. If you really have some extra money, spend it wise, please.
DECOR : 5/10 A big semi-dark place.
FOOD : 7/10 Make sure you have plenty of time to waste though.
SERVICE : Are you kidding me?
VISIT AGAIN? : You're kidding me... Ain't you? :D

Mocambo is my all time favourite. Since my college days I have been a regular visitor at Mocambo. The dim lit restaurant with red lamp shades gives you a an excellent ambience. Courteous staff, comfortable seating, location (Parksreet- Free school street corner) and above all good food mark the restaurant. The the range of sizzlers are absolutely stunning. Chicken chipolata is one of my favourites. Its not just tasty but quite filling. Another of their continental speciality is angels on horse back- the bacon wrapped chicken in it is quite tempting!!! At the end...don't forget to leave some space for the caramel custard.On the top of it the drinks are reasonably priced as well!!!

Pocket pinch- Rs 1000 (for two without alcohol)
Suitable for family gatherings
Valet parking unavailable

Overall a good place for great food at a reasonable price!!

I once had what was supposed to be a Risotto at Mocambo. And the least that the dish resembled was a Risotto. Instead of small-grained Arborio, it was made of long-grained Indian rice. Instead of the sticky, creamy consistency of the risotto, this was dry, and could be called Fried Rice. Later, I heard from friends that Mocambo has just a couple of specialties. And woe be to the unsuspecting eater who orders anything but these!

Again food was good but the service was disgusting...The captain did not care at all...whats wrong with the service in these restaurants.Most of them lack a little effort to improve the service.Had to wait 20 mins for drinks and 45 mins for food...and moreover the waiters did not even care  to come back and ask for further assistance once the food was served.

The king of all restaurants in Kolkata(and that is saying a lot since Kolkata is the food capital of our nation). Lovely retro decor, comfortable seating and polite service. You'll feel transported to Kolkata in its heydays. 

Best part of it all, the delicious food and the interesting description of the items on the menu - entree, main course or dessert. Don't be fooled by its per-dominantly continental fare. Mocambo dishes out some of the most sumptuous kebabs in Kolkata. Try the murg firdosi kebab if you think I am exaggerating.

Hard to single out any item as the most special. They are all superb.

One of friends took me out to Mocambo.....and mentioned "Conti" food and i was a bit confused at first must say....because up north in NCR Conti for most part has become synonymous with a smattering of baked this and grilled that at least in the muddle class restr....the only evolved conti food i had was really in Army Messes by cook specials

Anyhow on entering Mocambo the ambiance is pleasantly and definitely of a Time gone by....so cheers to them for maintaining it that way

Thereafter i look at the Menu and you know this is not a for show only conti food restraunt...another pleasant shocker were the prices maybe its Cal vs Delhi but for this kinda menu and this kinda setting compared to our dear Gurgawa and Dilli it was a steal

Anyhow we started with the Prawn cocktail which was done as it should be ...did not stand out eitherways was as exactly expected

Thereafter we ordered an unfamiliar dish for me Pepper Devilled Crab....wow what was that....absolutely amazing dish the pepper hits you at the end only after you have negotiated the creaminess of the Crab

We ordered the Chkn Cordon Bleu and Beckty Diane together maybe a mistake...as both were very nice dishes however in out eagerness to understand the sauce of the Diane the Cordon Bleu got a little cold however good stuff either ways

Must visist place....and great to find true blue conti restraunts still alive in the country at affordable prices

I am slashing down your rating because of previously unseen and inhuman gesture of my beloved restaurant...... hopefully I won't visit again unless you guys publicly apologize.My first introduction to continental food was through this icon at park street. It was love at first bite with their buttery chicken a-la-kiev which grew stronger gradually with items like devilled crab,lobster thermidore,mutton tetrazini,chateubriand beef steak, bhetki munierre, pork cutlet over the years. Their main drawbacks are, long waiting que at weekends, laid back table service,long waiting period for the foods due to their small kitchen. I think they should revamp their kitchen by extending it a bit with reduction of a few seats.

Went to Mocambo for Dinner on Saturday and had a very bad experience. Not that it was too late or too crowded.

To start with, we were seated and no-one looked interested in taking order. The Captain was standing in a corner and busy stretching himself. After waiting for nearly 10 minutes and some arm waiving he noticed and came to our table. We ordered for Drinks and starters.

The drinks arrived promptly (in those ugly long water glasses - wonder why don't they use better quality glasses for Drinks). The waiter plonked the whiskey glasses on the table and left. No water or ice served along with. On being asked he got water but still no Ice. We called him 3rd time for the ice.
I had three drinks and each time I had to ask for Ice.

Now Food: We had ordered for Fish Tikka.... the dish came - 5 tiny bite sized pieces very bland to taste. Wonder why they do not serve a mint sauce or chutney with their Indian Starters? I told my friends that their Continental food is better, so we ordered for Fish Fingers. I was pretty amazed to see Fish fingers that tapered at both ends. The fish inside was hard and very dry to taste.

we requested our host (who incidentally is also a hotelier) to move to some other place for Dinner.

Good if you want to have very Indianised Continental food. Most of the dishes are heavily Cream laden but tasty..... But please do not dare to eat their Indian spread... It is pathetic to say the least.

This was the second time I went to Mocambo, well to say the least it has let me down in the main course. The garlic tossed mushroom prawns and the meat lasagna were a delight, but unfortunately the chicken ala kiev was a gore fest... shredded chicken fried with crumbs with gallons of butter which makes you want to puke, it was a mood spoiler really. The desert "baked alaska" here is awesome. The supposedly tasty cocktail, bloody Mary (coz I am not a teetotaler)was according to my friend more tomato soup and less of an alcoholic infusion, the waiters are uncouth and disgusting wanting a heavy tip always. The sizzlers are great too. One advice do not try Indian here, stick to continental. Summing up, some items might be awesome but nasty surprises are awaiting if you fail to choose well.

Mocambo !!!!!!!  This means sizzlers. Particularly chicken breast sizzlers with peeper sauce. It is just mouth watering dish. I had sizzler in many places in India but I don't know why it has left a print in my mind. I just love this place not only for sizzlers; the ambiance has a haze effect of old Calcutta.

Great food. I loved my meaty risotto! And it converted my dad, who wasn't convinced on the idea of continental food. Him saying that the food was nice was a huge compliment from someone who prefers spicy North Indian food to anything else and isn't shy to voice his feelings about food he didn't like(I should know, my cooking has been slagged a lot).
Wish I could give it more than 3 stars but there were some disappointments. The service was slow, the servers weren't attentive and some looked like they were day dreaming. Took forever to take our order. My soup was lukewarm when it came out, and had crab shells in it.
Though all of that could've been a one off thing as I didn't see anyone else complaining, they were too busy wolfing down everything in front of them.

Mocambo is one of the most well known restaurants in Park street. Its one of my favorite for continental food in the locality. The last time I went there I tried  the Pork chops. The chops were just excellent. I have rarely had better pork chops at all. So my advice to all is to try the Pork chops. Apart from that the devils crab is my all time favorite starter. Other chicken grills are also pretty good. The lasagnia is good. The overall food quality is very good and the quantity is also fine. Prices are pretty decent. Ambiance is  good. Overall a good place for family dining. Definitely recommended.

On my last visit to Kolkata with the insistence of my Cousin we all went to this place for dinner. Very well located in Park Street, this place has a old world charm. 
We had to wait for more than an hour though they initially informed that it will not be more than 10-15 min. Earlier in the evening we also tried to book a table but they refused. Anyway we waited patiently as my cousin was very particular for this place only.
We ordered Chicken a la kiev, Fish A la Diana, Devil Crab, Chicken Steak Sizzlers, and Grilled Chicken Sizzlers. 
Food was delicious. Chicken a la kiev was a real surprise with butter filled chicken breast.. 
Service was a little laid back. After twice pursue, they was attending us.. 
Ambiance had an old world charm... felt like we were sitting in a restaurant of 80's. May be they are making an constant effort for doing the same due to their popularity with the oldies ;) 
Anyway it is a nice place to dine if want to try Continental Food.

One of the most popular restaurants in Park Street, especially known for continental food. I have visited the place, like, over a hundred times in the last 10 years. It has  a good ambience and serves decent continental food.
Following are the "must-haves":-
  1. Devilled Crabs
  2. Fish-Ala-Diana
  3. Beckty Muniere
  4. Chicken Oriental-Ala-Mocambo
  5. Angels on Horse Back
But.....however wholesome the food experience mightbe, the restaurant is not that  hassle-free. It requires great patience, few outbursts and company of a lady perhaps, to get one inside the place. Minimum waiting time is around 45mins. They accept no reservations, happen to go by the FIRST-COME-FIRST-SERVE norms. However, in reality it happens at the discretion of  the staff, taking the names, who actually are very impolite and have a disgusting behaviour. They keep you waiting for hours while allowing another party, just showing up. This happens all the time these days. And if you happen to be an "All-boy-gang", then you get to face the most difficult challenge. 
Recommended for good food, but at the cost of time, patience,money of course.......and BAD BEHAVIOUR!!!!!!

Mocambo has become one of the landmark eateries in town. The fascinating part of it is that though it has an old world charm still it pools in the young crowd in hoards.

Kolkata or the people of Kolkata, has this unique romanticism of Continental Food. I really don't know what is the so called continental food. Mocambo to me is a good restaurant at a good location. But hugely hyped for it's continental food. Liked few dishes made here but never felt excited on the so called - continental dishes.

The place had a decent waiting list (considering it was Sunday evening 9pm at a restaurant that recently featured in the hit movie Kahaani), still wait-time was at par with neighbours Peter Kat and Barb-q.

Once in, the ambiance was pleasant (not too noisy like a peter cat), though the table cloth should have been replaced much earlier in the evening. Being a vegetarian, food choices always remain limited however compared to the neighbouring joint, Mocambo had enough veg items in baked and continental - the Veg Arabiani tasting pleasant enough along with Veg Sheekh Kabab. 

Prices are moderate and dinner for two (without drinks) would range within 900. Overall, good value for money and would try the sizzlers next time I visit.

Note - avoid the cocktails unless absolutely necessary and stick to regular drinks like whiskey, beer, vodka etc. Both Tom and Rum Collins were poorly concocted and not worth trying.

One of the good place if anybody wants to have Continental food. There Surf N Turf, Pork Chops, Lobster, Sizzlers are very good. There beef item is also cooked well some time ( some time over cooked ). The decoration of this restaurant just like oldies. The mirror in front, reminds you the European style sitting.one thing that make you unhappy, the long waiting line outside the restaurant. But its worth of waiting outside as you will get good food with a right price.

Went there again, yesterday evening. Although, I was wise enough to reach before 7.30 p.m. along with all the people who were supposed to join-in for dinner. (Since it was sunday, had to, otherwise wouldn't have gotten a tale to sit in the 1st place & would have have been told to stand outside like a freeloader! YES, PLEASE NOTE, YOU WILL GET A TABLE ONLY WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THE PEOPLE OF YOUR DINNER-GROUP PRESENT! )

We were a group of 2 couples and a young kid (1&1/2 yrs. old).
Ordered the "Rajma Gulati Kebab", Tandoori Paneer Tikka & Tomato Soup for the ladies. 
The Gulati Kebab was dry, the paneer was well marinated but was not cooked properly. The soup was just above-average (although, if I go by the color of-the-soup alone, it did not look even close to a tomato soup.) 

For dinner, wifey had the veg. Mushroom & Asparagus Risotto. It was made with "basmati rice, canned button mushrooms & canned white asparagus" (no arborio rice)
For the rest 3 of us, ordered the Pindi Chana, Dal Makhani (Black dal) & Paneer Butter Masala along with Masala Kulchas & Tandoori Rotis. Dal was nice, but chana was a bit too dry (although Pindi Chana is supposed to be a bit dry) & Paneer Butter Masala was actually quite tasteless. 

Give me the same items at Amber, bar-b-que & kwality's, anytime, any day of the week, and thee quality remains the same! 

The verdict on Indian food is 2 out of 5.
The verdict on Italian/ conti food is 3 out of 5. 
service 3 out of 5. 

Please visit this place for their Italian & continental fair especially if you are a hardcore non-vegetarian. 

wanted to try the sizzler but that's for next time. one sure thing is that the sizzlers over here are quite famous, going by the no. of orders i saw throughout my whole time at the restaurant, for sizzlers alone. 

the quality of indian cuisine has definitely deteriorated at this restaurant..! 
i have been to MOCAMBO several times before, but never before was i so disappointed with the indian cuisine.

I have reduced my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars, after yesterday's experience.



----- 07 Aug, 2012 -----

This place is more than 50 years old and the reason it's still going strong is because the food quality has not deteriorated over the years. 
A non-veg lover's paradise (although I myself don't eat red-meat), the selections available from the menu are old-school classics that'll not let you down. Sea-food selections available are also great.
The only cons about this place is that you gotta reach early (especially for dinners) and with your whole gang! If 2 people walk-in for blocking a table for even 4-5 people, then you'll have to wait outside on the sidewalk. They don't care even if it is raining! Additionally, it is advisable if you really want to relish the great-taste & quality, go on a weekday rather than on the weekend. 
I've visited this restaurant many times, but my food experience has been best on weekdays, or during lunch-time on weekends! 
Great continental food. The Indian/ Mughlai selection is limited but they're great as well! 
Must try dessert, Baked-Alaska!

Good for your wallet. Good variety to choose from.
Good for people who are tired of Ma-Mashi-Pishi-(Biwi?) recipes - once in a while.
Comes with an old world charm.
Very (very very) crowded place anytime anyday - may make you wait like they do to the freeloaders at the puri jagannath temple.
Very very crowded seating. But you can relax if you are offered a seat (I liked it - reminiscent of my college cafeteria). My wife loathed the cacophony. Every one was talking and every one was within earshot.
But comes with plenty of options within 200 mts to permit you to change your mind. This is desireable. Freedom of choice !! 
4 - stars for just this.

Once you are in Park street there will never be a reason to sulk.

They make some good sizzlers as well. I tried Chicken Chipolata, made with chicken, 3-4 pieces sausage & Bacon & finely cooked vegetable gives it a out of the box taste.
Ambiance is nice & cozy. But they should maintain their washroom.

their chicken a la kiev is though i didn't like much but the fish biriyani was awsum. their grilled hilsa preparation was also not much to write about and every bengali i assume have had a better hilsa experience than theirs.
over all not a bad place, though other than the nostalgia not a must visit place either.

One of the age old eateries in Kolkata. just off Park street.
You can divide the review into two distinct parts: one being the food, and second, the experience.
Talking about the food first. Serves continental fare (if it is) Though some of the items on the menu are constant favorites like the Chicken A la Kiev, Steak Chateaubriand and Irish Steak with molten butter. So one can definitely go for the food, worth it.
Now the others: 
Service is pathetic.
Decor and ambience, what? Old look, large chairs, not at all pleasing , nor comfortable.
Reservsations are not taken. If you go in the evenings you have at least a 45 minute wait. On the road. While an extremely rude door keeper and the waiters keep you out of the place.
Valet Parking, there is none. Self parking, also none.
Toilets, sorry toilet. There is only one small one, terrible. Unclean and stinking.
So take a choice, it is worth braving all the rest just for some decent food?

Have been to this place just once only based on a frens review that their prawn cocktail is authentic and yum but i was disappointed as it wasn't as per my taste. I found it too sweet and after a few bites my stomach felt wriggly , not that their quality was poor or anything as such but i think there was an overdose of mayo n tomato ketchup. Apart from that i tried the chipolata which again wasn't up to mark. I guess i tried all the wrong dishes. I am told this place is a must visit for foodies but since  I  like spicy food, i thought their food was sweet.

Apart from that, like the ambience, quite old school so in this fast paced life u are automatically attracted to it but service was average. 

Drinks were decent and price...hmmm since its in park st. u cant blame for having to shell out lil extra dough.

Have been visiting Mocambo for so many years now. their sizzlers and steaks used to be just out of this world, however, now sadly its no longer amazing. though taste wise it is still awesome but the portion size and the cuts of the meat is really not upto the mark. They now serve a lot of liver and sausage etc instead of more meaty cuts in their steaks and sizzlers. the seats are all too close to each other and there is hardly any space between the tables. overall though the taste and the pricing is good the quality of food and the ambience have become very average in comparison to the more newer restaurants in town.

Chicken Sizzler, A-La-Kiev, Muniere, Crab dishes, Kebbabs, Biriyani, Garlic Naan, Rogan Josh... the list of my personal favourites doesn't end. The only items I have never really enjoyed here are the desserts, but again, after a full stomach of the above mentioned items, there is little space and psyche for the desserts. 
Over the years, I have noticed that the quantity has decreased. Five years back, one sizzlers was enough for me, but these days it has to be complemented with something more. Well, may be my appetite has increased.
The sitting area is very old fashioned, but it has a charm of its own. It dates back, perhaps to the colonial era. 
Now the brickbat . When the place is completely full, it feels cramped - and with so many servers moving around, it robs one off the seclusion and privacy expected from a family dinner.

BUT OVERALL EXPERIENCE IS EXCELLENT. 
I will keep coming back here and will recommend it to others.

As one enters the restaurant Mocambo, one is transported into a different era. The old world decor,the nostalgic charm,everything captivates you.Though it is one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata, it stil attracts me eventhough I have visited this place many times.Mocambo is famous for its continental cuisine, especially the chicken a la kiev(I cannot resist it EVER)and chicken chipolata but surprisingly its Indian and Chinese preparations are equally good.Its a place worth visiting with your family and friends.The service is quite satisfactory but the pocket pinch is slightly on the higher side but every penny is worth it.

First try to serve people properly, then focus on providing food. I feel ashamed to have visited this place on multiple occassions. Best of luck with your business after what you have done

we went to mocambo on a rainy afternoon, after entering the restaurant we saw that it was semi-full, ambience was wonderful, we ordered 2 types of chicken kebab, biriyani and their signature dish chicken ala kiev.. waiters were polite and well informed, after waiting for 15 mins we got our foods, biriyani and kebabs were awesome but didnot like ala kiev that much,may be because it was tooo much buttery, though it is famous for its continental foods but we liked north indian foods more than the continental.. price doesnot pinch the pocket, overall very good experience and i will recommend this place to other food lovers..

I have been visiting Mocambo(Park Street) since my schooldays with my family.Now I go with my friends,relatives & family as the ambience there is very good.I took my cousin brother & sister, from USA, to the restaurant last year as the continental dishes are one of the best in the city.I get a good choice of drinks & desserts too.Good service is also a positive factor.

Mocambo's grandeur lies in the style and presentation techniques which is quite uncommon for a pocket friendly restaurant in the heart of Kolkata.
Fish A La Diana
Surf & Turf Sizzler
Greek Drunken Prawn
Beckti Newburg
Devilled Crab
Chicken A La Kiev 
Crepe
ALL THIS ITEMS NEED A SPECIAL MENTION ...........
The ambiance is soothing with pleasant lighting and sitting arrangements.Its not so spacy that U can relax on a couch, but a formal or an informal gathering can very well relax and enjoy, with waiters and manager  well versed with the items in the menu. All you need is to carry around Rs. 1200(Meal For Two)without alcohol and With a few Cocktail it can go up to Rs. 2000.

This is one of those places you never get tired of visiting. It does have its share of haughty waiters who aren't really interested in serving you and politeness is not quite part of their diction. Given that, the food more than makes up for it. And you must try the devilled crabs and the Mutton lasagne. That combination of keema and cheese is pure bliss! Good food and totally worth it!

It's more of a nostalgia, chicken chipolata, ala kiev, and pepper devilled crabs are my personal favourites! The service though is quite poor, I personally felt taken for granted. It's only the food that calls me back every time. You should be aware about the useage of saturated fat in their food though.

One of the best continental restaurants in Park Street. I have friends all over India who have visited this place with me and have gorged down delicacies like Devils Crab, Chicken a La Kiev and the Steak and Sizzlers. Have been eating here every month for the last few years and still not bored. Just an advise, if your visiting on the weekends, try being there around 7:00 pm to avoid waiting outside for your turn!!!

****Never going back again to this restaurant. Shitty attitude.****

                Experience at Mocambo was good. Fish Munia is the dish to go for. Chicken-A-La-Kiev and Fish A La Diana are also too good. The food quality is excellent. The kebabs are not outstanding but they are fine. A restaurant where you can have some quality continental food.

Was invited to a lunch at Mocambo's today, and had a hearty lunch along with some nice Adda. We started with the sausages - tender, fish fingers with tartar sauce - probably the best fish fingers I've had in Cal - Succulent and perfectly seasoned, crisp on the outside, juicy on the inside. My latest drink of choice these days is Fresh lime soda - thanks to the terrible Calcutta heat, it was okayish - not like the amazing fresh lime water I had recently at the Blue Poppy.

For the main course, I had the Beckti Muniere - was delicious, soft, flaky bite sized pieces of fish cooked in the classic butter-lemon-parsley combo. My friends ordered the Chicken A La Kiev - and judging by their expressions - must have been nice. In any case it is one of the most popular continental items in Calcutta across restaurants. I also had ordered a side of Russian Salad - very well made, they achieved the perfect taste, loved it. 

The dessert was the Baked Alaska. Very light, just the right amount of sweet, not cloying. Had always wanted to try it, and loved it. 

Great ambience, and I love their trademark orange low lighting lampshades. It was a full house today, being weekend afternoon and all, and service was slightly slower than normal in the beginning, but revved up during serving the mains and it would be unfair to judge them by just one day.The staff was extremely courteous and knowledgable about the food.  Lovely experience, Would love to re-visit.

Perhaps the restaurant with the best kitchen in Kolkata, indeed, anywhere I have ever eaten. 

Great ambiance, reminiscent of an era of frock coats and evening dresses, and mouth watering dishes. 

Some of the best lobster and crab in town, and of course, one HAS to try the Baked Alaska for dessert. If you like stuff baked in cheese, this is Nirvana. 

The seats could be a little more comfortable though.

Kolkata, the erstwhile capital of India is known for Eden Gardens, Howrah Bridge and yes... Mocambo. The restaurant has been symbolic in Kolkata for almost half a century and it is said that people visit
the land of Didi just to sample the 'Devil's Crab (no pun intended). Draped by coloured lampshades, this is an ideal place to take the family (Grandparents approve of Mocambo too !). The restaurant is
subtly divided into the Family and Stag sections and is also frequented by couples. Though reputed for its Continental food, the quality of the Chinese and Indian food is as good. If you are looking for the
complete dining experience, you have well and truly reached your destination.

One of the oldest restaurants serving continental (some of it the continent may never recognize).

A place where back in the '90's it was the given thing to go for a official celebration.

Decent food with half way decent service most of the time, but not a place where you want to be adventuresome.

Having said that the chicken al kiev was a constant favorite.

I visited Mocambo along with my family. And I did not come back disappointed. We tried Fish A La Diana, Bhetky Muniere and Chicken A La Mocambo. The Fish Diana had a stuffing of Prawn and vegetables in a creamy sauce. This was the best dish I tried here. The Chicken Mocambo is also quite tasty.

I really don't get what the big deal is. I have been to Mocambo several times and each time I came back feeling disappointed. People kept telling me that I did not order right so I kept going back and ordered what they had suggested, but I was still not happy with the food I was served. The fact is that Mocambo has such a fan-following that anyone who has a bad word to say about the place is treated like a freak. So I tried really hard to like the place, just to fit in, till my stomach started groaning in protest. Everything from the Tetrazzini to the Spaghetti to the much-loved specialty dish Chicken A La Mocambo had the same sickening sweet and cheesy flavor to it. The service is mediocre and the ambience will not blow your mind away. In fact the lamps that they hang over each table, although quite pretty, could use some cleaning ( I am not a super-critical customer, in fact I am quite easy to please, but this lamp was centimeters away from my face and it was difficult to ignore the amount of dirt that had accumulated on it over the years).

All in all, I am yet to see as to what's so great about this over-hyped legend. But I must say, that Mocambo does have the potential to be extra-ordinary. Being one of the few specialty-continental places in the city, all Mocambo probably needs is to discover a few more flavours and hire a better cleaning staff.

I can give a large description for this place but i will keep it short. The Best Continental and Indian food within pocket friendly prices. Personally i have been coming here since I was a kid and it is my fav restaurant. Try the Devil Crab, prawn cocktail and the famous sizzlers. You will come back for more.

Mocambo khush kiya! Having a lunch or dinner at Mocambo melts my heart like the butter in a serving of Chicken a La Kiev. If it's continental, it has to be Mocambo on Park Street. The food is really good and I would recommend everyone to try the sizzlers, not to forget their very special Chicken a La Kiev. Ambiance is awesome with large windows overlooking the always-cheerful Park Street. It will give you a feeling of dining in some European restaurant.To me, having Chicken a La Kiev or a sizzler at Mocambo with friends is a day well spent!

Kolkata was a hazy memory to me,But this place wasn't. I clearly remember my friends insisting me to just come here once and I wouldn't regret it. Sure I didn't, in fact the only thing I remember in kolkata is the good food and this place. I savoured every little bit of the Devilled Crabs and Fish Meuniere which my friend told this place is famous for. I Never regretted coming here and will be back every time I land my feet in this city.
Wonderful food, great service and  had an amazing time here.

Ambience: Most restaurants on Park Street (Calcutta's entertainment strip - as in street, not as in one of Helen's seductive variations) are freeze frames of a late 60's - early 70's milieu. Actually the reason closer to home is that the 80's & beyond have brought decadence & decay to this erstwhile queen of entertainment & night life, this side of Paris. Therefore this poorly imitated Pan-European chic of the 70's has remained a central theme in a majority of these eateries & watering holes.

Digression has never been the better part of valour and I meekly return to another freeze frame of days gone by - Mocambo. Music: This place used to really swing in the 60s & 70s. The only music now is the jingle of the cash register. The post 80's era have sounded the death knell for nightlife in Cal. The prohibitive entertainment tax is another inhibiting factor.

Chicken Tetrazini, Fish A La Diana are must try with bread roll and butter.

These two dishes can go with drinks too.

a really good place for a nice meal where both cost and quality are taken care of nicely. if you have a taste palate for lovely continental food or great Indian cuisine and all these for really reasonable price , then this is surely your place.please do try the chicken tetrazzini, whole fried fish, peas pulav, chicken butter masala, chicken paprika and the mouth-watering caramel custard pudding.
