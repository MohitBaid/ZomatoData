I been here 2 to 3 times....if we talk about ambience it is almost good... But in summer being its under open sky... Quite tough to sustain in that place.... Whereas,  on food counter its... Just to say... Ok.  ðŸ‘Œ

Close to a friends house went there on sunday night ambience was good giving you the feel of a punjabi highway dhaba we prefer to have food in dhaba style on the charpoys problem with the restaurant is service as i could hardly find any waiter and after we gave our order had to wait long for the food 
We ordered for dal makhani ,paneer  ,butter nan and hyderabadi biryani 
Dal and panner were good but biryani was bad may be it was late and the cooks were in hurry to return home
I would say that anyone who wants to have dhaba style dinner or lunch should go to this place but avoid the hyderabadi biryani ðŸ˜Š

Located at walking distance from em bypass at vip bazar. Its a kind of open air type restaurant. The arrangement will make u feel like roadside dhaba. Coming to the food quality is not good.below the expectation level. U cant get a normal dhaba type food here. Foods are less spicy and bad in quality. All other things are good but they need to work on it. Its damn bad. Dont know about tandoir items but non veg curry items are too bad. Think before you decide.

We went here today food is on average but service is slow just because of that there is only one person to serve us and others table also. so this is not server's mistake this thing will be manage by owner.Owner should be manage this if we are going somewhere to have dinner or lunch we think we will get first priority.so plz next time aware about it.its not complain it's just request.

Visted this place during the afternoon(Courtesy :Little).Dint find much people around at that time although. Coming to the food, it was awesome both the quality and quantity.The service was mediocre. The decor was something that will really mesmerize u.It gave a pure dhaba feeling... My recoomendation is do visit this place specially in the evening or night.

I basically like their colourful dhaba ambience... they both have outdoor and indoor seating arrangements... Staffs are totally untrained... I ordered for a lassi, chicken tarka and phulka... the serving time was quite long... also tried a coffee flavor hookha that was not at all good... Pocket pinch was ok...

I had been eyeing this place ever since it opened up. We finally made it here yesterday evening as we wanted to have roti-tarka for dinner. Converted from a bus stand into an authentic feel of a dhaba, with the charpoys and steel jugs and glasses. There is also a well right in the middle which isn't a real well, but lit up dimly from inside. It is probably a fountain of sorts. However, there are some fish swimming inside. We loved the ambience created. Along with the charpoys, there are also normal plastic tables and chairs. All of this is open air. There is also a covered seating area which you can use when it rains, Â and for those who want AC, or if it is very hot, they do have an AC room as well. But then, you lose the authenticity of the place - they also serve glass glasses in the AC room.
Well, coming to the food, we ordered just one plate of tarka and some tawa rotis. It was yum! However, the service needs to be improved a bit. There seemed to be only 2 waiters around and it was a wee bit difficult to catch their eye. However, they were very congenial. They had forgotten to give us onions, pickle, and when we asked for it, the waiter apologised profusely. One of the waiters seemed to be new, so I guess he's still learning the tricks of the trade.Â 
An excellent place if you want a real dhaba feel sitting under the stars, just by the noisy road, yet you don't hear much of the noise. The prices are very reasonable. We were also surprised to see the Chinese menu here! It doesn't seem to get very crowded, but what I did gather is that they get quite a bit of orders for packaging.
Overall an enjoyable experience and we will surely be back!

Been here with my family .
Love the food , the people there were very friendly . The quality of the food is undoubtedly best for its price, the place gives feel of a traditional dhaba. A good place if you don't want to travel far and you want a dhaba experience in city limits.

The open air seating arrangement is the best thing about this restaurant. Order a hearty tandoori chicken and enjoy it under the starry sky while basking in the summer breeze. What can get better than that?

This is a real treat in our locality. Just off the E.M. bypass a nicely decoration dhaba. Have visited the place since the day it has opened. Ambiance is good, food is also good. Good place for adda lovers.
