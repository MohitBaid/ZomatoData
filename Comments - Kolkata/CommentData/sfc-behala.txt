This place is a modern day example of "Don't judge a book by it's cover". Run by a very polite father and his son, this place usually may look like a roadside stall but trust me they make the best Fried Chicken in Kolkata(and I am telling you it's way tastier than that of Colonel Sanders!!) . Two huge chunks of crunchy yet juicy meat that's bursting with flavors.Their Chicken Popcorn is absolutely delicious. Small and crunchy yet mouth watering flavors. So if you want your taste buds to experience these heavenly dishes without burning a hole in your pocket, head here.
