Veg Biryani & Noodles @ Go Green, Kolkata ‚ò∫

While ordering Chinese food, it's quite common amongst vegetarians, to opt for - one Noodle dish, one Fried Rice dish and one Veggie rich in soya sauce dish (mostly Manchurian). 

Recently, while ordering a late night Chinese meal via Swiggy, we were not really in the mood to consume any soya sauce. Thus, after quite a bit of thinking and re-thinking, we paired the 'padosi des ka' aka neighboring country's Noodles with 'desi' aka Indian Biryani, thinking that the vegetables and spices of the latter will make-up for the absence of the missing veggie dish.

The items that we ordered were -

- Shanghai Noodles (Rs. 195/-): Well cooked noodles, mainly infused with colored bell peppers and spring onion greens, came with a separate sachet of soya sauce.

Voila! How did they know about our current 'no soya sauce' stance? 

Needless to say, that we never bothered to mix the soya sauce with the noodles.

The noodles were soft and well cooked. The tasted nice.

- Vegetable Nizami Biryani (Rs. 275/-): Whiffing of a nice smell of burnt onions, the Biryani came accompanied with a sachet of thick curd, vinegar onions and green chilly. It comprised of the usual spicy paste, cottage cheese chunks, cauliflower florets etc. 

For serving, we poured some curd over Biryani on each plate and placed along side some chopped and sliced - green chillies and onions.

The Biryani was well cooked and tasted nice, but caused a minor heart burn (acidity), may be because the order was placed late night, and either some part of the dish or the whole dish was perhaps cooked during the earlier part of the day.

Moral of the story - Don't order spicy concoctions for late night bingings.

The cumulative quantity of both the dishes was more than enough for 3 people.

Went to this place on 3rd march with another person,  bought a deal from an app and was not disappointed at all, place is a pure veg restaurant.
Mojito- Average could have put more effort to make it. 3/5
Strawberry Colada- Was very good. 4/5
Paneer butter masala- Tasty gravy.  3.5/5
Aloo Dum Punjabi- Average 3/5
Dal Makhani- Average 3.5/5
Kulcha- Was smaller than naan but good. 3.5/5
Garlic Naan- Average 3.5/5
Chocolate Ice Cream - was crystallized 2.5/5

They have a huge place and if you buy a deal like i did its worth it. Would recommend if you want pyre veg restaurant.

I went here before my first "Work" Monday.  That was the first day of my First Internship. 

Not only was I excited because of my first job, but was looking forward to visit the place for a long time.

In short my experience was different. This was mainly because this was the first time I was the only person eating at a huge restaurant. And hence, the whole staff was serving a single table occupied by just two people. Also, the kitchen gave us special attention and served us the best quality and upscale food. 

Order Highlight: 

Assorted Tandoori Platter: A huge Platter, full of delicacies, roasted to perfection.

It was the second time that me and my roommate went there. The decor is nice and the staff were polite too. The restaurant is divided in 3 different zones: A bar and chill-out zone, A reserved party zone and a fine dining zone. The Party Zone was booked and the chill-out zone was almost full too. We had come in for a light dinner, thus went to the dining area. Wanted to try something different so we ordered Cream of broccoli soup which was super delicious and stopped ourselves from ordering one more so as to try something else too. We ordered Cannelloni Florentine which was really tasty and in good proportions too, so we could not order anything else. The food and service both were totally awesome.
The only issue was the noise coming from the Party Zone. As the party zone is next to the dining area, it should have been more sound proof cause people would obviously like to enjoy and¬† have fun during parties, which definitely produces noise, which in turn irritates people who are there to have a peaceful dinner.

Today, 6th July 16 at around 7:30 PM, my family and me decided to order some starters from Go Green. We decided on the order (Assorted Kebab Platter and Fried Wanton) and placed it around 7:53 PM. The person who had taken my order informed me that the order will take 45 mins to reach on which I agreed and confirmed my order. Till 8:58 PM when the order didn't reached me, I called up the resturant to enquire about the status of my order, i was told that the order has left and is about to reach me. Go Green is located very near to my place, within 2 kms. The order didn't reach me by 9:10 PM, when I called back again the person asked me my order and promised to call back. But, no calls or the order came till 9:21 PM. We had waited for approx. 90 mins for a simple order, which reached at my door step at 9:25 PM.

The food was still hot which makes it obvious that the order was prepared late and the team was just making excuses and bluffing that the order had left their store. This is kind of service these restaurants offer, they make false commitments to us (consumers) taking the full advantage and when you question them they say sorry and either offer us discounts or make the order complementary which we gladly accept.

They have taken us for a ride each time with their sorries and discounts. What I ask them (these kinda of restaurants) is why they offer or come out of schemes/commitments which they cant fulfil when they do not have the adequate capacity/infrastructure to support it.

Their sorry/discounts will not fill/make up the time loss and appetite loss (not atleast for me).

Had their been a system where these restaurants which make false commitments could be penalised. Had Zomato had an option for negative rating I would have given -10.0 to Go Green for their service.

I am highly disappointed and shall not visit or order from them in future.

Viewers, Readers and Followers are free to male their decision, I have posted just my experience.

A decent place to have vegetarian options in the heart of Kankurgachi. Hard to miss, this one serves decent offerings although ¬†I did not like it much during my visit. Had a mixed pasta here but the quality did not justify the pricing. The service is quite slow and due to the large influx of the customers it sometimes becomes hard to communicate with the waiters. They also host a lounge for private parties.

Located in kakurgachi area, easy to find, this place is a paradise for vegetarians.
The quantity and quality of the food is commendable.

Ambience: 2/5
The place is large and spacious, and yet it is not upto the mark. I have been to so many places with better ambience that this one seems like a Debbie Downer.

Food: 4/5
The dishes looked okay but tasted really amazing!!
Tomato Basil Soup: It was thick and creamy.üëå
Crispy Chilli Babycorn in Szechwan Sauce: One of the best in town.üëåüëå
Hara Bhara Kebab: The shape was perfect and the taste too.
Cannelloni Florentine: The cheese melted in the mouth and the taste of the spinach wasn't overpowering.üëå
Bruschetta: It wasn't worth what it cost. Not nice at all.
Paneer Tikka Masala: It was spicy but nice.
Jaipuri Malai Kofta: It was very sweet, I didn't like it that much.
Go green Kaali Dal: It was pretty average.
Pineapple Raita: Delicious.üëåüëå
Lachha Paratha: It was very good.
Stuffed onion Kulcha: It was good.

Price: 4/5
Food is worth the money paid.

Definitely worth visiting again.‚úî

Sorry about the¬†long review, but really an unpleasant experience with the management of the restaurant..!We¬†booked this place for a small family¬†party (in Nov-15); however, due to some personal exigency we had to cancel the booking. While cancelling they agreed, if the restaurant gets any booking for the same date, they will refund the money, otherwise they won't as per the policy (..which is fair, and¬†we agreed!!). In spite of having the party on the same day, they denied that they had any bookings. (I have pictures to prove this, as I stay in the next building and their banquet is visible)..After this, I tried to contact them for a few days, the owner did not even bother to take calls and manager kept on saying "I cant to do anything". After¬†regular follow-ups,¬†they agreed to adjust the amount for any future dining until 31-Mar-2016. However,¬†when we ordered today (4-Mar-2016),¬†manager said "as instructed by our owner, we will not adjust the amount and it is forfeited". When I spoke to the owner¬†regarding this, he was JUST SO ARROGANT and said "I never made any¬†personal commitment and I don't want to get into a conversation¬†for these little things, come to the restaurant and have food..!!" (as if he is doing a favour to us!)I don't care about the money but GUYS!! PLEASE REALIZE you are in¬†a service industry and ought to treat your customer well! I am never going back! Please make your decision accordingly before booking this place.. Customer treatment: [Negative]

Reviewing them in the basis of food served by them on Jan 18th, 2016

Had ordered for take away and with no onion no garlic specification. The main dishes were prepared perfectly and the Adrak mirch ki roti stole the show in the bread section.

Keep it up..:-)

Food okay, service okay, ambience okay - on the western side there are glasses overlooking the road, may be there were plants which are now dried and giving a dirty look. Glasses appear to have not been cleaned for years. The most surprising thing was that on a sunny bright Sunday noon the hall for 50/60 people was empty. We were the only two for an hour from 1.00 p.m. to 2.00 p.m. to my mind it is because of the prices. The prices are high by the standard of these type of restaurants.

Didn't enjoy any of the dish that I ordered 
Although the menu is very attractive but the taste is missing !! I mostly ordered all its signature dishes.
To begin with, I ordered Genovese Pesto Minestrone Soup- its description was very pleasing... But when it arrived, to my shock it was only a plain tomato soup with few grated veges..

Next I directly went for the main course. I ordered the regular North Indian dishes such as Dal Makhani, Paneer Nazaqat and Naans. All were just okayish!

For drinks, I ordered Ginger Lemon On The Rocks & Virgin Mary.... These two were so pathetic that it was way beyond gulping!!!! 

Service & ambience were good..

It's is a paradise for true veg lovers. Quality and quantity both were good. Food were served hot. Many restaurants don't have all the perfect item's, but here all the food were good. No complain for any item served here. Best place to hangout with family. We had ordered manchow and sweet corn in soup. American corn pepper salt and spring roll in starters. Aloo dum punjabi, go green special Dal in main course with tandoori and stuffed kulcha in bread. And lastly, fresh lime soda in beverages. 
Will visit again soon...*=*

Ambiance: Ok.
Service: Server's hand wasnt stable and was dropping things eveywhere on the table. Overall, they were decent.
Food: Menu is widespread. Had heard alot of good things about their food. But, it seems today was my bad day. Apart from soups (cream of broccoli and manchow) and fresh lime soda, nothing seemed that great. Onions used in starters were stale. Hara bhara kabab and veg seekh kabab of Tandoori platter (waiter's suggestion) needs alot of improvement. Dahi kabab, which is apparently their signature dish, had a tangy taste. Enchillada was a disaster and we had a tough time chewing it. Dal tadka and paneer nazaqat was good, Pindi chana was just about fine. Though they can work on its oil content. Overall, an ok experience. Hoping to have a better one in my next visit!
Cheers

Go Green is loacated in the kakurgachhi area.Its a pure veg restaurant...We went there today with our family and really enjoyed the food...
Theres a phrase dont judge anyone by the cover of the book and this applies totally for this restaurant...
The enterance of this restaurant is not exciting but the food definitely is...
We were disappointed when we entered the restaurant because we dint find it exciting...
But once we started ordering the food our views for the same changed starting from the soups to the virgin mojito in mocktails all were great...
In starters we ordered for hara bhara kawab and paneer tika which was again really yumilicious...
In main course we ordered for Daal Makhani,Paneer Butter Masala,Mix Vegetables, and all were really delicious...
Again in breads we ordered for masala kulcha,Garlic naan and Butter naan..All three of them were superb..But the garlic naan was the cherry on the cake...
We were disapointed when we heard that they dont have much options in desert and they just have icecreams because after such an amazing meal we expected a good desert so we ordered what they had but again the icecream were 
amazing we ordered for Butter Skotch and it was really tasty...
So overall we had a good experience.The USP of this place is its purevegeterian as the name suggest 
GO GREEN...A nice option for the pure vegies like us..

Suggestion-Please try to improve the enterance as people dese days are much more interested in going to places which have nice ambience...So if you all make some changes in the ambience of restaurant it will definitely be a hit...

One of those few vegetarian restaurants that I really liked. The food was very good! However, the experience was awfully disturbing. Good food was accompanied with slow service and a noisy atmosphere. While clearing the table, luckily I dodged the plates that were in his hand. They almost hit my face. However, he still managed to spill black dal on my shirt.

Cruising around Kankurgachi looking for a place to grab some dinner and we spotted Go Green. I wanted to try the place especially since the name makes it sound like a Jain oriented restaurant.

Salads were in plenty with many options like the common Cesar‚Äôs salad to Three Beans salads, Besan Cheese Chillas, Lebanese Falafel.

We ordered a Tomato Basil Soup as a starter after which we quickly rushed on to the main course.

Next came the main dishes, which included Paneer Nazaqat and Subz Masala. The Go Green Kaali Dal and Paneer Roghini were also amazing with the 2 types of Naan and Stuffed Kulcha!

Desserts the Sizzling Chocolate Brownie was excellent :D

Definitely a good option for vegetarians. Will come back for sure.

Located near Kankurgachi Petrol Pump, Go Green is one fine family restaurant for localites. 

Happened to visit the place with a GroupOn Voucher and a deal that was totally worth it. They have a vast variety even on this GroupOn deal, in Soups/ Mocktails, Starters, Main Course and Breads/Rice.Though, I would suggest to include more variety in the deserts section. 

We ordered Hara Bhara Kabab which was ordinary and we found their green chutney to be stale, but it was changed at once. 
Paneer Tikka was good. So was the, Tomato Soup and Strawberry Mocktail. 

For main course we ordered Malai Kofta, which was sweet, but a delicacy for those who do not prefer very spicy food. Paneer Butter Masala was above average. However, they can improvise on their stuffed masala kulcha.

Ambience is not anything extraordinary, and lights are dim. (Which might be a negative for photo freaks) 

Looking forward to more deals on GroupOn to visit again!

Hidden behind a schmuck of wires and hoardings, lie the board of Go Green. Walk up the flight of staircases and there you would enter a wonderland of  veg cuisine. Continental, Chinese, Indian, Italian, you name it, they have it. What takes the cake is the service. Leaves a sweet after taste. Comfortably affordable, Go Green does manage to surprise you with its range off delicatessens. Truly a weekend well spent. Go Green.

This is my first ever review on zomato - no other place made me feel overwhelmed to do so!

I am not sure if it is the service, or is it the food, ¬†that makes this place so great.

They have a wide range of choices is menu, plus some additional items for which the steward shall willingly assist.

Further, the staff is very humble and courteous, making it an awesome dining experience.

The ambiance is bright and well lit, with some very appropriately designed seating space.

The order was served in decent time, and the food was warm.

Plus, the place being a pure veg restaurant makes it my favorite.

In all, a must try :)

First of all the ambience is very ordinary and place is very small tables are placed very closely and there is no privacy between two tables.the ceilings are too low besides service is pathetic. They will switch on the a.c only after they are requested to do the favours. Only pros is the food which is good but that doesn't justify the prices which are par with any posh and fine dining restaurant besides the rediculus tax structure. You do not get any value for the money spent.

Although i would suggest you to go only if you want to try out new places and not if you are looking for good food worth the money. The food is average but the prices are too high for the quality of food. 
The environment of the place and the service is average.

This is most ordinary resturant serving only vegetarian food. The service is pathetic and food also below average. Prices are in lines with best restaurants in town but food is nowhere near that. Overall disappointing.

To start with location is very bad. Getting parking space is difficult and even then you have to ask around to spot the Resto entrance.

I think the food is a bit overpriced. Sizzlers are a strict no. They just have all the items put side by side. Though, soups are good and the Indian food is worth the price. The quantity served is again good and as such one must order conservatively.

Hospitality and Ambience is very good. Though, they need to improve on the varieties and have better hoardings in place with proper directions to the resto.

I keep visiting this place regularly..and am always completely satisfied..being a vegetarian, always had very few options..but this is the place to be for the veggies..
Special mention for khumbh galouti kebab,dahi kebab,jaipuri kofta,tikkas,pizzas..
Mocktails are amazingly refreshing..
Staff is very polite n well behaved.
Have Seen other ppls review saying it to be expensive ..but friends quality comes at a price...and with the quality n taste they serve price is nominal..
Today is their 1st anniversary and I wish them all t best for coming years..
GREAT GOING GO GREEN..

I visited this place a frw days ago , I came to know about yhis place through jsg dial.com 
This place is only for vegetarians . The ambience of thia place was too good , a completely hygienic place to have your meal 
We ordered veg hakka noodles and paneer manchurian with masala coke . The food was really js very good .the place is worth having a visit,  mild music js shows a gr8 essence of  simplicity of this place , and also attracts me over here . 
Will surely visit this place very soon .
Approx 1500 fr 2 persons.

The location is pretty weird but the staff were cordial and the food mostly good. The dahi kebab was sweet which it is not supposed to be. The dal was good and the paneer kadhai was pretty decent as well. I will recommend it as a good local option. Not really going to come from say salt lake to eat here though.

The restaurant has a great menu of vegetarian dishes with great taste. But they seriously need to do 2 things. 1) rework their price , it is over the top expensive . 2) carpet the walls and floor , the sound echo is too much to bear . The restaurant has a low ceiling so the sound emanating from people talking is just too much.

I really wanted to go to this place after seeing it on Zomato..I finaly visited it today on my birthday.
Starting with the location..this restaurant is easily locateable,situated at an easily accessible area..
Secondly, the food was really good,perfectly cooked,a really good menu which serves Italian to North Indian,Chinese..so a lot of variety to choose from..though a bit costly,the quantity served is pretty good..
 The service was quick,but the waiter was really in a hurry to clear the table even when we were still eating..this disappointed us..another problem faced was load shading, the staff didn't care to switch on the generator but finally did after 15 long minutes and numerous times of our requesting them to do so..
Overall a really gud restaurant to go to with family and friends..bonus being it being pure vegetarian..just some improvement needed for the staff behaviour.

The food was delicious, I had ordered over the phone for take away. The order was from the north Indian section for dinner. The paneer was delicious and the tawa subz was no less. Kulchas were perfect. Food was properly packed and was ready as per the time quoted to me over the phone.
Met the proprietor, Mr. Nahata, a very humble man.

It would have been a half point extra, but I found the dishes slightly overpriced!:)

Overall nice place!
USP: Pure Vegetarian

I visited this restaurant yday... the food was awesomely yummy... starters we ordered basil paneer tikka and canneloni florentine... both were very differently prepared and we all loved it. Drinks we ordered lemon ginger on the rocks-again a very different preparation. Main course we ordered yellow tadka dal, rekdi chole and jaipuri malai kofta... i loved their chole...Altogether all their food were sumptuous and service was also quick. The staff was very friendly and courteous. We had told them that it's my sister's bday so after we completed our dinner they served us a complimentary sizzling brownie with icecream which was a nice gesture from their part. To conclude, I would say a nice place to indulge in good food but yes according to the place it is surely over-priced. So, the only reason I would re-consider my visit to this place is the pricing.

One of the best restaurants in the city.
We had a small get-together of around 30 persons at Go Green on 13th March 2014, to celebrate the 40th Wedding Anniversary of my parents.
The entire experience was very very good.
The food was delicious and the service exceptional.
In particular I would like to mention I have never come across such an amiable & cooperative Restaurant Manage like Mr Sushovan Chakraborty.
When he is around be sure you will have the best experience.
This restaurant is a must-go
All the best

Went on Sunday.
Pros:-
1. Good food taste.
Cons:-
1. Food over-priced considering the area where this restaurant is located.
2. Pathetic service, had to ask for drinking water thrice.
3. They do not keep all air-conditioners on unless told, so its bit uncomforable.
4. Bad ambience with tables very closely placed and low ceiling height. No bare minimum privacy.
5. Gave soup spoon to eat main course and told they do not have enough dinner spoons.
Given their charges which is higher than any good restaurant in Park Street area, service was certainly bad. Major improvement required.

We visited GG on a busy Puja evening expecting there would be a less people gorging on Veg..Think again !
Location - Easy to spot - Nice tyre decor on the way up to the 1st floor
Ambience - We were greeted by two gentlemen who showed us to a table for two. I requested for a change of table which was made as soon as I gave my reasons. Full Marks! The place inside is fresh.  The table layout is good. The motif with dim bulbs, cups and wooden spoons on the walls were interesting. 
Food - We started with a caesars salad...which was crunchy and had the right amount of Tofu. Staff was trained in providing Tabasco sauce & accompaniments as soon as I inquired. Paneer kawabs were great, but I'd have liked a little more hard on the edges. Our closer - spaghetti in sauce took 20 mins to arrive but I'd attribute that to the crowd.
Overall - A very nice place for vegans and daresay a good place to impress non - veggies too. Price is right - for now! One place we'd like to make a return visit soon.
