This place is actually a home bakery. Muffins and cup cakes are delicious. Had called them for next day delivery and got a positive response. They can deliver the stuff to your place (Chargeable) or you need to pick it up.

P.S - All the items mentioned in zomato menu may not be available.

Have been here for the first time and I'm sure this would not be the last. I had ordered cup cakes with customised designs and believe me it was just awesome. The cupcakes had a look which would leave a lasting impression on your minds, cuteness overloaded. Went with owners suggestion for the flavour was capuchino and I really loved it. The delicious taste, along with lovely looks and the owners hospitality combined, it was a great experience and I would definitely suggest this place to everyone.

Just went by the owner's suggestion and opted for Vanilla Choco chip. Chocolate being too mainstream these days the flavor caught my attention and thank god that it did. The flavor was really good and one should definitely give it a try. The owner too was very cooperative and came up with the best. 
Thank you

The baker  is creative & talented!
I loved the way a customised cake was baked to perfection for me. I ordered a day in advance & got exactly what I was looking for, perhaps a tad bit better!
Ordering,payment,picking up was smooth with a lot of co-ordination from Team Yummy Puds.
I ordered a 3.5 pound custom cake in dark chocolate flavour with choco chips. It cost me 4.8k INR.
I learnt that there are a lot of flavours to choose from. So, three guesses where I'm headed to for my next cake pick up? üòâ
Happy baking!

 Update - 9th March 2017- it was my dad's birthday. Last time after having the red velvet cake he told me that he wants to have the same cake again. From then i thought of giving him this cake on his birthday as he has sweet teeth. the cake was awesome just as i expected. It was so moist that it melts in mouth.  Looking forward to meet you again. Will definitely order again.

So I ordered cupcakes from Yummy Puds two days back for my bro who was visiting Kolkata.. The owner is polite and understands the need of the customers very well. I ordered chocolate cupcakes with blueberry frosting n they were 'out of the world'!! (is the feedback I got from my bro n family).
The only thing I didn't like was the heavy charge for delivery. The owner operates from home so delivery is outsourced to some third party vendor who charged exorbitantly high.
But I would highly recommended it for soft yummy cupcakes!

Recently I visited this bakery and I found it very interesting. She is a home Baker. It not only bakes but also Masters in various other types of cocktail snacks.  I recently tried Kesar Posta flavored cake which was very unique and delicious. 

I can never think of this flavor. No bakery in Kolkata has ever come out with this unique flavor. Yummy puts justifies it's name. It's a pure vegetarian bakery. Must visit for all.

Blueberry muffin has always been a hit from this bakery!! U can blindly trust Parwati s choice as her suggestions are just too good:)

To correctly put in words , it was paradise. If one doesn't have too many constraints on money , then I would surely recommend you to order the triple chocolate cake.

It was it !!!

It was my husbands birthday and i wanted a cake that looks not just unique but tastes even better than the best. After a lot of research here on zomato i came across yummy puds. The owner is a home baker and i must say i took a risk as she has no display at her place but had to trust her and my instinct. It all paid off well as the cake looked beautiful and people pounced on it the moment they got a bite of it. I was asked to go for vanilla chocochip flavour and it was just WOW!! I couldn't fault it at all and i dont think i had such a fantabulous cake before.¬†

I ordered a 2 pound purple rosette cake which looked beautiful, just what i wanted. Considering the cake and the taste i thought the price was reasonable. Two Pound cost me Rs.1500. The delivery was bang on time. I hope yummy puds goes a long way and retains its quality and maybe have its own delivery system.

I am definitely ordering again whenever there is an occasion.¬†

Order and get blown away!!

Sudden family birthday plans and requirement of a good quality cake was fulfilled perfectly by Yummy Puds. These guys are just awesome. From the behavior, to the service everything is really great. The cake was bang on time too as per our requirement. What impressed us the most was the quality, and exact same cake as they sent us on the phone.
‚Ä¢
We ordered a 2 Pound Vanilla Chocochip Cake. It had pink Ombre Effect Roses with names on fondant flags on top of it. As soon as we got it and opened it, our eyes sparkled with joy. It was perfect and everyone loved it. The cake was as delicious as its appearance. The Ombre effect roses were soft and creamy on the outside and on the inside it was spongy and piquant. Loved it. Thank you yummy Puds for making our day special.

Yes we loved the cake and icing was too delicious... However what we felt, in a blackforest there are more choco coverage outside with choco flakes... Though choco chip was there but still flakes were not there .
And price what I found compared to Spencer's is quite high (1Kg 750 bucks).. as¬† for us 1.5Pound costed 1000 bucks...
Else the cake was pretty good overall

The USP of this place ia that it sells eggless cakes. Being a pure vegetarian, ita hard to find pure vegeterian bakery. I ordered a Naughty cake foe my friends anniversary, it was just too good. The cake was yummy and my friends loved it.

The Poker cake was ordered by my wife on my birthday.

The Swimming pool cake was for my daughter's birthday party.

Overall there are many other options like homemade chocolates, snacks n moree

Ordered two cakes from this outlet, trust me both were amazingly tasty. Should try their vanilla chocochip cake. Plus the personal touch of the owners is appreciable.

If someone in future ask me from where to buy cakes, mousse, cup cakes or any other confectionery items...then honestly I will suggest "YUMMY PUDS"

The reason for referring Yummy puds is the taste, the way they provide services and the most important thing is that they believe in customer satisfaction

The USP of Yummy Puds is the pure eggless part. Fantastic concept being introduced by the owner for various types of desserts. Awesome taste and unique design. 

All being baked by the owner (Parwati Ladha) herself.
