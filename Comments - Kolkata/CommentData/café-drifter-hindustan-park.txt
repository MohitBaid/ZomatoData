This place was on my checklist for long and it finally got ticked off. The cafe is small ,not too many people are inside that and it has got a very nice ambiance. The waiters were very well behaved and courteous.  Now coming to food. The presentation was  pretty good.  We ordered chikhen sausage and roasted chicken lasagne, ckicken and egg double decker sandwich ,chicken mushroom and caramalised onions with cheese and also french fries. Next we ordered ultimate kitkat shake and fererro rocher shake. We are totally satisfied with the quality and taste of food. Will see forward to visit this place again.

This restaurant is near Hindustan park.A lovely cozy place with outdoor as well as indoor service.The decor has attracted me because it was kinda nerdish but fun with books and guitars , scraped walls etc. Coming to the food, quality and quantity both are really good.We tried the oven sow cooked chicken, pork chops, pan seared fish, the berry blast cheesecake and kiwi blast mocktail.Every dish was lip smacking good, but only flaw i found that was to me the pork chops were a bit overcooked.But otherwise, excellently courteous staff.Would love to go back there.

This is a relatively spacious cafe with nice decor that serves great food at very reasonable prices. Speaking of the ambience, the furniture and flooring is made out of wood, while the walls have books and pictures kept upon it which creates an aesthetic and calm vibe that make you just sit and relax within it. The staff are competent too, they respond and serve immediately, they keep a friendly attitude while maintaining their professionalism.
Coming to food, whatever we had was outright delicious, especially the main courses, everything was in good quantity and the pricing was very reasonable in my fair opinion. The shakes or beverages were good too, they had run out of cakes when I visited so I'm eager to try them out later.
What we had :-
1. Slow Oven Cooked Spring Chicken - must try
2. Ham wrapped Chicken with Cheese and Spinach
3. Barbeque Chicken Wings
4. Green Tea
5. Fresh Lime Soda
6. Hot Chocolate
7. Death by Chocolate - must try
8. Extreme Kitkat Shake - must try

Overall, it's a beautiful place to visit, you can simply go alone, sit, relax and enjoy your food so definitely it's a must go recommendation.

This cafe is located in Hindustan park and is quite easy to find with google map. It has amazing decorations and friendly staff. Outdoor seating is available too. The food here is great too. We had juicy chicken burger and this was one of the best burgers I've ever tasted. Then for desert we ordered Molten choco lava cake with vanilla ice-cream which was good too. The staff was friendly like I said but they took a long time to bring the food.

Anyways, it's a nice place to go with your friends and family. I will definitely visit this cafe again.

Amazing place
Very nice interior. Good service. Food quality and presentation is really amazing. I just visited the place yesterday for the first time. Ordered blue lagoon, virgin mojito,golden fried prawns and grilled chicken. All of them were good. But the golden fried prawns should have been a bit more crispier. Overall it's a nice place to go and settle down with your friends for few hours and have a great time. I am satisfied and looking forward to be there and try more dishes and give you guys all the updates ! Eat and enjoy :)

This place is located very close to gariahat . If u have any problem u can follow the google map. There are two places to sit one on outside where u can enjoy the natural beauty and weather and inside it has wooden chairs and sofas to sit comfortably. There is no mention of pizzas at the menu but it will be available on the cafe. We ordered initially chicken and corn pizza which was  cheesy but average to taste at and the crispy chicken which we ordered was nice to taste at the beginning but the chicken was not well cooked from inside , the flavours and masalas which they apply didnt get inside the food well . We ordered cokes and at last ordered choco lava cake which was the only item that tastes good. The cake was soft and full of chocolate inside and the vanilla icecream which was the climax. The hospitality was not so well we had to call them many times and they could hardly visit to us. Firstly they didnt offered plates and folks which we had to order after calling them. Nextly while entering at the restaurant there were no one at the reception. U can try choco lava cake else rest upto u

Cafe Drifter is located on the ground floor, opposite of Hindustan (Vivekananda) Park. The decor is appropriate for a Cafe, nice seating arrangement with both smoking and non- smoking options. The menu is very nice, staffs are friendly and attentive. The quantity and quality of food served are both great. Parking facility available. We tried the Double Decker Chicken Sandwich and Chicken Burger with Cappuccino and Masala Coke. Just one word for all: Excellent.

Drifters cafe had been recommended to me by a couple of friends for its ambience n food. I am a non resident and visiting the city on a holiday. The place is quaint and we sat down with a good feeling of getting some good food. After making our choices..... each item came after a min wait time of 15 mins..... nothing was being brought to the table together..... if tea was served.... there were no spoons..

A budget friendly cafe for satisfying meals. We went there during Pujas and after a lot of walking my friend and I were extremely tired and hungry. Ordered the following: 
Double decker sandwich
Chicken stuffed Lasagne 
Blue Lagoon 

The lasagne deserves a special mention for being so generously loaded with cheese and chicken, baked to perfection. It was extremely filling for two people. Will definitely visit again.

Went in with lots of apprehensions. But after sitting for nearly 30 minutes, was informed that our order which consisted of Pasta, would not be available. They were keen to offer us only Burgers.
Following this I decided to try on the "Classic Chicken Caesar Salad" which is suggested everywhere to be tried here. Yet when the food arrived it had 3 items : Cabbage, Cabbage & Cabbage. I kept wondering why the name is 'Classic Chicken' & not 'Classic Cabbage only Salad'.

The 2 rating is for the decor which was quite good. But the food & service was very distasteful to say the least.

Came to know about this cafe while zomatoing. The menu seems to be attractive one to bookmarked it, and atlast we were there on a lovely Saturday winter evening.

Location:
____________
This is located in the Hindustan park. 5 min walking distance from the famous Hindustan Park sarbojonin Puja mandop. Yes, if you have any doubt or confusion, blindly follow the Google map. You will be there.

Ambiance:
____________
The ambiance is quite nice. The wooden table chair interior us quite nice. The small little book self, book on the reck, wall quote frames are just perfectly decorated.
And on the lovely evening their outside sitting is the special thing to be mentioned for sure.

Food:
________
This will be a quite a small review as we were just there for a chat. So, please note the review will be totally based on the items we had.

© Beverages:
________________

✓ Hezelnut Capacchino - initially it was pretty milder. Then we asked them to add some more syrup. After that it was nice. 
✓ Lime and Litchi Mocktail - it was damn good. Just perfect as the refreshner.

© Food:
___________

✓ Crispy Bacon, sausage & Lettuce salad - it was okay type.nice, but could have been much much better.

✓ Cheese garlic toast - fantastic one.

© Dessert:
_____________

✓ Blue Berry Cheesecake : excellent one.


The experience we had was pretty nice. Yes, we could able to taste only few items that day. So, wish to visit there again.

The staffs are quite generous.


And last but not the least all cost 695 INR.

It seems to be that it's a nice and well potential cafe. So planning to drop there again in near future for sure.

And till my next food review, happy fooding. :)

Well well this place made our Christmas dinner spot for this year. 

Location- Quite easy to spot on the Southern Avenue lane.

Decor- This cafe had a pretty decent seating arragements inside and also a small outdoor seating zone which basically provides a smoking zone. Classic cafe style decor nothing too fancy which gives a casual feel.

Food- 1. Juicy Chicken Burger with Mustard Mayo - Outstanding! Soft and succulent chicken patty with similarly soft bun that almost melts in mouth. It comes with French fries. I highly recommend this. I have had burgers at many places but this is one of the best i had so far!

            2. Chicken and egg double decker sandwich- Much heavy and is accompanied by French fries. They will give choice of brown or white bread so one can select their preference. Overall good sandwich.

            3. Tomato and basil sauce chicken pasta - Again the quantity was moderate but had plenty chicken pieces and that sauce was just perfect not too tangy not too over-powering. Tasted good.Oh ya it comes with a piece of garlic bread.

Ambience- Very buzzy place in a quiet way. As we selected outdoor seating so it was a bit annoying to call the staffs for order and all again and again because there were no such arragements made and eventually the calling bells were off too. The staffs were taking much time to attend and deliver the ordered stuffs and also no music outside which was also a gloominess on Christmas. Otherwise the behaviour was good.

 The menu prices are inclusive of taxes so the pocket does not pinch much. Would love to visit again.

Sumptuous, no tax, easy to locate , quirky interior , courteous staff , ... well things I look for .
Chicken burger :- juicy , fresh , decent size of chicken patty, n perfect crunchy outside soft inside fries. 
KitKat shake:- price is a lil on the higher side but really good. The shake dosent taste bland like some other "famous" cafés. Brownie , ferrero rocher, KitKat pieces, peanut butter  makes it more appealing.
Chocolava cake with icecream :- wao!!!!! Hot oozing chocolate ... Perfect ! Just try this one when u visit .
Would have given a higher rating but was a lil disappointed. We had asked to add bacon to the burger but the waiter forgot to mention it to the cook I suppose , when we enquired they accepted n asked if they should add... We had started eating already n it tasted good without the bacon too so didn't bother. 
Will surely visit again to try out the other items.

Not too hard to locate, the cafe stands out in its quirky-themed decor. Comfortable and casual, it's an appropriate place for conversations and hangouts. 
The food quality, quantity and pricing are at par and fair. The staffs are courteous. One major drawback, according to me, is the lack of a "proper" restroom. 
We ordered a cheese-corn sandwich, the cafe special burger, mint iced tea and a regular cappuccino. The food and beverages were impressive.

Went there for lunch, but was informed that they can't serve any food items except sandwiches. It was at least 2 hours past their opening time, and yet they were not prepared for all the menu items! Odd.
Ordered hazelnut cappuccino. It was okay, but I've had better. And had the BLT sub. I was informed that it would take around 30 minutes and then they again changed their mind and told me that it would be done in some 15 minutes. The cafe was not crowded, but apparently that's their usual serving time (the menu says so). The sub looked great, but was not that tasty.
The place itself is really good and they have some amazing outside seating arrangements.

This was the first time I went to cafe drifter. The food, ambience, décor, interiors and staff were all excellent 

I went with my younger sister and ordered for one double decker egg and chicken sandwich , one juicy chicken burger with mustard mayo and chocolate brownie with ice cream for dessert . The food was yummy and extremely filling. The bill inclusive of taxes was phenomenally cheap and unexpected. For the kind and quality of food they served us the prices were unbelievable

This place is wonderful to visit

You can also try out Continental dishes which are cooked to perfection. The decor is  turquoise-y and so pleasing to the eyes. Also, they play really cool music. I have been to this place twice and was never disappointed.

I wanted to try out this cafe for a long time and now since my holidays have begun I finally could manage time to visit this place. This is one of the best cafes I have been to. They serve good quality lip smacking food at a reasonable price which is worth every penny. 
For drinks I had Coke. For that main course I had their famous JUICY CHICKEN BURGER WITH MUSTARD MAYO. It is undoubtedly the best burger I ever had! The patty is crunchy on the outside and cheesy and creamy on the inside and will just make you close your eyes once you take a bite. They also serve it with fries and sauce. This dish is highly recommended. 
Then we had their CHICKEN LASAGNA. This also the best lasagna I ever had. Normally​ lasagna is done with red sauce but this was done with white and is filled with stringy cheese and chicken. Also highly recommended​.
For desserts we had the HOT CHOCOLAVA CAKE WITH ICECREAM. The cake had a soft and gooey centre just like it should. Hot lava cake with ice-cream can never go wrong. 
My experience was just amazing and I'm very pleased and IL definitely visit again. The food is just too good to be true.

It's just one of those places you hangout with your friends. Every wall is wonderfully themed and designed for clicking pictures. Their taste of music isn't much good. The food was at best average. Of course, the lamb burger was good.
The cream of chicken soup with thyme was more thyme soup with milk and chicken in it. The cheesecake was more of a mousse.
I'd recommend:

One of the new cafe in town which is quite the best compared many other.
The name itself was interesting and attracted my attention.this cafe is located inside the Hindustan park lane, just below Indian Handloom cottage. The is the best place to hangout with friends or office colleague.They have very cozy and homely decor, one wall decorated with pictures  and the other ones reminds you of our childhood. Even comics are available to read. The food was also great, I have been their twice with friends and alone, their double meat club sandwich and their Kitkat shake was the best it was sumptuous and really yummy a must try for all. Their  chicken pasta and their shrimp preparation was yet to be their best , juicy and delicious. The service was good but takes a lot of time to bring your food after you have ordered. But overall its a really good place and soon planning for my next visit.

This cafe was much talked about when I finally decided to visit with my friends. We went there on shoshthi and we were thoroughly disappointed! The only positive thing about it was the cozy ambience and the decor. Coming to the food, we ordered,

1. Aam Panna mocktail- Yes it was good and refreshing.

2. Spaghetti Aglio E Olio ( non-veg)- Loved this one too. The dried chillies was perfect with the pasta.

3. Slow Oven-Cooked Spring Chicken- I cannot help but state that I've never regretted ordering food like I did after tasting this particular dish. They served chicken in a white mushroom sauce with absolutely no seasoning and it was just like having boiled chicken with mashed potato which also did not have any seasoning or that smooth texture. It spoiled our moods completely!

4. Molten Choco Lava Cake With Vanilla Ice-cream- We were almost ready to cancel the order of the dessert after the disappointing main course but I'm so glad we didn't. This dessert was an absolute cracker and we needed it more than anything back then 😂, we even forgot to take a picture of it and gulped it straight down 😂

Finally the worst part, their service was delayed like anything. We had to wait for almost 40 minutes after ordering. We also had to ask them to clean up and serve the next course repeatedly every time. Moreover, we were three people but they gave us a table for two and one of us had to adjust on a stool. Thoroughly disappointed with the hospitality. There are better cafes in Kolkata offering good food in the same price range. I certainly won't recommend this one.

This restaurant should be an inspiration when it comes to utilising old walls and furniture. The ambience is a brilliant hybrid of old and modern. The books about photography and travel attracted me too. The food is the best you can get in this price range in South Kolkata, undoubtedly. Would definitely recommend for good food at a low budget.

A nice and cozy cafe near vivekananda park, serving high quality food. It has indoor seating as well as a few outdoor tables. Food is good beyond heaven! I visited that place with my friend. We tried-
Chicken Lasagne- it was full of chicken and very cheesy. Chicken was also very tender and it was served with a piece of bread which was a standout on its own. It was almost enough for two. Price- 320 (inc GST).
The extreme kitkat shake- shake was served in a huge glass( almost like a tumbler), topped with a brownie with chocolate sauce, some sprinklers and a Ferraro Rocher chocolate on top of it. The shake itself was very chocolaty and the edge of the glass was decorated with kitkat pieces and caramel. If you have a sweet tooth and are an devout of Chocolate then you're definitely gonna love it. Price- 270(inc GST).

Ambiance- both the decor and the seating are very cozy. Their playlist is also another thing to mention. They play nice music but I think they could bring more variety to it. The staff was very warm, friendly and up-to the mark. Service takes like 15 minutes depending on the dish you order. I would say their service was prompt.

Overall it's a great place to hangout for college students as well as soulful wanderers looking for some amazing food and bliss. Pocket pinch is also reasonable, they don't serve anything overpriced. I would definitely recommend this place to people and would love to visit this place again. 👌

This place with its ambience felt like a perfect place to visit with a small group of friends. It has arrangement for outdoor sitting as well. 

This is a very good place to visit if one is looking to have burgers at reasonable prices.

We had ordered an extreme kitkat shake. It was rather heavy, topped with brownie and a small chocolate ball with nutty interior and the glass was decorated with broken bits of kitkat with peanut butter. It was more of a visual treat, however. It tasted somewhat ordinary.

We had then ordered juicy chicken burger with mustard mayo. Served with fries and ketchup, it tasted really good. The patty didn't quite stay together and it was a bit of an issue to divide the portion.

We also ordered slow oven cooked spring chicken with wine sauce, mashed potatoes and tossed veggies. It tasted quite good. The chicken was soft and the sauce gave it a unique taste.

The staff is really courteous. The service was  prompt. Would love to visit again.

Want to have some tasty burgers? Then do visit Cafe Drifter. 

Reasonable price, good taste and nice presentation. Cafe Drifter will keep your taste buds, Instagram as well as your pocket in check. 

We had -

--> Juicy Chicken Burger with Mustard Mayo and Bacon Topping
--> Lamb Patty Topped with Garlic Mayo and Cheese

Both the burgers were served with french fries and ketchup and were quite tasty.

We also ordered -

--> Chicken, Mushroom and Caramelised Onions with Cheese Pie and though the filling was really really nice, the outer crust was not that good. It was bland, and kind of tasteless.

Overall the experience was good. The service was okayish, for they take 20 something minutes to prepare the food and serve it.

This is my favourite place. Whenever i crave for continental this is the place. I already visited this place thrice. 
Location: near hindustan park. Just 2mins walk. 
Ambience and decor: i loved their decor with different musical instruments. Abstract paints in the walls. Books. 
Stuffs: very friendly 
Food: foods are bang on. On first visit i had chicken steak which was on their special menu. Blue berry cheese cake, virgin mojito & strawberry blast. I flet the steak could be more tender. Otherwise all the food and drinks were yummy.
On 2nd visit we ordered jumbo prawn which was again from the special menu. Slow oven cooked chicken, chicken and egg double decker sandwich (only chicken was served for unavailability), Cola float, kiwi twisted, virgin mojito and guava jhatka. The prawn was the show stopper. The prawn meat was cooked with cheese and served in the prawn shell and was served with mashed potato and veggies. The slow oven cooked chicken was good but after the prawn it didn't taste much. Drinks was as usual good but guava jhatka is bit spicey so before ordering this think twice. 
3rd day: ordered ham wrapped chicken stuffed with cheese and spinach, bbq chicken pizza, kiwi twisted and oreo shake. The ham wrapped chicken is a must have. Its like heaven on earth. Pizza had thin crust and was really tasty. Oreo shake was also good. 
Conclusion: from my several visits its evident this place is a 'must visit' one. And they won't leave your pockets empty.

This cafe just won our hearts! Situated near hindustan park, the lane with all the new budding cafes and restaurants, this is one of the most cool cafe I've visited in recent times, where the music is good, you can sit and have a chat peacefully, and the food is great! Service was good, and the staff was quite helpful. So we ordered the Juicy Chicken Burger with Mustard Mayo and added bacon, this was love! Must try! In the mocktails, we asked the server for the best one and he just said i'll take care of it dont worry and indeed he did, i didnt ask the name but it was really refreshing. Then we ordered from the day's special menu Grilled chicken breast with mushroom sauce, and again this was a perfect dish! Must try, and at last we had the humongous kitkat shake! Ahh! I still can feel the taste while writing! It was great! A must visit place, will surely revisit for tasting other options from the menu.

This cafe, located in Hindustan Part area is one of the best cafes around the place. You will find this right after turning towards Purna Das Road from Golpark. From there it's a 5-10 minutes walk.

The inside is large enough to fit a few large group of people, and the ambience of the place is great. I really loved the painting designs on their wall. But you'll not come here just to admire the view, you'll come for the food. And the food is great.

With only 2 visits, this has definitely become one of my favorite cafes in that area.

For small bites, I really enjoyed their Barbecued Chicken Wings. The crust was perfect, not too crusty, not too soft. And it tasted delicious.

For main course I tried the slow Oven Cooked Spring Chicken and I cannot recommend it enough. Along with the Red Wine sauce and Mashed Potatoes and Pan-tossed Veggies to accompany it, it was a really good meal. Probably my favorite dish from this place even. So this is definitely a must try from this place in my opinion.

If you want to quench your thirst, you can go with the basics like Fresh Lime soda or choose from their variety of shakes.

I found the pricing to be reasonable enough, especially for the quality of food you get.

The staffs are good and made sure we had an enjoyable time so no complaints on that front as well.

So like I said before, I cannot recommend this place enough. If you are in this area and looking for somewhere to eat, this place should be among the top few choices.

I just love every thing about this cosy little cafe.
It's just a minute away from my place which makes me a regular at this cafe. This cafe exudes warm, positive vibes the moment one enters it. It's a nicely designed and well furnished place which sets the mood right. My favourite spots are the outdoor seating area and the high stools near the long window pane. Coming to the food and service, the last time I visited, I had ordered brownie shake, lamb patty burger, black forest cake. Brownie shake could have been better but the lamb patty burger covered up for it. Full marks for it. Soft, succulent lamb patty, lots of cheese and served with fries Service is pretty good too. ❤❤

Found a very good joint near my place. The decor was really nice and cozy ,best for students. The food was also pretty good. One must give a try. I found the creamy cheese pasta really delicious ,as it gives you a complete creamy texture if you are a cheese lover. The Kiwi Twisted was the best part, I never had such a refreshing one before it is a 10/10. 
Though I didn't liked the Death by Chocolate, it was very sweet with no taste variations i found it like a vary normal cold chocolate shake with extra chocolate sauce. So it needs to be get improved. 
Anyways,  i would live to go again and taste the other items for sure.

This has been a pleasant surprise. Warm ambience, cute little cafe with impressive food. And most of all great value for money...we had cream of chicken soup and chicken Caesar salad to start with. Soup was creamy, a bit salty but smooth and silky. Caesar salad did not have the desired punch of parmesan and the dressing definitely lacked egg yolks...the effect was plain.
For mains we had slow oven roasted chicken and pan seared fish. Must say both matched our expectations. Special mention for the veggies...they were nicely braised and consisted of almost every vegetable we consider as exotic these days. Bell pepper, zucchini, broccoli, baby corn, mushroom, cherry tomatoes and not just carrots and beans...ample mashed potatoes, nicely done soft juicy chicken....flaky fish with crispy top...well done and comparable to any such dish served by premium restaurants at a much higher price....

This small cafe has been trending for quite some time. It is located at 7, Jatin Bagchi Road, Hindustan Park, Kolkata.

Interior and exterior both have been made quite nicely. The service was however quite slow and not up to the mark. Food quality is slightly awesome. Price is very much pocket friendly. The music is perfect to set the mood. 

I went with my friend in the busy evening. And we went there for only for Kitkat and chocopie shake. Heard its best in hindustan park.

So, we ordered - Extreme Kitkat & Chocopie shake and Ferrero Rocher Shake. Their shake was towards the sweeter side and tasted amazing and looks awesome.

Then among foods we had, Juicy Chicken Burger, Barbeque chicken wings and french fries. Barbeque chicken wings tasted very bad. Not at all great. It had a soft and delicate texture. Honestly speaking, their french fries aren't that good.

But, Juicy Chicken burger tasted amazing. The burger was crispy and tasted good. It was served with fries and tomato ketchup. 

Overall, Their service was however quite slow and the foods quality is slightly good but not too good except kitkat shake.

This place is a mood lifter. Not only it offers some of the finest meals but the ambience as a whole is what can be called soothing and with it's shelves often lined up with old guitars and vintage typewriters adds a dose of nostalgia. So this place is definitely a perfect hub for both catching up with friends over a cup of coffee or for having a meal at a reasonable price.

One of the cutest cafes in town.

This place is situated in the same lane as Zucca Lounge. The decor and the ambience is worth mentioning. Especially the sitting arrangements.
Coming to the food, we ordered chicken lasagna, masala coke and French fries. Lasagna was pretty good, less spicy, well stuffed with loads of cheese and chicken 😍 The quantity is good enough for 2 people. But the sad part is the serve the lasagne with one piece of bread(which tasted so yummmm!!)
The mocktail and the fries were usual.
Though they take too much time to serve, but who would want to leave such a cute place early ! 
And their playlist is 😍😍 

Do visit this cafe 😀💃

"Café Drifter" is all about cherishing good food with your favourite people along with some good music to add to the simple yet effective decor of this place.

"Music" accelerates the purpose of the cafe.
Be it the background music or the "Fender" acoustic guitar waiting for it's player.

Filament bulbs and brick wall is just the perfect combo to create the ambience.

Hospitality?
The staff's are courteous & the service is prompt.

P.S the prices are reasonable and inclusive of taxes <3

Food?

• Piggy Pizza 🍕
• Barbequed Chicken Pizza 🍕
• Barbequed Chicken Wings 🐔
• Ham Wrapped Chicken with Cheese & Spinach
• Burger with Lamb patty with added cheese,mustard and mayo
• Brownie with vanilla ice cream

Overview?
The pizza's are delicate yet full of flavours with perfect amount of cheese blending with the base and adding to the flavours of chicken and pork.

The Burger tastes vibrant and is served with french fries.The mustard sauce blending with cheese and lamb surely rejuvenates your burger belly.

Ham wrapped chicken with surprise of cheese and spinach,is an experiment which deserves all appreciation as it tastes out of the box and interesting.If you want to give that shift of taste to your tastebuds,do give it a try.

Desserts?
Simple yet effective but nothing phenomenal,but at the price which you get the same is what steals the show.

Do give this Cafe in HINDUSTHAN PARK a try, you'll love it.

To music & food,with love-Arnab Ganguly.

This place had been lying on my wishlist for along time until I decided to hop in with my friends,for lunch. 
Since we were visiting in a big group so we had ordered a lot of items among which I would definitely suggest the pork chop,ham wrapped chicken,chicken burger with mustard sauce(add in the bacon to enhance the taste) and their pizzas (this is a new addition).
The desserts should definitely not be missed because after a great meal, desserts are a must. 

Their service and ambience with the quirky decor deserves a mention. 

P.S: They had also given us a complimentary item :p

This quirky looking cafe is definitely a trending one in Kolkata. Quite a spacious place with outdoor seating and lively decoration.
Ordered one BBQ pizza, caramelized onion, chicken sandwich, spicy arrabiata chicken pasta.
And in mocktails we had bang bang blueberry, hawa hawaaiin (really refreshing one) and death by chocolate shake.
Food quality was really good And all  the prices are inclusive tax. Also there were some special menu for the day. So one can opt for that without going for la carte.

The chicken burger with added cheese was good.... Baked crab wasn't upto the Mark and the slow cooked chicken in red wine wasn't that good too.... It's signature dessert the KitKat shake was horrible... The shake was like a little bit of Hershey's syrup added in a large volume of water, it was really dilute.... And on top there was some sort of chocolate thing... Which the staffs claimed 'brownie' but it was neither a brownie nor a chocolate bar .... And it tasted horrible

This place is one of the newest and coolest cafes in South Kolkata. They not only serve tasty food but also have an excellent décor. It's peppy and charming. The décor will definitely attract your attention to each and every nook and corner of this café.

I've been there with my friends. We ordered Fizzy Ice Tea (peach flavour), Hot Brownie with Chocolate Sauce and Vanilla Icecream, Meat Lovers Double Decker Sandwich and a BBQ Chicken Pizza. All the items were good in taste. The sandwich called Meat Lovers Double Decker was just yummy and so filling. The best part is the prices are absolutely pocket friendly.

Will love to visit this café again. Cheers to food. Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: 700 for two (approx.)

This is a beautiful quaint cafe near my house where I am a regular visitor. Their coffee is one of the best in town and their honey-lemon tea is made to perfection. I loved their pasta too..specially the spaghetti aglio olio. The ambience is perfect for visiting with friends as well as for visiting alone to read a book or work on your laptop undisturbed. There's always good music playing at the background which is an additional plus point.

Then came chicken corn 🌽 pizza 🍕 it was also v tasty thin crust very nice . Followed by it came fish finger it was horrible. Fresh lime soda was like it tasted like any normal sprite . Lastly vanilla ice cream and brownie even that was yum. It wasn't that pocket pinching .standard rates . I would like to visit again

Well the high rating of the cafe prompted me to check it out at the first opportunity that I got. At the first look, the decor really impressed me. It looks exactly a cafe should look like, bright and welcoming. The rating is just a reflection of that. But if I have to solely rate the place on food, I was not much impressed. I had gone for a friends' birthday treat and we had ordered a blue lagoon, virgin mojito, cola float, Oreo shake, golden fried prawns, chicken nuggets and slow oven-cooked spring chicken. The chicken nuggets had less of chicken and more of bread. I love my prawns but the taste fell really flat. The spring chicken also did not rose up to the expectations. And may be because of the Sunday rush, the service was really slow. Overall the place did not really leave a lasting impression.

This place was in my bucket list for a longer time. Finally got a chance to visit this place with my friends.
Location wise it is located near traingular park, and just inbetween several cafes like the Zucca, the feast street, the wise owl etc. It is very much easy to locate.
This a small cafe with both outdoor and indoor seating arrangements and cute decrations within it.
Now coming to the food and beverages!!
In beverages we ordered a iced tea in lemon flavour, the blue lagoon and the hawa hawaeein.
Both the three drinks were very much disappointing and was bad in taste. We were cursing us for the orders and the wastage of our money.
Now coming to the food items
1.Slow oven cooked spring chicken with red wine sauce. Mashed potatoes and pan tossed exotic veggies with butter herb rice
This dish was good in taste, though personally i didnot like the taste of herb rice. One may try mexican rice which was an alternate option to herb rice. The dish was good other than the rice.
2. The chicken sausage pizza - I never actually prefer pizzas in cafes due to the thin crust most cafes provide. On being indulged here by my friends i ordered the pizza. And i must say they prepare best pizza in town. With thick crust and lots of cheese. Too good!! Highly recommended.
3. The barbeque chicken wings - was great in taste with the moderate mixture of spices in it.
Overall the food quality was ok. And the quantity they served were good! The price ranges were pocket friendly. For our orders the bill came as Rs 1175 all inclusive!!
One thing i must add the staffs were really slow in serving and managing the place.
Over all my experience here was satisfactory!!

Visited this beautiful place with a friend on a sunday evening and quite liked it. Prices are reasonable compared to the other cafes in the area. Food is delicious. We had the caramelized onion- chicken- jalapeno sandwich first. It was yummy - well-made and the portion is sufficient. My friend ordered the onion-mushroom-chicken-cheese pie. It was a bit bland according to my taste. Next I had 'death by chocolate' which is a smooth thick syrupy concoction with loads of chocolate syrup and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Hot brownie with vanilla ice-cream and chocolate sauce was our next choice and it certainly was excellent. The place is spacious with good seating arrangement and attentive staff. More love to this place for being pocket-friendly.

This cafe is beautifully decorated and located near Hindustan Park. The decor is amazing.The cafe is spacious inside with both indoor and outdoor seating.The service was good and the ambiance was pretty nice. We ordered Cafe Latte,Mango Pango, French Fries and Chicken Lollipops. Cafe Latte was good and they served it with a cookie. French Fries were hot and fresh and the portions were enough for two. But the Mango Pango was very disappointing. It tasted just like kissan quash. Chicken Lollipops were average. Food was just okay. Prices are lil bit on the steeper side.Foods were not so satisfying like the decor.

This nicely decorated cafe is located near Hindustan park and has a large seating facilities with outdoor seating as well. The interiors are Well maintained and had a decent lighting. The ambiance is pretty awesome with soothing music playing in the background. 

We Ordered : Cold Coffee, Traditional BLT Sandwich and Grilled Chicken with Mushroom Sauce.

# Cold Coffee was thick and was nicely prepared. The strong coffee flavour was just perfect. 
# The Sandwich was the star among the dishes. A perfectly made Sandwich with Bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, chicken and a perfectly fried sunny side up egg. There were no fancy stuffing inside the Sandwich just these plain ingredients and it was really one of the best BLT Sandwich you could possibly find. Highly recommended.
# Grilled Chicken with Mushroom Sauce came with two well cooked chicken breast pieces with potato wedges, sauteed vegetables and Mushrooms and one sunny side up egg. The sauce was thick and prepare with pieces of finely chopped pieces of Mushroom and it was well seasoned. The boneless chicken breast was tender and juicy. The vegetables were nicely sauteed. 

They will serve you complementary cheesey butter and small breads.

Overall a must go place for everyone with friends and loved ones. The staffs were friendly and courteous. Prices were very reasonable.

One really good food joint in south kolkata. There service was good and the ambience was pretty nice. If you are quite a regular foodie travelling in south kolkata this joint will not be hard to locate.
Located near Feast street in hindustan park.

Food items tried:

1. JUICY CHICKEN BURGER WITH MUSTARD MAYO — a pretty decent burger and delicious too. The patty was extremely tasty and I happened to love the mustard mayo. Served along with fries and ketchup dip.

2. BARBEQUED CHICKEN WINGS — tasted like any normal bbq started. The taste was good but not worth the price. Also the bbq sauce in which it was tossed lacked the fierce bbq taste in it. It looked more like chicken lollipops rather than wings.

3. BARBEQUED PORK CHOPS WIGH SOFT POLENTA — the pork chops were tasty and the pieces were big enough. The dish was less spicy. Although the pork should have been softer. The dish was served with polenta which is the italian way of saying “suji” and tossed veggies. Also they gave complimentary bread and butter.@puspak

4. EXTREME KITKAT SHAKE — well there is a reason why they are famous for their signature kitkat shake. The presentation won my heart at a jiffy. The taste was really good. The shake was filled with kitkat crisps and chocolate bits. It was decorated with brownies, kitkats, ferrero rochers and rainbow sprinklers.

5. FERRERO ROCHER SHAKE — this was an average shake though. Could have been way better had they made it less thick. It was so thick that it became hard to suck in the shake through the straw provided.

The staff was good and helpful. Also they have outdoor seating and a pretty cafe with lots of small goodies, the interiors were well decorated and a perfect place to hangout with friends.

A small cafe located near Vivekananda Park. Interesting decor with colourful walls and paintings. They have both outdoor and indoor seating arrangements. They serve a variety of food items. 
We ordered Bang Bang Blueberry, Extreme KitKat shake , Golden fried prawn with chilli garlic mayonnaise & Chicken Sausage and Roast Chicken Stuffed Lasagne. 
Bang bang blueberry was a good try. Extreme KitKat shake is the most popular item here , so had to try this one. It's a little heavy drink though worth having. Golden fried prawn with chilli garlic mayonnaise consisted of 5 pieces nicely fried golden prawns along with sauteed veggies and chilli garlic mayonnaise. Chicken Sausage and Roast Chicken Stuffed Lasagne was too tasty. 
The food is very good and would like to try the other dishes as well. The service is a bit slow .Overall a lovely experience and would love to come back again. :)

3. BARBEQUED PORK CHOPS WIGH SOFT POLENTA — the pork chops were tasty and the pieces were big enough. The dish was less spicy. Although the pork should have been softer. The dish was served with polenta which is the italian way of saying “suji” and tossed veggies. Also they gave complimentary bread and butter.@puspak

4. EXTREME KITKAT SHAKE — well there is a reason why they are famous for their signature kitkat shake. The presentation won my heart at a jiffy. The taste was really good. The shake was filled with kitkat crisps and chocolate bits. It was decorated with brownies, kitkats, ferrero rochers and rainbow sprinklers.

5. FERRERO ROCHER SHAKE — this was an average shake though. Could have been way better had they made it less thick. It was so thick that it became hard to suck in the shake through the straw provided.

The staff was good and helpful. Also they have outdoor seating and a pretty cafe with lots of small goodies, the interiors were well decorated and a perfect place to hangout with friends.

A small cafe located near Vivekananda Park. Interesting decor with colourful walls and paintings. They have both outdoor and indoor seating arrangements. They serve a variety of food items. 
We ordered Bang Bang Blueberry, Extreme KitKat shake , Golden fried prawn with chilli garlic mayonnaise & Chicken Sausage and Roast Chicken Stuffed Lasagne. 
Bang bang blueberry was a good try. Extreme KitKat shake is the most popular item here , so had to try this one. It's a little heavy drink though worth having. Golden fried prawn with chilli garlic mayonnaise consisted of 5 pieces nicely fried golden prawns along with sauteed veggies and chilli garlic mayonnaise. Chicken Sausage and Roast Chicken Stuffed Lasagne was too tasty. 
The food is very good and would like to try the other dishes as well. The service is a bit slow .Overall a lovely experience and would love to come back again. :)

A small cafe tucked in the alley of Vivekananda Park,this is one cafe which stole my heart after a long time.
It was raining on a sunday evening when we sneaked in here with very little crowd around. Interesting decor combined with excellent music, a well lit & designed place, this is the place if you need a cosy corner around.
The food was very wholesome & value for money. I never had such a heavy drink as the kitkat shake there & if you don't have a very sweet tooth please don't go for it.
Apart from that we ordered meat lovers double decker sandwich & lime & litchy mocktail. All these resulted in a meal skip. Would definitely visit once again!

Been there on soshti with friends.
Ambience was quite cozy and sitting arrangements was also nice.
Had ordered aam panna mocktail,spaghetti aglio, some chicken dish as main course and dessert.
Service was soo delayed ..we waited for 45mins ..
Food was tasty.
Specially the dessert - choco lava cake with vanilla ice cream. This was yuummm!
The chicken dish was served with lots of veggies,mushroom,zuccini,etc. Plus had three pieces of chicken.. I must say that it was not at all tasty and it was covered with chicken ka skin. (Maybe some are used to have chicken with skin but we were not) complete food was wasted. Couldn't have chicken for 2days ..felt like vomiting.
But the dessert was a savior to our taste buds! 😋
 Order anything but not Chicken🙏

A small cosy cafe in Hindustan Park...had a nice time here with my Mom today evening :)

Ambiance -- Subtle,unique decor with colourful walls and paintings...Comfortable seating arrangements and soothing music...This place is actually quite perfect to go out on a romantic coffee date with your bae...😜😜 They have outdoor as well as indoor seating arrangements.

Food -- We ordered...

Golden Fried Prawn with Chilli Garlic Mayonnaise -- It consisted of 5 pieces of nicely fried prawn along with some veggies on th side and the taste was lovely...the mayo was yummy... :)

Juicy Chicken Burger with Mustard Mayo -- This one is one of their famed dishes...and after tasting it i can only say...Its worth the fame...It was soo damn delicious...Totally worth the price tag of only Rs.190...
Very filling and super tastyyy....
Highly recommended for all Burger lovers out there 😆😆😆

Vanilla Ice-Cream Shake -- It was fine as expected...Thick enough and quite tasty... :) 

Extreme Kitkat Shake -- Now this one is their most famed item... So had to try this one out as well...
And oh myyy...This one's not meant for one person alone...Its a meal in itself...Kitkat pieces,Crunchy chocolate ball,Brownie slice...you say the name and it has it...An all-in-one shake...😀😀
The shake tastes fine...the crunchy nutty choco ball was lovely...The Brownie was not that great but chocolate sauce on top of it kinda made up for it...
Overall a lovely item and worth its name for sure... :)

Service -- Yeah it was a bit on the slower side...but the tasty dishes served hot n fresh made up for it..so it was fine...The waiter helped us perfectly with our orders... :)

So overall a very lovely experience...Would surely love to visit again with my friends...CHEERS!!! :)

The atmosphere is soothing and very upbeat. Quite relaxing for friends to hangout and spend time. We ordered the vanilla ice cream shake and blueberry shake, tastes like ice cream thought quite flavoursome. Then we had classic Caesar salad, tastes good but presentation wise a let down. also I was expecting few more toppings with it. Then comes my favourite, spaghetti with bacon !! Absolute stunner. The pork chops with polenta was okayish in taste, the veggies assorting it were yumm but it needed seasoning and I would like the pork to be more on the roasted side.

One of my favourite places. Already been there 3-4 times by now and I am going to go there again. Talk about cheese and chicken pasta or the grilled chicken breast or ham wrapped chicken everything tastes amazing. Had tried most of the dishes but few are still left. The desserts say molten choco lava cake or blueberry cheesecake or caramel pastry or chocolate truffle all are just amazing. Among milkshakes i really like the blueberry one. Worth going again :)

This probably was one of the best cafés I've been to. The quality of food was unparalleled. Best burger I've ever had. The other dishes were sumptuous too. Decorated with little items, the interiors looked like it came right out of a black and white satyajit ray movie. 
The kitkat shake is a must try for all you foodies out there! If you're planning to spend money on a café, this is the choice you're looking for!

Cafe drifter is another cute cafe added to the list of best hangout places in Kolkata. Located in Hindustan Park , this place is quite easy to locate and it is only 3 minutes walking distance from Triangular Park.

The place has outdoor seating as well. The indoors have cute decorations, ample spacing and decent lighting. There is a wall which has pictures hung on it - that particular decor stole my heart.

We ordered :

√ Extreme Kitkat Shake : This was a shake with wonderful presentation with brownie,kitkats and sprinkles. It tasted really good. But it is recommended to share this shake among four because it would be too sweet to be consumed by one person.

√ Chicken Lasagne : They offer a decent amount of cheese and chicken. It tasted really good. Highly recommended !!

√ Grilled Chicken Breast : This was a special dish for that day. They offer two perfectly cooked grilled chicken with egg poach and veggies. The chicken tasted amazing.

√ Cafe latte : The coffee tasted good enough.

The service was a bit slow.

Overall,the experience was quite excellent ♥

After a really long walk during Durga puja almost around the wee hours we needed a place to refuel ourselves and that's when we headed to Café Drifter. It had been on the buzz for quite some time now and now I totally get it why. The atmosphere of the cafe is really welcoming and makes you wanna just sit with your friends and chill, with some beverages by your side. 

We had a Ice-cream Cappuccino & since I was craving for some desserts I decided to settle for the Hot Brownie with Chocolate Sauce and Vanilla Ice-cream. The dessert was heavenly. Also they add a mint leave on top which made it look really cute. The brownie was truly sinful and each bite just melted in my mouth. It wasn't very gooey and the portion was just right. 

The décor, as I mentioned, was very welcoming and adds a great hangout place to chill. The interiors with colorful wall painting and photographs are ought to allure you. They've also got some books,masks and few musical instruments for the visitors. Also the service was fast and the staff were decent. We went on talking for hours without realising the time. 

It's a great spot to have a good conversation with your pals & enjoy some great food along with you. 

Food : 4/5
Ambience : 5/5
Service : 5/5

We went there with a lot of expectations but we were not really happy with the food or the service. We ordered a blue lagoon, a virgin mojito, a masala cola and a kiwi twist. The kiwi twist was way too sweet and the virgin mojito had too much leaves. The other mocktails were pretty decent. Coming to the main course, we ordered pan-seared fish in lemon butter and slow oven cooked chicken and barbeque pizza. The chicken was pretty bland and the vegetables were not seasoned properly. The pizza was not upto the mark.We had to wait half an hour for each dish which is very annoying. The only thing which really soothed our taste buds were the desserts. The molten lava cake with ice cream and the cheesecake both were amazing. The decor and their playlist also worth a mention. So overall its a pretty decent place to hangout with friends but the food needs improvement

A very mandate festive lunch. Stepped there at around 3pm. Had to wait for 5-7 mins. It was okay because we were entertained so much by the decors outside. Then we got the seat front of the window!😍 it was definitely a wow factor. Now coming to the foods. We ordered chicken nuggets as starter. Ordered ham wrapped chicken but they said ham was not available 😒. So we ordered pork chops as main. But after getting the seat they didn't come to take our orders, we had to call them which is one of the cons. They served us within 15-20 mins. Had to wait a lot. Then we ordered two mocktails, blue lagoon and strawberry shake. In the middle of the drink, we recalled them about the mains and they served it after 10 mins of recalling🙄.
Chicken nuggets - tasted good. An orange dip was served with it. We enjoyed this.

Blue lagoon and strawberry shake - such a thirst buster ❤

Pork chops - served with polenta, and some veggies. The porks were extremely salty. But when you'll eat them with polenta it'll be tasted less salty. Still I didn't like them too much. And the plate they gave was little small for this.😂
And one thing, they didn't update their menu in Zomato. The prices were increased a little.
Allover a good cafe.

Wanna come here again for the ham wrapped chicken and barbecue chicken wings.😋

We were searching for a cafe for having some tea and good time when cafe drifter crossed our mind. This place has both indoor and outdoor seating. We sat inside where there was too much noise. We ordered Darjeeling tea, classic chicken Ceaser salad and egg and Chicken double decker sandwich. The reason for giving this rating is their slow service. We had to wait for more than 40 mins to get our food. Though the cafe is quite cheap the ambience and service turned us down.@

I visited this place in this pujo with two of my friends. It is located in Purna Das Road, near Vivekananda Park. The place has an outdoor seating as well as an indoor seating. The first thing you will notice when you enter the café is the decor which is pretty and eye-catching. The ambience inside is beautiful. It is definitely a place to have a peaceful conversation over a cup of coffee. The people there are courteous and welcomed us with a smile.
Coming to food, we ordered three plates of sandwiches ( One creamy corn, bell pepper and cheese, one caramelised onions, chicken jalapeño and one chicken and egg double decker ), one plate of barbequed chicken wings, one Death by Chocolate shake and one Virgin Mojito. Each and every item was delicious and deserves 5/5. 

All in all, I am pretty satisfied with my experience there and recommend this place to everyone.

Though the food and the ambience was really good, what disappointed us was the staff service. Its not that the Staffs are bad and misbehave. The staff strength is low giving way to Casual Staffs serving foods which they don't know about. 
Yesterday the Casual staff served me a dish I didn't order. Somehow, I was lucky enough to be from a Hotel Management Background and felt that the dish served was not the one I ordered. I called the boy who took my order. On realising his mistake he quikly rectified it. But the harm was already done. 
Barring this the food was good.

The Golden Fried Prawn with garlic Mayonnaise Sauce, The Corn and Chicken Pizza, The slow oven baked chicken and the Chicken ham  felt like heaven on earth. The molten lava cake was mouth watering and tasted equally good. A 4 from my side because of the other two factors. Continue the good work and train your casuals properly. It's your restaurant, these people will only destroy the hard work by the regular staff.

I like cafes with good interiors as most of you know and this really gives you a good vibe the moment you enter.

Since we were kind of full, we only ordered Oreo Shake (Rs 150) and a KitKat shake (Rs 270). 

And I loved both. Personally the former was better but KitKat wasn't far behind. Oreo had the biscuits on top of it while the latter had KitKat wrapped all around with peanut butter acting as a glue.

But one thing that really isn't nice is their service. As in, they forgot to bring the KitKat shake we ordered. We had to remind them twice before they could get me that. REALLY NOT ACCEPTABLE.

Otherwise it's a nice place with good vibes and fairly reasonable.

This cafe near Hindusthan park has quite a wide-spread menu serving pasta,burger,salads as well as baked and grilled dishes. The cafe is nicely decorated and there is out-door seating facility too.

I ordered chicken lasagne; it was good and quite filling with generous amount of chicken pieces and cheese. I had planned to order the grilled chicken platter too but was too full after having the lasagne.

So, for desserts I ordered chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice-cream, this was awsome.

But they should really improve the service as I had to ask them twice for water.

Let me start of this review by saying that you guys have to IMPROVE your service. Why does a person have to ask for water? Why does a person have to ask for glasses 4 times and not get it?

We ordered two Death by Chocolates, a chicken Lasagna and a plate of pork chops. The drink was just like cold Bournvita. 

The lasagna was good, but what really disappointed us was the pork you guys served. The seasoning was bad. 

The veggies were salty, the meat wasn't tender and the mashed potatoes lacked seasoning. Even the sauce was a mismatch with the pork. 

You guys really need to upgrade your services and your food. 

Would I go again? Probably not.

We visited this cafe on a weekday in the evening after seeing so many good reviews about it!

The interiors are done very nicely and one gets that magical charm once they enter the place. We were quite surprised that even on a weekday like Tuesday, this super cafe was bustling with people!

Moving over to food:-

Minestrone Soup- It tasted perfect! It was just like the authentic minestrone soup with exotic veggies as they vouch.

Garden Veg Burger- this burger is huge for a single person to finish! The patty although 1 seems like an amalgamation of two huge patties! It's soft and tasty. But we did not like the caramelised onion which was also stuffed. The flavour of it was overpowering. Overall, a good, decent burger.

Veg Lasagne- This was totally a heart taker! Perfectly cooked pasta sheets layered with some creamy arabiata sauce and oh so cheesy! A must try out here!!

Finally the much talked Kit Kat shake- Looked soo enticing and tasted good too, but was a little too chocolaty or sweet for our pallette!

Overall, a nice and cute cafe with different elements used for interiors like the old piano/synthesizer. Good staff and definitely tasty food. Pricing is also worth every penny.

The cafe is very easy to locate. If you're coming from golpark just turn right from Vivekananda park and it's on the right at the end of the road. It's 2-3 mins walking from Fillers. The Cafe has both outdoor and indoor seating, which is really nice. Because not many cafes in Kolkata have both of them. The cafe is nicely decorated, with pretty interiors. The outdoor seating is also nice, with a clump of trees around the area, and nicely lit. Now coming to the food- the food is good and many dishes are also excellent. The price as compared to other places is pretty decent. The coolers and their burgers are a must try. Which will satisfy both your quality and quantity portions.

Went to Drifter with my friend on 9th sep 17. The cafe is bit big compared to other cafe and ambiance is really impressive. Food was tasty but quantity was low and the price is bit higher side. 

We tried kiwi mock-tail, iced tea, double egg and double chicken sandwich, salad and desert.
The Molten Chocolate Lave cake with vanilla Ice Cream just out of the world - Must try ****
You can give a try once!!! 
Service not so upto mark.

Kolkata is witnessing a boom in cafe culture. Café Drifter is an addition to it. 
Location : Near( almost opposite) the Vivekananda Park. Prime location.
Ambience: very uniquely designed interior and exterior has made this cafe distinct from others.
Breverage: I tried kiwi twisted and it was great.
Food: I have tried their Bar B Q Chicken Wings. It's a smaller version of Chicken lollypop. Taste is good but doesn't have any wow factor!

Verdict : for a great adda with friends this place is absolutely perfect. I definitely return to taste their Burgers and Sandwiches. Let's see how much they can satisfy me.

A lot of cafes are up in the Hindustan Park area so my friend and I decided to give this one a try....
As we step in the ambiance is nice cosy and bright...its a really snug place.The staff is cordial.
The menu pricing is really good but there aren't too many options in vegetarian which was a big thumbs down for us!!

We ordered a veg salad with tomatoes, lettuce and mushrooms but to be honest we were literally fishing in the salad bowl to find some tomatoes or mushrooms because there was just too much lettuce.It smelled slightly stale and didn't taste that nice.

Then we had sphagetti with spicy arabiatta sauce.It was okay.Not too delicious but not that bad.

Bookmarked this popular cafe situated in Hindustan Park for quite a few months. Visited this place today for celebrating the birthday of my man.
Location : This place can be easily found using Google maps. It's located in Jatin bagchi road at the ground floor of a handloom boutique.
Ambiance : When we entered the place around 1 pm it was fully vacant. They have both indoor and outdoor sitting arrangements. We opted for indoor and got seated comfortably in a corner table. The ambiance is pretty awesome. It's perfect for a romantic date with your partner without any disturbance. No hurry and no rush. The playlist of this place is very good I must say. Good music along with tasty foods and a good company would surely make your day perfect.
Food Journey : Our Today's food Journey includes,
*Mocktails : 1. Mango pango
2. Bang bang blueberry
*Kolkata Special Starter : Chicken Cutlet
* Today's Special Main Course : 1. Grilled Chicken Breast In Mushroom Sauce
2. Spaghetti In Spicy Arabita Sauce
* Dessert : Chocolate Cup with sweet cheese and cherry
Firstly the two mocktails were served. Mango pango was sweeter one between them. The chilling mocktails refreshed us in the scorching afternoon.
Next the Cutlet was served. They served two cutlets along with a sauce dip & salad and it tasted absolutely delicious. The minced Chicken filling of the Cutlet is too good with perfect crispness. After completing our starter we ordered for the main courses. We chose one item from their special menu that was Grilled Chicken in Mushroom Sauce which was served in a plate with sausage, two grilled chicken breasts, Fried potatoes, grilled vegetables and egg fry. The dish itself was very appetizing as it was presented beautifully. Next the spaghetti was served. This was the only dish which I didn't like at all. It wasn't just suiting my taste buds. Something about the dish I didn't like was the flavour of some unknown herb used in it may be. Lastly we ordered for a chocolate cup filled with sweet cheese and cherry in dessert and it tasted decent.
Remarks : Our Overall experience is fine. I found the Service was quite slow and they were less attentive to the customers. They just forgot to serve us water which is a very important gesture. After having the main course they served us water when we asked for it. Service needs to be quick and prompt. Prices are inclusive of GST as shown in the menu. Currently in Zomato their new menu is not updated. There is a price rise in their menu after GST had launched. Giving 4 stars because of the foods and of course for their soothing calm ambiance. If they improve their service it would be definitely recommended.

Located just below handloom cottage at Hindustan Park!

Ambiance: It's big compared to rest of the cafe's around. I loved their chic interior and comfortable and spacious seating arrangements made.. they have maintained distance among the tables which is is awesome... Otherwise I have seen cafe's around here who have arranged more tables for accommodating more persons and the place in return turned out to be clumsy. 

Food: We ordered chicken breast with red wine sauce served with mashed potato and sauted veggies. It was good both quantity and quality wise. Also, we order death by chocolate shake which was not at all good... its was too sweet so, better avoid that. Also, we ordered cold coffee where i dint find a hint of coffee. We alsoe ordered cheese chilly cheese toast which was just ok!

Service: It was slow infact some times very slow. But the staffs were polite and always smiling which was good.. Also avoid their washroom outside the cafe.. i almost puked out of smell... please management look into it and clean your washroom frequently for customers.

The best part about this cafe is its very very cheap and price is inclusive of GST.

An amazing new found that is very easy on the pocket. Its a quaint little place near Vivekananda Park with a whole lot of non alcoholic beverages to choose from. Apart from this, the sandwiches with caramelized onions, chicken and jalapeno is also worth mentioning. However, the decor was so pretty that I forgot to take pictures of the food.

It was a very short visit to Cafe Drifter and we hadn't eaten much but the ambience was more or less wonderful for a weekend Sunday afternoon and they had good music playing (something hard to find these days). The cold coffee was beautiful, so was the Sparkling Kiwi Shake and the whole range of mocktails menu awaits our next visit. The arabiatta pasta was not bad but it was too herb-y, the sauce too runny, and the ham wrapped chicken stuffed with cheese and spinach was delightful. The chicken meat could have been softer. The delicious pies we wanted were unavailable and the waiter also asked me not to order the pan seared fish in orange and raisins compote which honestly sounded deliciously experimental. Hope I can try it next time! There is a lot on the menu to come back to!

We ordered Barbecued Chicken Wings for Starters. This dish was slightly underdone and tasted okayish. For Desserts, we ordered Extreme Kitkat Shake and Molten Chocolate Lava Cake w/ Vanilla Ice-cream. As for the Kitkat Shake, it looks exquisite. However, it doesn't taste as good as it looks. It rather tastes insipid and bland. We loved every bit of Molten Chocolate Lava Cake w/ Vanilla Ice-cream, though. This is the only dish that tasted heavenly! Also, loved the ambience of the cafe.

This place is situated in a place what you may term as a Food Street. We went there just to have the Kitkat shake but ended up filling our plate with various delicious items including Day's Special Baked Crab with Cheese and Mushroom and Pork Ribs. Its a small food joint with Live Screening facility for various occasions. There decorations and wall arts are also brilliant and carefully chosen. Staffs are well mannered and very attentive. We chose Fresh Lime soda, Baked Crab, Pork Ribs and Kitkat Shake. All of them were really delicious.

I would definitely like to visit again soon. Overall a 5/5 experience.

Cafe Drifter has created quite a buzz in the city amongst newly opened Cafes.So without going through many options,decided on hitting his place.
 
Without further a due,ordered for their Extreme Kitkat Shake,for which i actually visited this place.Giving an unbiased opinion,could have tasted better but full marks for the presentation.

Next we ordered their Lamb Patty Burger-Boy was i in love again.This undoubtedly goes into one of my favourite most burgers out there.The patty is oh so perfect and the buns have been equally tosted well,plus the cheesy hint in every bite.A dream really,they could improve on the bun quality but thats just a thing they could improve in this dish.

Next i saw a table ordering chicken lollipops but to my surprise,couldnt find one in the menu,hence enquired a waiter to know thats their Bbq Chicken Wings.Well,deep fried and subtly flavoured.

I might just go again if i have burger cravings .

The best place to hang out, chat, meet up, nibble on, sit and work, make music, or just be. The ambience and general vibe of Cafe Drifter just inspires you to chill out and let go, meet like-minded people...just to greet life with a smile and embrace all that comes with it. It's without a doubt one of the best cafes in town, the perfect haunt for all those awesome drifting souls who might just come across each other, spend an amazing moment together and move along on their way...

A short note about the food, though I think it's redundant, all the sweet stuff is extremely good, the burgers are awesome. The Kolkata street food section (fish fingers, egg devils etc.) are all pretty yummy. This cafe is a must for all drifters!

PS: no one is going to disturb you if you just sit and work or want to be by yourself. Now that's a rarity in this town!

Café Drifter is a cute little hang out zone near Hindustan Park, close to Vivekananda Park. With a smoking zone outside, all set with wooden benches and tables and lots of potted plants, and a wonderfully decorated interior, complete with book shelves, paintings, photo walls and other pretty trinkets, it provides a pretty chill ambience to chat with friends and to click them Instagram worthy photos.
The staff is very cordial and efficient, making the experience satisfactory.
However, as far as the food is concerned, it's kind of a  game of luck. Some dishes were really good whereas some were equally disappointing. We ordered several burger platters, all of which were very good so totally recommend. We also ordered a Ham wrapped chicken dish with a side of mashed potatoes and veggies which was to die for. But, the pies were a huge mistake. We ordered Ham and cheese pies which did not taste good at all. The pie base tastes like a tart base, sweet and flaky, which did not go with the ham and cheese filling. Also, it was too cheesy. Overall, a big no.
We also ordered cold coffee, virgin mojito and blue lagoon- all of which were very tasty.
Next, came the desserts. Do not go for the Black forest cake and Chocolate truffles, first one is too dry and tasteless while the other one is too sweet. However, the choco lava cake with ive cream was damn good so do try that.
So basically, some dishes are good and some are bad, no consistency, but it's cheap more or less and the ambience is lovely so do give it a try.

Went there few days ago with my better half... It is a spacious cafe which has indoor and outdoor seating arrangement... Interior was decently decorated (colourful wall painting , photographs etc)... There ambience was very impressive... Staff are friendly but very slow and untrained... Pocket pinch is on higher side... Now coming on food I tried there 

1) Lime & Lichi : - It was good...

2) Extrem Kit Kat Shake : - Taste wise it was not up to the mark and presentation wise it was awesome ...

3) Spaghetti Agilo E Olio ( non - veg) : -  We ordered non - veg Spaghetti Agilo E Olio but they served us veg one, it tasted awesome...

4) Meat Lovers Double Decker sandwich : -  They served cold and soggy sandwich with some french fries...

5) Chocolate Cup : - It was not good...

This offers you both indoor and outdoor seating. Situated in Hindustan Park, this place is absolutely perfect for anybody who needs a cool place to hangout and spend some quality time with friends. Not that we tried out much that the place had to offer, but whatever we did was more than enough to judge the kind of food they serve.
We had ordered fried bacon, sausage and mayo salad and ham wrapped chicken stuffed with cheese and spinach. Trust me, both of the items were perfectly cooked and we were left enjoying till the last bite. Also, an important thing is this place is really pocket friendly and can be explored by youngsters.

We ordered a chicken burger with mayo, chicken sandwich with caramelised onions and jalapeno, white sauce chicken pasta and pineapple pastry. Total bill was 730/- with tax and the quantity was more than enough for us! After we ordered they did not take much time to bring our food. We had a gala time and they have an awesome playlist! I would visit this place again!

Cafe Drifter is the talk of the town and well, it should be. My maiden visit to this place was planned. Visited with my friends on a weekend, founding it almost empty with two more customers. The decor is really done beautifully, very impressive. Coming to food, we ordered Jumbo Prawns ( this was in their special menu), Ham Wrapped Chicken stuffed with Cheese and Spinach, Grilled Chicken in Mushroom Sauce. Complimentary buns were served with the main course. For desserts we ordered Crunchy Caramel Pastry, Pineapple and White Chocolate Pastry and Red Velvet Cupcake with White Chocolate Frosting.

A soothing Romantic place with all kinds of Hindi songs playing at the back. A small cafe near Lake Road. Yet well decorated. Both inside and outside. Food quality is well and tasty. Quantity wise not too much. It's like 1 plate of a dish is sufficient for 1 person. I took a roasted chicken lasagne. One dark chocolate mousse and 1 pineapple cake piece. Total it costed me 390 Rupees. So if you can share then it will be cheaper. Otherwise it's a good cafe where you can hang out with friends....

After reading their reviews and seeing the rating I visited this cafe with my best friend for dinner last night to celebrate pre friendship day . Its a spacious cafe with a lovely decor and courteous staff . Coming to the food we orderd 
1 - creme of chicken with hint of thyme soup (2.5/5 bcoz it tasted very okayish also i got some plastic particles inside the soup altough i dint complain about it . Also the bread sticks they served with it was not crispy ) 
2- chicken stuffed lasagna ( 4/5 the lasagna was amazing definitely recommended but the garlic bread served with it was complete burnt other wise would hav given it a 5) 
3 - extreme kitkat shake ( 5/5. The shake was really extreme and too good  only if they would hav sticked the kitkat with nutelaa other than peanut butter it would hav been amazing ❤️) 
4- blueberry ice tea - ( 3.5/5 - ice wasnt served chilled at first .then we had to tell them to serve it chilled also it tasted more like raspberry and not blueberry ) 
5- motlen choco lava cake with vanilla icecream (5/5 - this was tooo good .)    Would definitely visit again to try their other dishes . Nevertheless its a good place to enjoy with friends and family .  Also im unable to forget their kitkat shake ❤️

Straight from the Sony centre near triangular park you will find this amazing cafe on the left side. Subtle decor , soothing music , certainly this is the best place for a romantic date. Having our lunch done we actually went their for having desserts . So we settled for hot brownie with chocolate sauce and molten chocolava cake with ice cream. But hearing a lot about their burgers we couldn't actually refrain ourselves from ordering a juicy chicken burger with mustard mayo. Both the desserts were beautifully presented and specially the molten lava cake was pure heaven. But the burger , this is something worth try . The cheese will melt in your mouth and the stuffing is so good ! One can't just get over it. And the best part , the place is inclusive of tax. Definitely recommended. :)

This cafe in Hindustan road is really warm and cosy. They food is really easy to our pockets. Plus the staff is very welcoming. I ordered a pasta, a chocolate shake and a molten lava cake. The shake was thick and we later on told them to add ice cream in it , and they were kind enough to do that. Can't wait to go there again and try more main courses.

This place, is a must visit..
The only reason i didn't give 5, is coz the fries were over-cooked and the toilet, isn't attached to the place and is messy.. i know its not related to food but you have to see everything
The ambience inside the place is so good.. 
Went to have extreme kit kat shake and ordered ham wrapped chicken with potato and spinach with a juicy chicken burger with mayonese and bacon
Probably one of the best burgers i have eaten and one of the best presented burger.. 
The ham was to die for, so so good
Coming to the kit kat shake, if you are a dessert and chocolate lover, this is probably what comes in your dream.
Loved everything

Cafe latte: this was as plain as milk. We had to tell them to add some coffee to it and even then I cannot applaud it much.
Barbequed chicken wings: the chicken was juicy but the sauce was little too tangy. Overall it was fine.
Chicken sausage and roast chicken stuffed lasagne: this was the only item I can recommend to people. Chicken and cheese can hardly go wrong. 
Grilled chicken breast with mushroom sauce: one of the chicken was stiff and the other was fine. It tasted blunt and the veggies were too salted. The bread that came with it was awfully stiff. It was difficult for me to tear it by my teeth.
KitKat shake: this is the most popular thing here. The shake looks amazing and tastes good. The brownie could have been better.
The staff is friendly but the service is quite slow. We had to tell them thrice for an extra glass of water. The person who brought it had not washed his hands properly may be as we could see a little chocolate cake at the side where he held it. 
In the end, I can visit this place for it's lasagne may be.

My review is based on the food I ordered for myself on Swiggy: 

The order was a juicy chicken burger with fries. 

The food was on time on. and it was a hot (Hate soggy burgers). The fries were packed separately In  foil wrap, which I suppose is the best way to keep them crisp. perfectly seasoned and a hearty portion. 

The Juicy chicken burger was big and perfect. It was really dripping down-your-chin-kinda juicy. It was chicken and the filler was potato. It was thick patty with a seasoning and cheese and tomato and lettuce and cucumber. 

The portion size is good and will be a whole meal for RS 170. 

Value For money - Yes
Will I order again Yes!

Based on some positive reviews, we thought of visiting this cafe.

LOCATION: This cafe is located in one of the lanes of Hindusthan Park. 
To be precise, get down at the hindusthan park bus stop, walk straight through the lane and this cafe is located  exactly on the opposite footpath of the King and Queen salon.

DECOR: Decorwise i just loved the place. This place is beautifully  decorated with colourful walls, comfortable seating arrangements and photographs. There was also good music in the background which i loved. 
Separated in two sections: the outdoor seating arrangement can be just perfect to enjoy the rainy weather. But we preferred to sit inside. 

FOOD:  Well, we had high expectations from their food after going through the reviews. We ordered 

1) CHICKEN IN MUSHROOM SAUCE  AND
2) BARBEQUED PORK CHOPS 

The chicken in mushroom sauce was from their special menu, but honestly there was nothing special about that dish. The sausages were salty, even the potato wedges that came along with the dish was over fried. Although the chicken pieces were good, didn't quite like the mushroom sauce. All the ingredients were not quite complimenting the dish. 

On the other hand, the PORK CHOPS were good. It was basically two meaty pork ribs along with veggies, mashed potato and potato wedges.. 
Really liked the tenderness of the meat, there was no much fat in both of the ribs which i liked. The sauce was better than the mushroom one but still didn't like the mashed potato. They have used to much poppy to flavour it which was not atall tasting well. 
But still, it was ok. We also got bread with herb butter on the side, which was great.

SERVICE: Their service was prompt, the guys were friendly. Now, i felt that it was not complete value for money. Maybe it was not their day. 
But the food items are all inclusive of tax and yay for free wifi. 
Have heard a lot about their desserts, so will be surely visiting this place again fr their cakes and shakes.

Ordered sandwich and chicken puff with mojito....errant and arrogant staffs started arguing when being asked why a simple chicken sandwich takes 25 minutes to get prepared. Thankfully after 30 minutes received the sandwich with rock hard bread.... never ever seen such arrogant waiters in life.
Highly not recommended and Zomato must take proper actions against this

The pie crust was undercooked and the Death by Chocolate shake was too sweet and highly unappetising. Staff refused to adjust the shake even on multiple requests. All in all entirely unimpressed.

After a DISAPPOINTING DINNER nearby, while passing we thought of visiting this new cafe... the ambience and the interior is really nice, very neat and clean. Surprised with the menu and the price as well. pocket friendly pricing and the menu is quite good and attractive in terms of variety. We were full so just ordered for a Pan Seared Fish with Mango Salsa and to my surprise they serve bread rolls along with herb butter. Breads were oven-fresh and OH GOD the food is just awesome.. Fish- well seasoned, cooked to perfection, soft and succulent and the mango salsa was refreshing and enhanced the taste with every bite. With their recommendation we ordered for Choco Lava cake, again it was OUTSTANDING, every bit was homemade including the chocolate sauce as well.
Cafe Drifter has ticked all the boxes and definitely it is on my bucket list I will be visiting very soon and quite often.. The concept of serving "Petit Pain" along with a main course indicates the authenticity is still alive... 
Hope to see more oulets of Cafe Drifter in the city soon....

Nice place in the same locality as various popular cafes in and around Southern Avenue. Nicely done decor, not too crowded. The crowd here was good, the service was prompt. Food was really good. And as a welcome change they had multiple bread options for the sandwiches. I tried the meat lovers sandwich which I would love to try again during my next visit to this cafe. The bacon was rightly cooked. They also have a Small outdoor sitting area for smokers like myself. A must try when looking for cafes in and around Southern Avenue.

This one is just a few steps away from FILLERS.parking can be done infront of the eatery.the decoration was pretty stunning.this eatery has a  spacious sitting arrangement.a nice & soft music at the background would definitely gonna make the mood.i had a nice chicken burger with mustard mayo & a double decker sandwich.each of the preparation had french fries in it.burger was really juicy.in the end i had a cold coffee which was nice & thick.the pricing was very much affordable as the bill was raised without gst☺.
Best part was the nice gesture of the staffs.as it was raining heavily i found it dificult to reach to my car.then one of the staff helped me on his own.he actually walked along with me to my car with an umbrella holding upon on my head.thanks a lot.
I would definitely gonna visit this eatery again.

After a very disappointed evening at the wise owl steak house we decided to give this new kid on the block a shot and man oh man were we glad that we did so. Decor was true to its name "Drifter". Loved the photo wall and the small witty quotes that adorned the whole joint. Would highly suggest sitting outside if the weather permits. Having had some really bad steak we were pretty full when we walked in which was sad as the experience that followed was just amazing. Starting from server "karan" who was energetic and was enthused about the food he served, was knowledgeable too. A soft warm bread roll with two types of herbed butter was served. Being a bread lover I happily devoured two of them before anyone could say "petit pain". We settled for the grilled fish with mango salsa. Yes! It was as refreshing as it sounds. Fish was cooked to perfection, flaky and succulent. Mango salsa was refreshing and added a beautiful sweet and tangy contrast to the savoury fish. For desserts we settled for a choco lava cake which I learnt was made in-house and so was the bread. Fresh bread in a cafe!!! yes they do take pride in that however they are modest enough to not advertise. Well Cafe drifter was a beautiful experience coupled with the freshly baked bread and choco lava cake I could not resist taking some of their cookies home. A must try if you are visiting that part of town. Keep serving great food team drifter.

Finally went to check out this cafe after hearing so much about this place.
Yes it is worth the hype. Full marks to the decor work and food presentation.

¬Chicken Lasagne was scrumptious. They put a lavish amount of cheese and chicken.

¬Meat Lovers Double Decker Sandwich is great. Plenty of meat layered between big grilled breads. You get some french fries and a dip with it.

¬Grilled Chicken with Mayo Sauce: it's a chicken platter with two thick grilled juicy chicken breasts. Some sausages, veggies and an omlette. They also give you two tiny pieces of bun.

¬Barbequed Pork Chops with soft polenta : A large piece of moist, tender pork loin with smoky classic Barbeque sauce. They serve an extremely smooth and creamy polenta (a cornmeal porridge that's a common dish in Northern Italy) with it.

¬Juicy Chicken Burger with Mustard Mayo: it has a huge chunk of Juicy patty and lots of cheese and mayo. Oh and some french fries too. 😍

¬Coolers which we had ordered : Kiwi Twisted, Brownie shake, Ferrero Rocher shake were amazing!
We didn't like the taste of Fizzy Peach Ice Tea, Shakalaka boom boom and Bubblegum Mojito.

This place is my personal favourite. A happening and pretty pocket friendly cafe nonchalantly tucked in the streets of Hindustan park , increasing the popularity of the residence.
The ambience of this cafe suits the youth- carefree yet perfect. The decor is on fleek as well. Coloured walls and cutesy stuff make this place look like home. One would find guitars and ukeleles too.
Coming to the food , I got only one thing to say - lip-smacking. The revamped version of all the regular dishes are amazing. They are good to look at and great to taste. Full marks for presentation and garnishing. And it's really overwhelming how they serve most of their dishes(nibbles) with complimentary fries.
What we ordered - extreme KitKat shake , juicy chicken burger with mustard mayo , double decker egg and chicken sandwich.
Taste - 4.5/5
Ambience - 4.5 /5
Value for money - 5/5
P.s- they don't charge you extra. Prices are inclusive of taxes

Today I and my school besties went to a very cheap cafe with an okay ambience as the interior was small and it looks too much crowdy when there are a lot of people and as a result everyone seems to become a part of each other's conversations and can over hear as well which I found disturbing . Apart from this the cafe was quite good as the previous one I went to did not excite me that much with its menu . We ordered a double meat sandwich which was just yum , a kiwi drink which was okay , brownie shake as oreo shake for which this place is quite famous was not there , honey chicken which was perfectly crunchy and at the same time juicy with all the honey and its condiments dripping and a choco lava cake which was good . Over all the food is cheap and good for hangouts with friends but not for dates though . I would love to go again and have other items . Thank you Cafe Drifter for not diappointing me .

Recommended...
Please improve your service or else it will become a huge backdrop for the place ..All the best
Will Visit soon..

This place has something to crave for. Located near Vivekananda Park this joint is beautifully decorated. I have went there atleast for 3-4 times and this place has never failed to impress me and my friend with their new innovative dishes. So everytime we went there we ordered new dishes.
Virgin Mojito, Blue lagoon lime juice (I don't remember the name), Kitkat Shake ( Best shake I've ever had), Brownie with ice cream and caramel sauce, Choco Lava Cake, Quail(though it was a bit overcooked, but still it was tasty), Chicken cheese Nuggets.
These are all the dishes we have tried so far and all of them are too delicious. They are reasonable too. I would suggest everyone to visit this joint atleast for once.

I landed at this place on a rainy Monday evening...as a result of a long due date...the decor..music if the place added to my already romantic mood...the menu had nothing exceptional other than the shakes... suggested by my friends who visited this place earlier..I ordered for the KitKat shake...and the bacon cheese ham pie... Both the dishes were sheer pleasure for the eyes...the pie was extremely cheesy and loaded with bacon n ham...however the crust is exceptionally biscuit-ty ...which made me literally scoop out the meat n cheese and leave the crust untouched... The shake looked heavenly...the taste was good..but the brownie on top could have tasted better... 
Over all a happy mood setting place for a mundane evening...

Well decor nice cafe to enjoy with friends... as well as for work purpose... with both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements.

Welcome was warm and friendly... Staffs were well behaved.

Service was quick as well.

I was there with two of my friends... We ordered cold coffee, pasta and extreme kitkat shake.

Cold coffee was good and refreshing.

Pasta was OK... need bit improvement (cheese/mayo could be added or mixture of oregano seasoning would taste better with it)

EXTREME KITKAT SHAKE was good in taste and it was REALLY AN EXTREME SHAKE.

Overall not a bad experience.

Would like to visit this cafe in future... Someday soon... to try out other items from this place.

Recommendable.

This place was suggested by a dear friend of mine to try out their special kitkat shake but the shop cafe was out of kitkats. Lol. Anyways, we ordered their special menu that was a cheese crab platter and death by chocolate. Crab item was okay as it was overloaded with cheese. Prices shown on menu are all inclusive of taxes. Death by chocolate shake was awesome. Thanks!

This is one of the most coziest cafés I've ever been to. The ambience is great and so is the decoration. Whereas one wall is decorated with various photo frames, another one is beautifully crafted with bright colors and brick sculpture. 
However the cozy small table with book shelf and colourful canvas is the one which will make you long to visit the place again and again.
The management is also good. It took them 5-7 minutes to serve the food. The guy at the counter was very friendly and well behaved and asked us how we liked the food.

Now, let's come to the food.
Well there's no extra GST or Tax. It's all included in the price. The price is reasonable and pocket friendly.
We odered cold coffee, blue lagoon and choco lava cake with ice cream.
I found the blue lagoon extra sweet. The sugar was a bit more than needed.
The cold coffee was good but could've been better. 
But the cake tasted very good and was also decorated very nicely. The decoration itself will give you foodgasm. 

It's definitely worth a visit. Do drop in with your friends sometimes as it's a good place to hang out.

Discovered this place a few days ago. Beautiful decor, reasonably priced food. There's nothing you won't love about this place. The grilled chicken in brown sauce was worth every buck with the perfectly grilled chicken, the poached egg, sausages. The chicken sandwich was very filling. Death by chocolate shake was yummy and heaven for a Chocolate lover. 
Brownie with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce was amazing with the perfectly moist brownie and big scoop of ice cream.
Would definitely visit them again and again.

Definitely one of my favorite places. The pork chops here were delicious and not too fatty, unlike those at macazzo and Hondos. I've never had quail before and it was mouthwatering but not overpriced. The decor of the cafe is lovely and the staff were well mannered and courteous. They saw to our needs regularly. 
The shakalakaboomboom drink was wonderful. Sweet and sour with a spicy kick at the end. The chocolate shake was also nice. Definitely going to go back there for more.

With all the buzz building around this place we had to drop in. Located in the lane of Vivekananda Park it is easy not to miss the eye. Both indoor & outdoor seating arrangements will satisfy alot of hungry tummies. The interior had uncoloured brick walls with pictures & collection of some old stuffs put very rightly. The chairs had an urban touch to it. To be judgemental we settled for,
🍹Kitkat Shake: a mouth watery shake with brownie & kitkats topped by a chocolate ball with sprinkled candy. I liked the way they used peanut butter to stick the kitkats. Recommended.
🍱Grilled chicken in mushroom sauce: 2 chicken breast properly grilled tossed in nutty mushroom sauce served alonside sautéed veggies, potato wedges, sausages & poached egg. With these they gave bread & garlic butter too.
🍔Juicy chicken burger with mustard mayo: a jumbo patty tucked between the wholesome buns served over lettuce leaves, onions, mayo & cheese sided with french fries & ketchup. I will recommend this if you are a burger lover though there are other meat options too.
Truly a worthy time spend without losing a lot of pennies, can be checked in atleast once. They host live sports screening too. Points deducted for lazy servings & no courteous approach by themselves.
P.S. They don't charge taxes yet.

Southern Avenue has always been an offering of silence in the bustling endlessness of Calcutta. Over the years, I have always found myself visiting this part of the city, walking in silence along the bridge, and resting at Barista for a cup of coffee after.

Yet, all such tranquilities were dispersed to oblivion when I visited Cafe Drifter.

It is a glamorous cafe, there's little doubt about that.
Yet, that's where the beauty ends.
The food is mediocre at best. If you are lucky, your burger will try to live up to the fame that the owner often dispenses to it. The sandwiches are bearable however.

As for the ambience, no one wants to listen to the loudest white noise at a cafe.
The drinks are heftily priced for no particular reason. Sitting for a cup of coffee alone would be quite the burn in one's pocket.
But the reason why the place gets its notoriety is the owner. Affixing himself into every conversation the customers might have, his hospitality is borderline cumbersome and claustrophobic.

When I visit a cafe, my priority is peace. That I shall be left alone to my devices. If you are lucky, then such a wish will be granted at Cafe Drifter.

If you aren't, please prepare yourself for the most exhausting conversation of your life.

Cafe drifter is somewhere i would love to go again and again. The ambience is amazing. The way they serve their foods is just mesmerising. The stuffs are helpful as well. If you're going for the first sometime i would suggest, do order the kitkat shake, this is must have. The best thing is you don't have to pay the taxes and so its pocket friendly as well.

As a committed cafe lover, I keep scouring Zomato for new places to visit. Cafe Drifter suggested itself, so this is where I went with BFF last evening. It's right beside Vivekananda Park and has outdoor as well as indoor seating. The interiors are cheerful, with comfy seats, lights hanging from knotted rope and an ukulele in the corner. We took a corner seat and ordered a Brownie Shake, a Sparkling Kiwi shake, a Juicy Chicken Burger and a Chicken Mushroom Pie. The shakes arrived first, and I'm sorry to say that they were very, very average. The Brownie one was thick, but way too sweet, and the brownie itself tasted a bit stale. And the kiwi one had next to no flavour of kiwi in it! Disappointing. The food, however was much better. The pie came with a nice drizzle of balsamic vinegar and was crumbly and full of cheese. The burger was great - huge, and full of cheese and mayo. The chicken patty in it was delicious! Our bill came to 550, which was reasonable when you consider the nice environment and the portion sizes. But I definitely cannot recommend the milkshakes to anyone. Overall? I'll be generous and give 3.5 stars because I had a nice evening.

I've already been here thrice and I got to visit again.
One of the best go-to cafes we've visited in this city...
One need not mention what a beauty the Kitkat shake is... their Chicken cutlet (very reasonably priced) is probably one of the finest Chicken cutlets I've ever had, with the juicy minced chicken filling..
The Juicy chicken patty in the Burger and the fine mayo makes it worth every penny..
Do try the Cucumber Cooler and green apple mojito, these are new launches.. and keep up to the summer thirst quenching.
The other items the Exotic veg in cheese pasta, Egg devil, Blue lagoon were lip smacking as well..
Special mention about the wonderful garlic bread given as a side.
Service: very good
Ambience: 4 words. I just love it.
We also had a Brownie with ice cream and Cold coffee on our last visit. :)

This nice and cosy cafe is situated just opposite to the Vivekananda Park on Jatin Das Street. Ambiance is wonderful and the place has got a positive vibe to it. Food quality is awesome and the dishes absolutely made my mouth melt specially the Baked Cheese Prawns. Pricing is a bit steep but that cannot be complained against taking into the wonderful ambiance and excellent dishes. Overall a highly recommended place!

Full points to : ▪️decor/Ambiance ▪️service ▪️KitKat shake ( was thick and tasty and appearance is super cute) 
Now comes the bad part 
▪️They don't serve regular water, basically you have to shell out money for drinking water too.. Since when is water not complimentary! 
▪️The fish finger is the worst I have had.  Can you imagine bad fish dishes in Kolkata 😕 SIN!  Couldn't taste the fish at all, only  thick bland batter which was no where near crispy.

A nice little cafe in the lanes of Southern Avenue, Cafe Drifter ticks all the boxes. Nice, quirky and creative decor. Good quality and quantity of food. Good service. Perfect for hanging out with friends and family. We had ordered Grilled Chicken, Grilled Pork Chops, Ham wrapped chicken stuffed with cheese and spinach, Death by Chocolate Milkshake and Choco Lava Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream. All of the dishes were really delicious and well prepared!

Café Drifter, located in one of the bylanes of Gariahat , is a small cafe with a pretty interior and outdoor seating. The theme of the restaurant is related with travelling , with a photo wall on one side and very cool decor. We went here in the evening for a snack. 
We ordered the egg and meat double decker and the meat lover's double decker sandwiches. We also ordered the corn , capsicum and cheese sandwich , pasta in mixed sauce and a blueberry milkshake. All sandwiches tasted good. I particularly liked the meat lover's double decker as it had ham, bacon , and chicken and lettuce in a creamy dressing , with an olive on top and crispy fries to accompany it. The pasta was also cooked well , in the mixed sauce and it had more of tomato than the white sauce. It was well balanced. The blueberry milkshake tasted more like strawberry milkshake. They serve a variety of pies too from which I ordered the ham and cheese pie. It was basically a tart( the tart pastry tasted very good ) with a filling of ham cooked in white sauce and topped with cheese. It was creamy and delicious. 
For dessert we had the choco lava cake , dark chocolate mousse cup and the brownie with ice cream. The choco lava cake tasted like it's supposed to and had a really thick and rich chocolate batter oozing out when you'd break into it. The brownie was dense and chocolatey and the mousse cup was good too. All the food was adequate in quantity and priced very well. It's one of the places that does not charge vat. Hence , very affordable. The staff is friendly and cooperative. It's a lovely place to hang out in the evening.

This place has garnered quite a bit of loyal patronage in it's short stint. The decor is neat, interesting and fun. The outdoor area, though pretty narrow, is cozy too. Their coffees are good and this place is definitely  worth a visit.

Very rarely are cafes a 5/5 to me. 
But this one left me with no other option. This place is a delight. Be it the surrounding, the ambience, the interior, the cozy yet fresh feeling inside, and totally the food. 
Located just ahead of Zucca lounge at vivekanada park, below handloom house is this sheer comfort . 

We settled for a fresh lime soda, hot chocolate and a grilled chicken with mushroom sauce. 
The dish was served alongside sauteed veggies, potato wedges and sausages and bread rolls. 
I opted for a choco lava cake, and it was a tiny pretty dish filled with yummy molten choco lava. 
I loved the pretty blue wall with amazing little pictures, and also how the area is segregated into varied seating styles. 
Coming back soon soon! 
Cheers!

It is located near triangular park, Rashbehari Avenue.The outdoor seating is really nice. I tried their extra cheese lamb burger topped with french fries, blue lagoon, hot brownie with chocolate sauce and ice cream, golden fried prawn with chilli garlic mayonnaise, death by chocolate and molten chocolate lava cake. Shakes are really good. Death by chocolate is a must try. Service is fast. Staffs are also very polite and friendly.   Overall, a great experience.

Went there a few days back with a friend..It is easy to locate..It's just between Good Old days and Zucca lounge..The first noticeable thing will be it's weird yet unique and beautiful decor and the quite interesting outdoor seating..The ambiance is great and the staff were very courteous..They made sure we liked the food..We ordered caramelised onion and chicken sandwich, (brown or white bread as your preference), juicy chicken burger, hot brownie with vanilla ice cream, masala coke and lime and lichi..The drinks were refreshing and the food was great too..They were huge in portions (compare to some other places) and tasty too.. Though the service was a little bit slow..But overall it was a good place to hangout and eat..
P.S. All the prices are tax included..We paid just 634 ruppees only..Will revisit for sure..

👍 décor, ambience, food
👎 Service a little slow

This place is colourful and very well decorated with different seating areas for different type of groups, duos or even for singles. Their interior is quite different and attractive, specially the wall of small photos really took away my eye for a long time... though we settled inside but I really liked their small seatings outside too... also their behaviour was nice. Coming to food, we ordered SANDWICH - CREAMY CORN BELLPAPER and CHEESE, PASTA - CHEESE SAUCE AND EXOTIC VEG, CHOCOLATE TROUFLE SLICES, CRUNCHY CARAMEL PASTRY and CAPPUCCINO. No complaints with anything at all. Really we got a great evening with delicious fiilling food.

Well we did not find any rush in this place so yeah!! You can seat and talk and take your time, enjoy the food totally!! 😊

Reading the mixed reviews about this place we were in dilemma whether to go here or not.
However,the food items seemed to be attractive to me and the prices are all reasonable and inclusive of taxes.
So I insisted my boyfriend to try this cafe.
From the enterance itself,i loved the cafe.
It has a pretty lawn with outdoor sitting arrangements.
For the sun,we sat inside.
The interior is well decked up with nice lights,decors and guitar.
We ordered for a sharp vinegeratte chicken salad and cold drinks.
The salad was amazing and we both loved it.
Coming to the bbq chicken wings,this was the best food we had there.
The wings were perfectly smoked and the sauce was so delicious.
As per their suggestion,we took a country style chicken steak in mushroom sauce served with all my favourite stuffs-poached egg,sausages,sauted veggies,potato wedges.
The chicken could have been more tender.Otherwise it tasted nice.
We had a blueberry shake which was made in vanilla ice cream base was bliss.
The dessert got us cray cray.
The molten hot lava cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream gets full marks from me,be it presentation or taste.
The staffs are friendly.
I will surely love to visit this place again.

I had seen and heard a lot of good reviews of this place but my own experience with the food here does not reflect that.  It's sad, I had a lot of expectation from this joint. So this review will reflect highly on the experience with the food I had here.

Let's get to it. We decided to visit this place one  evening. The first thing that you fall in love with is the decor.  The inside is beautiful, flawless, and you know that a lot of effort went into making it look aesthetic as it does. Nevertheless, we decided to sit in the outdoor area since it's a smoking zone as well. The staff was courteous but service was a little slow but that is acceptable. 

We had ordered  Pork Chops and two lamb patty burger with extra bacon. 

One thing that Drifter is top notch in is presentation. The food is aesthetically pleasing  and beautifully laid out. It looks delicious. But they fail in the taste department.

The pork chops were very hard and very fibrous to the point  that it was inedible.  I loved the flavor and the sauce,  but with the meat being that hard, it ruined the dish.

The burger  was another disappointment.  The bacon was hard. The cheese was tasty. But the patty was the biggest issue.  It was more of minced meat in a coating. It was horrible and had no flavor. It made the burger soggy. And  eating the burger gets very messy. The meat spills out making everything a soggy mess. It was hugely disappointing.

Now, seeing all the reviews of this place, I still feel that I just had a bad day here. Because I have brilliant reviews of this place but my own experience was nothing of the sort. I will visit again once and check out other dishes. I hope they don't disappoint.

So today was my second visit at drifter. Last time when i visited the place it has just opened and we had the most talked about Kitkat Shake and Berry blast Cheese Cake . So this time i decided to have the other talked about dish thai is Chicken Lasagna. For the sweet craving i had the Red Velvet Cake.
The Chicken Lasagna i think is the must try dish here. It was properly baked and it tasted delicious. Even my friend complimented it as "totally worth the price".
The Red Velvet Cake was just okay for me. I would really recommend to replace it with Red Velvet Cheese Cake since the Berry Blast Cheese Cake that i tried last time is still my favourite.
Let's not talk about the ambience because this is a place that will teach you how to be the most creative and unique at the same time. Even though the place is not huge it gives you a homely yet totally different vibes. Apart from good food i love this place even more because of their ambience.
The staffs here are very nice though not many in number. I don't have a single complain about this place and i plan to visit here again and again.

This is one of the latest addition to the long list of cafes in Southern Avenue. Located next to Vivekanda Park, this cafe is neatly done and also hosts a small and neat smoking zone. 

The food is good and the place is ideal for long chats and adda over a cup of coffee. The service is fairly decent and the staff behavior is courteous. It also serves a range of confectioneries and desserts to chose from and also few options in the main course. But what goes best with the tea and coffee are the finger food they serve that goes perfectly to fuel the conversations. Overall a decent experience. Prices are at part with the cafes in its vicinity.

Today I went to this place after viewing the ratings of Zomato. Firstly, I am very impressed with this place. The decor is wonderful and different. There is a wall with many small pictures which is unique and I liked it. I would give the decor and ambiance 5/5. My friends loved the place as well and thanked me for selecting the place 😝

We ordered grilled pork chops ribs with chicken sausage, death by chocolate shake, ferroro rocher shake and molten lava cake with vanilla ice cream. The tates are great. The pork chops ribs were too tasty. The shakes had different tastes and so I liked them. When u dig in the molten lava cake,hot dense chocolate comes out from it and it's just heavenly. The prices are inclusive of tax, which is a good thing.

The service and staffs were prompt and helpful. They only suggested us to have the pork ribs. The interior of the cafe will definitely lift up your mood after a tiring hectic day. It's a cool place to be with your friends and gossip and specially for your sports lover friends because there is a huge screen where they show matches.

I will surely visit this place again!!

As it was a surprise for me. So, first of all let me say that it's really worth a surprise for the first timer's....
Now starting from the ambience, the concept of the interior, the food, the service everything is exceptional, everything over here has an international touch of simplicity, which I look for in most of the food stop I go to.
We ordered a juicy chicken burger with honey mustard mayo sauce,egg chicken sandwich and a virgin mojito... Though it took a bit of time to serve the order. But after we took the first bite of the sandwich & especially the burger we felt that its worth waiting. Everyone must try THE BURGER (JUICY CHICKEN BURGER -with honey mustard mayo sauce) but be carefull of tounge because I burnt my tounge while having it. But not offended at all due that because once one taste it he/she will forget everything. What is there in the burger??? that I am not going to tell you , that you have to find it out by visiting the cafe..One thing I can say that its not a normal burger that we have in McDonald's OR KFC or in any other cafe....its completely different and outclassing.The service was prompt and most importantly which most of the cafes as well as many legendary restaurants in Kolkata lacks that is the staffs are non-interfearing! The price is reasonable...depending upon the quality and quantity.
So I recommend people to go and check out this cafe I'll add this to my shortlists.
In brief I'll say that CAFE DRIFFTER will really drift you away ;)

Been there for the first time. Convenient location but not over crowded. Lovely ambience. The decor was very artistic and pretty. Service was good and the employees were pretty cooperative. Food took a bit time to arrive but it was absolute heaven. The food looked quite appetizing and was delicious. Loved it to bits. The pocket pitch was also not much. It was reasonable compared to other cafes in town. Place was very neat and clean as well. Definitely will visit again Deep Sil

This cafe is located in the lanes of Hindustan Park beneath a saree shop. The cafe is very nicely decorated which is likely to give positive vibes. The walls are decorated with pictures quite unusual, they have a very unique piano-cum-typewriter placed just at the entrance. The seating area is very warm and cosy. 
The menu has a variety of food items. We ordered bubblegum mojito, bang bang blueberry, juicy chicken burger with mustard mayo and oven -cooked chicken with veggies and mashed potatoes. The bubblegum mojito was really good giving a typical taste of mojito. The bang bang blueberry was a good choice and I wanted to order one more but didn't. The flavour of blueberry was perfectly going with the mocktail. The burger was of special attraction. The chicken patty, veggies, perfect blend of mustard and mayonnaise will make you dive into this beastly burger. The chicken platter has mashed potatoes and veggies with two pieces of juicy chicken. It's a wholesome dish and will get you full.
The food is very good and I would definitely like to try the other dishes soon again. The service is good enough and the ambience is perfect. The price is reasonable and will fit into your budget. You will leave this cafe with a happy soul and a full tummy. 
A must try.

This place has a wall dedicated to bunch of photos clicked by various Photographers. Treat to our eyes. Staff is courteous . In case you meet this cafe's owner  Pablo , just don't hesitate to strike a conversation. He Knows almost everything around him. The food  is great. Burgers & Lasagna are my favorites. This small team is working hard to shine. They are shining infact. Cheers :).

Wonder why haven't I visited before. It's located opposite to Vivekananda Park. 
The ambience is serene, peaceful and vibrant. A spacious seating arrangement along with an outside seating area too. A wall where paintings were put up, a huge window onlooking with solo chairs if you wish to spend time all by yourself. Also amazing music being played. 
Full marks to the ambience.
The food we ordered was equally great. 
1. One of the best Barbeque Chicken Wings I've had. Decent proportion.
2. The Chicken Cutlet wasn't the regular one, it had minced chicken and tasted delicious. 
3. Strawberry Blast Mocktail was a saviour in the summer.

The service too was good. They made sure we liked the food. The staff were really cooperative. A little fast service time would be even better. 
The prices were very reasonable, the menu being inclusive of taxes. We had a bill amount of Rs. 360/-
I had an amazing time here. Very happy with this place. Surely going back for more.

Been to this cute little cafe, with a friend who seemed well acquainted with this area and was determined to take me to a unique place! It was right after Pujo, last October! I remember bingeing on sandwiches and iced tea! I also remember the extremely delicious brownie with chocolate sauce, and the loooong wait for it to be served (which left us wondering whether we had actually asked for the brownie or were just hallucinating!!!) 

Two things struck me as soon as I entered this place! 
First, the cafe was beautifully adorned with all sorts of artifacts and souvenirs from around the globe, which made it evident that the owner was a globe-trekker of sorts! 
Second, the host himself was very friendly!  We had a little chat with him about why he had chosen Calcutta for coming up with this beautiful and quirky cafe, as I felt it was more apt for a place like Bangalore! He bowled us over by saying that Calcutta was where he belonged and he wanted to come up with something unique in his own city! 

We found some college kids painting one of the walls! Sadly, a group of elderly ladies (who seemed to have met after a long time), were disrupting the cozy ambience, with their rather loud banter! However, we didn't mind, as it was Bijoya season, and they left after a while! 

Warm, unique and very young---this is definitely one of the most happening cafes in town! ....and the host just rocks!!! ;-)

Was completely stunned with the dish that I was served. The tart was baked to perfection. The filling was finger-licking good. Kudos to the management!!!

The ambience is great. The owner even more so. Cafe drifter is a lovely place to hang out and their KitKat shake is an absolute delight. Their menu is a really interesting one, but their spagetti is amazing. They do come up with some special dishes from time to time as well, like during winter they had a menu including Turkey in Plum sauce and Roasted Chicken. Their pricing is a little on the higher side and it would be great if the service is a little faster.

In love with the decor of this cafe, this is the place you should hit if you want a good ambience, space and good food.


Tried their Cafe Latte and Black Filter Coffee.
Would recommend the Black Filter coffee, its great.

She ordered SPAGHETTI GLIO E OLIO, it tastes nice.
I ordered grilled pork chops, that was amazing.

also tried few of their desserts, liked them all.

Staffs are very friendly.

This is a very good place to chill out with your friends. It's a cafe with comfy sitting arrangements, nice decor and a projector playing the T.V channels. The cold coffee and ceaser salad are good. Other items are also quiet decent. Pocket pinch is minimal.
Recommended.  
Edited: Tried their Chicken Sausage and Roast Chicken stuffed Lasagne and it was phenomenal.

An amazing cafe, with a cozy easy atmosphere, this is located in a lane on Purna Das Road. The ambience and service in this place were both brilliant and the quaint seats and innovative decor lends this place an aura of it's own. 
The food itself was delicious as well, with the slow cooked chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies being beyond par, while the sharp vinegarette​chicken salad was healthy as well as tasty. The desserts were worth dying for as well. We had the coffee and sweet cheese in a chocolate cup and a berry blast cheesecake.
The let down however were the mojitos. While the twisted kiwi was good, the shakalaka boom boom disappointed. The Shirley temple was not available as well.
If the mocktails are improved this is a perfect place for long discussions with delicious food at more or less affordable prices.

Lovely cozy ambience , interiors with a blue tint , an outdoor smoking allowed seating area and good food is all about Cafe Drifter. The service was very warm and quick. Food arrived in just few minutes.
My ITALIAN MINESTRONE SOUP and VINAIGRETTE CHICKEN SALAD was so good , couldn't find any flaw. My friend had a CUPPACCINO and SLOW COOKED SPRING CHICKEN WITH RED WINE SAUCE , the coffee was a bit on the thinner side , the main dish was sumptuous with side buns ,the red wine sauce was tasty , the accompanying mashed potato and sauteed vegetables were great as well , the chicken could have been a little more soft, it was difficult to cut with knife .
The dessert BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE had enough flavour of blueberry in it , just than the gelatin content was higher than needed. These minute detailings if taken care of , this place is all set to soar even higher.

This is a nice and quaint cafe beside the busy markets of Gariahat. Quite upmarket and hip. Come here if you'd like to catch up with friends, or just need a quiet cafe to work out of. I tried out their Meet Lovers' Double Decker Sandwich and Black Forest pastry. Both of them were yum. I'd advise you to stay away from their Mocktails though. They are pretty meh!

This cafe has a really nice ambience. Loved the interiors. Very chic very pretty kinda artsy at the same time. All the items we tasted were delicious except the lamb patty burger which was a lil dry. Other than that it was pretty good. But service could be better 3/5.

A nice and a bright place, Cafe Drifter. Used to go past it regularly, just didn't have the opportunity to go inside. Last Sunday - 12 Feb finally went it and felt that I was missing something 
Bright and fun interiors with a lot of interesting knickknacks on display.  The guitar and an accordion was particularly interesting. 
The service was lovely. Personalised yet not over powering. 
A friend and I ordered lemon honey tea and fresh lime soda with ham and cheese pie. The beverages were fine and the pie was very good. It was stuffed with shredded ham and cheese and had that typical gooey cheesy flavour. The one observation was the pie didn't have a cover as in a crust on top. I would have loved it that way. Nevertheless it was nice to eat 😊
For the main course we had ordered grilled chicken in red wine sauce and grilled veggies. For myself I ordered pork chops in mushroom sauce and grilled veggies and a fried egg, sunny side up. 
The chicken. Was nice and tender and the wine sauce has all the goodness of the drippings and beautifully blended with the meat. In the veggies, the carrots hasd gone off and that was a disappointment. 
Coming to the pork chops, it was slightly undercooked. A littles less pepper and salt would have made the meat a little more tasty. I should have been given a steak knife cause cutting the meat was a bit of "work."
The bread rolls were not soft at all that needs to be in@ worked on. They should have been fresh.
Brownie with vanilla ice cream and chocolate mousse was great. 
I am sure it wouldnt be too much of a work to look into these couple of issues and set them right. 
Hoping to visit Drifter soon and definitely not drift away. 😂

Situated just behind Vivekananda Park, this is a cute café with some quirky decor and a nice ambience. We had ordered Ham cheese pie which was delicious. Along with it, we had a HawaHaawaii mocktail, which was very refreshing. We also had a Death By Chocolate Shake and as the name says, it was worth dying for.
Then we ordered a Pork Ribs in mushroom sauce from the Specials. It was a huge platter loaded with sausages and vegetables and a poached egg. The pork ribs were very juicy and nicely done.
I am surely coming back here soon. Highly recommended.

Tried via Swiggy...ordered chicken soup , chicken sandwich and fish fry. The soup tasted like the instant one only add on was a hint of thyme herb which added to the flavour. Not a creamy chicken soup with freshness. The sandwich was good with caramelized onion , I had added extra cheese n fried egg. Quite a mouthful n satisfying. The accompanying French fries was a spoiler. ..drenched in oil represented a bad aloo bhaja . The disaster was the fish fry. Do u recollect the potato coverage for a Bengali mutton or egg chop ?? The covering under crumbs tasted same ....The first bite fills ur mouth with the crumb n potato filling then some scanty fish is visible. ...I guess I should have avoided the order when I saw it was priced at 65 a piece. ..u don't get fish fillet in that price. Cafe Drifter I'm going to drift away from ur food I cannot waste to lose my palate on this 👎👎

A cool joint in the vicinity of southern avenue, at first when you enter, you get that wow feeling. Very well made and creatively done. I truly like the seating arrangement and the way space has been utilised. 

A large screen is a plus specially on days when we have sports to watch and want a really nice place to hang out with friends. 

Overall the quality of food is good and prepared well. I quite liked the Egg devil. Mojito wasn't too great but the chocolate shake we had was superb. The menu is wide for a cafe and has variety. 

Service is too slow and the staff are just about ok. Not experienced I felt.

Had a catch up with a few friends on a weekday morning and cafe drifter is what we choose. My first experience at this place was just decent. We started up with a pork salad and my friends liked it. Next was a absolutely stunning chicken cultlet, the mutton burger which I had expectations from was messy and the patty was not up to the mark. The lasagne was yummy though the quantity could have been better, lastly my cold coffee tasted just milky, on asking them to add some coffe to it the blended the beans which was for decoration making it inedible. The service was tad slow until the owner arrived and took over.

Had heard of this place - was close to my house, so decided I'd try it. Went in, nice decor, reasonably spacious, though there were LIGHT BULBS hanging from the ceiling - donno why!
Anyway, decided to order a pie, when I did, found out the price was WITH TAX - so far so good! When it came, it tasted good, but - it WAS THE SIZE OF A SMALL PASTRY! It costed EIGHTY-NINE RUPEES!! For that price, I had thought that there's no way this pie would be *dinner*, but I was not prepared for a ripoff of THIS SCALE!! Will NEVER VISIT THIS PLACE AGAIN - AVOID AT *ALL* COSTS!!

I landed there by chance with a friend, and have not regretted. The joint has outside seating arrangement which was filled up, showing its popularity. We went in and was much amused by the seating arrangement.  The tiniest corner was utilised for seating in such quirky manner that you would feel like trying all of them at once. But the tables are too short for two persons. I found they have bakery display too, but my friend was really keen on trying main food. The menu card contained variety and multiple cuisines. We zeroed in on chicken lasagne as comfort food and coffee. The young staff was a smiling man.

The coffee tasted good. Then lasagne came up in a small square dish. It tasted bland - but the chicken pieces were juicy and the cheese was yummy.

Ample parking space.

Price on the higher side, but looking at the ambience, it suits.

I heard the chatter bout Cafe Drifter from Delhi & is the first review after I left Delhi n in Kolkata. 
So drifter, nice Interior's, cool outdoor sitting, great location, ample parking, everything seemed in sync and elegant. Service was slow but good except I was served a wrong sandwich. The server realised the mistake n changed it. 
Food: I was impressed wat I saw when I peeked inside the kitchen. Senior chefs in clean uniforms cooking and running the show very professionally unlike most cafes in kol.. the food was pretty average though but the prices astonishingly low. The salad was 140 and ok, the dressing could be sharper but was good. The sandwich chix ,jalapeno n caramelised onions was sad though the presentation was nice with crisp chatpata fries n lettuce bouquet which was useless without a dressing. It had loads of chix, no jalapeno, few carmlsd onions n lettuce. 
"Never put lettuce in a grilled sandwich!" ..thought of the day 🙂
Desserts on display where not exciting.
I want to come back here few more times till prices r low to get a better feel of the place.. 
Worth a visit, if u r in the neighbourhood..

Loved the ambiance. Properly maintained. They offer outdoor seating as well. This is the best time to visit this cafe and grab a seat outdoor, by the lane. Staffs were polite and courteous. Due to some reason today they were not serving any main course so we just had their fizzy ice tea (blueberry). Nothing special to mention about it. Prices are moderate.

Now here is one cafe that you should just "Drift" by and not "Drift" in. I had heard about this cafe from my friends and decided to give it a try... The first impression of the cafe was pretty candid and honestly the decor really uplifted my spirit as I thought that now here's a new place where I could hang around with friends. But alas!!!! Trust me the 1.0 u see is just for the decor... coz if you ask about the food and service it's in the negatives....
I went along with a friend and thus we ordered one Ferraro Rocher shake and one normal Cold Coffee with ice cream... firstly the cold coffee came without ice cream and I was explained that the ice cream has been blended in. Next the cold coffee was far off from anything but cold. When enquired on that they jus took the coffee back put in a dollop of half melted vanilla ice cream and got it back... kudos to service.
As far as the Ferraro Rocher shake is concerned it had literal chunks of Ferraro Rocher that hadn't been blended... Guys next time you might jus as well serve it on a platter rather than a glass coz honesty that shake is easier to gulp with a tablespoon rather than a pipe.
Now comes the food.. we ordered for fish fingers and egg devils. Firstly they get fish fries instead of fish fingers and had to be taken back again to make the change. Next up when finally the fish fingers did arrive it turned out to be completely salty.. Guys I get it you need to marinate in vinegar and all but not to the extent that rather than the taste of the fish all I get is the salty tanginess of vinegar.. As far as the devils are concerned they never turned up.. at about the half an hour mark we were told that the first platter of devils got burnt so they are making a fresh plate... Finally after waiting for 45 minutes we were forced to cancel the order... 
The icing in the cake for me was a visit to their washroom. I swear to god that I could have jus puked my stomach out but somehow I jus held on.. it was the dirtiest washroom I have ever been to with toilet tissues strewn all over the place. Like seriously guys have you heard of something called a cleaning roster...
So to sum it all Cafe Drifter I will surely keep drifting away from you guys...

Oh my my! Cafe Drifter has me genuinely confused.  Went here twice before writing this review. The place is a stone throw distance from cloakroom. The ambiance is quirky and there is a projector on the wall and a guitar which you can pick up on your whim.
The first time around we ordered
1. A Chicken Burger(Juicy?)-Not sure of the name. Moist patty,pretty standard burger
2. Chicken Lasagna- This was terrible. The cheese and the pasta was overcooked and got stuck to each other,there was no marinara sauce and it was borderline inedible. 

The owner is a high on energy person who introduced the cafe to us. When he asked us how we liked the food, i politely pointed out the lasagna issue. Not only did he refuse to charge us for the item(in spite of our repeated insistence), he also called out the chef and started having a friendly war of words with him. He seemed very sincere about maintaining standards of the place. But then he also passed some negative remarks about another eatery which is barely 100 metres away from this one. The entire scene was very unexpected but some desert cheered us up. The bill was 450/- without the lasagna added.  

I went again with another friend to eat desert another day. We ordered the Blueberry cheesecake(which is really great) and some chocolate desert which had white chocolate shavings on top but wasn't anything great. The bill was 300/-. This day the owner came in with a group of extremely loud people who disturbed everyone else present.The owner was very friendly and did an impromptu dance to prove a certain point. One person from the same group then started singing beautifully,leaving me genuinely confused. 

Summing up
I need to go a few times more to make up my mind about this place. 
Or not.

Just when you thought that Kolkata is filled with dull and rectangular shaped cafe, cafe drifter changes your perception. From the look of it, the place seems cramped, once you enter this awkwardly shaped cafe looks humongous.

The reason I am so obsessed with its shape is that it isn't square or rectangular or a shaped figure, it is tapered at some points and broadened at others. Kudos to the owner and the interior decorator to make the best out of this place.
Drifting to the menu, there is a lot to choose from. The traditional BLT is loaded with bacon and lettuce. The double decker sandwich is a non-vegan's delight. Coming to the vital and the best part, the ham pie; I haven't tasted such a dish before and it has to be in your bucket list whenever you visit this place. Well behaved staff and a fairly quiet environment.
As said in other reviews, the owner of this dainty place is fun to have around. Dressed in shorts and t-shirt, he lives in his own world but not eccentric and introverted for sure.

Had three different desserts from Cafe Drifter when they'd stall-ed in a musical event. Tiramisu, Strawberry and a Vanilla. The Tiramisu was completely edible including the package around it which was of chocolate. I liked it. :)The Strawberry dessert - Overly sweet. The Vanilla - Just about okay. Yet to visit their cafe. :)

Tucked away in the bylanes if purnadas road is this Little delight. The space is high on design and multi functional. You could strum away on the guitar , read a book or sit in on of them stools. ofCourse you could be like me and just go here to eat. Loved the KitKat shake though it's alMost a meal by itself. The chicken sandwich and the tiny bacon tarts were a hit around the table. The place reflects the energy and positivity of the owner and I wish him all the success.

After a light lunch, Anamitraa Chakraborty and I were exploring for a place for a good time of chatting over desserts.This place came to our notice in our quest of searching and we decided to drop by this place.

The café(or community space as said by the owner)was well lit in a soothing way,the sitting arrangements are cosy,there is a bookshelf too for reading over a cuppa and a space for working with laptop.The best part about the decor was a wall dedicated to showcasing talent of various photographers.The dessert spread looked so good that we got confused what to order.Finally we settled for pineapple & white chocolate,strawberry and white chocolate parfait and coffee,sweet cream,cherry in chocolate cup.All these desserts had cherry on top.

•Pinapple and white chocolate-It had white chocolate mousse with fresh pineapple in the base.It was a combination of so many flavours--- smooth creaminess of the mousse, texture given by white chocolate shavings on top and freshness of fruits beneath..this well thought out dessert had it all.

•Strawberry and white chocolate parfait-Here also the mousse was perfectly smooth,light,airy with touch of tanginess from thick strawberry compote.The white chocolate shavings added good texture to this creamy dessert.

•Coffee,sweet cream,cherry in a chocolate cup-The concept behind this dish is amazing! Who doesn't love coffee and cream? They played with this combination in a beautifully presented dish.The tempering of the chocolate was perfect.It was sturdy enough to hold the mousse filling within it but broke easily after being tapped with the spoon.The chocolate tasted perfect..neither overly sweet or too bitter.The mousse filling had a good strong flavour of coffee and being an ardent lover of coffee based desserts it was a delight for me.The sweet cream balanced out the bitterness of coffee very nicely.The dark chocolate shavings on top again was a good addition in terms of texture in this dish.

I was loving this café absolutely..service,ambience,staff behaviour,food.. everything was top notch.But in the end there was a glitch in our near perfect experience.It was caused by group of friends the owner came with..and the behaviour somewhat disturbed us. Deducted points for that only.
Otherwise it's a nice community space for spending quality time over good food.

A small, cozy sort of place where you can sit for hours (in theory, I don't know how it'll be when it's crowded). We went there mainly for desserts and particularly the Blueberry cheesecake. It wasn't on show but they told us they'd arrange it and we were served in 5 minutes while we sat on a two seater next to the side window railing which had a lot of quirky decorations, including a use-able guitar. The cheesecake was light and tasted of blueberries, which is more than what I can say for a lot of high flowing dessert places. We ordered a chocolate dessert next from the show case (don't remember the name, refer to picture) and it was a little dry, but warm and tasty nonetheless. The owner is enthusiastic and friendly and tried his best to make all his customers feel at home, so I guess that was a plus. All in all, a decent experience.

Located at the corner on the third left lane when you enter from ML Roys at Gariahat. Ambience is good - decored with all kinds of wall hangings, paintings, musical instruments for play. Ordered chicken soup, mutton cutlet and fresh lime with soda. Soup was good, but the taste of mutton cutlet was average. Didnt feel the taste of keema at all. Service is slow and the rates are bit high.

Cafe Drifter is one of those places that invites you to chill and relax. I like picking up a book off the shelves, order myself some mushroom cappuccino (which is a rather lovely soup) and read. They have a variety of musical instruments: an accordion, a guitar - pick one and make music. I like the artsy side of the cafe too, featuring murals, photographs, and paintings. Apart from the chicken and jalapeno sandwich, the ham and cheese pie, chicken fingers, and the extreme KitKat shake, I have a thing for their lamb ragout and their bacon salad. Service is slightly slow but bearable. One of those places which makes you happy.

Cafe Drifter - A new cafe in the city of joy. 
=====
Location & Intro:

This cafe was on my wish list since a long time. It is located if you head straight from fillers towards Zucca Lounge and after crossing the lounge and few buildings, there you locate cafe drifter. It is a new eatery in the city of joy. I had been to cafe drifter with a friend of mine to try out their offerings. This cafe is nicely made and have an outdoor seating area also. The projector screen is also there and they have tried to occupy as many people as possible by their seating arrangement. 

This cafe drifter has a chic ambiance catering to the people of kolkata. I finally grabbed my seat with a friend when we began to order a couple of few things. 
=====
What we ordered:

• Cola Float - I first ordered for sparkling cranberry and mango punch. It was unavailable and few other drinks too. The price of Cola Float was written Rs. 100 inclusive all taxes. On final bill, they charged us Rs. 140 saying that the price had increased and we forgot to mention or say you about it. I did not pay anything extra (Rs. 40) for that and it is extremely unprofessional attitude of asking customer extra money without mentioning it in the A la carte or making any modifications which are required. I seemed quite annoyed with this and that's when my experience was not as good as it should have been. The cola float was presented well. However, it was blended in the blender which in turn gave a subtle flavour of cola. Different. It was nice and not worth more than 100 bucks.

• Chicken Cutlet - It was not at all nice to my liking. Mixing Kashundi sauce with tomato ketchup to serve and mixing minced chicken (very less in quantity) in bread crumbs and making a thick coating was not to my liking. The portion of garam masala and additional spices added to the cutlet(in high amount) also took away it's charm and it was affecting the palate miserably. It was presented nicely and was crunchy but somewhere the chicken lacked real bad. 

• Chicken Sandwich with Fries - The chicken sandwich was nice. It was to my liking and the fries were crunchy. The chicken sandwich did have adequate chicken pieces and was nicely grilled. #musttry ✌ ❤
=====
Pros: 

• Staffs were courteous though the bill and the explanation of the staff did give me a shock. (Wrong charging without prior notice)
• Good ambiance
• Presentation of the dishes were excellent
• Service was fast 

Cons:

• Bad music
• Need more improvement with respect to enhancing the dishes
=====
Meal for two: 300 - 700 approximate
=====
Conclusion:

I personally feel they need to work on their service and enhancing the dishes. Overall, it was just an average experience. 
=====
Unbiased review based on my visiting experience.

This place has an interesting menu - although for some reason, despite requests on this forum, the Management was not uploading it on the site. Having heard a lot about it, we tried it out yesterday. Service was eager but low on skills (despite repeating ourselves, our soup order was incorrect and they voluntarily did not charge for it; it took a couple of trips to get our drinks order right). As far as the food was concerned, I had helpings of a ham, bacon, lettuce salad; a ham and cheese pie; a lamb burger with bacon topping; and a cinnamon nougat. Of the lot, I would repeat the salad; and avoid the pie, the thickness of whose shortcrust pastry shell we found overwhelming the taste of its contents. This cafe has potential - probably listening closely to its more more demanding customers will be a good idea to iron out the glitches. And by the way, the bill was a pleasant surprise!

Wow it feels like you are sitting beside a Spanish promenade - gentle breeze all around - shades & sunshine inter twined along the avenue - on a relaxed Sunday afternoon...

Experience & food were superb...freshly made, hygienic ambiance, well behaved steward...price point wise I would say comfortably priced.

Energy & enthusiasm of the owner was stunning - wish him all the very best...

Visited this place for some quick bites and just loved the ambiance. Lovely. The art wall concept is great. We ordered for a bacon, sausage and lettuce salad, which was really good. The Cheese Cake was great too. The Guava Jhatka was good, but tasted same as Paper Boat's Chilli Guava. Need to add something unique to ask 130 bucks for that. The prices on the menu are all inclusive. Service was friendly and quick. Planning to come back soon to taste more items.

When you enter Drifter you basically walk in to a super-cool, cozy cafe you always wanted to own. Guess what, the owner (Pablo)  makes you feel right at home and gives you the experience of what is like to run a cafe. Meeting Pablo adds to the experience of visiting Drifter. Really, do meet him!

Now, let's talk about the food. Among all the things I ordered, I loved every single one of them. As an avid burger lover, I must say Drifter certainly serves one of the best burgers in the city. Ham pie is something that is very exclusive and very yummy. The desserts are also crazy good! 

Verdict: Great food. Great ambiance. Amazing host. A cafe you must visit!

My reasons to have coffee are many, from personal time to business meetings. I look for a place that's conveniently located, nice ambience, free parking, great service folks, awesome coffee, delicious food, open air comfort. I find them all and you get to meet great soul in every cup of coffee. This is a place to drift to if you are nearby or otherwise, like myself. There's a surprise element in every corner at @cafedrifter

Good food, ambience and theme make cafe drifter a certain touchdown for the cafe lovers in kolkata. Located well in the south kolkata popular zone, this place offers a quiet, fun and welcome environment for enthusiasts of all kinds. Big thumbs up to Rajroop and Team for such a wonderful idea. Many wishes for the future.

The community cafe model is pretty new in the city and Kudos to this guy called Rajroop for initiating the same  in the city of Joy :) . 2 minutes walk from the Hindustan Park bus stop, located in a very convenient position, would amaze you with their charming, downtown European feeling as you drop down after a long walk in and around the bylanes of Gariahat. Suggested by a senior, we chose this place to check out their cheesecake & salads during a busy Sunday evening. The hospitality of the place is in the air for sure. They're a just one month old baby & are quite apologetic about their delays in orders or a little messup with your bills or orders, but what charms you through your experience is that , they're definitely not compromising on the quality of the same. Rajroop tries to interact with all the guests personally and absolutely open to feedback, which , definitely deserves a brownie point :) . So service & ambiance - 4.5/5. 

Food - We ordered a chicken Caesar salad which actually tasted like the authentic one & quite appalling to your taste buds . Undoubtedly, one of the best in the city in recent times. The variety in the menu was little less in terms of Tea, hence would request the team to impress tea lovers like me with a fair choice :) . 
Next was the caramelized onion, chicken & jalapeno grilled sandwich which was another winner. Not at all dry, the considerable amount of the filling between the breads were gooey & melting. 
Now my happiness came in the form of this beauty called blueberry cheesecake which has the capacity to overcome all your stress by just a look at it :D . Sinful, soft and spongy, leaves you longing for one more bite. Undoubtedly, 5/5.

So for the meal it was a good 590/-. Their prices are all inclusive. No extra burden of taxes. This one is definitely recommended. Would be coming back again for sure :).

Great food , chill ambience. Definitely one of the places you'd keep coming back to.

Recommended: the kit Kat chocolate shake, lamb patty burger and pork chop! The cooking is great so most of the things on the menu are recommended!

The cafe scene is changing fast in Kolkata and the latest addition to this is Cafe Drifter which I must say is not only a Cafe. It has an integrated gallery, workstation with free Wi-Fi, an event space which may host any kind of event large or small and a very interactive host. The food is good. But what attracts is the ambience which is very contemporary. There are musical instruments too which may be used by visitors. The open air space is a bit small but the location of the cafe makes up for all the little flaws. Overall a great experience. Would surely visit again

Calcutta has been fast catching up to the cafe culture and I make it a point to visit the newest most recommended places every time I visit from Delhi. This time, it had to be Cafe Drifter, and happy to report that I'll be going back whenever I am next in town. 

For one thing, this cafe has been created with a lot of passion and it shows in the food, service, ambience, et al. It's a small place, which adds to the coziness of the ambience. While they were serving a reduced menu during the busy days of durga puja, the food lived up to the good things I had heard. Tried the pasta, cheesecake and coffee, and while I do tend to be a food snob (especially when it comes to cheesecakes), I loved each of them and can't wait to try the extended menu. As for the decor, while the blue hued wall isn't as bright or cheery as could be... looking forward to the wall murals that we were told were coming! 

Special mention: loved the window seating, and of course, the free wifi never hurt anyone. Keep up the good work guys!

Cafe Drifter. Lives up to its name. A sudden dinner plan, introduced us to these amazing people. These few know what they want from life and probably has figured out a way to live it without any regrets. The food, scrumptious,amazing,marvellous. Words fall short for it. Like it has been stated, "no one is a stranger, if you know how to catch the drift." After a really long time, we came across some amazing, insane and completely awesome people. We need more such places in our city. A dinner well spent.

Spotted this cafe by chance... situated in a 2 mins walk distance from the Hindustan park bus stop this is a small cafe which opened up nearly a month ago. Given its new born status in the upcoming cafe circles... i ddnt find anything which might cause it to stand tall amongst the many others off the sort... its cozy and the decor is simple and decent. The waiting staff is extremely polite but a bit un-attentive. The food n drinks we ordered we good. They serve an array of sandwiches, burgers, entrees and desserts. The best part the prices mentioned in the menu card are inclusive of taxes.

A unique one-for-all cafe be it a date, laptop work needing Wi-Fi, interviews, shoots or simply if you're hungry and happen to be near Southern Avenue, Drifter is the place. 
With eye-catching decor and a one-of-a-kind ambience, time will fly by when you visit here. Coming to the food, the Fish n chips and Chicken Jalapeno sandwich are a must try, not to mention their trademark Kitkat shake which is just mind-blowing. Lastly, good service coupled with an enthusiastic & entertaining host makes Drifter a one-stop destination for all age groups.

I had my eyes on this place even before it was open, and finally I managed to peep in for a late lunch on Navami. A beautiful and warm place to be. Very subtle decor with chalk graffiti, photo collage, decorative pieces, along with very comfortable seating arrangements.

Coming to the service. The waiters were polite. The customised pujo menu was handed over to me, which had half of the signature items missing. I wanted to have the extravagant kitkat shake, however the waiter informed me that it is not being served during the pujo days, and I'll have to choose from the limited pujo menu. I am very well aware that this shake was served to a friend of mine just a day before, i.e. on Ashtami. I don't see any good reason to distinguish between customers. If you are not serving an item at all, that's acceptable, but this is not. Also, the waiters need to be a bit more confident, IMO.

I ordered Escalope of Lamb Ragout with Parsley Butter Rice and assorted veggies. It was delicious. The lamb was well cooked. The jus was tempting. The rice was perfectly al dente and the flavours were perfectly in place.

I ended my lunch with Berry Cheesecake. It was different. It was very soft and spongy. Taste wise it was wonderful. Surprisingly, the biscuity base was soft and did not feel flacky in the mouth, as it happens in most cheesecakes. Just a suggestion, try to chuck out the base completely and prepare it in a mini Mason jars, fusing some fresh bits of berries into it. I believe it will taste grand.

I would have given a 5 for the food, decor, and ambience, however the kitkat shake incident is not acceptable. A 4 as of now.

P.S.: Please upload the menu on Zomato.

Great to see a quality cafe spring up in Kolkata. Drifter has a nice, quaint feel to it as you enter. The staff is extremely courteous. Ordered the lamb burger with bacon. Good quality as well a generous portion. Pablo the owner is a great host and took our reviews rather intently. The place is sensibly priced and totally worth a visit. The sitting area outside is also very relaxed and homely. Would visit again.

The best salad i have tasted. Somehow the ability of a modest eatery to make a well seasoned salad is something that I deem to be very impressive. The extreme kitkat and chocopie shake will definitely bring out your inner child and there are some delicious burgers to choose from and dont forget to add the extra fried egg and bacon. The place has a taste for good music and the vibe is simply chill. Do drop by, for a very happy experience

"Let it all go, see what stays"- Drifter
This is a newly opened cafe , near Vivekananda Park. A comfort place with unique decor, this cafe is really a place to unwind. I ordered a Ham and Cheese Pie and Guava jhatka. The pie was beautifully presented and was indeed delicious and fresh. The Guava Jhatka had the perfect tang that I was looking for. 
What needs special mention is the Host and owner Pablo, who makes the experience in the cafe, all the more special.
I am going back soon.....!!

Nowadays our city is getting new cafe and small eatery everyday, here another addition to the Cafe family called "Drifter".

●Well if you're coming from Zucca lounge towards rashbehari connector, this cafe will be in your right side beneath some Handloom cottage.

●Inner deco and ambiance is nice and very soothing. There is a open air seating arrangements also.

●I was there at nearly 4 pm of today. Ordered Extreme Kitkat Shake, which was presented flawlessly. It has 2 full kitkat, one Ferrero Rocher and a small cupcake. But all of these cannot make a tastier shake because of the bland taste. I was very disappointed after having a single sip.

●Ordered Bacon Salad, it was very good. Loved it.

●Service needs some improvement. Server's hands are shaking while serving shakes. He need confidence . Anyways hopefully it will be okay within couple of months.
Management behavior is very nice.

The newest of the many Cafe's that have come up in the region.It is on the main near Vivekananda Park.It is not a big place but the interior is pretty nicely done.We visited this on a Saturday and unfortunately the Café had hit some problem and were unable to serve food so we could only order coffee and pastries.The options on the menu were pretty standard comprising of Lasagne,Sandwiches and burgers.Also available,on the menu was Cutlet mentioned as 'KOLKATA ISSTYLE' but unfortunately cant comment on the quality of food as couldnot order them due to the issue.A special mention for the owner though who was very nice and personally engaging with all his customers and apologising for the inconvenience.
