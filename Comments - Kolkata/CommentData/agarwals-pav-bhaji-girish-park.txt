This evening I visited this place after reading positive reviews from my fellow foodies in zomato. It is a nice experience indeed. Their pav vaji is yummy. I liked it.
Smart service and friendly behaviour. All you will get in a very cheap rate.
Only negetive point is that being a street food joint there is no proper sitting arrangement and the place is crowdy, hygiene is bit compromised.

Another street food delight in the City of Joy, Agarwals's Pav Bhaji is probably the best pav bhaji available In Kolkata. Located near Ram mandir , this place is not for typical hygienists. Their service is super fast and the taste of Pav bhaji is lip smacking.

It is located in mukhtaram babu st. Near mahajati sadan/ M G road metro station. Regular pav bhaji cost 40 bucks. Food quality is average but as a street food it is awesome. Pav bhaji lovers must come in this place.

This is my favourite goto place for street food around my CFA tuition in that neighbourhood. This is a roadside stall tucked away in a lane near Ram Mandir. Can be easily from either Girish Park Metro Station or MG Road Metro Station. 

Tried the normal Pav Bhajis several time and still haven't gone bored. The price is pretty cheap too. There is always people around their stall which proves how great their sales are despite the small size of it.

This has become an iconic place for Street food lovers. The best paw bhaji available in the town are from these guys. Its cheap and hygenicic, in a lane full of options this has to be the leader among all.
Bhaji is available semi prepared as generally for all road side vendors and is given the final touch as per needs in front of you.
You will always find chaos in the the seating, hoped it had more seating and someone open seating as well

I said, i didn't know lets hv it thn n after hving it i ws quiet surprised...tht it tastes so good n differrnt from other pav bhaji places it ws just awsome also it ws light on the pocket so frm tht day evry day whnevr i used to go over there n had the time i hv pav bhaji from this place

N to my all veg. & non veg. Friends who r staying in kolkata or outside of kolkata u may already know this place if u dnt pls come n hv it once, n i promise u you guys will forget all the pav bhajis u ever tasted .....

I came across this place while searching for quality Street food stations on Zomato. Its a short walk away from the Girish Park Metro Station. 

The ambiance is pretty ordinary, a long stool is what the customers sit on and there's no table, but it's okay for a street food outlet. 

We had one normal, and one special Pav Bhaji, priced Rs. 30 and Rs. 90 respectively. The normal one was decent, but the special Pav Bhaji is a complete rip-off!  It's just a normal one with a few pieces of Cashew thrown in. We were sorely disappointed about this deception. Please have only the normal ones, if you happen to go there. 

Apart from this hiccup, it's a decent place to eat if you're low on budget or want to experience Kolkata's Street food scenario.

The most outstanding paw bhaji you can probably find in the entire city. Strategically located near Ram Mandir just off the main road, this place is sure to satisfy even the most stringent food critic in town. Their speciality: the fresh bun with buring hot bhaji and the authentic semi roasted onions. Another outlet is right outside Vardaan Market in Camac Street if you feel lazy to come down this far to savour the taste of mind blowing paw bhaji.

Hunger usually takes me to various different eateries. But when it took me to this small Paw Bhaji shop just opposite to Bachawat's Coaching centre, I was left with a full stomach and a wonderful aftertaste in my mouth. It was a Sunday, and I had gone with my girlfriend to Bachawat to talk about her CS admission. So, while leaving, I saw this shop just opposite to centre. Now I am not someone who loves paw bhaji that much, but the paw bhaji here changed my mind completely. I even tool some extra bhaji and an extra paw, because it tasted so good, and I was extremely hungry. With a little financial investment, this place can become a well known paw bhaji outlet on MG Road

Ram Mandir is one of those places almost every CA student, including me has visited at least once in their lives for classes. It was during the initial days that we stumbled upon Agarwal's. While the entire lane is lined up with stalls offering lip-smacking food, you will find stiff competition between Agarwal's and Gupta's in terms of pav bhaaji, the former being the clear winner. Their pavs are soft and moist while the bhaaji has that perfect spice in it. A must-visit place for all pav bhaaji lovers.

Well I am not a Pao Bhaji fan but the aromatic utterly butterly delicious Bhaji never fails to draw my attention. A place which is always crowded with students and nearby residents, this is the place to be when you're looking for an evening snack or a late brunch. Accompany it with a coke and you have an amazing meal in front of you.
It's more of a food stall than a restaurant, but nevertheless the foodgasmic Bhaji makes up for it. :D
The Special Pau Bhaji is royally composed of cashews and nuts. If you come here, don't forget to order a special pau Bhaji.

'Simply lip-smacking' are the first words that comes to mind. This is the only place to satisfy pao bhaji cravings. Definitely one of those places would like to recommend to everyone. Soft drinks to compliment with your pao bhaji are also made available on demand. It's located in the lane next to Ram mandir; nearest metro station being MG Rd. A must visit for everyone!

Although paw bhaji is excellent but the ambience is bit sidey. A roadside pawbhaji joint which I have been having there since the past 15 years or more. Nothing has changed neither the flavor of food nor the ambience. If they can do something about the place may be more people can come and taste one of the best paw bhaji in Kolkata

'Simply lip-smacking' are the first words that comes to mind. This is the only place to satisfy pao bhaji cravings. Definitely one of those places would like to recommend to everyone. Soft drinks to compliment with your pao bhaji are also made available on demand. It's located in the lane next to Ram mandir; nearest metro station being MG Rd. A must visit for everyone!

The Name which came in mind first whenever I wish to Eat #PavBhaji. I bet, once you'll try it... you'll alwys have it whenever you will get a chance to have it. In its affordable price, everyone can afford it and the best thing is
"Jo maza in galiyon ke road side fooding me he... wo AC ke restaurent se kahin alag he"

Location is colloquially called "Ram Mandir Gali". U find loads of street food walas in the " gali". 
Centum for this outlet. Been here lot number of times. Agarwal ji ke hatho me jaadu hai, to say the least.
Reasonable, pocket-friendly pricing. Delicious, gourmet stuffs. The service and taste is just bang on. NO ONE CAN EAT JUST ONCE. I bet u will come back for several more finger-licking experiences.

Adjacent to Agarwal's a Chinese food stall is established (not actually estb., jus yet another stall) catering to ur hunger. Ate my first ever Manchurian Noodles there and it's the best I've ever had. Try once.

This is one of the roadside eateries that should not be given a miss. As a matter of fact the entire stretch serves up some really amazing stuff. You have Manchurian rolls in the adjacent stall served to amazing chai in the opposite eatery. Coming to Agarwal's, perfectly soft buns, bhaji is a little spicey and well cooked not like the yellow ones that look like well, you get the idea. And the best part is the onions that they serve along separately. Perfect blend of spices, chilli, lemon juice, spring onions and onions this is one hell of an amazing accompaniment to the main course.

**Location = The street is officially called Muktaram Babu Street. I call it Ram Mandir Gali. This whole authentic North Kolkatan Street is packed in the evening with superb juicy vegetarian food stalls. Another nearest landmark is the MG Road Metro station(7-8 minutes walking distance)¬†

**Brief = Have been there several times with my friend who lives at Amherst Street. He introduced me to this mindblowing roadside stall serving hot and spicy pav bhajis :D

**Ambiance = They have lots of old tools and benches. No special decorations, just a stall with huge capacity to serve everyone :D

**Things ordered = "Pav Bhaji", just order and count how many times you ask them to refill your plate. Mine never ends before 5-6 times of refilling. It tastes marvellous and its the best Pav bhaji I have had in Kolkata.

**Recommended = Try their cheese pav bhaji, its the best. Also if you are still hungry for more, there's a small stall beside this Agarwal's and they serve Veg rolls with "soyabean chunks" filling inside. I would suggest everyone to try it once, its worth remembering :D

**Purse Check = Its very cheap and pocket friendly. Rs.200/- is more than enough for 2 people :)

**Overall = Agarwal's are the best Pav Bhaji wala's in the town. Keep making such awesome food guys.

Cheers :)

awesommmeeee place...being an ardent non vegetarian...i love this joint for the best pav bhaji u get here...very close ram mandir and near to m.g road metro this joint serves some finger licking good pav bhaji...there is a whole lane where street food is sold..

agarwal's is one of the favourite after a friend of us took us there..they serve pav bhaji's only but the pav and the dal tarkari given with it is awesomely tasty..and melts in ur mouth..i love yahan ka khana..

with their food their cordial behaviour and hospitality is great..they serve in clean dishes and one of the best street food joints in kolkata..very pocket friendly and great for students like me..!:)

A street food which should be taken international and i m sure it would become a super hit in places where indians throng. Located in a bylane near ram mandir it is easily the best paw bhaji in town. The perfect blend of the spices and vegetables provide a taste which lives well after the dish has been partaken. A street food experience which is a must.

Agarwal's - People specially student's who go to bachawat's ( even me) recognise this stall. The whole of the lane is food lane upto certain extent. 
--------
Brief:

It is nothing but a small stall which can teach a lot of food places/restaurants/kiosks/hubs on to learn the hospitality. Students often come here to eat and go. They are pretty fast in providing the Pav bhaji in less of time. The staffs are friendly too and they are pretty organised in their approach. Arranged seats of wood, serve in proper plates with proper masala onion and a little lemon tingy bhaji served with butter toasted bread. 
--------
Food:

However, they lack in variety. They only sell pav bhaji and earn good revenue from it. I am a very big fan of their pav bhaji and their way of servings. :) 
--------
Summary

Quantity 4/5
Quality 4/5
Value for money 4.5/5
Varieties 2/5
Hospitality 4/5
--------
Conclusion: 

A good kiosk to visit when you are searching for somewhere fast to eat. :)

Located near ram mandir on c.r.avenue, agarwal the paw bhaji people are pretty old with another branch located on camac street. It is surprising to see only a single review for this outlet.

The outlet is roadside and one has to sit on the long wooden tables or stand to have the food. I am not so fond of eating it that way generally but having the paw bhaji live here is a whole different experience than having it via a takeaway. The bread are soaked with butter and gravy of the bhaji. The bhajis are very well made. The special paw bhaji with dry fruits in them sell like crazy but i find the plain simple bhaji better. The onions with spices and lots of lemon, papads are served by the side. Bhajis are available without onion, garlic as well. Prices are decent, reasonable.

Overall one of the best paw bhajis in the city but would prefer mayaram over these people coz of the seating comfort that enables me to enjoy the food more.
