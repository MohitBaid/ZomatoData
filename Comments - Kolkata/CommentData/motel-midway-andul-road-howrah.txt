My first impression... Way below ordinary.
Its the only food outlet in the neighborhood.
Ambience - very ordinary.
Taste - horrible.
Service - needs some drastic improvement..
Cost - as per standards. Many might fund it overpriced based on the neighborhood.
My recommendations: avoid this place.

Food was good especially the paneer based items like paneer kabaab anf kofta. Though yellow dal was not upto the mark, they had added spring onions which was not blending well.
The ambience is a put off as it does not have the dhaba feel neither does it have the posh restaurant feel.
The service was excellent.  They were very polite and courteous. Even helpful and kept getting us chutney and other condiments when ever required.

Not so good now  their food is worst now 
The tandoori was so bad you can hit a car with it and be sure the windshield will break their best preparation is lasooni kabab and mutton bhuna but 2nd time bhuna was really salt less. And there golden fried prawn was just like some prawn tossed with onion 
'tasteless'

I like this place. Not only due to its food, but the location. Its really convenient for people who are travelling over NH6 and want to dine someplace good. Everytime on our way to digha/mandarmoni we eat here. Food is pretty average, nothing extraordinary. Ambiance may not be that good at all times considering its bang on top of a highway. I found the service good. They have also renovated the interiors now giving it a much better look. This place is ideal when you want to take someone for a long drive dinner! Looking forward for my next visit...
