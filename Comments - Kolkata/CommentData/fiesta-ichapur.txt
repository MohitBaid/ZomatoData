Probably the only decent bar close to my house. I have tried few cocktails of here and they were great. Specially the orange rosemary vodka martini. Starters items were good. Fish fingers and tandoori chicken was delicious. Also tried veg fried rice and chicken items, which were tasty. Ambience is cool.

Location - notun rasta
Food- we ordered
Chicken Biriyani- Not good in taste.. It was little salty i felt.. Didn't like it
Mixed Noodles - The prawns were undercooked and foul smell was coming from them so its the worst.
Egg Chicken Noodles - Saved the day.
Pocket pinch - costly compared to the quality of the food..
If u wanna have a good drink then u can go otherwise not recommended

Yesterday I have ordered Mutton Handi and Butter Nun and asked them for packing..... Butter Nun was good but Mutton Handi was not.... In the menu card they have mentioned that there are four ps of Mutton but I have got only three....Not only this,  Mutton ps were also not ok.......I am a regular customer but this time my experience is very bad......

a very moderate and cosy bar indeed.the place is less but the decoration is good at all.service is fast and also the food is palatable .it has a good facility of parking and also as it is just beside the high road that is why it is very easily accessible.

This place is actually good. Food is not upto mark but okayish. Cocktails are great though most of the time they run out of various beers. Ambiance is nice.

The first experiance which i had with the staffs that is in phone they dont know how to speak with the guest, i have some querries regarding a "smoking zone" they r having or not but i got dissapointed coz the person who picked up the phone dont have any knowladge of the place where he is working i also enquire for "happy hours" thats again a quite unknown thing for him so finally he had given the phone to his senior so again i asked "if there any smoking zone in your restaurant or not" now i got a answer, the answer was a wow "U have to take non family zone" ohh  amazing i just asked them.for smoking zone   what was that i never been there  and i clearly mentioned that to them and all this conversation is happening in pure bengali and finally the senior person whom i m talking he said "anything else BOSS"?? Wow again i m a boss now...!!!

But anyhow i visited the place not minding the above,
I ordered for "sex on the beach" but how they make it when asked the waiter says "i use to be in the family" i dont know anything well when i asked for the bartender the waiter either not infofming the bartender to  come to mee or the bartender is avoiding mee.

Sex on the beach garnish is watermelon scoops.....!! Funny 
And the bartender had shaken sex in the beach coz the froth is clearly visible and the juices are soo much that the balance was not there at all in the drink and when asked to make it perfect the waiter asked me to take another large and he will mix it and the balance will get ferfect but after mixing the taste and the balance was Pathetic....!!

And they r charging tax in Cocktails where its been clearly declaired that no GST or anr TAX in Alcohols...!!

Shit place ever experianced

Visited this place last night.  It's a new restraunt near BELEPOLE NOTUN RASTA. 
Nice decoration overall this place,food is good and quantity is sufficient. 
Ground floor is for family purpose and 1st floor for bachelors and friends hangout.  

Price is quite cheap not only PRICE, THERE STAFFS BEHAVIOUR ALSO VERY CHEAP. 

1. We arrived that place near about 8:20,ordered one starter, 2main courses and one 60ml teachers which is on the rocks.  For them, on the rocks means the glass is full of ice cubes. Lol xD

2. They have served us only drink, not with complementary snacks(called CHAKNA) 

3. We are waiting for a long time like it's 9:20. When i have to again called them and tell them that if our menu is not ready still now then please gave us a bill,because it's too long and we don't want to waste our time.  
4. Staff gave me a look like he is the owner or CEO of this place and they called a bouncer on our table other than my food.  The bouncer came a huge body with a tiny brain.  ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

Guys please learn first, how to business and behave with your customer.  Otherwise your business will go down like how TITANIC SHIP GO DOWN UNDER WATER. 

Learn first the BASIC DIFFERENCE IN BETWEEN "BAR CUM RESTRAUNT"  &  "BAR, PUB" 

Why you guys need any BOUNCER? Just because you want to warn in advance everyone that you have bouncer?
Come'on grow up guys.  You don't know everyone's power or source of someone. 

So don't copy from any high clubs and restaurants.  Just learn first which one is need for what reason and then make your place beautiful.

Its also near to my place but somehow I didn't found the food to be tasty. Either the chicken is tough to taste it or they mess it up with the preparation. The interior is nice & clean compared to other Howrah restaurants & pubs. Alcohol is average regarding to price. But the food is a real villain for Fiesta. Hope you people will improve with time.

Why no menu card!!!!!

A good restaurant which we are in real crisis at Howrah. Good take away service. And very nice location.
I suggest to make a separate bar and family dine so that more people can join.

Located just opposite to the Dumurjala Stadium beside the adams electronics, this restaurant is like a breathe of fresh air for all the Howrah folks who were craving for a good restaurant since like forever. This place is at a stone throw distance from my house and this is going to be my go to restaurant from now on. There is a bar as well so no problem for the drinkers as well. Anyway, I did not visit the restaurant but brought food from their take away counter. My order was for Pan Fried Chicken, Schezwan Chicken and Veg Fried Rice. 
The Pan Fried Chicken was awesome. It was very tasty. Batter fried chicken tossed in a tasty sauce with bell peppers and onions. This dish made the perfect starter for yesterday lunch. 
The Schezwan Chicken was hot and spicy. Just the way a schezwan should be. So anyone who doesn't like spicy food shouldn't order this one. The tasty was amazing. 
Veg Fried Rice was good too. The quantity is huge and perfect for two people with medium appetite. The rice had a beautiful taste and also had ample quantity of vegetables in it. 
A special mention is that all their staffs are very polite and well behaved. The person in charge of the take away counter as well as the person who took my order was very well spoken. The person in charge informed me of their free home delivery on a minimum order of rs. 250 said since I live so near they can deliver my order within minutes. A good news for me ðŸ˜‹
And also when I informed them about the number that is given in zomato is wrong as it lacks another 0 after the last 0, they promised me to look into the matter and correct it as soon as possible. 
So I had an amazing experience yesterday and one day I am definitely going to visit the restaurant and not just take away my food from their take away counter. 
Happy Fooding â™¥

I have been to this bar a few times before. Nothing special. An average bar. Food is okay. Ambience is average. But the attitude of the employees , specially the manager is pathetic to say the least. They are in some colonial hangover of sorts. Last time they had asked me not to enter the premises wearing shorts. And no i am not talking about the homely ones. A proper short. The type of which I have worn to various high end pubs in Kolkata, and never even been frowned upon. Even that was okay. But the level of humiliation I faced yesterday, i e 4th August, 2017 was beyond pathetic. On visiting at around 7, they directed the two of us away from the "Family" section in the ground floor, to a separate space for stags at the 1st floor. But that wasn't even ready. Construction was being done and some tables were placed in one side. On refusing to seat there, the manager directed us to a seat in the ground floor itself but was making a face while doing so. On asking him if there was a problem, he said very rudely to my face, "this is family section boss", in the worst way possible. On pointing out his lack of courtesy, he spoke more rudely and showed us the door. One thing to mention is that, there were already men seating in that area. The only difference being, they were dressed in formals and us in casuals. I would have understood if there was any dress code mentioned. But there wasn't. The manager was the worst one I ever experienced. I am never visiting the place ever again.

Went to have some alcohol there. The ambiance is not that good. The price of beverage is reasonable and affordable. The foods tastes good, i ordered Chicken manchurian and Mixed rice. The quantity was sufficient for what they charge!

The newest addition to the array of restaurants near the Kona Expressway. Went back again and again to this place for their Chicken Manchurian Rice. And also the rest of the dishes are very good. Had a complete Indian lunch one day and wasn't disappointed a bit. If they don't mess up anything, could well be one of the best restaurants of Howrah.
