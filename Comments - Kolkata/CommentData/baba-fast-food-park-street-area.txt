When bad food and poor hygiene decided to have a baby the outcome was 'Baba Fast Food'. 

The little shop is located in Mirza Ghalib Street and it is basically a take away counter. There are some tools outside where crows and street dogs frequent all the time. 

I went to this shabby shop at 2.30 pm yesterday to have a quick lunch. I went for  egg chowmein and half chilli chicken.  They used four chicken meatballs tosesd it with onion and capsicum, used tomato and chilli sauce and prepared the chilli chicken. I was dumbfounded by the whole process. Nevertheless, I wanted to eat and decide how it was. 

The egg chowmein was okayish. It was very oily. The dry chilli chicken was a disaster. The meatballs were filled with flour. It was horrible. I never waste food and I take pride in that. For the first time, I threw away the food. I will never visit this shop again.

Baba Fast Food is a street side eatery located at Park Street which serves quick bites at an affordable price.

Ambience is shabby.

Service is quick with nice staffs.

Tried Egg Chicken Roll, which was decent and tasty with nice fillings , at a low price.

Baba Fast Food is a small outlet serving mainly Rolls of all possible kind. They also make Chicken Kebab, which they sell for very small price. I tried out their Chicken Kebab, small pieces of Kebab for Rs.120 for 4 sticks. More then enough for one person.
Although taste was average. Still price is cheap on the other side.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION:Â 
With so many big names in park street there are some small food joints present too where we can get some quality food with some very affordable prices. Â This small fast food shop falls at park street just beside On Track resto. Serves you with some well known chinese items and indian items.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE:Â 
Its a very small shop just two chairs for your sitting inside. The walls and looks are horrible. Generally its better for a take away. Service is fast and prompt.

FOOD:
It was my lunch so i have to go for something which fills my tummy. As my firm is a Marwari so had to go with Veg fried rice yet again. The rice was ready when i ordered, i think they just made it. I took it in office. The rice looked fine.. Taste was decent enough but average yet eatable.

QNQ AND PRICES:
Quality is good and quantity is enough for one person. Prices are very cheap.

CONCLUSION:
Another one down at the Park street. Have to continue more with time. Updates are on.

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

This is a cheapest food corner in park street. Food quality is good. You can try it for evening snacks, value for money !!! Fried rice and chicken rolls are really good.
