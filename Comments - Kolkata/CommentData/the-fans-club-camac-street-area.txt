I saw this on zomato and just then i decided that i have to try this place so went there for my friend's birthday treat..
Location- just behind the westside building.. In front of pizza hut camac street branch.
Ambience- if u wanna spend a great party time with ur friends u can go there.. There are loud music, comfortable couches , Nice and helpful staff.. So for me it was a good experience..
Food- we ordered
# Paneer sizzler- it was served woth noodles and rice both and Paneer.. I didn't like it.. Paneer were hard and the sauce was too salty.. Not recommended.
Pizza Pie- Wow what a pizza. Loved every bite of it.. There were no topping on outside. It was inside.. Super cheesy and creamy.. Great taste.. Highly recommended..
Pocket Pinch- I felt food is too expensive compared to its quantity and taste.
Verdict - You can go and try the place obviously but i will not go for second time..

Being a complete non-vegetarian it‚Äôs kind of difficult to adjust in a vegetarian restaurant...however the food quality is good. It‚Äôs located very close to Vardhan Market and that‚Äôs a prime location. The ambience, the food, the behaviour of the staff was friendly.

If you're planning a b'day party or something to make your day special, The Fan's Club is the right place. 

The food, the service and everything was perfect. Thanks to the staff for such a wonderful service. Had a very good time. They made my day memorable. I'm looking forward to more occasions where I can make more memories here. 

Without thinking twice, just go for this place üíò

The location of this outlet is good and easy to find.
Starting off with the ambiance. The decor is dim and well decorated. The space is huge and comfortable.
The food was pretty good though I did not like the shakes. We ordered a kit Kat shake and a butterscotch shake. The kit Kat shake was horrible but the butterscotch shake was really nice. The jalapeno poppers were good. Though I did not like the Mexican platter. The working staff were courteous and helpful. Overall a nice place but a few things should be improved ASAP.

The Fans Club is a Hookah Bar serving Vegetarian Food right above Jalepenos Restaurant in Camac Street. We visited this place on 31st Dec evening and here is my review of the items we ordered:                    1.Hookah with Kiwi and Rum Flavour: Their hookah is ok types. We has to order a hookah the second time as the first time water entered the hookah plate and frankly their rates are over rated as their staff was reluctant to replace our hookah and even on the second time you can change the Charcoal only once as post that it is not allowed.                                           2.Virgin Mojito,Crispy Chilli Baby corn,  Corn Cheese Balls, Chinese Sizzler and Pizza: Their finger food was absolutely average and the quantity was very basic and does not go with their price.                            The Music playing was OK with  Punjabi Rap Videos being played continiously. Their staff needs to be a more polite towards their customers as the taste, quantity of their food does not match up with their prices considering there are better places to eat out in Camac Street and Hookah Rates are high considering they lack that punch as there are better places serving Hookah and Better Variety of Finger Food!!

Absolutely pathetic food quality. The manager is too rude to accept the fact. They recommended me to take a kabab platter which I had ordered but the quality was really bad. One tasted as if it was made aeons ago and one was over-fried. Never try the chocolate milkshake because it has no chocolate. They just added Hershey‚Äôs syrup to milk and served it with a kitkat, naming it kitkat shake.

They serve the paneer Tikka in the cutest possible cart and that's the highlight of this place! üòç The Mac-n-cheese is literally death by cheese! The staff is extremely friendly! The hookah is nice but once you get the coal changed it kind of starts choking immediately and it's not good any more and despite innumerable requests they refuse to make any changes. The cheese pasta is good and so are the steamed momos and the garlic pizza bread is really nice. The Mongolian noodles was a tad too spicy. Overall, it's a nice place. We had the cutest possible host, I forgot her name, nbut thank you so much for being so nice and warm! :)

Visited on a saturday evening to get some hookah. Ordered one continental sizzler as well to go with the sheesha. The service was a disaster and so was the hookah. There was no flavour and we have to get it changed. Even the replaced hookah was absolutely rubbish. The sizzler though was not bad.

Sports, music, ambiance all at one place is tough to find.
So we found this fan's club which we loved and would surely come here again and again.
First let's talk about the best which is service, they are damn good in this department. No complaints.
Food is reasonable and will not affect your pockets.
They do not compromise with both quality and quantity.
For fun you can even play board games.

I would have rated this 4.5 but to me servuce is the key parameter towards rating any food or hookah joint. They place has a nice vibe and the interiors are quite neat. For a hookah joint the sheesha was below average. I had informed the staff about the problem with our sheesha but he seemed to have a reluctance about the problem. Poor service! Can't treat your customers with that kinda attitude. Rest was right on the money, the beverages and board games were quite good.

The place had poor lighting. The ambience was not great. It was too noisy. The hookah served had a cold coal and the order for hookah took so long. The service was also very poor. We had to wait for a long time to give the order and again the food was served late. The food portions are little. The lemonade was too sour. The food was also cold. They did serve a complimentary desert, a dry cold doughnut. I will never visit this place ever again!

An amazing hospitality. Staff and chef are very well trained and know their work properly. Good place to chill and have fun with friends and family as well.  Mexican sizzler is very good . One should try hazelnut shake.

Ambience wise, this place hits the sweet spot. Comfy seating areas, peppy music, quirky decor and a cosy, laidback atmosphere. It's the kind of place where you and your friends can put your feet up and chat for hours. I have been here twice with my best friend, mostly to catch up, but we also sampled a few eats. They do a decent paneer tikka, with plenty of bite and crisp bell peppers. Pretty filling as an appetiser. I also tried their American chopsuey. Quantity wise it was enough for two, but it tasted pretty bland to me. Too much sauce and underdone veggies. Also tried their peach iced tea and found it too sweet. It's a vegetarian joint with fairly unimpressive cooking, so I'm unlikely to visit too often in any case, but I definitely score it high on ambience if not on food.

Superb ambience, good thing is that they have a private section for non hookah goers and for family gathering. Also good to get clicked with your fam-jam.

Service was above average, staffs were cooperative.

Since it was kid's birthday party, we had Chinese, Italian and North Indian, which were all good.
Good food along with such quantity serving was value for money.

And one particular thing I want to tell the management that pls fix ur sofas or replace it with a new one. Bcoz were we hv seated dat sofa was teared and one can easily take the sponge out.We go to cafes for comfort not to seat in dat type of sofas.When u charged us then u should think Wat u r giving to ur customers in return.

The ambiance was nice. But the service and the food was really bad. Completely spoiled my day. We ordered crispy chilli babycorn, KitKat shake, Rajasthani Dum rice and Shahi Paneer. Shahi Paneer had a white sauce which was sweet and we specifically told the waiter we don't want anything sweet. Even the Rajasthani Dum rice was sweet. They took half an hour to give us the bill and they had billed our order wrong as well. The service was very slow and the waiters very not that well mannered. It was a pretty bad experience.

We settled for hookah and crispy chilli babycorn. But as we started talking more about the food served here, two of my friend brought up the option of cheese broccoli momos. And how could I say no to momo! I was all set to criticize it being a true momo lover by heart but as I popped one piece into my mouth, the delicately carved divine shell burst inside with hot cheese dancing in my mouth. It was delicious. I savored each piece and I am definitely going to visit again for momos and board games with my buddies.
P. S. The crispy chilli babycorn was good to taste. But the momos definitely did blow my mind to a whole new level of satisfaction.

Even though the place is well located but its a little difficult to find. Its beside Saturday Club. The ambience and food is great. I visited the place on an Independent Day's eve. It was well decorated and perfectly decked up for the mood of the day. The best part it provides on table mobile charging. I ordered for baby corn and sizzlers . The taste is good and also easy on your pocket.
The only complain I had from the place was its accommodation. We had to wait for quite sometime to get a table. But the wait was worth it. People out there you can give this place a try to visit with friends or family.

Located on d first floor where jalapenos is. Mainly a hookah parlour so I guess I shouldn't have tried this place since I was in no mood for hookah. Tried their vegetable barbeque pizza which was average. Didn't like d sauce they used on d pizza. Shchezwan noodles was nothing but red chillies. It had no taste of its own, the taste was just of red chilli powder. It was inedible. My friend had ordered a shake the name of which I can't recall but it was quite good. Also the mojito was nice. Music was average could have been better. Staff was ignorant. We had to wait for a minimum of 15 minutes before d staff finally heard us. But the place was reasonable. I might go agn but this tym only if I would want hookah.

Starting with food. Lip smacking. Slow serve. But tasty indeed. We ordered crispy chilli baby corn, Alfredo pasta and lasagna. Lasagna was lovely.
The interiors are extremely impressive. Amazing pun, and humorous quotes adorn the wall. Very different and cool, per say. The live music screening is good.
Unprofessional: one word for the staff. They're slow and casual and often terse with speech, something that professional courtesy wouldn't allow. Something that I noticed with patrons on nearby tables as well. Except for staff, I think I really would've given 4 maybe.

The place is very overrated by Zomato.But I seriously don't like this place at all.Nothing is good except the wall of fame.I truly admired that part of the cafe. Servicing is very poor.They take nearly 45 minutes to prepare pasta.The sitting arrangements are also very poor for visiting in large groups.You have to then sit in a restaurant like platform.I enjoyed nothing rather than the lasagna which is very tasty.The cafe need to work upon the customer requirements as letting us wait for hours for food. I visited this place with lots of hope but I am utterly disappointed. I wish it could get better.

Servicing:1/10
Food:7/10

Located amidst the heart of Camac Street , and near Vardhaan Market ,The Fans Club is the place to be if you are looking for some lipsmacking Vegetarian Delicacies and a perfectly soothing ambience. The Ambience was a total killer and as the name says "THE FANS CLUB " , if you visit you are gonna see your FAN'S picture hung up on the walls. A very quirky place , and also amazing place for photography . 

What I Ordered -

1.BUTTERSCOTCH AND CARAMEL - Full of cream and a milky caramalised mocktail . The smell of fresh butterscotch will keep you craving for more 

2.BLUBERRY MOJITO - Tired of Virgin Mojitos ? , well you must definitely try the bluberry mojito from this place. And the best part is they serve the mojito in a quirky skull designed mason jar. Happy Slurping !

3.CHEESE BROCOLLI MOMO - I know it sounds weird , because you people have only munched on chicken and regular mainstream momos. But trust me the first bite of this momo kept me thinking where had I come. The cheese and brocolli stuffing on the inside was so good , i gobbled up the entire lot. A MUST TRY 

4.STUFFED MUSHROOMS - If you are a ardent lover of mushroom , you must be here at THE FAN'S CLUB , sitting with a plate of stuffed mushrooms. The mushrooms were stuffed with cheese ,fried and sauted in bell peppers, onions ,tomatoes ,making it a perfect lipsmacking item .

5.INDIAN NACHOS - Yes definitely different from the nachos you eat in cinema halls . This place serves this dish in a huge bowl and mixes up the nachos with potatoes, bhujiya ,peanuts, etc. The chaat masala is added to spice it up. A MUST TRY .

6.CHEESE CROQUETTES -Stuffed with mozzarella cheese on the inside and fried until golden brown on the outside ,this item is a star item from the FANS CLUB . They give a mayo dip to blend it . 

7.DRUMSTICK WITH SCHEZWAN SAUCE - Being totally a non-vegetarian ,I always had chicken drumsticks , but never had the idea the veg drumsticks could taste so alluring . The drumsticks were stuffed with veggies and the schezwan sauce made it so sauce and juicy , I ended up ordering for more 

So without thinking ,just visit this place if you are near Camac street . The place has a huge private VIP lounge which will be perfect for Birthdays or corporate meets. Do visit the FAN'S CLUB .

This is a vegetarian cafe serving a wide range of cuisines which will make you experiment with your taste buds. I went with a group of friends for light lunch and ordered:
1. Butterscotch and caramel- this is a milk based mocktail which is creamy with a perfect blend of butterscotch and caramel. It's thick and very tasty.
2. Blueberry mojito - Served in a mason jar, this one has a classic blueberry taste and very refreshing.
3. Cheese Broccoli Momo- steamed momos stuffed with broccoli and cheese, so creamy and tasty that it melts inside your mouth in no time.
4. Stuffed mushrooms- mushrooms, stuffed and fried , served with veggies and tastes like chili fried mushrooms.
5. Indian Nachos- served in a bowl, consists of all the ingredients used to prepare an Indian Papdi Chaat. It has bhujia, aloo, nuts, veggies, chaat masala, sauce and tastes exactly like Papdi chaat, just that the Papdi is replaced with nachos.
6. Cheese croquettes- cheesy croquettes served with mayo dip, presented in a classy manner. The croquettes are crisp from outside and soft and cheesy from inside.
7. Drumstick with schezwan sauce - I have never had veg drumsticks before. This was something new and I had to order it. The dish has veggies stuffed in a way to make it look like drumsticks. Tastes very good, it's filling and presentation is great.
This place gets full marks in terms of ambience, it's spacious and has a private area as well. The service is commendable. The dishes are well presented and quality and quantity of food gets full marks. The food tastes delicious and this made me fall for vegetarian food. The price is also pretty reasonable considering the location of the cafe. A must visit.

This place is located near Vardhan market in the first floor of a building. Ambience wise this place is really a stunner. I dropped in there with a bunch of my friends. Just keep a note that this is a pure veg restaurant. To be on the safe side, we ordered starters and some drinks first:

Butter Scotch and caramel - 5/5
Blueberry mojito - 4.5/5

Cheese Broccoli Momo - 4/5

The fan's club is a must visit place for everyone in Kolkata. It's situated at 10, Wood Street, Camac Street, Kolkata. 

This hidden gem is one of the best place to visit for vegetarians around Kolkata. Their authentic fan's club foods is worth a shot! 

The minimalistic interior of TFC theme was giving a feel as if we are sitting in some restaurant in Kolkata. The whole menu is vegetarian and it's too vast, in one visit if can't be tried. The ambience is quite different and relaxing.

As a vegetarian joint, this place offers a unique menu with a wide variety of absolutely great quality of food.

My review for what I have tried:

Summer Drinks: 

1) Butterscotch and Caramel: It doesn‚Äôt have to be warm outside to enjoy a scrumptious caramel butterscotch milkshake. In fact, when the weather is particularly hot, I enjoyed this milkshakes even more. 

2) Blueberry Mojito: Taste warm summer days and perfect sunsets with this refreshing mint, sweet blueberries and tart lime. This mojito will sweep you away!

Foods :

1)Cheese broccoli Momo:  Momo‚Äôs for me are more than food. Being a native of north east, momo‚Äôs are synonyms with a variety of things associated with my childhood memories. But this six pieces of momos had a sumptuous filling with cheese and broccoli. 

2) Stuffed Mushrooms: This stuffed mushrooms are spiced up with traditional good and spicy flavours. Just one word "awesome" ‚ù§Ô∏è

3) Indian Nachos: It's has a characteristic texture that is quite different from other chips. This super sized veggie nacho a must have for any get together. These indian nachos are layered with fresh veggies.

4) Cheese Croquettes:  This yummy croquette is a small breadcrumbed fried food roll containing mashed potatoes and cheeses üßÄ 

5) Drumstick with schezwan sauce: This veg drumstick wrapped with sugarcane sticks so you can munch on that for fun after you've devoured the veggie drumstick. 

Overall, I recommend! It's delicious, fresh and all vegan. Great service and quick food. Can't wait to come back.

I'm not much around Camac Street area so I had a little trouble finding the place without GPS. Keventers, Jalapenos, The Fan's Club.. all in the same building and TFC being in the first floor.
A bunch of us friends dropped in for lunch last afternoon.
Ambiance and service, both one cannot complain of.
Ordered a couple of starters accompanied with Blueberry Mojito. The Mojito was amazingly prepared and the taste lingers in your mouth for quite sometime.
The starters included : 
Cheese Broccoli Momo, Stuffed Mushroom, Cheese Croquettes, Indian Nachos and Drumstick with Schezchuan Sauce.
By the time we finished having the starters, we were already too full. So we only stuck them for the day.
I loved the Broccoli Momo, Stuffed Mushroom and the Drumsticks and these are the three dishes that I'd order again on my next visit.

The Fan's Club is one of the best things that has happened to me recently. If you are a food lover no matter a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian ,you are going to love this posh vegetarian restaurant and would want to visit this place again and again because of the good food and the great ambience it has to offer
Talking about the ambience, I can say it is very quirky and colourful. This place has ample of spots for clicking photos and selfies. 
I visited the place for a chit chat with my friends and didn't expect it to turn out into an incredible food journey.
We ordered a few mocktails and some starters.
We ordered two mocktails-
1. Butter Scotch and Caramel Mocktail - a soothing mocktail with a nice butter scotch flavour. It wasn't overly sweet hence loved by all of us.
2. Blueberry Mojita - cool and refreshing. Though I am not ba big fan of blueberry but I loved this drink 
For the starters we ordered-
1. Cheese Broccoli Momo- I hate broccolis to be honest but this momo is something that I loved. It was cheesy ,it had a very subtle flavour of broccoli which didn't taste bad. Never imagined that broccoli could taste this awesome. This is a must try!
2. Stuffed Mushroom- mushroom stuffed with cottage cheese tossed with chopped onions tomatoes and bell peppers. We couldn't help but order another portion .it was delightful!
3. Desi Nachos- tasted like kolkata's famous Papri Chaat  but instead of the papri it had nachos. What can go wrong with this! It was spicy and flavoursome
4. Cheese Croquettes- it was cheesy and made a perfect snack for our chit chat session
5. Drumstick with Schezwan Sauce- it looked exactly like a chicken drumstick and tasted amazing. It had many veggies and was amazing. 
The food and ambience was great .the behaviour of the staffs were very good. They were helpful and the service was promt.
I will visit this place again and try out some main course next time ‚ù§

1. Cheese Broccoli Momo- I hate broccolis to be honest but this momo is something that I loved. It was cheesy ,it had a very subtle flavour of broccoli which didn't taste bad. Never imagined that broccoli could taste this awesome. This is a must try!
2. Stuffed Mushroom- mushroom stuffed with cottage cheese tossed with chopped onions tomatoes and bell peppers. We couldn't help but order another portion .it was delightful!
3. Desi Nachos- tasted like kolkata's famous Papri Chaat  but instead of the papri it had nachos. What can go wrong with this! It was spicy and flavoursome
4. Cheese Croquettes- it was cheesy and made a perfect snack for our chit chat session
5. Drumstick with Schezwan Sauce- it looked exactly like a chicken drumstick and tasted amazing. It had many veggies and was amazing. 
The food and ambience was great .the behaviour of the staffs were very good. They were helpful and the service was promt.
I will visit this place again and try out some main course next time ‚ù§

Location: Located on 10 Wood Street,on the first floor The Fan's Club is a restaurant that serves only vegetarian food.I decided to visit with some friends for lunch today and these are the items we ordered:

Beverages:-
1. ButterScotch and Caramel - It was quite a thick shake and creamy though it was very sweet,I liked it.

2.Blueberry Mojito- It was quite refreshing with the right amount of blueberry flavour and served in a skull glass it was quite a treat to the eye.

Food :-
1.Cheese Broccoli Momos- I have been a fan of momos over the years and have never liked veg momos but this changes my view,it was the best veg momo and the cheesiest momo I have had.

2.Stuffed Mushroom- This was served beautifully and tasted great too,with the right amount of spices,it was a perfect dish.

3.Indian Nachos- As the name suggests it was an indian version of nachos,made up in a bowl all mixed up something like a bhel puri.Interesting concept and tastes good too.

4.Cheese Croquettes-  These were quite cheesy and crispy and served with a dip.Overall it tasted good.

The service was good and the staff courteous,looking forward to visiting them again to try out some other dishes and their hookah.

TFC gave a visit to TFC....Coincidence Happens actually!!! And it happened when i visited this place Which named the initials that my food Page have "TFC". But they are far different from what i see them, being a Vegan and Non Vegan simultaneously i expect every place to amaze me with its ambiance or its service and last but not the least Food. Expectation always runs high whenever i visit a vegetarian place because every Non dish has an alternate to cover the flaws but veg food has no margin for error.

The Fan's Club draws your attention to all the Stars around the globe whether its Sportsmen, politician, Actors, inventors, Wwe superstars, Singer or Industrialist. this place indicates the greatness of these before said person to who they have Millions of Fans and TFC represents that. The ambiance tells the story about the place from the stairs which has pictures hanged from there itself. Inside you see a different world where You see all those big celebrities who made their mark on the entire world with their greatness and everywhere you'll only find them in form of their pictures. Sitting has been a look out too in this very place as they offer you soft sofa sitting and casual dine in. Lighting have been beautiful to cover up the Hookah. Service has been little slower but a newly opened place starts slower and gets it better.

The visit was a smaller one with few of the food and drinks for us.

Cheese broccoli Momo - Believe it! Momo cant get much better. You must have tried momos with veggies and chicken or other stuff but try this, you will definitely gonna fall in love with this. Soft and soothing looking momo had a soft coating and inside it had the hot cheese mixed up with broccoli. The taste just won my heart and forced to order it once again.
IMPORTANT NOTE : Dont try to eat it out at one shot, May burn ur mouth with the hot cheese.

Indian Nachos - Nachos have so much of variety to be presented. But this came with the Indian tadka. Crushed nachos mixed up with potato, tomato and other spices with sev on the top to give an Indian feel.

Butterscotch & caramel shake - It was a good one. Could have been much better with the taste.

A small visit left a good sign and experience. I wish them all the best. Cheers

A posh restaurant, The Fan's Club offers vegeterian delicacies to the city of joy .Being a hardcore non-vegeterian i never actually thought of giving a visit to this place but finally when my friends insisted me to give a try i agreed. 
Location: Well if you know where vardaan market is you will be able to find this place. Take the lane beside vardan market walk straight and take the first right and you will find The Fans Club. Its on the same place where you will find brickwood.

Ambience and others things:  well the place is very  beautifully decorated. Apt place for clicking pictures and selfies and you will find a wall of fame too where you can click pictures of yourself. The people there are courteous and helpful. You will feel very comfortable and at ease here.

Food: i didnt want to gulp on  heavy meals so we only had starters and 2 mocktails.

Butterscotch & caramel shake: loved this shake. It was not overly sweet; there was perfect balance of flavours.

Blueberry Mojito: oh my gosh. I have become a fan of this drink. Loved it totally. It was refreshing,sweet and a bit of tangyness was a treat to the tastebuds.

Stuffed Mushrooms: this was so tasty and yummy. Everything was oh-so perfect in this dish. I can have this dish all on my own it was that good. 

Indian Nachos: this too was quite good. Flavours were great enough to excite your tastebuds.

Cheese croquettes: they were cheesy goodness. Who doesn't love cheese? Well these were yumm and the dip provided a perfect balance and flavours to it.

Drumstick with schezwan sauce: appearance wise it looks like a non-veg drumstick but hey its actually veg. Presentation wise they did a commendable job. It tasted good also. 

Cheese broccoli momos: how can this also go wrong.  Being a momo lover, i quite liked this dish. Quantity and quality was good. 

Overall i had a vey good experience here. I was completely amazed at the mocktails and the starters.  Will definately visit the next time to try the mai  course as well.

Loud and reeks of hookah. Do not visit if you are not a hookah person. Also how does one mess up cold coffee. A typical Calcutta place with terrible Hindi music, shoddy food and a perpetual hookah haze.

I am writing this review while sitting here at the The Fan's Club. It's been 30mins and no one has come to take order despite calling two to three staff. Worst service at the very inception. We don't look forward to come here next time. As the place is so uncoordinated and uncordial. They seemed to have settled with the fact that reviews will not get their skin burnt. 
Anyways I Would Have Rated 0 But 1 Is The Bare Minimum I Have To Settle With.

The Fans club, it's just above the Keventer's and besides the Brickwood in the Wood Street. The theme of the cafe is based on Bollywood so it's for all Bollywood Fans and movie lovers. This place has cheerful ambiance, colourful and vivid furnishings and heart-throb music. Great ambiance and great food  but the bad place for hookah for sisha lovers. The staffs are least efficient  as lazy as tortoise with arrogant and reluctant attitude. Management needs to focus on the staffs as they were more busy in watching screening rather than the customer.

What we had are cold coffee, Penne Pasta with mixed sauce, Nacho Chat Indian Style, Soup-Cream of Broccoli, Veg Hakka Noodle, Brucheta, Kiwi Frappe and Fruit Shake.

Meal for two :- 1000 approx (prices are subject to change due to Macro factors such as inflation, market rates)

Food Quality :- 4/5
Food Quantity :- 3.5/5
Taste :- 4/5
Presentation :- 4/5
Hospitality :- 3.5/5
VFM :- 3.5/5

Expert suggestion :- Shisha maker needs to be more training and staffs needs to be replaced. Food taste and presentation can be improved.

Conclusion :- Overall a decent place which has a nice and new Bollywood theme with it.

Omg this place is so beautiful yet so disgusting . The place is good but the staff and food is so very poor and downmarket. I never thought of a place so horrible as this. Whatever the reason may be , the place is crowded more with staff then customers and that too so arrogant and boor. Coming to the food we had ordered sizzlers , cheese momo's , pizzas , cheese balls, they were not at all good. We got our orders placed after half an hour or so. The place and food was very average. My experience at fan's club was devastating and i will never ever visit this place ever. This is to the owner of the place. Please teach your staff some basic etiquette and get some good chef too.

Being close to St.Xaviers College, this place is the perfect pick for anyone who wants pure vegetarian food, including Jain food. The Crispy Chili Babycorn is worth trying when you're in here. I visited this place with a friend for lunch and loved the ambience. And the comfortable sofa seats were a bonus! The staff is courteous and this place is easy on your pockets as well. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for pure vegetarian restaurants around this place.

We ordered Paneer Tikka, Veg Supreme Pizza and Black Forest Shake. Well paneer tikka was not that good but pizza and shake were amazing. Do try it out for a wonderful experience.

Visited on Friendship day. Was bookmarked from a long time. But it didnt was up to the mark as expected. Was crowded. The table which they gave us, lights were switched off above. We had ordered for shisha, it was having a problem till end. Service was damn poor. Staffs didnt had time to serve properly, for every order they were saying it would take 45 minutes. Food was also not good in taste. The platter was too spicy. Music was loud. Ambience was soothing.

Location- Situated in the wood street, near vardhaan market, this place is easy to locate.
Ambience- Being a hookah lounge, the ambience surely justifies its genre, with good interior, couches, decent lighting and nice music.
Crowd- Weekdays are almost empty. Can definitely go on weekends. But dont have much expectations.
Food- The food is delicious. Be it sizzler, kabab or pasta. 
Staff- Understaffing is surely noticeable as you have to look for the staffs for quiet a long time to order something and to get the food on your table.
Overall, for good ambience and good food, this place is something you can look forward to.

The North Indian platter served was delicious and filling along with strawberry shake.. The screenplay of music videos and matches adds spark to it.. 
The service is appreciable and pocket pinch well in control.

On the first floor of the building that has Jalapenos, the is an average place to visit with friends or family. Given the occasion and the crowd pouring in, the guys did a good job serving food quicker than expected. The quality of the food was good but the drinks were not upto the mark. Ambience and feel of the place was pretty ordinary, however, they rocked a foot tapping playlist. A decent overall experience with scope for improvement in all aspects.

Visited this place for Breakfast this morning. Wonderful Ambience and vide to the place. We ordered for a Continental Combo with Cheese chili Sandwich and Indian Combo.
The Paratha in Indian Combo was very nice but the cheese chilli Sandwich in Continental Combo was disappointing as it was servered cold and was a bit soggy.

Service needs significant Improvement as there was just the Manager who was doing everything - right from taking the order to billing to supervising in the Kitchen to Serving.

Will return again only if I hear from someone that service has improved.

My first experience, thought it to be a good place  but it's totally opposite. Music is pathetic, the service is not at all acceptable, worst shisha ever tried. I have ordered two shakes one was black forest with oreo base the flavors were dead, the other was chocolate banana shake even which was okay. Not at all recommendable. No offense but people liking this place may have bad taste.

Went here on a Sunday evening and it was packed with people. We somehow managed to get a seat in the divan area but it was very dirty. Anyway moving on to the food, we ordered 

Hookah(3 paan flavour)- flavour was okay but it was strong. Hits you after a few drags. 

Crispy chilli baby corn - This was nice and crispy with the sauce perfect. 

Lasagna- we'd ordered the mixed sauce one but they served us the one with the white sauce. It was a bit bland, but Nevertheless, it tasted good.

Chilli paneer sizzler- It contained noodles with chunks of paneer and 2 vegetable munchurians. This was a very okay dish. The paneer was rubber like. 

Chocolate brownie shake - this was good. But it could've been better. 

And although the service was pretty rapid, but the waiters were quite unprofessional. They didn't seem to have a knowledge of what was going on in their restaurant. So overall this is a pretty average place with average quality of food.

Half extra point only for the ambiance and seating arrangements. Food is worse than worst.
1. Hara bhara kebab was burnt
2. Singapore rice noodles (less spicy) was actually extra spicy
3. Butter paneer was extra salty (double than usual)

As for staff courtesy, upon reporting all of the above, he simply took my mobile number saying that the owner will call me and told me that he will give discount on my next visit. I requested that as a courtesy you should give some discount in the current bill only as the pathetic experience i had i am not going to visit again. As to fool around again they simply refused and said that no discount today but it will only be extended if i visit again.
Dear Mr. Owner, with such food quality and rigid stand by staff, i am not even sorry for not visiting again.

Visited the place this evening with my friends. The place is located in Wood's street. The same building were Jalapenos is. 
The thing I liked at first is that they had the option of table booking in advance. 
The ambience is very different and has a spacious floor. There is a small space for private dining also. 5/5 for the space and ambience. 

Coming to the food. The place has a lot of option but only on the menu. The didn't provide us with most of the items of the menu. We settled for regular items. 

We ordered Galouti Kebab, Kadhai veg, Dal makhni, Tandoori roti, Shahi Biriyani, Virgin Mojito and Cold Coffee. 

We asked for crispy rotis, but they didn't knew what crispy meant it seems. 
Overall food was 3.5/5

May be on a day when all the items are available, it could be a nice visit.

Bottom line: the place is perfect if you're a college going student who adores sheesha and a place that has it all for any time of the day or night . It's ideal for college gangs to have their personal space to chill and tease and fight. They have unlimited non stop promotions which you can enjoy on any day which maybe special to you. Though yet to get their liquor license, they are pretty good with their mocktails and your pocket money would not go for a toss ! 

Taste: everything I had here, in various categories had a winner each. Be in sheesha, or the strawberry mocktail or a the hot green apple tea or their various food platters. They have various combos to help you out 

Sight: the place is blessing for college gangs what with their various pockets to isolate you from the world outside while you relish your alone time with your friends . They are high on graphics and the young peppy enthusiastic owners have a great music playlist, playing in the background 
They even have board games for the new game enthusiasts 

Serve: the service and at most times, personal attention of the owners is commendable

First impressions:
The guy outside the door takinv reservations straight up said 'all place is booked'. When intervened how can it be possible, he said ok u can take a seat after watching my female frnds. That was sick ! 
Look- nice. 
Music- good
Else than that not even a single person came to attend us even after calling them more than thrice. 
We had to leave bcoz it wasnt even too crowded(to keep the waiters busy) nor waiters to care that we even left after 30mins.

A good place for hanging out with friends.  Really cool ambience with good food!! They do play good music which won't eventually hurt one's ears. The staff provided a good service and had been really courteous!  Overall a good place!  Thank you :)

Ambience - nothing extraordinary. But still cool. Has all good board games to spend time!

Food - we ordered quite a many things. Jalape√±o cheese poppers were too oily. The jalape√±o flavour wasn't enriching. Manchow soup was tasteless. Paneer lasooni tikka was a real good deal! The flavours were rich. It was marinated really well. In the main course we ordered malai kofta and vegetable jhaal farezi. Malai kofta wasn't upto the mark the kofta was soggy. Vegetable jhal farezi somehow saved the day.

Service - damn slow. Water wasn't asked for. Tissues were not on the table till the end. Main course arrived really late.

Music - they were playing 2000's music. It was quite disappointing.

All in all, this place can be chosen only when you really run out of options. The Jalape√±o in the ground floor is much better option.

If you end up here, just have hookah and some finger foods.

Heard a lot about this place and this place totally made me a fan with it's interior.
Dim lighting with perfectly chosen playlist definitely made my evening.
We ordered Hawaiian Pizza, White sauce penne pasta and Green apple mojito.
Pizza and Pasta was tasteless but green apple mojito was perfect.. 
Somewhere food didn't match the expectation with a good location and outstanding ambience of this place.

One of the worst experiences ever. The staff is extremely rude and cheap to say the least. We asked them to change the songs several times, the place was entirely empty,the person had the audacity to bring the remote and show it in our face and then took it away somewhere inside. What do you think of yourself ? You don't oblige us Mr. Owner. Have basic etiquettes if nothing else ! Horrible food too. Never visiting the place again !

I went with my friends on 25/06/18 (i.e on A Sunday) at about 5PM.
2 of my friends were waiting here for us since 4PM. They ordered Hakka Noodles which came after 1hour approx.
The seats were not comfortable.
We thought to leave and go to another cafe after ordering shake !
We ordered Chocolate Brownie Shake but they said shakes Mei time lgega, after which we just paid for the noodles and left !
The staff were polite !

I have heard many good reviews for this place but nor I was not satisfied with the place neither my friends !

The second time me and my friends visited here on 25/12/17: again unsatisfactory !
Ordered cripsy chilly babycorn, pizza and hookah !
The quantity was really less !

Not recommended !

Great food... But service needs a lot of improvement. Guys of TFC take my words the only one reason if you guys fail would be cause of service. You have excellent ambience nd food just need to work on service and I m sure you won't disappoint me next time. Just be more attentive and quick.  Kudos.

One of the new trending places.. so had to visit it. I had ordered veggie supreme pizza which was tasty enough, ordered Mac and cheese, i felt it to be a little drying but its very fulfilling. And the lemon ice tea was a bit bitter and the s·π≠rawberry smoothie was refreshing.
 The biggest drawback is that they are understaffed and the limited staff is not trained. They seem to be lost. Service is extremely slow.. they really need to improve in this font. Otherwise all good.

After much deliberations I finally zeroed on  this place  for my  Birthday Bash and boy I wasn't disappointed at all.
The place is located just behind Camac Street Pantaloons. It's very well decorated and has a great ambience. Supreme Pizza and Nachos are too good.. However Noodles were disappointing..It's pocket friendly as well and the service Is also upto the mark. Overall a nice place to hang out with friends.

Visited this place yesterday with great expectations. Great ambiance, wall decor, large display screen.
This place has great ratings for customer service. Customer Service is tested at rush hour..and trust me have not faced such a bad service in last few years in kolkata..menu was given after 15 minutes,  even after 15 minutes complete menu was not given..thanks to zomato i understood that many items were missing..after another request got the full menu..Food was ok..ordered crispy chilli babycorn which was cold and soggy..plates were not served..had to eat in serving plate..2 mocktails were ordered,only one got served..had to remind them for the second one...
Board games were in mess..none of the game had complete set.

Chinese is decent. Hookah was also decent. Service is among the worst ever experienced. We found pieces of the utensil scrubber in our food. Each order took more than half an hour to be served. Some waiters are extremely rude. Others too indifferent to serve. The waiter forgot our order. The table near ours was served regular water. When we asked for regular water we were told that the waiters have been ordered to serve guests mineral water only (which was not sealed and the bottle was crushed) and the guests on the table nearby were "friends of the owner". Pathetically disgusting service! Packed the food in such a manner than everything fell out as we left

When you first step into this place, it smells like Paan flavored Hookah. The lights are dim but not in a very elegant way. Food is okay but a little over priced. I think the place lacks the vibe to justify it's name. And its totally VEGETARIAN.

A very nice and amazing place to chill out with friends. Even they have a big private space and no smoking zone so that you can bring your family too with wide variety of menu including Indian.  The ambience is soothing and attractive with great music.  I came here with group of friends and ordered pizza,  mix sauce pasta,  crispy chilly babycorn, Indian thali, Mexican rice with jacket potato,  couple of Mojito, cold coffee, brownie shake and kiwi frappe. I must say everything was at par.  Staffs are friendly and co-operative. The rates are also very pocket friendly.  One of the best place in Kolkata. A must visit place. Thumps up to team TFC.  Will visit this place again n again with friends.

The only thing as disappointing as the India-Pakistan Final was the cold reception I came across at The Fan's Club. We stood at the entrance for a while and there was nobody to guide us to a table and even when we notified them about our presence, they offered empty tables to new arrivals.
The service was pretty fast once we were stationed at our table and the food was quite impressive.
We had the following-

Crispy Chili Babycorn- It was a bit spicy, something to my liking,enjoyed the crispy crust.

Mac and Cheese- When it comes to cheese, the pessimistic in me sees the places which could have been loaded with more cheese.

Veggie Supreme Pizza- I'm not a fan of thin crust pizza,but somehow enjoyed it in my misery over the loss of team India. 

The ambience was very lively and prices were decent.

Best way to describe this place - A Paradise for the hookah and food lovers. The vibe of the place is set right from the time you take the stairs with colourful posters on the side wall. On entering the cafe, you feel welcome to a radiant ambiance with soothing lights. It has photos of famous people cobering all genres - sports, dance, business tycoons, singers, leaders, etc. Be it a large group of friends, couples or family there is a table for all with different concepts. Visited this place twice, once with friends and the other time with my bunch of cousins.

The list of drinks/food that we tried in a span of two days:
1. Californian Orange and Brownie Shake - This, became my instant favourite. Completely justified the name as the taste buds could clearly feel the magic of both orange and crushed brownie. 

2. Ginger Orange Mojito - A nice, chilled, refreshing citrusy with ginger mixed drink served in a skull shaped jar. 

3. Cheese Brocolli Momo - Honestly, I hate momos. Since every review had positive opinion about it and as it was strongly recommended by the staff, we decided to take the leap of faith. And to my surprise, the reviews were honest. The six pieces of dumplings had a sumptuous filling cheese and brocolli. This was served along with Tomato Garlic Chilli Chutney and a Coriander Chutney. 

4. Garlic Bread and Pizza Garlic Bread - The former was a classic garlic bread and the latter was not mentioned on the menu but was recommended by the staff. It had toppings of pizza with cheese on garlic bread. Both were good. The dish consisted of 6 pieces.

5. Chilli Babycorn - One of my favourite starter. Perfectly crisped!

6. Chilli Paneer Sizzler - Wanted to try something in sizzler and we ordered this. This was way better than our expectations. Nice spicy noodles, accompanied with chilli paneer and Manchurian. This was a filler. Around 3-4 can share this. 

7. Dal Makhni - One of the tastiest dal I had in recent times! 

8. Vegetable Jhalfrezy - Assortment of vegetables in a spicy gravy. Never felt like the regular restaurant type mix vegetable. The flavours definitely was appealing to my taste buds. 

9. Paneer Butter Masala - Thankfully this was not one of those sweet paneer butter masala that is often served in many places! Must say, it was another great sides that I had. 

10. Indian Breads - Along with the sides mentioned, we ordered for Lifafa Naan, Aloo Onion Kulcha and Tandoori Butter Roti. 

11. Mexican Rice - Though this was not mentioned in the menu, it was recommended! And it was good and felt authentic to a greater extent. 

From the ambience, to the music, to the good food everything was top-notch!! A must visit place! They also have great combo offers for special events (Currently for champions trophy), freebie days, and a lot more. Also got a chance to interact with the team, and they are coming with a lot more interesting menu.

They have definitely earned themselves a fan all the way from Chennai.

The service is really slow and bad. The waiters are least bothered about the crowd. The first bill they brought was after 20 mins. The billing was wrong and they charged for an extra red bull that we did not order. They took another 20 mins to change the bill. There is no feedback form available. No manager or owner was available to listen to the complaint.

The food was also very average. Not very happy with the place.

I visited this cafe on this last Sunday and had a terrible experience. When we were ordering our food the waiter asked us if we wanted regular or mineral water. I and my friend opted for regular and he actually laughed at us. When I asked him what was so funny he said that there was some issue going on for regular water but he would arrange it for us. Dude u have opened a restaurant and you are saying that you have an issue for providing regular water that too on a Sunday eve? We were continuously getting the wrong orders at our table. When we asked for check then also they din't give the exact amount saying that they din't have any change. I have never seen such an unprofessional restaurant ever. The excuses were so lame that it made me more upset. Oh did I forgot to mention they provide the worst hookah ever!! The food we ordered was just normal it was nothing like very delicious or something. Only one suggestion to them that stop using such strategies, the customers are not fools that they won't understand it.

A very nice and a decent place to be at. The food is just yum... Not being a momo lover and having cheese broccoli momo was yum. The drinks are superb, the quantity of food and drinks is a filler. Hookah lovers can always sit and have fun.. They do have board games available on request.. Good place to be at... Loved the place... A Lil bit glitches here and there but those can be avoided seeing their hospitality and tasting their foods

The food was okayish...nothing extraordinary.
It's a good place for matches and live sport screenings...
It would have got a 4 from me...but for the HOOKAH it is getting a 3.5 because it was really bizarre..
Hookah was not at all good. 
If you are hookah lover,like me,then I advise you not to go for this one.

Lighting is kept dim, and has a nice ambience to it, as that of a decent hip and happening place, with blarring music, and sports channel being tuned in during the IPL times made it a noisy place. 
The Thematic set up is attractive and enjoyable, as all corners are decorated. 
The staff is professional, accepting..and helpful, On asking about details of my Lasagne, they briefed me on complete details of the same with specific amounts and other info.
Also they gave me complementary ice cream! 
Was a cordial experience
And talking about Food, the taste is delectable, and upholds quality standard..and taste.  the quantity served is generous for the price charged 
Must Visit!

We had reserved seats for 10 on a Saturday afternoon well in advance. And when we visited, we were told that they had no empty seats and, on checking, they could confirm our reservation and asked a couple of people to change seats so that the ten of us could sit together. After 5 minutes of standing and waiting, we were seated.
We ordered a few starters and 10 shakes for each of us. The Butterscotch and Caramel shake was awesome. Though it tasted mostly of Caramel. Black Forest shake was amazing too.The strawberry shake was okay though. Chocolate and banana shake sucked. And so did California Orange Brownie shake!
Bruschetta was okayish and also very spicy. And so was the crispy chili baby corn.Mini Nachos was nice. The Supreme Pizza we ordered was amazing.
The biggest issue we had was that the air conditioner wasn't working and all ten of us were sweating in the typical Kolkata summer afternoon. When we asked the person in charge to change our seats to someplace else cause there were a lot of empty seats by then, the person said that they had reservations for the same. Funny how they forgot about our reservation and remembered other peoples' reservation!

Der was lot of fuss abt dis place.. unfortunately I din find any .. as per zomato dey hav dance floor.. but dey don't.. neither any board games. .. I don't know wat was wrong wid hookah it made us choke every time.. repeatedly v told dem to change.. v ordered cheese balls, drumsticks, berry shake, hazelnut coffee, schezwan noodles.. apart from shakes n cheese balls  nthng was great... Evn d service was so slow.. though d ambiance is quiet soothing .. couches so comfortable.. if dey improve d taste of food.. it would turn out to b a perfect place to hangout..

To start with - The stairs with posters all around will warm you up into the wonderful ambience inside. We were 4 and went around 4 pm yesterday. There are different type of seating arrangements and you can flex yourself as per your convenience. 

There were plenty of board games to choose from and we opted for Ludo. 

We ordered for Veggie Pizza, Sizzler, Virgin Mojito and Cold Coffee. The cold coffee was explicitly mentioned by their staff and it lived upto their expectation.

Overall and enjoyable experience. In the end they even give you 3 diacount vouchers for your next visit. In case anyone wants to visit there, can ping me for the coupon.

Camac Street is full of eating places, takes effort to stand up amongst those. This place does it effortlessly. Such a lovely ambiance, good crowd. Loved the deco and the large window seating. Service is quick. Loved to watch IPL matches from this cafe. The best part about it being among the limited pure veg places with ambiance of this level.

A WOW place for me at first sight. I can say it's a 'ME' place at the best !!

The Fan's Club or as called TFC is a very happening place situated on the first floor of 10, Wood Street. It's spacious & have a generous seating capacity with lovely chairs & sofa's all-around. The decor is kinda topsy-turvy ceilings with colors everywhere. Dimly lighted adding to it's soothing ambiance. It has portraits of famous personalities along with a hall of fame. And not to forget, it plays great musics beginning from 1980's till date. An all vegetarian eatery with multicuisine offerings, cafe-style & casual dining with hookah.

Guess what - the washrooms even are gorgeously decorated inside, with tags of PATOLA & GABRU on the door.¬†

Mr. Kaushik Shaw, Mr. Navin Sethia & some other people were a treat to talk to. A very friendly outlet with most decent & courteous staffs. The hospitality was at it's peak.

Coming to the menu we just had little snacks-

Butterscotch & Caramel Shake - 5/5 (the quantity was more than enough)
Strawberry Hawaiian Shake - 5/5 (the quantity was more than enough)
Corn & Cheese Balls - 4.5/5

This smoking hot place is full of Shisha & we had the Meetha Paan flavor - 4.5/5

The experience was stupendous. I would definitely love to come back again & again & would try rest of the menu.

A greatly recommended place !! Everybody must try out at least once !!

Bliss.. Bliss.. :) :)

Situated on the first floor, the Fan's club has quite a generous seating capacity. The interiors are fun, colorful and quirky. It's an all vegetarian eatery with multicuisine offerings, Cafe-style, casual dining with hookah and board games. Since I was quite sceptical about the food,  I just ordered a hookah, two mocktails and a quick bite at first, to take a taste test, which impressed me and made me also order the main course.

Green apple mojito: which was on a sweeter side, ruining the balance of the sourness.

Peach iced tea: which was nice and fresh

Paneer shawarma: tangy paneer masala wrapped in slightly grilled flat bread, served with a dip, was good.

Broccoli cheese momo: it's the feeling when you club all 3 of your favourites in one dish. The two sauces were weird but the momos were amazing.

Veggie supreme pizza: I just fell for this one. Thin, crisp, juicy and cheesy. The pizza looked and tasted great. 

The Experience was nice. The staff were cordial. Would like to visit again to explore the rest.

This place is one of its kind in Kolkata.great ambience and friendly staff.we went in a group of 3.We ordered crispy chilli babycorn,paneer tikka and schezwan noodles.And trust me you won't have room to complain about a single dish.Paneer tikkas are ofcourse the eye candy that comes in a small cart which you can aptly say us your 'cart of happiness '.I tried blackforest shake and i would say I haven't had something as good as it since a while.Ginger orange mojito was another drink we had and it surely was awesome.The quantity as well as the quality is superb and will surely won't pinch your pocket at all.

Servers/service: the servers are friendly but the service isn't upto the mark. On my second visit, we were ready to order but were invisible. The server came to take the order after making us wait for about 10-15 minutes. The table wasn't clean and was cleaned only after telling them to clean it.¬†

Food/drinks: I haven't tried out any of the food items over here. I have had the Black Forest Shake and Hookah. The Black Forest Shake was amazing. One of the best shakes I have had! I absolutely enjoyed every bit of it.¬†

Overall Feedback: I love the ambiance and definitely going back again. Hopefully, the servers will be a bit more attentive.

Visited this place today with my girl.
The place was packed when I went. We had to wait for 5-10 mins before getting the table.
1st of all I loved the ambience. The decorations done is pretty unique and nice.
We ordered a Combo of 999 which included Hookah , 2 red bull , 1 pizza , 1 starter and 1 garlic bread.
In starter we ordered Mini nachos which was amazing. The garlic bread was good and so was the pizza.
The staffs are pretty well behaved and co-operative. The service was a little late and that's completely understandable because it was a packed house.
We even got a discount coupon after we paid the bill.
All in all a very good place to visit and chill with your friends and your partner. Will visit again soon.

A nice place. Ambience is good. We went on the day kkr had a match. Watching the match on the big screen with whistles blowing in the background! It was really nice. 
Coming to food, it was okay okay. Margarita pizza is so not up to the mark. We ordered an ipl combo. A golden platter. Both were good.
Lastly, Service sucks. We called for the staff twice or thrice but they didn't pay any heed. Then after paying the bill, nobody was there to collect it. After waiting for 10 mins, we gave the exact amount and left. Improve the service.

Very unprofessional behavior of the staffs.
We went to this place in this scorching heat and what the staffs had to say was that they don't have space inspite of the fact that there were 3 different places which could have accommodated 14 people which they termed as reserved places and one wasn't even reserved.
I'll never visit this unprofessional place again.
Totally Gross behavior.

This property has something in it to draw attention... I am not a loud music lover but to make things comfortable they have a VIP room. The interiors are tastefully done and cozy. Now for the delectable part..Food..Its wide spread in its own terms.. Although it has vegetarian fare but the wide variety that this place offers won't make you yearn for non vegetarian food.  I personally liked the broccoli cheese momo... Succulent and crunchy.. The green apple tea.. Very soothing... And the Chinese Chopseuy.. Can beat any good Chinese joint.. I would recommend others to drive in and enjoy the food and if you love music and shisha.. all the more better for you...

Went on a Friday evening with a friend.
Ordered a hookah and jalapenos with cheese balls.
The place is easy to locate as also they they big gsb to make them finding easy.The place had decent crowd and the decor was nicely done.The place was clean and there was match playing.The only thing not up to the mark was the service.Wont say bad, but not professional.They also don't have any hookah menu, you tell them personally what you want and they will tell you rates.That can lead to changing prices accordingly as they desire which is not right.The menu card was also in some separate 8-9 pamplets separately.After serving the starter they asked us if we want plates or not.The water was normal  and when we wanted cold water they got  2 ice cubes.Tge other times again they served us the normal hot water.We to look around and call the waiters everytime for every small thing as everyone was in their own.The food and hookah was fine.The sauce with the starters was very spicy though.The price is very decent.We were billed at around 600rs.Need to improve on service.

The IPL season, an ideal time to visit The Fan's Club. I had gone with my friend and we're both KKR fans. Icing to the cake, KKR won üòç
Coming to the interiors, a pretty huge place with a very good ambience. The staff members were quite hospitable. Both the quality and quantity of food were very satisfying. The pinch in the pocket is also affordable. All in all, a very very good experience.

Must-haves: Cheese and corn balls, TFC special cone nachos.

Visited this place on 27/04/2017.
Well it's easy to locate this place, its on the backside of pantaloons in camac street.
Coming to the ambience it's pretty cool the theme is really interesting with quotes all over the place.

The food was really good, we ordered cheese croquettes, mac and cheese and green apple mojito and all were worth the penny we spent. Over all a nice experience, they play live screening during ipl but unfortunately we couldn't watch as it didn't click with the timings. Would love to visit the place again specially during ipl screening.

We visited in the afternoon time on a weekday so the place wasn't at all crowded. The place is divided into different sections to sit we sat on the sofa which was quite comfortable.
The hookah we ordered was just fabulous! And the crispy chilli babycorn was also good. The music collection is something they really need to work on!
The service also needs to improve as they waiter hardly had idea about the menu.

Date of Visit ‚Äì 09/03/2017

Location ‚Äì it is located opposite to the back gate of Pizza Hut, Camac Street, just above famous jalepenoes.

Ambience ‚Äì  The ambience of the place is excellent. The place is divided into few sections, one being a closed room for hookah lovers. Also, there is upside down ceiling art in one section which I found very interesting.

Service ‚Äì The staffs were trained and polite. The service was quick. Though at times if you want to order something you need to find them. They are not always around.

Food & Description ‚Äì It was a formal cum casual meeting with a client cum friend, so we decided to try this place as both of have not been there. As you enter the place you will find posters of eminent personalities. When we asked for table for two, we were shown a table of eight. We felt odd, we found a table for 4 and changed our seat. Coming straight to the food:

TFC Special Chia Seed Mocktail  ‚Äì This is one of TFC's signature drink, served in a long glass, brilliant in taste and looked amazing. Although i faced a technical issue. Chia seeds were getting stuck in the straw again and again which was very irritating. 

Chilli Mushroom ‚Äì I am mushroom lover and its a must for mushroom lover. Fabulous taste. Recommended.

Veggie Supreme Pizza ‚Äì It had loads of veggies and cheese. Also basil was added on request. Excellent thin crust pizza. They serve good varieties of pizza. Would love to try other pizzas too.

Overall the experience was good. Service was good. Food was tasty. Also its a pure vegetarian cafe. Recommended

Pocket Pinch - 800 for 2 approx.

Tried out the momos, Lasagna Florentine (which was the best, I have ever tasted in a while) and also the sweet and wonderful blueberry shake. It was nice to try out this cafe and without any hesitation I would surely like to visit it again.

Located just opposite, Pizza Hut, in Camac Street, this place isn't what I would call a must visit. This place isn't for the hookah lovers. There is a separate room for hookah. The seating arrangement for the hookah room isn't so comfortable. Rather, the hall for non hookah is much better in terms of seating arrangements. The staff communication is good. They're polite. In terms of prices, it very reasonable. This place could get much better if hookah was served in common, rather than in a separate room. Overall, a decent place.

The Fan's Club is a place Kolkata needs. Ambience, quality food, decor, board games, you name it, this place provides (except for alcoholic drinks). Hookah is there, although I don't have hookah myself. Anyway, this place is a classic. I had tried the Broccoli and cheese momos, and the Black forest Kit Kat shake. Both were very good. Pricing is not that reasonable however. Still this is a must visit.

UPDATE as on 10.06.2017

*The no.of Cheese balls has now decreased to five. I hate them for doing this!

*Paneer Tikka was well prepared with the right amount of grill and six pieces of paneer were served with Chutney.

*Schezwan Fried Rice was very well prepared and the quantity was good too.

MY FIRST REVIEW:
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†This place is located right above Jalepenos Restaurant behind Pantaloons, Camac Street. This place has a lot of different seating setups. We sat in the balcony with huge red seats.

The ambience was overall good but the music being played there was way too old school. Typical bollywood numbers.. Did not like the music at all..

Coming towards food, we ordered the following

*Cheese Balls - They name is something weird.. The cheese balls were really tasty and 6 pcs were served in one portion.

*Spaghetti Mix Sauce Pasta - Yummy but very heavy. It is a big time filler here.

*Crispy Chilli Baby Corn - One word and that is AVERAGE.

*Veggie Supreme Pizza - Very tasty. Although we were filled, it was way too tasty to resist.

*Italian Sizzler - Served with two cheese balls, French fries, rice or pasta base with vegetables. It is a MUST HAVE preparation here.

*Ginger Orange Mojito - Super awesome drink. One suggestion, just GO FOR IT.

*Black Forest Shake - GOOD

*Strawberry Shake - BELOW AVERAGE.

Now.. After the food comes the pricing part, here I will like to point out that the place is decently priced. We were billed a total of ‚Çπ2100 for all the above ordered food and drinks.

The highlight of this place is the quotations which are written all over the walls in the entire cafe.

Are you enamoured by Amitabh Bachchan‚Äôs deep baritone or the lilting melody of Kishore Kumar? Or perhaps you‚Äôre a proud geek, marvelling at the genius of Zuckerberg?

This peppy new place right across the back gate of 22 Camac Street, has a great decor, with separate sections to choose from according to one's mood, friendly servers, an interesting menu and board games too.

When I went to this newly opened place, on a invitation, with a bunch of friends, we sat at their separate sitting area, usually for private parties.

Though this place only serves vegetarian food, quite a few things on the menu caught my attention. The foremost among them was of course the Cheese and Broccoli Momos. With an in-house tomato dip to go with it, these melt in the mouth bags of gooey heaven, made my evening. This is something I will totally recommend to all cheese lovers.

Of the drinks, I loved the tea and the charcoal drink too. While the former was a perfect start to the evening, the latter, quite on the lines of the kala-khatta not only looked interesting but tasted great too. Another must try drink was the Black Forest Shake.

The mains would keep any vegetarian worth his penny happy, with super soft paneer tikkas, mochar chop with a tamarind dip and a hoarde of other things. However, the tomato cups were under-seasoned for me. And the nachos were nothing extraordinary.

The desserts however, were really impressive. The Cheesecake in particular stole my heart and the happy evening ended on a rather sweet note with it‚ò∫.

The Fan‚Äôs Club is located at 10, Wood Street. To be more precise, it is located¬†opposite to Pizza Hut, Camac Street, 1st Floor. First of all, i would like to thank Payel Rakshit for inviting me over for the blogger‚Äôs meet at The Fan‚Äôs Club. As soon as i heard this place is a pure vegetarian, i was a little unwilling as there are lot of new vegetarian restaurants opening offering the same type of items. However, the experience which i had here did make me feel like this place is actually insane and made me fall in love with their food offerings. As soon as you enter this place, the waterfall (color keeps changing) catches your attention. The ambiance of this place is designed beautifully and is mesmerizing treat to the eyes. The music of this place is really good and does give you a little party feel. The place is subdivided into many sections i.e. one for the couple‚Äôs candle light dinner, one for group parties, one as a usual cafe seating area, one is an upside down concept (mirror concept) which is beautifully curated and more. One need not worry regarding space here. Photo‚Äôs of prominent personalities such as Einstein, APJ Abdul Kalam, Bruce Lee etc. ¬†take up their Wall of Fame board. ¬†There is a ‚Äòmulticolored offer wheel‚Äô which can be spun and one can win different combo offers¬†and more. The staffs and the management is quite courteous towards their customer‚Äôs and is really a great place specially for the ‚ÄòVEGETARIANS‚Äô as it does offer you some lipsmacking food with a distinct touch to it. I have had vegetarian food at many places albeit¬†this place definitely took it to the next level. We were a group of 6-10 people and a special exclusive¬†menu was curated for us. The best part was the out of menu offerings that¬†had included some relishing desserts which came as an unexpected surprise. I also liked the door handle which had a lion symbol which was looking really beautiful.

This place is huge! The interiors are creative and there is upside down ceiling art in one section which.is interesting. Coming to the food,  would cringe at the mention of 'veg momo' but the broccoli and cheese momos here blew me away! So I highly recommend them. The nachos tasted fresh and had a good amount of flavors in there. If you are looking for a good place to hang out with your friends over good food, good ambiance and good music, The Fan's Club  is a great idea

Good food, blissful ambience, foot tapping music, pleasant interiors, and innovative drinks; that's the complete recipe of a superstar place with dedicated fan following.
Fan's Club scores big in all departments. 
Located near Camac street Pantaloons, this place will set you in a party mood the moment you enter.
The vegetarian spread and the cocktails are tailor made to impress.
Mocktails:-
Hot Apple Tea: This is the first time I tasted something so exotic . Apple flavoured hot piping tea infused with cinnamon, lemon, clove. This is refreshing as it washes away all your tiredness. 
TFC Special Health Mocktails: Keeping in mind the present trend of eating and drinking healthy, this drink is prepared to detoxify. Infused with chia seeds, strawberry, this drink has no artificial flavours and is sans sugar. 
Black Forest Shake : If drinks could kill, this will surely do so with it's look and taste.
TFC Special Chia Seed Mocktails: This is one of TFC's signature drink, brilliant in taste and flavours.
Starters:
Broccoli and cheese momo : Soft cheesy and creamy is how I describe thus plate.
Homemade Mini Nachos: A perfect dish, when you want to amble away time with friends munching something light. The salsa dip and sour cream further augments the dish.
TFC Special Bengali Mocha Kabaab: This is a dash of bong flavour added to the menu.Banana bloosm that is our very own "Mocha" prepared as kabaabs showed the creativity of the chef. The kabaabs are served with sweet tamarind chutney and kasaundi.
Main Course:-
Spaghetti veg bolognese: Beautifully presented this spaghetti impresses with it's light yet filling taste.
Lasooni Folks Sizzler: A complete dish by itself, this consists of rice and paneer cooked in rich spieces and garlic paste.
Desserts:-
Mango cheesecake :This cheesecake is unlike anything I have tried before. 
No Bake Chocolate cake: You need to taste this amazing dessert..!! I was  just overwhelmed by this beauty..
Thus fan's club is your lounge where you can relax with frds over good food and nice music.

This Joint is located at Wood Street, just in the back side of camac st pantaloons. They have started their run very recently. Though I have never been that much subscriber of Veg Food, but I am really impressed by the culinary they have started serving. Innovation in almost around the every dishes. Fine location, great ambiance, good food and friendly staffs are very much going to be the four pillars of their success story.

So on a sunday evening i got over with my workout regime and wanted to chill out with couple of my friends. Statrted to look for places when i came across this one. The pictures on zomato looked great.

It is located in the commercial belt of kolkata and is very easy to locate. Situated at the first floor of the building.The moment u climb up the stairs you notice a transition of TFC designs taking over. Entered the place and was awstruck by the interiors. I must confess this is by far the most sort after interiors done for any cafe/lounge in kolkata.

Me being a big sheesha fan went with an expectation to have a smoky evening but little did i know that the west bengal goverment has suspened the services of sheesha. Cmon maaaan! The f&b associate prensented menu which i found pretty elaborate.
Food and beverage ordered-
1)Cold coffee
2)white sauce pene pasta
3)No bake special cake

Now Coming to the food & beverage analysis . The cold coffee was just off the hook and tasted miraculous.Penne pasta was nestled with the smooth thick white sauce which was so creamy and cheesed rich.This was the best one i had till date in any place. Last but not the least the no bake speacial cake desert was just fabulous. It consisted of 4 layers and all 4 were different from eachother but were complimenting each other too. Served on the bed chocolate sauce along with a scoop vanilla ice cream one cannot ask for moreüëç

Met Varun Bahirwani who is such a brialliant host. He gave us a little synopsis about the place and his vision about it.
Time passed by and i asked for my cheque when i realized i dint miss hookah much for the first time in a cafe. The reasons were the food , beverage and  ambience. The pricing is very reasonable and will not make a hole in the pocket.

Great job team TFC. Keep it up. Highly recommended for youngsters.

Wow, what an experience! I'm totally satiated with this place. A must visit. Not even a month old and is one of the most talked about places in Kolkata. Ambience, staff, presentation, interiors everything is unique in its own way. The USP is the hot apple green tea along with broccoli and cheese momo.
Looking forward for more branches.

Reached at 12 seeing its opening time on zomato i.e. 11 am but that's the time when housekeeping and cleaning staff enter the cafe. We were told that the chef won't come anytime before 1:30. So please change your opening time on zomato and stop misleading your customers. Even after the chef arrived, half of the dishes present in the menu was unavailable at that point. We ordered for pasta, baby corn, paneer tikka and indian style nachos chat out of which pasta and nachos chat was below average.

Chesters to the right and Dewans to the left, The Fan's Club defines Creativity, Fanfare and Comfort. The food is sumptuous and the interiors kept my eyes glued to each section of the place.
The broccoli & Cheese momo is my favourite dish and my recommendation to everyone who visits the place. The herbal tea, a special for the ones who approach Kaushik is a must try too. The staff is sophisticated and has a pampering temperament too. The menu is wide spread and the serving time is just perfect. 
Wishing good luck to The Fan's Club.

But the most beautiful thing of this place is their hospitality,  very courteous and helpful staff,  who creates the last impression of coming back to this place again and again.

I visited this restaurant (1.1.17) with my family. To begin with we had not planned to go there but due to rush hour we thought of trying this new outlet. However it turned out to be good decision as the place offers an excellent ambience with appetising food and amazing music. We had ordered kebabs which are must try followed by paan flavour hookah, mixed fruit mojito( superb drink),berry shake and Italian sizzler. The portion size is decent coupled with pocket friendly prices, though service was slightly late. Overall it was an amazing experience and must try for all Vegan food lovers.. Just a suggestion to add a live music band to make it more happening.

When we entered the restaurant I first felt that by the door that a private party may be going on but when entered it was good
The ambience was just amazing I loved the seating arrangement 
The food was just amazing. I ordered Hara Bhara Kabeb which was just lovely and then we ordered Italian sizzler which was also fabulous and very tasty. The service also was very good their staffs were very polite.

The Fan's club the place that does full justice to its name and doenst disappoint you in any regard be it service , ambience, food, interiors, comfort, mocktails or hospitality!! 
The interior designer has very smartly used the huge space and divided the area into different sections with different concepts. 
If ur coming with a group of friends ull be more than happy with the whole experience n I bet u'd want to come again n again.
Couples u won't be disappointed at all as they have a secular zone for you with a love theme in all RED.
Regarding the food it's got Chinese, Mexican, Italian, continental and Indian I've tasted in bits n the food is yuuuummmmmm I cudnt resist trying out different dishes n unfortunately I cudnt take out any flaws. My favorites being the Seekh kabaab, broccoli n cheese momos, the Tfc special Bengali kabaab (a must try) and the stuffed mushrooms. 
Coming to the mocktails it's the best in town u gotta try the mocktails here else ur missing something trust me on that! 
All in all I'd give more than 5 stars to this amazing place if that was possible. So guys this place is highly recommended.

I take great pleasure in writing the first review for The Fan's Club (TFC)... Finally the wait is over....TFC is now open for everyone!! Well guys, it sure is gonna be the most happening place in town...!!

Location: Situated in Wood Street (Camac Street area), the place stands just opposite to Pizza Hut!! It's located on the 1st floor of the same building as Jalape√±os. Great location, amidst the city hub!

Theme: TFC has got the most unique theme, rather the first ever, such a theme in town. As the name suggests, it literally stands up to its name as The "FAN'S" Club. Well, you enter the place and there you are...amidst all kinda celebreties you can think of!! Bollywood, Cricketers, WWE, Music, Comedians...you name it...you get it! There are actually distinct divisions for each of its kind...!! A total justice to the theme I must say!! This is actually the place for the "fans" ;)

Interior & Decor: My! my!! my!!! Mind blowing decor!! Simply fantabulous!! Stepping inside the place, the very first thing to catch your eyes is the big glass color changing waterfall, serving as the home to a handful of fishes. It's beautiful!! Above it, lies the picture of the Master Blaster!! On its back hangs the portrait of our very own Dada!! This way each section is decorated with different areas, be it the Comedian table where you lay your plates over Kapil Sharma, Mr. Beans etc. or the private dining area where one side of the wall covers SRK and other modern actors while the other covers the legendary ones. Same way goes for Sportspersons, Wrestlers, Musicians as well as some of our favourite cartoon characters like Tom & Jerry, Pokemon, Donald Duck & Family, Shinchan etc. The colors are all done in a very vibrant and lively way!! The sofas and couches are colorful and bright. The lamps hanging from above are really beautiful. Then there is one section, where you will see everything in an upside down manner, be it the wall decorated with bookshelves or the lamps! There also stands a Wall of Fame next to the main entrance where you come across successful personalities like APJ Abdul Kalam, Albert Einstein, Steve Jobs, Bruce Lee, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Dhirubhai Ambani, Ratan Tata, Michael Jackson, Lata Mangeshkar, Kapil Dev, Marylin Monroe to name some. The most unique thing about this place is that they even got a wall for performance appreciation as in Staff of the Month and so on. Pretty impressive I must say!! The entire place has been done in an extremely meticulous way, keeping in mind every little detail!! Hats off to the decoration!!

Infra: The place is quite spacious and there are a number of separate seating divisions. To name some of them, well it includes, a Mocktail Bar, Bar like High Chairs, Couches, Table and Chairs, a couple of super comfortable low divan kinds, perfect for chilling out... I loved this seating arrangement the best!! They provide mobile chargers on the table which is a plus point. There is a small place separate from the main one, which accomodates around 10 spread across 2 tables done in a lovey dovey way, meant for the couples who want some space from the crowd! Apart from the Main Seating area (as mentioned above), this place also has got a private dining area, best suited for private parties!!! It's one kind of a place in the sense that each seating area is different from the other!! There is also a huge screen playing music videos, which I'm sure will serve as Live Sports Screening during the match days!!

Ambience: Superb ambience and great music!!! A combination of cool and classy!!

Food: Finally coming to food, well, TFC serves a wide variety of cuisines, be it Finger Food or Italian or Mexican or Indian or Chinese. Some of the items which I tried were;
Momos (just yumm...actually tasted like Pesto Momos as it was prepared with Basil and Cheese alongside Brocoli)
Quesadilla, Spring Rolls, Noodles, Manchurian, Mexican Rice, Daal Makhaani (heavenly)... All the items were pretty good!! Alongside the interior and decor, they haven't compromised on the food one little bit!!

To conclude, I will say, its a SUPERB, FANTASTIC, ROCKING, HAPPENING place!!! I wish Zomato would allow rating more than 5!! Looking forward to loads of outings over here!! Keep up the good work Team TFC!! (Y)
