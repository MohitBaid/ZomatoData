One of the finest bars in the city, with a classy lush ambiance, The Bar at The Oberoi Grand stock up on a choicest range of select alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.
With interesting names like Babu ghat and Spice route, and served attractively in cocktail glasses or tiki mugs, their offerings are a must try. Alcohol aficionados or anyone fond of beverages would surely love this place.

Food is below par considering the stature of this restaurant and the property it is located in. Fries served to us were cold and not crispy at all. Drink was kind of alright though.
