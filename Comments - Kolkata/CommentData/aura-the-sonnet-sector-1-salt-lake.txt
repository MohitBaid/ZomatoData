A group of 4, we decided to go for brunch and The Sonnet seemed to be the perfect choice. They have a set buffet, with the usual Indian and continental brunch spread. The food was fresh and cooked deliciously. Our eggs to order were also done perfectly. The dessert and especially the in house donuts deserve special mention. The ambience was nice and the staff was extremely courteous. They went out of their way to make my 82 year old grandmother feel comfortable. For more family brunches, Id definitely return here.

The ambience and service is spot on!
The food is good. I order wings tossed in marinara as an appetizer but there was too much Oregano and I am sure that's not how marinara tastes.
However my main course consisted of some Indian dishes which was good.

The buffet breakfast at Aura is really good. They have a wide array of dishes starting including assorted breads, baked goodies, poori sabzi, South Indian items like vada, idli, Dosa, grilled bacon, sausages, cheese platter, Milkshakes and juices, milk and cereals, flavoured yoghurt, gulab jamun, etc. It's a great spread, tasty and nutritious and definitely worth a try.

We have been here for team dinner on 28/07/17.

Highly costly... Took more than rs 650 + tax per head .. but the dishes offered in the buffet were not very appreciable.. the same cost could provide far better buffet menu.

Ambience n interiors was good... Hospitality was okay...

We had ..
In starter - paneer tikka, tandoori potato, fish finger.
No chicken dish

The main course items were also not lucrative.
