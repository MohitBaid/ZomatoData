Everything you need to spend an awesome evening with friends or your partner is provided at these lovely snack joints spread all over the city.
This one beside RDB has a better ambience, with not-too-bright lights and the perfect rock and pop variations of music. A spacious place for a snacks joint.
Food is not bad. But their speciality is something else - each of the tea and coffee items offered by them are a delight in itself!
Their hookahs are awesome and has variety.
Service and hospitality good, but sparsely manned.
Not to be visited if you're looking for a heavy meal.

Location: Sector 5, Near college more, near RDB cinema just beside Barbeque Nation.
Ambience: We had opted for the buffet menu so we were taken to a separate small room. I guess that room is for the people opting for buffet. It was quite filled. There were bollywood songs playing in the background. 
Food: The starters were served. We had dry chilli chicken,crispy chilli babycorn(4/5), Banjara aloo, chicken hariyali kabab(4/5), chicken kabab, two veg items, chicken wings(3.8/5), chicken pakora, pizza(3.5/5), two types of pastas. 1 mocktail was complementary. For the main course they had lemon and coriander soup(4/5), peas rice, some paneer item, chilli chicken, biriyani(3/5), mutton Rogan Josh(4.2/5), and a gravy prawn item(4/5) and butter nun. For deserts they had 3 types of mouses, ghee mihidana, hot small gulab jamuns and vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. 
I expected a bit more in the dessert section but to the price we paid I was quite satisfied.
Bill: We had gone before 12:30 and thus our bill was for Rs536 (Early Bird Offer) 
So if I consider the price and the food I had, I would completely recommend this place to everyone.
Happy Fooding ‚úåÔ∏è

Chai Break has the great sense of inducing a clean textures in almost everything you order. Been here on multiple occasions and everytime it was a pleasant experience. They have buffet during lunch hours and the buffet spread is a bit lack luster, would always recommend alacarte as that is what we write home about.
Do try the chesse fondue, and the garlic prawns. Be it Italian or Indian they serve it well. Loved the butter chicken and butter Naan on one occasion.

I came to know about the awesome buffet section on offer here from some colleagues of mine. And yesterday they made me visit this place and give it a try. Well i must say it was worth it. From the decor to the service and ambience everything was nice. Its located just near RDB boulevard. Now coming to the food, there were more than 20 items on the menu. But the stars among them were kung pao prawn( it was so yum) , crispy chilly babycorn, fish amritsari, chicken wings, haryali kebab, i also tried the chicken pizza., in the main course mutton roganjosh, chicken bharta and chicken biriyani were the standouts. The dessert section was assorted, i had vanilla ice cream with choco sauce and gulabjamun and the three types of mousse cakes.

3 words. Value for money!!

If you want to have a lunch buffet that is friendly on your pocket as well satisfies your taste buds, Chai Break could be your ideal destination. Surprisingly, there is lot of variety with regards to the starters. Main course and dessert lovers may feel the menu is too short. The quality of food is upto the mark, so that is not an issue. The service needs to improve though.

we went to this joint for our team lunch.. we pre-booked for 40 people and were given time of 2.30.. we reached the place on time but had to wait till 3 to get seated.. had several options under veg..
paneer cauliflower potato babycorn cutlet pasta pizza were some of the options under the starters..
biryani fried rice chilli paneer dal makhani aloo paneer nun were some of the options under the main course..

Chai break happens to be one of my favorite chains. They have tweaked their menu a little for this place. They offer buffet options also. If you are looking for buffet options in budget, it can be considered as a good option. The menu of buffet can be worked out. Sheesha is not up to the mark. 
My recommendations are KitKat shake, Kesar Chai and pasta (still wondering, why they don't offer baked pasta).

Imagine workng for 9 hours and then being dragged to this place and kept there for the next four hours...it used to feel lyk a jail where you wanted to be out.
Anyways the place is nice with good music, good ambience especially late night...i have failed to find the kind of pizza they make anywhere else in kolkata...i just love their pizza...the hookah they make is topnotch too and you gotta believe me coz i have always visited the place in company of people whom i didnt want to b with but still enjoyedüòÇ

Mumbai girl in Kolkata. Another great place in sector 5 and this one was on my to go list since a long time.
Tip- 4 to 8pm (mon to Fri) you get 20 percent discount on the entire bill.

Ambiance is colourful, place is well maintained, staff is well trained and you'll always see young crowd whenever you go. Sheesha is really good. Didn't eat anything as we were already full and but we tried teen paan (sheesha) and I am definitely coming back whenever I am back in Kolkata.

Sheesha- 5/5- I personally think sheesha is better in Kolkata and wayyyyyyyyyyy cheaper. Rs288 with taxes as we went between 4-8pm.

           There are almost 15 items in the starters...lots of variety.. Each and every items were delicious specially the chicken tikka kababs and fish items..in main course i will specially mention the Mutton Rogan josh...it was fabulous.....juicy and succulent.. biriyani was average..desert section was very flat..Overall a nice experience not so much special.. 

I would request the management to improve their sitting arrangement and ambience and the professionality of the staffs also..Thanks.

My friends and me visited the Sector 5 outlet yesterday and found that the bill had 18% levied GST despite the rule being effective from yesterday that GST has been brought down to 5%. On pointing this out to the restaurant manager, he confronted us with baseless logic that it will take another day or two for the update to happen and offered no admission of the mistake or even apology. He was trying to put the blame back on us and get away with it. I can only imagine the number of people who would have ended up paying 18% GST due to ignorance and this is how restaurants makes merry out of this. Shame on Chai Break.

So Chai Break is in Sector 5 and they surely have a good buffet altogether. I had tried it twice and it surely is a great meal overall.
In starters we had a number of variations which is certainly the best part. There were quite a huge number of vivid veg & non veg starters including some of my favourites such as Chilli Prawn, Crispy fried Baby corn chicken kababs, garlic chicken, spicy chicken wings etc. ‚ò∫Ô∏è 
One of the great things were that they didn‚Äôt limit their menu to just Indian starters, we also had thin crust pizza, pasta and other continental dishes! 
Main course and desserts had different types as well. The service was quite quick and efficient overall. But one personal issue I felt was that the boys were serving way too fast in case of the starters which was a little annoying on the part of a customer. 
Their buffet retails for 625/- which is actually affordable for a good fulling buffet. üòò
Here are some of my favourites from their buffet!

I liked their ambiance. Quite different than the other Chai Breaks. Food was good and so was the hookah. They had some good music playing. It was a really nice place to hang out and catch up with old friends.

Not a full point because I didn't find anything worth dubbing it as unique. Yes it's a good place to hangout but that's it.

This is just besides barbeque nation sector 5. Visited twice in last one month. Tried their buffet and trust me it was good. They are serving a really good food in this price range. They have plenty of options as starter. Fish batter fry and salt & paper chicken was awesome. What is unique about this place that they serve pizza and pasta both in starter. In the main course section mutton is biriyani good. Farnkly didn't taste any other items so can't commnet on that. Their desert section is little bit disappointing. They have only type of ice cream, sandesh , mihidana and three types of mouse in desert section. Overall a satisfactory experience in this price tag. Staffs are good and environment is good , though it's don't like a buffet place.

Location: Funnily enough, it's biggest competition is the landmark to identify it's location.It's located just besides BBQ Nation,Sector V,in RDB boulevard.

Ambience:Very basic and somewhat the whole aura is  a bit confusing.The ambience screams more 'hookah parlour' than a classy buffet place.There seating is not conducive for buffet style eating where you would have to get up a number of times to access the buffer spread.Even the tables are small.

Food:Cutting right to the chase, let's get right into the agenda-the grub.
The starter section included-
Welcome drink:Masala coke(4.5/5)üíñ
Salt and pepper paneer(5/5)üíñ
Paneer tikka(3.5/5)üíñ
Crispy chilli babycorn(5/5)üíñ
Banjara aloo(1.5/5)
Sweet corn balls(1.5/5)
Chicken tikka(4/5)üíñ
Chicken pakoda(4.25/5)üíñ
Spicy chicken wings(3.5/5)üíñ
Salt and pepper chicken(3.75/5)üíñ
Fish butter fry(2/5)
Shanghai prawns(5/5)üíñ
Chicken pizza(5/5)üíñ
Chicken pasta(2/5)
Most of the starters would win your heart.Although they were not absolute specimens of culinary art,the taste was amazing and akin to a paisa vasool,masala Bolly flick that you would thoroughly enjoy.

Mains included a myriad of dishes including soup,veg fried rice,chilli chicken,paneer,chicken curry,dal,salad,papad but I steered clear of those and directly went for the Chicken biryani(5/5)and mutton roganjosh(4.5/5).While the former could give any well-established biryani joint a run for it's money,the meat in the latter was super tender and the gravy was delicious.

In the dessert section, there were 3 types of mousses(chocolate,mango and strawberry),sandesh,ghee mihidana,gulab jamun,vanilla icecream and chocolate sauce.The combination of hot gulab jamun on cold vanilla icecream with an indecent helping of chocolate sauce left me reeling.Personally,I was happy with the rather limited dessert section and I could totally focus on my favourites without any FOMO.

Service-The staff was warm,efficient and they served the starters fairly quickly on the table.

Price-Very economical and the early bird offer is the icing on the cake.

Verdict-Best budget buffet in town.All my prior trysts with buffets have been courtesy BBQ nation and so I was sceptical about this place.But Chai Break managed to exceed my expectations and more.Frankly,I couldn't have asked for a better venue for our office party.

To start with, the ambience and the decor of the restaurant is cool. There are audio video sound system that play ear soothing songs, while you fill your empty tummy. I really liked the range of starters that they servered. It was all delicious and wide in variety. The main course is also set in a way to compliment the starter menu. The mutton roganjosh and the kashmiri aloo dum were among the best in taste.The deserts serverd were quite attractive, but can be more diversified. Overall, it all went WELL :)

Went out for a team lunch this week, and this place certainly knows to have elements ready for a buffet. The list of starters for non veg was indeed a long one starting from chicken pakora to around 6-7 items of chicken, along with fish butter fry and of course, the Shanghai Prawn which was awesome. Vor veggies there was all paneer stuffs.. they do have all the rights to glare a state at us.. Apart from non vegs, there was pizza and pasta, which could not take a stand in comparison with the priors. The service was fast.. at times faster than we could consume.. but we had to wait for the repeats for quite long enough.
For the main course, honestly, items were regular ones. The mutton Rogan Josh needs to be better. No to add much for the mains. Quality was good.
Lastly the dessert, yum yum yum!! 
Overall ambience was great with the inner decor to music, quite refreshing. Worth taking a break with your peers. Cheers!

Seating arrangement is a little cramp here, only 4-5 people can seat together. Else you have to opt for high chairs. Ambience is average. Food is fairly good. They served 8-9 types of straters, in chicken, shrimp, fish and veg. I liked their cheese corn ball. Main course is fine. They need to improve their desert items taste and option wise. Most of the foods are little oily, so you can't eat more.

I have probably never given a 5 to any place in my first visit itself, but these guys made sure our team dinner was mind blowing. 
For 600+ taxes for buffet the food/ambience /service was superb. 
Starters : chicken salt pepper, spicy chicken wings, chilly baby corn, tandoori tikka, hariyali chicken kebab, pranko fried fish, paneer cheese balls, bamjara aloo,  pizza. 
It was literally never ending and lip smaking. 
Mains : naan, chicken biriyani, 2 soup variants, chilli chicken, mutton rogan josh, paneer butter masala, veg hydrabadi, noodles and sides like pasta, papad, salad. 
The meat was tender and melting in mouth. 
Dessert : ice-cream with chocolate sauce, gulab janum, 3 kinds of moose. 
Overall we were left raving for the tasty delicacies and am definitely visiting again. 
They even customised our menu according to our budget which was great.

I had the impression that this was a very ‚Äòhappening‚Äô place. However, to be really honest, I didn‚Äôt quite like it much. For starters, the place was too dark and the seating arrangement (for three) was made rather far apart. On top of that the waiters were huddled too near to our table (or maybe that‚Äôs cause the football match was on- and it‚Äôs a known fact how much we enjoy watching a good game of football). Ok, getting back, we ordered French fries, Thai basil Chicken and salt n pepper fish along with a masala coke, masala chai and hot chocolate. The beverages were passable but barring the fish, the fries and chicken were too dry. I think they wanted the chicken to be a crispy element and ended up over frying it. I wouldn‚Äôt say that the food and ambience was a value for money. Probably wouldn‚Äôt like to return to this place.

Only complain about this place is the same items sre in the buffet spread for last 1 year. Nothing to say about the quality. Desert spread needs attention.
Please tey to refresh the buffet items.

Went to this place today 22nd December. Menu changed. Among the starters lahori chicken was superb lahsoni chicken was not ok. It was very hard. Main course items included a prawn preparation was very spicy just like masala egg curry. Burnt garlic chicken was very good. Mutton roganjosh was superb as usual. Desert spread was as usual. But the annoying factor was the bad service which was never experienced before.  Only person who was helpful was Mr Subhankar. He tried to solve all my issues. Great job. Another factor which was never seen before was shortage of material. The mousse was 
Not on the table for at least 15 minutes. The burnt chicken was found without chicken only gravy. Even it was pointed out to one of the service guys but no action was taken. I should have intimated to Mr Subhankar. Any way mixed experience but a big thanks to Subhankar for his personalised service.

Please make sure the person who receive the call for advance booking are well experienced in this business. We reached with the full team by 12.05 and the person in charge mentioned that the restaurant is already book and they done have any space to accommodate us.

I have visited this place 2 to 3 times with my office colleagues.I am only reviewing the buffet which I have tasted so far.The starters are nice but they have reduced the number since I have visited last time.Food quality was average and the maincourse was as usual dull.I expected some more fruitful dishes in the dessert.Allover it is an average buffet place to go out for a lunch or dinner.

Located beside BBQ Nation in RDB boulevard at sec V. The ambience was good. We had lunch buffet, the starters were good and had a huge variety of both veg and non-veg types. The mocktail - tropical blue was very good. The main course consists of mostly North Indian dishes but unlike the starters it lacked much variety. The ice-cream was very good but other deserts were not so good, could have been better. And last but not the least, the staffs were very good and generous.

This outlet of chai break is located beside BBQ nation in RDB boulevard at sector V. The decor along with the ambience is quite nice. The staff is courteous as well.Coming to the food, we had lunch buffet, the starters were amazing and had a huge variety, the main course spread was north Indian based catering to veg and non veg dishes equally unlike the starters which has limited options for vegetarians. Desserts were nice but could have been better. Overall a nice experience.

A horrible experience with this restaurant. We called up the restaurant one day before and they informed we need not to book in advance but we have to be there within 12-12.30 in the venue. We reached with the full team by 12.05 and the person in charge mentioned that the restaurant is already book and they done have any space to accommodate us. Also few stuff mentioned that they can never say that in phone that they dont take up prebooking. All 27 ppl was waiting outside and we had to arrange something else immediately. This was really unprofessional. I don't recommend this place at all.

Worst unprofessional and very selfish motive they have. At the time of booking they told us to come at 12 noon and we will take you in as per the no.  of head we will not take booking right now. Then when we arrived there before 12, they just denied booking telling us we are completely booked. After a lot of reasoning also they denied and said we are completely booked, it was clear that they would have got a greater no.  of counts for some other booking. This is very selfish and unprofessional of them, we are standing by here now, we are 27 people. We will not recommend anyone to come here ever. They are the worst in this field. I had to give 1 star.

Nabami Night in Kolkata had all pubs and restaurants filled to the full with people till late night and Chai Break seemed like the only place that could afford to provide us seats. Dressed in mostly traditional attire, the crowd was a perfect blend of the modern Bengali enjoying a night out amidst the beautiful drum sounds of traditionalism and Durga Puja.

Chai Break was dimly lit with upbeat songs playing in the background. We ordered the Pan Rasna and Mint hookah with a mojito base. Intoxicating with the flavours just blending in beautifully, it was every hookah lover's perfect foil to a hectic night out.

The standout however, has to be the Royal Tea. Indian milk tea with a touch of kesar can seem like a strange combination at first but the flavour gradually started growing on me. The sugar was just minimum, the way I like it and teamed with hot chicken pakoras, it was almost perfect to beat the slight high from the hookah.

I would definitely recommend visiting Chai Break. Despite the dark interiors and slow service, Chai Break deserves a mention for its Royal Tea and snacks after a stressful day at work.

Visited this place today with Office colleagues for Puja Lunch. Heard a lot about this place , specially the Starters they serve. I must say , starters are really good to have. If you all are planning for team lunch or group outing, try the Buffet. Cause, the starters are great deal. Specially, Wok Fried Chicken Wings, Prawn Fry, Salt & Pepper Chicken and last but not the least Fish Batter Fry. Other items are also good. Don't expect anything wow on the Main Course as you will not like having them after a Bombarding of Starters:)¬†Ambiance is nice and colorful, Staffs are nice and polite. Would highly recommend to all my friends.

I visited this place late night with my special friend. 

Ambiance was okay . I ordered one starter of Lamb,hookah and one chai. Chai was really good, lamb was too salty. I gave them the feedback instantly but they didn't responded properly, Hookah was also good.

I visited this place again some time back in late night and that day I ordered Lasagna and it was really very good. 

This 3.5 rating is just based on my second visit as first visit was not a nice experience to remember.

The starters are good. There were chicken wings, chicken tikka, prawns, baby corn and other veg items. No red meat though. Didn't go for the main course because I was full by the time I was done with the starters.

The dessert choices are limited but still I was happy with what I had, for example the halwa was good.

However they could groom their staff a bit more.

This buffet place surely goes easy on your pocket and leaves you with some lip smacking yummylicious food experience. The non veg buffet menu consisted of chicken pakora,chicken wings,chicken tandoori,fish fry,prawn,sweet corn balls,chilli babycorn,panner tikka as starters. There was chicken biriyani, chicken garlic,mutton rogan josh as the main course. The dessert was okayish,nothing extra ordinary mainly consisting of dessert cream shots and ice cream. The gajar ka halwa was great though!
Staffs are very courteous and cordial. The decor was great too. We also order the hookah which again was a great experience !
Will surely visit this place again,whenever possible. Cheers!

Disappointing experience. We had booked the seats on 28th Aug for a lunch party and the most astonishing fact was that we were asked to leave at 2:00 P.M. while most of us were in the middle of our Desert. We had organised lunch parties at other places also, but no where did we face such humiliation and insult. This is a complete discrimination towards a customer, since we are paying in full for each plate. After full payment, such treatment is absolutely unethical, unbearable and non-acceptable. We paid the full charge and what did we get?
1. Completely shabby, torn, wrenched sofa sets to sit and tables with sunmicas ripped and pierced as if they were rampaged by rodents.
2. ¬†The power went off for two times in the middle of the lunch.
3. The ambience of the room where the seats were provided to us was worse than that of a road side dhaba/cabin with scuffy walls painted and lighted in a very gloomy manner.
4. Now, most importantly about the food:-
¬† ¬† ¬† a. The starters were pathetic, extremely tasteless. Especially the Fried fish, and the prawns. Both were completely uncooked, smelly. And after consuming the prawn I personally felt very uneasy, and almost had to vomit out to get rid of the pain.
¬† ¬† ¬† b. The pizza that was served barely had a topping on it and was a full waste.
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†c. Now the main course- The quality of materials used in the biriyani was so low that an odour of burnt oil was very much predominant.

We had to fill our appetite only with the deserts which were the only good quality items that we got against the payment.

Completely dissapointed, heart-broken, money wastage and disastrous.

This version of Chai Break is a good combination of a cafe, a restaurant and a hookah place. Despite the mix of many cuisines, it does not appear or feel crowded, rather it is a well spaced restaurant with a mix of action and peace where one can feel at ease. They have a good mix of continental food as well as Indian food. Their cold coffees are good.

One of the most heard in sec v, saltlake... the place iz in rdb boulevard.. dont get confused by name.. its a buffet lunch or dine in place along with special beverage.. with a welcome drink we had starters as we colleagues went in happy hours.. the prawn, fish n chicken starters r quite good n tendered... the special aloo n sami kebabs r very good... they hav special chicken n corn pizza also as live counter dish... coming to main course the veg thai gravy iz really delicious, apart from soups we have chicken biryani, mutton roganjosh, chicken curry, fish curry special and indian dals n all, the dessert part iz little lagging in terms of totality of buffet. They have pastries, moose, n icecream along with gajar ka halwa n gulabjamun... but not that much quality we xpected in dessert like we got the quality in starters n main course... but the buffet value iz reasonable to its choice... you can have get together over lunch

If it's time for "adda" at Sector 5, it has to be Chai Break. I have been here with my friends several times and everytime I left the place with a smile on my face and a promise to come back. You are always greeted at the door by the staffs and each and everyone is extremely polite and courteous. Coming over to food, we tried chicken hot and sour soup, sweet corn prawn soup, schezwan fish, licky prawn (suggested by one staff member and it was really awesome!), salt and pepper prawn, cafe irish. I must say each and every dish was super yum! The ambience is very good, not very loud but perfect. Chai Break is a place for some quality adda sessions with good food to binge on! If you ask me "will i visit this place again?", my answer would be "more than often!"üëç

I always thought of this restaurant as some 'typical cafe' from its name. So never thought they have continental or Italian menus ! Went there on a dinner on a weekday . We ordered Crispy lamb on starter and Grilled fish on maincourse. Both the dishes were delicious and fresh. Also had two mocktails and hookah. Ambiens is okay.The service was not great. They served our starter and maincourse together so we had to request them to serve our maincourse later as it will become cold. Their washroom was weird too. Overall my food experience was good.

Coming to the food the starters were yum especially the prawns!!
They have 4 options of welcone drinks to choose from.
The main course is also delightful.I especially liked the biryani and raita.
Desserts were tasty..especially the vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce!
Pocket friendly and appetizing experience...would definitely visit it again!
Couldn't click a pic of the starters though!

Differentiating Them in trems of Ambiance food and service.I being unaware booked seat prior to my visit.They reserved the seat at their smoking area.

Quiet unexpected as there were much more spaces left outside then you should not reserve a seat inside smoking area as I have clearly mentioned in call about 'Lunch Buffet'.

For Ambiance its not at all neat or clean either. seating arrangements - chairs(sofa) are mostly burnt/spoked to holes (looks like burnt using cigarettes)
Not at alllllll clear..plates and glass looks so noob.
I don't recommend for a family lunch /Outing with your special person.And also the life risking smell of Hookah.

Service :- Seriously!!!! This boys really don't know how to serve.They served 10 starters within 15 mins.
"10 starters within 15 mins"!!!.Bhai Resturant chala rahe ho ya formality kar rahe ho.One senior most guy servicing with (dish name) your opinion and rest were coming in front of your table, serving even without asking if you need or not.

They were really pathetic at servicing which is nothing compared to Barbeque Nations.

They should train those boys who, without any doubt need to learn Resturant service etiquettes 101.
It was really too much for someone who have went for a date.
Worst ever service for me till the date.

Now the most important part:-
Food : So many options in starter,main course but their service spoiled my mood totally.Started with Welcome drink (lemon soda choosen) I would recommend to try chicken and prawn specially the prawn was toooo delicious.
Fish and veg starters were good but not upto the mark to satisfy a hungry soul , hunting for peace and bliss of tongue.
Crispy chilli babycorn is to some extent good.
In main course almost every item was delicious and so satisfying.
:-)
Must try - Veg polau kasmiri alu dam,Paneer item was avg.
In nonveg chicken biriyani with mutton will be the best combination.I would recommend everyone to try mutton it was perfectly cooked with KO combinations of spices It was brilliant.
I m good with the foods they served.

In dessert not so options but must try is

Payes (awesome),sandesh (ok).hot gulabjamun is also must try with vanilla ice cream.
Moreover average food quality but food was tasty (3.5/5)

Not recommended at all from my side for Ambiance and services.

Service :- ( -1/5) Ambiance (1/5)

Went there just for a quick evening hangout. 
They also offer buffet in Rs 499. Offering a wide range of starters and main course!
Ordered for some Shanghai chicken ,Shisha( double mint flavour) , and Virgin mojito. 
The Virgin Mojito was extremely good with a good twist of mint flavour .
The Shanghai chicken was the Chicken fries with Shanghai sauce and was with sweet and spicy flavour as it tastes üíì 
The shisha was well enough to go for 40mins with the same coke . 
Service was good . 
As well the ambience was spacious enough with wide sound of music .

Try out their wide range of shisha! ( Recommended)

If you are searching for a good buffet which is pocket friendly too this place is absolutely perfect! Food was yum. A little improvement in the service would be required.

We have tried buffet here . Non veg buffet cost was Rs 600/- per person for weekend lunch . In starters they had multiple options starting from different types of kabab (chicken ,mutton, prawn, paneer ) , chicken wings , potato bucket , chicken pakora , pizza , babycorn , corn pakora and many more . I liked chicken pakora , pizza , potato bucket the most . Only cron pakora and paneer kabar i didnt like . In main course they had fried rice , chicken biriyani , chilli chicken , mutton kasa , butter chicken , and seriously taste of all of these dishes was really good . Generally main courses in buffet use to be not so tasty . They had 3 different types of moose,  brownie , mango payesh , gulab jamun , vanilla ice cream . Those moose and mango payesh taste just awasm . I would love to visit this place again . Ambience was also good .

Visited for a buffet lunch with office colleagues.The service was a bit slow but they were catering more that 40people at a time.The staff is polite and warm.The decor is quite charming and colorful with comfortable couches and high chairs arranged in the sprawling space beside RDB cinemas.The starters have quite a variety from the paneer to chicken ,mutton kebabs, grilled prawns and mushrooms and grilled potato.The thin crust pizza for starter is worth a mention .On the other hand the pasta was just bland and tasteless.

Next we moved on to the main course ,a lavish spread awaited us.The chinese section had two variants of soup and salads,noodles,fried rice with side dishes of fish and chicken.The north indian section had naan ,chicken biriyani,plain rice ,dal.makhni,mutton side dish.The dal makhni was creamy and rich complemented well with the plain rice and papad.The biriyani was dry but the mutton side dish quite made up for it.

The dessert section sat near the bar counter with colorful cakes and tarts taking away all the attention.There was gulab jamun, ice cream ,tarts,mousse and small cakes.All the dishes were quite up to the mark.

Chai break is a place to visit with big groups

Mainly a restaurant for group outing. Ambience and set up is totally for group because of the sitting arrangements and loud musics. Food is very good, so many items in starter only like pokora, kebab, pizza, paneer and corn items. Main course also contains biriyani, plain rice, fried rice, two chicken items and mutton. Desert section is a total disgrace though. Just vanilla ice cream, gulab jamun, brownie and one special thing that looks so good but actually is a cup full of cream. But all over its a nice place to hang out with friends and have some food and hookah.
Food 4/5
Ambience 3/5
Service 3.5/5

Went there yesterday with a friend. The entrance is classy and in contrast to the huge doorway the interior seemed not so huge. There was a large main screen playing bollywood numbers supplemented by numerous led tvs so that ppl sitting at every corner of the restaurant could get a veiw.
Coming to the food part we wnt there by 12 and had to wait for apprx 20 mins for the starter sevice. And boy! It was definitely worth it!! First came the outstanding chiken pakoras followed by chiken tikka kebab. It was jucy succulent and tasted pefect ! And the pieces where huge and it was probably the best chiken tikka i ever tasted. Then came banzara aloo which was a waste and a nice paneer tikka. Then there was salt n pepper paneer, salt and pepper chiken which tasted well. Crispy chilly baby corn was just perfect and the corn used was just perfct young tender with a crunchy outer layer. The chiken wings tasted heavenly as well and then there were the tangy sweet corn balls that was crafted perfectly. Then came the shanghai prawns which were really tasty and they used large kingsized prawns coated in a batter and tossed in sauces. I had almost thirty of them. There was fish batter fry wich was so so as the fish used was not of good quality and the batter was of rice flour that made it crispy but didnt go that well with me. There was pizza as well, but it was a waste as the base lacked salt and they had used only mozzarella cheese hence it had the texture but lacked flavour. We had ordered a tropical blue and a fresh lime soda as welcome drinks and didnt regret our deceision.
The best part of the main course was perhaps the chiken soup which also had egg stirred in to it along with other ingredients that make it taste out of the world!! It was probably the best soup i ever had! The raita was of the perfct consistency and we had papads too. The dal makhani had a minty taste and that annoyed my senses otherwise it was good. Khadai paneer and chilli paneer was nice. And there was 1 or 2 chiken preparations in the main course that i didnt taste but i tasted the chiken biriyani which had the right flavour but lacked salt. The mutton rogan josh was well cooked the mutton was tender but they didnt prepare it probably thats why it was kindof smelly and i couldnt enjoy a fair share of it. There was veg fried rice which was nice too. We asked for butter naan that was served at our table. It was nice but the dough used was oily so basically they used paratha dough to make it ,i guess. They had plain rice as well.
Coming to the desert section there was a gajar ka halwa which was awesome followed by a rather basic (and cold) payesh. There were 3 varieties of mousse and and a rather dry overcooked on the outside and undercooked inside brownie. We finished the feast with huge dallops of vanilla icecream dripping with chocolate sauce and mind it guys it was real milk ice cream not the frozen desserts forged out of vegetable oils.
The service was also good and the ambience heart warming. Each dish was different from the other in terms of texture colour taste and feel. Those hu have a thing for buffets usually expect quantity over quality - we consciously accept the fact that buffets dont serve dishes that hav the taste and feel of those ordered on an a la carte basis but not for 1nce did i feel that i was compromising on my taste as many of the dishes tasted better than their various versions i have had earlier on an a la carte basis. Though i am bit bit sad for the mutton dish but i could enjoy the other dishes thoroughly enough not to lament mu6 on the mutton one. Each dish was prepared with care and was really unique.
The glitches that i noticed can be forgiven cuz other wise my experience was rather a pleasant 1. I had high expectations from this restaurants and they did surpass that but on my next visit i hope i can expect more from them. They can surely procure better quality of fish from the market than that they use, make the banzara aloo more flavourful, work on their pizza and definitely replace the payesh with gulab jamuns or nythng else. The service was warm enough and it only costed Rs 1060 for two nonveg buffets due to an early bird offer and that adds up to the excitement :-P . Would definitely come back for the awsum buffet!

Standing next to Barbaque Nation (Sector-5) , the best buffet restaurant in town , you have to keep your standard high. And it seems they have tried a lot and are quite successful at it.
Boss 1stly good that they have created a buffet which is different from barbaque nation. The place was even more filled than BBQ and it was dam crowded on a Sunday afternoon.
We were given a smoking area where you can order a HUKKA and chill with your food.
Now we went with nearbuy coupons which made us pay 569 per person for the buffet and for others it was approx 600.
The serving was late but you can't complain,the guy tried his level as the place was daam crowded.
Starters are served at the tables and it included a lot and by lot I mean a lot of items
Fish batter fry(amazing), chicken pakora with meyonase, chicken wings,chicken tikka, chilli prawn,baby corn, stuffed potato, panner tikka, pepper chicken, pizza slice,veg pasta(too good) and non veg pasta.
You are served a drink from 4 options( blue lagoon,masala coke,coke, sweet lime).
The fish batter fry was so good we two had almost 30 pieces to ourself. The starters were hot and nice except a few.
Now the main course was limited to a few items and frankly speaking we had little space in our tummy as well.
The main course is a separate buffet which had naan/roti ,salad,fried rice,dal,panner item, chicken biryani which was very less spicy and mutton roganrosh .
The desert section had kheer,icecream (only one variety metro ice cream) , assorted mouse , brownie (which was finished and they didn't even refill that) and gajar ka halwa.
Overall for 569 ,amazing buffet and will surely come again. And the staff behavior was good too.
TOTAL PAISA WASOOL

Lots of starters with unexpected bad service ..... The waiters were serving food as if they were in a hurry to catch a train ... 

The welcome drink was served almost 20 mins after the starter was served.

The buffet was good with lots of dishes ... The ambiance was so-so ...

But highly disappointed with the service. While we went to take our main course keeping our starter plate on the table it was cleared off with all the starters in the plate. This was not expected ..... b

Very Bad Experience ...

Had gone for their buffet lunch.Wide range in buffet. The interior is average.The service was good. they serve the starters at table. There were 10 of those mostly chicken, one from mutton,fish and prawn, pizza, pasta, corn etc...I would give a 4/5 for startes. The main course spread was pretty flat,nothing special to mention.fried rice, non veg soup, mutton preparation were tasty . I would give 3/5 for this.¬†Few options in desert counter..Some creamy desserts are decorated in shot glass with different flavors from where only one tastes good.gajar ka halwa was good.. Only one flavor of ice cream was there & that is vanilla. Nice place to have lunch at reasonable price. Recommend for a buffet dinning.

Worst place ever. The behavior of the stuffs are so bad I must say. When we entered they forced us to sit in a separate room where hookas being served but we went for buffet actually. After that we decided to leave but another waiter told us to stay and sit as where we wished. Food was good undoubtedly but they should maintain proper hospitality to their customers. Not only that at the end of our food when they saw we took ice cream and almost the end of food they told us if we had done we could leave as they had bookings . I mean seriously???????Anirban Pal

One of the best buffet places in Kolkata. Without naming the leading and popular buffet places in Kolkata, I would say Chai Break is much better than the popular ones. They pleased us with their wide range of starters ranging from their Chinese oriental starters, Italian to Indian starters. Best thing was each and every starter were hot and tasty and freshly prepared. Really Satisfied with te food they served there. Main course and Deserts were also upto the mark. Must visit to break the monotonous visits to the popular buffets in Kolkata.

Situated at the sector 5 salt lake area. They had two separate sections for sitting (one for hookah lovers) . Ambiance was pretty cool, and they had  cute colourful decorations there. We ordered BBQ chicken pizza with one lemon iced tea and one chocolate shake.They were playing excellent music. Simply we had a great fun, spent a quality time there. Most importantly buffet is also available here.

Well, although it's one of the most popular IT people. I was not much impressed with my lunch today.

We had Peri Peri chicken pizza and grilled stuffed chicken.

The pizza was good(3.5/5). Thin crust somewhat like pizza huts big pizza. Quantity was huge

The grilled stuffed chicken looked appealing but didn't taste good at all. The chicken was hard and cheese stuffing could in no way enhance it's taste. Neither the salad, spicy potato or the sauce tasted nice.(0/5)

Decor was beautiful. The counter decorated with different types of wine glasses and bottles. (3/5)

Service was good and friendly

I would probably not go there for the second time

The ambience is nice.. we went for an evening hang out not a bit hungry. One of the hottest Kolkata day and quenching thirst for some cold drink made us order two cups of cold coffee but somehow both tasted same. So we are not sure till date whether they had the same taste or they covered their mistake by saying they were different orders. We also ordered the Shanghai chichen which was good and quite spicy. Will like to visit some other time and try the other items from the menu.

It was just a casual outing and ended up being to this place on. It was sunday afternoon so more people were there for buffet . Ordered mortadella pizza .. the taste was good but the toppings were very less. Broccoli Onion can be counted on fingers. Since the taste was good so decided to eat .... Pricing is standard , taste was good , staff was bit rude i thought. Yes we finished our food but that doesn't mean they pick up my plate without even asking me. He was so hurry to get order from us as if he has to rush. .  Service was late .. . Overall experience average.

Been here twice with my friends. If you enjoy eating at buffets and is tired of live grills of BBQ joints then you should definitely give this place a try. The starters were quite good. It included chilli chicken, lemon pepper chicken, pastas and pizzas. 
However the main course and desserts are pretty ordinary and lacked variety.
The service was very slow and took a lifetime to bring the pizzasüò™.

I went there on Monday for the lunch buffet.... As usual the restaurant was pretty empty for obvious reasons... Since the service was quite good and prompt... The staff was quite well behaved but not highly groomed... The ambience and the decor was quite ordinary... It was giving a semi cafe look... The pink wall on the right hand side of the restaurant was the worse... It was looking quite cheap and unattractive... Speaking of food... Pretty decent spread as compared to the pocket pinch... The food was just above average... Some of the starter dishes that stood up was the chicken tikka, fish batter fry, chicken pakoda... I would really recommend the restaurant to remove the salt and pepper chicken as it tasted really weird... The pizza also needed some improvement... In main course the biriyani, mutton roganjosh, chicken curry was quite tasteful... The Oriental and the Continental items looks below ordinary as it was really struggling in the chafing dishes... So didn't taste it as well... Moreover it was a pretty good experience... I would return to this place only during pocket stresses... As the city has much better buffets if you pay just a few more bucks...

Starters are too much to concentrate on the main course. Biryani was awesome comparing with other famous Mughlai restaurants. As per my opinion Mughlai dishes are too good but the Chinese dishes are weak in taste. Service is good. We got early bird offer as we reached before 12.30 pm, so we paid 1082 (for two persons), otherwise the buffet costs 600 each. Overall its a great buffet in Kolkata.

Amazing ambiance good service but the place was totally empty on a Sunday afternoon and it's surprising considering it is in sector V hotspot. The food is overpriced but considering the rent in the are it was justified and the food was also good.... We had masala chai, hot chocolate and virgin mojito plus french fries so I really can't comment on the rest of the menu . But whatever was served was upto the mark and well prepped. Might drop in again to try their mains , looks tempting.

The place has an OK ambience. I didn't try the food here but did try the Huqqa. It was the worst Huqqa I ever had. Not @ all smooth and made well. The service was crap as well. Cz whenever we would call anyone to fix it, they would come, blow some smoke and go. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone for Huqqa. One Huqqa and a red bull costs approx Rs. 800. Totally not worth it!

I went chai break with my colleagues for a buffet lunch.  Visit the chai break in salt lake sectar V area. 
The starter count is count and some of them tastes good.  But they serve the starter too fast one after the other.  And they do repeat it.  
The main course was so so. The mutton does not take good. The desert counter ends as it starts.  You guys should increase the desert item count and make the food quality better.  
I will think next time for visiting that place.

One afternoon while I was teaching my student before her exams, she decided she needed a little pizza party before finish with her studies.
She was very fond of this place so we ordered in their margarita pizza with extra cheese via swiggy.
It was delivered to us in less than 30 minutes.
Fresh out of the oven, the pizza was a life saver.
It was quite big and had a lot of toppings.
It was freshly baked and had thin crust.
I loved it too.
Will I visit again- We keep ordering it in every time they decide to have a mini pizza party !

GREAT TASTE + OSSOM SERVICE + AMBIENCE + LOW PRICE + MUSIC .
These are the five elements which this heavenly restaurant is composed of.
A person whenever wants to visit a hotel , wishes exactly of something as perfect as this particular restaurant.
Welcoming and cooperating staffs , who will treat you as if you are the only guest inspite of large crowd of customers already there.
Perfect positioning of food items , repeated cleaning of floors , tables ,etc.
Coming to food .
chicken salt and pepper ,
crispy chilli baby corn ,
chicken wings ,
prawn chilli ,
fish fries ,
panir ,
pizza slices ,
pasta ,
haryali kabab ,
seekh kabab ,
chicken tikka ,
1 soft drink ( I tried lime soda)

main course -
I was already full, I just took mutton biriyani and a papar but there were a lot of things there.

dessert -

mousses - 3 varieties
gulab jamun
bundiya with khowa
some sweet whose name I did not know , but it was yummy.
icecream with chocolate sauce
brownie.

above were the items that made my day. Please plan your bufet ASAP friends.

BEST PART FOR THE PAYERS....Its just 601 including taxes. Probably the best option in Kolkata .

Nice place but just for short visit.
Not a weekend party place
Good interior and average service..
A place which serves good food
Their closing time is a plus point as it closes early morning..
Overall good experience !

This place is pretty big and has a separate section for hookah . Decor is appealing and creative. I liked the lamb roghan josh here. Rest of the dishes like soup and starters were okay in taste. Overall a nice place to relax in the corporate area of sector 5.

Well this was a nice time spent with a office treat... Had buffet in there.. I would say the experience was Nice.. Nothing up to the mark or outstanding.. It was nice.. Buffet price range was affordable and the quality of the food was good, but only the non veg starters. Veg once sucked to be honest. They do serve pizza at starters but the quality of those were pretty mediocre. One of the starters that stand out from others were prawns.. Those were really great.. I mean if u love fish then u will not stop eating that. Main courses were so so.. Ambiance of the place were family like.. Though i went on for lunch only.. Hope that gets better at night. All in all a not so bad experience to be honest..

Loved this place! I loved the compartment style table setting and the high chairs. I had gone their with my office team and we had a blast. The food was amazing. Special mention would be the Thai green curry. It was so tasty I can still remember the taste :)

They had also given us free mousse after our huge lunch but I was so full by the last round I couldn't put much in.

So much recommend this place. It is no doubt a costly place, but it's every bit worth it!

Have been there like million of times and still not even a single day i can recall where i was not delighted to be there. Their shisha is unbeatable & the most amazing thing due to which customer repeat is maximum here is customer satisfaction with their food service and overall hospitality.
My favourite person there are shahid and afsar ali.

We entered early and left after we felt that we can move. The temperature outside and an upset stomach did not deter me from having one of the best meals I had in recent times. To put things to perspective, I even ordered a second helping of the vegetable starters, something which I would have never dreamt before, being someone who only loves vegetables which is served along with a non veg food only. The number of starters in one word was overwhelming, probably more than 10 (and I am being modest from their end) and there came a point of time when I wish they didn't have had served us sooo many varieties of starters. To be honest, due to my aforementioned physical condition, I had to make serious consideration for my main course, which also was pretty good. The biriyani was light while the mutton kosha was lip smacking. Any flaws? Yup, the brownies got over dude üòú. Overall, it is a great place to have a budget buffet with your friends as you get a lot more than you bargain for at a very reasonable price. Would love to go back in the near future.

went there with 4 friends ¬†after bbq nation slapped a 1 hour waiting time on our face and the music in another place was just too loud. Was apprehensive; but pleasantly surprised. We ordered starters and main dishes from Indian to Chinese to continental; and all came out delicious. Service was prompt and polite. Even my adventurous foray into saffron tea was well rewarded. Will visit many more times, happy to have discovered the place by accident.

Chai Break has one clear advantage than any of its rivals, it has more open hours than all its neighbors. The decoration is a refreshing change and really adds to the ambience of the place. The high rise tables are also dynamic detour from the stock sofas and chairs. The staff is very polite and are at your service at the tap of your foot. Addons like Hookah section and Live Sports screening make it a great place to be in. The food quality can be much better, but hey you cant ask for any more when its about those 2am binge eat cravings. Decent place, decent option, great service.

Visited today in the evening for snacks. Although it was quite empty still it took like ages to serve the food that too a starter.. I had ordered for a crispy chicken..,the chicken was soo very crispy that it was even barely chewable... Even waiter spilt out the food on the table while serving.. No spoon and forks were given... I had visited this place before but it seemed that their quality and service both detoriated over time.

The lunch buffet at Chai Break deserves a thumbs-up. The food looks good and tastes even better. It‚Äôs located at the ground floor of RDB building, salt lake, sector-v. 
The buffet includes a long list of food items:

Starters:

Salt and pepper chicken
Salt and pepper paneer
Crispy chilli baby corn
Chilli chicken dry
Chicken tikka
Chicken hariyali
Pizza slice (thin crust)
Chilli prawn
Fish fry¬†¬† 
¬†
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Main course:
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Manchow soup
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Chicken pasta
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mutton biriyani
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Fried rice
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Chilli chicken
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Chicken tikka gravy
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Mutton roganjosh
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Raita
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Dessert:
¬†¬†¬†¬† Vanilla ice-cream with chocolate sauce
¬†¬†¬†¬† Gajar halwa
¬†¬†¬†¬† Brownie
¬†¬†¬†¬† Assorted mousse (flavours- strawberry, chocolate, orange)

The paneer and chicken starters were delicious. The fish starters however lacked that mouthwatering taste. Moreover they had a typical smell. Having stuffed our stomachs with repeated servings of the starters, there was indeed little space for the main course. Yet we had to taste each and every item. The soup and chicken pasta were great. The biriyani was good and the fried rice average. However the side items were very well cooked and tasted delicious again. In the end, the classic vanilla scoop with brownie is a heavenly relief particularly after a highly fulfilling diet. The gajar halwa and the mousses were average.

Now coming to the things apart from food; the d√©cor is eye-catching, trying to give a different appeal. The service is quick and the staffs are hospitable. And yes the price is attractive too, approx 600/- (tax included).

Overall, Chai Break deserves repeated visits.

Visited there for their renowned lunch buffet comprising of a big list of starters. The starters were good both the chicken n fish items and I also loved their corn. When it comes down to the mains ...we hardly had any room for them after stuffing ourself with the starters specially the kebabs on repeat but still tried some biriyani n mutton rogan josh. The mutton was good n so was the biriyani. Lastly the dessert part was okay comprising with mousse, ice creams and gulab jamun. Overall it was a good experience.

First of all this place is Pocket friendly..specially for college students!!  :) :)
Ambience is very good.Staffs are also very friendly.
Now the most important part..food.
They do have variety of starters, but don't expect that all of them would be amazing. Kebabs/chilli prawn/paneer/fish are really good. They used to give pizza in starter..but what I feel that pizza is nothing but one light cheese layer over a Tandoori Rooti :P
They should check/change/improve this item..
In main course biriyani/mutton Rogan josh is quite good..
In desert section I didn't find anything special..it's same(ice cream/cake)

Overall I would say..this place is good. You can go for it..most importantly it will pinch your pocket less!!  :) :)

Visited this place for a team dinner on a Tuesday night. They had their usual buffet spread.  They do have a wide array of starters from which to choose from. But do not expect all of them to be amazing. To be honest, some of them were decent enough. Especially the fish fry, crispy chicken, chilli prawn and paneer. 
Coming to the main course, the biriyani and chicken tikka are what tastes good, according to me. 
They dont have a vast spread of desserts. Usual ice cream, gulag jamun, cake and mousse.

Cost effective buffet.
14 types of starters, which will make you full, even before you look at main course. The starters include chickem kebabs, fish crispers, paneer kebabs, Gobi Roast, Chicken BarBQue Pizza, Chilly prawns, Mutton Sheekh Kebab, crispy chilly babycorn etc. And, they also serve beverage with the buffet, which is not refilled like other items.
The Chilly prawn is absolutely my favourite starter of all, its tangy, spicy with the right size well cooked prawns. The pizza too was loaded with cheese and olives. The fish crisper was flat and lacked taste. But the paneer was soft and great to taste. The maincourse looked very appealing but we were full after the starters, hence stuck to salads and soups. The pasta salad was great but the manchow soup needs more depth of flavour. The maincourse had array of items like biryani, Chicken reshmi butter masala, fried rice, fish gravy etc. The desert needs more upliftment, as in it needs more item. There were three on buffet. 4 flavoured mouse, gajar ka halwa, and vanilla ice cream
 The mouse was light, but the halwa looked very unappetizing and tasted equally bad. 
Staff is cordial, but slow while serving starters.

To spend some time with my besties we decided to give this place a shot after reading the reviews on Zomato.
The decor was nice and the sitting arrangements - a combination of comfy sofas and high edged chairs - was quite good.
We had ordered Kitkat shake along with Alfredo Penne Pasta and Four topping pizza. We loved the lip-smacking pasta as it was creamy and also the Kitkat shake. The Pizza seemed like a regular one to me as we felt that there was a dert of cheese. But my friends found it quite nice.
The staff was courteous and we loved the welcoming nature of them. Not to forget, we were served a complimentary dessert which was really tasty.
We were quite satisfied with our choice and will surely drop in again.

Which was turning out to be a great lunch with family, ended up with somewhat an unexpected end. The food (starters, main course, and desserts) was pretty good. The staff and their behavior was also nice. So, we were pleasantly eating and chatting our hearts away. However, there is more to it than meets the eye. I mistakenly (as I thought it was), left my shades inside the restaurant and went out. When I realized that my shades were missing, I went inside the restaurant again to check if it is lying somewhere. I checked the table where my family sat. It was empty and also devoid of any shades. ¬†I spoke to the staff there requesting if they find my shades will they be generous to give me a call. Upset, I drove out of that place only to receive a call momentarily stating my shades are nowhere to be found.

Irritated yet polite, I asked them they should have it somewhere inside since none of my family members seems to have my shades in any of their bags. The man on the phone assured me that the staff didn't take it anyway. After a lot of convincing and a strict tone from my end, he got convinced that he needs to check with his staff again. ¬†Within the next 20 mins, the man called again only to confirm that my shades are found and since it was lying on the floor, some member of the staff picked it up only for safekeeping near the buffet counter. Hilarious, as it sounds, there was no shades in the buffet counter or table when we left the place. So, ¬†it is but obvious someone from the staff had other intentions and unwillingly was forced to accept the shades was found there.

Today, when I got back my shades, it has scratches on the left glass. it looks bad and I believe I will never be able to wear it again. Is that a treatment customer should receive from a place like this? Thoroughly disappointed!!!

Worst service I've ever come across. Despite ordering a shisha, a coal change and 6 beverages, the waiter kept trying to force us to order more, telling us 8 people can't sit there while ordering that little. Did not provide us with filtered water, thereby forcing us to also purchase a bottle of mineral water and rudely asked us to leave the premises, as they have some kind of rule that no one can sit longer than 45 minutes in the restaurant with a single hookah. This happened even though we kept our cool and were fairly polite until they tried to push us out. Cannot recall ever having been treated like this as a paying customer, before this. Would not visit again if it was the last restaurant left standing.

I have heard about Chai Break a long ago but didn't find enough issues to visit and lastly my friend took me there. It was an afternoon when me and my bestie went there. I was eager to have a taste of their food.
We opted for buffet. Starters and appetizers are very good and we cruised through our lunch, we felt no rush or wish to migrate to maincourse, as we are totally satiated with first blow of tasty offerings.
All dishes were, very properly made and served with courtesy and care. 
Ambiance is alright and completes with a television set. We didn't entered hookah parlour so, pardon me for any suggestions.
The only thing that is a concern is their lack of enough menu in the maincourse, which lacks sheen due to heavier starters. Please, care for maincourse.

Had an awesome meal. As usual a bit costly for regular hangout. But had my first steak. It was nreally nice. Tasted almost 8items. The kaababs are soft as marshmallows. Amaizing atmosphere.celebrated friends birthday bash. Sitting arrangements were a bit cozzy. But i guess this sort place are like this. Polished! Nice experience.

Hearing the name, "Chai Break", I initially thought this to be a place for tea like the Tea Junction located nearby to this place. But the menu card took me by surprise. This place has a variety of things to try, from Pizzas to Pastas, from Tandoori to Soups, Noodles as well as Rice. We hopped in here planning to have tea but ended up having Milkshakes. We had a Chocolate and a Strawberry Milk shake. Both were delicious. They say that they blend the ice cream to make the shake. That's why the shakes were thicker than usual.

Totally value for money!  Service is brilliant! Coming to the food all the straters tastes very good, specially the chilli prawn. All the kebabs are delicious. Main course is also good. In desserts they have very limited options so I think they need to improve here only.

One night after our movie we visitd this outlet of Chai Break for dinner as it is open till late at night.As we entered I found the ambience to be good enough and the place was filled with people however the music being played could have been better.Coming to the food we ordered the Fish & Chips and Grilled Chicken,the food was good the fish fillet was crunchy and soft inside and tasted good,coming to the grilled chicken it also was good in taste and tasted like any good grilled chicken with a big chunk of chicken and veggies.The service was okayish it was a bit slow otherwise it was fine.

Though the name is a misnomer, the place is quite good. I tried the buffet yesterday and they had a lot of variety to offer on the starters. The items I liked were the kebabs, baby corn, prawn etc. Unlike BBQ Nation, the starters here varied from kebabs to pizza. The main course was also good, with mutton curry being the best. Kaali daal was also good. However, I feel the veg items could have been a bit more. So can be the desserts which lacks variety. Overall quite good for buffet. I haven't tried other stuff like drinks or hookah.

It is located at the ground floor of RDB, Sector 5, Salt Lake.

Ambience is cool, colourful  & refreshing with ample sitting arrangements.

Staffs are friendly with nice service.

Tried Four Cheese Pizza and fresh lime soda. Pizza was palatable and soda was refreshing.

Pocket pinch is on a bit higher side.

I went with friends for just the Shisha and some vegetarian sides to go with it owing to the fact that my friends were pure vegetarians ! We had the kiwi and milk base shisha which was good . Then we tried the Sweet corn balls , Cajun spiced Potatoes and Mint penne pasta with lemon vinaigrette ! The Cajun spiced potatoes were the best but we found a hair in it which was unfortunate . We were compensated for it by cream shots . So all in all it was a good experience . Enjoy .

Chai break was actually my friend's pick and I must say that im glad i agreed to join her here. This place actually has one of the best buffet and that itself is testified by the long queue of people waiting for their turn outside the restaurant. This is personally one of my favourite buffet places. The service is a bit loggy due to the heavy traffic but the food is worth the wait!

One of my favourite places in Salt Lake city. Maybe the only place in salt Lake where you can refresh your mood even at 4 am. Last time to place order is 4:30 am. Visited like a million times and still love to visit every time. People will love the ambience especially after 10 pm. If you're speaking about hookah then the name "chai break" says it all. Affordable prices and friendly staffs. It's the no. 1 place on my list if I'm planning for a night out.

We went there after reading the good reviews, but were very disappointed with their overall foos quality. It seems like the restaurant is trying to serve all mind of cuisines, indian, oriental, continental and have clearly messsed up their recipes!!
We ordered
1. Cilantro Chicken, which I can bet had lots of green coriander leaves paste instead of Cilantro! The chicken was very hard, like it's been cooked, then got cold, again recooked. We were unable to cut it wuth our knives!!
2. Same goes for Grilled chicken, which was so hard, we had to throw it away.
3. Never try micktails here, they are a joke!! I ordered Virgin Colada which was tooo sweet, has too much coconut?!? and hardly pinapple. It was horrible.

Don't waste your money here, at least local eateries serve better grilled chicken than this fancy outlet!!

The waiters were rude and they deliberately served the food late so that we could eat less as the time was less. They gave only one slice of pizza when we demanded for the whole. Pathetic service. Never going again for a buffet.

Great Hookah place! Loved their food dishes well. Overall a place which guarantees a gala time with your group.

This place stays open till late in the night. So when we went here on a Sunday night around 9.45pm the place was still half empty. The ambiance of the place is really good! Especially liked the square booths for seating and the TV screens along with a large projected screen! This place would be great for watching a match with your bunch of friends.

In hookah we ordered Vanilla with Ice base and Teen Pan with Milk base. They have a policy of charging incrementally for coal changes(like many other places) which I don't appreciate much, but still the hookahs were great!

In mocktails we had ordered Sweet Lime Soda and Virgin Mojito. Sweet Lime Soda was standard good whereas the Mojito tasted like iced tea...it should have been better.

In Food, we had Cheese Fondue, Chilli Cheese Toast, a Paneer starter and honey chilli potato. Food was really good! Especially Chilli Cheese Toast & Cheese Fondue. I wish they start serving additional portion of just the bread since most of the times it so happens that you run out of bread before the fondue gets over.
Later we had brownie with ice cream which again was standard good.

Service was mostly good. They have a large staff. Only sometimes we had to remind them to get our dishes as they took extra ordinarily long time. Also this place isn't heavy on the pocket either..making it all the more appealing!

I went to the kakurgachi one as that was near my place.I was unaware of the fact that they serve only vegetarian food.The ambience is great food was good.We ordered a cappuccino and one kesar chai.It was good. Then for a light snack we ordered mushrooms delux which was filled with cheese and served in a unique manner.The only thing i think should be reduced is the price .I think personally that it is a bit expensive.

Decorations are average, hosts are very good, foods quality are mixed for different dishes, buffet is not so good; but starters are a little bit better than usual, also more in type (probably the best part). Sitting arrangements is ok type (good for small group, not congested, and separated in cubicle), also average ambience. Wait time is also more than normal. Need some improvement in food part if it wants to compete with neighbourhood restaurants. Good location if you want to grab a quick lunch or dinner in nearby area. U can try it once if u haven't been here already... Who knows u may find ur taste here!!!

This is located near BBQ in RDB building at sector 5, salt lake..actually we planned for BBQ, but because of shortage of space(since it was a team lunch outing), we went to Chai Break..Smart interiors, good ambience, comfortable seating with good surround sound system(best part of this place)..coming to food..ordered buffets (499+tax)...chicken kabab, fish fries, paneer, aloo, mutton sheek kabab,etc.almost every item (though there was lesser variety) was horrible in taste...in main course only mutton gravy and chilli chicken gravy were somewhat worth eatable...Special mention their pizza was horrible, they were not baked properly(my suggestion don't ever try this..dominos, pizzahut, ect make far better pizzas)...coming to desserts, there were only these desserts -- halwa, icecream (you can understand their so-called wide range of variety)..all in all, not a good experience food wise and cherry on the top was the callousness attitude of the waiters (few of my colleagues ordered repeat of some starters which arrived like after ages, even after asking for it numerous times)...NOT SO GOOD!!

We went to this place in an office party with 30 of my colleagues. We opted for the buffet. There were one complimentary mocktail. There were a number of non veg starters like chicken tikka kebab, chicken hariyali kebab, salt and pepper chicken, wok fried chicken wings, mutton boti kebab, fish batter fry, chilly prawn, chicken pasta, chicken pizza. Also some veg starters like crispy chilli baby corn, salt and pepper paneer, banzara aloo, tandoori gobi. All the starters tasted good. The main course were okayish type. The chilli chicken and chicken biryani were awful. Mutton Rogan Josh and chicken tikka masala tasted ok. They should have more varieties in desserts. There were only gajar ka halwa, 3 types of mousse and one vanilla ice cream. Overall satisfied for the taste and varieties of starters.

I went for a team outing to this place and the experience was fair enough, the factor which I dint find to be good was the seating arrangement which personally I felt is uncomfortable.The buffet had variety of starters and really well cooked and soothing to the pallete, the staff behaviour and the hookah section alongwith the ambience of the place makes it a perfect place to visit with friends and collegues.The management should focus on the seating arrangement though and the music collection of them ;) 

Good Stuff!!

Well whats available inside indeed justifies the name of this restaurant cum bar cum sheesha lounge....I've been here 4 times as far as I can remember and the Darchini Masala Chai is my all time favourite and probably one of the best teas I've ever had in my life...It comes in a glass mug of sufficient volume and the taste will keep you mersmerised till the last sip....As far as food is concerned I've tried the Resmi Kabab and the Tomato Basil Soup ¬†here and I would say that it is good but nothing extraordinary..I've also tried one of their mocktails named the Sweetheart which tastes as good as it looks....Today, I tried their hookah (A candy flavoured hookah) and all I can say is that I've had better hookahs at lesser expenses...The smoking room is itself a bit suffocating and I feel something should be done about it for a better hookah experience...The decor is really creative and would definitely catch your eyes...service is okay but staff gestures and behaviour should be more respectable..As far as the pricing goes,it is a bit expensive...So, order carefully.....I would recommend Chai Break highly for their teas, my favourite being the one I have mentioned earlier....

Ambience: Good seating available, you have an option of normal sofa on the inside and barstools & chairs on the outside. Lively music, not too loud. One can make conversations easily.

Food: Food is above average, a variety of options available. Separate Hookah lounge available, no alcohol served.

Service: Courteous and attentive staff. I had left behind my debit card and they kept it safe, I was able to collect it the next morning.

Overall a good place to go after a party, best part is they are open till 5am when most of the places are shut down in Calcutta. Convenient for residents of Salt Lake.

Since it's just opposite my office, I often go there for team lunch. The lunch Buffet has a good spread, around 10 items in starters veg and non-veg together.I liked their starters compared to the main course. Prawns, chicken and fish were served as part of non-veg starters. The dessert though did not have varieties, just one flavour of ice cream, gajar ka halwa and mousse.
The ambience is good for a hangout with friends or family.I felt they were serving the starters too fast and not enough time was given to eat.
The ala-carte is comparatively on a expensive side.

on 7th December 2016, we went to Chai break for team lunch. The ambiance was good, some good music was there to enhance the mood. We were given the first sitting place. The chairs were too tall to be comfortable. The service was a bit slow.
In starter, we were served the following:
1. Salt & Pepper Chicken - Chicken pieces were moist and soft. A light sense of freshly ground black pepper was complimenting the chicken.
2. Fish batter fry - It was served hot. It was average in taste as the fish was not too good in taste.
3. Paneer starter - Paneer was tasty and soft.
4. Chilli Prawn- Tasty. Prawns were cooked rightly.
5. Mutton Seekh kebab- This one could not impress us. This kebab were a bit dry.
6. Chicken Tikka kebab- Good and tasty.
9. Hariyali Chicken - Good and Tasty. the coating masala was really good.
10. Chicken wings - Average in taste.

We also had Chicken Pizza and Pasta which were as usual. One fact which bothered me was the taste of the pizza dough. It tasted more like cream cracker biscuit.

The variety of the starters impressed me and the particular taste of each of the dishes made it worth to come to this place.

In the main course, we had:
1. Chicken Biriyani - Light and tasty. I liked it.
2. Chicken Tikka masala- it was very tasty.
3. Mutton Roganjose - It was something which needed to be mentioned. The mutton pieces were so smooth that those melted in mouth. the gravy was a bit salty for me but my attention was caught by the mutton pieces. Those were lovely and a must have.

In the dessert section, the choices were limited to only Carrot Halwa ( texture was good and it tasted very good), Chocolate mousse ( smooth, chocolaty and good), butterscotch mousse( it was not that good according to my taste buds) and only Vanilla Ice cream. Too much mousse was boring for me. This section really needs some improvement.
The waiters were good and their behavior was also very good. Only thing which I badly need to see in this restaurant is the height of the chairs being small. Otherwise, I would like to visit this place in future as well.

We were in a group of four and reached chai break at 1:30am and as expected we had to wait for 5 min to get our table. The ambience was nice and the lounge was well crowded. We ordered two hookah at first then after some time we again ordered 1 hookah. By the end of completion of 3rd hookah the time was 4:20am approx then we agin ordered another hookah. We didn't even were able to finish the half of the coal they asked us to leave as it was going to close after some time. We were regretting for ordering the fourth hookah, we were also upset that the staff members could have told us about the closure timing. We would have saved 500bucks. Otherwise it was nice to be there. I have been there 8 to 9 times but never regretted being there.

Found this outlet bigger and better than the last one I visited in Southern Avenue. Chai Break has been serving a variations of stuffs. You can call this outlet a cafe, a restaurant or maybe a hookah parlour. All under one roof. Oh, buffet too. 
Pizza was good.
Hot chocolate decent, (magpie being my favourite) not close to that though.
However, the services could be faster.
And price, lil on the higher side.

Well, thy name is quite misleading ‚Äì but as Shakespeare had said ‚Äì ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in a name‚Äù.

The name ‚ÄúChai Break‚Äù basically suggests this as an evening snacks junction, but on close scrutiny, we realize that they serve everything from breakfast to lunch, from snacks to dinner, from buffet to a-la-carte, from breads to biryani, from mocktails to cocktails and from sheesha to sharaab!

My 2nd stint with their buffet lunch today led me to conclude that they have somewhat declined in terms of taste as well as variety! A macro analysis of the buffet is published below:-

SOUP:-

Veg Manchow Soup ‚Äì Served on table with a garnish of deep-fried crispy noodles, was initially served cold and replaced hot on request. Was tasty with decent veg content, but spice content somewhat on the higher side.

STARTERS:-

Banzaara Aloo:- Crisp aloo stuffed with dry fruits and other veggies ‚Äì fine

Tandoori Gobi:- Huge chunks of Gobi tandoorified ‚Äì not tasty though

Salt and Pepper Paneer:- Beautiful cottage cheese cubes marinated in oil with spices sticking to it and served with salads

White pasta:- Tremendous ‚Äì superb on presentation as well as taste

Pizza:- Cute slices baked with corn, babycorn, onions, lots of cheese, ketchup and what not

Mint chutney:- a nice combination of mint and curd (P.S. ‚Äì I requested them to serve it in a big bowl ‚Äì as I enjoy it a lot)

Mains:-

Dal Makhani:- Good, not great

Butter Naan:- Fluffy and tasty

Paneer Butter Masala:- Very nice, special the gravy

Mix vegetables:- a complete turn off

Raita:- A nice blend of cucumber, onions and curd ‚Äì served cool

Papads were served on request

Veg Fried Rice:- Mind blowing ‚Äì 1 of the best I ever had

Steamed rice:- Steaming Basmati ‚Äì good one

Thai Green curry ‚Äì I just tasted a morsel, as I do not really like Thai food ‚Äì was tasty, nevertheless.

DESSERTS:-

Choco chip souffl√©:- Superb, pick of the desserts

Butter scotch souffl√©:- Fine

Vanilla souffl√©:- Okayish

Gajar Halwa ‚Äì A major turn off, special, if it is served cold

Metro vanilla ice cream with liquid chocolate:- A winner as always

MOCKTAILS (Restricted quantity ‚Äì 1 per person):-

Tropical Blue ‚Äì Tasty, but overdone with ice cubes, hence rendering it watery

Service is superb, so is the ambience. They do have a dedicated area for hookah smokers, so that others in the vicinity are not bothered.

They do offer an early bird discount of 10% also.

To conclude, they provide reasonable starters and desserts and an average main course.

Visited here frequently since my college is situated here. Dont know where to start. It used to be good but these days it has degraded a lot. Today the hookah was terrible. It kept on choking even though i asked for them to fix it. But it didnt help. Still choked. Ate peri peri pizza today and it was good. Please fix your hookah. Not good but still i gave 3.0 ratings.

My points is 4.5. Chai Break is a places were you will find the atmosphere quite nostalgic. The hoists are also pretty nice. But the food which is the center of everything was not up to the mark, but the starers were really good. The arrow comes down at main course. Its a good place altogether but one time is nice. it is open all night long so all the night crawlers are quite welcome.

Chai Break. Was kind of excited to visit this branch.

Alas, the ambience is really dull. Hate the blue lights. They take away the entire glory of the interiors. Hate the music here too.

Food tried -¬†

Fondue
Wedges
Four Cheese Pizza
Alfredo Pasta
Cold Coffee

Pizza was okay. Cold Coffee was horrible. Returned it once, twice, thrice. Failed to make it alright. Had to ask them to replace it with a Strawberry Shake which was OVERLY sweet.

Word of Advice - Your blue lights take away the entire fame of the interiors ! And please experiment with the music genres and kindly teach your chefs the recipe for Cold Coffee. :)

The pasta and pizzas are top dollar, and no wonder you have solved a lot of peoples late night chilling scenes.
But the music is in dire need of an intervention.
The cajun spiced potatoes were little bitter burnt balls and even on returning it your staff forced me to pay for it.
Also the chicken wings were a nightmare.
Tasted like a tandoori chicken met KFC midway at a roadside beguni stall !
Its cardinal sin to call this a chicken wings !!

Came here 2nd time after a gap of year.
Food and ambience was good.Service was good.
Food was buffet and was approx Rs.600 including tax.

Last time we had planned to visit Barbeque Nation which is next to this place.It was crowded and we had to wait.Then we thought instead of waiting ,let's give Chai Break a shot....

We did not regret our decision.

Buffet has plenty of options from starters...ma7in course.. .and sweets.

For todays visit I liked the the Prawn amongst the starters,Mutton Rogan josh in non veg main course,green veg thai curry in veg main course,and Gajar Halwa amongst sweet options

We also had complimentary mocktails options.We choosed Fresh lime soda...which was good.

Overall  we enjoyed the experience and recommend this to try  with family abd friends who wants to enjoy food without bar options....

Chai break is situated salt lake sector-v near RDB cinema. Basically it is a buffet orriented restaurant .ambiance is good with soft music and decoration is natural. I have visited with my friends for lunch buffet. Staff behavior is good and very helpful and they are served staters item.when we were entered the restaurant a complimentary drinks are available for us. Here the staters menu like - chicken pepper salt, prawn, chicken garlic sauce, panner pepper salt, chicken pizza, pasta, chicken tikka, horiali chicken and fish butter fried and also chicken soup.  All of those item very much delicious and  tasty and mouth watering .
After that main course available like- chicken biriyani chicken tikka masala, mutton kasha, fried rice, chili chicken etc. We are tried chicken biriyani and mutton kasha. Chicken biriyani so much light not oily type. 
Last of all desserts like -cake,gazar halua ice cream with chocolate sauce etc 
Price is so much reasonable . Only lunch buffet 600 including all of taxes. 
My suggestion is everybody must try here for lunch buffet.

Went there for buffet lunch last week. We had to wait for 15 minutes even after having reservation.  Upon settling, we started with the soup, which is not recommended , at all. Then came the starters, the chicken dishes were nice, but nothing great. The prawn was too oily, and somehow they managed to ruin the natural taste of prawn. The mutton seekh kabab was plain bad. The best starter of the day was the fish Orly , or whatever they call that, it's basically the same thing. 

We skipped the main course as it was the usual chicken biryiani and mutton roganjosh and they were nothing extraordinary. The desserts had a muffin (basically the local cup cakes) with 3 different jelly dressing, three kinds of mousse which were great , vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and gajar ka halwa. Considering the amount (600 including taxes) , this was rather a disappointment. I have had better buffets and especially the desserts section, with greater variety and at lesser price.

Visited this place during Durga puja. They serve excellent starters. It can easily match BBQ Nation in terms of starters. Main course and desserts are a bit weak especially if you compare with BBQ Nation. But there is a huge difference in buffet price too. Buffet includes chicken,mutton,prawn. Since i am more interested in starters including kababs and have a small appetite in most case, i am unable to focus on the main course. So this is a perfect restaurant for me.

Possibly the most despicable outlet of the chain. It's looks extremely shady, the service is beyond horrible. The waiters are rude and refuse to make any change whatsoever blatantly. Moreover most if them are happily chugging on the hookah in one corner with no concern for the world. The food taste is good, but that doesn't make up for the other shortcomings. Horrible experience.

We went for a team lunch from office and had the lunch buffet. The menu was standard one with some twists... The starters consisted of Indian kebabs and tandooris to Italian pasta and pizza. All of them were of moderate taste n well cooked. The main course downplayed a bit. In the desserts department it was average and it consisted of only vanilla ice cream, gajaar ka halwa and mousse. Still it was worth the price of 600 all inclusive

we went from office for a team lunch. we opted for buffet which is 600 per person. ¬†The interior is average. The seating arrangement is also suited for small groups. If you go with a big group and want to sit together then high stool table are only option. The service was good. they serve the starters at table. There were 13 of those mostly chicken, one from mutton,fish and prawn. Those were tasty and specially the size of the prawn was very good.i would give a 4/5 for startes. The main course spread was pretty flat,nothing special to mention. I would give 3/5 for this. However the dessert spread was simply bad and do not deserve more than 2/5. Gulab Jamun was very hard and gajar ka halwa was just average. Some creamy dessert decorated in shot glass with different flavors wer there which only looks good. But because of starters you can consider going here.

Heard a lot about this place. And last night, I convinced people to go and experience chai break. Reached there by 1AM. Luckily we didn't have to wait, and got one table. 
Firstly ambience is awesome if you love to chill out, we were there till 3'o clock in the morning and atmosphere was like evening, people waiting outside , each and every table was occupied. Loved the vibes and charming nature. Music videos on large screens, people taking hookahs, white rings - 'let's enjoy the life' mode! 
Staffs are really cordial. We ordered rice nan chicken items , and still they kept coming to us and asked if we need anything. Though they made a slight delay but staff came ,informed and served mousse. 
Nan was very tasty, pea rice could be better, chicken items good as well. 

Chai break is awesome, I loved the vibes and was astonished to see people waiting outside to get a table at 3'o clock. And it's a safe place also,I think , saw many single girls also coming. I enjoyed , so it's 5out of 5!!üòä‚ò∫

Chai Break Sector V is a good place to take a litle time out from busy life and enjoy food. Ambience is quite and good over here. Food specially chicken preparation was very tasty and easy to swallow. Compared to chicken fish butter fry or baby corn is not much of a good choice although they come in the buffet plate. Considering the buffet meal it is good and value for money. Service is only thing that I would not say is rather good. If you order something it will take a hell lot of time to serve.

Visited this place last month as a colleague's treat, was not sure about this place which mostly lied in shadows of the neighbouring Bar B Q Nation. But this place turned out to offer good food. The chicken hariali kabab was the pick of the list, while the dessert section of the buffet menu mainly disappointed due to lack of sweets. Overall the staffs were well behaving and ambience was quite unique with its old days decoration.

Good food to tickle the taste buds,nice and co operative staff,waiting time in b/w foods is something that they should improve on,ambience not like the other Chai break branches. Must try are their thin crust pizza and cheesy pasta.Their non alcoholic range is just too good.

Went here for a team lunch (buffet). The restaurant opened a bit late so we had to wait for a while. The place is quite small, so they couldn't fit us all (10 people) in one table. The staff was quite indifferent to us, and at times ignored us completely. The only reason I'm giving 3.5 is that the food was good. I loved their pasta and fried chicken. But the dessert was not up to the mark, with limited options.
I liked the blue interior and the artsy wallpaper. Pics on my Instagram account - @shradhanjalirai

The best or next best after Barbecue Nation but cheapest i would say. 11 kinda starters half of them are non veg and lip smacking.¬†
Best budget buffet in town. Main courses with Mutton Biriyani, chicken and fish in north Indian sauces. Deserts comprised of 6 types of pastries and cookies ¬†. OHH and Icecream too. I forgot the welcome drink they offer. A thumbs up. I rated them 4.5 as i believe they can improve the serving time of starters.

This outlet of chai break is located in the RDB boulevard building and is a great place to hangout with friends and family. It remains open till 2 o clock in the night which is a great thing. The decor is  quirky and has a very happy and fun vibe to it.The staff is quite friendly and courteous. The hookah available here is good and the food is  tasty as well. The price is a bit on the higher side but the quality of the food is great. Surely a recommendation for some great time with family and friends.:)

Late night out and hookah is all about chai break. Coffees are good. But can work on the food and should keep hookah and food sections separate. Over all its a good place to hang out.

Chai break is what I believe is direct competitor of barbeque nation . It tries to offer almost everything 
as that provided by the next door restaurant and to be honest I did not want to compare the two but I was pleasantly surprised by the food quality over there. There is no live counter over there and the seating area is a little awkward with no tandoor placed in the tables. Everything is served but the food is really nice. From the kebabs and chicken wings. However the competetion falls flat in the desert section. There is hardly any options over there and that's the reason why I am rating it 4. But make no mistake this is a good buffet restaurant at a very compelling price.

This is a regular joint for people like us.  It opens at 11 Am In the morning and remains open till 5 Am of the morning.  Hookah here is really good. They offer Chinese and Indian food. And of course we ordered Chinese food. Along with that we ordered Cappuccino and Cold Coffee. Hookah was Brain Freezer. No complains.

Tried out this franchisee of Chai Break last night with friends. Located in the office para of sector v this place is a winner already. The decor and interiors are average with two different sections. The seating plan is well done and it looks spacious and comfortable. We ordered for cafe frappe and royal tea initially. The coffee was good but the tea was refreshing. The kesar added to it enhanced the flavour and taste of the tea.  We went on to order grilled stuffed chicken and I must say it's very very good. The perfect blend of the sauce and the fried potatoes added to the taste of the dish. The garlic bread we ordered came in thin crust form... It wasn't as per our expectation. Later we ordered Thai chicken which was very hot and spicy. The pepper prawns were really good. We also ordered for grilled fish in white sauce. It was very nicely cooked and had a lovely flavour.  The beetroot  soaked in vinegar was yummy. The hookah took a lot of time to settle. We ordered Brain freezer flavour. It was very strong and the charcoal was hitting the throat. The waiters managed to settle it after much effort. Initially the music was good but suddenly it turned very loud and later they connected the music system to the television which made things worse. The advertisements on the television were not mute and it kind of created a noise pollution. We requested the waiters to lower the volume but nobody paid heed. We were forced to leave the place after a while.

Yesterday we have a family party at Chai Break. It is just beside the Barbeque Nation at Salt Lake sector V.

From outside it is a simple one with a silver door. Actually at first we thought it is side door of VLCC. But when we entered it is like a different world. with a soft blue light the feel is just sooooo romantic.The guys at the restro are very helpful.

We started with Cafe Hazelnut and Chocolate Monk

In starter we tried Wok fried Chicken wings spiced in Dip & Chilies. In main course we have Cilantro Chicken , chicken makkhanwala, Grilled stuffed chicken with Pudina paratha .

In dessert ¬†it was chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream and Chocolate sauce.

Overall it was a great experience. Those who want to spend quality times with their buddies and just love the continental cuisines oh man its your pilgrimage. Hit the place buddy.

So a friend of mine took a bunch of us for treat to this place. Sunday lunch buffet. The place is located in the RDB building at salt lake sector 5 and is very easy to locate. I've been told that during weekdays  there is always a huge queue outside the place but since we reached bang at 12 on a sunday, it was comparatively empty. It's a big place, nicely spaced out with a separate hookah area. The eating area has separate booths which gives people privacy. Once we reached we were escorted to our booth since my friend had reserved a table beforehand. For starters we were served crispy baby corn, cauliflower fry, some veg starter with potatoes and cashew nuts, fishy butter fry, chilli prawn, chicken pizza, reshmi kebab and chicken tikka kebab, crispy chicken fry, chilli paneer, mutton kebab. I personally liked the fish fry and prawn dish. However the baby corn was far too tangy and the paneer was chewy. The starters were served by the attendants and they seemed to be in a sort of hurry. They would not let us finish one dish before turning up with a new dish in hand. That was a bit annoying. For drinks we had opted for fresh lime soda. In main course, they had: rice, biryani, chicken tikka, mutton roganjosh, pasta, dal makhani, paneer butter masala, some other sabzi. The pasta was a huuuuuge let down. It was undercooked. The biryani was quite nice and the mutton was well cooked. The rest was quite mediocre, nothing worth a mention. At one point one of the waiters came and told us to wrap it up as people were waiting outside which I thought was rude as I could see a lot of empty tables. For dessert there was: mousse ( chocolate, strawberry and kiwi) , vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce and gajar ka halwa.
The spread was satisfactory, but they need to pay attention to the attitude of how the attendants behave with the customers not just initially, but throughout. Also more attention needs to be paid to the main course.

This one is pretty lovely place with nice ambience and great quality of starters. I had been there for a team lunch buffet . They served 13 or 14 starters which included chicken , mutton , fish , prawn , gobi , potato . The main course was so so , that's I preferred to stick to the starters . Dessert was minimalistic but was good enough to please my taste buds . A must go place just beside BBQ Nation.

If I segregate between starters and main course and Mark 2.5 each,my rating will be 2.5/2.5  for the staterrs. And for the main course it would be 1/2.5.
Hence a total of 3.5. 
Coming into the starters there were chicken tikka Nd hariyali which were really good, they were soft and was made from leg boneless which are nowadays very much unlikely in buffet restaurants. 
The wings were good to taste but was little tough to tear,may be a little overfried. 
The chili prawns was the hit of the day. Good sized prawns and very well cooked. The chicken salt and pepper was good but I feel lacked a lot little flavour and punch. So was the panner. The cauliflower was okay okay type ,felt flat. Rest everything was okay,but acceptable.
Now the main course. It really disappointed me. I know thier focus stands to be on the starters but that does not mean that you tend to ignore the main course.
The biriyani was very dry very very dry and the chicken felt like boiled chicken.the buttermasala chicken was flat and was over tangy and sweet. The chicken was not tasting fresh. The most disappointing part was the mutton,it was tough, fibrous and felt very very very blant and just like boiled pieces with no taste and anything. I was really dissatisfied and disappointed with the same. 
Bieng a huge foodie, I am sorry for bieng too critical, but this is exactly what I felt.
And one more suggestions please if possible try to reduce the amount of fried starters that you are offering. It otherwise kills the apetite.

Went there for some snacks. The food was good, but I simply hated the concept of serving hookah in the normal section of the restaurant. I believe they have a separate hookah smoking area, but somehow that was too crowded and they served hookah all over the restaurant, which I hated and any non-smoker would. Nevertheless, the food was good and so were the staff...

Visited this outlet last week for Lunch Buffet and here goes my review.
*AMBIENCE*
The decor of this place is certainly offbeat. With colourful walls having multi colored caricatures, to a pleasantly eye catching Tea Studio, this place definitely sets the ambience apart from other restaurants. The restaurant has two seating options, one being the conventional table chairs and the other being high raised tables and chairs. The high rise table is what we chose to sit at and trust me, the feel was exquisitely pleasant. 
*FOOD*
Here for Buffet, there is no Barbeque or Grill arrangement. The waiters serve you the Starters on your plate. There is a complimentary welcome drink for your buffet which comprises Lime Soda/Thumps Up/Sprite. 
For starters there is Paneer slices, Salt and Pepper Chicken, Mutton sheekh Kabab, Chicken Hariyali Kabab, Chicken Tikka, Chilli Prawn, Fish Butter Fry, Baby corn, pasta. All the items were good to taste, but Salt and Pepper Chicken and Fish Butter fry deserves a special mention. Those were mouth watering and we couldn't help but ask for a second serving. There was also a slice of Pizza served alongwith the starters.
For the Main course, I tried Chicken Biriyani and Pasta salad, both of which were made perfectly well. 
The dessert section had few items which included two varieties of Mousses, Vanilla Ice Cream with Chocolate Syrup and Gajar ka Halwa. The halwa was okay to taste.
*SERVICE*
The service was quick and prompt. 
The experience at Chai Break was good enough to pay a second visit to the place. The food is definitely value for money. Happy Eating!

The name caught our attention when we went to BBQ Nation and so we decided to go to their lunch buffet the next day. The seats looked comfy but were not. It was too bright for my liking.
Now the food: The starters began to come out cold and hard. By the time we reached the third item, our palate was gone. From then onwards, everything was probably just heated and brought to us. The chicken and prawns were too chewy. 
We saw a cockroach on our table, right beside my plate and asked the waiters to shift our table. A little later my friend saw another cockroach behind me at the second table.
The mutton Roganjosh was really good. I would recommend it even with my bad experience.
The ice cream and gajar ka halwa were also pretty good. 
One of the waiters serving us was busy watching TV. Other waiters came and rebuked him in front of us. When I asked him for a spoon, he told me somebody else is getting it. I waited for five minutes, after which he probably finished watching television and went to get my spoon.
On our way out, we let the manager know about the cockroaches. He offered us a membership at Chai Break. Rest assured, I'll not be using my membership card anytime soon.

Don't go by its name.Its not just a tea shop or cafe.Chai break ,just situated next door to Barbeque Nation can be a competition to the later.
We went mostly for team lunches. We were being served complimentary drinks,starters and we need to serve our self the main course and desserts.
Coming to the food,the variety is little less than barbeque nation ,but the taste was good. There are lots of starters to start with,which can leave you with a packed up tummy.So plan well before you binge on the food.
FOOD- 3.5
Ambiance was good,with two high rise tables for teams and other seating arrangements too.They have hookah section too,with guitars hanging on the wall and colourful wheels.

Located beside Barbeque Nation in sector V this Chai Break outlet is quite famous among office goers for its cheap lunch buffet (499+tax/).

Service and ambiance was good. Staffs were friendly..

They are offering many items in lunch buffet, from mouth watering kebabs to fish butter fry..
Biryani to pasta, pizza to mutton roganzosh...

Dessert was 4 types of mousse and choco vanilla ice cream..

Very much satisfied...

Went there for the lunch buffet!
It was a Sunday and was quite empty for the Sunday afternoon hours. The place is well decorated with very unconventional stuff. I think the place is a little too bright, given the decor. I quite like the high chairs, but if you're a hogger and have come here for the buffet, I urge you to seat yourself on the comfy sofas.

Now the food. The food is nothing new, the hariyali kebab, fish batter fry, chili prawn, tandoori, paneer and the other regular stuff. Nothing too noteworthy saving the fish and the prawn, because they were fresh and good in size. Now the main course, the mutton was great, tender and juicy like a roganjosh should be. There was fried rice and chilli chicken which was extremely ordinary, the exotic veg was decent, biriyani was there but opted out of it. The pasta salad there was cold like Shit and was difficult to chew, too bad. Now the dessert is what I loved. The vanilla ice cream was from a good brand, the delicious gajar Ka halwa and the well made mousse was fantastic to end with!

Overall a satisfactory experience! Better if you catch the early bird offer!

Well.. this was a sudden plan visit to this joint for meeting my old best school friends after around 2 years..they are staying in us. And so it was a long time we met with each other.. did not get a good place to just have some good food and chat a lot.. so there we go... nearby my office at DLF 1 and common place for both of them... !!! we gave this a try.. !! coming to the food quality was quite good..tastes were awesome.. we did try 3 different mocktails.. all were really refreshing.. we started with fish n chips.. it was awesome.. the prawn item named Leeky prawn was juicy and topped with mayonnaise and cheese tasted awesome but was a bit salty. The Fish skewers I.e. the one in stick was damn tasty with the tartare sauce provided. Then we just ordered mixed noodles and chilli chicken and a fish in garlic sauce.. the food quality was really good and the quantity was suffice for the 3 of us.. really had a great time.. great place to chat and have fun.. !! Ambience was quite impressive as it also have the option for open style hookah. ..!!

Quite a good place to be with friends and enjoy some Mocktails and Hookah. I had the watermelon iced tea and it was really awesome & very refreshing too after college. Speaking about the ambience, well it was kind of okay okay. Coz the interior decoration and the Mocktail bar was quite great but inside the hookah lounge the couches are very uncomfortable.. Neither you can reach the table nor you can stretch your feet properly. Another thing is that , when we visited I saw around 4-5 small cockroaches inside the lounge on the side walls. 
The Chinese bhel was not good at all. And was mixed with ketchup and stuff which we didn't like at all.

Yes, please be shocked!  This is my rating because of their's  rude behaviour and hanging over the head attitude!  I was there with my group around 1 am, just to chill out with my friends without letting them miss their Euro cup finals. But I was not aware of their terms and conditions i.e you gave to order food on Sundays,  only hookah will not do good.  So we ordered cold coffee and one kitkat shake along with French fries. After 10 mins, they were back asking anything else or they will get us the bill.  I again asked for the menu, and just then one brownie with ice cream crossed my seat, I suddenly had the urge of having it so I asked for it.  But the waiter said it's not food, we will have to order food because of their huge waiting list. As far as my knowledge goes dessert Come under food.  Disgusted by their behavior, we had to leave!

This place has been quite a perfect place for office parties and large scale buffets... 
Trust me guyzz food is top notch and is much cheaper than Bar-B-Q Nation.. 
Starters are fantabulous and desserts are xceptional..üòä

Chai break is awesome restaurant in saltlake sector v..We opted for buffet course for 100 heads for corporate dinner.
The service was good.
Hukka bar is also alluring..
Starters are the main attraction here.
All over good food along with good ambience..üòáüòáüòá..
..in comparison to barbeque nation chai break  offers better accommodation for bulk dinner.

This is the first time I visited chai break along with my hubby for lunch. 
It is quite easy to locate.. It is near infinity building.
The ambience is nice, but the volume of music they were playing should be a bit low. Though the songs are nice.
Talking about the food, we ordered chicken sweet corn soup. The soup tasted nice. But they don't serve schewan sauce, soy sauce, green chilli in vinegar along. When we asked for it, dey gave chillies N soy sauce but they didn't have schewan sauce ..instead they served some weird kind of green chili sauce. They called it Tabasco sauce.
Then grilled chicken was served. It was flawless.. Anyday I visit again, I will make sure to have that.
Then we ordered chilli garlic noodles. It was okay but could have been better.
The virgin mojito was nice.
Though the place is good but have scope of improvement

Located just beside the barbeque nation, on the same row as of rdb boulevard in sector v saltlake, this outlet is much spacious and has a nice trendy decor with helpful, friendly servers. Coming to the food and beverage options, food menu is precise with handful of choices. We were mainly focused on hookah today as we were full already. The coal got exhausted much faster than normal (maybe there was some problem), we went with the classic brain freezer without much experimenting.
The noodle salad or chinese bhel was not upto the mark, it was less crispy and was soggy with excess of tomato ketchup it seemed. The best part was the watermelon and lemon iced teas they definitely refreshed our mood.
Its missing few points in my rating because of the mighty little friends who accompanied us during our whole "hang out", which was a couple of cockroaches(That was disgusting company). But we enjoyed the music and hookah along with our drinks within our budget that is the reason for my positive rating.

Perfect place to go into after having a ball at some nightclub or if you just wanna spend the night out. Right in the heart of RDB Boulevard, anyone can spot. Chai Break pretty easily. 
We stayed back for an hour more that we had plan to. Ordered hookah, a few chocolate drinks and a pizza and pasta and oh yes, noodles. The noodles were mind-blowing. Only thing I didn't like was that the music was too loud to talk to people and it was bad music. You don't wanna listen to crass songs at 3am. Okay some good music and everything else is sorted.

The best buffet at most reasonable price i ever had. They served variety of starters including C delicious hinese and kababs. They served pizza and pasta as well in starters. Their main course was also delightful. Being a super foodie i wanted to try everything atlst single pcs each.. But failed..
Anyway i enjoyed a lot their economic buffet compared to others.. Which is cheaper than others tastier than others

In short not a great experience.
This place remains open till wee hours hence had the potential of being a crowd puller but they messed it up big time.
Reason: They play loud lousy music which sounds really sleazy. Hence the crowd which comes to this place is not great at all.
The food is okay and the service is good.
They have a good choice of hookah and good choice of food. The food taste good.
However the ambiance and the music are the spoilers.

"Chai-Break."
The name sounds like a place where one can visit anytime in between hectic schedules of the day; only if you don't mind spending too much for a cup of hot beverage or a tall glass of mocktail.
From cajun spiced crispy baby potatoes to
cheesy cream penne pasta and stir fried chilly garlic noodles (chicken),from the usual virgin mojito to oreo cold coffee, from brownie break to orange mint virgin mojito;have tried it all.
The flavors in the dishes were well sorted whereas the mojitos and brownie break can win hearts!
The sheesha added a sidekick to the motive of passing time. The green apple teen chillum and the mint chillum were not as strong as they claimed to be. The mildness of the hookah could be made out as it didn't hit so hard. The mint was still better,if not the one to definitely go for.

Note 1:
The staff behavior is weird.
They are more friendly in helping you out to select from the menu and wishing you every time with a smile if you are with a gang of girls.
The alteration in behavior from friendly to straight face was observed with subsequent visits and in company of different people.
Strange is the world and its ways üò∂

Note 2:
Chai Break can get you from normal to broke real quick if you literally go by its name and expect the prices to be too less.

Opted for the buffet on a sunday afternoon. Amazing starters- chicken hariali kebab,tikka kebab, chicken salt and pepper, wok fried chicken wings, chilli prawn, batter fried fish, paneer salt and pepper, crispy baby corn, tandoori aloo, tandoori gobi, and mutton seekh kebab. All starters were phenomenal except the mutton seekh.also the chicken pizza was nice n thin crusted. Didnt like the pasta much. For main course i tried the chicken biryani(unlike all other buffet biryani, this was actually good kolkata biryani), nice and creamy raita, mutton roganjosh(too oily for my taste), amazing chicken tikka masala. Ending was a sad affair. They have a very limited dessert spread. Vanilla icecream, chocolate sauce topping, gazar ka halwa(yumm), assorted mousse( coffee, saffron, coconut). Mousse was light n fluffy unlike other buffet places. So almost everything tasted good. Only wish that they would just increase the dessert variety. As they say 'all well that ends well'. When u are not satisfied with the dessert u tend to dismiss all the other things u liked. Happened to my friends :p
Best part- early bird offer even on sundays :D

Garlic Bread with Cheese, looked more like a pizza, but taste was nice.
Choco mint shake was amazing, the taste of chocolate milkshake with the punch of mint was awesome.
Sweetheart coffee was also good.
Cilantro chicken, the chicken was a bit undercooked but the taste was really nice.
Overall a really nice place to visit once in a while....‚ò∫

-- Review- Chai Break | Sector-V | Kolkata

-- Over All Rating: 3.9/5

-- Location:

Sometime all we Techies need break from coding, need some refreshment. :)

There are many options, we have for changing our mood but the easiest one is ‚ÄòHappy Eating‚Äô. There are time constraint for serious coders as well so what we require is a buffet within range and which is near to software township. That‚Äôs the reason we this time choose Chai Break which is the adjacent place of the famous Sec-V Barbeque Nation.

In weekday we book a buffet for 32.

Chai Break has two seating arrangement.

‚Ä¢	Hookah Zone ‚Äì It has seating capability of 31 people and my team is consist of 32 members so booked that place. Ambience is good, Guitars in wall, giant screen is also installed. 

‚Ä¢	Restro Area ‚Äì Its pretty bigger than Hookah Area. 

As I booked a day before we got a discount (Early bird)in our Buffet, the cost for each was 549 INR inclusive taxes but there is T&C like before 12:30 we need to confirm how many people is coming.

Rating: 4/5

Let come to the point what for all of you are waiting :P

--  Welcome Drink and Starter:

We like to have welcome drink as beer but as the Restro has no bar license still now so we choose Fresh Lime Soda instead of cold drink. But the drinks was n‚Äôt that good :P

They are 6 Non Veg starter (3Chichken + 1 Fish + 1 Prawn+ 1 Mutton Starters) and  6 Veg Starters, and in the end they is a delicious pizza. I took two slice of it and it was so tatsy that I forget to take snap of it :) .

Rating:  4.1/5

-- Lunch Buffet:

Appetizer part (Soup & pasta) was so so what I felt. 

Main Course:

‚Ä¢	Jeera pulao

‚Ä¢	Mix Vegitables

‚Ä¢	Daal Tadka

‚Ä¢	Paneer Masala

‚Ä¢	Biryani with Raita

‚Ä¢	Chicken Tikka Masala

‚Ä¢	Muttn Rogan Josh

We had superb Biriyani (Yes they put ‚ÄòAloo‚Äô/‚ÄôPotatto‚Äô in Biryani)with Raita with Mutton Rogan Josh ÔÅä

Rating: 3.8/5

-- Dessert Item:

Mousse and vanilla icecream were there and lastly I had ‚ÄòGazar ka Halwa‚Äô which is really up to the mark.

Rating: 3.8/5

-- Hookah:

After taking some rest 3 of my close colleagues(including me) decided to take a Teen Paan Rose hookah with red bull base. Hookah that we ordered last for long (near about 30 mins).

Rating: 4/5

-- Note:

1.	We need to let them know how many people are coming, if there is any late comer in group count them as well let them know ÔÅä they will allow him/her to join with you and they will charge only the early bird price. But if you order is confirmed for a certain number  before 12:30PM IST then you need to pay for certain amount if any one misses the event then also you need to pay and if anyone more than your confirmed head and after 12:30 then you need to pay the normal buffet charge( the ‚ÄòEarly Bird‚Äô Discount will not work).

2.	It is near to Narkel Bagan, Rajarhat (within 5km).

3.	Value for money.

The interior of this outlet of Chai Break is absolutely different from that of it's other outlets. Simply loved it! This cafe is spacious with high-rise chairs and comfortable sofas. We preferred chairs. The lighting was perfect with some good music at the back drop. We chilled over a glass of Kiwi feedo-deedo, KitKat shake and chocolate shake.

Been there for an office team lunch. Must say, the food was awesome and price worthy. We opted for the Happy Hour Lunch Buffet. The complimentary drink was damn good. The Buffet contained 8 kinds of non-veg starters (which included chicken, prawn, mutton and fish) and 3 kinds of veg starters. Pizza and pasta was served too on the table. There were too many options for the main course. Out of them Biriyani and Mutton Roganjosh are must try. However, there were less number of dessert items. If there were more veg starters for the vegetarian people, it would have been nice. The service was also good as the interior ambience was. I would love to revisit this place.

After discussing for a long time finally we decided to go to saltlake chai break on the last saturday. Heard a lots of mixed reviews about the place. We entered the place at 12:15, so got an early bird discount. Per head buffet cost was 541 including tax. The ambience was quite good. sitting was very comfortable. 1st they served lots of starters at the table. chicken boti kebab, chicken wings, corn, paneer, fish butter fry, mutton something, pizza, pasta lots of different varieties were there. They served a complementary drink with the starters. among the starters corn, kebab and the prawn was awesome. mutton starter was not that good. coming to the main course, it had plain rice, fried rice, chicken biriyani, chilli chicken, chicen gravy something and mutton rogan juice. But again the mutton was not so good. Rest was okay. many veg dishes and soup was also there. But mainly they lag in the dessert section.only gajar ka halwa, suffle n ice cream (just one type, that also vanilla) was there. The restaurant is just beside BBQ nation. They may have lots of varieties, but the food quality can't be compared with BBQ. But at such a low price, we can't expect more than this. Overall it was a very good experience.

After a long discussion with my Project Manager I could finally convince her to take our team for team lunch here. She had a big doubt on me which was resolved after our lunch. Great interiors with pleasant music. We had opted for buffet which costs Rs. 540 if you can reach before 12:30pm and Rs. 600 after that. They served us a complementary drink named blue lagoon. The starters comprise of a large variety of kebabs, pizza, pasta and chicken man-chow soup. The main course is good. Dessert section has less item but for the price you pay it is more than enough. I loved the place and visit it again very soon.

Let's start with the items we tried:
1. Hot chocolate
2. Orange mint virgin mojito
3. Cranberry bliss
4. Mango rapture
5. Harissa chicken skewers
6. Penne in Alfredo

The hot chocolate came with extra chocolate sauce in a tequila glass. The cranberry bliss was decent. The mango rapture was pathetic. It came with a mint flavour. Nobody in our group could stand that. The orange mint virgin mojito was refreshing and by far the best mocktail in the lot.
The harissa chicken skewers has 6 skewers. The chicken was a bit dry. The flavour was good and it came with a very interesting and flavourful sauce.
The pasta tasted really great. No complaints there.
Ambience : the music wasn't very loud which is a plus because we were able to hear each other and yet have a pub like feel, which is what it should be. The decor was fancy but wasn't unique. The ceiling was weird and the blue lights made it impossible to click decent pics.
All in all an average experience. I wasn't wowed.

Luncheon !! Saturday !! 499+ taxes !! What better than Chai Break.

It was overwhelmingly crowded. And we had to wait for quite a while. Strange, the place was lacking a receptionist. But on waiting further, I found the receptionist in the kitchen, maybe because it was a peak hour and he had to help the staffs out there. 

Anyways, it was worth the wait. The entrees were full on gobsmackingly delicious. Right from the Pepper Chicken to Dry Chilli Prawns, I loved all of them. Special shout out to the Prawns. They were heavenly. The kebabs were juicy and it all tasted great apart from the Mutton Seekh Kebab which I found to be little off the place. The thin crust pizzas even seemed okayishlly good. So, we had so much of the entrees, that we decided to skip the mains for good. But I did try the Pasta Chicken Salad. The chicken was exceptionally dry and the salad had too much of mayo in it. The desserts were even average. I tasted the Mango Mouse which I found to be heavily scented and the Gajar Ka Halwa was a bit bland. 

The staffs were well mannered. Special mention for the decor and the ambience. I sort of loved the purple-y dim lights.

Overall, an average experience. Would visit once again for the entrees and to try out the mains.

We went for a office party to Chai Break. After hearing the name, we were a bit skeptical about the ambience. But, once we entered, it was nice and cosy. The high tables are actually quite nice and good if a lot of people want to sit together. They serve buffet during lunch. But, on request, they arranged buffet for us for dinner. So +1 on customer centricity even before we got there. 

Regarding the food, they had 14 different kinds of starters. Trust me, other than the pizza, every bit of it was excellent. The Pahari murg, Dhaniya Paneer Tikka and SarsonMahi Fish Tikka deserve a special mention.¬† The Chilli prawns were too good. We were practically filled with the starters and tried out the biriyani alone for main course. Strangely enough, unlike most other buffet restaurants, it was not pan friend. The handi biriyani was quite good. Coming to the desserts, there are not many options. They had gulab jamun, ice cream and three different varieties of mousse. The mousse were excellent. Eah flavour was better than the previous one. 
The staff were extremely courteous and helpful. I would definitely like to visit Chai Break again....and that too very soon.

P.S. - No idea about the hookah bar. We did not try that out.

The place located on RDB boulevard has graceful interiors, spacious design and courteous staffs. There's lot of variety in buffet menu. Starters were really good- special mention for chicken wings, hariali chicken, crispy babycorn, stuffed potato. Starters itself makes you go full. The other thing to my liking was gajar ka halwa.

I visited this place with my friends after a movie at rdb. The first impression was that an insect was crawling over our seats. So it was a bit of a turn off. Coming to the food, we ordered grilled fish, risotto and Shanghai chicken. The grilled fish tasted really good. Chicken was ok while the risotto could have been better. Service was good till now. We ordered cola after food. Now they took an enormously high amount of time to serve that God knows why. Apart from this, our experience was good.

Chai Break - Spreading it's outlets.
=====
Location + Intro:

It is located right next to famous Barbq Nation, Salt Lake.

I had been in this area and went to visit this place with one of my friend. I really liked the main entrance. As i entered inside, i planned to sit in the hookah smoking zone. I personally felt that the inside zone was below standard as compared to the usual chai break outlets. Blue normal lights and dimness. I personally did not like it. It was more like cubicles where family and friend's can sit and sip a coffee, enjoy the food or puff up some sheesha. Nevertheless, i took my seat and started off ordering.
=====
What i ordered:

‚Ä¢ Shanghai Chicken - The portion served was really very small as compared to the prices charged. I personally loved the taste but there should be enhancement of the portion size. It was pocket pinching.

‚Ä¢ Gum Supari Sheesha - We ordered the usual gum supari sheesha. It was smoky and lasted long.

‚Ä¢ Lemon Iced Tea - It was nice. Soothing and refreshing.
It had the perfect sweet as necessary.
=====
Pros:

‚Ä¢ Chai break is more of a brand now.
‚Ä¢ This outlet of chai break serves non vegetarian food as well.
‚Ä¢ Enough seating capacity.
‚Ä¢ Staffs are courteous.

Cons:
‚Ä¢ Ambience of the hookah section is quite dim. I personally did not like it at all.
‚Ä¢ The chicken which i ordered was quite less on portion with respect to the prices charged.¬†
=====
Meal for two: 700-1600 approx.
=====
Summary:

Food Quality 3.6/5 (I am a lover of vegetarian food served here. But, shanghai chicken has still large scope of enhancement)
Food Presentation 3.5/5¬†
Food Quantity 3.1/5
Taste 3.7/5
Ambiance 3.1/5 (Inner Hookah Lounge where i sat)
Hospitality 3.6/5
Value for money 3.3/5
=====
Conclusion: I might revisit this again. It was a moderate experience here. The hookah was nice as chai break has mastered the arts. :)
=====
Unbiased review based on my visiting experience.

This place is located just opposite to Infinity Benchmark, and ground floor of RDB boulevard, sector 5. Nearest bus stop is SDF. 
The day I visited this place it was almost empty. But when I entered their hookah section, it was quite filled. 
One thing bad about this place is the hookah that we ordered didn't last for long (hardly 20 minutes). Didn't enjoy the flavor. The ambiance is also not so good. Over alI had a bad experience. The food as compared to the price, quantity is very less. The drinks are good out here.

A must visit place for any reason... Be it food or hookah or just the non alcoholic drinks or shakes... 

I have been a regular here for almost 11 months now... I keep visiting this place here with frnds,  colleagues and family... 

Ambience: Good for a hookah parlour
Hookah: Good,  cool variety of hookahs
Food: Great... You have so much variety that u may visit 6-7 times just to try out different items or cuisines...
Drinks & Shakes: Great... You will fall in love with the Oreo or the Kitkat shake... 
Music: Normal (Plays Music Channels) 
Service: That's the Forte... U will just want to visit more n more all thanks to the service... 
Timing: That's the best part open till morning 4:30am...

You will always find some or other group of people here... Its a place you cannot miss out in Kolkata if u love cafes...

It was there in my checklist from a long time and finally had been there on a friend's birthday. Ideal lounge for hanging out with friends. Hookah is fine. The starters we ordered were great as well. Overall, it's a good place to spend your time in.

Heard about this from some of my friends... finally got a chance to visit the place...
The ambiance will give you a highway side dhaba feel with those tires being hanged on the walls..¬†
We visited during the happy hours time when the rate for buffet comes with a discount... and I can understand why many people recommended this.
The starters and the complimentary drink was damn good. The main course especially the chicken biriyani could have been better. The desserts, especially the ice cream shots was extra-ordinary. In all a lovely experience...those who loves places serving buffet must visit this place.

Frankly speaking, it's worth trying if you are fed up of BBQ nation. It is located just next to BBQ in Sec 5. The starters were lovely. Mutton was missing though, which I did not mind. They were unique in taste. Also liked the slices of pizza served in starters. Be sure to try out the tropical red complimentary drink. Main course was not so special, shortage of varieties. Desert was ok, specially the chocolate mousse was very tasty. Overall, a nice experience. Buffet was 500/- excluding tax.

Having heard recommendations of this place from many fellow foodies, I finally took a  day off to have the lunch buffet here. And I'm happy to say I was every bit pleased. 
As they have the same buffet rates on weekends also, we arrived at 12 noon and got the early bird offer (Rs.549 per head), to our dleight :). I also dropped by last evening for a hookah and snacks too.

**Decor, Ambience, service**
As this cafe joint is a restro cum hookah parlor, the hookah zone has been separated. The main area was reserved, so we took our seats in the hookah parlor. The place is big, appropriately lit and has very minimalistic decor. Music played here is good and you could find familiar songs that you like and humm along ! 
Now The service is a bit slow but that doesn't rise an issue . 
The washroom though should be cleaner though; I found cockroaches loitering about which gave me the creeps. 

**Food/Hookah/Drinks**
The buffet menu is superb. Although you don't get the 'On the Table Grill' which Barbeque Nation provides, this buffet doesn't let you down at all, it's pretty good for those who love a variety of cuisines on the menu. 
Highlights of the buffet were the Chilly Garlic Prawns, chicken Wings, Mutton seekh Kebabs, the delicious Reshmi Kebabs, those yummy crispy corns, the cheesy Pizza and definitely the Main course ! I usually don't find main course of such good taste and quality in regular buffets. But the Biriyani, Butter chicken, Mutton Kosha were really good as were the vegetarian items like Paneer Masala, Dal Tarka. 
The dessert section could do with a bit more items, but nonetheless it was nice.
The second time I went here, I took the TeenPaanRose hookah with ice base. Dense smoke and strong flavor, loved it ! On the sides we took Harissa Chicken Skewers with mustard mayo and A Penne Alfredo Chicken Pasta. Excellently made pasta, the penne was soft and had good consistency. The bechamel sauce was light and fresh. Lots of chicken bits. That's how you make a great pasta ! 
I had a wonderful time here. Hope to visit here again soon !

Was there for lunch on Sunday was very crowded, opted for buffet. One of my friends was veggie they had very limited options and too baby corn which I had was probably the worst in taste, non veg starters was okayish. Coming to service it's worst staff don't care they would serve some starters after 15 20 mins. Some of the item in menu was not served. One of the staff after taking the order forgot to serve after several reminders they serve. Main course was very limited and that also was nothing good in taste. Desert was the worst they had plastic spoons, who the hell on earth have plastic spoon. Desert they had two options some shitty vanilla ice cream and some leftover ages old halwa. Bill also was given after 15 to 20 minutes. Very bad experience.

Been there to have some quality experience like its neighbor but some how it didn't triumph.
Ambiance: It was perfectly fine until water droplets started dripping from the ac connection above. So 2/5.
Food: Their is little complain about food. Apart from crispy lamb starters were served well and delicious. In the main course, steamed rice with red curry an green curry both were mind blowing. I had a mouth watering taste of so called "cliched" reshmi butter masala here which is very much praiseworthy. They messed with the mixed kulcha and it is worst of a kind. Garlic nun was well and good. Garlic burnt chicken was some how not up to the mark. Hence 3.5/5
Service: Their weak point is service. We had to call waiters by waving hands high up again and again. When we asked for water they deliberately served mineral water without asking. Finger bowl was served with too much hot water. Even they warned us that outside food is not allowed when we were to cut a cake for our friends birthday. 1/5 goes for this.
Cost to Quality: If they improve their service and malfunctioning ac connection it would have been rational price. But considering these negative issues it is a bit on high on pocket. 3/5
Hence in average, it is coming down to around 2.5.

Not to be compared with Bar B Q Nation but it is really good alternative. It's having mixed starter like Chinese¬†chicken and prawn , fish preparation along with Indian Kebabs¬†¬†Chicken, Mutton. Good variety of deserts and main course specially the mutton. So if anyone not visited there try at least try one time then you will realize. Also just mentioning the price, on 5/5/2016 lunch buffet was Rs.540 inclusive taxes.

Went there for our office party and had a dinner buffet spread. I had been to Chai Break before but only for hookah and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they were equally good at fine dinning!
- This is my first 5 star review and I, even after thinking hard, could not take away a point
- We had around 6 starters, 3 non-veg and 3 veg, 8 items in main-course, soups, ice cream, pastry, gulab jamun and tooty-fruity ice cream in desserts
- I could not have all the items, yes I was 80% done when I reached the main-course section, starters were really awesome. I could only manage some mutton curry and a spoon of biriyani
- I had all the 3 tooty fruity flavors on offer, and all types of pastries, desserts were good as well
- Fina verdict, I always liked their hookah but now I can recommend them for dinning as well

Ever wonder what to eat if you are at saltlake in one hot afternoon. Definitely the buffet of chai break can be answer to that. Good food available at reasonable price. Taste is also good specially with the starters they provide. Its truly mouth watering. Only con that can be seen is that the service is a bit slow and also a few more options in dessert menu would not have been bad either. Overall a good foody experience. Definitely would be going there soon now that i know there is something exciting beside my office üò¨

Chai break started out as a break away restaurant in the IT hub. Located next door to Barbeque nation, it had managed to ruffle a few feathers. However, off late, things are going south. This place was known for it's fair share of starters. But, my last visit left me disappointed. Due to the huge number of patrons, the staff were flummoxed. They were struggling to keep up with the orders. Starters were hardly repeated despite numerous requests. The Main course hardly had anything to mention. Desserts were average & were not replenished often. The restaurant has a separate but stinking hookah section. Overall, a highly promising outlet that is gradually petering out into oblivion.

The taste of the food was average. But there can be no comparison to their neighbour - Barbeque. The pizza had a crust made of chapati that was crispy rather than bread that is usually what we expect. The starters did not keep coming instead we were kept waiting for the same. Since a huge group had gone before us hence the main course seemed to have been almost ended but the taste of the food can be termed above average but the waiters tries doing their best although they seemed to fail every time they tried doing so.

It was in my bookmarks list since long time as I have heard their buffet is great, today finally managed to visit the place. But could not try their buffet menu as I went there for the dinner.
It is in Saltlake sector v at SDF next to barbecue nation near RDB cinema. Can be located easily, parking is also available in front of it for both two wheeler and four wheeler.
Interiors and ambiance was good, waiters were very prompt and decent. Service was also quick.
There is a sperate hookah chamber, hookah lovers can go there.
For the dinner we ordered chicken man chow soup, roast lamb, prawn hakka noodles, fish with chilly garlic sauce and virgin colada. All food items were awesome except lamb dish, I did not like it as that much, tried lamb for the first time so that may be the reason. Virgin colada was simply great, it is a preparation of pineapple juice, vanilla cream and coconut milk.
So definitely recommended, looking forward to try their buffet menu soon. :)

for a recent small celebration party, we had decided to try 'Chai Break' out. Really liked the ambience just stepping in. They offered 3 types of welcome drink to choose from: Coke, 7-up and 'Blue drink'. We settled for the 'Blue drink'. 'Starter' - veg and non-veg palettes were a delight to the tongue; specially the sweet and sour chili paneer, salt and pepper chicken and chili prawn. Starters alone were plenty to choose from. In main course we had mixed veg rice and chili chicken with gravy along with chicken pasta salad and small portions of cucumber, tomato and onions. Frankly the chili chicken was a complete bust, lacked heart.
Anyway... was really surprised by the desserts, though the gulabjamuns were not hot, it was compensated by small frozen shots of strawberry and cream. Really enjoyed them. :)
I recommend this place.

Friends, I was searching an economic buffet lunch place nearby saltlake with my office colleagues . And I got Chai break. My colleagues planned it at 12 O'clock as it was happy hours. So, we got discount and it was just 499/-. Review Marksheet:
1. Behavior - 9/10
2. Service- 7/10
3. Atmosphere- 6/10
4. Food- 7/10
5. Value Price- 9/10
And because we had food in the top list priority, we were pleased at chai break.

1. Starters- 9/10 (veg)
 [fish and mutton tasted not so standard]
                    8/10 (non-veg) 
2. Main course- 6/10 [as usual]
3. Dessert - 7/10 (pastries were pathetic)

A very decent upcoming restaurant in Sector V. Yes it nearly impossible to take over your neighbor "Barbeque Nation" but Chai break is slowly getting peoples attention. The ambiance is good, the buffet is simply mouth watering specially the prawn item in starters. They have pizza in their starters which is unique and tasty as well. They offer hookah as well and have a separate spacious room for those who will enjoy their food with the taste of it. The starters both veg specially the pasta and non-veg are very impressive,they offer many varieties of starters . The main course does not have much to offer but once you are in love with the starters there will be not much left in your tummy for the main course. Deserts are so so.¬†
We bought coupons from 'nearbuy' (formerly Groupon) but the buffet price they offer can be easily availed with out special/discount coupons as well.
No doubt Chai Break is competing hard against their neighboring rivals and i must say they are doing it very well. Would love to visit it again the 3rd time.

A decent upstart in Salt Lake Sector V located just next to Barbeque Nation and opposite Ocean Grill. Evidently, being situated within the vicinity of such hot-shots, one needs to be on the top of their game is they need to survive the competition. And I believe, Chai Break has been successful in doing just that.

My initial encounters with this restaurant wasn't exactly smooth. They were reluctant to take orders over the phone and even if they pretended to do so, I was made to wait for over an hour upon reaching their restaurant to receive my order. Nevertheless, in due course of time, they became familiar with me and the experiences gradually turned to the sweeter side!

Although, they are mostly known for their wide variety of buffets, I have mostly ordered from here their Continental and Thai Menu. Among these would be their Stuffed Chicken, Fish n Chips, Thai Chicken in Red Curry, Baked Potatoes, Grilled Chicken and Cilantro Chicken. My pick amongst these would be Baked Potatoes. I should say here that I didn't like their Fish N chips and Cilantro Chicken much. Fish n Chips lacked that classic batter and the Cilantro Chicken was devoid of flavor, or rather I should say that I did not appreciate the taste.

The Grilled Stuffed Chicken served here is a classic though! Two decent breast pieces stuffed with cheese and accompanied with a rich sauce. It is enough to satisfy the hunger of a single person! The Thai Chicken too deserves a praise here. The ultimate comfort food served with Jasmine Rice. I could have this for all four meals of the day!

The ambiance inside the restaurant is pretty ¬†soothing. They have these large tools and big tables, mostly to cater large groups coming for buffet. There is also a a live bar/juice counter on one corner inside the restaurant. The waiters here are courteous and decent. Not to mention, they have recently reduced the price listings. The Stuffed Grilled Chicken is probably priced at 280 which is a steal comparing to the fact of me going outside Salt Lake to places like Anwar Shah or Southern Avenue and then coming back again just to enjoy some Continental delicacies.

Suggestions:- Stuffed Grilled Chicken / Chicken in Thai Red Curry / Baked Potatoes.

Eagerly looking for my next visit! :-)

Went there @19th march for a lunch buffet.

First thing need to say,all the staff are very helpful and well mannered.helps a lot and always smile in face...like it.atmosphere is something diff from other restaurants.

Now come to main point.
Starter : they serverd 8 kabab dishes and 1 pizza + 1 plate pasta.

Specially "prawn kabab" was superb.rest kababs are also very good.

Drink : "tropical blue" and nimbu soda was serverd.

Main course : yess..there was 2 types rice,2 types pasta,2 types chiken item,2 types veg item,panner,mutton and lots more..soup was very good.

Desert: serverd with 3 types of pastry,gulam jamun,vanilla ice cream and few more item.

Pineapple pastry was too good..all the starter and desert items are too good and too tasty.
Main course are more than average.

Overall very good experience only @549.00..

We chose this venue for a team lunch as it is located conveniently close to Sector V in RDB Boulevard next to BBQ Nation but we would be wiser had we opted for its much celebrated neighbor instead.
Firstly my condolences to all vegetarians to ever chose to try its buffet. This is not the place for you my friends.
The carnivores are a bit better off. The chilly prawn ,chicken wings and chicken pasta were the only starters worth mentioning. The other starters ,including the chicken pizza (as a starter!!) were either too bland or too salty. The main course had too few options and the mutton roganjosh was swimming in oil. If you want to have roti, you have to wait till eternity until it gets served at your table because they do not place breads in the buffet table. (No idea why)
The dessert was ordinary: comprised of chocolate tart, black forest pastry, vanilla ice cream and over-sweetened gulab jamun. 
The food was okay and the service was slow to the extent of poor. Overall an experience that I don't think I'll remember for long, let alone repeat.

I went to Chai Break for a buffet lunch with my colleagues. The buffet is a typical north indian buffet with focus on kababs.

Starters (nonveg) - great 
Starters (veg) - terrible
Main Corse - moderate
Dessert - terrible

If you are a vegetarian do not go here, it will charge you the same as a non-veg meal but there are hardly any veg options.
Moreover the place is understaffed and it takes a long time to serve food.

The only Chai break serving non vegetarian food. The hookah was good. The service was satisfying and the food was really tasty. I have been here 4-5 times and plan to visit more times. The paneer in hot garlic sauce is one dish that I found quite good.

Went to this place for a busy weekday lunch with my friend.
We opted for the buffet menu.
The buffet is served on the plates instead of static counters, which is convinient as you don't have to travel. However, this also has its downturns as suddenly you find too many starters on your palate as staffs come back to back to place food on the plate.
The starters composed of prawn and chicken and mutton. It was decent but something you will get in various food courts. Nothing over the top. The mutton kebab was too dry.
The pasta in alio olio was decent but then again nothing special to deserve a 550 INR buffet. The pizza tasted dry and stale.
The dessert option was limited to pastries and gulab jamuns and vanilla ice cream(yes just one type!). However, the black forest pastry was actually the best thing in the menu.
Will I go back? Maybe for some quick evening grabs, but unwilling to have another lunch there with so many options nearby.

I visited this place twice and in both times I was totally let down by the food quality and the service provided. The complimentary drinks provided are the worst I have ever seen and in our second time visit we were even served cold starters.

"Dont judge a book by its cover", a famous saying - totally fits this outlet. Chai break is not at all about coffee shop or fast food. It is a hardcore food joint with availability of a wide range of dishes.
The buffet is simply awesome covering a plethora of starters, main course and dessert.
Chicken salt and pepper, chicken hariyali, prawn chilly, mutton boti kabab, baby corn, battered fish fry made up for the starters.
Main course was covered up with chicken biryani, mutton rogan josh and chicken item.
Desserts comprise three types of pastry, choco tart, gulab jamun and ice cream.
The best part is that the price of the entire menu is just 549 bucks and if taken before 12.30 then only 500 bucks.
In all, a value for money buffet provider that can give barbecue nation, flame and grill and mainland china a run-for-the-money.

Pathetic Service.¬†I being a veggie have to suffer often, but to be sitting for over 20 mins staring, while my colleagues are feeding on the dead meat that is torture. The place is weird, they must have been confused while planning. The chairs are such that its a struggle getting on and off.¬†
When i did complain of the slow and bad service one of the waiters gave a long flat stare while i spoke, either he did not understand Hindi or he did not care.¬†Food was a mix but, while 2 of the starters where good which they served without me asking but they had to yet serve the remaining two which i had to ask them. then came tandoori stuffed aloo and fried gobhi which was nearly burnt and had a tar like taste.¬†
later while having main course i on table had roti with no butter, i then asked for a butter naan, suddenly i notice the roti missing from the table, the waiter had taken it away. When i asked he smiled like a halfwit and after sometime got the same roti with butter applied it was then i gave up.
On top they didn't serve veg items to non vegs ones which other places do. basically if you are a veggie do not ever step here for a buffet, and if you want to enjoy a comfortable and wholesome buffet even then do not come here. Basically do not go this place, waste of 600 bucks.

Today I had my first experience with Chai Break, an upstart food joint right at the ground floor of RDB cinemas at Sector 5. Well, they have other outlets too, as I heard. Coming to the main topic, the food, was outstanding in a word. A totally value for money buffet arrangement is what you can expect here everyday at lunch. From starters to desserts, they have lined up a very innovative choice of foods that both look and taste good! The decor is lively, staffs are courteous, and service is prompt. What more one can expect! Really impressive.

The lunch buffet had numerous options, way too many as compared to the general buffet lunches I ¬†have been too, which has an advantage and a disadvantage as well.
Advantage being, a lot of options to choose from (if at all one wants to choose ;) ) and the disadvantage is the serving time between each starter was quite ¬†long.
Having said that, I think this is worth a try!!!

Visited this place last July, with three of my friends. We were impressed by the ambience and beautiful interiors. We decided to go for buffet lunch and believe you me, we literally gorged ..  food, right from starters which were served at table in abundance, to main course to desserts, was too tasty and tempting to resist. Staff were customer friendly. The head chef came down to offer one their special dishes to taste. It was such a nice gesture on his part.. 

Thank you for the hospitality and of course some great food.

The ambience is good. The food is tasty and as well as light. There are large variety in startarts specialy for non veg. Main course is okey. lastly the desert is pretty fine. One can try this joint. It is highly recomended. Only one problem that they serve the startars. you cannot independently choose. Otherwise it is very good.

Today morning thought to visit Chai Break. So I with my friend visited the place.¬†
The place was very good with guitar and light.... The ambience was really very good to be enjoyed..
Going to food... good amount of starter like haryali chicken,chicken wings,chilly prawn, salt n pepper chicken, kebab n all in non veg.. tandoori alu n chilly corn taste good in veg..... main course can be improved and the variety should be increased and welcome drink was also good
desert was very good n was to the expectation.
service in the place was good n guys were very helpful and polite :)
price was also reasonable ranging between 500- 600 rupee

Overall experience was good at this place..

Located just beside the BBQ nation. Quiet underrated I would say.
We had a lunch buffet there. Ala carte is also available, but dat is a bit expensive.

There are a huge amount of starter(12.. Yes a big number) they offer. Including 4 non veg kebab. All are served on the table.
In main course they offer 3 non veg and 3 veg item
In desert they have 4 items.
Please note that I hv visited this 5 months@ back, heard that they have increases the desert item there.
Buffet cost also increases. From 450 to 550. Including taxes.
Last but not least , they also offer a complementary welcome drink.

Food quality is quiet good, only the issue I found they serve the starter quiet fast :(

But yes, in this expense I would say this is d best buffet around here. Give it a try.

I got a review from a friend who visited few months back, from then I was eager to visit this place. Yesterday a sudden decision was taken to visit this place and perhaps one of the best buffet i had in the past few months.
Ambience: The place is very neatly decorated with some simple item like Guitars, wheels etc. The seating arrangement was very nice and was spacious enough to accommodate our team of almost 50 people.
Food: Lets talk about the main thing now. There were many options available in starters which includes items from different cuisines. 3 types of Chicken Kebabs, Mutton Sheekh kabab from the Indian Menu. It also offered Pasta and Pizza from the Italian side. Plus Chicken and Prawn cooked in the Chinese way. There were in total 10 different types of starters. They were serving in very good quantity and the taste was too good.
Coming to the main course - they had options in soup, salad, 3 types of Non veg sides with Biriyani and Fried rice. Rotis were served as per ordered.
Desserts - The options were limited but whatever they had tasted simply perfect. Chocolate tart was the best. The pastries were soft.
We reached a point where we could eat no more and we decided to leave.
Hospitality- The attendants were really well behaved and very much attentive to the needs of the customers.

The experience is very good and will definitely visit again.

Finally a competitor for BBQ Nation at Sector 5. A couple of us office colleagues went for lunch Buffet and were quite surprised with the good quality of food.¬†
Decor: Nothing over the top but has a feel-good factor.It has a pretty huge seating area and it's not at all evident till you enter the restaurant.¬†
Food: Starters list is quite exhaustive. Pepper Chicken, Thai Fish, Tandoori, Mutton Sheek Kebab, Chicken Tikka, Hariyali Kebab, chicken wings, crispy baby corn, pizza, pasta, stuffed aloo & gobi, chilly prawn. Phew ! You also get complimentary drinks - your choice of soft drinks, iced tea or fresh lime soda. If you still have space left for the main course there is the usual fare of chicken biryani, plain white rice, daal, chicken tikka masala, fish kalia, butter paneer.
Once you are done with these, there are at least¬†5 dessert items: Hot Gulab Jamun, Choco Pastry, Lemon Tart, Mixed fruit and ice cream. You probably won't be able to walk straight after having all these but you probably won't be able to resist either!¬†
Overall: A very capable and alternative place for having lunch in groups. Especially since corporate discount is available. Take the bait guys and enjoy!!

A few days ago we were at office during the late hours of the day and extremely hungry. Browsing through Zomato, we decided on Chai Break. We called them to ask if a delivery would be possible at our location and when they agreed we began deciding on the food. We called up again and ordered our food. The man taking the order then suddenly asks us as to who would collect the order. We reminded them that they said that a delivery would be possible but now they spoke against it. They even asked us to come down to the restaurant and collect the food at midnight. It was such a disappointing moment and I'm forced to comment that this place has a horrible customer service.

Much heard abt this place specially for the buffet and finally visited this place today at lunch... First impression while entering the place will give u a cafe feeling.. colourful decor and high sitting stools and cabin type sitting area...
Coming on to the food buffet in one word a real surprise when started having them ..  Awesome and excellent... Elaborated starter menu and main course with yummy delicious desserts...
Starters:
Chicken tikka kebab,Hariyali Kebab, Butter fish fry, chicken wings, crispy baby corn, chilli prawn, pepper chicken, Gobi tandoori, stuffed alo, pasta, pizza
Complimentary drinks: Fresh lime soda, soft drinks and ice tea ..go for ice tea very refreshing. 
Green salad, chicken pasta salad, soups
Main Course rice , fried rice ,biriyani, chicken tikka masala,chilli chicken, mixed veg ,Kali dal, thai curry ,paneer, mutton ...
Desserts: 5 types of pastries : chocolate, black forest, pineapple etc with tart .. Also ice cream and hot gulab jamun
Food quality and taste is excellent.. The main catch is the pricing it's really reasonable and value for money that's one of their USP management sud nt increase the rates as it's the best deal which attracts the customers.. It's a great place for the food lovers.. Go for it strongly recommended .. Go for it and have a try...

This place is good and cheap. Good ambiance. 
The starters are awesome. The drink at the starting was good but they wont refill it. The pizza is good. All other srarters are very tasty. Different flavours are correctly combined in starter. Good main course. Biriyani, chicken, mutton are also good. Desserts are moderate. 
Overall a good experience.
I love to go chai break instead of barbeque nation as it is cheap :P
You can go there at 1am and there will be food for you.

After staying for a few years now in Mumbai, me and my bro are very used to cafes and restaurants open entire night, as we are more of insomniac night owls and foodie lovers. 
Last night, as we both were awake, and it was almost 2 am at night, we were not sleepy at all amd hunger struck us both badly. Quite unsure of whether we would get a place which would open at that time of the night in Kolkata, I still searched "OpenNow" in Zomato and came across this place. 
We were elated to find such a place and we drove all the way from Tangra to Sector 5. We entered, the place welcomed us with the strong smell of hookah. The decor was quite good, balloons and all were there, may be they havent come over Valentines still. There were tables and chairs arranged in two ways. There was a large table and several chairs on one side, and on the other side, there were corners made with centre tables and sofa kind of a seating arrangement. The place was well-lit, with all red and blue lights all over. There was music going on along with videos on TV, but the music was so loud that it was literally irritating to our ears, so we asked to lower the volume.
The staff soon came up with the menu. After a quick browsing, we ordered Caesar Salad for us, a Brownie with icecream to be served later, and for drinks, we had ordered Green Apple Iced Tea. 
The Caesar salad tasted very nice. Pefectly made with all the ingredients, the creamy blend of mayonnaise and salad spices, made it taste so well. The Green Apple Iced Tea was refreshing. The brownie with icecream tasted yummy, one of the best brownies I have tasted.
I found the bill was okay, but without the taxes. Including the three kinds of taxes, I found on the bill on the higher side.
However, its good to have a place in Kolkata open throughout the night. Good for night owls like us! üòä

Some places have their own history... Just like this one has with me ! And that history will always affect your judgements no matter how much you try to avoid it.
This place used to be managed by a moron ( i hope he is in past tense for this resto as I didn't see him this time) who had misbehaved and almost thrown us away twice as because they were full and didn't feel it necessary to at least behave properly with the guests, quarrelling at the top of his voice.
Anyways, let me leave behind the history and write smth on the experience I had this time. The food is definitely worth mentioning esp the starters. Chicken came in at least 4-5 avatars, fish, lip smacking prawn, baby corn, etc. They were satisfying for the taste buds and definitely worth the money which is on the lower side. The main course was a regular fare with the biriyani being an average candidate, Mutton Rogan Josh was good. The desserts were few and not very appealing and I would give it a 2 out of 5 for the desserts.

As the name says Chai break we though it to be a cafe but we found that they have many menu options and they serve buffet too. Since we went during evening time for our snacks we ordered some stuffed mushroom,there kesariya chai and irish cofee. ¬†
Mushroom was so well done that I never had such wonderfull mushroom anywhere else and chai and coffee were also good. Only problem we found was in getting our food on table.They said the tea takes more time and they actually took 30 mins to get my team. I would say its a good place to have your food just that they need to work on there service part.

Another buffet restaurant checked. Faces a tough competition from the beast located just beside. Starters are great which include Garlic paneer,  chilly Babycorn, Pizza, White sauce pasta ( delicious ), Gobi, aalo, mushroom. Drinks include soft drinks, blue lagoon, sweet lime. The main course was average although after having starters you would hardly opt for biryani, mix veg, Daal tarka, etc. The dessert was not upto the mark and should improve. Vallina ice cream block was hard and difficult to be scooped out. Other desserts included chocolate and strawberry tart, black forest pastry, dark choc Cake, gulab jamun. 
Non veg starters are also great.
Starters : 4.5 
Main course: 4
Dessert : 3 - needs improvement.
This place can be tried once at least.

The place serves hookah, but doesn't care for customer who don't want the smoke. They have a separate section for hookah, but serve hookah even in the general section. Which in my opinion is a big nuisance given its a closed restaurant and the smoke is an irritant.

Coming to the food, ordered cajun spice crispy potatoes, chicken Tikka, dal makhani and roti/naan. The cajun potatoes tasted good but were a but dry. The rest was okay.

Give it a miss if you don't want the smoke.

Restaurant management should be strict about hookah being served only in the separate section. But I guess people visit here mostly for the hookah so they are happy to oblige.

Located insanely close to the PwC building I work in , it was a shame that I did not visit it sooner . Checked in on a lazy Sunday evening , the ambiance was awesome and the interior well lit , which is the first thing I look for when i am in a cafe .¬†Did not have much time to check out everything and was in no mood for a hookah , so did not get into the much celebrated smoking section of the cafe . Ordered some cappuccino which was much too expensive for the thing offered. Planning to try their special tea next time though .

Finished off with some Cilantro chicken and grilled chicken which were delicious but a tad too chewy for my liking . I would have liked it to be more tender and juicy but the quantity was good and I should have ordered only one plate for the two of us.

Overall liked it enough to visit it again . This time with more people because the cafe is spacious and is more suited for a hangout with friends over cappuccino and hookah rather than a luncheon date with your crush .

A impressive 4/5 for the decor and the ambiance .Will rate the food only when I try something more , would be unfair otherwise.

Located just below rdb boulevard this chai break outlet has many specialities.
1. It's open till late at night,so very comfortable to rest upon sometimes for sec 5 night shift goers.üëèüëèüëè
2. They offer huge variety of foods like a proper restaurant along with chai break signature coffee,chais n hookahs. So unlike all chai break outlets it is not only cafe,but also a restaurant cum cafe. üëåüëåüëå
3. Most probably its the largest chai break outlet in kolkata,seperating the hookah section and eating section. 

When I entered,just only 1 word came out of my mouth.....WOW!!!!! üëçüëçüëç. Spanish guiters hanging all around the wall of hookah section, the outlet is fascinatingly decorated with blue dim light and light music on tv. For ambience and decoration it ll surely get 10 on 10. 
We took.... 
1. Their signature pan rasna strong hookahs (very refreshing,beautifully made) n gets rating 10 on 10. ‚úå‚úå
2. My favourite flavoured green tea. ‚òï‚òï‚òï
3. Pasta salad with island dressing (8 on 10)
4. Sanghai Chicken ( deep fried chicken with sanghai sauce and onion), gets 8 on 10.
A Special mention of the waiters as they were very co operative,cordial,energetic even at late night. So you guys deserve 10 on 10. Even when I went to take a pic of their mocktail decorations, they said "not allowed to take pics" very politely.
Overall very impressive experience, must visit is recomended atleast once,you ll instantly love it. üëåüëåüëå

Starting from mocktails, soup, chicken wings, fish fry, crispy chilli babycorn, prawns, etc etc in starter. Dal makhani, biryani, mutton, chicken, fried rice, paneer, raita and more. And finally finished off with desserts, both ice cream,pastries and gulab jamun! One definitely needs a good fat appetite to finish off so many dishes üòù

Chai Break(Sector V)....!!!
If u enter it expecting it to be an usual hookah parlour-cum-cafe just like all other chai break outlets, den be prepared for a mind-boggling surprise....
Its a proper restaurant serving delicacies in a very interesting buffet apart from catering to the hookah lovers in a separate section
I went there with a friend & since it was afternoon, we decided to try their buffet
Though it is situated right beside the infamous Barbeque Nation, there was only 2-3 tables vacant.
The decor was minimal but cool & the ambience was okay
The buffet scores for its variety of starters.
At first they served us with Chicken manchow soup which increased my appettite
In starters they served us
1.Chicken Tikka kebab
2.Chicken Reshmi Kebab - both very tender & juicy & melt in d mouth
3.Fish kebab - more of a dry pakora
4.Jamaican chicken wings - succulent cooked in tangy dark sauce
5.Pepper chicken - mild flavoured chicken balls
6.Panner - similar in taste to the above
7.Crispy babycorn - crunchy & savoury in d right way
8.Dry chilli chicken
9.Chilli prawn - both authentic chinese starters
10. OMG Pizza - yes they also served us creamy cheesed chicken pizza
11.Fusili pasta - cooked with basil & chicken, NOT GOOD...!!
12.Caesar salad - Both veg & non-veg options were available & it was yumm...

After all such variety of starters, i was already full... well, after taking some time i moved onto the main course
OH YES..!! They also provide a complimentary MOCKTAIL..
Main course included
1.Chicken Biriyani - traditional chicken biriyani cooked with tender boneless chicken & the ALU
2.Chicken Masala - chicken tenderly cooked in makhni gravy DELICIOUS..!!
3.Mutton Roganjosh - well prepared
4.Significant options for vegetable lovers like Dal makhani, thai green curry, paneer makhni, mixed vegetable. I tried the last two & dey were equally good
5.Chilli chicken, veg fried rice, steam rice for d chinese lover in u although i didnt try it
Indian breads were made as per order

However, i was not pleased with their assortment of starters.
5 different types of pastries & cupcakes were there all of which i dont remember
The chocolate cupcake which i tried was good though
Other than dat they served us hot gulab jamun & vanilla ice-cream with 'thanda' chocolate sauce
They didnt make any effort to keep a variety in d ice-cream department and also d indian sweets were just kept solo

Apart from the food, the service was good. We were served starters quite efficiently & in repetitions.
Value for food is excellent. Food quality is a thumbs up.
Buffet priced at 549/- inclusive of taxes offering such a great variety that too at a prime location is more than one could ever ask for. Also the fact that they kept d price same throughout d week is WORTH MENTIONING...!!!
Definitely will be in d TOP 5 of my list whenever i will be looking out for a buffet..

I believe this to be the biggest Chai break than any others in the city limits.  With spacious seating you and your group gets decent privacy Compared to others where you can overhear others conversations.  Coming to the food and Shisha they have maintained their brand image with that but their service is something that let's one down,

Visiting chai break is quite an accident. We were actually to visit another buffet joint around this place,however,after having a glance at their menu we reconsidered our decision and i must admit that accidents are sometime sweet and wonderful. Situated beside the king of buffet,the glory of this place doesn't fade away,rather this place stands out brilliantly. Whereas in most of the buffet places the range starts from 700,this place offers you lots of mouth watering dishes at only 549.(no price hike on holidays)& you might have been lucky to avail early bird discount as we are between 12 to 12:30. The ambience is cozy with hanging guitars and the hookah bar is the central attraction.
Now coming to foods,there are a huge variety of starter. We were served crispy baby corn,tandoori gobi,tandoori aloo, paneer kebab,fish batter fry,hariyali chicken kebab,chicken tikka kebab,wok fried hot wings ,mutton boti kebab,salt and pepper chicken,golden fried prawn. The kebabs are delicious,chicken is soft and tender. We were given a complimentary drink(for each person) and the tropical blue is just fab. As we were already full we did not tasted chicken pasta. But the thin crust chicken pizza is good as well. We tasted chicken Mayo salad and man chow soup also.
Whereas some of the renowned buffet counter lacks in main courses,here you can enjoy main course thoroughly. Chicken biriyani is average but mutton rogan josh and chicken tikka masala appealed to my taste buds. Perfectly cooked & melts in mouth.
I find the deserts a bit low. Ice cream and pastries(black forest,white forest,pure chocolate)tart and golab jamun. But considering the price,i have no complaints.
The staffs are not so friendly and you have to constantly nag them for repeating the dishes. This i think they should work on and improve. The rest is just brilliant. Had a wonderful dining experience here & chai break just made my day. :-)

After hearing quite a lot ( good & bad ) about this joint we decided to check out their buffet . On a Saturday afternoon the place was almost empty. They have a Hookah section too but being non smoker & non alcoholic we opted for buffet section only. Among various welcome drinks we ordered fresh lime soda ( sweet & salt ) and it was usual. They serve the starters in the dish and started with Fried baby corns and followed up with other starters .While Hariyali chicken was just awesome others like mutton sheek kebab , fish butter fry were simply forgettable. The bread for Chicken pizza was very hard and burned .The lowest point was mutton sheek kebab which was hard and tasteless. Sezchuwan Prawns were okay but it was more like a main course dish than a starter. Having gone through the starters unsatisfied we came to the main course. First up was chicken soup and it was normal . Chicken biriyani looked and tasted very ordinary. Veg Fried Rice and mixed veg was okay. Though the chicken was quite good Mutton Roganjosh was way too hard and butter nun was not up to the mark. The desserts list was not very extensive but chocolate and black forest pastries were soft and tasty. None from the management  enquired about our likes & dislikes and in today's competitive environment it was very surprising. Overall we were quite disheartened and dissatisfied.

After having a long planning we finally visited to the Chai Break outlet at Sector 5 just beside BBQ nation... we went for lunch and took buffet...
The decoration and ambience is quite attractive ... the wheels , the guitars , colourful seats , live tv screening everything add a good impression ...
Now coming the food, Waiters started to serve the starters and repeated many times but there was no grill system like BBQ...
In starters , we had
Salt n Pepper Chicken
Fish Batter Fry
Paneer Tikka
Crispy Baby Corn
Chiken Tikka Kebab
Chicken Hariyali Kebab
Mutton Boti Kebab
Chilly Prawn
Wok fried Chicken Wings
After that,
Chicken Pasta
Chicken Pizza
Chicken Manchow Wanton Soup
Chicken Pasta Mayo Salad

In Main course there were
Potato Fries
Salad
Fried Rice
Steamed Rice
Dal Makhani
Chana Masala
Paneer Butter Masala
Mix Vegetables
Chicken Biriyani
Mutton Roghanjosh
Chicken Tikka Masala
Chilly Chicken Gravy

In Dessert They had
Gulabjamun
Pastries
Tart
Chocolate Icecream

They also give you options for one cooler... in which we had Tropical Blue and Fresh Lime Soda 

Now talking about the taste , Each and every Starters were too delicious and lip smacking... I would rather say this place has one of the best starters in town... Desserts were normal ... gulabjamon and ice cream were good ... But we were somehow disappointed with the main course... the tastes were not too good ... Quality of main course should be increased...
Overall it was pretty good in 550 bucks...
They also have hookah section...
Service was good...
Only con I find was about main course...
But the Starters really felt heavenly in tastebuds
#A Must try for the Buffet

I tried the buffet lunch here. The wonderful side is that in spite of having 12+ starter items, all of them are good and distinct in taste (I went for the non-veg starters and cannot comment on pure veg starters). The main course is also good with veg, chicken and mutton items. 
What I really disliked are the seats. They were too high and difficult for elder people to sit. Again, the high seats discourage frequent visits to the food area, and when you are on a buffet, you need to visit the food area to pick up what you like.
Another observation: When I called up the place for reservation, they asked for advance payment, which is something that I have not faced with any other restaurants.

We went to this place on a sunday afternoon for a non veg buffet...it's really a good thing that they have not gone for a price discrimination based on weekdays and weekends...also the good thing for non veggies that no price differentiation for them as well..:)...so flat 549+ tax any day and any buffet menu ( veg or non-veg)...

Going towards the ambience....its spacious and well arranged with relaxing sofas and little dim lighting which is soothing as well... We were warmly welcomed and at once given comfortable seats with no waiting time...and the starters came along within few seconds....the first one was the most amazing one...chicken salt and pepper...they served us almost 11 starters including one mutton..two fish and one prawn starter....they would keep repeating the ones you like the most until you ask them to stop....so by the time we were done with those...we were already full...still went ahead to taste the main course a little...the main course was as amazing and tasty as the starters were....the mutton curry was the most delicious one..:)...even if you are full....you should atleast try the mutton in the main course...

The desserts were equally justifying...3 varaities of pastries...gulab jamun...and ice cream..with choclate sauce...loved the entire thing...

Being close to the buffet giant like BBQ...this resturant has really come up with excellent service and food...if you are a fan of BBQ and want to try something which is a little affordable with almost no waiting time or prior reservations...then you should go for it....

The hookkaa arrangements are also there inside the resturants...planning to explore the same during my next visit....:)

Went for a lunch buffet yesterday. Ordered 2 additional lime sodas, the bill was just around 1300 INR. The starters with the fish, chilli chicken,baby corn and Pizza items were quite good. There were chicken and mutton kebabs as well along with the option of a glass of soft beverage on the menu. Although the salads, pasta and soups prepared were below par. Didn't have the appetite for the main course unfortunately. The deserts were pretty decent and I would definitely go for their budget lunch buffet again. Service was satisfactory...the ambiance is quite a happening one.
Will be visiting again for sure.

Being located at the heart of Sector 5 with so many amazing buffet joints, this place has done it's job quite well. For a lazy afternoon lunch, my sister and me, decided to skip all the buffet ruckus and go a la carte. The ambiance was good and not too crowded.
Having small appetite, we opted for a risotto named Risotto Al Funghi which was mushroom based and Stuffed Chicken Breast.
The risotto was creamy and smooth and still Al dente. The chicken breast was juicy but lacked a fuller stuffing.
The drinks were satisfactory nd nice.
Overall experience was pleasant and certainly lived upto the expectation. Next time we plan to go for the buffet.

Had a team lunch on 31st December at chai break. We opted for buffet@549/- all inclusive. Though it's adjacent to barbecue nation, it has different concept for starter. It's mix of continental, Indian and Chinese items an served by waiters. Taste is good, except for all fish items. All fish dishes are just tasteless. Items in main course is limited, but tasteful. Same to deserts, limited but good. Ambiance is cool and cozy. Should be a nice try for all buffet lovers.

Chai Break at Sector V has a nice cosy ambience and I would say they serve best in class chilled hookahs. I often go there after midnight and opt for a hookah and some food. Among the hookahs, chat patta and CB special pan masala flavors are too good! Yep man, these are awesome!! Among food items starter or snacks type of dishes are worth to mention. I like this place!

"CHAI BREAK"... The food was not that kadak as the name of the restaurant. You can give it a try or try it when you don't have a option. I visited it on New year eve and had a buffet, which was ok. The one thing I liked in the buffet is the pizza they provided in the starters(Not kidding).They have a separate section for hookah too. The ambiance need to improve a lot.

The only chai break quite near to my place bit to my utter dismay the worse chai break's in cal.
I do agree that the quality cant be the same for all the branches but this one terribly dissapointing.
This is the only chai break that serves non veg and indian food. But neither are good compared to the price point. Hookah also is bad and they dont change it like the elgin chai break does. Overall a bad experience.

This is not a typical cafe as there are too many other things you'll find here. Lots of options in appetizers and in main course along with usual beverages. This place is multi-cuisine and you get both A La Carte and buffet as options. D√©cor and ambience is great as well as their service. We had roasted chicken soup,grilled stuffed chicken and one orange feedo-deedo. Roasted chicken soup tasted very different, very flavoursome. I loved the roasted-meaty-earthy flavour with a tinge of garlic. Grilled chicken breast was also cooked well along with spicy baby potatoes instead of mashed potato,another innovation which we liked. Orange juice was great,don't know whether they used a syrup or fresh oranges. What you will like about this place is their well packed menu and for me the negative is lack of desserts other than usual gulab jamun and cakes.
Service and ambience- 4/5
Food Quality- 4/5

Durga Puja is the time of the year when The City of Joy becomes a clone of Mumbai ‚Äì active 24 hours a day. During these days, people just don‚Äôt get tired of hopping around all over the city to visit pandals. Such an expedition also creates a yearning for greater food and moreover restaurants that keep open way past midnight hours to cater to the hunger.

Chai Break has over the past years become a pretty renowned chain of hookah lounge, with its outlets present in all corners of the city. The Chai Break in Sector 5, in my knowledge, is the only hookah parlour in the city to stay open as late as 5A.M.
During the pujas, at around 3 A.M. while hanging out with friends, I had the urge of going on a late night outing to have some appetizers but at a decent place. Quickly turned towards Zomato and answer was Chai Break. At reached to find out that it is located in the further end of Sector 5. The place is spread over a moderate area like its twin outlets. Seating sections are comfortable and can accommodate large groups. It also has a dedicated bar for beverages; no alcohol. Excellently decorated interiors as well.

Coming to the food, the quantity and quality both were pleasing. Our order was as follows:
‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Fondue : It was the first time I had fondue and boy I was in love with it. The breads were evenly cooked and cheese was needless to say...yumm !

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Cappuccino : Nicely prepared. The server also showed of his artistic skills by drawing a picture of my friend by coffee cream.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Caf√© Latte : It was the classic latte. Had an even balance of sugar ensuring it didn‚Äôt tip over to the sweeter side.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Hot Chocolate : Truly loved it. The best I had had after quite some time. Also decorated by patterns drawn from chocolate sauce.

‚òÖ¬†¬† ¬†Lemon Iced Tea : Attractively served and virtuous to taste. Refreshing to the mood.

The service was pretty quick even during those odd hours. The servers were polite. A nice joint to hang out and relax, especially when you have a late night craving. Although the prices might feel a little heavy on your pocket.

We Have heared loads about dis place..On a busy Friday, we planned for a team lunch buffet at #Chai Break..

It doesn't have the big space compare to famous names but they serve quality food..the ambience was very nice..a transparent door separation is there between hookah and rest..hanging guitars on walls and chains with blue dim light from ceiling were stating the interior intelligence..

Talking about food, they have started the starters with Thai fish followed by chicken items, fish kabab, chicken kababs, mutton, crispy babycorn, pizza etc. All were too good, no one can differ. Thai fish was outstanding. For the main course, menu was short but by the time we have had enough..they did not disappoint us with the dessert..variety of cakes, gulab jamun, ice creams were on the list with drink beverages.

Service was very good..they had served all things with all the possible ways..Thumps Up!

Went for a buffet lunch with 12 office team members. 
Nice decor.. but with too much loud music.
The buffet comprises of almost 6 chicken two fish and one prawn starter along with some veg starters too. 
D main course was very ordinary. .except for the mutton which tasted great.
D dessert section was simple but nice.. but yes with such a low price you get lot more than that. .So I would definitely suggest Chai Break

Decor was good.kababs were tender as well.fish items were not up to the mark.12 starters were there,bt the problem was in between, some items were dull so it was a disapointment for the tongue.biriyani was very average.mutton was little bit over salty and under seasoned.shami kabab was served cold.desert was nice.gulab jamun and tart were the best.chicken wings were little bit over seasoned.and yah pizza was really good.actually they serve different types of cuisine there,so sometime it was vry tough to feel all the textures and taste of those pleasantries by wearing a satisfying smile on the face.

A much heard about food joint in the busy streets of Sector 5. Especially known for its Hookah bar, this place has earned a lot of respect in a very short time. The staff was very friendly and assisted us with everything. The interiors is kind of a classic american diner just without the glass wall looking out to the street. Its pretty impressive in that way.

We had ordered for both Buffet and A La Carte meals. The starter section in the buffet was absolutely delightful. Chilly Chicken, Chilly Fish, Reshmi Kabab, Dhania Kabab, Crispy Chilly Babycorn, Golden Fried Prawn, Chicken Wings were served in quick succession. The service was good and the food ambosial.

The main course was not very appealing as it didnt have many dishes. But we were anyway full till then, so we went just for the Lemon Coriander Chicken soup. It was pretty tasty too.

Meanwhile the A La Carte order was served: Paneer Tomato and Cheese pizza for our vegan friend for that day. We tasted a slice of it and honestly that was like the best pizza I ever had. Had we known it earlier, we all could have gone for that. It was a thin crust pizza and there was an absolute amalgamation of crispyness of the crust and mellowness of the cheese. The toppings were just perfect, quite subtly complimenting the taste overall. Absolutely brilliant. 

Coming to the sweet dish section, I must say that we were not dissappointed. There were hot gulab jamuns, tarts, cakes, fruits. Quite a collection. 

Having set up beside the King of Buffet, the Barbeque Nation, this place has rightfully earned a place for itself.

I cannot conclude the restaurant right now.But honestly one thing I must say that the buffet is the worst one.Still I am looking for the ala carte dishes.Hope then I can conclude the over all review of the restaurant.
So coming to the point of the buffet yes they do have so many options of starter and with so many varieties both in Veg and Non-Veg.Most of the veg starters are based on Paneer items so I would rather suggest it can be short but the variety should be more instead so many "Paneer" dishes.And so as the Non-Veg starter section there were almost 7starters which were made by chicken but only eatable items were 1-2 so it can also be scrutinised and revised.
In main course the same old and common dishes were there like Russian salad,rice,roti,Kali daal,paneer,biriyani,mutton roganjosh, etc all were average.
Now coming to the service portion yes the waiters are courteous on an average but they should be more professional.Today we ordered a starter for four to five times but they still forgot and then we stopped asking for that dish.The number of waiters are also very less so it was quiet a unorganised situation happened today.
So on the basis of today's experience my rating and review was above one.But next time I again want to visit here to taste the ala carte dishes.Hopefully the experience will change.

The menu is quite huge considering the price. On the flipside the starters had to be rushed through a bit, leaving you little scope to appreciate any particular item. Pizza was good. The kebabs flavourful. Fish wasn't really fresh. Main course standard. Desserts were quite good. Overall a hearty meal and a good experience.

Been here twice in Oct 2015 to enjoy lunch buffet. Large variety of starters, decent spread of main course and good items for dessert seems to be their USP. 
Coming to quality, there is a lot to improve. Specially when I tried second slot for lunch, tarts served in dessert were in miserable condition, almost broken and lost the crisp. In starters, chinese styled chicken preps stood out better than the kebabs. Fish items were not so good. Shanghai Prawn was brilliant. Main course needs no special mention as starters make one full enough. On both occasions I found strawberry flavoured ice cream so that's another scope to add some variation. Overall, this is value for money for one time visit.

Visited this place on a Saturday afternoon (sadly a day on which my girl eats veg). Located bang aside the BBQ Nation below the RDB building, this is a good place to eat but conveys a very wrong meaning from its name. Having visited the Elgin Road one I had a completely different idea of how it would be, but apart from the enclosure where hookah is served from the ambiance it looked like an above average restaurant.

1. Mushroom Soup : Having tasted the worst mushroom soup possible at Hataari Gariahat, we still decided to give it a try and it did not disappoint. Rich and creamy with large chunks of mushroom this was totally worth the price

2. Chilly Cheese Toast : I would say for 150 bucks, I have tasted better chilly cheest toast at Afraa etc... this can be improved

3. Cheesy Cream Pasta : This was heaven... Excellently cooked... rich in cream.... absolute disaster for your calorie intake. but when you order this, you do not anyhow worry about how much calorie you would put in. I would rate this Pasta to standards at even Sphaggeti Kitchen. This is a must try if you are having a veg day

Ambiance could be improved... seating arrangements could be made more comfortable. but still its a good place to visit.

I was wanting to visit this place from a very long time because I had heard a lot of good peer reviews about this, so I landed up with two colleagues. Firstly, the restaurant was reserved for an entire team and we had to sit in the hookah chamber. The music was very sick and since I do not smoke, I wasn't liking the atmosphere as well. We then ordered for chilli garlic noodles, salt and pepper chicken and chicken wings. And believe chicken wings were horrible. They tried to imitate the regular chicken that you get at KFC and I spent the entire time there removing the extra oil from them.

I just like the food of this restaurant but they failed in customer handling . they can treat there customer well. There is waiter Mr. Afsar he doesn't know how to treat with a customer. You guys should have some customers feedback forms with the bill like a survey and give all the waiters there name with the batch so we can understand. Also let them known that a customers are always the right. I would prefer not to come back and face this kind of bad behaviour.

Nice place.
Food is good.... starters were really tasty...... even main course is well with a special mention to thai green curry which accordingly to me seemed the best of the whole lot..... but the most disappointing part seemed to be the dessert section..... since the cakes were not upto the mark and the quality was also not good.... again fish items spoiled the whole mood.....
overall worthy since u get to have a wide range of items in just 549 bucks....

Went for the lunch buffet for my Friends Birth day treat . Foods are,in general, very good. They serve a lot of Starters I Enjoyed them the most. Though didn't like the pizza at all. Main course was disappointed except for the salad dish.Breads are just not good. The ambiance is quite good. Desserts were okay okay.

P.S. :- Don't compare buffet over with BBQ Nations i have listened many people comparing both of them. So if u going with a expectation that will reach to the mark of BBQ Nations, My bad !! you will be disappointed. Other wise its a great place to dine.

I went there with my office colleague on a Friday for lunch. It is really very difficult to enter into Chai Break when you see Barbeque Nation just to the next door. Although went there to change the taste. There are 2 types of seating, one with high stools with no back rest feeling like you are in cockpit or KBC hot seat , and other built into cubicles with cozy seating, two wide screen monitor also placed there playing good hindi songs video.

The buffet had 9 veg + non-veg starters, main course dishes and 4 types of desserts including ice cream. The number of items and quantity in buffet were really value of money

The starters were salt and pepper paneer, grilled prawn, chilly chicken wings, hariyali kabab, tikka kabab, reshmi kabab, mutton kabab, Thai fish, fish tikka and pizza. Almost all the starters were good in taste

Main course also had many items which I had to recall from my pictures as after enjoying starters my brain stopped working. As much I can remember there were soup to start with (Can't remember the ingredients) salad, dal, panner, Biryani mutton and Rotis to order. Desserts were not good instead of I should say awesome with  ice cream, hot Gulab Jamun, 3 types of pastries and chocolate tart

Overall the experience was really good but still have one concern with starters. They serves it very fast, so in a minute or two you will feel tired. Might be this is a strategy so that one can not eat as much he/ she could. This is why I have to give 4 rating instead of 4.5

Everytime we plan to visit Chai Break , we end up eating next door in Barbeque Nation instead, but this time we were determined to have the lunch buffet there. Priced at 549/- (A.I.) the buffet is definitely a value for money . The decor and ambience makes one feel very good.
The buffet included a complimentary drink, 11 veg/non veg starters including pizza and pasta, soups(with garlic sticks and butter), small but tasty spread of main course, and desserts which included pastries, tarts,gulab jamun and ice cream. We ordered blue lagoon in drinks.All the starters were very good in taste specially the salt and pepper chicken and prawn, only down side was the reshmi kabab which seemed a bit dry. The service though was very poor and we had to wait for a long time in between two items, and also had to ask them to serve us the kababs which apparently they forgot to serve us in the first place (such a turn off) . In the main course there was steamed rice, chicken biriyani, mutton , and fish kalia, all of which were very tasty .The mutton was properly cooked and very soft with the right spices. The dessert spread was okayish , though we didnt get to taste the tart as they were out of it by the time we reached the dessert counter. 
Overall in the food front it's a must visit but they should improve the service to make the experience better .

My rating is based on their hookah!! The most pathetic hookah I have ever taken!!! The only real advantage is this place is open late night till 5 am. Their appetizers and drinks are good but they really should improve on the hookah park. I have been here 3-4 times and everytime I ended up disappointed because of their pathetic hookah!!

My rating of 4 for the Sector-5 outlet of Chai Break is mostly because of the ambiance and variety and partly for the food itself.

Recently, on a pleasant Sunday, I went to have buffet here and had quite a good time. There are 2 types of seating, one with high stools and no back rest, perhaps for the pub hoppers, and other built into cubicles with cozy seating, that stretches all the way to the other end along the wall. I could not make much sense of the interiors, hence I assume it must be modern art.

The buffet had 11 veg + non-veg starters, some common main course dishes and 3 types of desserts. The number of items for the price they charge seems good. But in a buffet where the starters are served on the table, one would expect the pieces to be bite sized, which was not the case. What I felt is, if one eats a complete round of all the 11 starters, one would be full with not much space left in the stomach for anything else. The starters were salt and pepper paneer, Thai fish, hariyali kabab, tikka kabab, reshmi kabab, fish tikka (really huge pieces), grilled prawn, pizza, salt and pepper chicken, mutton kabab and chilly chicken wings. All items except the Fish Tikka and the grilled prawn were good to eat. Main course had many items. but I did not have the capacity to browse through all. From what I recall, there were Lemon coriander soup to start with, fresh cut veges, Caesar salad (veg and chicken), Biryani, 2 veg gravy(dal and paneer) and 2 non veg gravy and Rotis to order. Desserts were pleasant with various flavours of ice cream, hot Gulab Jamun, 3 types of pastries and chocolate tart.

Overall the experience was pretty good. Waiters were good enough, but still could use some polishing. I think the size of the starters should be made smaller, and more number of non-spicy to less spicy dishes added to the menu. Caesar Salad was a saviour after the fiery starters.

I have not tried their √† la carte, but by the looks of the buffet, seems the chef should do a good job. Also they have a Hookah lounge separated from the restaurant, which looked quite trendy. I would have no qualms to visit this place again.

Being located close to some of the best Buffet joints in the city is always tough competition but still Chai Break is doing a decent enough job serving some quite delectable and praiseworthy Buffet and A-la-carte dishes to the foodies of Kolkata..Easy to locate next to the famed Barbeque Nation, we went there last weekend for a Buffet Lunch after grabbing a few Groupon vouchers..Coming to the ambiance it has two sections..one for the Hookah while the other for buffet and dine-in..What I noticed that the entire restaurant is themed around WHEELS and GUITARS..even the seating is pretty unique..more like compartments in trains..However the music played was a bit too loud against my liking of a soothing experience..Also the smell of Hookah coming outside might be a bit suffocating for many..The service is fast and the servers are well-behaved and complete professionals in the trade..What amazes me about this restaurant is the HUGE array of BUFFET spread being served..a true gastronomical delight..I don't think any other Buffet joint in kolkata serves 15 STARTERS in the spread and that too at such an economical rate..It was truly massive and we seemed to be full only after having the starters..Coming to the food, we tasted:
Welcome Drink: We ordered TROPICAL BLUE and FRESH LIME SODA..the fresh lime was refreshing while the Tropical Blue was tad too sweet..
Starters: WOW!!!Truly epic..never ever sampled so many starters in a single go..We can't took a second helping of any starter yet were full to the brim after having them..Firstly three varities of Chicken Kebabs..TIKKA..RESHMI..HARIYALI.. While the Tikka and hariyali were absolutely lip-smackinh found that the Reshmi Kebab was a tad too hard and dry..DRY CHILLI CHICKEN follows next..just the usual affair but cooked well..loved the punch..CHICKEN SALT AND PEPPER was the star of the starters..I always like dishes which are subtle and mild in flavours without hurting your taste buds..quite brilliant..CHEF'S SPECIAL CHICKEN WINGS were also quite tasteful..loved the crispness of the outer skin..expertise shows in the dish..SARSON MAHI TIKKA and THAI SPICY FISH were up next..the quality of fish was not great in the kebab which kinds of pull down the dish while the thai fish was no short of perfection..lovely balance of flavours..the basil sauce tasted quite hot..MUTTON SEEKH KEBAB was not good at all..way too hard and a bit too spicy for my liking..kind of lacked in flavours..SHANGHAI PRAWN was served last and sadly even though we loved it the most can't have a second helping..a good cost-saving strategy actually..they served fresh Tiger Prawns and it was crisp..In the Veg section they served CRISPY CHILLI BABYCORN..POTATO WEDGES..SHANGHAI PANEER..SALT N PEPPER PANEER..PANEER TIKKA..VEG SEEKH KEBAB..Tasted Babycorn which is my all time favourite and the Potato Wedges complements other starters perfectly..They also served Chicken Tikka Pizza and Chicken Pasta along with starters..
Mains: Not as lavishing as the starters but you can eat to your heart's (and stomach's) content..Quite beautifully planned section..Had CHICKEN SWEET CORN SOUP..CHICKEN CAESAR SALAD which has both freshness and crunchiness due to fried breads..CHICKEN BIRIYANI..FISH KALIA..MURGH MASALA.. MUTTON ROGANJOSH..Loved the Fish Kalia..done bengali style with small cubes of alu..perfect flavours..the Mutton was the star among the Mains..so soft,juicy that it literally falls apart with the fork..loved the flavours of fried onions in the dish..indeed a gastronomical pleasure..Biriyani was also decent in taste..in the Veg section they had KALI DAL..VEG GREEN CURRY..CHANNA MASALA..PANEER MAKHANWALA..
Deserts: Denitely after such perfect starters and mains our expectations were soaring high only to be subdued by this section..Had few PASTRIES..TARTS where I simply adore the biscuit cups..baked to perfection with a nice aroma of butter..Also they had GULABJAMUN and ICE CREAM but nothing significant to talk about them..
Overall this is undoubtedly the best Buffet in town when it comes to balancing between PRICE and QUALITy..definitely serving you 15 starters and 14 Main courses at a meagre price of rs.549/-(incl tax) in today's world is¬† like a dream Christmas gift..HIGHLY RECOMMENDED from my side..
Food: 4/5
Pricing: 5/5
Service: 4.5/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5

It is kind of hookah bar. We went on friday night and was pretty late, though they kept open till late around 1 p.m. No drinks available, i thought the place to be different with loud music but it was pretty quite and soothing numbers were played on. We order salt and pepper fish and sticky chicken wings and both were delicious.
Service was good. I didnot find it to be extrardinary.

This review of chai break is completely based on their service for buffet which they serve for 549/- per head . We went there for lunch as an office outing. This is located below RDB Boulevard. I have attached the buffet menu as a reference . If you are looking for a decent buffet you can check the attached menu and hop in. The reasons why you should try the buffet : -

1. Really Really long line of starters and i mean really long ( Check attached menu ).
2. Most of the items in the starters are really good .
3. The prawn item is unlike the prawn items they serve in other buffet locations. It is a different recipe .
4. Humble main course ( Mutton dish was okay which means you are almost paisa vasool )
5. More humble dessert ( After having so many starters i would naturally be satisfied only with gulab jamun and ice cream ).

Cons:-

1. Guys who are serving are a little inexperienced. We actually had to wait for our starters to complete and then they served us water but i was really impressed with this one guy so for once i will let it go.

To summarize if you are looking for a budget buffet experience with a long line of starters¬† you should¬† definitely go for Chai Break buffet. And if you are new to salt lake and have not had a whole lot of buffet experience and your taste buds are not that worned out you should definitely try coming here. 

Would come back for the famous hookah . Till then happy munching :)

Though I had an impression that this place is famous for Hookah and snacks but its worth mentioning that it also offers a perfect dine in facility.It is open till late night with a big screen playing good songs to tap your feet to its rhythm.

The staffs, ambiance, hookah, starters, main course, desert, mock tails everything is superb and a very good refreshment from a boring schedule.

I am like a permanent visitor to this place and I suggest a big "YES" to everyone who are planning for it.

Visited this place for the first time with a friend, on a Friday night to unwind the week's stress. We reached around 9 so there was not much rush. Most people were already leaving. 

The place is well lit with proper seating arrangements. There is a separate section for customers who opt for the hukka service. There is good music playing at a decent sound level. There are TVs set up with sports channel up and running. The food was good too. We had a couple of non-veg starters. The Shanghai Chicken was decent. Alfredo Fusilli Pasta was good. Over all, I liked the place and would definitely visit again. :)

Not at all satisfied with buffet lunch at Chai Break which I visited few days ago. In fact there are eleven non veg starters but the preparation is not of superior standard. I did not find much variety in the main course as well. Dessert section is just okay. Where food is the main concern, I am extremely sorry that I cannot recommend Chai Break to anyone rather one will find Barbeque Nation , Ocean Grill or Jaiselmer with similar budget , those who are famous for their awesome food & ambience.

We went for the buffet today. The interiors were good. The ambience was youthful. However, their food was delicious to say the least. And by food I mean the starters!!! The spread was not only vast but all the items were Perfect. The starters would definitely make a way into a food lover's heart. Honestly, we did not have much space for the main course. However the little that we had (Butter naan, biryani,paneer makhani,chicken and mutton roganjosh) were good enough. The desserts offered made sure that we end our lunch on a happy note. The prompt @and courteous behavior of the staff was commendable. And all of these came at a wonderful price which added to our delight.
However, if something irked me it was the annoying presence of a T. V.. However,it is a personal preference to not bring T. V into a meal.

My experience today at chai break, what can I say, was simply awesome.. We went for lunch today in the buffet section, till now my belly is full. Great food, nice decor and well behaved staffs. All the starters were simply great. They served a moctail as welcome drink. They served chicken hariali kebab, chicken reshmi kebab, chicken tikka kebab, fish tikka kebab, mutton seekh kebab, dry chilli chicken, salt & pepper chicken, potato wedges, chilli baby corn, chilli wings, another fish item and one prawn item and also a chicken pizza. So, after this we were too full to have anything in the main course. But the items in the main course were equally delicious, specially the biryani and mutton rogan josh. Finally, in the desert section we tried out hot hot gulab jamuns, delicious chocolate tarts, yummy chocolate pastry and ice cream with chocolate sauce.. This is the best buffet that I have tried till now.. This is an awesome place with tasty food..

Went for a buffet lunch there on a Friday. The ambiance and decor is bright and classy. The food here is different than other kebab/tandoor based buffets. Other than the traditionals, the chilly prawn and the chilly chicken brought about a refreshing change of taste. ¬†There were 9-10 different starter. The main course was equally diverse but the mutton curry stood out. The food was delicious and the dessert was even better. The service was equally good. Tried a hookah later and it was good too. A very fulfilling lunch experience.

There's something about the ventilation or the air quality that bothers me each time I have hooka there. I don't face this in any other Chai Break. No idea why they reduced the size of mojito glasses. Food is good though. Indian cuisine tastes fine.

Well during my office night life outings and gatherings..I had visited this place so many times in my life..

It also offers free wifi.. do you need to know anything else..?? Go right now..

Offers great foods and awesome hookah..

Super awesome ambience...

Must visit

I'm a regular at chai break( all outlets!) and I find this outlet very spacious and welcoming. For so many years this chain has been a perfect hangout spot for me and my friends. The food, the hookah and ambiance. 
This particular outlet is a year old, located in RDB boulevard in sec V
The food here like all their other outlets is amazing. 
However today the pizza wasn't good, which we got replaced. Initially there was some tiff with the chef which the owner helped resolve and like a good host helped us get an improved pizza. I really appreciate such good behavior.
The pasta was delicious and like I always order one hazelnut cuppachino which tasted as good as it smelled.

Overall a good place with nice food and great hospitality.

This Chai break is right next to my office in Sec-V. Accessibility is great. Was in my hit list for long, finally one day I decided to try.¬†
I am a foodie by nature and am usually very difficult to please, so when I am rating it 5, you are gonna like it :-)

First, the core part, Food. Will you believe if I say that this is one of the best ever food quality I have experienced?¬†
Well, first thing is the variety of the dishes they offer. The starter model is same. You have to be in your place and they will keep serving. I am just amazed with the variety. From chilli chiken to tengri kabab to pasta to tandoori chichen - they have it all. Food is always served fresh and hot and let me tell, it is awesome!!!! And they choose the sequence of the food in such a way that you never get bored. Too good I must say !!

If you have tried this type of other restaurants, then you know that they dont serve good main course. I developed the same perception over last few years. With the same thing in mind, I kept less space in my stomache for the main course and that was a mistake. The mutton biriyani, the mutton dish and the chicken were out of the world. Dont remember when was the last time I found mutton and chicken being so nicely cooked.¬†

If you are foodie, trust my recommendation and go there just for food.¬†

Since it is a review, I have to complete other points as well, so here they are -

Ambience - Ok type. Nothing great
Price - it is a give away. 550 including tax for such as sumptuous meal ? You wont get it anywhere, I bet !!
Seating arrangement - I dont like the high chairs. Too high and not comfortable
Drink - turn off ! they had one lozenge tasting drink...that was not good

Hope this review helps. Enjoy the food :-)

Pros: Great food, interesting menu, hookah available
Cons: Expensive, large area hogged up by office goers who take the buffet which is really bad

The only Chai Break outlet that offers non-veg food which is a great addition to its already great menu. Stick to the continental fares and skip the Indian and Chinese if you really want to have some fun. The pizzas are amazing, the garlic bread truly innovative and one of the best in the city. The pastas are really good too (spaghetti agli olio is a family fave) and the bakes really good/ You really can't go wrong here with any of the items on the continental menu including the sandwiches. The only downside is the food takes some time to prepare so be ready for the wait - it will be worth it.

Will give a 5 for the ambience and music.
Have opted for Lunch buffet.
Starters are good with options....no suauces provided or available.
Main course is not good with very limited options and average quality food.
Desserts and sweets are also average with limited options.
Have heard good reviews  of Chai break from friends but my experience is not at all satisfying. May be the quality was down for the pujas as i visited during Durga puja.

I heard alot about dis place for their buffet joint. Nd was eagerly waiting to visit this place.. Yesterday i went there... Dis place is located just the next door of the famous barbeque nation... So there is no prblm to locate dis place. 
When i reached there.. Only one table was empty.. So i was bit lucky... 
I went for the buffet lunch actually. 
They 1st served one complimentary drink(thumbs up/sprite). Nd after dat dey started to serve d starters.. Which was vast... They served min 10-12starters....there were chicken starters(4-5), fish starters(2-3), prawn starters, veg starters(2-3), 1chicken pizza. 
They served 1by 1 nd i started to gobble  them one after another... At the end of starter i was so full, that i could barely taste ne main course item. Bt i decided to taste some of the items.. In dis section there was chicken biryani, chiken masala, fish kalia, mutton kasha. Nd some of the veg items(i dint touch even). Mutton kasha was really very nice.. Nd the mutton was very soft. Bt one thing is very disappointing  that salad section was vey less.. Nd after dat i headed to the desserts section(my fav).... There were hot gulab jamun, 3 diff pastries nd 1chocolate tart nd vanilla  ice cream... In dis section i specially mention 1 item. Dat is the strawberry  pastry.. It ws a heavenly experience...and the rest was good. 
Overall it was a very good experience..nd in terms of quality nd items 549(the buffet price) is pretty much reasonable. 
Overall it was a very good experience...

It was¬† Tuesday early this month I visited Sec V. Felt hungry during Lunch Break and headed for BBQ nation. The moment I reach the gate I noticed a restaurant named "Chai Break" and changed my plan and got into Chai break for lunch buffet. Ambience wise this one is not an upscale but as per food is concerned this one is¬† graded A++. They welcomed me with a mock tail which is complimentary, they have long list of starters which I lost count of in the end. All present Chicken, prawn, fish, lamb. Baby corn also need special mention under veg. Pizza was above average, I somehow skipped the pasta. In the main course mutton was soft and tasty. There were some more dishes but I tried only biryani and chicken. Then jumped on the dessert section having lovely chocolate truffles¬†, "Black Forest" my personal favourite and others.Special mention --¬†A gentleman¬†with glasses who is supervising was superb enough provided warm attention to me ( I was dining single). I wanna visit this place again in future.

Chai Break; One of the most underated restaurant who makes the best Chinese food in the city. As the dish sounds so common but the taste is definitely divine. Mixed fried rice, pan fried chilli fish and chilli chicken were on my list. Personally I don't like the hookah here as they get you choked the very minute you smoke. With repeated attempts , the servers couldn't do anything about it, though they were courteous and polite.
Other than the hookah and the colours of the wall which were way too dull and monotonous, I love this place for it's food.

Thank you

One of the most cozy hanging out place in Salt lake Sector-5 area with huge TV screen on display!!! Apart from that the place serves very good mocktails. The food is also so-so. Would not say veryyy hi-fi but it's reasonable and fine. One bad thing about this place is that the food quality is not consistent! Sometimes they serve you the food that would be finger licking but sometimes the chicken would be too hard to be bitten.Even the brownie with icecream is a flop at this place!!!The staff is very responsive and overall it's ohk-ohk!!

I expected loud music nice warm environment, but it was different, no good music, ambience is ok types, service is slow, food is average and prices are high. Overall, not a cafe which one would like to go specially, just like any other cafe.

Went to chain break for a team lunch and we opted for the buffet. They serves a lot of starters both for veg and non veg. In non veg there were about 6 options in chicken consisting of Chinese recipes and kebebs, 1 mutton, about 2 fish variations and a prawn. In veg also they serves quite a lot of dishes including many paneer and baby corn. They also serves pastas and pizzas both for non veg and veg in starters and a mocktail as complementary drink. Overall the starter part was great and except the fish options I liked everyone of them. For main course there were also many options. I was too full after the starters to try their main course so I directly switched to deserts. The desert part was superb with lots of options. It would have been better if there were other flavours of ice cream other than the strawberry. There were only strawberry flavoured ice cream.

But one problem is they don't provide menu of the buffet. So it's hard to decide which dish to take more or which to skip if u don't know what to come next. Actually I was so full with chicken I couldn't have prawns much inspite of liking the prawn dish more than the chicken. Overall a good experience.

Staff were quite cordial
Food quality is very good.
However, the starters were numerous and took quite long time to reach us thereby making the customer think that its the end of the starters. Also, the better ones come towards the end when maximum of the customers are exhausted with taking the previous not-so-good starters.¬†
And finally, request to review the quality of the fish prep in the starter section - it was to at all good.

The buffet has a huge variety from Kababs to pizzas! We were served with more than 10 starters! I don't exactly remember how many coz it was too many :p :p
The main course and deserts were good too!
The ambience is super cool!
But one thing I didn't like was- The chicken kabab coz it was too dry!

And yes, Really Value for Money!
No restaurants serve so many varieties of starters in this price!

Awesome Experience :)

The ambience is nice for family though few people might find it difficult to seat on high chairs. We were a crowd of 30 people went there for a Friday lunch with a pre booking. They served really a good number of starters starting with Chicken tandoori, Chicken malai tikka, Chicken haryali kebab, Chilli chicken, Chicken pasta, Chicken wings tossed in typical cryspy chicken sauce, chilli fish, fish haryali, chilli prawn, mutton sheekh, cryspy babycorn, cryspy potato , chicken pizza (thin crust) , corn fried, veg pizza , Paneer tikka, chilli Paneer etc. These many number of starter that too came in a range 450 was awesome. In main course they had biryani , mutton chicken. Soup was there in desert they had black forest , gulab jamoon (hot) , ice cream with chocolate sauce , custard etc. The negatives are 1. Too many chickens and they maintain their own serving sequence (u can't jump to prawn directly) 2. Fish quality of fish haryali was not good though prawn size and quality was excellent 3. Though number of items was more they used same sauce for chilli fish, chilli prawn and chilli chicken. 4. Taste wise it's missing that wow factor. It's good but salt is more. 

I have concluded it's excellent value for money if you don't hate chicken. I took a crowd of 30 members where lot of people don't like chicken and they were extremely bored waiting for prawn and fish. One thing you can't deny absolutely nobody can feed these many number of starters in that price range in city of joy but taste wise lot need to be improved. Also, serving sequence should be in customer choice , you should eat what you want to eat and when you want to eat

Chai Break is located beside Barbeque Nation, Sec V. They have a bordered hookah section as well.It serves quite a lot of starters witha ¬†good mix of veg and non-veg. Chicken Reshmi kebab, CHiken Hariyali kebab and the prawn were my pick amongst them. However, I noticed that the food had a tinge of extra salt and spices (maybe due to the lack of grills).
To be honest, I did not find anything on the main course as good as the starters they served. The mutton was stiff, fish again - extra salty and chicken biriyani was 'okay'. The soup, however, did taste good.
They have an awesome spread of desserts..a variety of tarts and cakes. You'll also find strawberry ice and jamuns which do taste heavenly.Ambience - 3

Chai Break Sector 5 is one of those few places where you can walk in at any time, even at 1 AM in the night and still be welcomed. Sheesha served here is good. Ambience is better and the food is the best. Their pizzas are worth tasting along with a variety of finger food they've to offer. They should offer some of the crowd pleaser food from Elgin Road and Ballygunge branches like their rolled pizzas which I found missing in the menu. Nonetheless 4.5/5.

Just about okay i would say.
Had a buffet lunch. They had those 11 starters lined up. Not a single one stood out. In the main course the biriyani n mutton was good.
The deserts like tarts and cake were really good which is why i m giving them 3.5 n not a 2.5. 
They need to improve their food quality in the starters big big time.

We were a group of 11 and I'll be honest,  the only reason we went there is because BBQ nation was full. The food is good, some kebabs quite tasty but the service is much slower than BBQ nation. Also, they kept playing loud blaring music which was a real bother as we were right next to the speakers. Despite several attempts no one turned the volume down or even told us that they couldn't. Desserts were decent, the tarts were particularly good but the main course like in most buffets wasn't really great. I would request them to improve service if they want to compete with the likes of BBQ nation and ocean grill.

went there with a team of 17 people. we were seated at some high chairs - which none of us much appreciated and saw no reason to have in a buffet restaurant where people would need to climb down frequently to get their food from the spread. apart from this - the interior was nice and vibrant.

coming to the food - they had an elaborate starter offerings - served on the table. There were around 15 odd items and they were quite good- the ones which almost all of us liked are pizza, pasta, potato wedges, crispy baby corn. the pizza there was one   of the best i ever had. a couple of the kebabs tastes a bit stiff though- as if they were not freshly charred. but the rest of the items compensated well. the veg offerings to vegetarian foodies were also varied and tasteful. by the time we reached the main course spread - we were almost full. main course had awesome biriyani, steam rice, mutton items to name a few. i loved their veg thai curry - it was awesome and more authentic than many speciality restaurants. there were choices of soup and salads too.
desert section had ice cream, gulab jamun and different varieties of pastries. i think this can be improved by adding some variety - like indian sweets/ kulfi etc. however, all the items were fresh and tasty.
the service was all the way very cordial. catering to a group of 17 people with varied preference was no easy job and they did pretty well there. full marks there.
overall a nice experience, i plan to visit there again - if not for anything else , for their thin crust pizza- which was excellent.

Went there with a team of 45 for buffet. The ambiance was nice,well lit. The hookah section was separate thus any interference was not there. Coming to the menu, the spread was pretty eleborate & had 17 starters to begin with. And most of them were awesome to say the least.Special mention to chicken wings ,Chicken salt & pepper,chilli chicken,sarson mahi fish tikka & chilli baby corn. It was a much welcome break from having kebabs as starters as is the case for most of the restaurants with buffet spread. And must say,they tasted pretty much awesome.We overloaded ouselves with so much starters that we could hardly eat anything in main course. The main course had,mutton roganjosh,fish kalia & chicken masala. Just for the sake of writing this review I tasted all of them,but was a bit disappointed with the mutton which was a bit hard & difficult to chew. The rest was good enough. The desert spread was average but tasted too good to say the list. Lemon tart,pastries,Hot gulab jamun & ice-cream was the spread. The lemon tart was fresh & tasted awesome & so did the pastries. An extra point for the desert!!! I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of the food!! The service was too good!! To serve a team of 45 is no easy task,but we were not kept waiting for a single sec!! Brownie points for that!!Only setback was the high stool like chairs on which one literally has to climb to be seated,is a bit inconvenient! I would go back soon hoping that they maintain the quality of food & service.¬† Highly recommended!

A so so place. Firstly the ac is too cold, not at all comfortable, parking is a issue, the bar counter and the ambience does not match at all. High stools look out of the place. Food is average. The tea is nice. Crowd is not very classy...is not a place for quiet meetings or quiet casual conversations. Portion sizes are real small and no value for money.

Went there with my partner for lunch. We had a table reserved for us. This is a good restaurant located in sector 5 just beside barbeque nation. We went for the buffet lunch. At first we were served  complementary drinks which was quite good. Followed by the drinks they served the starter's which contained chicken, mutton, fish, prawn, paneer, potato wedges, baby corn and others. About 10-11 starter's were served to us. After consuming all the starter's we were almost full for the main course. They had plain rice, panee pasinda, chicken biryani, chicken Kossa, mutton rogan josh, fish, salad, soup etc. For dessert we had strawberry ice cream, black forest cake, chocolate turt, hot gulb jamun etc. The most interesting part was after consuming all these items we had to pay Rs-449/- inclusive of all taxes. Which was great. The only cons was the service which could have been better.

Went for lunch yesterday. Excellent starters, though served too fast. Being a hardcore non veg, would strongly recommend the potato wedges and the baby corn. The prawns were excellent and the polite waiters always willing to offer more. Its difficult to move on to the main course after the various starters but the fish and mutton rogan josh were just amazing. Would strongly recommend to my friends and would come back here soon. The manager Mr. Debmalya was very polite and assured us that the special price of Rs. 449/- ( all inclusive ) for the lovely buffet will be effected till November. Goutam Roy

We went there for a team lunch on 24th Sep, 15. We had requested a reservation since there were 13 of us and got a 2 PM slot. Seats were allotted almost instantly; however we had to split the group since only 2 tables that can seat 13 people were occupied.
Coming to the food, there was a never ending line of starters. There were so many dishes that a couple of us retired before trying the whole spread! Starter list included, but was not limited to - crispy baby corn, potato wedges, dry chilli chicken, chicken salt and pepper, chicken tikka, chicken hariyali kebab, fish kebab (2 varieties), paneer kebabs (again 2 variations), prawn, mutton sheek kebab, pasta and thin crust pizza, chicken wings, paneer salt and pepper...along with a complimentary drink (crusher) to wash these down.
The main course was simple and sufficient with breads, soups, a couple of pastas, mutton, chicken and fish curry, biriyani/plain rice, dal, paneer and Indian breads. The desserts are worth mentioning as the cakes and truffles were delicious.
Allover this was a good experience, definitely a great place for an office party. The interior decorations are a bit on the heavier and flashier side to my taste, however the stuff were very courteous and mostly prompt with the services we asked for. The dishes are strictly OK by taste but the sheer number of it is enough to overwhelm any regular foodie. On a side note, the spread offers limited options to vegetarians, but this is applicable to any buffet offerings by any restaurants according to my experience.

Overall rating:
Food quality: 3
Buffet spread: 4
Ambience: 3
Service: 3.5
Value for money: 4.5

P. S. Groupon has a deal that gives you the lunch buffet for 450 i.e. you save the taxes, don't miss it if you are visiting Chai Break!

When u enter chai break with ur entire team the place may seem a lil small but surprisingly we all seemed 2 fit in. Today we went 4 a lunch buffet. There was a wide variety of chicken, fish, prawn veg starters. The staff was very cordial. They kept feeding us till we begged them 2 stop. I would specially mention their pizza, chilly chicken , chilly baby corn, salt n pepper chicken and panner and their reshmi kabab.The chocolate tart was simply delicious and their gulab jamuns were so soft. I was too full to eat the maincourse but my colleagues really like their succulent mutton.Overall an awesum experience. The decor is also very nice. Would love to visit them again for their pizzas and pastas

I love their Chowringhee outlet, and its a delight that Chai Break is now functional in Salt Lake and serving non-veg too! This one is a bigger joint and the menu includes some nice mocktails and popular oriental dishes. They make nice pastas - I like the pesto and Al funghi varieties. Also I like the look of their hand-painted menu card! I hear that the buffet is a pure delight for foodies. Service needs to be more canny!

Last weekend me & my 8 office friends went to this restaurant for buffet lunch. We went their around 12:40 pm. When we go inside, saw most of the seats are full and two 6 seater tables are empty. Receptionist Mr. Shantanu attend us and behave too rudely and asked us come back around 2:30 pm. We asked him give us assurance about time so that we can wait. But he told us wait if possible we can provide you the seats. We told him we can wait but please assure us.¬†

After several arguments he talked with us very badly. After that Mr. Aftab came and meet with us. He understand the situation and he asked us wait for 10 minutes. If the booked persons not come then he'll provide those seats within 10-15 minutes.¬†

He arranged the seats for us within next 5 minutes.¬†

After that everything goes smoothly. we enjoyed the foods all are very tasty. All the service persons are very good. They show proper and good¬†hospitality.¬†

Buffet menu are really cost effective.

Very bad restaurant. We went there with Groupon voucher for a lunch buffet. When I call them for reservation they don't take reservation and said for Groupon coupon first come first serve policy is applied and recommend to come early. We went there before 12PM and almost all the seats were empty. But they refused us to give seat and asked for come after 2:30 PM. They behave just like that we are going to eat for free. The behavior of management was very poor. They don't give importance to customer coming with Groupon voucher. Then why they issue voucher. They harassed us. Who will wait 2 hours and 30 minutes for lunch. No other restaurants in Kolkata behave like this. The 1st thing for a restaurant is behavior and then food. We really disappointed at chai break for this kind of behavior.

The much heard buffet of Chai break has not amazed neither me nor 3 of my colleagues. We decided to give it a try to one of our colleague for his fare well. We landed their sharp at 12:30 but by that time it was crowded and hence we were given the table at the hookah bar.¬†
I have soon realized most of the visitors are from IT and came their with groupon and so we were Though I am not a big fan of using groupon on restaurant.
Starters: ample choice though I did not like the fish but most of them are quite taste less and if you compare to BBQ or recent addition Jaisalmeer its way out of the park.¬†
Maincourse: Mutton was so so. ¬†biriyani taste less.

Overall Its not that much satisfactory to revisit it again

Went For buffet lunch on wednesday afternoon. Service was worst that I can ever witness. Food was above average but was served chilled. Desserts were not at all good. Only vanilla ice cream was served (with no ¬†sauce topping). Main course was dull than ever. Second Round of starter was served After main course. Complimentary drinks were healthy enough to taste like syrups or might be something else too (which we cant predict). Only the look and feel was good.

A nice place just beside Bar-B-Q nation. They have a hooka section and a dining section, ambience is good, well decorated and smart interiors, very much crowded in a normal weekday also with mostly office anxd college goers. The buffet is 449 including taxes.
Starters : starters are served at table, they served chicken tikka kabab - superb, chicken hariyali kabab-superb, chicken reshmi kabab-great, thai fish - very bad taste, chili chicken dry - blant taste, pepper fried chicken - average, sanghai prawn-very good, chicken wings-average, mutton seekh kabab-was good but burnt kinda taste. Pizza: thin crust very tasty. Many Starters, taste was good specially for the kababs. Except potato wedges any other Veg starters were not offered though.
Main course - soup pasta and main course is on spread. Chicken Biriyani was too good, chicken masala and mutton rogan Josh both was awesome. Pasta was too bad.Didn't taste any other item. 
Dessert - chocolate tart - heavenly, ice cream with chocolate syrup,  pastries and gulab jamun. Overall a great range of items in much economic range. A must go place for all sector v office goers for good food and most college goers also due to the hookah joint. Although I feel maybe due to huge crowd the service is not very appreciable but ok.

I've not opted for a la carte here, so can't comment on that....just talking about lunch buffet they offer.... well, there were so many varieties of course... some of the items were decent also.. paneer, baby corn, chicken biriyani, chicken curry, chicken salad. The deserts were not so bad, too. But they do not maintain quality of all the items they serve. So at the end of the day, it doesnot matter how much variety you offer, how much pocket friendly buffet spread it was, if the food was not up to the mark people will not think of visiting that place twice.

We went to Chai Break to celebrate my sister's birthday . We were concerned about the ambience as my 5 year old nephew was also with us. But the moment we took our seat, we freaked out. Not only did he enjoy the loud music playing in the background but also loved the high chairs and great option of deserts.

For us , the ambioence was awesome and the food was superb.There was numerous starters to chose from.And all of them was very tasty.

We had a very good experience at Chai Break , and will definately visit again.

Chai Break! If you go by the name, you will be taken for a ride as this is not just a snacks joint, but a full fledged restaurant serving full main course meals, a-la-carte and buffet. Most of the people will prefer buffet lunch over here considering the spread and variety of starters and the price which is a tad below 500 per person inclusive of taxes. Ambience is very trendy and young with an option of taking the high seats, comfy sofa seats or the hookah bar area. The Indian and Tandoori starters are not that great when you compare with the likes of Bar-B-Q nation or Global Grill. Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Tikka, Muton Sheek Kebab and Prawn Tandoori are pretty average. Where Chai Break nudges ahead is the variety and option of chosing from other types of starters. Veg starters like pizza slices, baby corn and shanghaai paneer are decent. Oriental starters like chicken salt and pepper, chicken shanghai and a few others are very delicious. Will not recommend to go for any pasta based preparation. Main course was pretty much standard with no particular dish standing out, though the Biryani had a nice flavour. Deserts were limited but the quality of cakes and pastries were very good. All in all a decent eat out if you are not looking at a big pinch in the pocket and want to have a real stomach filling experience.

Visited chai break based on zomato reviews...but very disappointed all together. Very unorganized. No menu displayed for buffet. They were serving the dishes anyhow. There were huge number of items though..but none praiseworthy at all. The starters were mediocre, chicken starters were too chewy. In main course the biryani was not tasty at all...too dry...very blanch, steamed rice was totally undercooked, chicken, fish n mutton roganjosh was terrible...with the same curry in all the three n with heavy smell of jeera..pasta salad n thai green curry was still ok. Desserts were ok.
Chai Break...plz plz concentrate on your quality and not only on the number of dishes...atleast serve properly cooked food.

Well yesterday was my 2nd visit to this place and dat too within a span of a week.its a place ideal for young crouds.being located in the heart of IT ofc para it attracts a crowd mostly from adjacent offfices.

Pros-colourful decor wd hanging guitars,loud music,hookah section,live matches on telecast(mostly on evening I guess) makes this place very lively.
Coming to food they serve a lot of starters around 13 i guess which is definitely much more than what next door bar b q nation offers.in startes their was salt pepper chicken,hariyali chicken kebab,reshmi kebab,chicken wings(this one was superb)2 fish dishes,1 prawn dish(which was fantastic),mutton seekh kebab(this i got in my frst visit it was not served today although it was served on other tables),chkn pizza,chkn pasta,crispy chilli babycorn,french fry.in main course we had chicken biriyani and mutton roganjosh both were delicious specially roganjosh.their were other dishes too but we were almost full so couldnt taste those.in desert section they had gulab jamun, vanilla ice cream,tart and pastries.coming at a price of 449 I would say this is one of the best buffet in town at the moment. 

Cons-their are few things that I feel the management should take a note of.firstly their should b a proper menu in place.atleast the list of starters available for the day.i said this becoz a lot of starters were not served in our table initally.as I had visited the place earlier this week I remembered exactly wat they serve so i had to ask the waiters time n again for the dishes that were not served.but for any other customer who wd visit the place for first time they would surely miss some of the starters if this is the scenario.
overall the service quality was good but one thing that I didnt like was when I asked for a particular dish that was nt served to us even once, one of the waiters who came in wd the dish said "khaiye na jitna khana hai khaiye buffet mein sab unlimited milta hai".it sounded a bit weird as if we were asking fr the dish to gobble up as much as we can.this is not the tone that u expect generally.in this aspect i wd say bar b nation is way ahead in terms of service quality n  attitude towards customers.
One more thing that they need to work on is the desert section.a bit more variety n quality addition is expected.niether the tarts nor the pastries were good enough.
Food quality - 4/5
Ambience-3.8/5(music was a bit too loud)
Cleanliness-4/5
Service quality-3/5
Price-5/5

Chai break sector 5 saltlake - Have been there hearing lot of good reviews from friends, but my experience was very disappointing.
On 3rd sept of 2015, i went out for lunch with a friend of mine @ chai break. From the door, they promised ala carte menu, but on going inside, they insisted on going for the buffet instead of ala carte and told that ala carte might need more waiting time.
Valuing time, we opted for the non veg buffet menu. The starters, apart from chicken tandoori was horrible. The fish preparations were not at all good. Although the service i must say was good, but the food quality is unacceptable.

I find it might be due to price competition, as one of the waiter asked us whether we have groupon vouchers or not, even though we don't have groupon vouchers, they will charge the same as groupon voucher from us.

Back to menu, we did not attempted the main course and straightforward jumped to the dessert section. Decent spread was offered in dessert though, but the total experience was not at all worthy.

After watching a movie in RDB, we walked into this chai break thinking it would be similar to all the other chai breakfast. The first thing one would notice is the ambience and decor of the place. It was such a turn off. They have confused the entire ambience of a hookah parlour with fine dining with such flashy colours and lights. Coming to the food we ordered. We called for a mushroom starter which was lip smacking. It was a crunchy mushroom baskets with cheese and jalape√±os stuffing inside. Definitely worth a try. The spaghetti pasta we ordered was horrible. Sooo much of garlic and oil. The entire dish led to a disappointment. The staff was courteous and smiling all the time.

Its nice place,but with quite a few flaws.Went with hight expectation which was down the hatch.went by this saturday with my friends for lunch in the buffet section.1st flaw the chairs,not every one of us are 7feet tall one my friend had to get help for getting on the chair.2nd flaw the ambience is ok with a projector & tv to watch but the aircondition was out on a vacation.3rd flaw the service was very casual we all wanted a specific starter to be repeted but that came to was at the last while we were all full & done with the starters,and was force to have a few as they said they made it as we said to.coming to food starters were good.only few of them.main course was a thumbs down didnt like any of the item.Again the desserts were ok.over all one time visit place for me.

Loved this place! All the rating for being such a breather for people who work till late hours and by the time decide to go out for dinner,most restaurants are pulling shutters. Its open all night! The place gives a very "cool" sort of ambience,not exactly one meant for a restaurant.shisha is good and pocket friendly. Food is quite good and will not disappoint.keep the garlic coriander prawn cylinders in menu if you are there.

Today I visited chai break for lunch to celebrate my friend's recent increment. We reached there at 2:30 pm( which was pretty late on a busy Saturday afternoon) and we have to wait for 30 mins for our tables. Ambience is quite good with tall legged chair sequenced in middle and bar at the back. We were served ice cream milkshake as welcome drink which tasted good though I felt bit filled after 3 sips. Starters served were bell pepper chicken, tandoori chicken, Thai fish, Thai chicken, Thai prawn, tandoori prawn, hara bhara chicken kebab, potato wedges, tandoori fish, mutton seekh kebab, pizza and pasta. I liked bell pepper chicken and tandoori fish. Rest of the starters were not good. For some the spices were undercooked and for some the salt was a bit high. We tasted mutton roganjosh, jeera rice and chicken biriyani(tasted chicken poulav) in the main course. Main course again was disappointing and we quickly headed for sweet pleasure. Deserts were good and it was the only saving grace today.  They charged 394 + taxes for lunch buffet which is quite reasonable. I will definitely not suggest chai break over BBQ nation for lunch buffet. But you can try ala carte which might be good. 
P.S: chai break needs to pay special attention in their Service and customer handling. It needs quite a improvement.

The lunch buffet has a huge array of items but it lacks quality. The wide range of starters and decent choice of desserts and main course inspired us for a visit. The starters were simply okay, not a single item that I could specifically remember for being extraordinary. Main course was fine too, again nothing exceptional. Desserts scored better with bit of a variety here and there. Overall, okayish food at decent ambiance and moderate price. 

P. S. Our Credit cards did not work, after  swiping twice they suggested us to visit the ATM nearby. Thankfully my friend was carrying enough cash to pay for both of us. Not a Happy experience.

Chai break !! You'll never be disappointed by the hookah and the food here !! This place has the best hookah in kolkata ! Rather not just this chai break all other chai breaks as well !! 
Crowd is decent ! Just gets a little weird late nights ! But the best part is its open 24/7 ! So u drop in there at 3 in the night or 7 in the morning u'll always get ur hookah !! 
Must try's - spaghetti aglio olio ! the indian and chinese cuisine here !! And Teen Paan Rose !!

Our Sunday Brunch was well planned at Chai Break. If you haven't visited this¬†restaurant¬†try it out and you will surely¬†thank me for this amazing place. Located right beside the BBQ nation, Salt Lake Sec 5, this place is a must-try-out lunch in Kolkata. ¬†They have a hookah lounge for people who wants to enjoy an evening adda¬†while puffing flavoured hookahs.The hookah corner was beautifully decorated ¬†with guitars hanging on the wall giving it a kickass look !! The tables for lunch were little small for 8 of us to fit in but we managed somehow.¬†Their¬†buffet starts at 1 pm, the starters were served by the waiter. Items included chicken tengri kabab, chicken changezi,¬†tandoori, fish kebabs, baby corn, ¬†pizza, mutton seekh kebab, prawns etc. They also served chef's special chicken wings which were lip smacking.!! The Buffet also includes mocktail¬†but as it was not available on that day we ¬†were been given soft drinks can. I was so full gulping the kebabs that I hardly had any energy and space in my tummy to try out the main course. Their main course includes¬†biriyani, mutton rogan josh, ¬†salads, soups and henceforth. Lastly, the dessert was served with ice-cream, pastries and other sweet items. I was so full that I literally felt dizzy eating so much of kebabs that I planned to skip my dinner for that day. But¬†truly¬†at this price its worth a try.

Went for a buffet lunch at chai break... Got Groupon menu so i was cheap for us... Starting from the meny, there was a huge variety..  Like pasta, pizza, kebab of all kind, prawns,chicken, i loved the paneer kebab..i usually don't eat paneers in restaurants but this, here the tast was heavenly... I actually liked it more than chiken... The sweet corn chicken soup is also worth mentioning.. The main course had biriyani and mutton kasha which i found better than flame and grill... The dessert had gulab jamun,vanilla  icecream and cakes,choco tart..   ths section needs a bit improvement because there was only one flavor of ice cream.one must visit chai break for the interiors and starters.. With this price..buffet speard was huge.. I really loved all the starters...i was so busy eating that i forgot to take pictures...!!!

I would have given them 5 out of 5 but I have deducted 1 mark because of they don't have reservation system in weekends and even they don't tell you if they have already some bookings done. For that I have to wait for more than 2 and half hours .

There staff was simply amazing, well behaved, courteous, great work team.

Once you sit on table your amazing rides starts from there, awesome starters from Shanghai Prawn, Changezi Chicken, Mutton Sheekh Kebab, Chciken Pizza, Chicken Salads, Chicken Soup, amazing mocktails., every single item has their own taste. After eating 11 starters you have very less for having something in main course.

Then there wonderful line of desserts was really good.

Out & out amazing place to visit.¬†

Highly recommended :)

Visited this place with family and went for lunch buffet. Initially had some difficulty in getting a table as the place was overbooked. But once we settled down the food n service we experienced was exceptional. The starters were yummy and endless. There was fish, prawn, mutton, chicken, paneer everything. The waiters were serving as if you are in a marriage party, egging you on to have few more every time they served. Though the main course had also a good spread, we really were quite full. After having chicken soup, We went straight for the desert. The blak forest n pine Apple pastries and the chocolate truffle were excellent. Had a few servings of those. Gulab jamun n ice creams were also available but didn't have the heart for those. The restaurant exceeded all our expectations on the food front. Overall it was a nice experience.

Had expected this place to be similar to the one at Elgin Road.. Was pleasantly surprised however! Not only does the food exceed expectations the decor of this place is awesome too! We had opted for the buffet, the best part of which were the kebabs and the desserts, the biriyani not being too bad either. 
Loved this place ... Would like to come here again! :)

Went on to Chai Break after watching a movie @RDB. The management was noticeably poor at handling people. They refused to put an entry in their manual sheets as they were not sure if they can accommodate. After they cleared the crowd, they let us put our names on their registers. They do not even entertain prior bookings.
Well, talking about the interiors..it was crowded and they tried their ultimate best to fit in every thing possible in it.
Unluckily after a lot of waiting outside..we had to even wait sitting idle in our places inside too. No one bothered to ask for refreshments as they were busy in making starters for the existing customers. We had opted for the buffet and so our 11 starters were served, but there was a mess too. No dedicated waiter was assigned to our table and each time a new waiter came to us..we had to enlist him as to what we had.
Poor management is what I can say but has scope for improvement. 
Coming to food..the food was a bit spicy..but was delicious..(well only the first time for some items)..Different tastes of the same food item on repeats..some were not up to the mark.
Main course was good but desert was not worth it..
Plates and bowls were not available and had to ask everytime to bring it out from their shelves..to serve our needs.
If one can compromise on the hassle..then can go and give their buds a new taste.
A try worthy if so..!!

The most horrible place possible for a lunch buffet..Don't even think of coming here. Situated right next to barbeque nation, it scores an absolute zero in terms of service. U have to struggle to get forks and spoons, waiters behave as if u are eating here for free and the food is pain average. Disgusting experience!

I have visited this place for lunch buffet for two times with my friends using group-on voucher.

After entering this place, first thing I noticed was the colorful wheels attached to the walls and chains hanging from the roof-top. Nice Bollywood music was adding a special vibe towards this beautiful ambiance.

We arrived at around 1:30 pm. We were welcomed by a mock tail. First time we had options to choose among mock tails. I chose Mango Rapture. Second time only one choice was there, Pacific Blue(it was of litchi flavor). Both of them were refreshing.

After this, We were served a huge variety of starters: 

Chicken tangri

Chilly Baby Corn

Potato wedges

Tikka Hariyali

Mutton Seekh Kabab

Seekh Kabab Veg

Fish Tikka

Prawn Kebab

Non-Veg Pasta

Pizza

Chef's special Chicken Wings

Chef's special Prawn

Among these starters Chilly Baby Corn,Chef's special Chicken Wings and Prawn were too good. 5/5 for these starters. Rest others were also good but Prawn Kebab, Mutton and Veg Seekh Kebab were taste-wise little down according to me.

Services were also very prompt.
 

Then we moved to the Main course section. There was also a lot of choices:

Soups

Pasta

Salad

Jhal frezi

Chana Masala

Kali Dal

Paneer Makkhanwala

Jeera Rice

Chicken Biryani

Chicken Masala

Fish Curry

Mutton Roganjosh

I tasted a little bit of these main courses. Paneer Makkhanwala, Chicken masala was very good. Mutton Roganjosh was good but I felt it was little extra salted but didnot hampered the preparation much.

After that I shifted to dessert section. The dessert setion was having:

Black Forest

Dark Chocolate Cake

Lemon Cake

Vanilla Ice Cream

Chocolate Tart

Gulabjamun

Dark Chocolate cake was the best of the lot. A perfect layer of creamy chocolate outside with beautiful moisture inside. I couldn't resist myself to taste it for the second time even though I was almost full stomach.

Both the times my overall experience was very good. Good work Chai Break. Keep it up.

'This outlet of chai break provides great buffet' - said one of my friends. On his strong recommendation, I picked up two Groupon vouchers and paid a visit to this place today afternoon.

Finding this place is very easy for the ones acquainted with the salt lake others. For ones who are not well acquainted with salt lake, take a bus towards sector v and get down at webel bus stop. The straight road takes you to RDB boulevard whose ground floor has chai break, just beside BBQ nation.

The place is not very huge but well decorated. We were seated in the hookah room whose walls were decorated with guitars!

The waiters were courteous and they said they will take some time coz buffet starts from 12:30 and we had reached early. After about 10 minutes, there was a trail of starters !!
Chicken changezi kabab
Chicken tengri
Tandoori prawn
Two fish kababs
Chilli chicken
Chicken pizza
Mutton seekh kabab
And chef's special chicken wings and one prawn kabab.

I specially liked the chicken changezi and the fried fish kabab. They were very tasty.

Now coming to the service! At first the restro was quite empty but suddenly a large group of almost 30 people and we were not given any attention. Neither were we asked whether we need repetition of any starters nor were our glasses refilled with water. Finally after 15-20 mins of sitting idly a waiter stepped in and we asked for starters.

Then we shifted to the main course. There was a huge variety too!
Soups
Breads
Two salads
Roti
Veg and chicken biryani
Lahori paneer
Chana masala
Chicken curry
One fish item
Mutton roganjosh

I couldn't have all these main course items after gulping the starters. I began which chicken Caesar salad which was the best main course dish. I had this twice!! :p the paneer was a little spicy. The biryani was good but we had to go deep to take out a chicken piece and an aloo -_- it was tasty and the chicken was soft but I found the aloo a little sweet. The chicken dish was nice and tasted homely and the mutton item was good.

After this we didn't have enough space for desserts!! :p so after gulping a can of sprite we shifted to the desert section. But I was quite disappointed. The dessert section comprised of
Vanilla ice cream
Chocolate tart
Dark chocolate cake
Gulabjamun
Lemon cake.
Black forest cake

They had concentrated more on cakes and pastries and I found very little variation which disappointed me. I liked the gulabjamun and the dark chocolate cake which were the best of the lot.

I'm thankful to Groupon for providing this pocket friendly deal. The food deserves a 4.5 rating coz of the great starters and the wide variation but I have deducted marks for the poor service. I hope the management will look into it. And the ones who r reading my review its a recommendation that do visit this place by this month before the Groupon offer expires!!

Not much to say.
Average food. below average and nonchalant service.
Waiter got our order wrong. We ordered pasta and a pizza.
Pizza was good.
The pasta was soaked in so much oil that one could maybe swim in it.¬†

Only giving it a rating of 3 because the food wasn't bad, neither was it great.
Would maybe visit again; then again maybe not.

When u open just beside Barbq Nation there are bound to be comparisons. Not as lavish in ambience or food as Barbq but still very good. In these type of resturants most will probably have so much starters that the main course will not matter. Starters were good and served in tables though I would have liked a list first so that I could have prioritize. Fish was really good. Variety in Veg starters was better than Barbq. Main course and desert in par with other resturants. With a discounted Groupon voucher there is nothing much to complain especially when u see the long queue to get into Barbq.

First of all thank you, you awesome people at Chai Break. We now have an easy access to an all night open fabulous eatery so close to home. I live in New Town, and we required such a place. Starting the review, the food is good. They have covered all bases, making available the best from all tastes. From rissoto to biriyani, name it they serve it. A good range of drinks, leaving the alcohol out. 
The range of hookah is also exquisite. They serve a good range of flavours for sheesha. I have taken my friends out to this place for numerous times. Enjoyed the delicacies a numerous times. Keep doing g the fab job.

This is the only place open throughout night in salt lake and hookah is good. Ambience is average but gives a safe feeling if you are visiting dead in the night. Staff not very friendly. They played Essex vs Birmingham cricket match on TV and when requested to change channels they refused saying customers are watching. We were baffled who were watching as everyone were tuned away from the TV. Plus point is seating capacity is good with two rooms. We ordered 4 hookahs and 8 kesar chai and bill amount was around 2200. Music is good some nights with latest bollywood songs and some nights with electro music..

The buffet spread they serve is mind blowing and can give Barbeque Nation next door a run for its money.The ambiance probably wouldn't be the best one around but definitely its lavish spread compensates well for it.I have visited this restaurant a couple of times and would recommend it big time.The service probably is one place where there is room for improvement where the waiters need to become more courteous and polished.
Though a special mention for one waiter- Aftab who is very professional and courteous and stands out of the crowd.As long as the food quality ¬†is maintained keeping the price reasonable enough,this would definitely be one of the best buffets to go for.

Had been seeing the silver door right next to BBQ nation, but never had the urge to peep inside Chai Break....finally one day we dropped in to have dinner....decor is nice, bar counter with 100% non alcholoic drinks is superbly decorated, music is great, ambience is a little spooky, service was horrible the first day BUT the food was awesomely delicious. Gave a feedback on the service which they truly worked on; we visited 2 more times in the same month and service was better...if you want good continental food along with great mocktails till 4AM in the morning, THIS IS THE PLACE...

With a booked groupon coupon I stepped inside one sunday afternoon. As I was a single foodie so they guide me to seat inside the hookah lounge. The 10 starters comes sequentially but among them I was satisfied hardly three. Though they are focusing on more number of starters, they forget to maintain the quality of their items. I prefer the fish starters over other for repeat. Then I move outside for the soup which follows the main dish. In main dish the mutton gravy was good but the mutton was not cooked properly. Biryani was very good. In vegetarian main dish I liked their mix veg item. In the end the desert was better then the other two section. I had to choose for ice-cream,cakes and then had gulabjammons too.
The location was perfect and the ambiance was good for hangout.
PS: They have to look for their service standards and quality of their items. They can't be dominate to the next outlet(BBQ) in terms of quantity.

Located beside barbeque nation. Serves both ala carta and buffet. Buffet spread was huge. We had Groupon vouchers and opted for buffet!  There's around 11 non veg starter and they were enough to make one full. Starters included 2 fish items, 2 prawn items, 1 mutton, 4 variety of chicken, one pizza and pasta. One complimentary moctail goes well with the food. After having so much for starter tried only chicken coriander lemon soup with bread sticks. Soup was light but good. Skipped main course which included biriyani one chicken and one mutton and some veg stuff and salads. Jumped to dessert section  which has 5 options. Chocolate tart and pastries were yummy! If you love food try chai break!! It will make you happy.

Order the cheese fondue and you won't be disappointed! The broccoli salad is a nice surprise too! If you are in a hurry, there's a fix....the buffet! Lunch buffet is interesting and offers many choices for the indian palate! Will be fair to say that pricing is okay for the portion size and quality of food!

Chai Break at Sector-5 is tad different from its other outlets. Here apart from shisha you will get nice buffet meals that is sure to steal your heart. It is difficult for places serving buffet to score more since there are numerous dishes and the majority of them should be good or excellent to leave a feel-good impression on the mind of the foodie. And here we were pleasantly surprised (apart from few unpleasant points after our second visit) since we had very less expectations from this place. When we were here the place was just filled to its brim and we found that it was an absolute necessity to book the tables before you pay a visit.

LOCATION ----- This place is quite prominent and easy to locate, it's located just beside Berbeque Nation, Ground floor of RDB Boulevard, Sector-5, Saltlake city. You may park your car in/around the place though it is tad difficult to find a good parking spot on a weekday afternoon.

AMBIANCE ----- The ambiance is pretty cool and urbane much different from its other branches spread across the city. The place has got a manly look to it, bit robust and contemporary. In the shisha section where we chose to sit there were Guitars all over the place on the walls and in the outer section there were wheel rims and steel chains adorning the walls and ceilings respectively. Overall they have executed things quite well and the interior decor is different yet pleasing to the eyes. I personally felt the Shisha section was a much better place to chill and have your meal since it was less noisy and the volume of the music was well under control unlike the outside section which seemed more of a fish market than anything else. The place is mostly frequented by youngsters so you can well estimate the amount of noise that is produced when all of them are together that too in a relaxed mood. The place has got very little acoustic treatment done that makes it even more noisy. I quite liked the sitting arrangement which was divided into cubicles. There were high chairs and tables as well in the outer section. The televisions were being played and the sound was channelized though the speakers, so you get to see the music video as well as listen to the song, noticed that mostly bollywood numbers were being played.

FOOD ----- We went in for lunch buffet that included several starters which were served at our table in a very short span of time, while we had to help ourselves with the main course and desserts which were placed in the outer section just outside the shisha room. There was Sweet corn Chicken soup which was extremely soothing, light and tasty, even tasted better with a bit of chilli vinegar. The starters included: Crispy chilli babycorn, Potato Wedges, Paneer Tikka, Chilli Chicken, Salt Pepper Fish, Tandoori Chicken, Mutton Seek Kebab, Tandoori Prawn, Chicken Tikka, Sarson mahi Fish Tikka and Ceaser chicken salad. Apart from these chef's special Chicken wings, Thin crust Pizza, chilli Prawn were served which were good to taste. We also loved the chilli chicken, Tandoori Prawn and Mutton seek kebabs, other items were nice as well. Few fish dishes were not good and we could not finish them. Among the main courses we had - Lahori Kadai Paneer, Veg Jalferezi, chana masala, Mutton Roganjosh, chicken masala, Fish kalia, Dal makhani, Chicken biriyani, Jeera rice. Among these we liked the Mutton roganjosh and Lahori Kadai Paneer, other items were good as well. Though I found only rice in the chicken biriyani, it should have got more chicken or aloo pieces in it. The entire dessert section was just great. I really loved the Chcolate tarts, black forest pastries, chocolate pastries, gulab jamuns and ice creams. Among the mocktails we had mixed fruit mocktails and soft drinks, the mocktail was good to taste but was tad too thick and served in unimpressive plastic glasses.

SERVICE ----- Guys serving us were pretty courteous and friendly, and were serving us starters no matter how many times we ordered for them, but they were hurrying too much and we were unable to finish off all the starters and we had no choice but to waste a lot of food, which I absolutely hate to do. I also did not like the incidents were they slipped one plate and it was broken, also spoons and forks were going down on the floor every now and then. I feel overall the service can be more sorted out, more professional and unperturbed.

OVERALL ----- Here is my overall granular rating:

Food: 3.7/5
Service: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 3.6/5
Buffet Spread: 3.8/5
Value for money: 4.3/5

So another cool restaurant serving nice buffet spread as well as shisha right here in Sector-5. If you go with Groupon vouchers then the value for money factor even increases exponentially.

Cheers!

went thru groupon yesterday. Starter was too good I tried all including veg with non veg. I liked chili chicken starter with chicken haryali kebab. Only thing I found I was not much asked about the starter item that do I need more. in the beginning non veg starter Item was served all at a time on my plate. there was no second time ask from anybody. it was me who requested waiter and demanded the item. might me due to rush but that did not justify me because it was weekday. any how I am giving full marks.

Don't go by the name. Chai break has a lot to offer. Was there last afternoon celebrating my brothers anniversary and it was very impressive.  They have a tie up with groupon for their lunch buffet at inr 449. That's a steal considering they serve unlimited starters which includes chicken, mutton, fish and prawns. There's also pasta and pizza on offer. After all this if you are still in a position to eat more then there is a lunch buffet too that has biryani,  rice and curries  . Maybe they can add a few more items in the dessert menu but overall superb value for money.

Went out for lunch on a Thursday afternoon from office...very conveniently located beside BBQ Nation so wasn't a difficult place to locate...
Ambience was good...there's always some loud music going on in the background..be it from the TV or the music systems...

Coming to food,we opted for the buffet which was reasonably priced considering the no of starters,mains and deserts...We started off with fish and prawn kebabs...followed by chicken and mutton kebabs,pizzas and also some Chinese starters...their speciality was Shanghai Prawn which has a tangy flavour..
For mains,I couldn't eat much...but it was pretty okay-ish...

Coming to deserts,they had 3-4 varieties of pastries,tarts,gulab jamun and ice-creams...they tasted god too

I was here last Sunday with a friend and was pretty hungry. Also, it was raining cats and dogs outside. With recommendation from my friend, we went for a Pizza. I am not a very big fan of pizzas, but still, I liked it. It was thin crust, just the right level of strength to hold the topping, still not too crunchy... also, they prepared it with little cheese, which was really little; something I loved them for. I also had a grilled fish which was pretty good too. My favourite at an evening snacks joint is the cappuccino and I ended up having 3 of them. Overall a nice joint, just a tad expensive, but with all the ambience, it covers up.

I visited this newly opened restaurant at sector 5 salt lake with my full project team. We opted for the buffet which costs 449/head. The menu was as follows -
Starters and appetizers: 3 types of salads, soup, baby bread with butter, 1 chicken fried item, 1 chicken kebab, 1 fish fried preparation, 1 fish kebab, 1 tengri kebab, 1 prawn grilled prep, thin crust pizza, 1 chef's special wok chicken wings
Main course: chicken biriyani, fish kalia, chicken kosha, mutton kosha, raita
Desert: 2 chocolate cakes, 1 chocolate filled sweet, 2 pineapple and fruit cakes, vanila ice cream with chocolate sauce.....Phew!!Finally I am done recalling all tge item...pat on my back!!
Now let me start with the review of the overall experience - 
1. Interior good enough
2. Service needs a lot of improvement. And when I say a lot, really it is
3. Starters need to be prepared and presented right at the buffet counter. Get it simple,  u guys are new to market and that also just beside BBQ nation...u are keeping such a low cost buffet with this huuuge menu...its pretty clear u are into market and here for a healthy foody competition...u gotta keewp ur options open.I mean there is no point of making a section of food (read starters) limited. People at sector 5 predominantly don't have that time to wait for u to bring the next item despite of that to be a sumptuous dish like neverbefore. 
4. Main course - I believe they are following the strategy as "Keep it simple silly".  But nevertheless, the main course was really very nice
5.Desert - Main course (ctrl+c ctrl+v)
Overall, they are beginners, and I think they can do much improvements if the management wants to...and that is why these reviews are for. But yes, I would definitely say, as a new start-up they are far better than any other restaurants like funjabi tadka and ocean grill if I talk about Sector 5 precisely. Definitely everyone should try once.. Ting ting...CHAI BREAK!!!

Location- near infinity mall ,salt lake. Time-9pm .went this place for the first time. I liked the ambience of this outlet more than any other outlet of chai break.
Paneer Tikka,Masala chai , oreo shake and lime soda is highly recommended.Garlic bread  was dissapointing (dont ever try it).hookah was good (paanch pan and kiwi springwater recommended). Had an awsome time with my friends.

Nicely decorated and a cozy place to hang out with friends. Continental foods are good there along with Indian dishes. Buffet is not that great though. Service is little slow and not upto the mark. But overall a nice place to visit. Specially mentioned, mocktails are really good.

Finally I visited this cosy place over last weekend. It was a rainy Saturday and the streets were already waterlogged by the time the clock chimed two and we were just out of a movie from nearby theatre.¬†
The uniqueness of the d√©cor is what first catches your eyes...I liked the high-stool seating arrangement, a funky wheel and guitar on the wall look, it definitely helps make a different style statement. We took a booth for a family of 5, although the seats were comfortable, I found the table to be too small to put plates and cutlery for 5.¬†
Then the appetizers kept coming, and I literally mean that they kept coming. We ate about 6-7 non-veg appetizers and also were offered few starters to try out. Honestly speaking, the variety and flavours were really good and I am glad that everyone enjoyed the array. Although there was a time that they just start pouring everything on to your plate, I found that the servers were in too much of hurry. One should get the time to relish and blissfully enjoy one's meal. But this is something, I guess, they can easily fix.
We liked the ¬†Thai fish saut√©ed, ¬†Tandoori Prawn, Chicken wings a lot. The main course spread was also sumptuous though we hardly were left with any capacity for more! Desserts were decent too. Must admit that it is good value for money. A must visit, I would think.¬†
Forgot to mention that you also get a mock-tail along with the lunch buffet. Net-net a good bargain, good food, great price...

Visited the place last week with my team. Overall ambience is ok but the place feels very crowded. The food is in similar lines with its more extravagant Neighbour barbecue  nation. The service in our case was a bit over enthusiastic. However if you don't get a reservation and Barbecue nations you can definitely go there. The price is also friendlier.

Last week, went to Chai Break.. was very confused where to go since there was CCD Lounge n BBQ Nation.. But thanks to Zomato.. The ambience is quite good with Bollywood 'dhinchak' music.. We ordered #pacificBlue & #icedMocha well i personally liked the mocktail over the cold-iced-coffee.. Then for the starter we ordered #reshmiKebab which tasted good not the best.. Then comes the main course #cheeseStuffedChickenBreast the continental dish, now this was really good, I personally loved this dish..
There is a hookah bar inside which we didn't visit..(our loss) but this is surely a good place to hangout with friends over food and hookah.. One must visit to this outlet.. The price is good..food is good and tasty..ambience is also good..

Superb Food! Nice ambience...average/good service. Had a wonderful time. Took the lunch buffet today using Groupon coupons @449.

Starters were the BEST! At first the service was slow, but later picked up the pace :) Fish starter was the pick of the lot, Chilli Chicken, Chicken Haryali kabab, mutton were also very good! One wud love the starters as alwys :)

Main course was also very good, unlike many other buffets in other popluar restaurants. Specially the mutton was jst awesome!

Dessert was also good enough with a cheesecake, a choclate pastry, ice cream with choc sauce and gulabjamuns.

Overall, the buffet was at par with other popular & famous buffets in Kolkata, considering quality and price.
Had a very good time.

Innumerable visits to this place. It has an ample seating capacity. The food is great. Some of my favorites are asparagus risotto, veg Peri peri pizza, mushroom sandwich, lasagne, spaghetti in pesto sauce and above all Oreo shake in vanilla ice cream. Talking about hookah, that's great too. Go for it.

Today was my first visit at Chai Break.¬†Went straight for the buffet, as it looked super promising at such a price. 11 items just as starters is not joke after all! Everything can't be as rosy as expected... and likewise, the experience had its share of highs and lows too.

The ambiance was cool... liked it. Nothing too flashy and kept at its minimalist best. The staff members were also very prompt and cordial. Coming to the food, following are the items I didn't like on the menu:

Thai Spicy Fish: Totally bland, and cold
Chicken Pizza and Chicken Pasta: Needless inclusions (personal opinion)
Chicken Biryani: The chicken pieces were not very well cooked

The rest were all fine and tasted delicious. I recommend this place to anyone who's looking to try out a variety of dishes at a reasonable price.

P.S. - Couldn't click the pic of every item, as I didn't try out every dish. Sorry but you've to be content with the photos of the ones available.

Initially apprenhensive about their price over quality I had given it a pass. But one day, compeeled by another friend, had lunch and since then I have revisited quite a number of times. I am a fan of their Red Thai Chicken Curry. The platter comes with jasmine rice which is enough to feed two people to their tummy satisfaction! Their grilled chiken and grilled fish are also sumptuous and make sure you order knowing the quantity as it suffices more than required almost everytime for me. Their pizzas are tasty, thin crust, unique. Their mocktails are also good. My friends go ga-ga about their hookah, no idea personally but seems to be a favoruite among a lot. DO drop in, their lunch beffets are also creating a buzz in sector 5. I will write about it , if I catch it soon.

So the promotion party of my office colleagues was arranged here and I with 23 other people from my office visited Chai Break for lunch. The ambience and decoration of the place is awesome and the chairs, in particular, were weirdly cool!! They were like high stools but it was comfortable and I liked that. It was raining heavily outside and so few my colleagues were late and the staff were getting impatient and they kept reminding us that they could have cancelled the pre-booking that we had done as we were 20mins late which I felt to be a little rude to be honest.

Now finally when all of us took our seats they started the arrangements. For complimentary drinks, I ordered Sprite and they gave me a can which was not cold at all. It was normal temperature and so I regretted ordering it.

Now coming to the starters, they served us Chilli Chicken which was delicious, Garlic fish, prawns and another 5-6 starters which I couldn't remember the names but all of them were very good especially the chilli chicken which we asked them to repeat thrice.

The main course was usual like any other buffet place and it was good enough. The desert was also good and I wish they had some sort of chocolate syrup with the ice cream. Overall the meal was worth the money!

Now coming to the cons of the place, the first one I have already mentioned of the staff getting impatient, the second was the Sprite can I got, which was not cold at all, the third was that while having lunch and it was pouring outside we found that the roof was dripping water at some of the tables which was very surprising. I don't know if this was because of the architecture of the restaurant or the building itself. The fourth con was that I felt the restaurant lacked staff, there was a phone behind my table, which kept on ringing most of the time and none of the staff members were able to get it as they were busy serving everyone. Also I didnt get why the phone was not in the reception desk. Anyway the 5th and the last con was that they took a lot of time to repeat the dishes, due to which the entire lunch took over 2 hours to complete. Some of us waited for the baby corn for nearly 20mins before it was repeated again.

All in all my rating is mostly based on the food which was excellent and I am hoping to visit this joint soon and I hope by then they would have improved their services. :)

Recommended!

A place where you may not exercise your choice of items be it the main course at the beginning.Ideally this is expected from any professional resturant and nothing should be imposed on.

The context is my today's experience of a buffet lunch where I had planned to start with the main course first with a beginning of mocktail when finally I realised that with a very professional politeness I have to go by their rules of starting through starters which someone may not opt at all..As a result I couldn't explore much on the main course as my tummy was full by then.

Surprisingly no one ever asked how I would like to start..However the quality ¬†of food ¬†and ambiance was good.

Cannot possibly think of a better buffet in town at the price offered by chai break!! Located just beside the super hyped barbecue nation, this one undoubtedly offers a tough competition!! I paid less than 500 bucks in a limited period offer for a Sunday lunch, and OMG, what an experience it was!! The starters list seemed to be unending, i manage to remember a few of them including prawns, chicken tandoori, chilly chicken, mutton sheekh kebabs( not that tasty), sarson mahi tikka, and another awesome fish starter, a pizza etc etc. ..u can choose one mocktail from a large variety offered, each of them were excellent. We were almost full by the time we went for the main course which had chicken biryani Indian breads , mutton roganjosh, chicken something and a fish something with few veg options too. Desserts included ice creams cakes and hot gulab jamuns. What else do you expect!!! Highly recommended. Surely u will thank me once u come back from the place!! Visiting with a large group very soon for a party!!

Looking to hangout with friends at 2 AM and stumped... well look no further, this establishment chain has made a huge mark upon the face of kolkata with its people-oriented cafes, even at 2 am on a weekday you can see 70% + Occupancy in this joint, its really amazing.Quite recently they have even reduced the price of the shisha, which is cool.

The best thing I liked about this place was it's ambience. We had ordered the fondue, cilantro chicken and fish n chips. The fondue and fish n chips was ok ok, nothing great about them. The Cilantro Chicken was pretty good and I think is an item worth trying. Would definitely want to try their kebabs someday but as of now the best thing about this place is most definitely the ambience.

Location: Ground Floor, RDB Boulevard, Sector 5; Adjacent to Barbeque Nation.

Chai Break is a renowned brand in the F&B industry as well as a popular one amongst the youngsters of the City of Joy. Having spread its roots across the city, CB yet again strikes the City of Joy at Sector 5 with a much higher force. The attack area is quite large with a very different ambiance. This outlet of Chai Break is more of a restaurant as compared to its former ones (caf√©s). 
The AMBIANCE here is quite different from the other branches and is much inclined towards towards the modern style. The place has been somewhat been tried to have a robust feel with the bicycle wheel rims across¬† the wall, steel chains on the ceiling (the chandelier look made of the chains is a plus) & guitars on the walls of the inner section (sheesha area). The seating is majorly in a cubicle style with a few arrangements of high tables and chairs.

About the FOODING, Chai Break offers a full-fledged multi-cuisine buffet option during the lunch hours along with a widespread A La Carte. A group of four opted for the North-Indian cuisine (A La Carte) along with Sheesha:

- Kali Dal (Dal Makhani)
Black lentils simmered overnight along with spot-on seasoning. A well prepared and good to taste dal.
Recommended.

-¬† Vegetable Jhalfarezi
Assorted vegetables saut√©ed along with tender yet, bland pieces of paneer in a flavorful gravy. The paneer pieces didn't¬† taste as great in a stand alone manner but, when had along with the gravy & vegetables, did compliment.

- Garlic Naan
Perfectly baked and crisp. An addition of chopped coriander leaves could sum up as a positive. Nevertheless, tasted good.

- Mix Kulcha
The filling was flavorful and generous. The kulcha was nicely baked, crisp and good to eat.

- Aloo Kulcha
The filling of a mish-mash of potatoes and seasoning was spot on and the kulcha was baked to perfection.

- Vegetable Pulao
The perfectly biryani-style cooked rice tossed along with assorted vegetables did taste great.
Recommended.

- Onion Salad (Complimentary)
Nothing exceptional, thinly sliced onions served along with green chilis and lemon wedge.

- Mustard Onion (Complimentary)
Thinly sliced onions mixed-in with mustard sauce. Was different but, didn't taste as great. Just about decent.

- Plain Roasted Papad [2 pieces a plate]
Baked to perfection. Crisp and nice to eat.

‚Ä¢ The SHEESHA was smoky and lasted long.

The polite and friendly STAFF served at a moderate SPEED.
The PRICES were inclined towards the moderate end.

Overall was a good experience.
- Would love to revisit for other cuisines.

It's was a treat from zomato. I was very excited when I got the buffet voucher from zomato. I visited here few weeks ago. It is located at RDB Boulevard. Ambience is really good. Decorated with guitars and beautiful light combinations. At first they served me a mango mocktial with mint topping. It was cool enough to beat the heat. After that its was a rain of starters. They served eleven non veg and veg starters. Among them thai spicy fish, oak fried chicken were best. After so much of it there was no room for main course though I tried chicken biriyani, chicken masala. Biriyani was very light and tasty. There were several items in dessert section. I tired some of the pastries, gulab jamun and ice cream. It was great time there thanks to zomato :D

Me and my friends planned to go to Chai Break for lunch today. Seven of us were there and we really had a great time. The ambience is quite funky with spacious seating area. Coming to the food, there is a large buffet spread for its customers. Almost 10-15 different types of starters along with pizzas and pastas. All of them were delicious especially the prawns and chicken pepper salt was also too good. I can't even name the others, coz I was engrossed in having the food. The main course items were comparatively less in number but I think that's a good idea coz after having so many starters there's not much space for the main course. Still the chicken biryani tasted great. There were also chicken, mutton and fish preparations. Finally coming to the desserts, simply lip smacking. Quite a number of cakes and pastries with ice cream and gulab jamun. Really a large spread with great service. The waiters are very helpful and friendly. Overall a great experience.

Visited on 4th July '15. The coffee was served spilled. The Malaysian soup was a strange concoction of Indian and Asian spices. It had overpowering aroma of both, cardamom and cloves. Lemongrass was overpowered by cardamom and cloves. The repeat serving of fondue bread took 3 reminders. Unlikely, will visit again.

A Zomato voucher and a very welcoming like a personal invitation from official Mehek when she had called to clear a confusion had made two of us to visit this place.

Previously whenever we were around, we went to their next door giant neighour. Thought it is a Cafe type place and finger foods with adjoining Hookah section, always seen 18+ kids were waiting out side to get high with rambutan or kiwi flavoured smoke though not sure about offerings, never mind please. I only like smoke belongs to eatables.

A huge metal finished door, you have to push/pull as there were no guards then nobody at the reception. CCTVs are working hard I guess. Called servers and they were confused as one table means how many persons or which table should they provide, acting like pre programmed robots. I had talks with efficient guy Aftab before coming who came up and rescued us.

Interior doesn't matter to me that much when food is good AC is strong. Felt little bit humid inside. They should put up a temperature metre somewhere too when they had put so much effort in  decoration. Have to mention, it has so many things do not relate to each other, no particular pattern. Still good to eyes.

They make sooo good mocktails. Complementary Chocolate monk and pacific blue (hope not mistaking) too good. Will try other mocktails next time.

Starters were coming. Fish, Prawn, Chicken, Mutton, in Sino-Ludhianvi style preparation, even Pizzas, pastas and what not. Like their deco, fusion is here too. Thinking like how much calories were going down. Those were so perfect for our taste buds and an oriental type Fish and chicken and fish kebabs were so nice that I kept asking and so satisfied. For a change we realized that it doesn't always need a charcoal filled small oven, middle of your table to enjoy hot and sumptuous kebabs.¬†
We had somehow proceeded for the main course spread with almost full condition. Took some chicken biryani, a damn good mutton prep, caesar salad were so refreshing, very good raita were trying to save us which we needed so badly. Soups, dinner rolls, Indian breads and so much were there but we were clean bowled and couldn't try desserts too. Many cute pastries, tarts, gulab jamuns, many types of ice creams were there.

On a rainy Sunday afternoon, we really enjoyed a lot and I'm recommending this place.

Went here yesterday. For sundays crowd it was quite empty and after we had been served I knew why?

First the service: Very late. Had to ask for my food twice before it arrived.

Food: Average, charcoal grilled cottage cheese came in without Salt. Orange mint virgin mojito was highly minted. Stir fried chilly garlic noodles was the only thing that came in without defects.

Maybe I had a bad day but the seating arrangement is bad for all day. Very uncomfortable.

Tried the Sunday special buffet on a rainy day. And I loved the place. We had many buffet options, standing next to CCD and finally decided on Chai Break after viewing Zomato reviews.
It all started with 11 different non-veg starters of chicken fish and prawn. Thai chicken was fab. The complimentary drink of Pacific Blue and Choco-Delite were too good. Coming up next main course, started off with Chicken soup, we headed directly towards Chicken Biriyani (such a mild and tasty one), Mutton Kasha, and fish kalia. We were actually too full before we could move towards the dessert section where they served Strawberry ice cream, 3 different pastries, Gulab Jamun, and cookies.
Ended off this lovely lunch with Paan Hookah. An the surprise was yet to come. 5 no. of buffet, with one hookah cost just 2600! Yes folks, you heard it right, just 2600.
Such delicacies that too at such cheap price, is really worth mentioning.
Loved it.

On a super hot Friday this summer 2015 3 of us planned to had lunch in Chai Break. We thought of opting the buffet but somehow¬† changed our mind and went for Ala Carte and we still repent this decision.Opted for two starters ,coolers and a main course. While the coolers were superb the starters and main course was pretty¬†average. The chicken skewers was so bad that we had to return the entire dish .The bill came around 1800 which is pretty expensive for this food .Totally dissatisfied.P.S: Please go for the buffet as suggested by others its pretty good. The ambience is pretty cool though.

Had an awesome complimentary lunch today, at Chai Break, RDB Boulevard..courtesy: the Zomato lunch-buffet voucher, which I had received last month. Well, firstly, I was absolutely delighted to have received the voucher, as it came as a surprise. So, thanks to Zomato, for this awesome treat. ¬†Secondly, I was taken aback by the variety of cuisine, on offer, at an eatery which is named as 'Chai-Break' (The name, is very mis-leading). I mean, I hadn't ever been to this restaurant, and had assumed, based on its name, that it was one of those uber-chic cafes, adorning Sector V, serving over-priced coffee and sandwiches.¬†

I was proved wrong, the moment I entered the restaurant. At 12 noon, it was pretty empty, but the staff were very hospitable. The cool ambience and the colourful decor makes one feel at home. However, it was the buffet menu and the quality of the food which made me like this place, so much.¬†

The welcome drink was a yummy mock-tail called 'Chocolate monk'. The starters ranged from an assortment of chicken kebabs (about 4 to 5 varieties, with exotic names), fish, two different varieties of prawns. Just when we had finished with the starters and thought we were too full to go for the main course, the menu made us drool. We had pasta salad, chicken biryani, paneer and chicken masala. The platter also included a variety of soups and breads, and mutton roganjosh- a dish which we had to skip, simply because we were too full. :P Then came the desserts and we were not disappointed. Out of the many varieties of yummy desserts, we went for chocolate pastry, strawberry ice-cream, choco-tart and our desi gulab-jamun.¬†

Over-all, it was a pleasant experience and I would definitely visit this place with my friends, again. The only feature which they should improve on, is the music in the background, which seemed too loud, at times. However, perhaps that goes with the young and vibrant crowd which haunts this place. Oh, and did I forget to mention the separate seating area which houses the hookah parlour? Hoping to drop in again. Loved this place.

I went there on the 24rd June afternoon with my 2 colleagues for buffet lunch. One of my friends recommended me to try their buffet lunch and he mentions that CHAI BREAK provides a variety of starters with good taste. I mainly prefer the buffet lunch at barbeque nation, mainly because of their hospitality. In barbeque nation, they serve continuously more and more starter until you drop the starter flag. It is so cool procedure to happy the customers. But here we saw that they provide the starter, but with some laziness mean after completing 1st time serve of all starters, they may be slow down or we asked to repeat, then they "TRY" to provide those starters again with very small quantity. The behavior, not bad of those waters, but if they behave like "you want more?", it is a bad feeling for us, who can like to eat more delicious starters than the main course in buffet. Although we asked them to provide us those starters which is good in taste. We feel that the Chinese preparation of all starters is very tasty comparing to Indian ones. The Indian starters are more spicy and rich in taste. We tried all Indian no veg starters, but we prefer only chinese only for second and third time repeat. They also provide one piece of chicken pizza, which is so good in taste. In the main course, the soup was so good, I try only mutton preparation which is good in taste. And in the desert section tart and pastries are good. The chocolate pastry is the best one. The Gulab jamuns are not wormed, so it's hard, I leave one piece on my plate. The ice cream is ok in taste. 

Overall, I had a very good experience. Recommended for everyone. Would definitely try many more times in future.

Early Morning Dinner with hookah! Yeah you read it right. Thats what this place is getting famous for. Open till 5AM in the morning and popular with guys who are leaving late from office or just stepping out from the pub after a drink. Service was good and nothing much to talk about as far as the decor is concerned. I tried Chinese and the food was good. Although I must admit that it was the first time I saw cashew nuts in Chinese rice!! Worth a visit for a early morning dinner. P.S. If you think that you should avoid this place because of the hookah and the smoke, then you can visit this place for an early dinner. Hookah is allowed in the common area only after 11:30 PM or so. Before that there is a separate area which ensures the people eating outside have a smoke free dinner!

Went there for Sunday lunch buffet... I'd already been there a few months ago for hookah, starters, and mocktails before, all of which were great!

This time, the only two disappointments were dirty cutlery and hard chicken in the chicken biryani. Apart from that, everything was good. I already liked their decor and ambiance from my previous visit. The starters tasted great; I had so much of them that I had hardly any space left for the main course!

The desserts were nothing extraordinary; they should add some better ones to the menu!

I went to this expensive looking joint beside barbeque nation at rdb boulevard. I had ordered kesar tea & hot chocolate . kesar tea tasted awesome and is a treat for tea lovers. But the hotchoclate wasn't that much special and tasted like boost.. The hookah joint also seemed spacious and is separated. Everybody was well behaved. The interiors are innovative. Though a little on the expensive side ,overall a good place to hangout with friends.

Nice place, good funky decor. Gone for team lunch, as they were offering a Groupon deal so the price seems to be ok . apart from that there is a series of startars in buffet including fish, chicken, mutton, prawn . taste is good not overwhelming and from my experience it happens with most of the buffet servers. Main course was OK and the desert was good. People who were serving or managing seems to have less experience in this business. Overall its a sweet and salty endeavor.

Had been there yesterday after such a long wait....we had purchased the groupon deal but last time when we booked the seat....After going they tell me that Sorry u don't have a reservation.....I was like so shocked and came back that day going after a day with my teammates the next day......
Speaking about the positives....Starters are good out here right from Chicken Hariyali Kebab to Chilly chicken dry, Chicken tandoori...Mutton seekh Kebab...Salt n Pepper Chicken....Even the Chicken Tikka pizza was too good....Scores good in Starters
But then while coming to Desserts and Main course it was quite average.....If you are a Mutton crazy person - you would like the Mutton curry preparation which is quite homely.
Hospitality needs to be improved a lot...This us where Barbeque nation scores over other buffet places and same with here too...They don't have enough person to cater you when the restaurant is full and this will piss u off...
Rest all good.. ambience is fine....They play loud bolly music which adds on to the food....Overall a nice experience....

This place is far more better than the other two chai breaks. Its ahead of them in every aspect. Location is just perfect. Its located in RDB Boulevard just beside Barbeque Nation. From outside it looks like a posh bar, and yes it is. It is going to satisfy your expectations. Shishas are very good. For me its the best in kolkata (its my personal choice though). And the most amazing thing of this place is which differs it from other CBs is their foods. There a wide range of food to choose from. And the first CB to serve Non Veg. They make amazing grill foods. Its a must try. Mocktails are good. Prices are very reasonable. Ambience is very cool which matches the servings the restaurant offers. Overall if you are a smoker and also a foodie with a drinking appetite with a sweet tooth this place is a boon to you. It has it all.

We went there with my office colleagues for lunch. Ambience was average. I don‚Äôt like the sitting arrangement. We have ordered for buffet.
Starter served at table. We all like the starters. Varieties of items was there. But the complementary drinks was not matching with the starter. It‚Äôs like a milk shake. May be a coke or lime soda will be a good option.
Main course and desert was good enough at quality.
But main problem was the service. Very slow and the service boys were not able to serve all the items properly. They were serving each of the starters so slowly that we need to sit pause with empty plates waiting for the next items. Even they were serving very less amount of starters.
I have given 4 rating only for the food quality. Go there only when the crowd is low.

We generally do our office team lunches in Barbeque nation but since Chai Break has recently opened here we thought we would give it a try. We have eaten buffets in lots of places in Kolkata but have NEVER come across such HORRIBLE service. Firstly, when we reached, there were no forks, spoons, plates or glasses on the table (even though we had made our booking the previous day) and nobody was catering to us at all. We had to repeatedly ask for utensils, water and drinks. The service was really slow. Initially there were just two people serving 27 of us. 

The behaviour and attitude of most of the waiters were inappropriate and unpleasant. Some of them specifically were very rude and obnoxious. By the end of our meal the desserts were almost over. Most of us did not get half the items. When we asked one of them why the food was getting over so soon (note: our tone was decent enough especially after that awful service!), one of them said, since we were apparently taking 10-12 items of the same kind at once, the food would obviously get over! Now, what kind of a statement is THAT?? THIS WAS EXTREMELY OFFENSIVE AND DISRESPECTFUL!

To start with, we were definitely not taking so many items at once! Anyway, the dessert plates were too small to hold 12 items at a go!  Most of us were so full after starters that we could not even eat the main course. 

Secondly, this is an unlimited buffet and I think it is absolutely up to the customers to decide how much they want to eat. If the food was getting over, how are the customers to be blamed for that?? That‚Äôs what a buffet is all about, right- eat as much as you want!?! How could they possibly pass such a foul comment?!

Also, in the end, they had billed us for 28 people instead of 27 and when we corrected them, they told us things like we were lying and someone probably just ate and left unnoticed. I mean, SERIOUSLY? Where do you think we come from??! I have never seen such ill-mannered staff in any restaurant. Is this what they teach in hotel management?

Frankly, initially we pretty much liked the food considering the price, but with such DISGUSTING service and attitude of the staff, who would want to go back there? We definitely would not!! And we would suggest you don‚Äôt either! Very, very disappointing! 

You can see the behaviour yourself in the youtube video one of our friend captured.

Lunch Buffet¬† - Recommended.Starters are not as good as some of its competitors in the nearby location (sector 5). The variety is good but the taste is not at all up to the mark. Starters:Salt n Pepper chicken - very good, Tandoori chicken - bad, Chicken hariyali - average, Mahi fish tikka - good, Mutton seekh kebab - bad, Garlic¬†fish - bad, Prawn tandoori - worst of all, Shanghai prawn - good, Chef's special chicken wings - good, Pizza - did not try. But the main course made up for the loss in starters. The mutton special was superb. It tasted good and the peices were tender and juicy. Chicken biryani was okay, the rice was good unlike some of the other chicken biryanis I had in other buffet spreads.The desert was of special mention. Each and every item needs a special mention.¬†4 varieties of pastries - pineapple, strawberry, choclate and dark chocolate was superb, Gulab jamun and ice cream were great too. But the best was probably left for the last - The Chocolate tart - It was just fabulous. One of the best I every had. Mocktales - chocolate and mango smoothie were good too. Great ambience. Service was very good as well. The person attending was very humble and welcomed us everytime with a smile which really made us feel great. Overall I had a very good experience. Recommened for everyone. Would definitely try many more times in future.

Today's lunch!
After quite a long time felt excited for the lunch just outside the office after a frustrating Saturday morning work! Got positive feedbacks from people that Chai Break is doing good, only the name is putting them behind!
But i must say - it is the to go place for the foodies! They r doing really great with a large place, hookha chamber, and high chairs! And the food is just lip smacking!
Ordered - feedo-deedo drink of green apple and Pacific Blue as drinks! Both were very tasty and refreshing and not so costly!
Then had salt and pepper chicken, roasted lamb and garlic fried noodles - all were very tasty and looked good! Service was also prompt today!
Also got some eye catching clicks of the items!

Again had lunch buffet! Pretty good and recommended!

I went to this restaurant for lunch today with my office collegues...
Firstly,I was thinking that what rating should I need to give to this restaurant..3.5 or 4...Finally I ended up with 3.5.
We were 14 people and we have opted for buffet using the groupon deal( Rs 449 per person)..
We have ordered Natural blue,Virgin Mojito,Strawberry blush etc as starters..All were beautiful looking and refreshing..
They had a wide range of starters in their buffet. Most of them were great.But the problem was with the service. They were serving each of the starters so slowly that we need to sit idle with plates waiting for thr next starters to come...Even they were bringing very less amount of starters at sinhle time...But I must say that the taste of the starters were great...
Coming to the main course,the loved the mutton item...
They have chocolate tart,differrnt pastries ,fresh fruits and icecreams..All were nice...
The decor and ambience of the restro was unique and nice..
I would say that yoi can try this restaurant at least once..

Chai Break Ambience is good and I recomend it could more better......

Food is average quality and not that tasty.. had chicken biriyani, mutton roganjosh and fish kalia.

Starters served are not upto the mark.

Definitely not recomended from my side.

Having spent 3-4 hours at this place one thing I can say is that it was a great experience. I would like to highlight certain aspects of this place,
1. Ambience, this place stands out with all those happy colours on walls  and the way they have made the booths.
2. Live screening and music, live telecast of matches can be enjoyed here with your buddies.
3. Closes at 5 am, which other place will let you enjoy the night in a calm and safe way from evening till 5 am in the morning?
4. Food n Drinks, they have a variety in food. Pasta, pizza( peri peri chicken pizza is a good option) and our Indian cuisine. You will get it all. Also, they serve tea (kesar tea was refreshing) , coffee, sodas( we tried blueberry and thought it was okay) and mocktails.
5. Service, maybe bcuz it was crowded when we visited but we found their service quite slow.

COMPLIMENTARY FOOD VOUCHER FROM ZOMATO AND CHAI BREAK:-

I was soo happy to receive a complimentary food voucher from zomato.Having exams and personal preoccupation,I was able to utilise the food voucher only yesterday(6.6.2015).

I had made reservations earlier and they said the voucher was valid for 2 persons(supercool),but when I reached and informed them of the voucher,the waiter said it wont be valid.I asked him to ask the manager and only after doing so he informed that the voucher will work.

The starters are many -11 in all.There were chicken,fish,mutton and prawns(Prawns were big and more delicious than prawns of barbeque nation).I will not be able to tell you the individual names of the starters but i will be able to put them in a ranking:-
1)Prawns- (Better than Barbeque Nation)
2)Chicken(on a par with Barbeque nation)
3)Fish(Barbeque nation is better)
4)Mutton(Barbeque Nation is wayy better)
5)Pasta-good
6)Pizza-crunchy,thin crust with very minimal topping.
Now I have a complaint-The starters come as if they want to rid our table for someone else.They are that quick.Once food started piling up,I had ask them to stop unless I ordered more and then they complied.I cant stop comparing with barbeque nation coz this resto is basically built to eat in to the formers business,and they are doing a good job.This resto can have live grills to up their ante,which can be covered when people choose from a-la carte.

Now coming on to the Main course-
The chicken biriyani was really flavorful but the chicken not tender and the pieces of chicken very less .
There was a mutton item and a chicken item.Both were okayish.

Now coming on to Dessert section-
I found tarts,3 types of pastries,gulab jamun and ice cream with chocolate sauce.

Verdict-Try this out,you wont be dissapointed.
This resto isnt beating Barbeque Nation just yet but it has got tremendous potential to beat them in near future,with some improvements like live grills,a little slower starter service so that my plate doesnt become overfilled.

My partner decided to treat me here on birthday!..and her choice like always was the best..the buffet, quite reasonably priced, is enough to stuff u completely. The speciality is the starter section with delicious combinations ranging from chicken to prawns even included pizza and pasta. The choices of mocktails and drinks are good. If you still have enough space left for the main course u wont be disappointed. The food is overall very nice especially the rice items. The service was good, the ambience although a bit loud bt allows u to blend in well. However the desert section needs to amp up a bit. For a group of friends or  for couples its a place u might just want to be!!

I think till now bbq nation was the Pioneer of tandoori and kababs but it's biggest threat has arrived and it's just after him. Chai break has done some awesome job.
1. Ambience nice and cozy. Enough space , not too crowdy.
2. 10+ number of starters. Each and every single item was delicious. Quality of chiken was lovely. Specially tandoori, Tikka and prawn. Mutton Rogan Jose, choco tart was also good.
3. I think this one is best among its species as they have specially nurtured their dishes.

I am giving one big thumb up guys.
Please visit there. I'm recommending it.

A warm and welcoming place, well decorated, good music, great ambiance. The food was really tasty and well prepared. The mocktails were also quite nice. ¬†However, the staff was disappointing...they were not well-trained and they hardly attended the tables (stayed as far away as possible) and also did not respond to our calls. If you are looking for a chai/coffee/hookah break, yes this is the place (as the name suggests). But otherwise it is almost average.

Was searching for late night restuarants in salt lake and found chai break as an option. The ambience was really welcoming. I mistook the mocktail counter as bar. Was dissppointed that the place doesnot serve alcohol. I felt that cocktails, hoookah and the cool ambience would have taken the place a tad higher.
Ordered kiwi soda and the drink was quite disappointing. The strong artificial flavour made it undrinkable.  In main course ordered leek prawn and some chicken dish..Found both dishes quite average.
I think visit the place for hookah and not if you have food as priority.

The place has a capacity to hold good amount of people and the ambience is classy. The waiters are not enough trained and are little unresponsive. The small cabins are perfect for a group of 5 or 6 which is the best thing about the place. You get a privacy for yourself. Brownie shake is a must try and hookah is also better than most of the bars.

Chai Break maybe located next to Kolkata's most popular restaurant but it is far away from all aspects compared to buffet standard at Barbeque Nation. Only additional benefit here is wonderful sisha served here with excellent cocktails.
Starters are best part of the meal but main course and dessert falls flat on face. Servers are immature and need training. They don't have bar license so there is no option for alcohol.
Buffet price offer was INR 499 plus taxes. Will only recommend if you dying in hunger and next door Barbeque Nation has long queue outside.

Horrible Service & very disappointing !!!

We went there with couple of friends after watching movie around 8 pm in evening. One of my friend had to catch a flight around 11 so we ordered quickly and requested the waiter to get our order soon. 

1>  But first the attitude of the waiter was not friendly at all and not one 3-4 waiters attitude was very bad. They were not smiling at all and it felt they were not happy entertaining guests. 

2> Secondly after placing order we request for about 1.5 hrs to each and every waiter to bring the order fast but only 2 starter came and that's it. My friends from siliguri left for airport in the end without having their full meal. It was really embarrassing and didn't expected this at all. 

3> Thirdly around 3-4 families siting in different tables were complaining same about horrible service and everybody told will never come again to this place. 

It was really a bad experience for me at this outlet as I have earlier enjoyed at their other outlet. 

Food which came late was perfect and very nice but the mood was total bad. Didn't enjoyed at all. 

I would like the management to look into this matter seriously and do something. Because I don't want chai break to have a bad name. 

Please give some trading to staff also as they should welcome guests with open hand and with smiling face and nature.

Been here today, had their Lunch buffet. 4 types of starters, tandoori paneer, crispy baby corn, patato wedges, Veg seekh kebabs for the vegetarians. starters were fine. Chocolate monk in the mocktails seemed like just melted chocolate icecream. Next were pizza and pasta, pizza with olives was tasty, and pasta too was good. paneer labedar, Veg jhaal frezi , chana masala with breads tasted fine. Dal makhani was good. Chocolate brownie, pineapple pastry, chocolate tarts and strawberry ice cream in desserts tasted fine. The ambience were more of kind of hangout place. Perfect place for people who love starters. The service was slow, probably as the restaurant was full but the staff were courteous.

This Chai Break Outlet is probably the most cozy and amazing outlet I've come across in this city. It was about yesterday when we guys went there at midnight for hookah and drinks. It is opened till 5 am in the morning and if you don't wanna drink alcohol or spend much on things,this is the place for you. There's a kind of bar on the right when you enter with tall chairs where you can only drink and talk with you friends and the place is very cozy with courteous staff. A staff member named Azhar was very polite and humble. I would recommend him to people here as he caters well to peopleand makes awesome hookah. The ambience is cool as well with purple and pink lights inside and blue lights on the outside. Very spacious and the best part is that it is opened till 5 am. Do try their blueberry feedo deedo and tropical blue. It's very refreshing.

Barbeque Nation has some serious compeition knocking at its door in the buffet league, literally; given the fact that their imminent nemesis has set up shop just next door. Amazing, amazing buffet.
The only area which is a let down, is desserts, and the one thing which sets it apart, is mocktails. The red snapper is a must try ! Highly recommended.

I took the Groupon deal @300/per person for lunch buffet and it was awesome. they served 1 mock-tail of ur choice which was v good, i had orange juice mint mojito. in starter they served 3 chicken, 1 mutton, 1 prawn, 2 fish and 1 chicken pizza. All of them was worth trying. ¬†the finger-licking items were Fish Tikka and the Tandoori prawns - they were fantastic. in Main course chicken biriyani and mutton roganjosh was testy. did not like non veg salad. In dessert pineapple cake, Browne, , gulab jamin and ice cream was just ok. Choco tart is the best item in desert. staff's were well behaved, though service was little slow but we did not mind. overall very very satisfying exp.

~COMPLIMENTARY LUNCH BUFFET AT CHAI BREAK FROM ZOMATO~

Before I start the review writing I would like to thank both Zomato and Chai break for this beautiful afternoon that they gave me. :)

We reached Chai Break at around 1pm and all tables were occupied apart from a single one. We had a wonderful view from our seat. We could watch the television, crowd and bar counter.¬†

Till 1:30 we were not attended and was asked to sit with the buffet menu card. I finally had to take the charge and call them. As they started serving the 11 starters, as mentioned for buffet lunch they were at high speed and finally we had to ask them to pause. The 11 starters were: Crispy chilli babycorn (it was too good), potato wedges ( real appetizer), Paneer Tikka (well prepared), Sabzmoti Sheek kabaab (terribly bad), Chilli chicken ( mouthwatering), salt pepper fish (I personally didn't like the taste as I don't prefer much of pepper), tandoori chicken (brilliant), mutton sheek kabaab (ordinary), prawn (delicious), Chicken tikka (apt for meat lovers) and SarsonMahi Fish Tikka (very good).

They also provided us a chocolate shake thingy but we had more of ice and less of it. Nevertheless, it tasted good.

We opted for Lemon Pepper coriander chicken soup and it was pretty bland. Sweet corn chicken soup would have been a better choice I assume. So, this was followed by Ceaser Salad Chicken and this is a must try dish. Though the amount of chicken was negligible I recommend this for all continental lovers.¬†

Moving into the Main course we discovered that there were 4 dishes which includes: Chicken Fried rice, Chicken Masala, Chicken Biriyani and Mutton Roganjosh. Apart from the fried rice I tasted all and they were mediocre in taste. Though I read a lot about their Roganjosh over zomato reviews, I didn't find anything special about it. The biriyani was comparatively better. There was a raita in the food parlour and it was one of the best thingy out there. The biriyani tasted heavenly when the raita was added.

Last but not the least they had a lovely dessert parlour with less variety. Choco pastry, choco tart, ice cream with choco sauce, lemon tart and Gulam Jamun. Being a chocolate lover I liked all of them apart from lemon tart.¬†

I assumed that the voucher was valid for one person only but they charged us absolutely nothing for two.

Though the place is just beside Bar B Q Nation which is a tough competitor, you can visit the place for the wonderful ambience and non conventional lunch.¬†

Keep eating! :)

What an amazing place to sit, relax, eat like a glutton and be happy!

The beautiful ambiance automatically cheers you up right when you enter the restaurant. The colourful wheels that adored the wall added to the vibe that the constant peppy Bollywood music was ensuring!

Coming to food, the buffet spread was mind blowing. They serve 11 types of starters including crispy baby corn to salt and pepper fish to chicken tikka to mutton sheikh kebab to prawn tanduri and more. Except the salt and pepper fish which was little smelly and the veg sheikh kebab which was bland, the others were perfectly cooked to satisfy the taste buds. They ask you to select a complimentary mocktail. We had a chocolate shake which was delightfully awesome. All these fills 75% of your appetite! The main course had soups,rice,biriyani, chicken kasha, mutton Rogan josh and fish curry along with some other offerings! It was decent enough. The dessert section had 3 types of pastries which were not very good. Though the chocolate tart was tasty and the hot gulabjamuns were good! It ended with ice cream. The waiters added chocolate sauce as per our request on the vanilla and strawberry scoops.

The staffs were very polite and patient. The service was swift! Overall a very good experience :)

A TREAT FROM ZOMATO! :D

My first visit to Chai Break happened on account of a surprise buffet voucher from Zomato. (I was springing here and there out of joy when the delivery guy handed me the voucher.)

‚òÖ LOCATION : RDB Boulevard, behind Infinity Think Tank.

‚òÖ FOOD (this one is going to be a huge) :
We started off with the nonvegetarian buffet spread. 11 starters starting from baby corn and ending at the tandoori prawn, were served to us at supersonic speed. We actually had to ask him to slow down!

I loved every one of them. I would specifically mention the juicy Chicken Tandoori, the finger-licking Fish Tikka, and the Tandoori prawns - they were fantastic.
On the downside, the salt n pepper fish didn't smell very nice.

Another surprise was the complimentary mocktail, for we had the freedom to order whichever we wanted.
Both of us opted for the Chocolate Monk - a thick , sinful chocolate shake.

By now, we were already approaching cloud 9. Then came the main course - sweet corn soup followed by a huge spread of North Indian cuisine. It wasn't really out of the world, but decent enough. I loved the Mutton Roganjosh. The pieces were tender and cooked to its best.

The buffet concluded with a okayish dessert section. We LOVED the chocolate tart. However chocolate and pineapple pastries didn't seem very good until we dipped those in the icecream (It felt great that way) !

‚òÖ SERVICE :
The staff were really cooperative and extremely polite throughout our meal. The food came really quick, and we enjoyed it that way.

‚òÖ AMBIANCE : The chains hanging from the roof, the blue lights underneath them and the colorful interiors clubbed with the metal wheels on the wall make it a peppy place to have lunch. At the same time, the backrests of the seats are hard i.e. leaning on the back might be an issue for some. Also, we had Bollywood beats playing continuously, which might be a turnoff if someone wants a quiet meal (P.S. We really enjoyed the loud music) .

The experience was memorable. And the best part? The entire meal for both of us was completely covered under the voucher.
Thank you so much, Zomato and Chai Break! :)

What an awesome place to satisfy the taste-buds.
Recently visited their restaurant for a Buffet lunch and I enjoyed it.
Opening an outlet beside the great Barbeque Nation and offering buffet meals is really a courageous decision, but the owners have succeeded in their endeavor.
The greatest part about the buffet is the variety of starters served which includes Pepper Fish, Tandoori chicken and Tandoori  Fish,  Mutton Seekh Kabab and Prawn delicacies.
The tummy was 80% full after completing the starters. Main course items were average and included Chicken curry and Mutton Roganjosh with Pulao and Biriyani. Salad consisted of Caesar salad with veg & non-veg options. Live Pasta counter was there but I was told it was only for those having Vegetarian buffet. This surprised me a bit, because the purpose of having buffet was defeated.
The dessert section left me craving for more. Not that I could have ate more, but the selection and variety of desserts needs improvement.
Special mention for the Cran Cooler Mocktail. It was awesome. Cheers to the maker. Its a must try in the scorching summers.
Not much to say about the taste of the dishes, but the spread is good.
A must try outlet.

Went today with a friend for try out the lounge.. The interior decor was okish.. Nothing eye-catching. We ordered double apple and mint hookah with Redbull Base... The hookah was decent.. Flavor was fine.. 
We also ordered Stuffed Chicken Wings and Falafel with Pita bread.. 
Stuffed Chicken was oily but the Falafel to was good.. 
Overall a OK kind of experience.. Though not upto the expectations.

First of all, they should consider changing the name, in no way this restaurant is a "chai break" but a restaurant for full course meals and buffets....

It was another wednesday team lunch for us.. welcome drink was good..the starters came after some waiting..juicy and delicious chicken, nicely cooked fish and prawn, tasty veggies and mutton seekh kabab made my day....main course was also good but did not have much space left..mutton roganjosh was very good...

In desserts, choco pastry, ice cream and choco tart all were delightful. But gulab jamun was a mess and i did not enjoy it at all. The decor looks shabby and dark. Management should put some vision here too.

Planning to visit again...

The name Chai Break is misleading for a full fledged restaurant. But apart from that, no other complaints for this awesome place.

Food :
The food is above average. We tried the lunch buffet and ate to our hearts content. The starters are different from the typical ones that you would normally find in buffets (like BBQ Nation). Their starters are actually appetizers, and increase the appetite for the main course. The star of the main course has to be the pasta/risotto. Not many eateries would give you pasta/risotto/pizza in a buffet spread. The desserts consisted of pastries, tarts, gulab jamun and ice cream. They were yummy but some fresh fruits would have been a welcome inclusion. The items in the main course were tasty.

Service and Ambiance :
The staff was courteous and prompt. We did not face any issues and had a pleasant dining experience. The ambiance is young and energetic. We felt 10 years younger just by the ambiance alone. The music can be a little less loud during lunchtime.

Starter and main course is good but should improve on Desert side.
They server 4 to 5 types of veg starter which is very good.
But in desert only gulam jamun and pastry which is not good taste wise.

When we can't think of any place to hangout Chai Break always comes as a saviour. Nice place to have some good hookah n some finger food. Place is a bit overpriced, though.
Also tried buffet here once. Though there is variety but the quality is not that good.

The place has a nice vibe. Food is good(I tried veg only). But the service is shitty. Damn slow, that you had to wait for half an hour for even a starter.. Once you get it, the next one comes half an hour later.. I would suggest them to increase the no. Of employees and work on their service.

The vibe of the place is nice and cosy and it would be really nice if they improve the ambience. And a bigger TV in the dining area. Didn't try the buffet but the cheese fondue was quite impressive! The lounge area is definitely the best amongst the other chai break franchises in the city.  Recommended place for lazy weekend hangouts.

We had lunch here today and it is truly one of the best restaurant in salt lake area. Its located next to Barbeque nation but it will give a good competition to them.

They served around 10 different veg n non veg starters and each one of them was better than the previous one. Nothing was overcooked or undercooked, just perfect spices. 

Main course was damm finger licking good. I didn't heard about this restaurant earlier so was bit confused to go initially but in the end I will recommend this to everyone as must try for once.

It's a place where one should come and have a real break with your tiring life.....
Hookah was choking a bit, but the food and drinks compensates the bad side.....
Service is also good......
Would have rated 5 if the hookah could have been better, and the service could have been slightly fast.....
Overall, loved the place, loved the ambience. ....
Will surely visit again. ....

This was our first time at any chai break in the city. Had picked up the promo deal on groupon and had the lunch buffet today. Have to say really happy with the food quality. We were served our mocktails first up. The brownie shake (fantastic)  and the pacific blue (average). Ignored the soup and asked for the starters which were served on the table by the waiters.  Mighty impressed with the range on offer chiily chicken, chilly babycorn, salt pepper fish, chicken tandoori, chicken tikka, fish tikka, mutton seekh, tandoori prawn, paneer tikka. Everything was just lip smacking chicken tikka was supreme ( juicy chunks of chicken). If you are non vegetarian the variety is just brilliant however vegetarian mite feel a lil let down with only 4 options in starters (potato wedges and veg sheekh being the other too). Barely had any place for the mains but still tried the chicken masala, mutton roganjosh and paneer makhanwala along elwith chicken biryani. Again everything served really well. The buffet also had other offerings which looked tempting but we had to give it a pass. The only let down was the desserts. Pastries, tart, gulab jamun and ice cream (only strawberry available). The gulab jamun was the worst i have ever had and the tart base was too tender and was crumbling. Didnt try the pastry. The outlet really needs to work on this section. Would have easily given 5 had they even provided 2 decently tasting sweets!! 
Overall i was pretty satisfied and wouldnt mind going back again. Staff were very courteous and took good care.
P:s the bugget also have u an option of choosing a pasta but we skipped it as we wanted to keep this affair strictly indian!!

Chai Break - a popular brand now . Anyone visiting this place should and must try the pizza. Its the best thing there along with shake named Sweetheart, a combination of strawberry and chocolate. None can replicate these two items in Kolkata better than Chai Break. The ambience and decor is good. Casual with a lil elegant touch. The staff is helpful and one should try this place for sure. 
P.S - The place is pricey and that's why the rating is low.

Cool place to hang out with a bunch of friends...was here today with my cousins..the place is spacious and accommodates good seating arrangements..however,the lights could have been better..there was too much of light..perhaps,dim lights could surely make the place bang on..
Now coming to the staffs hospitality and food..
No,doubt the staffs were polite and reserved but they looked a bit nervous(reason not known)..
The most good thng about this outlet of chai break is that it serves non-veg as i always land up with people who are hardcore non-vegetarians..the hookah was just perfect with a combo of supari,kiwi and pan rasna with red bull base..the food on the table were nachos,crispy chilli babycorn,chicken tikka pizza,grilled fish with tartar sauce and fried prawns...among the drinks were guava rita and virgin mojito..both were good..
Overall a nice experience..:)

1st time visitor in Chai Break. I felt it has the best ambience among all the other outlet of its own. Food has a good choice of variety and tastes really good. As being a hookah lover I personally felt hookah to be great as compared to any regular place, but it definitely requires some attention towards its improvement... The place is  family types and is capable to fit in the list of favourites.

First and foremost the positives of this place need to be mentioned.¬†
1. Great Ambiance
2. Amazing crowd
3. Hookahs
4. Open 24 hrs
5. And last but not the least the food. I have to tell you that everything that we ordered was very good. for the starters we tried the mushroom duplex and chilli garlic potatoes. Both were scrumptious and amazing. We also had the cheese fondue which was also good. In the main course we had four cheese pizza which was average and aglio olio which was very good. We also tried the cheesy sauce pasta which was also very good. All in all the food was very good.

Now for the negatives. The service staff was not good at all. They were all asleep on their feet. We asked for the waiter to be changed at our table coz he was so lousy. The food takes time to come on the table. So if u are in a hurry then this is not the place to be. But if u are in the mood for some relaxed hanging out then u are in the right place.

We ordered Italian Delight, Risotto, Spagetti in pesto sauce everything tasted great. We also order four cheese pizza but it had a very bad smell and was not at all crisp. We did not even try it and the waiter cancelled it immediately.
All the drinks were also great. The kit kat shake was really nice.

Amongst the few great place to chill in Salt lake. will visit again for sure.

the reason for so many television is still unknown to me . the background Bollywood music didn't actually blend with the overcooked pasta which I was eating . The nice decor and friendly staff would be some of the only positive reasons adding to their goodwill . if you are a hookah person chai break should be on your list but if not just enter BBQ nation on it's right .

CHEESE FONDUE!! The best I have had till now. The mix sauce pasta was decent too. The hookah's flavour was quite smooth 5-paan. The chilli garlic noodles could have been better. Overall a good place to hangout with your friends. Great decors. Just one request  if possible. Louder music please!

Visited there last week. Just had some beverages....so can't comment on the food quality. But I found the ambiance was really great..even though the menu price seems to be a little on the higher side I would love to give it another shot just for the ambiance.

Went there last weekend with family. It's a newly opened outlet with smell of fresh paint still there. One big drawback was the presence of mosquitoes which the waiters said was due to the fresh paint ?!. 
We had Grilled Chicken and Crispy Achari Chicken. Followed it up with latte coffee. Food portions were very good and both items were nicely done. Coffee was de rigueur.

Would have given a higher rating but for the mosquito menace.

I had visited the cafe 2 days back...One of the worst hookah that i have ever had.........i had asked the staff about the flavour and then he suggested me to take Kiwi blast....the hookah was not at all good......on my request to change the hookah the staff told its not possible to change it now......and then when i again requested him then also he ignored.....the staffs are not at all good they dont listen to your problems.....only the ambience was good.......not a worth place to visit.....will never like to visit again....they even give u a feed back form, i dont know whether that reaches to the management or not as they have not yet responded to my complaints.

A spare hour before a movie, and as soon as we were thinking of what to do, this place caught our attention; had been to sector 5 after quite some time. This cafe is just opposite infinity benchmark and has very well done interiors. M and I ordered a sheesha and a coke. The sheesha was nice. Service and prices okay, too. But they dont have a sheesha menu yet. Overall a good place to spend time if you're in and around sector 5.

The food is amazing! I tried the Chilli Garlic Noodles and Chilli Potato,which were delicious! The ambience and the overall feel of the place is awesome.
It's the first chai break to be open 24hrs and the only one to have almost all the cuisines!

It was Christmas and after getting over with our lunch we still had time for our next plan which was movie  so my friends group headed straight here to kill some time.. The place had nice ambiance and service was also good. We just ordered one Hukka. The Hukka arrived in abt 15 min which was kinda slow. They made it well though as my friends pretty much enjoyed it. Price was decent like any other Hukka joint.. Overall an average place to  spend time with your friends in sector five..

Been there on NYE. The decor is nice, ambiance--young and vibrant. The food was nice, well flavoured. I liked the grilled vegetables with the risotto I ordered. The service was one thing on the poorer side, the attendants were unaware of the menu, though I understand the rush on 31st but the service could have been better. It is decent for a friends hangout. If anyone's listening from the restaurant management, then I would suggest a desserts menu, that was something that I felt was lacking.

Very very disappointed to say the least. The place is well located, beside barbeque nation and oppsite infinity benchmark ,but that's it ! The dishes we ordered were Prawn , Crispy Lamb. They couldn't water my palate but were decent in taste. But how much bucks are you willing to shed for a decent dish ? Certainly not 300! So it's overpriced as hell. They surely need to balance the difference between taste and price.
On the brighter side their interior designer did a fabulous job. So first impression was actually very good. But that didn't count for almost nothing in the end ! You go to dine out with friends to have let an excellent preparation subdue your apetite and that's what was missing . Not recommended for anybody.

Such a disappointing experience with Chai Break. The place looks fantastic. Its just opposite Infinity Benchmark. I went for lunch with my friends and there was absolutely no one. There were waiters who had no clue about the menu. We had to ask them again and again regarding a preparation, and the waiter had to run to the kitchen to ask the chef and come back with the report. Never have I heard any restaurant put every thing in add on in a pasta, and the main dish is only pasta in white sauce. Vegetables, chicken, etc etc are all add ons. Well, if I order only pasta in white sauce, they will literally give me pasta in just white sauce and dat costs 300+ with tax!!!!! vegetables/ chickens all are top ups worth 30-40. So this becomes a super expensive dish, which is not even worth it! Well, if u r making it a super expensive dine out, get the menu card laminated atleast instead of photo copies.

The place has lost its charm, the Sheesha's have turned from good to horrible, the wifi connectivity is beyond poor and the staff responsiveness is not upto the mark. I really hate to change my review of this place, but this is really not acceptable from a brand like Chaibreak. I will still say the food is good and ambience is rocking.

The Brand CHAI BREAK has made life easy and delicious for Kolkatans. After it has sprung up in Salt lake it seems like paradise. The best hangout place for friends for hookah a.k.a sheesha to a mouth smacking food. The drinks are also amazing. Everything here is lovable. 
Must try items are Saut√©ed Mushroom & Alio  olli. I have been to all the outlets in and around Kolkata. Every outlet speaks for itself from food to drinks to service. Everything her is lovable. All I can say 
" enjoy life when at CHAI BREAK "
