As it was too crowded .
Food was not good , they served us with
Almost cold food . Never ever try a crispy chilli chicken here , they make it horrible . Service is also too late . Would suggest to increase the service level and the food quality

Privy Ultra Lounge is situated in the top floor of Forum mall so it's not much of a hassle finding it. They have a cover charge of 1k for stags.üôÑüòîThe ambience was pretty nice and the cocktails, nicer. DJ was decent and the dance floor bit small. Sheesha was smooth and was quite pleasing. The Ice Tower is sure to get you a bit tipsy. Went there at Christmas and was overcharged. Didn't like that though. Anyways, it's a nice place and the ambience is surely gonna get you rollin'.

We went to this place on Durga Puja austomi. The place was not much crowded . It has seperate hookha place and smoking area . It has dance floor but don't have much space . The music was too loud .
Food was ok in taste . What made us most irritated is their extremely slow service . They took 2 hours to serve a kabab platter .

Went there with my colleagues on Panchami to celebrate the beginning of "no office for a week" üòÅ
Ambiance is okayish..a bit too loud music..
We wanted to sit inside the hookah zone in order to sit & have a chitchat with each other but that was booked for some private party.
What we ordered-
Garlic pepper chicken
Fish skewer
Fresh lime soda
Hookah
Cocktails & beer
Okayish titbits.. okayish service.
They wrongfully charged an extra 10% service tax despite including 18% gst, though they immediately corrected it on being pointed out.
So do check your bill before paying.

Happy eating üòä

Went there on Friendship Day and was lucky enough to get a table at the corner. It‚Äôs a small place and on weekends, it‚Äôs pretty crowded. Dance floor is okay and the DJ is also decent. Food quality is nice but definitely overpriced. Apart from alcohol, had the non veg platter, dimsums and cheese garlic bread. The quantity they provide in the platter is extremely less for that price.

"Privy ultra lounge" just opposite to mezunna. We decided to have some booze after shopping,so we preferred this. The basic thing i would like to tell that the interior decoration was quite classy and attractive. The front portion is for the family mainly,though we have our 'pitcher' in the family section only..üòÇüòÇ...as no one was there...except a couple...
Adjacent to it(attached)....there is a room...where loud music is being played creating a disc type of ambience with some laser lights and all....u can have hookah also along with other alcohols or beverages....

Now the major thing....food quality was quite descent.....we ordered - 1. A 1 lit pitcher 2. Chicken with red wine sauce....and 3. Mixed soup...nd it doesn't disappointed us....all this cost around 1050/- (including tax)...
The waiters are really cordial and well behaved....service is prompt.....

A must visit place....would like to visit next time....

This is located in Forum Mall. They have a separate dining section and a separate pub area. Inside Pub Area there is again a separate Hookah Section.

Not one of those big lounge but loved the ambiance of the place, perfectly lit, the ceilings are decorated with spot lights and balloons. Loved the sitting arrangement in the lounge with comfortable sofas.¬†

Along with the drinks you can enjoy different flavoured hookahs. Overall a nice experience.

Rustic yet has its charm. Dim lights , hard wood dance floor and plush seating makes it ideal for hangout with friends. 3 litre draught costs around 1k so definately high priced. The herd is thin here and so good for people who love their privacy and peace.However its good to see the place still holds its charm for thw youngsters. However despite advertising for happy hours they dont have one apparently and the big advertisements of 30percnt off on booze in also a gimmick and limited only to pint. The food quality is also nothing great to boast off but good.

If you wanna to party hard and catch up your breath by a cozy lounge then P.U.L is the place to be. Dropped in there on recommendation of 2 of my friends and the experience was quiet good. The dancing arena along with the bar is good for a small group, the DJ plays some loud peppy music which is sure to get you groove. The lounge is perfect to relax and chat, with a bright lighting and comfortable sitting arrangement. The paan flavoured hookah is something to cheer upon. Separate smoking zone is a high point for the smokers.
Overall , highly recommended.

It was my second experience and truth be told, wasn't  as great as the first one....
It's trying to be themed restaurant cum bar without the specific theme....
The razzmatazz was there but it seemed as if class lacked....
However, at ‚Çπ2778 for a nominal assortment of drinks, kebabs & pasta, the price was as good as good as any other without the quality, taste or finesse....
Wouldn't rate it that great a joint but ok for neighbours  to chill out in the evening/nights.....

Visited today with a friend of mine would like to highlight these points :
Food was good ordered chicken wings and pasta and the drinks were served properly. The staffs were courteous.
But the major drawbacks were to our surprise or I should say we were traumatized to see almost no people at the lounge on a sat evening only 4-5 people the entire time. The so called DJ was dancing on his track absolutely horrible tracks were played without even keeping the people in mind. Ambience wise a disaster been into this place couple of times but never seen like this before. Thanks to my preety friend who made it worth and happening the time we spent. Lastly while we were leaving they played closer from chain-smokers for it one brownie point I am giving.
Request to the admin to kindly intervene into the ambience factor.

I choose this place for my birthday celebration which was on 25th jan . Checking out the reviews and pics I thought to visit... bt actually got little disappointed.  I entered there..it was empty ..it just  requested for bollywood track to be played but the dj was quiet rude ...he was busy wid his spl guests ...it had to argue instead f request fr jst some bollywood track uff. The service f lounge was good no doubt in that. Others were v polite . Food was good. Ultimately some other dj joined aftr 8 pm n finally he was good. Still got little disappointed. ..

Pub culture is not that much popular in Kolkata. Though this one is nice in this sense. Food is good. Drinks are available,there are varieties. I would suggest to add guinness beer in the bar menu. Atmosphere is good,neither too much chaotic nor too silent, there is a small dance floor also.
One thing I have noticed that some starting teenagers have entered the pub and had had alcoholic drinks. The authority must take care of this. They are responsible for that.
Otherwise my experience is good. Behaviour of the staffs are nice and food quality is also good.

This is a bar with a small dance floor and it is quite crowded during the weekends. I visited once during happy hours and enjoyed the free drinks (tequila shots) which were buy one and get one. The pasta with white sauce is a must to taste with hookah on the menu. the ambiance and music is also good and a bit loud.

Atmosphere is awesome.  I have been twice here. 
Tried hoegaarden beer, budweiser, fish tandoori and orange rasna hookah. 
Try once if you haven't tried it at all. 
Music is not that loud. 
Enough spacious and comfortable accommodation. 
Staffs are friendly and well behaved.

Nice, cosy place with beautiful interiors and lighting. Perfect for enjoying a nice drink with friends. The music was potent and pleasing. They offer quite a variety of drinks and snacks. We went for Budweiser beer along with a plate of Tandoori Fish Tikka. Portions were good and service too. The hookah we tried-Orange Rasna was great. Definitely would be going back soon.

So we arrived in Privy Ultra Lounge on Navami at around 8 pm and were told that men have to shell 1000 bucks each for entry and it is totally redeemable. After entering we found the place is mostly a hookah cum bar with dj playing extremely loud music. As we were 5 people, we were given a private room with two large sofas. Inside the atmosphere was electric with dj playing the latest chartbusters and classic rocks. The non veg platter we were served was okay in taste. We ordered around 9 , large whiskies and 4 beers and 3 platters of non veg dishes and were astonished to find a bill of whopping five figure digits. Taxes were close to 3000 bucks which we do not know were correct or not.The price is exhorbitantly high. Overall experience was nice.

I visited this ¬†place on Nabami with 4 of my friends. I had heard a lot about its dance floor and music. Was mainly looking forward to it. Disappointment set in when we were told that there was a private party going on and that we wouldn't be allowed to dance. So we were asked to ¬†sit in a private room with another group. We ordered Tandoori Chicken,chilly chicken 8 beers and 2 teacher's(30ml). To start with,the prices were exorbitantly high. There was no music being played inside the room. As the private party came to an end..we stepped out of the private room and asked the DJ to play some EDMs. He did so but only for 10-15mins. On a normal day they play so loud music that people actually have to ask them to low down the volume and on Nabami they told us that loud music was prohibited there. They even told us that was not a dance floor. ¬†They asked us to wait till 6pm and that a new Dj would arrive. He didn't turn up. Even the food was not at all worth the price we paid . Definitely not worth a second visit.

The staff here are pretty good. They are very decent and will treat you nicely. The music is quiet good and loud so as to make you dance to your beats. The DJ plays quiet a variety of music from EDM, Bollywood, Rap etc. Altogether a nice package. There is a cover charge for Rs. 1000 and you wont regret paying that.
Before the music starts chairs¬† are put on the dance floor so you can sit there. The staff ask you to shift when the DJ comes to floor.

Well after a hectic saptami during Durga puja we hopped there in evening to chill out. Have some hookahs and some drinks. We were 10 of us are pointed out this place as we were in that area. They have separate areas. Front is the dining place then besides it is the sound proofed lounge area. Well the lounge is kinda small for me not much spqce but beautifully decorated with dark lights and neon tubes. Ambience is jubilant. Live DJ is the big plus. And added advantage is you can go up and suggest the dj songs. I went up and asked him to play some of my favs edm and deep house tracks which he readily accepted ! 

Drinks and food is tad bit costly but hey if you are having a good time you wont mind much. We ordered hookahs. Budweiser beer tower and kebab platters and some chinese chicken dishes to go the beer. All in all had a good time. Staff was courteous. 

Only thing i would nitpick is that sound engineering inside the room seems lil off. Some of the tracks sounded extremely loud sometimes beyond limits. So i would ask the management to do something about that or to advise the DJ likewise. 

Definite visit to chill out and have a good time !

I happened to be here on Saptami during Durga puja. All guys had to pay a cover charge of Rs1000 which was completely redeemable. The staff at the club was very courteous with all of our questions and nuances. 

I was apprehensive about the dance floor being too small, but it was sufficiently large for a medium crowd. The DJ too was cool enough to play a huge range of tracks including EDM, Bollywood, pop, etc. 

I liked their cheese balls and the tandoori dishes they had to offer. However, I am not sure how good their tequila shots were;  they seemed to have no effect whatsoever.

Rest of their dishes, drinks and Shisha was decently priced compared to other nightclubs. 
A good experience in all!

Dear Management,

I'm gonna stay in Kolkata and party till I drop but guess what I'm never coming back to you. All one wants is decent behavior. 

With staff like the ones they currently have. it is amazing they're rated more than 3. I don't know what was wrong with the guy acting so obnoxious serving me and my friends that I felt like telling him bhai tu ruk ja..I'll get my own drinks rather lol!!
Does he own the place? Did he sponsor my drinks?
None of that right. So why does he act like that?? Lol!

I think you must have heard about the number of new places popping up in town.

 Winter is coming!! 

Good luck to you guys!

This is the worst place to go. The place is so small and horrible. The service is extremely poor and waiters are rude. The hookah they serve is pathetic and the dj plays the worst of songs like wo Lamhe and pehli nazar. The music is so loud for a small place like this that it nearly gives you a heartache. The waiters are inconsiderate and don't have any courtesy to serve the customers. They have cover charges so you can't even back out from spending your money in.

All over this place is so shady that one shouldn't spend here. Plus the crowd is mainly students of class 10 - 12. The place has a very indecent environment.

The worst place to be in Kolkata.
Don't even think of trying 
There are far better lounges with better service, music and crowd than this one with similar pockets.

This place is a total rip off. My friends and I wanted to enter on a Friday, which happens to be the ‚ÄúLadies‚Äô night‚Äù and the security at the gate told us that it would cost Rs. 500 for women and Rs. 1000 for men as cover charges on entry. When we confronted him saying it was ladies‚Äô night that day, he wanted us to only pay for the guys who accompanied us. I am never going back EVER.

I went to this place on a Friday night with some friends and regretted the decision as soon as I entered the place. It's extremely small and cramped, the crowd is pretty awful and the prices are ridiculous considering how unclassy the place is. The music which is a mix of Bollywood and English Pop was the only saving grace. But we ran out of the place as soon as we had redeemed our cover charge. Give it a pass, I would say.

The food is satisfactory. Dont order veg stuffs. Its a no no. Non veg was good. Satisfactory. The price is also reasonable. 
Only thing is dat the dj is not available from 6:30-9:30. Very dissapointing. Staffs r seen taking hookah near the bar counter. A very non professionl approach.

The party zone in forum mall! That would be the perfect tagline for privy loungeüòâ.
Located on the 4 th floor of forum, elgin road this place is easy to locate. Normally crowded with youngsters, ambience and decor of restaurant is normal classy with couches, tables in hue of grey. The lounge is inside; the chairs, couches, bar stools and the bar itself is situated there keeping the dance floor in the middle. There is also another seating area for larger groups inside the lounge. Coming to service and food&beverage; service is really good with friendly servers who gives you personal attention amidst all that crowd. I really cant comment much about food because i went there just for alcohol and hookah. Rates are moderate of both hookah and alcohol. We got beer, mojito and flavored hookah. Mojito was more of lime juice, couldn't taste the mint or alcohol. Hookah was nice, chilled pipe was the only absence.
A bit of disappointment was the dirty washroom and a disturbing view of staff smoking hookah in the lounge ( it was rather funny).
Music was really loud and dj was good mixing really nice tracks, this is my kind of place. Good for going with your gang of friends.

Life came a full circle with this. So the Choreo Fresher Party was held at this place after a long round of discussion with n number of other outlets. What made us go to them is their professional attitude towards the job and the fact that it was nearer to our campus with regards to the other location that we were looking for. 

So what the deal contained? For INR 1200 per head, we got ourselves unlimited drinks and starters. For the drinks, we had a choice of 2 Indian and 1 foreign drink whereas with regards to beer, we got the draught variety. For starters, we chose the following 
1. Fish Finger
2. Chilli Chicken
3. Cheese Balls
4. Crispy Chilli Potato

The starters were not that good but since we were hungry we gobbled them up. They also gave us 2 complimentary hookah. Since we were 40 odd people, we got the dance floor for ourselves. The DJ was a little dud, but we made sure that he played music to our demands. 

We covered the dance floor for more than 3 hours straight. The service was good and prompt and they ensured that everybody was safe.

Privvy is the worst experience i have got in life ... Today 24/7/2016 was my third visit to it and would be last from mah side ... I called them one hour before my visit to ask for draught beer ..they said ki its available ... When we went they said stocks are off .   what the hell.... We seated there for 2.5 hours no other customers where there ..  How could stock would be closed ..  They did not want to serve that as bcoz its 75 per glass on its menu ..they cannot take more money from us na thats why.
Aslo they said its happy hours till 5 on phone  but during our visit they said its 30 percent ...and at 4 ;30 they said system would nt take more .... Order rite now ..again hell ...
One more thing i ordered jagermister from menu which was 400 they make it jagerbomb which was nt in menu or there i dont know and took redbull charges 195 from us ...the drink becomes 595 when i saw the menu there where @no shooter,drinks was more than 480...
Ultimately they are completely theives... Bartenders misbehaved from us ... Whom i was nt talking to.    
One more issues was there ...they made fake bill first ... And when i said discount u have promised is nt correct they immediately change the bill ...they where nt liberale to say sorry ...
Many point to remember :
1 they dont have small amount drinks thogh they are menu
2. Uncorrect information on phone 
3 misbehving staff
4 they feel like they take all money from u
5 incorrects bills primarily .
6 mislead with drinks or else they should mention before 

Please visit TGI FRIDAY BELOW IT IN FORUM ...BARTENDERS ARE AWESOME IN SERVE ...AND MENTION ALL THERE HAPPY HOURS CORRECTLY

Went to the place during happy hours. Music was decent. Ordered a paan base hookah, beer, whiskey and a couple of cocktails(sex on the beach, pi√±a colada, cosmopolitan, screw driver). Teamed with two starters, hot and spicy basil chiken and crispy garlic pepper fish. The food was nice. So were the cocktails. But the place is expensive. So there's always that.

Located on the 4th floor of the Forum Mall, Elgin the Privy Ultra is a moderately spacious lounge. Though the food is quite descent still the service is on the slower side with a delayed response. Ambience is overall pumping with loud music and variety in lights allover. The dance floor is a bit small, however the groovy music will make your feet do the rest.

Moving forward, I appreciate how spacious the place is and absolutely love the decor. The bar area is great. The service was quick having friendly bartenders. Oh and the choice of music is quirky and real loud, one is sure to have a good time here on every visit.

Located right next to Starstruck, I loved the ambience of Privy, with the changing lights, happening music and the awesome cocktails and hookah! But the music tends to get pretty loud at times and there are limited options in the food menu. We ordered an Ice tower and a non veg platter consisting of chicken tikka, chicken reshmi kebab and mutton sheekh kebab and fish tikka kebab and also two glasses of whiskey! The platter was pretty good and so was the cocktail. They also have a one-on-one offer on selected drinks which is pretty cool but still the rates are quite steep. It cost us around 1700 for 2.

Privy gives the quintessential lounge experience without any excesses. We went on a Saturday evening and tried Teen Supari mild hookah. It was proper. The free refill was a bonus. It cost us ¬†‚Äé‚Çπ 307 which is the standard rate. We also ordered Chicken Wings With Dip which was quite ordinary. ¬†

The interior design of the lounge is quite unremarkable. The seating area around the dance floor is hardly cosy. However, there is a separate section partitioned from the dance floor by a glass door which seemed apparently a little more comfortable. By six (we went there on a Saturday), the in-house DJ turned up the music featuring Bollywood hits and lounge beats. The music was a bit too loud and we could literally feel the walls reverberating. Although we were not complaining, the dance floor was hardly inviting given its limited sprawl. Be prepared to pay a total of close to 30% on taxes on your total bill. However that is the case with all lounges.

It is a good restaurant located at the Forum Mall.We went for two times.First day I and my brother had drought beer.Price was very reasonable and food was perfect.Hospitality was also good.
Next day we went again with a bunch of energy and sat at the lounge where a DJ was playing songs And some young girls were dancing on the floor. It was gang of almost ten young school pass out girls.They were shouting and doing unusual stuff around and nobody from the management stopped them. A young waiter was entertaining us but that guy doesn't have the single sense of hospitality and his behaviour was very bad.My friend later told me that the lounge is made for some category people. I was very much shocked by their behaviour. We left the place without finishing the drink. I will never visit there and I will not recommend any other to go there.

Privy Ultra Lounge, club during night and a hookah bar and pub during the day is one of the most popular scenes to hit if you are in Kolkata. Allow me to give you a detailed analysis of this place, its pros and its cons and a descriptive image that would show you around this red lounge.

Location: if you are new in Kolkata and do not know how to get to this place, call for a cab or any other means of transportation and head straight to Forum Mall in Elgin Street. And if you are not new and you know where Forum Mall is, walk straight to the fourth floor and you will find Privy right opposite to Caf√© Mezzuna.

Hookah: Privy features smooth running hookah. This is complemented with a bowl of light crackers and a free second refill.

Decor: the lounge has a reddish dim light. There is of course a bar. If you go during the day, you would find high looking tables and chairs set up in the middle, which by night is taken out to make space for the dance floor. Privy has golden, comfy couches and marbled tables. The dance floor however is not too roomy.

Management: So, here is the downside to this lounge. The staff members lack a sense of etiquette. They not just harass you if you forget to bring your ID proof but they make snappy comments. This kind of attitude honestly ruins a customer's experience to this place.

Complaint: Privy is one of the most posh lounges in town. I understand and fully respect their policy of checking ID proofs. However, making negative comments to a customer would not just leave him or her unsatisfied but would make others reluctant to go. I am speaking on behalf of my friends who also had a similar experience and upon showing her ID, she was still not allowed to enter the club and was in stead talked back upon and insulted. My earnest request to the manager would be to look into this matter.

Synopsis: Privy is a pretty neat lounge in spite of my last experience here. If you are a clubber, you would not want to miss Privy.

Management: So, here is the downside to this lounge. The staff members lack a sense of etiquette. They not just harass you if you forget to bring your ID proof but they make snappy comments. This kind of attitude honestly ruins a customer's experience to this place.

Complaint: Privy is one of the most posh lounges in town. I understand and fully respect their policy of checking ID proofs. However, making negative comments to a customer would not just leave him or her unsatisfied but would make others reluctant to go. I am speaking on behalf of my friends who also had a similar experience and upon showing her ID, she was still not allowed to enter the club and was in stead talked back upon and insulted. My earnest request to the manager would be to look into this matter.

Synopsis: Privy is a pretty neat lounge in spite of my last experience here. If you are a clubber, you would not want to miss Privy.

This place was at a top of a mall. We went here on a weekday so it was quite empty. We  tried hookah it was as usual nothing great. Booze was normal priced and tried non veg platter which was quite okay. So guys can try but nothing great.

The ladies night on Fridays is absolutely worthless, as both the booze and the crowd aren't worth spending time on. The bartenders refuse to serve vodka based shots in shot glasses, which are actually just sweetened juice in a liquor bottle. Also the dance floor is so small, you can actually feel people up against you. Not a place to visit again anytime.

Do I have any option to give marking in - They call themselves Lounge pathetic management and place I went there several times tho but now I regret spending my hard earn penny in such place. They don't even know how to talk or deal with the customers. I like going nice places with friends sipping drinks, having food that's what I call hanging out. It was a weekday and this 20 by 20 sq.ft place was totally empty and their manager asked 500 for stag entry dude you people aren't any club or legit lounge and at least see the profile and ask entry charges, we're the people who make bills by having food and buckets of drinks. It is just small boozing place and thanks to you we went to tgif had pitchers of beer and sinful food. I recommend this place only for school goers to hop on hookah and think they're in a so called club.

Just the disadvantage over here is the dancing area being too small.

Being a regular visitor to this place i can say it's nice place to hangout with your friends but only if you are planning for drinks, hookah and quick bites.  The ambience is good cosy kinds apt for couples walking in.  The service is also good.  Slightly on the expensive side though it's a good place to just sit chill and drink.

Been here few times, it's on the top floor of forum mall. The entrance is through starstruck. Umm it's basically a pub that turns into sort of a nightclub for kids or fresh 18 year olds I suppose. They do serve hookah which is ok nothing crazy special. Drinks are OK for pricing. The food is good. Not bad at all. I ordered a plate of chilly chicken. I enjoyed it very much. Decent quantity, chicken was nice and tender. They did serve with nice green pepper and onions mix. The sauce on it was also just right. The flavour wasn't the greatest but it went really well with a beer. They do take their sweet time with hookah though. You really have to wait before u get your hookah. I would suggest them to not have it so dark during the evening hours as it gets hard to see the food and other people u talking to during the chill session. Also they do have a smoking area so for smokers it's nice not to have to go outside for one. All in all a good place to kill time with a beer or hookah.

I went here with a group of 11 people and had booked the private area. The management was amiable and helpful; they also carved out a special package for us. The downside is that the dance area is pretty small and you start hitting other people. 
Coming to food, in starters we had ordered dahi kebabs which didn't turn out very well. The other starters included some chicken items, spring rolls and fries. After getting sloshed I didn't really get a chance to try the main-course but got a feedback from friends that the the dal makhni stood out. The oreo mousse was pretty good too. The overall is average.

Privy is a rocking place for clubbing especially on the weekends with a lot of young crowd comfortable sofas and enough dance space. Live dj is an addon and is really worth it. The only thing I feel negative about this place is that it is not meant to be a good place for only drinking. Bar keeper is not very energetic nor polite. It would be a better option if you got some drinks at tgif downstairs.

The setting was very impressive with loud DJ and a nice dance floor. There was little scope of service though in such a loud setting. Don't expect anyone to wait on you once in the longue, you will need to get your drinks yourself! The bartenders were good and the cocktails very strong. It was a nice experience.

Went to this place on a Saturday evening around 6 - 7pm...lounge was mostly empty...I was there till 8:30 there was a turn table but no DJ. It was one of the most boring experiences except I had a good chat with my cousin. Pretty slow place. I would not recommend this place to a friend. Also the floor space is way too small. Does not deserve a structured review. They need to rethink their strategy I believe.

I had heard really nice things about this Lounge and decided to try this on one weekday evening. Needless to say, did not notice the crowd and the dancefloor really since it was still early in the evening.

The experience was overall good. Really loved all the food dishes that we had ordered...American Crispy Corn....chilly chicken...nachos....! The drinks also were good. They didn't have a lot of beers that are mentioned on the menu.
The hookah also was good!

Overall a nice place with good ambience, music and food...hoping to visit again sometime at a better time slot to have more fun :-)

First time visit on Christmas Eve. Its not spacious at all not even well managed or organised specially the sitting arrangements. It can only have around 20 people sitting. Bar is nothing extra ordinary. And as the place was so crowded you can't expect great customer service. They didn't serve water food didn't come with tissue papers or extra plates. Our hookah got vanished when we hit the dance floor. We asked a waiter he got it back and said sorry. Dance floor was too small dj was playing boring music you can't dance on it.
Now coming to food we ordered 4 budwiser cans one blenders pride one budwiser bottle and two bottles of coronas and a hookah with paan flavour. And, we ordered one Nonveg platter of kebabs. That came with tandoori chicken chicken reshmi kebab and fish tikka kebabs. Meat was good warm juicy. On the whole they got this rating only cause of food rest everything is not worth a bill of 5600/-.

Located in Forum mall, this place should utilize this location to its advantage, but they don't. We were a group of 14 people, but were charged for 15 coz "that's the minimum we allow for a package of group buffet". ¬†Even then they didn't have many stuff from the buffet menu. We were provided a small place with bad inflexible lighting. The manager and staff were uncourteous and lack friendly nature. The ambience isn't that good too, you can find better restaurants with much better ambience. This was a sheer waste of time, money and mood.

Well not much of a satisfying experience at the recent visit to privy. The place was unexpectedly empty even at 9 o clock. The music failed to impress too and the food was just fine. The three point belongs to the hookah that was made brilliantly well. Overall make sure either you have a fleet of friends to company or you are just a loner.

Very fine interiors and sitting arrangement.Though took a little time to find it out at the top floor of Forum Mall. Best part are the foods and house condiments.
Hookah flavors are also nicely chosen.

Located on the 4th floor inside the Forum mall in the heart of Kolkata, Privy is a heaven for lovers of loud music and tiny, congested dance spots. If you are one of those who prefer having a few centimetres from the next couple dancing, avoid this place on weekends. Prices are reasonable, mixes are decent. There is a certain bling associated with this place which works for some, doesn't for others. 

There are better places in the town, lets just say that. The place wont be a disappointment, though.

Went here on a Saturday evening. Food n service was good, and the pricing not too steep. However the crowd's not that great. Good enough for a get together with friends. Saturdays are EDM nights, so that's another bummer for Bollywood dance freaks.

This a great place to chill with your friends.
The beer is cheap due to the happy hours.

I went there for one of my close frnd's birthday party.We booked the place so it was a private party fr us..ambiance ws awsum & loud music made us dance like hell. Had loads of booze..we even competed with each other on shots...:D....DJ was really good on playing back to back foottappers

I had the best company to begin with but our stay was brief and limited to drinks only.The ambience was great and the music outstanding. We visited during the happy hours and 1 pe 1 was free on some limited drinks at that time.We didn't order any food so can't comment. If you are interested in sports you can watch it on the large screen.Hookah was also available for the hookahphiliacs.Overall had a great time and some unforgettable memories attached.So would like to visit again and post some pics next time around.

This was my first visit and I must say im glad I choose this place for an "evening well spent". The ambience is just what I needed, a cozy place with good music, hookah and not to forget the liquor. Was disappointed with the service a bit as it took them more than 45mins to get our order which was tandoori non vegetarian platter, and by the time the food arrived our stomachs was full with booze hence we dint order anything else. Food was good no doubt. All in all good music, good company, good food equalled to a good evening "well spent".  Would love to visit again, hopefully next time we get served a bit quicker .

located in forum elgin just next to inox ticket counter at 3rd floor. Nice ambience with attentive guys. Dimmed light and cozy sofas will surely make you happy. Kebab platter and pitcher beer is good and pocket friendly else alcohol, hookah, and food- all are way costly. Since its a lounge, you can groove also on some lovely tracks played by the dj. Dj plays your favourite track also sometimes. On friday nights, they have Budweiser party only for ladies. Ladies night out they say where all ladies get free entry and drinks. Crowd is decent and safe. Would love to visit again. :) @arjun sinha, ayush sinha, pooja halder, mousumi roy.

If you want to o waste your money. This is the place to be.  i was on a 2 day visit to kolkata from Delhi. I didn't wanted to stay back at the hotel on Saturday.  Visited this place, paid the cover charges and entered the lounge. I had no option apart from spending some time and redeem the cover charge. Poor dj amd his selection of songs. Food quality was pathetic. Presentation was zero. Very disappointed.

Wanna waste your money? This is the ultimate place for you then.
Straight to the point, I went there with a friend and ordered a plate of pasta and some vodka, trust me the pasta was pretty bad (plus it cost us around 400 bucks). So, the food experience wasn't a good one for us. Secondly, the place is way too expensive. Thirdly, the lounge isn't spacious. Tables sticking together(well, almost!). The only good thing about the place was its ambience.
So, visit this place at your own risk. Adios!

I have mixed feelings towards Privy. The space is TOO small. It becomes over crowded because of the space. You claim it to be Ladies night and cover charges for booze,unlike other clubs. The tab system is confusing and once I had paid so much yet got one beer ! but, but that small room looks pretty. The food is really good. THE MUSIC IS BRILLIANT.

DJ was good and floor was spacious.
We had hookah along with the variety of pasta and breezers.
Food was upto mark.

The only bad thing was they were charging for Cake Cutting(around Rs 200).

Overall, a perfect place to hangout and party.

Privy Lounge is located on the 4th floor of Forum Mall and is a part of the starstruck restaurant..The lounge is spacious and comfortable,though the dance floor is very small,has separate enclosures..the DJ has some good taste for music..Coming to the food..they serve some pretty delicious starters with your drinks..the sheesha is good too..Only major flaw is the service..its pretty dissappointing..u need to call them up repeatedly to take your order..also they take ages to serve the orders..
We ordered: Hot & Basil Spicy Chicken which is quite tatsefull..a real hot flavour blended well with our cocktails..
Tandoori Kebab Platter: Nice assortment of kebabs of all varities..enough for sharing among 4 people..
Pattaya Fish: A bit of a letdown..the flavours didnt blend well..more of a confused preparation..
We had Blue Martini,LIIT,Margarita,Cointreau and B-52 to go with the food..Also ordered a Royal Pan Sheesha..Overall go for this place,it has a nice vibe..pocket pinch definitely on the higher side as expected in an up market place like this..For us the total cheque comes to 4200/- for 3 people..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 3/5
Service: 2/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5

Went to this place out of compulsion and propulsion. ? LOL. Had seen their sponsored ad on zomato promoting their happy hours and draught beer. That's why I ended up choosing the place prior to an awesome movie of dragon blade on a rainy Monday night. The food is ok. But the place could do better. From entry to the staff to the washroom. The place is lacking supervision. Tried only the Chinese here which was ok. Could be better. Not a place I would want to come back to except for the extended happy hours till midnight... Ya!!

Privy is a cozy place for a drink and Shisha. I was sceptical about visiting the place after seeing some negative food  comments. However they have exceeded my expectation. The staff suggested to try their Chinese food, which was really awesome. I had Hot and Spicy Basil chicken. And yes Dimsums too. With the excellently made cocktails, the starters were enough. I would recommend this place on weekdays. Weekend not too sure as once I had to return due to a private party booking. Good ambience...attentive service.....good chinese food.....

I have been to few pubs/ Lounge in kolkata and Privy the worst of all. We went in group of 20 for a party and we had pre-booked. The idiot manager had also took booking for another group of 50-60 and there were few more people. So they were trying to chew more than they can bite. Service was way pathetic, we had to share glasses for shots . Alcohol options as part of package are way low as compared to Soho or Plush. Starters were ok but it took forever for waiter to bring it. There was no place on dance floor at all. On the top this few girls gate crashed our party and the manager was blaming us instead of taking responsibility.

The best amenity that this lounge cum disc offers you is its location,not only is it centrally located but it also assures decent crowd.The place has a nice decor and a charming ambience which sets the mood alive.The occasion was that of a bachelor's party but I'd rather not talk about it because we are on zomato and I should probably write about food and stuff.We had a particular section to ourselves so service was not at all an issue.We had crispy chili babycorn for starters which was perfectly cooked and had adequate amount of spices added to it which took the dish to another level.White sauce pasta was yet another taste-bud-pleaser and paneer tikka was refreshing.Above everything,the music,lights and the atmosphere brings out the best in people.The prices are reasonably placed and should not be a pocket teaser for many as the items come out in fair quantity.
Conclusion- It is an enjoyable place and gave me one of the most memorable night of my life.The joint offers exquisite dishes at fair prices and decent service by the staff.
P.S.-BABYCORN AND WHITE SAUCE PASTA highly recommended.

Worst bar I have ever seen, worse than even metro or tripti. Since, I smoke, hookah culture is not my cuppa tea, so I do not know how good a hookah bar is it. We went there yesterday and ordered a 3 lt kingfisher pitcher and 2 kebab platters. The lager was light. This is the first bar I have seen in my life who serves light beer in pitchers, the kebab platter consisted of 3 pieces of chicken reshmi, 2 pieces of fish amritsari and 2 pieces of mutton seekh ( what the.....?) we understood their intention and ordered some french fries. But its not available. Who on earth can expect french fries not being available in a bar?(although its in the menu) The sugary waiter suggested us some texas chicken. When it came to our table we discovered that its just some chicken keema toppings over FRENCH FRIES. but they told that only french fries is not available!!!! Then we went for the main course and ordered some pork chops. The waiter tried to convince me in buying some bread baskets, but I said that there are supposed to be complementary bread rolls (wild try, smoke house deli does serve) with the pork chops, he agreed. But when the dish came to our table there were no bread rolls. I don't know, I have seen thousands of bars in my life. Some of them have limited capability in fooding. But they cut down their cost to compensate for that. That is why I respect metro or raults or tripti. And some of them are quite justified to ask for higher costs like irish house, smoke house deli et al.But this was totally out of my expectation. I wont recommend anyone to go there.

I dont know whenever i go out with my friends to a restro or bar, popular or not, it always is empty. :3 So we entered the lounge only to find the place all to ourselves. That actually worked for us girls who kept clicking pictures without worrying about stares of other customers. The look is very sexy. The furniture, lighting totally compliments the bar/disco look. Anyways, the place is a bit costly. Ordered few drinks and a okayish spring rolls to get a bill of Rs 1000. I dont know, i think the tax summed up to Rs 300 itself. We headed out to have lunch outside in the attached restaurant.

So, you decide to celebrate a friend's birthday at a club you've visited multiple times and turn up on a Friday night which according to club rules is  Girl's Night  Now, imagine the horror if you get stalled outside the very same club for lack of ID proof and the manager informs or rather MISINFORMS you that suddenly age proof is necessarry for entry in a place you've been to before and which is majorly frequented by high-school kids.
And on speaking up against such harrasment, how does "I'm the club owner so I get to decide who enters and I'm saying a no" sound for a justification? That, people is Privy for you and only if you like getting treated in such ways at a place, consider visiting. 
My previous experiences here were lightyears away from how I'm treated at any other standard nightclub complete with floorspace that compells you to push over one out of the barely five people who can even fit into it while dancing and an understocked bar, overpriced menu and below-par service.
Not to mention, it's just another rich-kid's club mostly crowded or actually OVERCROWDED by classist, judgemental noobs.
Looking at how rigourously they check IDs, I'd be happy to put in a good word regarding their security measures but, in fact, even that is a farce because, high-school kids who aren't obviously 18, forget 21, are allowed entry without any form of proof whatsoever while some others aren't on the basis of the manager's whim.
Honestly, this kind of behaviour from people in the hospitality business of all places is unacceptable and grave enough to sue them in an appropriate forum instead of just trashing them in Zomato and I for one will, but, this is for anyone considering to pay this place a visit.
It'll be a huge waste of time  and there is nothing this place can offer that obe wom't find of a better quality somewhere else. Be it  the food, the alchohol, the ambience, the decor, the service  or the crowd.

Privy, for starters is really small the size of two mini bedrooms combined.It is a totally screwed place for clubbing as on "girls night out" you don't get booze. You literally have to buy them.then I don't see the "girl's night out" tag.Its ******* crowded and too small for a club.Recently, the club owner or apparently the "manager" misbehaved with us and did not let us enter because we did not have our id proofs.The funny part is that its a ******* kid's club and they never checked for ids.Suddenly without informing they want one from you.The even funnier part is that underage kids of high school are entering without ids whereas first year college students are standing for the lack of "proof". When we started pointing out to them their mistakes, not being able to argue with us the club owner said " I just won't let you enter because I dont want to". My question is then why have you opened a goddamn club???? Their service, behavior everything is really pathetic.Trust me, you don't want to waste your night.this city has better nightclubs.This place is third class and totally disgusting.My advice, if you really are jobless enough to waste your night inside a stupid club the size of a stable with pathetic service then please do enter this place :) Shit has reserved for you :)

Privy is a regular haunt of mine. We often sneak in on weekends. I visited today with my significant other and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The ambiance is nice and the music is not too loud. We were ushered in to the private seating area within the lounge having reserved earlier. We made a meal of starters starting with a Crispy chilli mushroom, followed by Santung Prawns, Chicken Tikka Kebab and Mutton Galouti Kebab. All the starters were cooked to perfection, but the Galouti could have been better.¬†

All this was washed down by our choice of spiritual sustenance and they have a wide array of that. I would highly recommend this place, especially to the young crowd.

Was there on 25th dec , thats y all the items on the menu was not available. As usual, special menu was made for the day.. with higher rates, though the bill they made, had the old rates as it was their on the original menu. :)¬†
When we entered, as it was Christmas, dats y didnt got a seat, but after a while we grabbed one. ¬†And we really really enjoyed the DJ tracks.. n danced a lot.. ¬†
Tried a few snacks like crispy chilli baby corn(as read in the review section here) and dry chilli chckn... ¬†I enjoyed it, "a visit is recommended".¬†
According to the ambiance Hookah ¬†is ¬†recommend for relaxing...
The prices are reasonable compared to other lounges, n the staffs are friendly too..¬†
will soon visit again.. :)

Was there last Wednesday but not in the wee hours. I was there with a couple of friends during the afternoon time and it was quite a good experience to start with. You always have HAPPY HOUR from 12noon to 5pm there.
Located on the 4th floor of the Forum, Elgin road, just beside the INOX ticket counter. Once you enter you find a food zone where both alcohol and food are served and then you have this place inside it which is the lounge part where alcohol and snacks are served along with hookah as well. The decor is cozy with some golden sofas and a couple of high tables. they also have a dance floor which as i was not in the pick time dint see how it works as i don't think that we can call that a real dance floor. You are bound to stumble on some one else if there are 5 or more people dancing together.
Tried a few snacks there like crispy chilli baby corn and the non veg tandoori platter and they we quite good in taste as well as quantity. The staffs are very very friendly as well.
The prices are reasonable compared to other lounges. 
Photos coming soon..... :)
A must visit place.

Friends once together in school and now on facebook ! went visiting le blingy spunk lounge located in forum mall and ended up having nothing more than hookah and some average quick bites ‚Ä¶ well I I had to telegram someone it would be exactly this ! ÔÅä I had actually prepared myself for some rocking music and fingerlicking food but to my utter dismay I found myself emitting rings of smoke on a golden sofa with some dry clich√© crispy chilli baby corn and dry chili chicken et all in front of me . It was very disappointing .Quite did not like their service as well .  PRIVY was definitely a miss for me except for its bling quotient and virgin mojito .

Just located on the 4th floor of forum mall. For people who has been coming to forum are very much aware of this place. I have been visiting this place for years now. It is one of the perfect place to hangout with friends. Though it is listed as a clubspot but technically it isn't. It doesn't have the desired amount of floor space to be considered as a clubspot. Still being said that, i am quite a fan of this place, the decor is chique and the ambience is just perfect to tune up your mood for the night. It has got cabins for private parties and all. They serve hookah as well for those shisha lovers. The bar is decently stocked and it has a fair variety of malts, beers etc. Whenever i dropped by to this place i never missed out the opportunity of trying out their "crispy chilli babycorn", "golden fried prawn" etc. As far as the cocktails are concerned it is decently justifiable over here you can sip the world's favorite and classic cocktails like "cosmopolitan", "Margarita" etc with complete satisfaction. Overall one of the most satisfying and hospitable place to sip your signature drink along with your partners and friends and groove to your favorite tunes.

So Friday night in Calcutta after a very long time... We have a great time in Mezzuna with really friendly waiters/ bartenders ‚Äì and then the three of us decided to have a late night in Privy in Forum Mall. This place is a shame in the name of late night club/ pub. We were told it is a ladies‚Äô night where (as a lady) you get free shots and the man in the group needs a 1000 INR cover charge. We go in and we find somewhat of a sausage fest consisting of 17-22 year olds with a mediocre DJ playing pop songs that can only cater to Justin Biber fans. Since we did not go there for the music, we decided to have fun anyway ‚Äì and we did. For about an hour.

¬†By 9:30 the place was filled with teenagers (and we are some 25s and I personally can‚Äôt believe there are parents who allow their kids in this hell-hole) who wanted to be there for the ‚Äúbirds.‚Äù We had our beer and decided to take one of our promised ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù shots from the bar (PS: turns out they actually make you drink from the bottle of mixed vodka, just as a lady should). They said it would be any type of cocktail shot we wanted and since my friend is allergic to vodka, we had asked the bartender in advance if they would give us rum shots. Though they said Yes, turns out they had no intention of giving us that. While we were trying to figure out what the bartenders wanted (or was going to serve us), he happily dropped a burning coal from the hooka on my face. Not only did it hurt like hell, I was appalled at the lack of empathy from these people. I was only given a piece of ice once I asked for it and that was that. We decided to leave without taking advantage of the so-called ladies‚Äô night and let alone anything else, we were not even treated like humans here. I understand that there‚Äôs a dearth of places one can party in Calcutta, but this is not some place one should go to ‚Äì unless you are a 15 year old whose parent‚Äôs have obviously other concerns and of course the authorities have special concerns (read: making money). I would have gone the happy way and sued this place for leaving me in pain and with a scar. However, I am not as obviously financially secure as some of the 15 year olds here (what with having to make an honest day‚Äôs living) and B. I am not here in this city for more than a week. So, to round up, though my suggestion would be ‚Äì never go here, I wish anyone the best of luck.

They have made the place very classy. The time i have been there i saw a decent crowd. The hookah we ordered was also good. Even the food is good. I really liked the lighting and the decor of this place. The service was pretty good. So after a movie at forum inox one can surely drop in for some snacks and hookah at privy. Overall its a good place

Location: Fourth Floor, Forum Mall. 

Located right next to the box office, it's right on track to the upcoming trend of the lounge-cum-discotheque era. 
This place has an amazingly mesmerizing ambiance and the music selection that's played simply gets your feet tapping.

Having visited it for quite a number of times I can say that the Fooding quality out here is great and being to the point, 

What made our taste buds super happy? 
-Cheese Balls. 
-Crispy Chilli Babycorn. 

What made our taste buds happy? 
-Pasta Alfredo. 
-Paneer Tikka. 
-Vegetable Fried Wontons. 

What made our taste buds sad? 
-Nachos. 

What made us happy? 
-The ambiance. 
-The music selection and the smoky sheeshas. 
-Quick Service. 

What made us sad? 
-Ill-informed staff. 

Moderately priced place. 

Overall a good experience.

Walked in Privy on a sunday evening and found it quiet boring on first impression  but later i found out that the have a lounge and i was in the restaurant. The lounge has an entry through a small diner restaurant. The lounge is very well made, with great acoustics, lights and seating. The ambiance is amazing. I had a martini and a few beers with steamed Dim Sum. The food was brilliant and the service was good. This place did surprise me with what it offers. They have a small smoking area just beside the bar though it looked a bit stuffy. They serve hookahs and as we heard from the bartneder. Fridays and saturday sare rocking. So next weekend probably Privy Ultra lounge.

16.05.2014-While the nation was celebrating Narendra Modis win,we were celebrating a friends birthday at privy.We entered and the place was empty.No music nothing we requested to turn on the music, they abided by it after 30 mins!We ordered for 3 paan and kiwi mint sheesha and the shisha like always was good. 
Our food order comprised of :
->Crispy chilli babycorn- They make one of the best i ntown (after bbq )
->Crispy fried wantons- was tasty
->veg tandoori platter comprised of paneer tikkas,veg kebabs,salad and mint chutney.
->Stuffed mushrooms- one word,WOW
->Mixed sauce pasta- Was very tasty,though a little too saucy.
->Nachos- it was okay, very less cheese, but the tomato salsa was a winner. 
-> Cheese balls which was served with yogurt and parsely dip. Amazing. 
We also ordered a few  aerated drinks-spirte,pepsi,coke. 
The staff this time was a let down but the good company and good food managed to keep us in good spirits.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Privy has been my go to place for chilling for long(apart from urban desi or 9f).The new interiors make the place look much better and the new lighting just adds more glamour to privy :)) The sheesha here has been consistently good.
The staff however arent well trained.They keep missing our order and when reminded bring em late.The food here is decently priced.On my last visit in jan for a friends birthday we ordered 2 sheeshas which were very good. There was something wrong with the sprite there imagine they can mess up sprite:/ they had mixed water with it and served it!We complained and they replaced it by well pure sprite :p The crispy chilli baby corn was very nice,crisp with a C  and very flavourful.Their paneer tikka and tandoori aloo is also very good.Lastly we ordered a penne alfredo which was amazing.Im particularly partial towards pasta and my rating of 4 includes 2 just for pasta ;p 

We later washed our throats with long island iced tea(LIT). Wooww it was very good and strong,though fire n ice still tops the chart if you know what i mean :)

Had gone there for a friend's bday treat and it turned out to be highly disappointing.. The treat was during the daytime.. Save the ambience and a private party room, everything was upsetting.. Food not good.. Hookah not good.. Service not good.. Expensive for the kind of stuff we got.. Music, they kept on playing the same EDM tracks again and again.. Request for change in music was escaped by excuse of absence of the DJ.. I had expected a lot more from this lounge!

PRIVY ULTRA LOUNGE- Situated inside the forum mall, Elgin Road just near to the Ticket counter. It is a lounge cum disc. I had visited there with two of my friends on my birthday. The interiors of this lounge has been totally modified giving it an all new SEXY look. By approximately 9:30 this lounge converts into a disc cum lounge.

I had ordered teen paan hookah which had a lot of problems initially with the smoke but somehow i was satisfied when the whole hookah was changed due to the problems. I had also ordered crispy chilli baby corn which tasted moderate. The rest which i ordered was a bud, 1 blender's pride large and 3 tequilas. 

The thing which mesmerised my eyes was the wonderful happening sexy amazing outstanding and impressive ambience. When it got converted into a disc, the smoky effect along with a lighting creating a wonderful crazy combination along with the super cool music made my night. Talking about the prices,it came up to 4000 approx as far as i remember and i did not mind paying more because i was getting quality service plus the new disc is supercool. I really liked the lighting effects and the blends with smoke making it a new concept in the city of JOY.

Overall, i had a lovely experience. Very much satisfied. :)

Privy Ultra Lounge.. It is located next to the Inox Box Office in The Forum Mall in Elgin Road.. It is an amazing place to go with your friends or cousins to have a good time.. It has a great ambiance with dim lights, red curtains and comfortable seating with cuishions and all and the music they play is awesome.. They play a lot of different genres which makes it even more fun.. the sheesha here is good  but the place where they serve hookah is pretty small and elongated like a train's coach. the food is not bad.. I have just had starters whenever I went and they were good only.. The happy hours from 9:30 to 11:30 is awesome ;) Three and half stars from me :)
