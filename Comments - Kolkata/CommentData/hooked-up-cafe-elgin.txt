It's a nice place to hangout with your friends.
Hookah quality is quite good.
But it need to work on the decor..
Nice service. Foods quality average..

HOOKED UP ..HAHAH
BETTER CALL IT AS *****D UP CAFE
i order a combo of 499 which includes hookah , starter ,main course and drink & seriously the service was so bad,staffs were murmuring among themselves like no one was interested in dealing
Yaa i agree i went to the cafe on weekday but there should be some basic etiquette to be followed.

First thing i got the starter chilly baby corn and the quantity was so less that even single person can eat that out in 2 mins then in main course i order from Italian category mix sauce pasta and what i got was the sweet pasta and the amount of sugar was like 90% in that then i told them to make it bit spicy.
Before concluding i would suggest better never go to HOOKED UP cafe if possible and your pocket allows you then best place is DUGOUT whether its weekday or weekend you will get the same service with fabulous food.
√∑ REST IT'S YOUR MONEY YOU CAN GO TO HOOKAH UP ALSO.
Seriously i was not willing to pay 400 for that combo but actually what i paid was ‚Çπ614 (incl.of taxes) for a deal of 499 which is not worth for.

This place is located just near breakout which was actually the place we were heading to. We ended up getting here. Ambience wise it is a dull place with no energy and the staffs were also okay.
But the food was quite good.
We ordered a combo at 499/- which includes starter,main course, hookah and cold drink. We can choose the starter and main course and the hookah we want. It was really a good pack and a value for money! However they charged 114/- gst. I think foodwise we were quite satisfied.
Main course - pizzza was good
Starters- crispy chilly babycorn was good
Hookah was fine. A little stronger than expected.
Cold drink felt like water put into a lil amount of pepsi. -  which was really bad!
One time visit would be good. Combo packs is your saviour!

Dont want to say much regarding hooked up cafe..its quite popular among the students..but remains very crowded and noisy. 

Located near Bhawanipur Gujarati Education Society College....hooked up offers you some mouth watering dishes and lip smacking delicacies..

The food amount and quality is just great...but the hookah is bit on the pricy side...

Ambience is just okay nothing WOW...music mix n choice can be improved a bit..

Staffs are very cooperative and humble...very nice...

Give it a try once ...you wont be disappointed...

Soumen's Rating :-
Food : 5/5
Ambience : 3/5
Staff : 4/5

Eat good ....stay happy.. :)

It was a nice experience visiting there on 31st night. It was a sudden plan though. Staffs were very courteous and helpful. It was very reasonable and the food was good too. Hookah was good. The ambience and music was nice. You can even play songs of your choice out there. If you are going in a group then it will be fun.

Yes, was a little aback with the name :)

Ordered (through Zomato) Veg Fried Rice and Veg Manchurian and a portion of Alu Paratha.

Packing was good.

The Fried Rice was not the Chinese (not even Kolkata/Indian) version. But good if you eat it as a rice dish with assorted vegetables with a sprinkling of sweet corn. We liked it. A single serve is okay for two if you are a small eater.

The Veg Manchurian was a little spicy for our taste but that is no fault of the dish.

The Alu Paratha was excellent. It was more like a stuffed paratha. But there was no customary dahi with it. Instead a sachet of tomato sauce.
