i had heard about this place about a couple of years ago almost where a foodie friend recommended this for good continental restaurant and excellent pricing.... so while passing through the kasba lanes looking for a restaurant to eat, this place struck our eyes.... and we went for it.... nice, simple decor with the servers being extremely polite and nice.... on a sunday dinner time, it was almost empty.... we didnt waited much and ordered.... chilli pork as starter... then a fish oranzzy, a fish sizzler, a lamb ragu and a chicken stroganoff... coming to individual tastes.... chili pork was nice but the pork had a cornflour coating and i like the naked ones better just because the meat texture hits my taste buds better.... the fish oranzzy was quite a delight, nicely built and thick chunks of basa.... the lamb ragu tasted good but the sauce got over thickened while it should be like a thick soup consistency... the pieces of lamb too was miniscule while it should be bite sized.... the chicken stroganoff was tasty barring one turnoff,  they grated cucumbers in the gravy and it was annoying.... also the texture was different since the chicken was shredded almost like a bharta but it was a pleasant change since i felt it tasted better.... i would have loved some mushroom which was missing... but we didnt liked the fish sizzler at all.... priced at around 400, we asked for peri peri sauce and the fish tasted like a machher kalia.... seriously.... there were again big chunks of fish which was enough but the overall recipe didnt strike us atall.... they charge a 5% service charge and we obliged.... overall a satisfying outing and a recommended place but taste wise, i expected a little more since the pricing is not at all cheap but a little steep.... one thing that I missed there btw was some music....

This is a small cosy restaurant situated a few minutes from Acropolis Mall. I've been here quite a few times. 
Since the restaurant area is very small, don't be surprised if you find a queue outside on busy days and on weekends.  The decor is simple, and they have aquariums along the walls with different species of fish, including a jellyfish. 
Coming to the food, I have tried many items from here, but I prefer their continental dishes over the Chinese ones. Cream of potato and leek soup, grilled chicken breast in pepper mushroom sauce and fish oranzzy are among my favorites. Fish oranzzy is one of their signature dishes and it's a must try. 
The best thing about this place is how pocket-friendly it is. You can satisfy your tummy to the fullest without punching a hole in your pocket. 
The only things that I feel could be improved are the quantity of food, and the time they take to serve food.
Overall, great place with tasty and budget continental dishes. Recommended. üëç

A small cozy roadside eatery serving Chinese, Thai and Continental, easy to locate on the sidewalk just after/before Acropolis Mall according to one's direction.
The long wide walled aquarium catches one's attention, along with an artistically-painted coloured ceiling hung with bright ball-shaped lights. Ambiance is very calm and soothing. Servers are well-mannered and warmly-behaved with efficiency in service.
The food is presented with nicely-decked garnishings. We went for the Veg Hakka Noodles and Chilli Chicken. The noodles were good, could have been tastier, while the chicken were perfectly spiced and delicious. They also provided hot cleansing towels and complimentary prawn papad prior to the meal.
For some appreciable Oriental or Continental delicacies Silver Platter is worth a try.

Location And Ambiance : This restaurant is located near Acropolis mall in Kasba. It's located just beside the main road so very easy to find. The restaurant is in the ground floor with a moderate size dining space. The decoration is nice especially the wall aquariums impressed us. Beside having a nice well arranged dining area there is a major drawback that they don't have any washroom. 
Foods : We have one nearbuy voucher worth 499 Rs of Chinese meal. Our deal includes,
* Soup : Hot & Sour Chicken 
* Starter : Crispy Honey Chilli Chicken
* Main Course : Chicken American Choupsey
Along With Hunan Chicken
* Dessert : Fruit Fantasy
Taste wise all the items were good. The hot and sour soup was best among all. Crispy Chicken was nice too. I personally didn't like the taste of the gravy of Hunan Chicken. It's my first time of tasting Choupsey and frankly speaking it didn't suit my taste buds. But nothing complain against the restaurant because I had chosen to experience it. Fruit Fantasy was yummy. 
Service : The service was pretty good. The staff serving us was very well mannered. They also offered us complimentary prawn chips. 
Overall it was a nice experience. You can definitely give it a try once.

The dining arena is L-shaped; the seating a bit cramped. We decided to go ‚Äòcontinental‚Äô and ordered Torzon Chicken‚Ä¶shredded chicken wrapped in a round tortilla sheet, cut into four pieces, and some saut√©ed veggies. As we noticed pork in the menu-card, we also thought of trying it out. Pork Surf & Turf sounded fancy - it‚Äôs basically grilled pork chops in pepper sauce, grilled prawns, mashed potatoes and garlic bread. The prawn was tasty, but the pork not so much; the chicken dish was also average‚Ä¶I felt there is a lot of scope for improvement as far as taste is concerned.

This little gem of a restaurant catering to the continental cuisine is a gourmand's delight. 
A restaurant that can accommodate not more than 20 people at a time and has a minimalist decor ; serves food that can make you smile. 
We ordered bacon wrapped prawns & Fish Orly as entrees. We ordered their classic "Lamb ragu" and "Fish & Chips" for main course & Mixed Hakka noodles in Burnt garlic spring onion flavour and Thai veg rice and  Schezwan chicken and  corn & broccoli garlic pepper for main course. And then we finished our lunch with bourbon moose and fruit fantasy as dessert. 
Truth be told, the food and the ambiance and the management and the service made me happy.

The place looks good and can't complain about the staff behaviour as well.. food? Not bad.. but there is a big room for improvement. Dry chilli pork was good but quantity is not upto the level of expectation considering the price. One of the dishes which was supposed to be sea food gravy was utterly disgusting with all the vegetables and all the mushroom..  still the rice was good. Finally to wrap up, will not recommend simply because it is not worth the money..

Went to the restaurant with Nearbuy coupon for two sizzlers. The restaurant is decently located and very near to Acropolis mall.Ordered a chicken sizzler with PeriPeri sauce and fish sizzler with barbecue sauce.The taste of the two items were scrumptious. I would advice others to try sizzler. We were really hungry and ordered a pan fried chicken noodle. The noodles was only pan fried . They prepared a gravy sauce with chicken. Really a good innovation. Overall small restaurant with decent ambiance and cosines¬† ¬†- u can try here who are coming to Acropolis Mall and like to have a meal outside.

The food isn't upto the mark compared to the price. The staff is really bad. I still remember along with the food we ordered quick lime soda and they passed comments which I overheard. I think I can order whatever the hell I feel like from the menu and the staff is not suppose to pass any judgemental comments and serve me the thing. They took atleast 45 mins to serve and we were the only one sitting there. Overall experience ? If I was an actual food critic I would have made sure they shut down the place. Anyway it's empty all the time. And that's the only good thing about the place. XD

Sorry for rating this low... without hurting sentiments. I just tried two items from the menu and I'm not that impressed. The ambience of the place is pretty ordinary. The restaurant staff has no courtesy at all. 
They took ages to take the order pretty slow in everything they does. It took 35 minutes for the food to come to my table. They are really slow unapologetic and very strange. 
Secondly the food when it arrived looked pretty good but when I tasted it, it was horrible. It was so spicy I kept drinking water and the mocktail I ordered. They didn't even ask whether they should make it spicy or less spicy. I wonder how this place got so much ranking by now. Like I said before zomato cannot be trusted. Maybe their other dishes are better than the ones I ordered. Thai Veg Fried Rice and Chilli Pork. The Mocktail Cupid fantasy was a disaster. 
I'm not recommending this place to anyone.

Came here on ashtami with my friends for lunch . Very near to Acropolis Mall , kasba (2-3 minutes walking distance ) . A restaurant with minimal decor and sitting arrangement for 15-20 people. We tried thai fried rice , non-veg fried rice as main course and schezwan chicken and hunan chicken as side dishes. The quantity was sufficient and the service was prompt even during the Pujas. The thai rice tasted nice whereas the other dishes were satisfactory .  The price rate however seemed higher as compared to other chinese restaurants in the city.

Most disappointed is the lack of communication in the delay. I have never expected this from Silver Platter

Their lasagna is to die for and can easily be shared by two. The continental food is overall packed with flavour, though some of their rice quantity can be increased. 
Two reasons for not giving full marks:
‚Ä¢ The servers seem pretty clueless about what they're serving and what goes into what. This really needs to be worked upon. 
‚Ä¢ The drinks are a mess. Massive improvement required. They're awfully sweet and do not resemble their names and descriptions. 

Overall, a place to visit again!

As opposed to a few recent reviews my experience was nothing short of good. In fact after going through a few recent reviews, i went there with a few doubts of my own. The one flaw was that though the menu contained a list of items available and a tiny description of the dish, the person serving us had no idea about any of the dishes when we had asked him to describe them as a few terms were quite alien to us. But nonetheless, the items ordered turned out to be quite good. A must try is their potato and leek soup which is served with a triangular slice of toasted bread. It is quite creamy and very tasty. You can order the veg or the non veg variant as per your choice. We teamed it up with Crispy Chilly Squid and Pepper Garlic Fish. The Pepper Garlic Fish was the winner. The squid dish wasn't upto the mark and not crispy.
For mains we had ordered Grilled Fish and Pork Surf n Turf. The Grilled Fish we ordered was not at all a bad dish but may we suggest the management to do something about the quantity. For the price they're charging, the quantity is far too less. The dish is quite overpriced, and the plate looked kind of empty. The Pork Surf n Turf however is both a delicious and sumptuous dish being served with a nice big slice of pork fat. Both the dishes are grilled with little or no oil....for people who want to keep a check on carb intake. It tastes damn nice too. Both the conti dishes are served with mashed potatoes, toasted bread slices and saut√©ed veggies. The grilled fish we had ordered was served with creamy mushroom sauce as per our choice. Choice of other sauces are available too, do ask the person serving you for the other combos. Looking forward to our next visit.

Seeing the review thought of ordering food from this place. I ordered hot and sour soup, mixed rice and schezwan chicken. One of the worst food I ever tasted. It seems I have ordered some tasteless food. Definitely not a go to place for me. Moreover they asked for cash while delivering , though I paid through online. I would not recommend this place to my friends.

This has been on my bookmark for quite some time.
Location: near Acropolis mall, besides HDFC bank.

This is small restaurant. Ambience is pretty catchy. Specially i loved their aquarium & lights effect.

So coming to food we tried their continental part. Firsr we were served prawn papad.
Starters : we had fish orly. Totally loved it. Soft & delicious. Well balanced. Then we took lemon chicken skewers. Food decoration is nice.
Main course: we first time tried lamb. Had their lamb ragu. The dish was quite okay, but somehow felt like the amount of rice was less.
They took some time to serve which is justified. Service is nice.

The decor was simple and attractive with aquariums all around giving you the impression of a seafood restaurant. However, the inside is not spacious, rather cramped. Coming to the food, we ordered conventional Chinese dishes like Mixed Hakka Noodles, Mixed Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken for our lunch. The Noodles had good number of shrimps in it but the taste of noodles or rice was average. The worst part was the Chilli Chicken. It had thick overfried coating with less quantity of chicken. The taste was too bad and that too at a price of 250 bucks. A Rs 20 bottle of water was charged Rs 40. If I make a second visit I would like to try the Continental dishes but never Chinese again.

I am about to pen down a series of unfortunate events associated with Silver Platter. If you are wondering what could possibly go wrong with such a well reviewed restaurant of zomato, the answer is everything.From decoration to food to service, dismay unfurled from every scenario.

The idea off installing aquariums into both of the walls right above one‚Äôs shoulder is utterly claustrophobic. Some funny lights hung from an eerily painted ceiling. Furthermore, there was no washroom. We were provided with some wet tissues and some complimentary Prawn Papads while waiting. The server had no idea about any of the food items in the menu but he was well aware of the fact that many of the items were unavailable.

The Fish Orly had four uneven sliced basa fish with equally unevenly spread batter. The gravy of the Hunan Chicken was mostly consists of onions and some poor quality chicken chunks. Only the Hakka Noodle tasted fine. The bill was around seven hundred with no added GST but 5% service charge. Honestly, this place does not deserve a second visit.

This is located just few steps from the Acropolis Mall. The Decor is very pleasing and service is good enough. Everything is perfect about this place except the food. The taste of the lamb chops was disgusting. The sizzlers weren't good either. Satay was served with a sauce that had a poor taste. Miles to go in terms of food

Dropped in at this Rajdanga Restaurant,Kasba for lunch and to quench my thirst had the blue lagoon which was very refreshing.
Moving on to starters had their recommended item,the fish orly which had been prepared with the chef's secret ingredient and butter which enhanced the taste of the item. The fish was soft and succulent while the coating was crispy. 
Moving on to the main course,had the garlic hakka noodle with fish in tangy mustard sauce which was very flavoursome. 
Also,had the fish in rosemary sizzler. The fish cooked in rosemary is the best I have had so far. Their sizzler needs special mention with it's range and taste.

With food and service,this place has satisfied me a lot.I would definitely recommend everyone to visit this restaurant and have these items from the varied menu. 
Looking forward to next visits.

Location: 2mins from Acropolis mall towards Gariahat 
This restaurant was in my wish list for a long time so finally got a chance to explore here.. 
Ambiance was nice with wall aquariums which I like it a lot.. 
This small joint serve several cuisines like continental, Thai, Chinese and sizzlers. 
I tried blue lagoon mocktail which was nice. Then for starter we ordered:
*Fish Orly-which was nice and crispy served with Mayo dip.
*Crispy Conzy Lamb- deep fried shredded mutton and tossed in saucesüëåüëåüëå
In continental dish I tried Steamed Rice and Thai Chicken Curry..  The combination and the lemon leaf flavor with the Thai curry was awesome can't explain the taste üëåüëåüòçüòçüòçüòãüòã
Last one was Chicken Peri Peri Sizzler: served with butter herb rice, boiled veggies, French fries and chicken in rosemary sauce.  I had rosemary sauce for the first time and it was nice.. 
Love to visit again!

Small place, near Acropolis Mall. Looks very average from the outside. But the use of space is commendable. The walls on both sides are aquariums. And there's a jellyfish. They have these beautiful spherical ornate lights hanging from the ceiling. It's a 30-seater restaurant and there's no washroom.
Very courteous staff, I must say.

Now, the reason for those 5 stars.
Lemme get the mocktails out of the way first.
Virgin Mojito and Cupid Fantasy. I absolutely loved the latter.

For food, we ordered Crispy Konjee Lamb, Fish Orly, Chilli Garlic Noodles, Fish in Tangy Mustard Sauce and Chicken Sizzlers in Rosemary Sauce.
The Lamb was delicious, perfect texture and taste. These guys know their sauces.
The fish Orly could've done with a little more butter, I think, but it was still very good.
The fish in mustard sauce was also very good, not overly soft, so you can actually dig your fork into it without the piece falling apart.

The sizzlers. We wanted the one with Peri Peri sauce, but the owner(I think) suggested we should try Rosemary. And I'm so glad we did. This was easily the best of the lot.

I look forward to visit Silver Platter again soon. They have a long menu and I don't think these guys can ever cook a bad meal.
Highly recommended!

Finally visited this place for lunch today. Since it was in my wishlist since a long time, I was pretty excited to visit the place and I wasn't disappointed at all. The place is beautifully designed with built in aquariums with live fishes on the walls and cute lights hanging from the ceiling. 

Now coming to the food, we ordered a mocktail named the Blue Lagoon. It was cool blue in colour and was very refreshing. A perfect mocktail to beat the heat. 
For starters we ordered Fish Orly. This dish consists of batter fried fish which had a lot of butter in it. Tge fish was fresh, the batter was light and buttery and it melted in the mouth easily. One of the best starters I've had in a long time. 
For the main course we ordered Chilli Garlic Noodles and Fish in tangy mustard sauce. The noodles was flavoursome and the fish was amazing. They together formed a great combination. 
We had also ordered Chicken Rosemary Sizzler. It was amazing. The rosemary sauce, the chicken steaks and the butter and herbs rice served with this, everything was on point and the taste is still lingering in my mouth. 
The staffs were helpful and the service was top-notch. 
I am going to visit this place again and definitely try out more of their sizzlers. 
Happy Fooding ‚ô•

Silver Platter has made a special place in my heart. From service to food, everything is absolutely fantastic. Located near acropolis mall, this place is always ready to wow you with their food. To quench my thirst i had Virgin Mohito. Very refreshing and cool. For starters i had Fish Orly. Now this is quite different from the normal fish butter fry you know or had. Beautiful fish fillet dipped in a special secret batter and fried and the product is a beautiful delicate fish orly in front of you. When i say beautiful i mean its beautiful. Soft delicate fish inside and the golden fried batter outside is a heaven combination. Please try  this guys otherwise you will regret. For the main course i switched to their speciality Thai Cuisine where i had Steamed Rice and Thai Chicken Red Curry. Thai Chicken Red Curry is insanely good. Honestly I never had such a wonderful curry in my life. The aroma and mild flavour of the Lime and Lime leaf, the smooth gravy and the fusion of all the vegetables and chicken made it a heavenly dish. With the Steamed Rice it was just fantastic. I absolutely loved this dish and trust me guys whenever i visit this place i'll make sure that i have this Thai Red Chicken Curry. Totally loved it. Lastly i tried the Fish Rosemary Sizzler. Quite an amazing one i must say. The aroma from the rosemary gave a new dimension to it. The fish was prepared over rosemary sauce and it was lip-smacking. Texture of the fish is beautiful. The rice was good too. Recommendation: fish orly, red thai chicken curry. I also had a talk with the owner. He is a lovely and kind hearted person. As i mentioned before that this place will be in my heart forever. I will visit this place again and again.

The place located just a couple of steps from Acropolis mall welcomes you to taste a wide variety of cuisine with a soothing ambience with good food as the fried calamari and fish sizzlers taste great and a different taste in mocktail specially the orange temple was very refreshing... will surely visit to try the other varieties as well :)

They are a cosy place, with nice ambience. Food is really good. However service could be improved a bit. But if you're looking for good food that is moderate on your purse, this is a nice place to go to..

Located near acropolis mall,kasba... Decent place good ambience, decent service and staffs... 
Coming to the food we ordered  

1ST Grilled Chicken breast with peri peri sauce --- The chicken breast melted in mouth, tasted really good, as spicy as expected, a very good dish... 

2ND Pork chop --- This dish was very good but it should have been better, although it was a damn good one, tasted great also the steak melted in mouth...

3RD Pad Thai (Noodles+Chicken) --- this is the best dish we have here, it has everything balanced in it and tasted just amazing, from spice to sour it has everything, served hot and tasted just brilliant.. 

Overall every dish has its own charm, not single dish was average, every single dish was better than the other one... Will visit again soon...

For lunch on Saptami wanted to have something "Hatke" delivered to our office. Now the area around Ruby don't have vast range of options as far as Continental is concerned. So when I came to know about this place and went through the Zomato reviews, could not wait to try out for myself. Well, one thing's for sure, I wasn't disappointed and my colleagues who trusted me enough to pick each and every items for them as their "Saptami Experimental Spread" were all going gaga till the end of the day, they loved the food that much! Infact even I plan on treating my hubby in the recent future, to this scrumptious food. We ordered Chicken Satay as Starter which came in 4 pcs, for mains we got their house special Fish Oranzyy, which was a compact dish in itself and very well presented, since we opted for take out the presentation was not that much prominent. The taste was good with a very slight hint hint of sweetness.We had Chicken √° la Kiev, which in my opinion was the best in the lot. The sauce was awesome, mild but not at all bland, which is usually a difficult feat to achieve. We also ordered Pork Surf and Turf, with the Pork portion having the perfect ratio of fat and meat, cooked to perfection, though the jus could have been even better. For the Surf part, they had 3 prawns of not so small size, though we expected 1-2 more prawns. Lastly we had Grilled Chicken in Barbecue Sauce which was more like cooked in a Tomato Sauce base than original Barbecue Sauce.... But hands down, the best one for me was Chicken √° la Kiev, and I plan on having it the next time I get food from there, along with the Chicken Satay.

This place is overrated from each and every angle. The place was relatively empty when we went there at around 2pm. We ordered chicken lollipops in hot garlic sauce and manchow soup for starters and chicken sizzler for main course.They gave us complimentary prawn chips which were undercooked. The starters arrived after a wait of almost 15 minutes. Though we mentioned that we wanted it medium spicy and non gravy they made it both spicy and gravy. Then came the manchow soup and sizzler. I've had sizzler in many places but this was the most horrible of them. I don't know if they think that making the dish more spicy adds more taste to the dish.
To add to that the staff aren't even bothered to come and ask for the order or refill the water when required. Horrible experience.

Do you desire gourmet food but don't want your wallet to weep? Well then, look no further than Silver Platter. Located a couple of minutes walking distance away from Acropolis Mall, this little place is truly a gem. Now then, without further ado, let me tell you whether it's up to the mark or not.

1. Crispy Chilli Squid: A splendid starter. The squid was crispy and had just the right amount of spice to enhance the taste. The assortment of vegetables to accompany it was most welcome. 

2. BBQ Pork Chops: The pork was well-cooked, succulent; it melted in my mouth basically. It went very well with the garlic bread and the sauteed vegetables. An excellent dish.

3. Mandarin Mashup: Crunchy fish with bits of chicken, vegetables and rice. The fish was well-done and so was the chicken. The dish was a bit too spicy for my taste. Otherwise, was a good dish. 

4. Chicken A La Kiev: Delectable chicken stuffed with butter that just oozed out when I cut it. I really loved having it with the mashed potato the dip. Nothing original, but definitely worthwhile. 

5. Fish Oranzzy: A scrumptious dish. Marvelously cooked fish that also melted in my mouth. The accompanying bell peppers, the orange at the top for a bit of acidity, and dip made for a pleasant combination. This was a feast both for the eyes and taste buds. Hands down the best dish I had and worthy of being a speciality. 

6. Caramalised Banana with ice cream: A serviceable dessert, albeit somewhat disappointing. Just your standard banana with caramel and vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate sauce. I had to wait a good while to get this, so it wasn't really worth the wait. 

The atmosphere was calming and pleasant. The service was good. 

With a great variety of food and reasonable prices, I would definitely recommend you go pay Silver Platter a visit. It's easily one of the best places I've been to and surely will go there again.

Silver Platter, located near Acropolis Mall is all set to launch their new sizzler menu on the 15th of September. I was invited for a pre-launch trial of that menu. 
They are planning to launch two kinds of Sizzlers, each of fish, chicken and prawn, one paneer sizzler and a pork sizzler. 
The two types of fish Sizzlers are: One in Peri Peri sauce and another in Rosemary sauce.
The two kinds of Chicken Sizzlers are : One in Peri Peri sauce and another in Chili Garlic Sauce.
Prawn sizzlers include: One in Rosemary sauce and one in BBQ sauce.
Paneer sizzler is for all the vegetarian sizzler lovers cooked in a special sauce
The Pork Sizzler struck me the most. It is served in BBQ sauce and tastes delicious. 
All the meat pieces are soft and juicy and each of them are served with rice, veggies and rusk bread.

Do remember the date, 15th Sept and don't forget to try them.

Silver Platter is introducing their new silzzer menu which will be available in the restaurant from the 15th of September. I was invited to try them out last evening as a part of their pre-tasting session.

Had two varieties of each of fish, chicken and prawn sizzlers and a paneer sizzler -
‚Ä¢ Peri Peri and Rosemary Fish Sizzler
‚Ä¢ Rosemary and BBQ Prawn Sizzler
‚Ä¢ Chilli Garlic and Peri Peri Chicken Sizzler
‚Ä¢ Chilli Garlic Paneer Sizzler

My favourite ones were the Rosemary Prawn and the Chilli Garlic Chicken and Paneer Sizzler. Too good. Totally loved it!
Peri Peri ones were too spicy for me, however, it's amazing for people who love spicy. Fishes were fresh and there was no smell whatsoever.

Do drop into this place 15th onwards to get a taste of their amazing sizzlers. You will surely regret it, if you don't!

Silver Platter is launching a new sizzler menu on 15th and you will absolutely regret missing it! I was there last night to be a part of their pre-launch trial tasting event. And I was mind blown. The sizzlers that I tried and loved were : 

1. Paneer chilli garlic sizzler : Succulent pieces of soft cottage cheese in a mild chilli garlic sauce served with loads of veggies and Herb rice. The taste was too good.

2. Pork BBQ sizzler : This was my favourite. I did not love pork but I guess I'll gorge on it every next time I visit Silver Platter. The meat was soft and so we'll cooked. 

3. Chicken Peri Peri sizzler : This was spicy and perfect. I always prefer the spiciest dish on the menu so obviously this one was one of my favourites. 

4. Prawn Rosemary sizzler : 6 big prawns in a bed of Rosemary sauce. I tried this particular sauce for the first time and it was really good with a perfect balance of sweetness with a spicy twist.

5. Prawn BBQ sizzler : The BBQ sauce was same as the pork sizzler. Tasted equally good with chicken.

They have other options in their sizzler menu too. You won't like to miss it.

We ordered sweet fresh lime soda,blue lagoon,grilled fish marsala and grilled chicken breast in white sauce.
It's a small place but very good both quality and quantity wise. The drinks were very good and so were the two dishes. Only thing was that their mashed potato was very very bad,due to which I took off .5 points. Hope they have improved it now or will do so. Will definitely visit again!

To all continental food lovers this place is a must to try potato and leek soup with grilled fish orangy. Spicy squids goes perfect with their mocktails to start off a great dinner. 
Located just before acropolis ..it's a hidden gem

This place is located just beside the famous Acropolis mall. The food here is totally great. We ordered chilli pork for starters and for the mains we went with chicken burnt garlic spring onion rice(for those who prefer less spicy food) along with hunan chicken. For just two people the quantity was pretty good.

Ordered through Swiggy. One of the best meals I have had. The food was delicious, well cooked and came in sufficient quantities.
I loved their Mixed Noodles (Hakka). The Garlic Fish was mouthwatering. The Pork chops were very well cooked, tender, and delectable.
For starters, we loved the Garlic Pepper Chicken and Dry Chilli Chicken. Spicy, tangy and leaving a lingering deliciousness.
 Unfortunately I couldn't click too many pictures. I am going to come back here again.

A little diner in Kasba, Silver Platter actually served decent food. We went there for some good pork. And that we did get.
We started with some Lime soda and some Crispy Chili Squid. The squid was tasty.

For mains we had Gravy Baked Pork Chops and BBQ Pork Chops. Both these continental dishes are quite heavy. They come with quite a bit of lard. Though tasty, finishing the whole thing can be a struggle. But the place is good and worth coming back to.

The place is small but cosy and the staff were very friendly. As usual, we were served the complimentary prawn chips. We were full so ordered chicken satay as starter. I loved the peanut butter dip and had to ask for it again! The staff were so happy and brought me the second dip too, which I didn't ask for. The rather sweet dip was loved by my partner. The chicken was tender and well cooked..we wanted to try the over hyped fish orangzee. I loved eating the basa fillet mixed with the mashed potatoes, however I didn't understand what the orange was for!..üòÇüòÇ..and to top it, the prices were cheap!..around 550 bucks it was! I'll try the grilled chicken breast in BBQ sauce next..‚ò∫‚ò∫

This is a small restaurant situated in the kasba area beside the RATNADEEP ceremony hall. This place is well known for their continental and chinese food but their hospitality touched our heart. They welcomed us with wet tissue and prawn chips and also provided us a 15%discount on the total bill as it crossed the desired amount of 1500 INR and we visited during their happy hours.
Now coming to the food, we ordered crispy chilly squid and roasted chilly pork in starter. Both these dishes were good but would have been better if the pork was more juicy and tender and the size of the squids were bigger. But the main courses won our heart. We ordered mixed sanghai fried rice with garlic fish and chilly chicken. These were simply awesome. Both the quantity and quality was commendable. The taste and aroma of the side dishes made them perfect. Will visit this place again to taste their continental dishes.

Pocket friendly continental food was a myth in this city before Silver platter. Too bad they closed down or so i heard. 

The chicken steak was lovely, with a creamy mushroom sauce. Even the BBQ alternative is great. Calamari portion is disappointing but tasty. 

Just please don't eat their crabs and you'll love this restaurant forever.

It is a small, cozy restaurant near Acropolis Mall. The interior is nothing much to be talked about. Service is good and staffs are friendly. The restaurant remained pretty empty till we left.
Coming to the food we opted for:

Starters:
The Bacon wrapped prawns : (4.5/5)  the bacon was tender n tasty and the dip along with it was good.

Mains:
Grilled Chicken Breast: (5/5) the quantity was enough and the Chicken Breast tasted exceptionally good.

Chicken A La Kiev: (4.5/5) the dip was surprisingly damn tasteful and the bread was crispy with a good amount of veggies along with it

Dessert:
Fruit Fantasy : (3/5) looked impressive but the taste failed to impress me.
We also took fresh lime soda which was kinda ordinary. 
Pocket pinch was on the lower side and would surely visit to try out their newly launched Thai menu.

Have ordered food from here through Swiggy.....food is good but I feel that there is a lot of scope for improvement in relation to the quality of food.....but yes you cannot compare the food served here with the continental food served at many famous restaurants located at Park Street......a pocket friendly option for continental food lovers who are tight on their budget....

I am going to write a lot about this restaurant because I liked this place a lot. The ambience is good. But they should work on their service. They took so long to serve the food. We were a lot of people so we ordered many dishes.
1) Crispy Chilly Squid: 5/5
2) Bacon wrapped prawn: 5/5
3) Day at the beach: 1/5 . It was too sweet.
4) Manchow soup: 2/5
5) Spaghetti lamb Bolognese: 3/5
6) Bbq pork chops: 5/5
7) Pork Surf and Turf: 5/5
8) Gravy baked pork chops: 10/5. This dish just blew away my mind. THIS IS A MUST TRY.
9) Brownie with icecream: 4/5

Had been hearing about this one a lot.
If you're coming from gariahat or ruby, just get down at KFC, it's a 1 minute walk from there.

We went there around 2pm, it was empty. We settled down and asked for a sweet lime soda. They'll give you refreshing wipes after you're seated. I really liked that.
We decided to order for their house specialities. The grilled chicken breast in BBQ sauce and fish Oranzzy.

Two thinly cut chicken breasts were finely sauted in the BBQ sauce. Accompanied by mashed potatoes, salad and two toasts. The chicken was finely done. Mashed potatoes were just fine.
What one should try here is the fish Oranzzy. It's one of their fantastic innovation. Presentation wise and taste wise. 3 different colored thin slices of capsicum stuffed with mashed potatoes. It was topped with three perfectly sauted fish pieces and a slice of orange to add to the show. The plate has been decorated with a dark sauce which went well with the fish. Probably made with soya. Another sauce which was sweet and had chilli flakes in it was served. As usual two toasts were given. The fish was soft and succulent. Melted in our mouth. A highly recommended dish.

I deducted some points because they didn't accept cards that day. Thank God I've always got cash in my wallet and also the prices were quite low. They don't have a washroom, which was a big turn off again.

If you like continental food you can try out Silver Platter. The place is not very big but the decor is quite sweet and simple. Try to get your seat near the aquarium which is really pretty. The food is pretty nice. Though I expected it to be better as it has become an extremely popular spot among the youngsters. For appetisers we tried out crispy baby corn which was quite tasty and filling for two.  It comes in a pocket pinch of ‚Çπ120. Mozzarella sticks r also tasty though I didn't like the crust of the same which was quite heavy. For main course we had Grilled Chicken Breast which costs ‚Çπ300. The portion they serve is enough for two. Though the chicken and the BBQ sauce was tasty the mashed potato they serve is not really a proper mashed potato.  It's merely a boiled potato. I hope in the coming years they would surely improve the taste of their food and wish them all the best for their future.

A small place ideal for ADDA over food. Went there for dinner with Esha Bornfree Pandit Tried the Thai delicacies... Seafood laksa(mine was squid only without prawn), chicken Satay (the dips were sweet and tasted yum in combination with the chicken preparation) and Basa green curry with thai fried rice. The Thai flavours with the aroma tasted great.

Decided on this place after reading rave reviews on Zomato and we were not disappointed at all! Don't expect anything fancy in terms of decor although it's a homely ambience; as far as the food is concerned, it's phenomenal. We went in and ordered the honey crispy chicken for starters. We were served their complimentary prawn chips as well. The honey crispy chicken was fantastic. Aside from that, the grilled chicken was ordered as well as the fish oranzy. Both were fantastic. Albeit a small place, the food is top notch. The service was also excellent and the staff were extremely hospitable and cordial. 

Definitely going to visit again.

On of the worst places i have ever been to! We were really hungry and decided to try this joint! This place was a nightmare! The staffs are slower than snails the service is so slow that you cant even imagine! We ordered grilled fish, chicken lasagna and grilled prawn! The lasagna was the worst lasagna i have ever tasted! The grilled prawn was not that good and the grilled fish which was served with mashed potato was barely cooked to eat! The worst place! And to taste this filthy dishes we had to wait for 50 minutes! So this place  a big NO!!NO!!

Silver platter had been on my wishlist for a long time & having read rave reviews about this place from various people & food groups, i decided to visit this place along with my friend for our lunch.

This place is located at stone's throw from acropolis mall like about a 5mins walk beside the HDFC atm. The place though looks little but can fit about 35-40 people easily. Nicely decorated place with very tidy appearance. Upon going through the menu,we decided to have the following:-

1. Chicken satay - Starter from the thai menu. 4 chicken satays accompanied by peanut butter dip & a sweet dip. The satays were very tender & amply marinated with spices. The charring was perfectly done. Although i found the dips contradicting with the satay due to difference in taste & flavours. So one must avoid the dips to enjoy the true taste of the satay. Recommended dish!!

2. Bbq pork chops - A big chunk of pork chop was provided with sticky juicy bbq sauce along with 2 small garlic breads, salsa & sauteed vegetables. The dish itself gave a great flavour specially from the bbq sauce however the main element of the dish was a huge let down i.e. the pork. The pork was great in quality but it was undercooked due to which it was hard & chewy. Maybe just an off day in the kitchen.

3. Fish oranzzy - The dish of of the main course in my opinion. This is their house speciality & it lives up to its reputation. The presentation itself would make you go "WoW". 3 pure thick basa fillet were placed on a bed of capsicums & bellpeppers with creamy mashed potato in between topping it off piece a round slice of orange. An unique honey & tamarind sauce/dip was provided along with the dish & 2 garlic breads The fish was a perfection itself,flaky & soft. The mashed potato also deserves a special mention due to its creamy texture,just like how i prefer. Highly recommended dish!!

4. Prawn chips - This was given as a complimentary dish. 2 large prawn chips were given. They were crispy & had the taste of prawn in every bite.

The service was satisfactory with no inordinate delays for arrival of our dishes. Total cost of our meal came to Rs 920. This place didn't charge any GST but service charge of 5‚ÑÖ was levied. They provide 5‚ÑÖ discount if you avail cash payment. They accept card payments as well. Overall a must visit place if you are looking for quality continental food.

Located at a few minutes distance from Acropolis mall kasba this place is a hidden treasure. Its high reviews and ratings in zomato is not an exageration at all.It is a small cozy restaurant beautifully decorated with aquariums along the walls.I visited this place along with my friends for my birthday last sunday.What adds to the glory of this place is the exponential variety of continental, thai and chinese delicacies that it offers.However we decided to restrict ourselves to its continental dishes for this time.We ordered chicken cheese sub for starters followed by grilled chicken breast, chicken stroganoff and chicken lasagna.The quantity,taste and quality was just as good as expected.All the three main course was served with garlic bread which could have been a little better.The chicken straganoff came with platter of mushroom and chicken served with herbed rice which looked quite appealing and was even more yummy.The chicken lasagna was another cheesy and yummy dish but was too much fr us to finish.But the grilled chiken breast was the star of the menu, the chicken being soft and tender and d BBQ Sauce being the cherry on the cake. The price was average and didnt go much hard on the pocket. All together a lovely and satisfying experience.

Was drawn to this place by the high ratings and rave reviews. It is a small, cozy restaurant with aquariums set along the walls adding an interesting twist to the d√©cor. The service was courteous.¬† But the food served didn't quite live upto the high expectations.

I ordered the BBQ pork chops which came with mashed potatoes, garlic bread and some veggies. I found the sauce to be too spicy, totally overpowering the flavour of the meat. This is big no-no as far as continental food is concerned, where chefs should let the main ingredients speak for themselves. Also I have had more tender and juicier meat elsewhere. The garlic breads and other accompaniments could have been better as well. ¬† 

Overall the place leaves you with a feeling of what could have been.

It's a simple restaurant close to Acropolis Mall. Food is tasty with decent price. The best part of it is that they are charging only 5% as service tax on the total bill amount and even that could be evaded if u pay by cash. I was in Acropolis Mall yesterday and happen to visit this small dug out with a friend of mine. We ordered Pepper Garlic Fish (6 pieces) as my friend is crazy for fish and Crispy Baby Corn as a common favourite. Friends the quantity of Crispy Baby Corn is enough for two as starters.. taste was decent but want I loved was the fish... thanks to my friend. My friend ordered a Litchi Mohito and no doubt my friend liked it whole heartedly. Then we ordered for the main dish which was Burnt Garlic Spring Onion Rice (Egg Chicken) and Garlic Fish (motivated with the taste of pepper garlic fish). Service was prompt. The fish was very soft subtle and juicy. People try mostly chicken mutton in restaurants. I'll tell you to try fish here. Unable to gallop a single plate of rice by both of us not because the quantity was enough but our stomach had hardly any place to fit. But would definitely come here the fish again. Thank you Silver Platter for the tasty yet pocket friendly dinner

We were near Acropolis and were searching for restaurants which serve good food (with the pocket pinch under control). When we entered this restaurant, little did we know that we were in for a surprise. We ordered Mozzarella sticks and Prawn Cocktails as the appetisers. Looking at the ambience, we were a bit skeptical if we should ask for suggestion from the staff regarding the food. We tried that and ordered the dishes they suggested. We were still not quite sure whether the food would be good enough.
The food arrives....Mozzarella sticks were good ....aaaand the prawn cocktail was heavenly. The main course (suggested by the staff) was even better. Trust me, even if I had to pay 20% more, I would still go to this place, just for the food. This place is solely for foodies. If you are expecting a totally out of the world ambience, you might be discontented. But the food is simply brilliant. Please note that we tried their continental dishes only.

This place serves¬†food...and food alone for the foodies.

We visited here to hang around over good food after our exams got over! A small but neat and tidy restaurant is what defines this place.
Coming over to food.. there is not much options for vegetarians but one can surely visit for some casual starters or chinese/continental food.
We ordered Mozzarella Cheese Sticks and Mushroom Salt & Pepper.

Cheese Sticks were really delicious and were served with some fresh and tangy salsa.
Mushroom Salt & Pepper was more of a Chilli Mushroom, but tasted good too.

We did not try out anything further because of little vegetarian options to choose from. The staff is courteous but know less about the food they are serving.
All in all, a fair dining experience but food served is delicious!

A beautifully decorated eating joint just a few steps from Acropolis Mall. It is a very small place for maybe a sitting capacity of about 30. The walls are done by placing big aquariums and it is such treat watching the fishes swim as you have your meal. We ordered a couple of foods and I liked most of them.

1. Chicken Satay - Very nicely made with right amount of spices and dips. I liked the peanut butter dip a lot.

2. Chicken Straganoff - Another good dish which was really tasty. But it was very cheesy so health freaks need to watch out before ordering

3. Grilled Fish - The grilling was just perfect. The fish was soft and juicy. The mashed potato and the veggies also complemented the dish.

4. Grilled Chicken Breast with BBQ sauce - This was the highlight of the evening for me. It tasted so good. The chicken was cooked to perfection. The the BBQ sauce used was tasty. I loved the tangy flavour.

5. Fresh lime soda (sweet) - Nothing special but was good.

6. Cindrella- I did not liked the taste. It was too sour for me. The juices used was not just complementary with sach other.

7. Shirley temple - Three types of fruit juices were used which tasted quite good.

8. Bartender special mocktail - Lime juice and mango juice were used. This was the worst of all the mocktails we had. The lime juice tasted bitter and did not go well with the mango juice at all.

Overall quite a good experience. Will definitely visit to try out their other dishes.

Very delicious & affordable food. Me & my friend had gone there. We had ordered the pepper chicken, chicken torzone & mandarin mashup. All were delicious, especially the last one. It was overwhelmingly tasty. The torzone was also good, but they drizzle soy sauce over them before serving, which kind of ruined the taste a lil. But otherwise, it was a lovely experience

We did not try out anything further because of little vegetarian options to choose from. The staff is courteous but know less about the food they are serving.
All in all, a fair dining experience but food served is delicious!

A beautifully decorated eating joint just a few steps from Acropolis Mall. It is a very small place for maybe a sitting capacity of about 30. The walls are done by placing big aquariums and it is such treat watching the fishes swim as you have your meal. We ordered a couple of foods and I liked most of them.

1. Chicken Satay - Very nicely made with right amount of spices and dips. I liked the peanut butter dip a lot.

2. Chicken Straganoff - Another good dish which was really tasty. But it was very cheesy so health freaks need to watch out before ordering

3. Grilled Fish - The grilling was just perfect. The fish was soft and juicy. The mashed potato and the veggies also complemented the dish.

4. Grilled Chicken Breast with BBQ sauce - This was the highlight of the evening for me. It tasted so good. The chicken was cooked to perfection. The the BBQ sauce used was tasty. I loved the tangy flavour.

5. Fresh lime soda (sweet) - Nothing special but was good.

6. Cindrella- I did not liked the taste. It was too sour for me. The juices used was not just complementary with sach other.

7. Shirley temple - Three types of fruit juices were used which tasted quite good.

8. Bartender special mocktail - Lime juice and mango juice were used. This was the worst of all the mocktails we had. The lime juice tasted bitter and did not go well with the mango juice at all.

Overall quite a good experience. Will definitely visit to try out their other dishes.

Very delicious & affordable food. Me & my friend had gone there. We had ordered the pepper chicken, chicken torzone & mandarin mashup. All were delicious, especially the last one. It was overwhelmingly tasty. The torzone was also good, but they drizzle soy sauce over them before serving, which kind of ruined the taste a lil. But otherwise, it was a lovely experience

Horrible food. Chicken Hot & Sour Soup was too sweet to have. Couldn't have half of it also. And Chilli Pork was just tasteless. Never going to order again. Wonder how it's rating is 4.4 on Zomato.

Located near Acropolis Mall,
Silver platter is a nice place not that big but comfortable enough.
The staff were courteous and well behaved.
The food served was good.
We had ordered chilli fried squid which was good to taste. The chicken hakka noodle was just fine. But they could have done a better job with the garlic chicken. It turned out to be okay. The size of the chickens were also small.
But i did like the chicken stroganoff. 
They had even given us prawn papad as a complimentary dish. :D
Overall it was a nice experience visiting this place.

It's a small cozy place... happened to visit this place today..

Location :- 3mins walk from acropolis mall towards ballygnje.. The place being situated just beside hdfc bank and on the main road.. so easy to locate..

Ambience :- A small cozy place.. With aquariums on the walls.. dimly lit.. overall the ambience was quite good.. It is a relatively small food joint with 30 to 35 people max can be accommodated...

Service:- Staffs were good.. foods were served after 15mins..so got a good time to chit chat with my gf.. overall the staffs were polite and courteous..

Food :- Had some food in kfc just half an hour before so was literally quite full...

1) Tom yum soup :- a single portion was divided into two portions.. and the quantity for each portion was still great.. The aroma of the dish was superb... With good amount of chicken.. A must have if you prefer Thai foods..

2) Chicken schezwan noodles :- The quantity and quality was great... It was sufficient for 2..

3) chilli chicken.. :- 8 pieces of chicken.. The gravy was super spicy.. literally we both were into tears..üòÖ but the taste was perfect.. chicken pieces were soft and juicy... but I felt the gravy was excessive spicy... The spiciest ever I have had.. could have been less spicier..

Overall a great place.. must try..

I just had one of my life's worst dinner. I had ordered home delivery. Not only they delivered in 2hours which is 40 mins late. Moreover everything is cold and tasteless. The prawns are not good, stinking. You will need a magnify glass to detect chicken in pad Thai.

Mixed emotions on my part..
Yes.. Silver Platter serves amazing food.
I have tried and tasted and recommend it to many.
Their Soya honey chicken wings can easily win over many posh restaurants in town.

But ...
Today, I ordered Laksa via Zomato and the soup delivered to me was not Laksa. It was tasty, fragrant, soothing coconut milk based soup with fresh veggies and chicken chunks but without noodles.
Laska without noodles is not Laksa anymore. It seemed more like a thin Thai red curry.
I guess it was an honest mistake on their part and would still like to visit the restaurant in future.

Silver Platter holds a lot of significances in my life - no wonder I chose to keep it as my 125th review! And this place somehow reminds me of the David and Goliath story. A small little restaurant, rising it's way to glory with the amazing dishes on the table. And with the newly introduced Thai menu, am sure the success graph will soon be exponential ! And why not?

So let me start with my Continental experience:
Recommendations: 
1. Mozzarella Cheese Sticks : Ooey gooey cheeseee!
2. Fish Oranzzy : Lovely presentation, beautiful taste (I personally don't like the mash potato much, though)
3. Pork Chops in Barbeque Sauce : Least fat, maximum lean meat cooked in Barbeque Sauce does justice to this dish unlike most places. And if you're in the experimental food, try out the other sauces!
4. Lamb Ragu : One of the favourites here.

Starting off with the new Thai dishes that I tasted:

1. Laksa and Tom Yum soup: I have always loved Thai Soups, not only for their taste, but also the beautiful aroma that instantly uplifts your mood. 

Laksa is primarily a spicy noodle soup, while the Tom Yum is typically a little sour. While the former has some veggies, the latter is a seafood lover's paradise! 

2. Chicken and Prawn Satay : This is a characteristic dish. You would think that this is for those who can't do without peanut butter, but to make sure pele like me who aren't so fond of it don't miss out on this dish, Silver Platter has introduced a special honey ginger dip ( which in my opinion is superior ). 

3. Thai Curries - Yellow and Green with Lemongrass Rice and Thai Fried Rice respectively (The rice needs to be ordered separately) : I LOVED, LOVED the Yellow Curry with the plain white rice. THIS IS TOTALLY RECOMMENDED. The Green Curry could have been a little better, and the Thai Fried Rice is quite spicy - So the combination of two spicy things didn't go well with me. However, the generous amount of fish made me overlook this little flaw.

4. Pad Thai : How can any Thai cuisine be complete without this? And Silver Platter masters this like no other. The flat noodles sprinkled with bits of peanuts makes sure that all the flavours are intact and the shitake mushrooms just add to the goodness.

And finally we concluded our meal with Rum Mousse, topped with Bourbon. Although mine was a little hard (presumably due to refrigeration), a friend of mine got a lovely chocolaty one and I couldn't stop getting a spoonful. Though why they would add an olive even for garnishing escapes my understanding!

Overall, Silver Platter is definitely a place to look out for, be it Continental or Thai cuisine. They need to work a bit more on their desserts, but the rest of the meal surely deserves the 5 rating!

Location : Just beside Rajdanga HDFC bank( just a few metres away from Acropolis Mall).

I'm a fan of the food they serve. Their continental is brilliant. Their chinese is amazing as well. Now, they have launched Thai and it's one of the best you'll get in this city.

Thai green curry, yellow curry, pad thai, Satay everything is Delicious and flavour bang on. Kudos to them for using the fresh aromatic ingredients like galangal, Kaffir lime leaves, lemongrass, etc.

The next time you visit Silver Platter, make sure you order these thai dishes apart from the must have pork chops!

Silver Platter is located on the side of Acropolis Mall.Hardly a 2 mins walk.This place has been serving superb continental dishes.Fortuantely we were invited over for their soon to be launched Thai spread .
Vigin Mojito and Litchi Mojitos were served as refreshments.
For soup we were served Tom Yum Soup and Laksa Soup (A Thai speciality) which had squid,crab and prawns.
For Satays we had Chicken and Prawn Satays with two awesome dips.A peanut butter dip and a secret dip which we liked more.
For main course we had Lemon & Thai Seafood and Chicken rice along with Thai Specialities Green and Red curries.
As deserts,we were served Chocolate Rum Mousse with bourbon biscuits.

I tried this place so many times... Love their Continental and Chinese cuisine very much... And being a regular customer they asked me to try their newly lunched Thai cuisine... 
The menu consisting of...

‚òÖ Laska Soup~ Just mind blowing...

‚òÖTom yum Soup~ Contains mouthful of Squids n prawns... With perfect tangy n hot combination in it...

‚òÖ Chicken satey~ A must try over here... Mind blowing...

‚òÖ Prawn red curry~ Another delicacy... Gone extremely well with streamed lemon rice (need to order separately)... 

‚òÖ Fish green curry~ It was very spicy... Not liked it that much.. Because green curry used to be less spicier n more tangier in flavours...

‚òÖ Thai fried rice~ Excellent excellent excellent... If you like spiciness in your food... It will be your love...

‚òÖ Pad Thai~ Awesome... One of the best pad thai I ever had...

All these are accomplished with "virgin mojito" n "litchi mojito"... Of which the second one was mind blowing n very refreshing...
In the dessert we tried their "Rum Mousse" which was also very yummy... 

Overall, the experience with the food was excellent... But what disappointed us is the service... It was very slow... Also the staffs needed more training... The manager itself was not that sound to handle his staffs... Still rating it high only because of the food... And hope they will improve the service a ASAP... 

I will still recommend the place for trying their Thai dishes... Because of it's awesomeness n pocket friendliness...

Looking for a lit night?
Then bookmark this place right now.
There are some restaurants with huge space and amazing ambience with decent food and high price but Silver Platter is just opposite.
We find here amazing food with small space, decent ambience at a very reasonable price.
Not to forget the host though. He was extremely kind to us and took great initiative to introduce the dishes while mentioning short tales behind the cuisine as well üëç
*SURPRISE PACKAGE* has to be their new Thai menu.
Oops. Sorry for being the spoiler üòã

I'm overwhelmed to have received the invitation for trying out their Thai menu last night, which would soon be available from June 15.

The very essence lies in the endearing smell of all their dishes. Still hooked to it!
Food tasted -
Laksa soup
Chillers included Virgin mojito & Litchi mojito.
Chicken and prawn satey.
Lemon rice
Thai rice.
Pad thai.
Green curry and red curry.
Rum mousse.

Chillers-
Mojitos were very refreshing!
Virgin was better though.

Dips -
One thing I noticed and appreciated with all ourüîΩ Appetizers was that the accompanying dip/sauce lifted the dish even further. Dips were not the typical mayo ones.
It included peanut butter sauce and a unique blend of honey garlic sauce.

Starter-
üîΩSatey(both prawn and chicken) were too good. You'll definitely ask for more!
The presence of squids and mushrooms made it delicious.

Main course-
My favourite combo was üîΩGreen curry and Thai rice. Smell was amazing and it tasted better!
üîΩPan thai was different and filling. Perfect to have it with lemon rice.
It would be unfair to refer any one dish to be perfect, actually!

Dessert-
Finale came out in the form of üîΩrum mousse teamed up with Bourbon.

Highly recommended üëåüëå

While going towards acropolis mall , from bijon shetu, on your left is located this gem of a place .
I appreciate good and flavorful food, and this place in no way is any exception.
A cozy, homely interior, with aquariums on either sides, has a bar counter and accommodates for 6 people max at a table.
I had visited for the THAI MENU that they have newly introduced. And each of the food were exceptional.
For drinks, we had virgin mojito and Litchi mojito. The latter was an absolute winner.
For appetizers, chicken satay and prawn satay, with peanut butter sauce and honey garlic dip. Loved their twist they added.
Alongside we settled for LAKSA -Recommended(authentic coconut based flat noodle soup) and Tom yum soup (incl. Prawns crab and squid) .
For main course we settled for Red curry (prawn) , steamed lemon rice, Green curry (fish) and thai rice (spicy) . It's a festival of flavours in your mouth.
Curries are highly recommended.
SPECIAL MENTION :- Pad Thai- gravy flat noodles with shitake  mushrooms and cashew nuts. Super tasty. Loved their varieties.

Dessert:- Rum Bourbon Mousse. Smooth dark chocolate infused with rum and on a base of bourbon crumbs. Yep. That amazing.

Coming here very soon again. Loved the experience. üòç

Silver Platter is located on the Gariahat Ruby connector,Nabapally,near Acropolis Mall.Have tried their brand new Thai menu.First thing which will attract you is their Ambience,it's a small place but very nicely decorated.
Now come to the food.In starter I have tried Laksa Soup,it's nicely taste.Chicken Satey is marvellous and delicious,it's highly recommended.Prawn Satey is also enjoyable,but chicken was better and they served it with peanut butter which takes the satey to another level.Virgin mojito is fresh,a must try in drinks.
In main course I have tried Green Curry with prawn and chicken,it's excellent,you can try it with Lemon Rice.I just love the Thai Rice with sea foods and chicken,one should try it with the Red Curry which contains fish.Fishes are soft and extremely delicious and divine.Pad Thai is enjoyable.One should try their Iced Litchi Mojito,it's cooling,stimulating.
Management is well behaved and kind.
Overall it's an astonishing experience.

Silver Platter is a hidden continental food paradise near Acropolis Mall. A small place with few tables and chairs symmetrically arranged. ¬†Will be crampy for those who prefer to relax and expand their wings on dining table.¬†

Crispy Honey Chilli Chicken: Shredded pieces of chicken deep fried with thick batter coating sprinkled with sesame seeds. Sweetness has overpowered if any chilliness were even present.
Bacon Wrapped Prawn: Had smoky flavour of bacon but the prawn was not marinated properly. The raw smell of prawn spoils the dish.
Fish Oranzzy: This seems to be their best dish in the house. The presentation was great for a small eatery like this. Fish was amazing too only the quality of potato been used was very mediocre for such continental dishes. Garlic bread was burnt not toasted properly with garlic oil.
Chicken Stroganoff: This was surprisingly most decent and close to perfect dish available on the table. However here also the garlic bread quality was the spoiler.
Fruit Fantasy: Was a very simple dessert and colourful. However they took the risk to prepare this preparation with tasteless canned fruits. So there was no taste for the same.

On positive side, the price is on lower side and service was prompt. On negative side the AC was not working on that day, servers are not aware much about the dishes on menu and few dishes majorly lamb/mutton were not available due to unknown reasons. Potential is there for the property to shine but still some rough edges to be polished. Recommended for school/college goers but don't plan with family on a special occasion.

So this restaurant is just a few metres away from Acropolis Mall. It's a small restaurant. However, the food over here is simply great! I have already been here thrice and never have I been disappointed. The ambience is nice with some good music and aquariums. The service is pretty good. Now, coming to the food I ordered the 3rd time:
1. Fresh Lime Soda( Salty and Sweet)
2. Chicken Stroganoff
3. Mandarin Mashup
The soda was very soothing in this blistering heat of May, the Stroganoff was delicious to say the least and the Mandarin Mashup was a nice, spicy, Oriental dish.
However, from my experiences, I would say that the Chicken Stroganoff is a MUST TRY.

This small restaurant is located a few metres away from Acropolis Mall , and is prominently visible to anybody travelling on the Kasba to Ruby flank . The interiors of this place are warmly lit with aquariums lining both sides of the restaurant, giving it a submarine vibe . Plus you'll have little fishy friends listening in to your conversation, as you dig into scrumptious food. Coming to the food , the service here needs improvement as they hardly notice that you need a change of plates , or that your tissues need to be replaced , but the food ain't all so bad. In fact , they have Continental dishes on their menu , and they taste above average given the price bracket . The chilli pork was slightly overfried, but tasted good. The dry chilli chicken tasted good too. The grilled fish platter is recommended ,served with rice and garlic bread, with a mustard dip and slaw salad. The jerk pork chops is quite a tongue twister : once you're over the name , the dish comes with a similar dose of rice cooked in clarified butter, garlic bread, slaw salad, and two slices of pork ribs that are difficult to handle using the knife and fork they provide. The pork was too hard and had too much fat for my liking. The mixed hakka noodles here , was quite a relief , and tasted really good for usual comfort food. They do not serve alcohol , but have a few mocktails on their menu . The lime soda tasted good , and not too sweet , whereas the Cinderella is a yellow drink with too much sweetness . Overall , the prices here are pocket friendly and the ambiance of the restaurant should draw you in . Once you're in , order wisely , and it's sure to make your evening great .

Except the fact that half of the best items weren't available at 9pm, it was fine. Hospitality on point, it was the nicest among any other restaurants. Especially handing out kaya wipes and ice cubes. The special mocktail is also nice.

This place is situated in Rajdanga, Kasba just before the Acropolis Mall. The place is highly rated in Zomato so decided to drop in for lunch a couple of days back. The interiors are pretty simple and relatively small with a seating capacity of around 20 -25 people. Food quality was decent but nothing of the sort reviewed on Zomato. In fact after being repeatedly told by us to not to make the starters spicy, they got carried away by their own whims and the starters i.e Squid and Prawn was probably amongst the most spiciest of dishes i have ever had and as a result we could barely eat them. The main course was more decent. Overall an average place which can be tried in times of need!!

So this restaurant is just a few metres away from Acropolis Mall. It's a small restaurant. However, the food over here is simply great! I have already been here thrice and never have I been disappointed. The ambience is nice with some good music and aquariums. The service is pretty good. Now, coming to the food I ordered the 3rd time:
1. Fresh Lime Soda( Salty and Sweet)
2. Chicken Stroganoff
3. Mandarin Mashup
The soda was very soothing in this blistering heat of May, the Stroganoff was delicious to say the least and the Mandarin Mashup was a nice, spicy, Oriental dish.
However, from my experiences, I would say that the Chicken Stroganoff is a MUST TRY.

Paid a visit to this place with a friend, sometime back. We orderer fried calamari, bacon wrapped prawns and chicken Stroganoff.  We also ordered a couple of mocktails but I'd recommend anyone to steer clear of them. They didn't taste distinctly different from each other and were honestly, not that great. The food was however, another story altogether ! Every dish was delectable ! Yes I have had better versions of fried calamari and bacon wrapped prawns, but not much better. Even the prices here are reasonable! Definitely worth a visit.

To start of with its a small restaurant located just beside the acropolis mall, kasba. Its a small restaurant but a really cozy one. And as far as the ambience is, for the price its quite an apt one.
The waiters were quite friendly and the serving time was really quite short.. i had gone with my girlfriend and its quite a great place for couples and for friends to have lunch.
Finally about the food, we had ordered pepper garlic prawn for the appetizer , and it was delicious , the prawns were quite good in size (6 pieces) nd was really good .. For the main course we had ordered chicken stragganoff and bbq pork chops, as for the chicken stragganoff well served with rice and bread it was tasty.. maybe not the very best but certainly a treat for the taste buds. And the pork chops, served with bread and mashed potato... well only one thing it was delicious..and is highly recomemded..
Finally about the price, well its quite in budget and as for the ambience and food, its a must go for any foodie. They charge a small 5% service charge which is quite acceptible for their services..
To sum it up, its a really good place to go for a lunch..

Good food on time delivery . Both continental and Oriental food tastes good. Chicken a la Kiev was quite tasty whereas prawn cocktail was excessively tangy, they should work on it to balance the dish. The prawns used to prepare the dish are not prawns actually they are basically small shrimps , maybe they should also work on the name like üç§ shrimp cocktail.

Well, I was lured by some of the dishes in their menu card so without wasting any time, we visited this restaurant yesterday..
This restaurant is near acropolis mall and opposite to the Great Eastern store..
We reached there before 6pm but the owner was very soft spoken and he told u to come and sit inside..

There is nothing more relaxing than simply sitting and looking into beautiful aquariums..
The decor is really cool and the music is also good. The built in wall aquariums were quite impressive. Now coming to the food. We ordered
1) MINCED LAMB RAGU
2) CHICKEN TORZONE AND
3) FRUIT FANTASY.

The Minced Lamb Ragu was quite innovative and it was a burst of flavours in the mouth.. Great portion size and the good part was there was bread as well as rice, so u have options.
The beautifully made minced lamb curry was going extremely going well with the rice and the dish was a treat to the mouth..

Now, coming to the torzone.. Diced chicken cooked in white sauce with veggies tossed in mayo wrapped in tortillas.. The dish was perfect.. Sufficient for two and it is extremely filling.. But was expecting a few more pieces of chicken as there were more veggies inside it.. Nevertheless, i loved both the dishes and they are a must try!
Last but not the least, We also had Fruit Fantasy as the dessert.. The thing which i liked is they were cutting the fruits in front of us so we were quite assure that they r serving fresh fruits.. The crunchy watermelon and pineapples blended quite well with the vanilla ice cream topped with chocolate and strawberry sauce. The dessert was good but could have been better..

Overall, had a great experience here and would surely recommend this restaurant..

An upmarket restaurant at an affordable price. Good ambience with prompt service.

Had ordered for-

1. Veg clear soup: Extremely light and tasty soup with a lot of vegetables.

2. Salt and pepper prawn: Not deep fried, accurately fried without spoiling the taste of the prawns.

3. Burnt Garlic Spring Onion Rice: Different and appetizing.

4. Scheswan Prawn: Less spicy gravy, the perfect combination for the burnt garlic rice.

The best things about all the dishes were its presentations. A must try for all.

Not too impressive a menu. We ordered fried calamari & bacon wrapped prawns, both of which I had at "Roast", and would be proper comparison... Both failed miserably. Apart from the extra saltines, the calamari cuts were too thin, and lacked signature "chewiness". The dip provided was a basic mayo. The bacon wrapped prawn, too, was somewhat of a letdown. They also took 10 mins & one reminder to bring a beverage (bottled soft drink, not a mocktail) which we ordered mid meal.

I don't think I'll be visiting the same place since I have a far better option around the vicinity, with the same menu, and much more to add.

A basic 3‚≠ê for Silver Platter.

I am not entirely satisfied with my experience here. Don't get me wrong, this one is a fine restaurant which serves pretty good food at a reasonable rate. I have been here twice. Let me talk about my first experience, 'no pork item was available that day'. That was not a good welcome for us. Food was good, though mashed potato was very bad I have to say. Now my biggest complain about this place, - I don't like how they Indianize their foods. I loved their crispy chili squid. But a few continental items were a bit spicy, and I don't mean 'hot', I mean north indian kind of spicy. 
Compared to my 1st visit, 2nd visit was pretty good. Though I feel this place is overhyped in zomato, I shall like to visit again. And regarding their presentation and other stuffs, a big thumbs up.

True hidden gem in every sense of the word. I visited this place just a few days after it was opened. The place was nicely decorated but a bit dark. The staff was courteous. We order tacos, lamb raigu and pork chops. It was my 1st time trying Mexican food and it was pretty good. The lamb raigu had amazing flavours perfectly cooked. And last but not the least pork chops i was simply blown away by how good it was.
Amazing place amazing food highly recommended.

Its a pretty amazing place with even more amazing food.The walls are cladden with live aquariums and there is a live mocktail counter.from the mocktail section definitely try out the bartenders special-it was quite soothing and refreshing.Had fish oranzzy,chicken torzone and bacon wrapped prawn.Each and every item was unique and  delicious in its own way.The dip accompanying bacon wrapped prawn was too good and we were left licking our fingers.After savouring them all we were happy high!One thing i can assure is this place is definitely every foodie's delight.

This is a small place at Kasba near Acropollis mall.
We had ordered Salt and Pepper Mushroom for appetizer. Then for main course we had Veg Lasagna with Garlic Bread; Chicken A La Kiev with Mashed Potatoes, Veggies & Garlic Bread; Grilled Chicken Breast in BBQ Sauce with Mashed Potatoes, Saut√©ed Vegetable & Garlic Bread.
The food is pretty good. Not at all expensive. Serive was good as well.

This place was in my wish list for quite sometime. I was curious to know how such a small place (which could be easily mistaken for just any other 'shop' in a series of other shops in the close vicinity) could manage such a rating. We visited this place for Noboborsho dinner. Going straight to the food as the decor has not much to talk about. We had ordered:

1. Bacon Wrapped Prawns: It was a bit too saltly and the preparation could have been better.

2. Fish Oranzy: As rightly suggested in the other reviews, the fish was very succulent, well cooked with a rich flavour. The sauce served with it was tangy and good to taste. The mashed potato and bell pepper complimented the fish and added to the test.

3. Chicken Stroganof (with White sauce): Well cooked and extremely good to taste. The portion of rice was a little less though. The garlic bread was a good compliment with the chicken.

4. Virgin Mohito: Lacked the punch, could have been better.

Overall, the continental dishes lived up to the expectations. The service was good but has scope for improvement.

Silver Platter is like 10 minutes away from my place and I've only heard about the great food served here quite recently. So to tick this place of the list, the familia went for dinner. The place is quite small but neatly done with low lights, painted walls and a huge aquarium. It's located near Acropolis mall beside the stand alone KFC outlet. Now coming to what we ordered.My mom, my brother and I wanted to try their continental offerings whereas my father being a Chinese fan tried out their oriental dishes. For drinks we had Virgin Mohitos. It was quite good. A mixture of salty and sweet along with a dominant mint flavour. For starters we had Pepper Garlic Chicken which was really crunchy and tasty. For the main course my mom ordered a Grilled fish in lemon butter sauce served along with mashed potatoes and veggies. It had three fish fillets along with the sauce in the side.She liked the dish and i found the fish fillet really tender and soft. My brother and i ordered a Grilled chicken breast in white sauce and a Chicken lasagna. The grilled chicken was cooked to perfection and we really loved the white sauce. It had two chicken breasts and enough mashed potatoes for two. The lasagna was not made to our liking. It was slightly on the sweeter side, had a white sauce base ( we expected a red sauce base) and lacked flavour. So i took down one point for that.The quantity was really good though, quite enough for 4 people. 
Their Chinese dishes where also quite tasty which is really a plus point given this place specialises in continental cuisine. We ordered a  Chicken fried rice along with Hunan chicken. The rice was really light and not the typical Chinese fried rice. The hunan chicken was also quite good. Overall‚Äã i liked what this place brings to the table and i would love to visit again and try their fish oranzzy and lamb rague. Till then Happy Dining Peeps :)

Tried food from this outlet a couple of moths as it is very close to my house and I had read great reviews as well.

But sadly,found it very average and nothing special.

We ordered Fried Rice,Chilli Chicken and Chicken Stroganoff.The Chinese items were not upto the mark at all as it was very bland.

Update as on 13th April:
Thought of giving this place another try since we didn't enjoy our last experience comprising mainly of Chinese dishes.

So we ordered the Grilled Prawn in BBQ Sauce and Non Veg Penne Pasta in White Sauce.Please refer to my observations below:

Grilled Prawn in BBQ Sauce served with Rice and Garlic Bread-A few pieces of prawn tossed in a tomato gravy with an offensive smell.It came along with a miniscule portion of rice and 3 hard pieces of garlic bread.As soon as I put a piece of prawn in my mouth,it tasted like plastic and the gravy like puke.I didn't dare to try the garlic bread.It was an absolute mismatch in what the menu vis a vis the actual dish. Those were not GRILLED prawns and there waz no BBQ Sauce. Priced at INR 350 it was obnoxious.

Non Veg Penne Pasta in White Sauce-As soon as I opened the foil pack,the area was filled with an awful,weird and bad bad smell.I didn't even think of trying it.They have the guts and audacity of pricing it at INR 250.

We couldn't call up the outlet to complain as it was closed.We kept the food and called them the following day and they offered to replace the food of our choice.We want to the outlet and spoke to the owner who sounded apologetic.We parceled Mozzarella Cheese Sticks,Tempura Prawns and Bacon Wrapped Prawns and below are my observations:

Mozzarella Cheese Sticks-There were 6 medium sized sticks of Mozzarella which was seasoned properly and had a hint of a smell though not offensive.I think they have some major issue with the oil that they use.Priced at INR 120.

Tempura Prawns-Prawns were very soft and coated in  a light batter but again lacked seasoning.Priced at INR 220.

Bacon Wrapped Prawns-The prawns were undercooked though the bacon tasted good.Overall,salt was again an issue as it was lacking. Not worth the price of INR 270.

Adjusting my rating to 1.5 from the previous 2.5 though would have given 1 but settled for an extra .5 due to their gesture of replacing the food which still didn't help.

Highly not recommended.

This is a small place at Kasba near Acropollis mall.
We had ordered Salt and Pepper Mushroom for appetizer. Then for main course we had Veg Lasagna with Garlic Bread; Chicken A La Kiev with Mashed Potatoes, Veggies & Garlic Bread; Grilled Chicken Breast in BBQ Sauce with Mashed Potatoes, Saut√©ed Vegetable & Garlic Bread.
The food is pretty good. Not at all expensive. Serive was good as well.

This place was in my wish list for quite sometime. I was curious to know how such a small place (which could be easily mistaken for just any other 'shop' in a series of other shops in the close vicinity) could manage such a rating. We visited this place for Noboborsho dinner. Going straight to the food as the decor has not much to talk about. We had ordered:

1. Bacon Wrapped Prawns: It was a bit too saltly and the preparation could have been better.

2. Fish Oranzy: As rightly suggested in the other reviews, the fish was very succulent, well cooked with a rich flavour. The sauce served with it was tangy and good to taste. The mashed potato and bell pepper complimented the fish and added to the test.

3. Chicken Stroganof (with White sauce): Well cooked and extremely good to taste. The portion of rice was a little less though. The garlic bread was a good compliment with the chicken.

4. Virgin Mohito: Lacked the punch, could have been better.

Overall, the continental dishes lived up to the expectations. The service was good but has scope for improvement.

Silver Platter is like 10 minutes away from my place and I've only heard about the great food served here quite recently. So to tick this place of the list, the familia went for dinner. The place is quite small but neatly done with low lights, painted walls and a huge aquarium. It's located near Acropolis mall beside the stand alone KFC outlet. Now coming to what we ordered.My mom, my brother and I wanted to try their continental offerings whereas my father being a Chinese fan tried out their oriental dishes. For drinks we had Virgin Mohitos. It was quite good. A mixture of salty and sweet along with a dominant mint flavour. For starters we had Pepper Garlic Chicken which was really crunchy and tasty. For the main course my mom ordered a Grilled fish in lemon butter sauce served along with mashed potatoes and veggies. It had three fish fillets along with the sauce in the side.She liked the dish and i found the fish fillet really tender and soft. My brother and i ordered a Grilled chicken breast in white sauce and a Chicken lasagna. The grilled chicken was cooked to perfection and we really loved the white sauce. It had two chicken breasts and enough mashed potatoes for two. The lasagna was not made to our liking. It was slightly on the sweeter side, had a white sauce base ( we expected a red sauce base) and lacked flavour. So i took down one point for that.The quantity was really good though, quite enough for 4 people. 
Their Chinese dishes where also quite tasty which is really a plus point given this place specialises in continental cuisine. We ordered a  Chicken fried rice along with Hunan chicken. The rice was really light and not the typical Chinese fried rice. The hunan chicken was also quite good. Overall‚Äã i liked what this place brings to the table and i would love to visit again and try their fish oranzzy and lamb rague. Till then Happy Dining Peeps :)

Tried food from this outlet a couple of moths as it is very close to my house and I had read great reviews as well.

But sadly,found it very average and nothing special.

We ordered Fried Rice,Chilli Chicken and Chicken Stroganoff.The Chinese items were not upto the mark at all as it was very bland.

Update as on 13th April:
Thought of giving this place another try since we didn't enjoy our last experience comprising mainly of Chinese dishes.

So we ordered the Grilled Prawn in BBQ Sauce and Non Veg Penne Pasta in White Sauce.Please refer to my observations below:

Grilled Prawn in BBQ Sauce served with Rice and Garlic Bread-A few pieces of prawn tossed in a tomato gravy with an offensive smell.It came along with a miniscule portion of rice and 3 hard pieces of garlic bread.As soon as I put a piece of prawn in my mouth,it tasted like plastic and the gravy like puke.I didn't dare to try the garlic bread.It was an absolute mismatch in what the menu vis a vis the actual dish. Those were not GRILLED prawns and there waz no BBQ Sauce. Priced at INR 350 it was obnoxious.

Non Veg Penne Pasta in White Sauce-As soon as I opened the foil pack,the area was filled with an awful,weird and bad bad smell.I didn't even think of trying it.They have the guts and audacity of pricing it at INR 250.

We couldn't call up the outlet to complain as it was closed.We kept the food and called them the following day and they offered to replace the food of our choice.We want to the outlet and spoke to the owner who sounded apologetic.We parceled Mozzarella Cheese Sticks,Tempura Prawns and Bacon Wrapped Prawns and below are my observations:

Mozzarella Cheese Sticks-There were 6 medium sized sticks of Mozzarella which was seasoned properly and had a hint of a smell though not offensive.I think they have some major issue with the oil that they use.Priced at INR 120.

Tempura Prawns-Prawns were very soft and coated in  a light batter but again lacked seasoning.Priced at INR 220.

Bacon Wrapped Prawns-The prawns were undercooked though the bacon tasted good.Overall,salt was again an issue as it was lacking. Not worth the price of INR 270.

Adjusting my rating to 1.5 from the previous 2.5 though would have given 1 but settled for an extra .5 due to their gesture of replacing the food which still didn't help.

Highly not recommended.

A small restaurant near kasba, that serves really good grilled chicken breasts. We ordered sweet corn soup and crispy honey chilli chicken,which was good. Main course included grilled chicken breast,which was really good and chilli hakka noodles and chilli chicken. These two could have been little better when compared to grilled chicken. The only thing that i didnt like was the dessert. We wanted brownie with ice cream which they couldnt serve,so they suggested bourbon mousse ,which was a complete disaster! More or less pocket friendly. One must try out the grilled chicken breast.

This is like a hidden gem among the abundance of food outlets on the Kasba Road.Located just beside the Kasba KFC, this small quaint restro had earned quite a bit of reputation and praise from the food connoisseurs of this metropolitan.

I went there midweek along with my sister after a hectic day in college.It was around 7 in the evening and the customers had just started filling in the seats.  They didn't seem to have a large space and the decor is nothing fancy or something that one can speak at length about. Only the aquariums caught by attention for a while. 

Now, coming to the food part, though they have a large counter which completely resembles a bar counter, but unfortunately they don't serve drinks except the usual mocktails. We had Pink Rose to satiate our thirst.And, god, we were pleased! My sister had done her share of research before coming and she ordered Bacon Prawn and Fish Oranzzy. Both the dishes were refreshing and unique. Fish Oranzzy came with a uncanny sort of garnishing. But as I don't like mashed potatoes much, I'd have to deduct a point for filling the multilayered dish with layers of mashed potatoes. We were in a bit of a debate whether to try pork chops (I wanted those coz had been suggested by a friend) or Chicken Torzone and we settled on the latter. And yet again it didn't disappoint us a bit. On the contrary, we were so full by the time we had a piece or two of the Torzone that we literally had to struggle to finish the whole thing. Also, I have to mention about the mayo sauce that accompanied most of the dishes were finger lickin' good so much so that I asked for some more. 

I'd definitely come back for the pork chops and the other dishes with a hope that they'd surprise me like the first time.Happy dining! :)

A small place with not so fancy decor and normal table chairs for sitting arrangements..but the food is just upto mark here..ü§ó

We ordered crispy honey chilli chicken fr starters. 
Sister in arms and Shirley temple for beverages. 
And chicken stroganof, oranzy fish as main course. 

The chilli chicken was really crispy..a good amount for two people..cooked nicelyü§ó

Chicken stroganof is basically shredded chicken cooked in white sos and lots of cheese, served with a portion of rice and salad.. the quantity of chicken is really good,and I just Loved this dish üòç The chicken tasted so good with the proper amount of cheese and herbs. ü§ó

Fish oranzy is known as their signature dish...three decent amount of bhetki fillets.. served with salad,that oranzy sos it was cooked with and mashed potato with a lemon slice on top. The fish was  really soft and tender with use of light spices in the oranzy sos..Another great dish..üòç

For dessert we had fruit fantasy.that is not only just normal fruits and ice cream..They made the fruit salad with love also..üòá It was made separately with mint leaves and few flavours..and then served with the ice cream on top. üôÇüòç
A great ending to our dinner. 
So the place is really cheap compared to other restro with this tasty food,and the dishes are amazing.. visiting again very soon. ü§óüòáüòç

Today we ordered food from here..  The delivery of the food was on time, even the food was hot. But we were very disappointed with the quality and the taste of the food..  We ordered chicken fried rice which was extremely bland and very dry. Hearing that their manchow soup is popular we ordered it, but it so sour that I had to add tomato ketchup, sugar free tablets, salt and pepper to make it worth to eat,  still I could not finish the soup as the sour taste was hurting my taste buds.. Lastly, the chili chicken was so bad that we had to throw it..  The chicken was stale and rough.. It smelled horrible.. Over all the experience of the food was extremely disappointing.. It was total waste of our money...

Silver platter was on my wish list because of its high rating. I had Fish Oranzzy, signature dish of Silver Platter. Then I had penne in white sauce. Oranzzy was presented beautifully with the pulpy orange sauce which complemented the dish perfectly. Penne in white sauce was okayish. I have had better pastas. They gave enough mashed potatoes and two garlic breads along with the dishes. Staffs are courteseous and the service was fast. :)

Ever heard of th phrase 'Good things come in small packages' . Well small i say because of the area of tha place but make no mistake its as big as it can get when it comes to food quality. Living just a couple of mins away from this place it took me more than a year to fix my first date with this 'small wonder' . 'Better late than never' I guess. The menu is alluring with continent italian and chinese at their disposal. We tried lasagne and oranzzy fish. Although th fish was Basa it was very flavourful and well cooked. Lasagne was quite extraordinary. We could finish only half of what was served. Portion size was good enough for me and my wife. Staff looked a bit misfit considering the extravagant menu but they turned out to be courteous and knowledgeable. Overall this place is a must try.

Last night I saw in zomato that rating of silver platter is very high so there food quality also should high as per zomato rating so we planned to ordered grilled fish,chicken stroganoff,and spaghetti non veg white sauce..
Non veg spaghetti which is taste less..may be you people can say it's white sauce that's why but there is no salt also, so it's better after making and before serving taste it atleast it's perfect or not..
Chicken stroganoff which is very good in quantity but again taste is very poor..I ordered in pepper sauce but it's taste is very bad..
Grilled fish which I liked but they served mashed potato along with fish which is spoiled because mashed potato is 2 to 3 days old when I taste it was not creamy it was sour..
Only one thing is good that was quantity of food..
We don't care about quantity we love taste...
Guys I am very sorry for this review...
And it was in home delivery..even along with the food they didn't give oregano and chilli flakes which is very essential along with Italian food..

An amazing food outlet serving both continental and Chinese food this place is perfect in almost every way. They need to increase their seating arrangement to fit in more people, but otherwise everything was perfect from the service to the food.
I had the Chicken‚Äã ala Kiev which was amazing. The day at the beach and blue lagoon were both great too. The chili honey chicken was a bit overcooked but otherwise amazing as well.

The place : Small and decoration average. Staff are polite and helping.
Zomato rank at present is a bit high according to me. A rating of 4 is justified.
Worth a try.

So after seeing the soaring ratings of this place, I was really excited to visit it. But I was a bit disappointed. The ambiance could have been made much better. The aquariums and the walls look a bit squashy, I don't know why, maybe they should put in more fishes or change the ply around.. The interiors were lying lazily succumbed to some past decor, something that looked like a Christmas celebration to me. 3/5 

Moving on to the food, I ordered Virgin Mojito which was nice. For starters, Mozzarella cheese sticks were kind of tightly tucked in and slightly blah, tasted as if the cheese wasn't of great quality. Also, the chicken lollipop gave away a taste of slightly uncooked flour batter inside which must have been used for coating etc. Coming to the main course the Burnt Garlic spring onion Rice tasted amazing. Properly infused flavor and perfectly tossed veggies in it. We had Fish Oranzy which was perfectly lovable too. Soft and fresh ingredients to boost it up. Lastly, the lasagna was a bit of surprise. I don't generally like lasagnas when they put tomato sauce in it, but they had cooked it well. The ingredients were completely mellow and though not very cheesy and authentic, it tasted better than most. They should probably put in more parmesan cheese and chicken in it.¬† 3.5/5

If hitting just for continental on-budget food, this place should be a good pick. The service is very polite and prompt 4.5/5. I would like to discover more of their dishes in the future.

Honestly,I haven't tasted such delicious food in a while.
For food, we ordered Minced Lamb Ragu,Crispy Chilli Squid,Chilli Pork and each of them taste heavenly.
I took Bartender's Special Mocktail,which was surprisingly good.
The ambience and the service were better than i expected.
This pocket friendly eatry place is a must go for all.

The chatters about the brilliance of this place was reaching my ears for quite some time now. Decided to visit the place today with my woman. The modest cavity the place hides in is completely deceiving of the punch it packs.

Being the day of romance the touch of strewn balloons across the floor was more than welcome. The staff pampered us well. They even gave us a chocolate as the guy crooned "happy valentines day to both of you". Well that was sweet. And they even waived off the service charge and we could see it was not a marketing gimmick but a genuine gesture which made us feel special.

Coming to the food, it was amazing. We ordered a Minced lamb Lasagna and a Pork Jerk chops. The lasagna made me squeal, gulp and speak with my mouth full like a Joey while the succulent meat gave the fill.

This place qualifies as one of those you can keep on visiting any number of times and still want to look forward to the next time by the time you are making your way towards the exit. 

Visit 2: The taste memory being hacked, plans with silver platter as the cynosure kept cropping up arbitrarily. It was a matter of days that the second visit got approved. 

With expectations shooting through the roof things were bound to get a modesty check. We trooped into the familiar dimly lit caveat at around mid day today and were welcomed by the courteous team. Ordered a Crisp honey chicken to start with followed by a Chicken stroganoff, a Mandarin mashup and some Veg Torzones.  To see all that off was a Bourbon mousse. The honey chicken failed to create much of an impression and sadly could not honour the hype it was receiving. The Mashup (Fish and shredded chicken tossed in sauce served with rice) was okay. The stroganoff and the Torzones made up for much of the lost ground and stamped their presence too. Did justice to the noise Silver Platter has drummed up of being among the best continental joints in town. Lastly the mousse saw us off with real charm. Visit number two scored as high as the first one and the control returning we made our way for saroo (Sunny Pawar).

I was out for a movie at the acropolis mall when I had a sudden continental craving, so, I got reminded about this resto-cafe recommended by one of my buddies. I just dropped by it and from the appearance, ¬†it didn't quite impress me but then after ordering for Crab dishes, they told me that neither any crab dishes nor any prawn dishes could be served as they were out of it. I got really disheartened. We then order for Crispy Chilli Squid and trust me It tasted so very sumptuous, I mean I had tasted it before at Santa's Fantasea but this just surpassed it. Then we ordered a mocktail which was bartender's special and it also tasted really good. Then we ordered another starter, Chilli Pork which was very nicely tossed and cooked. Then we dived into the main course and ordered Minced Lamb Ragu, and this surpassed all the dishes as it tasted so heavenly. I fell for this food served here and would really love to get back ASAP.

We visited this place in a group of 4 along with 2 kids. We parked our car in Acropolis mall and went to the restaurant walking. However corporation parking is available in the front road so that can also be used. Ambience or Decor is simple and little clumpsy. I got mild smell of alcohol while entering. Regarding service, there is one service boy who is efficient and can answer all queries. Others are not that efficient. However service time for food is good. Coming to food we ordered 2 french fries (specially for kids), 2 chilly porks, 1 crispy honey chilli chicken and 1 bacon wrapped prawn. All starters were mind blowing. In main course, we ordered 1 pork chop in barbq sauce, 1 chicken alakeiv, 1 fish oranzi and 1 fish of minced lamb which was served with rice. First 3 dishes were pretty good although they serve only basa fish for fish items. The last dish was not as per expectation. I would recommend to be restricted with their signature dishes and not try something new for which no review is available or they are not suggesting it. Cost was very reasonable - so much of food only at 2500 bucks (including 3 soft drinks). Buy still I think 4.8 is a little overrating for this place. Something above 4 is more justified. Overall very good place for a dine out within limited budget.

Its a small joint at rajdanga main road,with a very decent and well behaved staff. We tasted few moctails like blue lagoon and day at the beach it was nice. Then came the starters crispy honey chilli chicken,salt and pepper fish with cheese sticks it was awesome just to explain in few words. Then the main course came chicken breast in bbq sauce,fish oranzzy,chicken sausages in bbq sauce,chicken and mayo salad,fried rice and garlic fish all were excellent no complains about the quality,taste and quantity of the food. My favourite fish oranzzy one must taste that in there visit atleast once.

Finally got to visit this place yesterday afternoon with a few friends of mine. The expectations were very high from this place (considering the ratings) and honestly it didn't let us down. Unfortunately the fish items were not available so we had to stick with the pork and chicken. In the starters we ordered pepper garlic chicken and Bacon wrapped prawns. In the main course we had Pork Surf and Turf and Grilled Chicken in BBQ sauce. All the dishes were cooked to perfection though the bacon wrapped prawns could have been a bit better.  The staffs were decent and courteous. On our request they made the pork surf and turf in BBQ sauce which was supposed to come in pepper sauce. Overall it was a very pleasant experience for me and my friends and we will surely visit this place again.

I liked their food and menu when they started. Off late they have diversified and are also offer oriental, mostly Chinese cuisine too.

There continental dishes are good although they do not give mashed potatoes with Chicken Stroganoff as they give rice with it. And again during a home delivery they replaced the saute veg with mayo salad and gave some wired culinary rule for it.... Although I think they might have messed it up.

Anyway, their food is good. The pork chops tastes awesome. So does the grilled chicken and the Stroganoff. The bacon wrapped prawns are cool.

The restaurant is small and they have tried to make it cool with aquariums. But the entrance with a black grill gate looks cheap.

The staff and service has definitely fallen.

I don't know may be that is the reason I no more order from or come down to Silver Platter... It's very near to where I stay but subconsciously I skip this place may be I have felt something wrong or did not like the way they forced their views when they replaced saute veg with mayo salad last time. This was a small thing but it is a bad place full of competition.

Went on a wednesday afternoon. It was all empty.
Ordered a pasta white sauce penne. And a chicken lasagna.
The pasta was ok in quantity. Enough for 2. Had no vegetables. I will say 3/5.
The lasagna was not that good. Though it was a chicken lasagna it was full of vegetables and had less chicken. And was full of carrots mostly. 2/5
Both the food were of average quality. 4 8 for the restaurant is a bit too much.
The staff were very good though.

Heard a lot about this small joint located near hdfc bank rajdanga, so decided to give it a try with 2 of my close friends.
We ordered crispy honey chicken for starters and then grilled chicken roast, mixed rice, schezwan chicken and lastly chicken cheese sub, taste was great, its more specifically a continental based restaura, quantity was also descent,although the interiors doesnt give you the impression that its so good.
Will definitely visit with my gf next time, one let down was that they didnt accept card for payment. :(

Food is really good. Pricing and Quantity is great. But..... service is awful and too slow. Only a single guy takes orders, serves food, arranges table and accepts payments. After we had our food and were about to pay.... he says that cards are not accepted.
Probably would not be visiting next time.

This is a hidden gem of South Kolkata! But is it's place really hidden? Absolutely not! It is located near Acropolis Mall, alongside the main road, but the opening usually goes unnoticed because of rather simple display board out there! From outside, it is in no way attractive. But once you enter, it is quite a pleasant ambience. Well lit, surrounded by aquariums, and comfortable seating arrangement, though quite small.

Due to such a high rating, and amazing reviews o Zomato, this was one of those in my must visit list since the day I came to know about this place. Finally today I managed to check in, and had a huge expectation of a scrumptious dinner. I went here with my friend, and we being extremely hungry, yet tight on pocket, had to limit ourselves.

We began with an appetizer, Chilli Pork. The pork was crispy and flavours of the preparation was very well blended with the meat. We felt like ordering a million more dishes of the same item! Now, in main course, we had ordered Chicken Stroganoff in White Sauce & Grilled Chicken Breast in BBQ Sauce. Chicken Stroganoff was quite delicious, the sauce was simple yet had the yummy feeling. The veggies served were well-cooked, mashed potatoes was as usual, and garlic bread was a little crispy. The quantity was good, but being a continental dish, one plate never satisfies my tummy! Next, the Grilled Chicken Breast. This item was in my wishlist as I had read a lot about this item, many people praising it. At first look, I was disheartened, because I was expecting one of the best BBQ Sauce out there, and to my disappointment, the first impression wasn't pleasing. But after taking the first bite, my impression changed, and I started loving it. Though not the best BBQ Sauce out there, but still it is better than many, and probably one of the best in this price range. The chicken was cooked beautifully, but it was a little hard to cut into pieces, though manageable.

Now coming to their service, they were a little slow to bring the menu card to us, but thereafter they were efficient and well mannered. Now the thing that I really didn't like about this place was the background music. This may be our personal problem, but we don't like bass heavy music, and the music being played was too bass heavy! Lyrics hardly audible, and it makes me feel uncomfortable.

However, their food is quite delicious, and they deserve to get recommendation for their servings.

Thank You. I'm signing off!

Well yes..they surely know how to prepare the best continental items in town...however things were not up to my expectations based on Zomato ratings.The service was pathetic..the ACs were not working..and yes we were asked to wait for a table though the seats were unoccupied..!The attendant was totally clueless of items available and 2 of our items got edited after placing..! The Pepper Garlic Chicken,Fish Oranzzy¬†and Grilled Chicken were brilliant..but the fresh lime soda and Virgin mojito was a complete waste..!

Silver Platter is located in Kasba, few minutes walk from Acropolis Mall towards  Ballygunge. It serves wonderful continental dishes and very pocket friendly. We went there on Valentine's Day at 12 pm the place was nicely decorated with white and red balloons. We ordered cupid fantasy and day at the beach for mocktails . I pesonally preferred cupid fantasy because of its tangy flavour. For starter we ordered crispy chilli squid. The squid was not up to the mark because it was very chewy. For the main course we had ordered grilled chicken breast in barbeque sause and grilled prawn. The chicken was succulent. I feel that the prawn was slightly overcooked but other than that it was fine. The staff was very courteous. They gave us complimentary  chocolates because it was Valentine's Day.

This place is a true hidden gem. It's a small place situated near Acropolis Mall, which people might often fail to notice. But the food was unexpectedly amazing. The continental food here is something to fie for. The price was totally reasonable and the quantity of the food was good enough. The service was prompt and helpful. Anyone who is searching for a good place to eat may try this one out. Highly recommended.

One of the best places ever visited. This restaurant stands upto its rating. They have the best continental food. We ordered chicken strogranoff, minced lamb ragu and grilled chicken breast in pepper sauce. All the dishes where well presented and tasted too good. Chicken stroganoff was the best among them. Getting such high quality continental food at such low price is very rare in kolkata. 
The ambience is very good.

It's truly a hidden gem. Situated near acropolis mall, this is a small place, which people might miss often. But the food!! It is really awesome. We ordered Prawn cocktail, Soy honey chicken wings, Fish oranzzy and Chicken Torzone. All were very very tasty and unique. It is also quite reasonable. But they need to work on the get up of the restaurant, as it is not very easy to notice, until n unless the person is following zomato.

I have ordered home delivery 4-5 times from this place and have sat and dined with a colleague/friend 4-5 times. Each time they have served us super amazing food. The different sauces they make for their dishes are very carefully prepared to aptly complement the main dish. The food at times just plays with your senses teleporting you to a different world altogether where it's just you and the food. I will keep trying all their cuisines. Big thumbs up to the chef(s) of the place, you guys want a Michelin star ?! 

I have deducted a star for being served a more than soggy chilli pork once, a weirdly tasting fresh lime soda once and mostly for not investing in your packaging department for delivered food. Really 3rd class cheap packing guys !! Doesn't go well with entire package, trust me. Once the entire gravy of the mandarin mashup was out in the plastic bag which also soaked the cardboard box of other dishes. Damn such a nightmare that was. Please get those plastic dabbas for parcels. That's all. Cheers for the great food again.

This is one hidden gem. With good PR agencies, this quaint restaurant near Nabapally bus stop could have given top notch 5 star ¬†restaurants a run for their money. The ambience is very nice and the food was excellent to say the least. We had ordered Pepper Garlic Fish(Dry) , Lemon Chicken Skewers and Chicken Sweet Corn Soup(for my 3-year-old) for starters. The fish was just out of this world. For main course we had ordered Fussili Chicken Pasta (a bit undercooked, 0.5 deducted for that) Spaghetti Lamb Bolognese, Chicken Hakka Noodles, Chicken Shanghai Rice, Hunan Fish and Garlic Chicken. Apart from the Pasta, everything was excellent. Would love to go back soon.

I visited the place on a Saturday evening. I booked the table through zomato but was shocked to see that the place was completely vacant in a weekend during dinner hours! Was quite confused to step in the best rated place in kolkata all alone.
Ordered chicken white sauce pasta followed by minced lamb torzone and ended the meal with their special bourbon mousse.
The food service was pretty fast.
I must say that the pasta was hot cheesy and very likable.
Loved the lamb dish which came in tortillas with a dip.
The mousse was also very well prepared, although the quantity being on the lower side.
Me and my friend were completely full at just 685 bucks!
Commendable pricing, awesome food and bare minimum decor!
The sure place to be while expecting the best in class food! Zomato was indeed helpful!

Main thing I need to tell that it was one of the pretty good continental foods store with a budget price. cheer up.Staffs are nice and well behaved. They can guide you well about the menu.we ordered Blue Lagoon, Sister in Arm's and Virgin Mojito, Crispy Honey Chicken, Chicken and Mayo Salad , Mandarin Masup, Tortilla Chicken Lasagne, ¬†Chicken Torzone. And restaurant ambiance and decor is charming. and also ceiling ¬† paint is too attractive to see. I liked it and will go again. it's just beside the kfc ruby and acropolis mall.

After reading all the positive reviews about silver platter, me and my husband thought to give it a try.. Well it's was me actually who insisted! The place is small yet well decorated. We ordered a fresh lime soda, crispy honey chilli chicken, grilled chicken breast and minced lamb ragu. The honey chilli chicken was quite sweet as it's meant to be considering the use of honey but the strips of chicken was a bit dry and chewy. We waited patiently for the main course to arrive and after the food was served the look of it was good. Here comes the big 'but' in the picture....The food! Everything from the BBQ sauce to the lamb ragu had only one distinct taste and that is sweet... Sweet to the point that you forget what are you actually eating! Grilled chicken for me should have a smokey flavour with freshly tossed vegetables and mashed potatoes.. As far as the accompaniments with the chicken is considered it was good but the main dish was a huge let down. The lamb didn't have any flavour except the small chunks of tomato and bell peppers which kept on interrupting!!
Overall a less than average experience and yes money well wasted. I am sorry to say I didn't find it to be an emerging competitor to the other restaurants in Kolkata but yes you can give it a try... It's not compulsory that everyone needs to feel the same.

Amidst the rise of fancy star studded restaurants, which sometimes fail to deliver upto their potency, comes around Silver Platter‚Ä¶slowly gathering fame for its lip-smacking food, available at reasonable prices. There‚Äôs no technicolour show here. Just great quality food at a bearable pocket pinch.

Silver Platter is located at a 2-minute walking distance from Acropolis Mall and its right there on the main road, which makes it easy to spot. As hinted above, the interiors are normal and decent. They have extended multiple aquariums alongside the walls and the floor is covered with artificial grass. Lighting is dim with funky looking lanterns hung from the ceiling.

They have recently launched a new vegetarian menu and I had been invited here by Foodzpah to try it out. So I am going to list out some items which are a must try for all the vegetarians visiting this place.

The service was fluent throughout the event even though there were other customers. Keeping it short and simple, I would say that Silver Platter is a gem of a place serving you with pleasant food at pocket friendly prices, and a place that is suitable to people of all age groups.

Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!

Travelling from one part of Kolkata to another, unless it is incentivised is really boring. üòõ And since food was in the scene how could I not go? Better late than never, eh?

Want to Celebrate by #4OOth Review on #Zomato¬†¬†with my foodie friends so¬†Shahbaaz Zaman¬†my buddy friend¬†Invited me here to attend the new menu launch of Silver Platter were some amazing veg dishes was added in menu so that both our vegetarian and non-vegetarian friends gonna enjoy the delicious night.

Silver Platter was located in 101, Rajdanga Nabapally, Kasba just 2 minutes walking from Acropolis Mall.

Silver Platter is a decent sized restaurant with seating for around 34. They serve Seafood, Continental and Chinese Cuisines. Non-Veg Dishes are there Specialties but the new menu have some heavenly delicious veg dishes too. There are some restaurants with huge space and amazing ambience with decent food and high price but Silver Platter is opposite. We find here Deliciously Amazing food with small space, decent ambience and very reasonable price. ¬†With Some mouth watering Dishes they also serve some refreshing mocktails, really good Cafe drinks and delicious Desserts.¬†

* Ambience - A low light classy environment with some cool looking lights, grass carpet, decent tables & Chairs, Bar themed counter, Aquarium walls on both sides with real small fishes and a dummy jellyfish and bricked wallpaper one side. An peaceful classy environment for dine in. very impressed ¬†with the hospitality. Hospitality was heart touching specially when owner, head chef and staffs are familiar. Service in reasonable time and presentation was perfectly ravishing.

So now let's see what they have for us in their new menu -

* Fresh Lime Soda - Sprite based drink with added some sugar syrup and lemon juice. taste was refreshing, sweet and little tangy. Perfect drink with your heavy meal served in tall glass with lemon slice for garnish.

* Crispy Baby Corn - Crispy baby corn is a quick Indo-Chinese recipe that is easy to prepare and delicious to eat. It's served hot as a starter! They made it perfectly. It was spicy, crispy, crunchy and amazingly delicious.

* Salt & Pepper Mushroom - ¬†That's the way we can make these crispy, little spicy & delicious starter - ¬†Wash and pat dry the mushroom. Season the mushroom with salt and pepper and coat with corn flour and deep fry till crispy.¬†
Heat the wok with oil add onion ,garlic , ginger then saut√© then add chilli flakes and toss .¬†
Add Crispy mushroom, chop spring onion add soya and Finish with vinegar.Garnished with spring onion.¬†

* Stir Fried Veg Chilli Basil - This dish is so fresh and full of flavor! A Thai Snack made with lot's of colorful vegetables and Thai basil in chilly sauce. ¬†Stir fried vegetables with basil leaves saut√© in Ginger & garlic chilly sauce tastes amazingly delicious. it was little spice, fully vegan and deliciously healthy.

* Fusilli with Broccoli Ping Sauce - Baked Fusilli pasta with some Broccoli cooked in ping sauce which was made with juicy tomatoes pasto and Ginger Garlic paste. It was spicy, tangy and very delicious. Served with Garlic Bread.

* Veg Tarzon - Here comes the shows topper. One of the most delicious italian dishes I've ever tasted. Grilled tortilla's coated with chocolate syrup and melted goat cheese and stuffed with cheesy mayonnaise coated boiled vegetables. It was cheesy, creamy, mouth watering and heavenly delicious. Served with celery mayo. Heavenly delicious dish highly recommended. Non-Veg version has chicken stuffed.

* Veg Lasagna - Lasagna are wide, flat-shaped¬†pasta, and possibly one of the oldest types of pasta.¬†The word "lasagna", can also refer to a dish made with several layers of lasagne sheets alternated with sauces and various other ingredients. They presented the dish like this. Baked Lasagna pasta sheets topper with Baked cheese coated raw tomatoes and cucumber cutouts and filled with cheesy mayonnaise coated boiled vegetables. Very, cheese, creamy and little fruity pasta which tastes amazingly delicious.

We ended with a dessert called * Split Banana - It was the simplest looking dessert which tastes heavenly delicious. Made with 3 scoop of strawberry, vanilla and butterscotch with 2 bananas and all coated with chocolate and strawberry syrup and some nuts.

Before rapt up like to thank

Silver Platter  is a gem of a place which is definitely going to impress you by its food and attractive prices.This place justifies the proverb "Never judge a book by its cover" as they follow  old school business of providing finger licking food instead of focusing on ambiance and shimmering interiors.They deal in Chinese,Seafood and Continental cuisines and the dishes we had were-

1:Crispy babycorn-This was a regular crispy chilli baby corn which tasted quite good and one can never go wrong with it.

2:Veg Torzone-This dish comes along with 4 portions of wraps filled with mayonese and veggies and tasted excellent.

3:Fusilli with broccoli ping sauce-This was the mixed sauce spiral pasta which was served with two garlic bread and was extremely good in taste.

4:Veg lasgna-This lasgna was the best we ever had.The three layers consisted of cheese,vggies and mayo and it was perfectly baked.

5:Split banana-This dessert comes with 3 scoops of icecream and two pieces of banana topped with chocolate sauce and nuts.

6:Choco Bourbon Mousse-This was a chocolate mousse which consist of rum,bourbon pieces and is topped with cream.This tasted excellent and was presented very well.

All the above dishes are a must try and a visit to this place is highly recommended.

Truly this place stands up to its rating, no doubt to revisit once again. Locating it is way too easy else google map will always be there. Our menu went like this-
‚ñ™Ô∏èSoya Honey Chilli Wings: it will give a kick to the tastebuds to start with, wings tossed in honey sauce.
‚ñ™Ô∏èChicken Stroganoff: the usual continental flavour to proceed no such attraction still worth a try.
‚ñ™Ô∏èGrilled Chicken In BBQ sauce: chicken breast served with bbq sauce, mashed potatoes and veggies. (Recommended)
‚ñ™Ô∏èFruit Fantasy: a scoop of ice cream served over diced fruits, ended the meal on a good note.
Overall a very good experience, the service was mentionable. Interior is not so worthy except the aquarium enhances its beauty. What makes the place even more catchy is that the menu is inclusive of taxes & prices are fixed very reasonably. Indeed a worthy try atleast once.

A bit cramped up place, not very comfy seating. Decor is not that great. But food makes it an awesome place to visit again. We got lamb with a rice preparation,chilli pepper chicken, honey glazed chicken, lemon glazed grilled fish, lasagna and spaghetti. All were quite good. Especially will suggest their lamb main course and honey glazed chicken appetiser. Service is quite good. A quite reasonable price for the quality and amount if food they provide

Went there yesterday with my seven-year-old daughter and had some lamb lasagna, which was pretty good. The jerk pork chops were even better, though perhaps a little tough for those used to Indian overdone meats. The service was outstanding, with at least three people hovering around the table, anxious to supply our every need. It was an odd hour, and soon we were the only customers, so that probably helped. Prices were not unreasonable; we had a soup, mozzarella sticks, a lasagna, a pork chop, an extra serving of rice, and desserts, and it was ‚Çπ1265/-. I can recommend the place to all foodies without reservation.

Silver Platter a name that will remain in my mind for the days to come. A pocket friendly continental and Chinese restaurant which serves great finger licking food. Currently rated 4.8 just below BBQ nation and they deserve it.
I went with my friends to try some dishes here. Those are:
Fish finger - classical fingers with fresh basa fish was as crispy as desired
Pepper garlic chicken - tossed in traditional sauce with a hint of pepper was too good.
Grilled chicken breast - made in creamy mushroom sauce served with saute veg , mash and garlic bread is truly their signature dish
Grilled fish - served with lemon butter sauce and the above same accompaniments was also mouth watering
Pork surf & turf - traditional pork chops served in pepper sauce and grilled prawn..is truly amazing
Chicken Lasagna - a improved version of the classical lasagna served in tortilla sheets is definitely a must try
Bourbon mousse - ahhhh the taste...the creaminess is just wowww..
A definite visit is a must. If you want to visit a restaurant just for its good food and nothing else...this is THE PLACE..

We went to have dinner here on 1st Jan evening after reading rave reviews about their continental dishes. As expected, the restaurant was packed. Service was also slow. Food didn't disappoint. Contrary to the not so great seating arrangements,interior furnishings and ambience, the food is top notch. We ordered
1. Fish Oranzzy - 3 pieces of bhetki fillets stacked on three pieces of bell pepper stuffed with mashed potatoes. The sauce served was very less in quantity. Tangy and delicious. I would have liked if they served more sauce.

2. Grilled Fish in lemon butter sauce - again 3 pieces of bhetki fillet served with a bowl of lemon butter sauce. The sauce was yummy. A little sour.
3. Grilled chicken breast in bbq sauce- the barbecue sauce was very different from what I've gad at other places. This was the yummiest dish.
4. Mixed Gravy Chowmein - usual. Nothing out of ordinary.
All the continental dishes were served with garlic bread. The sauces accompanying the fish oranzzy and grilled chicken were quite sweet. Not quite like what I expecteds so, if you do not prefer sweet sauces, you could tell me while ordering.

Also, the prices are really reasonable and they charge only 5% tax on food.

Visited this place on 1st Jan around 7pm. Well the ambience is nice with aquariums around and also a jelly fish in one of them! Yet, the space is quite less and on peak hours the place may get clumsy.
We ordered:-
1. Non veg manchow soup - Was kinda ok. Neither too good in taste nor quantity. Chicken waa less and the dish tasted dull to some extent. 

2. Bacon wrapped prawn - Was really delicious. An unique dish and worth d money.

3. Grilled chicken breast - I wonder how this menu is listed in zomato as "what you should order" üôÑ It was just two pieces of grilled chicken steak dipped in bbq sauce and tasted just okay. It was accompanied with two small garlic breads and some mashed potato nd some veggies. Not at all worth 300 bucks. 

4. Fruity fantasy- they said they dont have any other desserts and insisted us to have that and also said its their signature dish. We were expecting something great. Well when it came we found it was just a scoop of amul vanilla icecream overloaded with watermelon and pineapple cubes. That was sort of a homemade experimentation on icecream . Because of so many cubes of fruits the icecream melted easily and we only had fruits . 

Waiters are decent and cooperative. Overall what i feel is this food joint is way too overrated in zomato. It doesnt deserve to be more than 4 or 4.2. I dont know I may have missed their other "Signature Dishes" , üòùüòù but for this time, i felt d this place doesnt deserve to be only 0.1 points behind BBQ Nation üòëüòë. Its way behind that.

This small restaurant is located at Kasba, just few minutes walk from the Acropolis Mall. The ambience is very nice with a huge aquarium. The service is a bit slow but good. A number of Continental, Sea Food & Chinese dishes are available. We ordered Crispy Baby corn & Grilled Chicken Breast in BBQ sauce. They tasted good. The price is more or less reasonable. Only 5% service tax is added to the bill. A hidden gem for all foodies.

I visited this place for the first time on christmas and I loved the food so much that I had to visit it again on new year's eve. It has some of the most lipsmacking continental dishes in Kolkata that has left me craving for more.

During our first visit, we didn't have any starters but on the second time, we decided to have Bacon Wrapped Prawns. It was so succulent and perfect that it makes my mouth water whenever I think of it.

In the main course, we tried chicken stroganoff both time and each time it was brilliant. It is definitely a must have. We also had fish oranzzy as it was recommended in zomato. The presentation was very nice. It looked like a double decker burger but it had 3 bhetki fillets on top and three slices of capsicum filled with mashed potato below it. The fish was very well prepared and it went well with the mashed potatoes. there was also sauce given but it was too sweet.¬†

We also tried veg lasagna as well as chicken lasagna. Both had enormous quantity which is more than sufficient for 2 people. Coming to the preparation, both were prepared in the same way and the only difference was that there were some chicken pieces in the latter but it was hard to find them. ¬†We felt the veg lasagna was better than the chicken lasagna.

On christmas, there was a new dessert which they recommended. It was a chocolate mousse made from homemade chocolate and rum. I am not a big fan of chocolate, especially melted one, ¬†but this was really good.¬†

In all, the rating for this restaurant is totally justified. This place has top notch food at pocket friendly prices. (Did I mention that they only charge 5% tax... Unheard of!!!)
Please do visit if you love or want to try continental food.

So when mass follows that particular 'Street' this eve, some foodies are eager to search for hidden eateries of this city!
And this excursion gave a so-so result!!

First, we ordered Crispy Chilli Squid... It was pretty average as the squid got too crunchy so the taste wasn't up to the mark!

Next came Minced Lamb Ragu... Honestly, it was a gem in the true nature... Lamb shreds in authentic Italian Ragu sauce... It was truly delicious!!!!!!!!!

Now, a recommended dish here... Grilled Chicken Breast in BBQ sauce... No doubt both the quality of chicken and the sauce were superb!

But, we didn't know about the disaster waiting for us... Pork Surf n Turf... I dont know about surfing but it was no less tough than hockey... the pork was really bad and not at all cooked well... I didn't even have a bite of it... Quite demoralising!

Well, I would've discouraged everyone to visit here unless their signature Fish Oranzzy uplifted our mood!

So in a summary, from me... A mixed response to this place from me!
But definitely not a place to visit twice....

Silver Platter was on my wish list for quite sometime now and after my visit to this place on Christmas eve¬† , i can genuinely vouch for the 4.8 rating this gem of a restaurant has amassed! 
The restaurant is quite easy to locate and it is at a walking distance from acropolis mall, more precisely just beside the Kasba KFC. 

Now you might find that this place is a little cramped up for space but the simple decor and interiors, the aquariums placed beside the tables kind of elevates the dining experience all together . 

On entering this place, the two of us helped ourselves in finding the table and approximately 5-6 minutes had passed by since the staff realized that there were customers whom they had forgotten to attend but this small glitch was made up during the course of the dinning experience since they made quite an effort in constantly inquiring about the food and also catered to our queries regarding the menu so no complaints about the service at the end of the day!

Now coming to the food, the restaurant doesn't compromise on the food quality and quantity given the fact that the prices are so reasonable. What we ordered:

1. Bacon wrapped prawns- A signature dish of this restaurant, this dish is ideally what you should order as a starter!. Tender, juicy, this dish satiated my long craving for bacon wrapped prawns . A must Try!

2. Lemon chicken Skewers- Priced at 150, two skewers, bombarded, with chicken, onions,tomatoes,mushrooms and capsicum and the lemon coating was enough to woo us!

3. Minced lamb ragu- One of the best lamb dishes that i have had for a long time!,this dish was more than enough to fill one stomach ! A pinch of butter added to the rice, the lamb which looks like a curry to the naked eye leaves you craving for more in the end.

4. Grilled chicken in BBQ sauce-¬† Two wholesome pieces of grilled chicken, topped with bbq sauce accompanied by mashed potatoes and veggies was enough for us to conclude on the credibility of the dish in terms of taste, preparation, quality and quantity. 

And the best part is yet to come, they are offering a 15% discount and our bill has amounted to RS 930 only! Quite pocket friendly in terms of our order! Christmas eve well spent is all i could come up with!

This was our 2nd visit to this restaurant. The food was very good and filling. We tried Chicken A la Kiev, chicken strganoff, Chicken sausage in bbq sauce, non veg platter. For snacks we had pepper garlic chicken and drumsticks.

All that we tried are really good. Recommended dish Chicken A La Kiev.

The only thing missing is a 'bigger' feeling ambiance. Adding 'service charge' of 5% (not service tax) could be avoided.

A great addition to the ever expanding food business in Kolkata. The continental dishes are the most desired for at this place. So that is what we ordered. And yes....they did live upto the good reputation that they have got in a short while. The service was very pleasing. The ambience was good. Although the restaurant is very unassuming from the outside, but on the inside it presents a very cosy ambience. One thing worth mentioning is that the prices are surprisingly reasonable when compared to the quantity and the quality of food that is served on the table. This was somewhat of a pleasant surprise. The food was really delectable and enjoyable and the presentation of each was done very aesthetically. Nice place and a must visit for all. Hope that they go a long way. Thank you and Merry Christmas to all.

Undoubtedly the best continental you can treat yourself to in this part of the city. A high rating on Zomato almost made it mandatory to visit this gem of a place at Kasba. A picturesque decor with exotic aquariums and soporific ambience, Silver Platter is indeed a foodie's paradise. Chicken a la Kiev, Sausage in bbq sauce, Tempura Prawn;it was all perfect and extremely appetizing. Enthralled by the starters, went for Lasagna, a classic cheesy continental dish, Grilled chicken breast in bbq sauce, Chicken stroganoff and Hunan chicken. 
It was perhaps the best meal I've had in a long long time. Courteous staff and efficient service made the experience really wonderful.

A very small yet well designed outlet for food lovers. Reasonably priced. Ordered pepper prawns, mozzarella cheese sticks, pork chops and grilled chicken with white sauce. The food was superb. The service was homely. However, a lot of items mentioned in the menu were not available. We couldn't order bacon wrapped prawn, chilly pork, hot chocolate brownie or even brownie with ice cream. This was an utter disappointment, considering that we visited the place on a Saturday afternoon. This place is definitely worth the money for food lovers. However, if you have a specific list of items in mind, I would suggest you calling them up before you decide to hop in.

Named silver, tasted gold...
Well, it came as a surprise from her... and I must say, it couldn't have been better... Being a wildlife lover, as soon as I stepped into this restaurant, what drew all my attention was the beautiful and unique ambience, made of lots of black water aquariums... my attention was there all the time...
Now, let's come to food...
We had ordered fresh lime soda, day at the beach, fish orenzzy, veg fried rice, chilly chicken and caramalized banana...
Each and every item (except the banana) was just excellent... I've never been a fan of continental foods but the fish orenzzy they made had just made me a fan of their continental dishes... It was THE BEST of all the items we had ordered... fried rice chilly chicken and the moctails were also totally upto the mark...
Lastly, a bit disappointed with the dessert, it could have been much better I think... (though the other foods totally overshadowed this disappointment)...
Overall, Silver Platter, your name has been writen in gold in the food court of my heart... ^_^

Silver platter.. located at Kasba.. few minutes walk from the Acropolis mall.. next to the HDFC Bank.. is a hidden gem!
We visited silver platter for lunch .. and we were greatly satisfied by their hospitality and food quality.
This was in my wish list since a long time..
Ambience is simple.. with two huge fish aquarium surrounding on the walls.. 8 to 10 tables.. of 6people per table sitting arrangements.
This place .. has its biggest USP with its Delicious affordable good food.. that draws the attention of foodies!
Their mocktails were amazing.. I had virgin mojito which was made perfectly .. every sip of it was nice ..
Sister in arms was another beautifully made drink.. with a great presentation..
Misty magic was my favorite
Appetizers that we tried were pepper garlic chicken .. tempura prawn semolina crusted calamari were the most outstanding starters we had.. quantity was enough for 4 people to have sufficiently.
In the main course we tried Chicken stroganoff.. which was lovely served on a platter with some rice, garlic bread and mashed potatoes.
Tortilla Chicken lasagne was the most favourite main course perfectly baked....Which I loved and gonna have a second visit for this item. .

Grilled prawns was another show stealer.. I'm a die hard prawn eater . And this item was perfectly cooked and beautifully presented!

Their food were phenomenal in terms of taste .. quality and quantity!

I was lucky enough to be part of the Food Blogger meet last week. #Foodzpah took great initiative to bring all foodies together and I was overwhelmed with the future initiatives they will take. This restaurant is located just few meters away from Acropolis mall. A great location is always a plus point for a restaurant. Ambiance is plain and simple & the place is neither big. So, not for a dating occasion. We were served with mocktails first like Virgin mojito, misty magic. I liked both of them. Virgin mojito was excellent, not ordinary nimbu pani like what you get at many place in the name of Mojito.
Appetizers: we were served with huge variety of items which included pork,chicken,sea food etc. Though I am not much of sea food lover and don't have prawn and pork so I missed on many. But other foodies mentioned they were finger licking. I loved pepper garlic chicken and crusted calamari.
Main course: I was in love with chicken stroganoff. Other item which looked yummy too was pork chops but sadly I can't taste it.there was lasagne too which was perfectly baked.
I missed on desert but I heard it was heavenly.it was fruit fantasy. 
All the dishes were presented like a 5 star hotel. Also, the quantity which was served is huge. This place is not for dating where you can enjoy ambiance and eat ordinary food at extraordinary price. But this place is for foodie like who loves to eat good food at affordable rates and excellent service. I hope they keep up with the good work. If you love sea food and continental food than this the place to hit nearbuy kasba. A great competitor for Santa's fantasea is here. 
Thanks #foodzpah for inviting.

Went there yesterday. The place is close to my office and not that well known in the vicinity, so I skipped it till now thinking that it's just another road side outlet. However, I was amazed to find out the reviews that it got here. So checked it out. The only negative about this place is the space, which is a bit congested. The food is delicious and service is wonderful.

We couldn't get bacon wrapped prawns (much famed) due to unavailability of bacon, so we ordered tempura prawns instead. They are a bit bland for those who like spicy. Nevertheless, they were delicious. Then we had chilly squids which were amazing. We also ordered grilled chicken breast in pepper sauce. The serving quantity was sufficient for 2 and it was juiciest continental preparation that I had till now.

In mocktails, bartender convinced me to have "sister in arms", and then it turned out to be superb. The taste of it grows on your taste buds, starting from sweet to tangy.

Would definitely love to visit again.

Location :
- Kasba Near Hdfc bank, beside Kfc.  
Place /Ambiance : 
-Place is quite well maintained and has abundant  space.  
Food :
- This is by far one the better Place to visit for any foodie.  On a high note if you want to try out pork for the 1st time this is the place. 
Chilly Pork- is rich and fit for the king.  
Crispy chilli squid- is equally juicy and tasty served with mayonese.  
Club Sandwich - is a suitable choice depending on the quality and is served with ketchup and French Fries.  
Overall this is one of the must visit place for seafood and continental lovers.

Though it appears that they have very recently started the restraunt(as menu is on printed sheets on a clipboard), it hardly looks anything like a juvenile. 
Place is good, ambience is awesome but the food(actually the chef) is the real star. It looks like they are still experimenting with their menu, but whatever they present you on the plate will undoubtedly be good. If you go there, do try their spaghetti lamb bolognese...

There's no word to explain how delicious the food here is. I have never given a 5 before, and this place deserves it. At such prices, their continental is the best in class.
Ambiance(10/10): Small but Gorgeous
Service(9.5): Fast, interactive and helpful.

Mocktails like Sister in arms, Pink Rose and Blue Apple will blow your mind away(9.5/10). Accurate in sweetness and creativity.
Virgin Mojito(10/10): This was my favorite drink!

*Starters*
‚òÖChilli Pork(9.5/10): Very well cooked and the flavors of the meat with the ingredients makes this palatable.
‚ú©Semolina Crusted Calamari(10/10): This is served with mayo and tastes wondrous too. Kudos to presentation.
‚òÖBacon Wrapped Prawn(10/10): I've had this combination for the first time and can swear, this won't disappoint you. Many restos cook prawn but it still retains a smell, here it's negligible and when mixed with bacon, SLURP!
‚ú©Pepper Garlic Chicken(9.5/10): By just the look of it, your hunger will double, with your first bite, its cloud9.

*Main Course*
‚òÖChicken Stroganoff(10/10): This is a wholesome meal, but we shared. Served with rice, salad and mashed potatoes this is a mist try on your next visit.

‚ú©Pork Chops(10/10): A huge piece of pork can easily be shared by two if several options are taken. One word, "Palatable".
‚òÖTortilla Chicken Lasagna(9.5/10): I heard this was invented by the owner himself and its brilliant and this serves 4 easily(even more if varieties are ordered).

‚ú©Minced Lamb Ragu(8/10): This is the lowest rating since I found the lamb a bit more on sweetness. Served as same as stroganoff.
‚òÖGrilled Prawn(9.5/10): Yum Yum Yum! Prawns are a demigod here.

Fruit Fantasy: Vanilla Ice Cream scoop with chocolate syrup, served on fruits. Nice!

Last Wednesday , I went to the Silver Platter on Rajdanga Nabapally road for lunch with a few friends, you can give it a blink and miss on the busy road dotted all the way with a variety of restaurants,but trust me the fare it has on offer ,makes it pretty much unmissable. The mocktails we were served were refreshing and went perfectly with our lunch menu. The Silver Platter runs a wee bit low on ambience and space but the food they serve makes up for everything else. We had pepper garlic chicken,semolina crusted calamari,tempura prawns for starters and each one of them was equally good made with fresh ingredients and seasoned perfectly. For the mains we ordered their much talked about lamb ragu,chicken stroganoff and tortilla chicken lasagna.I would give a thumbs up to each of these dishes. The creamy chicken stroganoff and cheesy tortilla chicken lasagna left me asking for more,it is undoubtedly one of the best dishes on their menu. Very few restaurants give you value for money when it comes to continental cuisine,the Silver Platter is an exception to this,it not only gives you great continental/seafood at jaw dropping prices but a satisfaction of knowing that you chose well. Can't wait to dig in at the Silver Platter again.

Delicious food with great presentation and great service,Silver Platter will surely impress you on the first visit itself. I had gone for lunch with a big group of friends on Wednesday. We had a variety of continental and seafood dishes which left us very full and totally content.
Mocktails: Virgin Mojito, Sister in Arms, Blue Apple and Misty Magic. All of them looked good with different colour combinations in the same mocktail. My favourite was the Virgin Mojito.
Appetizers: Pepper Garlic Chicken, Chilli Pork, Semolina crusted Calamari, Bacon Wrapped Prawns,Tempura Prawns. The pork was totally amazing!!! Crunchy and oh so tastyüòçüòç we were literally fighting for this dish üòÇ. The chicken starter was good too. I had calamari for the first time and loved this deep fried version. Gave the prawns a miss as I am allergic to them.
Main course: Chicken Stroganoff, Minced Lamb Ragu, Pork Chops, Grilled Prawns, Tortilla Chicken Lasagne. All the dishes apart from the lasagne were served with a portion of herb rice,garlic bread and mashed potatoes. The portion was quite large and will easily fill one person's stomach to the brim. All the three types of proteins were very well cooked which was evident from its softness and it's yummy taste. The lasagne was cooked with tortilla instead of pasta sheets,making it a healthier version of the dish. My favourite of the lot was the lamb RaguüòÉüòÉ. 
Dessert: Fruit Fantasy. This was an ice cream sundae consisting of vanilla ice cream and various fruits, drizzled with chocolate sauce. This was quite a good option for a dessert and everybody finished it up in a jiffy.
A giant thumbs up to Silver Platter for the standard of the food and the hospitality. Gonna visit again!!

Silver platter , a great place to dine in is conveniently located close to Acropolis mall Kasba. The interior is adorned with aquarium , which is quiet a mood booster. The blue lagoon they serve is really amazing as the ingredients are well balanced. Grilled chicken breast in bbq sauce is good which is well cooked and beautifully served. Staffs are cordial enough. Sadly, the most coveted pork chops are currently unavailable due to some supply bottlenecks. Hope they'll be available soon. Overall, a highly recommended food joint.

A quaint little place situated near my house is mainly known for it's continental dishes though it serves some lip smacking chinese dishes too. What will strike you when you first enter this restaurant is its pretty decor ... Now coming to the food I have tried out many of their dishes and none of the dishes failed to satisfy my taste buds.. Service is good and the place is quite pocket friendly too. Higly recommended!

The simple reason I gave this joint a whopping 5 is because of its food food and food. Overlook the small interior and walk in for an array of mind blowing continental and seafood. If they are able to keep up this amazing standard of food quality and cooking... I am certain in no time they will be looking for a bigger space. The various mock tails were innovative. The lamb chops were well done. The star of the show was the bacon wrapped prawns with the bacon having just the correct smoky flavour and the prawns fresh. The calamari rings are also worth a try as they were absolutely fresh. Chicken stroganoff is definitely recommended.

A lovely place, a slight cafe type, for a typical mouth-leaking continental delicacy. Have been to this place more than a time.. Truly a pocket friendly restaurant. Ambiance is cosy.. Well decorated.. Staffs are too friendly and courteous..
Coming to the food..in a Word..just amazing.. The continental dishes specially Chicken Ala Kiev is nothing less than that is served in a 5-star restaurant..
Dishes are perfectly cooked..

Sorry to change the review, but this restaurant has been subject to a change of quality for worse. Pasta was not that bad, but apart from it: the Chinese dishes were very very disappointing, absolute wastage of money. Mentioning the quality of fish, it was just not edible, the worst you can think off.

Great food with reasonable price. Loved the Grilled Chicken Breast :) A small restaurant yet the d√©cor is pretty cool with aquarium on two sides. Will surely visit this restaurant again

Silver Platter is a small restaurant which opened it's doors around 7 months ago. It has a seating capacity of 20-24 people, most probably. Though the place is small, the decor is well planned and very pretty. There are two rows of aquariums which are beautiful enough to catch everyone's attention! The staff members are humble and soft spoken too. An overall well maintained eatery.
The menu looked promising and the positive reviews on zomato, urged us to try this place out.
We ordered the following items as a takeaway :

1)Chicken and Mayo Salad @Rs.99.00, 4.5/5 : (Sufficient for 1) This has to be one of my favourite salads! You can really never go wrong with chicken and a good quality mayonnaise. This salad was made up of perfectly grilled chicken, green peppers, iceberg lettuce and granny smith apples. The sweet and sour tinge of the apples went really well with the salad. Perfectly seasoned and well garnished. A must try!

2) Grilled Fish in Lemon Butter Sauce @Rs.249.00, 4/5 : (Sufficient for 2) 4 Fillets of fresh basa were grilled to perfection and served with a delicious sauce of lemon, butter and garlic. Delicious medley of flavours in every mouthful.

3)Grilled Pork Chops @Rs.285.00, 3.85/5 : (Sufficient for 2) They had already asked us if we wanted fat or lean meat and we obviously wanted the best of both worlds.üòù
What we got was a huge rib of fat and meat and a smalled slob of lean meat. The garlic sauce was slightly sweet and finger licking good!

4)Chicken Stroganoff @Rs.225.00, 3.75/5 : (Sufficient for 1) We ordered for the brown sauce. Well cooked chicken pieces with mushrooms were mixed in a delicious sauce. The sauce had hints if thyme but can be a bit too powering for people not acquainted with the taste.

All the main course dishes were accompanied by either Garlic breads or Buttered rice accompanied by mashed potatoes and sa√∫ted vegetables. The garlic breads were very good and were well toasted (4/5). The buttered rice was pretty normal to taste (3.5/5). The mashed potatoes were one of the better ones I have had in Kolkata! Creamy and buttery! So good (4.5/5). The sa√∫ted vegetables retained their crunch and were very buttery (4/5).

The total bill came upto Rs.901.00 (Rs.858.00 + 5% Service charge of Rs.42.90) for 3 which is quite reasonable.

Recommended.‚úåüèª
Happy eating.üòäüòä

Was hearing about this amazing place for a very long time and finally got to visit it last Sunday. A small, but airy and comfortable restaurant with mesmerising decor. That moment of glee when when you enter and find aquariums adorning both the walls of the restaurant. Located at kasba, near hdfc ¬†bank, the restaurant serves continental and chinese food. The grilled fish with mustard sauce and Chicken breast in bbq sauce require special mention. The fish was very tender and fresh. We also tried the veg fried rice which was nice and the schezuan fish which was perfectly made. The chicken lollipop and the lemon chciken skewers fulfilled their role as good starters. The staff is cooperative and service is moderately quick. Would love to go back to taste the sea food items.

Located a few metres away from Acropolis in Kasba.
The staff, the decor, the food all are extremely nice.

Huge aquariums covers up the whole dining area. That feel is quite nice, I mean not everyday you get to eat with fishes around you. The place has been well maintained.

The menu ranges from chinese to continental and seafood and at reasonable rates.
We ordered:
Veg Hakka Noodles- decent.
Pepper Garlic Chicken- delicious. 6 pieces of amazingly done chicken.
Fresh lime soda- good.

On the second visit we had the following dishes and honestly, each were delicious!
1. Chilli Pork- loved it absolutely.
2. Semolina Crusted Calamari- üòç
3. Bacon Wrapped Prawn- no matter how much you have this one, you cannot get enough of it. 
For main course we had,
Chicken Stroganoff- my favourite dish of the day.
Minced Lamb Ragu, Grilled Prawn were good.
Tortilla Chicken Lasagne was new to the menu and amazing it was. Much different from what you get elsewhere.
Pork chops- now this being the signature dish of Silver Platter is a must try!
Apart from this, their mocktails were so well made. Sister in arms, Blue apple and Pink rose.
And even after all that, we managed to have place for desserts. Fruit Fantasy was worth the wait. 

Silver Platter is doing an excellent job in terms of the food alone. 

The menu is inclusive of taxes, just 5% service charge extra. They were giving 15% discount on the bill as well, till 31st december though.
Do visit this place if you already haven't. Sure to have a great experience. :)

After reading so many rave reviews , it was an obvious choice to try Silver platter . But, this time my expectation was not met with proper justice . If you look at the reviews at this place , you will hardly see a review not been a 4 pointer . My experience was a tad lesser than that ultimately not bad at all but i expected to be a biggie . And therefore i depict as to why it was not another 4 or 5 star foodie experience .

¬∞ Location :- Aptly situated on the main road of kasba I.e the Rajdanga Nabapally road . If you are coming from Ruby then you just have to cross the Acropolis mall and the restaurant will be located on the side of the mall I.e the right hand side . If you are coming from gariahat then you just have to stop a few blocks before the acropolis mall , the restaurant will be located on your left .

¬∞ Ambience & Service ( 3.5  / 5 ) :- Well, not at all a fining dining experience but will do enough for the foodies who donot care much about the ambience . There are mainly 4 seaters with aquarium surrounding the walls . I was not really pleased with the service because mostly the lamb items were not available . It was kinda disappointing as it was a Saturday night and was expecting to get all the dishes . The staff seemed less trained but he still did the job . 

------------------------------

¬∞ Food :- Let's get into the main event . About the food I would not say that it was an overwhelming experience which actually I was expecting due to the ratings . It was more of a decent one . We ordered :- 

1. Crispy chilli squid ( 4 / 5 ) :- Now this is a good starter . Decent amount of squid stir fried in veggies and chilli sauce , this is the best starter you can get . The squid are as specified in the earlier reviews crispy on the outside and soft in the inside . Although , they seemed really tiny in size we were satisfied overall . A recommended dish .

2. Fish Oranzy ( 4 / 5 ) :- Once again this is a likeable dish . I liked their version of grilled fish . There are a huge number of grilled fish dishes all around using basa fillets and some particular sauce . Basa being almost tasteless it goes well with a lot of sauces and sweet ones too . The fish fillets with orange chilli sauce was a bless . The presentation was good too . If you look at the pics please know that the top part are the fish fillets and the base of the dish contains a lot of mashed potatoes . So, there are 4 medium square shaped fish fillets . It will not be that wholesome but it's a delightful one . Recommended .

Now , to be very Frank after this we wanted to have their minced lamb raghu but unfortunately it was not available to our dissapontment . So, we decided to try out their Chinese offerings and went for :- 

3. Mixed gravy noodles ( 3 / 5 ) :- As we were 2 person , we asked them to divide the dish and then serve us . When we received the dish we found out that the quantity of the dish was wholesome but the amount of chicken and prawn was negligible . It felt like more of a veg dish . On asking them about this matter they said that this happened on account of the dish being divided but I didnot but that because the overall amount of chicken and prawns were really really less . Nevertheless the flavor was good and we still felt like a decent dish and hence the 3 points . But I will not recommend this . Unless, the improve on my point .

4. Fruit Fantasy ( 2 / 5 ) :- This is the part I was really really pissed off . I donot normally go for deserts becayse in most of the restaurants they are make shift items with no intention of quality and charging them all between the range of 100 - 150 . This time we decided to have one and when they said that this is their signature dish I went for it without even thinking of what could I possible get . What I got was a cocktail glass filled with watermelon and papaya cubes covered in mint leaves and a single scoop of ice cream on the top . That's it , and thereafter my fruit Fantasy ended in a second.  A better suggestion would be to include more fruits and syrups on top of them because currently if anyone is praising this dish is either lying or have absolutely no taste in food .
----------------------------------

¬∞ Verdict :- Yes I will recommend this restaurant because honestly it has a lot of potential . I can say that because my experience started as a 4 star and somehow due to the lack of availability of some dish fall flat on the face . But still I took some good experience and I think following are the best points :- 

1. Good squid starter .
2. Proper and different grilled fish item in their orange sauce .
3. They provide 15‚ÑÖ discount minus the 5‚ÑÖ service charge so a 10‚ÑÖ discount on the bill which is a humble thing and we loved it .

The restaurant had an immense potential . A little bit of more effort and some more imagination in the dishes can really make this place a top destination of Kasba . My best wishes for them .

I heard a lot about this restaurant. I went there with so much curiosity with my friends.¬†
We had there Fried Calamari, Fish Oranzy and grilled chicken with the base of smashed potato and american corn. Food was good but no need to be over-hyped.
Staff behavior was good but they need to improve to show their professionalism.
Ambiance was okay. One good thing, i was attracted about, was three aquariums in the wall. That was nice.
But one of the main drawback, they don't have any washroom.¬†
It's a basically pocket friendly restaurant with okay/good foods.

Surprise does not come in big boxes, it comes in the small box. This restaurant just reminded me this line again. 

In the wishlist from long back, atlst we were there with lots of expectations, which offcorse built by the zomato reviews.

‚àö Location:
From ruby towards acropolis mall, crossing the mall go some more distance, u will find HDFC Bank on the right hand side, it is located just beside that.

‚àö Ambience:
It's average. Very small joint, just 8 tables to be sitted. Not impressive at all.

Now, upto this, you will not find anything special. But wait, the main thing is yet to come, food segment.

¬© Starters:
----------------------
¬Æ Chili garlic fish: very good in taste. Fish was very soft and the garlic taste was just appropriate.

¬Æ Chili pork : honesty speaking had a lot of expectations. But a little disappointed. It was good, but I had far better chili pork earlier.

¬Æ  Crispy chili squid: owsum one. It was just perfectly cooked. The squid was crips outside, but inside the soft texture was there.

¬© Main Course:
------------------------------

In the main course we had both chinise and continental. Lets start with one by one.
‚àÜ chinise
------------------
¬Æ  Mixed Hakka chowmin : good one. Nothing special about it. Decent in taste.

¬Æ Garlic chili fish: it was just too good in taste, the chili garlic gravy is just mouth watering.

‚àÜ continental
------------------------
They have their excellence in this one. Just beyond owssum.

¬Æ Fish orangy: when bhetki fish come with a specular combo with layer of capsicum, orange with smashed potato. And the fish , it was just juicy and soft.  The orange sauce with it was just a bonanza. Trust me, if you are not a continental lover also, you will also fall in love with it.

¬Æ minced lamb raghu : ahhaa, excellent one. Shredded lamb comes with garlic bread and small cup of rice and with veggies. And the fish taste just owsum.

¬Æ Grilled chicken breast: they have three choice of soft, we tried the BBQ sauce. They two pieces of chicken with smashed potato and veggies was just yummy. It's taste that good. Perfectly cooked with the sauce.

¬Æ Chicken a la kive : I found it just terrific. Owsum in taste. With smashed potato, veggies and garlic bread. It was just a treat to have it. The melted butter and chicken was just properly blended.

¬© Beverages
--------------------------

¬Æ Capachino : they served the nescaffe one. Very good.
¬Æ Litchi mojhito : good one, litchi punch with the tulsi leaf.
¬Æ Cinderella: I found it not good at all.
¬Æ Cupid fantasy : I found it best in all. Very refreshing.
¬Æ Shirley temple: nice one.

Please note : all the beverages I found good or okay type. None of these are excellent. May be on summer day it could have taste better.

¬© Desert:
-------------------
¬Æ Fruit fantasy: this one is just owssum. Fruit with honey syrup and ice cream. Just superb.

Items were not available: baked soaked prawn, pork chops. So, a little disappointed.

Service was nice. Could have been better though. So, I thought to give it a 4.0 rating. But let's conclude with some genuine fact.
This joint is small, but trust me if you don't go by the space and sitting arrangement of this restaurant. This offers one of the best continental in town.

And what attracts me more the pocket friendly things.
5 people with total stomach full, billed just 2900 INR.
So, what can you ask more.

To the management:
------------------------------------
 your continental are excellent. But mocktail could have been far better. But yes it's great to be there. Keep up the good work. Hope while visiting for the next time I will find the other items per excellent also.

To all: you can not get such excellent continental in just pocket friendly cost. :)


0.5 extra for the excellent quality of continental in such owsum price.


And yes, sometimes silver is even more precious than gold :)

It is definitely one of the best chinese restaurants in the town. We visited silver platter for lunch and was greatly satisfied by their hospitality and food quality.¬†

We tried their egg fried rice and garlic fish and both of them were too good. The fish was very soft and light and so was the rice.

Hospitality and service were ¬†really good. The ambiance was fine .

The best part is we got 15% cashback on using debit card for payment.

It is definitely worth visiting again.

Everyone has that one restaurant that they are almost a regular too. You know the names of almost all the servers there, the owner (whether you know their name or not) waves at you from behind the desk and greets you at the table. More or less, you are a known face there. Silver platter is one of those restaurants for me. Over the past year, I have dropped into this place over a number of weekends to gorge on their delicious continental spread, but have never managed to try the Chinese. This time determined to do so, I stepped into Silver Platter on a weekday for dinner.

We straight away asked for suggestions on what to order from the Chinese menu while settling in. We were advised to try the Pepper Garlic Fish and the Salt and Pepper Prawn, but we also went along and ordered the Hot Garlic chicken. The appetizers have a refined taste to them. The best part is you can taste all the major ingredients, such as the garlic, the soy, the veggies and the protein is not over cooked either. Both the fish and the prawn are ‚Äúmelt in the mouth‚Äù and surprisingly the chicken walks on the same line. 

Thoroughly impressed with the first course, we went forward and ordered mains. Burnt Garlic Fried rice, Chilli Garlic Mix Noodles, Chilli Fish and Schezwan Prawns were our choices of mains for the evening. Silver Platter has come to be recognised for its flare of sea food and the quality of the same is indisputable. Both the fish and the prawn dishes were heavily satisfying. The smokiness in the gravies, contrasted with the brittle-like crispy texture on the deep fried seafood tossed in it is sheer bliss.

¬†While we went on with our mains, my usual cravings kicked in very hard and I settled at ordering additional plates of my favourite Lamb Ragu and Fish Oranzzy. If the Chinese rated itself at a 4, the continental spread is nothing less than a 5. I can go back to Silver Platter again and again for just these two things. No, make it three things; the Fruit Fantasy is unmissable too. With a happy tummy and a happier pocket, I am keen on returning soon.

We ordered Non-Veg platter for two. Food was good enough. But the quantity not amused me at all. The noodle soup was good enough. Overall average experience.

The interiors of this place are too good. You literally start feeling a little luxurious once you step in.
The menu card has a price which is written including all taxes. This is something which amuses me about a place even more. I don‚Äôt have to constantly worry about what the bill is going to be and can eat in peace.
The staff here are nice and give you nice suggestions. Must try 'Chicken Ala Kiev' which was suggested to me and I really found it nice. Awesome quality of food and service.
Would definitely come for a second visit.

Located just beside the HDFC Bank on the Rajdanga Road, though the place is bit stuffy but i like their taste for continental food - recommended by one of my colleague. Visited on Diwali afternoon for lunch. Ordered chilli pork as starter and a fish item for take away. Both the items tasted delicious. Rates are very reasonable with friendly staffs and instant service. 

One suggestion - They should cover the wash basin area as well as prevent the soiled plates to remove the dumped on the table right in front of dinning area which is very uncomfortable for the guests to have food.

They do have 15% cashback facility if you use HDFC Bank Debit/Credit card.

One hell of a dissapointing place. Had their chelo kebab and squid preparations. Its decent. But wait !!! You call them to place an order and the reply you get is sir, the kebab person is on leave.
Sincere advise to you all is, just shove up the 'platter' which by no means is silver up your, well wherever you wana.
Try these bunch only to be left disgusted with their replies.

Coming to what we ate here , let me reveal the best first, we had PEPPER GARLIC CHICKEN for starters (small quantity 6-7 small cubes of chicken) followed by MIXED LAMB RAGU , GRILLED CHICKEN BREAST IN PEPPER SAUCE, FISH ORANZY , GRILLED SAUSAGES IN BARBECUE SAUCE. Each one was phenominal in terms of taste quality and portion. The maincourses came with combinations of mashed potato , mayo salad , garlic bread , herb rice and grilled vegetables . out of these , the cucumber in the salad tasted bitter , garlic bread were not crisp and lacked the garlic punch , but the rest were amazing ,be the meat fish or the pepper barbq orange sauces all were simply great. For dessert i ordered one FRUIT FANTASY expecting something like the conventional truti fruti , cubes of mixed fruits mainly water melon with drizzle of some sryup topped with two scoops of vanilla ice cream, none of us liked it and had to leave it half unconsumed.i would not recommend this dessert.

now the negetives , The entrance seemed shabby as well as the ambience was not likeable by any of us , the interiors are done giving an oceanic theme with large aquariums and very small number of tiny fishes , the walls the ceiling the lanterns the chairs nothing matching one another and i would say it i have seen even smaller joints with much much decent and cozy set up. After the first glance , we actually wanted to leave for some other place . Then , NO WASHROOM . my friends had walk upto acropolis for loo. they didnot have any menu card , a special MENU CAME AS XEROX SHEET OF PAPERS ASSEMBLED USING AN EXAM BOARD. this is substandard. i would not raise any issue if the prices were very low , people come here for cheap dining , but when you pay 300-400 per dish and you see they dont even bother to present a laminated menu card , washroom facility is unavailable , decor is not impressive at all , the value for money factor will disappoint you. With only service charge of 5% and no vat till now and an additional discount of 15% we spent almost 500 per pax but my companions were of opinion that they would anyday prefer steak factory , roast , my big fat belly etc for overall better dining experience in this budget .
We came to check this place out seeing the massive 4.4 rating on zomato and reviewers bragging about good food in lower pricing , although the chinese section is priced very low , the hike in continental dishes and the limited menu (not the one i checked on their fb page) dissapointed me for sure.

Adding to that , presentation can be improved and printed cutlery we are used to seeing in home usage dinner sets (the one fish oranzy got served) spoils the ganishing.

so here goes the rating
food 4.5/5
ambience 2/5
service 3.5/5
vfm 3/5

This restaurant was on our bucket list for quite a long time. Atlast able to visit this joint today. Initial impression was not that impressive. The place is small with mediocre interiors. We ordered lemon chicken skewers as starter, grilled chicken breast in white sauce & bar-b-que sauce and fish oranzzy in main course. And with the food, our initial impression turned into like "WOW" !!! Lemon chicken was good and the main courses were  just awesome. We intially ordered only grilled chicken with white sauce. The dish turned out to be so good that we ordered another variant in bar-b-que sauce. The fish orranzy is their signature dish which is a must try.
Special mention for the staff behaviour. Very very cordial.. Will definately try this restaurant in near future..

I went here for lunch recently attracted by the comparatively low prices and high ratings and was surprised that I've never heard of it before! The place is small but the seating is comfortable and the interior is pretty and has lots of aquariums.
Now coming to the food, we had dry chili chicken and crispy chili squid for starters; grilled chicken breast in barbecue sauce, chicken stroganoff ¬†in white sauce, and grilled fish in creamy mustard sauce for main course; and caramelized banana with vanilla ice cream for dessert. Each and every dish was simply amazing (be it texture, softness, taste or consistency wise), some a little more than the others. Even the coleslaw, mashed potatoes, garlic bread and (I can't believe that I'm saying this but even the) sauteed vegetables were delicious and we licked our plates clean. The fish could have been a little better, but I can't say that I was disappointed. The only reason, I'm not giving them 5/5 is because some of the items on the menu, like kebabs and brownies were not available.
The prices are also quite low compared to other places which serve similar cuisine and all the prices were inclusive of taxes. The staff was very helpful and eagerly took feedback. It's a must try for every foodie.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION : Kasba area has some very fine places in forms of Cafe, food courts as well as Restaurants. At this point you just don't need to go anywhere if you are hungry in the way. Well known place and well known food has a vast difference between them. The place must be lavish but the food is not good then its not worth the money. Whereas if the Food is outstanding then the hungries will never judge the place with its food. Just like that Silver Platter at Kasba just near to KFC is one of them who talks with their food rather than other displayable objects. They deal in Continental, Seafood, Kebab but now they have come up with authentic Chinese too in their menu effective from this Durga Puja.

AMBIANCE AND STAFF : Ambiance is not too big but its classy. Earlier they had quite small sitting with only 4 tables and now they have extended it to i guess 6. The interior remains the same with aquarium on the both side of the walls and Mocktails section is straight down the restro. ¬†It is said "Big explosions take place in small Dynamites". The black t shirt guys and girls in the restro are doing some outstanding work. Keeping their eyes and ears open and listening to you with all dedication.¬†

FOOD: A visit here with friends turned out to be quite a surprise for me as this was my first try to this very place which has opened quite some time ago. The meal started with round of Mocktails we ordered.¬†
Pink rose as well as virgin Mojito were the two drinks we took first and trust me they were made above the standards. Refreshing and fizzy as well as milky too with the pink rose doing extremely well. Later we decided to get the Shirley temple also as we loved the former two drinks. That also didn't let us down.

Then come the starters and we tried some Chinese stuff which ¬†were recently added in the menu along with some Continental Deliciousness.¬†
Dry chilli Chicken was the first one i tried which done extremely well to make me happy. Then came the Pepper Garlic fish. This was another semi gravy item that we ordered here,It contained good amount of veggies with the semi gravy rounded off on the fish. Juicy and tasty with the touch of chilli and pepper.¬†
Salt and Pepper Prawn was crispy and juicy inside. The preparation and presentation was spot on.

Moving ahead with the Main courses so we had Burnt Garlic Mixed Fried Rice with Chilli Fish and Schewan Prawn. Rice did a fair decent job with the chilli fish and even going well with the szechan prawn. Later we decided to get the ¬†Mix noodles too which was way spicy in the attire which kept us quite interested. ¬†
Special mention to FISH ORANZY which is a Signature dish here. A whole great taste of Continental flavor in the Bhetki fish which is been presented and made with such a great passion. Truly Delicate and bang on with the taste. Recommended.
I have a fantasy of Ice creams so we Finished the Meal with Fruit Fantasy which was very colorful and divine looking. Good numbers of fruits inside with vanilla ice cream over it,

QNQ AND PRICES: Quality of dishes has been outstanding with the kind of raw materials they are using and quantity is fine too. Prices are pocket Friendly.

CONCLUSION: The kind of food and service which we got here was truly commendable. Kudos to the team and special Thanks to Mr. Kaushik who advised us about what we can have in the menu and managed everything exceptionally well. Cheers.

after getting such good reviews about the resto...went with my sister for a casual dinner ...ordered pork chops and some mocktails...really speaking after putting one piece of the meat ...it got rolled over in the mouth...cutting one piece of meat was like hell...it was totally undercooked ....called the waitress and told so...she replied ...it cant b recooked...and admitted that it was undercooked .....couldnt eat the food and left it over. Though prawn cooktail was ok.

One of the better places to have Continental food, without burning a hole in your pocket. Situated between Nabapally Bus Stand and Acropolis Mall, this is a very small and tiny joint, but dishes out some mouthwatering food at affordable cost. Have dropped in a couple of times and tried multiple dishes till date, among which a special mention must go to Fish Oranzy. Beautifully presented and prepared, this one surely is a stealer. The BBQ Grilled Sausages were good as well, with the tangy and sweet BBQ Sauce, hitting the tastebuds. That being said, there needs to be some improvements as well. The Salsa for the Prawn Tempura, was quite mild and was nowhere near to be a Salsa. The Bacon in the Bacon wrapped Prawns needs some upliftment. The Mocktails (Ice Cream based) needs to be worked upon. Somewhere I felt, that the flavor was not coming out right. The staff here are quite courteous and looks after your need. Do try this place, if you around. :-)

I wanted to save it for one of the best meal I had till date.The Silver platter did not disappoint me.I was accompanied by my bestie Anamitraa Chakraborty who encouraged me throughout this venture of mine and pushed me to do better.

I liked the interiors a lot..the aquariums looked so good and the ceiling was colourful.The owner Kaushik Saha is such a warm and delightful person.He made us feel at home and pampered us with the gastronomic delights Silver platter has to offer.

The mocktails which gave a refreshing start to the great dining experience ahead were

1)Shirley temple-Lovely drink with flavour of pinapple in it.
2)Pink rose-It was like a frothy creamy strawberry shake which was a delight to drink

For the starters we went for oriental dishes that the restaurant has started recently alongside their continental spread.

1)Chilli Pork-I haven't tasted such an amazing pork dish in oriental flavour.The pork had a nice crackling crispness on the outside and tender from within.The spice quotient was spot on.Loved it to the fullest.

2)Pepper garlic fish-Fish was crispy and the sauce it was tossed in had a great flavour.Even the veggies in the dish tasted so good.

For the mains we opted for the continental which is their speciality.

1)Minced lamb ragu-It was served with herb rice,garlic bread and coleslaw.What a genius of a dish this was..so well thought out.The richness of the meat ragu with the herb rice was balanced out by the amazing freshness the coleslaw had.Every component of the dish was so delicious.

2)Fish orangzyy-From the presentation to the taste..this dish marveled us.Soft flaky fish in a tangy citric flavoured sauce.. which carried a punch of flavour without overpowering the delicate subtlety of the fish.The mash served underneath was silky smooth and seasoned perfectly.

For the sweet ending we chose the fruit fantasy.Its a refereshing dessert with loads fresh fruits soaked in syrup and served alongside vanilla icecream.

Lastly I would like to talk about the presentation part.Every mocktail and dish looked picturesque.It was treat to the eyes as well as our tastebuds.

Thanks a lot to Silver platter for making my 200th review such a beautifully memorable experience. üòç

Some of you might be little apprehensive about this place as it looks bit shady from outside. But trust me, once you get inside and start devouring, you will thank yourself for deciding to drop in this place.

Silver Platter interior is decent... aquariums lining the walls and ceilings are colorfully done.¬†
The seating arrangement is basic but comfortable.¬†

The menu offers some interesting choices. We ordered :

Mocktails - Shirley Temple, Sister in Arms, Blue Apple, Pink Rose and Virgin Mojito. All of these were nicely presented. The 1st 3 mocktails tasted decent. Virgin Mojito was good and Pink Rose was my favorite. Try it!

Appetizers - Hot Garlic Chicken : Though it wasn't really "hot" nevertheless it tasted good.¬†
Pepper Garlic Fish : ¬†It was soft and literally melted in the mouth.¬†
Salt & Pepper Prawn : Loved it! Cooked to perfection.
Chilli Pork : I didn't have it but the rest were absolutely delighted with this dish. Pork lovers, try this one.

Main Course - Burnt Garlic Mixed Fried Rice: I was disappointed with this dish as it tasted bland.¬†
Chilli Garlic Mixed Noodles : Looked good. Tasted good.
Chilli Wine Chicken : Little "hatke" preparation. Tasted decent.
Chilli Fish : This dish was good. Could have been little more spicy.
Schezwan Prawn : Again, could have been little more spicy. Tasted good nevertheless.
Minced Lamb Ragu: Deserves a shout-out. Amazing preparation. Served with coleslaw. Do not miss this one.
Fish Oranzzy : Another dish to be listed in your "Must Have" category. Beautifully presented and tasted great. Even the mashed potato served with the fish will not fail to amaze you.

Dessert - Fruit Fantasy : If you want to take a break from the brownies and mousse and cheesecakes, go for this perfect ending to your dining experience. Not sure whether the fruits they serve with ice-cream are fresh or canned but this thing is as refreshing as a dessert could get.

Portions: Good. Price: Reasonable.

Recommended!

Came along with my friend Shreya Bhowmick to celebrate her 200th review. The experience was mindblowing, fantastic in a nutshell.
This is a small place located about 400m before Acropolis Mall on the way from Gariahat to Ruby More, just next to Goli Vada Pav. The owner Kaushik Saha happily greeted us with much warmth and we were extremely delighted with the drinks at first.
Shirley Temple - A very light drink to refresh you up with hints of pineapple.
Pink Rose - More like a Strawberry Shake but a nice one I must say.
Presentation was excellent. Taste was brilliant.
Appetizers -
Chilli Pork - Trust me, I have never had such good pork before. It was crispy from outside and soft inside. Loved the contrast. The sauce was subtle soothing your taste buds properly.
Pepper Garlic Fish - This was really a good one. Loved the crispy bites and also the garnishing and presentation.
Main Course -
After a fantastic Chinese appetizing experience, we went for two of their most signature dishes.
Minced Lamb Ragu - This comes in a platter with herbed rice, the minced lamb ragu along with coleslaw. I am not at all a veggie person but the coleslaw was so fresh that I had a large portion of it. The rice, the meat everything tasted excellent. Highly recommended.
Fish Oranzyy - Oh! You have to try this. This is the best dish at Silver Platter. The presentation is brilliant. White basa seared in an yummy sauce over mashed potato, guarded with three layers of capsicum. Thinking of this while writing is making my mouth water.
Dessert - We were so full after the course that we could hardly eat anything as the portions are pretty commendable. Still, we went for the Fruit Fantasy. That was lovely. Loved every bit of it. Fresh fruits soaked in syrup and served with vanilla ice cream. The dish looked yummy, so did it taste.
The experience was fantastic. Loved the day out and the dinner. Congratulations to Shreya for reaching this milestone. Best wishes to Team Silver Platter. Happy Dining! :)

Small place, big flavours.
Continental is the most happening thing right now. There are numerous restaurants coming up with this particular cuisine. Sliver platter is chique place in kashba. They have amazing food, nice presentation and a very attentive staff.
We took chili pork and chicken skewers for starters. Both of them were okay.
The main dishes, though, were filling , tasty and worth the money. Obviously try the fish orranzy. The chicken ala Kiev and the grilled fish and chicken were lip smacking as well.

The ambiance service and of the restaurant is very good. ¬† We went there on Durgapuja Austomi this year. On that very day entering in any restaurant is a real pain and most of them are giving poor services at the puja time, it was surprising that this restaurant greeted us very well. The behavior of the girl who was taking orders is very homely, she behaved ¬†like a girl next door while suggesting us about the orders. ¬†We went four (two couples) and ordered one prawn wrapped in beacon as starter which was delicious. For main course we took pork chop, grilled chicken ¬†breast, chicken Al a kiev and minced lamb ragu. The pork chop was the best which had been obviously suggested by the waitress. All other dishes are also very delicious. The most significant part is the prices are very moderate and tax included, there is no hidden cost.

The 4 of us headed to this restaurant today based on the excellent reviews on zomato. The place is quite modest and neat and the aquarium on the wall is a nice touch. Excellent service and suggestions by staff. We ordered some signature specials and some house favourites . We started with a decent mozarella sticks which was served with a very limp salsa. The oriental soup was a big hit around the table and full marks for presentation. The chilly pork was excellent and the meat itself was very well sourced. For our mains we ordered the minced ragu ..the ragu itself was well balanced but i question it's pairing with rice. It goes far better with the garlic bread and maybe even pasta.

This neatly decorated restaurant has made a name in continental cuisine at affordable prices. Well they do the continental dishes really well. Just dont order anything else that cuisine.

We had fish orranzy. Highly recommended.
Chicken breast grilled in bbq sauce and Pork chops were very good although both meat were lil overdone for my liking.

Pasta and Chicken Stroganoff was also very nice.
Chicken lollypop was horrible. Mozzarella cheese sticks were just about okayish.

Just stick to continental cuisine hence you will jave a grt experience dining !

The big fat foodie of our group took us to this tiny little joint in kasba during the pujas. After long hours of pandal hopping we were exhausted, and definately need some good quality food. And this place came as a saviour. 

The ambiance was pretty soothing with moderate decor and there were aquariums on both the sides. 

Ta staff were pretty friendly and helpful, and would defiantly guide you with the choices.

We ordered

1. Cheese sticks 
2. Pork chops
3. Dry chillichicken 
4. Veg Fried rice 
5.hot garlic chicken 
6. Chillichicken (gravy) 

The cheese sticks was yumm. They serve it with a spicy salsa which is excellent. 

The dry chillichicken was good, but the I didn't really liked the gravy. But they chicken was tender and juicy.
Same goes for the hot garlic chicken. It will  definately make you feel good.

Let's talk about the pork chops.
In one word 'Marvellous' 
I am definately coming back for the pork chops. 
A must try, highly recommended.

Those who love continental food or are always up to try some, pay a visit to this place. You surely won't regret. I always like to taste new dishes and this place didn't disappoint. Also, a good restaurant is one which servers authentic food and is pocket friendly at the same time. So this is a good restaurant. Situated beside Acropolis mall, it can easily be located too.
A small suggestion, try chicken a la kiev.

During pujas, usually the food quality degrades in any restaurant, but I am really really happy and satisfied after visiting this place. Located near acropolis mall, so it's not difficult to locate the place. Five of us went there and we had sumptuous amount of food. The continental is absolutely incredible. For starters we took tempora prawn it was crispy yet very light, chilli pork.. Well this I especially loved.. The pork was solf almost melted in my mouth.. It was juicy.. It was up to the mark. For main course we took 5 individual continental dishes. Chicken la kiev.. It was served with smashed potatoes.. Coleslaw.. White sauce.. Grillen chicken breast in white sauce.. It was served with the same plus some vegetables. Fish oranzzy.. Now this was something new.. It's a sweet crispy fish fillet served with capsicums and smashed potatoes.. Chicken stroganoff.. Rice was served this one.. And lastly I took minced lamb ragu and I loved it.. The lamb was cooked very well.. The spices and everything was just perfect. And also we ordered mocktails.. Litchi mojito tasted very well and soothing. I am really happy and glad that I visited this place. And of course not to forget the interior is amazing.. The hospitality was praiseworthy as well.. Everything was perfect. A good start to durga puja.. Highly recommended! :)

Amazing Continental food at a very decent price. The space is a bit cramped but they are just starting so we need to give them some time. And we Kolkatan's are not very finicky about decor, we are an emotional city and what we want is warmth and attention. We tried Lamb Chops, Fish Organzie, Chicken Strogonov, a Sausage dish (dnt remember), bacon wrapped prawns, Grilled Fish and Chocolate brownie with ice cream. Lvd each dish and proportions were quite large. A must try for foodies who are not finicky on ambience and decor.

With the pujos around, didn't feel like cooking stuff.
Besides since am on a high protein, low carb diet did a quick search out here in zomato and settled for this place.

Placed an online order. The service was prompt with no additional phone calls to seek for address.

I had ordered for a grilled chicken. Boy it was some surprise what's with two think sliced chicken fillets cooked optimally in white sauce with treaty herbs. This was accompanied with twin garlic breads (unfortunately had turned soggy), sauteed/tossed vegetables, mashed potatoes and some coleslaw.

Overall, an adequate dinner for one who prefers continental and even for a diabetic.

Kudos to the guys for serving high quality stuff at such a reasonable price. I have swallowed this place hook, line and sinker!

Today is Mahalaya and it's veggie day for my mom and dad. So my mom told me yesterday night that I was free to eat anything I wish :)

Silver Platter has been on my radar for quite sometime based on the fantastic reviews it has received. So, instead of my rice bowl and chicken popcorn from KFC, I decided to go for the grilled chicken from Silver Platter. My total bill after a nice little discount from Zomato was ‚Çπ 242.

The food was delivered in good condition and was neatly packed. The grilled chicken, mashed potatoes with sauted veggies, coleslaw, and garlic bread were all packed separately. 

Now about the portions. All accompaniments were very generous. The slices of grilled chicken - there were two - were huge. As for the taste of the food, it was very good. The chicken was moist, the sauce was tasty, the mashed potatoes and veggies were as they should be, and the garlic bread was also tasty - albeit a little soft. 

Al in all, silver platter is highly recommended for a tasty and pocket-friendly meal. Enjoy!

I wonder why this place isn't highlighted more. I bet there is no other restaurant in town serving continental so delicious at this price range. The lamb just melted in my mouth. Pork rib was so juicy. Tacos were mouth watering. The food satisfied every inches of our taste buds. Quantity was good enough. Ambiance, decor everything is beautiful. One drawback is serving time was long and their recommended dish grilled fish wasn't available.Aniket Mallick

After seeing good reviews in zomato I decided to order something online for first trial.Since I was opting for continental menu and knowing the fact that there are really few restros in kolkata offering great continental food I was really not expecting much.So I just ordered one chilli garlic fish and pasta in white sauce.But to my surprise both the dishes were simply awesome in taste.It really surprised me in a good way and that too in such a reasonable price.I would like to order again from this resto and this time would like to visit the place because I am really very impressed.

Midst the crowd of restaurants that has mushroomed in this region lately, lies this humble and neat eatery. I stumbled upon this place on zomato a few days back, only reason being the wall mount aquarium( I'm a crazy bout fishkeeping). That's the only reason I wanted to pay a visit and honestly when I entered the place today, I didn't have too much expectation. The ambience is simple and neat. The wall mount aquariums add that xing to the ambience though they could have been more attractive and well maintained(couldn't help to add that the oranda kept in the little jar at the mocktail bar should deserve a bigger home). But coming to the food, I found it absolutely delicious. The seafood cocktail was tangy and creamy and the squids in it was perfectly done. We had baked fish which came with saute vegetables, mashed potato and garlic bread and the garlic lemon sauce which deserves a special mention. The fish was fresh and tender. Then we had chicken stroganoff, shredded chicken done in spicy pepper mushroom sauce which came with parsley rice and garlic bread. Though I did not like the bread, the rice had the perfect aroma and flavor of parsley and sauted vegetables. The succulent chicken shreds in  pepper mushroom sauce was delectable. We couldn't try out the mocktail or desserts as we were full by then, and would love to comeback for that. Moreover it's extremely pocket friendly. I would highly recommend this place for its great food and heart warming hospitality.

Coming across this name in zomato i decided to go through the menu,and well it was pretty intriguing! So i fixed my mind and headed to this not so explored restaurant. Trust me this place did not dishearten me at all at the very first look.
* Ambience - peaceful is what comes to my mind at first. The aquariumed walls,the lamps and a dimly lit room,perfect to take you away for the hustle and bustle of the outside world.

* Service - prompt. Courteous. Helpful.

* FOOD - Coming to the best part,this place is a hidden gem. The menu is extremely impressive given the fact that they are coming at such reasonable prices. We had ordered for a Cinderella mocktail and a chiang mai punch. Both the drinks were innovative. Extra points for the presentation of the chiang mai punch. Me and my friend loved it! Next we ordered for chilly pork which was good! Not the best though. Coming to the main course,we decided on a minced lamb ragu and a grilled chicken breast in creamy mushroom sauce. Both had been served with portions of garlic bread and coleslaw. While the lamb was delectable with oodles of flavours infused in it,the grilled chicken breast was nothing short of that. The quantities were sufficient. Coming to the dessert they suggested us their speciality which was fruity punch. Now the presentation of it was really impressive. Very pleasing on the palates. (One little suggestion... try giving two scoops of icecream as it was tasting more like a fruit salad than a dessert).
I wish this place all the luck. Looking forward to more visits. ‚úå

I wonder why Silver Platter is not one of the most famous restaurants in Kolkata. I bet you won't find a continental place like this for such a reasonable price. Each and every dish is prepared with extensive care and garnished beautifully. The ambience is not the worst but could have been better. I strongly recommend everyone to try this place at least¬†once and you won't regret it.

We zeroed in on this restaurant after reading about it on Zomato.the place is small but has a very nice ambience.four of us ordered the pork chop ,one challo kebab and one of us ordered the fish platter.the food was exceptionally good and I will go to the extent of saying that this was one of the best restaurants of its kind in Kolkata(and I am quite a foodie and try new restaurants all the time).the sauce used in pork chops was absolutely yummy and the mashed potato and the vegetables were cooked to perfection.each of us had two soft drinks along with the food.but the most surprising part was the bill which was 2067 after such a meal for six.we recommend this place to everyone.please go and try this place.you will definitely like it.

Well after seeing the high rating i zeroed on this resturant to visit this sunday. The price was another reason to visit this place coz where can u find continental dishes at such low price? Each n every dish was carefully prepared to perfection and garnished beautifully. The best part of the dinner today was that  it didnt feel heavy- well particularly because it was not laden with excessive mayonese chese and other ingredients that make the food tad bit heavier. We had  tempura prawn , seafood cocktail, chelo kebab, chicken a la kiev, chicken breast grilled.. i am putting the pics f the foods and bill as well..and yes at the end they also gave a 50% off coupon of osmosis day spa  as well (yaaayyy :p)

Went there based on Zomato rating . 

Good part -
Ambiance
Food
Hospitality
Price

Things that need improvement -

If you are group larger than 6 heads, then they are not equipped to make you sit together
I tried to order Kebabs typicall approach of discouraging by saying it will take 50 min to 1 hr ... 50 min on sunday evening ... i will interpret it no one likes your kebab so you dont prefer selling it.
Dish was served one by one , so by the time 6th person recived his order 1st person was done. That was really odd. If you are serving type of food which cannot be shared , you need to make sure you have the capacity to serve all together in a table.
Bill was revised thrice finally i paid without looking furthur ... although " sorry" was said.

Conclusion 
Extremely poor management and very good food.

Didn't expect the food to be as good as it was.. The borderline tacky decor deceived me into believing the food would be ordinary as well.. Boy was I wrong... I tried the pork chops with mashed potato and veggies.. Meat was amazingly tasty and the mash potato had the perfect creamy texture.. My friends ordered grilled fish and chelow kabab which were good as well. They should, however, work on improving the seating arrangement as we felt a little cramped for space.. However, that's nitpicking. Especially because the quality and taste of the food managed to overshadow the minor discomfort ..Silver Platter looks like an ordinary multi-cuisine restaurant from the outside but it has definitely achieved a level of culinary awesomeness that some so-called highend restaurants fail to match.

Finally i am giving review to silver platter because at first i gave order online so at home i faced a lil bit problem in having that food so I visited the place today and the place has really good decoration with great environment and staffs are pretty courteous.Now i will discuss about the main part
"The food"
We ordered 
1.bacon wrapped prawn:-that was real treat for tongue,for the 1st time i have tasted bacon which is perfectly prepared by their chef and inclusion of prawn really gave ultimate twist and i loved their way of serving and that specifies whole story,they are respecting their job.

2.Grilled pork chop:-At first I would like to say i loved their size of meat ,then tenderness of that mean and then the grilled sauce on that after all that I started digging and i found the mixture of fresh veggies and sauce with mashed potato really enhanced the taste of the dish and We really enjoyed each and every bite of that.

3.Fish and chip:-Everyone's favorite and they really prepared that with care.The fish was so buttery and fries were crunchy and most importantly they weren't greasy and that is the thing really impressed me because while frying something taking good care of that object is important and they did so big thumbs up to them.

Last but not the least hold this name to go further and never give us a chance to feel bad about your place.Keep it up, we will visit again.

A little disappointed only on the dessert that was served because it was meant to be hot but was served completely cold and hard. Else the food was awesome to taste :)
            

And a ¬†piece of advice to the restaurant owners - you should include more continental items in your menu list, the choice is here :)

Silver platter is a newly opened restaurant cum cafe near kasba.. I went there in search of some light food, that is light on pocket and not far from my home.. As i was not willing to have something that's heavy but fulfills my hunder, i ordered club sandwich and chicken lollipop. While we waited for the order to get served.. I closely took a look at the ambience of the restaurant.. Its a simple , yet elegant decoration with aquariums placed in the walls.. The ceiling , painted with vibrant colors is sure to draw the attention of the visitors. Its a small restaurant, the chairs n tables were closely placed , so if the restaurant gets full then it will be chaotic. Luckily today the time i visited it was just us and no1 else, so we enjoyed our time there. The waiter served our order pretty quicky hardly within 10 mins.. So i have to say, service was prompt. Chicken lollipop tasted perfect. Not so sweet but the tangy chilli flavour served with grated salad with lemon juice sprinkled on top. It was heavenly.. Loved every bite of it.. The club sandwich was however not as good as we expected.. As they had toasted the bread and then added the stuffings.. The stuffing no doubt was tasty but since the bread was toasted it was hard and dry. Had they grilled the sandwiches with a small amount of butter then the breads would have tasted much better. Rest all were fine.. As i had went to this outlet for the first time its too early to rate them more than 3.5 .. Need to try out more dishes to give the appropriate rating.. Nevertheless, this is one of the budget friendly, light on stomach restaurants to visit near the kasba location.

The restaurant is located on the Rajdanga main road beside HDFC bank(kasba branch).
its a small joint with nicely decorated interiors and the walls on both the sides were covered with big aquariums.We went there on the Independence day and also it was my Friend's Birthday. 

We Ordered :¬† Virgin Mojito,Tri Colour Mocktail,Seafood Cocktail,Semolina Crusted Calamari,Fish- Oranzzy and Grilled Chicken Breast.

Both the Mocktails were very refreshing, and the mocktail of the day was 'Tri Colour' for the 70th Independence day. 
Seafood cocktail consisted of three prawns,Squids and crab meat in a tangy mayonnaise sauce.
Calamari was crunchy and delicious and served with mayonnaise.
Chicken Breast were two grilled chicken breasts with 2 pieces of garlic breads, coleslaw salad and mashed potato.The chicken was tender and juicy.
Fish-Oranzzy were three fillets of grilled fish with three rings of bell pepper.Garnished with chocolate sauce and a thin slice of orange.
Cheese Sticks were 6 pieces of deep fired sticks filled with lots of melted cheese and served with a tomato salsa dip.

we got 'Cheese Sticks' as a complementary dish after downloading and registering in an app.
The dish is offered only if total bill amount is greater than 700.
The dishes were sufficient in size to fill two people.
The staffs were really courteous.They helped us to make choice and suggest their best dishes.
Definitely a recommended place for all the foodies out there........

Have been reading a lot of good reviews about this place. So today(15th Aug) my neighbour n I decided to have our dinner here.situated very close to acropolis mall n in between nabapally n chakraborty para this small restaurant serves continental/Indian dishes.
We opted fr the continental cuisine since most of the dishes recommended here in the reviews were continental.
We ordered:
1.chilli garlic fish( it was delicious.quantity was good)
2.fish oranzzy.( very good)
3.grilled chicken breast.( good)
Service was fine..
But my only complaint is that owing to the small size of the restaurant when kababs were made outside the thick fumes n irritating burnt smell was coming inside.though after complaining one of the staff member sprayed room freshner but nonetheless it was a turnoff.
Overall it was a good experience.

Really was a surprise package to me. Have crossed this restaurant so many times without even giving a thought to enter, until my foodie buddy really kidnapped me to this place.
Interior..awesome. Decoration of such a small area can be this good, one can't believe until visiting the restaurant. Coming to the food, continental cuisine is really "finger licking good". Ordered 4 different kind of mocktails, starters, and main course. Every..yes every single item/dish is so so delicious. Thankful to that friend. Now a days I keep on finding reasons to be there. Must try for all foodie.

Dined here last Friday ... Ordered Seafood Minestrone Soup and Grilled Pork Chops ... The soup was quite delicious ... The Pork Chops were decent too, but could have been more tender ... the assortment of Grilled vegetables was good enough ... Garnishing needs to be more spot on as the vegetables were supposed to be alongside the Pork pie and not beneath ... Garlic breads are my favourite ... One real disappointment was that the garlic breads served alongside the soup and the Pork were not garlic breads at all ... Such exaggeration could've been avoided ... Nevertheless it was a decent first-time experience ... The service staffs were extremely cordial .... Wish to visit here more often to try out the other continental delicacies ... üòÄ

Today I finally made it to this place!Surprises indeed come in small packages.Tantalising Continental is what this place serve.
Location: Just a few blocks next to Acropolis Mall towards Gariahat.But very easy to miss since it's a very small place couched between buildings.
Our orders: Semolina crusted Calamari,Grilled Chicken Breast, Fish Oranzzy and Lemon Mint Cooler.
Quality n' Quantity: No complaints about quality at all.Special points for the amazing plating up.
The calamari ring sizes were not that impressive. And so not chewy enough.
But full points to the fish in Fish Oranzzy.Tender,juicy,succulent-all in 1 plate.But the quantity served in this dish is not enough at all for 1 properly.Though the fish quality is worth the price yet the price of this one is more on the steeper side.The dish is a blend of sweet barbeque sauce and tangy orange. The bland mashed potato balances the sweet n' sour flavor.
The Grilled Chicken Breast was just a treat to the taste buds.Scrumptious, juicy,well-grilled,finger-licking Chicken breasts (2) covered in white mushroom sauce,accompanied by green veggies,mashed potato,coleslaw and 2 pieces of garlic bread.The tender,succulent,abundant mushrooms deserve special mention.
The Lemon Mint Cooler mocktail was perfect to quench the thirst.The exact balance of sweet, sour and salt was stroke perfectly.
Downs- Can't call it a perfect restaurant ambience. The place is not spacious at all. Max 5-6 tables. I wonder how they manage during the peak hour. Though the tables are beautifully lined with aquariums yet it's not enough to charm the crowd.Not the perfect date night milieu.More like a go-eat-leave setting.
Synopsis- A must-go place.Add it to your to-go list.Must not miss the moreish grilled chicken breast.Still awestruck!!!

Ask the masses today, the people of our generation and kasba is synonymous to the Barcelos, Chili‚Äôs and the Hoppipolas! It‚Äôs only when we venture into the depths, do we unearth beauties.¬†Silver Platter¬†is one such hidden gem. Have been here a couple of times over the last month, and I have only been impressed. It‚Äôs back to old school here, no glitz and glamour, no monkey business. Strictly good food, at a reasonable price.

The best continental food that i have ever had in kolkata. 

The place is a bit difficult to locate because in google maps the location pointed is a wrong one.

Drinks:
We had mango mule, cupid fantasy, lemon mint cooler, a day at the beach, cinderella.

The best one was: a day at the beach.
Mango mule was a bit spicy.
Lemon n mint cooler looked like karela juice bt         taste was nice. 

Starters:
Chickn lolipop, chicken nachos, and cheese sticks which we got as a complementary dish after downloading and registering in an app. This dish is offered only if total bill amount is greater that 700. 

Main course: 
Grilled chicken breasts
Grilled fish with lemon n butter sauc
Chicken al a kaive

 d main course was really verrrryyyy yummy. Absolutely loved each n every element o the dishes. Specially the mashed potato.  Tooo good.

Dessert:
Brownie with ice cream
Caramelized banana.
Fruit fantacy

Deserts were also very tasty.  

Service: 
Brilliant. Really very helpful humble and cool. 

Really enjoyd d food and d service. This place is value for money.

The review is a bit late for this one. I've tested and tasted my luck for the second time too. First one was Mother's Day celebration. I couldn't click any pictures but would definitely upload after my third visit. The place is vibrant and the owners are very warm , extremely dedicated to customer delight. We have tried potato n leek soup veg & non veg. Both the versions are heavenly. Tried mozzarella sticks .....very good,  fish fingers. ...excellent. ...drums of heaven. ..super, tangri kebab...not the best I've had. The maincourse experimented are chicken ala Kiev,  grilled chicken , chello kebab. The Chicken Ala Kiev was well done , moist and well palatable. Do not expect the Park Street replica here but very decent for 225 bucks. The grilled chicken was super good. Excellent exotic veggies served with a giant mound of flavoursome mash. The Chello Kebab although I wouldn't recommend. Indian kebabs surely not their forte and that's perfectly ok they should make signature continental stuff.The Chello Kebab shashlik was not tender , cold and the rice served wasn't appetizing. Definitely would go back for more. Three cheers for the soup , Ala Kiev and grilled chicken. A sure try for continental lovers of South Kolkata. Enjoy üòÄüòÄüòÄ

This place offers great continental food at an exceptionally affordable price. It's a hidden gem and deserves more popularity. We tried the chicken a la kiev, bacon wrapped prawns and fried squid. While the squid was too deep fried for my taste, the bacon wrapped prawns were fantastic. Would definitely recommend it.

Next was the Minced Lamb Ragu, inspired by the classic Sicilian combination of lamb, dry mint and chilli flakes and was served with a herb-butter rice, and salad. This was a true beauty and I couldn‚Äôt help but go back for one spoonful after another. Then came the Chelo Kebab, but very honestly, I am biased about this particular signature of Peter Cat, and like the numerous versions of it that I have had at other places, this one failed to impress me. Finally, there was the Grilled Pork Chop with a BBQ glaze, again served with a mash, salad and garlic bread. I am a sucker for fatty, juicy pork and this one was a superb rendition of a much-famed classic. I really liked the fact that all the accompaniments with the mains were very good in themselves, be it the creamy, smooth potato mash or the crispy, buttery garlic bread.

Now coming to their food we had ordered Club Sandwich, Chilli Pork and Grilled Prawn
Club sandwich non veg is worth money and it comes with french fries...n taste wise also goodüòäüòÄ
Chilli pork was also good and coming to Grilled Prawn it had 8 pieces prawn size not bad tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce with butter rice and 2 piece garlic bread...liked the taste as it was a combination of sweet and spicy at the same time...
will try the other dishes in due time....‚ò∫Ô∏èüòÄ

Every dinner bears a story, be it in your home or someplace else!! Some, we remember, some are prized and some we forget in the long run!! But if you see a place which itself attracts you to create a dinner story worth remembering as a prized possession, don't you think, it is something really blissful for any foodie out there??!!
Located right beside the "Rene Towers", at Rajdanga, a restaurant that creates a dinner story worth remembering, each and every day is "Silver Platter".

Though not a very big infrastructure of global standard, the initiative of Mr. Kaushik Saha is really adorable and worth appreciating for the beautiful ambience with aquariumed walls and soothing lights, creating a divine silvery effect, doing justice to its name eventually.

Adding up to that, the delectable mouth watering dishes and beautiful mocktails constitute the essential elements of the dinner story to pen down. To highlight upon the characters of such a story, the seafood delights play a pivotal role of which "Seafood Minestrone Soup" is good enough to start off with. However, the arrival of "Semolina Crusted Calamari", and "Bacon Wrapped Prawns", create the ultimate romantic turn, that a story worth telling deserves.

Accompanied by some sweet mocktails like "Virgin Mojito", "Cupid Fantasy" and "Chiang Mai Punch", the romance turns to love, which attains a concoction of passion with the flaming touch of some spicy "Mango Mule".

And the budding love eventually leads to the roller coaster ride of a journey filled with tasty mellifluous notes when you get the chance to drool upon some exceptionally tasty  "Chicken & Mayo salad", "Minced Lamb Ragu", "Grilled Pork Chops" and "Chelo Kebab", beating away the villain in you constantly reminding you of the calories you're gaining.

And like any other story, a sweet ending makes everything cool, and at "Silver Platter",the melodious anecdotes of some "Fruit Fantasy" and "Brownie with ice cream" will do the perfect justice to it, for sure.

So that's how it can be described to let everyone know, the basic elements of "Silver Platter", without which your dinner story will be incomplete for sure!! However, there are several other options in the menu to customize your story in your way!!

So, what are you waiting for?? The world is waiting to listen to your story at "Silver Platter"!!
Happy eating!! :-)

Thanks a lot to

"dinner on a silver platter" words which are akin to fine dining, something that will leave a lingering taste and sooth your taste buds-Well such was my dining experience in silver platter.
The restuarant is a small property adjacent to rene towers near Acropolis mall. Though a small eatery,  the interiors are beautifully and the ambience is soothing like silver hue of the moon. This newly opened outlet by Kaushik Saha has acclaimed chef Apu Biswas on board . The captain , Sneha along with her team of well trained waiters guided us through our cullinary journey.
At the very onset we were served "Cupid Fantasy" and "Blue Lagoon" as welcome drinks. I personally loved the former drink for it's blend of strawberry, lime and mint.
The "Seafood Minestrone Soup" was rich in fresh seafood and aggravated my hunger pangs.
"Chicken and mayo salad" was  a perfect blend of grilled chicken, bell pepper, lettuce and mayo.
"Semolina Crusted Calamari" was a departure from mundane. The squid rings was cooked to perfection and was a collective favourite.
"ChilliGarlic Fish" comprised of perfectly cooked fish 
Bacon wrapped prawn was a delight to behold as well as to taste.
The main course comprised of 
"Grilled chicken breast" a sumptuous dish comprising of grilled chicken, served with mased potato and veggies and garlic bread
"Minced Lamb Ragu" inspired by Sicilian combination oflamb, chilli flakes was a meatlovers' delight
"Grilled Prok chop" sifficed my craving for succulent pork.
"Chelo Kebab " was taste and presentation wise superb!!
Desserts in forms of "fruit fantasy" and "brownie with ice-cream" gave a befitting conclusion to a beautiful dining saga.
The mocktails specially "chiang  mai punch" added  and augmented the items.
Silver Platter is the new name to reckon when it comes to continental cuisine. A place where you will go time and again for a exclusive dining experience

"Big things come in small packages"..acquainted with the golden words? Well, Silver Platter is just that and a surprise in a nutshell! They outdid themselves in terms of the food quality and variety served!
Extremely easy to locate, situated on the Rajdanga Main road, the restaurant is has an array of colours at their entrance! On moving in, you will be startled by the sheer beauty if the place! Aquariums all around.. The owner is a delight to talk to and pursues his interest in photography! Our gift for the evening was the beautiful group pic by him! Hence, special mention for Kaushik, the owner and the chef, Apu.

Moving on to the mocktails, amidst the array of mocktails served, Mango Mule, Virgin Mojito, and Chiang Mai Punch stood out.

Mocktails

- Mango Mule: A spicy mixture of Mango and lime with mint. Excellent choice.

- Chiang Mai Punch: A mixture of pineapple juice, and strawberry crush in ice-cream. It sure adds that punch to your palette.

- Virgin Mojito: A well known,classic drink! And full points for the freshness and the soothingness.

Salads

- Chicken and Mayo Salad: This is a well known, already tried, perfectly made salad! It had chicken, bell pepper, green apple, lettuce and mayonnaise.

Starters

- Semolina Crusted Calamari: Squid rings coated with semolina. The fish was cooked perfectly and coating was crispy and perfect. It was served with an exotic dipping of lime mayo.

- Chilli Garlic Fish: The fish was prepared beautifully. It was soft, well cooked,  well marinated. The semi gravy sauciness added the much needed punch. Must try!

- Bacon Wrapped Prawns: Oh my god!! Where most places fail to please me with this dish. These guys scored a 10 on 10!! Excellently cooked, spiced, fried. A mouthful of that lands you in heaven! Must try.

Mains

- Grilled Chicken Breast: The portion is sufficient for two people. The chicken was perfectly cooked and sized in a white mushroom gravy. Served with veggies, mashed potatoes, herbed rice and garlic bread. The presentation was outstanding.

- Minced Lamb Ragu: There is ample lamb on the plate. You will not be disappointed. The taste is top notch. Served with some well balanced herbed rice, the combination was heavenly. 

- Grilled Pork Chops: This dish is extremely difficult to make. It could either make the reputation of the place or break it! The chef here is excellent. The spicy, tangy, sweet sauce layered the pork. There was an explosion of flavors and the meat was cooked to perfection. I was delighted!

- Chelo Kebab: A humble effort on their part and they succeeded! The kebabs were tender; there was an array of kebabs- green, white and red kebabs. Mutton sheekh kebab also graced the plate. Served on a plate of rice with generous dollops of butter. A grilled tomato cut into halves and an egg completed the dish!

The items stood out on their own. The variety and the taste was topnotch. Like this wasn't enough, next came the desserts.

Desserts 

- Fruit Fantasy: Fresh fruits tossed in honey, topped with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream. The ice cream was dripped with chocolate and strawberry sauce. 

- Brownie with ice-cream: A perfect ending to a delightful evening! Perfect balance of sweetness. You won't put your spoon down out of sweetness overload but because the dessert would be over even before you realised! Hence, do not share and enjoy it!

I had come with low expectations only to be happily surprised! I left with a huge smile across my face. Thanks team Silver Platter for the excellent evening!

Today was one of those rare culinary occasions when everything I ate made my taste buds crave for more. Great food always makes me chirpy! Cheese omelette, chicken stroganoff, chicken ala Kiev and tangy watermelon are the source of my happiness. The chicken stroganoff was amazingly delicious. The staffs were really courteous.All in all a great food day!!!

Last Sunday afternoon, dragged my family to this joint based on the reviews.¬† Was massively disappointed. The restaurant had deserted look & feel (during the¬† entire period we were there, the joint had 3 customers, us and two couples). We asked for Chelo Kabab (their signature item) and it is not available.¬† Ordered Pork Chops, Grilled Chicken Breast, Minced Lamb Ragu, and Chicken Stroganoff.¬† 

The meals were not sufficient in size to fill a person (we adults eat less and had slight empty stomach - something that doctor will recommend I think; my teenage girls were very hungry at end of the meal).

Except for Chicken Stroganoff, rest tasted lousy. Were the breast, lamb, pork waiting for customers for long time? Smelled like it. The pork chop should be called Fat Chop - hardly any meat, just pork fat.

I have heard of restaurants hiring people to write reviews, wonder if the reviews in Zomato were like that. Probably we should trust reviews of "star reviewers" less.

I write very little reviews - but this restaurant was so disappointing that I felt I should write my feeling so that others benefit from it.

PS: They asked us to install some app and then we will get a free dish (gave WiFi password for this). Did that (who does not like a good deal) and then got Mozerralla Cheese Sticks. That dish was surprisingly good. App uninstalled.

PS++: Order Banana Icecream - less said the better.

Once I rated this place as 1. Never mind. It was an experience once in a blue moon. Im being a frequent foodie of this place since having a crave for continental food so they have proved themselves time and again. Be it Ala Keiv, Grilled Fish or Chicken. Yes they really try to make the dishes look good with some nice dressings as well. Last night the Grilled Chicken Breast in BBQ sauce was bit tangy but ya it was good. Also one should try the Grilled Club Sandwich which I beleive is too much for a big stomach. More to go Silver Platter.

A nice little joint near KFC Restaurant in Kasba which specialises in Continental cuisine. Options are limited though. We went for Grilled Chicken which was served with Mashed Potato, vegetables & creamy mustard sauce and Grilled Fish in Lemon Butter sauce. Waiting time was not too much. As far the taste is concerned both the dishes were commendable. The plating was also done tastefully. Definitely can visited again to try something else. Only request to their management would be to include more varieties.

Silver Platter - a tiny little place hidden in plain sight that serves decent continental.  The highlight of the day was definitely the non veg club sandwich and the mocktails. The mocktails infact were so good, we were almost ordered a second round. In all honesty, if I had to nitpicker, I felt the only downside was that they serve this huge lump of mashed potato with the grilled chicken breast..Not many people in their right mind are going to finish it off (unless they really like potatoes!) I wish they would substitute it with pasta or something similar. Overall, the experience was good. Looking forward to visiting the again.

March 2017 -
Visited this place again today evening. Was disappointed to the core with their service, ambiance and the food. The service was pathetic - we had to be repeatedly told to clear the used places - they served us the starter and the main at about the same time - on telling them to food/drinks/service was unexpectedly bad, they just gave us a blank stare. Not expected at all from a place they consistently gets high ratings in zomato. Maybe it was just an off day, but I am not visiting this place ever again for sure.

Some days you discover a new filmmaker, some days an author you never heard of before, other days you discover an unknown jazz pianist who blows you away. And on some star crossed day you stumble upon a continental restaurant that's a stone's throw away from your own home that literally destroys all your preconceived notions about quality and cost of good food.

SILVER PLATTER - a newly opened, non descript and utterly unpretentious little restaurant tucked away beside Acropolis Mall transported us to gastronomic heaven today with their offerings. The Chello Kebabs we had here is right now among The Best in the city - and comparable to Peter Cat's. Both the grilled fish items, one in lemon butter and the other with citrus sauce melted in your mouth like poetry. The grilled chicken breast in barbeque sauce was so exquisitely soft we barely touched it with the knife and it spliced. It was unbelievable! The caramel banana topped with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce dessert was also sheer joy. And best of all, the total billing, to our astonishment, was below 1.5K - even a single one of these items (except the dessert) in comparable or lesser quality would easily cost as much in any given continental speciality restaurants in Park Street.

I'm still not sure whether this happened in reality or I was in a Bunuel dream. But then,the bill is still here in my hands...

Its not easy to find places serving good continental dishes at this price!
The place foes put a lot of emphasis on the aforementioned point.
They have great food at affordable rates.

Now as I had ordered from this place, I naturally cannot judge their ambience. But their delivery was swift and about 15 before ETA.

I had ordered a Grilled Chicken Breast and I assure you that they have done justice to it. The mushroom and that creamy dressing along with that grilled chicken was PERFECTION ( as Goodacre called it on F.R.I.E.N.D.S).
Along with the chicken they had provided us with Mashed Potatoes (well done, kudos), saut√©ed veggies, coleslaw kind of thing, 2 slices of bread and a full stomach.
Definitely try and this place out.
Happy dining. 
Edit: Ordered again. Just one word. AMAZING!

This restaurant located on the Rajdanga main road of Rashbehari-EM Bypass connector is truly a hidden gem. If someone wants good continental platters this is surely the place. Barely three months since it has started its business.. I would say it's a must visit for Continental foodies like me. We ordered semolina crusted Calamari served with mayonnaise..crunchy and delicious unlike other places where its a bit rubbery. Then we ordered chili pork n bacon wrapped prawn..both were mind blowing especially the bacon wrapped prawn. In the main course we ordered chicken Ala-kiev served with coleslaw, mashed potato & garlic bread , Minced lamb ragu served with coleslaw & buttered rice and grilled fish with creamy mushroom sauce served with coleslaw & garlic bread. All were sumptuous, delicious, appealing & outstanding. There are also series of refreshing mocktails they serve. At the end we were content with the taste , quantity & quality and special mention being that the restaurant is pocket friendly. A special mention is the extra-ordinary aquatic interiors with small colorful fishes on the walls. A Must visit.

Visited the place today itself with my wife and sis-in-law and in one word.... 'Awesome'.

We ordered Semolina crusted calamari, chilli pork as starters and they were so good we could not resist but order bacon wrapped prawns as the third starter.

For the main course we had Chicken ala kiev, grilled fish with creamy mustard sauce and minced lamb ragu. We were more than completely filled after this but the hunger for the taste remains.

Pros: Awesome ambiance, Good background music which was not too loud enough to disrupt a perfect evening adda and off-course mouth watering food.


Cons: The waiters could be a bit more knowledgeable about the ingredients for the dishes they serve.

Silver Platter is this small little outlet located on the main road in Kasba. The ambiance is decent, nothing special. However, there are some beautiful aquarium decorations which light up the place . Coming to the food, I must say it is really good. You have a variety of choices to select from. We started with the Chicken Lollipop which was really sumptuous. Then, we moved on to the Penne Pasta with chicken toppings and Grilled Chicken Breast. Both of these dishes were well made. To our surprise, we were offered a free plate of Mozzarella Cheese sticks, yum to taste and beautifully presented. Besides, on the whole, we also got a 10% discount on the whole bill. All of these for signing up on the application.¬†

The only issue was they don't accept cards. Otherwise this is a really good place, with mouth watering food! Also, the service is good and prompt!¬†

I will definitely recommend this to others. Keep up.

Cheers.

Located near to the Acropolis mall this place lists among "The long awaited places" of the Rajdanga, Nabapally area. The justification of the review in a nutshell, is totally based on the quality and taste of the food that this place offers you, for more refer below.
           Firstly I will start with the ambience, well yes this place is a bit small which has a couple of tables but I will say decently decorated. But at the same time would had been better if a little bit more space is added to it as it no doubt deserves it. 
         Secondly I will come to the main part that is the "Food" according to me, which was really not just "up to the mark" but to some extent beyond that, so I and my friend ordered for a Chicken Ala Kiev and a Grilled Chicken Breast of which I will be coming to  one by one -:
Chicken Ala Kiev
             Well, this dish is particularly Russian in origin but also features in the Polish cookbook of cuisines. It is a dish of boneless chicken breast which is normally rolled in garlic butter with herbs. After that coated with eggs and breadcrumbs then cooked or baked. And not to forget finally served with some delicious mashed potato preparation Well here the dish was almost prepared like the same sort except the part where the piece of chicken breast is cooked with herbs which was replaced by serving the herbs separately with some garlic bread and mashed potato..... boy !!! it was delicious.....
Grilled Chicken Breast
            This dish was actually ordered first out of the blue but ended up to be an aweome selection too. It is mainly chicken breast which is first seasoned with pepper and salt on both sides and then cooked or grilled to perfection. The trick that now steps in is making the mushroom cream sauce. which cannot involve too much cream or it can be overpowering which eventually will mask the more delicate flavours involved. The dish served by far had balanced all the flavours and had tasted fabulous with the herbs, mashed potato which came along with it.
            Lastly special appreciation for the the staff and management for running the show the way it is supposed to. Definitely a recommended place for all you foodies out there try the food out here as its worth it........

This is my second order from Silver Platter and I have to say got nothing other than dissapointment.  Ordered some chilli pork and turn out to be the worst chilli pork I have ever tasted.  The meat pieces are hard and big (chilli pork should be sliced pieces)   I also found the the meat is coated with something to make the pieces look bigger.  

Havent visited this place myself but heard about it a lot. So I order some squid rings and some lamb chops from this food joint. Well, the food was not THAT great to be honest. The squid rings have too much soda in it. The lamb chopw looked good but taste was very bad. I will order some other items and see if I can improve the rating.

The ambience is decent.
Located on the main road.

Semolina crusted calamari: this is squid rings fried in a batter and served with mayonnaise. They are crispy and delicious.

Chicken lollipop: this was like any other regular tasting lollipops found at many other places.

Chilli pork: the pork pieces were well cooked. The veggies added to it were fresh. The dish was spicy and very yummy.

Chicken stroganoff: this platter had rice, shredded chicken, mashed potatoes, coleslaw's salad The taste of it was little bland.

Grilled chicken breast: this was better. Two grilled chicken breasts with garlic breads, coleslaw's salad. The chicken was tender and the aroma of the added spices was great.

Minced lamb raghu: the platter has rice, two slices of garlic breads, coleslaw's salad and the minced lamb raghu. The lamb raghu had a sweety flavour. But was tastey.

Fish oranzzy: two fillets of grilled fish with three rings of pepper. Garnished with chocolate sauce, lemon and a ring of orange. The dish had a lemony, orangey and sweety flavour. Might not fill your tummy as it is not served with rice or garlic breads.

The eatery serves awesome food compared to your money. 
I would visit here often to try the other dishes too.

Opted for takeaway One plate Tandoori chicken and One chicken and mayonnaise salad.
The tandoori was half cooked tasted awful, and chicken and mayonnaise also didn't taste good.
Only good thing was the Grilled Chicken Breast that I had last week in the restaurant.
So 1 star only for that Grilled Chicken.

I have been to silver platter last night. It was an amazing experience. The food, the staff, everything was juz great.
#Location: this is at kasba new market stoppage; nearby acropolish mall. If coming from gariahat to ruby this eatery will be on left. 
#Ambience: its a small joint. The walls are covered with big aquariums filled with small tiny guppies. I Loved the fishes. Overall nice.
#Food: we ordered chicken grilled breast , fish orangy, mozzarella cheese stick, watermelon mocktail.
The grilled chicken platter was juz amazing. The served 2 chicken fillets covered with mushroom sauce along with mashed potato and garlic bread. It was so soothing for my taste buds. Yumm...
The fish orangy is a must try for all fish lovers as well as non fish lovers. Its totally different. Perfect balance of tang sweet salt made the dish outstanding. How can a grilled fish platter be such tasty I dnt know..
Mozzarella cheese stick was actually filled with huge amnt of cheese and nothing rubbish. I really liked it and also d tangy salsa sauce served with it.
Watermelon mocktail was really tasty and healthy cz it had real fruit pulp.
#service: the staff were really good, Helpful, welcoming. They know quite well what they are serving, thus they help to make choice and suggest their best dishes.

Really impressive. Next time I am going to try their seafoods.

Located just a few minutes walk away from Acropolis Mall, this is a really small restaurant but the pictureseque decor with walls lined by beautiful aquariums with little fishes of myriad colours will charm you! We helped ourselves to semolina crusted calamari which was crunchy and delicious along with another amazing preparation, lemon chicken skewers. The salt and pepper babycorn was a bit bland though! To our delight, we were given mozarella cheese sticks on the house which was again a favourite! For main course, we ordered grilled pork chops and chicken ala kiev. The chicken ala kiev was very gratifying and we loved the pork chops as well-laden with the right amount of fat and grilled to perfection so that it was as soft as it should be! We concluded the meal with caramelised banana with ice cream and chocolate brownie, of which the first one appealed to me more! Love to drop by again!

I ordered a non-veg club sandwich few hours ago. Silver Platter is 2mins away from my house and I have heard a lot about it.
I was simply bowled out with the club sandwich and the french fries that accompanied the sandwich. 
How can a sandwich be soooo damn delicious!! I was literally drooling over the sandwich. 
The sandwich is overstuffed with chicken, egg, mayo and what not. I missed out on other ingredients as I was so busy relishing the taste of every bit of it.
Now I am totally geared up for visiting the outlet and trying out other dishes. I have already decided my order. I am desperately waiting to taste their chicken lollipop, chicken lemon skewers and chicken strogannoff.

The newest discovery we made in the Kasba area while roaming about lookin for a place to eat on a holiday afternoon is this place. We suddenly noticed a new restaurant one day and just like the family of foodies that we are, we checked it out on a late afternoon when our stomach wanted filling continental food.
Not a very large place, but the decor is indeed impressive and intelligent. With sleek aquariums all over the walls that house colorful fish, and a bar counter made at a side (only mocktails, though!), the cosy space is bound to impress. Everyone at the restaurant is friendly and courteous, which is a plus, added with good music playing in the background, (extra points for that, because good music playing at restaurants has become a rarity).
Famished, we ordered-
Chicken Lollipops for a starter- It was delicious and we hogged on it.
The surprise was however, the complimentary cheese sticks that we got when we signed up with an app that they have a tie-up with. They were amazing, and so was the accompaniment salsa.
For main course, we ordered-
Penne with Chicken in white sauce- Good stuff in good quantity, that is a little tough to finish!
Penne with Bacon in white sauce- Salty bacon replaces the chicken this time!
Chicken Stroganoff- A platter of delight, this one. The parsley rice is a treat.alongside the chicken, which I ordered in white sauce. (Recommended!)
The garlic bread that was an accompaniment to each of the above dishes requires special mention. It's not everyday that one gets such garlic bread.
We were too full to order deserts!
The only thing missing- they need to introduce a card machine, which they're currently working on, as we were told.
Such a restaurant that serves up continental stuff was missing in this area. Thank god for this! :)

I am a fan of continental food and there aren't many cheap continental food joints across the city. Silver Platter, an auto ride from Ruby Hospital perfectly servers the purpose of a pocket friendly continental restaurant. I mainly come here for their stroganoff. The rice tastes perfect with grilled chicken chunks and mushroom in white sauce. I have tried their grilled chicken breast and nachos, as well. Not bad, at all.¬†

However, at times the place smells of damp. The management should take care of this.

Stopped by for a quick takeaway and honestly was not expecting much from their exterior but since i was starving i listened to my tummy and just went in. I was indeed shocked to see such a tiny place so well done and decorated. The ambiance impressed me immediately. They have aquariums on the wall and the counter is straight up . Pretty neat, clean and well done. Next the staff behaviour was really sweet and nice. I hope they remain that way in near future as every new small restro has good behaviour and big smile but doesnt last too long as they cannot afford trained staffs.

Coming to food. I was in no mood to experiment so i chose a non veg club sandwich. Simple ,quick & riskfree. But i was really surprised at their quality,quantity and price. The sandwich was yummilicious and humungous that i ate it in installments. It was full of chicken, mayo , greens and they gave french fries too.  Just wow!

Price was affordable. I am deffo going again to try their mains.

Update as on 1st july 2016- dropped in with my husband for dinner and since i had already made my mind about trying their mains i had to come back and so i did. I must say "thank god i came back" or else i would seriously miss out on some amazing food journey. 

As a starter i ordered for chilly pork and it was just amazing. Very well done with the right amount of spice and chilly. Loved it and wanted another plate all to myself. Next we went for the lamb ragu and grilled chicken breast in mushroom sauce & both served with mashed potatoes and coleslaw. The lamb was ok, minced like keema, not spicy and was ordinary or maybe because , in front of the chicken it dint stand a chance. The chicken was amazing and so well done, i was practically licking the plate off. This small joint i feel till date served the best chicken conti dish and that too for a little price. So satisfied i will be dropping by again with my relatives and make them have the chicken item.

Zomato helped to to discover this gem of a restaurant. I love continental food. While checking out the menu and reveiws on zomato i was pleasently surprised by the rates. So promptly me and my friend decided to go there for dinner.
Its near KFC restaurant just beside HDFC Bank. The ambience was very nice. The interiors, the lamps and the fish aquarium were facinating. There is also a well set mocktail section.
¬†Now coming to the food as recommended we ordered Semolina Crusted Calamari, Grilled Chicken Breast, Fish Oranzzy and A mocktail.¬†
The calamari was very tasty. Thin crisp and salty crust was commendable. Presentation was top notch. It gave us total satisfaction both in taste n in sight.¬†
Then came the Grilled chicken. It so delicious especially the sauce on the chicken. Buttery mushroom sauce. It made the dish one of a kind. There were two pieces of chicken breast -good soft well grilled. Plus sauted veggies, mashed potato and coleslaw salad. Full plate was enough to satisfy a really hungry soul. ¬†Coleslaw salad was another highlight of the dish. ¬† I wish i knew the recipe :P
Then there was the fancy dish of the evening The Fish Oranzzy. The fish was soft succulent and just beutifully cooked. The plating was beautiful. The grilled bellpepers had mashed potato inside them. On the top there was the Basa fillets.... Very impressed.¬†
Thai Punch was beautiful. It was very refreshing. Do try this one.¬†
Next time i am gonna try whole lot of new things.¬†
Main thing is that we got quality food in reasonable price... Finding Continental food at this price is very difficult.¬†
Total bill came near to 800rs. Gonna come back again. :)

We're always on the hunt for new places to dine in, mostly preferring ones that can make our shirts tighter while keeping our perpetual state of "broke-ness" in mind as well. While rummaging through Zomato, Silver Platter caught my eye and we decided to drop in here for lunch today.
Quite close to Acropolis Mall, the place is very easy to spot. If not exactly capacious, this 24 seater restaurant has nice interiors with an unique decor constituting of an elongated aquarium (bustling with activity!) running along both walls of the room.
We ordered for a Watermelon and Litchi Mocktail, Mozzarella Cheese Sticks and a Grilled Chicken Breast.
The drink was a whirpool of fruit flavours with orange juice being the base filled with bits of litchi and watermelon pulp. I felt a strong pungent hit on the first sip but it gradually made peace with the taste buds and was quite refreshing along the way.
The Mozzarella cheese sticks had a thin and crunchy coating filled with oodles of the stringy cheese inside. The salsa I felt lacked the punch needed to balance out the blandness of the cheese. However, biting into the sticks and revelling at the sight of the white rubbery texture being stretched out is a pleasure in itself.

The plate of grilled chicken breast was a wholesome meal with ample ingredients to lust after. Two medium sized fillets of the grilled meat was covered in a white sauce with chunks of button mushrooms and came with two slices of garlic bread, a huge dollop of smooth buttery mashed potatoes, boiled strips of beans, carrots, broccoli and squash and mayonnaise slathered coleslaw as a palate cleanser. While the meat could've been juicier, the sauce was absolutely lovable. When combined with the buttered veggies, garlic bread and creamy potato, each bite spelled bliss and comfort. The garlic bread could have done with some more toasting though. While I felt that the flavor of the coleslaw was a misfit in the entire dish, he lapped all of it up with immense joy along with the aforementioned drink.

Their service, warmth and choice of background music made the experience even better, and overall, this is a great place to dine in when you want good food that doesn't cost you a bomb.

This place is near Acropolis mall. A bit difficulty in locating as  its a small place. The space is very small. Aquariums are placed. The ambience is really good.  Now coming to the food. We went there after our semester exams so we went in a group of 15-16 people. We ordered grilled pork chops, chicken ala kiev, penne with white sauce, grilled fish , grilled chicken breast and veg penne. It came after an hour. So yes the service isnt that good. But the food ‚ô• Wow. Its amazing. Toooooo yummy. Every dish is soo tasty. Specially the grilled chicken breast. It was delicious. Served with smashed potatoes. We were too hungry so couldnt wait to click the pictures. :p And and and..they only charge for the service tax 5%. No added tax. So the food is quite affordable.  So its a hidden gem in Kasba. Must Visit.

SILVER PLATTER: A GREAT FIND FOR ME

Silver Platter made its mark within one month of its opening for continental and seafood cuisine in Kasba. It has started to create its reputation with the quality food they serve. The cuisine which they chose for their restaurant is not so familiar in the local area and people who loves seafood and continental can definitely bookmark this place. 

#LOCATION: 
This place is just few metres away from Acropolis Mall, Kasba. If you are coming from Ruby to Gariahat it will be on your Right side and vice versa. Not a difficult place to find as its on the main road.

#AMBIENCE : 
Even though the space is small they have utilised the places very well. I liked the mocktails section which is decorated pretty well. The colourful ceilings, the dim lights and the wall aquariums all over. You would find lil creatures roaming all around as you enjoy your meal.

#FOOD & DRINKS:

Well, its very rare when I love everything of a place and this place has almost matched that mark. These are the following thing which I ordered:

MOCKTAILS
¬∞¬∞ MANGO MULE: The mocktail gave a nice kick start for the meal. I loved the cocktail. The spicy mango drink was thick, had a good flavour of mango and hot. A definite go to option if you love spicy drinks.

APPETISER
¬∞¬∞ TEMPURA PRAWNS: The interior being soft and the exterior being crispy was what made me fall for this. It was perfectly fried and served with their home made sauce. The quality of prawns is something which really impressed me.

MAIN COURSE
¬∞¬∞ GRILLED CHICKEN BREAST : This was suggested by the staff when I asked about their speciality. This is one of their highest selling items and it lived up to its expectation. Two big size breast pieces cooked with mushroom, served with veggies , mashed potatoes and garlic bread. Well it was yum. 

DESSERT
¬∞¬∞ FRUIT FANTASY: A great meal requires a great ending and it just did that. This item was suggested yet again and it turned out to be great. Fresh Fruits in honey, topped with chocolate and strawberry sauce served with vanilla ice cream. Just try it once and I bet you would come back again to have it again.

#SERVICE: The Service was good too. The staff had a good knowledge about what he was serving. He always had a smile on his face which gave a good vibe.

Last Words:
A definite go to place to have some lovely continental food at a very reasonable price. The new contender has come out strong and has impressed me with its food. The owner of the place Mr. Kaushik Saha is a great person to talk with, he is a man with a great vision and is already in process to come up with new things. Good luck to this lovely place and Kudos to the team.

I went in to take away a chilli pork dish. Firstly, they made me wait for 20-25 mins for a single dish. Secondly, the pork they served was very little in quantity. Usually pork dishes r shredded. This is the first time i am seeing pork being served in pieces. The preparation was also not good.

Its one of the best continental restaurant I had till date in Kolkata.Grilled chicken breast platter, virgin mojito, spaghetti and mozzarella cheese sticks are a must try. All the dishes were cooked to perfection and above all, we were 7 members after trying 9 items our bill came to 1200 approximately...which was a surprise and shock!..only negative point is that it doesn't have a wash room. But apart from that amazing place, good concept and yum yum food. So guys visit this place to try some.

I reserved tables for us over the phone. We reached a little late. we ordered
1. Chicken Stroganoff
2. Chicken Ala Kiev
3. Grilled¬† Chicken Breast
4. Grilled Prawn

I personally liked my prawns which I thought was done very well. The texture was succulent and had a tinge of smoky favour, something I never had the fortune of enjoying in the past.

Place was not difficult to locate, it was just a few meters from Siemens and Meghalaya House, Kasba.

Just one suggestion: Once a while some diners might want to use a rest room, perhaps you can seriously think about it now..

Thanks for a lovely dinner.

This place was in my wishlist for quite a long time. It is just 1 minute from acropolis mall if you are walking towards Gariahat.
The place is quite small with 4-5 tables. The decor is quite good.
We ordered Chicken Lollypop, Chicken and cheese omlette, grilled chicken breast and chicken ala keiv
Chicken lollypops were fantastic.perfectly cooked 6 crispy chicken legs. the meat was juicy and tender and the sauce was very tasty.good stuff
Chicken and cheese omlette was also very very tasty.the stuffing of cheese and omlette was delicious.quite filling
The star of the show was the grilled chicken breasts which tasted superb.Their style of plating really impressed me.The mushroom sauce was delicious and the chicken was tender
Chicken ala keiv was no less ...just how it is supposed to me made with all that butter exploding in your mouth. However the chicken was a bit unseasoned and tough.it could have been better.
The staff was nice and polite.
It doesnot burn a hole in your pocket. Very reasonable and complete value for money.Will surely visit again

Good continental food at decent prices. Went for lunch with office colleagues. Ordered Grilled chicken breasts and chicken stroganoff. Two grilled chicken fillet served with mushroom sauce alongside mashed potatoes, veggies tossed in herbs, salad and a couple of garlic breads. Chicken stroganoff too was served with these accompaniments. Both were extremely flavorful. Staff were courteous. Also this place has free Wi-Fi. Would love to visit again to try more of their dishes.

After seeing a lot of good reviews,I finally made up my mind to visit this place.If you are coming from Ruby,this joint will be on your right just a few metres after Acropolis.A very small joint with around 6 tables.AND WITH A LOT OF AQUARIUMS.Kinda weird.We ordered:-
1.Grilled Chicken Breast
2.Spaghetti Bolognese with bacon
3.Fresh lime soda
The fresh lime soda came seconds after we ordered.The grilled chicken is a must try.It's beautiful.It has 2 grilled breasts,covered in mushroom sauce.It comes with a side of buttered veggies,mashed potatoes and garlic bread.The garlic bread ¬†was exceptional.Too good.
We were a little disappointed with the spaghetti since the picture on zomato(as well as on their menu card) showed a greater quantity.It came with garlic bread too.Tasted good but a tad bit on the salty side.You gotta be really careful with your seasoning when it comes to bacon.The ambiance is nothing extra ordinary but the food is to die for.Will definitely come back again.

Me and my spouse visited this place recently at a stone through distance from our house in kasba. We ordered cheese omlette which was good. Next we had chicken tangri kebab which was best and could be compared with big brands, great taste. The downside was chelo kabab the rice was stiff and the kebabs are stiff and too much salty. I think the ambience is  perfect with all the big aquariums.  Next time we will try fish items.

How did I even think of ordering from here?..Not at all Value-for-money feel.
I ordered a Chelo Kabab where the kababs were stiff and the sunny side up was disastrously overcooked,turning it into an omelette..And the Non-veg Kabab platter-in one word "Horrid".The kababs were again as mentioned earlier,stiff..In addition,the prawn kababs were stale..The home-delivery also took hours..In totality,a complete No no.

I had actually availed the Little app and went to this place with my family, and I was really amazed to see the interior decor. It was so damn good! The food of course, is fab. The way the food looked is so good, that any one will want t take a dig in it. its that 'WOW'I mean, see the pictures.. You will know what I mean ^_^

That there is a finally a continental sit
- down restaurant option outside Acropolis mall (which is over saturated with Indian-Chinese and Mughlai options as it is) at a very reasonable price makes me super duper happy. I, for one, can't get over the initial elation that I can order in Spaghetti home instead of bored-to-death renditions of butter chickens and kung pao chickens.

The place has newly opened and is moderately decorated. Maa ordered a Fish Orangy, a hearty meal of bhetki fillets in an orange citrus sauce, set above creamy mashed potatoes, which was the best main course we had. It's sweetish, more than citrusy though, but balanced in flavour otherwise. 

My grilled chicken in mushroom sauce was also pretty good and is a close second. I would have liked if the chicken was softer and better marinated. The sauteed veggies, though winter ones like carrots and beans, were okay since they were non-seasonal, but I skipped the fresh salad, simply because  creamy mushroom sauce doesn't go with the rawness of the tomatoes and worse, the pungency of the olives (which goes well with light oil and vinegar based sauces). The best side dish that came with all the dishes was the super creamy potato, and that too in very generous portions. The garlic bread was okay-ish and needed more garlic flavour.

Baba ordered a grilled fish in mustard sauce, which came in last. Now the mustard sauce rightly used was the American unseasoned Djon mustard, but the local tastebuds used to a much Spicer Kasundi and all the innumerable Bengali Sorshe-combinations, might find it bland and very turmeric-ish. The sauce thus needs a look into and needs to be customised a bit. 

Finally, we wrapped up the meal with a brilliant dessert which was caramelised banana with ice cream dessert in caramel sauce. For a change, the caramel on the banana wasn't burnt and bitter and done perfectly light textured,coating the banana. The vanilla ice cream had the right amount of caramel - a very,very restrained drip of a few drops- which didn't allow the dessert, with so much caramel, to become overpoweringly sweet, and that itself is a culinary achievement ! I really recommend this dish. 

Overall, I quite liked the place. The place isn't quirky and fancy and all of that, but done up in typical family restaurant style with aquariums and yellow light bulbs on top and such. It gives a very warm middle-class endearingly familiar atmosphere, that isn't intimidating for my parents, for example. A place like Silver Platter, doesn't target the Chill's and Hoppipola crowd at Acropolis entirely and should work in Kasba food demography, since nobody seemed to capture the middle class family dining market. Plus, that the food is so cheap and priced inclusive of tax that will help it target its consumer group quite a bit. I see myself going back here with my family.

The Kasba-Ruby connector is slowly turning out to be a new business destination and there has been a mushrooming of eateries on that stretch. Whilst most of them offer run-of-the-mill Indian Chinese and tandoori, Silver Platter begs to be different. Silver Platter is the newest eatery to open up near Acropolis, right beside HDFC. This is a small quaint eatery with a rather delightful decor. Once you step inside, you realise that the walks house huge aquariums with an array of aquatic beings. This is certainly a welcome change from the monotonous graffiti or paintings that most small eateries these days come up with. It gives it a touch of class and makes it feel airy. 
Now coming to the most important part, the food. Silver Platter serves good continental food..period!! This is certainly a welcome change for foodies like me who want more than a plate full of biriyani or a highly spicy chilly chicken. On my three visits till day, I tried the grilled chicken steak with mushroom sauce, spaghetti bolognese and crunchy chicken burger.
I found the steak to be the best among the items I tried. Two perfectly grilled pieces of chicken with a creamy mushroom sauce..that wasn't too salty from the Mayo or the white sauce used...mashed potato, blanched veggies (including zucchini) and two slices of garlic bread. If this ain't filling enough, then I truly doubt what is. The presentation was good and attention was given to every single item on the platter. If I really have to nitpick something, I would say the chicken felt a tad bit stuff, but then it is really like nitpicking. The spaghetti bolognese was food, though there wasn't really a wow factor about it. But yea, the minced meat was rather good and bolognese sauce was yummy. But it was a bit too cheesy I felt which interrupted with the tangy and spicy flavours of the bolognese sauce. But hey, it's still really worth your money. 
The crunchy chicken burger was again a hit. Two giant pieces of fried chicken sandwiched between layers of cucumbers, onions, tomato and mayo. However can they didn't add lettuce which is a personal favourite and a big omission here seems to be the extra cheese or the cheese slice which most joints serve. The accompanying fries were brilliant. If you consider the price for the burger, INR 119/- and the serving size, you maybe tempted to think that you have been cheated for so long by a famous American fast food joint situated next door (well almost) and who pride on serving a great zinger burger. 
The best part about the place is the prices of the items. Most stuff on the menu will set you back by a little less than 250-300. Infact, a hearty meal for two will possibly cost you not more than 600-700. When you consider the price and the fact that Silver Platter is one of the only few restaurants serving decent and delectable continental fare in this part of the town, you may be tempted to become a fan:)
I wish the owners very best and hope they keep serving such good food at such affordable prices.

Silver platter is located beside HDFC bank near kasba new market.

‚òÜ3rd Visit at Nabami Durga Puja 2017‚òÜ

‚òÜAmbiance and Decor‚òÜ
Very nice decoration in lots of aquarium in the wall. All aquarium were filled with colorful fishes. The lighting, floor and sealing deco done with perfection.
Seating arrangements for 20-30 people in that small eatery.

‚òÜDrinks‚òÜ
Fresh Lime Soda (No Fizz+Bland)
Cindrella (very sweet)

‚òÜFood‚òÜ
Pork Chop was not tasty.
Fish Orangy was good but quantity wise very less.

‚òÜService‚òÜ
There was no other people at that time but the people over there attended us after 15 mins. Also the food and drinks came after 30 mins.

I will think twice before ordering and dine from Silver Platter again..

My walk down the memory lane of my undergraduate days came to a sudden stop next to compelling name, a food item that has lots of delicious memories attached, at a very unexpected location, its "Chelo Kebab" at Silver Platter, Kasba. 
So without any delay, made my entrance through the glass saloon door, wait...,one more surprise,....a very innovative theme of aqua world, which I don't remember seeing at any Kolkata restaurant so far. Menu card?? no not this time, its "Chelo Kebab" time tonight. While looking at the well themed aquarium and glassy mocktail bar, my instincts tells me its time to relish my cravings. Don't remember the last time I had a Chelo Kebab, but the spectacle of this platter looked more to it. Had Reshmi Kebab, Chiken Tikka, Chicken hariyali kebab and last but not the least The Mutton kebab, boss, it made my evening.....an amazing mutton kebab after a while. The quantity was too much for one single person and at an affordable price. At the end couldn't resist myself sipping from a mocktail glass....Cupid Fantasy it is.....a unique taste as its name.
Overall, its nice place to hang out and relish a wide variety of cuisines at an affordable price.

The place is very close to Acropolis mall in kasba. I went there with a couple of my friends for lunch. The place was very nicely decorated and was very clean, the service staff were very friendly. Now talking about the food, we ordered 'Grilled chicken breast' and 'Fish oranzy', both of them were very delicious and were very nicely cooked, the fish would just melt in our mouth. After this we ordered 'Caramelized banana ice cream' and 'Chocolate brownie ice cream' for dessert. The items are very evenly priced and the quality and quantity is justified. Overall a very good place to give your taste buds a continental touch.

One sultry evening I was casually strolling past this place, when the menu board caught my eye ... and it truly surprised me! Was this type of cuisine really possible at the prices stated?! Well, to find out first hand, I walked in, and believe me, felt awestruck!! The first thing that will catch your eye is the amazing interior decor...but wait, there are more surprises to come! The menu offers a wide range of surprises...from grilled chicken breast to chelo kabab and fish oranzzy to semolina crusted calamari to name a few! The restaurant offers predominantly continental and fusion food, an area which is consistently overlooked by the biriyani-roll-chowmein loving Calcuttans! I am surely re-visiting the Silver Platter, hungry for more!!

Me with one of my friend was planning to go to a pocket friendly restaurant in front of Acropolis Mall. Suddenly Yamraj came to our mind. Coming near Yamraj we saw another restaurant Silver platter in place of Yamraj. Being convinced by the outside menu and the prices we entered there. Decor was beautiful We ordered grilled club sandwich and one Semolina crusted calamari. Semolina Crusted Calamari was nothing but fried squid. Being a gastronome I would recommend this as a must eat recipe. The grilled club sandwich was served very well with french fries. More items will be added. Will visit and have other recipes soon.

A great place for a foodie and an aquatic world lover. One can dig into the delicious stuff such as kebabs from the menu and also enjoy the great ambience, or have a look at the fishes swimming around while chilling with a mocktail in hand. Pocket friendly too.
