I think the food is nice, but the place is congested and dingy. Well, they may not have any other options to revamp. I like their bengali cuisine very much
One intresting feature of this kind of restuarant - its cheap, and common man's place- where you have not much to spend, this place may save you from the fear of expense.

Good foods. But they take long time to serve. But few items are so oily but taste good. Oh...!!! One more thing here ambience is not good. The sitting system need a immediate change.

The only tasty item in this narrow eatery is its Fowl Cutlet which is dirt cheap & high on taste. Fish fry is so-so. Other items are just not palatable. Serving takes really long & the seating arrangement needs immediate attention. Well what to say you can't blame them too much either. With that much cheap food one cannot expect a quality service. But still it's in dire need of an makeover. After all it does have a heritage to be taken care off!!
