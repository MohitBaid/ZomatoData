A quiet comfortable place at the heart of the city. Located just below the Southern Plaza, it's not as posh as it is in appearance. We had the Hawaiian chicken salad which was almost a thousand calories and top notch, followed by Mushrooms with salt and pepper. The Grilled Chicken was a delight, dripping with butter and finger licking french fries with a gorgeous garlic dip! The chicken was a bit dry though. The Iced tea was pretty looking and was minty fresh, but was waayy too sugary. For dessert, the Toffee Banana and Baked Alaska(for 4 people) is highly recommended.

One of my friend suggested this place, so I decided to give it a try. But I had an horrible experience. The manager was so stubborn who was't accepting the feedback which we were giving. I wish I could give negative rating to this place. The only good thing about the restaurant is its location.

Visited Oceania on Nabami afternoon to enjoy their special Durga Puja 2017 grand buffet lunch . haven't visited here before but it was very easy locate on southern Avenue just beside Atlanta fitness centre n Devdoot Tower.The decor and ambience of the restaurant is very class n minimalistic.The manager welcomed us and showed us our seats.First in the complimentary drinks section there were 1) Virgin Mojito 2)Aam Pora Shorbot 2) Strawberry Blitz .I opted for virgin mojito.it was really well made.and the system was such that one can take the drink as many times as one chooses.this I liked very much.Then I went for the starters.It was Durga Puja special so the entire menu was Bengali cuisine.Starter section had-Begun Bhaja,AlooBhaja,Posto Bora,Bori Bhaja.well to a Bengali these are quite common starters but still I wanna give special mention to the posto Bora.it was made in a completely different way which tasted just fabulous.then coming to the veg main course section there were- Cholar Dal,Moong er Dal,Aloor Dom,Dhokar Dalna,Shukto.all these were made to their perfection.purely in Bengali style.though the Dhoka of Dhokar Dalna needed to be much tender.now in the non veg main course section-fish paturi,katla Kalia,ilish bhapa,mutton kasha, onion chicken,chingri (prawn) malaikari,mocha chingri.u can see that all the lipsmacking items were present in the menu.nothing left.and it is very difficult to satisfy a Bengali with Bengali food .but here is where Oceania deserve mention.every non veg item had its own special feature.the mutton kasha tasted just way beyond awesome.the chicken was so soft it melted in mouth.the bhetki paturi was made to its perfection.the fish was absolutely fresh n enriched in perfect ingredients.they probably serve the best ilish in town.i was a lil disappointed with the fish of Katla Kalia.the fish was over fried ,dats y it tasted hard.otherwise all right.the rice n bread section had-White Rice,Pulao,Kichu,Peas Kachori.the Pulao tasted sooo good,my god! N peas Kachori were served hot and fresh.no complaints.the staffs were very courteous and prompt in service.they cleared bone plate at regular intervals as well as re filled the buffet section as soon as it was emptied.Now coming to the dessert section there were items which were favorites of every Bengali.-Rosogolla,Sitabhog,Hot Malpoa,Payesh,Mango Pudding, .the rosogolla was very soft, Sitabhog was very tasty, Malpoa was fried in pure ghee,the Payesh was soo good,full with proper ingredients,cashew n kishmish.The Mango Pudding was the Show stopper of the day.it was soo heavenly.melted in mouth.tender and juicy.also there was vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce.Me  and my family thoroughly enjoyed the whole lunch buffet. per plate costing was ₹600(including tax).
only suggestions which I want to put forward is that the dinner plates need to be a little more big and comfortable to eat n hold.And the Restaurant needs to promote itself much more in Zomato or other media sections.Enjoyed my experience at Oceania,will surely visit again.Sorry I couldn't click picture of the main course as I was soo engrossed in having them.

Oceania is a quite so-so place, located in prime southern Avenue location. Went there a few times. Fish n chips is quite good though sometimes the quality of fish used, needs to be checked by the restaurant authority. Chinese main courses are good too. Didn't like their brownie at all.  Prices are ok.

Went there this February on Saraswati Puja with my friend. It was around 8 PM. We were both hungry and we actually walked to restaurant from lake mall. It was empty ,leaving just one couple having dinner.  We sat down and the staff attended us . We placed our order of two starters - one prawn and one chicken.  The ambiance was good but I prefer more of a less lit environment.  Decor was good overall. Place was quiet. Even though there were only one more customer , they took a bit of time too serve up the food. Prawns were good but oddly the chicken starter looked exactly the same as the prawn dish and was bit sour in taste.  We ordered mixed noodles and some Chinese chicken side dish which was pretty good. We ended the meal with Butter scotch for me and Choco brownie for her .  Brownie was warm and good.  As a whole Good, would visit again.

The restaurant as it looks from outside, will give u attract ur eyes n soul to have the food here. When u go inside, the decor, the cushioned sofa n jute tablecloth will give u a warm welcome n u may hope to get a fine dining experience. They do serve in steamed plates which u will find at very less places. For all these ambience I give them a perfect 5/5. But in terms of food the level of expectation drastically drops to 0.5 from 5.0! 
We had drums of heaven n Lat me kai. The sauce of drums of heaven was not tangy n Lat me kai was just fried chicken in a hard coating! We were disappointed but since we have already placed the main course so a sheer disaster was awaiting for our taste buds!
For the main course we ordered chilli garlic noodles, hakka chicken noodles n chicken fried rice. As side dish we chose sweet n sour chicken, lamb with mushroom in oyster sauce n garlic chicken. The noodles were so plain n simple that for a moment it seemed we r having food from footpath kiosks! We could not understand the taste of the lamb dish. Neither was it tasty nor blunt! In sweet n sour there was no pineapple, where it being one of the key ingredients. Garlic chicken was the only dish we found suitable to have with the rice.

Overall, it's a total waste of money for food here. Chinese cuisine in such a place could be so catastrophic was beyond our expectation! According to the taste of the dishes what they served the charges r over-priced at the same time...

It was a certain visit here. Me & my husband were passing by the Southern Avenue, & we were hungry. So we spotted this location and steeped into. it was 3:30 PM, & the place was absolutely empty. But the first impression was good due to its neat and clean environment with warmth welcome.

The price is absolutely fine according to food. We have Chicken Steak, Grilled Chicken, and One Pot Coffee. Both dishes were good in quantity and tasted well too. Specially the coffee was very good because I am quite finicky about taste of coffee, but I liked it so much.

May be it's not getting limelight so much, but it is seriously a good place to have your food anytime.

We went there on a friend's birthday. It's a small yet neat restaurant on southern avenue. At first we thought it would be a sea-food restaurant but later we discovered it's a multi-cuisine restaurant.
The interior is very soothing and cleverly decorated though it's not that much spacious.
We ordered several Indian and continental dishes. Almost all are well cooked and tasty.
Dhania murg and roasted chicken are worth mentioning. Biriyani was above average. My personal favourite was chicken stroganoff.

Oceania is easy to locate and reach. The first thing I noticed was the decor. Though a fairly small restaurant, it is neat and modern, and has a luxe feel. I reached when the restaurant had probably just opened, so there was no one else. The waiters were extremely well-behaved and helpful. I went there for takeaway,and ordered a soup while I waited. The hot and sour soup was indeed delicious, and I wish today was a winter afternoon - the soup would have been even more perfect! I loved the back mushroom rice. The chilli garlic lamb was a little too sweet for my liking, but then again, I should have probably asked before ordering. The drums of heaven were quite good too. I wish there was something a little bit more to the lamb and the chicken dishes - they were impressive, but missed the wow factor. But yes, the soup remains the highlight. I'll definitely go back to this place.
Followup: I'm not entirely sure when the restaurant opens, because I have tried 11.30 am, and 10.45 am, but both times, I found it closed. I suppose the place is never ready to serve at 12, despite the timing given at Zomato.

Well i had some want to go to this restaurant since i went to my gym there...that too almost a few years ago....but it disappointed...
The interior was good...but the interior cannot make u a special one untill and unless u provide a mediokar food atleast...
There were crispy chilli baby corn, chicken hakka and chicken fried rice, and a chicken side dish...none of them tasted good except baby corn which was a bit good....
The staffs were also not polite...we were having some important conversation as we were havng our food...suddnly a waiter came and asked if we needed nethng more in desserts...now my qustion is "we were before the halfway of our food and how the hell will we know whether our apetite can take more food or not? Reason of asking??r kitchen getting closed...now this is a very bad thing...when some people are eating, some restaurnats dont have the courtesy to keep the kitchen open till they are finished...Neways, we ordered a caramel custurd... Trust me, we couldn't even eat two spoons of that..it was so damn tasteless...
I will suggest never go to this place..nd the prices are even high...so avoid it...

This multicuisine restaurant on Southern Avenue has a very good ambience. It has a glass frontage and is nice and bright. It is not very big but one is assured of a table. I don't know why but it seems that many don't come here.Surprisingly for the location and food. The food itself is reasonably good,moreover one has a wide variety of choice.

This place underwent a redecoration and somewhere in the process I think they lost the quality of their food. Earlier, they had a fantastic bar, which has been shifted now. I had n amazing experience the last time I went there. But this time was sadly disappointing. 
Nothing tasted good. Manchow soup was so bad that I don't think I'll ever be able to order it anywhere. North indian food that we ordered was also moderate. 
Their only redemption was Veg Gratin with garlic bread. Enriched with cream & cheese, it was absolutely delicious 😝

This multicuisine restaurant is located at Southern Avenue..right by the main road.It looks very bright and attractive from outside and true to its appearance the place is very well decorated and has a bright and attractive feel to it. Seats are also comfortable..but the most important criteria for a restaurant i.e the food really falls short of expectations. We had ordered sweet corn soup and chicken lat me kai..soup was ok..but the lat me kai really disappointed me..it did not have that crunchy feel to it as it normally has at other places. And consideting the quality of food it is slightly overpriced..overall a place which might be skipped taking into account the numerous options one has out here.

I often passed by this restaurant wondering how it was. Then I took a chance. The car I could easily and safely park under the watchful eyes of the doorman. Then I stepped inside. The restaurant is large and beautifully decorated. But there was no customer at that time.There was only one staff at that time and he greeted me. It was a hot afternoon so I decided to try some cool beverage and a snack. The staff suggested cucumber and mint juice and Chinese bhel for me. I agreed. The Chinese bhel was wonderfully crunchy and tasty but the quantity was too much for me. Though I was hungry, I couldn't eat so much. The juice the staff made himself in front of my eyes. Apart from cucumber and mint, there was lemon juice in it too. It was perfect, in tall glass and not too sweet. I fell in love with it and had it not for my full stomach due to Chinese bhel, I would have ordered one more of it.
The next time I took my mother. The front restaurant was alas being renovated so we were made to go by the back and take stairs up to avail of the restaurant, which was an ordeal for mother. It was evening, but the customers were yet to turn in. We were greeted by the only staff there. We ordered Chinese bhel but was told that it was not available at that hour. Then we ordered fish fry which was nothing extraordinary. Okay. Both took coffee, which was warm and good to taste. Not a bad place. Would return there.

Just located near Menoka Cinemas,on Southern Avenue,Oceania is one of my favorite restaurants in this area.The place is well decorated,(too much lights probably),the waiters are well behaved and the Menu is extensive.On my last visit I ordered Fish finger,Biriyani,Mutton Do Piaza,Mutton Kassa and Naan.Every dish was well made,with good quantity.The fish finger is really good,and they serve it with mayo and french fries! The place remains always relatively empty,probably because of the lack of a bar!However if you want a good Multi-cuisine Restaurant near Southern Avenue,give Oceania a try!

To begin with , the place is a discovery.Tucked away amidst the beautiful greenery of Southern Avenue , it's a classy, compact food lounge of the bigger hotel Southern Plaza  and houses some of the most authentic continental dishes one can come across in the city. The Fried Fish and Hawaiian Salad are worth going gaga over . The desert menu boasts of delicacies like the chocolate Monte Carlo and Caramel Custard. So it might be a bit limited but each dish is unique .My personal favourite is the Stroganoff and Fried Fish , followed by some Caramel Custard . The ambience is relaxing with soothing music and mild decor . The service is almost efficient since the food takes a bit of time to get delivered .But hey, you wait for good things ! Chinese and North Indian cuisine is highly commendable but the Continental savouries steal the show . Bit of a pocket pinch but it should definitely be on any foodie's bucket list !

Let me start with the place itself....it's a 30 seater multicuisine restaurant tucked under a hotel on Southern Avenue....peaceful area with ample car parking. Interiors are tastefully done but the issue is mosquito-strange but true considering the plush interiors. You need to request them to switch on the mosquito repellent. Next is the food ...if you happen to visit during the peak time/season (as we were on the Poila Baishakh day), your waiting time can be endless. We started with soup (cream of chicken and sweet corn for my kids)...should say very tasty. This was followed by fish and chips- horrendous- the fish was smelling and uncooked, though the outside was crispy and brown...immediately complained and was replaced by chicken reshmi kebab-very succulent and tasty. Must try the dal makhani and chicken butter masala (we decided not to go beyond the ordinary here). But the entire serving time was almost 2 hours and during this time I had to literally beg them to serve the food.
The manager and the waiters are well behaved, though constantly talking to each other on their personal matters/duty hours, which is not pleasant to hear.
Overall pretty average service and average food...go only if you want to kill some time...else Kolkata is not short of efficient food joints.

I went at a non peak hour around 7 30 pm. I was served very elegantly. The food tasted fresh. The cook was putting his effort in doing a good job. 
I am looking forward to go for their dessert next time. I found the food quantity quite good and they should keep their standards up. 
Looking to visit again soon at their peak hours to know if they are really good at their job.

Beside this the rest of the food is average and overpriced campared to its quality...
Like a person is ready to pay Rs.350 for a plate of Reshmi Kebab provided he receives the proper level of satisfaction from the food...

For my birthday  lunch went there with my family and my bestie. And now I can say that I have found a favourite restaurant in Kolkata.

It's in the Southern Plaza on Southern Avenue opposite United Commercial Bank. The decor was pretty good and the waiters were courteous enough to suggest that 2 plates of rice would suffice when  we were thinking of ordering 3.
 I really do hope they get some good music there too the next time.

We got crispy chilli baby corn  for starters, zafrani moti polao, subj jhalfrezi, murg reshmi butter masala and kadai murg. Everything was cooked nicely but a special mention must go to the moti polao, I have not tasted anything like it anywhere (in a good way). For desert we got the chocolate montecarlo and pista ice-cream and of course I had the montecarlo but I did later wish that I shared it with someone because it was just huge, delicious but huge. 

Overall it was a good dining experience, not to mention the fact that it's reasonable too.

Oceania, being a multicuisine restaurant in Southern avenue, is nothing extravagant but eventually gives you a decent dining experience at pocket friendly prices.

It might look small from first view but could accommodate a lot of people. The decor is basic but music is not that great. The staff is pretty warm, polite but i felt they lacked finesse. The service time is bit long but i am personally cool with that. Overall ambiance lacked to some extent.

Coming to food i tried the north indian food as was suggested by the restaurant and loved the food. The kebabs tasted pretty good especially the seekh kebab. Soups were pretty good and contents seemed very fresh ad of good quality. The vegetables were superb and i loved the black dal. Tried the moti zaffrani pulao which was pretty nice although could have had more flavours of saffron. 

Overall loved the food here with top notch food ingredients and preparations  and felt the prices were reasonable with a small compromise on ambiance front.

They don't even deserve a one!! It's really sad that a place which serves such amazing food is run by cheating lying management!! It's a rude shock when being a regular there you are met with such disrespectful treatment!! On a Saturday night, as per our previous visits, we landed up there a group of 10 hoping to have a great dinner. Upon entering we let the waiter know that we have a solitaire card and would avail the discount! While placing the order we were also informed that there's only a veg biriyani. The dinner went up as usual. When we asked for the bill they refused to give us the solitaire discount saying it's valid for a group of 6 only! When we asked them to show the conditions they took 15 mins to show us the offer from telegraph which strangely looked like it was printed a minute ago and had no logo of either abp or solitaire! 

Had such been the case they could have informed us at the very beginning and let us know that we are not eligible for the offer had there been any such condition in the first place. 

Then came the worst of all. We had packed the leftover biriyani and the waiter had the audacity of saying " yeh log ko chicken biriyani khana hai bas. Le jao humlog kisika jhootha nai khate." 

Never in my life have I been this disrespected by any management!! Never will I set foot again in oceania!! Now I understand why the place is always deserted!! It doesn't even deserve a single customer!! 

Ask me stay away.. There are better place where they don't lie and serve even better food!!

Been there a couple of times and what really fascinated me is that the food quality remains the same even during Durga Puja. We went in a large group and ordered a mix of mughlai, continental and chinese cuisine, all of which were good. The chicken stroganoff was quite heavy and could have been served with butter rice instead of the rice that they serve. Roast chicken was good and so were the lamb and pan fried fish starters. Reshmi kababs were soft and juicy and all of these were served with a smile. Great going! 

We had Chocolate Montecarlo for the desserts. I would suggest that you share this with a friend since this one's difficult to finish on your own.

This was a very pleasant surprise for my family. Once returning by Southern Avenue our regular joint Kimli was closed and we found this place out. Never too much in rush always has a place for four or more. The ambiance is neat, clean and choice ably done. Service is humble and polite but it does take 15 mins or so for the order to arrive the table.
Now the Food -- my family is a chinese lover so review for their chinese servings only:
 Chicken Satay for starters is very nice! Soup -- order any and they are good to the taste buds and the aroma is pleasing.
Main course -- we never fail to order the Pan Fried Mixed Noodles -- it is excellent!!! Excellent!! 
Whether you like chicken/ prawn/ mutton in oyster sauce / hoysin sauce / dry fried --- all of them will cater to your chinese liking for sure.
Their mocktails and fruit cocktail dessert is also very nice.
We always have lovely time there and their reasonably priced menu makes us visit more than twice a month. 
A must try !!! :)

--------another time----------

Went to Oceania again!! adding few pics.

This time tried their Satay chicken and it was Goood with that yum peanut butter sauce!! Excellent. Their Pan Fried fish was awesome too !
I simply love this place.
Recommend, recommend, recommend!!!!

We came here for dinner yesterday.. very nicely done, interiors are quite classy. We ordered one hot and sour soup, virgin mojitos, for starters we took crispy chilli babycorn and chilly paneer. For main course we had bakkarkhani, fish amritsari masala, kadhai murg and subz jalfrezi. The portions were more than we expected, each and every dish was brilliant. Chicken was soft and succulent and found their speciality roti very crispy and different (in a good way !) Staff was sweet and friendly and we were more than full at the end of our meal but couldnt resist the dessert section so went for chocolate montecarlo. My my, it was divine ! Layers of sweetness and awesomeness. They are very generous with quantity so i'll recommend it highly ! And so many things were quite easy on our pockets so yeah, I'll visit this place again !

Good work guys :)

Well, I hang out with my cousins a lot and since we all love to hog, we keep trying different restaurants. So one day we went to Oceania to celebrate my brother's anniversary. The place looked quite a good and the ambience was very nice. The waiters came after a while to take the order and we chose all kinds of stuff, ranging from chicken to lamb. The food was quite good and the service was prompt. The place was well maintained. However, must put in a special word about the desserts. They were just awesome. Starting from the presentation to the taste, it was absolutely delightful.

Having read great reviews on Zomato for Oceania, I'd been looking forward to coming here. So I was really happy when a friend and I decided on Oceania as our spot for lunch last Sunday! 
The place is tucked away in a quiet part of Southern Avenue. The decor is very colourful and cheerful; we felt welcome the moment we walked through the door. The staff greeted us courteously and we were soon seated in a cosy corner. The restaurant is on the small side, but that's nice in a way - less din from other patrons. We ordered chicken reshmi kebab, paneer butter masala and butter naan, and two Pepsis. 
The food was served soon enough, and came piping hot. The kebabs were nice but pretty average, on the whole - nothing out of the way. The paneer, on the other hand, was surprisingly delicious - large chunks lightly fried and coated in a creamy tomato gravy. The naan was soft and buttery and went great with the paneer. The only problem was the quantity of the paneer - there simply wasn't enough for two people (and we were pretty hungry) so we had to order another. And then we had a hard time finishing the whole if the second! If they could just increase the amount per plate, it would suffice for two people. With all these items, our bill came to INR 872 - not cheap, but not exorbitant either. 
Apart from the quantity issue, I loved everything about Oceania. The bright decor, the cheery ambience, the quality of the food, the service...everything is spot on. I'm definitely coming back for more! Thank you, Oceania! :)

This is a complete crap restaurant. I went to this place with my girlfriend a couple of months ago. I ordered fried fish and grilled chicken. There was a foul smell in the so called "fresh fried fish". The grilled chicken was also mediocre. When I called the restaurant staff they took away the fish after a small argument. We didn't order anything else after that horrific experience and decided to go to some other nice restro so that we can get rid of the trauma. They didn't have the courtesy to exclude the rotten item which they served from the bill. They compensated the same with a single (that to very small) scoop of vanilla ice cream. To make things worse, the food is pretty costly. I would never visit the place anytime in my life and would also suggest people who are planning to go there, to completely avoid it. There are other good continental restaurants in Kolkata, who are atleast not CHEATS.

It's been quite long since I have been to this place. However, the White sauce pasta is still stuck in my head. It is delicious.

The notable thing about this place is that both, the Italian & Indian fare taste quite Nice. There isn't a dish which I did not like. I speak of the Vegetarian dishes.

The ambiance is also very soothing and elegant. The staff are quite warm in their approach.

The only downside is the pocket pinch. I wish it could be lower so that I could be tempted to go there more often.

Have only tried the continental menu (haven't tried the Indian and Chinese cuisines), and my rating goes to them only on that basis. And I can vouch for the continental dishes they serve.... just awesome, precisely, each one of them.

We took the Hawaiian Salad, Stroganoff (Chicken), Pasta Al Frado (fusilli) and Chicken Steak with Pepper Sauce. Each one of the dishes was sheer orgasm for the taste buds... and the quantities were also pretty big. The continental cuisine of Oceania is at par with those that I've found in a number of renowned restaurants of Europe & the US. This is definitely a place I look forward to visiting again.

The service was good (slightly on the slower side may be). The decor is decent, though nothing to go gaga about. The ambience is good.

Overall, I strongly recommend this place.

The place had been recommended by a friend for Chinese food so when we finally managed to make it here that is exactly what we decided to try
. 
The place is quite small but brightly done up and the staff is quite courteous

The Black Mushroom fried rice and the Vegetables in Szechwan sauce were outstanding.
The rice was nicely flavoured with enough sprinkling of black mushrooms and the combination with szechwan sauce vegetables turned out to be too good
The Chilly gartlic fried Noodles were standard fare but the Stir fried vegetable, cottage cheese & mushrooms in Coriander sauce was a refreshingly nice item

All in all really liked the place. Would like to try the Indian cuisine another day

A quiet corner in the heart of the city. 
Food here is top-notch,both quality and quantity wise. 
My favourites here are the Fried Fish & Chips and Chicken Stroganoff. The former one consists of 4 sizable pieces,fries and coleslaw which is more than enough for two people.One can even pair it up with a basket of toast that gets served with jam,butter and olive oil. Proves to be an amazing combination.
The Stroganoff is again pretty heavy for a single person but amazingly tasteful.
End it with Monte Carlo or Frozen Alaska.
Though the food is good,it has only a very restricted clientele and thus is generally empty on most days.. which actually suits me fine. 
Service is a bit slow though.

A quiet comfortable place at the heart of the city. Located just below the Southern Plaza, it's not as posh as it is in appearance. We had the Hawaiian chicken salad which was almost a thousand calories and top notch, followed by Mushrooms with salt and pepper. The Grilled Chicken was a delight, dripping with butter and finger licking french fries with a gorgeous garlic dip! The chicken was a bit dry though. The Iced tea was pretty looking and was minty fresh, but was waayy too sugary. For dessert, the Toffee Banana and Baked Alaska(for 4 people) is highly recommended.

Visited Oceania on Nabami afternoon to enjoy their special Durga Puja 2017 grand buffet lunch . haven't visited here before but it was very easy locate on southern Avenue just beside Atlanta fitness centre n Devdoot Tower.The decor and ambience of the restaurant is very class n minimalistic.The manager welcomed us and showed us our seats.First in the complimentary drinks section there were 1) Virgin Mojito 2)Aam Pora Shorbot 2) Strawberry Blitz .I opted for virgin mojito.it was really well made.and the system was such that one can take the drink as many times as one chooses.this I liked very much.Then I went for the starters.It was Durga Puja special so the entire menu was Bengali cuisine.Starter section had-Begun Bhaja,AlooBhaja,Posto Bora,Bori Bhaja.well to a Bengali these are quite common starters but still I wanna give special mention to the posto Bora.it was made in a completely different way which tasted just fabulous.then coming to the veg main course section there were- Cholar Dal,Moong er Dal,Aloor Dom,Dhokar Dalna,Shukto.all these were made to their perfection.purely in Bengali style.though the Dhoka of Dhokar Dalna needed to be much tender.now in the non veg main course section-fish paturi,katla Kalia,ilish bhapa,mutton kasha, onion chicken,chingri (prawn) malaikari,mocha chingri.u can see that all the lipsmacking items were present in the menu.nothing left.and it is very difficult to satisfy a Bengali with Bengali food .but here is where Oceania deserve mention.every non veg item had its own special feature.the mutton kasha tasted just way beyond awesome.the chicken was so soft it melted in mouth.the bhetki paturi was made to its perfection.the fish was absolutely fresh n enriched in perfect ingredients.they probably serve the best ilish in town.i was a lil disappointed with the fish of Katla Kalia.the fish was over fried ,dats y it tasted hard.otherwise all right.the rice n bread section had-White Rice,Pulao,Kichu,Peas Kachori.the Pulao tasted sooo good,my god! N peas Kachori were served hot and fresh.no complaints.the staffs were very courteous and prompt in service.they cleared bone plate at regular intervals as well as re filled the buffet section as soon as it was emptied.Now coming to the dessert section there were items which were favorites of every Bengali.-Rosogolla,Sitabhog,Hot Malpoa,Payesh,Mango Pudding, .the rosogolla was very soft, Sitabhog was very tasty, Malpoa was fried in pure ghee,the Payesh was soo good,full with proper ingredients,cashew n kishmish.The Mango Pudding was the Show stopper of the day.it was soo heavenly.melted in mouth.tender and juicy.also there was vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce.Me  and my family thoroughly enjoyed the whole lunch buffet. per plate costing was ₹600(including tax).
only suggestions which I want to put forward is that the dinner plates need to be a little more big and comfortable to eat n hold.And the Restaurant needs to promote itself much more in Zomato or other media sections.Enjoyed my experience at Oceania,will surely visit again.Sorry I couldn't click picture of the main course as I was soo engrossed in having them.

Oceania is a quite so-so place, located in prime southern Avenue location. Went there a few times. Fish n chips is quite good though sometimes the quality of fish used, needs to be checked by the restaurant authority. Chinese main courses are good too. Didn't like their brownie at all.  Prices are ok.

Went there this February on Saraswati Puja with my friend. It was around 8 PM. We were both hungry and we actually walked to restaurant from lake mall. It was empty ,leaving just one couple having dinner.  We sat down and the staff attended us . We placed our order of two starters - one prawn and one chicken.  The ambiance was good but I prefer more of a less lit environment.  Decor was good overall. Place was quiet. Even though there were only one more customer , they took a bit of time too serve up the food. Prawns were good but oddly the chicken starter looked exactly the same as the prawn dish and was bit sour in taste.  We ordered mixed noodles and some Chinese chicken side dish which was pretty good. We ended the meal with Butter scotch for me and Choco brownie for her .  Brownie was warm and good.  As a whole Good, would visit again.

The restaurant as it looks from outside, will give u attract ur eyes n soul to have the food here. When u go inside, the decor, the cushioned sofa n jute tablecloth will give u a warm welcome n u may hope to get a fine dining experience. They do serve in steamed plates which u will find at very less places. For all these ambience I give them a perfect 5/5. But in terms of food the level of expectation drastically drops to 0.5 from 5.0! 
We had drums of heaven n Lat me kai. The sauce of drums of heaven was not tangy n Lat me kai was just fried chicken in a hard coating! We were disappointed but since we have already placed the main course so a sheer disaster was awaiting for our taste buds!
For the main course we ordered chilli garlic noodles, hakka chicken noodles n chicken fried rice. As side dish we chose sweet n sour chicken, lamb with mushroom in oyster sauce n garlic chicken. The noodles were so plain n simple that for a moment it seemed we r having food from footpath kiosks! We could not understand the taste of the lamb dish. Neither was it tasty nor blunt! In sweet n sour there was no pineapple, where it being one of the key ingredients. Garlic chicken was the only dish we found suitable to have with the rice.

Overall, it's a total waste of money for food here. Chinese cuisine in such a place could be so catastrophic was beyond our expectation! According to the taste of the dishes what they served the charges r over-priced at the same time...

It was a certain visit here. Me & my husband were passing by the Southern Avenue, & we were hungry. So we spotted this location and steeped into. it was 3:30 PM, & the place was absolutely empty. But the first impression was good due to its neat and clean environment with warmth welcome.

The price is absolutely fine according to food. We have Chicken Steak, Grilled Chicken, and One Pot Coffee. Both dishes were good in quantity and tasted well too. Specially the coffee was very good because I am quite finicky about taste of coffee, but I liked it so much.

May be it's not getting limelight so much, but it is seriously a good place to have your food anytime.

We went there on a friend's birthday. It's a small yet neat restaurant on southern avenue. At first we thought it would be a sea-food restaurant but later we discovered it's a multi-cuisine restaurant.
The interior is very soothing and cleverly decorated though it's not that much spacious.
We ordered several Indian and continental dishes. Almost all are well cooked and tasty.
Dhania murg and roasted chicken are worth mentioning. Biriyani was above average. My personal favourite was chicken stroganoff.

Oceania is easy to locate and reach. The first thing I noticed was the decor. Though a fairly small restaurant, it is neat and modern, and has a luxe feel. I reached when the restaurant had probably just opened, so there was no one else. The waiters were extremely well-behaved and helpful. I went there for takeaway,and ordered a soup while I waited. The hot and sour soup was indeed delicious, and I wish today was a winter afternoon - the soup would have been even more perfect! I loved the back mushroom rice. The chilli garlic lamb was a little too sweet for my liking, but then again, I should have probably asked before ordering. The drums of heaven were quite good too. I wish there was something a little bit more to the lamb and the chicken dishes - they were impressive, but missed the wow factor. But yes, the soup remains the highlight. I'll definitely go back to this place.
Followup: I'm not entirely sure when the restaurant opens, because I have tried 11.30 am, and 10.45 am, but both times, I found it closed. I suppose the place is never ready to serve at 12, despite the timing given at Zomato.

Well i had some want to go to this restaurant since i went to my gym there...that too almost a few years ago....but it disappointed...
The interior was good...but the interior cannot make u a special one untill and unless u provide a mediokar food atleast...
There were crispy chilli baby corn, chicken hakka and chicken fried rice, and a chicken side dish...none of them tasted good except baby corn which was a bit good....
The staffs were also not polite...we were having some important conversation as we were havng our food...suddnly a waiter came and asked if we needed nethng more in desserts...now my qustion is "we were before the halfway of our food and how the hell will we know whether our apetite can take more food or not? Reason of asking??r kitchen getting closed...now this is a very bad thing...when some people are eating, some restaurnats dont have the courtesy to keep the kitchen open till they are finished...Neways, we ordered a caramel custurd... Trust me, we couldn't even eat two spoons of that..it was so damn tasteless...
I will suggest never go to this place..nd the prices are even high...so avoid it...

This multicuisine restaurant on Southern Avenue has a very good ambience. It has a glass frontage and is nice and bright. It is not very big but one is assured of a table. I don't know why but it seems that many don't come here.Surprisingly for the location and food. The food itself is reasonably good,moreover one has a wide variety of choice.

This place underwent a redecoration and somewhere in the process I think they lost the quality of their food. Earlier, they had a fantastic bar, which has been shifted now. I had n amazing experience the last time I went there. But this time was sadly disappointing. 
Nothing tasted good. Manchow soup was so bad that I don't think I'll ever be able to order it anywhere. North indian food that we ordered was also moderate. 
Their only redemption was Veg Gratin with garlic bread. Enriched with cream & cheese, it was absolutely delicious 😝

This multicuisine restaurant is located at Southern Avenue..right by the main road.It looks very bright and attractive from outside and true to its appearance the place is very well decorated and has a bright and attractive feel to it. Seats are also comfortable..but the most important criteria for a restaurant i.e the food really falls short of expectations. We had ordered sweet corn soup and chicken lat me kai..soup was ok..but the lat me kai really disappointed me..it did not have that crunchy feel to it as it normally has at other places. And consideting the quality of food it is slightly overpriced..overall a place which might be skipped taking into account the numerous options one has out here.

I often passed by this restaurant wondering how it was. Then I took a chance. The car I could easily and safely park under the watchful eyes of the doorman. Then I stepped inside. The restaurant is large and beautifully decorated. But there was no customer at that time.There was only one staff at that time and he greeted me. It was a hot afternoon so I decided to try some cool beverage and a snack. The staff suggested cucumber and mint juice and Chinese bhel for me. I agreed. The Chinese bhel was wonderfully crunchy and tasty but the quantity was too much for me. Though I was hungry, I couldn't eat so much. The juice the staff made himself in front of my eyes. Apart from cucumber and mint, there was lemon juice in it too. It was perfect, in tall glass and not too sweet. I fell in love with it and had it not for my full stomach due to Chinese bhel, I would have ordered one more of it.
The next time I took my mother. The front restaurant was alas being renovated so we were made to go by the back and take stairs up to avail of the restaurant, which was an ordeal for mother. It was evening, but the customers were yet to turn in. We were greeted by the only staff there. We ordered Chinese bhel but was told that it was not available at that hour. Then we ordered fish fry which was nothing extraordinary. Okay. Both took coffee, which was warm and good to taste. Not a bad place. Would return there.

Just located near Menoka Cinemas,on Southern Avenue,Oceania is one of my favorite restaurants in this area.The place is well decorated,(too much lights probably),the waiters are well behaved and the Menu is extensive.On my last visit I ordered Fish finger,Biriyani,Mutton Do Piaza,Mutton Kassa and Naan.Every dish was well made,with good quantity.The fish finger is really good,and they serve it with mayo and french fries! The place remains always relatively empty,probably because of the lack of a bar!However if you want a good Multi-cuisine Restaurant near Southern Avenue,give Oceania a try!

To begin with , the place is a discovery.Tucked away amidst the beautiful greenery of Southern Avenue , it's a classy, compact food lounge of the bigger hotel Southern Plaza  and houses some of the most authentic continental dishes one can come across in the city. The Fried Fish and Hawaiian Salad are worth going gaga over . The desert menu boasts of delicacies like the chocolate Monte Carlo and Caramel Custard. So it might be a bit limited but each dish is unique .My personal favourite is the Stroganoff and Fried Fish , followed by some Caramel Custard . The ambience is relaxing with soothing music and mild decor . The service is almost efficient since the food takes a bit of time to get delivered .But hey, you wait for good things ! Chinese and North Indian cuisine is highly commendable but the Continental savouries steal the show . Bit of a pocket pinch but it should definitely be on any foodie's bucket list !

Oceania I believe is the only restaurent in southern avenue where all three like quality, quantity and service is maintained, a person can be sure that if he or she is visting here will surely enjoy there food without being hassled.
One should must visit this restaurent.

Tip :- Here chinese is really very good.

Let me start with the place itself....it's a 30 seater multicuisine restaurant tucked under a hotel on Southern Avenue....peaceful area with ample car parking. Interiors are tastefully done but the issue is mosquito-strange but true considering the plush interiors. You need to request them to switch on the mosquito repellent. Next is the food ...if you happen to visit during the peak time/season (as we were on the Poila Baishakh day), your waiting time can be endless. We started with soup (cream of chicken and sweet corn for my kids)...should say very tasty. This was followed by fish and chips- horrendous- the fish was smelling and uncooked, though the outside was crispy and brown...immediately complained and was replaced by chicken reshmi kebab-very succulent and tasty. Must try the dal makhani and chicken butter masala (we decided not to go beyond the ordinary here). But the entire serving time was almost 2 hours and during this time I had to literally beg them to serve the food.
The manager and the waiters are well behaved, though constantly talking to each other on their personal matters/duty hours, which is not pleasant to hear.
Overall pretty average service and average food...go only if you want to kill some time...else Kolkata is not short of efficient food joints.

I am looking forward to go for their dessert next time. I found the food quantity quite good and they should keep their standards up. 
Looking to visit again soon at their peak hours to know if they are really good at their job.

For my birthday  lunch went there with my family and my bestie. And now I can say that I have found a favourite restaurant in Kolkata.

It's in the Southern Plaza on Southern Avenue opposite United Commercial Bank. The decor was pretty good and the waiters were courteous enough to suggest that 2 plates of rice would suffice when  we were thinking of ordering 3.
 I really do hope they get some good music there too the next time.

We got crispy chilli baby corn  for starters, zafrani moti polao, subj jhalfrezi, murg reshmi butter masala and kadai murg. Everything was cooked nicely but a special mention must go to the moti polao, I have not tasted anything like it anywhere (in a good way). For desert we got the chocolate montecarlo and pista ice-cream and of course I had the montecarlo but I did later wish that I shared it with someone because it was just huge, delicious but huge. 

Overall it was a good dining experience, not to mention the fact that it's reasonable too.

Oceania, being a multicuisine restaurant in Southern avenue, is nothing extravagant but eventually gives you a decent dining experience at pocket friendly prices.

It might look small from first view but could accommodate a lot of people. The decor is basic but music is not that great. The staff is pretty warm, polite but i felt they lacked finesse. The service time is bit long but i am personally cool with that. Overall ambiance lacked to some extent.

Coming to food i tried the north indian food as was suggested by the restaurant and loved the food. The kebabs tasted pretty good especially the seekh kebab. Soups were pretty good and contents seemed very fresh ad of good quality. The vegetables were superb and i loved the black dal. Tried the moti zaffrani pulao which was pretty nice although could have had more flavours of saffron. 

Overall loved the food here with top notch food ingredients and preparations  and felt the prices were reasonable with a small compromise on ambiance front.

They don't even deserve a one!! It's really sad that a place which serves such amazing food is run by cheating lying management!! It's a rude shock when being a regular there you are met with such disrespectful treatment!! On a Saturday night, as per our previous visits, we landed up there a group of 10 hoping to have a great dinner. Upon entering we let the waiter know that we have a solitaire card and would avail the discount! While placing the order we were also informed that there's only a veg biriyani. The dinner went up as usual. When we asked for the bill they refused to give us the solitaire discount saying it's valid for a group of 6 only! When we asked them to show the conditions they took 15 mins to show us the offer from telegraph which strangely looked like it was printed a minute ago and had no logo of either abp or solitaire! 

Had such been the case they could have informed us at the very beginning and let us know that we are not eligible for the offer had there been any such condition in the first place. 

Then came the worst of all. We had packed the leftover biriyani and the waiter had the audacity of saying " yeh log ko chicken biriyani khana hai bas. Le jao humlog kisika jhootha nai khate." 

Never in my life have I been this disrespected by any management!! Never will I set foot again in oceania!! Now I understand why the place is always deserted!! It doesn't even deserve a single customer!! 

Ask me stay away.. There are better place where they don't lie and serve even better food!!

Been there a couple of times and what really fascinated me is that the food quality remains the same even during Durga Puja. We went in a large group and ordered a mix of mughlai, continental and chinese cuisine, all of which were good. The chicken stroganoff was quite heavy and could have been served with butter rice instead of the rice that they serve. Roast chicken was good and so were the lamb and pan fried fish starters. Reshmi kababs were soft and juicy and all of these were served with a smile. Great going! 

We had Chocolate Montecarlo for the desserts. I would suggest that you share this with a friend since this one's difficult to finish on your own.

Had such been the case they could have informed us at the very beginning and let us know that we are not eligible for the offer had there been any such condition in the first place. 

Then came the worst of all. We had packed the leftover biriyani and the waiter had the audacity of saying " yeh log ko chicken biriyani khana hai bas. Le jao humlog kisika jhootha nai khate." 

Never in my life have I been this disrespected by any management!! Never will I set foot again in oceania!! Now I understand why the place is always deserted!! It doesn't even deserve a single customer!! 

Ask me stay away.. There are better place where they don't lie and serve even better food!!

We went to oceania on 2nd october. The food they served was quite good. However, they took a lot of time to serve the food. We had to wait for over an hour.

Been there a couple of times and what really fascinated me is that the food quality remains the same even during Durga Puja. We went in a large group and ordered a mix of mughlai, continental and chinese cuisine, all of which were good. The chicken stroganoff was quite heavy and could have been served with butter rice instead of the rice that they serve. Roast chicken was good and so were the lamb and pan fried fish starters. Reshmi kababs were soft and juicy and all of these were served with a smile. Great going! 

We had Chocolate Montecarlo for the desserts. I would suggest that you share this with a friend since this one's difficult to finish on your own.

I had never heard about it ever. Its was through Zomato I came to know about it. So it was a suprise for me as well as my girlfriend as it was our 1st Date.  The ambience was very nice and food quality was outstanding. The employees were very polite as well. I would love to go over and over again

Quality & quantity of food served is good, more or less satisfied, but I feel there is room for improvement in the quality of service & there needs to be better co-ordination among the waiters.

This was a very pleasant surprise for my family. Once returning by Southern Avenue our regular joint Kimli was closed and we found this place out. Never too much in rush always has a place for four or more. The ambiance is neat, clean and choice ably done. Service is humble and polite but it does take 15 mins or so for the order to arrive the table.
Now the Food -- my family is a chinese lover so review for their chinese servings only:
 Chicken Satay for starters is very nice! Soup -- order any and they are good to the taste buds and the aroma is pleasing.
Main course -- we never fail to order the Pan Fried Mixed Noodles -- it is excellent!!! Excellent!! 
Whether you like chicken/ prawn/ mutton in oyster sauce / hoysin sauce / dry fried --- all of them will cater to your chinese liking for sure.
Their mocktails and fruit cocktail dessert is also very nice.
We always have lovely time there and their reasonably priced menu makes us visit more than twice a month. 
A must try !!! :)

--------another time----------

Went to Oceania again!! adding few pics.

This time tried their Satay chicken and it was Goood with that yum peanut butter sauce!! Excellent. Their Pan Fried fish was awesome too !
I simply love this place.
Recommend, recommend, recommend!!!!

We came here for dinner yesterday.. very nicely done, interiors are quite classy. We ordered one hot and sour soup, virgin mojitos, for starters we took crispy chilli babycorn and chilly paneer. For main course we had bakkarkhani, fish amritsari masala, kadhai murg and subz jalfrezi. The portions were more than we expected, each and every dish was brilliant. Chicken was soft and succulent and found their speciality roti very crispy and different (in a good way !) Staff was sweet and friendly and we were more than full at the end of our meal but couldnt resist the dessert section so went for chocolate montecarlo. My my, it was divine ! Layers of sweetness and awesomeness. They are very generous with quantity so i'll recommend it highly ! And so many things were quite easy on our pockets so yeah, I'll visit this place again !

Good work guys :)

Well, I hang out with my cousins a lot and since we all love to hog, we keep trying different restaurants. So one day we went to Oceania to celebrate my brother's anniversary. The place looked quite a good and the ambience was very nice. The waiters came after a while to take the order and we chose all kinds of stuff, ranging from chicken to lamb. The food was quite good and the service was prompt. The place was well maintained. However, must put in a special word about the desserts. They were just awesome. Starting from the presentation to the taste, it was absolutely delightful.

Having read great reviews on Zomato for Oceania, I'd been looking forward to coming here. So I was really happy when a friend and I decided on Oceania as our spot for lunch last Sunday! 
The place is tucked away in a quiet part of Southern Avenue. The decor is very colourful and cheerful; we felt welcome the moment we walked through the door. The staff greeted us courteously and we were soon seated in a cosy corner. The restaurant is on the small side, but that's nice in a way - less din from other patrons. We ordered chicken reshmi kebab, paneer butter masala and butter naan, and two Pepsis. 
The food was served soon enough, and came piping hot. The kebabs were nice but pretty average, on the whole - nothing out of the way. The paneer, on the other hand, was surprisingly delicious - large chunks lightly fried and coated in a creamy tomato gravy. The naan was soft and buttery and went great with the paneer. The only problem was the quantity of the paneer - there simply wasn't enough for two people (and we were pretty hungry) so we had to order another. And then we had a hard time finishing the whole if the second! If they could just increase the amount per plate, it would suffice for two people. With all these items, our bill came to INR 872 - not cheap, but not exorbitant either. 
Apart from the quantity issue, I loved everything about Oceania. The bright decor, the cheery ambience, the quality of the food, the service...everything is spot on. I'm definitely coming back for more! Thank you, Oceania! :)

This is a complete crap restaurant. I went to this place with my girlfriend a couple of months ago. I ordered fried fish and grilled chicken. There was a foul smell in the so called "fresh fried fish". The grilled chicken was also mediocre. When I called the restaurant staff they took away the fish after a small argument. We didn't order anything else after that horrific experience and decided to go to some other nice restro so that we can get rid of the trauma. They didn't have the courtesy to exclude the rotten item which they served from the bill. They compensated the same with a single (that to very small) scoop of vanilla ice cream. To make things worse, the food is pretty costly. I would never visit the place anytime in my life and would also suggest people who are planning to go there, to completely avoid it. There are other good continental restaurants in Kolkata, who are atleast not CHEATS.

It's been quite long since I have been to this place. However, the White sauce pasta is still stuck in my head. It is delicious.

The notable thing about this place is that both, the Italian & Indian fare taste quite Nice. There isn't a dish which I did not like. I speak of the Vegetarian dishes.

The ambiance is also very soothing and elegant. The staff are quite warm in their approach.

The only downside is the pocket pinch. I wish it could be lower so that I could be tempted to go there more often.

Have only tried the continental menu (haven't tried the Indian and Chinese cuisines), and my rating goes to them only on that basis. And I can vouch for the continental dishes they serve.... just awesome, precisely, each one of them.

We took the Hawaiian Salad, Stroganoff (Chicken), Pasta Al Frado (fusilli) and Chicken Steak with Pepper Sauce. Each one of the dishes was sheer orgasm for the taste buds... and the quantities were also pretty big. The continental cuisine of Oceania is at par with those that I've found in a number of renowned restaurants of Europe & the US. This is definitely a place I look forward to visiting again.

The service was good (slightly on the slower side may be). The decor is decent, though nothing to go gaga about. The ambience is good.

Overall, I strongly recommend this place.

The place had been recommended by a friend for Chinese food so when we finally managed to make it here that is exactly what we decided to try
. 
The place is quite small but brightly done up and the staff is quite courteous

The Black Mushroom fried rice and the Vegetables in Szechwan sauce were outstanding.
The rice was nicely flavoured with enough sprinkling of black mushrooms and the combination with szechwan sauce vegetables turned out to be too good
The Chilly gartlic fried Noodles were standard fare but the Stir fried vegetable, cottage cheese & mushrooms in Coriander sauce was a refreshingly nice item

All in all really liked the place. Would like to try the Indian cuisine another day

A quiet corner in the heart of the city. 
Food here is top-notch,both quality and quantity wise. 
My favourites here are the Fried Fish & Chips and Chicken Stroganoff. The former one consists of 4 sizable pieces,fries and coleslaw which is more than enough for two people.One can even pair it up with a basket of toast that gets served with jam,butter and olive oil. Proves to be an amazing combination.
The Stroganoff is again pretty heavy for a single person but amazingly tasteful.
End it with Monte Carlo or Frozen Alaska.
Though the food is good,it has only a very restricted clientele and thus is generally empty on most days.. which actually suits me fine. 
Service is a bit slow though.
