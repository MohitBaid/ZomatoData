This review is for Jaisalmer buffet -

1. First and foremost if you are planning for a buffet please choose somewhere else. A-la-carte is average and buffet is poor. Per head costs ‚Çπ650 + tax. There are 5 items available each for starter and main course. Desert 3 items.

2. In starter they have chilli chicken, chilli fish, fish hariyali, tandoori chicken, mutton sheek. They have mouth watering names for chilli items.. but both taste same and made poorly with extra gram flour less fish/chicken. If you can identify fish in chilli fish then YOU ARE GENIUS! Tandoori chicken felt like raw and half cooked. The slightly burnt and smoky flavour of tandoori is missing. Fish hariyali is average and about mutton sheek, the less said the better.

3. Main course consists of Pulao, Chicken biryani, mutton kasha and some chicken gravy items. Average taste. You can cook better at your home. Desert have 3 flavours of ice creams, brownies, fruits

4. About drinks - IMFL costs around ‚Çπ200. And they have a bad bartender. The cocktails and mocktails are so poor in taste. Same cocktails I had in other pubs/restaurants were far better than here.

5. I am tired telling about the poor experience. The service part is no better as you can understand. They do not keep the items cooked at once and placed on oven as you usually see in buffet, once you order they will cook and bring to you. This makes the service part waaaaaaay slow than you expect.

If you still want to choose Jaisalmer, do only if all other restaurants are either shut off or house full.

Jaisalmer is located in globsyn crystal sector 5.
Nice place for Lunch and dinner. Couple of month ago i went their for dinner. Specially I loved the decor of this place.
Ordered :
Starter-
2, chilli baby corn

Main course -
Paneer butter masala
Chicken tikka butter masala
Mushroom mattar masala
Garlic naan 

The taste main course was good chicken dish was perfectly cooked was not that oily, musroom matar masala was spicy with lovely flavours. Paneer dish was also very good
Now, Starter it was a big dissapointment for me the baby corn were hard we were not able to chew it easily.
Neverthless , i was satisfied with this place an would love to visit this place this again. 
This place also provides with great buffet at reasonable price.
Overall i would rate this place as follws :
Ambience - 5/5 
Food - 4/5
Price - 3.5/5
Service - 5/5
Overall - 4/5

Well this is one of the most beautiful restaurants I have seen. It has two floors. The upper is mainly for family. You should definitely try this place with your family. There is a small counter for drinks as well. 
The service is just amazing. The staff were friendly and polite. 
Coming to the food, I am completely taken away by the veg biryani. The Garlic naan was just perfect, the way anyone would ever want. The dal makkhani was also very tasty and finger licking. 
Overall this place is a must try.

 Do try kadai paneer it's really tasty üëç I didn't like the non veg here. We ordered chicken tikka masala but the pieces weren't good. Vegetarian food is good over here.

Jaisalmer is a nice restaurant.¬† The menu options include Indian and Chinese. The Chinese food is really good out here,especially the chicken drumsticks starter for the non veg folks. The Indian menu is also good, however sometimes did not find the kebabs as per expectations.The ambience is good but I feel the overall management of the place can be improved.

Easily, one of my favourite restaurants in Sector 5, Saltlake. Located in the Globysn Building complex(beside KFC), this place has a wonderful ambience. This would be my first choice in Sector 5 if anyone tells me they want to have quality North Indian food along with some good Kababs . They serve alcohol too, so thats an added advantage. The seating area is spread out over 2 floors, and is quite wide and spacious.¬† Amongst starters, the Tangri Kabab and the Hariyali Kabab are amazing here. I don't eat mutton, but my friends swear by "Adrak Ke Panje" amongst mutton starters - it looks really enticing and you must have that if you love mutton. The Biryani is pretty light as well, and I love having that along with the Chicken Rara. The food items are reasonably priced, and they have seating options for people coming in large groups as well. You will definitely have an enjoyable dinner and leave satiated.

Went for a team outing and opted for buffet lunch.A wide platter of starters, crispy baby corn being the best. The biryani and the pulao were light and tasty, and so was the mutton curry. However there is serious dearth of options in desserts, serving just chocolate and strawberry flavoured icecreams and kheer..the service however is extremely poor and sluggish. 
The cool and relaxing ambience, and photo-op decors,  interior and exteriors, add glamour to the otherwise average experience.

Ambiance is nice, food is decent and service is sluggish to say the least. I and my entourage went for the buffet. Popular among starters include the crispy babycorn, tandoori chicken and hariyali fish. For mains stick with the chicken biryani and mutton curry. Deserts include kheer, strawberry and chocolate ice creams and assortment of fruits. Would have been nice if they gave hot chocolate sauce with the ice cream. Overall a not too bad but not too good a place either.

Hunting for North Indian in sector V, we landed at this rather new looking building with a couple of restaurants and pubs. The approach is easy and the location is the heart of sector V. 

Coming straight to the point, I don‚Äôt have much to review this place as there was a birthday organised in a restaurant and the ground floor was occupied amidst lot of shouting and celebration. The entire floor adjacent to the bar was privately occupied. So we were pushed up to the first floor. It was surprisingly vacant(ish) on a Saturday evening.. To my dislike, the place is very averagely made - to keep the menu prices on the lower side probably. In brief,
Portions : ok
Taste : just about Ok
Flavours : missing
Service : confused staff
Alcohol : exhaustiveüëçmenu
Breads : superbly prepared.

No way fine dining!!!

It‚Äôs worst buffet experience ever. The quality of food was not up to the mark. No variety in the confectionary items and the deserts. The staffs were trying to save the foods from the customers which is the cheapest thing I ever experienced in multi-cuisine restaurants.

Great decor and ambience but not very pocket friendly. Good for a nice little hangout or even a meeting or a date if you're in the area. Food is good the service is great and the decor and ambience is truly amazing, in a word you'll love the place but the pocket pinch is a little bit on the higher side for the quantity of food you get if that's fine by you the place is a must go. Definitely recommend by me.

I went for a buffet lunch with colleagues. The starters are medium quality.In the main course, only mutton and biriyani was good, rest of the item are poor quality.The gulam jamun was sour and smelly.They forgot to provide complementary drink after that on reminder they provided. Extremely disappointing. Total wastage of money.

The waiters were attentive and service overall was good. The restaurant looked to have been recently decorated. Overall a good meal and great value we will certainly be going back.

16th December 2017 was the first time I had been to Jaisalmer .. for my team outing. Surely, this was the last one. Word-of-mouth reviews prompted me to go there as I prefer to try out new restaurants every quarter. Previously I had been to BBQ Nation, Chai Break, Machan, Funjabi Tadka, Flame & Grill, Troya and a few other places.¬†
We had a group of 31 and occupied the tables @ 07:30 pm for a buffet dinner. We had our 'Welcome Drinks' after 3 starters and 45 minutes after we had entered the restaurant - this was a first for me!! Till 08:30, we only had one round of the starters. And that too, very small servings. The chicken and the fish did not taste fresh .. also, the foods were cold and bland. When asked about the delay to the non-responsive staffs, we were told that foods were still being prepared and we need to wait. The Pan Fried Chili Fish and the Chicken Chill Pepper sauce was served only once and the quantity was about one spoonful! What's worse, only ONE waiter was attending to 4 table consisting of 31 people!
Unable to bear the torture anymore, we decide to speak to the manager and he requested us two wait for 2 minutes and everything will be fine. When we asked that despite us reserving our tables 3 days in advance and them knowing our dining time why was the food not prepared, he just kept mum.
Most of us then decided to move to the main course(around 08:30 pm). And to our dismay, found that no bread and roti was there and upon further inquiry, we were told that it will take another 20 minutes as the breads ad rotis were being prepared. In the main course, the Tawa Gosht was really good but again, the Fish in Chlli Garlic Sauce was nowhere to be seen. And the chicken legs in the Biriyani weres so small, that it was hard to believe that those were chicken legs indeed -¬† although the Biriyani itself was good.
15-16 of our group had barely settled down with our dishes when we found that no plates were there in the main course area and as a result, the rest who had not started the main course had to wait for another 15-20 minutes. In utter dissatisfaction and anger, we decided to leave the restaurant after hurrying through the desert(only ice creams and one cake was available).
I've never ever written any food reviews anywhere and logged in to share my experiences only. I decided to write this review only because of the pathetic and horrible service we received in Jaisalmer. Having bad food is definitely a bad experience, having bad service is worse and having bad food and bad service together is the worst eating out experience. I feel that I have let down my team by taking them to Jaisalmer.

Heard a lot about this place mostly mix feed backs.So gave it a try on friend's birthday.so Starting with the place easy to detect one just need to get of at sec v webel more & visit globsyn building.Coming to ambience they have variety of furniture for different sitting.They have two floors to accommodate people.The upper floor depicts a bit of Californian touch. Except for this they don't have any other attractions.so a 3 out of 5.Moving to the service the table attendants were prompt to bring the menu for the buffet and water also they were very courtesious.But the plates were worn out with the use which really let down the first impression for the decor,so 2.5 out of 5.Coming to the food now we opted the non veg lunch buffet for 600+18%GST.They started with sweet corn bhell which was bit bland to the taste so I had to add salt & paper & some green chatny to make it upto my taste.next came chilli baby corn.it was good in taste but the outer part was not crispy.next they gave chicken tandoori yet again bland in taste.next was Kasturi fish Tika it was the ok in taste in the whole lot.next were drums of heaven,Paneer tikka & paper fish.So that's all for the stater moving to the main they had equal no of veg & non veg items.I had almost all of them to taste.So started with 1 combo veg noodles,with Chinese chicken & veg Manchurian,2nd combo pulao, Tawa mutton, chicken butter masala, paneer butter masala, & another paneer item & that's it.For Desert they didn't had much options gulabjamuns, ice-cream & Brownies.Also tried some mocktails Lady green,pinacolada,summer suprise & another one.so over all a nice experience,may try once more if they provide some more new items.

Hey foodies,

Do you wanna have some good food??
Opps! Then this is not the right place for you guys..
This place is a complete mess with some unworthy food that can't ever make your tongue happy..and ofcourse some werid people with improper behaviours that can't ever make you happy as well.
But yes, if you want to have some liquor, then you can visit this place!

Liquor is the only thing, they have!

But come on, in Kolkata, there are many other good and worthy places to have liquor.
So this place is a complete "NO" for me..

A buffet with the tagline "We will serve you shit,you have to eat". 
DONT ever go for the buffet here.A well decorated place,with lots of liqour available.But their buffet was pisspoor.
Starters were bland.Mutton kebabs were dry,chicken lollypops were just a better version of roadside chicken drumstick(had better at roadside sometimes though).The chicken kababs were so so.And all of this,at a pace slower than slowbro.
In desert,you have only 3 choice of ice cream,and a gulab jamun that was prepared using ready to mix.For freaking 650+ rupees,Ready to mix is totally unacceptable.
Now coming to the main part.Their behaviour.Its the one of the worst in kolkata .we were served chewy muttons in main course.
We had taken up enthisiastically,but eventually found out it was unedible.Now one of the waiters came,and started to lecture us about wastage of food.I mean,seriously who gets sadistic pleasure from wasting food,that too mutton.When we protested,his blabbering went haywards.Now the manager came to the party.He started his employers defending by giving bushit logic one after another.And things escalated quickly.After this went on for a while,THEN he started apologising as other guests also started to know about the issue!!!
I mean man,seriously do you think this kind of behaviour is acceptable in this kind of place.With huge charges and pretty bland food,WASTAGE OF MONEY.DONT GO FOR THE BUFFET.

Decor and ambiance - Very Good
Food - They serve about 15 types of veg & non-veg starters (Chinese & Tandoori) straight from the oven / pan to the table UNLIMITED quantity and servings, so be choosy on what you want to have else you will need to miss main course which has another 15-20 items (Buffet) and then a decent desert (buffet) . Food is awesome, I have been there 4 times and every-time the menu is different. AND all this for less than 700 per person, I am shocked how they manage to keep this rate all through. Great Place - Great Food

Had dinner for couple of months ago.. experience was nice...

Decor and environment was very good.. so was service..
It occupies a huge space.. with two floors.. with different set of seating arrangements..¬†

we were 7 in total.. so choose a big round table...

we opt for buffet..¬†
though items were many and all cooked very well.. though I'll say the Indian / Moglai cuisines were better than the Chinese items here..¬†
the Starters the made live and served, I can remember the taste of Fish Tikka till now, the taste was really unforgettable..¬†
main courses were also very good and tasty..¬†
Deserts were so so, a bit mood spoiler after those good items..¬†

Overall if you try the buffet once, you won't regret..

Its located in globsyn towers in sector 5, it has a nice casual ambience.
I went here for a family dinner.
We ordered chicken tandoori full which was good.
We also ordered grilled bhetki for starters but it took painfully long to reach us, and finally when it did, the taste wasn't good, the fish was very smelly and didn't seem fresh.
For main course we had chicken biryani, tandoori roti and Punjabi chicken.
Punjabi chicken had 4 pieces of chicken with bone and had the gravy made with chicken Keema, an innovative dish which I tried for the first time.
Chicken biryani was also good.
Another big disappointment here was Masala papad, it didn't contain any tomato and coriander, just very little quantity of onions, please don't order Masala papad here , its a total waste of money. I am adding the picture too.
Overall I would say it's a good restaurant to try regularly ordered food like chicken tandoori, grilled fish kind of stuff should be avoided.
Staff is cordial. They served us late at night. We also took a picture with them, we were the last ones to leave.
The overall neatness can be improved, the plates are old and withered, they should be changed.

My rating is only and only based on the ambience. It's a spacious restaurant with top notch decor, which attracted us to it in the first place. But both the food and the service lacked what the decor provided. We ordered chicken pahari kebab, which was okaiyish, nothing extraordinary. Our next order, crispy fried chilly chicken was an utter disappointment. It only had a chewy coating, the chicken inside being as thin as a blade!! When we asked the management to replace it, they dilly-dallied with meek explanations like the almost-absence of chicken from a so-called chicken dish was only to increase the crispiness of the dish!! But who wanted "crispy cornstarch" instead of "crispy chicken"?! Finally when they did replace it, they did so with some soya fried chicken (which they were serving on their buffet menu that day). It too had more of coating than chicken, tasted a bit burned and was excessively salty, after which we had neither the heart nor the guts to try any of their main course. Very disappointing indeed.

We are opting buffer on Sunday lunch. The full restaurant was pleasant & near about empty & the hospitality was great.
We entered roughly 1.15 pm, on that time restaurant was empty.
Coming to the food part...
They have 12 types of starter ( 6 veg & 6 non veg). It serves in plate.
Veg starer- tandoori potato, nilgiri sikh kebab, veg mangolian, paneer tikka, corn salt & peeper , crispy baby corn
Non veg starer - kasturi murg, red & chilli fish, chicken soya ball, mutton Sikh kebab, chicken drums of heaven, fish tikka
---+ fish tikka , kasturi murg & paneer tikka & corn salt pepper was excellent.. But rest items are average, I think they may be improve their starter section by reducing the no of items.

A welcome drink - lime soda was there

Main course--
Jerra rice - it was average
Chicken biriyani - test is good, but number of chicken is horrible, just like to find 1 coin in 1 kg of rice.
Raita- it was good
Indian breads- they have only tandoori rooti & butter nun, we took nun, which is good

Veg items-
Nabaratna curry- good
Paneer butter masala- it was mouth watering
Dal makhani- not tasted
Chili garlic noodle - it was bad
Veg Manchurian- average

Non veg items
Fish in hunan sauce - it was super tasty & best among of all
Chicken Marsala - it was bad
Mutton kasa- piece of mutton was nicely cooked & melted , overall it was good

Desert -
Caramel clustered - it was average
Chocolate brownie - it was good
Gulab jamun - very bad
Choice of ice cream - vanilla or chocolate

Overall experience is good , but they may look there starter & desert item
Total cost - #708 All inclusive per person

We went for a family dinner here at about 10pm on 30th October'17. Though the ambiance was quite good the service and food left us disappointed. The drinking water served was tasting weird, also the glasses served were not clean. We had vegetarian North indian there (fried rice, paneer masala, dal makhani, dal fry) and the food was strictly okay. Nothing made my tongue wanna have more of it. Also they forgot we ordered papad as well and served it at the end when we reminded them. We also ordered American corn salt and pepper as starter, and even that was below par. Was definitely expecting more walking into the restaurant. 

Sorry for pointing it out but even the soap dispenser in the washroom was completely diluted with water.

Really exceptional and one of the nicest buffet restaurants i came across in a while! The staff are really nice and polite, helpful. It's such a plus that all of the food served in the buffet are so nice. Value for money. Would love to come here again. Already recommended this to a lot of my friends. Keep up the good work.

This place is located just beside KFC in the Globsyn crystals building. The decor and ambience is very nice. We opted for the dinner buffet which was priced at 708 AI. 

The spread was quite huge. It comprised of:
Starters:- Aloo tikki, corn chaat, crispy chilli baby corn, paneer tikka kebab, chicken tandoori, chicken drumsticks, achaari fish tikka, red chilli pepper fish, mutton seekh kebab.
Main course:- pulao, chicken biriyani, tandoori roti, butter naan, dal makhni, paneer butter masala, mixed veg, sweet and sour vegetables, Mongolian noodles, chicken dakbanglow, fish in mustard sauce, mutton kassa.
Dessert:- gulab jamun, pudding, chocolate cake, ice cream(vanilla, chocolate and butter scotch)

The food quality was good. Staff was also very courteous and kept a watch on whatever we needed whenever our plates were empty.

And yes they also served complementary sweet lime soda. 

Would surely like to visit again.

I believe the rating itself implies the experience. Went for office team lunch. Previously booked. This is the second visit. This time it is more disappointing. The starters were very average. The mutton seekh kabab was salty, the drums of heaven was like hell, the chicken tandoori seemed half cooked, the red pepper fish was hard and chewy like chewing gum. The fish tikka was something which was atleast could be taken in your mouth. The main course was bland except the mutton, the biryani was found to be worse than the roadside ones, the noodles smelt of the charcoal, the garlic fish was smelly. Now coming to the desert, the caramel custard was bitter, the gulab jamuns were of uneven sizes and were bland, not even sweet, the payesh was not sweet what we make at home. Except being only spacious and the decor, it was a very bad experience, everytime I visited there. I do not recommend this eatery at all.

Date: 6/10/2017
Time: 12.30 pm onwards 

Intro: It was a post pujo bijoya lunch for us (office colleagues). This place was selected because it was a new place to all of us and we have heard some good feedback about it from other colleagues and friends, also the price of their lunch buffet apparently seemed to be reasonable. So with high hopes we started for this place.

Location: in the globsyn building, few steps away from webel bus stop.

Ambience: it's top notch. No questions about it. Tastefully done interiors, high ceilings giving a spacious feeling, perfectly placed glass walls allowing the usage of daylight and decent enough seating arrangement.

Service: they lack a lot in their service. We were the 1st customers in the restaurant that day at that time. Yet their service lagged in every bit. The buffet took lot of time to b filled in. So took the starters to be served at the table. Their attitude was also wrong, bit stubborn, bit lackluster, a lot lethargic unlike any other restaurants serving buffet, I've been too.

Food: we opted for buffet. The lack in service can always be made up by good food , but food wise they were almost close to a disaster. 
The chicken starter essentially a spicy version of malai tandoori chicken was decent however, they were not keen enough to serve it after 2 times.
The drums of heaven/hell , essentially a spicy oily version of roadside chicken lollipop was just meh!!
Next came in a Chinese preparation of shredded fried fish. It was disappointing. Thick outer coating and no fish inside it tasted horrible.
However, the fish tandoori saved some face, decent chunks of fish tandoored and served piping hot was better than the rest. However, I felt ive had better fish tandoori almost everywhere else. Again the problem was they didn't want to serve it after 2_3 times. 
The mutton sheekh kebab they served was surprisingly good.
Next came the main course. I donno about their veg dishes cause I didn't taste it.
The Hakka chowmein along with the Chinese fish preparation was absolutely forgetful. The fish stank, literally and chowmein was no good either.
The chicken biryani however surprised me, I usually don't like the Biryani's served along with a buffet, but this one was good , perfect blend of taste and odor. 
The mutton kadai was however, mixed breed. It tasted nice but was exceptionally spicy and hot. At 1st the pieces were decent, succulent and soft, later it became more bony more chewy and the overtly spicy affair just killed my appetite.
The dessert is never my forte. Also they didn't have good collection. Icecream was good.

Cost: with all the corporate discount and GST it costed us 640 per head.

Conclusion: if they serve this amount of disappointing food along with this service attitude, for this price, people will turn away from them. All the good name they made will just disappear in thin air. Its about time, they should pull up their socks or close the buffet.

Visited today for a bhai dooj party. Had the worst possible experience.

1. We pre-booked the place 10days back with a booking amount of 2,000. When we arrived, we found out that the place we booked for had been allotted to other people.
2. No one takes responsibility for the mismanagement. The manager was indifferent and offered no help. The owner, whom we called, also said its a common thing at their place and they dont care.
3. The food was okay except that we found a piece of stapler in it.
4. Service is pathetically slow

As we friends were trying to find a restaurant to have our diwali eve dinner, this quirky decoration caught our eyes on zomato.
They offer reasonable buffet for lunch and dinner. But we went for la carte. They have a private sitting area for 8 people and luckily we were 9. üòä We ordered chinese for starter...crispy baby corn and drums of heaven And we orderd murg lababdar, murg rara punjabi.,gosht rogan josh, butter nun, garlic cheese nun and plain tandoori for main course bt, we got mutton rara instead of chicken rara üôÑ.
Overall food quality and quantity were good..

The place was staring on our face for sometime now and finally had buffet lunch here a couple of weeks back. It was a team lunch from office.¬†
Location: Location wise very convenient.¬†
Interior: clean and nice. Nothing too fancy.¬†
Food: The food was quite average. Like many Sec V places starters are better than main course. However overall food quality is just ok. The good thing was they had 3 varieties of ice cream in the dessert section.

We had a small office get-together on 6/10/17.
We opted for lunch buffet. 
1. Table was booked one day before.
2. Starters were served in table.  Service was very slow.  They were trying to repeat veg items. When we were asking for fish item or chicken tandoori item to repeat they were saying to wait they will grill.  Restaurant was almost vacant that time.  Then also we have to wait lot if we asked for repeat. Items were ok.  But not upto the mark. 
3. Main course fish chinese item was not good quality wise. 
4. Main course mutton was good cooked. But little teekha. 
5. Chicken biryani was good. 
6. Desert are below the mark.  Gulab jamoon was worst i taken till the date.  

Overall price wise,  service,  quality I am not very satisfied.  Will not recommend my friends to join buffet there.

wanted to go here from a long time mostly because of the nice decor they've. finally went to have lunch a month ago. it was quite empty on a Wednesday afternoon. there was a buffet but we went for a la carte.. had one chinese starter and one indian. i liked the starter. we had butter nun and murg rara punjabi for main course .. i had the mocktail mango tango which tasted more of a smoothie to me than a mocktail.. I found the food overall to be average.

The kebab was sumptuous. I would definitely like to recommend this place to others and also would like to try out all their other dishes myself. They need to fix the glass door which once opened doesn't shut on its own :p

Oh we shouldn't have gone there..This is the reaction we had. We went there for dinner on 30th Sep. Menu card is too short so it didn't take much time for us to decide.We ordered mushroom pepper and salt and murgh pahadi kababs. Both were very tasty. We ordered some indian and some chinese dishes. Indian dishes ( Butter naan and dal amritsari) saved us. Guyz never try their chinese menu. Desert section have only 3 ice creame flavours ..vanilla, butterscotch and chocolate. Nothing else. Atleast we had horrible experience all together.

I went there for a office dinner party. We booked a table for 20 people and opted for buffet. The ambience was quite good. Interior Decoration was a bit royal. They had plenty of seats, so getting a table was not a problem (though we booked earlier). Coming to the food, they served starters‚Äã on the table. A welcome drink (lemon juice) was there along with different kinds‚Äã of chicken, mutton and fish tandoor n kebab items. Specially the chicken kebab, fish tandoor and one or two more preparations‚Äã were very good. Mutton starter was not so good. Apart from that some veg items like baby corn, paneer kebab was there. Coming to the main course they served naan on the table. Fried rice, biriyani, noodles, chicken n mutton side dishes were there. But if something to be mentioned specially is their biriyani. It was really best among the buffets i have had. In dessert options were few. Cake, sweet and ice cream (3 flavours). 
Cons: very few items for veg dishes. Literally number and quality of the starters were very bad. And in dessert ice cream got almost finished at around 9:15 pm only. When we asked for refill they said that they do not have it in stock. It was really a very disappointing behaviour for such a good restaurant.
Overall it was good, pocket friendly (corporate discount of 10% was there). Will recommend to others.

I wish I could give them 0 rating. Extremely poor service. I visited there with my family. My mom had to eat Veg dishes. They took nearly 20 minutes for serving Veg starters. Food quality was also not up to the mark. At last, when they gave Finger Bowls for hand cleaning, water inside the bowl was cold.Don't know how cold water removes oils from fingers.I expected a lot from this restaurant, but the service made me feel very sad. Very unsatisfactory.

Jaisalmer looks epic from the outside with it's ambience and decor but is equally bland when it comes to food and service.Went there on a sultry afternoon,we first ordered Special Combo Package 3 which had two large beers along with starters.After that we ordered Jeera Pulao and Chicken Tikka Masala.The food was okay but the quantity was way too less.Chicken Tikka was the tastiest item but the chicken pieces were not satisfactory.Moreover the leather of the couch (on which we were sitting) was torn and felt like as if we were sitting on a bus seat.Staff was courteous and probably was the only thing positive about the restaurant.Jaisalmer raises your expectations high but fails to meet them.Hope next time will be a better experience.

Food is very bad if you're not on the buffet menu. Although the buffet is also kindda not great and sort of okay ish.
Out of all items, Never try Biryani, even the road side small food joints will offer a better quality biryani then the perfume and oil clad chawal served here in the name of biryani.
Service too is very bad. We had to ask twice for tissues, water and every other item when the restaurant was not even half full.Staff were annoying and unfriendly. Never visiting again.

The interiors is very welcoming.. but it is highly disappointing.. the customers were minimal but the service was so slow. They took 15 mins to get a naan.. the roti was thin and tasteless.. they charge 310 for dal makhani and you would expect it to atleast taste good...  taking 110 for onion salad that almost burns your mouth.. like what is wrong with them? the whole experience was disappointing and annoying  and It Does Burn A Hole in your Pocket without giving you happiness. And well food is supposed to give you happiness.

Just the best food you'll find this puja season. While everyone is bringing in special durga puja menu cards which have lesser options and hiked prices and definitely poorer quality food, these guys here have not done any of that. I had visited the place at 12:30am and it was still full and I had to wait for around 30mins, but that can be ignored. 
The food was simply amazing...sabz-biryani and raita, dal makhni with tandoori roti and cheese garlic naan. Mouth watering and filling on your stomach too. The helpings are enough for two people to dine. Prices are reasonable and the ambience does speak of luxury. The service was ridiculously fast and top notch. Considering the time of day I visited and the festive season, one could easily feel that the quality of service might have dropped with the day and a poorer quality food, but I was taken entirely by surprise and it amazed me a lot.
Definitely worth a try and better visited with your family.

The place is quite large so there is no probpem in accomodation, no long queueseven during durga puja. The service is quite good and the suggestions of the waiters are really helpful. The alcoholic drinks are quite good.
Now the buffet. I had a speciap durga puja lunch buffet. Starters were a-m-a-z-i-n-g. There were about 7-8 types of starters(in the nonveg buffet). The maincourse had 2 types of rice, chicken do pyaza and mutton rogan josh. Both the meat items were neat in taste amd very tender. Peas polao was okay. Biriyani was again exquisite. The rice was melting in mouth and the taste is quite different than usual. It was a good different. Dessert had brownies and ice cream.
Complaints: food was not warm enough. Dessert needed to have daarsaan. And serve the starters a little slowly. And i don't know if we recieved the appetizer later because we had ordered other drinks, but should have at least mentioned about it.

I visited this place along with a friend in September 2017 for Lunch and we opted for Buffet which was priced at Rs.600 Plus Taxes per person.
It is located in the Salt lake Sector 05 area inside the Globsyn Crystal building and it was just opposite the Hotel Indi Smart where we were staying.It was located on the first floor and we took the steps to reach there.The Ambience was grand and the seating was also good.
Our buffet started with a welcome drink and next the starters were served on the table.Multiple varieties of starters [Both veg and Non veg] were served but none of them were superlative.
The Main courses were also just about Average, none of the items stood out.Its the same with the desserts : 03 varieties of desserts and 02 varieties of Ice cream were served and they were just about Ok.
The Service and the Ambience were good but they need to make their dishes stand out as it is surrounded by restaurants like Barbeque Nation, Ocean Grill and Chai Break which serve in similar style.

Went for a buffet with office colleagues sometime back and did not find the food to be of any value to the exorbitant amount of Rs.600 + Taxes that they are charging. 

The only dish that stood out in the Buffet was baked Mihidaana/boondi and I didn't need to pay this kind of money to eat good Mihidaana at a fancy restaurant. It can be eaten at any good sweet shop.

Service was good thought and the place has a nice upscale ambiance. Fine dine in as you may say but who needs fine dine in for@ lunch when you cannot even dress up to go.

The location n ambience is wonderful. But we were the only guest over there.We took lunch buffet.
Service is slow. Stuff was ok.
They served the veg, non veg both starters. Fish tikka, tandoori chicken, crisps baby corn were good. Didn't like the other items.
The main course were also just about average.
Chicken biryani n mutton kasa were good. But garlic fish n raita didn't seem freshly prepared, it was not smelling good n also didn't like the taste.
In the dessert section they had brownie (very hard), we liked the pudding and hot gulab jamun. Fruits were not fresh hence didn't tried. Chocolate n vanilla ice cream quality was not upto the mark.
Overall just ok experience.
Cannot even compare with ber-b-q Nation.

A little heads up: This one is filled with "We didn't like it" stuffs!

Jaisalmer was never on our list that day, but we ended up having one of the most bizarre and in many sense insulting days. After taking the Grand Buffet offer from Little App, we thought of giving this place a shot. I called up the on call manager and asked him whether the buffet section will be open or not. He asked us to come in before 3:30 PM, and we reached the doors by 3:18. In the meantime I booked us coupons from little, and there was no backing out from it. 

As soon as we reached there, we were met with an unwelcoming attitude and the staff told us that they were closed. When enquired their manager showed up and apologized for the confusion and we were asked to sit down and wait patiently. The staff never seemed to like us and catered us with ice-cold attitude.

We started off with the chicken kebab which was pretty decent. The drums of heaven or so they call it was wrapped in oil and masala making it impossible to eat more than 3-4 pieces. We quickly skipped to the mains section only to be disappointed to the core as the Noodle was cold and smelled funny. The fish had more air than fillet stuffing. The brownies were the only one saving our day. 

We have been to Jaisalmer a couple of times before, and had a gala time with their summer offer going on. However, our latest experience was a disaster and I would like the authority to rejuvenate the staff and work on their courteousness. We are not asking us to be served in a gold platter, but a courteous greet might suffice.

I had an extremely bad experience yesterday. The quality of the food has deteriorated so much here that we wouldn't even think of visiting here again. The order was placed for Pahari chicken kebab and chicken lababdar in gravy which was not at all cooked properly and was raw inside. Although they had made an effort to change the chicken but the scenario was same. Even the veg items was not at all upto the mark. There is something seriously wrong with this place. Extreamly disappointed....

Ambience is good. But second floor is more decorated but when we went to eat, the second floor was closed. Restroom facility is quite bad here. Food was good. We ordered pahari kebab, crispy baby corn, butter tandoori, paneer butter masal, and two types of chicken sides whose name i don't rememberm. Pahari kebab was yummy. The tandoori was soft and nice. Panter butter masala was also good. Service was satisfactory.

A lunch buffet .A treat by one of our team member .
The starters didn't taste like starters .Too much crispiness for crispy pepper fish.
Main course was fine.
I did like the fish in jade sauce.

Chicken Gravies are lip smacking, with each preparations being tossed with tandoori pieces.

The service is very very disappointing. We ordered dal makkhani paneer butter masala and chicken lababdar. The food was just like all the other standard indian restaurants. But decent. They dont have most of the beers on their menu. The ambience is quite good. But there were mosquitoes on that place. Quite a few. Though we didnt face any problem because of that. Its at the most a two time visit place.

Went here for a lunch buffet just few days ago.. It's a very nice place , well decorated and ambiance is nice. Buffet menu was very attractive.. 
They served fresh lime soda as welcome drink.
In started we had..
6 veg starters like paneer tikka, aloo tikka, friend corns, green veg kabab and crispy chilli babycorn
Approx 6 or 7 non veg starters like fish tikka, chicken lollipop, red pepper fish, red tandoori chicken, green tandoori chicken, mutton shik kabab etc.
Main course is too good.. more than my expectations.. In very few buffet maincources are as good as here.. In main course we had..
Raita,Polau, veg noodles, butter paneer, daal makhni, mixed veg etc in veg main course and chicken biriyani, butter chicken, red fish masala, mutton etc and naan.
Biriyani is just awesome.. This is the only buffet where I ate such taste biriyani. And they ask whether we want naan and quickly made it for us.. and mutton was very taste.. different taste and i like it.
Deserts are also good.. 
We had hot gulab jamun, chocolate brownie and ice creams ( 3 flavours.. chocolate , vanilla and butter scotch) 
Overall it's a good experience.. 
But one thing I don't like personally that dishes are finished quickly and they can't serve it.. we like one starter but they are not able to serve it again as it was finished.. and in desert it happens too.. we were waiting for brownie but it's just finished and they are not refill it.. 
Otherwise it's a good place to go..

Located at Globsyn Crystal near Webel More. It has a very attractive ambiance and it has an upper floor also. The time we got into the restaurant, was the lunch time and IT professionals gathering was taking place. Soon it became very crowded. Here the staffs serve all the starter items in the individual plates. It offers fresh lime soda as complementary drink. There were 6 veg & 6 non veg starters. Out of them some were indian & some were chinese. The starters include American Corn, Dum Aloo Kabab, Paneer Tikka Kabab, Hariyali Veg Kabab, Crispy Chilly Baby corn, Fish Kabab, Amritsari Chicken Kabab, Chicken tikka kabab, drums of heaven and some more delicious items. The best are Paneer tikka kabab, crispy chilly baby corn, fish items and all chicken kebabs. The first time crispy baby corn they served was very delicious but we asked for second time after some time, it was lack of sauce and spices, it didn't taste that much good second time. 
Tip for starters- At first do try all the indian dishes then go for Chinese dishes.

Let's come to the main course. Here, there were many dishes- Pulao, Chowmein, Chicken Biriyani, Nun/Butter nun, mixed vegetables, indian chicken & fish side dish and a mutton dish. We were already full with starters, so couldn't have main courses that much. But the biriyani was very good. 

Then desserts. It offers hot gulab jamun, brownies, 3 types of ice creams as desserts. Hot gulab jamuns were delicious. But some of us didn't get brownies. There is one request to the management- keep a choco sauce or choice of sauces for ice cream. 

Overall, its a really nice experience to cherish. We redeemed an offer from Nearbuy app which significantly lowered our per head cost.

A good buffet..with some different starters...but there is some different negatives to work with.
1. Stock of any particular starter wnt b available anytime. If it's ends. U wnt get all the varieties.
2. Service is poor n slow.
3. The desserts are very few in numbers and not frequently available as well.
Otherwise a good buffet to enjoy... :)

To be honest, I had one of my worst experience of dinning out. I mean people can literally see the anger on my face. This place disappointed me.¬†

Ambiance(4/5):
The ambiance is good, Though, being a rajasthani i was expecting something of that sort (lol). It is a large place with two floor dinning. Place was neat and and well arranged; decorated with yellow lights of lamps and bulbs.¬†

Food(4/5):¬†
The food is good here. I had that taste of Rajasthani Spices after a long time. Bread was well cooked. Chicken was soft and yummy. Panner was great with perfect blend of spices. I liked the food.

Staff and Services:(0/5)
The most frustrating part was the staff and services. I was asked to eat dal fry in plate (i was told that they don't have the cutlery). I didn't have a plate to put my bread (i was holding it right in my hand). I had to repeatedly ask for the spoon. Services were so slow that it killed my appetite. More to it, waiter missed my order (i didn't dare to order again because of the time they took to bring my first order). And the waiter had this "go f*** yourself" look on his face. At the end, I had to talk to the manager who just kept nodding while ¬†I was complaining.

Value for Money (2/5):
Well the kind of treatment i got here was really irritating. Moreover, prices are on the higher side. It will cost you around 1000-1200 for two person.¬†

Verdict:
It would had been a wonderful night if the services were better. Unfortunately, I had one of my worst nightmare. They have great food but the worst staff. And if you keep a hungry beast waiting for the food and ill treat your customers then even your good food can't save your reputation. You need to work on your staff guys!¬†

P.S.: Hope this feedback give a wake up call to the administration and this won't happen with others.

Well, I went there on 3rd of August,2017 with my family to celebrate my birthday. I chose this restaurant after seeing the good reviews in zomato and the ambience. Now my reviews in each section-

Food-1/5 (the food was beyond pathetic specially the main course. the biriyani was sour in taste and the chicken was so tasteless. The onion noddles was not at all fresh and tasteless. There were hardly anything in dessert to mention here. I dont know from where they discovered those microscopic brownies which were again tasteless. Only some of the starters were good but rest all bad)

service-3/5 (I was there to celebrate my birthday and was busy cutting cake,hence requested them to serve the food a bit later but they didnt pay any attention after telling 100 times and we were forced to eat the cold kababs!)

Ambience- Only the ambience was good but that is no value when the food is so bad. Very much disappointing.

Went there for  a lunch buffet..  We were given our seats in ground floor...  The first floor was empty but more beautifully decorated..  Ground floor was also nicely decorated..  Ambiance was good but as time passed it became irritating. It became too noisy..  Service was good.. 
We choose fresh lime soda between the two welcome drinks they offered..  After that they served all the starters at a time..  Starter : alu tikka, paneer item,  crispy corn ,chilli baby corn, chicken and fish tikka, mutton shik kebab,  chicken drums of heaven and another Chinese fish item..  They hotly served only 3/4 items.. Alu, Chicken, fish tikka were same in taste..  Veg starters were better than those of non veg.  Chicken drums of heaven was horrible..
Soup had only veg option.. 
In main course there were varieties..  Jeera rice, dal, jeera alu, paneer, veg curry, chicken biriyani, butter nun, methi murgh, mutton, Chinese fish item etc...  I didn't taste all the items.  But I liked butter nun, paneer, chicken biriyani, mutton..  This section was better than starter.. 
Desert potion was limited to gulab jamun, brownie,fruits,ice cream..  
Ice cream tasted best among all..

Great family dining restaurant. Ambience is really very nice but the prices are on an upper side. It was 899 per person for dinner buffet when last time I had dinner in this place making it a bit expensive but now i think they have cut the cost to 600+ taxes as you can see on the Zomato description.

You can ask for Globsyn Building near college more for exact location.

We ordered 3 sabjis- Chana masala, Dal Makhani, Kadai Paneer and breads.

The food was average and wasnt standing out enough with respect to its price. Though the staff is really courteous and friendly!

A really mouthwatering buffet in Kolkata. In fact I can say it is one of the best buffets in Kolkata with really tasty foods and peaceful ambiance. Let's discuss the menu-
.........Starters....
1 complimentary drink
6 veg starters (including 2 corn items, paneer kebabs etc.)
6 non veg starters (including fish kebabs, tandoor chicken etc.)
.........Main course......
Pilau
Veg noodles
Chicken Biryani
Tandoori Roti/ butter nun
Daal
Vegetables curry
Paneer butter masala
Chicken curry
Mutton roganjosh
.......Deserts.........
Fresh fruits 
Payesh
Hot gulaab jamoon
Ice creams (vanilla, butterscotch, chocolate)
Brownies
Mughlai items are no doubt very tasty but the Chinese items should get improvement.
My Rating:
Foods: 4/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5
Service: 4/5
Cleanliness: 4.5/5
They will serve the starters and you will take the main course and deserts yourself.
1600/- for two people for buffer. The food is enough for this amount. I must visit the place again.
Thanks

Visited this place for a team lunch with my colleagues and enjoyed it thoroughly.... We had booked a buffet lunch for 13 and the food was pretty good...
The variety of starters were almost enough to satisfy hungry souls and the main course was good too... The dessert varieties were okay too.....
Would love to visit again...
Thumbs up: Ambience... Decor... Starters...Price

Thumbs down: Main course could be a little better as well as the dessert...

Okay firstly went for buffet after seeing in zomato. They have a very good starter section, a perfect balanced combination of north Indian and Chinese food. Though the Chinese starters were a little bit spicy,but still yumm üòä Then the main course,I found the veg section more interesting than the non veg. Then the dessert part. Tastes of ice cream could be better. So overall I found it is okay according to food except the complementary drink. Now coming to the ambience,some part of the restaurant is not so pleasant. And service was just okay,can't say more than that.

The lunch buffet at Jaisalmer has just the best assortment of kebabs! Now I don't remember all the names, but I loved every single one of them. The starters had both veg and non veg kebabs, baby corn dishes and a customary welcome drink, all served with pudina chutney. Once you have had your fill of trying the 9-12 kebab variants, you can move on to the main course. Main course included fried rice, noodles, veg Manchurian, biriyani, chicken dishes, etc. Equal attention has been given to both veg and non veg options. Next comes dessert. Here we tried fresh fruits, cheese cake, sweets, ice cream. Not many choices in the dessert section, though. 
All the dishes are equally well prepared, although the starters steal the show. It is worth spending all the money. The service is impeccable. The decor is tastefully done. I'd highly recommend this place.

An upmarket restaurent serving really good north Indian and Chinese food.

I went there for a business lunch, and picked up a plate for buffet. The spread of food from soups to dessert is appreciable. The menu is well balanced out in terms of content and flavors.

Ambience is awesome, and there's  a feel good factor once you step inside. The double roof height and glass area creates a sense of space and light. 

Tandoori items - especially chicken - are good, succulent and well cooked. Fish - basically fillet item - are just average. Would highly recommend Dal Makhani, Butter paneer, Raita and Nan.

Some lip smacking food on a Sunday (03.07.2017) over lunch at this nicely decorated place made a fine end to the Sunday outing with my wife. 

We had a combo starter and then Kasmiri Pulao and Mutton Rara with Mixed Raita and the food was awesome with some courteous service by the staff. 

Looking forward to many more.

They r having undoubtedly Kolkata's best summer special combo. If you want to have a drink at a decent place without burning a hole in Ur pocket then this is the place to be. They have a summer special combo menu from which we choose d 299rs one it offers 2 650ml domestic beer and 3 non-vegetarian starter excluding. Trust me if u want to get high n u r low on budget then this is the place to visit. 
Will surely be visiting it soon.

The place looks great with a nice location and amazing decor.We had Malai reshmi kebab,Chicken fried rice and there were only two chinese side dishes of chicken.We ordered boh of them-Kung Pao Chicken and Chicken in Oyster sauce.We ordered both as they said that the former is a little spicy and the latter is spicy.But both of it tasted almost the same and they were equally spicy.

Very courteous and well behaved staff. Prompt service. Yet, the food lacked magic somehow. The Reshmi Kebab I ordered was not tender at all. The Murgh Biryani was bleak to taste. Nice atmosphere and good decor, but there's nothing phenomenal about the food.

I enjoyed the ambience. It's not one of those 'whatever you take, tastes great' restaurant. You'll have to be very specific with your choice of dishes, I personally liked their butter chicken from a la Carte, but the next time when I went for buffet I thought it was not worth it.

Went for lunch with family. Unfortunately the restaurant wasn't serving the famous buffet they are known for, and the staff was extremely apologetic and courteous to let us know the availability of only ala carte menu. But the disappointment ended there. What followed is mix of great food and even better service. The campus where the restaurant is located is itself a lovely place. Airy and full of natural light. We had chicken Pahari kebab, and fish achari tikka for starters and both were quite enjoyable. Followed up with naan, veg pulao, chicken Punjabi style with keema and chicken lucknowi. All the items had its own distinctive taste and the staff paid special attention towards suggesting the best of the lot on the menu. The naan was very soft and not rubbery as in most places. The pulao was like any other.

But what left me a tad disappointed was perhaps the maintenance of the restaurant premises. It's not that old but it already looks old. The furniture needs attention and is chipped in many places..but good experience

The ambience is very good... .. perfect for date..we order crispy chilli fish and drums of heaven .. I felt that they serve brilliant drums of heaven , it's a must try out dish .. However the fish didn't impress me at all.. It's was too smelly and too crispy.. In the main course we ordered, chicken kolapuri and chicken lababdar with jeera rice .. It was okay .. Taste could had been better .. Except the ambiance nothing impressed me at all

Jaisalmer is a beautifully located spacious restaurant which will immediately attract attention becoz of its location,decor and environment. As soon as u enter there are double chair tables which I would like to call as thrones bcz of their huge back rest.a couple can enjoy a very cozy and romantic lunch/dinner.once a friend of mine who had already visited this place told me - if u r a foodie u must go on a date at jaisalmer and I am happy that I did that
This restaurant gives shelter to big groups or families also.the buffet menu spread is awsome with Chinese and Indian dishes and the price is great.the owner is true love as he is professional, cheerful,helpful and friendly.
One sunday I organized a lunch for 25 people and how effortlessly I arranged that.all thanks to the owner and staffs.
Hereby I am attaching the menu which they had as Sunday chef's special menu.Indian dishes were tasty but I didn't like Chinese main course item's taste. But that's okay as I was already full with the starters and other Indian main course items.

I went there yesterday with my family that includes 15 people. As it is spacious we didn't have any problem in sitting together. 
This is my second visit here and the ambience is very good.
The service is really up to the mark.
The food is also good except the pan fried dishes. Those pan fried dishes they made over salty. The other food quality and quantity wise is above average and I prefer the Indian dishes here more than the Chinese ones.
I will highly recommended this place for a large group of people and I will surely visit again. 

The 50% off on BP has been the icing on the cake. üòã

Went for a buffet dinner and realised how poor the service is for such a renowned restuarant in an area where you tend to compete with the lights of Barbeque Nation, Ocean Grill, etc. The starters are nice but all the chicken(except kebabs) and fish preparations seem to be the same with a lot of peppers in them. Main course is somewhat still better but not good enough to fulfill your tastebuds dreams. Lastly the deserts are poor and limited in choice. No garnishing sauce for the icecreams. Gulab jamuns were having a stinging smell. And the brownies are only recieved after we had a talk with the managers about their poor service and quality. Overall would not recommend anyone to go there and enjoy a night out of buffet dinner.

The ambience was spacious and we'll decorated. I really liked it.
It was India Bangladesh match so the TV screen were showing the match....
Now coming to the food.. we opt for non veg buffet and trust me guys there were a lot of options... Yeah... Hell lot of options..
I was really impressed.
Everything we're good..
Special mention to kasturi fish kebab, crispy babycorn and mutton curry in the main course...
Main course too had lots of options... But there were very less desert... Which was little disappointing.. but it was ok as we got pretty good amount of food in that price range. We were also served complimentary lime sodas.. which was cool... :P
Overall I loved it and would visit really soon with my family....

This is a beautiful two storeyed restaurant with pretty interiors and nice sitting arrangements.
There are summer special combos and the regular lunch buffet.
We opted for two regular lunch buffets for us and took a mocktail seperately.
The buffet starts with a refreshing glass of fresh lime soda each.

‚Ä¢Starters-The starters comprised of a wide range of veg and non veg kebabs served hot and fresh one after another on the table.
The veg starters included dum aloo,chilli baby corn,Paneer tikka,hara kebab and crispy corn.
For me corn is the ultimate winner.
In non veg,there were plenty of starters like chicken drumstick,fish ajwani tikka,Chicken malai kebab, fish kebab,chicken tangri,mutton kebab.
Each and every kebabs are succulent and well smoked and tasted delicious.

‚Ä¢Maincourse-We were already full after having the starters.
The maincourse is simple.
It had a tasty chicken biryani,chicken rezala,mutton kosha;Sabji pulao,yellow dal,paneer butter,chinese vegetables,hakka noodles & mongolian fish.
All the items tasted nice but the fish was hard and not well cooked.

‚Ä¢Dessert-The dessert section is not much impressive and has basic stuffs like vanilla,mango icecream,brownies,caramel custard,nice fruit salad and sweets.
The items were fresh and tasted nice.

‚Ä¢Blue ocean mocktail-The mocktail tasted very nice and quite different from the regular blue lagoons we have.

The staffs are friendly and service is prompt.
Ambience is beautiful
And the starters will surely win the heart and the 4 points mainly because of it.
Prices are reasonable too.

JAISALMER ..!!

I knew it would be an experience having lunch here just by its name .

Visited this place during the weekend and came out with a happy feeling :)

Ambience : Top notch I would say . It's all about grandeur and those bright colours . There is a special aura the place has that you will fall in love with it .

We were 2 . We got to know about their Summer Special offers which were very cheap and I was smiling more and more on the inside xD .

Choice of beer with 2 pieces each of Mutton Kebabs , Chicken Kebabs and Fish starter for the nonveg combo..
Beer with 2 pieces of Hara Bhara Kebab , Tandoori Aloo and Mushroom Fritters for the vegans..

We ordered one veg and a non veg combo and everything tasted good if not excellent ..
All we were charged for 3 beers (650ml) and 12 pieces of starters (all combined) was 600 rupees ( inclusive of taxes ) ..! That's a STEAL .!!

Next we ordered from the Ala carte menu .. A Paneer Lababdar , Butter Naan and Cheese Masala Kulcha...The paneer dish was amazing but I was amazed after having the kulcha...so cheesy..! üòç

Service : Good..we didn't face any issues as the place was vacant apart from a few tables..

I am visiting again for sure :)

I like this place firstly because of its offerings. Secondly the beautiful & sober ambience. And thirdly and most important, its food and beverages. 
The place offers quite a sober and simple ambience. The service is good enough. The food is very nice, be it Chinese or North Indian (I personally choose between these cuisines). Drinks prices are kept moderate. 
Good place to enjoy with family or large groups.

Being the ever bustling next-gen officepara of Kolkata, Sector-5(Salt Lake) happens to be a place which is sure to leave anyone spoilt with choices with the varying options to walk in and indulge to a sumptuous meal, anytime...

And the name "Jaisalmer" happens to be a stalwart among them, where one can eat to his/her soul, and pamper the tastebud with the wide range of delectable offerings they have in their menu... üòÉ

From awesome 'COMBO MEALS' at shoestring price, to refreshing mocktails and all the others, the place seems to be a perfect one to fulfill your gastronomic cravings on a delectable note, while the neatly decorated interior and comfortable ambience, allow you to soothe your nerves and enjoy your meal, eventually making your each and every visit a delightful one for sure üòä

Went with my project team for dinner buffet on 26 May 2017. The staff was not friendly and service time was very long. The starters looked stale and we also found few iron screws and nuts in the starters. When we compalined this to the Manager in charge, his response was unapologetic and was very un-professional. Will not recommend thia place to anyone. There is no value for money spent and the behaviour of the manager was very bad.

I generally recommend this place in sector 5, but this time around they disappointed me. I went there on 26th may 2017 for office team dinner party. We ordered buffet this time around. What we got in the plate along with the chicken was a screw of about 3cm. When we complained the same to the manager of the restaurant, the manager replied in a very low tone that by mistake the screw has gone in food. We said the managwr that the person could have been severly injured by this and it might have been that we would niw be rushing to the hospital inspite of enjoying the dinner party. We asked for the compensation and the manager replied whatever you say. So we askwd for a drink for eaxh one of us who wish to. But he replied in a very rough tone this time that it will not be possible for them to provide for all of us. So we asked to leave him ans we do not need any compensation. I recommend everyone please check your food if you are going to have any.

Event: Summer Special Combo Tasting

It was a sunny afternoon when we visited Jaisalmer to taste their newly launched summer starter combo offer which is priced at Rs.189 for the vegetarian one and Rs.199 for the non-vegetarian version.

There are various choices to opt for in this combo, wherein we were served the offer where they serve 1 Bartender Special Mocktail+ Veg Starters

Our starter plate consisted of 3 types of starters with two pieces of each. We were served the Lazeez Paneer Tikka, Babri Aloo and A Cottage Cheese Stuffed Cabbage Spring Roll!

All the three varieties of Starters were delicious and satiating!

Moving over to the Mocktail; since we were a bunch of bloggers, we got to taste all the variety of Mocktails on  offer!
We tried the Green Lady, Sex on the Beach, Summer Breeze, Chocolate Muddy, Mini Colada, Mint Fazzel.
Out of all, our favourite picks are Green Lady, Sex on the Beach and Summer Breeze!
All three of these looked so colourful and was totally refreshing. 
Sex on the Beach was a medly of sweet orange mojito and a spicy touch! It is highly recommended!

Then for main course, we were served with Shaahi Pulao and Kadhai Paneer. Pulao was aromatic and the rice was perfectly cooked! Kadhai Paneer was flavourful and full of that north indian spices well prepared!

We had visited the restaurant before too, when we tried the Dal makhni, Kofta and Garlic nan. These were also yummy!

All in all, Jaisalmer is a very well designed and decorated fine dining restaurant which serves delicious and lip smacking food at any hour of the day! The staff is courteous and well trained..
We enjoyed our fooding experience here and would definitely keep visiting!

3 old friends and I reunited at Jaisalmer after a year over good food and cheap booze: the best kind of reunions!

The summer specials (for starters and drinks) are delightfully affordable and do not compromise on the quality of the kebabs - the condition being all 4 of us had to order a special each. The up side remained that everyone received a fair share of kebabs (8 to be precise). They were followed up by Chicken Rara Punjabi, Chicken Bharta, Tandoori Paneer Tikka Masala and Lasuni Naan. No room for complaints‚Äã. Flavours were spot on.

To summarise, we were so hungry and the food so scrumptious that we forgot to take pictures of it for the most part. The 2600 rupees (tax inclusive) were well spent.

Two beers and a platter of starters in sector 5 @ 499 only. Is it possible? Yes it is. The special summer offers at jaisalmer will let you grab. The interiors are ecstatic with broad tables and archaic chairs cushioned vibrantly. Bar stools are also available for single drinkers in front of bartender. Ambience is good but the delivery is slow. The rates otherwise are higher compared to quality.

Visited this place last weekend with friends. The place was huge however most of it was closed since they lacked the requisite number of staff to attend to tables hence despite having empty tables we had to wait for good 30mins. Food was good nothing exceptional. Prices were apt for the quantity they served. However service was slow and poor. The manager they called "captain" was a well behaved and courteous man and attended to guests politely. I would like to go back to this place on a good day.@

Themed restaurant 
Although zomato rating is low but trust me they are not that bad
We took murgh pardha kabab(soo good )
Tanduri ruti
Chiken preparation ( forget the name )
Lastly we took one Dal makhani
If you are a chiken lover go for it
Jaisalmer is soo trustful in this scenario

One of the classics dhaba in our neighbourhood.
Their seating arrangement is of chairs and of different colours ( kind of appealing :p )
They have their private seating area also but those are for a capacity of more than 10-12 people.
Prompt service and delicious food makes the customer come frequently.

Not always go by recommendation!!!  
Tried out for family dinner, situated in Globsyn Building of Sector V. We had ordered Ala Carte from menu Bharwan Aloo, Chicken Bhatti Kebab, Fish Tikka Butter Masala, Butter Naan, Malai Kofta, Masala Kulcha and Hot Gulab Jamun. Foodies taste wise overrated, not that much of mouth-watering! Service was very slow and you have to ask for water, cutlery and accompaniments every single time. Coursewise have a long gap to get the food and clear of plates... which is quite awful... can't say value of money! Overall will think twice for second time. Need to focus more on customer service.

The taste of non-veg food was very good, but veg ones needs much improvement. The desserts were less in variety and needs improvement too.

The service was good but a bit delayed.

A fancy decor,nice sitting arrangements..great food..well behaved staffs and the water pools infront of the Restro..üòä All good..üëç

It was Sunday night..we visited Jaisalmer. Situated at sector 5,near the KFC outlet..üòä

We ordered summer breeze as a mocktail..which is basically a mix of four juices as they said and a bit spicy..üòâ Yes..mocktail and spicy..u will realize this after u take a sip. üòÄ

Ok then we had murg bhatti kabab for starter which they suggested and said it will take 15mints to serve..and we were ok with it. So this kabab is basically made with the chicken skin on..so crispy outside,and juicy inside..giving a blast of flavours in ur mouth..ü§ó A good start to our dinner..üëå 

For main course we ordered butter nan ans murg lababdar..the nan was crispy and buttery and 2 nan was more than enough for two of us. üòê 
The murg lababdar was yet another super tasty dish..6pieces of boneless chickens..cooked to perfection in a tomato based,spicy creamy gravy..tasted just amazing..the gravy was lipsmacking..üòçüòç 

Loved our time out there..and will surely visit this place very soon. Would recommend to all...they also have a huge variety of vegeterian dishes and buffet system is also available. üôÇ

Located at the heart of kolkata's IT hub, Jaisalmer, with its vibrant and colourful interior will remind you of the royalty of Rajasthan. White pillars, colourful chairs and walls, colourful lights,regal seating arrangements, an eye catching bar right at the entrance , the glass wall -all of these together serve to create a majestic outlook. The ambience will definitely lift your mood after a busy day at work. But the resemblance between this place and Rajasthan is only limited to the name and the ambience as it does not serve Rajasthani foods as one might assume. It mainly specialises in North Indian and awadhi cuisine but the Chinese section is also noteworthy. We went there to celebrate the birthday of one of my friends and Our experience was quite good. We opted for the Chinese and ordered crispy chicken, sichuan fried rice, kung pao chicken along with budwisers. As for the quantity, three bowls of rice and two plates of kung pao chicken were more than enough for the six of us. Coming to the taste of the dishes..crispy chicken and sichuan fried rice were nothing extraordinary but quite good. Kung pao chicken tastes like regular chilli chiken though. Didn't feel any difference. But Keeping the cheap pricing in mind, I would say that the  quality and taste of the dishes were decent enough to give it a try.  The staffs were well behaved. The service was quick. Overall i am satisfied and will definitely visit again to taste the north indian cuisine.

Service was good but can be better.. We ordered for chicken pahari kebab, cheese garlic naan, chicken lababdaar, mutton biriyani n fresh lime soda.. Cheese garlic naan n the fresh lime soda tasted out of this world, but the rest of the dishes tasted so average.. At this price range you expect better dishes..

Very poor packing for delivery items.
This was the second time when delivery boy comes with all containers lid open and the gravy of all items mixed and Nan mixed with soup. How can the delivery boy say to accept such parcel.
When talked with Jaisalmer they have simply said that you have ordered through Zomato so get this settled through Zomato. After talking with Zomato, they have informed that they will refund, But what about the time and they are not concerned how I will arrange food as I have invited my friends.
Delivery boy was saying restaurant has given with such packing.
I was very embarrased as I have invited my friends. Finally, I have to run to other restaurant and brought the food.
Earlier also same thing happened.
Packing is very worse, at least they can put a tape for sealing as other restaurant does.

I have been to this restaurant many a times, had tried their buffet which is not at all good mainly for those who are starter focused; but main course was good ... At the beginning one year back dessert was good but now the quality is degrading ... Now coming to Al-a-carte, you must try some of the signature dishes. In starter you should try Chicken Lasuni kebab, your taste buds will dance in joy ; in side dish non-veg u must try mutton rara punjabi if you do not take mutton u can try chicken rara punjabi with basmati rice or tandoori roti or butter nun ... u will relish this combination ... Also u must try mutton rogan josh, mouth watering ... also in veg starters u can try crispy chilli babycorn, seriously very good ... and in side dish paneer butter masala and dal makhni with roti or poulao ... If u are a biriyani fan u can try biriyani out here ... A very good restaurant for family parties, birthday treats ; ample amount if space ... one bad thing about this restaurant is service ... for buffet when they serve starters service is worst, you will loose your interest... other than that service time is managable...

The place is a bad cover for the book, taking into account the name it goes by and the menu it offers. Thinking of Jaisalmer the first thought in mind is to have a Rajasthani menu or a Rajasthani section to say the least. Well, you guessed it right, this place has none. The grand entrance that welcomes you through the facade leads you into a grand seating area laid out spaciously in the ample space housing this restaurant. The menu has all you can think of, and is served in the perfect form too. The food quality is awesome but the name fiasco stole half a rating for me. Would love to see the inclusion of some Rajasthani touch to the menu as changing the name would be a more expensive tact.

The staffs are not very much courtesious. Overall a very bad experience.

Jaisalmer- the name exudes grandeur and luxury, but a visit to this restaurant was a rude shock and I'm sorry to say, it was one of the worst restaurants I have ever been to. We were a group of 9 friends hoping to enjoy our Friday evening but choosing to dine in Jaisalmer was a bad decision. The staff was not at all bothered and even after 15 minutes they had not served water or come to take the order. Nevertheless we ordered 3 side dishes-crispy chilli baby corn ,chicken Pahari kebab and drums of heaven. The baby corn dish and drums of heaven were tasty and the only dishes in our total order which were delicious. The chicken kebab was stiff and burnt.
For the main course we had ordered chicken fried rice, kung pao chicken, chicken schezwan noodles, chicken lababder, paneer lababder, Lucknowi chicken handi and nan, tandoori roti.1 special chicken biriyani at ‚Çπ280 , which was just enough ‚Äãfor one person, burnt a hole in our pocket . The Chinese dishes were not at all tasty , schezwan noodles being overly spicy. Please beware of ordering the chicken Lucknowi handi, an absolutely bland dish and just edible to say the least. Chicken and paneer lababder were okay, nothing special. The worst items were the Indian breads - nan and tandoori roti. The nan was quite hard and rubbery and the roti was totally burnt. My nan had a plastic string in it and after bringing it to the notice of the staff, they cancelled the order without offering a fresh piece. The ambience is quite modern with English songs playing (I expected Rajasthani folk music).
The restaurant is an absolute disgrace to the name it has chosen for itself. To sum up, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone who would like to enjoy a sumptuous meal, it's probably good enough for light snacks along with alcoholic drinks.

One of my friend threw a success party ( or you can call it a "treat") in Jaisalmer two weeks ago. So me and my 5 other friends went for a buffet dinner. This place is situated in the prime location of salt lake. So we didn't face any difficulty to find it. However, they offered us two types of welcome drinks. They served 5-6 types of veg and 5-6 types of non veg starters. Some of them were really good. I liked mutton kebab the most. There were chicken biriyani, mutton Bhuna, one chicken dish, noodles, fried rice, one fish preparation etc. I loved the chicken biriyani. It was non-spicy and delicious. When I went to the dessert section I got really disappointed. They had only two types of ice creams (chocolate and vanilla), brownies, cream caramel and Gulaab jamuns. Gulaab jamus were hot and tender. But the caramel dessert was really pathetic, burnt and bitter in taste. The staffs were polite but a little slow. They should work on that.

The place is spacious.
Tried their a-la-carte menu.
Starters were OK.
Main course was not at all as expected. It was quite ordinary and overpriced.
The worst thing about this place is their service.
We were a big team of around 20 people.
The waiters were confused about our orders.
They served foods to wrong tables and when we corrected them they were unable to decipher the instructions.
They were eager to clear the table and in a point were actually pushing us to have the lunch faster and cleared plates that were not at all finished.

Very poor, pathetic restaurant. Service is not at all friendly and very ill mannered. They were serving like they were forced to do so and doing a very big favor in doing so. I would rather go to a road side stall and eat atleast they will respect me and provide food with good manners if cleanliness and hygiene can be ignored. 

Speaking about cleanliness I found a worm in a Gulab Jamun, and they were totally cool with this I believe this is totally normal for them and happenes quite frequently :P

Huge quantitaties of starter was served. All was hot and tasty. The management handled this crowd pretty well which is rare.

Tawa gosht and chicken burrah kebab was too good...

I would highly recommend this place for any corporate parties.

Only suggestions would be better sound systems and  more cosy lightings.

Satyajit Ray‚Äôs ‚ÄòSonar Kella‚Äò has already brought in the Jaisalmer vibes into the Bengali regime. And now amidst the busiest streets of the infotech, MNCs, and business park bound Salt Lake City, there stands the fine-dine restaurant Jaisalmer with all its royal set-up in one of the most business-oriented buildings of Salt Lake Sector V, Globsyn Crystals. The restaurant has an overall royal and regal set-up which is well evident from its colorful decor, vibrant interiors, ambient lighting and those royal seating arrangements. You actually feel the royal presence once you are here.

‚ÄãJaisalmer, the name, relates you to Rajasthan. A restaurant with this name in Kolkata might give you the chance to assume that you might find Rajasthani cuisine here. Well it‚Äôs not ! Jaisalmer specialises mostly in Awadhi and Mughlai dishes, which nowhere else in the vicinity prepares with such excellence. Jaisalmer, the term, signifies royalty and so does this place. Located in Globsyn Crystal, Sector 5, this place is definitely the best option if you‚Äôre looking for a family restaurant. The vibrant and colourful decor is something praiseworthy. The restaurant occupies two floors of the Globsyn building and can accomodate around 200 people at a time. The restaurant is designed with a big royal entrance which rightfully justifies the name, which has Rajasthani royalty in it. The designers have played wonderfully with colours. The colourful light, colour of the walls, cushions, tables and chairs will surely lift your mood and brighten up your day.

Salt lake sector V is the IT hub of Kolkata with swanky workplaces and offices everywhere. Jaisalmer, with its majestic outlook and grandeur serves as the largest oasis in this desert land of offices and work culture. It's true that Sector V, in the last few years has seen a number of restaurants cropping up, but Jaisalmer by far stands the tallest among them.

Located at Globsyn Crystals, Jaisalmer brings the royalty and grandeur of Rajasthan to Kolkata with its picturesque interiors and magnificent buffet spread. If you're looking for luxurious dining, then this is the place to be. Plush seating arrangements with state of the art d√©cor - you name it and Jaisalmer has it!

Buffet places are a trending thing now in Kolkata. And if you happen to be in and around Salt lake, Jaisalmer is one of the best options for lavish buffet lunches and dinners. Once you enter the beautiful place, I assure you that you're not going to be disappointed.

Last week I was invited for a food tasting event here with my foodie friends and my oh my! I was dazzled with the experience. The food, the d√©cor, the service - everything was impeccable. So without much ado let's start talking food.

STARTERS :

Since it was a buffet lunch, we all know that the starters would be in the limelight for the afternoon. And surely they stole all the praise and applause from all of us. To begin with we were served with 7 kinds of kebabs. Yes you read that correct, SEVEN! Now time for a detailed description of each.

‚Ä¢ Paneer Tikka Kebab - Frankly, I'm not very fond of vegetarian kebabs, but this was something else absolutely! The Paneers were soft and juicy and excellent to taste. Really hadn't expected so much from a veg dish (okay, I sound biased)!

‚Ä¢ Veg Nilgiri Seekh Kebab - This again was a vegetarian kebab which was green in colour. This was made of a number of vegetables mixed with flour and spinach. I found the texture a tad bit too dry, but the taste was quite good!

‚Ä¢ Murgh Kasturi Kebab - This was my favourite from the afternoon. Juicy succulent pieces of chicken served piping hot. It tasted brilliant! The size of the kebabs, too were overwhelming.

‚Ä¢ Murgh Lasooni Kebab - The pieces were huge and the flavour of garlic was perfectly balanced making it another favourite of mine. If you're at Jaisalmer, don't forget to try this particular kebab dish.

‚Ä¢ Achari Fish Kebab - Being a bong how can I not have a soft corner for fish kebabs? Indeed my fish cravings were satiated by this immensely well prepared dish. There were 8 pieces of fish which were slightly charred on the surface but juicy on the interior. The pieces literally melted in my mouth, as a result of which my heart melted too. Strongly recommended!

‚Ä¢ Mutton Seekh Kebab - No kebab fiesta is complete without this happening dish. Wherever you are, if your kebab platter does not have Mutton Seekh Kebab, you know you're losing out on life! This dish is downright my favourite, and that coming from a mutton avoider is a lot! I simply go gaga over Seekh Kebab and Jaisalmer's rendition of this very famous kebab warmed the cockels of my heart.

‚Ä¢ Adrak e Panje - This was another Mutton dish which looked outstanding. The platter itself looked so appealing that I couldn't stop from digging in. By the name itself we can understand that this dish has a very distinct flavour of ginger. Although the taste was brilliant, I found the texture of the meat slightly chewy.

With this ended the great Kebab Fiesta. Now coming to the main menu for the afternoon.

MAIN COURSE :

The buffet had a lot to offer in terms of main course. But unfortunately I was extremely full by the time I reached main items. There was a combination of Chinese and North Indian dishes on the menu, each of which looked extremely appealing and appetizing.
The main course consisted of -

‚Ä¢ Vegetable Corn Fried Rice
‚Ä¢ Hakka Noodles
‚Ä¢ Murgh Biryani
‚Ä¢ Chicken Rarra Ghosht
‚Ä¢ Mutton with Capsicums
‚Ä¢ Fish in Bell Pepper Sauce
‚Ä¢ Dal Makhani
‚Ä¢ Nilimili Sabzi
‚Ä¢ Paneer Butter Masala

However, I was too full to try out each and every dish. Hence my lunch comprised of Corn Fried Rice paired with Fish in Bell Pepper Sauce, and Biryani with Mutton and Capsicums. The biryani was brilliant and so was the mutton dish. The gravy was oily and sinful making my tummy extremely happy. The fried rice on the other hand was light and the fish had a very subtle taste and flavour. Out of everything, the fish in bell pepper sauce stole my heart!

DESSERTS :

Every meal is incomplete without desserts and so at every buffet place I'm more interested in the dessert section than anything else. At Jaisalmer too, I was eagerly waiting for the desserts. The dessert section honestly, was fabulous. It had Gulabjamuns, Caramel Custard, Chocolate Brownies, Payesh and ice-cream. Being a glutton that I am, I tried each and every item from the dessert menu and my favourites were the Caramel Custard and Payesh. The sponge Gulabjamuns too, were quite delightful.

With this ended our appetizing lunch at Jaisalmer and we were so full by the end of it! The experience was fabulous and I'm craving to go there again. This place deserves too many visits owing to its royal ambience and perfect food! So if you're in the mood to pamper yourself with delicacies, there's no other place you'd rather be in than Jaisalmer!

As a resident of Kolkata, Salt Lake, to me, is all about forest of skyscrapers, MNCs for techies and maze of roads. But, in the middle of all things metropolitan, there‚Äôs a bit of the old-world royalty from India‚Äôs land of majesty ‚Äì Rajasthan; and, that was an exciting find for me. In one of the busiest commercial buildings in the city, Globsyn Crystal, in Salt Lake, is Jaisalmer, one of the most beautiful restaurants that I have visited in the city. It specialises in North Indian food, which can be enjoyed in the breath-taking regal setting, overlooking the cars plying on the roads of Kolkata. Yes, that‚Äôs Jaisalmer in Kolkata for you ‚Äì¬† a bit of Rajasthan‚Äôs Golden City, right here in the City of Joy.
                                                                ...

Dwellers of the techie alleys of Kolkata always look out for fancy dining spots in their vicinity apart from bugs in their code! And when there is demand, there has to be supply to strike a balance. As a result, Saltlake Sector-V and its surrounding areas house some of the best brands in the F&B industry in Kolkata, apart from numerous small rising and promising eateries. This area is studded with gastropubs, swanky hotels, bars, buffet places, caf√©s, dessert parlors, bakeries, thali joints, biriyani houses, lounges and even micro-breweries! But, the maximum rush is during the lunch hours and the best bet during that time is surely the thali and the buffet joints for many. When it comes to buffet places there are only few trusted names in this area. Jaisalmer is surely one of them. It is one of the busiest casual dining restaurants in the city of joy. Apart from buffet lunch, this is the ideal place for that very special night out and one of the best spots in Salt Lake to watch the sunset ‚Äì right from your dining table! This place surely has got a subtle royal touch to it that makes you feel special from the moment you walk in. An afternoon or night at Jaisalmer will have you basking in the peaceful and relaxing atmosphere in that pleasant royal setting.
                                          ...

A very popular restaurant in Sector V. I dined here with my team on Valentine's Day,2017. 

The things I liked:
1. We were given a very pretty round table with the Valentine's Day decorations
2. Mutton Rara Punjabi, and Jhaal farezi out of the dishes we had

Things I didn't like:
1. The service was pretty slow. (Assuming that this was because of the Valentine's Day rush)
2. The Tangdi kebabs had a slight odour of kerosine
3. The Reshmi chicken was a little bland


The overall decor and location of this restaurant are major winners. They rest just bring it down the overall quality.

Valentine's day and a buffet on the plate ... so far so good .. but then nothing special ..ambience okay ..food..well biriyani and mutton were good .. starters which were served on the table were not up to the mark ...staff well behaved ... I felt they lacked planning ..as waiters had to wait on cooks to serve the starters ... shouldn't be that way per me ... but will like to come again on a non-special day ... btw deserts seems to be yum .. but am yet to try them

The service is very commendable. Now coming to the main part, we ordered a few drinks with dry chilly lamb and crispy chilly baby corn as starters. The lamb was lip-smacking. Worth a visit.

Wasn't up to our expectation.

The place was recommended to me by a friend. So we planned to have our team lunch buffet there. The interiors were very well decorated, with various kinds of colours here and there. Adequate light was coming in as one side was made of glass. The area was also spacious enough. But the appreciation stops here.

The starters were plently, but almost all of them were too oily and deep fried. The fish starter was having a sea fish smell which was too overpowering. Apart from that there was one item, a gravy salad, which we liked. But on requesting for more the waiter said that it is coming but it never came. Disappointed, we moved on to the main course.

In the main course there was biryani, noodles, naan, dal makhani, fish chilli, mixed vegetables, paneer butter masala, mutton etc. But none of these were any good.

When we came for desserts, we saw that there was kept a pot for sweet and sour soup. Who keeps a soup pot in the desserts section? Otherwise we had tried that before the main course. Coming to the desserts, there weren't much items kept there except for kheer, gulab jamun, some fruits, pudding and three flavours of ice-cream. We also saw that there was a shortage of bowls.

So overall, we were really disappointed with this place's service and food. Won't visit this place again.

We celebrated a friend's birthday here and overall it was a beautiful experience. Doesn't look like real Jaisalmer but a very pretty lively and sophisticated ambience will definitely set your mood, also they have an eye-catching bar just in the entrance. I personally loved the white chairs and the white pillars.
We opted for buffet, which was 600 for one person. Tbh it is really inexpensive because their buffet variety is extensive. They them self serve starters on table which includes baby corn, fried corn, chicken and fish items, paneer, kebabs etc which itself was so filling and heavy that we almost forgot that their is maincourse too. Starters also include a kind of mango mocktail.
Coming to the main course, there was not much variety in VEG. I can just recall pulao, chowmein daalmakhni and paneer. While my friends preferred chicken biryani.
Coming to the best part of the dinner- the desserts. ‚ù§Ô∏è so soft and good that it will melt in your mouth within a second. Caramel, brownie, Indian sweets and 2 ice creams would simply satisfy your taste buds. üòä
One can expect a fast, cooperating service. Birthday candles were decorated as we asked them, birthday cake was properly cut into pieces and served. Everything was good from their side however the only disturbing thing was that the staffs stare a lot at everything you do. Be it clicking pictures or merrymaking with your friends, their eyes was constantly on us which made us very uncomfortable.

Well, I went there for my birthday lunch with my roomie. As soon as you enter this place,you will love the ambience there. Big hall with white furnitures everywhere,a well stocked bar and mirrors on the walls. We ordered for mutton adrak k panje with butter nuns and another mutton side dish. It tasted average. But the waiters are horrible there. They have absolutely zero knowledge about whats in the menu. You ask them for something and they serve something else. So the service disappointed us mainly. Its bit costly compare to the other restaurants  serving north indian foods with better tastes. Overall one time visit is okay.

First Review : 7th Jan 2017

To be honest.. one of the worst place I have ever visited till date. I had a very good feedback about this place earlier from my frnds and colleagues but unfortunately it turned out to be something which wasnt xpected... moreover very ridiculous disgusting and mostly shocking attitude of the staff . Starter was nice but served in a very unprofessional manner. When we asked to repeat some starter items it was served but there was a delay in serving. If u guys are not properly trained about how to deal with customer then first ask ur management to make u learn some gestures and courtesy. Biriyani was rotten and ice cream was looking lyk a milk/chocolate shake. When we asked for a bowl , staff replied "we serve bowl for soup only" shockingly that was a poor rather idiotic stupid meaningless and foolish reply from a staff of such kind of restora. A bitter and rotten experie@nce from such a place. Anyone visiting this place please go for alacarte. And my suggestion would be DO NOT EXPECT GOOD HOSPITALITY FROM THEIR STAFF.

Second Review : 8th Jan 2017

I am compelled to write a second review in regard to Jaisalmer which is unfortunately not a positive one. Since I was displeased with their food quality and staff behaviour I had given a not-so-great feedback on Zomato. But never did I expect them to call me back and xchanged an unusual conversatiom with unusual and unwelcomwords. First they asked me about my organisation and then they literally asked me why I have given such a negative review for which our organisation might suffer as customers while paying a visit to the neighbourhood food joints henceforth. I was taken aback with such a call. FIRSTLY IF U ARE SAYING THAT ANY CUSTOMER'S FEEDBACK WONT EFFECT UR BUSINESS SO IN THAT CASE U PEOPLE WOULD NOT HAVE CALLED ME....SECONDLY IF U R ASKING WHY I HAVE GIVEN SUCH REVIEW ALTHOUGH U HAVE GIVEN ME 10% ADD ON DISCOUNT.? WELL U GUYS ARE MATURED ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE DISCOUNT OFFER IS NO WHERE RELATED WITH THIS REVIEW... Such a doleful experience I had with this restaurant!!Souvik Sarkar

Thumbs down for this place :/
Yes decor was majestic and that's the only good thing about this place.
 The kebabs(fish hariyali, babycorn kebab,drums of heaven, chicken hariyali,mutton bara kebab & chilly fish) were delicious crunchy n were served hot.
Biryani wasn't good at all. It was stinking and watery too until it was refilled on complaining.
Mutton n fish were fine though.
Complementary welcome drink was not served as requested.
We had ordered two sweet & salt fresh lime soda. But they served only the sweet one inspite of requesting twice.
Staff wasn't attentive rather they argued with us as we complained about the ice cream. It was molten..not fresh at all.
I'm highly disappointed.

Avoid this place if you value service .Utterly sloppy experience.
We were a office group of 30 of us, for Dinner buffet, and I would surely not recommend this place. The service is very laid back and the waiters have a very casual attitude to the customer issues. ¬†The Veg starters were overly mediocre, Even when we expressed our dislike, they did nothing about it (again a very casual attitude) while the Non veg Starters were good (Mutton being and exception). The main course section was cold, yes literally cold. The welcome drink was a pathetic version of lime cordial. The dessert section was sloppy, had a very dry pie, sloppy custrad, bad jamoons and melted ice crams. They did not oblige to provid e a bowl for the ice creams.

Jaisalmer was first time for us...I planned birthday treat for my wife at this restaurant-cum-bar. Since I know it will be not so crowded, I choose this place for dinner yesterday...Ambiance and interior decoration is impressive...Alcohol variety is there(had budwiser and antiquity blue)..pricing is also fine...coming to the food...you (jaisalmer guys) need to work really hard on this portion, we had gone for dinner buffets(600/-+Tax)...their veg & non-veg starters are horrible in taste with some fishy smell..except for Hariyali Fish and Chicken Drumsticks...the non-veg items in the main course were full of oil...we were not able to eat any one of those except peas pulao and yello dal...their dessert was moderate in quality and variety...of all their buffet items, we liked their ICE Cream...My suggestion is to go there, take some side dish (we tried tandoori chicken--okay in taste) with alcohol, don't go for their buffets, though on my part, I will hardly recommend this restaurant to anybody....A BIG NO NO!! (they ruined our celebration with their pathetic food)..

Jaisalmer was first time for me. I loved their ambience and decor. So spacious and nicely decorated. We ordered a budwiser and black dog. We were too full so didn't order much food. Only mixed fried rice and garlic chicken. Rice was amazing so much chicken and prawns were there. Chicken literally melted in mouth. Prices weren't too high. Will definitely go again to try their indian menu.

Time is money...... Had been here with my friend n his family n mine too on 25th dec eve.. N had a poor experience with jaisalmer. The food they served was really good but the service they provided was too poor,  the reason being we were kept waiting for our ala-carte main course for more than an hour and we were at the resturant till 11.15 which was actually too late. If u really hav time constraints avoid the aforesaid resturant but i should say for foodies wid lots of time should visit.

Impressed but the outlook and decor from outside, I visited the restaurant for the dinner buffet.
The decor is beautiful; gives you a royal feeling, and the restaurant is immensely spacious!!

Coming to the food : Everything was proper and well cooked. Just loved the flavors! The starters and main course had a great spread! The desert spread is something they need to work on. Pudding and gulaab jamun were the essence of the spread, nothing else though! Nevertheless, they were very tasty.
¬† 
One minus point is about the waiters. They didn't seem to know the menu properly in the main course spread!!

The services for starter in buffet are expected to be better. As compared to BBQ / Chai break, the services are too slow. In main course, I have found Chicken Biriyani Without any chicken, the desert is almost finished. Ice cream Rack is empty.¬†
Pros :-
1) The taste of Mutton dishes are really good.¬†
2) The taste for starters are really good.
Cons :-
1) Services needs to be improved.
2) Number of items are high but the taste for most of the items (Except mentioned in pros) are not at per.

I would like to suggest you to reduce the number of items but maintain the quality and taste for all the items at same level.

This was a makeshift option for evening food endeavor. Jaisalmer is a quite good restaurant in terms of elegance in the decor, one can get the feel of royalty in the decor the moment one enters the restaurant. 

Place : Situated in the premises of Globsyn Crystal, besides the large fountain pool. You can take a Uber or probably any mode of transportation and get down at sector V and ask for this place, people around would be able to direct you to the correct direction. 

Ambiance : As mentioned already the interior is quit shimmery, bright lights , spacious, beautifully decorated indoors, quilted seats. You get to see this throne sized sofas around some of the tables, was thrilled to seat on them, but it didn't happened in the end. 
Food : Opted for the buffet and to say the food did not disappointed me. Kebab were well prepared and tender. The fish and Paneer were quite tasty along with we had the chicken drumsticks, tandoori chicken stuffed potatoes crispy babycorn and more. After all those starters I was so full that I had to compromise on the main course, but to mention the biriyani could have been a little less heavy and had the mutton been a bit tender it would have been a delight, but to none the less the the gulabjamun and ice cream in the desert balanced my dismay. 

Service : Am a bit disappointed with the service, though there were not people in the restaurant the attendents were seemed busy with any reason. Probably there love for ISL increased that day. We had to call for every other person to attend us every time we need something and the response came another 15-20mins later. 

Overall : The place + The ambiance + The food -  The service, may rate it a bit above average. Pocket pinch well you may say convenient.

The mesmerizing decor along with its soothing ambiance are the key features of the Jaisalmer restaurant in Salt Lake, Sector 5. The grand entrance, the spacious sitting arrangements, the glass facade of the outlet will definitely make you think of throwing a grand party here. 

I will never forget my visit to this awesome place with my cousins, where we had some authentic dishes. We all decided to go for the signature dishes of the outlet, so we ordered- Tandoori paneer tikka, kadai paneer, dal makhani, gulab jamun and  tandoori roti. All the dishes were absolutely grand in flavors. As, we had quite a good time in the restaurant, I must recommend you all to visit this cool place once.

Went there for both buffet and a la carte and was quite impressed. Firstly never faced waiting there. Even in Friday lunch they accommodated 10 people for buffet immediately.
This restaurant has majestic decor and ambience. Service is also satisfactory.
The buffet menu is up to the mark. Like other buffet restaurant they don't have grill in the table. They serve the kababs in your plate, so sometimes you have to wait a long for your kababs. Main course and dessert was good enough. However they could have arrange some varieties in the dessert section.
Obviously the price is on the higher side but it's justified for the service they are providing. They also arrange some corporate discounts but you have to ask for it.

Visited this restaurant on a Wednesday evening with a friend and it was all empty with no diners out there, may be that's why the upstairs seating wasn't functional then.
As soon as you enter the place you get that fine dining feel with ample amount of lights and well arranged seating. Had ordered North Indian food and I must say that it was quite delicious. The service was quick as well.
Rightly said, it offers great food at reasonable prices. Brownie points for 15% discount on payment through Axis bank debit card.
The only thing that I didn't like was the staff standing near the table all the time, keeping a watch on us.
To sum it up, I would recommend this restaurant to anyone searching a place for fine dinning without making a hole in your pocket.

Went with office group of five on Tuesday lunch. We ordered pretty quickly as we had to return to office.
We ordered mix of veg and non-veg items for different set of people.
All the dish like the tandoori roti,mix veg, lucknawi malai chicken were very good along with starters.
I also had Blue lagoon drink which was impressive looking and tasted good.
Lastly, the ambience was good and service was prompt and its certainly worth what you pay for.

Went there few weeks ago with family without knowing the quality of it. It was late around 10pm. We ordered dinner with soup and starters. Everything except for the soup was great. The "sweet corn soup" was just like rice water. It was replaced but that too was not good either.

Anyways coming to the food now... The food was really good. For the 1st time we didn't feel bloated after the dinner. Quantity was OK but quality was really good.

An absolutely wonderful place with great ambience and even better food. We had celebrated my parents' 25th anniversary on the 1st of december and we were extremely happy. Courteous staff behaviour, good management, great seating arrangement with lavish spread of buffet menu. All the foods were delivered fresh and hot, even though we had so mamy people. Extra arrangements had been made as per our demands. The buffet was mouth watering with a wide variety of veg and non-veg starters. The biriyani , mutton and chicken korma deserve special mention from the main course. Desserts were pretty good as well, especially the kheer and gulabjamun. A must visit for all the foodies out there. Also a perfect place for hosting parties because of the spacious floor space and seating arrangements. 
Thank you Jaisalmer!

Excellent experience. Had been there for our office team lunch on 3rd December 2016. Food was great; perfectly cooked, specially the starters were finger-licking. Service was also excellent considering that they were serving 30 people, our plates were always full. Mutton Kasha in the main course blew our minds.
Milk Colado and Apple fizz were the best of mocktails I ever had. Overall, awesome food, excellent serving coupled with great customer service, made our experience outstanding.

I went to this place last Friday along with my team mates ¬†for dinner. This restaurant is located in the 1st floor Globsyn Crystals Buildng, Sector V, serving North Indian and Chinese Cuisines.

The restaurant has a grand entrance. It has two floors and very much spacious. The restaurant can easily host more than a couple of big groups. The ambience is neatly done. Hanging lamp over each table. Wooden tables and chairs with leather seats. Some of the walls are decorated with mirrors. The bar cum counter has a roof hanging decorated with inverted wine glasses which I found cool.

The staffs were efficient, cordial, accommodating and were open to real time suggestions.

We opted for Buffet. They serve the starter to your table which includes both veg and non veg items - Crispy Baby Corn, Tandoori Paneer Tikka, Stuffed Potato, Roasted Chicken, Galouti Kebab, Mutton Kebab, Chicken Drumstick , Tandoori Fish so on so forth. Taste wise all were good except for the fish.

The main course included Jafran Rice, Murgh Biriyani, accompanied by Chicken and Mutton dishes.

The dessert included Gulab Jamun, Brownies, Kheer, so on so forth.

Overall a nice experience and ideal of large group going for lunch / dinner.

At first I would like to make it clear that I generally don't give negative review normally but today I had a really bad experience with Jaisalmer. As compared to last time when I came here on my friend's birthday and had a really good experience, this time I was very much disappointed. I had opted for Non-Veg buffet and Starters were really bad and there were very limited choices for Desserts and Main course was pretty ordinary. All I ended up eating were Chicken Biryani and chicken Curry.

Ambience was great. Location was excellent. We opted for Friday Buffet. It has a wide range of veg/non-veg starters which were delicious. After finishing the starters we didnt have space for anything more. The spread of main dishes were also good although they never served the Naan / Roti I opted for. The sweets sections was superb specially the Gulab Jamun(its fantastic- take my word). Overall a nice experience and would definitely recommend.

This is one Indian Restaurant where I got a very corporate-ish feel (Lower floor).

Food we'd ordered for-

Tandoori Aloo
Paneer Tikka
Masala Peanuts
Chilli Paneer
Crispy Chilli Baby Corn
Masala ThumsUp
Garlic Naan
Kabuli Naan
Kulcha
Dum Aloo
Dal Makhani
Pindi Chana

EVerything was good. But the Kabuli Naan was extremely bad. Couldn't have had it more than a bite.

This place is a decent place to go. A little monotonous but not bad. It can be fun if you'dcome here in large groups.

Jaisalmer is a nice restaurant when you need some entertainment and want to hangout with your friends. Bar and live sports screening is also available here which makes it better. Despite these, many things here are not upto the mark. Firstly, this is probably one of the worst places when you need a peaceful environment. A lot of noise I believe, sometimes spoils the scene. Secondly, the waiters are not very efficient and their quality should be better. Thirdly, this place is a bit overpriced. Ignoring these problems, this is a decent joint.

I have been there long time ago and I had that taste in mind. It was so good that I recommended my colleagues to go there. So I was hugely disappointed and embarrassed when I visited the place this Friday. The food was well below average in taste and the service was equally bad. We had ordered three dishes of chicken out of which none of them tasted fresh. Specially, Kadai chicken was tasting undercooked and kind of stale. Upon informing they did replace that but that was also not well cooked. Being in sector 5 they should really improve the service and quality of food to just be in the game.

We visited this place a few days back, looking for lunch after some work nearby. This is located conveniently in sector V, Salt Lake City near Webel More, in the same building that houses KFC. The place is quite spacious, having seating arrangements over two floors. Ambiance is pretty nice. There are large television sets installed so you can watch the latest match while enjoying your food. We ordered Murgh Biriyani, Butter Naan and Chicken Bharta. One thing that surely deserves a special mention here is the swiftness with which the food was served. We really did not have to wait much at all. So, praise indeed for the quick service. As for the food, it was good, if not great. The Murgh Biriyani was quite good in fact, and quite light too, unlike some biriyani meals which make you feel bloated afterwards. chicken Bharta too was good. It was not too expensive as well. We would say that this place would be a good pick if you are thinking of office parties or large family dinners, due to the availability of adequate space. For us, it was a nice experience.

Kadai paneer (taste was nice) 
Butter nan (okayish) 
And methi paratha (I am a fan of this after I tried it for the first time here‚ù§) 
The quantity of kadai paneer was little less as compared to the price. The price is on the higher side as per quantity and taste. 
The staff was really good and polite. 
The restaurant wasnt well maintained as it was dusty and inorganized.
I hope they make necessary changes.

How can a place go so so wrong with their orders and taste? A basic like chicken lababdar was bland and hard. The Ra Ra chicken was supposed to be spicy but lacked the spiciness. The cheese garlic naan is the only reason the restaurant gets the rating of 1. Could even say its their saviour. The naan too wasn't actually a naan. Looked more like a bad mixture of a parantha and a tandoori roti. Would not be visiting the place again.

2) Butter tandoori roti and some fried rice I guess.
Overall a decent experience at this place :)

Also Note: We hoped for a better behaviour from the staff. We understand that the table was occupied for an hour without any order. It was because we were waiting for a group of 8 to arrive. Felt weird about the fact that the girls had to face questions like "it's been an hour, when will you order madam?"
Minus 2.5 straight away!

One of the best Places in Sector - V. With Jaw-Dropping ambience, huge sprawling place, with delectable and succulent kebabs. One of the finest places in town serving Kebabs, Biriyani is out of the world, Well stocked BAR ! And it doesn't even burn a hole in your pocket ! Service seemed okay and pretty decent too !

I have been visiting Jaisalmer since it was an infant, before they even printed their menu card. It used to be one of the best restaurants of the whole Salt Lake area at that time and used to serve only √† la carte. Their deterioration started from the very day they introduced their overpriced below-average lunch buffet. They quickly adopted the Barbeque Nation style of serving the starters to table but unlike Barbeque Nation they invented innovative ways to keep the starter consumption low. The deterioration continued in a faster pace than any other restaurants, thanks to their Chefs, managers and the management. Even six months back, Ocean Grill was holding the first place for serving the worst buffet of Sector V, but now Jaisalmer has surely fetched the crown!
We, a group of 11 went for the lunch buffet. The lack of maintenance was clearly visible. The six chairs of our table had three different colors of the cushions. Different types and sizes of glasses for all 11. Some plates had black spots all over. The welcome drink had sedimentation of welcome powder at the bottom of the glass because no one bothered to mix that. There were 6 veg starters and 6 non veg starters, all served to the table quickly. No question of repeating the non-veg starters unless asked for. Also creating intentional delay to make sure we move to main dishes.
Crispy chili baby-corn was soggy. Veg Mangolian, Tandoori Aloo and Corn salt & pepper were edible. Most of the non-veg starters, however, weren't easy to consume. All starters had exact same taste, all too spicy. Drums of Heavens were actually chicken lollypops. Chicken Kasturi Kebab had a strong smell of burnt charcoal. The odd man out was the Chicken Chili pepper, which has good aroma and taste of black peppers.
Among the main dishes, the chicken pieces of the chicken biryani was dry and the biryani was tasteless, smell less, flavorless. Jeera rice was tasteless too and the cumin were burnt. Mutton Rara Punjabi and Chicken Bagdadi were better than others. Tandoori rotis were dry like papads.
In desserts section, one of the three ice creams flavors was missing and the other two were partly molten. The scoop for picking up the ice cream wasn't there until we asked for.¬† Servers never heard of dessert spoons.

The printed price for this "Puja Special" buffet was Rs.800+Tax (total approx Rs.960). A friendly negotiation brought that down to Rs. 650 all inclusive. We were touched by that kind gesture.

Service was at per with the other aspects of the restaurants. Servers would make you feel like you are in a roadside dhaba or in an ancient busy eatery of Esplanade.

Overall, devastating experience. It will be a gastronomic sin to go back to this place ever again.

Heard about this place from a friend & tried it out today. But my experience was awful & horrible. Food was terribly worst, never had such ever till date. Service was pathetic & very casual .Atomsphere was not even close to some of Kolkata's street food center. Moreover hugely overpriced food only added extra pain & agony.

It is nothing as the name suggests. Neither the decor, nor the food items included in the menu, it's a normal north Indian restaurant serving pretty much average food. Prices are affordable, and alchohol is cheap as well. 
Basically a family restaurant and also suitable for official gatherings.
I wouldn't quite visit again!

Located inside Globesyn building of Salt lake, sector 5, this multi-cuisine restaurant is quite spacious and looks colorful, as far as interior is concerned. Kind of duplex arrangement with glass pane on one side. Upstairs seating arrangement is more appealing. They serve buffet, alongside √† la carte. We had ordered :
#Chicken Lasooni kebab
#Chicken Pahari kebab
#Mutton biriyani
#Cheese garlic nun
#Murg lukhnowi handi
Portion of food served is satisfactory. Food tastes toothsome. Especially, Mughlai cuisine taste finger-licking. Biriyani tastes surprisingly good. Waiters are courteous and last but not the least, it offers you tasty food and decent ambience without making a big hole in your pocket !

A colourful and spacious dining space in salt lake offering delicious food and great service. I went here with my grandmother and mother for late dinner and the staff was very accommodating and courteous which impressed us all. Although the restaurant and great buffet we chose to opt for Chinese ala carte. We ordered for seafood lemon coriander soup which was very tasty, Cantonese noodles and kung Pao chicken. The noodles was nice with great portions of Vegetables in it. The portions are generous and the service is quick, also it is really reasonably priced.

After all day pandal hopping it was really late to have dinner. It was almost 11 at night when we were searching our google map and zomato to find a place to eat. Well half of the dinning places where closed and it was the only outlet that was open and we decided to visit it. Though it was very late the waiters were very humble and helpful. We ordered Seafood lemon coriander soup, devil's chicken and seafood cantonese noodles. I really loved their food which was served with well quantity and lots of varieties of colorful veggies and seafood.

The restuarant is not one of a kind but it offers decent food. It does not go into the good books of fine dining but a path well trodden for gastronomic pleasure. Reshmi kabab and butter naan were a standout but lucknawi chicken and peas pulao did not enthrall my taste buds at all. A special mention :  restuarant hospitality was beyond expectation. Siraj  and Surojit Chakraborty were very cordial and helpful.  I would visit this restuarant again to try out their other dishes.

Jaisalmer is located in the busy area of sector 5 on the Globsyn Building ¬†and hence its not difficult to spot.On the occasion of durga puja we had our team lunch over here.We arrived at 1:35 since we had booked a table at 1:30.But on arriving we were shocked to see that the staff had given one of our reserved tables to someone else.On asked they said that since they hadn't noted the contact number when the booking was done so they couldn't confirm if we were coming so had given our table to someone else.But after waiting for some 5 mins they gave us the table and we settled in.

For welcoming drink they provided us jaljeera and pepsi.Now coming to the starters there was ¬†a huga range of starters from in paneer,chicken,mutton,fish,corn and aloo.In non veg we had chilli pepper chicken which was spicy yet delicious,kasturi chicken,chicken drumsticks( which were heavenly),mutton chops,fish tandoori and pan fried fish.In veg there was tandoori aloo,paneer kebab,corn,crispy chilli babycorn and veg mongolian (which was a mix of many vegetables in chilli gravy). I have to say the paneer was soft and succulent.The corn was crispy also. I have to say the wide range of starters can give a competition to BBQ-nation.Already so full with starters i took a little main course even there was an assortment of food.I took a little biriyani, paneer butter masala and fish in some gravy (forgot the name).My colleagues had mutton,noodles and rest of the food that was there but the stand out was paneer,I think this is the softest paneer i have eaten in a while.¬†

Coming to the dessert section I was really disappointed since there wasn't much dishes.There was kheer,gulabjamun,brownie cake and 3 types of ice cream.The brownie was tasty but the kheer stole the show.It was made to perfection.In the dessert section there were fruits but the time i went there,it was finished and they hadn't refilled it.Overall it was an OK affair,hoping to visit again to try the ala carte.P.S sorry i was too busy eating so forgot to take pictures.

Had a very bad experience with Jaisalmer . Today i ordered lunch from Jaisalmer ¬†. They are cheating on their customers . The price which they mention on their menu card differs much from what they bill. When in received the bill i saw that they increased the price without even informing us. ¬†When i called their representative he rudely said that the prices are increased due to Pooja . When i asked them that they had not mentioned anywhere neither on the menu card nor on their website , he told us that everyone knows that during Pooja prices are increased. ¬†He said that you just tear that menu card and hung up the phone. They basically are fooling their customers on name of Pooja. I am attaching the photos of the MENU card as well as the bill.

Disgusting place. I would rather have food at karunamayee benfish than have food there, by paying such a huge amount. I couldnt have  my food peacefully because of the flies, told the staff about the problem but they were negligent about it. Joghunno ambience, joghunno khabar. Yaar rang de basanti main sayad acha khana mil jayega. No washroom on the ground floor, if u go there with some elderly person, they have to climb upstairs to go to loo, which is a discomfort for the elderly people.all in all experience is yuuckkk! I am never going there in my whole life.

Worst dine-in I ever had. 1.5 rating is because of the decor and ambience. To start with service is pathetic. Whatever we ordered it took more than 30 mins to serve. Now coming to the food - below average quality with insufficient quantity! We ordered Achari Fish Tikka, Birbal Lamb Kebab, Mutton kolapuri, Kadai Prawn, Masala kulcha & Butter nan. Each one was equally disappointing. Never visiting again!

Poor service - poor management. We found missing of food bowl; icecream. They forgot to provide menu items in buffet; shared cold drinks as welcome drinks saying that 'welcome drinks' will take time. It's not at all worth of spending 1000 bucks for such food and service. Not at all recommended, specially for puja dine.

Seriously and thoroughly disappointed. We were a group of 10 friends who ate dinner an hour ago.. Ordered pretty much standard Indian dishes.. Paneer dal chicken breads.. The words seem so plain right.. The food was worse than my description of what was ordered. Service was indifferent too. Considering the look of the restaurant and decor, service and food was a big let down. And quite expensive for the food ordered. Wouldn't go back nor recommend to others.

We went there after an exhausted day at Nicco Park. They have a very colorful ambiance. We were early for dinner, at around 7 pm and so we had the entire restaurant and the serving staff to ourselves. Famished we ordered Chicken Biriyani, Kashmiri Pulao, Chicken Lababdar, Chicken Do-Pyaza and Cheese Garlic Naan. The pulao and Do-pyaza were fantastic, which doesn't mean that the others were not at all up to the mark. They were cooked pretty good too. Filled to the brim, we didn't have room in our tummy to even order desserts.

Lets start with the good things. Internal decor and ambience is very good. Taste of the food is not bad at all. Though according to me they serve in small portion based on the price they charge. So the price is on the higher end. Staffs are though polite but are a bit pushy. They try to push the next item as soon as possible even if you havent completed your starter. And my suggestion, never go for the buffet here.

If you are looking for a good place for a party of around 100-110 people, then look no further. Jaisalmer restaurant, located in the Globsyn crystal building at salt lake sector 5, is an excellent choice. My wife and I wanted a venue for our daughter's birthday party with a wide choice of buffet menu within a budgeted range. With out a doubt we choose the right location.

The staff, service, and management were very professional and were very accommodating. The manager, Mr Mrinal Mukherjee, was very easy to talk to and very friendly. He answered all our questions and made very good suggestions on how to make our event work smooth.

The interior is simple but elegantly decorated with enough sitting arrangement and adequate lighting. The attention to detail of the decoration runs from the very entrance of the building and into the restroom.

The menu for our event was such a hit with the guests. Family style service was provided and the guests were very happy with the starters (American Corn salt & pepper, Chicken chilli pepper sauce, drums of heaven and fried fish are worth to mention). As the main courses were coming out, our guests were even more amazed with tasty chicken Biriyani, chicken do piyaza, mutton rogan josh and fish in bell pepper sauce. Finally the deserts were literally made it a sweet ending with Baked Mihidana, Hot Gulab Jamun and ice cream. To our utter surprise the manager arranged kheer specially for our daughters birthday and have not charged anything extra for the dish.

I commend the staff on the level of service they provided. We will be strongly recommending and returning back to Jaysalmer.

Ambience was very fascinating and service was fine, but we're greatly disappointed by the quality and taste of foods. Although starters were okay, all the chicken main course dishes had the same taste. In fact, tasteless. We had to order garlic pepper chicken which was again not very impressive. Overall, average quality food at a very high price.

Jaisalmer is a family restaurant in the Globsyn crystals building in sector 5. It covers a large area and the interiors are done up in a simplistic but elegant manner. There are small separate rooms with a single table for 6 or 8 people which really provides a lot privacy. The staff is very cordial and friendly.  The food served here is basically north indian and is extremely tasty. The price of the dishes are also quite moderate. This place provides a complete value for money for all its customers. The mutton boti kebab is something which everyone should try.It is extremely tender and soft. This place is a sure recommendation for everyone.:)

Have been to this place a number of times. Just because of its name , note that it has nothing to do with Rajasthani cuisine. The food available here is quite outstanding. And the rates are also moderate as compared to various other places. But a major drawback was the management and service. The staff simply live in Oblivion. There have been times when customers are fighting with the managers over the issue of ordering the food long ago but still not receiving it and the staff members are just watching silently. Ambience is great. A nice family place with amazing food but needs management reforms!

Never ever order or go to this place. Over priced place. Food is ok. But the customer service is horrible. My worst experience till date. Along with 3 of my colleagues. From forgetting the order and not even apologizing for the mess up to charging wrong bill, they gladly ticked all boxes. Will never visit again. That place is trauma. Horrible stuff.

Been here quite a lot including yesterday. This time tried something new which brought the feeling of mere maa ke haatho ka bnaya hua CERELAC and that dish was named "Malai Kofta", I have eaten malai kofta on various places and i guarantee you that this is the worst place to have it. Also tried Kadhai paneer which was better along with breads of masala kulcha and garlic naan which was also properly baked and tasted good. The ambience was great which they were giving us enough time to enjoy as the service was not upto the mark, each thing we order were coming like after 20 minutes. My friends tried non veg and believe me they were enjoying there meal... so i would suggest non vegetarians to got try this place and vegetarians, don't even think to try malai kofta.Ayushman Deb

Located conveniently within the Globsyn Business Park, this restaurant offers a good ambience and one feels the "Rajasthani" touch with the wall paintings and seating arrangements. Surprisingly, with a setup like these, the background music score boasted of the latest Western numbers.

When here, one should try the Chicken Lasooni Kebab for starters. It really tastes good and the chicken just tends to melt in one's mouth. Regular non-veg main course items taste quite good, though one must not expect miracles. Sadly, the veg items do not live upto their potential in terms of taste. So, veg people might think about going elsewhere. Lastly, one might complain about the service time. It might seem like an eternity to some. The restaurant authorities need to take note of this.

All said, down to money matters, the restaurant offers decent pricing in its items. It won't burn a hole in the pocket. 

Perfect place to enjoy "after-office-Friday-nights"... :-)

I am reviewing Jaisalmer after almost 7 months.
I had visited Jaisalmer for a Buffet Lunch, after a similar Buffet outing at Chai Break close-by. So there is something to compare at least.
The restaurant is situated at the Globsyn Crystals Building in Sector-V. The outer facade is simply eye-catching and attracts attentions of the passers-by instantly.
Location and ambience was simply irresistible.
The Buffet spread surprised me. With 12 varieties of Veg & Non-Veg starters, the munchings went on and on. Varieties included Pepper Chicken, Schezuan Fish, Bhatti Chicken, Tandoori Fish, Achari Chicken Tikka, Mutton Seekh Kebab, Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, Hara Bhara Kabab; each starter was simply awesome and tasty. They were equally competitive as compared to Chai Break.
Although I was tummy-full with the starters, just had enough apetite for the Main Course, which included Mutton Rogan Josh, Chicken Dopyaza, Fish in Garlic Sauce which were just average compared to the starters. 3 veg items were also included in the Main Course. Side dishes with Biriyani & Pulao and Breads were nothing to talk about.
Desserts were a disappointment. With 4 regular varieties of desserts like Gulab Jamun and Ice-creams and Pastries, there was nothing different.
The starters made the buffet one of the best in town that I have gorged on.
A must-try for Foodies with a Buffet-type apetite.

This is a late review, last diwali 7 of us , dropped into this place for dinner. Although utterly impressed with the decor, thoroughly dissapointed with the food here.
Ordered kebabs and biriyani, naans, chicken reshmi butter masala. None of the dishes was great to taste, infact the biriyani would make it to the list of one the worst ever I had.
The only good part was the mickyail and theempty restaurant on a festival night allowing us to click lots of pictures.
Staff are indifferent and insist on taking the buffet!

Inspite of so many dining options in saltlake sector v area, this one certainly can be termed as one of distinguished one among them. Been there yesterday evening with friends considering my suggestion since i have heard of it many a times. And i have to say my judgement of leading my friends here was absolutely correct. Great ambience and decorum are few of the usp of this place, not to forget the great food quality and variety of options to choose from. The buffet menu was also well adequate with goodies that would tempt your taste buds. We enjoyed roasted lamb kababs which for me was the best of all and i eould definitely recommend someone going there to try that out. Apart from that the main course was also very good although the curry was not that much as we thought. Overall its a place worth going if you are searching for a moderate cost, tasty dining area or perhaps a place to have a buffet lunch for that matter. Thumbs up from my side.

Well Friends, I would like to suggest you all that never go for a buffet to this place. I went for LUNCH. The options were very less and not so tasty too. Desserts were also not upto the mark. Very regular food and very over priced.¬†

They take 600 bucks per person. Very high for such a bad buffet spread. I recommend that you people should rather save money than wasting your money on this filthy option.

Not at all a good place if you are expecting a good buffet. The waiters will rush and try to serve all the starters at once. I remember only the tandoori fish was worth eating. Interior is great but the quality of food is very bad. They will serve you cold starters and leave you with an empty gulab jamoon can to choose from. Not going back to this place again.

Shiraz, one of the staff is very cordial and made us feel at home. We were a group of 15 people, and the seating arrangements were not at all a problem because it is spacious.

Well it was on christmas night. The ambiance created was beautiful and the restaurant was completely filled. Managed to get a seat for two. North indian as the name sounds. Proper north indian and rajasthani dishes which was really very tasty. Adding more to this, was alcohol. They provided the service which was really to be marked cause at that time it was hard for them to look after each and every customer with proper attention. But they did really good. The menu on the other side was not that expensive. No one could have guessed that looking at the ambiance. So it was again a good dining and a good experience.

I along with a few friends decided to go to Jaisalmer on saturday night for our dinner and we did not regret it.We ordered tandoori chicken for starters which was cooked perfectly and was juicy and along with the green chutney served along with it, it tasted very good and then we ordered butter naan and a dish which was a mixture of medium sized pieces of chicken and chicken keema. The naan was good but the chicken could have been better as I thought it had a little bit of extra salt in it.However the best part was the dessert in the form of hot gulab jamuns which by far were the best gulab jamuns we had ever had and I would say these gulab jamuns made our dinner special and worth the money and I would surely visit the restaurant again for them.The service was good as the waiter was courteous and helpful and the ambience was good and I was thoroughly impressed by the interior decoration of the restaurant.

I went to this restaurant with my office colleagues few days ago. We have opted for the buffet lunch. The buffet was 650 all inclusive taxes and corporate discounts.The d√©cor and the ambience was really great. The buffet spread was good.But the service was very slow. They took so much time to serve each of the starters. Even they forget to ask us about the complementary drinks. We need to explicitly ask for the drinks.The desserts were really tasty.Overall an OK restaurant. You can try it once.

What a nice place to enjoy an evening with friends.Was looking for a place offering something different....and this place has it all. A vibrant entrance, an ambience of grandeur, excellent service. The food was mind blowing....tried out various Tandoor items like the Chicken Lasuni kabab, Chicken Reshmi kabab, Ajwani fish tikka kabab. Also tried the Crispy fried Chilli Chicken. Mouth watering stuff....especially the stand out item was the Chicken Lasuni Kabab. You can order ala carte or you can avail the buffet. 
For us living down south it is difficult to frequent this place, but this experience was such a nice one that one will always be drawn to it. 
Keep up the good work and keep improving.

I went to Jaisalmer couple of weeks ago for a team lunch. I was anticipating an awesome experience having heard a lot about it. But I never had reralised it would be a complete nightmare experience for me. I have been a vegetarian my entire life, but these guys served me chicken soup in lieu of the vegetarian soup. Only after I asked my fellow mates to confirm, I realised its a chicken soup which they had termed as "burnt garlic soup". The waiter had confirmed that it was their mistake and wont be repeated again. That's all!! seriously? Neither the manager, nor any other staff came up to apologise. How can someone into the business of hospitality be so insensitive, and care least for their customer satisfaction. Its a complete disaster. ¬†It was already a bad day for me, so I was not in a mood to create a scene . But I wish I would had created one. Even after reading this message, all they will do is write a "sorry for the inconvenience" note because thats all what they are good at. Look out for it.

Firstly, the restaurant is spacious. That is a plus point, because there is ample space for someone to have private conversations. 
Secondly, it provides both servicing and buffet, so the customer gets the choice of how he/she wants to eat meal.
Thirdly, the ambience, it feels like I am eating in my home. The whole setting, atmosphere, decoration, cleanliness, whole aura of how a restaurant should provide food and not just food, give a comfortable, relaxed setting to eat, is praiseworthy. 
Fourthly, the quality of servicing, the duty of a waiter, his traits, his character is the crucial point for someone to anchor his feedback for the restaurant. I feel that was also lived up to, and it was exceptional, because not only did we eat the best meal at Jaisalmer, but the choices of foods as advised by the staff was commendable. 
So a special thanks goes to Ansar Ali, who was our waiter for the day. He really lived up to his duty and I am sure with guys like him around more and more people would come to the restaurant. 
Finally, the grilling, relishing, sizzling, spicy North Indian cuisine can never disappoint a stomach, it's the main purpose, and I think that food stole it all. Absolutely mouth-watering dishes I tasted. It serves Indian-Chinese foods as well.
Hoping to visit this restaurant again, somewhere in the near future. Those who see my review, it is as honest as it can be from a customer who believes in food, and lives for food.
I would give all stars rating to every area of the restaurant.
Although my one query is if the staff of Jaisalmer can, please build a restroom in the ground floor too, it is difficult for someone who might be differently-able or who is suffering leg pain to climb the stairs. Other than that no issues.
Cheers!
And Thank You!

In the beautiful globsyn building with a beautiful picturesque space around this place is just opposite to kfc. The name gives a hint of rajasthan, but the food has nothing to do with it. We went for a lunch with family and had their buffet on a sunday afternoon. The starters are well cooked. Especially tandoori fish and mutton seekh. Main course is limited but the one dish won the heart is mutton saagwala. A true winner. Nothing special in dessert. But my suggestion would be at least keep some toppings for ice cream it really increases the charm of the dessert. On the whole, a good place to dine with a pretty good service.

Had heard of this place quite sometime back and to be honest the reviews were not encouraging to say the least. In spite of that we decided to give it a shot simply because the location was convenient for us and we could drop in for sometime on our way back home from work. The moment i sat down i was put off by the tiny bugs that were flying over the table. We had initially planned to go for the buffet but once we saw the buffet menu we decided otherwise. As a welcome drink they just served fanta, that too my glass was not very clean. We ordered a couple of starters, murgh pahari kabab, which was good and ajwaini fish tikka, which was hard and too heavy on the ajwain part, could have been more subtle. The biryani was decent while the chicken lababdar was pretty disappointing. Now coming to the service, the waiters were too disinterested and looked confused. It was almost like they did not know what to do. There are far better cheaper restaurants in the city and i am very sure i will not be going there again. Will never recommend this place to anyone.

Food and ambience of the place is excellent. I used to think Jaisalmer was a specialist in kebabs and tandoori dishes, but even their Chinese dishes are really good. The only led down of the place is it's service. Although the waiters are really well behaved, but they were taking too long to prepare and serve the food. But if you are ok with that then Jaisalmer should be on every foodie's list.

Have been there twice for Lunch. For the first time when  I have been there there I was having thought in that as name is Jaisalmer I might be getting some good Rajasthani but I was completely wrong.Being a pure vegetarian I can only suggest about Veg food. North Indian veg food is good with less number  varieties but whatever present is really good. Can try some spicy starters like Red Paper Panner. Good Ambience and testy food. Services needs to be improved a bit. 
Overall had good experience.

I went there for a office party. It has glass kitchen right at the entrance, which can wet your taste buds even before you step in. The place has ample seats spread over two floors which can accommodate any number of guest you accompany. ¬†Has a small bar, modestly decorated, and has lot of LED TVs for people who don't wanna miss some sports action even on a date ;) ( Don't try if you're really on a date!! ). Coming on the food part, Buffet had plenty of options to fulfill any appetite. One thing that did let down a little was the rush with which the waiters were serving starters. But food was good, so you don't wanna complain them for pouring it in. Main course had lot of options both for veg and non-veg. Salads and desert are irresistible. ¬†Really liked the hot mihidana, which the chef himself served me while he was inspecting the quality. 3 flavors of Ice-cream can bring smile to anyone's face. :)
Sorry, not able to review on the drinks. I need to check with the drinker friends. Hopefully, that didn't disappoint them as well.. Full marks to Jaisalmer. missed the camels though.. Just kidding!!!

I sincerely wish I could give them zero stars. It was a complete waste of money! You charge 755 bucks per plate in buffet and you serve these utter garbage to customers! It was a terrible experience for us and we won't go back there, even for a free treat. Please don't WASTE your valuable money on this restaurant. There are lots of other restaurants in Sec 5, try them out.

We went there on a Saturday noon to avail their lunch buffet. Welcome drinks ? Only Fanta! Can you imagine!! Starters were utter garbage. Fish tikka was out of salt, aloo tikka was not boiled, paneer tikka was good but only served once. Extremely limited variety of starters, and that too will be served to you all at once. Hence, you certainly cannot enjoy the taste. Waiters are rude, arrogant, untrained and don't even have the slightest courtesy of hotel management. Manager was standing there like a puppet.¬†
Now comes the main course. Mutton kolhapuri was sweet in taste! we found a rice beetle in polao, could not digest the sweet and source fish because it was stinky, could not find proper salad, could not eat the undercooked chicken. Dessert was only sweets and some shitty firni. Ice cream will be well hidden so that you will not find it easily. Overall it was a terrible experience.

Peep from outside the restaurant seems to be a 5star standard restaurant but when you enter you can see that the management is failing to maintain the place.
A restaurant with so much scope is wasting the space.
Food is nothing out of the world but it is not bad also.
Needs to step up the game.

The name as well as the initial promotions elevated the expectations. Initially thought that it would be a great place to enjoy Rajasthani food like daal-bati-churma or laal-mans. However when the menu was released, it was sort of disappointing. Postponed visiting this place for long, and then shrugging off the hangover of initial expectations, I finally hopped in.

The decor was nothing extraordinary. The wallpapers looked like straight out of NFS themes. The service was PATHETIC. The waiters had no idea about the menu. The service was super slow. The waiters did not care about the table numbers. They just brought an order and hovered around the tables to ask if the order was from that table. We had to wait till we half digested our own stomach, before we got our starters.

The haryali kebab was dry, undercooked and chewy enough to hurt our jaws. Being utterly disappointed with the kebab, we decided to settle for Chinese in the main course. We had ordered a mixed hakka noodles with a fish preparation, and this was the second installment of nightmare. The noodles were overcooked and absolutely bland in taste. The fish was slightly stinky and wasn't fresh. Did not dare to order anything else.

I can't come up with a single good thing about my dinner experience at Jaisalmer, it was overwhelmingly horrible.

Was in a plan to try this place for long...so finally today gave it a shot 
Really happy of my decision. The food was really really tasty and it won't burn a hole in your pocket 
We ordered Mutton Gulauti Kebab as starters with Mango Tango and Beer 
For main course we opted for Tandoori Roti, Chicken Bharta, Veg Fried Rice and Mutton Kadai 
Each and every item was finger licking good...
Mutton Gulauti kebab is a must if you visit this place. It just melts in your mouth
Awesome interior 
Good Service

Jaisalmer is as fantastic restaurant. It is located in Sector 5 and is quite easy to reach. The other day, there was a group of 25 of us who went there and we had a very nice experience. Read on below for a detailed review.

The first thing that you notice even before entering the restaurant is the appetizing smell of Kebabs and a smile passes across your face. Then you enter the restaurant and see the beautiful bar. In fact, the bar spices up the decor of the place which, otherwise, is OKAY and nothing out of the world. The restaurant has two floors and the upper floor is a bit nicer in my opinion, although the buffet is only served downstairs.

Now we come to the main deal: The food. The buffet is priced at INR 722 (with decent discounts if it is a big group) and the food is completely worth it. There is a nice chicken/veg soup and a plethora of about 12 starters. Every starter is nice, be it the chicken and fish kebabs, chilly fish, potato roast, chicken lollipop or the baby corn. The only exception was the chilly chicken which was decent.

The main course consisted of Indian as well as Chinese food and the taste factor was very good. The dessert consisted of Baked Mihidana, Gulab Jamun, Pastry and different flavours of ice-cream. The only point of dissatisfaction was that the cake was finished way early (of course I saw one particular guest at a table going for the cake about four times, but that is no excuse for the cake being over. The staff were informed and they were apologetic and promised to take note and order more in future). I did not get to taste the cake but it was from Cakes so it is bound to be good.

One especially good factor of the restaurant is the courtesy of the staff. Extremely well-behaved and helpful, this team made us feel at home. I would like to mention Mr. Pradeep in particular who was really helpful.

Overall, I would suggest this restaurant to any foodie in Kolkata since it is a really good place to eat, drink and relax.

So every time I used to visit Jaisalmer I would only order  my favourites that includes the chicken lemon kebab,  and from the tawa specialities the murg kali mirch. The last time I visited I saw  they have changed their menu and my favourites do not exist anymore. So this time I had a valid reason to try their buffet. Earlier I haven't read any good reviews of their buffet. So I was sceptical and I requested them if I could take a look at first. The main course and the dessert that was laid out looked pretty awesome. They also handed me a printed menu that had the the names of the starters mentioned. Dinner buffet was rs.600+tax. The starters were really nice especially the tandoori aloo, the chicken ones, the mutton seekh kebab, even the baby corn and the paneer. And there were decent options.  They also served us with a complementary glass of soft drink. I tried the chicken biriyani,  murg korma and bhuna gosht (mutton ) in main course. There were many many other options but I was so full after having the starters that I couldn't try much. Nonetheless the main course tasted very good too. Desserts too were quite good. I tried the hot gulab jamun, baked mihidana and mango ice cream. And the baked mihidana was to die for.

Its was my mom's birthday and we wanted to do a family evening out. After lots of hunting & review reading on Zomato, we decided on Jaisalmer & thank God we chose Jaisalmer. From booking of table to final good night, it was an evening to remember. Thanks to the staff of Jaisalmer and specially Shiraz. He coordinated with me and when while we were there, ensured that we are well taken care of. Oh!!! and best part about Jaisalmer apart from hospitality of Shiraz, THE FOOD!! they 6 veg & 6 non-veg kebabs followed by huge spread in main course. We all ate so much that we had to skip breakfast the next morning :) Amazing evening and birthday evening for my mom, it was an evening we all will remember forever. Thanks Shiraz, Thanks Jaisalmer. Strongly recommend that you visit and enjoy food at this place.

Well... This is one restaurant I would say is an absolute no no on the service and hospitality part of the staff... I went there with a friend of mine for lunch and the way the manager and other staff would talk to you as if they doing you favor.. Well they were not rude yet the attitude was "can't you see we are doing well...so you have to kinda Q up...." I can only say these guys will be out of business sooner than they got into this... Change your staff or you guys will run down... I have absolutely no comments about their food cause I didn't have and nor will I ever go to this restaurant ever and for sure I will never ever recommend this place in kolkata to anybody..

Visited this place a couple of days back with family.
I would suggest the management of this place to please teach their staff members or the guys who are given their duties to fulfill.
The waiters are simply not listening when you're calling them or are either talking over the phone all the time.
You'll need to shout on top of your voice to call them and still you'll be considered lucky if they "hear" your call.
Coming on food, it's pretty average and the kababs are simply horrible and cold when they serve. The naans and other sabjis were okok.
Overall, highly dissatisfied with the place and surely not returning here back any sooner. üëé

Drinks are quite moderately priced compared to other places.
The buffet menu can definately be improved , its way too limited.BBQ nation and Chai Break near by provides a better buffet experience.
Lastly the staff here really needs to learn to manage big crowds.They gave us water after 15 mins and half way through the beer they realized they didn't serve the compliementry snack.

Probably the most spacious restaurant in Salt Lake Sector V of Kolkata. Its located at the Globysn Crystals Building. The decor and ambiance are really very nice. I went there once or twice, had the usual biryani and chicken dish as the side dish. They tatsed good and pocket pinch was reasonable. Would really love to visit some other time and try out the lunch buffet.

Jaisalmer is a fine dining  restaurant located in sector 5. It lives true to its name on terms of the grandeur in the ambience.
Seating arrangement is divided into two floors, i was there at lunch time and the restaurant was full downstairs with a lot of crowd on the buffet lunch, must be very popular. 
So i decided to try ala-carte as the buffet was too crowded, i was offered on the loft.
Food: ordered for Adrak ke panje, and i was impressed by its perfection
 of taste, texture and aroma.

Beverage: wanted to have a beer, but was surprised to hear that out of a listing of six beer only one was available.

Service: Not professional.I am sure most of the service staff were not regular employees.

I will come back for the food for sure.




Will come back for the again !

I personally absolutely love this place. An authentic North Indian ambience, and very cordial staff. Service is quite prompt. Would suggest the buffet if you are going in groups, as the A-la-carte is a bit on the costlier side, but the food quality would make you forget the price instantly. And the best part, the ambience.

Located at the IT hub of the city- sector v, Jaisalmer is one of the few dining restaurants here. ( sec v is dominated by bars, pubs, small joints, hookah places and lacks places for proper dining)
It is situated at the globysn crystal complex and looks pretty good from the exterior as well interiors. 
The interiors are a touch of contemporary and earthiness. Pastels namely whites and beige dominate the place with a burst of colors here and there. 
The restaurant is divided in two sections and I love the seating areas. 
They have a buffet and a LA carte menu. I have been here 5-6 times and find the food to be good. 
The place is owned by Mr Harvey Walia who also runs a chain of other food joints. 
The food here is a mix of tandoori, north Indian, grills and Chinese. 
I love the Paneer tikka here, mushrooms, crispy chillibabycorn. 
Dal makhni, Paneer butter masala are also tasty. 
For Chinese try their sozo pot rice, nasi goreng and Hakka noodles with Manchurian or Paneer chilli. 
The desserts here are not good and honestly very limited. 
Service is good here and waiters are well versed with their menu.

Overall, a decent option for dinner.

Disappointing...went to dis place after hearing good reviews about it..but d only gud s d interiors..
To start wid..the private dining area which was allocated to us had a TV..which after repetitive request to b switched on, turned out to b not working
Next the staff serving us didn't know a thing.i enquired him about the offer which was available on the app"little" n he outright refused DAT it is not available on Sunday..after much argument he said DAT it's not available at rush hours during dinner
Next came d starters n soup..out of which d galouti kabab was bitter n overcooked
Main course: kabuli naan was extra extra sweet..no presentation which wud draw our attention n appetite towards d food. v ordered fresh lime wid soda n water wid our main course but only got it after v finished our dinner n DAT too tasteless n at room temperature..wen v pointed out d fault d server was not ready to accept d mistake..v asked him to call d manager but he just didn't bother to cater our request.
The icing on d cake was DAT v were served finger bowls wid cold water n d lamest excuse dat came was dat d hot water machine is out of service..my question s dat how can a place wid an operating kitchen not provide warm water. Don't dey hav burners to do d needful..lastly v managed to talk to d manager n asked him to cancel d order which v didn't consume to which he replied dat since u hav done d payment n it's been fed in d system I can't refund Ur cash
Highly arrogant staff, misbehaved n rude...
Wud never want anyone to visit dis place n ruin their appetite..if dey continue in d same way I'm sure dere s no going d long way..

I had worst experience at Jaisalmer on sunday evening. Despite booking table 2 days prior, I had to wait for 20 mins for my table. The restaurant was over crowded and under staffed. Waiters were not at all trained. No one was around to attend the guests. AC of the restaurant was leaking. We waited for half an hour to place order. Food was served cold that too after an hour of placing order. Poorest management ever witnessed by me. I would request the management to sincerely look after the restaurant else they may have to shut it down soon. I was highly disappointed with the poor service, cold food, leaking ac and what not. I would not be visiting it ever again.

3 out of 3.5 stars for getting a seat without waiting much on a busy Sunday evening, this place has a lot of seating capacity. The under staffed waiters were on their toes and were extremely courteous obliging with off the menu items as well. The food was nothing out of the world experience but we didn't try many options as well. The pocket pinch wasn@t much too. The decor is nice but the tables were giving a drab look. Jaisalmer can be used as a backup option.

Infrastructure is impressive. The theory of providing "good quality but low quantity at high price" is intolerable.
Increase quantity, otherwise it's okay okay....

Paid a visit to this place for around 3-4 times. It is located inside the Globsyn Crystals Building. Staffs are cordial. Ambiance is lively. Options in the buffet are less specially in the desserts section compared to the Barbeque Nation. Starters are good specially the Chinese fish preparations. The main course was a let down most of the times.

This place is huge. Divided in two floor, it is spacious and well lit.The staff is courteous and friendly.For dinner we ordered, chicken pahari kebab and crispy chilly baby corn with sweet lime for starters.The kebab was very moist, it had six small pieces in one plate but the taste was very nice.The crispy chilly babycorn was just perfect.Right amount of heat and crispyness.The main course was tandoori roti and butter naan, veg pulao, kadhai paneer, fish butter masala, chicken tandoori masala.The pulao was fragnant and had a good mixture of seasonal vegetables.For desert gulab jamun was the perfect end.

Today 9 of us went for dinner. It was a family gathering. They had given us a cosy cabin. The restaurant is pretty big. It was crowded. We went for buffet dinner. The jaljeera was served as welcome drink. Then there were almost 9/10 types of starters. Main course items were selected but very good in terms of taste. The decor was good and well lit. The seating arrangement was good. The service is the highlight of the entire exp. Spl mention for Mr. Poltu Ghosh. He along with his team looked after us with a lot of affection and warmth. Parking isnt a problem. Overall..nothing to complain about.

Khamma Ghani Sa!

Well located. In the lane right opposite to Bakstage ( mentioning the name since it is on the main road ).
Well lit up with lights outside, to grab the attention of the people passing by.
Good soft music in the perfect volume possible.
Interiors are well done. Very spacious and comfortable.

Food: We were two of us. We did not order for any starter. We directly ordered for the main course. 
Punjabi Alu Dum, Dal Makhani, Butter Nan, Paneer Kulcha, Garlic Nan, Rumali Roti and Butter Tandoori Roti..we tried to experiment with the breads!

Punjabi Alu Dum was the best of the lot.
It was lip smacking.
Dal Makhani was good too. Taste could have been better. Not that it was bad, but it lacked the X factor.
Butter Nan, Paneer Kulcha and Rumali Roti were soft and well made.
Garlic Nan could have had a little more of the garlic touch.
Butter Tandoori was fine.

The bill came to ‚Çπ698/-

It was a good dinner experience in "The Golden city"!

Had lunch at Jaisalmer. Its really a nice restaurant with good ambiance. The food is very tasty and the cost is pocket friendly too. Also the service is really good and timely.We tried a dish known as Kong Pau chicken which turned out to be very tasty.

One thing I found a bit upsetting was that the A.C. was not working so well. Apart from that the restaurant is excellent to hang out with friends or family.

The food palate might seem weird, given that chinese is served in a place called Jaisalmer.  But worry not, they don't let you down when it comes to taste and quantity.

Well I went here today with my fiancee on the ocassion of our anniversary with a coupon from nearbuy which had 4 pints of beer & 2 starters 1 veg & 1 non veg starters sounds good right?
About the restaurant easy to locate in front of globsyn crystal.
Beautiful front facade & exterior 0.5 for that.
Interiors wonderful two floored 0.5 on that
Sitting arrangements large wooden sofas though less in nos otherwise there were other sofas & tables. 0.5 for this.
Now starts the worst part.
No 1 to greet it seemed as if we were unwanted guests.
Lights were not lit.. When asked then lighted
We wanted to seat in the big sofas but asked to seat else were but we prefered sitting there only.
Staffs ... Oh god i had to get up and go to the counter twice to redeem the voucher .. Water served after 15min of entering that too after knocking twice .. Cnt even imagine .. Untrained. Served two beers opened one and went away what the hell ... i had to call them again to open another ...
Too much reluctancy... Sluggish service
Two starters were ordered for were crispy baby corn & fish ajwain tikka
Baby corn was good
But fish was stale , hard , lacking lavours portion was small it literally was a waste dont know if it was because we were with a voucher or not
The only thing good was the chilled beer 1 for that.
I'll have to think twice thrice 10 times before i visit here... There r far better fine dinning joints in town with the sense of proper courtesy...
Oh i forgot they kept the serving bowl on an extra chair ... This was the 1st tym i saw something like this....

I purchased a deal from Nearbuy and went there to avail the offer. I had paid 599Rs which assured me 2 starters and 4 drinks/mocktails. After reaching the restaurant I was shocked by the service of this restaurant, they served nearly 25% of a portion size in both the starters and shockingly both Veg and Non Veg starters were served in the same plate, I've never seen this sort of service in my life ever and that too in a restaurant. They served 4 very very small pcs of chicken and paneer, the size of both chicken and paneer were much smaller than a standard regular size in a portion of any dish, It seemed the restaurant was in no mood to offer good service as we had opted for a deal. 

I strongly recommend not to buy any deal for this restaurant as they are looting the customers on the basis of quantity, in short you'll feel like a fool of you have opted for this deal in Jaisalmer restaurant. Even the mocktails we ordered looked much different from mocktails being served on other tables, in terms of presentation and quality. They should not be allowed to sell any deals on groupon/Nearbuy !!!

Best things about this place are¬†
1) Beautiful ambience and decor with a feel of a theme cafe of a star restaurant, great for family and close friends (not the loud ones).¬†
2) A mutton dish named Adrak Ke Panje. Taste is heavenly¬†
3) Booze at a reasonable price and¬†
4) Patrons are very accommodating. They will try to get you the best place as per your choise, change the dish if you have complain, try to do other things to make you feel really comfortable. I particularly like Mr. Siraz and his team of boys.¬†

But other than that and Kolkata type Biriyani, the taste of other foods are average or not good. I have been there 3 /4 times (mainly for that mutton dish), the tastes remain same.
Choice of booze is limited. Twice I was told that Red Rum is not there.¬†
Didn't have the buffet so cannot comment on the same.¬†
Please note that there are lots of choices in that area so the management should do something about the food.

The grandeur of this place is at par with any star hotel of Kolkata. Highly impressed with the ambience and the decor. 
Had tried the buffet here. It was very reasonably priced at 600+taxes. The choice of welcome drink was only limited to Lime soda. The starters were wonderful but the main course had certain basic limitations. For breads they could not offer anything other than Nan which is generally not the case in places of this standard. There was not much of variety of Salads as well. Surprisingly we were disappointed as the sweet dishes there were only two varieties.
Taste wise each of the items were wonderful but sincerely felt that there should be some options in the main course and desserts. 
Needless to say that the staffs were extremely caring and hospitable. In the end they themselves offered corporate discount. 
Overall a good experience but would expect more options in main course and dessert in future.

Best part was serving of Bengali starters like mochar,  mangsher, macher chop came to plates very hot right from the kitchen.  Food was overall not very spice which was a plus point in this weather. Apart from food quality the hospitality from the staffs were exceptional, they seruly score 6 out of 5 in this department

Okay my first time dining at this joint. The floor set up looks more like that of a cafe outlet. The menu is quite lack lustre. We had ordered Tandoori Chicken and Fish Tikka Kebab for starters.

The chicken was emancipated and looked like it had died many a milenia ago. The spices were right, however this was a case of a showcase tandoori item being served. The fish was coated in a fresh yoghurt, which invariably led to a funky smell in it.

The Mutton Biriyani could do with a better cut of meat. The rice was fluffy and well seasoned. The Mutton Rara Punjabi was mediocre at best.

The wait staff were proactive and efficient. All in all, a mediocre eating joint.

A little difficult to locate as it is in a building which is in a sort of a deserted lane.
Had visited this place a while back, and was amazed by the interiors, ambiance and all the other glitters, definitely will catch one's eye. Apart from all these glitters the vegetarian food served here is of a quality that was missing in this area. Tasty and lip-smacking food at affordable prices and with such a great ambiance there is nothing more one can ask for.
A definite visit for everyone and it will surely be a worth.

Did not have a great time. 
The place looks inviting enough at first sight but like a profile pic on tinder it's mostly Photoshop. The ambiance had nothing to do with Jaisalmer and the food was bad and the bill was worse . That is to say it was edible but you'd get the same quality at any north Indian dhaba at a fraction of the price.

But if you are planning for a private family get together, they have their reserved chamber too. Coming to the food, Chicken Lababdar, Chicken Pahari Kabab and specially the Paneer Kulcha are must try.

Have visited this restaurant at least twice, once for a marriage reception and second an individual visit with family. Took the buffet for the second visit, the starters were unlimited with a lot of varieties, served on the table. The service took some time, but once it started the starters kept coming. The buffet is not much varied but is not bad either.¬†

The service cutlery used for Veg and Non Veg should be different as people use same spoon to take veg and non veg food items from the buffet table. This creates issues for those who are pure veg and the staff should keep a watch on this issue. You can say at 600 + tax, better options like barbecue nation in the vicinity are in the same price ranges for the weekdays.

The ambience along with the kebabs are the best features of this outlet.

easily located at the front of the globsyn building....the entrance is grand and the interiors is well done and the seats are comfy ....but thats about it regarding the good part of this place...
The main part which is the food is horrible...visited on a sunday afternoon and it had 3-4 tables
The menu is boring to look at...they had a special menu which was a black and white a4 print out sheet
ordered for a tandoori chicken and on the recommendation of the staff another chicken gravy
the tandoori chicken seemed like it had polio and the pieces were half of what you will be served anywhere else
the gravy was inedible and we left it after a couple of bites
the staff also laughed and moved on when we had asked if we needed anythng else and we told him that the food was horrible instead of asking what the problem was, which was another turn off
never visitinf again...

Located in the heart of sector 5 it's cheap enough. But when we were there no one other us was there so it felt quite lonely and no music was playing either later people come   and everything became normal as it should be in a bar. But we couldn't find anything to eat with our drinks so we decided to leave. All the food items are like for dinner or lunch or whatever but not suitable for drinks atleast for us. But it was a good experience.

This restaurant is in the Sector V, in Globsyn Crystals. The restaurant interior has been done on the Rajasthani theme, although the food served is pan Asian. The staffs are courteous. The ground floor is generally reserved for diners opting for buffet and can get quite smoky with the live kitchen operating there. I must mention that the buffet spread is big, but not good. The ala carte menu has Indian, Chinese and grills available. With certain dish tasting excellent and certain dish tasting ok. They serve both Chinese and Indian food in the buffet.  There are in all 6 Veg and 6 non Veg varieties of Starters. We all enjoyed the starter along with a Complementary Drink (Jaljeera) but it wasn't enough so we added extra cold drink. On moving towards main course we did have a light main course, since we all were up with enough Starter. In Desert it was nothing that special, what we had in option was Kheer, baby Rasogolla, Motichur & Cake. Overall nice experience, but not like other quality buffet restaurants.

I had been there yesterday for dinner along with my cousins. We were a¬†group¬†of 7.
However, unfortunately we didn't have the opportunity to taste the food out here cause we left after a highly disappointing experience.
Firstly, there is no coordination between the staffs. When we entered the restaurant, we were informed that buffet was available. However as soon as we took our seats, we it came to our knowledge that buffet was available only for a particular group who had booked it earlier.
Secondly, we simply hated the attitude and behavior of the staffs out there. Whatever we ordered we were informed that it would take real time to serve that or else simply that it was not available.
We understand that it does take certain amount of time to prepare a particular dish but there is way to approach the customers which is simply lacking at this place. We had no other alternative but to get up and leave.

Hi, we gone there for a team lunch of 18 persons. 8 items of veg & non veg starter served. most of them are rubbish. All Fish items was of cheap vola vetki with not good in taste and strange smell. ¬†First time experience of chicken ¬†with bone!!! Main course ¬†having good quality biriyani and mutton rogan josh. Veg items were good. Chicken main course was average.
Desert was also average they don't serve ice cream. Also dare to serve burnt kheer.

Most of all behavior of staff to bulk customer was totally unprofessional ¬†as like local restaurants. Started serving starter after reaching their after 40 min though we were having early booking. Need to wait long for any specific item you want them to repeat to serve.

We were have good experience in Flame and grill or Barbeque Nation. But this time we were thought to have different experience. That makes us so frustrated we will never look for them again or recommend to others.

If you need change in middle of the city with a good platter of kebabs on your table ...then this is highly recommended for you. Entering Jaisalmer  you can hear  good English music which amused me as to the theme of the place . The decor , the sprawling space split into two, the location at the heart of the sector 5 and your pocket pinch all makes a nice concoction  of a place you would like to have that session with your friends.  The ambience , the big screens and relaxed seating does make it a cozy place . 
Loved the private dining area near the water body. The blues and rest of the furniture here gives you the look of  Capri  in Italy rather than Jaisalmer.  Obviously the music makes you feel more so. The private areas in level two is more vintage and very nicely done. 
The food  that I tried was Indian .  Loved the kebabs. The raan  was cooked to perfection. The flavours were not string but very well blended. Also  good thing was that it lacked the smell of oily food so evident in any kebab joints. 
The biriyani was lightly flavoured. If you are a fan of strong scented heavily oiled  food, then this is not for you.  The biriyani has no oil, very light, infused with flavours but not over the top.  
Desserts are my favourite,  hence would take time to wish  the chef on the beautiful baked mihidana.  Done perfectly and served hot , it just the perfect ending to the feast . 
Loved the ambience,  the kebabs would be highly recommended, also the desserts. All of  this for a pocket pinch so less that is almost unbelievable.  Try this joint out!!

Speaking of customer service, they are a bit slow but however, the food quality can definitely compensate it. It is present in a splendid location. If you are hungry in you office its within affordable range. I will recommend this place as its value for money. How ever it can do up a little more with the ambiance and customer service.

I recommended this place for our office party but it has become worse since my last 2 visits. I enjoyed their food very much in my past 2 visits but now the food quality is much worse, the starters, main course and way till the end of deserts. There is no ice cream in desert neither in buffet nor in a la carte.
Will not suggest this place to anyone. I will surely not visit it again.

Hi, I was actually looking to rate this place 0, unfortunately I cant. While stepping out of this place, I was wondering if a place could have done a worse job and I think that is not a possibility. The owner must shut this place down and look at other business avenues. The food was absolutely a disaster, but far worse was the service. The service took half an hour to serve starters. We were three of us and none of us could have thought of a nightmare for food, as this was. The staff was unapologetic, and lacked courtesy to recognize the lack of service. The paneer tikka seemed two days old, barely warm and coloured rather than placed in a tandoor. The naan was like having chewing gum and seemed like rubber. I would advise you check the other restaurants in the area, its sector five where you have better options, but Jaisalmer is an insult for the royalty of Rajasthan, its giving a bad name to the city and the food business.

Love the overall ambience of the place. Grandeur at it's best. Haven't tried their chinese food yet but the north indian food is pretty decent. So far have tried their biryani, bharta, reshmi butter masala and all of them are pretty good. The Indian breads available are also pretty good. Need to try their chinese soon.

I've been here twice , one for lunch and another for dinner. Both the times had their buffet. The first time I found it quite nice with lots of starters not only kebabs and ample amount of main course served as well. But the second time I didn't like it at all. Their service was poor so was food. There were no prawns in starters and the desert menu was deserted. They do give a discount for corporate employees though.

Buffet - Third class. Don't go. My experience is very bad. No ice cream. In desert only gulab jamun. Don't waste your money here. You can opt for A la carte .

Wonderful place to have dinner with friends and family. The first time we went there, it was a team lunch and they fought over a string of hair found in rice. But I've been there on multiple times since then and have had a pleasant experience every time.. 

This place is great for a family dinner too. The food is well prepared and they got a lot of starters. Staff has always been well behaved and extremely helpful.. I hope they are able to keep it up. :) :)

Visited this place a month ago. The ambiance is good and the staff is very nice.I had the buffet dinner here.¬†

Coming to the food, they have a good a wide range of starters and most of them were pretty good. The main course was also good with a lot of variety available for both veg and non veg. The desert section was pretty ordinary and they can improve a bit upon that.

The best thing about this place is the variety of food that they serve and also the pricing is pretty decent given the location.

What I liked most about Jaisalmer is that it very spacious and they have a full bar available! Given the variety of food they serve and the fact that they sell a range of cocktails definitely makes it stand out in the list of restaurants located in Salt Lake. Also, they aren't overpriced at all. Their Mutton Rara is a must try.

As a Foodie, we like to try out places.As such we ended up at Jaisalmer, which seemed to be pretty favorite as it had some people waiting for their turn on a busy friday evening!Before trying it out I requested one of the stewards if I could have a look at their spread. I must say that it had a pretty good spread but no seafood!I liked it & decided to wait¬† for a table.The ambiance was good and the service too was satisfactory!Very reasonable priced and the food was very palatable!

We went there today and had fish ajwain kebab, mutton rara, and biriyani with raita. All there extremely ordinary in taste and overpriced items. The kebab smelt of fish btw. Mutton was hard and not cooked properly. Biriyani was just about ordinary to ok. And my bill? A whopping 1200 bucks!

Food Quality: 2/5
Service: 1/5
Ambience: 3/5
Location: 5/5
Value for Money: 3/5

Jaisalmer, located in Sector-5 is the one of the most disappointed place I have ever soon. Ambience is just above the mark. 

The quality of food is average and service is too poor. None of the menu in Non-veg category have the taste to retain their customers. I wonder how this place is still doing business in such competitive location. 

Feedback for Vegmay be different however for non veg is sure very poor. 

Starters are average and main course is too poor. Biryani and Haka noodles is tasteless if you have ordered in Roti category then make sure you have ample of time to spend there.  No ice-creams available and sweets are too average except Gulab-Jamun.

My personal favourite were fish in red wine  and mutton. Dessert was also nice. Last but not the least the decoration of this place is wow.. Lovely ambience. Thumps up for the place.

While some restaurants can go overboard with native decorations and furnishings, "Jaisalmer" strikes a perfect note with its evocation of the Raj era. Its menu is equally rich in Indian history, inspired by the northern regions, and deftly delivered by a crack team of young chefs. And just so you don‚Äôt forget you‚Äôre in Sector 5 and not in Rajasthan, the windows overlook a busy road with office-goers scurrying by.

Thankfully, no ethnic, overcute decor here. A simple, long room with a the backing wall draped with a giant poster accentuating the theme, perhaps too simple, but pleasing. Splashes of colour, with white coloured rustic wooden chairs paired with simple wooden tables.

Well, we opted for Ala Carte and believe me the food was  "Laajawab". My personal favourite was the " Adrak-ke-Panje ", the meat just dissolved as soon as is it put inside. Truth be told, it tasted like a mass of nothing in my mouth and with an awesome flavour of its own. My taste buds went a little crazy when I tried the Tandoori Pompfret, though the audacious blend of spicy numbness and the succulence of the Irani-fish-tikka-kebab was quite enchanting. It was moist, decadent, delicious and fresh.
Overall, one of the best places to dine in without burning a hole in the pocket.

Had been there today to celebrate a close friends birthday. We had visited during lunch and the place was fairly crowded. That just goes to show the goodwill it has created for itself to have a busy lunch hour on a Thursday that too in an area with lots of restaurants and eateries.

I loved the location and ambience of the place. Being my first time there I was very very impressed with the place.

The lunch had both buffet and ala carte but we chose the ala carte menu as everyone liked the dishes on the ala carte menu better. But I must say that the appetiser section of the buffet menu (Non Veg) was really tempting.

For starters we ordered the Drums of Heaven and Veg Spring Rolls along with beer.
For Mains we had Garlic Nan, Dal Makhani, Chicken Bharta and Tandoori Paneer Masala.

The quantity was or good and the food was really tasty. They were not heavily spiced and personally I don't have Indian food because of the excessive gravy and spices but I enjoyed the food here.

The staff too was friendly and courteous. Overall I loved the first time. Will be definitely back again.

The service was quick and prompt, the biriyani in the buffet was the best dish and the starters were also good and well prepared. The brownies were a bit hard and I think that the cake was kept in the walk in for quite a long time as the gnash had become quite hard. This happens if the cake has been in the freezer for a long time or if the proportion of the chocolate and cream for making the gnash is not right. Overall it was good and the price is reasonable and economical.  The decor is also quite peaceful.

For those who love North Indian food, this place is nothing less than heaven.
Though it is quite new, yet it has managed to make it to among the top destinations of foodies in the city with its cheap food and royal ambience leaving other hot favourite North Indian eateries like Rang De Basanti and Azad Hind much behind.

Located at the heart of Sector 5, Jaisalmer is one of the finest looking restaurant. The food is quite good. The chicken biryani was very light,  no overpowering smell of rosewater, which is something that I love. The kebabs were very good. If you visit here do order 'Adrak ke Panje', it's a mutton kebab which is very tasty & tender. In veg, order the 'Dahi Kebab', really good. The only thing I didn't like much was the service. The waiters looked lost & clueless at times. Had to call them a few times before I could get their attention. Overall I had a good time & do recommend this place if you are in Sector 5. Cheers.

In main course there are 3 veg and 3 non veg item along with very well cooked briyani.. You can try Noddle's and mixed rice also( average taste).. There are 5 different desert items.. Baked mihidana and gulab jam topped the list.. A little disappointed with the fact that no ice cream in desert.. Last but not the least the decoration is pretty good.. So give it a try :)

An impromptu dinner plan with 2 of my friends made me visit this place.The wow factor is definitely the decor which is beautiful in all senses of the word.Though the name is misleading as neither the decor nor the cuisines served are remotely related to Rajasthan.After much contemplation we zeroed on a chicken tikka for starters,lucknowi chicken,mixed pulao,rumali roti and roast chinese lamb for the main course along with soft drinks.The chicken tikka was standard fare,the main course items were tasty but the lamb was braised and not roasted as expected.But it was tasty,all the flavours married well and we weren't complaining.We stuffed ourselves to the fullest and paid 1200 bucks for the dinner which is decent for a place of such standards.The place is recommended for a casual north Indian dinner.

It was good for us that we have parked car little away from restaurant as it is much necessary to walk after heavy dinner:)
When you opt for buffet and starters are served on table, you are bound to be heavy on your intake. That's what happened to us as paneer tikka, crispy chilli babycorn, spring potato, chicken bhatti kebab, chicken kasturi kebab keeps on coming after good welcome drink of jaljeera.
Jaislmer has good dining area with separate counter for drinks. Seating is specious and staff very friendly and responsive, courteous. 
Main course was having limited options but we were full hence it didn't' mattered. 
Only couple of things if restaurant can do is a) separate veg and non veg area for keeping portions and b) more options in salad. Dessert were kheer, burfy and malpua which is ok. May be these are changing daily and some days they must hav icecream and gulabjamun :)
Overall good experience in crowd of many expensive brands of franchise restaurants. 
If you have MNCs I-card you can avail discount too. Go for it if want to have capacity to try all!

Kebab delight!

The restaurant is high ceilinged and spacious. The d√©cor is traditional eclectic with tastefully built nooks in all corners. 

The place has some great kebab starters like Chicken Lasooni, Adrak Ke Panje, Mutton Galawati, Mutton Seekh and Fish Tikka. The kebabs are sumptuous and succulent. 

The main course spread is also extensive with Indian and Pan Asian options. 

We stuck to Indian and ordered chicken bharta, mutton rara, dal makhani with tandoori rotis. The food was brilliant, the perfect combination of spice, cooking and aroma. 

The service is prompt. 

Tips: Ask/book for the pool side seating if you are a group of 8-9, the view is spectacular. Try their whole bhetki and Chinese bhel.

Well located right in the middle of sector 5. Don't get mistaken by the name of the restro. It's just another typical Restaurant around with no relation to Rajasthani food.

Royal experience at Jaisalmer in kolkata.
Location is bit hard to find if u r not familier with sec 5. Its just beside famous IIHM business management school.
It's a very good family restaurant where you can have a good and healthy drink with not so many varieties of drinks as it is not an authentic bar.
1. For ambience 10 on 10. No question of any complain. Very much neat and clean and you ll feel very much comfortable in their large 2 floored Bar cum restaurant. But its a bar less,family restaurant more because you ll not be disturbed by any loud music of bar culture.
They have a diferent room even, so fascinatingly decorated only for families. 
They were playing romantic hindi songs and Sunday evening mood got freshned in this ambience.
2. Now food....nothing to say about buffet cz I ve never got 11-12 kinds of chicken, mutton and fish items along with biriyani or pulao @ just rs 700 inc of all tax. Its a huge advantage here and I really have felt super satisfied with their food items....
a) chicken pahari kebab (very smooth and juicy 6 pieces) rating 10 on 10.
b) mutton galouti kebab ( very good taste, perfect) rating 10 on 10.
c) mutton special biriyani ( dum biriyani,taste is different than Arsalan...but very light and beautifully made) rating 10 on 10.
The waiters were very cordial, well mannered and always ready to serve you the best. I m glad to give them 10 on 10.

FOR THE VERY 1ST TIME M GIVING 5* TO ANY RESTAURANT. REALLY THEY DESERVE IT.@priyabrato ganguly

Went for quite a late night dinner at Jaisalmer, and turned out to be a pleasant surprise. The staff is very courteous, ambiance is nice, the food is good. We didn't order much though, just dal makhani, chicken tikka masala roti and rice. Whatever we had, we absolutely loved it. If you're staying in and around Salt Lake, then definitely try it out sometime.

Went here for a team dinner. We opted for buffet instead of a-la-carte. It was unlimited buffet. Buffet menu was good. Starters were served on the table. Non-veg starters included, fish, chicken and mutton. There was no prawn item though. I could not try the main course as I was completely full with starters. Though I kept some place for desserts. I tried chocolate brownie and kesariya kheer. Both were good. The kheer especially was awesome. Never had a better kheer than this in my life before. Rest of the items were good except chicken wings and szechwan fish. Service could have been little faster. Plates and glasses were very unattractive. Seats were least attractive and uncomfortable. We had to ask for everything multiple times. When asked for a glass they said that they have a shortage of it.

The buffet may not be of the league of bbq nation and the likes but still it offers a decent spread...the welcome drink was ordinary jaaljeera which was ruined by too much of ice...there were 10 starters, 5 veg like crispy chilly babycorn,tandoori aloo,tandoori paneer,mongolian veg to name a few...nonveg starters included chicken wings,kasturi murg,schezwan fish,bhatti ka murg and another fish item...soup and salad were placed beside the dessert which is quite odd...main course included both indian and chinese for veg and nonveg alike and they were pretty decent...dessert included rice kheer,hot gulab jamun,brownies,black forest pastry and chocolate mud pie...no ice cream...food may be brilliant but good enough..would like to see a prawn or mutton starter and atleast one flavour of ice cream

Not much to say about this place as we were not offered much in terms of quality and taste. We opted for the buffet and started off with variety of starters. The staff looked confused whenever we asked them anything and the whole place gave a very lazy vibe despite having a very good interior.¬†

The starters were average with most of them having so much of spice so as to heavily fill you up. I only loved the Chicken Bhatti Kebab and the Irani Fish Tikka. The sheekh kebabs were awful and I doubt whether they were made of lamb or mutton as it seemed to be made of besan(gram flour).¬†

Thankfully the starters filled me up or killed my palate (though I didn't eat much) as the main course was a disappointment. For the first time in my buffet adventures it so happened that I almost didn't eat anything from the main course except for tasting purposes. The items seemed to be cooked by an amateur with no taste, flavour or freshness in them. Dessert was limited to pastries, rice pudding and gulab jamun. I loved the pastries.

Overall it was a very bad experience and ¬†I wouldn't suggest anyone to give this place a visit.¬†

Only positive is their buffet cost.

Very good food, been there many times. Location is proper and in that zone it is one of the best.¬† Mutton gelouti kebab was great. Other items were also pleasing.
It is a default choice in sec. V area.

Well, there is nothing more inviting that a player full of delicious Indian food on a lazy afternoon.

Jaisalmer is this bright and vibrant restaurant that is very popular with sector 5 goers. Split on two levels, the place is huge and is beautifully done up.

Though the restaurant is a multi cuisine place, I try and stick to Indian only. Out of the stuff I've tried the following are recommended.

Adrak ke panje. Tandoori double chops of mutton, they are really tender but still not over cooked.

The pahadi kebab are tandoori fringed lollipops which are very juicy.

The Nilgiri seekh was delicious, for once I liked a veg starter as much as the non veg.

The gosht biriyani was light and not overtly perfumed, which is always a good thing. The meat did not lose its natural flavor and the use of kewra was minimalistic.

Vegetarian friends also liked the tandoori mushroom and the gilafi aloo. Besides eating here, I've ordered a couple of deliveries, the food stays just as good when packed.

Overall a nice place. Cheers

I had really stumbled onto this place and hadn't expected much. We had dinner here. The decor has old style charm. And the restaurant is really spacious. The biryani was good. The service was a bit late. But not really bad.

A good hunting ground for food hunters. We ordered the special buffet that was around 700 INR inclusive taxes and corporate discount. They have a wide range of starters, mainly chicken though. Taste was definitely an USP of their starters.
Even with popular restaurants, my experience is that they tend to serve Basa as the fish. I was really taken aback when Bhetki was selected to be served. Grilled Tandoori Fish was delightful. So were the Chicken Crunchy Wings. Had food been the only parameter for my rating I would have marked them way up.
Service was an absolute disgrace. We had to wait for them to re-serve starters, and the wait became longer and longer. We could also find a lot of waiters moving about, but not really bothered about the customers. Another example was when we started moving towards the main course section, which again had great food. Mutton Kassa, Shahi Paneer and Chicken Biriyani being done to perfection; they did not have enough meat in the Biriyani on display. It was put back after several probings. 
Jaisalmer could be a feast of a place, but they surely need to work a lot on customer service. It is never to be forgotten as it is still the "service" industry that restaurants fall under.

This one has a nice ambience. Spacious with a big screen. We tried their biriyani. It was authentic nawabi. Rotis and chicken dishes were decent too. The sprite they served was adulterated with water which they were quick to replace after the complaint but it does take away some points from them.

Located at the heart of Sector V, this place has on my wishlist for some time now. However, to be honest, I was disappointed, as Jaisalmer does not match up to the level of expectations that I thought of it to be.¬†There are only 2 items that i liked amongst the starters are Chicken Bhatti Kebab and Irani Fish tikka.The main course comprised of mutton roganjosh, chicken shahi korma, fish in bellpepper sauce and biriyani.The desserts dont offer any ice-cream but the gulab jamuns are real yumm!It needs to expand its menu as Sector V is filled with competitors.

I went with my friends for lunch to this place. Though it was well past 3:30, the lunch buffet was still available. This is situated in the 1st floor of the Globsyn building.

1.Ambiance ‚Äì Very colourful ambiance which bright colours all around and white table and chairs. It is quite spacious and consists of two floors, The only problem is that the washroom is at the top floor.

2.Hospitality ‚Äì The staffs were well behaved, though initially they said that b uffet is no longer available but the manager came forward and made it possible. They were prompt in service and served the starters repeatedly.

3.Food ‚Äì As it was a lunch buffet, the following starters were present that day:

Paneer Tikka

Veg Mongalian

Spring Potato

Crispy Chilli Baby Corn

Veg Birbali Seekh Kebab

Tandoori Aloo

I only tasted the babycorn one and it was very good

In non veg, they had

Ajwain Fish Tikka ‚Äì Very soft and well prepared

Murgh Kasturi Kebab ‚Äì the best starter of the lunch with a very nice Kasturi Flavour to it

Mutton Birbali Seekh Kebaab ‚Äì The usual seekh kebab

Chilli Pepper Chicken ‚Äì the flavour of pepper was very subtle and chicken pieces were very smalle

Schwan Fish ‚Äì Another well prepared fish kebab

Chicken Bhatti Kebab ‚Äì This was similar to normal chicken tandoori

In Main course, I only tried the chicken biriyani and it was nice

In dessert, there were the following items:

1.Gajar ka Halwa ‚Äì Nice and traditional

2.Brownies ‚Äì The bestof the lot.

I'd been longing to go to Jaisalmer for a long time.Finally managed to spend my 31st dec lunch there.
Impressed by the menu my collegues and I opted for a buffet which costed us around 720 each.
The only item I liked in the starters range was the chicken bhatti kebab. I Liked the biriyani and chicken curry in the main course.
It was odd to not see ice cream in the dessert section however the yum gulab jamuns kinda made my day!
Also I loved the decor,so lively and nicely lit.

An okay place to be honest. I had the Mutton Galouti Kebab which was the biggest let down. The other restaurants where I have tasted the same are way way ahead of Jaisalmer. 
Butter Naan and Masala Kulcha are always standard and really have nothing to compare. The chicken rara punjabi was no doubt good and was enough for couple of us. 
Recommended for a visit for sure. The ambience needs an upliftment for sure.

At Sector 5 near college more in the Globsyn Crystal, Jaisalmer has its name for its huge ambience and arrangements...
The restaurant is so spacious that it looks like you are in a Rajastani Palace... the arrangements,the wooden chairs, the bar all have jst perfect matching with this place... We visited for supper ...
We tried many dishes ... among them Chicken tikka kebab and mutton sikh kebab are good choices in starters...
In main food we had Chicken and mutton special biriyani , Chicken reshmi masala, Chicken lababdar,Kashmiri mutton rogan josh, Veg Malai kofta... all are normally delicious...
From naan, Kabuli naan and cheese garlic naan was better...
Also live Sports screening was there...

One of the best restaurant in sector v area.located opposite to IIHM. Food quality is too good specially the kebabs and the north Indian deliciously.we have ordered biriyani and it was so delicious. For the ambiance and the d√©cor I must give 10 out of 10. It feels so nice to sit in the terrace and having some good food. You should visit jaisalmir at least once.

All that glitters ain't gold. Jaisalmer justifies it. A huge dining space, very nicely decorated, it gives you a very sophisticated feeling. The seating arrangement is grand and the seats are very comfortable. So, we went there on my birthday for lunch. We opted for the non veg buffet. The staff was decent but was not well versed with the menu, hence named the dishes wrong. He served the starters so quickly that after 5mins of starting there wasn't any place left in our plates. Coming to the food, the starters were the worst kebabs I have ever had, I'm sorry if that sounds rude. I mean who expects kebabs to taste that bad? Chicken, mutton, fish..all of them were terrible.
The main course had biriyani, jeera rice, mutton. Nothing special in taste, they were a turn down as well. Desserts were very few in number. Probably gulab jamun and chocolate cake are the only things in the menu that I liked.
Overall, its not worth spending that amount on a buffet so bad, especially when you know there are two better and very popular restaurants just so close to this place.

SERVICE:Service was excellent.They are enough prompt,well behaved and helpful.
COST:it is pocket friendly.For three people cost was 1700.(Courtesy:My two always hungry male mates)

Checked out this place for a Pre Christmas lunch with number of team mates. Location wise ,the place is really good for techies like me. Heard much of the place so went ahead with real good expectations.
The veg buffet course was good but couldn't match up to the high expectations set.The starters were fresh and tasty,specially the veg sheekh kebab was soft and infused with flavors. But hardly found any difference between the crispy chilly babycorn and the potato fingers(forgot the name)! And yes the paneer tikka was good enough as well.
The veg main course was fine but dint get any special flavors of rajasthan as the name indicates!
We waited for the refill of Haka noodles for like 15 minutes(even asked one of the people around too) but guess they were pretty busy with other tables!
And people with sweet tooth like me, who go to buffets to check out the desserts, finding only bundi ka halwa,gulab jamun and cake was honestly a bit disappointing!
Value for money,well, couple of more desserts and taking care of refilling  the buffet courses might win some!
Good Luck!

A restaurant which i wanted to visit for a long time. Once saw it from outside and the ambience attracted me. Finally got the chance to visit Jaisalmeer this 25th december.¬†

‚òÖ LOCATION : (4/5) It is located in Globsyn Crystal sector v

‚òÖ AMBIANCE :(4.5/5)  Awesome. What more can i expect from a sector v restaurant. A terrace, huge glass doors and glass walls made the indoor eating experience like outdoor. Out and Out romantic place.
¬†One thing which created trouble for me is the very small tables for 2 in the ground floor.It is smaller than centre table. may b ok for snacks but not for lunch as after putting 2 plates there were barely any place to put the othe food items. may be there was other large tables as i can see in the picture of zomato. as it is my first time there so from next time i will surely choose a better table!

‚òÖ FOOD :(4.5/5)  We ordered 1 chicken tikka kabab, 1 chicken hakka noodles and 1 diced chicken with chilli ginger. Though at first we wanted mutton galauti kabab but they said it would take much time to prepare so we shifted to chicken tikka kabab.

Kabab.. it was tooooo good. after a long time i have tasted this kind of kabab. being a kabab fan i tasted kababs in more than 10-12 restaurants in kolktat. this is best. better than barbeque nations or flame and grill type restaurants. in awe with the flavour. yummy.

chicken hakka noodles tasted nice. not only chicken it also had loads of veggies which is quite uncommon in most of the restaurant. quantity is too much so that 2 of us couldnt finish it properly.

diced chicken with chilli and ginger was nice. tasted light but not bland. well combination in Chinese.¬†

‚òÖ PRICES :(4/5)  The prices are moderate. In such ambience and food quality and quantity, the bill amount was 750 which i felt is ok.

‚òÖ SERVICE : (3.5/5) Prompt service and helpful
. But one thing i feel which should be improved. the glasses are old fashioned, made of thick glass. the utensils is not up to the mark. when dishes given, the white plate was little scratched , and i noticed it is not completely dry. it was christmas and there was crowd, may b because of that the plates and spoons were not THAT fresh and dat caused me to wipe them again n again with tissue papers.

Overall the experience was nice. Will visit to try more of the items :)

The first look reveals a smart way of utilizing space , though I would personally suggest replacing the window-side benches with something more comfortable. The attendants were clueless about where to seat whom, but plenty of available space makes up for it . The buffet space is downstairs beside the bar counter which serves "jaljeera" as a welcome drink. 
Well, it started off well with the starters when they served the chicken tandoori. But each one after that was a disappointment. We had to ask several times before we could get a repeat of a starter. The veg starters were pushed more than the non-veg ones. After hankering for 30-40 mins we were able to taste all the proposed starters. 
The main course shouldn't be spoken of much. It was a wastage of time and space (in the tummy) , lets not waste any space over it here. 
The dessert section was not very elaborate including a very weird payas and cold gulab jamun. But the Brownie and the Pastry were really commendable. Specially the cakes were pretty good. 
Value for money to some extent but I don't personally recommend it unless u got a crunch.

Look wise ambiance wise and sitting arrangement wise the place is nice. ¬†We went on a Wednesday and after we were given the buffet and normal menu we asked for the bar menu and they said that their bar was closed that day. ¬†After a little discussion with the waiters we came to know that their bar licence is still pending. ¬†Though they are flaunting a bar menu here in Zomato I do not think they have a bar service yet, because in another review I saw that bar was closed even on Monday. ¬†They did not have any notice put on anywhere about it. ¬†Since we were looking for both booze and food, we left.

The entrance of Jaisalmer is as grand as its name. An open kitchen from where you can look chefs are preparing mouth watering kebabs. Jaisalmer is located as Globsyn building,not very difficult to locate. Very spacious place. Jaisalmer has the buffet as well as alakarte. I never try it's buffet. Chicken Bhatti kebab is awesome. Worth of money.. Some of there items from main course is too oily. So my thumb goes down for their menu but my thumb goes up for their ambience,space and staff's behaviour and also the Chicken Bhatti kebab. One of my friends wanted to have some alcohol but he was dissapointed because they don't serve alcohol cause they have temporary license... The huge space in front of Jaisalmer is awesome to take pics.

Whenever anyone thinks of buffet, its Barbeque Nation. But I would insist people to visit this place with your friends, office collegue, etc. The starters are simply marvelous. The people serve with care. The ambience is awesome. The main course is a little short in terms of variety. Same is the case with desserts. But whatever item is served is really good and delicious.

Why do you have item listed in menu card if you can't provide them and this happen not with single order but with three different order. 1) Martini 2) Desert and the third one is awesome "Gazar ka Halwa" which they told me to provide but at the end they said NO.

We had a corporate team lunch on 18th Dec, 2015. I had gone there with lots of good hope, since the restaurant name itself signifying a collection of good veg rajasthani food...But what we got is something different than what did we expect. Talking about starter, few of them in non-veg section were good..but remaining were really of avg. quality. They dont have collection for good veg starter as well. So from the very beginning the impression was a DOWN ARROW. 

Regarding main course, it was also of average quality. And dessert are very poor quality and  they only do provide a certain, very few number of options in dessert selection... so, overall I would say its just a average place for going for a lunch...

Not one of the best buffet dinners you can have in and around New Town/Salt Lake. The starters are ok types, though the mutton seekh kebab is awful. The chicken kebabs, specially Hariyali is good, though I felt the veg starters were better(baby corn). The main course didn't impress me either, though the biriyani is good and the options of dessert were very less. The service is nice and so is the ambience . Overall if your budget is tight and you want to go for an Indian buffet dinner, then this is not a bad option!!!

Our lunch @Jaisalmer was a super flop 

Serving people employed(waiter) needs to be educated for serving. Time Gap between the food ordered and the time it gets on your plate is huge. In short we can say(In HINDI) : Naam bade, darshan chote.

From outside, the ambiance seems to be best and truth is totally opposite when you are in. 

Count of Food Variety is not enough.

My recommendation is that if you are going with the people who have ONLY interests in food can go but who are looking for other factors too should avoid it.

With an extremely good location in the globsyn Crystals, jaisalmer serves one of the best biriyani I have ever had. In addition to its beautiful ambience, fast service, eye catching and extremely colourful interiors, jaisalmer also serves delicious kebabs. This place is  spacious  and can accommodate a huge crowd all together. With all its charm its chicken biriyani deserves a special mention. Please whenever you visit this place do not miss its biriyani.

Our dinner@Jaisalmer was a total flop :(¬†
Set back and even doubtful whether we want to venture in the sector 5 eateries.

It's noisy and all chaos in this otherwise beautifully done place. If you need more noise than food ¬†(if it does come to your table that is!!) head for this place. Absolute fish market.
Restaurant does look very nice from outside.

The staff was totally clueless or is incompetent. Simple order of 1 starter and 2 main dish, naans took more than 1.5 hour!! And the food was already cold by the time they could finally serve it. Can you believe that? Taste was ok but after the longgggggggg wait it didn't help that much.

There were many disgruntled customers. One group of 4 was so offended they left the place after waiting and waiting for the food.
We should have walked out like them and avoided the ordeal altogether.

Folks! Please close down if you can't run the business!!!

It's a huge place with a welcoming ambience. The lightings and the sitting arrangements are flamboyant. 
However, I didn't quite find the food as appetising as I had hoped it would be by looking at the place. I have tried both buffet and a la carte. I must say the food in the buffet menu needs a lot of improvement, specially the main course. They lack in variety as well. The food in a la carte is definitely better, but only in comparison with the buffet.

Another thing that has come to my notice which might be difficult for customers is that they have no washroom in the ground floor, and due to the huge area that the restaurant covers, it's quite a long walk to the first floor. 

Overall, the place really needs to work on its food menu specially when it is located in sector v, which is crowded with restaurants.

I have visited this place twice and on both occasions my experience has been the buffet. Hence my food-feedback is solely based on their buffet offering. 

First thing to mention about this restaurant is the interior. Very spacious and double-storied, it has ample space to accommodate a lot of people. In spite of that, you do have queues! 

Coming back to the food, this follows a buffet system you'd find in BarbQ Nation or FlameNGrill, where the starters (kebabs etc) are served on the table followed by the buffet main course. 

On my first visit, I was slightly disappointed as even after declaring I was going for Non-Veg, they bombarded me with every Veg Starter possible, before shifting gears to the Non-Veg. Smart strategy to save costs üòé, if you know what I mean. Food had great taste I must admit. On my second visit, which was an official group dinner, I found them change the main course. There was Chicken Rezala for a change as well as Chinese dishes. Desserts are adequate and not very elaborate. 

I would recommend this place for people not only in the Sector 5 zone, but also for people who could travel a few extra miles.

We chose to have Veg more than the Non-Veg..

We had ordered Tandoori paneer butter masala, Pindi Chana, Garlic Naan, Masala Kulcha, Rumali roti, Veg hakka noodles and Chicken Hakka Noodles.

The only sad part is the waiting time, first for Food then for Bill...Improvement required!Main course was average, only the biryani was really good. Deserts were discent but nothing remarkable. Overall a good experience but food quality cam be better, only starters were upto to the mark. Place was really nice, commendable decor.

Located in sector 5 this restaurant was a new find. Though a bit difficult to locate..the entry was nice though. We went upstairs. Got a sofa seat. Nothing very impressive look wise. No table mats..no cloth napkins. The start was pretty bleak. Well we ordered soup which was ok. Starter was nice. We ordered mix veg. Since it was puja time we got a pathetic concoction of boiled veggies in uncooked bland gravy. Rice was also not upto the mark. The presentation was bad. Who gets rice in a plate. Overall a mediocre experience. And ya lastly the restrooms could be better. Walked out with no memories.

A planned Project completion party to the very recently opened outlet of Jaisalmer was coined by our HR Manager, and we were treated to an enigmatic mesmerizing platter of various cuisines and an ambient vintage feel time-shifting us to the days of Ray's "Sonar Kella".

Located at the heart of Sector V, the place is indeed a techie's charm for the day. One is obviously lost in time on entering the decorated classical facade, revealing Blue/Green window shades of the 70s and furniture, rather antiques of the yesteryears. The walls virtualizing an Artists 3D impression of the streets of Jaisalmer encompassing the hanging lamp shades, leaves one trippy with the feel of Sun-burnt Eternia. 

We ordered a mixed platter of STARTERS and our table was blooming with - Nilgiri Seekh Kebab, Adrak ke Panje, Irani Fish Tikka Kebab and Chicken Pahari Kebab. We really loved and were much indulged with the Oriental & North Indian spread, offering the goodness and the intuition of the Main Course yet to follow. 

We were already full and Cheered and Jeered the starters!

Moving on towards the main course spread, we stuck to North Indian cuisine and started with Special Mutton Biriyani and Kashmiri Pulao. The quality of the Cereals adorned with Indian spices was indeed a blast from the past. We topped it all, with an extensive serving of Mutton Rara Punjabi, Murgh Lucknowi Handi and Babycorn Mushroom Mutter, pampering the taste buds and we were left drooling and entrapped in the exotic quantum of Peace and Harmony.  

Coming to the desserts, a 'goblet' of ICECREAM of the House, GULAB JAMUN and FIRNI, was enough to signal a really sweet end to the Party beaconing success towards the Project.

Got a chance to visit this place for the first time. It was an amazing experience as both the ambience and the food were remarkable. The staffs were also very friendly and quick in service. We were also served a welcome drink which too tasted good. For starters we had ordered crispy chilli baby corn, veg mongolian, stuffy potato...all lip smacking! The main course also¬†tasted good¬†with lots of choices.¬† I would also like to mention about the dessert part which won my heart- brownie and pastry.All in all good food with little pinch in pocket.

Beautiful place, wonderful bright ambience, Mouthwatering good food (especially Indian cuisine) and exceptionally good Mutton Biriyani are the most important points of visiting jaisalmer again. and off course the ambience and food they offer at such a low price is really commendable. 

in my opinion this restaurant is one of the best pocket friendly eateries located in Sec V area. It is one of those restaurants which can be termed correctly as casual dining.
The restaurant is designed with big royal entrance which prima facie rightfully justifies the name, which has rajasthani royalty in it. The designer‚Äôs played with colors. Colourful light, colour of the walls, cushions, tables and chairs will surely lift your mood & brighten up your day.
they serve North Indian, Asian and Chinese cuisine a-la-carte & buffet.
must try_ Adrak ke Panje, Mutton Beerbali Seekh Kebab, Lasooni Tikka, Babri Aloo
,¬†Kasturi Kebab, Veg Seekh Kebab & off course Mutton Biriyani.

I had heard only good things about this place. But was very disappointed. We visited on Sunday evening in a big group of 20 people. The service was slow and the waiters looked confused. The food served was cold. Not at all happy with the service. The food tastes okay, nothing great on that front either. Overall bad experience, I won't recommend anytime this place.

Visited this place for a team lunch, decided to opt for the buffet, which honestly seemed to be a great option. Not only the food is good and delicious but very well garnsihed. The cheese cake here is a must try. The chicken was delicious.

However, the main reason behind rating it a bit low, is because of their slow service, we had to wait for atleast 20minutes before even our welcome drink was given. There were a few items as starters that they were serving, and it came really late. So good place to try but only go once you have a good bit of time in your hand :)

Happy Munchin !! Cheers !!

The restaurant is designed with big royal entrance which prima facie rightfully justifies the name, which has rajasthani royality in it.. even the eating space is huge, with a big screen showing some sports to enjoy along..

Food was good with an attractive price tag.. good place to take family and friends out for dinner.. 

But, they seem to miss out something very basic and trivial issue which may drive the ppl away.. there was an issue with the small flies, they were around and even falling on the table.. That made me think twice to continue with this place or not.. 

Request to take this pest issue seriously. Rest all good.. hope my second experience will be better than the first one..

Place has good ambience with individualised cabins sort of tables, but the food is just average.. V were served namak-chini-pani in the name of fresh lime soda. Something was really wrong with it, v sent it back asking for a better version of it but to our horror v were only served a terrible one again.. Ordered virgin mojito n one of it had a big HOUSEFLY in it.. The waiter had broken a glass just as v sat down at our table. Starters were good, but the naan was rubbery and chewy. The American chopsuey was terrible.. V were given a complimentary dessert- baked bundiya as to make up for all the terrible things that happened. The restaurant really needs to work on its staff!!

Went yesterday, ordered a buffet lunch. Welcome drink was okay. The starters were served on table. I found the veg starters yummier than the non-veg ones! The crispy chilli baby corn, veg mongolian, stuffy potato...were lipsmacking! The main course sucked big time! The 'potato' in the biryani was undercooked! Again I found the veg items to be tastier than the non veg. Dessert course was spartan and being a dessert fanatic the absence of icecreams was a sacrilege. Though the baked mihidana and hot gulab jamuns were nice, the strawberry pastry was too much greasy and bland type. Brownie was rich and tasty. All total,it's just a good restaurant.

Finally after convincing everybody for this place as our team lunch over bbqnation was worth it

Bbqnation is the baadshah of buffet lunch or dinner i totally agree to that but counting to my recent visits to the place..the starters quality has degraded

Trust me when i say this you must try the BUFFET OF JAISALMEER they have good variety for both veg and non veg..quality of food s really good...the variety in the startes section impressed me..the pepper chicken..bhati chicken everythin was yummy..the main couse was too well blended with laal maans hariyali chicken..fish manchurian

The ambience is lovely and the place is huge i was running and walking :D upstairs and ground floor to check out evry nook and corner of the place..besides that it has two private pretty tables which you cn prebook..one which is at ground floor with the lovely view of outside..and another one upstairs its like a small room with a dining table kindah thing..it was pretty too..

Negatives...
Desert section was not at all good
No fruits to which i was suprised
No mango moose or chocolate moose
And no icecreams :'(
(I was like can i get the desert section of bbqnation here now :'( )

Overall a great experience..i would request all foodies like me who are ready to try new joints do visit this place.

Visited this restaurant with friends for a lunch. It was not very crowded as it was early in the week. Staff courtesy was good. Food was equally good. In starter, we had "Chicken Lasooni", it was hot, spicy and the meat was tender and juicy. This is something I would try again next time and would also recommend my chicken loving friends. 
Main course was equally good but I forgot the name of the chicken and the mutton menus, else could have mentioned here.
Overall, experience was good.

but i think buffet is d main part of this restaurant..
my advice is that not to go in btwn 1pm to 2:30pm. caz there should be a huge crowd of daily office publics. also servs alchohole.
and all of these are in budgt oriented.

This is one place where I have seen it fall from grace. Just after its opening, the menu and preparation was above par, compared to the price in which it was serving and the options available in that area. But 2 - 3 months down the line, poor staff service and table management has really degraded the experience. Serving time is a minimum of an hour. 
Retracted my previous rating from 4.5* to 2.5*

I have been to this resto on Saptami 20th Oct 2015 with friends for a buffet dinner. I have heard good reviews of this eatery and so was excited. We were offered a Durga Puja special buffet menu. The veg starters were good. Among non veg there were Chicken & Mutton and fish starters of 4-5 kinds. I dint like one chicken starter which was tasting stale. Apart from that the rest of them was quite good. Coming to main course I loved the chicken biriyani and there was a veg pulao which also tasted good. Then there were mutton fish and chicken side dishes which were good but not something out of the world. Rather I would like to mention the dessert part where the brownie and pastry won my heart. The price vs performance ratio was a bit let down, if I rate it based on my very first visit to the eatery. But I will surely visit the place once again to try its ala carte stuffs.

They literally served endless starters and some of them were really great. In veg, chilli honey potato tasted awesome. All chicken kebabs were good but prawn was stale. Main course was average, only the biryani was really good. Deserts were discent but nothing remarkable. Overall a good experience but food quality cam be better, only starters were upto to the mark. Place was really nice, commendable decor.

Located at sector-V kolkata near globsyn building a very heigh price and low quality food restaurant Jaisalmer. As it is on sector-V we(Me & my friends)¬† prefer the location ,the ambiance was good but other than that everything was pathetic . 

Cons
1) Service was pathetic.
2) We have orders fish and Chicken kabab in starters and fresh lime soda for each. the fish smells like 2-3 days old and the chicken kabab was not cooked .In main dish we ordered mutton kasha and Tandoori ,but the funniest thing id that the tandoori was like Papad¬† its crispy and crunchy .I have nevr had such tandoori in my life ,while asking manager told me " Sir we mage tandoori with ata not with maieda that's why it is so thin". 

3) Price is very high .One fresh lime soda is 95Rs . All the other dishes were overpriced¬† .

Overall it was a very bad exp for a dinner at jaisalmer.

¬†God thing is it has huge space of seating so no need to wait for seat and¬† good ambiance, but those who are food lover as a foodie I can suggest¬† please ignore Jaisalmer unless you don't have any other choice .

Worst food ( at least yesterday).. stale food, microwaved Tandoor.. hard to differentiate local poor quality Rohu fish or as per their claimed Bhetki kebab..
Pulao, veg etc were just pathetic.

Even, our fellow Table neighbors were complaining the same, and they r facing the same in 2 nd time visit...
Rs. 900 for buffet, and these kind of food and services, cant be tolerated...

Located at the Globsyn Building, Sector V this resturant is one of the best eateries located in that area. The resturant can accomadate around 200 people and serves lip smacking Indian dishes. I visied the place twice and last time found chinese was added in the menu. Though the best dishes i had here was indian. The mutton rara was really good and also a unique preperation . Allover the ambience and food they offer at such a low price is really commandable. The service was a bit slow and that was the only cons of this food joint.

This happens to be my first visit to Jaisalmer,after 5 recommendations that I had received from my college juniors.

Jaisalmer is a very recently opened eatery located opposite Indismart Hotel,in the IT Hub of Kolkata.
Obviously the main crowd over here comprises of the IT people but this place has got a lot of + and - es.
It is one of those restaurants which can be termed correctly as casual dining,rather classifying it as a fine dining one. If you are looking at it as a family restaurant, I wouldn't be recommending this one.

Coming to the good side of this place,the interior is quite large and has a seating capacity of around 150 people.
The wall that leads up to the staircase is huge and comfortably fits in the fans to provide fresh air to the people at the bar.
Furniture looked a little old and was a turn off. But the eye catcher was the projector screen that turned the entire place into a conference hall.

For food,we stuck to North-Indian only,although the Chinese food served here is equally good.

For starters we had Chicken Reshmi Kebab.The taste being good,but again the quantity was such that we kept scratching our heads whether we had picked up the right place or not.Along side this the sweet lime soda was also served late,which I guess has become a standard protocol of all North-Indian restaurants of Kolkata.
The Jaisalmer Special Mutton Biryani comprised of 2 Mutton pieces and an egg;was quite good in taste and quantity.
The Mutton Rarra Punjabi beared an excellent taste with the well blended Mutton chunks and Mutton Keema.A few Mutton pieces seemed to be under-cooked and too big in size,but it went off well with the Butter Nan.
The Navratna Korma was good in taste alongside with the Rumali roti.

I received another shocker towards the end,when the waiter said that no sweet dishes were served in this restaurant.
I mean every bar-cum-restaurant in Kolkata serves desserts/sweet dishes.

All in all the food was good and in case you are looking for a 15 membered team for lunch/dinner,this place can be a good hit.
The food was a little overrated and steeply priced(maybe because of the festive season).And lastly the non availability of desserts really put me down.
Has a lot to catch up with.I'm sure the management will be looking into these reviews and making the necessary changes.

You'd almost be forgiven for not noticing it's there... But the live kitchen view at the entrance, that is such an inviting scene from the street.
The name ‚ÄòJaisalmer‚Äô does not suit the ambiance. The place is spacious on the inside, though a little too noisy at times. But the food is good, with nice range of options,pretty economical and the staffs are very polite and accommodating. You'll love it. 
Starters like their Crispy fried chicken ‚Äòn Crispy chili baby corn are just divine. I don't know how else to describe it except it's like fairy sparklers in your mouth. Be careful not to fill up on too much early on because you won't be able to fit in all the delicious goodies that follow!Though Some menu items were mediocre good, however the quantity just didn't make it worth while.
Overall hearty food yet sophisticated, and worth a visit. Corporate discounts are available... so carry your ID card.

Don't judge a book by its cover. That's exactly what happened to us when we visited this resteraunt on the 22nd of October, 2015.

Being famished after pandal hopping, we called in advance to check whether tables were available for two which the staff said was. However, when we arrived, the management said no tables were available.

Finally, my experience from the time we got in.

The place is sheer huge and you'll amazed by its seating capacity feeding and catering upto 250 people. The ambience is quite nice. Music is played and you get to see the staff cooking while waiting outside for your table.

They were following a special Puja menu. We ordered paneer tikka in starters, kadai paneer and dal makhni with butter naan to go with in breads. Paneer tikka was not impressive to say the least. Main course was quite good.

The MAJOR setback for me was the service where we specially had to ask for basic items such a spoon, fork, water and change of plates. Not a good fine dining experience.

The place is decently priced although 210 for 4 pieces of paneer tikka is a tad bit much.

Not recommended at all.

WHAT AN EMBARRASSING MOMENTS I SPEND THERE WITH MY GUESTS... PLATES WERE STINKING AND DIRTY.. THE STAFF WERE HORRIBLE. THEY DID NOT LISTEN TO WHAT I SAID.. FOOD WAS WORSE THAN A ROADSIDE EATERY. APART FROM THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY COURTESY TO APOLOGIZE INSTEAD THEY ARGUED UPON. SERVICE VERY POOR. THEIR EXPLANATION WAS IT WILL HAPPEN IF THERE IS A RUSH. NOTHING WAS ON TABLE EVEN WE HAD TO ASK LOT OF TIMES FOR ONIONS AND PICKLES WHICH WERE NOT SERVED TILL THE END. ATLAST WE CAME BACK WITHOUT HAVING ANYTHING AND PAYING FOR EVERYTHING.

Very nice ambience with courteous staff. They struggled a bit to manage the puja crowd but faired well. We opted for the a LA carte (limited for puja) where the served the regular mughlai and Chinese dishes which can be served fast and also safe. We ordered lehsuni kebab, which was made perfectly. Succulent chicken with right amount of garlic. For main course we ordered tandoori roti which were well made, reshmi butter masala - tasted good but a little under-cooked gravy, chicken bharta- safely made well and butter nan which was very good. The price was hiked during puja days. It's never right to judge a restaurant during puja time but they are managing it quite well. Would definitely give a second try.

Chose to drop in at Jaisalmer as our last resort for lunch which turned out to be an amazing experience. Firstly we had our jaws dropped on seeing the size in terms of area of the place. Then it was all about the delicacies on offer. We started with Tandoori Chicken which was mouth watering and very delicious. Then came Mutton Special Biriyani which tasted uncommon and the quantity was appropriate for two people. The quality of food was excellent and the staff were very polite and friendly.

Disclaimer: we ordered for home-delivery. So no reviews of the ambience and staff front. 
Simply talking about the food, it was with miserable proportions. I had heard good things about this place before placing the order. If services fall so drastically for food being delivered, they should rather not have that option at all. Not to mention the terrible confusion at the stage of placing the order as well.

This place is different on weekdays and during weekends. Went there on a weekend when it is not at all crowded. And this ensures that the service on offer was good which is one of the major drawbacks of this place in a weekday. This is mainly due to its location and the office crowd that visit this place. Food was good and ambience was not bad either. Pricing is on the lower side. Definitely worth a visit.

We have visited this place on mahalaya for the lunch for the first time. It is in Saltlake sector 5,in globsyn building. Well it's in sector 5 and very near to my office so not difficult to reach.
For the lunch we ordered Mutton Rara Punjabi, Cheez naan, Masala kulcha, Boundi raita and lemon soda. All foods
were good and tasty. I loved Mutton Rara Punjabi but little bit disappointed with Boundi raita as it was not upto the mark.
And I think it's not very costly and pocket friendly. Ambiance was good. Waiters were not prompt may be for the day as it was mahalaya.
Overall good experience will try their buffet menu as we had no time that day.

I had been to Jaisalmer restaurant along with seven of my friends, the ambience was nice, we ordered for Nilgiri seekh kabab and Bharwan aloo gilaf as starters. It was served without chutney, after 20 minutes we were served chutney when we refused to try the next starter, the service is very poor, we had to literally shout and call them at our table, it was so frustrating.
The kabab was tasteless but the gilaf was sweet and tasty. The mocktails, chocolate muddy and Mini colada were not upto the mark. When the table was cleared, napkins spoons and forks were not replaced, we had ask for them repeatedly, Malai kofta was not good, yellow dal had no tadka, pindi chana was very hard, not fully boiled hence not edible, tandoori roti was hard and stiff, veg pulav was good, onion salad was brought when we had half eaten our lunch, masala papad was to be brought at the end but they got it with the breads and removed it reluctantly. At the end they got the same soggy ones and when we protested they had to bring fresh ones.
We had a very bad experience

We chose to have Veg more than the Non-Veg..
We had ordered Tandoori paneer butter masala, Pindi Chana, Garlic Naan, Masala Kulcha, Rumali roti, Veg hakka noodles and Chicken Hakka Noodles.
All were close to perfect. So kudos for the taste!!
The only sad part is the waiting time, first for Food then for Bill...Improvement required!

-Stale Food:Veg seekh Kabab had no freshness in them, it was cold,dry and stale.
-Ordered veg wanton soup,smelly and tasted horrible.
-Paneer tikka was average.
Overall-Horrible experience, d√©cors is fine. Any dish we ordered had no freshness in them at all. Couldn't survive till main course,had to go to another restaurant.
On that Billing was 15-20mins late.

--- this review is for their buffet spread , not a la carte ---

we went there in a group of 15/16 people. they were welcoming and well behaved at the beginning and started to serve the starters on table. and there was total chaos. i very seriously believe if you do not have really expert servers - spread all your food - do not try to serve on the table and thereby irritate the eaters. they absolutely had no clue what they were doing. if we were requesting repeat of some item- it was taking forever to come. there were veggie friends in our group and their situation were even more pathetic. even after repeated guidance they did not seem to understand who all are veggie - neither they had any green plate/green flag system. the height was when some of us complained that the fist item is smelly - the server nonchalantly declared that is the natural smell of the fish!! the main course and desert were pretty average too. there was not a single item which was worth mentioning here. i am most definitely not going to try their buffet again.

The food was pretty decent with respect to the price. The place is huge and well decorated. The starters were little in amount but huge in variety. They had like 10 items in their starter menu. The Chinese dishes were not that great, as one expects from a restaurant mainly following north Indian cuisine. The desert was the part where I felt disappointed, the cakes were not good and they were frequently running out of deserts.

We went to jaisalmer for a buffet lunch.I decided to go for jaisalmer after hearing a lot about its food quality and ambience. However, the restaurant did not live upto the mark. The service was of really poor quality and the waiters least bothered to serve you. The starters did not taste too good though few of them were nice. We had to constantly keep asking about water being served. The service was pathetic and the waiter dropped the mutton dish on my hand. Being a vegetarian just imagine the height of my disgust. We had already booked the table and the restaurant made sure that main course would be available till 3.30 pm. However by 2.35 pm when we were perching on starters,we were informed that the main course counters would close by 3.00 p.m. They had the minimum courtsey. The main course however was better than the starters although the paneer was not upto the mark.The desserts were good.Overall experience does not guarantee that i would visit there again.Jaisalmer faliled me.

One of the worst restaurant experiences I ever had. Good decor though. The most impolite reception I have ever had anywhere. The waiter didn't bother to let us finish the order, and very uncourteously walked away before we could order our drinks, and to add to it he went on shouting around while the guests were having their food. The bottle of water ordered was dirty outside, couldn't take a single sip once I noticed it. Ordered Butter naan, Chicken Lucknowi Handi and Masala Papad. The taste wasn't very satisfactory too. Won't ever visit again. Only 2 things that might need a positive response are firstly the decor and secondly the place is very pocket friendly.

Visited on a Saturday night with my wife after a shopping spree; the place was pretty crowded. Got seats immediately and went for the buffet. There were loads of starters to choose from but there were no prawns and the fish kebab felt a bit odd (might be only to me). The Paneer kebab is worth mentioning - otherwise all the starters were pretty ordinary. Coming to the main course, the Biriyani and mutton gravy were light on spices. The chicken was the same deal you see with any so called 'Chinese' dish in mid level restaurants- boneless balls in a gravy with loads of soya sauce. There were veg Hakka chow, palak paneer, mixed veg curry, garlic fish as well, which we did not try.
We dearly missed the ice cream in desserts, which had Gulabjamuns, cakes and Chomchom (?¬ø?). 

Ambience: 4

Usually mid week dining aren't a good idea that too if you're trying out a new place to dine in. We went to this place on a Thursday night with family.. Ambience is quite nice n cozy. Food:we ordered for - 
1) kadahi paneer - 4/5 ( 1point for less spicy), 
2) Kashmiri aludum- 3/5 ( the filling was good but too less in quantity), 
3)lachcha paratha was very different from the other regular ones. It was a tandoor lachcha paratha.. good for health conscious people.
4) N then ordered dry chilli chicken which was awesome 5/5. So in all a very good exp. Would love to go there once again n try out some non veg dishes as well.  üòä

One would find the service a tad bit slow if one is hungry, but the taste of the food more than makes up for it! We went in a group of six and liked everything we ordered, which included at least five types of Indian rotis, kashmiri pulao, pineapple raita, dal makhani, yellow tarka dal, kashmiri aloo dum, jhal frezi, etc. We were suggested a kebab-style starter that we couldn't see on the menu and it was delicious!

Good food and excellent service. must give it a try already visited twice in 3 days of interval after having sumptuous lunch with my friends I stopped by with my spouse on last weekends.¬†
Starters: Pretty good. though Tandoori served initially was not ¬†fresh but upon telling it to them they courteously brought really tasty fresh ones.

Maincourse: Good food and really good in taste but some how I didnt like the taste of chicken rezzalla.
and dont miss their Baked mihidana

Update: 13th May 2016: This is the classical example of how a restaurant destroys its own fame.¬†
We were there on 13th May for office get together. The food was horrible, mutton kabab was rotten.¬†

Had a buffet lunch this week. Veg Starters are good. Mutton is awesome. Mutton panja, mutton seekh kabab, etc. Chicken dishes were bad. Even Chilli chicken was not worth eating. Gulab Jamun was the only dessert worth eating. Overall average. Muttone lovers can surely visit and Pure vegetarians can also give a try. Cost Effective and Service was good but slow(almost stops) when rush goes high.

However the waiters and the management seemed nice. The veg starters were good, and some of the non veg starters were not up to the mark. The main course items were better. The desserts were good too, but we all missed the ice cream in the list. Good thing was that they provided us a 10% corporate discount. Overall experience was satisfactory.

I went for a Sunday lunch buffet. If u expect something like mainland China or barb q nation buffet then I must say it might not live upto ur expectation. But their food was definitely good. Except the fish items.I dint like it dat much. Otherwise all the items were tasty. They served veg n non veg starters like schezuan fish, chicken tandoori, crispy potato, fried babycorn etc. They had chicken soup and biriyani chicken rezala mutton curry paneer pasinda jeera rice, fish for main course. What dissapointed me is the desert section.they dint have dat much options here. Just a pastry n two types of sweets. Overall experience was good. I like the ambience out there. Well arranged neat and clean and spacious.

Went for their lunch buffet, though the spread was quite some, not a single item do I remember that can be really praised! Most of them were average and few were below average, in taste. They had even passed placing a 'Black forest' cake in the dessert section naming it as 'Gateaux', c'mon now! Unfortunately, some of us do know the difference.
The decor is very nice, thumbs up to that, but the cuisine has got nothing to do with it, which is sad :(

Food quality is ok, with certain dish tasting excellent and certain dish tasting ok. They serve both chinese and indian food in the buffet
Cost is quite reasonable - 550 INR/person + Tax for lunch buffet & 600 INR/person + Tax for dinner buffet
Most of the staff are very cordial

Well I didn't have the food too much so I can't comment on it ..went in for a couple of drinks ..ordered golden prawn starter..6 pieces of minced potato and shrimp ..got finished as soon as we started since they weren't large ..certainly not for 300 rupees.

Anyways felt brave and ordered a salt pepper garlic baby corn ..yeah it was strictly that..The ingredients were tossed and served to us ..not restaurant standard at all..

Seeing the others I could sense that this is a place for having only traditional foods and not trying other realms  - hopefully they make it better

Wow!
Yes that was my reaction while i was passing by the lane. We actually had no plan for dinner & thought of munching on a zinger @kfc but while passing by we came across this eatery & we both amazed by the decor so we went inside.
I think it was half done at that time & sat at the gr. Floor of the restaurant & we decided to have starters n drinks thats all. 
After the first bite of kabab it was decided ki yess we gotta have full-on dinner otherwise it would be injustice to our greedy soul.
I still remember the goodness. 
Next time we planned to have buffet there & surprisingly that was good too. I mean surprised bcoz almost every place would serve you better ala carte than buffet. But buffet was as good as ala carte.Just one request add something in fish too (for the buffet)
So go there n treat ur tummy. :)

On the occasion of my cousin's birthday, and the fact that all four of us are total foodies and this place has so many varieties in their menu, that we decided to visit here for dinner and opted for A la Carte.
Now we were provided with one drinks menu and one food menu. The disappointing experience started after we began ordering. Most of the drinks from the menu card was not available including the very basic Sweet lime soda. Almost anything we asked for was instantly rejected by the waiter and finally after 10mins we decided to just have beer! The drinks menu card was totally useless and they just could have mentioned us the few drinks that they had.

Next for starters, I wanted to have Dim Sum but the waiter said that none of the items from the Dim Sum category was available, so again we opted for our second choices.

After finishing the starters, we ordered the main course and I said that I would like to have the Crispy Lamb but once again for the 100th time maybe, the waiter said that none of the items from the lamb section was available! At that point, I was frustrated and I just asked the waiter to bring whatever was available! The entire birthday dinner that we had planned was ruined and we even lost our mood to click pictures!
The ambience and location of the restaurant is very good but the unavailability of almost everything we asked for is a complete mood killer. Anyone hoping to visit here for trying out some uncommon dishes that they have mentioned should call them first and confirm if they have the supplies, else it will turn into a total disappointment.

This is a posh restaurant in sector 5. 8 of us visited it on a weekday at 5 pm, naturally it was totally empty at that time. The grand entrance, the glass facade, huge spacious two tier seating arrangements all make it a grand place to through a party. The most amazing thing is that its very pocket friendly, we ate our hearts out but still the cost was around 450 per head. The buffet was closed at that time so we opted for ala carte, we ordered lemon chilli murg tikka, paneer tikka, kabuli nan, masala kulcha, murg lababdar, mutton rara, mutton rogan josh, kadai paneer- every item was extremely good. The only disappointment came when we ordered fresh lime soda and kulfi at the end, both the items were not available so we had to settle for masala cold drink and baked mihidana, both were good enough. The serving time was little long but the value for money makes up for it. overall had a satisfactory experience here.

This joint is located in saltlake sector v, Globsyn building near wipro crossing. 
 
I went with my office colleagues for a lazy Monday lunch. What I like about the place most the location and the ambience. Very well maintained and decorated. And their staffs are very well behaved and helpful.
Food is good.  Kababs are unique not like tikka and hariyali what you will get in every other food joints. We had lemon chicken kabab , chicken lasuni , fried garlic mushroom .  In main course we had mutton biriyani, raita , jeera rice , cheesy tanduri roti,  one item of fish etc. Food and quantity is good. 
Overall a satisfactory lunch we had.

On a quiet Sunday afternoon, I was looking for a north Indian restaurant for lunch. I am not a big fan of north Indian, but then my friend simply loves the¬†north Indian cuisine. So, with the help of zomato and reviews, we finally decided to visit this place. It was the best decision because the north Indian food they serve here is simply amazing. We visited this place twice and both the times the experience was amazing. We ordered Special Chicken Biryani, Chicken Lababdar, Egg Bhurjee, Masala Omelette, Dal Makhani ,Masala Kulcha, and Plain Naan. ¬†I was expecting Chicken Lababdar to be spicy and of smoky flavor but the addition of capsicum made it more of indo-chinese dish. Masala Omelette tasted could have more flavors added.Nevertheless, it tasted pretty decent. Their service was quite decent, staff were well aware of what is in their menu and what would be appropriate order according to our liking. My overall experience here has always been great. Would love to visit again.

Went there having a lot of hopes with around 25 people. The service, first of all, was a drag and the only thing good was one item in the starters. The breads were literally burnt and the answer for it was, "It is quite normal sir." The overall experience was like traveling through a place full of garbage, with the name "Heaven" on the entrance. Even sitting at home and having cup noodles would have been a better option.

Was famished when I made a visit to this restaurant with no such expectations...as once before when I made a visit I ddnt like it much.. But to my surprise this time I loved it..they served typical flavoured North Indian.. Its very spacious with decent ambience.. Coming to the food.. I ordered for Veg. Jhaal Frezi which was a combination of capsicum,onion,babycorn,carrot,paneer,potato and spices tossed in red sauce... Which had perfect flavours in it.. 
Then Dal tarka which was even mere perfect and I loved it.. It gave me d feeling of Rajasthan roadside dhaba's dal..so was v much contented..
Now coming to breads.. 
Tandoori Roti which generally I don't find perfect in most of the restaurants..
But,they provided v light texture,moist rotis which was so good to eat...
All in all.. Its definitely a must visit..!!!

A top-notch restaurant in the heart of Sector  V. The place is a bit difficult to locate (Try the map feature of Zomato). Its on the first floor of the Globsyn Crystals building, which also houses many other eateries. The place is enormous so once you reach the area, the restaurant is not difficult to see. 
     The mellow ambience tends to please once you are inside. The restaurant is completely surrounded on 2 sides by glass walls so it looks pretty stunning. 
     We were here for lunch. The menu has both North Indian and Chinese on offer along with a bar menu to boot. There was a sumptuous buffet spread but we opted for a-la-carte instead. We were in the mood for Chinese and so we ended up ordering Lemon Chicken Murg Tikka for starters, and Singapore Mixed meifoon & Kung Pao Chicken. The whole meal was delicious although the meifoon and Kung Pao were on the spicier side. The pi√©ce-de-rƒósistƒÅnce went to the Lemon Chicken Murg Tikka for its effortless mingling of tastes. 
   Definitely recommended!
    Bon apetit!

The restaurant has a fresh atmosphere, making the experience somewhat soothing. Service seems to be better than expected with every official making each visit enjoyable. But the worst part of it, is it's inconsistency in quality of food. The same dish might occur both good and bad to the same person when ordered more than once. Although, leftovers can be parcelled back home which is a good point for people like me, who feels hungry more to the eyes, rather than on the stomach. Overall, would've received worse ratings but service did mend up a little.

This is probably one of the more upscale dining options in Sector V. They have lunch and dinner buffet which is amply patronized by the corporate crowd, of course. We were there for lunch on a Friday. Granted it was peak hour given Friday team outings, but the service was reproachable. We waited 15 minutes for them to serve us a naan, with our curries going cold. That's a no-no in buffet service.¬†

The food to put it best, was decent. The starters included two kinds of fried potatoes, crispy chilli baby corn, seekh kabab and the mandatory tandoori paneer. The honey dipped crispy potato and baby corn (could this ever go wrong?) were the top of the draw. The rest were far from memorable, the seekh kabab was burnt and chewy. Main course comprised 2 subzis, 1 rice, 1 dal and 1 chinese dish. The dessert spread had a grand total of 2 desserts. Special mention to the awesome cham-cham. Is this variety acceptable in a Rs. 550+taxes meal? Not to me.

PS: Why is it called Jaisalmer? Nothing in the interiors or food evokes the place.

A fine dining experience at a very affordable price is what jaisalmer is all about. Here are some key points:
1. Good decor, both on d ground floor and the 1st floor. There are also private cabins for the fun loving groups who enjoy their own privacy.
2. Great service, is also another positive aspects of the place. Waiters arevery friendly.
3. Good food but not great. Try d fish gravy and cheese nan.
4. Bar is only available on Wednesday, Friday, Saturday. 
We weren't able to get a taste of their desserts as the chef wasnt available so that was a big disappointment.

Once before had been at this place at a friend's bday when we got literally frustrated with the service and walked away. However, visited back yesterday but they still have a problem with the service. Why can't they serve the order fast? We had finished our starters and had to wait for the main course to arrive. The food was okay as I could not find any mouth watering taste..it was entirely a homemade kinda. The best part that I found was the songs that were playing in the back & the sour salty lime soda. The layout too didn't give me any Wao factor.. Aahaann..not satisfied with the entire thing!

We were passing by it and could not miss the opportunity to try it.It is quite spacious and decently decorated.As soon I entered I noticed the royal looking big sized sofa cum couple seats with huge white curtains beside it.We sat there. Ordered MUTTON BIRIYANI, CHICKEN DO PYAZA and RUMALI ROTI. The staffs have good knowledge about the items on the menu. Everything we order were perfect, though i found the chicken bit salty but my partner really liked it.The ac was not strong in that part of the restaurant.Prices are affordable.A good place to have north Indian delicacies.

Jaisalmer is a value for money place. The setting is spacious and decor relaxing. We dropped in there on a Monday afternoon for lunch. The ambience was good. We opted for a la carte. The crispy chilli baby corn could do well with a little more heat and seasoning. The Lat Me Kai was tender juicy and flavourful. The garlic naan and mirch pyaaz ka kulcha had the right flavours. The star of the show was Kashmiri Mutton Rogan Josh. We had to skip desserts and settle for fresh lime soda as we were too full. The portions were large and more than enough for two people. The price is justified and quite pocket-friendly. Our whole meal cost us around 800/-. The most commendable thing is the service. The staff is courteous, friendly and very accommodating. This is a place I would like to visit again to try out rest of the offerings on menu.

Have been to this place twice. For me the quality of food is the main thing that I look for in any restaurant and other things like ambience,services etc are of lesser importance. Please don't go by the name,you will get everything starting from north Indian to Chinese cuisine. I would rate it as an average restaurant.They have so many starters in their buffet but I would suggest to have few starters with quality and proper taste. Also they really need to do something about the desserts.They have nothing in the desserts section that will attract people and probably the worst that I have seen in any dinner buffet.

Ate here in the 1st week of July with my husband and brother. I had read up all the reviews and was prepared for the slow service. But to our amazement the food was served almost instantly after being ordered.¬†
I was having a ¬†strange feeling about this as all gravies, rotis, nans take time.
The food was okay but the worse was yet to come. Both my husband and brother suffered from stomach ache and am assuming this was the case because of serving 'stale' food! No wonder it came to the table so soon. I am very angry with this place so angry that this review has been pending as I every time I think about it my mood gets spoilt. They should shut shop, hire better kitchen staff, maintain food quality and then come into the public. REALLY PATHETIC!

An extra point for the location & the ambience. Glass walls definately gives the place an extra edge!! Went for dinner buffet with full team. There were 3 chicken starter,mutton sheek kebab, 1 fish starter & a few veg starters as well. The quality of food was awesome. Specially the pepper chicken deserves a special mention. The panner kebab,the crispy chilly baby corn, the veg spring roll & the mutton seekh kebab also was very good. Dissappointing was the service. Time taken to repeat the chicken starter for the 1st time almost runied our apetite. A 3rd repeat came after we were half done with our main course. The main course was good. I didnt like the chicken dish,it was bit on the harder side. The Mutton a.k.a the mughlai Gosht was awesome. It was very well cooked & the gravy too tasted equally good!! The Hunan fish was average. The most dissappointing part was the desert section. Desert section comprised of Gulab Jamun, Baked mihidana, Chumchum & "cake". There was a full sized cake served which was brought from 'mio amore' & the plate still had mio amore's mark on it. It was on the stale side, thats what happens when one buys a cake off the shelve from mio amore. The gulab jamun was hard. The baked mihidana was the only saving grace. To much surprise there wasnt a single icecream. We had made a pre-booking, so it was very dissppointing when the service ran short of food or served incomplete buffet. The only saving grace was that the food,whatever was served tasted good mostly.

Wont go back for buffet atleast. They need to revisit their buffet menu & thier readiness to serve a buffet.

I had thought of this restaurant as a premium one considering it belongs to the same owner as balle balle dhaba in sector 1 salt lake.
Every time you order something for delivery its not available. They have no clue on services. Hospitality is zilch.

Ambience, interiors, decor is good. A good option if you are looking for a low cost buffet with a vast variety of dishes..It starts with a welcome drink mostly Aam panna. The starters are quite good but the main course was not up to the mark..Desserts are okayish but the biggest disappointment is they don't serve any icecream.

It is located in Sector-v, in globsyn building. I went there few months back. By the name I thought I should be vegetarian but I was wrong. Don't go by its name. Briyani is too good here. Ambience is superb. Spacious area. Staffs are cordial and friendly. Decor us beautiful. Food was good.

It is in the interior of sector-5 so google navigation came to our rescue! We had a decent dining experience. It is NOT a Rajasthani themed restaurant and one can find chinese and pan-Asian dishes here as well. The ambience is nice, though we battled with small flies every few minutes. We also requested them to change a few of the cutlery because they were not clean, BIG THUMBS DOWN. Not many options for vegetarians like us. We ordered crispy potatoes honey lemon style and crispy chilli baby corn for starters along with wanton soup and burnt ginger soup.For mains, we ordered rumali rotis,kulcha,dal,paneer ki sabzi and mixed veggies and masala papad. All this to gulp down with masala thumbs up and sweet lime soda. The serving time is decent. The food was good, not something out of the world. Wanton soup tasted bland and the rumali rotis were a bit chewy. The highlights were the burnt ginger soup and paneer ki sabzi. What we also liked about the place was the ample seating space. The overall experience was decent but i doubt if we'd make a second appearance here!

We had a team party planned for buffet lunch in Jaisalmer. Everything seemed fine until they started serving the food. The food seemed stale , fish kebab was good but you could not get the Stewart serve you more than two . i asked for four , i got 3 and a half piece and adding to my wonder the dish never came around again. I asked for it but no response from the waiter. So STARTER in jaisalmer for unlimited buffet means two pieces of  every dish. Don't dare ask for more.
Main dish was okay sort of, mutton was good , apart from that noodles and rest items were not good enough that you'd pay 600 for.
Desert was the ultimate, they boondi raita gulab jamun a kind of good sweet and thitd class cakes(the ones you would gwt in monginis) why would i pay and go to a restaurant and eat monginis cake.

Well my experience with Jaisalmer was extremely poor hope you guys have a better luck.

I visited this restaurant first time with great hope due to it's name of a Rajasthan city.But it's trouble sum to climb so many stairs as there is no arrangement of lift.The decor is nice the prices are too reasonable but the food is just o.k,after 8 P.M.it's became too noisy and the service became poor.One can choose it if he can compromise with quality of food.

Visited this place today for an office gathering. The food was not at all up to the mark. This was my second visit- the last one was equally disappointing. They somehow managed to make bad gulab jamuns as well, which is a real hard thing. The service was too slow, whereby only 3 tables were occupied. Wasn't a busy day. 
2 stars for the location/interior.

Went for a lunch buffet. Though we had reservation we were made to sit upstairs which is mainly meant for ala carte. Best of all they were themselves confused where to sit us as all the lunch buffet items were arranged downstairs. Next we weren't served water and not given any cutlery. On repeated asking we were given a glass of water at the very end. They said there is shortage of spoons, so all of us weren't lucky enough to get one. The starters were served by the waiters at our table and they were rushing through every item and tactfully skipped the prawn item. On asking for it twice they brought it in a very limited quantity. I was in no mood to eat as all these dramas spoiled it. I complained to the owner on my way out and his reply was I have seen that you guys were not been served properly but these staffs are new and not trained, come back after few months for better service. After that he went on with how many restaurants he has and how successfully they are all running.

Visited today for an office lunch. Utterly disappointed. They overloaded our dishes with starters most of which were lacking in taste. They had burnt the chicken kebab beyond eating. The fish sheshwan was smelling. Only the potato roast was tasty.
Coming to the main course, only the chicken biryani was excellent. I don't understand why they didn't make a mutton softer, even spoons failed. Chicken curry was decent. I didn't have the wish to taste other dishes. Desserts were OK.the cham cham was fine, so was the cake. The absence of an ice cream was not expected.
Overall, think before spending here. Not worth the money.

Went to Jaisalmer with friends for dinner. We opted for buffet. The menu was wide spread. The starters were good, but they need to improvise more on the taste. Only a few items like the fish Irani kabab, paneer tikka and the mutton seekh kabab were delicious. There were around ten starters including veg items as well. The main course had lots of items and mostly all of them were delicious. The noodles and vegetable mix tasted great, the chicken biryani and chana gosht were great too. Methi chicken malai was more on the sweeter side. There was more but had to leave them since I was almost full. ;-) The dessert section was simply delectable. Don't forget the baked mihidana......that's the main attraction. The pineapple cake and the brownie also tasted lovely. All in all, a good experience but not an awesome one.

Have heard about this place from friends bevause they have there office parties here. Frankly speaking, didnt expect much of this place on the first go. But it realy turned out to be a very nice experience. Had dinner buffet, and it had some great combinations oh both mughlai and chinese cuisine. This is the only place where i found main course equally tasty as starters. The highlight of this place is its value for money. Could have given it a perfect five only if included ice creams in its desserts buffet section. Nevertheless, a worth visiting there.. :)

Have been there multiple time. It's a value for money kind of restaurant . most of the small parties we arrange there with small budgets. Good food average service. Nicely decorated. Reducing my rating after my latest visit. We ordered for Tawa Ghost, which is our favourite there. We served something by the restaurant which is not tawa ghost. Spoke with manager about it and he was so adamant to convince us that it is actually their tawa ghost. Didn't like he attitude and the test of the food at all.

Located at webel mor, this one is easily accessible after office hours. They have some never seen before royal chairs for couples, however we being a group of 6 managed with some ordinary chairs. The biriyani was not upto the standard of the biggest biriyani chains of Kolkata but then again the tandoori chicken and the chicken tikka masala were pretty good. But the thing that would make me come back to this place again is the awesome stuffs they have. Everytime we were finished with a dish they would be coming to serve the next. What more they happily distributed the dishes amongst the respective persons. When you have your best(est) of friends with you the food hardly matters but yes, I am satisfied! üòä

For main course we had butter chicken and butter nun.

People go to a restaurant for many reasons..food is one of them.  Well if that's the one them jaisalmer scores on that front with palatable food, nothing extraordinary though. Very functional, with different types of table available. Bit noisy for my taste. We got a table in the corner underneath a mammoth TV. Watched the sports channel while having dinner.. A unique experience, not sure whether I would like to repeat it. We ordered tandoori paneer.. The paneer was tasty and not rubbery as you would find in other places, however it had more oil than required. Location is good but parking could be an issue.

Jaisalmer is this new joint, I have been hearing about, for some time now.

Nested on the 1st floor of the Globsyn Building in Sector V, SaltLake, which also hosts other eateries like KFC, Fuel Inn, Paparazzi etc, this one, is hard to miss.

The Fa√ßade and exterior is huge, high and grand. The exterior area, has meshy hanging art-forms, lit with rice lights, quite unique. The kitchenette is made on the lines of ‚ÄòNothing to Hide‚Äô style, which is getting increasingly popular these days, and it faces the exterior of the restaurant, and you can actually see the meat being marinated, the kebabs getting char-grilled, and how food moves amongst the chefs.

The restaurant has 2 floors, and would be something around a 100-seater one. The Upper storey is cosier and prettier. The walls and pillars are all made in a pattern of broken tile pieces, and quite eye-catchy. The colors are soft, pastel, and soothing. The furniture is white, and goes well with the theme. We were a group of 5 and settled for a booth in the extreme corner of the Lower floor.

Coming to the menu, this place has an extensive Mughal menu, and add to it, a surprise Chinese section too. Hence, this place can be deemed as a multi-cuisine one, though everything else is too Indianized. This is something which I don‚Äôt understand. If the name of your Restaurant is ‚ÄòShanghai‚Äô, I do not expect ‚ÄòFish Amritsari‚Äô or ‚ÄòPeshawari Chhole‚Äô to be served.  A conflict of interest, you see.

Jaisalmer has a buffet option too, with a decent spread, but we decided to go a-la-carte, because the menu is again, an Indo-Chinese confluence, and we didn't want to mix up palettes.

Anyway, we asked for a couple of Kebabs ‚Äì Chicken Bhatti Kebab, Mutton Boti Kebab and Irani Fish tikka Kebab. The Mutton Boti Kebab was unavailable and we had to settle for Adrak ke Panje. Now, the plates serve 4 pieces of Kebabs in each, which is something that pisses me off. The standard, globally accepted (Ok, at least Kolkata standard) is 6 pieces, if not 8. 

4 pieces in a dish is problem for groups of 3 or 5. Increase the price by 50%, but provide 6 pieces, for food‚Äôs sake! We had to order 2 plates for some and a combo of half/full for the others. 

Before starting, we discovered a strand of hair in the salad of the Kebab Plate. They apologized, and replaced it quickly. The Kebabs were good, specially the Irani Fish tikka. The chicken Bhatti Kebab was a bit on the sour side, probably the marinating had gone a bit wrong, or maybe, I don‚Äôt know, it was meant to taste that way.  The Adrak ke Panje was smooth, tasty, soft mutton, marinated with Ginger/Mustard. Next we ordered Mutton Biriyanis, Chicken Rara Punjabi and Kadai Mutton. Roomali roti and Butter Naans as well. The mains were pretty good too. The Biriyani is at par to the Alibaba, Shiraz kinds. The food is a bit on the oilier side, but then who comes to a diner to have salads? We were pretty full to the brim when we finished the mains and had to pack some leftover chicken. 

Now, coming to the service ‚Äì Huge room of Improvement!

My Wife had requested for a Sweet Lime Soda halfway through her meal, and it did not land the next 15 mins. On re-enquiring, the waiter had seemingly given it a miss, and scooted back to the juice counter to re-order. When it arrived, she had already finished her meal. The waiters seem to be a little less skilled in handling the dishes, and serving was not at all satisfactory. They dropped some onions and salads on the table while serving. Plates would clatter into one another when they placed them on the tables. To divide 2 Biriyanis into 3 plates, one of them did a most complicated maneuver, virtually possible.

On asking for desserts, they said they do not have anything except Gulab Jamun, and suddenly one of them remembered Firni. We ordered Firni, and much to the disappointment he came back 2 mins later, saying Firni is not available too.

To upgrade themselves from just a Multi-Cuisine restaurant to a Fine eating experience, the staff needs to be trained, like big-time. Overall, huge potential. No major complaints.

Biggest Plus side ‚Äì Super Pocket friendly, considering Ambience/taste.

Food is decent. This place has good value for money. Ambience is good. But the service is the real let down. Always have your order repeated or they might end up bringing non-veg dishes when you had ordered pure veg. Also, they barely have anything besides gulab jamun for dessert. But Indian and Chinese dishes are savoury. Would recommend

Attended in one group of 10 people. Got served with sarter followed by main course. But I am feeling really sorry to say that service as well as food both were very bad. Welcome drink was pathetic. I strongly suggest to stay away from this. Nearby BBQ is really far better. I am a simple customer doing job in sector v.  But I felt so bad today that I felt forced to write this negative review so that people gets some prior feedback before coming here in future.

It's always nice to find a new place around especially near ur office primarily because u can run to the place when u r bored of ur daily routine lunch..
Requested by a friend to have lunch at this new place as it's very near to our work place.
Loved the ambience...size of the place n decor.. though won't be giving anything more than 3.5...unsure of the lighting so my apologies on that part...

Courteous staff...good food...reasonable pricing...

Looking forward to visit the place for a buffet next time...hope to have a good experience...

Good ambiance. beautiful seating. Tall purple chairs, soft cushions. the staff were very polite. Went for ala carte meal with mutton biriyani and chicken chaap. The chap was not that great but the mutton biriyani was brilliant. the mutton was fresh and soft. Would like to visit here soon.

Well, you may expect rajasthani ambience with rajasthani cuisines here, but let me tell you, don't get confused by the name. They purely serve Indian and Chinese, with no specialization in rajasthani cuisines at all. What's in a name, btw?

Location:  salt lake sector V, at globsyn building.

Ambiance: Nice decor, sufficiently large two-storied dining space and beautiful outside view make the ambiance perfect. The lights hanging just above the table were perfect add-ons. 4/5

Service: This was a bit let down. We got our refreshment and starter in almost no time, but it took about 45 minutes to have our main course on our table. Apart from this, the staffs are well behaved and have knowledge of the cuisines. 3/5

Food: We took mango and tango as mocktail, lat me Kai and lemon chilli murgh tikka as starter, chicken Hakka noodles, chicken oriental pot rice, kung pao chicken and sliced chicken, baby corn and black mushroom cooked in home style as our main course.
Mango and tango: Was just out of the world. Every sip worth it. Full of pulp till the last sip and I was literally longing for more. So mangolicious!!
Lat me Kai: Was just perfect as required. The chicken portions were marinated properly and had a rich taste of flavour in every bit.
lemon chilli murgh tikka : Chicken pieces were succulent and juicy, tasted awesome.
Chicken Hakka noodles: It was good but nothing great. Could have been better taste wise.
sliced chicken, baby corn and black mushroom cooked in home style: It was good in taste. The gravy came white and the flavour of the sauce blended properly with chicken, mushroom and baby corn. It was less oily and less spicy as it required to be.
Chicken Oriental pot rice: It contains fried rice, and chicken, mushroom, baby corn mixed with white sauce on top of the rice. 
Rice, when mixed with the toppings tasted awesome. It went well with the kung pao chicken which was again very tasty. 4.5/5

Overall, food is really tasty here with good variety available in the menu and value for money is quite good.

UPDATE: Again, gave this restaurant a visit and this time ordered mango and tango, lemon chilli murgh tikka again. With these two, ordered chicken biriyani, butter naan and chicken rara punjabi.
Quality and presentation of mango and tango have degraded. Previously, it was more of mangoish and pulpy; now it's more of orangy and obviously less pulpy. With no doubt, Loved the previous one as am a mango lover.¬†
Lemon chilli murgh tikka remains same quality wise.
Chicken biriyani was really good, not so greasy, not so dry. It was just perfect and has a distinct aroma of spices required for a tasty biriyani. but today's showstopper was Chicken Rara Punjabi. It was too good to describe in words. 4 Pcs of chicken came with a thick gravy containing chicken keema and tasted delicious. For the ones who love spicy Indian side dishes, this is recommended for you guys!!! It goes perfectly well with butter naan which again was very soft.
Overall, nice experience once again. You can gorge on real good Indian and Chinese cuisines here without burning a hole in your pocket. THUMBS UP from my side.

P.S. Go for A-la-Carte!!

Jaisalmer is a lovely name to have but one shouldnt expect this plc to have any Rajasthani effect.. Its all about Indian and chinese. The ambience is v nyc.. Its spacious and comfortable moreover gvng a perfect view while dining.. The soft lights hanging just above the tables make it awesum.. Cumng to the food we ordered chicken reshmi kabab along with a galauti kabab.. Both of which was good to eat.. However the galauti kabab gets more score.. For mains we ordered chicken tikka masala, chicken biryani and chicken lababdar.. Chicken lababdar had white gravy and it was cooked really well.. I kpt on licking my fingers.. Chicken tikka was with the red gravy and it also tasted fine.. Chicken biryani was good too.. It wasnt tht heavy and not too greasy.. Kuddos to tht too.. For breads we opted fr rumali roti, masala kulcha and parathas.. All of which was good! However bng on a sunday tht i visited i found the service not to be so overwhelming.. The waiters out thr seemed to be in more hurry thn usual.. We litrlly had to kp waitng to ask the waiters fr extra help.. Thy were in so hurry tht wen we asked for our respective finger bowls thy gt us the bill instead.. Service needs to be improved.. Overall a pocket friendly restaurant wid good food!!

Visited this restaurant for the first time today, and was pleasantly surprised. Situated at Globsyn Crystals, this place has a soothing effect on you, the moment you enter. Contrary to most eateries at Salt lake, this is a spacious place, with warm ambience, quality food and a good view of the area, replete with glass windows, and LCDs adorning the place. The menu has a good blend of Indian, Chinese and South-East Asian cuisine. We ordered for Jhal Frezi, Navratan Korma and Garlic Naan, and the bill for two was well within our budget (Around Rs. 500 including taxes). The only hitch is that it gets a bit crowded during lunch hours, due to the office crowd from the surrounding area of Sector V. However, if one is looking for good food and a decent ambience, at an affordable price, at Sector V,.... this is definitely the place to be.

I liked the food but the place is average. The team mistook our order but that can be forgotten as human errors is forgivable. I like the ambience though but slightly high priced where the food is just the average and you can get the same dishes in any restaurant if you have buffet at a lower cost.

Customer Service:2.5/5
Value for money:4/5
Location:4/5
Total:3.6/5(No metrics available for giving 0.6,so have to give a 3.5)

One damn good thing about this place is its value for money food.One simply can't expect succh a cheap place,that too in the heart of sector-v.Combined with the awesome ambience and superb view.But the customer service is a big let down.Seems that the waiters are simply novice and not trained to handle customers.For eg-I had ordered a Special Mutton Biriyani.They delivered me (Nothing special) Chicken Biriyani.I ordered Pahari Kababs.It comes in 6 pcs.But they served us 4 pcs only.After I enquired to the floor manager about the incident,the waiter came and told us that he had kept them aside for later serve!!(Complete lie I guess)
But man the kababs were awesome.It seemed the chefs took special care in preparing them as they were being served after a fair bit of time.

We went there for an Ala-a-carte.
We ordered two pahari kababs,One full Tandoori,One aforementioned Biryani and one Masala Kulcha and the total Bill was only around 700 bucks.
A complete value for money place.Dining recommended only after the 15th of a month.

Beautiful decor with huge white pillars. There is white in every nook and corner. The bar is a also something good to look at. Overall ambience is 5star. We had Indian food and it was very good. Biryani is light yet tasty. There galouti kebab was not up to the mark. My wife loves prawn so asked for tandoori prawns but unfortunately I was told that tandoori items are not served on weekends. I wonder why such a stupid idea. Bar menu didn't had any kind of gin. The pricing of the food as well as the drinks are well set to attract more customers. By the looks of the place it feels expensive but it isn't. One more thing I liked is the personal attendant in the loo who helps you with the hand wash.

One reason why this place is highly preferable is value for money. Jaisalmer is one of those best places that offers seriously great and warm ambience with good quality food at reasonable prices. The place looks subtle and is vibrant at the same time. The people take good care of your orders and needs. I didn't find anything out of place at this restaurant.

It sure is a great place to spend good time with your loved ones over a meal.

I visited this place on a weekday to have buffet lunch with my colleagues. Situated at the 1st floor of Globsyn Crystal, this restaurant is resurgent to take on the other mighty ones of Salt Lake Sec V. The ambiance and decor was just wow, a perfect blend of modernity with royalty. The restaurant is spanned across two floors and having a separate family dining area.

We were welcomed with a refreshing welcome drink, Jal jeera sarbat.
In Starters, we were offered five Non-Veg and five Veg items. In Non- Veg - Chicken Kebab (forgot the name), Chicken tengri kebab, shawarma Chicken, Dry chili chicken, Fish, Mutton Sheek. In Veg, there were Paneer, Bubbly aloo, French Fries, Crispy baby corn and a mixed a Veg item. All the starters were really good in taste and would tempt you to have more.
I would like to mention the behavior of the waiters here. They were really cold and lacking willingness to render service. Sometimes we have to ask for some of the starters or spare plates as they were not willingly providing them.
There were 2 soups. As I was already halfway full, didn‚Äôt dare to embarrass my stomach more. :P 
They didn‚Äôt have much choices of salad, at least nothing as such to mention.
In main course we have continental as well as north Indian dishes. The plethora includes- Peas Pulao, Veg Noodles, Chicken Biryani, Hariyali Chicken, Mutton, Fish, Paneer, Dal makhni, and others. Chicken Biryani was dull, the mughal essence was completely missing. However, the Mutton was just overwhelmingly testy. Kudos to them for that preparation. Other items were average. 
In desserts - hot Gulab Jamun, rasagulla, Brownie, Cake, Baked Mihidana and Watermelon. Ice Cream section is a big miss.
Got corporate discount so the bill didn‚Äôt pinch much to our pockets.

Here‚Äôs a quick Scorecard,
Service- 2/5
Decoration/ Ambiance- 5/5
Food- 4/5 (mainly because of the Starters)

Jaisalmer, Sector V - Kolkata are the caterers for my employers.
Every day, some 300-400 (just a rough estimate from me - no specific R & D done) employees gorge on their Veg & Non Veg menu.

For VEG, today, they served Veg Biryani with Mix Raita, Alu Matar and 1 pc Baked Rosogolla - all this for a meagre 60 Rs. On top of that, they accept Sodexo Meal vouchers which means my pocket is never burdened.
Biryani was light and tasty - contained sliced/ chopped paneer, phool gobi, carrot, peas etc (carrot quantity was too much).
Raita was served chilled - which tasted very nice.
Lastly, Dessert was just outstanding.
Service could be more expedite as the no. of staff is very less.
Overall, a very good dining experience.

CHEERS !!!!

This resraurant correctly defines the age old proverb 'all that glitters is not gold'. I went to this place with my two friends for trying out their buffet. Upon entering he restaurant we were quite amazed with the exquisite decor, superbly ornated chairs and tables and impeccable arangements. We were very happy and thought we struck the right chord by choosing this themed restaurant. But alas after this little glory eveything about this restaurant starts going downhill. The restaurant does not own upto its name as there is no rajasthani based platter. We opted for the buffet menu which seemed  the only safe choice. But it was worthless. The starters though large in numbers lacked flavours. The chicken dishes were dry and the vegetables were either burned or overcoooked. One more glitch I felt was that the starters had chinese,lebanon and indian semi dry dishes in the spread  which I personally disliked. Some of the starters like schwezan fish and seekh kabab and crispy chilli corn were good but the rest were simply average in taste. For the main course they had quite a number of food items. I tried the biriyani which was really tasty and I actually enjoyed it. However the other dishes were again just about alright. Though i dared and took a small serving of the mutton curry,the flavours of the curry were quite  bad and  I passed the mutton  on to my friend. I also tried the devil fish(no idea why a chinese side dish was included in the indian food spread) and it tasted nice. But the worst part of the buffet was the dessert. There was no choice of desert at all. It was as if  the authority have completely forgotten about this integral part in any buffet. They just had halwa,gulabjamun,rasgolla and chocolate cake and none of them tasted good. The gulabjamun though soft lacked the adequate sweetness and the chocolate cake was just above average for the taste. Though the buffet price..i.e. 660 including the taxes is very reasonable for the number of dishes served, but still at the end it is very disappointing to pay that amount of money for the quality of food.I personally feel that enhancing the quality of the dishes must be on the priority list of the management for the place to actually go in sync with its outward beauty and lavish decor.

Wanted to have lunch buffet somewhere new so thought of giving this place a try. The place was nice to look at and the staffs were polite. There were variety of starters which got me excited. They gave us a welcome drink which was on the sweeter side and did not appeal my taste buds. I may not give the corrects names of the starters so sorry for that nevertheless the first starter was dry chilli chicken - the chicken was dry and not at all succulent which made me think whether it was fresh or not. Then we were served crispy chilli baby corn- according to me this was the best starter. The crispy potato had a weird burnt flavour which partially destroyed my pallet , the shammi kebab was good, sz fish and another fish kebab was good in taste but the quality of the fish was very bad and those were not at all fresh and not soft , murg kebab was okay and there were other veg starters which we did not taste neither the veg soup. We went for the main course from which I took chicken Biryiani and peas pulao which were really good and all the veg items were good. The mutton dish lacked proper seasoning and I did not try the chicken dish so don't know also there was devil fish which was okay. There were no mention of breads anywhere neither the staffs intimated anything about it to us. Now comes the best part of any food that is the dessert section and we were all excited to see what's in store but in a few second all our enthusiasm just vanished when I saw moong halwa (I don't like it so didn't try) gulab jamun ( not soft at all and really disappointing) rosogolla (though I like it I would not prefer it in a buffet restaurant and thank god I was never offered it in any buffet restaurants) lastly there was a chocolate cake which was better out of the lot. One thing which really disappointed our group is that how so ever low the buffet price was they could have at least offered a vanilla ice cream. We paid 660 each for the buffet though the price of the buffet is low I will never try it out again. So unhappy with the dessert section that I can't get over it.

Jaisalmer a new addition to sec-5 restaurant list just beside KFC in the Globsyn building. We went there from office to have team dinner and the choice was worth it. The day we went there they started their bar counter. So the waiters were little busy with the new stuffs but was excited. The restro was decorated nicely, with excellent ambiance for couples, friends, office party as well as family. The buffet menu was not very special hence we went for √Ä la carte. The menu in the buffet was very ordinary with not much variety but the √Ä la carte menu was finger licking. The service was super though the stuffs were little late to serve. The price was as per any standard restro as per the food quality. We enjoyed the food. ¬† We tried chicken bahari kabab, chicken reshmi kabab, Veg galouti kabab, all were up to the mark. For main course we loved the veg pulao , it was mouth watering and tasteful.

Jaisalmer  a new addition to sec-5 restaurant list. Went last night to pack food for dinner at home. I must say the moment you will enter the restaurant you will be pleased with its ambience. The person who took the order was very polite, he requested me to go for Indian as they are expertise on the same but as I was not in a mood for Indian food hence decided to go for Chinese. I order chicken manchow soup, chicken lung kung soup. Chicken lung kung was very good, manchow was quite average. In starter I ordered green and red pepper chicken, which was very testy and in mains tomato mushroom fried rice, prawn Malaysian flat noodles  and sliced chicken with baby corn and black mushroom. Rice was average but the Malaysian noodles and chicken dish was really nice and tasty. While waiting for my food to be made I also tried their summer breeze mocktail which was very spicy but I like the taste. Overall I liked the food. One will also notice the price of all most all the items  are quite low. The only thing which is confusing its name, one will think it's a Rajasthani restaurant but their is no Rajasthani food on menu. suggestion to management if they can add some Rajasthani Rajput dish like Laal Maas, safed maas, jungle chicken to their menu it would be nice and also go with the name of the restaurant.

BAD Service, but good food!!
We 5 heard about the place and drove 10KMs back to our old hub..Sector 5. The ambiance was good and they server buffet as well as Ala-carte. The menu was long and looked enticing, so we went for Ala-carte. But that's where it started falling apart.
We ordered drinks, nothing exotic but simple Beer. It took them 30 mins to just serve the beer (that too after asking them for nothing less then 5-6 times). When the beer arrived, they were warm (although the bottle was cold, the content was warm enough to turn you off). Imagine having warm beer on a hot afternoon!! When asked, we were told that they don't have a chilled stock of the beer we ordered. Although they offered to try and chill the open bottles, we had the first glass of beer, warm.¬†
The situation improved a bit when the food arrived. But the way they served was not professional - Galouti kebab broke while serving in all plates, they missed to serve few of my friends and the list is not short.¬†
I would say, the Chef is good but the guys serving are BAD!

Food: Good. Try the Galouti kebab and the Mutton Rara Punjabi
Ambiance: decent - decor on 1st floor is good, so take the seats on 1st floor (much better than the ground floor seats where they serve Buffet).
Cleanliness: acceptable
Price: decent
Pros: Food, Decor. 
Cons: Service¬†- worst ever.Recommendation: If you have lots of time and don't bother much about service, try them. Otherwise, you will find better options at Sector 5.

Hmmmmm.. I heard about this place from a friend of mine. So thought of visiting there. I and my fellow friend decided to go for lunch buffet so we land up here. Just by entering the restaurant I felt instantly that I m In some fair.. book fair or food fair.. (mela) as nothing seems to be so well organised ...no one to entertain the guests.. we ourselves went and asked for the table ..and then waiter realised that oooo guests have come and showed us the table and gave buffet menu. 
Menu was okay good..  but coming to the service part.. oh my god so worst and slow . Even the water came arund 20 mins late ..in this hot when it should be serve foremost. Starters were served on the table but was too slow .. we had to wait for each item to come to our plate.. 
Coming to the food part.. yes food was indeed good .. tasty.. in starters we had paneer tikka which was soft and yummy. . Then followed up with that was tandoori aloo that was okay nothing exciting ..then came crispy chilli baby corn which was cold so dint tasted well and followed with that crispy potato which was again cold. Then we were served pepper chicken ,it was good and dry chilli chicken which was good too only problem was it wasn't boneless .. had it been boneless it would have tasted more better. 
Coming to main course there were many items but I tried out only a few like dal makhani which was cold so tasted worst . Veg jhal farezi was good . Chicken biryani was finally hot n good followed with some chicken Curry which was also tasty . 
Coming to desert that God that was good there was moong dal halwa,hot gulab jamun,black forest pastry ,strawberry pastry,rasgulla,brownie. Only the desert section was perfect in taste n all.  Overall food rating I would give 3/5 and service 1/5. Ambience was just okay did not match up with the name of the restaurant.  Name was jaisalmer ... but nothing of rajasthan style.  It was more a colourful one I guess inspired by aisan paints. I would think twice before going again.. as my first impression wasn't good on this restaurant.

Well I got to know about this place from zomato. However i was not able to order online from zomato. Seems there is some issue with the address. My office is just located behind this restaurant. Thus I used food panda to order. Delivery experience was good and was on time. I ordered a chicken bharta and biryani  food was very good in taste unlike the usual spicy chicken stuff available in Calcutta. I felt the preparation of non veg food here is really different from other places. It reflects in the taste. Over all a very much satisfying online delivery and good meal.

Starting with the beautiful decor and comfortable seats, Jaisalmer is really a place to visit. I had buffet over there, that will surely satisfy buffet craving without burning a hole in your pocket.. Food quality awesome and fresh.. they have many varieties in starters and desserts. The deduction of .5 is due to their slow service. As we went for friends reunion, it didn't bother us.

Firstly I want to mention the the ambiance and decor of this restaurant. According to me one of the best in Kolkata. With that soft lights hanging just above the tables make it awesome.

Now come to foods I ordered Galauti Kabab. As it was not available tried the Chicken pahari Kabab.It was out of the world. The soft but juicy kabab marinated with various herbs is¬† just a pleasant experience for any foodies.Also I tried the Biriyani. It was very ordinary.

Staffs are well mannered and Cordial but¬† the preparation time was such a long that you can easily go for shopping to CC between the order and Serving time.

I read the review on bad service but I ignored it and still came here with my friends in the hope of visiting a new place but only to find the absolute WORST service for restaurants in Kolkata city. Note the points:-
1. Drinks ordered - 2 drinks forgotten and came with a lot of delay.
2. Starters came cold.
3. I was not happy with that and I requested the person to take care which he promised but the icing on the cake happened..
4. We ordered "yellow Dal amritsari" which came as black dal and he insisted that amritsari dal is served black. The chef did not arrive to answer this 
5. The changed yellow dal came in exactly 2 minutes and had no salt.
5. No change of plates and spoons, forks until I reminded them
6. The manager came and re-iterated that they were very experienced people and with reluctance apologised.


PLEASE EXPECT THE WORST RESTAURANT SERVICE IN KOLKATA AND DO NOT HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS

Its a nicely decorated place with a really impressive menu but the service is below standard.
We had to wait for the food for a really long time. Also we kept calling the staff a number of times so that we can actually place the order. We even went & requested the manager to send some staff to take our order.
Hope instead of spending on the decoration they had paid a little attention in recruiting sufficient & appropriate number of staff..

Anyways won't be visiting again for such a bad service..

Went to dis place on 30th may for dinner buffet
ambience n decor: nice
cleanliness : perfect
price: decent lil below average(buffet cost 600 per pax)
taste of food: good
no toilet in the ground floor
service: bad, obnoxious, preposterous, gross no adjective is enough
served alcohol after 25 mins of ordering, dont know if they were brewing it.
since it was a bday party we were carryin cake, we had it on the small plates given by them, then they tried to served deir starters on those plates only( cream of the cake was stained on the plate)
stuffs were very reluctant to repeat the starters. we have to ask dem many times.¬†
we took our seat n placed the order by 9'oclock, but alcohol n starters started coming from 9:30, dont know y?
and to add on the surprize 3 out of 6 desserts dey have are finished by 10, dey dint bother to refill the bowls even after repeated request!
please dont visit dis place unless u want to waste ur money!
the name is jaisalmer but no marwari dish were there!

its one of the worst places I've ever had a buffet lunch!! literally d worst place to hang out! I was just there for the lunch today! The buffet is pretty costly nd d food dey serve is not at all worth it! Prior to d discussion over food I just want 2 mention one thing! The ambience satisfactory! dats y d 1 in review! I was sitting just below an AC! after 5mins or so the AC started leaking! the authority members wre just around d corner! dey dint seem very concerned wid it as I mentioned this 2 dem, as if it was a daily occassion! They started with starters.. ok! bt honestly speaking all the starters tasted same! They served fish, potato, chicken, mutton, baby corn as starters wid different names but each nd everything tasted alike! The service! Never up to the mark! They were to only serve the starters but ¬†as they served it, it seemed dat they were in a great hurry to finsh the course! We cudnot even complete the first bite of the first starter they served, came the second one! Then comes the main course part! there was a dish of noodles prepared nd kept! I am a noodle lover nd I apparently went for that! The noodles was rubbery to chew! I have not even tasted this type of noodles in the footpath stalls also! It was too rubbery to chew nd more of all tasteless! after getting along wid the noodles, I took chicken biriyani nd chicken masala! The chicken in the biriyani was literally dry to be chewed properly nd more of all the biriyani was not up to the mark! the chicken masala dish was better in comparison to the others! after then I tried the mutton rogan josh! There was NO MUTTON.... ALL THE PIECES SERVED WERE FATS OF MUTTON! ME AND MY FAMILY TOOK 7 PIECES IN TOTAL ND ALL TURNED OUT TO BE THE SAME. I just cudnot have nemore of it! tried the desert part!! the rosogollas they served were even smaller than a ping-pong Ball! nd it was not of any standard compared to other sweet shops and there was a very few variety in the desert counter! ¬†I am really disheartened by this restaurant in particular! never thought that my money nd time will be wasted like this! Its just a waste of everything! I would strongly request the authoritative people to take certain actions against dis! we people do not go out to eat to get such disheartened! ¬†SORRY TO SAY THIS BUT IT WAS NOT WORTH MY MONEY AND TIME!

It is all about waiting for a long queue while there are abundance spare seats and having dinner with lousy food. In three words, I can say that "Time was wasted". They serving was poor. The heights of the bulbs are so low that it hit your head. I do not want to waste much word on quality of food. It was a total wastrel.

Being situated in SectorV (infinity building) .... its one of best options i have¬† for lunch in weekdays from ofc .... i used to visit it once every week for several weeks when it was launched initially .... nowadays the frequency of visit has come down to 1 in two weeks almost .... 
The most important point to be said about this restuarant is -- the standards of 'spice' level in food considered here is a bit less than global/normal standards i.e an item which is claimed to be 'very spicy' here is actually 'moderately spicy' acc to normal level in other restuarants ,meaning less spicy items(here in¬† Jaisalmer) are actually sweeter in taste ..... so proper selection of items is required .... coz Jaisalmer has a mixed public review and most of the people¬† have talked to, are of the opinion that some of the food items are sweeter in taste which is unwelcoming .... unfortunately the buffet items are full of these 'sweeter' dishes .....¬† so my advise -- go for ala-carte , and certainly for the very spicy items (u would find it just moderately spicy, as described above) ..... 
The ambience inside is great .... and is the most spacious among Sector V restuarants ... has two floors .... has some LED TVs as well catering to your entertainment needs .... my fav items are mixed fried rice(though not mentioned in menu, but is served if asked), schezwan mixed noodles ... devils chicken .... biriyani is also nice .... quantity is sufficient .... 
As regards to pricing, they have increased the price of items once sinch their launch , but considering the ambience,location and other factors, i would still say pricing is not that much (a very imp criteria to distinguish it from its competitors in the area) ...... maybe this weekday too i would be visiting it again ;)

A good restaurant in sector V if I go¬† through ambiance but if I go by food it's not that good at all . The starters were good but when we asked to repeat certain starters they showed reluctance to serve it. The main course was average , nothing special that would draw me to come for the second time but the biggest let down was deserts. i have never seen a buffet menu with 4 deserts and that also out of 4 there were 2 ordinary cakes . A big let down.

Nice decor with comfortable cooling in this hot summer. This is the we tried our taste buds. First time buffet, and now ala carte, and I must say they show their skills in ala carte. We took chicken lasooni kabab, fish tikka, schezwan prawn, sozo pot rice, Chicken with mashroom and babycorn. Each and every dish was a star. Chicken and fish are soft, tender, fresh and delicious. But their dim sum, beverage and desert section was totally absenct or else its a five starer one.

A well located, two storeyed restaurant right in the heart of Kolkata's IT hub. The buffet spread is good, but they need more variety.  The food is good but it's not the best. The place is an expensive affair and you'd expect exceptionally good food. But it ain't. The service however is not bad but it gets difficult for them to handle when there's a rush. Overall the place isn't bad.

Jaisalmar, quite a huge two layered restaurant is located in busy office area of Salt Lake, Sector 5. The decor of the place & the see through kitchen just after the entrance leaves a lasting impression in your minds. Its name has nothing to do with the type of food available here. You mostly get Indian or Chinese with both buffet and ala car ta option.    
I had been to this place few days back with my family, that was my 2nd visit. We fortunately got a place near the large glass shields on windows to settle down, after a wait of almost 30 minutes. We ordered some Indian stuff, and as usual found it to be very tasty, and to our liking. The wait time and the services of hard pressed waiters are two areas which the management should work upon. 

I give two thumbs up for the food and ambience.

1.The 1st time I went to this plc was on 25th Dec.the staff had already prepared us for wat was about to come by saying that today they have shortage of staffs.
2.inside we did not have staff to attend us.nobody to give us a glass f water for good 20mins.den I got veg soup with mushrooms in it whereas I made it clear that I am allergic to mushrooms.do not put mushrooms in any dish. After that in d main course there was a strand of hair. + malai kofta was as hard as a rock.and their chef said that by mistake they put it in microwave.  So my 1st experience ended in a disaster . 
3.my frnz said the food is good so I still gave another try. Today on 24th may we ordered veg schezwan chowmein + steamed fish. We placed d order sharp at 8.30pm. The person who took the order said food will be delivered within 45mins.at 9.30 we called again.this time another person took our call and said- oh mam ur order? We forgot. The other person who took ur order did not forward it.v r on it.it wil b delivered in 20mins (at this hour we did not have time enuf to place d order from somewhr els) .at 10.10 our food came.our bill was ‚Çπ342 and the delivery boy did not have ‚Çπ8 change. So rather than giving us back d ‚Çπ2 and giving some relief from d harassment we had.he instead took d ‚Çπ8 . 
4.we thought that the torture was over now let me enjoy my food. But the torture did not end there.  My steamed fish was not delivered but they chose to deliver chilly fish instead. I had to eat that chilly fish. 

5.CONCLUDING I would say that- if the management does not know how to hire trained staff they WILL NOT survive the market. Are the customers fools? Is this the way to harass a customer ? They could have told me initially wen I placed d order that it will take 1hour 40mins den I could have ordered from somewhr els.they blocked a customer only to leave me widout any option? Taking away my ‚Çπ8 and not having the curtosy to send back my change + delivering d wrong food.  they should stop fooling the customers and taking the customers seriously . 
I WOULD NOT recommend this unprofessional 'restaurant' to anyone . don't get fooled by their sweet talking. The staff wil sweet talk you till u place d order & then d torture begins.if u value ur money , time and like having good food go to a place where they give immense importance to the customers. 
BAD SERVICE, NOT PROFESSIONAL , HARASSMENT .

Pathetic service, bad food, the manager mr bishwajit tried to convince us by giving us 10% discounts on the bill. The waiters were literally illiterate in respect to the restaurant, they didn't knew anything about the restaurant. Pathetic service, after the food arrives plate are being put up, we had ask for each and everything to serve us, to fill the glasses. I would recommend everyone not to go there. my treat was ruined bad very bad very very bad service. only 4 waiters to serve more than 50 people, i mean if u don't have the budget then why are you opening restaurants. for every fault they said sir sunday hai pls understand.

Food : I'm a vegetarian . It was very good . Especially the Mongolian vegetable which was stir fried starter. Potato was ordinary . Non vegetarian folks said taste was good but fish was very very smelly . Not good at all . The shwarma was the best 

Service : frequency of food arrival at table is terrible. Shwarma was out of stock and only arrived after dessert

I have visited there twice.

The d√©cor of this place, attracted me more than any other place. 

Sprawling over the right wing of Globsyn, spacious n aesthetically designed Jaisalmer will get your attention for sure. 

Went there with my wife on weekend & been there with colleagues on weekdays. For a first timer a buffet seemed to be the best bet.

Their lunch buffet is 550+tax with 10% corporate discount. 

This was affordable. And the menu had a lot of variety in weekdays, but in weekends lunch buffet you may have seen the different pictures as comparatively the starter items & dessert items less in weekends(don‚Äôt know why) and they have yet to add the ice creams in dessert in Dessert as they don‚Äôt have the machine at the moment. 

All over its a good place to enjoy the food with family n friends.

Sounds like a piece of the Desert State amidst the busy office paara of Kolkata. Its adorned with similar decor which is beautiful and serene and puts a soothing effect while you gorge into their buffet spread, but mind you ! The food has got nothing to do with Rajasthan. Confusing enough !
The spread is a bit confusing too. It mixes chinese, Indian, continental, Lebanese and what not !
The Lebanese salad was something to want more of. The starters were all pretty tasty and worth the wait as service is a little on the slower pace.
Main course has nothing to gaga over. For the 1st time I see a buffet has a Bengali sweet spread mostly rather than a lot of cakes pastries and souffles. Offcourse it has the pastries but the sweets outdo them in numbers.
All in all a good alternative if you get bored (if at all) by the better Buffet Neighbour in Sector V.

The moment you enter into this facility in an office campus, you would be welcomed with a see through kitchen where chefs are continuing their work. It's a two tiered restaurant serving Indian ad Chinese delicacies.
The food was good as compared to other restaurants around the place. But the service was a bit finicky and the waiters were having a tough time to serve everyone. Buffet was served as well. Since it was a Saturday night, the place was packed with patrons. This troubled the waiters. Although they are very courteous.
All in all a good and noisy experience.

A Restaurant better than some in the neighborhood...

Pros:

1) Ambiance is awesome.

2) Food is fabulous.

3) Price is within the budget of any middle-class family.

Cons:

The main problem is the service. Service is very bad. The behaviour of the service boys are pathetic. They are so rude that they doesn't care about the complain. They told lie. We have our order deliver after an hour of the Ordering and that too shouting a lot. The delivery boy was so adament that he was not even bothering our shouting and our request to call his manager.

I would suggest if you are going to this place, please sit at the ground floor. Though the first floor is just fabulous, but the negligence about serving the food will be in the highest part if you are at the first floor.

Warning:

Never go for a Buffet here. Go for A-la-carte.

We went to Jaisalmer from office in a group of 24. The first thing that amazed us was the d√©cor. Done in whites and cr√®me colours with huge glass walls on one side, the place gives a feel of open air sitting with all the comforts of air conditioning. The wooden shutters in primary colours add an old-world rustic charm to the place. The place is spread over two floors and hence rarely crowded. Even on a Friday evening no one had to wait for a table.
Coming to the food now. Taste varied from okay to great. We had Chicken Tandoori, Chicken Reshmi kebab for starters. While the tandoori was quite good, the reshmi kebab could have been softer. For the main course we had Chicken Biryani, Kashmiri Pulao, Egg Pulao with Butter chicken, Chicken Lababdar, Kadhai Chicken and Chicken Reshmi Masala as side dish. The biriyani was quite good and light. So were the pulaos. To their credit they did not make the pulaos too sweet. Amongst the chicken dishes I liked Chicken Reshmi Masala and Kadhai Chicken best. The rest were okay. The keema naan was soft and a good variation from the rice dishes. But one thing I didn't like was the service. Although the attendants were courteous, serving each dish took way too long.

My verdict:
Food: 3.5
D√©cor: 5
Service: 2.5

Edit: Went again with a friend. Service quite prompt this time. May be last they were struggling to serve so many of us together, though I do not know why that happened as the restaurant was quite empty at that time.
Revised service rating : 3

My office is located in Sector 5, a minute walk from Jaisalmer and hence it has become one of the primary places that is almost booked on Fridays. My friends and I have visited there 12 times now and always ordered Ala carte. The first time we ordered only vegetarian dishes and were certainly disappointed (except for the Dal makhani). However, the other 11 times have been good. The tandoori and chicken offering at Jaisalmer are really good and meet the expectations of a non veg lover. The chicken tandoori, chicken tikka kebab and all the chicken gravy dishes are absolutely delightful. 

The ambiance of the place is ethnic and beautiful with a hint of Rajasthan in it. 

The service is something the restaurant needs to work on as it is not only slow but also uncoordinated and sloppy.¬† If they work on it, it can be a great place for dining and hangout with friends even on weekends.

The staff here can definitely ruin your day . The service needs huge improvement , They have the iserve system placed on the tables which also sometimes the staff simply switches of without noticing. The manager can be seen loitering around .¬†

Coming to the food , I tried the ala carte as the buffet didnt look promising enough .
The crispy chilly babycorn was nice and crisp ,¬†
The dal was good though still can be improved , the kadhai paneer was nice and paneer was soft , Rumali rotis were also prepared nicely and there was nothing to complain about . Food is worth trying , Will give a visit again as I feel there is more to be explored here

Jaisalmer is definitely the place if you love kebabs !!

My first experience here quite a while back was disappointing but on my latest visit I stuck to the north Indian menu and it was a delightful experience.

Restaurant is big spacious and gives a kind of grand feel. The staff service has a room for improvement. The menu is huge but north Indian food is their strength and one should stick to it. The prices are reasonable with generous servings.

Tried quite a few kebabs and loved each one. Nilgiri seekh, veg galouti kebabs were lovely but babri aloo was the star for me. I think kebabs here are to die for. Had kabuli naan which was yum with decent  paneer butter masala. 

Overall a great place if you stick to their strengths.

They booked a table for us over phone two days before our dinner date. I asked them if they take reservations and they confirmed they do. On the day of the dinner, they called me up in the evening to confirm my table booking. However when we arrived, we were requested to wait for 15 to 20 minutes and requested us to cooperate. Then they ask us to take a table upstairs when the buffet is served downstairs! We said no. We had to keep waiting for tables o be joined to get seated. Their table booking system is unreliable. Basically it's a first come first serve, which is fine but they should not accept bookings in the first place. Let's see how the food is. Food review to follow.

Food review:
Food was good, menu choices could have been more for desserts. The was no ice cream. Increased my rating for the food. Kebabs were soft and tasty. Overall recommended for good food, but can be a better value for money if some menu choices are increased. Also waiters need to be be trained to better know menu names they are serving; this will happen with time.

LOCATION- Opposite the KFC, Globsyn Complex...2mins walk from Webel More.

EXTERIORS- Eye-grabbing...simply looks grand on style!

INTERIORS- Wonderfully decorated, and you will get a regal feel to it...very posh, splendid lighting-just at the right places...u need to visit this place in d evening to get the real feel! ;)

FOOD- We ordered...

1. Chicken Biriyani- I would say the Biriyani was average. It was well cooked, spicy, and had a nice flavour to it. But going by the standards in Kolkata...it can be better!
2. Mutton Galauti Kabab- This was outstanding. One of the best dishes I've had in recent times...soft pieces of Mutton Keema...cooked and smoked in spices...they just melt in your mouth. Its totally worth the hype and truly splendid!!!
3. Iranian Fish Tikka Kabab- tender pieces of fish, smoked in the tandoor and cooked in spices...tasted really unique... I would just visit this place again for this item!!! :D
4. Chicken Tandoor...one of the juiciest chickens I ever had.
5. Masala Papad...this was sumthing new that I tried...was reallyy tangy and spicy
6. Fresh Lime Soda (Sweet)...a perfect blend of sweet and soda.

HOSPITALITY- The staff were courteous, well trained and very professional. They make you feel at home.

OVERALL- A fresh new addition to the food hub of SaltLake Sector-5. It is unique in its own way, and I would definitely like to visit again.
The food is delicious. The pricing is quite reasonable- given the quality of food and service.
It was worth it!

The experience wasn't very satisfying. The staff wasn't particularly attentive and the ambience was alright.
The rice items and dal makhani were 6/ 10 but the breads and paneer veggies were 3/ 10. Oil drenched and not very tasty.
If you are looking for Indian cuisine, I would suggest look elsewhere.

Recently opened in Sector 5, it attracts you from the outside. The interiors are also decent however when you actually sit you realize that its not as sophisticated as the feel it gave initially.¬†

We returned back once as it was overcrowded. Maybe because people love trying new places. Recently we finally ended up for a family dinner.

The food here is decent, the starter wasn't great. We ordered veg galauti kebab and it tasted weird and was very oily. They had some thing going on and served us complimentary roomali papad with salad. However the salad on it was very less considering the size of the papad but on asking they got us additional salad free of charge. The main course was quite decent.

The best part of this place is its super cheap. When the bill arrives you will be shocked that its so pocket friendly!

Decent Decor, but pathetic service. Firstly, the cutlery placed on table was clearly soiled. When we asked the waiter about it, he just replaced it with not even an apology! We'd ordered a plate of Mutton Irani Kebab and the waiter saunters down offering a plate of chicken reshmi Kebab. When we told him we didn't order it, he merely remarked this is whatever you ordered and was asking us what we ordered! All this, with an "I don't care about you" attitude. 

Downvote and de-recommend this place vehemently.

The ambiance here is good. It's a 200m walk from my office so we frequent there often. Service is quick. The ala carte is something to go for. We have tried prawn butter masala, dal tarka, egg tarka, rice n nan. They were really good. Liked the place.
On my last visit , we went for buffet . I must say that I was disappointed. Though they have variety but the quality wasn't that good. 
The place can be visited once in a while but my recommendation would be to go for ala carte.

We were on a restaurant hopping spree. We wanted to be to a place which we had not been  to before. After some looking up on Zomato, we decided on Jaisalmer.
The place looks stunning from  outside and continue to amaze with the decor even when you walk in. 
First, the name is a misnomer. Jaisalmer is not really the place for Rajasthani delicacies. Also, the food was not great. I have added .05 in my rating, for the decor. However, the price was very reasonable. We believe, the prices will shoot up once the establishment completes a few more days.
Aweful service. :-(

The place looks much better and lucrative in photographs, so kudos to the photographer.

Went to lunch with friends on a Friday afternoon. Experience and food left a lot to be desired.

Service - Everyone was absolutely clueless. From attending to us to serving starters, most of the people were passengers on a train without any idea of their destination. After several complaints to the Manager, several incoherent uncoordinated attempts were made to make up for the goof ups, but it was way too little too late.

Food
- Starters: Average. Fish kebab and some of the chicken starters were decent. Nothing new to offer though. Some of the starters were served cold.

- Main course: Good spread. Most of them were decent

- Desserts: Disappointing... The breadth of menu clearly lacked the depth in taste...The Lemon Tart was a cheap variant of what is offered in local roadside shops

- Complimentary drink: Pathetic would be an understatement...The fresh lime soda was the worst I ever had and would be tough to beat.

This place is new and there is a huge scope for improvement...But this learning curve should not be at the expense of customers, especially when they are charging an equivalent of a BBQ Nation or Ocean Grill.

In a nutshell, if you get a place in BBQ Nation, Ocean Grill or even IndySmart this place can be given a miss without having second thoughts/

But they won't repeat any until we request the many times. Also the service is the worst I have ever seen. And food quality is not upto the mark at all.

This is my second time to jaisalmer and it seems to have degraded with service and quality of food over the time. When we went there for first 5-7 minutes no one even bothered to attend us. And after that the quality of kebabs/starters served is pretty bad. Not a single recipe was worth the price. Main course was okay and desserts were good. But overall its pathetic.

bang on the sector 5 globsyn building we  went there on a Friday buffet .. The starters are good there are varieties kebabs on fish, chicken, mutton, prawn as well as veg. Try the fish one more . 
Main course is not on the table as it follow the segment leader bar-b-q nation in this case. It consist of biriyani , rice , chicken etc etc. As many people have their bellies full on starters the main course become bit dull as in this case also. So they can try to make this main course menu bit innovative . But people crave for dessert after this and that's need improvement . Quality of Bengali sweets has lot to be desired . 
Overall priced on the similar range of bar-b-q nation it needs better desert menu ; all in all not bad but not great either.

Please dont eat there.I could have given a zero rating .But option is not available.

We went there today for lunch. We had lunch buffet worth Rs. 750 + Tax. Food was okay but the service was horrible. There were veg and non veg starters but they did not repeat the starters even after requesting them so many times. We had to call them repeatedly to ask for even a spoon or finger bowl. Main course was good. Dessert menu was good but it had no ice cream in it. Sweets and pastries were yummy.

We were so frustrated of waiting that we got up to get the forks, spoons and paper napkins for ourselves....the only thing left for us to do was to go to the ordering computer and order our own food!!!! 
The food wasn't as bad as the service but you have numerous choices in Kolkata which serve equally good or better food. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my family and friends.

I went for a Sunday Buffet Lunch @Jaisalmer along with my wife and my brother. The ambiance and the staffs were very friendly, but the menu disappointed me. The buffet, as usual, had 3 sections: Kebabs (which they server on table), Main Course and the Dessert. Of all these 3, the kebab section was awesome and I would recommend kebab lovers to visit or try Jaisalmer. But, the disappointment started from then onwards as the main course and the dessert section had not much variant and does not taste like paying for a 600 INR buffet and the Dessert was more pathetic as there were no ice cream on the menu.

I think Jaisalmer should work more on Main course and dessert, but I would still go there for the kebabs.

Best Wishes for Journey Ahead.

If I Say About Jaisalmer In A Line Then My Quote Wiil Be "Totally Wastage Of Money, Spoil Of Evening" In Buffet. We are visiting 4 of our family member today & find below my observation.

Price Rs. 830.00 (approx.) per plate but quality & variety of food not upto the mark. With lot of expectation I have visited there but very much disappointed. Had Visited Hervay-Kasba (same owner) 2 year back & food was really awesome. Recenty came to my friends that there also Mr. Walia Compromise The Quality Of Food.

Welcome drinks & Dessert was disgusting, In the name of prawn actually they served shrim (very small prawn).

Behaviour of staff was very unprofessional, At the time of reservation Behavior of staff was very rude. Service are very slow & service boys are not at all well mannered.

Felt probem in parking, not a single resto staff was there to guide/assist.

Still Sigree-Global Grill, Mainland China & Bar-B-Q Nation Is Still Better Choice.

Lastly It's not understood why the name is Jaisalmer, except some inner look nothing is there to quote the name.

Really wrost experience........

Located at the heart of sector 5 is the best part of jaisalmer . The ambience is good.But when it comes to service , I will rate it in minus. They made us sit for 50 minutes to serve our order.The food is overall very good and quite economical. But I will think twice before visiting next time because of the poor service.

I went there just the one time right during its early days. The overall look of the place is definitely attractive, and the food doesn't disappoint either. The buffet offers a lot of variety at the price it charges.

Service could have been a little better, but it was still early days and therefore can be overlooked.

Last Thursday we planned for a office party and after rounds of discussions we zeroed in for this restaurant. So calls were made and tables were booked for 14 people. Our ‚Äúscheduled‚Äù time was 1pm. Being punctual we arrived sharp at 1. Then onwards story started.

Welcome line ‚Äì ‚ÄúYou are supposed to come at 1:15 right? Then why‚Ä¶.‚Äù We politely said no we are supposed to com at 1 and as per your log it is also showing as 1p.m. Then one of the waiter ( I would say very rude) showed us a table. But unfortunately table was only for 10 (max 12). After saying this they told ‚Äúwe have to adjust‚Äù otherwise we have to take different tables in 3 different corners. His attitude was very bad and after calling manager, manager told that he did not take the booking so he cannot do anything. Now we were seriously surprised and annoyed. After few discussions they finally they gave us another table. UFFF.. at last.. by that time we lost all the interest‚Ä¶

Now let‚Äôs come to food (the main reason for going to a restaurant)  - We selected buffet, and they started with starters. There were all together 7-8 starters including few veg starters. Veg starters were really good but non-vegs were mostly average. Mutton was really bad.  Not sure why they were serving in real hurry.. most of the time we could not able matchup with their speed. They should at least give some time to eat the food. Main course were average.

Final thought for 550+ charges not at all value for money. Go at your own risk.

Never heard about this place until today when we missed lunch at Bar B Q Nation in sector 5, the first impression which you get when you enter this place is pure bliss! What an eye candy! The place and the decor is beyond beautiful. Jaisalmer occupies a huge space in the gigantic office building, naturally the expectations were a bit on the higher side. But we were supremely disappointed. 
For starters we ordered dahi kebabs- which were nice , chicken tikka kebab - very average and mutton Seekh kebab - disgusting! The mutton Seekh kebabs were hard and it was very much evident that the staff just warmed it from the buffet and didn't bother to make anything fresh. Very very bad starters. After that main course arrived ( quite late ) comprising of masala Kulchas garlic nun dal Makhani and keema matar. The food is just below average, even the masala kulcha mix was too salty. 
Staff seems a little bit strained and remains confused most of the time, though they tried to serve us properly. 
Even when I wasn't done eating, the waiter tried to take my plate away - which is a supremely irritating habit. 

It's such a pity that they invested in such amazing decor but forgot to hire a decent chef! With better food this place can reach amazing heights! 
For the time being I am quite disappointed. ??

We went for buffet where the price was ok... I loved the shawarma with pita bread... the biryani was nice... turn off : the chicken was not that tender... desert variety was limited...overall a good experience but not that good.

I have visited this place quite a few number of times, and each of them has given me a memorable time. Though I have to mention that I haven't yet tried the buffet menu. The prices are very reasonable in al-a-carte and all the dishes I have tried taste delicious. The first day I went there was at around 1030 on a Sunday night that too after a tiring day at office. This was the only restaurant which we found open then and voila, what a luck we had here.

The interior is awesome and so is the ambiance. One should definitely visit this place and, I would of course recommend, more than once!! ;)

P.S. As I stated earlier I haven't tried the buffet menu, I have heard some discouraging reviews about that from some of my peers.

Hope you have a great time.

Try out the Special Mutton Biryani - its almost sufficient for 2, Chciken Tandori,
Crispy fried chili chicken. Chicken fried wanton, Chicken Spring rolls, Shredded Lamb - This one is just great.

A special mention should be made of the stuff. They are really one of the best in the city. They will keep a watch on you in most subtle of ways that you'll never ever catch them staring at you, yet as soon as you would have an expression that you require something they will be at your table even before you can ask.

I don't know where to start with . guys if you want to waste your money then you should try this one.....
as per my opinion, my 3 course meals ,starting from starter to desert, really wasted ¬†at the day end. every time i hoped for the best but it got spoiled . service management is very bad. every time u have to direct then to clean your area or to do necessary stuffs

starting with lime soda . i tasted and it was like ¬†nimbu pani ¬†.tasted badly . road side lime water is far better than this.
next starter.. its better to give any feedback . chicken was not properly roasted . fish ..i beg to all of you, please don't try... what the crab!!!¬†
baby corn was nice . most importantly they served starter mostly consisted of potatoes. i taught all wholesaler supplied their so called potatoes to this place .

leave......
next its time for main course . dish table was not properly placed . too difficult to find the plates and also space is so much congested that every time u have to fight with others to get your dish

after such a bad experience i hope positive about my fav. part i.e desert . but frankly speaking my heart really broken after seeing all items . besides some Bengali sweets nothing is there to taste . limited option having poor garnishing and taste u can easily observed in desert

final verdict : if you want to try something new and crazy (total wasting of money) then you must go for it . for ambiance u should prefer this place for dinner not for lunch

Jaisalmer is located in sector 5 globsyn crystals beside KFC.The ambience is pretty good.For starters we ordered crispy chilly baby corn and vegetable spring roll.Though the service was a little late,the quality made up for the delay.Was more than satisfied with both the dishes.For main course we ordered Malaysian Flat Noodles, initially when it was served we found it little raw which was changed.The replacement that was brought was absolutely delicious..Jaisalmer serves us on both counts, firstly its pleasing to our taste buds also its not very injurious to our pockets as the rates are very acceptable..The only thing which should be improved is the attentiveness and frequency of the staff.

Before going to jaiselmer I heard pretty good reviews about it...but when I went there my opinion about this restaurant totally changes.ambience though good but the food totally disappointed me.Moreover the service added to the disaster. So my suggestion is a big No for jaiselmer.

Jaisalmer... What an experience...!!!!!
Starting with the decor its one of a kind.. beautifully lit with ample of space and elegantly furnished. We were seated in the PDR ( Personal Dinning Room ) which could accommodate eight people and had a tv.¬†
The buffet menu was huge for both veg and non veg. There chicken tikka, prawn tampura, dahi kabab and veg tandoori simple stole our hearts. ¬†In the main course chicken biryani, veg noodles and chiili chicken were mouth watering. the desserts were an excellent end to our lunch with varieties of pastries, firni and ice cream.
i would recommend this place to everyone. :)

The d√©cor of this attracted me more than any other place ever have. Sprawling over the right wing of globsyn, spacious n aesthetically designed jaisalmer will get your attention for sure. Went there with a friend. For a first timer a buffet seemed to be the best bet.
Their lunch buffet is 550+tax with 10% corporate discount. This was affordable. And the menu had a lot of variety. 
We were served fresh lime juice which was refreshing and the starters were served by them. Among all starters, we liked the schezwan prawn n chicken in peanut butter sauce. The fish was a let down as it had fishy smell n in kebabs it is not favorable. The veg starters are worth tasting n m sure the vegetarians will enjoy them. The main course again had a lot of variety. The dhania chicken was good, the biriyani was good. The Chinese items were about okayish. The fish was smelly again. For vegetarians they had a gala spread. They also have a no onion, no garlic palak paneek preparation in main course. 
The desserts didn't have much to offer. The assorted pastries were good but the Bengali sweets were not up to the mark.
I would visit again but for a-la-carte n their ambiance.

Went there for Project lunch from office on a sunny day...we were 46 people...booked the restaurant before.. And yes, their arrangements were good..that was a buffet lunch..6 veg and 6 non veg starters..chicken swarms,prawn and chicken kababs were great.. I found the veg starters like crispy chili French fries, veg pakora wrapped with sesame seeds and veg pakora wrapped with shemai, very tasty..nothing special in Main course..but the taste of "junglee ghosht" - a mutton recipe, was so delicious.. Dessert items are OK OK type..but it was very disappointing that,there was no ice cream in the dessert menu..it should be there..

Jaisalmer... I would like to start with table reservation; make calls, reserve a table, get into Jaisalmer Restaurant & oooopsss... Table not reserved...!!!
Alright, let's ignore that.
A hungry bunch of people went & placed ourselves there... Honestly, the place is good. It's traditional yet contemporary...
Food; I don't understand why the dishes took 45 minutes to reach our table... May be the food didn't want to get into our stomach... ? Well, after waiting & listening to the apologies for the same time & again, we finally got our dishes. We ordered for chicken biryani, pan fried fish chilli tangri kabab, mixed fried rice, devils chicken, lime soda and green apple mojito.
Biryani was really good, kababs wasn't cooked well, Pan fried chilli fish is a must try from Jaisalmer. Overall it was a good place to eat.
I visited Jaisalmer twice and I think I can give it a try again.
By the way the manager is a real nice guy. He apologized humbly & made up for it by treating us with complimentary desserts (black forest'& swiss lime pastries & some really nice kesari rosogulla). 
:)
Thank You

Located at Sector5 this place had a lot to offer, but alas we were totally upset when we were leaving this place all robbed. The place has got a prime location in Globsyn crystals but the prime attraction in a restaurant is its food which was badly missing here.. both in taste and quality... How can all the starters taste the same whether it be chicken or fish or gobi! Isn't that strange and that too a weird taste... so we realized in the very beginning that we were at the wrong place... in the main course ONLY chicken biriyani was good but why will I go to this place and empty my wallet for that biriyani, I would rather go to Aminia, Arsalan or maybe atleast Lazeez. The desserts were so so... Frankly speaking if you have been to FlamenGrill or BarBQ nation or Sigree you will seriously not like this place else things can turn out otherwise for you.

Located in sec v in electronics complex in globsyn building,5 mins walk from collage more,is a nice place to visit.
Was in a dilema before going as heard different reviews from aquaintances.But when I visited the place it was quite soothing with decent ambience.
Coming to the food- we ordered tandoori alu and dahi k kabab in starters.
Tandoori alu was mouthwatering but dahi k kabab could have been better.
For the main course - we had dal makhani,jhaal farezi sabji,masala kulcha,jeera pulao.
All the food was perfect with the apt blend of spices.specially kulcha stuffing was too good.
Quantity was good enough and prices were reasonably affordale.
Call bell system on each table is quite innovative...so that u dont need to call the waiter.jst press the bell and the waiter is there to serve you...nice concept infact.
Recomended: try once.

I think we can order something different every day and never have the same meal twice. And the courteous delivery people will be at your door with hot food in hand.
It was nice experience over all in Jaisalmer.

After a lot off searching for a good restaurant nearby RDB, decided to go for jaisalmer, situated in the globsyn crystal building. The glass panel and fancy decor is the first thing that catches your eye.The ambience is nice and the 3 big ass LED Tvs never let you get bored as you wait for food. The menu consists of Pan Asian dishes. First off, we ordered the lasuni kabab as a starter. After a delay of 10-15 minutes, we had the nice, soft, juicy kababs on the table. Then we decided to go for butter nan, paneer kulcha and chicken ra ra punjabi(yes... that is the name). the paneer kulcha was simply out of this world and the chicken was also very nice. the butter nan was... well... like a normal butter nan. But what bothered me was the sheer unavailability of desserts. We tried ordering Darshan and then Walnut Toffee but the only available option was gulab jamun. The bill for two came upto approximately 600.All in all, a nice experience, good food at a reasonable price. If you are willing to take a risk with your dessert and can put up with an over enthusiastic waiter... you should surely give Jaisalmer a try.

Vegetarian + non-alcoholic

The place packs a fantastic atmosphere with unique decors and prompt service. The buffet costs around 700 (with taxes)  and as a vegetarian I don't think it's worth it unless you're eating alone.
There's a nice variety of starters but I would recommend the grills. This isn't the classy grill stuff but the food tastes good.
I am not a big fan of lentils but their Special butter dal tarka indeed tickled my taste buds. It's strongly recommended with their tandoori roti. I visited it back to back days for dal-roti.
If you order from the menu you can have a decent 3 course meal under 800 for 2.

Jaisalmer is located in sector 5 next to KFC. Its a multi-cuisine North Indian and Pan Asian restaurant. Pls don't get confused by the name since you won't find anything remotely related to Jaisalmer or even Rajasthan. Interiors and decor are very nice with large LEDs perfect for sports lovers.  They have private dining area on the first floor but the 1st floor was completely vacant probably cos of weekday. From outside this place gives you a feel of fine dinning restaurant but it's not so once you are inside. We were quite full that's why decided to go directly with main course. Ordered Sweet lime soda which came without the sweetener. Dal Makhani, Kulchas and Rotis were very average. Schezwan fried rice was good and so was veg manchurian. Service is okay. Portions are quite big and prices are very reasonable. Good option for small get together with friends and family.

A few weeks back, I with my some office colleagues decided to go there. We went for buffet lunch.  The ambience was good but the food was not as good as we thought. Most disgusting thing was they are not able to give 7 glasses (as we were total 7 persons). We tell them again and again and finally they manage to produce them.

Now the starter came after almost 30 minutes of wait. Many of them was badly smelled and half baked. Main course is OK. Taste was fine. But most of the desert dishes are empty. We call the manager and tell him the whole story and want 20% discount over the bill. He denied. Then we call the owner and he gave that discount. Phew... :(

At least we are not going there AGAIN..!

Having heard mixed reviews of the place from aquaintances I finally went in for a dinner buffet a few weeks back. It is located inside the globsyn building sector 5 saltlake and though not a frequent visitor their I found it quite easy to locate . Needless to say I was taken by the sprawling pastelly d√©cor . However,they were offering tables only downstairs as they had a party going on on the top floor which I found somewhat more appealing . They even have small enclosures accommodating 6-8 people for small private parties/meetings.  Food was good especially their kebabs and desserts (I almost skipped the main course)- the buffet spreas is lavish and do not miss out on yummy tarts . Staffs were cordial and the pocket pinch was decent as well . Good place for a wholesome buffet ÔÅä

Went in this place searching for cheap buffet on a Sunday evening. And I must say, so impressed I was that I had to taste the buffet again within the course of a month.

The place has a nice ambiance with courteous waiters. The variety of the starters bowled me over. It had starters of both veg and non veg variety. Not to mention the yum taste. While the main course was quite decent the desserts left a lot to be desired. NO ICE CREAM!!
But inspite a real nice place to soothe your taste buds without burning a hole in your pocket!

After shortlisting a few restaurant in Saltlake Sec V, me along with a few office colleagues decided to order Biriyani from this restaurant. The delivery was done with 40 minutes which is worth appreciating. The Biriyani which we order however was awful and I would say that this is probably the worst Biriyani I ever had. They take approximately Rs 200 (including taxes and other charges) for a plate which is not at all worth the amount. I would suggest to order from Jaffer Afgani or even Biriyani Express instead. Both of them are much better than Jaisalmir.

After hearing a lot about these places decided to visit this place on a weekday for lunch with a friend... There Buffet platter really has a variety of food. The Starters were really good. The price i also right on the button.. But one thing that is disappointing is the behavior of the manager... Being located in Sector V the place sees a number of IT Companies having their team lunch there.. And the day i visited was one such day when two teams from two IT companies of repute visited the place for ¬†team lunch.. ¬†The manager probably in his constant endeavor to keep the steady flow of techie clients intact was trying very hard to keep them satisfied.. So he constantly kept the waiters constantly engaged with them... But what was really annoying is that whenever any waiter was coming near our tables to serve any of the starters he was constantly shooing them away.. and asking them to move towards those tables..This did not happen once but every time we were trying to ask for the starters... At first we though it was due to the fact that we were only two compared to the huge 10-15 member team of theirs... But then we realised that the 2-3 member lunch teams did not get the same treatment.. Then it struck that most of them had their ID badges hanging from their necks.. Although we both work for IT companies of some repute we were not flashing our badges.... And then as soon as we kept our fly badges on our table the behavior of the ¬†manager changed.. All the waiters could freely come to our table with out the managers flak... On the contrary the manager himself came and started asking if we need anything more.. The waiters were not discriminating but I really do not know why the Manager has such a mentallity.. I would have given a 4 for the food they served but the attitude did not allow me to ... So my suggestion if you DO NOT HAVE A FLY BADGE TO FLASH NEVER EVER VISIT THIS PLACE..!!!¬†

P.S.: My team from ¬†my IT company is never going for any team lunch/dinner there if I can help it... !!!

This place was on my wish list from a long time and i finally went there today
The ambience was very nice the food here is also very reasonable but the service and the hospitality was disgusting 
First we had to wait for about half an hour to get a table as the place was crowded then when we got a place to sit we were asked to move downstairs as they only serve buffet upstairs
The table which was given to us downstairs was shaking and it was way to small and more like a coffee table
We waited for more than 15 minutes but no one came to take the order or even bothered to give us the menu card
Because of so much delay we left without having lunch
Its a very poorly managed restaurant i ll never visit that place again

The rating is NOT for food. Food is aw-sum . The rating is for the billing system. Food was delivered to our office which was quite fast. But the billing system is completely messed up. Bill showed Table # P2 & P3 where as it was delivered to office. 
They charge Vat and service tax on the containers. 
For delivery only Vat is suppose to be charged but they also charged ST.

On 21/2/'15. I visited with my wife for Lunch. What a Grand place it is! 1st. Floor is very attractive & u feel the grand- spacious feelings. 
       My wife preferred Veg. Buffet. I was for A la Carte, non-Veg. I ordered Mutton Sahi Korma, plain curd ,Butter Nan & Irani Fish Tikka Kabab. 
        Oho...Ho ... Irani fish Tikka Kabab was simply s u p e r b! Even my wife said great taste. No Fish Lover should miss it. Mutton was awesome! I loved it. Veg Kabab was best. Other veg items were extremely delicious. Ordered Dessert, Firni B'coz  kesar kulfi was in menu, but N.A. The Firni was not traditional one, but very tasty & wife enjoyed Gajar Ka Halua. 
         Service was very very good. Waiters helped us lot to shared their opinions, that was very helpful. As a whole, we've enjoyed a hearty Lunch.

By going through the reviews, I visited this place last week for a team lunch. We were a team of around 25+ people and hence opted for buffet. To start off, this place has really got an architechtural beauty, the decor and interior has added a traditional elegance to its ambience. In starters there were 12 different items which consists both pan asian and regional delicacies. Starters will be served hot to your table and it would fill up 80% of your appetite. I was so very engrossed in having those that I really dont remember the names :)

The main course had also 8-10 different delicacies. Mostly, the staffs were very gentle and gracious and would thank them for their equanimity specially Mr. Das. It was overall a nice experience and I would  undoubtedly plan my next visit soon.

Jaisalmer is located inside Globsyn Building at Salt Lake Electronics Complex at Sector V and after going through a bunch of positive comments we decided to drop in here on 21.2.15.. 

This place has a classy and elegant decor both from outside and inside,although the name suggests there is very little Rajasthani touch to this place.. From outside it will make a great impression and after you are greeted in this place will top itself with its light colored walls and its classy decor.. There are two floors and we were seated in the bottom floor as the top floor was not operating at that moment. After ordering the starters we went for a trip on the second floor and to be honest this is one of the best restaurants in Kolkata in terms or Decor n Ambience.. 
Light yellow color is spilled on every nook and corner of this resturant with a pinch of Green, Red N Brown color..
Tables for couples were more of coffee tables rather than dinner tables, small and round and you have to carefully move your hands or you will end up knocking down something..

We were then handed with the menus and they were a mix of North Indian and Chinese Items, in which more than half of the items were unavailable and we can only order from the items which are found in buffet. So heres my concern when you lay down tables for both buffet and A La Carte you should make an effort to avail all the items on your menu and not just for buffet only.. 

We started with Talu Mein Soup (N.V), this dish was prepared with shredded boiled ki chicken mix with some vegetables and boiled noodles,a great dish to start your dinner which is neither too spicy nor too hot. We then ordered Mushroom Tomato Veg Fried Rice and Shredded Chili Garlic Chicken and after roughly 7-8 minutes we were served both of them. It was deliciously prepared but lacked a bit of salt on both of the dishes and halfway through my rice i found a small fly on my plate. It was then replaced with simple Veg Rice. Now this is something where the Manager should take a proper notice,when you invest so much into the decor you should take an equal amount of measures to retain the goodwill among your customers, the staff took away my plate which was half filled with Mushroom Tomato Fried Rice n Shredded garlic Chili Chicken but came back with just Veg Rice N No Chicken which means i paid half of my money for an item which i never got to taste, so here is my question to the manager, IS THIS THE RIGHT WAY TO TREAT YOUR CUSTOMERS AND MAINTAIN YOUR GOODWILL?? I AM WAITING FOR A REPLY FROM THE MANAGEMENT ABOUT THIS.
So i had to order an extra plate Shredded Chili Garlic Chicken to fill my apetite.. 


The Staffs were courteous and was there to cater in every possible way

Price is reasonable, a healthy meal would cost around 500-600(including taxes) for a couple

So to conclude - - 
PROS--
AMBIENCE N DECOR
Price
Quality and quantity of food

CONS--
Bluffing your customers is a huge point on the negative side. 

My overall experience was mixed with both good and bad points at this place but i would definitely give this place another visit and within that time i think i will get a response from the manager about the inconvenience i faced.. 

The ratings which i gave was solely based on the elegant decor and quality of the food.

One of the best restaurants that i ever visited...when it comes to comparison with places like mainland china or oh calcutta in terms of ambience,i feel jaisalmer really tops the charts. Located in sector 5,salt lake in globsyn crystals building..this place isn't difficult to locate. This place looks amazing from outside as well as inside. From outside only 40% of the inside of this restaurant can be seen. This was my 2nd visit to this place considering my first visit didn't end up well as we couldn't get a table for ourselves since it was valentines day and couples from all over really queued this place up. Today was my 2nd visit here and fortunately there wasn't a rush today n we seated ourselves comfortably. Everything about this place impressed me starting from ambience,service to food everything though i have a list of complaints which will be stated later in my review. The place consists of 2 floors,we were seated on the first floor..a table away from the entrance. The chairs reminded me of old rajasthani traditional chairs though a bit updated. The long bar was adjacent to the seating arrangements. Glass windows made it a point for people to look through and enjoy the awesome scenario of globsyn crystals and its surroundings while dipping into their whole hearted mouth watering preparations. We went to the 2nd floor with the intention of using the washroom and took a walk throughout the restaurant once and found that it really was a big area,though they said that the 2nd floor can't be used for seating today. 2 lcd televisions accompanied people for having their food while watching the cricket match. Now,coming to food,we ordered 1 talumein soup,1 plate tomato mushroom fried rice and 1 plate chilli garlic shredded chicken. Though we were a bit disappointed with the menu because most of their items wasn't available,still we managed somehow with the traditional ones. They had a separate card for buffet and said that only buffet items were available today. If that was meant to be the case then i think for today they should have announced that only buffet was available and not a la carte,but when they have given us the menu card in hand then they should have made it a point that the unusual items was available since people tend to be attracted to the not-so-easily available items. Anyway,the taste of the food really won my heart,specially the soup. The noodles in the soup along with chicken and veggies was a perfecto. Now here lies my complaints..when we were having the main course items,he found a fly in his plate!! We immedietly complained. .they we apologetic and took away his plate and prepared us a new plate of fried rice..though it wasn't the tomato mushroom rice but the regular vegetable fried rice...but he did not get his portion of the side dish chicken back. We found flies and insects flying across the hallway and 1 dropped in my spoon even. They should really look into this matter or else for a small cause like this big hygiene issues will start piling up. Staff was also good and was ready to help any second,though they are not at all thorough with the menu,most of them don't even know which preparation is available and which is not and which dish is prepared how,but still were very helpful. With a bill of around 600rs in a place like this..i really enjoyed jaisalmer leaving behind the few cons here. Definitely visiting again...next time for the north indian items!

Refreshing interiors! - that's the first thing one would notice on walking into this place. This place has all the works to be the first sports bar in Kolkata. Its got¬† bigass TVs, the perfect ambience with a peep into the outsides, well lit comfy seating areas, along with a projector etc. Cover is huge and its even got a upper tier which is defunct now. The food is okay and price is just ok. My friends and I had a hearty dinner, a-la-carte style....and it all came down to 1188INR. The spread was lavish - a chicken tandoori half, several naans(garlic and all), many rotis and mushroom fries, veg jhalfrezi and some non veg items along with nalen gurer rasogolla.
everything tasted ok. Only downside perhaps was the waiting time for the food. Who waits for 20 minutes after finishing the starters to lay their hands on the main course? Damn! I could have made something myself in that time :P It was a buffet prime time and we were left out, I guess.¬† Overall a good place for a nice eating experience. If the management is reading this, please do something about the sports bar stuff. it will work here.

Jaisalmer is the new buzz in Sector V and so was planning to visit the place for a long time and so as today there was not much work in office so thought of giving this place a visit. So me and my friends went to this place and as we entered we were welcomed by the restaurant staffs and were shown a table to sit. The place is well decorated,spacious and well lit making it perfect to click good pictures. We were given the menu card and after a lot of discussion we ordered the following dishes-

Soup- Chicken Manchow Soup
Though I am not that much fond of soups but due to the constant pestering of my friend had to order it. But I must say though I am not fond but still I loved it.
Starter- Barbeque Chicken
Next came Barbeque Chicken nice soft little spicier chicken. Loved it also 
Main Course- Butter Chicken Masala and Lucknowi Handi with Butter Roti
Next came the rotis and the side dishes. At first we ordered only the rotis and Butter Chicken Masala but then we wanted some more so came in Lucknowi Handi. And we loved both the gravy chicken items.

So overall our first experience at Jaisalmer was really good and looking forward to try their buffet in near future

It's a headache to go out with veggies when you are a strictly non veggie person . After the full kickass movie BABY we wanted to have dinner which ought to be a full vegetarian meal .
The nearest was Jaisalmer . The decor and ambience isn't much "Rajasthani" but yes it's very welcoming. The quality of the food is worth praising !! 8 of us ate till we were full but the bill was only around 2k.
I will give +1 just for their staff . They were very friendly yet very professional.

We are planning to have another dinner very soon at jaisalmer :)

----------------------------------------------------------------

I was so impressed with food and the ambience of Jaisalmer that when my project manager decided to take the team out for the lunch, I suggested her the same.
This time I decided to have nonveg!! Ordered paneer pulao with chicken rarra! Paneer pulao was really good but the chicken rarra was mamamiaaaa!!!! 

---------------------------------------------------------

Ok so now this is my 3rd visit... Most of the staff know me now my by face!! 
This time was the farewell dinner of a colleague of mine... We had Chicken bharta and tandori roti for main course  But the true winner was the lip smacking Drums Of Heaven!! 
It's time I try some new restaurants too :p
But Jaisalmer is like a food heaven for me now!

After reading some of the reviews..without any hesitation decide and went away for filling my stomach to Jaisalmir.it's in the Globsyn crystal building.from the outside it's looks like small but from the inside it's quite big.first impression it's good.bar counter in the main entrance.glassy wall's allow you to eat n enjoy the outside view together.in the background soothing music.interiors,ambience just perfect.

Their service very very good.stuffs are very attaintative and polite.this is one of the best part.i had non-veg buffet with complimentary drink.first starters lots of varieties from chicken to prawn fish to mutton,and they have some very good veg starter too.they offered me but I was very happy with my non-veg starters.i can't remember all the name.prawn,chicken hariyali kabab,mutton kabab and chicken with onion fixed something are the best.very very soft n taste wise too good.after that i was too full.but still anyhow I managed some place inside my tummy..then had chicken biriyani,chilli chicken with noodles.because there is not much space inside I can't able to try other foods.biriyani taste wise good,cooked well with a awesome smell.chilli chicken and noodles is ok.dessert part I had too many of them.being a bong i can't live n leave sweets.i had gulap jamun,pineapple cake,strawberry cake,yellow color rosogolla,choco cake too.overall it's a good experience and I will definetly visit again for the main foods.happy happy eating..

I and one of my close friend decided to try out Jaisalmer one evening. It was an instant decision, the results of which didn't live up to my expectations. The ambience is good with lots of space, and the crowd is also relatively less than Barbeque Nation, but it is the food that left me most disappointed. They have lots of items, but the quality of cooking is not that good. The starter items were undercooked and tasted the same. The main coarse included Chinese as well as Indian dishes. All in all not recommended because of the mediocre food items.

Jaisalmer in Sector V is actually a tough competitor to Barbeque Nation. While I am tired of food at Barbeque Nation, Jaisalmer is novelty and the food is good if not great. What makes the experience even better is the lovely ambiance and helpful staff. The Restaurant is ran by¬† the same people who run the Harvey's in Kasba. While, the food at Harvey's is definitely better, I like the warm, cosy interiors of Jaisalmer more. But the food quality is amazing at both the places. 
Priceiwse, the place is okay. The Buffet spread is lavish and the amount of starters served justify the price. 
Must try Dahi Kebabs, Dal Makhani and Mud Pie. Since I am a vegetarian, cant say much about the non veg menu, but people i go out with, seem to Love the Mutton¬† starters and Adrak something Chicken starter.

Mid January 2015.

Food is gud. Tasty. Pricing moderately high. Brightly lighted environment. Have private rooms for groups too-->One on 1st floor is better, but was closed when we went. 

Service: LAX, SLOW, make many many many mistakes--> got wrong things, changed, 'again' got wrong and changed again. Shud not happen. But behaviour is ok.

Parking on road convenient, and building is nice too. 

Else foodwise gud. 

Shall recommend, just gotta bear with the service a bit. 

Thanx.

Jaisalmer is located on the ground floor of Globsyn building @ Sector 5 , Salt Lake.

Heard good feedback and wanted to check out the lunch buffet on a Wednesday.

Ample space , nice d√©cor , but , food was very mediocre !

Starters were undercooked except the prawn tempura. Hara-Bhara kabab , Dahi kabab , roasted cauliflower and corn and peas fried in veg. While , Teriyaki Chicken , Honey Chicken , Schwarma Chicken , Fried Fish , Mutton Seena and Prawn Tempura in non-veg. Sounds fantastice , but , only on paper. Chicken starters were undercooked.

For main course, the buffet spread was huge ! They had Chinese and Indian both.

Bread Basket (Naan and Lachcha Paratha) were served on the table.  Fish , Chicken and Mutton were in the indian spread , while the Chinese spread had chicken and fish.

The dessert section had , baked mihidana , 2 varieties of rasogolla , tarts and pastries.

All in all , a huge buffet spread with very mediocre skills.

Not recommended !

We had a mushroom dish and berbeque chicken as side dish..the berbecue chicken was not crispy..and kind of rubbery.! Very bad in taste..we the foodies..had to waste the chicken and the noodles..!!

Visited this restaurant on a Saturday night with high expectations, as some serious foodies had high regards of the place. Thankfully, wasn't disappointed. First impressions are of course formed on the basis of ambience and in this respect, Jaisalmer tries to pull out all the stops; from the speakers blaring music to the glass wall kitchen exposed to the world to the magnificent interiors, they give a royal feel. When it comes to food, being a fan of Punjabi cuisine, i believe you can never go wrong with butter chicken, and my theory was proved right here again. Butter rotis, with the butter literally dripping off of them, worked surprisingly well with the a chinese dish consisting of 3 types of mushrooms dipped in a schezwan sauce. Not being an expert on any cuisine, in my humble opinion, Jaisalmer had a delicious spread and lacked in neither ambience nor hospitality.No complaints.

Visited here last week for a team lunch...very nice decor, and comfortable sitting arrangements.....a lot of dishes avaiable for the buffet, starters,main course and desserts...also not too costly...but the waiters are a little rude and non reluctant..management must put some vision over here...

A great experience overall..

Editing this review...yesterday we visited again, and faced the worst service ever faced in any of the great buffet restaurants visited so far...the starters decreased significantly in numbers, I joined late, so was not served a few of the starters, and for the rest, had to ask again and again...one of my teammates tried to talk to the manager regarding such nuisance and the manager started speaking rudely to him as if we were employees, not guests of this establishment...the welcome drink tasted like ORS solution for me, although my colleagues who joined early said their drinks were fine...desserts were average,choco mud pie vanished which was one of my favourite items, main course was not too tasty, but the waiter and the management behavior stays the winner..I would dare to visit this place again. I am keeping my old review above just to showcase how much degradation this place has experienced....

visited jaisalmer on this xmas for an indian lunch.  well,  the decor i must say is quite mesmerising with an outdoor waiting area all laid in white. the huge glass panes gives a beautiful view of the greeneries outside. 
our starter CHICKEN KHUSHNAWA KEBABs were just perfect. chicken thigh pieces stuffed with cheese and cashews dipped in the green chutney was pure heaven in mouth. 
next in maincourse the MUTTON RARA with GARLIC NAAN and CHEESE NAAN was an awesome combinaton again.  the mutton dish had 4 chunks of soft meat and the gravy was fingerlicking good. the introductory prices made the meal very pocket friendly. 
the service time was however long.
they offered us a complementary GAJAR KA HALWA. 
now the main cons is the attitude of their waiters. simply etiquetteless. They are more busy in shouting among themselves rather than catering the customers which spoils the ambience. this was not a problem due to  a special day rush as we entered for a late lunch when they were over with the buffet and place was nearly empty.  a waiter loudly asked the other " ekhon to dessert hobe na, buffet te ja bencheche,  cheche puche diye de" n came to us asking "apnader ki complimentary dessert debo? " ridiculous!! 
the chefs know their job,  while the waiters don't!

Finally Barbeque Nation has a competitor and it's good enough to give Barbeque Nation a run for it's money.
The concept is like Barbeque Nation, but this restaurant doesn't place the grill in table. They serve you the kebabs directly.
They serve both veg and non veg kebabs. Amongst the veg starters, the Paneer Tikka kebab and the Aloo kebab are delicious. In the non veg starters they served both Indian and Chinese. The fish kebab is really good and way better than the fish kebab Barbeque nation serves (Barbeque Nation doesn't serve Bengal Bekti. They serve Basa which doesn't taste as good as Bengal Bekti). The mutton kebab(made with goat Ribs) and Barbeque Chicken(a chinese preparation) were really good. They served almost 12 varieties of starters.
The main course included 2 types of paneer preparations, a dal, mutton roganjosh (the best main course item), chicken curry, plain rice, and a lot more which I didn't try. We also ordered butter naan.
The dessert section was undoubtedly the best and it scored a 5 on 5. The Baked Mihidana and Mudpie were outstanding. The hot gulab jamuns, gurer roshogolla, komola bhog, mini black forest cake, mini brownie were also delicious. However, I didn't find ice cream in the dessert section. They do have a big dessert section but still they can add at least one flavour of ice cream.
A complimentary welcome drink was also offered.
Overall good ambiance, great food, great service. This one's as good or even better than my previous personal favourite, Barbeque Nation. Well done :)

I visited this restaurant for a team lunch. The first impression of this restaurant is that of light and splendor. The entrance especially made a mark on me with the sunlight streaming in. I would give it 5/5 for the ambience. Coming to the task at hand: the food. We tried the buffet; and the first thing that struck me was the lack of Rajasthan in the menu. I mean there must be something right? Why else would you name a restaurant "Jaisalmer". Anyway the starters were at best average. Although I would give full marks for variety. Special mention for the Chicken Mongolian and Chicken Shawarma is to be made. They stood out among starters. The drinks menu was sparse at best. They need to seriously improve there. Personally I found the vegetarian fare here appalling. It was not up to the mark at all. The main course again was average, with only the soup standing out. Coming to the dessert; it is here that Jaisalmer shines. The desserts were very good. Be it the Mahidani, the chocolate tobcerone or the lemon tart; each was as good as the next. The staff behaviour was good and they were trying hard to please, but one could see that they were raw and still needed to polish themselves significantly. Overall I would say that its a one time visit restaurant with exquisite ambience and average food.

I loved the food here. We took the buffet menu. The starters were tasty. There was a mutton starter..It was awesome. As usual we didn't give the main course too much touch and concentrated on the starters and desserts. Both were awesome. The ambiance too is good. I hope they keep up with the quality and this cost. I hope to visit Jaisalmer again.

When it comes to non veg khana pina I prefer Jaisalmer, the wormth of the place is truly indescribable. And the menu with whopping details of various delicious food items is even more wormer. I love the whole atmosphere there and the servicing. They probably have all the items you can imagine. Be it chicken tandoor, chicken tikka kebab, mutton pasinda to tandoori pomfret, tandoori prqwn, mutton shaho korma, chicken curry, chicken kassa, chicken reshmi masala and what not. But I whenever I am there I like to relish something different such as chicken onion kebab, corn palak, sometimes butter roti which we normally don‚Äôt get anywhere. But I simply love their keema matar and their egg curry. All these dishes have their own taste distinctly. These moghlai dishes are quite popular in Bengali platter, but at the end we always need something sweet to satisfy my cravings for sweets. And here I have special weakness for their firni, gulab janmun, rabri. I believe that any sweets complete the whole meal after having a heavy meal. Also I like to have raita and the restaurant has raita items such as dahi mixed raita, pineapple raita, bundi raita, wll are equally satisfying.

First of all the place is huge,  with king sized sofa chairs and good decor. Loved it. 
The manager was very friendly,  gave us a detailed description of each dish to be ordered and chef specials.
Tried adrak ke panje, which exceeded my expectations.  The aroma.and flavours wr jst rich enough
Also had bbq chicken starter. It was good too. 
They had buffets as well, bt we chose to stick to ala carte as we ddnt hv the mood to exploit our apetite. 
The prices are pretty reasonable.  
I'm sure, I'll visit it again.

Visited the place last Sunday.. Due to rush they gave us a table which was rather small for 4 people and the management didn't seem concerned about the problem! Other than that, the place was descent with a good ambience.. The food was really good specially the Dal Makhani. However the Cheese Naan was a let down! The pricing is actually decent compared to similar North Indian restaurants!!

The food was extremely bad. There was no spices or flavors in the dishes. The starters in particular was missing salt and were completely bland. the only good items were the Boiled vegetables and the steamed rice. Maybe because there were no spice involved in it. Schezwan fish tasted like a sweet syrup, the cauliflower was burnt instead of grilled, yellow dal was tasteless and noodles were half cooked. suggesting everyone not to go for the buffet and if you ever reach there by mistake, order lal maas and steamed rice in ala carte.

My first time, so I just hope my views towards Jaisalmer changes for better in time to come! As of now I rate it as a 3 - neither so bad nor as good as b b q Nation! 
Today at lunch I tried the buffet which comes in around 600 rupees with tax, having some corporate discount in place! 
Look and feel, Decor are quite impressive. Service is also good! 
Coming to the food - for nov veg - they had plenty of starts ranging from chickn to fish to mutton to prawns! But i did not find the tastes at par with foods served in the other buffet giants of the city! Only the one with mutton was something I really liked! Again a bad day for the veg people, starters ruined their moods and taste buds. 
Main courses were modest for nov vegs with varieties of indian and Chinese foods! 
Worth to mention - veg dal fry and matar paneer were something quite tasty!
Desserts were okay with quite a few choices! But we did not find ice creams, only empty ice cream bowls were found by the side of the serving table!
Anyway, i have got real good reviews of Jaisalmir for ala-carte and so I look forward to it! Will review soon for the ala-carte!

Our visit to Jaisalmer happened on my cousin's birthday treat, with the whole family in for their buffet lunch.
It was pretty easy to locate (a thumbs-up to Zomato and GoogleMaps), and it wasn't really crowded on the early Sunday afternoon.

The buffet began with a complimentary soft drink and chicken hot&sour soup, followed by a HUGE line of kebabs served to us in quick succession. In fact, after a certain point we were wondering whether we would be able to make it to the main course (leave alone the desserts) !
Among them, the shawarma chicken was heavenly. We also loved the tangy feel of Chicken in Teriyaki Sauce, as well as the lipsmacking Adrakhi Mutton. We had a Spinach Pancake as well, which tasted nice.  The only thing I didn't like was the Fish in Coriander Sauce (fried) : it had a repelling smell (even in my subsequent visits) .
UPDATE : Later we had the buffet again for dinner. Almost all of the starters were spicy. The chicken, baby corn and potato fritters seemed way too similar in taste. The starters were a letdown in the second visit, hence the rating has been brought down from 4.5 to 3.5.

I didn't dare venture much into the main course menu, except trying the Chicken Biryani (extremely dry biryani, but hits the mark by its taste) and Fish in Lemon Coconut Sauce (something new and liked by my tastebuds). The mutton was very good.

I was waiting for the dessert platter. Having an overfunctioning sweet tooth, I was drooling and going crazy.
The gulab jamuns, baked mihidana, death by chocolate, chocolate cake, brownies, tarts - everything added to the 'thrill'. The baked mihidana was to die for. We loved every one of the desserts.

The ambiance was simple and quite soothing, combined with efficient hospitality. Then at the buffet lunch, we got a nice spread. The entire pocket-pinch was pretty much worth it.
Worth trying out! :)

visited d place few months back with office colleague after its opening as it is very close 2 my office.situated in heart of sector5 i think its one of d cheapest food place. Ambience was ok,food was ¬†good ,chicken labbabder was very tasty.all veg & non-veg starter was good ,the partathas in main course was very nice but i didnt lyk the chicken rara pangabi as d chicken was stiff.we ordered fresh lime soda as drink which was very refershing.overall experience is good.
My revised review on 3rd visit 
2 week back visited ,they provide a rice dish with corn which is not eatable it was fermented it was groose 
They don't deserved 1st star

Visited Jaisalmer for the first time and had amazing experience. ¬†Guys, it's not a Rajasthani/vegetarian restaurant. ¬†It's a full fledged multi cuisine restaurant. ¬†

We tried out the lunch buffet on a weekday. The pan asian cuisine was moderate in taste. ¬†However, the Indian cuisine was awesome. ¬†The flow of starters were great, the kebabs were super tasty. ¬†Each had it's very own flavour and taste, very distinct from the other. The mutton kebab is definitely worth that extra applaud! ¬†The waiters were super friendly and helpful as well. ¬†They seemed eager to make our experience the best, so that we enjoy every bit. The naan/tandoori roti were served hot every time and replenished at regular intervals. ¬†The ambiance was lovely, enough seating space, felt comfortable. ¬†I would recommend everyone to go there and check this place out. It's a different kind of taste. ¬†So enjoy!!!

Easily below par Kolkata standards in Casual Dining. The space they posses is huge but the decor is as confusing as the menu and service staff. We had visited with an eighteen member team, which it seemed brought them to their wits end. Going by the name we went for North Indian Cuisine. The starters were either bland or tastelessly spicy. Biting into the main course; we found ourselves confused between Naan and Kulcha which made us wonder if the cook was lousy enough with the dough. The Chicken and Mutton dishes were equally pedestrian only adding to the hullabaloo. The mutton gravy with superfluous tomatoes deserves a special mention in their spread (sarcasm intended, if you like). Next we had our encounter with the most stinking and stale Biryani we had ever stuffed into our mouths. The potato they had put in it smelled as though straight out of yesterday's leftovers. At long last, our gluttony had died a painful death by the time our dessert in the form of Cherry-sized Gulab Jamuns had arrived.
The experience though terrible was easy on pocket, which I guess is the only savior at a place like this. A big no-no if you wish to have a memorable Dining experience.

"Jaisalmer", the name would insist you to try out the place. You would be surprised by their menu. You would go thinking it is a Rajasthani restaurant, but they actually serve Indian, Chinese and so on, nothing close to Rajasthani food. Disappointment!
Next, the decor is brilliant. The colors are fantastic. Food wise, their quantity is super. Taste wise also, they are okay.

We visited Jaisalmer again, to try their Summer Combos. The plate consists of fried fish, and two variants of kebab. Some spiced onion, and a sauce to go with it! We also tried their chicken biriyani and their brilliant mocktails! Such pretty colors, perfect for the heat.

Awesome is the word if I need to describe the overall experience in one word. The food was very good and they were being served hot. We opted for Dinner Buffet and the first thing that struck us was the variety of starters. Absolute delight for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. Main course was average and dessert was too good(specially the 'Baked Mihidana').
Ambiance was quite apt too. The overall hospitality was also very good.
Very much value for money, and IMO the best Buffet I had in Salt lake area(yes, I have tried them all :) ).
Keep up the good work fellas..!!! Absolute treat.

P.S. : Do not get confused over the name. They do serve all kind of Continental as well as Indian dishes(not only Rajasthani foods).

Jaisalmer, the name caught my attention and I thought it might be serving Rajasthani food but that was not the case.
The first which catches ur eye if u go to Jaisalmer is the open kitchen and then the decor which is a nice mix of the old heritage and modern interior designing.
Now about the food, it was really really delicious.  Had the mutton galouti kabab and its a must try, minced meat grilled to perfection and it just melts the moment u put it into ur mouth with an explosion of flavours. For the main course we had the most trusted Dal Makhani, along with it Shahi Paneer and Chicken Lababdar. All the dishes were tasty but Chicken Lababdar was something new to my palate and I enjoyed it throughly. And pricewise its quite reasonable. Will definitely visit again.

Located in the lane just opposite to bakstage,Jaisalmer gives a new taste to all the foodies..
Unlike its name 'jaisalmer',there is nothing similar about it except for few scenaries of Rajasthan streets in the first floor..
Now coming to its ambience..it deserves a full mark..ambience is really outstanding..this place serves both buffet and ala carte..i have been here twice and went on with the buffet..
Buffet spread has real good varieties of food in all three sections i.e,starters,main course and dessert..among the starters the crispy prawns and fish are good..from the main course the burnt hot garlic nooodles,manchurian,biryani and murgh kali mirch are the stuffs i liked..the mudpie has always been on my first list undoubtedly from desserts...
A nice experience..a must try for all..:)

Unlikely this is more of a mughalai resto then the name suggests a spirit of Rajasthan. 
The food mainly they serve is non veg against the essence of jaisalmer. Though the food is good and deserts are decent price is fine.. But it sounds kind of misleading to people who visit the place without checking on its menu and gets pissed after knowing they serve non veg with the name of jaisalmer.. No offence but it's a Lil awkward.

First of all I would like to say that the restaurant could have been more clean.Do not sit near the entrance as there are a lot of mosquitoes there.Coming to the theme and decor I would like to ask them ,why the name "jaisalmer".There is no element of jaisalmer there.Neither the food nor the look,nothing explains the name "jaisalmer".Coming to the starters we ordered the Veg Galouti kebab .It wasnt warm and the flavours left a lot to be desired.In the main course we had the daal makhani and the veg jhaal frezi.
The daal cudve been thicker and a bit more spicy.Pretty ordinary.
The Jhaal Frezi was really nice ,and the flavour of the vegetables was intact. 

Overall,they need to improve the food ,its very average.Also the cleanliness needs to be taken care.Thus,I cudnt rate it more than 2.5

The place needs a cleaning first as its dusty and full of mosquitoes. Second why the name jaisalmer bcoz it has no element of rajasthan in it.. Neither the decor nor the food. Lets come to the food. I ordered gaouloti kebab which was cold and the spices weren't even appropriate thus giving it a bland taste. In the main course we ordered veg jhal farezi which was good as compare to the dal makhani which was again bland. Jhal farezi was the only thing that i liked amongst all the food that i ordered. I loved the outdoor seating and i wish there was no mosquitoes. Hope to visit with an improved scenario.

Jaisalmer is the new kid in Sector 5 that has been making quite a buzz for it good food at very reasonable pricing.¬†
We finally gave it a try on a weekday afternoon for their lunch buffet. The place has a very colourful and vibrant feel to it and the high ceilings give it a very spacious feel. We were seated close to the buffet counter and we decided to start right away. The appetisers are served on the table and honestly speaking, we lost count of the varieties (definitely more than what was mentioned on menu). Special mention for the Prawn Tempura, the chicken shawarma (though I wish there were some pita breads accompanying it) and the shredded chicken.
By the time we reached the main course, we were already quite full so couldn't do much justice. All I had were the chicken and fish, and were both well cooked ¬†and flavoursome. The dessert spread was nothing elaborate. The lemon tart was quite basic but tasty and the rasagullas were well good like most rasgullas in town.
I had heard a lot about service issues but they seem to be improving.

All in all, good food at extremely reasonable pricing. Would definitely go back to try out their a la carte menu and especially their extensive variety of dimsums.

Jaisalmer is a lovely name to have, but spoiler ahead - this restaurant has no Rajasthani connect whatsoever. It is all about Indian and Chinese, and a little bit of Indo-Chinese if I may call it so. It is one of those ubiquitous one-buffet-covers-all-and-makes-hungry-IT-crowd-happy formats. I have nothing against the format, but here are my overall thoughts:

Pros:
1) Very nice ambience, and view, spacious and comfortable.
2) One-buffet-covers-all-good-value-for-money.
3) They got the Biryani right. Well, almost!

Cons:
1) Sits on a very crowded by-lane of sector 5, difficult to park.
2) If the escalator does not budge (as it did in my case), it is tough to get elderly people to climb as many stairs.
3) A-la-carte is a tad disappointing. I ordered 3 items, and they said they could serve only one. 1 out of 3 is not a good score to have! Taste of food is OK - nothing to complain about, but there is room for improvement. Also oil content is notably high.
4) Service is very slow and faltering.

Overall, an OK experience if you opt for the buffet.

Despite all the negative reviews on zomato, I have nothing but praise for this restaurant. We went there on Christmas night and opted for the buffet. The starters were excellent and of a wide variety, the main course a little odd as it had both Chinese and North Indian food and the desserts lovely. The restaurant seems a little confused about what they're serving as there is a little of everything on the menu. However since the food is standard, I have no complaints there.
There were a lot of people who opted for ala carte who seemed dissatisfied with the staff. However the buffet was more than up to the mark.

Buffet is really good. We went there last Monday for a buffet lunch and was very satisfied with the menu and quality of food. They will be serving you lots of veg and non veg starters and they will be very palatable. There were wide options of main course and desserts as well. My picks from starters, main course and desserts are  Mutton adrak ki punj, Shahi Paneer and baked mihidana respectively. 
The internal decor is of a royal touch. But thumbs down in service. Staff are not trained enough to serve in a restaurant in Sec V which charges close to ‚Çπ600 for a lunch. Mismanagement is an issue here.

Chaos and mismanagement has reached its peak here in this Restaurant.¬† We went there on 25th Dec for lunch. Our order was simple : Chicken Tandoori , Tandoori Roti, and Chicken Rara Punjabi. Even after 30 min of waiting, when the order was not served, we asked the waiter/manager(God knows who is playing which role here ) if our food will be served at all. They told us food will be served within 2 min. 10 minutes passed from then, we again asked another person, he bluntly told us that, A-la-cart Orders are generally served after a tad delay and assured us food will be served without any further delay. 
After 5 minutes of more waiting, food did turn up. We ordered Chicken Tandoori to have it as a starter (Generally people choose to have it a starter, I guess), they instead served the Roti and the Chicken Rara first. When we told there was Chicken Tandoori as a starter in our order, a person hurriedly went downstairs and brought the Tandoori. 
All the dishes were pretty ordinary, nothing good to remember. Although the Tandoori Chicken piece was a succulent one and tasted just okayish, nothing exceptional. The rotis were crisp but cold. Chicken rara Punjabi again was an bland preparation. When we asked for another roti , they forgot form which table the order was placed and instead¬† they were going to serve it at one of our neighboring table. 
We were taken aback seeing a person with a chef hat, was also bringing food from downstairs and serving them. That more or less tells how mismanaged this whole place is. 
The 3 rating that I have given them, is just for the Location, the Ambiance(it is actually quite good) and the pricing (pretty reasonable). 
Unless they pull their socks up and change the way the place is run, this restaurant has a very tough time ahead.

Good food with pocket friendly rates. The ambience is also nice. Definitely preferable over Azad Hind, Alibaba and Rang de Basanti in Sector V area if you are looking for North Indian dishes. But one and only negative point which also acts as a spoiler to its name and reputation is the service. In one word, the service is pathetic! The average waiting period for any order is approximately 45 mins! That too you won't be guaranteed with the exact items which you ordered will be served to you. The manager, the waiters and the stuffs doesn't know a thing about service. We witnessed instances where some group of foodies literally left the restaurant coz of the poor service offered. They need to look at the matter seriously as word of mouth will effect their goodwill regardless of their fine quality of food.

With a soft sun on our head we went there today for lunch, since holiday started at our client 's. From the first impression when we reached, they have not been able to live up to the point. Decided to hit this new joint based on a few review comments shared by friends and colleagues. To prepare a score card:
Food
Starter 8/10
Main Course 6/10
Dessert 8/10
Management
Day to day 3/10
Hospitality 5/10
Desk, Seat, Guest 1/10
Readiness 0/10
Ambience 6/10

They have a very good variety and mouth watering starters in place. However when your expectations went high roaming through the starters, main course might make you feel a bit "What is missing?". Dessert platters are full of variety and it always up on your sweet level. However dessert has nothing cold to melt the spices down your neck.
Now the weakest areas that I have observed,
Their seats were full one day prior, but still when we called we were not informed properly. We haven't had to wait but we had to talk through. They were running out of spoons very frequently. I used a serving spoon for dessert. We had a buffet and they were out of soft drinks. Foods once finished in the buffet table were taking time to be refilled.
However being a new kid in the block they have to rectify a lot and have to be prepared for huge crowd as its in Sector V, Salt lake.
Moreover I don't understand the name, unless I am looking at the tables and chairs. I mean where is "Daal Bari Churma" in the menu man........

we went to jaisalmer for a team lunch recently. location is easy to find, just on the right when you enter globsyn building in sector 5. parking could be tricky as the road is pretty crowded.
it has outdoor seating, which looked good. i will give it a try in the evening though as during lunch time it gets direct sunlight!
you step inside and the first thing that takes your eye is the hugeness of the restaurant. they have 2 floors with plenty of seating options. tables are placed in a relaxed fashion so even if lots of people are dining, it doesn't look overcrowded.
there is a small bar but it's stocked with non-alcoholic drinks currently as they have not yet got liquor license.
interior decor is a bit flat and not appealing at all. they tried to keep simple but it's too simple actually. you have white benches (without cushion) for seating in some of the tables which is a bit uncomfortable.
we went for lunch buffet @ 550+tax. they didn't tell us that there is corporate discount and we missed it. later from other reviews i came to know about it.
there were 7-8 non-veg starters ranging from chicken, fish, mutton and prawn. they have a live starter counter which prepares them quickly and serves them real hot. each starter tasted different and were great!
in the main course, we had both indian and chinese items ranging from chicken, fish and mutton. nothing to complain about anything here. chowmin, sechzwan fish were good. laal maas, chicken biriyani tasted heavenly!
come to dessert, i got floored when i saw baked mihidana and nolen gurer rosogolla among many other items. mihidana was awesome.
overall, food experience was very good. next time i will try some of the a-la-carte menu items and hope they get liquor license soon :)

Pretty much the latest craze in sector V.. Gave a party last week.  The food is decent though considering the pricing should have been better.  
The starters (chicken kebabs of various kinds) were decent..  Should have been softer and the chutney was disappointing.  Main course was better.  Breads were good.  Paneer was soft..  Mutton was decent.  A good meal but slightly pricy considering the options available nearby.  
Ambience is good though.  Large seating capacity makes it a good option.

This place has recently opened up and is really good. the moment you enter this place you will be surprised to find that the name has no such influence on its decor or cuisine. The seating arrangement might feel a bit cramped but is managable, though there is plenty of space between two tables, but yor table might feel a bit too full. the food is priced very attractively, service is fast, staff is well mannered, place is clean and hygenic , the decor is fresh and very roomy and open. The food is the main hero with plenty options for vegetarians. looking forward to many more visits.

Latest attraction for foodies and melting pot at Sector 5 is Jaisalmer. Located just at the heart of the city the concept and theme is very international. The live kitchen view at the entrance will work as an appetizer, smart thinking my management. The only restaurant in this area having such a huge outdoor seating provision. However, once you step in and watching the architecture carefully will justify why the same is named after a famous Rajasthan town. The concept is to create the lanes and houses of Jaisalmer. Initial thought was to make this establishment as an authentic place to Rajasthani food but later to increase footfall fusion of local, pan-asian and international cuisines found place in their menu.
We went for team lunch buffet, was bombarded with exquisite veg and non-veg starters. To me Mutton Adrak Ki Punj stood out among all others. Each and every item was so tasty and tempting we kept on ordering more.¬†
The main course had around 12 veg and non-veg dishes. Biriyani was dragging most attention among them.
In desserts among 5-6 dishes will recommend Baked Mihidana and Lemon Tart.
Buffet price is INR 550 + either lunch or dinner will give something to think about to their competitors like Barbeque Nation. For corporates another 10% discount.
One can even try ala carte to taste those innovations in their kitchen. If you are looking to go their for a romantic date then will recommend only on weekends to avoid mad crowd. Also at first floor they have option for private dining. Reservation is must for any days. Bar license is due on Jan'15. Even in so much hustle and bustle around; staffs were very attentive and will keep on checking with you real time feedback.¬†
During peak hours the buffet section becomes too crowded like fish market and live barbecue counter causes too much suffocation. Will suggest their management to take this as a scope of improvement.
Highly recommended, if you are yet to visit then wait no further use this festive season as the reason.

Everything about this restaurant is bad.
1. Bad service. Starters came so quickly that we had no time to finish one dish properly. Food piled up in our dishes. We had to ask for water.
2. Food quality was below average. Fishes were stinking. Chicken was not properly boiled.
3. They didn't provide 2nd round of gulabjamun. Instead brought plain rasgullas. That goes for rest for other deserts too. They didn't refill.
4. For veg people there was hardly 3-4 starters. We had to wait 20 mins for one roti.
5. Manager was noncooperative.
6. I asked for finger bowl and they just ignored.
Will never visit this place again.

Private cabins with good interior decor created a nice ambience. Food was descent. But the service needs a lot of improvement especially at peak hours. Value for money though n ok to revisit.

This is my second review for this place. Unlike my previous encounter the place appeared to be much vibrant and portrayed a clear Rajasthani outlook. The waiters were very courteous and professional, despite of the extremely busy hours at the time.

We had ordered Mutton Galouti Kabab, Chicken Tikka, Chicken Bharta, Chicken Do-Piyaza, Rotis, Kulchas and Biriyanis-both chicken and mutton. The order arrived in our tables really late: almost an hour. But all of our gritting vanished when we took the first morsel. The food was an absolute delight. The Galouti Kabab was so fit for king; and our all time favorite, Chicken Bharta was much over the top: Exquisite. We were also served complimentary desserts as a good gesture for the delay that was caused earlier.

The place has occupied a permanent place in my list now.

First of all, jaisalmer has to do nothing with Rajasthani ambience, food and delicacies. Its a modern style two-floor restaurant with a huge seating area includig private cabins on both the floors. The interior decor is nice and chic. The food was pretty decent. Whatever we ordered was good. As vegetarians, we are left with the same old options in the menu. The restaurant also has a buffet system. A nice and decent experience,  in total.

The ambience of the restaurant is nice. Went for the buffet spread. There were variety of options in the starters. However, not all starters were up to the mark. The main course was very good. Mutton was tender, chicken and fish was also delicious. Chinese items were also very good. For desert, mud pie was awesome. Overall, the service was nice.

The ambience is too good compared to the food price.Food is very much pocket friendly and taste is also  good enough. But dont go for the buffet, it's not worth.You can have the buffet in barbeque nation in same price, it's worth. Good for  a la carte. Only disadvanrage is they don't accept cards, only cash payment available!

On the occasion of my son's birthday, I decided to try out Jaisalmer located near Webel More in Sector V,Salt Lake. It was around 3 PM that we entered the restaurant. On entering, the same question crossed my mind which had crossed several of my foodie friends - "Why Jaisalmer!!"

The restaurant is two storied, spacious and has a large sitting capacity. There are options of seperate rooms with tables and chairs if a group decides that they would want a seperate arrangement.

Interior decoration and ambiance is good with long curtains, classy retro looking chairs and benches, spacious space,lamps hanging from roof and designer carpet.The intension is to give you a Raj Darbar kind of a feeling.

We decided since it was quite late, it's better to go for buffet. The buffet menu included the following items. The starters were served at the table. The cost of the buffet was Rs.500/- + taxes.

Welcome Drink: Soft Drink/Fresh Lime Soda

SOUP: Chicken Lemon Coriander Soup¬†
SALAD: Green Salad¬†

STARTERS

Vegetarian¬†
1. Spinach pancake¬†
2. Paneer tikka
3. Dahi kabab
4. Cottage cheese in coriander sauce
5. Hara tawa kabab
6.Mangolian veg

Non vegetarian

1.Teriyaki chicken¬†
2.Tempura prawn
3.Grilled fish in coriander sauce
4.Chicken Bar-B-Q
5.Mutton sheek kabab
6.Chicken tikka kabab

VEG & NON VEG MAIN COURSE

Indian¬†
1.Makai khumb mattar¬†
2.Lasuni daal3.Kadai paneer4.Dhania murg5.Chicken biriyani6.Lal maas

Chinese

1.Chicken in chilli oyster¬†
2.Fish chilli musturd3.Seasonal veg in hot garlic sauce4.Vegetable hakka noodle

DESERT

1.Lemon tart¬†
2.Chocolate tart
3.Mud pie
4.Brownie
5.Gulab Jamun
6.Raj bhog
7.Black forest
8.Mango flavour firni

The food was good (but I would not say excellant). Most of the starters had less seasoning and we preferred to sprinkle some salt. The taste of some of the items were very good whereas others were average. Personally I liked teriyaki chicken (with some additional salt), tempura prawn, lal maas, vegetable hakks noodle and chicken in chilli oyster. Mango flavoured firni was also something which was tasty. Rest of the food was ok types and there is much scope of improvement. 

The staff were very friendly and serves handful of every starter dish. There was never a shortage of supply. We requested for multiple additional services which were promptly provided.

Overall, I would say the restaurant is good but can be better. There is still scope of further improvement and with a price tag of Rs 500+, I think the food should be improved both in terms of spread and quality.

Worse customer service. Had called up a day in advance to book a table for Sunday family dinner. Even got 2 return call confirmation from the manager requesting us to be there by 8:15 pm. However when we land there dot at the hour, the Manager insisted that there was no booking and hence we have to wait for 25 mins before we get the table. Will not recommend any single one to try out here.

Newest addition to the Restaurant map of Secotr V, Kolkata. Ambiance is good with PDRs. Although its has both Indian and continental section but I have only tried the Indian one. The Biriyani is very good with huge quantity and good taste. Chicken bharta is ok. The best thing here is the baked mihidana. It is just awesome. Have not yet tried the buffet. So next time you visit the electronics complex do try Jaisalmer.

I just happened to have the no-so-good luck of visiting this restaurant today. We had our office party and being a group of eighteen, we naturally opted for the buffet dinner. And buoy, i was so utterly disappointed with the whole experience !!!
I have been to some fine restaurants in the area that serves finger licking good food, unlike this place. There are so many bad things worth mentioning that¬† i'd better go for a numbered list.
1. The ambiance is just okay. They've made some good use of mirrors just to create a temporary illusion of space. Once you get over it, you might even feel claustrophobic with the whole setup. And they have hung some ugly looking lights over the table which appears to be borrowed from the World War 2 Nazi underground bunkers. OVERSMART!!!
2. The seating arrangement is awfully bad. It‚Äôs hard to get up or leave your seat. Even the staff had so much difficulty in serving that literally the person had to extend the plate to the waiter to receive food on his platter. A very nasty and embarrassing move I must say. 
3. We had to ask four different staff members to serve food and it almost took them half an hour to start. The soft drink took ages to arrive after the order and when it did, it was out of fizz. POOR START!!!
4. The buffet starters arrived and there were mixed reactions to the taste. I personally liked the reshmi-kabab and the gulauti-kabab but others had their own taste bud stimulizers. One thing we unanimously zeroed in was the fact that fish kabab was the worst and smelled like a cheap fish market. We had to ask for the green chutney repeatedly and when it arrived our starters were all over. Thanks to their promptness! Overall the starters were a LET DOWN.
5. Now came the time for main course and they had pretty many things on the menu. But the arrangement is once again CHAOTIC. The items were arranged in two rows and getting to the upper row was difficcult and involved jumping and stretching. Something i didn't go there for. Besides that, there was a queue for the main course and it was right beside the grill machine and it was so hot and uncomfortable that it felt like we might get ourself grilled instead of the food. POOR ARRANGEMENT!!!
6. For dessert, they just had a yellow rasgulla which none wanted to taste. Nothing else ! We asked a staff and he replied that firni will be served soon. We waited and to our surprize we were served steaming hot firni. Which f***ing restaurant serves hot firni??? We even tried tasting that and it was bad like most other dishes of the night. Just two desserts for a buffet dinner? Are you kidding me? SHAME !!!
I hereby pledge that I‚Äôll never visit this restaurant again in my life. They don‚Äôt seem to have the concept of repeat business in mind.¬† So if you're planning to visit this restaurant and you're reading this, please do yourself a favor and dine someplace else. You'll thank me for it.

Visited for dinner with some office colleagues and opted for the buffet. While the name is very misleading and the cuisine doesn't resemble anything even remotely Rajasthani, the decor and general ambience is pretty nice...way more roomy than what has become the norm nowadays in the common buffet places. The food spread is awesome and the variety that they offer, at a very competitive price point, beats its competitors hands down. However, when it comes to the taste of the food, there's plenty of room for improvement. The appetizers, except the shawarma which was excellent, were remarkably dry. The fish had a distinct smell to it (not the bad variety but a smell nevertheless) and the mutton was very tough. The dessert spread was nice and though they score high on the bread & milk & cream one, the firni was a letdown. Overall, they seem to have a good intent and with some slight improvements made tothe taste of the dishes, this place may become the next best option in the buffet circuit.

Visiting day - 6th Dec 2014

i wanted to give 4.0 but i had visited only once and if next time also i get out off this restaurant happily like this time .. then for sure i am giving 4.0 .¬†
I am not very much sure why some people are saying so wrong about this restaurant (if about the buffet spread then it might because i had opted for a la carte and it was really nice, next time i will go for buffet). For me,

***********************************************

Ambiance- 4.0

Food Taste ‚Äì 4.0

Location- 5.0

Service- 3.5

Value for money ‚Äì 4.5

********************************************

Ambiance-¬†
it was a sunny day and i had entered this restaurant around 2pm ... open grill setup, long curtains, classy chairs for couples, enough space and nice arrangement for groups, that to a big violin just beside the entrance gate and there was setup for out door seating (may be not functional by now) but overall really nice. go with friends or office group, this is great place to just for hangout even.

Food-
ordered lemon chilli murg tikka (rs. 140) ¬†and chicken kalmi tangri kebab ... nicely prepared like majaa aa gaya khaake... then mirch makai puloa (rs. 90) as i was really interested to see how they prepare it and try to mix the corn with rice... but not that special ..it's ok and that to so less priced ... i could not expect more . Along with that Baby corn mushroom matar , gravy was really tasty and i expected a little bit spicy rather it should have been for better taste .

Location ‚Äì
¬†anything comes in salt lake sector 5, that's a 5 for me ... and this place you can see from a long distance & just beside KFC, widely written "Jaisalmer". i have attached the snapshot. PFA ( giving IT touch review :P )¬†

Service ‚Äì¬†
yes, like other reviews, i agree service was not that up to the mark, there is scope for improvement. because if you cross check 4 times along with a notepad to verify order of four items, it does not go well as customer point of view. the preparation time was okay and they had given proper attention to us, no question about that.

Value For Money ‚Äì
you would be getting out of this restaurant happily i must say if you spend wisely. because if you order by a la carte , the food taste will be good for sure (i am not sure about buffet) and total bill for me was Rs. 560 
.. and i was rather happy with it.¬†

Jaisalmer ‚Äì PLEASE somebody tell me why have you named it "JAISALMER" ... whatever it is, you have selected a nice place, arrangements and set up is excellent... open tandoor preparation idea awesome... you will make sector 5 more famous among foodies for sure...

one of the better restaurants I have had buffet so far. went there last week on a weekday lunch buffet. probably the maximum no of starters they served among all restaurants i have been like this, few were really awesome. one must try the swarma and prawn starters. they had wide range of main course items too. biriyani was good. the fish manchurian and some chicken devil something in chinese items were delicious too. desserts was a little let down though. but the pudding saved the day.

overall a very good experience. though service may need a little improvement. but food quality and taste was good, no doubt.

This is worst restaurant of sector 5. After going to BBQ nation,red hot chilli pepper-red express,Funjabi tadka,Ahoyasia,Omg,Bistro,Bhojoharimanna,Shoolo ana bangali,BB's for in numerous times we thought of changing our taste buds trying this new place which seemed preety attractive and that became a challenge..
Areas they did wrong in our buffet menu which is rs 500 + taxes..
The fish they served was smelling. Had we not complained they would had served that only.
The service was awfull had to keep on calling them to serve us with other buffet starters.
The Thumps up served was out of fizz
The Biriyani had chicken so stiff that If you throw at anyone that person would die.

The only good thing was the mutton,the meat was soft n tender however for that price you expect a little better food and among desert the baked mihidana seemeed good.

Overall a bad experience a place like sector where we have places like BBQ nation..Owner of Jaisalmer please improve your place..

My 2 nd review:-
I was a bit skeptical about going back to this place based on my first experience during the Puja Indared again and I was really excited to see they have upgraded so much!!
Th food was amazing and so were the starters, due to Puja rush delivery took a bit of times but in the end the food was great! !
The golden fried prawn and chicken drumstick were amazing!!

Went to ''Jaisalmer'' a new restaurant housed in Globsyn Crystals building Sec V, Kolkata. The place is spacious, fabulously decorated, food items are plentiful and ambiance is superb. I must mention that the high roof, hanging lamp shades and the throne like kingly chairs will give you a Nawabi feel. It does have a spread of North Indian, Grill and Pan Asian foods. Portions are sufficient and the prices are very reasonable going by both the Sec V and the restaurant standards. We ordered Chicken Lemon Coriander Soup, Chicken Hot & Sour Soup, Conjee Crispy Lamb, Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken Thai Red Curry. Foodwise it is awfully good. Superb but foodwise and decorwise no Rajasthani or Jaisalmiri....

It is one of the finest new restaurants in sector V. Been there twice for ala-carte &  buffet and thoroughly satisfied both times. Located adjacent to the globsyn building it is a spacious restaurant. The interior is fabulously decorated & the couples chair are eye catching. Coming to the food, the servings in la carte are plentiful and deliciously prepared. The buffet covers a lot of items. The fish irani kebab & chicken kebab stand out. Some of the other items missed a bit of salt. The main course consisted of 12 dishes out of which the veg Chinese noodles &  the Chinese fish dish was awesome. Coming to the deserts each item was good. Overall food quality & quantity is awesome. One con is the confusion of the waiters during the buffet. They kept on serving the starters in a different manner unlike most buffet restaurants. Hopefully this shall improve with experience.

A brand new entry at Sector V - the outlet stand aside from the rest because of its grand exterior. It was a matter of chance that we visited the place, first impression was simply awesome. The interior is huge, adequate free space, large screen projector, TV sets, two floors, seating arrangement gives you that "Rajdarbar" feel with retro chairs and benches. The restaurant serves North Indian and Chinese cuisine - there are no resemblance between the name of the outlet and the kind of food they serve. We went for buffet - 500 INR plus tax. 

Course started with Chicken Shawarma which was good. This was followed by other veg, chicken, fish and mutton preparations. There were two types of paneer, two kinds of fish preparatoon, one mutton and another preparation of chicken. I didn't like any of them apart from the prawn. House staffs were very friendly and serves handful of every dish. There was never a shortage of supply. 

Of the main course, I did like the Biryani and the chicken dish. There were options for chinese as well. From the dessert, I liked nalengur rosogolla and Gulam Jamun, both of them were served hot. 

Overall, I believe the outlet has a prospect and has the start it needed. They need to drastically improve on the quality though. And once that happens, it will stand out from the rest and will be a great place to visit at the heart of sector V.

Though the name is an oxymoron , yet I can trade it off with the decent buffet at the price offered . It's of the same group which owns the Harvey's chain of restaurant . Hence u can find the similarity of taste in the buffet menu . The satays remains flat as the basa used is not meant for satays and the sauce is 2 sweet The biriyani is authentiacally Punjabi and the mutton bara kebabs are really soft. Deserts sans ice creams and with miniature brownies and Black Forest pastries with an ordinary Bengali Mishti is ok .

I will definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone as I am here in Kolkata from last 1 year and I was not satisfied with most of the restaurants but I can say Jaisalmer is a one of "THE" restaurant in Kolkata. Food quality was really good. and so the interior.. We tried Veg and Non-veg Buffet dinner.. & All the items in menu were tasty. Staff was also good and well mannered.
If you are planning for weekends then maybe you will face some problem of crowd waiting outside the restaurant.. as we waited there for almost 1 hr... but as per below mentioned comment "which proves that how much demand does the food of the restaurant has among the kolkatans"

If u ask me whether to go for it or not. I will recommend this restaurant for that period of time when u have no GOOD choice left... So yes jaisalmer is a restuarant where the ambience is good,  it's spacious nk doubt,  lighting and decor is good; fair enough though management and portion of the quantity id not up to the mark i guess. Like we ordered two portion of crispy babycorn and singapori chilli chicken something. .. and they give js in one sing medium sized bowl... i m sorry but yes that's a fact which really disappoints us bcz we are 10 in number and that two portion of total 4 dishes not satisfied us... and if i talk about management staff. They are really confused. . Not interactive. .. introvert kind of guyz.. Surprised! Isn't it

Can anyone please tell me why the name is Jaisalmer??? Its not that they serve food having any acquaintance with Jaisalmer!! Not that the waiters are dressed up like one! Not even the decor is one of those! But the decor was pleasant I would say... with high roof and hanging lamp sheds.. looked nice and classy!

We were eager to try out the new kid in 'Sector 5 Buffet Bazaar'! And almost cancelled the plan as they did not receive call for a whole day... I thought of trying out on the day of lunch.. and suddenly i got lucky as one of them kindly picked up the phone!! He detailed me about the lunch buffet price, along with the items... and also added they have a corporate discount of 10% which obviously made us happier!

We reached at about 1:15pm and found almost 75% of the tables full.. pretty amazing for a restaurant which opened just 16 days ago!! We were seated immediately and got to have a view to their 'Open' live kitchen where all the starters were getting prepared. May be a nice view to look at, but definitely not one for breathing! Smell of raw chicken and fishes, different kind of sauces and what not filled in the air.. some of us really choked because of the smoke.. Definitely a good idea, but should have been maintained in a better way!

Took a while for the Starters to be presented.. 7 Non-Veg starters were served one-by-one.. Chicken korma, BBQ chicken, Chicken teriyaki, Lemon coriander Fish, Golden Fried Prawn, Chicken tikka kabab and Mutton Seekh.. Chicken Korma tasted okay.. Others were very average.. most of them lacked seasoning.. on top it, the quality of the meat/fish was poor.. specially the fish and the prawn were hard and chewy, not the softness you get from a fresh one! The service turned out to be on a slower side, as we had to ask for every single thing.. like green chutneys, like tissues and all! The complimentary Fresh lime soda saved our soul, though one of us complained of over-usage of lemon juice!!

The Manchow chicken soup tasted pretty good.. The Main course followed.. Good number of options I must say! It consisted both of Indian and Chinese items.. like Chicken Biryani, Mutton Kosha, Murg Lababdar and Palak Paneer, along with Burnt garlic noodles, Devil's Fish, Manchurian Chicken and Exotic veggies in Buttered sauce.. I went for the noodles with portions of fish, chicken and veggies! The noodles had no hint of burnt garlic in first place.. and again lacked seasoning! The fish smelt rotten... the chicken was okay..

The winner for me was the veg dish! Broccoli, cauliflower, chinese cabbage, carrots, onion, zucchini, capsicums in a butter-flavored white gravy.. tasted mind-blowing!! To the extent that I took a second helping of it!

Both the mutton and paneer items were good, according to my friends.. the biryani again stood average!

What really bothered us in between was the service.. we had to ask for spoon and fork thrice.. took them lot of time to clear the soup bowls.. and the waste plate never arrived!! The waiters were pretty amateurish.. looked confused actually!

The Desserts section consisted of Baked mihidana, gulab jamun, nolen gurer roshogolla, brownie, mud pie and banana pastry.. The mihidana was disastrous.. pastry was okay.. and the brownie and pie were heaven! Could have been better with a scoop of vanilla ice cream though! I was surprised to see no ice creams in their desserts menu..

We asked for the bill.. and asked to add the corporate discount as discussed over phone.. there started the actual drama! A waiter came to us saying there is no corporate discount.. We asked to talk with their managers.. 2-3 of them were standing in front of us, and no body paid attention! After much of calling and asking to speed up the billing process, one guy came up to us only to say the same thing, i.e, no corporate discount was available.. I informed him about the discussion and he said that person was not aware of their rules and regulations.. in fact that person was some one from Balle Balle Dhaba OR Honey Da Dhaba!! What a joke it was!! Some one receiving the call tells you about some rule which does not stand valid and on top it he is not even a part of the restaurant!! We decided not to argue any more and he decided to be kind enough to give us a 5% discount!!

Average food, very average service, confused management.. Not recommended!

I visited this place with my wife on a weekend after hearing a lot from my office collegaues. Sector 5 is not the place to be on a weekend. However, I was quite surprised to see that this restaurant has become a crowd puller even on weekends. The restaurant was almost full when we entered but we managed to get a table. The decor was pleasant and so was the ambience. I tend to prefer well-lit interiors. Now to come to the food.We first ordered Adrak ke panje and Chicken lasooni kabab for starters. Both the items were a delight to the senses. Both mutton and chicken was cooked perfectly and were extremely juicy and succulent.Then there was mutton biriyani. Biriyani was light and mildly flavored which makes it a little different from other biriyani houses in Kokata. Then we ordered garlic naan (which is personal favorite of mine) and Murg Lucknowi Handi. Naan was good and the chicken item was a little less spicy but tasted wonderful nonetheless. Overall, it is a great restaurant and I am planning to be back soon.

Had buffet here and although the menu is quite good  , they have to seriously start revisiting their recipes. Their sauces are not enough spicy . although the biryani is moderate the fish dishes are a huge let down .

Salt Lake, Sector 5‚Äôs restaurant Jaisalmer is a restaurant based on quality. The restaurant is decorated with pleasing interiors; also the servicing is quite excellent. We were actually astonished by the crowd waiting outside the restaurant which proves that how much demand does the food of the restaurant has among the kolkatans. After little wait we managed to enter, but after seeing their list of food I was pretty sure that we will be fully satisfied.¬† Now come to the food which is the most important thing of all. We only preferred food from the Indian items. The restaurant also keeps the Chinese items. As my group was little big we took little time to decide what to order. But I was quite ecstatic to find that the menu was quite satisfactory as there were a whole lot of kebab items, options were huge. We chose our first item chicken pahari kebab and tandoori gobi. While chit chatting with friends eating such delicious items was simply awesome. Then pulao items list got our attention and we chose mirch makai pulao. With that we had chicken bharta and masala omelet. Needless to say I love chicken with rice, especially the gravy. We also had kadai prawn. The pieces of the prawn were cooked very well with the gravy making the whole dish yummy. Lastly we had Bengalis very own malpua with rabri.

My experience at Jaisalmer was simply awesome. I must say guys don't forget to indulge yourselves in the firni that is a flagship dessert that Jaisalmer serve.
Besides, the tandoori chicken, fish tikka kabab, mutton korma and chicken bharta were also wonderful. I liked all of these items that are carefully cooked and served at its best.

How could I miss out mentioning about the ambiance. The eatery is brilliantly decorated with a neo-ino-western pattern. You will love the lights there that are attached from the ceiling . The hosting must be rated 4 out of 5. I loved it.

The first thing that strikes you about the place is how brightly it's lit up and the lovely shades of pastel that are used for the decor. The interiors are extremely pleasing to the eye, although not sure if the unfinished tables and chairs are part of the look or are incomplete. Coming to the food, we had only the Indian. It was good. Nothing extraordinary that you would carry back with yourself. The service was on the slower side and there was a lot of confusion regarding the orders which does not always create a pleasing atmosphere. Having said that, the staff were very keen on replacing the items and correcting their mistakes. The prices are also extremely reasonable and wouldn't leave a hole in the pocket. All in all, it was an average experience. Nothing really to take back from it though remember this place by.

I go to restaurants primarily for the experience. Jaisalmer service levels need improvement. Somehow, they seem to have hired fresh out of school waiters or so..and they really need to be trained.

Food is very good though :)

On what basis should a restaurant be rated?Is it only food or is it an amalgamation of the feelings you carry back while bidding adieu to the moments you have spent?

We, a group of 5 closest frnz visited Jaisalmer tonight for a friend's treat.
Sunday evening saw a big crowd with a waiting time of 40mins !Being a non festive day we were astonished by this.
Now lemme come straight to the point,food was awesome,specially the starters!!!
We ordered 2 plates of Nalli kebab,1 Fish Irani tikka kebab ,1 Adrak ke panje in starters.
Each of them were really really awesome ,irani tikka kebab had this huge chunk of succulent fish cubes while adrak ke panje was unanimously the one to die for.
Nalli was also superb!

For main course we ordered 1special chicken biriyani,3 kashmiri pulao, 2 chicken lababdar , 1 mutton shahi korma .The rice dishes were huge in quantity and we couldnt finish them.

For desert we wanted malpoa with rabri which was unavailable so we had hot golapjam and baked mihidana..
To summarise,awesome food in good ambience ,however would like to mention that we found the owner's behaviour really horrible.
He was literally rude and was taking special care for large groups at the cost of smaller groups like us!!
I have never seen such humiliating restaurant owner before!Rating the restaurant is becoming really confusing due to this irritating experience of the owner's behaviour.
Would like to mention about Mr Joydip Ghosh who was courteous and quite helpful in food selection.
This place deserves a definite 4 for its fare but the experience we had regarding the owner's behaviour is a sure dampener...

Jaisalmer.... To Bengalis like us the name reminds us of Satyajeet Roy's Sonar Kella and beatiful memories attached to it.

The restaurant is on 1st floor of the Globsyn Building, near WEBEL GATE, Sec- 5, Salt Lake. This is beside the KFC Outlet.
The restaurant has a plush interior, with almost one side with glass wall overviewing the Sec-5.
The buffet spread had-
Starter-
1. Chicken -2 types: Both were extremely good.
2. Mutton-1 type: Succulent pieces of meat in roasted style. The meat retained its moisture and flavor of meat. BEST OF THE LOT.. !!
3. Fish- 1 type: Awesome tender pieces of Fish kebab.... simply awesome!!
4. Prawn- 1type: Medium pieces of Prawn fried and served...

Main Course-
1. Chowmein (Veg)- I generally avoid vegetarian Chinese items but this one was awesome.
2. Chicken Gravy Item: awesome
3. Fish Gravy Item: superb
4. Chicken Biryani: Another best of the lot item... Typical Kolkata style Biryani with Chicken and Potato.
5. Butter Chicken: Good one.
6. Mutton Kassa: Delicious Mutton ib Indian style Gravy which is a perfect match for the Biryani.
There were 6types of veg items as well which we couldnt try.
Dessert was also of 6types appx.

Given the above, I can bet the Buffet spread can give a tough competition to Bar B Que Nation in the other lane.

Icing of the cake is the below the belt pricing- Rs 500 plus Taxes.

However their service is absolute nonsense n u feel like being served at a government run restaurant. U have to run after the waiter for menu card, shrill for delivery of food ( which takes 1hr time) n create a scene for the bill. They are pure worthless and any amount of shouting bears minimum effect on them.

If u r taking delivery, u need to count ur food before u leave or else 1/2 da food shall be nicely parcelled n delivered. Beware of these n enjoy da food.

Buffet Spread- 4/5
Food Quality- 3/5
Value for money- 1/5
Ambience- 4/5
Service- 0/5.
The average comes to 4.75/5... since it could not be rated like 4.75, we have rated 4.5.

Hence, strongly recommended... !!!

A good Indo-Chinese restaurant, though looks like Indian is their specialty. We went there for a team lunch and must say experience was pretty good. This place is a new one at Sec V area with great interior which will give you a feel good factor the moment you enter. Food quality was awesome compared to pocket friendly price tag. Service was bit slow but you can give them a benefit of doubt being new and were serving to a big group of twenty hungry people. Liked the idea that they have both Buffet & √Ä la carte option. Tried different Indian dishes as they don't serve Chinese in √Ä la carte. Most of them was great and was served with piece of smile which we still remember. If you are looking for a good Indian restaurant in this area I would suggest give it a try & you won't be disappointed.

Word of caution: They still don't have Credit Card system in place. So check you pocket before you enter :)

Its a new restaurant at Sector 5, opened hardly a month back. We went there today itself (mid November) for a lunch buffet of 21 people. The decor of the mezzanine floor is amazing. Buffet is however served on the ground floor. Food is very decent and covers a wide variety of platters. The highlight of the menu was a mutton item with mutton pieces almost 1 foot long! Yes, HUGE pieces! Couldnt recall the name of that dish however. We were served almost 8 types of starters, which was probably to earn some brownie points as its a relatively new restaurant. Each of the items was delicious. Main course was okay, however dessert had nothing special, just normal stuff you get at other restaurants. Only baked mehidana sounded nice, but it wasnt too tasty what-so-ever. The only negative point is probably the serving pace and style. The staff is lethargic and slow. However when there's good food, you forgive a few mistakes. All in all, would definitely re-visit this restaurant once it gets its liquor license.

Jaisalmer, the name strikes a spark in all beangali's heart. The newly setup restaurant in the heart of Sec 5, Kolkata doesnot tribute to Ray's creativity rather provides a modern bistro ambience.The new nook serves North Indian, Oriental and Pan Asian food - both buffet and ala carte. We opted for Buffet service for our team lunch.The starter had golden fried prawns, chicken seekh kebab, chicken reshmi kebab, tandoori chicken, fish in garlic sauce, lebanese chicken. You will be filled with the hot and moderate servings and average taste. The main course had many options as well. From the oriental kitchen, options included chowmein, kung pao chicken, chilli chicken and veg in oyester sauce. The indian platter included chicken biriyani , mutton rogan josh, naan, chicken tikka masala, panner butter masala and corn palak. Naan was served when requested ¬†But the taste was not at all credible. The dessert was served with hot gulab jamuns, shahi tukda and a mango firni. The service was very slow and the managers took order without being aware of the inventory. Overall I will give¬†2.5 on a scale of¬†5 and would like to judge a month or two later when they had set their foot more strongly on the most gastronomic city of the planet.

I wish there was an option to give 0.5 or 0.25... Went to Jaisalmer on a Friday for lunch buffet... There are lots of noticeable contradictions and fails...

1. Restaurant name has no resemblance with the served cuisine.

2. Although its buffet, we had to depend on the restaurant staff to serve the starters, and they were serving as little quantity as they possibly can...

3. Chicken biriyani was the only main dish option. No rice or naan option for vegetarians.

General observations

1. Waiters are clueless about what they should be doing... most of the time they are just crowding together discussing amongst themselves.

2. Manager is shouting and running across the entire area.

3. Refill rate of items in buffet is pathetic... We had to wait 5-10mins for an item to be refilled... few people were actually eating while standing in front of serving area since the items are getting exhausted as soon as they are refilled. Mutton roganjosh was not refilled at all.

4. Waiters are not filling up water in empty glasses... used plates are not removed and lying on the tables...

5. Food taste is ok. Nothing special and not worth 2nd visit.

6. Buffet price was on higher side... Rs. 550 per person.

7. Insufficient napkins.

8. Cold water provided in Finger bowls.

9. Bringing the bill took forever and we had walk to the checkout counter... which we noticed is a 12inch small square window with multiple waiters crowding in front of it.

10. Only accepts cash!!!

A place you can easily (and better) avoid without any regret.

A very new member in saltake,sec v area, opened just after diwali. the restaurant is 2 floored and they have aquired really a big place to set up. their insight decor is quite good, the ambience is soso. actually it looks like they have just started, but a lot is remaining to rennovate. but in the night, this place looks really awsome from outside.

now coming to food, i should clear one thing that though the  name is jaisalmer, but they do not serve any rajasthani food, instead it's a typical indian+chinese/pan asian restaurant. i have tried here mutton biriyani (both normal and special), murgh lucknow handi, kadhai prawn, adrak ke panje, chicken fried rice and chilli wine fish. here one thing is clear that come to this place only for indian, chinese is not upto the mark at all. the fried and fish preparations were fine, but not proper chinese dish. coming to indian, adrak ke panje was superb, really liked it. the prawn and chicken side dishes were quite good. biriyani taste is quite fine, and the quantity is huge, tough for a normal person to complete one plate. the mutton and chicken pieces were very soft. 

based on the food, this place really deserves 4. but here is the main negative point and that is their management and stuffs. the waiters are not all proffessional. they are taking the order, but giving wrong food in the table, forgetting to give water at the start, waiting time is not less etc. so, as a whole that professional touch is lacking here. if anyone is planning to take parcel, i would suggest to double check the items before payment. even they do not have the credit card facilty yet.

so as a whole i should say that they have a lot of places to improve the service, but at the sametime it's very hard to find such food in such cheaper price in sec v area. for a foodie llike me, i would suggest to visit atleast once...

My husband,S, brought a Special mutton biriyani and chicken lababdar from here,since we were hoping to try this new place near to his office.My surprise was basically Two-fold:
1. The Packing mentioned name of¬† not¬† Jaisalmer,but of¬† Honey Da dhaba,but the bill mentioned Jaisalmer.
2.¬† The Mutton Biriyani was accompanied with one chicken piece and 1 egg (it was supposed to be 2 mutton pieces and 2 eggs,as explained to S.

The Mutton dish was very common,nothing special.Chicken dish was thikthak (I have had better lababdar ).The prices were the only +part in the whole 1st experience.I would not recommend.

Jaisalmer! The name itself speaks volumes about the heritage of Rajasthan & its food.
But there is no connection of the name with its food or ambiance, barring a wall decor on the mezzanine floor. But that doesn't mean that the decor is not great... in fact it has been beautifully done, ¬†but just doesn't go with the name.¬†

It serves both Buffet & Ala Carte options & & they have a fairly varied buffet menu. But as we opted for Ala Carte to have our own pickings.

The first thing you notice in the menu is PRICING! The price just doesn't justify the ambiance. I mean its so REASONABLE.... it feels that this outlet is determined to throw its neighbors out of business, Literally!

We tried both Indian & Oriental dishes: Dahi Kababs, American Corn Salt Pepper, Sweet Corn Soup, Paneer Tikka, Dal Makhani, Butter Nan & Masala Kulchha with 3 glasses of Soft Driink and I must say there was no complaint as far as the taste was concerned & the quantity, if not eye popping, was very generous helping.

But the service was a huge letdown... had seen guests literally walking up to the Captain & Live Cooking stations & getting aggressive. I mean its a mood spoiler when you are out for dining.

But i guess, these are just teething issues and are being taken notice of by the management & will be ironed out sooner than later.

Cheers for the good food!

Food - Food quality is really good and price is quite affordable. We have ordered 1 chicken wanton soup, 1 red and green pepper chicken, 1 cheese naan, 1 butter naan, 1 chicken rara punjabi. Soup was average and its consistency was really thin. Red and green pepper chicken was a medium spicy dish with good tangy flavour and taste. Butter naan was standard and cheese naan was flavourful. Chicken rara punjabi was spicy and tasty and chicken was really soft and it melted readily in the mouth. Lastly, the show stopper was gajar ka halwa. Halwa was delicious. 

Ambience - The restaurant was really bright, beautiful and spacious with posh white decor. Music was soothing and relaxing.

Service - I wont say service was worst. The food arrived much quickly than we have expected. The staffs were good with their behavior. We had to wait only a little long for the bill payment.

We would definitely like to go there again and try the varities.

Food is good and the price is very reasonable. We had Chicken hot n sour soup, tandoori chicken, chicken pind punjabi, keema naan n mutton biriyani. The soup was good in taste as well as in quantity. One is enough for two people. Lots of chicken pieces and other vegetables were there. There was lots of stuffing in the keema nan n the biriyani was was light n tasty, little bit oily but that can be out looked for the taste. Chicken pind punjabi is really very tasty. The quantity they provide currently for the price in that area is very good. For food I would give it 4.0. The service gets really poor even if it is half filled. They do screw up with the service, one tables order is served to another table, very few experienced servers or waiters. For service I would give it 2.5. It's a new Restaurent so do take cash with you, currently they don't accept cards.

No.. Its not a theme based one ! Its just another restaurant at globsyn crystal building kolkata. Food is good but can be improved further. We had buffet lunch which is 500+ tax. We felt that it is value for money.. Kababs, biriyani and typical chinese items are more or less average. If you expect some surprise then don't. I would have given them a perfect 4.0 but the service is poor. They didn't even ask that we need some more starter or not.. What they did is to STOP serving ! Until and unless you specify them they won't provide a welcome drink (which was a mocktail and included in the package).. After a little enquiry they provided a glass of coke !! And they have just opened so carry cash because they are not accepting a card ! From the whole menu i can hardly remember two items prawn kabab and firni ! All in all regular items are neatly made and they really need to pull their socks to make things better. All the best Jaisalmer..

The bill was 1900. We ordered 4 chicken dishes, 2 plates of peas pulao and 4 naans. The ambience was superb. 
Its a request to all foodies please go and try the dishes before there is a rise in price!
