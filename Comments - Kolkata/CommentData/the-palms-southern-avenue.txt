Located almost nearby Kalighat Metro Station, The Palms stands right on the heart of Southern Avenue. Starting from Asian, Awadhi,Mughlai and North Indian, the food here is amazing. The decor and the ambience deserves brownie points as well. Visited this place today with my huge family of 15 people and we ordered a variety of items. 

WHAT WE ORDERED : 

1.HOT & SOUR SOUP 
2.KALMI KEBABS 
3.RAW BANANA PEPPER SALT 
4.FISH HARAPUNJABI 
5.PESHAWARI NAAN
6.SARSO KA SAAG 
7.MUTTON RARAH
8.MUTTON BIRIYANI
9. ICED LITCHI TOFFEE
10.HONEY DARSHAAN 
11.GAJAR KA HALWA 

The Biriyani was amazing ,. Now coming to the mandarin fish and kalmi kebabs, I must say they bost deserve the star dish award. 
Iced Litchi Toffee is a must try not matter what and Honey Darshaan also deserves a special mention . 
Overall I longed to visit this place and finally did and I am very much happy with the experience .Do visit

Went to the Palms on 1st Jan,2018..Lunch date on the First day of the year has to be special and it was worth going there.. I loved the place,the ambience,the seating arrangement..we got the table from where we can enjoy the roadside view..the staffs were well behaved and very polite..
Though in case of food they have a lot of items unavailable then,and not a single mocktail was available on that day so we had to order Fresh Lime and cold drinks for refreshment..
We ordered
Tandoori chicken (half) - 4/5
Mahi Koli Bara-4.5/5
Butter Naan-4/5
Gosht Rarha- 4.5/5 (it was spicy)
Gajar ka Halwa- 4.5/5 (hot and yummy)
The food tastes yummy..I loved the place as well as the food.. Next time want to taste the items which were unavailable then especially te mocktails..üòé

Visited this place on new year's eve. It's located near kalighat metro station. An awesome place to dine out with family and friends. The rich ambiance and the wonderful service pleased me most. Now coming to the food. We tried both mughlai and Chinese cuisines there. We ordered:
1. Murgh banzara
2. Nizami biriyani 
3. Murgh Mussallam
4. Mixed Phad siew noodles (a type of Thai flat noodles)
5. Chicken chilly garlic noodles 
6. Tausi chicken 
7. Sizzling brownie with hot chocolate sauce topped with vanilla ice cream 
Each and every dish is authentically cooked and fresh. But according to me, their Chinese and Thai items are better than mughlai cuisine. Specially the Phad siew noodles has won my heart. The quantity of each dish is very good. One plate of noodles/biriyani is enough for two. And the best part is the dessert. The best sizzling brownie I have ever tasted. The service is very prompt also. I would like to visit this place again :)

The place mainly specialises in Indian dishes. You will not find authentic Chinese here. Continental is available and is quite good. The decor is nice and is perfect for a family dinner or lunch or a birthday celebration.
We ordered Singapore Mixed Chowmin, Kung Pao Chicken, Hot Garlic Chicken, Schezwan Mixed Fried Rice.
The Chowmin was of okayish and the fried rice was a bit too spicy for a normal person to have. The side dishes were quite nice and finger licking.
The service was a bit of disappointing as there were merely no people to take orders and we had to go and ask for a Stuart to take our order.

What better way to start the new year than with a feast? And for that we chose The Palms, and boy are we glad!
At 1 o' clock in the afternoon we seemed to be the first customers of the day but the place filled up fast soon enough. The restaurant offers both Indian and Oriental cuisine and we were promptly handed both menus upon being seated.
We ordered murgh tandoori, teriyaki chicken, mixed moon fan fried rice, mixed hakka chowmein, Kung pao prawn and chicken in oyster sauce and finally chocolate ice cream.
The taste, quality and quantity of the food had left no place for any complaints neither had the prompt and courteous staff.
It's easy to see why this place has such rave reviews!

An awesome place to dine out with friends and family. Pleasant decor with wide variety of cuisines available for everyone. We took galawti kabab and one fish item (suggested by them)for starter and it was delicious. For main course we went for regular menu. I found Chinese better. Biriyani roti needs improvement.

Had two very different kind of experience on two recent visits. 1st visit on 23rd December with friends and on 31st December with family. Food is excellent, mutton galawti kabab is a must have, the mutton pieces in hydrabadi biriyani will melt in your mouth..the fish amritsari is too spicy yet tasty..the worst part is the serve basa and write bhetki in their menu card..and even worse is the service.. Waiter forgets to serve plates and spoons..forgets to bring the chatni along with the kebabs.. You have to repeatedly shout for help..the only words the waiters keep ranting is " sorry madam mistake hoy geche"

Recently went there for lunch and I must say that I was impressed. Beautiful ambience, quiet atmosphere and soft lighting. The staff was attentive. Ordered Murgh Banjara Kebab, which was amazing. Hyderabadi Dum Biriyani wasn't a disappointment either; loaded with flavours and with tender pieces of mutton. The Nizami Biriyani was also good. Overall, it was a great experience.

The best thing about this place is the ambience they welcome you with! Nicely decorated and spacious. The food was good too.. especially the Keema nun and the Mohini nun.. the Hyderabadi biriyani we ordered has good flavour and is one of the best I tasted till date! The chicken dishes we ordered were well cooked and soft! Chicken Lahori specifically was very soft and light! Good on taste too! The galauti kababs we tried as starters were the best though! The proce is reasonable too! Went out for 31st Dec lunch with friends and did have a good time!

The Palms Restaurant is conveniently located at Southern Avenue, right above Cafe Coffee Day. It is very easy to reach the restaurant as it is just a 5 minutes walk away from Gate number 3 of Kalighat metro station. The entrance to the restaurant has a beautifully illuminated flight of stairs leading up to the main entrance. As you enter the restaurant, the first thing that catches your eyes is a beautiful, small fountain right in front of you. The restaurant is quite spacious and the decor is tastefully done up in cream, black, brown and white. The ambience is soothing and inviting and the lovely background music adds on to the experience. Food and service is top notch. Both their Indian and Oriental menus are equally good and the restaurant truly has a lot to offer. Our menu consisted of Chicken Hot and Sour Soup, Bang Bang Prawns, Raw Banana Pepper Salt, Mutton Shammi Kebab, Chicken Kalmi Kebab, Mandarin Fish, Missi Roti, Sarson ka Saag, Peshawari Naan, Fish Hara Punjabi, Mutton Rarah, Hyderabadi Biryani, Gajar ka Halwa, Honey Darsaan and Ice Lychees. Each and every dish was well prepared and the quality and quantity of food was completely satisfying. Hence, highly recommended.

Nice experience, good food, service was good
But the owner behaviour towards her staff was extremely bad......
Humanly it was not possible to listen to the languages she was using during the working hours..... 
We visited the restaurant around 7.30 or 8....
We requested the waiter to change our seat just because of that lady....
FYI: To the ‚Äúlady‚Äù FIRST LEARN PROPERLY HOW TO BEHAVE WITH UR STAFF..... IT IS BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY ARE THE CHAMPIONS OF UR RESTAURANT.
Stop sending those filthy introductory offer sms for foods. ANY WAYS NOT GOING TO VISIT

Few days back I made my first visit here. It was a very good experience altogether. We ordered the following:
1. Raw Banana Pepper Salt: This dish was unique among all the dishes we ordered. Tasted very good.
2. Kalmi Kebab: The chicken was very soft and delicious. A must try.
3. Mandarin Fish: The fish was succulent and tasted amazing.
4. Peshawari Naan: The naan had almonds sprinkled over it and tasted amazing.
5. Fish Harapunjabi: I totally loved this. It was green in color  and the taste was on point.
6. Sarso ka Saag: This dish was going very well with the naan.
7. Mutton Rarah: I am a mutton-lover and this item was delectable.
8. Honey Darsaan: This was the usual darsaan but was srved with caramel. Classic dessert.
9. Ice Litchis: A very unsual dessert with ice-cream and litchis stuffed with dessicated coconut blended with jaggery. The best end one could have with this.
The ambience here is pretty good and they serve a lot of onion with the Indian food which is the best thing in this place.

Coming to the food, I'm very pleased with it. Wonderful service, and delectable spread of Indian and Oriental cuisine. The kebabs especially were delicious, and my favourite was the Sarson Makai ka Saag with Missi Roti! Total love!! The Bang Bang Prawns, Raw Banana Salt n Pepper were yummy too, as were the Mandarin Fish, Fish Harapunjabi and of course the Rarah Mutton alongside the Peshwari Naan! Ended the meal on a sweet note with some Gajar ka Halwa!!!¬†I hope to go back again and enjoy another fulfilling meal in a pleasing atmosphere.

Just few minutes walking from Kalighat Metro station, The Palms Restaurant is Heaven on earth with it‚Äôs wide range of both Continental and Indian Cuisines. As soon as you enter this place, you‚Äôd feel like you‚Äôre transported to a special place with it‚Äôs lighted stairs and brilliant decor. Coming to the food, it was sumptuous and divine to say the least. Everything, from the Raw Banana Pepper Salt to the Shami Kebab and Kalmi kebab in the starters were brilliant ! For Main Course I loved the Mutton Rarah, Fish Harapunjabi and the Mandarin Fish the most. I also tried the Hyderabadi Biryani which was tasty. As accompaniments I had the Misi Roti and the Peshawari naan which were perfect !
And for desert, a must have is the Ice Lychee ! It‚Äôs gobsmackingly tasty ! All in all this place is a must try for all and one of the best in town ! Enjoy !

Went there recently for dinner. Located in Southern avenue,this place is very easy to find. The ambience was too good,especially the lighting and other aspects. 
We had ordered Raw Banana Pepper Salt,Bang Bang Prawn,Mutton Shami Kabab,Kalmi kabab,Mandarin Fish,Fish harapunjabi,Mutton Rarah,Peshawari Naan,Sarso ka saag,Misi Roti and Hyderabadi Biryani.
We also took Gajar ka halwa,Honey Darshan and Ice lychees. 
The food was amazing and all the dishes were excellent both in look and taste. The mutton was very soft and melted in the mouth. The biryani was also very tasty and coming and I liked the Mandarin Fish A LOT. Among the dessert my favourite was the gajar ka halwa and the honey darshan. I loved the food there and thus will recommend strongly.

The thought of visiting PALM as it was on my wishlist but my experiences¬†were not so good enough for that day.
Starter and soup were good as I really liked it and for the main course ordered Hyderabadi Mutton Biriyani¬† and the two pieces were too small according to the price. Also ordered fresh lime soda and the taste was not so good which we have returned.¬†

Note: Management needs to check the staff behavior.¬†

Food was tasty, fresh, excellently spiced and rightly cooked. Both Indian and Asian cuisines were quite endearing as far as we forayed. Sweetness of dessert again was pleasant on our palate.¬†
Mocktails could have looked neater and tasted more refreshing.¬†

This is a good value for money place sans any sleaze. Waiters worked hard and were generally soft spoken except an occasional once or twice slip of tongue moments.¬†
On the whole, a good experience.

This restaurant is on the first floor, below is CCD on Southern Avenue. The location is easy to find out. The decor is very pleasing but I found their sofas bit uncomfortable as the tables get too high while seated. We ordered for Tomato Dhaniya Shorba, Murg Banzara, Nizami Biriyani and Sizzling Brownie with ice-cream and chocolate sauce. Among all these my favorite was Murg Banzara. It was served with pudina and mayo dips. This kebab was absolutely of melt-in-the-mouth type. They serve raita with the biriyani. The biriyani was OK. I found the pricing a bit high and their service too needs little improvement.

Located above the ccd outlet, right where southern avenue connects with rashbehari, is this plush restaurant, beautifully decorated serving heart-warming food. I went there to try the non-veg combo meal (INR 420/person) which includes 1 starter, 1 main and side and 1 dessert. Choices galore, I chose to have murgh banjara, peas pulao with chicken handi and finally gulab jamun. Every dish was cooked to perfection and the staff wes attentive. The combo meals are available from 12 noon to 5 pm on weekdays (except holidays) and you just cannot miss this soul-satisfying experience if you are in the area!

We ordered lime soda as a ending drinks,it was smelling badly...we had a doubt about the syrup quality,it might be out of date...firstly they ignored it and add chat masala to cover up the smell..which was more pathetic...we declined the lime soda finally...they even counted lime soda in the bill,we told them,then they cut up the value..bad experience we had...sorry to give such ngtv xprnc...

Visited this resto in the occation of my birthday and it relay made my day nd the whole crdt goes to my gf who has selected this restro.frst of all Ambience is awsm though the light decor is littl bit luminous. Watevr, we have odered mutton koobideh and kasundi mahi as starter. Both were realy too good escpcly the koobideh. In the main course we hv kasmiri pulao nd mutton raarah. Kasmiri polau was just awsm and the mutton side dish as well, raarah is too spicy. Lastly we hv icecrm with dry fruits which actualy disappntd me as there was two scoops of icecrm with very very little amount of some nuts over it. Newy ovral supr xprnce and thnx to my ‚ô•Ô∏è

Food was tasty, fresh, excellently spiced and rightly cooked. Both Indian and Asian cuisines were quite endearing as far as we forayed. Sweetness of dessert again was pleasant on our palate.¬†
Mocktails could have looked neater and tasted more refreshing.¬†

This is a good value for money place sans any sleaze. Waiters worked hard and were generally soft spoken except an occasional once or twice slip of tongue moments.¬†
On the whole, a good experience.

This restaurant is on the first floor, below is CCD on Southern Avenue. The location is easy to find out. The decor is very pleasing but I found their sofas bit uncomfortable as the tables get too high while seated. We ordered for Tomato Dhaniya Shorba, Murg Banzara, Nizami Biriyani and Sizzling Brownie with ice-cream and chocolate sauce. Among all these my favorite was Murg Banzara. It was served with pudina and mayo dips. This kebab was absolutely of melt-in-the-mouth type. They serve raita with the biriyani. The biriyani was OK. I found the pricing a bit high and their service too needs little improvement.

Located above the ccd outlet, right where southern avenue connects with rashbehari, is this plush restaurant, beautifully decorated serving heart-warming food. I went there to try the non-veg combo meal (INR 420/person) which includes 1 starter, 1 main and side and 1 dessert. Choices galore, I chose to have murgh banjara, peas pulao with chicken handi and finally gulab jamun. Every dish was cooked to perfection and the staff wes attentive. The combo meals are available from 12 noon to 5 pm on weekdays (except holidays) and you just cannot miss this soul-satisfying experience if you are in the area!

They have launched a new combo meal for both veg and non-veg.

Coming to the main course.
Karachi paneer sabzi was spicy and perfect for spicy food lovers.
Veg kholapuri sabzi was sweet and was perfect with
Jeera rice.

I had gone to try the combo menu option at the plams which is in southern avenue. The combo options are only available from 12 to 5 and it is a combination of a three course meal. I chose the non veg option which had 4 options in starters, 4 in main course and 2 in desserts. You can choose one from all.
I tried the mahi ajwani which is a fish starter and it tasted amazing.
In main course I tried the chicken handi which was equally good.
Dessert you can choose between ice cream and gulab jamun.
Overall the place is great, with excellent ambience and the quantity was enough for one person.
The non veg.combo was charged at rs 420.

I would not recommend this place for anyone. I just don't know how this place got a rating above 4. The ambience is not up to the mark. Staff not trained at all. Items on menu not available. Staff is not attentive. You order something and something else arrives. Food is just average. Nothing great at all to eat and spend your hard earn money. I would not visit a second time. Only dessert was good.

Firstly, we ordered a starter which was galawati kebab(6pcs)
Then for the main course we ordered murgh peshwari, keema naan, american chopsuey, crispy chicken boneless and butter naan.
The food was great.
Overall, a nice restaurant in a very reasonable budget.

The existing rating is actually enough to indicate the brilliance of The Palms. Amazing food, an elegant decor and the brilliant service makes it highly recommendable. Cheese Garlic Naan is something to look out for. I visited there with a friend of mine and both of us preferred a hole in our pockets than missing out on the 2nd plate of cheese garlic naan. Another dish worth recommending is Gosht Rarha, an innovative dish prepared by using a  gravy of Mutton Keema along with the tender pieces of the meat.

We took galouti kebab both veg and mutton thereafter. The veg one was better. For mains, it was nehari with keema naan. The nehari was fantastic.

Tried their new offer menu (NON-VEG Combo) for 420 inclusive of all taxes
That is valid from 12-5 pm.
Ordered Banjara in the starters
It was a Chicken kebab perfect for the taste buds. 
For the main course, ordered Murgh Harapyaaz with Veg Pulao . The chicken was quite tender and flavoursome and the rice was soft and perfect with the curry.
For dessert ordered a chocolate icecream.
It was very nicely presented.
Ordered for a blue lagoon drink separately .
It wasn‚Äôt a part of the combo.

Food - i was here for lunch with some of my friends and had a lovely experience. For starters we ordered panko fried fish, sliced lamb in celary chinese green and murg banjara. All the three items were drool worthy. Special mention of the panko fried fish *recommended*. For main course we ordered veg nawabi pulao, kandhari bhuna, fish hyderabadi, peahawari naan and dal makhani. The fish and bhuna were the best of it‚Äôs kind. The peshawari naan is again *recommended*.
We ended it with gulab jamun which was perfectly balanced and my favourite honey darsaan.

Ambience - Nice decor and good cozy environment. 

Service - Helpful attendants. Lovely service. 

Rates - Appropriate.

A restaurant tucked in the lanes of southern avenue serves excellent food with superb presentation. I entered inside and said to myself.."yes this is what I have booked myseld for", such is the ambience and feel of the restaurant.
Tried their hara bhara kebab and stuffed mushrooms for starters and both were perfectly made with oozing flavours. 
For main course, I was surprised and floored by Subz dulhari, recommended by the owner herself. And I can't thank her enough for her choice. That was the best sabzi I've had in a really long time in any north Indian restaurant. A combination of different vegetables sauted in a tomato based Curry and decorated with a spinach gravy on the side. Even the dal makhani was really really good, accompanied by a bunch of different breads.
The desserts were the best part of the lunch. The honey glazed darsaan with vanilla ice cream was the best darsaan I've had so far. Perfectly crunchy and perfectly sweet. Also, the gulab jaamun was aptly hot and soft. 
Overall, loved the entire experience, the service, the ambiance , the food and the vibe ! 
Highly recommended!

Went to this really beautiful place located at Southern Avenue, Kolkata. Not very difficult to locate, its a 2-3 min walking distance from Kalighat metro Gate No. 03. It's situated on the 1st floor of the building just above CCD. 
As soon as you enter this place you'll find a really pretty staircase with some beautiful lighting‚ù§Ô∏è.
The interiors are very well decorated and organised. It has a really calm ambience with some soft music paying in the background. Also, it has got some really cozy and comfortable seating  which is a big yay‚úåüèªÔ∏è.
This place serves various kinds of Asian, Awadhi, North Indian and Mughlai cuisines. 
And, I must say they have got a really wide variety of dishes to offer be it veg or non-vegüòÄ.
The service was really good and fast. The staffs were very courteous and helped out in suggesting the best dishes to us. 
Also, it was so sweet of the owner of the restaurant to head to each table and make sure they have a great time. 
Coming on to the food-
For starters we ordered, 
1. "Murgh Banjara" succulent chicken breast marinated in lemon juice, besan and yoghurt cooked in tandoor.
2. "Royal Harabhara Kebab" which was a perfect mixture of cottage cheese and other seasonal vegetables along with palak in a perfect spice blend.
3. Panko Crumbed Fish- This is something which I'll surely suggest you to order coz its simply amazingüòç.
4. Sliced Lamb in Celery Chinese Green.
5. Stut Butter Mushroom. Being a fan of mushrooms this dish totally won my heart‚ù§Ô∏è.
Main Course-
1. "Kandhari Bhuna" which was a boneless mutton dish cooked in rich tomato gravy added to fried baby onions. We ordered this along with
2.  "Peshawari Naan" which was super yummyüòç.
3. "Fish Hyderabadi" bhetki in coconut based gravy which I totally loved and had this along with
4.  "veg nawabi pulao"
Drinks- 
1. Green Apple Mojito
2. Lemon Basil Leaves Mojito
3. Coke Sangria which was my favourite‚ù§Ô∏è.
Desserts-
1. Gulab Jamun stuffed with fresh dry fruits.
2. Honey Darsan topped with 1 scoop of vanilla Ice-Cream but we went for 3 scoops of vanilla Ice-cream. This one was totally fantasticüëåüèª
Overall, it was a really great experience dining at this place and would totally suggest you guys to go and visit them with your friends or family. You are surely gonna fall in love with this place‚ù§Ô∏è.

Located in southern avenue, this is a multi cuisine restaurant with beautiful interiors and amazing food.

First i had Coke sangria , a mocktail as interesting as its name. You would never know how refreshing it was till u try it.

For starters i had -

Royal harabhara kabab - a blend of palak, cottage cheese and seasonal vegetables . It is very soft and each bite will make u long for more.

Khumb nawabi - the potatoes and cottage cheese add to the flavour of mushroom in ways beyond one's imagination.

For the main course we ordered

Veg dulhari - Mushroom , baby corn and cottage cheese blended with onion, palak and spices with butter adding to the aroma and taste.

Dal makhani - This was no ordinary dal . It was so creamy and delicious. Tasted best with masala kulcha.

Peshawari naan - The sweetness due to coconut was a surprise to us. Very delicious.

Masala kulcha - Tasted the perfect masala kulcha here after a long long time.

Veg nawabi pulao - The rice was so filling with assorted veggies and cashew . Looked nawabi for sure.

Deserts are always love . Here i tried

Honey darshan with 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream - it was one of the best dashan i have had. Very tasty and so relishing.

Gulab jamun - HOT gulab jamun with cashews is a heavenly dessert after a heavy meal. With the gulab jamuns so soft , they were just melting in the mouth.

An elegant fine dining, specializing in two most popular cuisines - North Indian & Oriental. The food here is brilliant and with such a widespread of dishes on the menu you are pretty much spoilt for choices. We opted to try out a bit from both cuisines.

In mocktails I'd recommend - 
‚Ä¢Coke Sangria - a mix of coke with fruit juices, mainly pomegranate. This is a really soothing drink and tastes almost as good as a cocktail.
‚Ä¢Lemon Basil leaves mojitos - Mesmerisingly refreshing drink and you're bound to love it. 
Coming to the food we had - 
‚Ä¢Panko crumb fish - Delicious & perfectly crunchy fried fish. The fish really melts in your mouth.
‚Ä¢Sliced Lamb in Celery Chinese green - Absolutely delish, and in fact this is the softest lamb I've had in a while. The gravy was very well cooked & lamb pieces were really juicy.
‚Ä¢Kandhari Bhuna - Soft and succulent boneless mutton cooked in tomato gravy. This is a must try.  The flavours go so well and the mutton is cooked to perfect consistency. Tastes delicious along with any Indian Bread. 
‚Ä¢Fish Hydrabadi - Big portions of bhetki fish in coconut based gravy. The gravy was flavourful and the portions of the fish is really appreciable.
‚Ä¢Peshawari Naan - A Naan with dried fruit and coconut filling.
‚Ä¢Masala Kulcha - the usual. Soft and tasty. 
Lastly for desserts, we had -
‚Ä¢Honey Darsaan - crispy and delectable dish and it was really sweet of the staff to serve us with extra complimentary ice cream scoops along with it. 

The ambience is very relaxing, with some soft instrumental music playing in the background. The decor of the place is chic and classy with comfortable seating. The staff members are courteous and served really well. Special mention to the restaurant owner Priyadarshini Dey, who took the liberty to help us with the order and also made sure we had a good time. The hospitality provided is really touching. 

Every dish was cooked to perfection. This exquisite diner is undoubtedly a must visit. Hoping to come here again to try out the other delicacies on their menu.

Located near Kalighat Metro Station and towards the end of Southern Avenue, The Palms is on the 1st floor of the CCD. It is a gem of a restaurant and serves amazing food. Their interior is simple yet elegant.

Entering the restaurant, we ordered some coolers such as Coke Sangria and Green Apple Mojito. These two coolers set our expectations real high. Then we ordered Stir Fried Lamb in Celery and Chinese Greens and their famous dish Panko Crumb Fish. The lamb pieces were finely cooked with lots of vegetables. For main course, we ordered Kandhari Bhuna and Fish Hyderabadi along with Peshawari Naan and Veg Nawabi Pulao. Kandhari Bhuna which is a mutton dish, tastes best with naans; whereas Fish Hyderabadi would go well with rice items. Peshawari Naan was cooked with coconut and hence it had a nice sweet taste. In the end, we had Gulab Jamun and Honey Darshan which usually has 1 scoop of ice cream. We preferred vanilla icecream over chocolate.

We were so happy with the food quality and quantity that we will surely visit this place again. Do not miss Panko Crumb Fish and Kandhari Bhuna if you are a non-vegetarian and love mutton. It's one of the best mutton dishes I've ever had.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

The palm turned two this October and I was more than happy to be joining in for celebration.

What started with alluring mocktails ended with soul warming Date Pan Cakes!
Palms has an amazing range of mocktails- Cinderella, Pink Island, Palms special Mojita, MudlePudle and so on. Each of them has a unique taste of their own and will exceed your imaginations when it comes looks.

Coming to the food now.
The palms offer an Indian menu and an equally impressive oriental menu.
Few stars off the menus include Wasabi prawns, Murgh Banjara, Mahi Pahadi, Khumb galauti kebabs (an excellent take on vegetarian galauti), Lambs in Peking Style , chicken meifoon, Ghost Achari and Subz Dilkhush, onion palak rice.
I won't be doing justice to the dish if I don't take a special mention of the Wasabi Prawns, an absolute masterpiece with the Tenderness of prawns and the strong punch of wasabi!
If you ask me what makes a meal compete? I would reply with Desserts!
The Date Pan Cakes here are out of the world. A dish very high on the recommendation list!
Sugargasm at its best!

Went there for lunch.
This is where Southern Avenue begins, same building as CCD.
Regular family restaurant decor, but with ornate walls and a trio of weird statues of men holding a fork, knife and spoon respectively.
Adds a bit of uniqueness to the place.
The sofas are too cozy for comfort. They sink in so deep that you have to really strain your back to sit up straight and eat comfortably.

The food.
We were a group of eight people.
Ordered Malkhani Karahi, Khar Khar Lamb, Prawn Tempura and Panko Fish for starters. Delicious, all of them, especially the tempura. Also the lamb, with a look, taste and texture similar to ribs, but drier and more fibrous.

For the main course, we ordered Chicken Green Thai Curry, Mixed Hakka Noodles, Mixed Fried Rice, Kung Pao Chicken and Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce. The Kung Pao Chicken is undoubtedly one of the best available in the city. The fish too, probably the softest I've ever had, with just the right amount of ingredients. And the gravy wins you over.

For dessert, we had Date Pancakes and Iced Leechies. The pancakes alone are worth 5 stars.

Highly recommended.

Tried out Biryani and Tandoori chicken. The biryani tasted a bit different unlike the other traditional ones and the Tandoori was tasty. The staffs are well behaved and friendly. Great ambience!

Located quite near the kalighat metro station this is the place you need to be if you want an awesome dining experience at reasonable prices. I went with a couple of my friends.
The ambience is superb and on entering the stairs upstairs were lighted pretty well. The decor was awesome with a fountain being the main attraction. The service was quick and staff courteous.
Coming to the food for starters we had the Prawn tempura fish which was a delicacy. It was followed by the Khar Khar lamb which also was superb. The Panko fried fish is a personal favourite. The Makhani karahi ended things on a positive note.
For the main course we had Mixed fried rice and Hakka noodles. These when combined with the Kung Pao chicken and the Fish in hot garlic sauce made quite the combo . The quantity as well as the quality of food was amazing.
For deserts we tried the Date Pancakes and the Iced lichi both of which were pretty good.
This place definitely deserves a visit.

If you want to experience a fine dining experience without burning a hole in your pocket this is the place to be at . 

The ambience is surreal . Very posh and has a very positive vibe about it . Well lit and very clean . The seatings are extremely comfortable . 

We were getting hungry , so without wasting any time we ordered food . We tried their Oriental menu and I would not be wrong stating that it was one of my best lunch experiences . 

‚ö´Ô∏èPrawn Tempura : A prawn lover cant say no to this . One of the best I have ever tasted . 
‚ö´Ô∏èKhar Khar Lamb : Lamb at its best . Had a very unique flavour which enhanced it's taste . 
‚ö´Ô∏èPanko Fried Fish : This has to be ordered whenever you be there . A hot favourite üòç RECOMMENDED . 
‚ö´Ô∏èMakhani Karahi : These are Chicken kebabs basically and are good . 

Coming to the mains , 

‚ö´Ô∏èKung Pao Chicken : This needs no description . Very few restaurants go wrong with this and Palms was two steps ahead . BRILLIANT . 
‚ö´Ô∏èFish in Hot Garlic Sauce : Was a bit hesitant of trying this because I hate anything related to Garlic . But trust me , I loved it more than the Chicken dish . Yesss üòçüòç . RECOMMENDED . 
‚ö´Ô∏èMixed Fried Rice and Hakka Noodles : Both the rice and noodles were very good with sufficient amount of Prawns and chicken . 

Desserts next , 

‚ö´Ô∏èIced Lychee : Super good . Tried this particular dessert for the first time and didn't regret . 
‚ö´Ô∏èDate Pancakes : What do I say about this one ? These are the best date pancakes I have ever had . Has to be the best . Most Recommended .‚ù§‚ù§

Location: Southern Avenue, 5 mins walk from Kalighat Metro Station.

I was here with a group of friends for a lunch and we really loved everything from the deƒáor to the food and also the service.

Ambience and Deƒáor: The ambience is good upon entering the lighting on the stairs is nice and the decƒáor is simple yet very elegant.

Food:

Starters:

Prawn Tempura: Crispy on the outside,soft and moist on the inside.Very flavourful,served with a lovely  dip which made it even better.

Khar Khar Lamb: This was my favourite,really flavourful lamb,perfectly cooked.I loved it.

Panko Fish: These were also really good served with an amazing soy dip which added to the taste.

Malchani Karahi: This item also tasted really good.

Main Course:

Mixed Fried Rice: Good quantity was served and the taste was equally good with lots of chunks of chicken and prawns.

Fish In Hot Garlic Sauce: The gravy was really tasty and large pieces were served so it was filling as well as yummy at the same time.

Kung Pao Chicken: Again large pieces of chicken were served and the taste was decent as well.

Desserts:

Date PanCakes: The perfect ending to a good meal,a scoop of vanilla ice cream served with yummy date pancakes which were perfectly sweet.Lovely.


Service:

The service was quick the staff were courteous and very attentive.


Overall an amazing place to dine with your friends or family. Highly Recommended.

The food was nice..but had a touch of Bengali flavours even in Indian food.we ordered Punjabi style fish but it had mustard ...then the chicken resume was little hard to chew..the fish in red gravy was vvv soft..just melt in mouth..very nice...the mutton roganjosh was v tender and good..and the dal tadka called hamari khaas dal told them specifically to make little.less spicy but it was spicy..anyway it was OK..the naan and roti was above avg..a good place cam visit once.but names of dishes are little difficult and options few for typical Indian food...well would love to try out their Chinese amd contintal the next time.

Amazing would be an understatement. We ordered a Murgh Banjara, Hyderabadi Biryani, Nizami Biryani and a Nihari. All of the items were spot on and the meat pieces were succulent with the perfect amount of spices.
The Hyderabadi Biryani was the best Biryani that I have had in this city. It was extremely hot and spicy but was also imparting a refreshing taste with its pudina and coconut flavours. 

Would I like to go again? Absolutely yes. The Hyderabadi Biryani is a dish that must be experienced again and again.

Whenever I used to visit southern avenue this place always caught my attention... When I finally went there for lunch the first thing which grabbed my attention was the interior decoration. It instantly gave royal vibes. Soothing music playing in the background and a cozy place to sit, the perfect place to dine out. For starters we ordered khar khar lamb, makhani karahi, panko fish and sprite. Each and every dish was made to it's perfection. The fish, crispy outside and perfectly cooked inside made a lasting impression. Makhani karahi and khar khar lamb were equally good.
For main course we ordered chicken green Thai curry and rice. The Thai curry, definitely a showstopper, Is a must have in this place.
Be it lunch or dinner, it forever remains incomplete without desserts and for dessert we ordered date pancakes which tasted average.
Considering the service and the taste of the food this place definitely deserves a 5 rating and is a must visit.

This is one of the fine restaurants which stands out among the many great theme ones that have so recently opened in Kolkata. The simplicity and elegance of the decor caught my eyes first. We were welcomed warmly, so the service is courteous and quite hospitable. We went there for lunch one afternoon and the food left us really satisfied.

We started with starters -
 Khar khar lamb, makhani karahi, panko fried fish. Khar khar lamb was of shredded lamb in bbq sauce and sprinkled with sesame seeds. This was the best among the starters we tasted, it was absolutely delicious cooked to perfection.
Makhani karahi was chicken kebab, was made well. And panko fried fish was again, delicious.. It was soft in the middle, crispy on the outside and the dip was perfect. I was quite satisfied with the starters

The main course consisted of Thai chicken green curry. This was made deliciously. I liked the distinct flavour of lemongrass in the green curry.

For desserts we had Iced lychee and date pancake. I liked the date pancake, it was something nice and new for me. The iced lychee looked as pretty as it tasted.

Overall I really liked the lunch. This is a feel-good place where you would like to take your family to, or have a get together.

I have been to many restaurants in South Kolkata but there is something special about this place which will make you visit The Palms again. 
Usually a restaurant is judged for the food served but there are only some where the ambience and the service enhances the experience. Moreover there are very few restaurants who serve the veg as well as the non veg food with equally good taste and this place is one among those. 
We like to visit this place quite often and hence this is a general review of the past experiences. Among the starters we usually order from the Indian section because this place really serves nice kebabs and Indian Tandoor starters ( Peshawari and Achari Dahi Tikka). Additionally the crispy American corn is well prepared and tasty.
What I find more interesting is the main course section. We had ordered Maharaja Kofta, Dal Bukhara, Crispy Fried Babycorn in Soya Sauce and Veg Garlic fried rice. The presentation of all the dishes were superb. The kofta, cut into two halves, had the taste of both the gravy and the stuffing. The dish looked colorful and tasty as well. The Daal Bukhara and the Paneer Maskawala were also nicely prepared and presented. The Continental main course was the best of all. The crispy babycorn and the medium spicy gravy of Manchurian were a perfect combination for the fried rice.
Finally we ordered Sizzling Brownie with Vanilla Ice crream and Date pancake with Ice cream. The former was yummy and was my favorite while the latter was bit too sweet. 
I love the interiors and the courteous staff here who regularly ask for reviews about the taste of the food. Although I could not post any photos this time, I am sure I will be visiting the restaurant soon to click some as this place is now in my regular visit list.

I celebrated my birthday here. It is absolutely a classy, glorious and well decorated restaurant filled with full of positivity. They have two different menu outlets. I chose the oriental one and ordered some of the mouth watering dishes. It all started with the chicken sweet corn soup, and dry cooked fish finger as the starter. The fish had it's own class and we literally digged onto it. Coming to the main dish, we ordered Thai chicken fried rice and Stir fried chicken kung- po style. Taste was great. No birthday can end without a sweet craving right? So I ordered for a sizzling brownie in the end. It was served hotty hot. And I mean really hot. Overall it was a lovely experience.. I am surely gonna come back here next time. I almost forgot to mention on a good note that the staff are very well behaved and joyous in their service. Top notch. I am coming back. Are You?

The palms has offered a buy 1 get 1 free offer on "selected menu". They told us because of a broken oven they could not serve a few dishes from this "selected menu".
We ordered a Manchow soup üçú  and Fish fingers before we fixed our main course. The soup was too watery, the mushrooms were raw and the manchow was too thick.
The fish fingers were oily enough to leave a good enough residue on the plates it came in. This was enough for us to decide to leave the hotel. We asked for the cheque paid and left.

A customer exercising an offer should not be taken for granted.

** Location = Southern Avenue, Kolkata, just beside the CCD.

**Brief = It was Saptami night and we were 5 humongously hungry souls searching for some delighful food to relish our tastebuds and also letting our stomach rats rest in peace and Zomato came to the rescue and the favourable ratings of this place made us opt to have dinner there. We reached there at around 10 PM and there were probably 25 people ahead of us and the boy managing the que was naturally bewildered and thereafter the lady came to our rescue and we were seated in a jiffy.

** Ambiance = Ambiance was pretty calm and soothing, proper lightings and adequate space. The servers were too much friendly and prompt with their service.

** Things tried = They probably had a separate menu for the Pujas, and we opted for both Chinese and Indian options.

We ordered Chicken Schezwan Fried Rice, Hunan Chicken, Tandoori Rotis, Chicken Kali Mirch, Butter Chicken, Malai Kofta and soft drinks.

The quality and quantity both were upto the mark. I am not sure whether Butter Chicken is available in their regular menu, but it is one of the best butter chicken I have had and full marks to them for that. The other items were also delicioulsy made and finally our hunger pangs were duly satisfied.¬†

** Purse Check = Our Bill was total around Rs.2500/-

**Overall = We had a lovely time there owing to the courteous behaviour of the staffs and the food was real good. Looking forward to visit the place soon.

After much planning we went to The Palms for a family dinner. I have heard loads about the place and yes, the place had matched my expectation. The ambience was good, service was impeccable and the food was finger-licking good. We had ordered Tandoori Murgh(Full), Murgh Peshawari, Nihari, Veg Nawabi Pulao, Keema Naan,  Methi Partha and a couple glasses of Fresh Lime Soda. The quantity of food was perfect to suffice four of us. And, the price is worth mentioning. Its cost-effective! It was a delightful family dinner.

Seeing such a high rating we decided to visit this restaurant. The restaurant is very large and spacious. We chose a seat towards the front of the restaurant which gives a great site of the lake view road through the glass windows. The interiors are great and an overall ambience which is not at all bad, also promises good food. We ordered galawati kebab for starters. The kebabs just melted in our mouths.  They tasted perfect. We could have gone for some other kebabs as well but their tandoor was out of service. For the main course we ordered nizami biriyani, murgh zafran biriyani and a side dish of murgh musallam. Nizami biriyani which is a bit spicier than the zafran biriyani was very good. Murgh musallam was also good. The chicken was juicy. The fresh lime soda wasn't that good though. For the dessert we ordered ice cream with dry fruits and chocolate sauce was also not bad. Biriyani lovers must give a visit. It waa a good experience. All the best to the team. Hope to visit again.

The food's taste cannot be explained in words ...its just awesome. My cousin ordered a biryani which tasted quite good. The hakka noodles especially the chicken noodles tasted excellent. The decor is soothing and i loved the place. Their service is so good that despite of huge rush they served us very well. They looked after each and every customer with full care.

We went just after the durga puja. It was a nice place and the food was good too. We had lots of kebabs such as dehleez kebab, tandoori chicken,¬†joojeh kebab (their speciality), mahi pahari¬†etc. The dehleez kebab was really nice, clearly distinguishing the rich¬†flavours of mutton against chicken. mahi pahari, bhetki coated¬†with pudinha, was simple but fresh. joojeh kebab was a good to, the chicken pieces were soft and tender and juicy, loved that! But the tandoori chicken was a bit disappointing as parts of it were burnt and had become black and tasted awful. we ended with rice noodles (which was really good) and pan-fried chilly chicken, which I didn't like due to its pungent taste.

Well The Palms was in my bucket list for quite some time..and finally I was munching all the way finally. This restaurant is situated in Southern Avenue and it's quite easy to locate since it's a three minute walk from kalighat metro station. Coming to the food.. 
for starters we ordered : Makhani kadhai (a mind version of reshmi kebabs), Prawn tempura (crisp batter fried prawns), Panko Fish (crumb fried bhetki fillets) and here comes the speciality my favourite Khar Khar lamb ( tender lamb pieces tossed in Oriental sauces and sauted with bell peppers).
Main course: mixed hakka noodles , mixed fried rice, kung pao chicken and here comes the best of the lot..fish in hot garlic sauce (the taste was amazing)
Desserts: Date Pancakes (soft and fluffy...it just melts in the mouth...one should definitely try this) and iced lichee (you can go for this if you  are in for some experimentation..
We had soft drinks to accompany  the marvelous spread
Coming to the ambiance...its beautifull...well lit and spacious..and the staff was cordial...the overall experience was good and will definitely pay another visit for the sake of the lamb and those drooling pancakes.

Located in the posh southern avenue, this place attracted me when the interior was visible from the roads with the tables near the glass pane offering the city views.Tried this place yesterday and when I entered the place it felt good with a spacious dining hall and luckily got the chance to avail the table near the glass pane..
Coming to the review, the AC was initially not working well and it was a bit suffocating and also no music was played.It took half of the time for both the things to get normal but not upto the mark.Now the restaurant manager/representatives and the waiters were not adequate enough to handle the customers on the Sunday evening and the absence of the staffs was a reason unknown but still managed somehow which was disappointing as the waiting time for the food was quite long.
Now to the food we ordered,chilly squid was an unexpected disaster which tasted way below the normal road side pakodas(didn't know how to explain how it tasted)..rest of the food items we ordered such as Chicken Manchow,Chicken Hot and Sour soup,shredded hunan chicken,crash pepper prawn,pan fried chilly chicken and a drink deep sea was good.
Another highlighting point was only chinese cuisine was available and Indian,Tandoor items were unavailable which left us with very less options and cuisines to choose from.
Would next time avoid going there or give it an extra thought to give a chance to see them improve.

Saw the brilliant rating & reviews in zomato & tried the restaurant. Extremely sorry to say that the food was absolutely not up to the mark. The service was extremely sloppy. Couldn't imagine how this restaurant got such rave reviews & excellent rating. Makes me wonder whether the ratings have been rigged.

The paneer karachi over here is the one of the best paneer I ever had. It has the perfect mixture of spices. The starter Naram dil is also good.

It was my 2nd visit. It was Navami night. Previously I had food from Palms on a special day and they offered such a delicious food that I was going to give them rating 5 but on navami night it was a huge disappointment. I recommended lots of my friends and went there with them. But they have changed their whole menu. The menu was like road side Chinese and Indian restaurant. ¬†And when I asked for some signature dish of their restaurant, an old thin waiter replied "come on Monday, will give you everything." What kind of behavior was that? I was going to report that to the lady owner of the restaurant but ¬†as it was puja time I stopped myself. A standard restaurant of 4.6 or 4.8 rating never change their menu at least they do not change their signature dish. I visited many fine dining restaurant, none of them had changed their menu during puja. And more over this kind of behavior will obviously decrease their rating. ¬†So from my side for hospitality its 1 and for food its 2.

So I recently have visited this place quite a few times. Firstly what attracts you about this place is the ambience. The ambience of this place is very good and the staff is very well behaved. The staff gives you suggestions as to what you should try with what and that really helps . So we had the murgh zafran biryani, mohini naan and  murgh lahori. The biryani was very different from the usual biryani but it was very good and the quantity was enough for two people. The mohini naan was a bit of a dissapointment as there was no sign of egg spread on the naan, and moreover it was a little hard when served. I would advise you to go ahead with normal makhani naan. The murgh lahori was delicious. And for desserts we had gulab jamun which was again delicious. All in all except the mohini naan it was a good experience. Must try if you want to have dinner at a good restaurant, which is on a little expensive side.

Was drawn to this restaurant by the high ratings on Zomato, but felt somewhat let down after the experience. Yes, the service was warm and courteous throughout, but the quality of food disappoints. Tried quite a few dishes from their Indian/Mughlai section like the Galawti Kebab, various Naans, Dal Makhni, Mutton Nehari and the Mutton Biryani. Some of the items like the Naan and the Dal were decent, but nothing to go gaga about. Others, like the Nihari and Biryani were significantly below par. When you see the word Nihari on the Menu, you expect a gravy infused with bone marrow. But here there was no hint of that. The gravy lacked any flavour and the Mutton pieces had more bone than meat. I don't know whether their Thai section is any better or whether they were having an off day for some reason (we were there for lunch on a Sunday and were the only ones in an otherwise empty place, infact, they turned on the AC only after we entered), but based of this evidence, I would rank this restaurant significantly below other similarly priced restaurants in the city (Oudh 1590, Aaira, Kaafila etc.)

So we went there on Ashtami night. It's a lovely little cozy place. The reviews so far have been pretty good so I thought to myself, why not give it a go.

There were two of us, so upon arriving the managers were a little hessitant to arrange a table(that could easily sit 4) for just the two of us but upon assuring them that we'd change to a table for two if the need rises, they were pretty cooperative. Maybe it was cause of the puja rush.

We ordered a plate of Paneer Maskawala, 3 Tandori Roti and a plate of Chicken Noorari(was it called?). The service was pretty decent. The ambience was pretty good and food was also quite tasty. Looking forward to trying their buffet sometime soon. All in all, it was a good experience.

I can't figure it out from where to start because starting from the behaviour of their staffs,the food, ambience all were just mind-blowing.
I failed to capture pictures of the foods since they served as soon as the food was ready but I am attaching the picture of the cash memo to give you guys a idea of the foods which you should taste specially murgh mussalam,mutton gosht rarha,Mohini naan and cheese garlic naan.
Other items also tasted nice like konjee crispy chicken.

We went here yesterday for lunch. It is situated on the crossing of Southern Avenue and S.P Mukherjee Road just 3min walking distance from Kalighat metro. Ambience was just amezing. We sat on a cozy corner and loved the corner. Service was prompt. We ordered Fish Finger, Hyderabadi Biryani, Karai Chicken, Hot Gulabjamun, Fresh Lime soda. Fish Finger was something different here, they doesn't use breadcrumbs and tossed with spring onion, capsicum. Hyderabadi Biryani is generally spicy but here it was light but properly aromatic. Also Gulabjamun was super hot.Surely i'll visit again.

Located right at the Tollygunj end of Southern Avenue, on the first floor above a CCD outlet, this place isn't difficult to find at all. Inside, it is very spacious and has a remarkably comfortable seating. The seats adjacent to the large glass windows are the ones to specifically covet for. The ambience is calm and comfortable.
They serve both Oriental (Chinese/Thai/Japanese) as well as North Indian cuisines and both have equally impressive dishes. We tried :
Starters -
1. Joojeh Kebab : Nicely cooked yogurt marinated grilled chicken. (3/5)
2. Takrai Gai Chicken : A Thai dish, crispy fried pieces of chicken in a pleasant sweet and sour sauce, this is surely among the better things you can get here. (3.5/5)
3. Panko Fish : Nothing can go wrong with panko coated golden fried fish and they did nothing wrong indeed. (4/5)
4. Lamb in Chinese Greens : This one is a winner, the best thing I've tasted here. Juicy, tender yet enjoyably chewy giant shreds of lamb in it's less spicy and perfect umami glory, accompanied perfectly with the succulent, crunchy, pleasantly bitter greens. Highly recommended. (5/5)
Main Course -
5. Murgh Lahori : Creamy and flavorful, with generous amount of boneless chicken pieces, there is nothing to not love about this dish. (4/5)
6. Mutton Rarha : Well cooked pieces of on the bone lamb in a spicy gravy. (3/5)
7. Fish Amritsari : Generously portioned pieces of crispy fried fish coated in a super spicy thick curry. This would be pleasant if you're a mad lover of heat and spice. (3/5)
8. Keema Naan : Soft, thin naan with a spicy keema filling. Tasted good with a creamy salan like the lahori chicken. (4/5)
9. Mohini Naan : Springy, moist naan with an egg and herbs coat and generous dredges of ghee. Tastes better when warm. (3.5/5)
10. Kashmiri pulao : Lightly cooked, fruity, cheese garnished rice. A nice base to go with the variety of spicy salans they serve. (3/5)
Dessert :
11. Honey Darsan with Vanilla Ice cream : Crispy fried darsans drenched in honey and sprinkled with sesame for a pleasant texture, served with vanilla ice cream. It's a good way to finish a meal alright. (4/5)

Service was courteous and attentive. Would hope to see a more varied dessert menu. Also, they do not have anything for beverages apart from cans of aerated drinks. Would love to see some drinks on the menu in the next visit.
Overall, a good space to spend some nice time.

The Palms is well known for their top-notch service and quality of their food. Decoration being classy and sophisticated, this restaurant is located beside CCD, southern avenue crossing. I went there with my friends. We started off with Lamb in Chinese Green,Panko Fish,Chicken Takrai Gai and Joojeh Kebab.  Joojeh Kebab had a beautiful flavour while the Panko Fish is a combination of crispyness from the outside amd soft fresh fish fillet inside and i can assure that you will definately love this. Lamb in Chinese Green and Chicken Takrai Gai  had a beautiful aroma which will make you hungry- both are packed with flavour. Lamb was soft and the chicken was juicy. Each and every starters were mind-blowing and lip-smacking. Coming to the main course, we ordered Kashmiri Dry Fruit Pulao,Mohini Naan, Keema Naan, Mutton Rarha, Murg Lahori and Amritsari Fish.
Again the aroma of the rice was delightful. The pulao had a subtle taste. Keema Naan was quite good. Mohini Naan needs special mention for it was just out of this world. Soft naan with egg, spring onions and butter was pure heaven. With the combination of the sides, i felt like i was in heaven. Now coming to the sides, what i loved in the Amritsari Fish was  the freshness of the fish. It was soft and the balance of flavour was perfect. Murgh Lahori had a nice texture and flavour to it while the Mutton Rahra was rich and beautiful. For desserts, we have Darsaan with honey drizzle and vanilla ice cream. Crispy darsaan and ice cream are always a match made in heaven combination but what i liked about is the addition of honey. It just elevated the flavour of the darsaan. Loved it totally. I had a wonderful  time here. Everything is perfect here. The staffs take great care of your needs. Will definately visit this place again to try out more of their dishes.

This place is great for family lunches and dinners. The menu is divided clearly into the Indian and Chinese(and other South-East Asian cuisines) and it's very difficult to pick a side :)
I went here for a family lunch today and all of us enjoyed the food to our fullest.
For starters we ordered :
Joujeh(a chicken kebab dish)
Chicken Takrai-gai(Thai)
Lamb in Chinese greens.
Panko fish.

Each and every starter was full of wonderful flavours. The joujeh was a chicken kebab smoked to perfection. The panko fish was like the quintessential fish fry, but the flavours were leaning towards Oriental. The sweet-chilly dip served with it was a perfect accompaniment. The lamb dish was the ultimate 'soul food', with succulent pieces of lamb stewed in a light, broth-like gravy full of wilted Chinese greens. But, the star of the show was the Chicken Takrai-gai ; a robust Thai dish of crunchy bite-sized pieces of chicken in a delectable sweet and spicy sauce with the flavour of fresh lemongrass adding a different dimension to it.

For our mains we decided to stick to their Indian fare.
We ordered :
Mohini Naan
Keema Naan
Kashmiri Dry-fruit Pulao
Murgh Lahori
Maahi Amritsari 
Gosht Rarha

Aah, we were in culinary heaven. The Mohini Naan was 'beautiful', doing justice to it's name. It was extremely soft and pillowy. The Keema Naan was stuffer with a delectable Keema stuffing and complemented the gravy dishes quite well. The Polao too was full of rich dry fruits in every bite. The mutton rarha was closer to our Kosha Mangsho, with rich gravy clinging to the soft mutton pieces. The Lahori Murgh was subtly spiced and was a nice green colour. The fish was nice and flaky in a spicy, red gravy. Each and every dish was innovative and tasted great.

For dessert we ordered the honey darsaan with vanilla ice-cream. You can't really go wrong with this dessert. It was a bowl full of honeyed goodness, creating a wonderful effect on the palate.
I would recommend this place to every foodie out there, the food as well as the ambience and also the view from the huge glass window is a sure winner.

It was selected by my friend. So am totally unaware of the place. But thankfully it was upto the expectation. Nice ambiance, clean and tidy, comfortable sofas and even staffs were friendly. And for our lunch one staff (very bad of me that I didn't asked his name) helped us in food selection and for us even clicked few pictures on our request.
Coming to the menu they have Asian and Indian cuisines. So it's all upto your choice. We preferred for Thai cuisine.
We started with ‚óè Panko crumb fried fish. 4 pieces of fried fish, crunchy on top. Tender, fresh fish pieces were perfectly coated and fried that gave a tasty crunchy feel. We loved the dip provided with it.
‚óè Kumb Katiya prawn. Very very soft and perfectly spiced up prawns in a semigravy texture. The dish doesn't require noodles or rice. Not mandatory. I recommend this. You will love it.
‚óè Szechwan mixed fried rice. Quantity is sufficient for two and even the food quality. Shrimps, chicken pieces and eggs everything was in proportion.
‚óè Bhudas Delight. It's a veggie dish. Someone suggested my friend so thought to have it a try. Though it was an affair of vegetables but u gonna like it. Veggies in cube shaped.Tasty gravy. Spicy as well.
Overall it was a fantastic lunch. From decor to ambiance to service all were nice. Special credit for the chef and his team for presenting such delicious foods. A bill of rupees 1446 which u can't claim too expensive when quality of the food matters üëå

It was on chaturthi this year , almost close to midnight we found this restaurant thankfully open for dinner .I was dissapointed to know normal ala carte wasn't available, they had a pujo special menu which comprised of shortlisted items including indian and chinese , we opted for the latter. As they were near to closing hour , we were asked to place the order in one shot , we opted for PAN FRIED CHILLI FISH , CHILLI GARLIC CHICKEN NOODLES , PRAWN HAKKA NOODLES , HOT GARLIC FISH , KUNG PAO CHICKEN. Nothing was available for desserts except Icecream which we skipped. The food was all well cooked though we didn't find an exceptional stand out dish among these , but slightly overpriced specially the fish items. The decor wasn't as chic and dazzling as i came across pictures in social media but decent for semi fine dining with family people , the  sofa seating arrangements are undoubtedly comfortable. Try getting a table facing the road for an overall better experience.

Located nearly at the edge of Southern Avenue on the top of Cafe Coffee Day. I discovered this place from Zomato and gave it a try the same day. The ambience is impressive, super comfortable sofas and friendly staff.
For starters we had Royal Harabhara kebab and Crispy chilli golden corn. Both were up to the mark.
Main course-
Vegetables Dulhari- I never heard of this before and had this dish for the first time and I loved it. Vegetables cooked with onion and palak gravy.
Khumb Nawabi- Loved this mushroom dish with rich spices.
Chicken Lababdar- One of the best chicken dishes I've ever had. Soft pieces of chicken with rich white gravy.
I would love to come again and again and also recommend to my friends.

The Palms, located around Kalighat Metro, is another name for foodgasm.
Never been to a restaurant with better food presentation than this!

The food quality was marvelous! Had an Indian dish, rest all Oriental, really tasty but light, thus making it easy to digest! Also the interiors are really aesthetic and the staff very courteous!

Every dish we had was a treat both to the eyes and the taste buds! Special mention-The walnut toffee dessert, best I've ever had!
Go try this out soon!

Here's a list of the dishes we tried and loved-
Takrai gai
Prawn tempura
Kalmi kebab
Veg braised noodles
Tausi chicken
Walnut toffee dessert
Cinderella refresher

Mystical commitment!

Well, by the title only words were mystic in that moment, even the words printed on the menu. The moment was preplan, and traversed well, however not traveled. Thus, it was a juncture to design so we chose this place The Palms to ply the stage. Therefore, we adjured for Kasundi Mahi as starter in which Bhetki cubes are marinated in yogurt, mustard sauce and spice blend. It tasted inviting, though expected bit more fried. It might touched the tongue, however not the soul. And for main course we urged for Gosht Rarha with plain naan. In Rarha, chunks of mutton are served in rich keema gravy and that was toothsome. And it surrounded near the soul. 

The ambience was beautiful, you can get the view of Southern Avenue from this stage which include their brilliant stewardship. Therefore, indeed it was mystical. Go for it. You will adore it.

Located opposite to tollygunge police station , above the southern avenue CCD you can find this classy restaurant serving mouth watering delicacies. The place is spacious and wonderfully done. Getting settled in the cosy ambience we ordered

Nizami biriyani - The right amount of spices made it very different from the biriyani we usually taste , the biriyani was flavourful and light.

Kadhai chicken - Rich , thick creamy gravy was a perfect complement to the biriyani as suggested by the waiters , the chicken pieces were well marinated in the spices and tasted amazing.

Even on panchami we did not have to wait and the stuffs were very well mannered. Looking forward to try their Chinese section. :)

It is on the far end of Southern Avenue. The restaurant is okayish, right above Cafe coffee day outlet. Food quality is really good, but the service is not that professional. The washroom had a strong stench. We tried the veg seekh kebab for the starter and Thai red curry with steamed rice for the main course. A virgin mojito to gulp down. The portions were not that huge, very moderate and couldn't be shared between two people. The food quality though was real good. There were too many peanuts stuffed into the veg seekh kebab. The ambience of the restaurant is good.

Ambience is very relaxing. So the moment you enter you will get a good vibe about the restaurant. 
They specialize in 2 cuisines : North Indian and Oriental. 
What I ordered : 

Joojeh kebab -very soft with a nice smoky flavour. 

Panko crumb fried fish - nice crispy bite sized pieces

Prawn Tempura - light batter with fresh prawns. 

Gai Takrai Chicken - the best I felt. It has a nice lemongrass taste to it which is very refreshing. 

Mutton hyderabadi biriyani - good flavour. Not overwhelming flavours. Nice play on the palate. 

Makhani naan - the usual butter naan. Good quality. Not chewy. 

Veg Nawabi Pulao - was amazing. Very light. But the taste was on point. Beautifully made. 

Chicken Sagwala - shredded chicken dish. Good to go with breads and rotis. If you like your dish lightly seasoned then you would like this. 

Mutton Rogan josh - well cooked chunks of meat dunked in lots of tasty gravy. 

Date pancakes - doesn't look like the usual pancakea btw. They are crispy with a date filling. Taste is amazing. 

Darsan - the usual. Good taste. 

Definitely worth a visit.

This place had been on my bucket list for quite sometime and finally I made a visit. I must say that the decor and ambience of the place is outstanding. Service was also good.
                   We tried out the following items:-

‚Ä¢ Virgin Mojito- As usual this is a classic and super refreshing, loved it a lot.
‚Ä¢ Virgin Blue Lagoon- This is a personal favorite of mine and sure it did not disappoint.
‚Ä¢ Joojeh Kebab- The moment I had this kebab it became one of my favorites. I love kebabs a lot and can vouch for the fact that any foodie would fall in love with these.
‚Ä¢ Prawn Tempura- This dish, from the presentation to the quality, it was amazing.
‚Ä¢ Mutton Hyderabadi Biryani- Who doesn't love Hyderabadi Biryani? This was absolutely lip smacking. From the flavour to the taste to the quantity, it delivered in all aspects.
‚Ä¢ Gosht Rogan josh- This is another classic Indian dish and I totally loved it.
‚Ä¢ Date Pan cake- To end it all I had this dessert and it was great, totally loved it.

FINAL VERDICT- I highly recommend this place to all and simply cannot wait to visit again.

One of my favourites in the heart of the city .
The place is very easy to reach both through metro or other public transport.
Its pretty spacious and the ambience is awesome .
Nicely decorated and furnished to have a gothic feeling .
The food is excellent ,
For starters I had the joojeh kebab ...which was mouthwatering.
Then moved on with the panko crumb fried fish ....one of the best starters I ever had .
And the list ends with prawn tempura.
The main course was heavy and I sticked to indian cuisine.....
I had veg nawabi pulao,
Murgh sagwala,
Gosht rogan josh, fish hyderabadi along with hyderabadi biriyani which tqsted pretty good ..... This nearly made me full which was tickling taste buds .
Lastly we ended the lunch with desserts
Namely Date pan cake .
So if you havent tried this place its time you placed your bet on this .

A very nice place just located at Southern Avenue...
Each and everything in this place is upto the mark... Had 4 starters; but the best one was gai takrai chicken and joojeh kebab... The Nawabi Polau was awesome along with the Murgh Sagwala,ghost Rogan Josh and fish Hyderabadi... Had watermelon mojito and the honey darshan was the best one...

Location : Go straight from Golpark towards Kalighat metro via Southern Avenue... You will find it on your right side.

Ambience : Soothing and Comfortable.. Nicely decorated plus if you able to get your seat by the glass wall.. thats a bonus for you.

Food : We ordered 
a. Kebab platter : Good one.. contains 2 small piece of Chicken Tandoori, 2 pcs Mutton Sheek Kabab, 2 chunks of Bada kabab, 2 Pcs Grilled Prawn and 2 pcs Fish Hariyali Kabab.. Fish and Bada kabab , both r excellent... Price Rs. 495

b. Mixed Meat Fried Rice - Quantity is not huge but contains chicken and Prawn in a great quantity.. Rs. 180 (as i can remember)

c. Kung Pao Prawn : Quality of the prawn was excellent but taste of the preparation is okish.. nothing extraordinary.

Service : Bit slow.. but staffs are very cordial and helpful.. We were looking for Kolkata style Biriyani and thinking about Nizami Biriyani but staff told us not to opt for that as it is completely different from the one we were looking for.

    I'm giving them 4 coz no one can't be perfect and secondly they can't able to serve pork though it was mentioned in the menu card.

Palms is the perfect place to come with family or friends especially for it's awesome ambience. Nice interior and soft music. I have tried lot of dishes over the time here but I always preferred their Indian menu more. I had the following things in my last visit:
For starters I really liked double fried chicken. It tastes best with the dip. Takrai gai is another chicken starter which tasted delicious. The kashmiri dry fruit polao was good. Fish amritsari was a little spicy which made me glad.
The staff was friendly and polite which I count to be very important. Happy that I had lunch here :)

Went there on the auspicious occasion of durga puja on panchami. It was moderately empty (considering the puja rush).Since it was a lazy noon and considering the empty restraurant we took our time to decide on the menu but suddenly a waiter came and told us to rush on deciding the menu even though they were going empty and we were a bit dissapointed by his behaviour. Without complaining we then ordered murg bhurasi kabab , hyderbadi dum biryani, and murg peshawari. The food definitely were great and definitely had the rich indian flavour. All of this amounted to rs 1528. At the end the same waiter came to us to ask whether the food was okay and irony is that we thought that he probably was gonna tell us to rush up our eating speed.

For a truly luxurious, elegant and distinctive fine dine experience, The Palms restaurant is a great choice. Situated at the 1st Floor, 19A, Meghnad Saha Sarani, Southern Avenue, Kolkata.
The interiors are very well done, in a colorful manner. The ceiling looked amazing and the seating is comfortable.The food, absolutely amazing.
ordered the double fired chichken and koong kartiam prawn for starters .
main course - murgh harapyaaz , fish amritsari and kashmiri fry fruit polao¬†
Desserts:

Honey Darsan was brilliant.

Lastly , the place is pretty affordable for a family dinner or to go out with friends and it is very spacious too . Budget friendly restaurant that you must definitely try !

Be it the decor,the staffs or the music this place gives you real good vibes as you enter..the cosy seating relaxes up totally and you are all set for a good good experience
We were a group of six people and we're trying to find a good place for lunch and so hit up this place.
Food:-
Starters-
1.tukrai gai-this was something in fish sauteed in spicy tangy sauces with ginger minces and onion.a must try for spicy food lovers
2.koong kartim prawn:this is the best prawn preparation I had till date.tender jumbo prawns spiced up to perfection.a highly recommend starter for prawn lovers and those who can handle spicy food
3.mahi kolibara-this was a fish fry sort of with perfect crunchiness over the soft delicate fish inside.
4.double fried Chicken-this had a tender chkn inside and the extra crunchy covering with a sweet and hot dip that made it a perfect combo..a must try for people who love less spicy stuffs
Main course:
1.kashmiri dry fruit pulao:a perfectly made rice with veggies and dry fruits and something unique was it contained cubes of pineapple too that added a real twist
2.peshawari naan-this Indian bread did justify it's naming with sprinkled nuts and raisins over it and the softness and the little sweetness that went so perfect for my taste buds
3.murgh hara pyaz:this had the perfect tender pieces of chkn cooked in green onion sauce 
4.mutton rezala:this one is highly recommend to the muttoon lovers out there..the soft pieces of mutton so well cooked in the white gravy won my heart
5.fish harianvi:this dish had the the most heart filling pieces of tender fish so perfectly made in red gravy..not too spicy but the perfect one
A highly recommend place for a treat to taste buds

Very avg affir.heard so many gd and positive things but not upto the mark except the gravy items.
We ordered jojeh kabab,tandoori ckn,fish gandaraj kabab and another ckn kabab.all were very bland,fish kabab was not even grilled properly. No masala were felt inside any of them.
Then we had mutton Hyderabadi biriani. This is not Hyderabadi biriani,no where even close. Just naming things for the sake of it üòè
Though the mutton in the biriani was soft and the quantity was very bad. 350 for this biriani seriously?
The only good thing was the rogon josh,soft mutn pcs tatsy gravy with keema naam tasted very good..kadai ckn was oky ish.

If we are paying premium money for food like this whats the point? 
The place is nice ,good ambience and all but food really disappointed us.

I went here for lunch yesterday and I was very impressed with the food. The staff here are like supermen because¬† their service was fabulous, even during the rush hour!!
The food is fantastic, especially the North Indian items. I couldn't explore because the items are limited during Durga Puja. I would surely like to try out more items on the complete menu!!
I strongly recommend the Mutton Boti Kebab and the Panko Crumb Fried Fish!!

We visited the restaurant on navami around 5.30 p.m. It wasnt crowded,so we didnt have to wait to be seated. The ambience was nice and well decorated with comfortable chairs.  For starter we ordered murgh banjara. The taste was nice but chicken pieces were too small compared to the price. For main course we ordered plain nan,murgh noorani,mutton roganjosh and hyderabadi dum biryani. Nan and roganjosh were good,though the gravy of roganjosh could have been thicker. It was more like mangsho jhol, but the taste was nice. Chicken noorani was really good. Coming to biryani..it was horrible. Never before have I seen a green coloured biryani. That in itself killed the  hunger,it had used an excess of rosewater/ator and the taste was nowhere close to hyderabadi dum biryani. I would request them to discuss with their chef!! The only eatable portion of the biryani was the mutton. I request the restaurant management to look into the matter. Look and taste of food are two very important aspects. Also biryani should always be served in a pot not in a bowl. Ice cream was good. But I must say really disappointed with the biryani. Pocket pinch slightly on the higher side.

This place is simply ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ this place was on my wishlist since last 6 months I guess but souls not make it due to some or the other reason... finally on the eve of choturthi visited this glamorous food joint with my family... 

Location :- if you r coming from kalighat towards rabindra sarobar this place will be on your right on the lane of tollygunje phari bus stop... and vice versa for the reverse direction.. just above the CCD outlet..

Ambience :-As soon as you enter the restaurant you will be awstruck with the decor and lighting of the place.. soft white sofas and chocolate coloured chusioned chairs will take your dining experience to a whole new level.. ‚ù§‚ù§ A perfect place for a date or a lavish family dinner...

Food :- 1) Chicken Tandoori :- This was a bit different to the normal one we have inother places but trust me this is simply lipsmacking..üòç ohh boy the juicy and smoky chicken is heavenly to your taste buds and the green chutney and chilli cheese mayo dip is the perfect accompaniment for the dish.... Recommended 

2) Nizami Biriyani :- wow... simply superb... There aroma.. The long rice grains.. The spices.. Everything was just perfect...A perfect blend of spices will make you fill like a mughal.. A complete different from the kolkata style... but trust me this will make you fall in love surely...üòç‚ù§‚ù§ The quantity was huge.. enough to satisfy the hunger of two adults.. 

3) Chicken schezwan fried rice :- Another delicacy from their oriental menu... One of the best schezwan fried rice I have had in town.. It was spicy..With lots of chickens and veggies.. The schezwan smell was apt.. u can have the dish itself it's so tasty.. The portion is enough for two very hungry souls..üòÖ

4) Chicken in hot garlic sauce :- It was really hot and spicy.. and a great partner to the rice mentioned above.. 8 pieces of chicken floating in a gravy mad of garlic .. it was spicy... The chicken ere juicy.. soft... aa top class dish..

5) butter Nan/ Plain nan :- It was soft.. fluffy.. and very tasty.. 

6) murg kalimirch  :- This dish was an above average 
One.. The gravy was thick with crushed black pepper on top of it.. The gravy was very tasty but what I felt the chicken pieces were bit hard.. and under cooked..

7) butter Chicken :- The show stealer..üòçüòç what a dish.. It was spicy..It was delicious.. perfectly great for the rotis..
 
Overall a great place.. This place Will take you dining experience to whole new level.. With a fountain sound playing on background .. really üëçüëç the service was also prompt.. Do visit and enjoy some delicious food..

I will surely visit again.. They charge 18% GST .. Total bill amount was 3115 Inc taxes..

I am immensely happy that finally I visited this place on sasthi. I honestly have no complaints. I would surely love to try their Indian section. We went for oriental. Mixed hakka noodles, mixed schezwan rice, kun pao chicken, fish in palm's sauce.. This was out of the world. I would love to try put their desserts as well. A must must must visit! :)  Also, prices are pocket friendly.

We visited this place on Nabami this year. Last year we visited this place during pujas and we were satisfied with its food and service. But this year both the quality and service have degraded a lot. Firstly they served all our orders including the starters and main course at the same time and did nt even bother to serve the food in our plates. And the most important thing is that the chicken we had ordered was rotten and smelling. However after our complaint they had removed that dish from.our orders and bill. Not recommended.

We went into this restaurant because of the high rating(which seems to be fake/paid) and there was no place in other  restaurants.
First of all while I was going into the washroom one of the staff rushed in ignoring me. I waited n while he came out and I got in, the washroom was not flushed(disgusting) 
We went for nizami biriyani which was served cold and also the chicken was undercooked. Then again we ordered for another one, explaining the staff to kindly serve the biriyani hot but of no help. 
There are 100 better restaurants in and around southern avenue. 
Even the portion was too small compared to the price. 
There is no point visiting this place and with much better price and portions. I would as the management to look into this seriously, otherwise you cannot go on with the fake ratings. 
The 2 rating is for the mutton which was decent enough to eat.

Four of us went me,my wife and two of my children.It was our first and probably last experience there.We had not ordered much.The food quantity was really poor.Atlast when we had finished with our food,I was paying and the waiter started boasting about the restaurant.This was my worst experience eating in Durga Puja

Never would visit this place again nor would i recommend anyone to do so. Foods are definitely overpriced and quantity is less compared to what we are being charged for.  Visited this place on Ashtami night with my friends & ordered Nizami biriyani and Awadhi biriyani with side dishes Chiken kalimirch, Ghost rava and Kadai chicken. Chickens were undercooked and food served in the name of biriyani is not even close to what we know 'Biriyani' is. On complaining about the food quality the staffs kept smiling . Overall won't be visiting this place again.

Went to this place on sashti with my fiance.Location is actually tough to locate if you call the reception and ask for directions because the staff there are inefficient and quite rude.Not at all helpfull.
Now coming to food,food is overpriced as compared to quantity.And taste wise it was bad.May be due to puja rush,but then this place doesnt desrve to get such rating. Food didnt taste that nice,it was more like home cooked food,nothing extraordinary.I would suggest you guys to increase your quantity and keep some better cooks. And the manager there,Not at all courteous.Though he is an old man,He is not at all humble.
Hope to revisit again only if things change a bit!üòä

Another restuarant that i wanted to visit after checking its high ratings on zomato. 

Ambience: 4.5/5
The ambience of this place was damn good. The interiors are top notch. The sofa seats are pretty comfortable and you won‚Äôt be uncomfortable for all the time you spend here (check out the pics).

Service: 4/5
The service of the restaurants was also good. However the manager of the restaurants gave my non veg friends so many options that they got confused like hell. Was a damn hilarious moment for me. 

Food: 4/5
Subz Dilkhush: It was good but prepared in lot of oil which was a turn off. I had to leave some of it as the vegetables were drowning in oil. But the assortment of brinjal, potato, okra, tomato and onion was something that i had never tasted before. 
Murgh Mussallam: My friends ordered it. It was definitely something that would love to have again and again.
Chocolate Darshan: There is nothing that can beat the foodgasm of savouring chocolate served on the sea of chocolate. The quantity could have been more though.

Do try this restuarant. The best part is that they take your feedback after you have finished your meal. So if you have something negative to say, do mention it to them and they‚Äôll work upon it.

Although a restaurant should not be judged during Durga Pujo days...yet, since this is my first time here...It would be wrong to judge them on anything apart from what i had. Let me start by saying, the time of visit was sashti lunch time...With not all the table even filled...Hence i can expect their best service and nothing less... I had... 
Chicken Hakka Noodles- quantity disappointing, and tasted slightly undercooked...The rawness of the egg left a uncooked smell that should not be present anywhere near a decent restaurant plate of food.
Prawn Kajun-whatnotshit- Basically pepper fried prawns...Good size, yet again undercooked... The batter tasted raw...One the most easiest dishes to cook...Was wasted sadly
Fish in Palm Sauce- the only dish i enjoyed to the core. Everything about the dish sang in tune...Soft chunks of fish, nice caramelisation in the crust, sweet stick palm sauce...Just beautiful

Well this place is easy to find.. Exact opposite to Tollygaunge Police station and if you are taking Metro, from Gate No. 3 to left.. 
I went there on one Saturday Lunch and the place was quite empty. So dont have to wait much.. Lets elaborate the place more in proper section wise.

Ambience & Decor - Well , i will rate 4 for this. Ambience are really nice and the decors are quite impressive. U will love the place in one shot. And I believe dinner time it will look more perfect. Only negative point is there sofa which was quite uncomfortable compared to other places.. 

Most important thing, FOOD -  Ahhh they are really good in fish items more than the Chicken.

1. Starters:-
a. Mahi pahari - 4.5/5. its pure vetki and.so.soft that we even dont need to chew. something different on taste.which definitely suffice your tongue.
b. Murg Banjara - 3.5/5 Taste wise its good but i didnt fnd any extra speciality in this item.

c. Fish Finger - 4.5/5. Though its completely fried item but the fish is absolutely soft and tender with crisp coating. I loved this one..

And next we jumped to Main courses with

a. Keema Nan - cant rate as.i dont eat mutton but my friends were satisfied with it.
b. Mohini Nan - 5/5. This Nan is also something different which need to be served very hot. It will become stiff otherwise.
c. Fish Amritsari - 6/5. Best of all the orders we placed. Its awesome.
d. Nizami Biriyani - 3.5/5. Normal Hyderabadi Biriyani.
e. Murg Hara piyaj - 3.5/5.

Desert - Sizzling Brownie with ice cream - 4/5.

Now, Service - I felt they were bit confused with the Menu and there attitude was not that good. Here i will give 3/5.

But will love to visit this place once again during dinner..

Talk about magnificence. Some places elicit regalia through their dishes, and not by fortress like demeanour. 
You got it, definitely talking about The Palms rn. 
A gala feast was performed right here, as the place deserves. The sober decor is easy on eyes and welcomes you with warmth. Polite and humble staff, and even better service with impeccable orientation. 
We had variety to taste. From Indian and Oriental section. Let's get right away to the banquet, shall we?
Starters:
Tandoori Aloo: Moderately spicy, well cooked pieces of cobbler's tube. Indeed a tastebud opener. 
Kumb Katiya Prawn: Grilled prawn pieces drizzling juices with each bite. Yum. 
Panko Crumb Fried Fish: Most definitely and flawlessly, the MVP. With appeting crunch on the outside as you indent your teeth onto it, to the lusicously soft and fresh fish inside, the taste is, for the lack of better term, AMBROSIAL. It lingers. 

Main Course:
Buddha Delight Veggies: I'd never thought I'd love a dish which was simply vegan. Got rekt by this one. Savory and lustrous gravy not only imparts beauty to the colourful vegetables but also elevates the taste.
Schezwan Fried Rice: With slight mix of herbs, this dish knew that balance is important. Legit accompaniment to the main strikers. 
Cantonese Chicken: A good variation from the usual one I'd say. Savory, indeed. 
Sliced Piece In Chilli Plum Sauce: Man of the match award goes to? No it's not me having weakness for fishes(which is true btw), but the fishy dishes served here compels you to bow down. The tantalizing plum sauce with delicately sliced fish was just that enticing!
Chilli Garlic Noodles: Another dish for support, doesn't overwhelm taste buds yet satisfying to the core. 

Dal Gosht: Thick dal makhani with semi minced pieces of mutton. Was nice. 
Chicken Noorani: Was so full, yet couldn't evade the appeal of this one. Dense gravy with butter roti really bags some charm, doesn't it?
Gosh Roganjosh: BEST. You'd be bound to create an empty slot inside your crammed tummy. Can't help it. The succulent mutton prices wants space inside!
Veg Nawabi Polao: This was fragrant and light and was a healer as if, to sway you from the richness. 

That's about it to the never ending dishes we've had here. Gotta check out desserts there, next time.
High Hopes. Man, can't wait to go back!

We had both oriental and Indian cuisine which were equally amazing... We started with the Oriental dishes from prawn and panko fish and veg starters which took us by shock.. along with the chicken in chilli plum sauce.   The main course was fabulous as well....
We also had a refreshing fresh lime soda ...
Then came the indian dishes ..  tandoori aloo was fabulous... Then we had the main course which included... Chicken noorani.. mutton roganjosh ...Nd gosht Dal... We had it with naan and Pulao...
I must say it was a treat to the stomach...
I would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone..please visit. ..

Well this visit had been one of those moments which i did really cherish.
Stands right at the junction of Southern avenue crossing, as a significant restaurant in heart of city of joy.
The ambience and the decor makes you feel so good and cosy.
The food here is just no less than amazing.
Specailty dishes like Panko Krumb Fried Fish , Kumb katiya prawn, Cantonese Chicken are just so good and wonderful to taste.
The star performer here is undoubtedly Sliced fish in Chilli Plum Sause, so far one of the best i had in the entire city. This little preparation can give your taste buds the satisfaction of your life.
Well i just can stop myself from coming to this place in near future i presume.
The chinese here please's you to a great extent.
This joint has been proudly standing since years and the dishes that it serves takes the whole new food era of the city of joy to new and amazing level.
I can't just stop from calling myself a Fan of thos restaurant.
This place definitely deserves the 'Must try' tag.

Located conveniently in Southern Avenue above a Cafe Coffee Day outlet, The Palms has a soothing and tranquil ambiance to enjoy a satisfatory meal. The quietly trickling water fountain and the three sets of stone-encrusted chef statuettes each holding a spoon, fork and knife are worth the mention as part of the interior decor.
Service and conduct of servers are praiseworthy.
We dined on the Tomato Dhaniya Ka Shorba, Keema Naan, Makhani Naan, Murgh Peshawari, Nizami Biryani and Hot Gulab Jamun.
The tomato and coriander based soup with a nawabi flavor was quite delicious and served perfectly hot, The Palms being one of those rare places that offer really good soup.
The Keema Naan was simply the best of all items and one of their popular picks by foodies. Soft and stuffed with delish mutton keema it goes well with paneer or chicken items.
The Makhani naan was good too, smeared with butter and easy to tear.
The awadhi flavored murgh Nizami biryani altogether had a different unconventional taste - in fact all of the items were unique in taste amidst the plethora of North Indian cuisine - and good enough to whet one's appetite.
The Murgh Peshawari is a Peshawari special dish of boneless chicken marinated in cashewnut, cheese, butter and cream. Tad sweet to taste, it was fresh and with almost no spiciness at all.
The hot gulab jamun (2 pieces) stuffed with fresh dry fruits is one of their specialities. I've had better gulab jamuns elsewhere but these were tasteful, served extremely hot, enough to burn one's tongue (which it did for me. üòÇ)
To sum up, The Palms is a good option if one's looking for a hearty and delicious family dinner of North Indian or Chinese fare, or to enjoy some culinary delicacies with friends, cousins, colleagues etc. üòä‚ò∫

The palms is a fine dining restaurant serving two different cuisines. 
Located in Southern Avenue,the building that houses Caf√© coffee day is the same as The palms.

We visited this place on a typical humid day and they offered the basic coke with a slice of the gondoraj which added a tangy twist to the drink and was quite refreshing.

We decided to go with the Indian Cuisine and ordered the following starters:
‚óèMahi pahari
‚óèTandoori mushroom
‚óèMurg bhurasi kebab
‚óèMurg banjara

All the items were delicious and had been cooked to perfection starting from the soft succulent  fish in mahi pahari to the perfectly tandoored mushroom.

Going by the Indian menu we ordered the following main course items:
‚óèMurgh peshawari
‚óèMurgh gautie
‚óèvegetable kolhapuri
‚óègosht rarha
‚óènizami biryani
‚óèbutter abd garlic nun
‚óèpeshwari nun
‚óèpaneer karachi

All the items were very tasty especially the biryani.

To end our meal we ordered for the sizzling Brownie with icecream which was a treat both to the eyes as well as to the tastebuds.

Now the food we ordered :

For a truly luxurious, elegant and distinctive fine dine experience, The Palms restaurant is a great choice. Situated at the 1st Floor, 19A, Meghnad Saha Sarani, Southern Avenue, Kolkata. The restaurant features different cuisines ‚Äì Asian, Awadhi, North Indian, Mughlai.

The interiors are very well done, in a colorful manner. The ceiling looked amazing and the seating is comfortable. I personally love places where the level of hospitality is this high. The service was pretty fast, that too in the afternoon.

And it was a summer afternoon and I wanted to try some refreshing drinks to beat the heat.

Here arrived kebabs Starters. Tandoori Mushroom was excellent where the mushrooms were deep fried and extreme spicy. Murgh Banjara and Murgh Bhurasi Kebab was perfectly done, the chicken kebabs being soft and delicate. The last appetizer, which turned out to be my favorite was Mahi Pahari. It tasted good.

Moving on the main course, we had Paneer karachi, Vegetable Kolapuri, Murgh Peshawari, Murgh Gautie and Gosht Rarha with Makhani Naan, Garlic Naan and Nizami Biriyani. Murgh Gautie looks amazing. The flavours and the use of spices were perfect. The chicken pieces were soft and well cooked. ¬†I completely fell in love with Nizami Biriyani. <3

With a full stomach, we moved on to their dessert. Hot brownie with ice cream scoop looks extreme delicious. It was heavenly.

Overall, It is Classy and simple, The Palms Restaurant delights its customers with an exquisite dining experience and serving two different cuisines. I'm definitely coming back to try the other dishes on their menu.

With a rating of 4.7 was hoping to have some mouth watering dishes. Had ordered their speciality Mushroom Gawlati for starters, which was unique in its presentation but tasted quite ordinary. For main course ordered Kolahpuri mix veg. Tasted like a combination of paw bhaji, and mix veg. Was so bad that we didn't want to take away what was left. Breads were good, Ajwaini paratha and keema paratha, yet again nothing great.
Only good bit was our feedback was taken, but were also proudly reminded that 99/100 like their food.

Worst food I ever had in a restaurant. Tried galawati kebab and chicken tandoori which is not at all galawati and it's taste more like a Sammi  a kebab with that they have used coconut in it and tandoori was not fully done. Then tried keema naan and Dal makhni .... Though keema naan was alright but Dal makhni was no way tasted like Dal makhni and the Dal they used was a mixed Dal .... and also tried chicken Kali mirch which has a very blunt taste. So over all the ambience of the place was nice but the food was really terrible.

A wonderful experience is the phrase that expresses best our visit here. From the elegant interior to the courteous service... Everything was top-notch. Mahi pahari was succulent and juicy while the dehleez kebab contributed a unique taste, thanks to its unique chicken-mutton combo. Mohini naan was another new addition to my gastronomical dictionary with egg n spring onion spread over it. Gosht rarha came as highly recommended, not only for its xtra large well cooked chunks of mutton,but also for its gravy, prepared as it is, with keema. Finally comes the biryani. We had ordered Murgh Zaffran biryani. N here they have revolutionized the entire process. Here they serve tawa biryani so no potato or egg. But the taste is really unique and awesome. Hope they maintain this quality.

I went to this place with a friend. Ambience is not conducive for friends' outing. Maybe okay for families and office outings. Looks quite good from the outside. But inside, the tables are too close by. Very little privacy of conversation. Bits and pieces will float over from next table. Wait staff themselves are quite loud.
Food was terrible. Ordered a Konjee Crispy Chicken. Almost inedible. I had to literally stab them with the fork, it was so hard. Next was a cheese-stuffed mushroom balls appetizer, which was absolutely flavorless, and even though mouth-searingly hot, the cheese was surprisingly solid. We had expected a molten texture.
We also ordered a can of Coke (which we later discovered cost 60 rupees), which had no fizz and was warmer than our water. A request for ice was obliged after 15 mins, which in turn made the Coke taste like water. Somehow, they managed to ruin even an overpriced packaged item.
Terrified at the prospect of further culinary oppression, we requested the main courses, which unfortunately we had already ordered before the appetizer fiasco, to be packed. I did not taste those, but my friend did. She took it home. 
The waste of the evening came to ‚Çπ1200 for 2 unappetizing appetizers, an inedible glass of black lukewarm water and a couple of main courses (some chicken with bamboo shoots, and mixed hakka noodles).

I don't think this restaurant is worth the hype. To start with, the seating is very uncomfortable, one cannot rest the back and eat food but have to pull oneself till the table which is very less in width, they have a small stair inside the restaurant which can be easily missed by anyone making them to tumble down. Coming to the service, the service guy was taking the order but wasn't having any pen paper or digital order pad to note down the order and hence was forgetting the dishes we were saying so finally we had to tell him to note down the order, he wasn't well informed about the menu also. Coming to the food the vegetarian options were so very less, we ordered Chilly Baby corn (which had a solid coating of cornflour making it tough to break), hara bhara Tawa kabab both were good in taste but nothing great about them, had sweet corn soup which was utterly disgusting like some roadside soup stall, then for main course we ordered paneer makhanwala, a mixed veg semi gravy which had green and red gravy both , sorry can't recollect the name, both were really good in taste, had garlic cheese nan and butter nan which were yumm, masala kulcha was a disappointment again, vegetable Biryani which was a disaster. Since the food wasn't good couldn't afford to spend on the desert. The d√©cor and location is good but nothing else is. Disappointment!

AMAZING!!!
Just a 2minute walk from kalighat metro, stands this food heaven .
This, without doubt is now my favorite restaurant. Probably the best I have ever visited. The ambience, decor was beautiful. The service was great. The food, absolutely amazing.
Ordered the makhani karahi , a Kabab dish; it was heavenly. The most succulent and flavoured pieces of chicken pieces one can ask for. The mohini naan was good too(eat while hot). The murg peshwari was excellent. The iced Litchies were good. They were all delicious üòã.
A must visit place for all foodies.
And I'll be back for more. Loved it.

One of the best budgetfriendly resturant in the southern avenue area.. Situated at the startpoint of the southern avenue on the floor above CCD  this place has a nice interior decor with a aristocratic ambience!! 
About the food.. We ordered chicken lungfung soup.. Dehleez kebab.. And salt abd peeper squid as starters.. The lung fung soup was unique here.. The squid was tasty and the dahleez kebab was mixture of chicken and mutton shick kebab.. 
In the main course we had singapore rice noodles and thai green curry.. Thai green curry was unique in its essence of herbs.. The singapore rice noodles was enough in quantity to make our stomach full.. 
Overall a must visit place!!

This fine dining restaurant is located in Southern Avenue on the first floor of CCD. Took my friends over there for my birthday treat. Must say the interiors are beautiful and classy and also has a large space. The menu consisted of both oriental and mughlai dishes. Went on a weekday and availed for the buy 1 get 1offer for the starters. We had mutton galawati kebab,takrai gai,konjee crispy chicken and chicken bangara. The galawati kebabs had coconut in it unlike other places, rest of the starters were really good. Coming to the main course we had eggwrapped chicken fried rice which had large pieces of chicken in it, Cantonese mei foon chicken, masala kulcha, murgh zafrani and nizami biriyani. Now coming to the biriyanis they tasted excellent though none of them were of Kolkata style biriyani, and above all each biriyani came with a small bowl of lip smacking raitas. We also took Hunan chicken, murgh Peshawari which had a hint of cheese and cream and murgh mussallam. Murgh mussallam really went well with the biriyani. All the dishes were really very tasty and we enjoyed our meal at our hearts content üòä.

Probably one of the best fine dining restaurants in Calcutta. The decors of this place is pretty amazing. Staffs are well in their jobs. Dry cooked fish finger which was my favourite among all the other starters. Their speciality is Khar Khar lamb which is perfectly cooked, another must try will be pan fried mixed noodles. It tasted pretty amazing, loved it totally. Chicken wings chilly pepper salt was just the best chicken wings I'd ever had. Last but not the least, iced lychees which was amazing to eat with the vanilla ice cream.
This place is a must try.

1) murg banjara(4/5)
2) mohini naan(5/5): very good but must be eaten while its hot
3) murg mussallam(5/5): awesome taste.the best item according to me on our menu
4) gosht jalandari(5/5): this item too was very good.

We also tried one oriental dish: khar khar lamb(5/5): it was too delicious.

We went on a weekday and got 1+1 free offer on a few items plus 15% discount on the total bill.
Its a must visit restaurant.

Probably one of the best fine dining restaurants in Kolkata. It is located at Southern Avenue. It has a large space & nice decor. And it offers nice variety of delicious dishes and excellent services. Staffs are very professional in their job. Each & every dish is explained by them before customers place orders. We ordered Murgh Banjara & Mofu Tofu Lamb as starters. Both of them tasted excellent. But the lamb dish is very very delicious and its a must try. Then we ordered for Mohini Naan (must try), Gosht Jalandhari & Murgh Musallam. Waiting for the next visit to this place...

After 7 months I revisited here at The Palms. Located opposite to Tollygunge Police Station and first floor of the cafe coffee day.

I was there for a lunch and the staffs presented there accommodated me in a good manner, I would like to mention Imran here for his great service and care.

Ambiance was nice and well decorated, the sofas were utterly soft. Background music played by them was perfect and they have really good collections of it.

Starters:
1. Mahi Kasundi kebab was spicy tender pcs of perfectly cooked fish which was good.
2. Prawn Tempura was the ultimate dish of the day, excellent taste with great presentation.
3. Lamb in celery Wine is a less spicy sauted lamb with veggies. Very well cooked.
4. Sui Mai Chicken was also good.

Drinks:
1. Strawberry Spicy Mint Mojito was a great combination of Sweetness and spicy mixture.
2. Virgin Mojito was also good.

Main Course:
1. Dal Gosht was very good and tasty, never tried that before but I enjoyed that.
2. Chicken Lababdar was also a great.
3. Loved the Cheese Garlic Naan compared to --
4. Peshwari Naan which was little bit on the sweet side for the coconut and blend on it .
5. Veg Nawabi Pulao was nice also and comes with generous quantity.
6. Fish Hara Punjabi was good.
7. Kandhari Bhuna was excellent.

Desserts:
Chocolate Darsan was brilliant.

Kudos to Palms Management. Will Visit soon.

Location : It's 3 mins away from gate 3(Kalighat metro),where the lane takes a turn towards southern Avenue; just beside CCD.
Ambience: The little fountain,the incandescent lights,furnitures,classy cutlery,The Waffle-ed wall...Will surely take your heart away!
FOOD we ordered:-
Starters:-
1)Prawn tempura- Best among the fish items the crispness and the quality were perfect too.

2)stir fried lamb in with celery and Chinese green - My favorite among the starters,the tender sweet juicy luicy thing along with fresh veggies is what they serve you ,it's a must try.

3)sui mai chicken- A Better form of chicken momo,tastes good with the dip servered

4)mahi kasundi- Basically a fish tandoori which could have been a bit more expressing but the quality of the fish was very good.

Drinks:
5)virjin mojito: Exactly how it should taste like.

Main Course:

7)Peahawari naan: it has a continental touch and sweet in taste and Is a must have if you are going there.

9)veg nawabi pulao: simple yet royal.

10)dal gosht: Moderately spicy and goes well with the naan.

12)chicken lababdar: White curry with the richness of cashew.

13)fish hara Punjabi: Tastes good enough.

14)kandhari bhuna: A bit spicy and half dried delicacy cooked with mutton is √†lso a lip smacking dish.


Dessert:
15)chocolate darsan: Chocolaty affair it is!

16)ice lychees: Caramel and lychee along with vanilla ice cream can make such a wonderful combination cannot be believed if you do not taste this.

I visited this place just recently and I must say it is gem of a place .
The ambience is very soothing and a special mention for their wonderful playlist of songs !

We started with :-
prawn tempura
Stir fried lamb in celery and Chinese green
Sui mai chicken
Mahi kasundi
Along with virgin mojito and strawberry spicy mint mohito .
The starters came out to be really good but I loved Prawn tempura the most because of it's tender taste .

In main course we had :-
Peshawari naan
Cheese garlic naan which I liked the most
Veg nawabi polao
Dal gosht and I really liked this one ! Strongly recommended
Chicken lababdar
Fish hara panjabi
Kandhari bhuna .

In deserts we had Ice lychees and chocolate darsan .

Pros - prawn tempura and Dal gosht is strongly recommended .

Cons - chicken lababdar can be prepared in a better way .There is room for improvement in the servicing as well .The starters took too much of waiting time .

Lastly , the place is pretty affordable for a family dinner or to go out with friends and it is very spacious too . Budget friendly restaurant that you must definitely try !

Favourite is definitely the Kakori kebab( mutton pieces marinated in a variety of spices) and the Peshawari naan, which is stuffed naan with coconut and almonds.

Murgh musallam is a must try for all non veg lovers.. all the starters were great. Nd if you really  want to experience something different please try wasabi prawn. It will bring tears of happinessüòâü§£. The desserts we're plain nd simple but very very tasty.. so to conclude go ahead Nd njoy great food with great ambience at "The Palms"...

One of the restaurants that is really very overrated on zomato. Visited it on last saturday. We had ordered chicken satay which we did not like it was dry and lacjed any taste.... butter garlic prawn which was the only food that satiated our palates.... then we had ordered a plate of chilli garlic noodles and a plate of fried rice and they forced us to order more saying it wouldn't  suffice. We also ordered a plate of chilli chicken... Unfortunately none of the food was even worth having and on top of that most of the food was wasted as it was too much. We had to pack all the food. They  gave us a review sheet where i reviewed them average on food and service the waiter was so snobbish he came upto me and demanded why had I given such reviews he made me change it and give a good review. Overall a very bad experience.  A very overrated restaurant with expensive food the quality of food served being very low

Me and my fiance was there for lunch. It's at Meghnad Saha sarani.
Well we were caught by the very soothing ambience...
Nd were cleaned blowled by it's food....
Staffs were very much helpful,well behaved aswell..
We ordered
1.Half chicken tandoor - very much mouth watering.
2.Nawabi polau- awsome aromatic, creamy cottage cheeses, vegetables...And quantity was enough for two.
3.Murg Peshawar - some 4 or 5 pieces... Cheeses r being melted in gravy.... I have fallen for the dish.
4.Murg kalimirch- 4pieces or so.... Bit spiecy ,bt again hit with taste...

But I guess the chicken could be a little bit soft and tender. Otherwise totally worthy..
Pocket pinch is reasonable. Our bill came Rs.1048 or so... Including GST.

I was there on Saturday night with friends. This place is close to my place and thats one important attraction. What i liked was Kabab and side dishes; and didn't liked Biriyani and desserts. Shared our feedback with Ma'am. I love my food and understand the pain it takes to prepare so never i want to be harsh in my criticism. They have good potential to improve. Inside deco - good...no complaints....can be improved upon....Breads were good.¬†
Biriyani is essential for mughlai. I think its difficult for new restaurant to manage the conventional biriyani.¬†
Next time i will try the Chinese.

This place is located at the end of the Southern Avenue in Meghnad Saha Sarani on 1st floor. Last year in the month of October we visited this place.
Ambience is awesome , Decor is good, Service is excellent and Food is great. For the starters we ordered Kakori kebab The kakori kebabs were quite tasty rich in spices. Next for the main entries we ordered Onion palak rice with Murg Peshwari and Fish Hyderabadi. The onion palak rice was very different, the rice was green in colour and had taste of spinach with onions. But it was good in taste. The Murg Peshwari was quite delicious it was a yellow creamy curry with chicken pieces. The curry tasted well and the chicken pieces were quite tender and juicy. Then we tried the Fish Hyderabadi. This was also very tasty The bhetki fillets were quite good with rich coconut gravy. At last when we had our lunch they gave us gajar ka halwa as complementary, which also tasted good. Overall experience was nice.

After going through a  lots of reviews in Zomato we were finally there. We had Indian food and yes it was decent. 
‚Ä¢ Mutton Galwati kabab
‚Ä¢ Kasundi Mahi (Bhetki Kabab)
‚Ä¢ Achari Mutton
‚Ä¢ Murgh Zafran Biriyani
‚Ä¢ Nizami Biriyani, 
These are the dishes we ordered  and as I mentioned earlier all were decent. If you are looking for kolkata Biriyani, then this is not the place. No more adjective add. Overall nice experience.

Visited this place for dinner.the food here is good and I didn't find it too exciting or something special.However,sultani irani(gosht) starter,was very poorly prepared and I guess even the management realised that after serving it to us.Sizzling brownie is good and simple.Gulab jamun was served piping hot and was a bit extra sweet.
The staff was very polite and kind.

It's been a month in Kolkata, I had palm the very first day.. And till this day I haven't got its competitor yet. 

It was an cloudy day, I along with my food partner accidentally found this restaurant somewhere in the corner of the street. The first glimpse of CCD made us to see this Landmark. We thought to give it a try.. Voila at the corner seat with a beautiful view... Waiter greeted... We smiled. I thought of ordering something in kebab and we got good suggestions from the manager.. After a discussion me and my friend ordered chicken banjara.. The service was fast.. We prepared ourselves.. the moment I teared the kebab it was smooth and fluffy inside.. The true inception was its roasted and smoked flavors lingering around.. Uffffff it was amazing believe me. The green chutney was a perfect trio with the onion salad chopped round. 

For the main course, my mind was fighting between biryani and the roti sabzi... As the menu gave me a hint that the Indian is it is.. Hence we ordered chicken goutie (heard that for the first time), it was spicy, rich in flavor. Was good to try with peshawari Naan. 
To fill the hunger we ordered nawabi pulao.. It was truly eyesoothing as you can see the variety of veggies perfectly mixed up with the rice in different colors. 

Overall the bill was easy on pocket. Those who love spacious seating and cozy lighting would love it. Kebabs are a must try I would suggest. Hospitality was one key part that would leave you with a positive note.

A beautiful place to eat. I went to this place after knowing it from Zomato and reading its review. And Boy !!! Not disappointed a single bit. 
Khar khar lamb a must try and even more must try is the Peshwari Nun. Absolutely out of the world. The Chicken Kebab was soft . And what stole our heart was fish hariyali. The taste was amazing and the quality of fish was outstanding.
The sizzling brownie tasted good but I expected more chocolate sauce component which was actually totally missing from the dish

So far, of all the good restaurants in Kolkata, I have found only one joint that can make the perfect tandoori roti, that is Peter Cat. Being a roti lover, no meal is complete without a good roti, always wished for a joint in South Kol that can make perfect Northern style rotis. At last there is The Palms. Excellent rotis accompanied with authentic mains. Try out Murgh Hara Pyaaz or Murgh Peshawari, if you prefer white gravy with plain tandoori roti or Missi roti, many variations available. Enjoy.

Well this was my second visit here. In our first visit , we opted for the mughlai cuisine. So this time for a change we tried their Oriental cuisine food. First we ordered Dry Stir Fried Chilli Chicken as starter, which was a decent dish though it could be a little more spicy. Now for main course , we ordered Egg Wrapped Mixed Rice and Kung Pao Prawns. The rice was warm, salty , flavoured with Chinese spices with delicate pieces of shrimp and the egg omelette envelope was soft and delicious. The Kung pao prawns had a sweet and sour taste with large, juicy and succulent pieces of jumbo prawns . However the best dish turned out to be the dessert - Sizzling Brownie with Vanilla Icecream, well the name says it all. Though the treat was somewhat pocket pinching, it was really worth the price . Hoping to visit soon again.

Yesterday we had a get together with friends.. We had a lovely time.. I called up to book a table but they don't take up booking over phone.. But when we reached the restaurant we had a lovely welcome from the guard at the gate.. We were immediately provided with a table.. We were 8 in number.. We ordered for stir fried chill chicken, kronjee crispy chicken which was very tasty..  They prepare both Chinese and mughlai but the Chinese is out pass the mughlai cuisine..  The waiters have a smile on their face when they are serving the food.. The ambiance is also lovely..  The interior is also well decorated.. You will get to see a lovely artificial water decor.. The food is value for money..

This nicely decorated restaurant is located in Southern Avenue. This is one of my favourite restaurants in town. This restaurant gives you a stand out feeling. The restaurant is well lit with comfortable seating arrangements and classy interiors with a golden touch. this family restaurant has already climbed up the ladder of popular culinary experts in the town.
                                                                ...

The glittering sign of this place, shining bright at the junction of lake view road and sp Mukherjee road, had always caught my attention, but had never got the opportunity of going there. Last night we friends decided to drop in, and our minds were blown  

Location: standing at the mouth of southern Avenue it's 5 mins walking distance from Kalighat metro station. This definitely makes the place an easily accessible one. 

Ambiance : the nicely lit stairway, the play of baige and brown around, the comfortable seats, these all add up to make this place one of the warmest ones in the city. For dining halls soft lighting and baige really goes a long way. 

Service: I really have nothing to say about their service, really really unremarkable. 

Food: the most important segment to be focused on, we had 1. Blueberry Rosemerry smash, 2. For starters Khar Khar lamb 3. For main course Peshawari nan, chicken lababdar 4. Iced lychee with ice-cream to satisfy our sweet tooth 

The drink, was something different. Rosemerry is one of my favourite herbs, the earthy pungent hilly flavour mixed with sweet blueberries really made it a refreshing start

Khar Khar lamb, irrespective of the weird name, is the best lamb dish I had till date. I love how they were able to cook it to perfection and preserve the juicy texture of the meat. Tender meat playing in a tangy, sweet, spicy sauce stole my heart 

Main course was something so rich in flavours yet easy on palate. Peshawari nan, was so soft, flavoured with dry fruits, coconut and khoya giving  a sweet tone to its taste. When paired with the amazing chicken lababdar it felt like heaven. Tender chicken pieces in a rich white creamy gravy is a must try. 

To complete the experience, my dessert stomach needs to be satisfied. So this one, with such an interesting name caught my attention. It had iced lychee, stuffed with toffeed resins, served on top of vanilla ice cream and cherries. 

So this is a petuk bong recommendation, do visit. I will definitely go back to this gem to try their whole menu.

I've visited The Palms thrice in the last one year. It specializes mostly in Oriental, Mughlai, Awadhi and North Indian cuisine. Located on the first floor just at the beginning curve of Southern Avenue, the restaurant has an impressive, royal look! The interiors are mesmerizing; the ambiance is too pleasant and soothing. A magnificent fountain greets the diners as they enter through the main door. Overall, the entire atmosphere is amazing

I have tried the following dishes over the course of time:

Mocktails :
Rosemary Blueberry Smash- This is my favourite drink at The Palms. It's a perfect blend of blueberries and Rosemary sprig with lemon juice.

Starters:
Khar Khar Lamb- As the name suggests, it's a lamb starter. Having tried numerous lamb dishes in the city, I can safely claim that it's the best lamb I've had in the city. Every lamb lover should DEFINITELY try this starter here!! What makes it so different and better is that the pieces are incredibly juicy and not chewy at all. Perfectly cooked, and amazing in taste!

Bhurasi Kabab- Another AMAZING starter!!!!! It consists of boneless chicken kabab pieces. There are places which have a reputation for preparing awesome kababs, but this dish beats half of them any day. The boneless pieces are roasted to perfection and possess a tenderness that few other places can offer.

Main Course:
Hyderabadi Dum Biryani- A pot of aromatic mutton Biryani. The quantity is impressive, and so is the aroma and taste.

Chicken Lababdar- A chicken dish with boneless shreds and greenish-yellow gravy. Simply amazing!

Peshawari Naan- I love this the most. Tender, buttery naan slices stuffed with sweet coconut and a few cashews on top. It tastes sweet, and having it with the gravy dishes gives an amazing new taste.

Pork Ribs with Snow Peas- Each strip contains both fat and lean, and tastes delicious in the sauce it's prepared in.¬†

Dessert:
Iced Lychees with Ice-Cream- This, again, is my favourite dessert here. Scoops of vanilla ice-cream combined with juicy Litchis and cherries. I can't have enough of it !

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION: Location of this lovely place is just 5 mins walk from Kalighat metro. It falls in a very silent and quite area but its big banner makes you attracted towards it. If you are looking for feel like home service and treatment then this place is highly recommended from my side.

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE: Right from the Entrance you will start getting some positive vibes in you until you walk up the stairs and enters the resto urself. The big ambiance will going to make you feel good. With some very fine dining and classy interiors the resto offers you some comfortable sitting experience. With beautiful interiors and soft sitting sofas and chair your eating experience becomes more comfortable. A small fountain have been included inside the premises which is very uncommon to see. Lightings have been perfect.

Coming to the Service which was the main attraction for which i should personally thanks Team Palms. Staffs were very attentive and polite. Quick to your service and very less it happens in a resto that that the waiter is already present before you call him.

In the Food and Drink section we had :

1.Watermelon Lime Soda : This came in a Watermelon which was half cut with the entire mocktail inside it. I just loved the presentation. Coming to the drink so this was a perfect thirst buster one can have.

2. Bhurasi Kabab : The name looks little confusing for sure but this was a chicken based starter. Juicy and on target with its succulent taste. Extremely well marinated and cooked.

3. Hyderabadi Dum Biryani : This was my 4th outing at this very place and my second try to the dum biryani. From the last time it has got much better with the presentation, looks and taste that shows how rapidly they are correcting their flaws making things work.

4. Chicken Lababdar : I have tried Chicken Lababdar before at other places but this was something more creamy i would say. Perfect blend of spices created a magic in the dish and its complemented Peshawari Nan bang on.

5. Gajar Halwa : Last time it was all bizzare from them as per the desserts part are concerned, but this time it wasnt repeated again. They seemed well prepared. From over the bowl i could smell and see the Desi Ghee that made me more curious to go on and have a taste that. It was soothing, hot and fresh. Liked it!!!

This visit to Palms was an extreme satisfactory for me than the previous ones as the food tried this time were kind of damn good. A perfect dinner i would say.

A place that is going to lift up your spirits and make you joyful.

I was tired after work and casually moved in; my first visit though. The shimmering sign reading "The Palms Restaurant" had drawn my attention some time back and yesterday I made a point to move in. 

The ambience, service and food was heavenly, a delight. Things that I tried were "Rosemary Blueberry Smash", "Khar Khar Lamb", "Bhurashi Kabab", "Pork Ribs with Snow Peas" and "Iced Lychees with Ice Cream".

Located 2 mins walk from kalighat metro, this restaurant is made to blow your mind and let your taste buds have a treat of lifetime.

The order:
Rosemary Blueberry Smash- A smooth chilled drink with great flavour and taste! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED

Watermelon Lime Soda- Crazy presentation and taste!

Hyderabadi Dum Biryani was oozing taste all over the place!

Bhurasi Kabab is a MUST MUST MUST try. Its soft, full of flavour, perfectly cooked and amazingly tasty!

Gajar ka halwa- I hardly remember the last time i had such a good and blissful halwa. Amazing texture and taste! Highly Recommended.

Iced lychees with ice cream- Chilled lychees with vanilla ice cream is the perfect way to end your day.

You are in for a treat here!

The concept of two restaurants under the same roof is their usp. The guests are personally attended by the owner and as said by her they have two executive chefs for the two seperate cuisines.
The staffs are courteous and quick. They are mainly very helpful. 
Food is worth mentioning. Their veg nawabi palao, mutton rogan josh, kumbh galawati( which is their signature dish), chicken noorani were amazing. Definitely one of the best restaurants in south kolkata. Priced sensibly according to the quality of food they serve.

Highly overrated here in Zomato. Highly overpriced.
We ordered double fried prawn in the starter. It was so much acutely sour in taste that it killed my taste for all upcoming items. Price of the dish was Rs375 (with tax, Rs.445). They gave 6 pcs of relatively smaller medium sized prawns. Means per pc Rs.74!! Too much!!
In mains, Tom Yum chicken fried rice priced Rs.260+tax again overpriced compared to quantity and trust me, I ate Tom yum fried rice in Asian countries.. Totally different..
Chicken in green chilli sauce- I didn't found any green chilli sauce!! It was regular blackish red colour tangy sour Chinese gravy. All in all, pretty disappointed with the food and my rating is 1.5.
Now the good part. Pretty nice interior and ambience.
Very much courteous staffs and good service.

We visited the place during Durga Pujo on a lunch date. It has a soothing ambience and that's the best thing about the restaurant.
Nothing to complain about the food; it was delicious although the portions are not worth mentioning which makes it pricey enough.
The oriental menu is exquisite but short.
Service wasn't very professional the waiter didn't have any idea about the food on the menu.
A place worth visiting again for the ambience and the food too.

It was my wife's birthday evening and I was looking for some quite place near southern avenue and searched in zomato found that it's a good rated restaurant.  
We had 2 starter , biriyani and one mocktail. Starter and drink is nice but biriyani was not up to the mark.
Decor is simple and nice . So much light inside it .Ambience and staffs are very good .

One negative thing , they don't give you any bowl to wash your hands. 
Enjoy your evening:)

Though the service was a little late. Had to wait for like 10-15 mins in between starter and main course.

We went to this place on a Sunday. The ambience was amazing. The interior design was awesome, the seats were very comfortable and we were welcomed warmly by the manager and co. 
Firstly we ordered chicken tandoori full plate. The four pieces of tandoori was served with onion pieces and 2 kinds of sauces. They outer part of the chicken tasted very good but the inner part was cooked well but lacked the flavour. But overall it was great. We enjoyed it.
Next we asked the waiter about the babycorn dishes availiable. I think he was a bit too confident about the dish we wanted and straightaway placed the order at the kitchen. 
To our dissappointment the dish was not the one we wanted.
The staff was humble enough to take the dish back and asked us exactly what we wanted. After explaining that we wanted the saucy babycorn which was small , the mistake continued again and we were served with american corn that we didn't liked. 
We could have tried the something more but we decided to leave. One thing i liked about the restaurant that is the staff were concerned about their service and even apologized for the inconvenience we had. 
I should say that the service was really one of the best i ever came across. The food was good (i don't want to rate it now as we just tried two dishes) .The decoration, the seats and the ambience was just great. If you ever go to southern avenue you will enjoy your time here , try this place out! Cheers!

It has been quite sometime since I have visited this restaurant and I am eagerly waiting to pay another visit very soon. Perfect ambience, cooperative staff and above all good food at affordable prices are the key factors for suggesting this place to all who want to enjoy sumptuous meal of all kinds. Personal recommendation would be to try out the Double fried prawn, Rarh Gosht, Peshwari Nan, Nawabi pulai, Chicken Lababdar and Darshan for the dessert. The taste of the food is bound to linger in your mouth adding to the increased appetite and heightened cravings to try out other dishes as well. Moreover, do pay visit to this place on your special occasion as they offer special discounts. Ideal for enjoying a peaceful meal with family and friends. The locational advantage is also a big high.

So I'll tell you what I impressed me most when I visited this place.It was service, I mean there are lot of places dishing out good food,but these guys go that extra step in making sure that you don't have regrets about coming here.Waiters are friendly and provide with useful suggestions.The chef personally came out to know whether the food was good or bad and the interiors are beautiful and the ambience is very cozy and luxurious...
Coming to food,had ordered following

Mocktails: FRESH WATERMELON JUICE,though I didn't remember the proper name because it has included in d menu card few days back but I would suggest you to have this because this was very refreshing n tasty (specifically in summer days)

Starters: kalmi kebab which tastes amazing

Main course: mohini nan,kashmiri polao, Murg mussallam which was tandoori chicken in a rich mutton keema red spicy gravy with egg(must try it).

We had an amazing dinner at The Palms and want to come back here again to try out some more mouth watering dishes.

The Palms had been on my bucket list for a long long time! Tried visiting it on Saptami last year, but it was completely chock-a-block! Finally I visited this place last week. 

The interior is really impressive and has a regal look about it, complete with plush sofas and beautiful lighting. Full marks for the beauty of the place. 

Coming to the food - 

Starters :

We decided to order 4 starters which were - Fish Basil Tikka, Chicken Bhurasi Kebab, Lamb with Celery and Chinese Greens, and Sev Thikin Prawns. My favourite were the Lamb and Fish dishes. The quality of fish was superb and the dish was very well cooked. The fish was juicy and succulent. The chicken on the other hand was tender, and grilled with spices. The lamb starter was a stunner, cooked with veggies. It had a mild and subtle flavour which I loved. The Sev Thikin Prawn was a Korean dish, which is a must for every prawn lover. The prawns were batter fried and had a layer of spicy sauce. 


Main Course -

We decided to order a varied main course, which is quite alright, since we are gluttons of the top order. We decided to give their Thai Menu a try, and ordered Chicken in Panaeng Curry. This curry was served with a portion of steamed rice. The curry had a mild flavour and went very well with the rice, and it had ample chicken pieces which were very well cooked. 

Next we ordered their signature Peshawari Naan and paired it with Mutton Rara. And let me tell you, this was one fantastic combo! The naan was stuffed with coconut and dry fruits and went really well with the rich gravy of Mutton Rara. The pieces of mutton were cooked to perfection and tasted divine.

Next up, we chose the Nawabi Pulao, which is again an amazing dish that The Palms has to offer. We coupled this with Fish Hyderabadi, which was a coriander based curry! The fish again tasted beyond my expectations, and the pieces were juicy and succulent. Another delightful combination!

To wash down all of this, we had all ordered Virgin Mojito, which again proved to be quite good!

Even after hogging so much, nothing could deter us from ordering a plate of darsaan with ice-cream, and badam firni. The badam firni was perfect, and being a firni lover, I devoured most of it. The darsaan too, was quite good, but not at par with the firni. I'm biased, I can't help it! 

We had an amazing afternoon at The Palms with some really appetizing and scrumptious dishes! The service was quick which is a plus point. I will come back again to try out some more of their Oriental dishes.

The palms is a fine restaurant in Southern Avenue. I went there twice and I fell for this restaurant. This is one of my favourite restaurants till now. At first I went there on 15th of March as that was my boyfriend's birthday and we wanted to treat ourselves with nice foods. We opted for their combo menu where a starter, a main course a side dish an a dessert come for Rs 349 flat. We ordered-
1. Mahi pahari- this is a kebab style preparation made of fish. The fish was soo fresh, juicy, soft as hell and soo tasty!! I have no words to describe my feelings when I took the first bite!! A must try.
2. Veg pulao- Nothing to say. yuuummmmyyy!!! 
3. Chicken kalimirch- as usual this was also a great side with the pulao. The chicken pieces were large in size and wonderfully made. So soft and flavourful! 
we just finished our north Indian section with so much of satisfaction to our taste buds. Now came the chinese part.
1. Pan fried fish- I must say that this restaurant has mastered themselves in both the sections whether it is chinese or North Indian! I loved this dish soo much!! It was mouth watering. Fresh fish fillets with so much of flavours, sauted to the perfection!! Loved it!!
2. ved fried rice- it was good as well.
3. chicken in green chili sauce- some soft, succulent pieces of chicken dipped into a green coloured sauce which was so tasty that I cannot explain it by words!!
Then after we had finished our coursed meal then Comes the ice cream part. Vanilla ice cream was served and we really enjoyed that after a long journey of eating. 
On my second visit to this place, we were four friends and there was a deal going on and that was buy one get one free. So we just grabbed the deal and treated ourselves again with some awesome foods. But I could not remember the names of the foods I tried but they all were amazingly tasty.
I really recommend this place if you want to try some wonderful food in a finely decorated place then The Palms is the place you are searching for! Just go there and have some food. According to me, the price is very reasonable as they do serve a great quality food with a great quantity! The staffs are very interactive and helpful while choosing from the menu card.

The Palms is one of the finest restaurants in the Southern Avenue region. I had recently visited this restaurant with my friends, and this place deserves every bit of the hype it has.

The interiors are beautiful. The seating, the ceiling and the stonework on the walls look amazing. It was a summer afternoon and we started with Virgin Mojito, which was fizzy and refreshing.

Among starters, the Lamb with Celery and Chinese Greens was excellent. The lamb was well cooked and the steamed veggies were extremely juicy.

The Fish Basil Tikka had an interesting flavour of basil, well marinated over the fish. The fish was soft and delicate.

The Chicken Bhurasi Kebab was a medium spicy chicken kebab. It tasted great.

The last starter was Sev Thikin Prawns, which is a Korean dish. The prawns tasted amazing. However, I would prefer a Prawn Tempura over this anyday !

The main course had a lot of options. My choice was their signature Chicken Paenang Curry. It looked like a type of Red Thai Curry but had a completely different flavour. It was served with steamed rice and tasted brilliant. The chicken pieces were soft and well cooked.

We decided to pair up their Peshawari Naan with Mutton Rara. This was the best combo anybody could ever think of. The naan was loaded with dry fruits and went well with the spicy mutton dish.

We also tried Fish Hyderabadi with Nawabi Pulao. The fish once again had an amazing texture and was cooked in a rich and creamy, coconut based gravy. It perfectly complemented the flavourful pulao.

The quantity of each of these dishes were so huge that all four of us were too full to move to the desserts. We somehow managed to order a Badam Firni and Honey Darsaan. The Darsaan was well prepared, with perfectly crispy honey tossed chips. The quantity, once again amazed us. The Badam Firni tasted excellent. It was rich and loaded with dry fruits.

Overall, The Palms is definitely the place to visit if you're looking to find some exotic cuisines under one roof, like Thai, Korean or Japanese. The food exceeded all my expectations. The menu is quite vast. So I'm coming back super soon to try the other dishes on the menu !

A fusion of the best of Indian, Oriental and Thai-- this is definitely a foodie's Paradise. Located at Southern Avenue, this restaurant is definitely a gem.
Coming to food, had ordered the following:
Starters: Lamb in celery and chinese greens, chicken bhurasi kebab, fish besil tikka, sev thikin prawn, Lung Fung soup chicken, virgin mojito.
Mains: Fish Hyderabadi, veg nawabi pulao, mutton rarha, peshawari naan, panaeng curry chicken.
Desert: Firni,honey darsaan.
But the food quality and taste were impeccable. A special mention for the Lamb, Fish Basil Tikka and the Peshawari Naan.
Definitely a must-visit place. Great job!!!

Went there last saturday on a sultry afternoon. Had heard about all the good reviews from friends previously. Here goes my review.

Ambiance : Very cozy and spacious

Service : Attendants were prompt. Service was good.

Food: We had ordered for a kebab platter. It had chicken mutton, prawn and fish. Every Item was first class.

Along with this, the pan fried chilly chicken was authentic and traditional.  

Drinks. Coconut mojito was okayish...nothing extra ordinary in taste, but donno why is so highly priced.

Mango tango had a spicy tint. Nice.

Main course : Keema Naan with Kandahar mutton. : excellent

Butter chicken : very sweet , not at all authentic. Disappointing.

Lamb with celery greens : Non-spicy dish with veggies.

Overall a good experience. Expected better.

This is our 1st visit in this restaurant. I must say to celebrate my wife's birthday .. really worth it. The ambience, the stewards, the manager .. all r very supportive and well behaved. They helped us to choose the best foods. We ordered Kakori kebab, dry squid, mohini nun (specility of this place), roghuni nun, nawabi ghosth, mango mueller, coco-pineapple dezire, sizzler brownie with ice cream -- each n every foods we ordered .. has its own charm and quality. Surely one of the best restaurant in south kolkata @ pocket friendly cost. Highly recommended.

This place was in my bucket list for a long time..finally visited yesterday. Located on the first floor of the CCD building,it is easy to locate on southern Avenue. The ambience is amazing with pretty positive vibes. Staffs are also cordial and helped a lot in choosing our dinner. Now coming to food..we ordered japanese double fried chicken. Chicken pieces were succulent and tender. It was served with a sweet red wine reduction sauce...tasted divine. We ordered another Khar Khar lamb for starters. I have never had such soft lamb dishes in my entire life. We ordered four mocktails..deep sea, Cinderella, fruit punch. From the Mughal section we ordered makhani karahi, a chicken kebab dish. For main course we ordered burnt garlic chicken chow mein and egg wrapped fried rice and fish in mustard sauce. All the preparations were good and upto the mark. The pocket pinch is a bit higher but overall a good experience. Would surely come back for more.

Elegant, quiet, classy place!!
Awesome decor.
Food was good too.
We ordered:
Makhani karahi chicken: good tandoor flavours, soft and juicy chicken
Double fried chicken (Japanese): tasty, but a bit dry
Khar Khar Lamb (Mongolian): best dish! Super awesome in taste and perhaps the most tender lamb I've ever tasted 
Egg wrapped fried rice: well balanced taste
Chilly garlic noodles mixed: thick noodles so the taste was a bit bland 
Fish in mustard sauce: dish was tasty but did not complement our rice or noodles so it was our poor choice. 
And mocktails, Deep Sea, Cindrella, Heaven's shake and Fruit Punch. All of them were quite refreshing and distinctively tasty!

The location is very easy to locate. Situated just above the southern avenue CCD. It'll be easy if you're coming from the tollygunge side.

The decor is fantastic. Even the stairs leading us up to the restaurant was properly lighted. The restaurant was quite empty with only 2-3 parties.

The staff was very friendly. There was a lady who helped us with the order, and was patient enough to tell us how the specific food item was made, what it tasted like, and what people usually order.

There was this combo 3-course meal offer going on and we ordered that.

For starters-
We ordered the harabhara kebab. It was fantastic. The filling was made with peas. It was moist. A cashew on top and properly roasted. Garnished with more peas and capsicum.
Next comes the Banjara. A chicken kebab which was soft and juicy. 

The last one was my favourite, Mahi ajwani. Succulent bhetki filling with a flavour of ajwain.  Not too much spices added. But tasted fantastic.

Next comes the main course.
Ordered jeera rice, peas pulao, veg pulao. Veg pulao was perfectly cooked. Not too sweet, just the right amount.

We ordered murgh gautie which was lip smacking. The gravy was smooth and consistent. Very much recommended.

Next up was the paneer Karachi. It tasted sweet when we eat it but the after taste was somewhat spicy. A very different taste altogether.

Next was chicken handi. It was plain chicken strips, with lots of spices and chilli flakes as toppings. It was somewhat dry but tasted really nice. 

There were gulab jamun for dessert. It was served hot. Tasted really good. Very soft and melted in our mouths.

We were so impressed with their prompt service that we went for two more dessert items.

One was walnut toffee. Very much recommended. Caramalized walnuts served with vanilla ice cream. Tasted out of the world.

Another must try was the Chocolate darshan.
It looked like a chocolate hill. Fried strips topped with loads of chocolate sauce and a scoop of chocolate ice cream on top. Tastes really good. The quantity served was huge.

Overall, The palms really deserves a 5 because of their decor, staffs, and most importantly the food!

This was in my wishlist for quite sometime,finally got ticked off yesterday.Absolutely classy ambiance,out of the world food and well mannered staffs define the place,We had coconut water mojito,murgh banzara,mahi pahari,wasabi prawn,nizami biryani,murgh noorani and mohini naan.All the dishes were mind blowingly awesome but wasabi prawn deserves special mention.Coated in mayonese with a slight hint of mustard sauce it was an absolute delight for the taste buds.After having it we literally kept on licking our fingers as our heart went on screaming 'super se bhi uper performance'üòÅ!mohini naan n murgh noorani goes perfectly with each other.mahi pahari had a melt in the mouth experience.We were overwhelmed after having all the dishes.overall a highly satisfying experience.

My third visit to this place...really good food. In my last two visits this place was almost empty but today it was fully packed..that was a really good sight.
Food was great all the times.
But today the service was very very ordinary.as if they were not ready to face that much crowd.
1. No attendant at door was available.
2. They were short of crockery, seven people got 4 types of water glasses.
3. No side servings were served with starter, got it after asking for it.
4. They said they dont serve mocktails but as i am a regular i know they do have mocktails and some mojitos were also served on other tables..i dont understand that why do you need to lie.( they should have said its not serviceable at that particular time for whatever reasons) .
5. Main course took hell lot of time to get served.
6. After filling the feedback form the attandent asked me for negative review..i explained all the above points..and the reply i got was "OK".
Special mention: one young attendant was really helpful... But he was also very helpless due to shortage of skilled staff.

I visited this place on 2nd June 2017. Located very close to Kalighat metro station on top of CCD on your way towards Southern Avenue this place is pure bliss. The ambience is very royal like, not as much as Aaira in Park street maybe, but it's pretty much on the higher side. The staff were very cordial. I wanted to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and they were supportive of me taking my own baked cake there. They played songs, gave me a candle and knife and even wished us. I am sure the place would be even more beautiful at night. The view is also very soothing. Coming to the food, they had some of the most lipsmacking cuisines. I tried the North Indian part. I started with the traditional murgh banjara kebabs which were absolutely delicious. 5 on 5 for that. Then came the coconut water mojito, which to me could have been better. Probably a 3.5 for that. Then came Mohini naan and peshawari naan (absolutely fantastic) along with gosht rahra. Overall it was just amazing. I found things a bit heavy but that's how nawabi food is. One downside to the mohini naan is that it hardens up very quickly due to the egg being present in it. Peshawari had a sweet tinge to it which I loved but might cause irritation if taken with something shahi which is also sweet. They ended things with a very friendly lady asking for our feedback. The price was definitely on the higher side. Along with taxes it cost us 1386 for two. Not pocket friendly for sure, but worth a visit. After all, the nawabs wouldn't want you to show insolvency or misery when it comes to tasting their food, would they? 
Cheers and thanks The Palms.
I would have given it a 5, just that I am waiting for something even better.

Indeed the good food for which we visit any restaurants and this restaurant really full fill almost all the parameters of good foods, taste,aromas, quiility and the ambiance and truly deserve 5 star rattings. 

We have enjoyed Paneer karachi, Maharaja Kofta and Murg Gauti with Lacha Paratha and Garlic Nan and Tandoori Lacha Paratha. All foods was awesome and fully satisfied our taste buds the garlic nan was properly baked with perfect garlic touch although other bread was also so good. 

Ambiance is good and service is courteous only we noticed the sofa was too much soft and not pleasing to sit for dinning purposes but chairs are oky.

However a good restaurant for fine dining... I prefer to revisit and recommend.

The restaurant is quite spacious and well lit (I don't like too dimly lit places) with live sports screening.

The staff here is very well mannered and they give good recommendations on which dishes we should try.

PS  The price is also reasonable.

While hunting for a new place for dinner, we stumbled onto this 1st floor chicque restaurant in southern avenue. Easily located just above CCD when u enter from tolly ps side.. this restaurant gives you a stand out feeling. The place is well lit with comfy sitting arrangement. Though the prices might look on the expensive side..but wait till you taste them.. personally i liked the indian delicacy more than the oriental side.. the chineese is more authentic tasting rather then indianish... the indian breads are must try with the prawn and mutton dishes..

There had been very few places that gets a 5 rating on my part. This place is one of them. Which implies the experience was splendid. üòç

Ambience - The decor is just so beautiful with a golden touch. The seating arrangement is huge and the seats were so cosy and comfortable. I loved their music collection that was played when we went to dine in the evening. It had a perfect royal yet romantic setting. Loved it thoroughly. ‚ù§

Food - Had Strawberry Banana Smoothie, Coconut Water Mojito, Golden Fried Crispy Chilli Baby Corn, Chicken Banjara Kebabs, Mohini Naan, Murgh Nurhaani, Pan Fried Chicken Noodles, Fish Cake, Sizzling Brownie with Hot Chocolate topped in Vanilla Ice Cream.
*Coconut Water Mojito - It's a boon to beat the heat for summer. It was so refershing.
*Strawberry Banana Smoothie - It's such a perfect blend of Strawberry and Banana. Looks & tastes perfect! It was sweet to taste yet so good and refreshing. 
*Crispy Chilli Baby Corn was Superb ! After a long time, i loved this here. So a big üëç people. It was crunchy yet not over fried. And the dish was cooked great.
*Chicken Banjara Kebab was good. The pieces were a bit hard. Had it not been so, it would have tasted great. And it was lil cold when it was served. 
*Mohini Naan - It's a completely new concept that I have come across here. It was blended with eggs. But you can't smell that too. Perfecto !
*Murgh Nurhani - It's a red gravy chicken preparation. It had required amount of spice and the chicken pieces were soft and it went well with the Mohini Naan. 
*Pan Fried Chicken Noodles - It was great. The brocollis, carrots and other veggies were cooked so well. The Noodles had a great blend of all these veggies on the top.
*Fish Cake - I personally loved this preparation. These were Bhetki Phillets. As you have this, you can smell of Aroma King lemon and it was so soft and fresh. I loved it to the core.
*Sizzling Brownie with Hot Chocolate topped in Vanilla Ice Cream - This is my must-have dessert wherever I go. So had this here too ! The Brownie was soft but a lil hard on the other side. Had this been soft, it would have been superb. The Chocolate sauce was sufficient and tasted real good with Vanilla Ice Cream. üòç
They had served Papad as complimentary. And I loved the food overall.

Service - As soon  you enter the gate downstairs, climb up the huge stairs and grab your seat, you'll find courteous staffs there. Service time was pretty quick. They are well informed about every details of the place. Hospitality is really really commendable. Kudos to the entire staff team ! Keep the good work up ! ‚ù§

Since this place was great, I would highly recommend you people to visit and have a great time there. üòç

On a afternoon, we went for lunch at The Plams. Thanks to Zomato for booking the table for us. The ambiance is good and the stuff very courteous. 5/5 for the hospitality. Now for the food:

Coconut water mojito....5/5. Have to say it was excellent. No words
Mango shake...5/5. Amazing. Everyone should try this. Not overtly sweet but very light and easy. 

Kakori kebab..3/5. Disappointing. It had a stale aroma attached to it. Didn't feel very fresh. Was not very spicy though but could have been better.

Chicken curry...2/5. I mean seriously. Just a concoction of tomatoes and scrambled pieces of chicken. Let down.

Dal and mixed veg..4/5. Good and basics.

Crisp honey noodles with ice cream...2/5. Very sticky and blunt. The noodles were sticky and ice cream, well, just a plain 10 rupees vanilla ice cream poured over the noodles. Innovation can be thrown out of the window.

Location: walk down southern avenue towards rashbehari crossing, on ur ryt, on top of the ccd there

Decor and ambience: I would term it as a luxurious set up with the Gold touch, cream soft leather sofa chairs and an awesome roadside view, tiled walls which just add to the glamour of the place

Food and menu: Indian and chinese are the basic servings out there.
We tried strawberry banana smoothie and coconut water mojito, both of which were outstanding in terns of texture and taste and more so with their presentation
Next came crispy chilli baby corn which by far is one of the finest I have tasted in Kolkata, chicken banjara kebab, soft succulent pieces of chicken with an awesome taste
Next up was rhe mohini naan, a different ball game altogether, imagine a naan with egg spread on top, and u must be knowing how good a dish it is, a must try
Chicken nurhaani which looks spicy, red curry but is so light on the stomach and such a different Indian delicacy.
Pan fried noodles had the beat mix of fried and gravy noodles, proper amount of veggies and chicken and a perfect oriental taste
Fish cake salt meant round pieces of bhetki fish, with a bit salty zingy taste
Last we tried the brownie sizzler with ice cream which was good too

Staff and service: courteous, helping and joyful staff and a pretty quick service

Overall: a must must visit for everyone!! Awesome place!!

This was on the list for quite sometime and got ticked off yesterday. This family restro has already climbed up the ladder of popular culinary hotshots in the town. We went there a bit late straight from a movie theatre nearby. This place is easy to spot being located on the Southern Avenue end which meets the road going towards rashbehari.

Coming to the decor of the place, it's nicely done. I have. read that the lady behind the restro is an interior designer as well and hence it has been reflected all around. The place is well lit unlike many food joints that are popping up on the heart of this city.The music that was playing was quite going with the mood and that helps in creating the overall ambience.
These are a few things that are important in creating an atmosphere of a place - the music, decor, interiors, the behavior of the staffs,the people - which makes you want to come back for. Its good to see that the hostess the lady who runs the place has kept these points in mind while setting this place up and she had scored well I must say.

Now, another most important part and the part without‚Äã which a review of a restro is meaningless - the Food. Well, what brought me here are the excellent reviews lauding the kebabs and the naans.Thus, I tasted as suggested by the other reviewers. Khumb Galawati kebab (a signature dish), Joojeh Kebabs, and Mahi Pahari came our way right away. Though we found the Khumb Galawati kebabs a bit spicy and it scored a little for my parents, I found it quite tasty apart from being spicy. Peshawari Naan, adorned with little pieces of badam and raisins on the outside and a cheese layer inside , making it sweet and tender. Mohini Naan a name given by their hostess sounds interesting from the name itself.It tastes well and lives up to its name.It literally entices you with its egg wrapping upper crust. We had Murgh Lahori, a gravy with juicy pieces of chicken which perfectly blended with the Naans. Gajar ka Halua, as called by most of the reviewers as the best they had was indeed a dish with the perfect blend of sweetness and flavour. The service was okay.

I would come back for the Oriental cuisine in the near future. I recommend you should try the Naans and don't miss the Gajar ka Halua at any cost. Happy Dining :)

It was the second time I was visiting this restro on the occassion of my brother's treat. I have a belief that this will soon turn out to be my family's new go-to-restro. A classy family restro with nice ambience perfect for a lunch or a dinner for a middle-class Bengali family who loves to dine out. This is how it is transforming itself into. We went for a lunch. The restro was almost empty barring us and another table occupied by a couple. Now, the food was excellent to say the least. Oftentimes‚Äã it happens that the excitement and satisfaction after a first visit is always on the lower side. But not in case of The Palms. The food was as good and satisfactory as the 1st visit. This time the items which were different from the 1st visit was Coconut Mojito, Mahi Pahari, Wasabi Prawns, Murgh Banzara, Biryani and Murgh Noorani.The only item which I had from previous visit was Joojeh Kebab which was exact same in taste as earlier! Which requires special mention from this visit is the Wasabi Prawns. OMG! It's heavenly.Trust me, it's like the best thing on earth for a mayo-cheese lover.I'd not write more except the fact that the Coconut Mojito came in a Coconut shell granished interestingly which catches your attention for sure.

Okay, honestly, I didn't think that this restaurant would be top-notch because I didn't think it would be so popular as I haven't heard of this anything soon. I'm glad to have been proved dead wrong !
Here's a restaurant that has one of the best Managerial staff. Such professionalism ! Much wow !  The food is great and the hospitality is high end. They constantly ask you that "Is the food okay ?" "Are you enjoying your food ?" "Do you need anything else ?" from time to time which tells me that they're very concerned about your experience and that they're taking you much seriously. That is respect, right there. The ambience is so peaceful and full of tranquility. So what are you waiting for ? Get out there and dine in this restaurant before it's too late. You never know when it's your last !

If you are searching for a restaurant that has a great ambience, amazing food and professional staff, well I suggest you to visit this place. I had been there for my birthday celebration and this was my first visit.  I had chicken wings for starters, sliced chicken in green chilly sauce, baby corn and mushrooms in hupak style and chicken fried rice for main course and brownie with vanilla ice cream for dessert. I'm so glad my boyfriend chose this place and it was one hell of an experience.

The Palms is located in Southern Avenue near Kalighat metro station. This restaurant looks classy when you enter and walk up the steps which opens into a spacious dining area with fountains, beautifully decorated objects on the walls. 
I went for lunch with a group of friends, we were already recommended by a few other friends who has recently visited this place. So, we had our order fixed in mind. For starters, we ordered Joojeh Kebab, Kalmi kebab(leg piece), Kasundi Mahi, Stir fried lamb in celery and Chinese greens, Double fried prawn. The Joojeh Kebab was served with thick chicken cubes cooked in Iranian spices including zafran which was medium spicy. The kebabs were crisp from outside and soft and juicy inside. Kalmi kebab is the famous roasted chicken leg piece served with pudina dip. Kasundi Mahi comprises of Bhetki cubes cooked with Indian spices and served with yogurt sauce. The Bhetki tasted so well with a perfect blend of all the spices and the dip complimented it really well. Stir fried lamb in celery and Chinese greens was an experimental dish for us but it turned out to be a success. Lamb pieces were perfectly cooked and the green veggies and the celery was going pretty well with it. A must try for all those who like to eat lamb dishes.
Now, coming to the main course- Kandhari Bhuna, Fish Hara Punjabi, Thai green curry chicken, Peshawari Naan and Keema naan. Keema naan is the usual Keema stuffed naan which is my personal favourite. Peshawari Naan was something new we tried, it was sweet in taste and the stuffing was quite filling. The red curry we ordered along with them made it taste even better. Kandhari Bhuna is a mutton dish served with thick tomato curry and small onion pieces and the combination of the thick and soft mutton and sweet peshawari and spicy Keema naans was heavenly. Fish Hara Punjabi includes pompret slices cooked in mint chutney and green spices- I personally loved it as I love pompret fish. The fish was well cooked and the mint curry has this unique smell which complimented the taste of the dish. Thai green chicken curry is a Thai dish with plain green curry with chicken slices and one has to eat it with plain rice. 
Last but not the least, since a meal is incomplete without desserts, we had to order gajar Ka halwa and sizzling brownie which seemed appealing. Gajar Ka halwa is the famous and my favourite sweet dish which satisfied my sweet tooth immensely. Sizzling brownie was served in a wooden tray with chocolate sauce burning and melting with a choco brownie and a scoop of ice cream. The description is enough to explain the taste. 
I would like to sum up my experience at the Palms, by saying, the ambience is really impressive with large spaces and unique decor. The service is quick and readily available and the staff are friendly enough to help you whenever you need. The food is commendable starting from the presentation of the dishes to the taste and the quantity is also to be noticed. The price is a little on the higher side but the experimentations and the uniqueness they have brought in to their menu deserves the hype. I would definitely suggest everyone to dine out at the Palms.

The waiting area doesen't have any kind of ventilation or atleast even a fan. Though the food makes up for that. For starters we took Tandoori Chicken and Konji Crispy Chicken. Both of them were delicious. For the main course we took Hyderabadi Dum Biriyani, Nizami Biriyani, Gosh Bhuna and Kadhai Chicken. All of them were top notch. If you have grown tired of the typical Bangali Biriyani and want to try some new variants of the dish, this is the place for you. Would love to visit this place very shortly again to explore the other Cuisines this place serves.

A brightly lit up restaurant that has a very luxe and classy look..love the tufted chairs and sofas..this place has window seats which is great for people who have a thing for it!
We ordered crispy chilli babycorn,murgh banjara,peshawari murgh,butter nan and Hyderabadi biryani!
babycorn was incredibly crispy and gladly didn't lose its crunch as we ate..it's annoying when it happens..chopped sweet garlic sticking to the babycorn pieces made the dish taste yummier!
They've got their mughlai stuff spot on!
Murgh banjara is the star of their kabab menu!one of the best chicken kababs I've had!
Nan was soft and buttery..the peshawari chicken was a bowl of boneless chicken pieces in a delicious creamy gravy which had a nice kick of cheese!
biryani was perfect with really soft and succulent meat topped with lovely brown onions!!
Portion size is very good and the price of the food is little on the higher side!
I'm sure all the mughlai food freaks will have a ball at The Palms!

Went there for the first time to celebrate Mother's day. The ambience of the restaurant is quite impressive. We ordered Hyderabadi Dum Biriyani (gosht)at first but they couldn't provide it. So we were very disappointed. Then we decided to try out the Chinese dishes. The quality of the food was really good and the quantity they provided was enough for two people. But somehow I felt that the service was very slow.

2.5 hrs after placing order with zomato, got a call from the restaurant that they have terminated their contract with zomato and are not taking online orders. This after zomato repeatedly confirmed and assured me that the order was on the way. Poor management by zomato üëé. The poor rating above is for zomato

The restaurant is kind of OK. The decor is pretty good. It caters to Indian and Oriental cuisine and serves some unique dishes.

Pros:
1) Serves some unique dishes
2) Some of the foods and drinks are really tasty. Refer recommendation section below.
3) The staffs are well behaved
4) The owner (she seemed so) was present and took time out to meet the guests personally and explained how some of the dishes were prepared.
5) Very conveniently located

Cons 
1) One of the dishes (Mutton boi kebab) was not well cooked. It was unpalatable. When we mentioned that, they took them away. They supposedly re-cooked them and brought back, but the Boti kebab was still not cooked well. But was somehow palatable this time.
2) The head service staff, was not at all informed. He need some real training. He could not explain any of the dishes and referred to the waiters working under him for the same. It seemed that he was not aware of the names of all the dishes, but still came to take the order.
3) The service could have definitely been better.
4) we ordered a fish kebab. It was mentioned in the menu as Bhetki, but seemed to be Basa.

Recommendations
Mango Tango - drink
Green apple mojito - drink
Koobideh - starter
Chicken Noorani - chicken side dish

Four of us visited and the bill amount was between Rs 3500 - 4000.
The food was Ok, but the bottom line is, at this cost you will get much better food and service in Kolkata.

When I heard the name for the 1st time it seems quite unique. But the best part what drew my attention is the owsum review of this restaurant in zomato.

‚ô† Location:
_______________

It is in southern avenue. From kalighat metro, go towards the lane of southern avenue. It is 3 mins walking distance from metro. Situated on the upper floor of the CCD.

‚ô† Ambiance
________________
The ambiance is quite good. The light and simple decoration actually will draw your attention.

‚ô† Food
_____________
So, let's start the main highlight of the restaurant.

¬© Starters
______________
‚úì Murg Banzara : it is basically a chichekn kebab. Very good in taste.
‚úì shredded crispy lamb in Peking style: you will find this one in their chinies menu. And this taste just superb. It was that good, even in our main courses we ordered another plate of it.
‚úìkonjee crispy chicken: very nice. Chicken were soft and juicy also.
‚úì mutton kakori kebab: excellent one. One of the best mutton kebab I ever had.

¬© Main courses
__________________

‚úì Mohini Nun: this one is just superb. Nun garnished with egg. So, you will get the little flavour of omlet with nun. Excellent one.
‚úìNihari: mutton nihari. Another gem. Excellent in taste.
‚úì Kandahari Bhuna : this one is boneless mutton cooked with onion and tomato. Excellent one.
‚úì Hakka mixed noodles: it's a okay one. Nothing special about it.
‚úì Prawn in choice of sauce: very good in taste. Prawn very juicy. Very well prepared.
‚úì Sliced chicken in gravy : chinies preparation. Decent one.

¬© Beverages:
________________
‚úì Coco pineapple delight: the main attraction is the decoration. They serve it in a coconut itself. Drink was nice. But decent one.
‚úì Heavens Calling: presented in a big glass. Decoration seems to be very attractive, but the taste is not that good.
‚úì Deep sea : the drink of blue lagoon type. Nice one.
To me this one stand out among all the mocktail we tested. We took it twice.
‚úì Coconut Cucumber mint: The presentation of the drink is very eye catchy. they present the beverages in a jug and crushed ice in the glass. Had a lot of expectation with it, but a little disappointed.It was decent in taste.

¬© Dessert:
_______________
‚úì gulab jamun : ok it was good in taste. And yes nothing to describe about it for sure :)
‚úì Date pancakes: this was was very good in taste. The texture and taste of the pancake was just appropriate. It was presented with scoop of vanilla ice cream.
‚úìwalnut toffee: presented with vanilla ice cream. Nice, very nice.

To summarise all the food, the experience is superb. Their main courses, starter are just stand out. The noodles we felt a little dull.
Yes, the owner gave a good attention in our taste and liking. She suggested good items we should try, and yes in future we will taste that for sure.

In gist: food are excellent and superb. Dessert are good. But I felt the beverages section they need to improve, presentation wise it's superb, but it is not that tastey.

To management: you guys are doing excellent. Just a small suggestions I felt to conveyed you as mentioned above. the quality, hospitality is just owssum.

To All
_________

Just give it a try. You will like it for sure.

All that cost 5782 for 6 heads.

So, till my next review happy fooding :)

Great food with unique and innovative dishes from more than just one cuisine.A well descriptive menu and a "special buy one get one free offer"on special days is surely an added bonus. There is rich variety in taste and artistry. Price is quite reasonable and ambience is really soothing. Really had a good time there.

We went there to celebrate our mom and dad's 32nd marriage anniversary. Although the rating on zomato was 4.5 yet since it was going to be our first experience, we were a little apprehensive. Little did we know that the ambience, service and the food would soon leave us enchanted! For starters we had ordered awadhi kebabs and in the main course we thought of trying out the chinese cuisine. We ended our gourmet delight with virgin mojitos. Loved the place so much that decided to write in a few lines of appreciation and share our experience with all of you.

Situated just beside Cafe Coffee Day The Palms, is one of its kind. They have two types of cuisines.....oriental and indian. From the oriental part we tried Chinese, Japanese, and from the indian section we tried just a kebab. We were 2 and ordered Glass noodles soup with bean curd and mahi ajwani as starter. Then for the main course we opted for phad siew and devil's chicken. Phad siew is  Japanese noodles....hakka type. The devils's chicken was literally very different from those which I had in other restaurants. Overall a maginificient experience. The pocket pinch was also not very much. The total bill was 1603/-. And, last but not the least Mr. Alam helped us a lot to order the menu and his friendly and courteous nature is quite appreciable. If u r bit confused with the menu, take the help of Mr. Alam, you would never fail.

The Palms is famously known for its Awadhi & North Indian cuisines. Located very conveniently on the ever romantic Southern Avenue, the palms offers great food topped with an even better decor. We tried the Virgin Mojito ,Joojeh kebab,stir fried lamb in celery & chinese greens double fried prawn.

In the mains we opted for kandhari bhuna
fish hara punjabi ,Thai green curry chicken & peshawari naan ‚úåüèΩ
Excellent place & a must visit if you are nearby. Highly recommend üëçüèº

This multi cuisine eatery, located right beside the CCD in Southern Avenue ,has been there for some time and has been slowly building its base among the foodies of Kolkata. I was invited to a food tasting event there and had quite a pleasing experience.

The place has a gold and off white color theme giving it a simple yet plush feel.The tables are very well spaced out and the customer feels a sense of privacy and comfort.
The menu has a great mix of North Indian and Asian delicacies . The owner Mrs Priyadarshini was gracious enough to recommend a few dishes after understanding our tastes and preferences.

Here are the items that we had during our lunch meetup -

Drinks And Starters -
Virgin Mojito - It had a nice balance of the lime and mint flavours.

Joojeh Kebabs - Very well marinated and juicy kebabs . Though they appear similar to Reshmi kebab ,they have unique flavours.

Kalmi Kebab - This was somewhat like a Tangri Kebab with pudina being the distinguishing factor in its flavour.

Mahi Kasundi - The bhekti has the just the right amount of the kasundi flavour in it. As a result, it tasted divine and was among my top picks.

Stir Fried Lamb in Celery and chinese greens - The lamb was sliced into flat chunks and tossed in an oriental sauce with the vegetables.It was quite delectable.

Double fried prawn - Sizeable prawn pieces fried in a hot sauce. It had that slight crunch and was scrumptious again.

Main Course -

Peshawari Naan - The naan has dry raisins and cashew embedded in it.Therefore the flavours are naturally on the sweeter side.It combined really well with the spicy bhuna mutton.

Fish Hara Punjabi - This one had really unique flavours with a coastal essence .

Kandhari Bhuna - The masala in this was extremely delectable. The mutton was also juicy and well cooked.

Thai Green curry with steamed rice - This one broke the monotone of the Indian flavours and gave me a glimpse into their asian specialities. The coconut milk based curry had an amazing combination of flavours.

Desserts -

Sizzling brownie and Gajar ka Halwa -

A few spoons of these desserts made it a complete and satisfying meal .

Not much can go wrong with the combination of brownie and icecream.It was delicious!

Although the halwa could have had more bite to it ,it had the perfect level of sweetness.

All in all , I had a satiating experience. The service was quite prompt and amicable as well.Therefore, I believe, 'The Palms' is here to stay in the demanding and extremely competitive hospitality sector of Kolkata.

A visit to The Palms, located strategically at the confluence of Southern Avenue and S.P. Mukherjee Road, had always been on my foodie hitlist since it pulled up the shutters some time back. Now, with a grand invitation to try out their enticing set of offerings, I finally set sail to the much awaited food journey at this fairly new restaurant.

We were greeted by the owner, Ms. Priyadarshini, who was really sweet and helped us navigate through the extensive set of Oriental and Indian dishes The Palms had on offer.

‚òÖ Ambiance : The well polished interiors of this place allows a pretty large seating capacity and simultaneously keeping a decent clearance between the tables. The chairs and wallpapers exhibit a simple yet sophisticated look to the place, plus the overall warm lighting arrangements complimenting the same.

‚òÖ Food : We decided to go for a mix of Chinese and Thai in the starters while keeping the main course fixed on their North Indian fare. 

(i) Mocktails : The sultry Kolkata summer demands mocktails like a must for every meal. So we started off with Coconut Mojito and Mango Mullan. Served inside a daab, the definitely overpowering lime flavor with the mild undertone of coconut water and mint made the Coconut Mojito quite a hit. The Mango Mullan was the sweet and simple summer mocktail, albeit a little too sweet for me, would be heaven for the sweet-toothed mango-loving foodie.

(ii) Takrai Gai : The lip-smacking Thai starter was a rollercoaster of flavours enclosing soft, juicy chunks of boneless chicken. One of the best starters ever.

(iii) Double Fried Prawns : Super soft, super spicy and double as tasteful. Must try for those who love the added dose of spice. 

(iv) Peshawari Naan : Moving on to the North Indian main course, the house special Peshawari Naan went on the sweet road with its filling of nuts, coconut milk cream and dry raisins, resulting in a delectable naan which sounds perfect with a spicy side dish, which in our case was Fish Amritsari. *heaven*

(v) Fish Amritsari : Perfect complement to the Peshawari Naan. The fish was really soft and the gravy being quite spicy (not very hot though), ended up creating a brilliant lip smacking main course. 

‚òÖ SERVICE / HOSPITALITY : Absolutely no comments. The entire process starting from the order to the serving was assisted very nicely by Ms. Priyadarshini and the staff. The people attending to the tables were well versed in the different items available, making ordering new dishes off the menu look like cakewalk.

Overall, I loved each and every bit of the dining experience. Will be visiting again very soon.

‚úì Trivia : The restaurant boasts of two executive chefs respectively in charge of the Oriental and Indian parts of the menu. This makes The Palms two speciality restaurants clubbed under a single roof!

: We are not jack of two cuisines,we are master of two.

The tagline of The Palms itself tells you what to expect inside. They have two expert chefs for the two cuisines namely oriental and north indian. As we went there as a part of a food tasting event planned by FoodZpah, we decided to give both the types a try.

We ordered :

1. Coconut water mojito : It was served inside a raw coconut (daab). The flavour of coconut was suppressed due to the strong flavour of lemon and soda.. But it was very refreshing nevertheless.

2. Mango mulan : This was a mango-cucumber-mint-lemon based mocktail. It was little too sweet but not that disappointing.

3. Takrai gai : It was a Thai starter of chicken. The chickens pieces were succulent and flavoured with rich spices. Highly recommended.

4. Double fried prawns : This was my favourite of the meal. Six big prawns tossed in a spicy sauce. It was mouth watering! A definite recommendation.

5. Peshawari naan : It is a speciality of the place. A naan with creamy coconut filling and topped with almonds and raisin. If you have a sweet tooth, you'll love it. If you don't, you can still give it a try. Its innovative.

6. Fish amritsari : It was fish in a rich red gravy. It was a perfect pair to the naan. The fish was soft and very well flaoured.

The staff were very well behaved and ready to help us always. The owner herself was catering to each and every table giving her friendly suggestions and helping everyone to order the best thing according to their taste buds.
The ambience of the place is beautiful with bright lights and cushioned chairs and couches. Its a perfect place both for a romantic date and a family dinner. Will come back soon.

What a superb new entry to the dining scene in kolkata.Located in southern Avenue this place is quite talked about as of late.
Started off with with their refreshing Virgin Mojito -definitely goes into one of my Favourites, since it's well made.
STARTERS -
Joojeh Kebabs - Appeared to be like Reshmi s but tasted different,loved the way it was prepared,well marinated.
Kalmi Kebabs - Tangri kebabs as we know it,had a unique palak, garlic gravyish thing inside.
Mahi Kasundi - As suggested by a senior reviewer,was in awe of the freshness the fish had.worth mentioning,not too overwhelming a mustard taste to go along with that.
Stir Fried Lamb in Celery & Chinese Greens - By far one of my favorites.
Double Fried Prawn - A Chinese delicacy,with fried onions and a Chinese dried gravy.
MAIN COURSE-
Kandahari Bhuna - This Mutton preparation was so well prepared,Bhuna Mutton with a twist.Must try.
Fish Hara Punjabi - A wonderful dish which went so well even with the naans.
Chicken Thai Green Curry - A must try if you want to try something other than their Indian dishes.
Keema Naan & Peshawari Naan - Peshawari Naan was on the sweeter side with Cashew and Raisins.
And last but not the least :D
DESERT -
Sizzling Brownie & Gajar Ka Halwa :)

This is located on the entrance of southern avenue (northern flank).landmark would be the CCD which is located on the ground floor of the same building.the patrons would have to take few steps to climb up as this multi cuisine is on the first floor.
I had asked for murgh banzara kebab  for the starter.it was delectable, mouth watering.the aroma of the nizami biriyani was appetizing.it was served with two portions of chicken.
Murgh lahori was slighty greenish in colour.it was creamy, delicious.
The service was somehow i felt to be little slow.

Following zomato's suggestions, I decided to visit this place. Had the kasundi fish and my taste buds thanked me for ordering this. However the jhinga biryani failed to live up to my expectations after reading all the reviews. While I haven't tasted quite a lot but being a die hard fan of biryani all hells break loose if biryani isn't good.

Well on the occasion of my birthday we went to this restaurant seeing the fine ambience and the decor appreciable . We ordered mohini nun, peshwari nun, prawn dum biriyani, chicken biriyani and 2 dishes of chicken . Well I must admit that the taste of the food were unique but we got highly dissatisfied with the dessert section. A date pancake costing Rs.200+ was highly dissatisfying! The ambience was just fine but the restaurant not noticeable because of the small entrance beside a large CCD. The overall rating is good though a slight change is the dessert menu section would be appreciable.

The experience at Palms was deeply satisfying and is perhaps my best restaurant experience till now. The restaurant is located in Southern Avenue beside the CCD outlet over there. The place is extremely well lit and decorated. Right from entering the place, you get an impression which sets up your mood for a delightful lunch. We were a group of 9 and had Mahi Koli Bara, Makhani Karahi and Chilli American Corn for starters. The Chilli American Corn tasted sweet and wonderful, the Makhani Karahi was delicious and the Mahi Koli Bara pieces were soft and tasty. We had Nizami Biriyani, Murgh Zafran Biriyani and Murgh Baghmati for main course which tasted heavenly. Further we also had Kandhari Bhuna where the pieces of mutton were soft and tasty and the gravy tasted incredibly good, Kashmiri Dry Fruit Pulao, Paneer Karachi, Mixed Fried Rice and Sliced Chicken With Oyster Sauce. To finish off an incredibly delightful meal, we had Gulab Jamun with Ice Cream and Hot Choco Brownie which tasted great as well. The staff were immensely courteous and well behaved. They even gave us a discount of Rs.200/- put a cap on the wonderful experience at¬† Palms.

We went there last week for my friend's birthday treat. This was in our wish list since a long time. This place is located on the left, just as you enter Southern Avenue after crossing Rashbehari more. The locality is quaint and serene. The restaurant is on the first floor, you have to enter through the stairs beside the CCD located on the ground floor. The decor is very pleasant and crisp and you get a nice view too if you get the seats by the window side. 
Coming to the food, we ordered Pan Fried Chilli Chicken, Murgh Banjara, Nawabi Biryani, Murgh Peshawari, tandoori rotis and Butter naans. The Pan Fried chilli chicken was yum with very tender pieces of chicken. The Murgh Banjara kebab was melting in the mouth. The chicken was moist and succulent. It was served with a green and a red dip. The Biryani was delicious! It had 2 chicken pieces and the serving was enough for two people. It was served with raita. The Murgh Peshawari was a perfect blend of cashew paste and spices with tender chicken pieces. It was on the sweeter side and very delicious. 
We were very well tended to as the staff was very prompt and kept taking our feedback. The owner herself took care of the customers. Service was fast too.
Moreover we were given free roasted papads to hogg onto during the waiting time! 
A great experience! :)

This is from my visit a week back.
Looking for a decent place to go out for dinner with my family of 10, and that is also not too far from where we live, I suggested this place, as I had heard good things from many.
The place is pretty, well maintained and is quite spacious, unlike the new restaurants across the city that are cramped for room.
Located on the first floor, just above the Cafe Coffee Day (CCD) outlet, the one opposite to Tollygunje Thana(Police Station), near Rashbehari crossing.
Or if you're coming from Bhowanipur side, take the diagonal lane heading towards southern avenue/lake as soon as you cross the Rashbehari‚Äã crossing, and you'll find it on your left.

It's definitely one of those places with good decor and nice ambience where‚Äã you can visit with your 'Big family' for a heartening meal without a second thought.
The food was really good and the service was quick.
We tried out many dishes from the Buy 1 Get 1 menu and it's definitely worth highlighting.
One more thing I definitely would like to mention would be regarding the service. Although we reached a bit late there, (like around 9:30pm) and stayed there till around 11:30 which actually well beyond their closing time of 11pm; not at any moment of time were we made to feel unwanted. This is worth appreciating, taking into mind the behavior of staff at other much hyped places across the city where they start throwing tantrums even if you're entering at around 2:30 for lunch.
The staff there always had a smile to their faces and were very polite. And if it were to them, they would have let us stayed there for some more time.

To conclude, all I would want and wish is that they continue this good work and maintain the food quality all along. Coz good food definitely makes customers come back again n again.
I am definitely gonna recommend this place and would surely make more visits to this place soon.

This restaurant opened at the 1st floor of CCD in southern avenue. Very easy to locate and walking distance from Rashbehari crossing.
Went there one fine evening with family. To our utmost surprise we were the only customers. 
Anyway the decor is pretty impressive. It's spacious and behaviour of staffs was helpful. We ordere Seafood soup, Murg kalimirch , Veg Nawabi Pulao, Kashmiri Dry Fruit Pulao. Overall food quality is standard. Kashmiri dry fruit Pulao is worth mentioning.

This place was in my wish list for a very long time. Didn't have any plans to visit the place yesterday itself but one circumstance led to another and I ended up visiting this place without any reservation or pre-planning. Nevertheless, we were a group of 3 people and when we reached the restaurant was almost full leaving 2-3 tables empty. We settled ourselves on those comfortable chairs and hence took the first step towards an amazing food journey there. 
The ambience of the restaurant is calm and soothing. The decoration is minimalistic yet has a touch of class and elegance. As mentioned earlier the chairs are really very comfortable and I guess‚Äã the sofas are too. The place is brightly lit and everything about the place has a positive vibe which according to me is very important because it sets the mood for the forthcoming food journey there. 
Coming to the food we ordered Pan Fried Chilli Chicken and Murg Banjara as starters. Nizami Biryani,  Murg Peshwari as the main course and Butter Naans and Tandoori Roti as well. 
The Pan fried Chilli Chicken had a three chilli sign beside it on the menu card. We thought it would be very spicy. Since one of my friends isn't fond of too spicy food, we asked them to make it a little less spicy. But when the dish was served and I tasted it I found it to be on the sweeter side instead. Though it didn't taste bad at all but it was not entirely my kind of dish though my friends enjoy it quite well. 
The Murg Banjara is a chicken kebab marinated with besan yoghurt and some other spices and char grilled or tandoor-ed. Since it mentions besan as an ingredient many people might think that it is batter coated with besan and then fried or something but this dish is not at all close to any batter coated chicken preparation. It a delicious kebab, which was perfectly tandoored and had some awesome smoked flavours along with the flavours of other spices with which it was marinaded. I would recommend everyone to try this dish out. It is different from all other kebabs that are generally found in restaurants. 

For the main course, we wanted to try their hyderabadi dum biryani but was confused whether it contains dry fruits because neither my friend nir I like dry fruits in our biryani. When we asked one of their staffs, he informed us that it does not have any dry fruits but have the flavour of mint. On hearing this we changed out mind and ordered the Nizami Biryani instead. The biryani arrived in a handi with two pieces of chicken. It is an amazing biryani. I am a lover of kolkata biryani and was a believer that biryani without that potato is not biryani until yesterday. The biryani was an awadhi style biryani. It didn't have any potato but it was packed with flavours. It is one of the best biryanis I have had till date. It had the right amount of spices with some coriander leaves. It tasted so right to the tastebuds that I will return to this place only to have another spoonful rather plateful of this amazing biryani. Talking about the quantity, if someone has medium appetite, it is good enough for two people and it has two pieces of chicken too, so sharing won't be an issue. Same goes to those who have already eaten too many starters. But for a hungry soul, who just want to indulge in the flavours of the biryani and have a really good appetite, it would be good for a single person. 
The Murg Peshwari was amazing. It is a white gravy chicken dish which tastes heavenly. It has a rich and royal flavour. The gravy made with cashew paste cream and the entire dish was lip-smacking. 
Unlike in some other places, their tandoori rotis were soft. The butter naan was also perfectly made. 
They even served us complimentary masala papad when we were waiting for our main course to arrive. The papads were spicy and tasted good. 
The service was prompt. All the staffs were really attentive. Whether refilling the glass whenever it became empty to serving us each dish not only once but more than that, they did it all by themselves and we didn't have to do call them to get their attention which is really appreciable. 
There was a lady who I guess is the owner of the restaurant came and asked whether we liked the food especially the biryani because it was not a kolkata style of biryani. 
The prices are reasonable because even after ordering so many things, the bill came out to be rs. 1452 only for three people. 
I loved the place very much and would definitely visit again to try out other dishes. üòä

IMPECCABLE! üíØ
From location, to interiors, to food and to service everything can be summed up by this word.
Situated above CCD in southern avenue, the place is easy to spot.
As soon as you enter a grand staircase takes you to the restaurant which is on the first floor.
Just as you get in, you can see the small yet beautiful fountain adorning the place. The mesmerising interiors are done by none other than the owner of the place, Priyadarshini Dey. 
Now coming to my favourite part i.e. food.
I tried the following items:
Virgin Mojito: Very refreshing. 
Kumbh Gulaoti: Must try for mushroom lovers.
Veg Pancakes: Little bit on spicy side but very delicious.
Thai Red Curry with Rice: The curry was delectable and the flavours were authentic.
Gajar ka Halwa: Undoubtedly the best gajar ka halwa I have ever eaten. Now I no longer have to wait for winters to eat this dessert.
The service was top notch and the staff is very efficient.
The price is reasonable for fine dining experience.

One of the best places i have ever visited. The staff behavior as excellent and the best i have ever seen in any restaurant. They take special care of any choices you make and recommend dishes accordingly. Since I have a sweet tooth i tried Mango fuller mocktail, jooje kabab, Peshwari Naan and a chicken preparation. Ended with butter scotch ice cream. The peshawari naan was too good as was the jooje kabab. Please try both of them when you visit, and also try to soak in the hospitality of the place. You may not get it in other restaurants of the city.

Okay, so after reading lots of good things about this place on Zomato, I decided to drop in here with my fiance. My first thought was that the decor was very soothing and the interiors tastefully done. The staff were extremely courteous and attentive. The dining area was very spacious and squeaky clean. Now, about the food...we ordered Joojeh Kebab for starter and then moved on to Veg Nawabi Polao with Gosht Achari for the main course. Every single dish was absolutely delicious. The quantity was sufficient for two. The price was also perfectly reasonable. ¬†Overall, it was a special occasion for us, that day, and its safe to say 'The Palms' only did make it more memorable.So, I'd suggest you go for this place mainly for 4 things : ¬†Great food, beautiful ambience, prompt & wonderful staff and convenient location (Near Medinova/CCD on Southern Avenue).

Location:ThePalms is located in Southern Avenue,near Tollygunge police station.

Ambience : The first thing which attracts you is their interiors which in nicely designed.Staffs and management are very well behaved. You will hardly find a restaurant where the management person will come personally to you for feedback of the each dishes .Actually it's feel like home when someone is serving you with a smiling face.

Foods:

Starters:

Stir fried lamb with celery and chinese greens:delicious,delectable and divine.

Double fried prawns:it's spicy and enjoyable which i really like,prawns lover must try it.

Joojeh Kebab:it's soft and mouthwatering,terrific in taste.

Mahi Kasundi: it's tantalizing,kasundi flavour gives it another level.

Khumb Galawaty:One of the best starters of The Palms,it's highly recommended.

Spicy Onion Pancake: it's crunchy and enjoyable,but little oily.

Main Course:

Peshawari Naan:It is one of the signature dishes of them.I just loved it.Have never find a better naan in kolkata.It's amazingly tasty and wonderful.

Mohini: It's also a type of naan containing egg.You will get it's original taste by taking it immediately after serving,it's enjoyable.

Rahra Gosht:You can enjoy it with the Mohini naan,mutton is tasteful and scrumptious,must try dish.

Murgh Peshawari : it's also a flavoring dish with gravy,but i will suggest don't go for chicken when you have already tasted Mutton of Fishes.

Fish Hyderabadi: I am a fish lover and tasted many types of fishes from continental to Indian.I found this Indian main course one of the best,the softness of the fish and typical hyderabadi taste gives it a thumps up.

Veg Nawabi Polao: It's tasty and enjoyable.

Dessert:

Sizzing Brwonie with Hot Chocolate Sauce topped with Vanilla Ice cream: Attracting,amazingly tasty,the brownie is over the top.

Classic crispy honey Darshan:Honey gives it another level with the ice cream,a highly recommended dessert of them.One of the best dessert I have ever tasted.Heavenly feeling.

Gajar Ka Halwa: Many few places are there which can serve a standard gajar ka halwa and I am very choosy over this dish.The halwa which i tasted here is marvellous,it's a home feeling taste.Highly recommended.

Thank you The Palms for this amazing experience.

Recently visited this beautiful restaurant above cafe coffee day near tollygunge police station and lets just begin by saying it was a wonderful experience. 
Ambiance : brightly lit and very spacious. Perfect for date nights or family dinners. 
Service : Very very friendly and courteous. And the dishes were served quite fast. 
Food : Now this restaurant is famous for both cuisines Indian and Oriental. So you can either mix it up like i did or stick to one. 
What you should not miss ? 
1.Stir fried lamb with celery and Chinese green - absolutely yummy and tasty. 
2.Mahi kasundi - a fish preparation from the indian section 
3. Gosht Rahra - rich and juicy (mutton dish)
4. Peshwari naan - only if you like sweet naans dont miss it because its very different. 
5. Veg nawabi pulao - perfectly blended with the sides that was ordered. 
6. Gajar ka halwa - creamy and heavenly
7. Honey darsaan with vanilla ice cream is a favourite dessert of mine and it was perfect here but special mention to the quantity , 4 people could have it. 
Few other dishes which also caught my eye was the brownie with ice cream and the khumb galwaty (veg) 

Lets just say this restaurant offers a fine dinning experience for both the cuisines which is hard to find in kolkata, at a reasonable price .

Palms is one of the finest dining place in Southern Avenue. Just 2 mins walk from Kalighat Metro this place is above the Cafe Coffee Day. Food and ambiance at Palma will make you fall in love with it. We went in a group and tasted many of their dishes. Here are few that I really loved at The Palms.
.
Mocktalis :
Coconut,cucumber,Mint cooler- Love the presentation and aroma of mint makes this Mocktalis extremely refreshing and good in taste.

Pink Island: This one also great in taste.
We had also Cinderella, Heaven's calling, Fruit punch,
Coconut water Mojito, Spicy Mint Mojito, Banana strawberry, all are equally good and refreshing also.
.
Now coming to the food.
@Starters of these place are all amazing and delicious.
* Joojeh kabab: This one will make you feel like going back again and again.
* Shami Kabab : Good in taste.

By the time we ended with Kebab were much excited for their delicious Mutton Hydrabadi Biryani. The Biryani was so good, the aroma, the rice and the Hydrabadi feel was so visible.
We had their Naan, Peshwa Naan and Keema Naan. The Keema Naan was excellent. The inside stuffing was really good.
With the Naan we had Murgh Lahori and Gosht Rahra. Both of them went really well.
.
When we ended with the mains we were too full. But still couldn't give up on the desserts. Took their Gajar ka Halwa, my all time favorite. It was amazingly good.
.
Service was no doubt extraordinary. The ambiance is worthy for a classy dining. The stairs at the very entrance is so good for taking pictures. And a list of good things about this place.
I will visiting here again.
Recommend highly

Now this a tough one to review. On the occasion of Poila Boishakh, I visited the Palms. It's located very conveniently just opposite to Tollygunge P.S! The decor is nice. The ambiance was also good. However, there was no one to greet us. There was noone to serve the water and provide us with the Menu Card. After asking for the Menu Card repeatedly we got it after 10 mins. Ordered Peshwari Naan, Peshawari Murgh, Nihari. The food was served within 10-15 mins and was absolutely delicious. The Peshawari Naan is highly recommended. Repeatedly ask for the bill, and they took 20-30 mins to give the bill. So to sum it all up, great food , great ambiance but horrible horrible service. They did give a reason that they were short staffed on the particular day. So 1 marks deducted because of the service. However I will be going back surely as the food is too good. Happy Eating!

This place is located opposite of Tollygunge police station beside CCD. Ambience is lovely. Specially i liked the mini fountain.Coming to the food at first we ordered starter, mushroom pepper garlic. It was delicious. Honestly after having this we were half full. Then we decided to have makhani nun & murgh peshwari. But the waiter suggested to take murgh kalimirchi. We didn't like it. I mean it tasted normal. Gravy was okay but the chicken tasted below average. Thats the reason i gave 4/5. After having main courses we were full, so we decided to skip dessert. Service is great. Would like to visit again.

A hot sunny day and my stomach grumbled for some shades... That's how I landed in 'the palms'
Located very near to the kalighat metro station...It was an easy place to find( Google baba ki Jay!)..Just to hop-cross a bunch of staircases and u land in d place.
I was pleased with the simple yet elegant dining area..decorated with ample lights... Fountain...And plush leathery sofas and chairs.it has a nice view of d road as well.
The first surprise was..they were having a Thursday special menu where u can buy one dish and get another one (from d special menu) absolutely free.
We ordered for the starters...Naram Dil and mutton galauti kebab and mahi Pahari ...Naramdil is ...I must say a must-try.its a veg kebab with paneer and green herbs..But it's taste is gonna surely melt ur heart!
Galauti kebab was good but not very special ..I have tasted better than it.mahi Pahari is a green veg based fish kebab and it's good too.but for me, naram Dil was d showstopper.
For d.main course we mix-n-matched veg and non veg...We had mohini naan...Khumb bori kebab..Murgh kalii mirch.
Mohini Nan was a special rendition of Nan...Smeared with egg and spring onion..sounds seductive ryt? It is. 
Khumb (mushroom) biriyani was a new taste to my palate and I must say it was good.murgh Kali mirch is a so-so dish
We completed d journey with gajar ka halawa and it was a beautiful dessert with exact balance of sweetness. 
The stuffs were well behaved, prompt service and helpful...made d experience a delightful one.
Lastly bout d Price... It is very reasonable and they offer u huge quantity so a big thumbs up for that.. Actually I think I shud give two thumbs up considering d 'buy one get one free' offer! B-)
Highly recommended place and would love to b back with a larger gang very soon!
Cheers and thanks! Happy eating! :)

Located near the tollygunge police station, this place was a total beauty. The interiors are posh with a refreshing fountain and yellow lights flooding the entire room. A perfect ambience for enjoying a nice cozy lunch or dinner with your special someone. 

Now coming to the food, we decided to skip on the starters and go directly for drinks and main course. We ordered the Mango Tango which was a spicy mango drink and tasted amazing. The second drink we had was the Strawberry Smoothie which was a thick fruit drink with the perfect blend of sweetness. I personally did not like it much, but my friend quite liked it. For the main course we opted for the Prawn Dum Biryani, Murgh Gautie, Fish Hyderabadi, Peshawari Naan, and Mohini Naan. The Biryani comes without any aloo, so make sure you keep it in mind if you try ordering it. But trust me guys, it is worth a try. Infact i would opt for this dish over the traditional aloo Biryanis we get in the city anyway. The Peshawari naan is something you HAVE to order if you are bored of the usual naans and want something "haatke". It was sweet and soft and unlike any naan I have ever tried. Definitely planning to reorder the next time I am there. The only thing that you need to remember is it is sweet, so go for a spicy side dish with it. The Fish was thoroughly loved by me and all my friends. Soft and succulent, and a must try for fish lovers.

For dessert we opted for the gajar ka halwa and Date Pancake. Both of them were delicious. Especially the halwa. I am not a huge fan of pancakes, but my fellow friend raved about it all throughout. It also came with a scoop of vanilla icecream!

The host was very welcoming and answered all our questions without getting pissed off. The staff was super attentive and polite. 

Impressed and charmed, these two words perfectly define my experience at The Palms.

Everything about this place is awesome. Ambience is pretty cool, servers are extremely friendly and service is prompt. Food quantity and quality is top notch.
We went for Mango Muller, Mango Tango, Banana Strawberry Smoothie, Apple Mojito, Holiday Shirley, Coco Pineapple Delight, Kalmi Kebabs, Stir Fried Lamb With Celery & Chinese Greens, Chicken Wings, Murgh Gautie, Gosht Roganjosh, Fish Hyderabadi, Kashmiri Pulao, Prawn Dum Biryani, Gajar Ka Halwa and Date Pancake all the items were amazing and made extremely well without any flaws whatsoever. 
If I had to choose the best items of the day then it has to be the Fish Hyderabadi and Prawn Dum Biryani it was truly amazing and perfect in every sense of the word. Overall a great experience.

Wondering what to do on a boring Tuesday evening, we decided to go for dinner to somewhere in South Kolkata. Looking for top rated restaurants in Zomato, we came across The Palms, and we knew we found our place.

For starters we ordered Chicken Kalmi Kebabs and Chilli Salt Pepper Chicken Wings. I have had kalmi kebabs in a lot of places but I can vouch for this, that this place serves the best.

For main course we wanted to try something different in terms of Naan, so we ordered Peshawari Naan and Mohini Naan. Peshawari Naan was delicious and you all must try this. Along with these we ordered for Gosht Roganjosh and Murgh Gautie. Their Roganjosh is not the usual you will have from anywhere else, so do not even think of skipping this. You gotta try this. Now the best was perhaps saved for the last - Prawn Dum Biryani - words won't be able to justify the sheer brilliance with which the rice blended with the prawn, coupled with aroma and the flavour. DO NOT MISS THIS, JUST DO NOT!

For desserts we had Gajar Halwa and Date Pancake. For those who don't like things that much sweet, the latter is tailor made for you.

In short, this fine dining restaurant is perfect for spending time with your family and friends. The ambience, The service and the Location is right where you want it to be. Also, being a fine dine restaurant, the pricing is very fair. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

It was an unbelievable experience for any food enthusiast and I am delighted that we could start the Pre Poila boisakh  celebration on such a gastronomic high.
Yuum! I can still dream of what I had tonight üòâ
üîΩThe decor charms you the moment you enter the place. The decor adds eastern elegance with beautiful real stones all around and the little fountain deserves special mention!
Now coming to the food, I would definitely fall short of words while reviewing them.
üîΩTried out 6 mocktails namely - Mango Muller, Mango Tango, Banana strawberry smoothie, Apple mojito , Holiday Shirley, Coco pineapple delight. Holiday Shirley is my personal favourite. At the same time I found Coco pineapple delight to be refreshing and can opted by the diet conscious foodies ;)
üîΩStarters were the best part of my dinner üòç
Can't get enough of Kalmi kebab & stir fried lamb with celery and Chinese greens!!!! Chicken wings were delicious too.
Succulent kebabs were filled with coriander paste within and you just can't have one piece. üòã
Stir fried lambs were mind blowing. Too soft and juicy. Perfectly baked and sauteed.. Highly recommended ‚ùó
üîΩAmong the mains we had ordered Murgh gautie, Gosht Roganjosh, Fish Hyderabadi, Mohini naan ,Peshawari naan, Kashmiri Polao & Jheenga dum biryani.
I really can't be biased to any one of them. All of them seemed to be prim and proper. Neat presentation and hygienic of course.
This Indian menu promises great tasting undoubtedly!!!
You can blindly trust me on this. 
üîΩLast but not the least, their desserts are fanciful and tasty.
Gajar ka halwa was too sweet but good in taste.
I liked the date pancake more. Not just for the taste but an extra point for the presentation too üòä
Guys hurry up and reserve your table for the upcoming fiestas.
Decor is superb and so is their hospitality ‚ò∫
Location wise very convenient. 
So what are you waiting for ‚ùìRakesh Saha

The journey with Zomato has been a long one. Eating and reviewing places here became more of a hobby now. Reaching this height wouldn't have been possible without few people whom I wanted to name. Shahbaaz it wouldn't have been possible with out you dude also to Anamitraa/The Gut Filling :) and specially to Namrata Saha thank you for bearing me through the long tiring food walks almost everyday and your countless treats to me, it would have been impossible without you. Thank you :)
Well standing here at number 500 I decided to keep this place for a special place, and thats none other then The Palms.
The Palms is just a minute walk from Kalighat metro towards Southern Avenue. Beautiful Ambiance. And food is mind blowing. You can close your eye and order anything and I assure you it will be good.
I visited here with few of my friends for dinner, here are the things we had and the sorted one which you should order.
Mocktalis :
* Green Apple Mojito
* Coco Pine Apple Delight
* Mango Miller
* Fruit Punch
.
Starters :
* Shami Kabab
* Stir Fried Lamb with Celery and Chinese Greek
- You must definitely try these two. They are excellent.
.
Main Course :
* Peshwari Naan - The best naan in town. Must order.
* Fish Hydrabadi
* Murg Roganjost
* Jheenga Dum Biryani - Unique and excellent.
* Kashmiri Dry Fruit Pulao
* Murgh Musallam
.
Desserts :
* Gajar ka Halwa - Best one.
* Date Pancake
.
Service is very good. Food is undoubtedly one of the best in town. Looking at the food quality and the luxury it offers price is perfect.

Disappointed with this place. Ambience and Decor are good but the food is a let down.The Naram Dil starter was too sweet!! ( Was it a one off or does it taste this sweet everyday!!). Even the Paneer Karachi was sweet though not as much as the starter.The only saving grace of the meal was the Banarasi aaloo dum which was delicious and flavoursome. The breads ,too, were substandard. The tandoori roti was just had and I had to leave half of it. Even the lachha paratha wasn't good. The virgin Mojito was lemony and good. But when I asked for ice they made me wait inordinately long and only brought ice after being reminded twice!! The service could have been better.
They need to improve a lot .

This is a lousy place as far as service is concerned. We booked a table and landed for dinner at the specified time. First of all no one had a clue of the booking, next there was nobody to give us a table while there were many unoccupied ones. Waiters kept moving back and forth, everyone telling us to wait couple of minutes, fail to understand why coz many tables were empty. However, after 15 minutes of waiting someone ushered us to a table and then again the long wait for someone to take order. Another 20 minutes of waiting and we lost patience & left. While we were leaving we could here the guests in the next table screaming for food they had ordered 45 minutes ago. Fortunately we left & had dinner elsewhere. Go at you own risk.

Nice place and ambience.had dinner this week when it was quite empty..Waiter was helpful in guiding about the items..we had chicken kabab which had fillings in drumstick..chicken was really well made..had Nana with egg and spring onion toppings which was quite new..main course chicken dish with tomato onion gravy was quite average..
Want to try chinese dish next time.
Location wise it's almost at the start of southern avenue at Tollygunge end..Parking is limited on the main road..

Had an extraordinary gastronomical experience here yesterday. Situated overlooking the busy southern avenue street near tollygunge police station and kalighat metro station, this place is a fine dining gem. We had dehleez kebab, vegetables dulhari, mohini naan and plain, coconut cucumber mint mocktail.  The dehleez kebab offered a subtle yet vibrant taste. The 2types of meat -chicken and mutton cooked in pudina and dhaniya flavour plays with your palate. The vegetables dulhari is a canvas of delightful range of vegetables from cauliflower, beans, spring onions to mushrooms to babaycorns to planner cooked in carrot and palak flavoured curry. The mohini naan was a pleasant surprise -cooked with egg and topped with spring onions. And as for their special mocktail collection, coconut cucumber mint mocktail is a refreshing soothing drink. overall a big thumbs up to this place. With their authentic innovative menu, delicious food and welcoming service they have potential to be one of the iconic restaurants of Calcutta

Have been to this place many times. Located at the beginning end of southern avenue. I like the ambience and the decor of the restaurant. The dishes of the Chinese cuisine are quite tasty. I loved the mixed Pan-fried noodles and Prawns in hot garlic sauce. Haven't tried their Indian cuisine yet.

Just two minutes walk from Kalighat Metro station, 'The Palms' can be a must-visit destination for the foodies. I went there with my partner to enjoy a treat from 'her' side. And undoubtedly 'The Palms' did not disappoint us. The entrance of the restaurant seemed like a pavilion's entrance to me. The well decorated ambience can be a soothing experience for the guests. The attendants were very amiable and cordial to us. The interior decoration, the soothing instrumental music, the couches were enough to create a nice 'impression' in the very first appearance.
Now coming to the Food and Taste of the dishes we had there. We had Mughal Dishes in our lunch. We ordered for a Galauti Kebab, Nizami Biryani and Gosht Bhuna Kandahari.
The quality of the Kebab and the Mutton we had there, was simply heavenly. The pieces of the mutton were so nice to eat that it melted just like an ice cream in the mouth. They also provided salad and raita with the ordered items. But it can bring a little disappointment to the exclusively 'calcutta flavoured' mughal cuisine lovers. Because the taste they adds to the dishes are a bit different from the popular ones!
And the pricing is also a bit high compared to other similar restaurants. It becomes a mammoth amount after adding the VAT and Service Tax. So if the restaurant management could curtail their price a little bit, then it can surely become one of the most chartbusters for the foodies.

Didn't expect the food to be so good, to be honest. We ordered a host of dishes, including multiple kebabs and desserts. Everyone of them (except the biryani) was delicious. The ambience emanates comfort, as do the prices. Overall, this place is heartily recommended.

This restaurant is by no means light on your pocket but it serves a great ambience and pretty nice food to somewhat ameliorate your distress when you take a look at the bill( although with the amount of taxes in place nowadays, it's hard to say whether a place is truly expensive or not)
We ordered:
Drinks: Cinderella, mixed fruit punch, virgin blue lagoon( winner: Cinderella)
Kebabs: Joojeh and mahi Pahari( both outstanding and simply melt in your mouth)
Main course: Peshawar naan & murg lahori( despite the names, the restaurant doesn't‚Äã seem anti- national and neither are we for loving both the dishes)
We were too full to dare the dessert menu but i hear their gajar Ka halwa is outstanding

The Palms restro is amazing. It has good food and is one of my favourite. Every food has a Mughlai twist in it which makes it different from other restros. 
  The restro is in Southern Avenue and is not very difficult to spot. 
Talking about its ambience. It is very good with a lot of greenary inside. 
I am highly impressed with the service. 
One of the top places to go to whenever hungry!!

Lovely decor and superb location of the Resturant but I was highly disappointed when I dropped in to treat my team for yummy lunch. Being a hard core foodie I had already heard a lot of good things about the Resturant. I found the staffs a little reluctant in guiding the customers about the food specialities. I had ordered a tandoori chicken and fish kabab to be on a safe side , these items didn't disappoint our tastebuds. But the biriyani was a shock to me. Two different kind of biriyanis tasted the same with dry chicken pieces.  I had mentioned the same in the feedback form too. 
I'm sure I'm gonna have a pleasant feeling when I drop in next.  All the very best.

Feb 2017:

Recently, I was appointed the official Food Critic of Tastes of India (ToI), the biggest food carnival in Kolkata, which was held from 25 to 26 February 2017 at Nalban Food Park.

The Palms was one of the participants there.

Earlier I had enjoyed an authentic veg Chinese lunch at this restaurant, which prompted me to try their veg appetizers on display. They were Naram Dil and Thai Corn Patties

Naram Dil was made of in-house made chhena or cottage cheese, infused with green peas, green chilli, cardamom powder, sugar and salt. It had a cornflakes coated crusty exterior, but it was light and soft from inside. It tasted nice.

Thai Corn Patties comprised of - American corn, sweet corn, red curry paste, cornflakes, lemon leaves, salt and pepper. For some reason, they soaked extra oil in the process of re-frying and tasted average, else they would have tasted quite good.

Ok so here goes my review.
The palms is located in southern avenue and is very easy to find with the help of google maps. The restaurant is situated in the 1st floor and has an exclusive staircase entrance. Coming to the interiors now it has been laid out perfectly and has a touch of elegance all over it. The combination of cream , beige and brown is always classy. The sofas were very comfortable.

I went with a group of friends and ordered a variety of food and beverage.

Appetizers
Joojeh kebab which is an Iranian dish has been justified here in the best possible manner. The chicken was soft, tender and succulent. This was the best starter as per me.

Mahi pahari- This lovely fish starter was surely one dish which made to my list of mentionables. It had green veggies marination which was really good.

The MAINS

Lasuni jhinga- shrimps immersed in a creamy gravy was just the perfect dish to go along with pulao.

Murg musallam- The all time legendary mughlai dish was such a delight to savour on. The flavours were just bursting into the taste buds. It was very well complimented by the special Mohini nan they prepare.

Hyderabadi dum biryani- This dum biryani surely made its mark. We kolkatans like our biryani with potato but on this occasion the aroma and spicyness of the biryani just stole the show.

Dessert

Gajar ka halwa- I have not had a better gajar ka halwa than this place in a long time . It was just too rich. Just the kind of conclusion a diner would want.

We ordered for an array of drinks. What i really liked was the coconut cucumber mint cooler mocktail. Must try here.

The service was topnotch and prompt. The anticipation by the service personnel was commendable.

To sum it up i had an amazing time here. Inspite of this restaurant not serving alcohol i am sure its going great guns due to the delicious food they avail. Would definitely comeback soon. Highly recommended to all the gourmands. Kudos to team The Palms. keep it upüëåüëç

This place was in my wishlist from a long time. Finally got a chance to visit.

Being a fine dining restaurant, the interiors were definitely a pleasure to the eye - with light colours and sophisticated designs and a round fountain greeting you just on entering.
Ambiance and service was excellent.
Before I talk about the taste of the food, I'd really like to mention the amount of hard word they put in for the presentation of their food. The presentation of each and every dish was at it's best.

Starting with the mocktails, we tried a number of them - Cindrella, Virgin Blue Lagoon, Heaven's Calling, Pink Island, Fruit Punch, Banana Strawberry, Coconut Cucumber Mint Cooler, Coconut Water Mojito and Spicy Mint Mojito.
I loved the Fruit Punch and the Pink Island (a strawberry based milshake kind-of a drink). Virgin Blue Lagoon is always refreshing. Cindrella was the orange based drink which was good enough. I personally do not like banana or coconut water so the Banana Strawberry and Coconut Mojito and Cooler could not impress me. The Spicy Mint Mojito was real spicy so think twice before ordering this one.

For starters we ordered - Khumb Galawati Kebab, Shami Kebab, Joojeh Kebab, Mahi Pahari and Steamed Black Pepper Chicken.
Khumb Galawati Kebab was a veg one but it tasted heavenly and was the best one. Joojeh kebab's the chicken kebab which tasted really good and Mahi Pahari which is a green fish kebab and tasted lovely - the fish was just melting inside.
Shami Kebab was okay for me not being a fan of red meat.

For main course, we ordered - Hyderabadi Dum Biryani, Peshawari Naan, Mohini Naan and Keema Naan along with the sides - Murgh Lahori, Lasooni Jhinga and Murgh Musallam.
Biryani was the unusual Calcutta Biryani without the aloo.. the Hyderabadi style with fried onions.
Mohini Naan was really good along with the Peshawari Naan.
From sides, the Murgh Lahori impressed me a lot.

For desserts, I loved both the Gajar Ka Halwa and the Date Pancake.
Gajar Ka Halwa had lots of khoya in it with a perfectly balanced sweetness. Date pancake was equally impressive.

Definitely coming back again! :)

One of the better places I have ever been to, located near kalighat metro station. The Palms, as the name suggests class, so the restaurant was. Classy interiors,amazing ambience, great food. They have lots of varieties of food and drinks. The best part were the mocktails they served. Virgin Blue Lagoon and Fruit punch I loved the most. After their exotic drinks there comes the starters with some classy items such as shami kabab and the most delicious steamed black Pepper Chicken. In the main course we had Murgh Lahori, Ghost Rahra and Kolkata's best Murgh Musallam. Service is awesome, all the staffs are well behaved and all cares for your comfort and makes sure that you enjoy your food without any worries. 
At last but not the least the Desserts. My all time  favourite Gajar ka Halwa and Sizzling Brownie with Ice Cream. If you are looking for a perfect time with your family with all exotic food then this is the place for u.

This is probably the 3rd restaurant in kolkata for which I am putting a 5 out of 5. Coz I sincerely believe that to add feathers in your hat, one has to traverse an extra mile - To me this place has undoubtedly done that!!
It was my first invitation at this place organized by #Foodzpah. I reached over there around 7.45 pm and by that time all other bloggers were already in. We were given the printed customized menu for the evening which consisted of 3 veg kebabs, 4 non veg kebabs, 4 veg main course, 4 non veg main course, biriyani, dry fruit polao, 3 types of naan and last but not the least 4 types of desserts. Along with these huge menu, they kept on serving multiple mocktails. As I said earlier, I couldn't find a single flaw of this place - right from the begining - the staircase, the gatekeeper, the interior decoration, the staffs' behaviour, the serving style, the quick and smiling response, the food quality and quantity and what not - Everything exceeded all expectations for sure. I personally would recommend for the joojeh kebab, sarson ka makai saag, Gosht rahra, murgh lahori, peshwari naan and the must try one - the mohini naan. The last one was outstanding - An innovation in the naan/kulcha/bread sector.
My best wishes to Priyadarshini who is the owner of this place - Being a fine dining restaurant only and not a bar, the way you are thriving is truly commendable.

This review has been so long due! :3
Last year, on my father's birthday, we decided to try out this restaurant.
It was a Tuesday and we (8+1)were the only ones in the restaurant. The decor was nice with bright lights, a fountain and some plants. The staff members were pretty humble and cooperative.

Coming to what we ate and how we felt :

1) Amritsari Fish @Rs.410.00 (4/5) : The fish was excellently grilled with spot on seasoning! Loved it.

2) Chicken Satay @Rs.275.00 (3/5) : The chicken satays were well grilled and were juicy but the flavours were quite not right. The seasoning was not on point. The peanut sauce served with it, also failed to prove it's worth.

3) Tom Yum Noodles Soup (seafood) @Rs.165.00 (2/5) : The soup was too sour for our liking and had no such flavour other than just boiled water with pepper, salt, tom yum paste and almost negligible seafood.

4) Double Fried Chicken in Japanese Style @Rs.285.00 (4.25/5) : This was by far the best of the lot. It was recommended by the staff and we were so glad that we ordered it. It's quite sweet so if you're not very fond of sweet and savoury dishes, do not opt for this. Chicken strips were deep fried and then tossed with sticky honey sauce and topped with sesame seeds. Loved it.

5) Kakori Kebab @Rs.310.00 (3.75/5) : It was very well seasoned and juicy with robust flavours right on spot. Not like the authentic one but was quite enjoyable. The mutton mince was maybe store bought but I would have enjoyed the hand minced mutton more.

6) Laccha Paratha @Rs.76.00 (3.85/5) and Mohini Naan @Rs.80.00 (3.85/5) : We wanted some delicious indian breads to go with the kebabs and hence ordered these. The laccha parathas were nice and crisp. The texture of the mohini naan was spot on and the flavour was that of garlic, spring onions and some spices. Was pretty exciting to the taste buds.

For main course we ordered a mix of Oriental and Mughlai :

7) Hyderabadi Dum Biryani (Mutton) @Rs.320.00 (4/5) : This turned out to be better than we expected. Long independent grains of basmati rice cooked with aromatic spices and soft mutton pieces, topped with crispy fried onions. It was so, soo good.

8) Long Bean Prawn Friedrice @Rs.225.00 (4/5) : The friedrice was nowhere similar to the friedrice from regular chinese joints. The rice used was of fabulous quality. It was then tossed with eggs, prawns and spring onions with minimal spices. The aroma was excellent and so was the taste. Loved it.

9) Kung Pao chicken @Rs.285.00 (3.25/5) : This dish did not impress me much because the gravy was too overpowering and also, the cashews were not crunchy enough.

10) Oriental Noodles with Seafood @Rs.275.00 (3.35/5) : The flavours were good, the noodles were perfectly cooked and the seasoning was perfect but the amount of seafood was measly with no taste of the seafood whatsoever.

11)Chicken Thai Red Curry @Rs.400.00 (3.5/5) : When you're paying 400 bucks you must expect a decent quantity of chicken but all my expectations went down the drains. Although the curry did not taste bad, the quantity was not worth the money paid.

We were served with a dried chili mix, a sauce with pickled carrot and cucumber sticks. The dried chilli mix was fantastic!

We paid a total of Rs.4831.00 (With Stax Rs.260.77) which included the price of 4 bottles of Mineral water and 2 containers. - For 8 (Omitting the child of 6 years)

Conclusion.
‚Ä¢Food : 3.5/5.
‚Ä¢Ambience: 3.85/5
‚Ä¢Staff behaviour: 4/5
‚Ä¢Value for money : 3.25/5

I absolutely loved this place and have been here more than once. The 1st time I went there, they were serving a special fish menu which included kanchipuram prawn and it was Absolutely delicious. The aroma, the texture and the subtle light taste was mind blowing. It was served with lemon rice which was also very aromatic and fresh. Today we tried their veg nawabi polao and murgh musallam which were quiet good and the nawabi polao is a personal favourite. Galwati kebab was perfectly cooked, tender and juicy and the sweet curd chutney along with it was something worth a refill!! The ambience is elegant and the staff too friendly and responsive . The prices are affordable and one will definitely want to revisit!!  üòä

In the main course we had plain fried rice, tom yum fried rice, ¬†egg wrapped mxd rice, chilly squid and chicken in oyester sauce...tom yum is delicious..must try..i would deduct 0.5 for the plain mxd rice but as my overall experience is excellent i'm giving it 5 points...it was good but it would be better if it have more chicken & prwn pieces..It looked plain ghee rice with prwn chkn egg pieces sprinkled on it..The hatari mxd fried rice is better..But the thai rice is mind blowing...

Then lastly we had sizzling brownie with icecream and chocolate sauce..It was very good..Overall the dishes are super yummmm...
The best moment is when they bring an awesome super cute brownie piece decorated with chocolate sauce and a candle lightened and they wished me birthday..a suprise from the staffs..(later on i heard this was a plan from my friend & the staffs cooperated)
It was a complimentary...really liked the way..i didnt expect this would happen..
In short had a fabulous evening spent in "The Palms"..
Definately will recommend it 2 my friends and i will visit again...

'The Palms' is located at just Crossing of Southern Avenue & S.P. Mukherjee Road.Few years ago there was another restaurant name - 'The Funjabi Tadka',now it was closed.By the way Ambience is good.I'd visited here with my lover for lunch.We took 'Virjin Mojito' & 'Fresh Lime Soda' as beverages.Both are good.Then We ordered 'Murgh Banjara','Takrai Gai (Chicken)' as starters.Takrai Gai was delicious,it was thai preparation,marinated with spicy thai herbs & sauce,Murgh Banjara was tasty.Atlast we had tasted here 'Murgh Zarfran Biryani',it was good,but quantity is not so good.Overall good experience.Service was little late.

Couldn't wait long to review this restaurant. It's a fine dining oriental restaurant located in M. S. Sarani, Southern Ave but if you come by metro make exit from Gate No : 3 and you'll find it on few footsteps towards Tollygunge(Rabindra Sarabor) üêæ
Excellent ambience and well decorated with a tiny fountain at entrance. Couldn't understand how could one forget to give or keep the table napkin on the table being a fine dining restaurant it suppose to be a must. Almost everyone ends up dropping some food while taking food from bowl!!Whatsoever, had to ask for paper napkin üòê
As it was mid of the day I was hungry so went straight to main course and kept the menu simple yet mixed.
Murgh Peshawari! It costed ‚Çπ245 one portion which was a worse with an average test. All of the chicken pieces were soooo tiny similar to 'Bori' pieces, how could one serve you this tiny pieces of chicken by such a good price?üò°
Egg chicken fried rice! One portion was enough for two of us and it was excellent, no complaints! Tandoori roti which was served hot. Afterwards followed by a dessert Badami firni!which was ok and oh they served us 2 pieces of papad as complementary.
Service was just excellent and the staff who attended our table was helpful and courteous üòä
Foods : 3/5
Service : 4.5/5
Ambience : 4.5/5
They add Srv Tax and Vat which makes ur bill exorbitantüòü
Srv Tax : 6.00%
Vat : 14.50%  
Our bill was of ‚Çπ608!!

The ambience and decor the place was brilliant with a small fountain inside. The waiters were very courteous. The menu had a pleasant mix of Chinese, Thai and North Indian items. We had no problems in getting a table during the Christmas week. We had taken soup, chicken fried rice and the Cantonese Chicken along with fried prawns. The prawns were delicious and the fried rice was ample in quantity . Overall a very satisfying experience.

This is a good Mughali and North Indian restaurant to visit with your family. The decor is very polished and classy with a small water fountain, comfortable seats and brightly lit up interiors. The food is good but the veg starters are not upto the mark. However ignoring the starters the rest of the food is tasty and worth a try.

Ok food, nice ambiance and most important no waiting for a table on Christmas eve, had chinese in this multi cuisine restaurant. I was recommended to have the sea food soup & manchao soup. I didn't like either of them, as it had a very bad fishy smell. But the starters was amazing, service was a little delayed as we ordered for one more starter repeat. Main course was ok nothing extravagant, finally they goofed-up at the bill, they served one plate and charged for two. They themselves weren't sure how many did they served. 'Careless' but good they rectified the bill. Over all happy to dine there, but can be better.

I have seen this place being made. It's great in every aspect. From the ambience to the dishes. I tried the Virgin Mojito for the first time, and it was love at first sip. For the starters we had Takrai gai, Panfried chilly fish and Crispy prawn garlic pepper. All of them were lip smacking. The takrai gai being a revelation is still fresh in my memory. For the main course it was mix fried rice and fish in hot garlic sauce. The rice came in a good quantity. This place makes fish the best. I did try the hakka chowmein and sliced chicken in chilly oyster sauce my friend had ordered, the dishes were great. But the fish had already captivated me. I ended with gajar ka halwa and it was decent.

P.S. The sofas are super comfy and beware to not fall asleep. The service is lightening so it would any way be a quick nap.

Location-Southern Avenue,Kolkata.

This place has gain much popularity in less than a year and all this is because of the entact quality that they have maintained through out.Its name suggest that they might be serving only oriental food but alongside they also serve some delicious Indian Food.Now starting off with the ambiance and food-

Ambiance-As you enter,the nicely lit staircase will take you up to the restaurant.The lightings,fountains,alluring designs and comfortable seating just adds up to the ambiance of this place.They can accomodate almost 60-70 people at a time.Overall the place gives a sense of soothingness and relaxation.

Food-We tried quite a few dishes from this place and all were extremely good in taste.We had-

1:Fruit Punch-This drink was a sort of mixed fruit blossom which was extremely good in taste.

2:Virgin Mojito-We just love the presentation of this mojito and the aroma of the mint leaves present was just refreshing.

3:Crispy Chilly Baby Corn-This babycorn was quite good in taste.That little amount of extra sweetness with a spicy flavour just enhanced its taste.

4:Hara Bhara Kebab-This was indeed the best kebab we ever had and it tastes better when eaten with two chutneys that they serve along with this.

5:Som Tum Salad-This was a raw papaya salad which tasted excellent.The slight amount of sweetness in it just made its taste excellent.

6:Hakka Noodle Veg-This dish was quite regular in taste but the quantity served in it was immense.

7:Gajar Ka Halwa-This Indian-origin dessert was extremely good in taste.The sweetness in it was perfectly balanced and its aroma just make the treat better.

8:Iced Lychees-It was the first time i had such combianation of lychee and vanilla icecream and i must say that it was a good combination and a perfect dessert to end meal with.

Food-4.5/5/5
Ambiance-5/5
Service-5/5

Featured in Places to go for Romantic Dates, this place is a welcome refreshment from the plethora of restaurants in the area, true to its name. The place has been increasingly becoming popular among the food community for its wide variety of menu, the generous quantity it offers and the relatively affordable price range. Located right at the junction of the Rashbehari Avenue and the beginning end of Southern Avenue, the Palms occupies the first floor of the building, right above the Cafe Coffee Day.

I have visited this place on two occasions, and needless to say, it has left a pretty good impression on me. It is beautifully decorated with shimmering statues, a wide window, comfortable and plush seats and romantic lighting. The ambiance is serene and enjoyable, with a peppy or romantic tune playing in he background. 

The Palms offers both Oriental and Indian Cuisine and though I have tried the Oriental Cuisine extensively on my second visit, I have had only limited things from the Indian list.

Refreshments:
1. Virgin Mojito: This is probably one of the best they have to offer. They don't do injustice to this mocktail, and the aroma only makes it all the more refreshing.

2. Deep Sea: This is equally good, and has the taste of 'Aam Pora'.

Oriental:
Starters:
1. Takrai gai: This is a chicken preparation, a bit on the spicier side but it tasted delicious nonetheless!

2. Pan Fried Chilli Fish: The fish was soft and the sauce was done right.

3. Crispy prawn garlic pepper: It could have been better, but then I am a little strict about prawn preparations. I found it a little on the dry side.

Main Course:
1. Hakka Noodles(Veg): I have tasted better elsewhere. But what separates this place from others is the enormous quantity they offer. For people like me, who have a very less appetite, this dish can nearly serve 3-4 people, no kidding!

2. Mixed Fried Rice: Again, the quantity they provide is bound to leave you gasping for breath from the food coma. The taste is quite good, and went well with the side dishes.

3. Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce: This went well with the Rice, and the sauce was done very well. 

4. Sliced Chicken in Chilli Oyster Sauce: I was too full by this time to have it properly, and so took just a piece for tasting. From that, the chicken wasn't chewy and soft, and the preparation is good to down with the noodles or Rice.

Indian:
I didn't have a good taste of the Indian cuisine, except the Assorted Bread basket which offers Missi Roti(worst of the lot), Lachcha Paratha, Garlic Naan, Cheese Garlic Kulcha (best of the lot). We took Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala to go with the breads. 

Desserts:
1. Ice Lychee: This isn't an unique dish, but the huge lump of vanilla ice cream with the equally cold Lychees can be a great end too the meal.

2. Darsaan: They serve a huge plate filled with these fried honey-tossed flakes along with ice cream which is in stark contrast to it. They are like elsewhere - too sweet, and it depends on the sweet tooth of the person to decide if they will absolutely love it or find it pretty moderate.

3. Gajar ka Halwa: I have tasted Gajar ka Halwa elsewhere and I either find it too sweet or the ghee isn't right or it simply doesn't do justification to the dish. But here, the sweetness is totally balanced and the aroma and freshness makes this a must try at this place.

The service is quite fast, and the waiters are polite and too eager to improve on their shortcomings (so much so that they actually read the feedback forms and question you on deducting points :P ). Overall, this is a fine place for dining with friends and family, where you won't have to worry about the cuisine preferences of different places, since all are available under the same roof !

Stepped in with an Ex Colleague for lunch...experience was bad because of the following reasons :

1. Long order-to-delivery time (took almost 1 hr to serve butter nan & Veg curry)

2. My friend found a hair in the Naan (they replaced after pointing it out)

3. Again he found something wrong with the Naan ... this time it was a long thread ...

Need to improve service. I went there on the very last moment they didn't stopped me to enter.Their Indian dishes was not available then, once I placed the order they keep on staring at me so when will I finish my meal & they will close it soon. I can understand there hectic schedule but they also need to understand my situation too. I'm paying so I deserve to be served in a decent way. Would be better if they don't allow anyone in those situation.It's very annoying. Rest all are perfectly in place.

I had heard that Southern Avenue is the new den for foodies in town and my first encounter has certainly lived upto the experience.

We dined here on new year's eve and surprisingly there were still empty seats at about 9:30pm. We started off with a kebab platter, pink island and deep sea mocktails. For the main course we had murg lahori and fish Hyderabadi with tandoori roti. 1 portion of the main course was sufficient for 2 people. We made a sweet ending to the night with a sizzling brownie. The quality of the food was very good and expect the chicken being a little bland there were no complaints. The brownie could be improved a tad more- they could take a clue from the ccd downstairs. Service time was quite short so extra points for that.

The only let down was staff behaviour. The staff was acting a little..shall I say, unprepared. Also, we had made a reservation over the phone but when we reached the spot, they denied having made any such reservations. We were lucky that they place was almost empty when we arrived or it would lead to major inconvenience on a NYE.

A wonderful experience tasting their newly launched oriental fare.
The appetizers started off with Takrai Gai. Made with chicken, it had a distinct taste of lemongrass which was extremely refreshing. The Fish Cake Pepper Salt was soft and very very tasty. What came next was something I hadn‚Äôt had before. It was Sev Thikin Prawn. Fresh quite large sized prawns were wrapped in Sev and were also served in a bed of Sevs. There was a tangy sauce along with it. Personally despite liking the unusual prawn preparation, I did not like the sauce, so next time I go there I would have the prawns sans the sauce. The spicy onions pancakes were deep fried with onion and masala paste dipped in a thick batter.

The main course kick started with Panaeng Curry Chicken. With a distinct oriental flavor given to this chicken recipe with coconut milk and fish sauce; this preparation is easier on the palate and is a decidedly different take of a chicken curry.

And you thought Park Street was the hub of fine dining, casual dining, etc etc! Well southern avenue can surely can surely put up quite a challenge since it boasts of such fine restaurants and one such fine restaurant which made our experience memorable is The Palms.
A group of three, we landed on the doorstep of this restaurant during lunch ours and boy we were in for some experience. Starting from the dimly lit stairways leading to the restaurant, the warmth and courtesy and attentive behaviour of the staff, the overly comfortable sofas, the elegantly furnished interiors and the windows which overlooked the bustling Streets seemed to add to the aura of the moment.

Now the food here is literally lip-smacking, sumptuous and will leave you craving for more :

1. Murgh banjara - 6 pieces of soft, tender, succulent, pieces of chicken made our taste buds evermore ready for the rest of the dishes to follow! Do try this since one!

2. Makhani karahi - This place really knows how to make its kebabs! This one just struck the right chord in the very first bite. Greenish in colour, sumptuous and filling in characteristics, this one is a must have!

3. Double fried chicken - This is the best double fried chicken i have had till date! Not overly fried, not overly oily and it had the crunchy outer layer which most fried chicken lack! A thumbs up to this one.

4. Chicken fried rice - One portion was enough to fill 2 stomachs. Taste was impeccable.

5. Devils chicken - Want to spice things up? This would be the ideal choice! Yes it was that spicy and overly tasty! Garnished with red chilli's the chicken was tender and the gravy was heavenly. Highly spicy and recommended.

6.. Chicken biriyani(nizami) - Serves two people, contains two pieces of chicken, unlike the ones which we generally have in the arsalan's and aminia's, this biriyani tastes different and it tastes uniquely good! So you can ease on those doubts regarding the taste!

This place really won me over and i would definitely be going back. The staff were highly attentive, friendly and courteous and that's what contributes to the grandeur of any restaurant. Cheers to this place!

The upmarket southern avenue now can easily boast of a fine dining restaurant with an amazing line up of oriental dishes -from the som tum salad to massaman curry prawn and sev thikin prawn ,they serve everything with aplomb. The Palms restaurant located at a short distance from kalighat metro station is the new oriental cuisine place to watch out for ,with oriental dishes being their latest menu addition. Recently visited this restaurant with a large group of friends ,we ordered a varied set of dishes to cater to everyone's taste buds and the fresh flavours, wholesome and ingredient rich sauces and starters left our taste buds asking for more. The ambience is pleasant and unassuming. It is spacious enough to house more than 40 people in a single sitting. The serving staff are quick and attentive to your needs. A plus one there. The food tops everything on my list. The first dish we tasted was their lemony and flavoursome seafood coriander soup which is filling and perfect for the winter season. For starters we had takraichicken, fish cake pepper salt ,sev thikin prawn and spicy onion pancakes -each one of them are droolworthy especially the crunchy spicy fish cakes and sev thikin prawns.
After the amazing array of starters we embarked upon the promising main course dishes which included panaeang chicken curry,massaman curry prawn,tausi chicken (üëçüëç) ,the delectable steamed fish in lemon coriander sauce ,the mapo tofu lamb (slightly sweet and not among the best dishes lot) and the mouth watering baby corn and mushroom in hupak style . The dishes were perfectly complimented with their refreshing and tangy mocktails -pink island,strawberry ginger monitor,fruit punch and Cinderella. The main course dishes were served with an assortment of rice and noodles dishes -moon fan fried rice,stewed steamed rice, singapore rice noodles and braised noodles.
We were thoroughly satisfied by the quantity,taste and presentation of the dishes ordered. We rounded off our dinner with two simple yet unique desserts -'darsan' -. A concoction of pastry strips tossed in honey and sesame seeds served with a generous dollop of vanilla icecream. And iced lychees.
A good meal is accredited to good taste,good hospitality and ambience which 'the palms' generously doles out to its diners. Happy eating!

A fine dining restaurant located at southern avenue, few minutes away from kalighat metro station, The Palms has a very soothing ambiance.  It has the perfect vibe for family luncheons and dinners. The place is well lit, the decor is simple yet attractive and the seating arrangement is very comfortable. I visited The Palms two days ago with a few friends and the dining experience was truly great. 

We ordered,

Strawberry Ginger Mojito-  It was refreshing and the ginger added a dash of heat to the drink.

Pink Iceland-  This was also great drink.

Seafood coriander hick soup- This is a must try! he soup is moderatley tangy and very flavourful. 

fish cake pepper salt- It is more like a crepe, a bit spicy, but tastes good.

Sev Thikin Prawn- this is a Korean dish, juicy prawns are covered with spaghetti and deep fried and are topped with a thick tangy paste.

Moon Fan fried rice- rice with chicken and mushrooms, a good choice for rice lovers.
Braised noodles- the quantity was very satisfactory and the noodles were well cooked.
Masaman curry prawn- An Indonesian dish, it had a thick coconut gravy.
Tausi chicken- ¬†Chicken tossed in a spicy sauce.
Steamed fish in lemon corriander sauce- For me, this was the best dish. The fish was fresh and the dish was light and flavourful.¬†
Pork ribs with snow peas- all pork lovers must try this. The pork was tender and well spiced.
Mapo tofu lamb- Minced lamb topped with tofu. Another innovative dish.
For desserts we had chocolate darsan and iced lychees with ice cream. The latter was a new dish for me and i loved it.¬†
The service was very good and the overall experience definitely makes me want to go back again.

A perfect fine dine restaurant, with a soothing interior and good decor. Comfortable seating, spacious, and homely staff.
Located at the mouth of southern avenue from kalighat side, and is a must go for family dinners !

I went there the day before yesterday, for dinner with a friend of mine Aagnik Ghosh to try out their oriental menu.
It's elaborate, sumptuous and delectable! Loved the lemon grass flavour in almost maximum dishes. We had :-
For mocktails ; ‚ú¥pink iseland - a sharp cutting edge taste and really refreshing.
‚ú¥strawberry ginger mojito - I loved the spices drink with the freshness and tangy strawberry bits in it. The ginger gives it an edgy flavour.
‚ú¥Cinderella - this is a orange juice based drink, decent enough and a safe option if you don't wanna experiment.
For appetizers:-
‚ú¥seafood corriander thick soup- AMAZING. Lemon grass ‚úî seafood‚úî freshness guaranteed and a soothing flavour. Must try.
‚ú¥spiced onion pancakes - soft flattened balls of spiced onions and deep fried. A lovely texture to it and tastes real good.
‚ú¥takrai gai - this is a chicken starter. Slightly gravy-ish. This actually makes you realise the oriental feel of the spread.
‚ú¥fish cakes in salt and pepper - basically flattened fish singaras. Presented in a different way. Crisp outer shell and well flavoured fish filling.
‚ú¥Sev thikin Prawns - I loved this prep. Big fresh prawns, wrapped in sev and deep fried served on a bed of sev again. The tangy saucey thing on top wasn't quite favorable for me. Otherwise a star dish!!

Main course :-
‚ú¥braised noodles - soft hakka noodles. A decent dish.
‚ú¥moon fan fried rice - spring onion and spiced fried rice, goes pretty well with the sides.
‚ú¥stewed steam rice - a dish of chicken and vegetable thick stew served with a blob of steamed rice in the centre. This was a unique dish. I liked it.
‚ú¥pork ribs with snow peas - being a pork freak, it was definitely a great dish. Perfectly braised ribs in a plum sauce like gravy with snow peas adding amazing colour to it.
‚ú¥panaeng chicken curry - a thai deduction. I loved the taste. A lil offbeat but good. With tiny chicken pieces , tender .
‚ú¥massaman curry prawn - it is again a prawn curry in Thai style, served with papaya pieces. Everything except for the papaya in this dish worked wonders for me
‚ú¥ steamed fish in lemon corriander sauce - this for me is the classic for any oriental menu. And it did justice. I lived the colour, taste texture, flavour, cooked and steamed to the t.
‚ú¥ babycorn and mushroom in hupak style - a veg gravy. Served with vinegered baby onions. Subtle.
‚ú¥ Mapo tofu lamb - minced lamb gravy with pieces of tofu in it. A brilliant innovation, the slightly salted tofu and the lamb gravy balanced well enough.

For desserts :-
‚ú¥Darsaan with vanilla ice cream (honey and chocolate flavours )
‚ú¥iced lychees

That was a looong spread. But lively ambience and great food. Do visit. Cheers :)

Location : it's a 5 mins walk from kalighat metro.
The 1st thing that mesmerises you is the ambiance and the d√©cor. Truly a fine dining aura.
It's a spacious outlet and can accommodate quite a lot people at the same timing.
Since I went with a group of frnds we ordered quite a no of dishes.
1. Seafood coriander thick soup : generous amount of prawn with a hint of lemon . Goes so well .
2. Some tum salad : salad with tangy and hot flavour infused. I love spicey.
3. Starter was
a) takrai gai ( chicken) : fried chicken tossed in a slight sweet chinese sauce and gondhoraj lemon leaf.
b) fish cake pepper salt : had a crunch and well made.
c) sev thinking prawn : prawn wrapped in sev and deep fried with a thai red sauce.
d) spicey onion pan cake : simple dish but was so so gud .
I didn't knw what to leave and what to eat . I was so highly impressed with all the starter. I think next when I come back this is what i am gonna fill my tummy with . üòçüòçüòçüòç
4. Main course
a) Massaman curry prawn : curry made with coconut . Thumbs up

We visited this restaurant located on southern avenue on a Sunday at lunch time. The decor and ambience is very nice. The staff are attentive and courteous. We enjoyed our lunch a lot, which consisted of a mixed order of Thai and Indian food. Both the cuisines were well-prepared. The prices are not that high that they will burn a hole in the pocket. The portions sizes are good and can easily feed more that 1 person. All-in-all, a very nice experience.

2 minutes walk from Southern Avenue more, The Palms is quiet conveniently located.

The ambiance and decor justify the fine dining set up and this would be a perfect place for family lunches and dinners.

Went with a large group of friends and ordered:

1. ¬†Seafood Coriander Thick Soup: A perfect warm welcome on a cold Winter evening. Loved it!

2. Som Tum Salad : A healthy yet tasty option. This dish is made with raw papaya and seasoned with chilly, ¬†garlic and ¬†lemon juice.

3. ¬†Fish Cake Pepper Salt: ¬†Crispy juicy fried fish with the perfect use of spices and flavors. Loved this one too!

4. Takrai Gai (Chicken): Dried chicken leg pieces with Thai herbs and chilly paste. Tasted great! Another must order starter.

5. Panaeng Curry Chicken & Massaman Curry Prawn : If you love Thai food, order these 2 dishes for the main course. The curries are delicious.

6. Baby Corn and Mushroom in Hupak Style : A good vegetarian dish, little spicy.

The mocktails they serve are good too. Try the Fruit Punch, Strawberry Ginger Mojito (spicy) and Cinderella.

Service: Good.

Price: Reasonable. Less, compared to the other fine dining places.

Recommended!

Visited the palms last night with a group of very, very hungry friends and I guess we tried out pretty much everything on the menu.Before I start, I must say that the service is pretty amazing and the interiors are fab, I love the off white sofas even though it must be really hard to keep them clean. The fountain on the door is really cool and so is the entry which is a flight of stairs with lights. :D So, here goes my long, long review for the food.
Mocktails:

1. Pink Island - This drink was great and had a really good taste to it

2. Virgin Mojito (strawberry ginger / spicy Mojito)
 - ¬†This had a really great taste and the spice was actually refreshing rather than one of those burning ones, this is probably the first time I have enjoyed spice in my life.

Salad:

1. Some tum salad
 - This is a classic oriental dish with papaya as the hero ingredient but be aware it is a dish which heroes the chilli as well, so if you're like me and cannot handle chilli, it's better to take a skip on this dish.

Soup:

1. Seafood coriander thick soup
 - This soup was amazing! I am rendered speechless for this one, great taste, great, fresh raw materials used to make it. If you're going here, DEFINITELY try this.

Appetisers:

1. Fish cake pepper salt - This was an amazing dish, loved the flavors inside.¬†
2. Dev thikin prawn
 - Crispy, succulent and paired with a beautiful sauce. This is a must try at this place!

Main course: 

1. Panaeng curry chicken - Similar flavor notes to that of a red thai curry, lots of lemongrass and coconut curry there, chicken was soft and well made, great taste overall. 

2. massaman curry prawn
 - The prawns were really fresh and it tasted amazing, this is a must try as well. ¬†
3. Savory Pork Ribs with snow peas 
- The pork ribs were just amazing, I'm not a fan of peas so I left them on the side, but the pork was tender and the sauce went really well with it! Great dish overall
4. Moon fan fried rice - The name is interesting and so is the dish, it was very tasty and went will with the chicken and prawns. ¬†
5. Singapore rice noodles - A classic dish, made exactly how its intended to be made, great taste.

6. Braised noodles - 
These noodles were definitely heavier than the singapore rice noodles and made for great taste overall, it tasted good and was perfectly seasoned for flavor.¬†

Desserts :

1. Darsaan (honey/chocolate)
 - This is an all time classic chinese dessert that goes really well with vanilla ice cream, if you don't finish off your meal with some darsaan, you're honestly missing out on something.

Overall, the staff was very courteous and even though we were creating a ruckus did not stop us or act rude with us. Great day and great place to eat at.

The only good thing about the Murgh Musallam that I ordered in from here was the speedy delivery. Apart from that, it was a rather pathetic experience. With gallons of oil floating on the gravy, my expectations went downhill even before I tasted the food. There were 3-4 not so great pieces of chicken, with bits and pieces of mutton keema. The chicken was hard and undercooked, the gravy too oily and spicy, the taste not so great and the price, a bit too much to shell out. Not worth a try.

The restaurant was on my wishlist for a long time.Just 2 mins walk from kalighat metro,its a fine dining restaurant, located above southern avenue ccd Ambience was extremely cozy,the staffs were courteous,food was mindblowing..in other words the experience was quite cherishable.
Now coming to food,
For starters we ordered-
1.Chicken Takdai-Its a thai dish and I can still feel its taste in my mouth.It outlived my expectations.Chicken was well marinated,soft,juicy and tossed with garlic,onions,lemon leaves spices.The dish is worth a try.
2.Mahi pahari-The dish was on my wishlist after I have gone through the reviews but it was quite a disappointment.Very light hardly feel the spices,though the quality of fish was very good.So 2 thumbs down for the dish.

Main course:
1.Cheese Garlic bread-It was light not that cheesy and heavy,so all the fitness freaks can give it a try without fear.
2.Khumb nawabi-Its a stuffed mushroom dish worth a try.But for diabetic patients its a big no.
3.Kashmiri pulao-Yum yum üòçüòç (enough to explain the dish)
4.Lasuni jhinga prawn-Its a spicy prawn curry,perfect combination with kashmiri pulao.

Food-3.5/5
Service-4/5
Ambiance-3.5/5
All the foody go explore it..üòÉ

We had booked The Palms for my niece's rice ceremony and I must say we had a great experience. The food was appreciated by everyone and the service was great! Right from helping us in choosing the menu to ensuring awesome food along with great service, The Palms had it all. We had chosen pan fried chilli fish for starters which was a clear winner. The main course was north Indian and the Fish Amritsari and Chicken Hara Peyaaz was also mouth watering.¬†
Thanks to the team we had a lovely evening and the guests were all very happy with the food service and ambience

The Restaurant is just opposite to my building and i came to know about it some months ago. It was during the Durga Puja time, me and my family decided to dine there. We ordered north indian food and it was very good. The restaurant looks very elegant with beautiful interior decorations. There is a Royalish look. The seats cum sofa's are extremely soft and comfortable. Entire area is covered with warm yellow light making it more elagant. Ambience? Obviously i don't need to say much about it. It's lovely... Staff's are friendly and their management is good.
On my second visit with a group of friends..we decided to try their oriental food.

The biggest turn on would be their service. Restaurant managements in Kolkata should learn from The Palms' hospitality.
Place is a good dine-out spot to go with family & friends. With better than average interiors, music and vibe, they offer quality food and has a lot of variety on the menu which are crazily pocket friendly, although they take time to bring food to the table.
This place should be visited by everyone. I'm definitely visiting the next time I'm downtown.

I exactly dnt remember wat v ordered but d menu was special for Durga Puja which had very limited items on it.. still v ordered Chinese n one starter.. food was good.. but service n servicemen were pathetic.. one of dem was damn rude..

Had organized a birthday dinner here last week.  Had called and spoke with the manager. The starters were in Indian. .we tried Murg Banjara , Mahi Kasundi and Koobideh. The kebab were soft and succulent .The winner was Koobideh. Sheekh kebab like mutton kebab spiked with gondhoraj lemon. We also ordered chicken lemon coriander soup which was great.  Main course we had Asian. Chicken fried rice , chicken chilli garlic noodles , fish in chilli plum sauce , kungpao chicken,  butter garlic prawn. The winner with flying colours was the fish in chilli plum sauce. It was truly delicious. Big pieces of tender white bhetki lightly tossed in sweet n chilli flavour. We were offered complimentary desserts gajar ka halwa,  ice cream , gulab jamun.  Service was attentive. Mr.Shahrukh Mohammed took extreme care for a seamless dinner attended by my guests . The decor is extremely soothing in white with a water fountain and a picturesque view. Foodie friends the place is worth.

My Rating of 3.5 as some food items were very good, some not so... 
Sunday evening, sudden planning for dinner, hungry friends... So we chose a destination not very far from our place. This restaurant is situated above CCD, southern avenue (Road opp Tollygunj P.S.) 

A long straight staircase, a cute fountain, well lit white ambiance and comfortable seating sums up the place. Now straight to food, following were the items ordered:
Veg Manchow Soup - very good to taste with perfectly crispy chows! Strong aroma made a good kick-start of dinner! 
Makai Rangeen Kabab - spicy kababs with corn cobs & colourful capsicums, served with green chutney, different & very good to taste. 
Paneer Karachi - Paneer in yellow gravy, spicy, good to taste. 
Vegetable Kolhapuri - Basically a mix veg, with not much gravy, average to taste
Hamara Khas Dal - a mix of lentils, yellow fry. This one is their speciality, tasted good. 
Dal Makhani - Have had much better ones, but was decent enough. 
Pudina Paratha - Dry mint bread... Average, nothing new
Cheese Garlic Kulcha - a must order bread as the preparation was fab with good stuffing & gooey cheese! 
Jeera Rice - good quantity but average taste. 
Four Treasure Vegetables in Your Choice of Sauce - We opted for chilly wine sauce as suggested by the staff, below average in taste. Was to be paired with Ginger capsicum rice. 
Ginger Capsicum Rice - This tasted awesome with distinct ginger aroma. 

Pricing - The cost of Vegetarian food for 9 adults without beverages or desserts was around Rs. 3,800/-. Given the food, ambiance & service, in my opinion the cost is on a higher side. Probably the reason why it was half empty on a Sunday evening.

P.S. - Dont mix the cuisines, stick to a single one to enjoy more!

Had a nice experience in this place. Food quality is very good but a bit costly place. We were two people but it cost us around INR 1800 however we entered to this place seeing cost for two 850. :-P
However the environment and ambiance is quite good. We ordered joojeh and a thai prawn in starter. Joojeh as they said would be zafran based kebab but it had no jafran flavour in it. However the prawn was really awesome. In mains we ordered Kashmiri pulao and kandari mutton. Kashmiri pulao was good and mutton was also good but was a bit hard. In desert we took chocolate darsaan served with one scoop of ice cream which tasted really great.
Overall had a great experience and service was also very good.

We loved the food here. Starting from the Kebabs to the main dish. We came to learn about this place thru zomato users. The restro is very easy to locate, ie just off the Kali ghat Metro. The ambience is very chic. The best part abt this restro is their food. We had Kebabs both chicken and veg and they were equally good. We had mohini naan and it was delicious. Virgin mohito was also superb. A very good experience. A highly recommended place to my friends.

Went there on Diwali after watching adhm..this restro was on my hitlist for quite sometime.as we entered the restro was empty and no one came for dine even as we were leaving which was quite shocking for me..starting from ambience, food quality, service everything was extremely classy. It seemed as if we were being given some royal service. Now coming to the food sorry for being so late in coming to the point, the ambience is truely worth mentioning. The names of the dishes on the menu card grew more excitement among everyone. So we started with royal harabhara kabab and Peshawar paneer kebab which were served with two delicious chutneys..both the kebabs were superb..we did not had to wait long for the starters and the main course as I said the place was empty. We had tandoori roti, Jaipuri malai kofta and ghosht rarha..Jaipuri malai kofta is worth recommending. The koftas absolutely sweeped us off our feet. They just melt in our mouth.. So please try this dish on your first visit. The mutton gravy was also very nice. I think there were no loopholes in our experience so The Palms deserves the entire marking. It was a priviledge for us to visit this beautiful place.. And wish to visit again.‚ù§‚ù§

My very recent visit to this restaurant left me fully satisfied. The decoration is so beautiful and the ambience gives u a fine and peaceful feeling. we had ordered for a veg paneer starter dont really remember the name , mahi ajwaini fish kabab and murgh banjara for startetrs. All the items were absolutely mouth wateing and delicious. Except for the pudina they serve another sauce with yoghurt which is really tasty and different.¬†
We kept the mains simple with butter naan, mutton roganjosh and a polao.
A multicuisine restaurant serving such beautiful indian food has made a foodie like me very happy. will surely visit for your oriental pretty soon. :)

There are few restaurants in Calcutta, which serve both Indian and Oriental cuisine, and are good at both. Either they are a Chinese joint also serving Indian, or vice versa. The Palms is one of those few where we tried and liked both. We love mixing dishes from several cuisines at times, specially when visiting new restaurants, to find out their strengths. That is exactly what happened at The Palms.
                                                                ...

I had been here on asthami with few of my friends. The place is nicely decorated and is located in such a location that can be traced very easily.
Coming to the foods for one of my friends who was having veg due to rutuals we ordered few veg starters along with non veg ones..the veg starters were harabhara kabab n reshmi paneer kabab, the first one was not at all tasty and the 2nd one was okay kind off,not reccomendable. The non veg starters were good. Even one of the non veg chicken side dish was really tasty.The service was really bad if we were inside the restaurant for more than 2hrs just bcz of service they were like they dont have hat strength to take orders n serve it fast. Any way hope the services will b better in near future and the food quality will be more delicious.

Located on southern avenue just beside N.G Medicare and on top of CCD,I visited this place during the puja's.I belive puja's are not the best time to judge a restaurant as because of the rush most things are not in place.But even keeping that in¬† mind some of the things I noticed could have been avoided for example the table cloth was all stained and when I asked for a glass for my canned soft drink I was told they donot have enough glasses because of the puja rush, although the restaurant at that point of item was not full. Coming to the food, it was better than what I expected after¬†the initial setback.¬†So overall a just about decent place to have¬†a family dinner

Won't say a must-go place but definitely a can-try place.The staff is just amazing! Their behavior and the meticulous detail to every customer would always be a cherishing memory.
Location- Southern avenue, at the end of the road that opens right opposite of the Tollygunge Police Station.
Ambience- Nicely done interiors,shining brightly. Try to get the seats beside the windows,you can grab a nice roadside view.
Food- Chicken sweet corn soup,Double fried chicken Japanese style,Chicken fried rice with basil,Fish fillet in Chilly Oyster sauce, Padh Thai Chicken,Fresh lime salt,Vanilla scoop with chocolate sauce
Taste-The soup was absolutely refreshing. And exactly the way it should be.
4 pieces of double fried chicken Japanese style are served in 1 plate.It was too filling for 2 of us.The sweet n' chilly dip that comes along balances the flavor.Didn't find it delicious but the dish being a little innovative is definitely worth a try.
Padh Thai was just ok,not as per my expectation. It was stinking of the eggs.Strangely the upper portion was warm whereas the portion below was cold. The overall dish should have been piping hot.
The chicken fried rice with basil actually had a beautiful flavor of the basil leaves.
Though we had ordered fish fillet as sides we were by mistake served with chicken side dish.On pointing it out the staff apologized couple of times and were absolutely polite in replacing the dish with our original order.In fact the staff went a step further,added extra rice with the leftover fried rice and parcelled it along with the fish fillet.It was an overwhelming gesture.Thank you team Palms for your hospitality!!
USP of the place- The behavior of the staff. It surely going to compel you to make a comeback!!

Being Jack of all trades is fine. But this restaurant is far from its claim of being Master of Two. IT IS MASTER OF NONE.
Very bad orinental cuisine  complimented with Slow and sleepy staff. 
This place below mediocre.

We have been visited this place a month ago and the restaurant looks very beautiful, a very well decorated restaurant and while entering the ambience of the staffs were overwhelming...now coming to food we had double fried chicken Japanese style, fresh lime soda, oriental fried rice, fish in oyster sauce, oriental noodle and ice cream... All the dishes were delicious, everything was perfect except the quantity. Quantity of the food specially rice and oyster fish should have been a little bit more as l felt the difference in quantity compared to the other joint, otherwise everything was good

Experience was great...
Service is fast.... 

Food... 5 stars to the food...

I went with two of my friends.... i chose the restaurant and my friends couldn't stop saying me how great this plan was... Thanks to Zomato i could confidently take them here even though it was my first time too, just because of the reviews...

We ordered the jujeh kebab its a chicken kebab iranian style and it was too good...

We shifted the cuisine for the next starter to oriental and ordered the double fried prawns in devil sauce and it was my favorite of all the dishes... One note for this dish - This one is very hot so those who are not int chilli and the heat of it don't order it otherwise if you think you can handle it definitely give it a try its awesome....

then for the main course we tried keema naan and gosht nihari which were a perfect blend with each other and cooked beautifully... tender mutton and very flavourful....

Lastly we had the gajar ka halwa and it was sweet paradise :D 

Do give this place a try and everyone's surely gonna love it....

The Palms.. Located in Southern avenue, it is 4-5 mins walk from Kalighat metro, opposite to the Tollygunj Police Station. The ground floor is the southern avenue CCD outlet and first floor is this restaurant.¬†
While we enter this place from the staircase that leads to this elegant yet strikingly beautiful place where a small fountain near the doorway attracts the attention and adds to the beauty. The brightly lit dining area with white comfortable couches makes u sink in with its softness and brown cushioned chairs. The interiors have been made thoughtful with delicate decor. This place gives a classy, bright and uplifting feeling, very much spacious. The experience had been quite soothing as soon as u get there.. you'll have a very positive vibe. The staffs were courteous and helpful.
This is a multi cuisine restaurant, so the variety of menu is there. But we had chinese and north indian. We started off with 4 Starters comprising Joojeh kebab, Mahi pahari, Takrai Gai and Crispy Prawn Garlic Pepper.. all of them stole the show.. the starters were cooked perfectly with the right blend of spices and seasonings.. the pieces od chicken fish and prawns were of good quality, their starters deserve a lot of praise.
then we had Chinese that comprised of ginger capsicum flavored fried rice, chicken in devil sauce and sliced fish in bell pepper oyestr sauce.. these items were amazing and the flavor of each of them were oozing out perfectly.. it had the best of authentic taste.
Then we tried north indian comprising of Murgh zafran biryani, murgh kalimirch, murgh lahori, ghost rogan josh and fish hyderabad.. here too these items were served in ¬†good quantity plus quality were amazing.. the presentaion was ravishing.. the biryani was so delicious with flavors of saffron and other blend of spices a complimentary raita was served with the biryani .. it was something new i tried.
Further i tried 2 types of bread.. keema naan that was suffiently stuffed with keema and it was soft and tasty.. tasted amazing with the side dishes, then came one such naan which was purely amazing with a new concept i.e., peshawari naan stuffed with khoya alomonds coconut.. the sweet taste of this naan went beautifully with the mutton gravy.

then came the deserts we tried gajar ka halwa which was again made to the best of flavours oozing out.. blend of ghee with sweetness of carrot was cooked perfevtly and i had an amazing experience having it.
again another desert came up with a new concept thats chocolate darsshan served one scoop of chocolate ice cream wit hcrispy ¬†flat noodles coated with chocolates.. tasted different .. i loved the concept of ice cream with the noodles.
The staffs were perfect in their etiquettes. They had served a meal ¬†the taste of which lingers on for long and on and an experience that last forever. With the Palms, hospitality serves up the perfect dining experience!!

The Palms is a fine dining restaurant situated above the CCD outlet in Southern Avenue. Had gone there with a group of 8-9 people for dinner the other day. Right from the staircase leading u to the restaurant,to the small fountain near the doorway,to the brightly lit dining area with white sofas and brown cushioned chairs,to the full length mirror on the back of the door, this place has words like 'Classy', 'Chic', 'Posh' written all over it. The ambience is suitable for dates as well as family outings. 
We had a couple of mocktails featuring Deep Sea,Cinderella,Pink Island,Virgin Blue Lagoon,Virgin Mojito,Fruit Punch,etc. Although every mocktail was good presentation  wise,but it fell flat flavour wise. The only one which stood out in its taste was the Virgin Mojito,it was simply bang on! 
Now coming to the food. We had an array of dishes consisting of both Indian and Chinese dishes. We started with Mahi Pahari which was fish kebab in green paste or chutney,and Joojeh kebab which was of chicken. Both the kebabs were soft,grilled to a very satisfactory amount and tasted quite nicely by themselves. The dips they served deserve a mention,especially the reddish mayo dip which was delicious. The Chinese starters were Taken Gai(chicken) and crispy prawn garlic pepper. I loved the chicken starter which was flavoured with authentic oriental flavours and had a hint of lemongrass along with onions and red chilli flakes which appealed to my taste buds. I couldn't taste the prawn due to allergies but it was a favourite amongst everyone on the table.
The main course consisted of Murgh Zafran Biryani and ginger capsicum flavoured fried rice. The biryani was light and had a Zafran flavour throughout which made it stand out from biryanis available elsewhere. The fried rice was normal,it didn't have any new or different flavours. The side dishes included Murgh Kalimirch- spicy red chicken gravy with a smearing of black pepper on top. This was a very tasty dish and went great with the Keema Naan,which had ample mutton Keema stuffing in it üòÉ. Then there was Murgh Lahori and Fish Hyderabadi. Both of these dishes were made in green gravy with white cream. They tased kind of similar to me. The star of the Indian dishes was the Gosht Rogan Josh. Soft,tender mutton,which was falling off the bone,cooked in thick red,rich,spicy gravyüòç. It was on of the best preparation of Rogan Josh I had had in any restaurant. Along with the Keema naan,we had a naan of a very different kind altogether. It was called Peshawari Naan. It was a little sweet in taste and had fillings of khoya,almond,cashews. I became an instant fan of this naan and couldn't have had enough of it. It went exceptionally well with the rich gravy of the Rogan Josh. The Peshawari Naan is a speciality of the Palms and worth recommending. The Chinese side dishes were chicken in devil sauce and sliced fish in bell pepper oyster sauce. They were both tasty. The fish in other sauce was very soft and the sauce was quite flavourful. Our stomachs were quite content with the main courseüòÉ.
Then finally came the turn of my favourite course,Desserts!! We had gajar ka halwa and chocolate darsan. The halwa was flavoured with ghee and topped with almonds. The halwa was very very well made and am glad to say that it wasn't too sweet. I finished 3/4th of the bowl all by myself and was very proud abt it üòù. The chocolate darsan was a new kind of dessert fr me. Crispy fried darsan chips thoroughly coated with chocolate sauce along with a scoop of chocolate ice cream on top. The hot darsan along with the cold ice cream proved to be a winning combination. Simply loved the desserts.
To sum it up,my dinner experience at The Palms was thoroughly enjoyable and I left with a smile on my face. The staff was extremely courteous and knowledgeable about the menu. Looking forward to coming back here üòÉ

My recent visit here started and ended on a happy note. Located above the CCD outlet,it happens to be a very spacious restaurant with perfect decor for dinner dates. The stairways are dimly lit with nice looking lamps. 
Then the main hall is very brightly lit. The walls have different textures, some like that of waffles and some like rustic sodden trunks. The staff are really handy and well behaved. They won't give you a chance to complain. 
We tried out several items. The mocktails were bang on! Ranging from deep sea to pink island and orange blossom to virgin mojito,everything was great to sip on. 
Then comes the food. 
Beginning with the starters, from the mahi pahari to the crispy prawn garlic pepper and Takrai Gai everything was perfect. The prawn was the highlight of the entire list. 
The main course consisted of both continental and Indian ranging from Murgh Zafran Biryani to Ginger capsicum flavoured fried rice. The biryani was different from the regular biryani that any shop offers,it had a flavour of zafran which differentiated it from the regular biryani. The ginger rice was okay,can be better. 
The side dish had a wide range of variety. Mutton to fish. Murgh kalimirch was a spicy stopper good for the ones who like spicy food. Murgh lahori happens to be a chicken item green gravy and a drizzle of white cream makes it perfect along with the soft chicken pieces. It's really mild in spice and tasted good with the biryani. Then there was fish Hyderabadi looks similar to murgh lahori but it different. Didn't concentrate on it much though. Then comes the most awaited Gosht Rogan Josh, tender mutton pieces bathing in rich reddish brown sauce. It's really rich in taste and attractive in colour. 
The breads included Keema naan and Peshawari naan. Keema nan has good quality and quantity of minced mutton curried in spices. The best of the lot was the latter that is the Peshawari naan; it was something different that I experienced. The filling was totally contrary to any other naans, consisting of khoya coconut almonds raisins and cashews. It's really richly sweet in taste and tastes best with spicy items as that of Rogan Josh. The combination of sweet with spicy just equalises and produces a really nice blend of flavours. The sweet naan stole the limelight. 
The deserts. There's always a little space for deserts you know. Gajar halwa was flavoured with ghee. It was sweet and the bits of carrot were recognisable. Decoration and presentation was really nice,impressive. The chocolate darsan was something completely new for me. It's a plate of darsan which is crispy fried sweet tasting chips. It was drizzled with generous amount of chocolate sauce and and a large dollop of chocolate ice cream. The chips are to be munched along with the ice cream. 

Extra points for ambiance and presentation. Well done. Thank you.

The Palms- The name speaks for itself, boasting over its varied menu along with the perfect ambience one can ever get.
Located opposite to Tollygunge Police station just beside the CCD outlet in Southern Avenue.

Went there yesterday with a group of 8 people. Fleet of stairs lead you to this amazing restaurant with a little fountain greeting you.
We have been treated extremely well by every person right from the moment we entered.

Helped with the starters and mocktails in the beginning, comprised of:
Mahi Pahari- this was a fish kabab coated with green chutney. Tasted good.

Joojeh kabab- I absolutely loved this preparation. Chicken tandoori kababs made perfect with the chicken soft and tender.

Chicken Takrai- spicy, crispy chicken keeping it moist in the inside and total crisp covering with the aroma of gondhoraaj.

Crispy Prawn Garlic Pepper- one of my favourites. Big pieces of prawn making the taste buds extremely happy.

Also, mocktails: Deep Sea, Cinderella, Heaven's Calling, Blue Lagoon, Virgin Mojito, Fruit punch, Orange blossom, Pineapple Blossom.
Special mention of the Pink Island which was a strawberry based drink with a chunk of ice cream in it.

For Main course, we had:

Ginger capsicum flavoured fried rice- this was good for a meal with good amount of capsicum added.

Chicken in Devil Sauce- a little bit of tangy flavour with veggies. However, this was a little too spicy.

Sliced Fish in oyster sauce- the fish pieces were soft and fresh. Served hot and tasted even more amazing.

Murgh zafran biryani- unusual kolkata biryani with kesar, onion and four decent piece of chicken but has no potato along with it, incase you'd be looking for one. And raita complimentary to this.

Murgh Kalimirch- the better version of chicken masala contains the helping of pepper making it taste better.

Murgh lahori- green gravy of shredded chicken topped with cream. Went well as a side.

Fish Hyderabadi- unfortunately I didn't like this much. The fish though cooked well had a typical south-food tinge and the taste too strong.

Keema Naan- butter naan stuffed with keema which went amazingly well with the indian sides. Tasted amazing.

Peshawari Naan- now, this was a surprise. This is one of the signature dishes of The Palms. Naan stuffed with khoya, almonds and coconut tastes very sweet and gives a good company to the spicy dishes.

As for Desserts, we had:
Chocolate Darsan- golden, crisp. Added with chocolate sauce. Served with chocolate ice cream on top. Decent ending.

Gajar ka halwa- even though I'm not a big fan of gajar ka halwa, I loved it here. Carrot totally mashed to paste with proper sweetness, topped with almonds.

The service was equally upto the mark. Every person who helped us, who were so courteous to us at every point. Left the place on a serious happy note.

The Palms, tried their Chinese menu as well as the Indian menu. To start off, the beverages were just off the charts! All the beverages were just 10 out of 10, but the Fruit Punch, the Pink Island were the highlights. The best one was the Orange Blossom.
Now comes the starters, the Mahi Pahari was well and truly the best, it was well cooked and was just mind blowing. Then comes the Joojeh Kabab, slight elaichi tinge to it, tastes good and is pretty well cooked. After that we have the Takrai Gai (Chicken Takrai), this was also pretty good, the hard outer crust was the main thing with the soft chicken core. The final one was the Crispy Prawn Garlic Pepper, this was the one that stole the show. Never had that quality of prawn anywhere else.
Now coming to the main course, the Murg Kalimirch was properly cooked, and that kalimirch flavour was the cherry on the cake.
Then the Murgh Lahori, this was also a pretty good dish, didn't have any complain with it, properly cooked and tasted pretty good.
Then we had the Fish Hyderabadi, this place really serves one of the best fish dishes in the whole city! Just awesome overall, the cooking part as well as the taste goes. The fish used was fresh, soft as it should be and the aroma all together made it a masterpiece.
Then came the Chicken in Devil Sauce, this was pretty devilish, very spicy, but that's what makes the dish special.
Final one, Sliced fish in bell pepper and oyester sauce, this stole the show in the main course area. As I said before, the fish preparations are just perfect, and so is this dish.

Then comes the Rice part. Murgh Zafran Biryani was another show stopper. Pretty good.
The final one that wraps up the Rice part, Ginger Capsicum flavoured fried rice. Wasn't impressed that much with this one, can do a bit better with this one.

Finally came the Naans. The Keema Naan was definitely good, but the Peshwari Naan was mind blowing, that sweetness of the coconut made it more special. Would definitely recommend this over anything else.

Now the final touch, the dessert. Gajar Halwa accompanied by Chocolate Darsan, well nothing's better than a good dessert at the end, and these definitely were one of the highlights in the whole show.

The ambiance of the place is nice, the place is very clean, the sitting arrangements are also very good. The cushions they provide are very comfortable to sit on. The restaurant is spacious and seriously well decorated. The location of the place is also very good. The service is also very good. No doubt that I love this place. Would recommend this to anyone who wants some quality food!

Visit during the pujas guaranteed that wait for this outlet also. We waited for nearly 45 mins to get the seat. The arrangement seemed to be strange. As they proclaimed that one side of the restroom would be closed at 5 for 1.5hrs. I mean who does that during Puja time when there is a rush guaranteed? Anyway the interior decoration is quite well although they should add more couple seats. The rating is for the food quality and ambiance only. The service sucks. You need to ask twice before you get anything. And the rush at that time wasn't that much that would justify their lags in service. Anyway the place is overall quite good and is worth more visits.

Pro:
1. Food is good.
2. Hospitality is good.
3. Ambient is good.
 Con:
1. 1 liter bislary water costs Rs. 90(excluding 14.5% vat and 5% service will make it near about Rs.118) which is Rs. 20 outside. This is quite ridiculous. Even Rs. 30 cold drinks can will be charged 130 with tax.

So the DURGA PUJA menu does not include most of the items from the original menu (90%) 
And guess what? They forgot to upload the so called special menu!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
The waiters were clueless about that and when we entered with HIGH HOPES by seeing the rating, we were so much dissapointed as there was no one to get us seated!! üòÇüòÇ
Seriously? Do they forgot all the courtesy during PUJAS? 
Hahahaha!! 
We left the restaurant when we saw the waiters were confused and least interested in serving good and they were not even sorry about the unavailable dishes which we chose from the PUJA SPECIAL MENU. 

No matter what , I am never visiting this again.

The Palms has replaced my favourite and very close to heart restaurant Funjabi Tadka. Located in southern avenue just a few buildings off the Nava Nalanda school main building and above CCD. Although it is unjust to rate any restaurant based on festive season experience, but I should say that this place is an average one. Taste of the food is average as compared to the prices which are on the higher side. 
We had ordered butter nun, kulcha and tandoori roti along with mutton korma. The bread items were fresh and soft, mutton pieces were tender as well. But the standard of taste which their predecessor Funjabi Tadka had set overpowers all the plus points. 
There is ample scope for improvement in terms of customer service and food quality.

We were looking for a nice place for my mother's birthday dinner on Dashami. Basis zomato ratings we went to The Palms on southern avenue, very close to Rashbehari metro. They serve both Asian and North Indian cuisine, however, we were in the mood for Chinese. Due to Pujo they had shortened their menu, however, on our request they agreed to serve us soup which was not a part of their menu. So, we had hot and sour soup and mahi pahadi kebab for starters. For main course we had asian chicken noodles and schezwan fish. The food was very good, only the kebabs could have been juicier. The restaurant has nice decor with a fountain bubbling inside. Service was efficient and quick. Happy that the food quality was not compromised with despite pujo rush.

We visited this place during Durga puja and we were much excited to visit this joint

The interior of this place gives a classy felling its very much spacious restaurent nd it comes with a chilled ac as well

We ordered Chilli Pepper Chicken,Spicy Fried Rice,Oriental Fried Rice,Chicken hakka Noodles,Chicken with Hot Garlic Sauce,Sheswan Chicken

Chilli pepper Chicken was just fabulaous it was juicy inside nd a little bit crispy from the outside just the way i like it
Spicy Fried Rice tasted good but it could hav been better it comes with a red colour but spicyness was missing ingredients of fried rice was not coming to the mouth as well
Oriental chicken fried rice tasted ok ok kind of it tasted a bit flat its ingredits was also missing
Chicken haka chowmin tasted fantastic it was perfect mix of all the ingredients it smells really great as well
Chicken in hot garlic sauce was nice taste of spices nd garlic was coming to the mouth as well
Seshwan Chicken was a total disaster it tasted awful not recommended strongly please improve the dish if u want gain customers trust

A mixed felling comes in my mind i think Durga pujas pressure made there food flat like to taste there food in normal working days Cheers!!!!!!

Hopped in there during pujas. Their special menu was in the house (just like every restaurant in the city during the festival) but this menu was very intelligently chalked out. I'm mentioning this because some of the other big names have really disappointed me with theirs. Their kebabs are just brilliant. The galawati kebab had really impressed me on my previous visit( it wasnt there in the special menu this time). The boti was excellent..as was the kung pao chicken. The keema naan was awesome, the best I've had in a while. The murg gautie was pretty impressive too. The spicy fried rice was terrific as well. Ambience was excellent. Bottomline : excellent food at a reasonable price. I will b back again.

I have been to The Palms restaurant a handful of times and have never been disappointed. But Pujas are whole another story, when most places are almost juggling with fire, utensils and temper in the kitchen and only manage to put forward edible food. So we stepped into the Palms on Ashtami afternoon with expectations of decent but not brilliant food.

To our extreme surprise, the food was even better than usual days. We settled for their Indian fare, and our order included- murgh banjara kebab, mahi pahari kebab and tandoori jhinga. For the mains we moved on to maharaja kofta and some freshly tandoored keema naan. We also ordered a plate of Hyderabadi Biryani and Mutton Roganjosh. I have been saying this for a while and repeat it yet again, the Roganjosh here is one of the best in the city.
While the kebabs were impressive, the main course absolutely sweeped us off our feet.
Though the restaurant was full when we stepped in, we were soon guided to our tables and catered to swift service. The mains took a tad bit more time than the kebabs to appear, but we weren't complaining. Our tired feet got their deserved rest. Looking forward to dropping back in for Dashami dinner today.

I was out om a sunday in the southern avenue region, saw the very good rating on zomato so decided to eat dinner here. Very very dissatisfied and disappointed. Ordered two things - Mixed oriental Noodles & Soy Chilli Chicken. Noodles had only eggs and prawns, chicken was no where to be found. The chicken was more like black bean sauce rathe than chili chicken. Service was poor, waiter disinterested and lack of cleaning. Tables where littered with salt, pepper & soy sauce, asked to clean but no one bothered. After this there was the bill that doesn't justify the food and service. Toilet was leaky, dirty, stinky. The toilet seat was broker and laid on the floor. There was food on the toilet floor, floating in the water the toilet paper was all over the place. Overall not the place to try. Even the furniture is crude!

This restaurant had been on my wishlist for a long time because of its high rating on zomato.Finally,we dropped in for our asthami lunch.The place looks beautiful and elegant with white couches and has a very soothing ambiance.There were 6 of us and we had ordered 6 makhani rotis,mutton boti kebab,mahi ajwaini,2 plates of murgh peshawari and 6 cokes.The fish was a little tough to cut and did not taste that good.The boti was delicious.The rotis did not look or smell like the ones we regularly eat.It was a little on the darker side but tasted okay.Now,the side dish...I have never seen such small pieces of chicken in my entire life.If you are taking 265 bucks for 6pcs of chicken,then I expect the dish to be fantabulous.The least I can expect is the size of the pieces to be decent enough.The dish looked like chicken bharta.And they don't even offer finger bowls.How exactly am I supposed to eat my roti and gravy then?They put down tissues on the table after we had asked for finger bowls(check out the pictures of the tables if you do not believe me).What kind of a service is that?Highly disappointed.Overpriced like anything.The bill came around 2778 bucks and we weren't even full.If you are charging so much for such poor portions,then at least level up the quality.

This place was long in my bucket list..finally stepped into this place on ashtami evening..the ambience left me awestruck..the roadside view..the fountain..the lights..positive vibes were oozing out from every corner of the place...
The staff was well mannered and service was super fast..
We ordered..Murgh Banjara..ah well..the chicken kebab was well cooked tender bathed in a spicy and herby paste..served with only salad..no pudina chatni disappointed me..but the taste was pretty good..
Nizami biriyani..o well well..biriyani with indigenous spices and coriander leaves..super light..flavours were overflowing the plate..i loved it simply..
The Gosht Nihari we ordered was super tasty..the flavour of the dish made me elated...the mutton was juicy...tender..extremely good stuff..
The murgh peshwari was creamy..smooth gravy..the chicken was a tad bit undercooked.
We had a gala time there..but...oh well..pocket pinch...overpriced of course...unfortunately its no where near 850 for 2 if u wana have a sumptuous meal..the pocket pinch made me worry a little about this place at the end..but overall..awesome experience.

Found this restuarant as a Zomato suggestion near Kalighat metro while Pandal Hopping near the place.
They presented me with a Puja Special Menu and I was amazed to see the place fill quite rapidly maybe because of the Puja Fever.
The waiter was quite decent and helped me a lot choosing my dish and even assured to customise according to my choice. Now the environment was very friendly apart from a waiter who constantly stated at me , when I later on found he was waiting for me to take a sip from my glass so that he may fill it. :-D
First they provided complimentary Papad which was So sweet . The food was daam tasty. I tried Lahori Chicken with tadoori Naan and Keema Naam.
The quantity was decent and the food was fresh.LOVED IT. A must try Keema Naam.

Firstly the manager and the so called staff should learn some queue management skills. The service was extremely slow. Visited at saptami night it was not that crowdy but then also it took 1.5 hrs to get the seat. People coming after us were getting seats early just because they are in group. It was like its a punishment that I came with my girlfriend and we are a couple. An individual person was literally thrown out since that poor soul is alone and not accompanied but anyone else. The food was average. Puja special menu without any dessert - funniest part of the whole accident. Yes I would call visiting THE PALMS is a fatal accident on a festive evening. Wish I could give negative rating.

On Panchami,we were curious to try a new restaurant and was surfing through Zomato. On scrolling down the list of good restaurants, we came across The Palms. It is located diagnolly opposite to the Tollygunge Police Station. Our booking was quite spontaneously taken. We were a group of 9 hunger stricken people. The ambience and decor is very bright and uplifting. It will instantly give you a positive vibe. The food was lip smacking and authentic. The quantity provided was sufficient. The delicacies fully satisfied our appetite. Staffs are very cooperative and friendly. I had a very nice experience.I would definitely like to visit them again. Keep up the good work The Palms. Yay.

The restaurant is situated at one end of Southern Avenue. I visited the restaurant today with a group of friends. The interior is strikingly beautiful with their staffs being extremely humble. Our menu for the dinner was mutton boti kebab, chicken kebabs(i don't remember the name), nizam biriyan, murg peshwari and ghosht nihari. The food was utterly delicious with the perfect quantity. A must try for others.

Visited the restaurant for dinner and the first thing that struck us was the thoughtful & delicate decor. We ordered wrapped chicken in blacked pepper as a starter as per suggestion by a staff member, prawn wild spicy curry (was not available), prawn Thai red curry, fish in oyster sauce and steam rice. Though there were few customers at that hour, the starter took almost 20 minutes to arrive. However, it hardly had any flavors much to our dismay though sprinkled with black pepper and boiled with vegetables. And then we had to wait for another close to 15 minutes for our main course to come though we were the only customers around. And Just when we felt the journey was going downhill, the taste of the main course saved the day! Both the prawn Thai red curry and the fish in oyster sauce were simply brilliant with just right mix of spices and seasonings. We enjoyed them a lot with the crisp steamed rice. The staff too were cordial and perfect in their etiquettes. So following the golden phrase "All's well that ends well", pleased to give a liberal 4...

The palms! well all you food lovers, you've got a gem of a restaurant in the form of this one.

Located in Southern avenue, it is 2-3 mins walk from Rashbehari metro outlet. The ground floor is the southern avenue CCD outlet and first floor is this restaurant.

Let me take a few moment to describe this restaurant's beauty. This one is gorgeous. The vibe this restaurant gives you is something that will stay with you for quite sometime. It has got a little fountain inside the dining area and that just adds to the beauty of the place. You need to visit the place in order to understand what I am talking about.

This is a multi cuisine restaurant, so the variety of menu is there. But my friends and I chose to concentrate on Indian food.

For starters we ordered Mahi ajwaini which is basically fish kebabs and Kakori kebab. Both these dishes deserve a lot of praise. Cooked to perfection, these dishes were oozing with flavors. I highly recommend trying both these dishes.

Next we ordered mocktails. We ordered Fruit punch and Cinderella. Tbh, Cinderella disappointed me. It was very highly rated in zomato. But I found it not up to the mark. Fruit punch however was a different story. Basically it is kind of a milkshake but it tastes really good.

Then came the main course. We ordered Nizami biryani, Hyderabadi biryani and chicken oriental noodles with pakchoi. Nizami biryani was just too good. Hyderabadi biryani was awesome as well but Nizami biryani just hit all the right chords for me. Oriental noodles was a good dish as well and quantity wise was oi impressive.

We ordered two side dishes namely, Murgh Kalimirch and Murgh Bagmati. And to go with these makhani naans. Both these dishes were recommended to us by the staff and boy , they did not disappoint. Even if they tell you that the dishes are spicy, they are not exactly what I would call spicy but they taste so very good. Naan was just standard butter naan. Not much to talk about there.

For desserts we ordered sizzling brownie with hot chocolate and butterscotch icecream with dry fruits. Desserts were just the icing on the cake. You can't hate such desserts.
The service was great, the staff are very friendly and have good sense of humour that is great to see.
And yes, it is not as cheap as zomato suggests it is. So be prepared for that.

PS. i am really sorry for not clicking pics of all the dishes. It was highly irresponsible of me. I was hungry and I ate like an animal. So forgot all about clicking pics most of the time. :p

Wonderful interior and nice hospitality...  A good ambiance is created at this place without doubt..  Coming to the food..  the fish ajwani was great..  Other items that we have tried are good.. However, there are few things to be taken into account..  The table cloths could be more clean.. There's no napkin and tissue holder on the table ..  You Have to ask them for it if you need more than what you are given with the food dish.. There were speakers which could play some tunes and make the ambience better..  These are some honest reactions not to be taken by heart..

And so this place was there on my list to visit and finally went there to celebrate my mom's birthday.
The ambience is very good with friendly staff. In fact they also helped us to decide on the order mentioning their specialty dishes.
We tried Dal with gosht which was delicious and comes under their special dishes.
The biriyani surprisingly was very good, since i didn't find good biriyani in other restaurants apart from the authentic ones.
We also tried the kakori kabab which soft and tasty.
The mutton was equally tender and tasty.
They also serve Chinese, which was not up to the mark.
But the overall experience was very good.

Had gone with my family for dinner. The ambience, decor and music was really good. The staff were friendly and made us feel comfortable. 
Coming to the food i din't like it at all. We ordered murgh banjara as starters. The meat was tough and din't taste that great. We ordered murgh bagmati, ghost roganjosh, mohini naan and plain naan for our main course. The murgh bagmati was good but the roganjosh was really satly and therefore could not be had. The mohini naan which is recommended by every other person, is not good at all. Its hard around the edges, has an eggy taste and is difficult to chew.

For My 50th review I chose The Palms because of the excellent rating it had received in zomato!
Location -
Located in southern avenue -a hardly one minute walk into the lane right opposite Tollygunj thana leads to this place.
Food-
For starters we had ordered -
1)kakori kebab (4.5/5)- tender cylindrical pieces of mutton the shape is the same as that of seekh kebab with spices stronger than seekh kebab-Lip smacking!it has a very mild flavour of coriander too üòÉ -A must try!
2)mahi ajwaini (4.5/5)- this mouth watering fish kebab is definitely going to be liked by all.the bekti pieces are soft with a strong flavour of ajwain (as the name suggests) and melt into the mouth instantly! Although my personal choice would have been a milder flavour of ajwain- nevertheless it tasted great! Again a must try!
In mocktails we tried-
1)Cinderella (2/5)- this drink though highly recommended in zomato failed to impress me! It was too "syrupy" for my taste!I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!
2)Fruit punch(3/5)- served in a very tall glass üòÇ this pink drink is milk based and so fruity! Really enjoyed it! It actually tasted somewhat like strawberry shake...
Main course -
1)Chicken oriental noodles with pakchoi(3.5/5)-
Usually noodles fail to impress me yet this dish did quite a decent job! The chicken pieces were big the noodles tasted really good with its flavour uniform throughout the dish! Noodle lovers will surely like it a lot!
2) Hyderabadi dum biryani (4/5)- Hyderabadi mutton biryani that I enjoyed a lot! It didn't come with the big piece of potato and the flavours too were stronger than the delicately flavoured Bengal biryani to the extent that the biryani can be easily devoured without any side dish at all! We did try it with two side dishes and it complimented them well too. recommended to those who like strong flavoured dishes and want to try a different variant of biryani!
3) Nizami biryani(3.5/5)- a more familiar chicken biryani! This too has a strong flavour and comes without potato but is lighter in flavour compared to the Hyderabadi dum biryani! I would recommend this dish to those who are conventional (Nizami) biryani lovers! The Palms does justice to this cuisine!
4)Makhani naan (3/5)- Butter naan with not much of butter I would say...I am more used to naans that drip in butter- a healthy alternative to the contemporary naan with a light flavour of butter...but still not my kind of butter naan!
Side dish -
1)murgh kalimirch(3.5/5)- the waiter had recommended this dish to us when we had asked for something spicy- unfortunately this dish did not turn out to be spicy yet it didn't disappoint us at all! It had a smooth soft gravy with boneless juicy pieces of chicken that tasted very good- complimenting our main course extremely well! Recommended to all!
2) murgh bagmati(4/5)- it originally does not come in boneless form yet when requested this dish can be made boneless(INR 20 extra).It comes in a coriander flavoured gravy that is thick and loaded with flavours! This dish too was taken at the waiter's recommendation and I am glad we actually tried it!A must try when here...
Desserts -
Sizzling brownie with hot chocolate (3.5/5)-the brownie indeed was sizzling hot! not the best brownie that I have had but it does satisfy my chocolate cravings and the vanilla icecream came with a cherry topping! üòÉ
Service -
Service is at its best! Extremely courteous staff that take care of the entire fooding experience!
Ambience -
Very well decorated with a cute little fountain and nice bright yellow lights that make the place look outstanding!

A special mention needs to be made on the price! We were a team of five and had to pay INR 920 each! Zomato claims the price is INR 850 for two which didn't seem to be right!

I would like my review to end on this note that
Though 50 is a small number yet it deserves acknowledgements. I would like to thank

This restaurant is located at the entrance of the Southern Avenue from the Rashbehari side opposite to Tollygunj Police Station. The ground floor is a CCD and this restaurant is present on the first floor. Decent decor and well planned this restaurant is pretty good a place to visit. The television is always on with the Zoom channel irrespective of the fact whether people are watching it or not. Hence,occasional music is audible throughout. Coming to the food,we had ordered Cinderella, Fruit Punch,Kakori Kebab,Mahi Ajwaini,Nizami Biriyani,Hyderabadi Dum Biriyani,Murgh Kalimirch, Murgh Bagmati,Butter Naan,Chicken Oriental Noodles with Pakchoi,Sizzling Chocolate Brownie with Vanilla Ice-cream,Butterscotch Ice-cream with Chocolate Sauce and Dry Fruits.
The drinks we ordered were refreshing but I did not like the Cinderella drink to the extent I had expected to like it. It has too much of syrup and hence there is a synthetic kind of taste which is not desirable. I don't know what is the hype all about this drink is as I have seen almost all reviews praising this drink. The Fruit Punch was seriously very good. Very deftly made and extremely refreshing. A must try drink for everyone.
As starters we had Kakori Kebab and Mahi Ajwaini. Both were extremely delicious with Mahi Ajwaini slightly getting the better of Kakori Kebab. Kakori Kebab is the chef's special kebab here and trust me the chef will not disappoint you. The Mahi Ajwaini is a fish preparation which is very well prepared.I will definitely go back to this place to try this dish again.
For main course we had two types of biriyanis and both were extremely tasty. I would recommend their biriyanis to all. The Murgh Kalimirch and the Murgh Bagmati were not very spicy but had good flavours. They were all of six pieces each. The chicken dishes complemented better with the Naan we ordered later on. The noodle dish was one of the best noodle dish I have ever tried and it is a must try for everyone who visits this place.
The Brownie was delicious as it is expected to be and so was the Ice-cream. The presentation of the dessert items was quite impressive.
A good restaurant with a good ambience and awesome food served. The hospitality received is very appreciable. It is a little expensive but the food and service received here makes you feel that it is worth it. Do give this place a visit.

The whole decor is beautiful .. the behaviour of the staffs is very co-operative,  only the problem is this outlet remains close from 4 to 6 pm.. but overall i had a great lunch.. will look forward to visit

Visited here for a a birthday trEat on 18th September. Loved the ambience and the staff behaviour was impeccable. The food items were average. For main course we tried Oriental and ordered indian for starters . Maybe I have not triEd oriental earlier so I did not like it alot but my partner loved it . The mutton we ordered was rubbery and the staff politely took it back and cancelled it from the bill. I wish the mutton was not rubbery I would have given them higher rating. Thank you for the complimentary dessert and ice cream for birthday it was lovely. And the gulab jamun just melted in mouth. Also thank you for the  10%corporate discount. üòä. Will like to visit again .

Nice ambience. The staffs are really courteous and the best part was the owner going to every individual customer and asking for their personal feedback. We ordered for a chicken and fish starter and they were really good, tasted different. We ordered for a lamb and pork main course and the pork was little undercooked and rough. As soon as we said the same to the restaurant authority the owner herself came and apologized. She even gave us a complimentary dessert. The taste, variation and the behaviour of the staff have won my heart

Went here with family. Had a lovely experience. Decor was striking and staff was very friendly.
Starters - mahi ajwaini( fish in carom seed paste), wrap black pepper chicken ( which was served in a bamboo steamer; chicken pieces were wrapped in cabbage leaves).
Mahi ajwaini was impressive whereas the wrap wasn't anything special.
Mains- hyderabadi biriyani ( üëç mutton was tender), veg nawabi pulao n paneer maskawala were alright, mixed fried rice was good, but mostly would recommend kung pao chicken and prawn. These two stole the show. Price of dishes is fine.
Was a little disappointed as there were no pork dishes on offer.
Mr.maity and everyone else was very attentive. However, at the end of it all were all quite tired of repeatedly answering the same questions - how was the food? Was there any problem? Would we like to give any suggestions?
These should be asked only once and by one person only at the end of the meal.
Meal for two would cost around 1000 as our bill was around 4500.
Apart from these, everything else was satisfactory.

Found this restaurant in the "Hidden Gems" section of Zomato and it indeed justified the section by being a Gem.
Six of us visited there and the ambience is just lovely. It's spacey and beautifully decorated with proper lightning. The waiters were very courteous and helpful and that needs a special mention.

Coming to the food, we ordered
1. Murgh Banjara
2. Tandoor i Tiger Jheenga
3. ¬†A veg starter, the name of which I am unable to recall.

Both the chicken and the prawn starters were amazing and I really loved the taste of the pieces. The chicken was soft and juicy and I wish I had ordered more of those.

For main course I went with
1. Crispy Noodles in Black bean sauce (Seafood)
2. Wok Cooked Lamb Chop in Mongolian Sauce¬†

The noodles was awesome and cooked very well. The lamb was just delicious. They asked me for a side sauce with the lamb chops and I¬†ordered the Hot Garlic Sauce and the combination of the two was amazing once again.

So to conclude, this place is amazing. Loved the food, the ambience, the staff and even the prices are not that high when you compare them to the quality and quantity of food you get. I felt that they are a bit under-rated and more people should definitely try out this place and I can't wait to visit once again to try their pork and other dishes.

Highly Recommended!

This place was in my bookmark list for a long time and finally today visited here to have a grand lunch with my friend. At fisrt the entrance looks simply awesome with lighting staircases that leads to the main dining place. The dining place is beautifully decorated that impressed us at the first glance. We seated beside a window comfortably and then placed our order. The staffs are indeed very courteous. We ordered double fried chicken Japanese style as starter followed by chicken fried rice; Oriental noodles and kung pao chicken in main course. The food came in sharp 10 minutes one by one. First we tasted the starter which was served with a yummy sauce. The crispy crunchy chicken with that served sauce tasted awesome. Next comes the oriental noodles which i don't like that much. Comparatively the chicken rice was good. Kung pao chicken tasted decent. The portions they served was enough for two of us. Lastly we have vanilla ice cream and fresh lime soda. Today's food journey was a perfect one.

Last month with my wife visited The Palms. Located opposite to Tollygunge PS, next to the southern avenue bulevard. The ambiance is very good, staffs are courteous.

¬†We ordered Hyderabadi Dum Biriyani & Koobideh. The biriyani, was spicy and excellent taste.¬†

I've hard a lot about Koobideh, an Iranian delicacy, so thought of trying it. The preparation was OK, though tasted more like a Sheek Kabab. I feel this is not the real taste of Koobideh, as the smoky flavor of charcoal is completely missing.

The bill coming @ 750 a bit dearer, I think.

I have had their Oriental Cuisine before and had been very satisfied with the experience. However, this time, I wanted to try the Indian cuisine as I wanted to see if it was as good as the Oriental one. Usually I prefer restaurants which specialize in one single cuisine - but The Palms changed my point of view for ever. The Indian food was as good (if not better) than the oriental one. We had Galawti Kebab and Mahi Ajwani as starters and then had Onion Palak Rice and Ghost Rarha. The staff is extremely cordial and attentive. They are always keen to make you feel comfortable and important. Guest handling is something most restaurants miss out on and they only focus on food. The Palms is an exception regarding that. They have the killer combination of excellent food (both Indian and Oriental), great and soothing ambiance with well spaced out decor, and excellent guest handling by all the staff. Could not recommend more.

Visited this place on my birthday 5th September,with great expectation.Interior was very good,nice table and chairs with prompt service and behavior.complimentaty papad was spicy.we ordered sultani irani as a nonveg and naram dil as a veg starter,they served nonveg starter first and after some time the veg starter without asking us.we dont liked it at all,after eating nonveg starter,it seemed very bad for us,then i packed that dish to take away.
                                 Taste wise sultani irani was good but meat quality very hard,naram dil was not a good dish,it was a heavy dish to eat..then cheese garlic naan and mohini naan both were very tasty with great quality..found a hair in mohini naan..murg hara pyaaz was good but not great,chicken quality was soft but not very much,gravy was ok type.prices are on higer side compared to taste and quality.espected more than this from them,so for me the dinner was below average.After eating at punjabe rasoi ,we dont like palm's teaste and meat quality.

Food was just about average. We were particularly disappointed with the artificial colours they¬†use in various dishes. We ordered Sweet Corn soup which was below standard in both taste and appearance (bright yellow in colour), Mojito was shockingly green and so was the 'Tiranga kebab'! Done with the lunch, we were asked to fill in a feedback form where we put in these honest comments while also rating the restaurant well for ambiance, decor, cleanliness etc. The worst part - the manager actually questioned us almost threateningly as to why we had put in our views and to top it off argued saying it was 'Oriental' food which we did not understand.¬†Such behaviour is totally unacceptable from a senior staff member, especially when the other staff was quite polite.

If someone wants to go for mughlai or awadhi food this is one of the best place I have ever seen. Really worthy to go there. People were really nice. Food is really great and finger licking. Its very testy but not that much spicy or oily. Chicken peshawari kebabs, lahori murg, gosht jalandari were just awesome. The best part is the decor and the ambience. Loved it and planing for next turn.

Good food and good ambiance sums up this place. very conveniently located in south kolkata. Though the road infront is a bit dim lighted. The service people could have been a little more trained.

This is a relatively new (less than an year old) restaurant located on Southern Avenue, and I wanted to try the food after hearing a lot of good reviews from my friends. So I ate there last evening with friends, and the food was truly excellent: authentic flavors, yet innovative, and beautifully presented. Being a vegetarian, I had the 'Naram Dil' kebab, an innovative paneer kebab which is indeed a speciality of the place and also had Khumb Nawabi - which is essentially stuffed mushrooms with special herbs. We followed it up with Kashmiri Pulao, Maharaja Kofta, naan and Dal Bukhara. The decor and ambiance was excellent and the staff were very attentive. They were courteous, and refilled the glasses of water and wanted feedback about the food. The ambiance and the dining experience was indeed excellent. Highly recommended.

Amazing oriental cooking!! I tried the Seafood Pad Thai & Kung Pao Chicken. Really perfect use of spices. Loved the ambience & service as well. We ended the meal with a very healthy dessert of Fried Apple with honey & Ice Cream (it was suggested by the restaurant so might have got the name wrong.) All in all had a wonderful experience & definitely planning to go back!!

Full points on the decor, the staff and variety. However, I was a little disappointed because two items from what we selected were not there and we were I informed that many of the 'main course' items were some variety of side dish.

The behavior of every person working here is amazing. They kept on asking for our opinion and feedback so that would definitely make up for any complaints that you may have. 

We did not like the sweet corn soup but the chef special squid, ice cream in chocolate sauce and noodles were quite good. The food might take a little too long to reach your table but it is mostly worth the wait :)

First impression and the Ambience
It was the afternoon of 70th Independence Day, and I had planned a lunch with my friend. I had another restaurant in mind, but since that one and all others on my list were closed, i turned to The Palms which according to Zomato users was a fine place. And I do agree. The Palms has a very nice ambience, except for the fact that there is a pillar in the middle of the restaurant that blocks the view and a slight step up just beside it where our table-attendent almost stumbled and fell. We chose a table that gave a fine view of the Southern Avenue and the prompt service of the attendant impressed me. The lighting was adequate and pristine. A water fountain had been setup which one can see on entering the floor. It is well maintained and adds to the aesthetics of the restaurant.

The Drinks
We were both pretty hungry so we ordered a Virgin Mojito and a Virgin Blue Lagoon. The mojito was good with an over-generous amounts of basil. The blue lagoon was as usual, nothing special but what i liked was the sweetness was perfect, not too much not too less. I, as with a blue lagoon cocktail, expected some sour, or rather tangy, taste of the lime cordial. But overall it was only sweet. 

The Food
I love kebabs. So a non-veg kebab platter was the first thing we ordered. And for the main course, we chose a completely different dish. On asking the attendant, we were suggested a Pad Thai noodles which we wanted with pork and a schezwuan chicken cooked to medium spicy. However on choosing pork as the ingredient to the noodles, we were told they only had pork slices and also within minutes of confirming the order, the attendant came back to inform us they had also run out of pad thai noodles. So we just ordered one plate of prawn noodles. The order took sometime to be delivered. I presume since they had just opened an hour before, they were not prepared enough. 
         Soon the kebab platter arrived and the attendant served them. The attendant surely knows how to plate the food. Now the platter contained fish kebabs,tandoori prawn, chiken (ajwain) kebab, mutton seekh kebab, and a chicken tandoori kebab. The fish kebab was well done and the fish was tender and juicy. The chicken (ajwain) kebab was simply too dry. The tandoori prawns were overdone and i knew that because it had shrunk and the prawn was a bit chewy. The mutton sheekh kebaba was good aa it was both tasty as well as soft. Last was the chicken tandoori which was tasty but was a little bit dry. By now my expectations had dropped. When the noodle and the schezwuan chicken arrived, i was however relieved to find that atleast the prawn in the noodles were perfectly cooked amd unlike many other noodles i have tasted, this one definitely stood out. It did not reek of ajina moto, but it had nice subtle flavors added. I later learned that the sauce for the noodles and various other oriental dishes were actually imported. The chiken schezwuan was another bowl of surprise. I have never had a schezwuan that had been spiced spiced up just as i like. It was medium spicy in the true sense, hot enough to give you the sensation of schezwuan yet not burn your tongue. The chicken pieces, although pretty small, were soft and yer well-cooked.

The Quality, Quantity amd Pricing
The Palms does have a tipsy relation with quality. There might have been good reasons on tjat specific day. But given another day, i hope The Palms will be able to deliver upto the expectaitons and justify their pricing.
The quantity was unsatisfactory on many levels. First for a kebab platter, priced same as that in many other contemporary restaurants, had neither the quality nor the quantity. The mutton sheekh kebab was tiny as was the chicken tandoori. The serving portion for the noodles and the side dish was just enough for one person.
The pricing is inaccurate in Zomato. We ended up paying Rs.1700 (including taxes) for two people with our stomachs still not full to the brim.

The overall exprience
The Palms has a nice ambience, but the quality and the quantity with pricing of the food was a bit disappointing. But all hope's not lost as this place definitely deserves a second chance for i would definitely recommend for the fish kebab, and prawn noodles.

First thing first, if anyone is looking for AMBIENCE, The Palms presents you with that. Amidst the little fountain and small palm trees, this restaurant also brings in perfect cuisine. I went there today with a friend and we tried out the Mughlai Dishes. For starters we took Jojeh which was god damn great. For main course there were Murgh Peshawari and Nizami Biriyani. The Biriyani was really great and filing but the Murgh Peshawari was something which I liked the most. Cost wise it was bit on the higher side, but¬† considering two hungry people like us were there, it was ok. Other than that , the service of the waiters were absolutely good. There were well behaved and they came up with good suggestions for the meal. Overall the place is just great and I am looking forward to visit once again. Have it say 5 out of 5 is less for the ratings and its a hidden gem.

Yesterday me and my better half was here after puja shopping. It was Janmashtami Holiday . Let's share my feedback.

Ambience : very good .Eye soothing .

Food : We could not try much as we were two only.We ordered non veg kabab platter and mojito flavour lime soda . I must say It was very good , but could have been more better with more option .Infact I will suggest add some kabab which are special rather than same old Sikh or Tandoori kabab.So that customer order that kabab separately .

Now regarding Maharaja kofta ...just mind blowing with butter nun.I will recommend it for everyone.
Service : It is very good . They are very attentive to the customer.

I will again visit this restro very soon with all my family member. :)

I am usually wary of places that advertise themselves as multi-cuisine, because they are rarely able to do justice to all cuisines. Thankfully, The Palms isn't one of those places. I celebrated my brother's birthday there and we were a group of seven people. The food - be it North Indian, Chinese or Thai, all were equally good. The galauti¬†kabab and the Pad-Thai Noodles were especially good.¬†

For a pocket-friendly place, the ambience is really good. The staff is also courteous.

On the day of Rakshabandhan we got into this place for the first time. They had a soothingly stylish ¬†ambiance and the service was diligently prompt. In starters we had Boti Kebab (Mutton could have been more softer like the one in Punjab Rasoi which melts in your hand) and Murg Banjara (the chicken was juicy and succulent). The maincourse consisted of Mutton Hyderabadi Dum Biriyani (Somehow i felt the same flavour at bombay shiv sagar tastes better even though its veg) , Mutton Zafrani Biriyani (i did not try so no comments on this), Mohini Naan (was best amongst all other dishes which we tried here), Pudina Paratha (t was bit dry and lacked flavour) and Murg Bagmati (I think I cook a better Green Chicken at home than this but its good only). It was thursday and we got an discount of 25% on the billing amount of Rs.1900. It seems they are giving this discount only for this month on all thursdays so worth a try. We will try out their oriental dishes anytime soon and post the reviews for the same. All I can say is that we were 3 of them and had mixed reactions on the food we had. I did not like it that much compared to the liking's of my other two folks, both of them just loved it. An average rating of 3.5 from my side for the Indian dishes which we tried here but since both of them liked the dishes so much I would rate it 4.

One of the best restaurants that I have been to and now the only regret is that of not being here earlier. The entrance is mind blowing and the interiors of the restaurant is lavishly decorated. Plush comfortable seating arrangements, a small fountain in the middle, all magnify the brilliance of the ambience.
I have always been a bit sceptical about multicuisine restaurants and have preferred those specialising in a particular type of cuisine, but I must admit I have been proved wrong.
Words cannot express how good the food was. The starters consisted of Koobideh (Sheekh kebabs - Iranian style), Galawti kebabs and Double fried chicken Japanese style. Each of the dishes were,simply put, delectable.
For main course we ordered Hyderabadi Biryani, Nihari, Kung Pao Chicken and Chicken Phad Thai noodles. In a group of 4, two of us went Mughlai and the other two went Oriental. All I can say is that the Nihari is one of the best that I have ever had.....I can keep coming back to this place just for the nihari. The Hyderabadi Biryani was also very good, cooked in very little oil too. Had a taste of the Oriental dishes too....The Kung Pao Chicken was very good and the Noodles were standard. For dessert we ordered Badam firni and  Ice cream with dry fruits and Chocolate Sauce, which were standard too. 
Service was exceptionally good....The hospitality that they offer is something that is a lesson in itself for others. Kudos to the staff and management for taking care of their guests so well and making them feel so special.
This is my 10th review for Southern Avenue area and I am so happy to review a restaurant as good as The Palms.

Interiors are lavish. Music was strange. The presentation of the dishes were good. Portion size was small considering the quantity you get at other places for the same prices. Taste was good. The chicken in the Oriental noodles didn't seem to be properly seasoned. The sliced lamb in red wine sauce was nice, albeit kind of chewy. The starters Black pepper chicken was good.
The service is quite good and the servers are attentive. But, maybe the Palms should search for some innovation if they want to live upto the look and feel of the restaurant.

The Palms is one of the restaurant which I am regretting for not keeping in my wishlist till date. The main reason I did not keep it is because I generally do not prefer restaurants which serve a wide variety of cuisines and do not specialize in a certain genre. But my premonition found an exception tonight in the name of "The Palms". From the wide stairs and a beautifully decorated entrance corridor, to the magnificent rocky interiors to the mini artificial fountain at the center surrounded by plants, to the comfortable plush chairs, this outlet has all the luxuries one need to recognize it as a fine dining restaurant. The place can be easily located as it is on the junction of S.P Mukherjee Road - Southern Avenue crossover on the left hand side (if one travels towards the Golpark junction). Also, the outlet is very well lit adding a positive vibe to the place.

Coming to the food, as I had mentioned earlier in my reviews, I leave the orders on the attendant if I find the place and the attendants sensible enough, and I did the same here. On the attendant's recommendation, we took the Wrap Black Peppered Chicken as starter, and Chicken Oriental Noodles and Sczheuan Chicken in the mains. The starter seemed very well cooked and garnished with bell peppers. The chicken was succulent and had pepper chunks which made it taste brilliant. However, the dish was overall on the healthier side while I was buying on something tangy and not so healthy at that time. My desire got wings when I gave the first bite to the Sczheuan Chicken, which was the showstopper dish of the day. With brilliant modulation of the traditional form, the dish came along with a dash of tangy sauce mixed in the legacy Sczheuan sauce of dried chillis. The side dish accompanied the base of Chicken Oriental Noodles brilliantly as the noodles was soya-based with spring onions and chicken in generous portions. Loved every bit of the mains ! Then came the time when I started longing for a sweet dessert after the spicy affair, when the attendant revealed that they have my favorite Gajar Ka Halwa in the Indian section of desserts. Without a tinge of doubt I ordered it as I haven't had it since my mother made it around 6 months back. The Halwa was excellently made without being inappropriately sweet, and with perfect amount of ghee for the flavor. I liked it to the core of my heart and ended with so much satisfaction that we ordered for the same mains as takeaway too.

Coming to the service, I must say it plain and simple - I haven't witnessed such a decorated service in a long time. The team led by the supervisor and the order taker, Mr.Alam is an outperformer and is a priced possession of any restaurant. The outlet manager (could not ask the name) is a nice person too and he is the one who came forward and suggested me the dessert ! The service staffs were cordial too with a bright smile on their faces which is one of the most important things I look out for. So, an extra point to the team for their hospitality and service.

Although the pocket pinch was on a bit higher side going by the quantity they serve, but the taste of food and the hospitality you get there deserves every penny spent over it. To conclude, I had one beautiful dining experience at The Palms and would definitely be back again to try out their other genres. Till then, wishing the team all the best for every bigger step forward. Cheers !

P.S. The Noodles in the take away pack was a bit less than what we had on the table. So, please look into it to avoid this in the future.

The Palms is situated near the Kalighat Metro Station, a minute's walk towards Southern Avenue, it shares the building with Cafe Coffee Day.
An enticing & classy restaurant, with lavish interiors, yet humble and welcoming, starting from the door-keeper, the waiters, and the lady manager.
They serve both North-Indian and Oriental cuisine. This was my first visit, tried only North-Indian, and was thoroughly delighted with their sheer excellence in preparing each item. We tried:
1. Ajwani Mahi Tikka ( grilled cubes of bhetki fish that melts in the mouth, with a dominating Ajwain flavour)
2. Koobideh (Irani minced meat kebabs, very soft and well cooked)
3. Kumbh Nawabi (A must-try item... an awesome, sweet, cashew-based gravy on stuffed mushroom, has become my favourite now )
4. Nihari (Soft mutton in a sober gravy, low on spices, yet extremely tasty)
5. Butter Naan
6. Sizzling Brownie with hot chocolate sauce and vanilla ice-cream (too good a choice to end the meal with, all the steaming chocolate bubbling beneath the brownie & the cold scoop of vanilla!!)
All the items were sufficient for two people, which makes the price affordable.
Planning to visit again, to try their oriental. You guys deserve a 5/5.. Keep up the good food!!!

Visited this place today with my friends. I shall never recommend this outlet to anyone. The starters (double fried chicken in japanese style and kakori kabab) were good. But the rest of the food was horrible. Mohini naan was so stiff that premolars and molars would hv succumbed. Chicken preparation was below average. Besides, the mutton was very stiff as well. This is absolutely unacceptable. Don't waste your money folks! Sorry The Palms team for being so truthful.

date of visit 8/8/16 . i had nearbuy coupons for a 5 course lunch with complimentary drinks . when i entered at about 2 pm the place was completely empty. still at first they refused to give me a seat saying that to avail nearbuy coupons we have to do prior reservation. In other places i didnt face this problem with the coupons . never mind after making us stand for quite sometime they offered us seat and then someone took my phone containing the coupons andwent away. i felt shocked that without my permission how could he do so. he returned my phone after 10 to 15 mins and then took the order ,. the food came late , we were hungry. nevermind better late than never. food was extremely good. had chicken clear soup , double fried chicken japanese style, kung pao chicken, chicken fried rice and oriental chicken noodles . our meal ended with butterscotch ice cream and lemon soda. from the starter to the dessert everything was perfect. portions were good and my dish of the day was double fried chicken which was served with a chutney . really hoping to go there again and expecting a better behaviour ¬†from the staffs .or else i would have given a perfect 5.

This place scores high in terms of food and ambience. We ordered butter naan mohini naan and masala kulcha in breads. Along with that we ordered paneer maskawala and chicken hara pyaz. The paneer dish was quite mouth watering. A little sweet and will go quite well with naan or polau. The chicken was also good in terms of taste. The price is quite reasonable. Only I found the service to be a little slow. Next time I am going to try the Chinese and continental menu. Overall a cherishing experience.

‚ÄòThe Palms‚Äô, as tropical as the name may sound brings to you a strong punch of North Indian taste straight to your palette.

It was an multi cuisine dine in restaurant which serves Thai, Asian, Chinese, singaporean etc cuisines. Situated in Southern Avenue besides Rashbihari crossing just 2-3 minutes walking from Kalighat metro on the 1st floor of the building where CCD was. If we talk about place it was damn sexy. Very rich looking restaurant. From decor to sitting arrangement all were very ravishing and luxurious. It was an perfect luxurious dine in restaurant which serves delicious cuisine and where easily 50-60 people can sit.

Visited the restaurant a few days back...simply stated,is 1 of the best food experiences in kolkata.
The ambience is great and service is just as prompt. From the starting itself,service was friendly and always followed a smile.
Moving over to the food,i was quite surprised to be served papads with 2 dips in d starting itself as complimentary ones. We ordered gosht galawati kebabs and double fried chicken japanese style(6 pieces each per plate)
The kebab just melted in the mouth and was so soft,seriously 1 of the best kebabs i have ever tasted...a must try.
Next was the double fried chicken with salad and a dip,the chicken was so succulent and well fried,a sure order next time i visit there. We were left craving for more of those pieces of fried chicken. The dip was equally good but the salad tasted a bit blank.
Next in main course,we ordered mohini nan and murgh bagmati, 
The nan once again proved the high quality of the food served here with the spring onions and butter on the nan creating the perfect balance,once again a must try.
Murgh bagmati was also good but i personally felt that i have tasted better north indian chicken dishes previously,still i loved the gravy.
And regarding the amount,it was enough to content me,the perfect combination of quantity and quality.
Didnt have any desserts this time but i am pretty sure i will be back here soon to taste more and a sure recommendation to all my friends.

A meal at Palms is an experience. This place has some fantastic interiors (the walls you see are all made up of stacked marble stones and not wallpaper !!) comfortable seats, great ambiance and most importantly, delicious food. 
There are a wide range of dishes availabe and on my last visit there, I sampled some innovative dishes, starting with appetizers like Stir Fried Water Chestnut, and it was my favorite! I didnt know the underrated panifal could be cooked and that too in such a great manner, with asparagus and snow peas. I also had the kumbh galawti kebab (mushroom galawti kebab) which is a burst of all kinds of flavours in your mouth, like sweet, salty, tangy, spicy, all of it. If you are fond of paneer, order the Naram Dil which is kind of like paneer cutlets but on a very epic level! The paneer is extremely soft, slightly sweet, wrapped inside a crispy crumb coating. The steamed black pepper chicken came served in an oriental style steaming basket followed by the murgh banjara which is their most mildy flavored kebab, which also tends to melt in your mouth.
For main course I would highly recommend you to order their Mohini Naan, which is stuffed with eggs and seasoned with fresh herbs. To put it simply, its like a baked mughlai paratha but much more delicious, and healthy. It goes really well with the dal.bukhara, which is daal makhani with the dry alu bukhara fruit added in abundance. You can also go for the Murgh Bagmati which is chicken in a red, north indian gravy. 
I am not very fond of Hyderababdi Biryani because I worship our Kolkata style biryani and hate curry patta in my favorite rice dish. But surprisingly, the hyderabadi biryani here has been prepared to suit the Calcutta palate, minus the rai and curry leaves and I am definitely going back for more.

Located in southern avenue, right beside the popular CCD outlet, this restaurant was on my wish list for long!
I have often crossed it and was intrigued by the show window, giving a peek of the place.

On one evening, I happened to visit the restaurant.
Give below is my experience-

AMBIANCE:
You enter the main door and are welcomed by a fleet of steps leading you to the restaurant. The entire setting is dim light with few lights here and there, added for effect. You know, that something beautiful awaits you! Indeed, beauties it was! Followed by a waiting area, you push open the heavy gate to a stunning restaurant.
The interiors are tastefully done, with only nude shades dominating the palatte. Browns, beige, white and yellow lights, simply glorify the beauty that is The Palms!
The tiled walls are a delight to watch and you instantly decide, that you are in the right place!

FOOD:
The restaurant offers multi- cuisine like any other fine dining and the menu is well selected.
On offer are north Indian and oriental delights.
I had the opportunity of tasting the following-
‚Ä¢ Heavans calling which had a subtle mojito flavor
‚Ä¢ Deep sea which was essentially jaljeera, chat masala based drink
‚Ä¢ Cinderella was a pretty looking drink, dominated by strawberry flavour
‚Ä¢ The fruit punch was just about decent
‚Ä¢ Strawberry blossom had strawberry and cream bit I felt maybe the drink lacked depth
‚Ä¢ Stir fried water chestnut, asparagus and snow peas was a winning starter with tangy flavours and crunch from the veggies! #recommended
‚Ä¢ Khumb galouti kebab was a stunning dish with minced paste of mushroom, seasoned and spiced over a roti and garnished with onion #recommended
‚Ä¢ Naram dial was a heavy starter with minced Paneer, peas coated with cornflakes and deep fried!
‚Ä¢ For mains the Maharaja kofta was a good dish, with Paneer, spinach in a rich tomato gravy #recommended
‚Ä¢ Dal Bukhara fell flat as I was missing the smoky, creamy flavour from the lentils
‚Ä¢ vegetable dulhaari was another good dish, with mix veggies in a spinach and tomato gravy
‚Ä¢ Murgh bagmati was a succulent chicken dish in green gravy and tasted very good! #recommended
‚Ä¢ Mohini nan had flavoura of egg and spring onion in a roti and is a must try! #recommended
‚Ä¢ other bread staples were decent ( garlic nan, butter nan)
‚Ä¢ the onion and palak rice was a winning dish and one of the best rice preparations tried by me in a while #recommended #musttry
‚Ä¢ The badam firni lacked flavour and texture and was disappointing
‚Ä¢ Date pancakes were dry and lacked any glaze and syrup

SERVICE-
Was good and a special shout out to Biswanath for being extremely hospitable!

Overall, a wonderful place for a fine dine evening with your family and friends! With just few improvements in the dessert section, I am sure The Palms is a complete dining experience!
A special thank you to the warm owner, Priyadarshini Dey!

Located very close to the kalighat metro station,this place is easily accesible.The restaurant is on the first floor of the same building as of CCD. Very courteous staff,excellent and prompt service,average pocket pinch and especially delectable food make this place worth visiting. The galawati kebab melts in your mouth. Hyderabadi biriyani is spicy but tastes good. Zafrani murgh biriyani is closer to the kolkata biriyani we are so used to having. And the Lahori Murgh didnt disappoint us as wel. Overall this place will surely win you over. I am definitely coming back to taste their oriental dishes.

'The Palms', as tropical as the name may sound brings to you a strong punch of North Indian taste straight to your palette. While the mocktails here can still agree with the name of the restaurant, their other items on the menu goes beyond that theme and delightfully surprises you.

Foodie Meets are always great, especially when you are called by

Visited this resto on July 21st,2016
Hadn't been in a such restaurant since early 2015, but this one was better. Good staff and quiet a fast service as well.
Ambience was wonderful, 10/10 for that.

Coming to the dishes there were loads of stuffs we tried today,
Drinks:
Heavens Calling(5.6/10): Didn't like this drink much since it tasted like chloromint water. Not worth it.

Deep Sea(8/10): The drink had a depth of a light sour and sweetness which was refreshing, this was the best drink in the lot.

Cinderella(7/10): This one was pretty dilute in texture
Fruit Punch(8/10): The strawberry's take was higher in this that the other fruits. The sweetness was right and it was good.
Strawberry Blossom(6/10) This was pretty much like the Fruit punch just fully strawberry and a little high on the sweetness.

***Starters***
Murgh Banjara(9.5/10): Best starter in the lot. Wonderfully Cooked to perfection, the flavors sprouted out very well.Moist and soft chicken, the spices were accurately included. It was a best kebab i've had.

Steamed Black Pepper Chicken(7.5/10): Presentation was beautiful, done in a bamboo strip slice container. Light on the spices, moderate on the pepper, well cooked chicken, good on taste.

Naram Dil(8/10): I don't like veg dishes when 'm paying, but I loved this. This is perfect for 4 people(8pcs) because the size of each pc is good. The mix of finely grated cottage cheese with capsicum stole the tastebuds of a pure non-vegetarian.

**Mains**
Murgh Bagmati(8.5/10): This was palatable! Greenish gravy with hot, moist chicken is just what you should try. The spices and the gravy had penetrated to the core of the Chicken and yes, it was carried the essence of the herbs and spices used.
Fish Amritsari(8/10): The reddish orange gravy was at the right composition of spices and the flavors were remarkable. The fish was soft and yummy, one of the best fish dishes i've had.

Mohini Naan(7/10): Thick and hard to tear off so you might need two hands. This was not so much on taste, but pretty much on the essence eggs.It tasted like an Egg Roll. (This isn't vegetarian so be careful)
Garlic Naan(8.5/10) : I'm definitely trying this again when I go back. Crispy outside. The taste of garlic and the oil truly reveals the chef's expertise in this.

Hyderabadi Dum Biryani(9.5/10): This was my best Hyderabadi Biryani till date. OMG! The favours of the mutton was spread evenly and the aromatic rice grains increases your hunger, so was the spices in the rice. This one was awesome! Worth 10000 more tries!They should've provided boneless mutton pieces(several small pieces), because the pieces were 40% bones, and it looks and feels better and easier to share. Bones are good only if they provide 1/2 big pieces.

***Desserts***
Date Pancake(8/10): This thing is wonderfully sweet. Not too less, nor too much, just perfect. The filling just melts on the tastebuds and mesmerize the end of the meal.

Thank You the Palms for the wonderful evening!

I had seen many nice reviews before visiting this place. So naturally I had a huge expectation from this place. This restaurant has a very prominent location. It's a few minutes walk from Kalighat metro station. The interiors are exquisite. It's a multicuisine restaurant and I had opted for north indian cuisine. But somehow I didn't find the food SO much impressive as I had read in the reviews. It's good, of course but there's nothing so special about it. Compared to the heavy taxes we pay now-a-days for eating, this restaurant charges a low tax of 6%. Overall It's good, but nothing noteworthy.

This is one of the newest in the Southern Avenue area at the end of the sp Mukherjee end. It has a look of a polished fine dining restaurant and the crew is extremely courteous and welcoming. It offers Indian as well as Oriental food. 

Three of us went on a Thursday evening and the restaurant was largely empty. We decided to have India and ordered their kebab platter which had jhinga, fish, chicken tandoori, sheekh kebab and mutton kebab. All of them met expectations. For main course we ordered amritsari fish and a chicken in cashew and cheese gravy. The chicken was tasty but sweet and the fish was based on a tomato gravy and was very tasty. The quality of fish was good as well. We finished our dinner with gulab jamun and badam firni, both good. 

Overall a good pace to visit.

Excellent place.. Amazing food. Very calm atmosphere with a fountain running in the middle.. The sound of water falling was adding to the experience. Very good customer service. The peshawri naan is a must try... They could not half of the stuff in menu as their ingredients weren't there. But the chicken with mint leaves were truly amazing.

Been there yesterday with my family for a dinner after shopping...and I must say the first look and ambience is awsome. First of all,the location is very good. Secondly the staff were courteous and always helpful. About the food, it's nice. We ordered Mahi kasundi...it was delicious. We also had another chicken kebab for starters. For the main course we had methinks paratha, which cud have been better, mohini Naan and murgh baghmati- two new type of dishes are worth trying for. Above all was the dessert- sizzling brownie with hot chocolate and vanilla ice cream was tantalizing. On the whole though I expected a bit more on the food...I'll definitely plan for a second visit.

Had been thinking for too long to go check this place out and finally it happened last week. The walk through when you enter definitely makes you feel posh ;) Beautiful decor with very welcoming staff. Now the most important part- FOOD!! I don't quite remember when was the last time I had biriyani of that class... We ordered two types of biriyani...Nizami and Hyderabadi...murg masallam (salivating uncontrollably right now!) and my most dear dish... With all its mystery KUMBH GALAUTI! I could never believe what it actually is till I actually tasted it and then I was told I was actually wrong about what it is till I was told what it actually was... Hehe... That's a must for all! Ten points for guessing what it is without external help! :P A beautiful experience overall... Thinking about it is making my stomach make weird noises... I am definitely going back to this place as soon as possible! All the goodies out there... Do check it out!

Blissful Sunday Brunch

I would like to thank zomato for the gift voucher of the palms. I walked in last sunday for a planned lunch over there with my friend and the experience is amazing. From the very first step you will take to enter, the illusory lights in the stairs are there to make you feel you are in the right place.

This restaurant is at a walking distance of 5 minutes from kaalighat metro, in southern avenue, same building of CCD. Very easy to trace I say. We got warm greetings from the staffs and they guided us to our seats. I loved the window side seats. The interior decoration is sophisticated and sober. They were playing instrumentals in the background. I liked it. 

We ordered Nizami biriyani and Ghost rarha for the main course. Yes I skipped the starters as we are people with small appetite :P The biriyani was good but the ghost rarha was extra ordinary. The mutton keema gravy was too tasty and not that spicy at all. The aroma is enough to make your mouth water and the quality of the meat was very good.. One quantity of each was enough for two people. We ordered fresh lime soda and a mocktail I have forgotten it's name. The name starts with green, it was cool. The server foods with eminent condiments and in case of biriyani, they serve raita.

I must mention the behavior of every single staffs was very good and they were too descent. Whenever we tried to serve ourselves, they rant to us and served. I will definitely visit again and I think I will plan a mass visit with my friends over here soon. Lots of love for the palms :)

The Palms located in a prime location at Southern Avenue, quite easy to locate. The decor is absolutely beautiful and staffs equally courteous. We tried a few things from the East Asian menus.  Pan fried fish was good but a bit bland to our likings.. Sui Mai seafood was superb.We tried pot rice with chicken glass noodles as main course. It was good, at least I liked it.  Price is bit on the higher side if the quantities are taken into mind. Would luv to try their mughlai menu n other Indian dishes sometime soon.

I had visited the restaurant few days back with the expectation of some good food as read in the zomato reviews but was disappointed with the food. The chinese was not good as expected but the rating that I m giving is truly because of the Indian food that was satisfactory.  A suggestion is to work on their Chinese cuisine

There is no option in Zomato to give a negative rating else I would have gone ahead and given a negative rating to this place. Located next to the entrance of the Lake road.¬†

The decor of this place is awesome, but we actually do not go to a restaurant to see the decor rather for food. For the kid we had ordered chicken corn soup and when the soup came, it was something which I have not seen in ages, a soup which was completely yellow. I could understand that the corn was smashed and applied to the soup but the taste of the soup was terrible.

On the starters we ordered kebab platter where we got fish, prawn, chicken tandoor and mutton sheekh kebab. Lets first go with the sheekh kebab, buy any sheekh kebab from the cold storage of spencers it will still taste better than what we had been served. Fish tandoor smelt of raw oil and all of the them were stale. Chicken tandoor, better go to any roadside stall may be with no name serving tandoor, they will serve you better tandoor than this place.¬†

I truly did not had the guts to order something from the main course. The manager came and ordered a replacement of this, but I denied for one single fact. It may be possible that one of two items on the platter may be wrong, but the whole platter going wrong means there is something serious wrong with the food here and no point in going forward and even trying something from here. The owner also came to us and told that the chef is from wassbi mumbai and my only question was really? How come the food items tastes like I am having something from #nothingtobe.¬†

The only thing which I liked about this place is the water and the decor. Go there if you are feeling thirsty and want to have a glass of water, for the rest there are far far better places in Kolkata or may be in southern avenue to try.

The best North Indian food that I have had in ages:). 
I wasn't aware of The Palms and it's only because of Zomato and Ms. Samriddhi Shanghvi that I went there. I received an INR 600 voucher from The Palms. 
It was my birthday and I wanted something special; I'm bored to death with all the Chinese offerings and the plethora of Biriyanis on offer. I checked the menu on Zomato and found that The Palms serve both North Indian and exotic Oriental fare. 
So, we went in around 8.30 pm. It was Saturday night, but The Palms was surprisingly empty. Anyway, we settled down by the window that offered a nice view of Southern Avenue. The restaurant itself is splendid. The decor makes you feel that you have stepped inside a plush 5-star restaurant. It's hugely spacious and has a warm welcoming feel. The sofas for once, are hugely plush and relaxing. 
Coming to the food, I wanted North Indian. We ordered for Makhani Karahi, Mahi Ajwaini and Kasundi Mahi in starters. The makhni Karahi is a chicken starter. 8 pieces of chicken that's lovely tandoored on the outside, but soft and juicy on the inside. The chicken had a balanced sweet and sour taste. The fish Ajwaini had 8 pieces of soft, flaky fish. The Ajwain flavour was a bit too prominent for my tastebuds, but I'm not complaining. The best one was the kasundi Mahi. The fish was flaky as expected; the marinate was a nice creamy affair; the kasundi or mustard wasn't too overpowering and it created a tantalising effect with the dahi used for the marinate.
The main course was simple: peas pulao, Maharaja Kofta and Murg Bagmati. The pulao had long-grained rice. The best part about the pulao was it didn't have the excessive aroma from rose water or kewra water like you get in most Mughlai restaurants. The Maharaja Kofta was truly a king's dish. It had two large koftas in a creamy saffron gravy. The kofta was made out of panner, palak and peas with spices. The gravy was yummy. I Dnt really rave about veg preparations much, but this one was superb. The Murg Bagmati is a signature dish of The Palms. It's very different from the run of the mill tomato and onion gravy that you get in Indian restaurants. The gravy was made with palak, coriander and spices. The chicken pieces were decent. I will go back to have the Murg Bagmati again. The meal ended with a banana toffee with honey. 
The ambience, as I said, is exquisite. The service is awesome. The service time is extraordinarily good; we didn't have to wait for more than 10 minutes after placing the order. The attendants are awesome. Thank you Zomato for gifting me a great meal. Thanks The Palms for a truly gastronomic experience. I will certainly come back again.

First thing that strikes you is the elegant decor of this place. Located at a very convenient corner in South Kolkata this restaurant serves Indian and oriental food. Sounds pretty mundane but in reality this restaurant's offerings matches it's decor. And there are enough innovations in the menu to keep u hooked.
Our order ...
Naram dil - dil ko chhuu lene wala...mix of cottage cheese, spring onion,  peas crumb fried to create a superb starter..
kebab platter .. whole spectrum of kebabs ...Mahi tikka, prawn and chicken tandoori, mutton bara kebab and chicken seekh...all well done and nicely presented.
Gosht roganjosh...Succulent pieces of mutton swimming in a rich delectable gravy...perfect for lapping up with ....
Mohini naan.... usual butter naan with a twist. It has a subtle coat of egg and spring onions...this helps in doing away with the monotony of white....
whole chicken tandoori ..well done,  however nothing special about it.
Hamara khaas dal...very well tempered...very tasty with the right consistency...a palate cleanser with steamed rice
For dessert we opted for sizzling brownie with icecream. Now the sizzler is a little inconvenient as far as desert ia concerned. It is difficult to tackle and the chocolate sauce gets bitter because of the intense heat..
We actually wanted to taste some of the oriental delicacies like steamed salmon and red snapper but the restaurant was not serving it...
The bottpmline  ... great value for money, great service and ambience...
My next visit would be too savour the oriental delicacies...hope they will be well-stocked by then....

Ambience ¬†is top notch, the staff were very courteous. We tried quite a few dishes and their stand out dish (which was actually suggested by them) was murgh mussalam. It was lovely. We also ordered Mutton galouti kebab which was way below expectations. Also, tandoori roti were less roti and more of papad. Moreover, we took fish ajwaini tikka (i cant remember the exact name) which was overdone with ajwain and made eating quite unpleasant which was not at all expected. Apart from that, everything was fine.

An awesome north indian dinner experience..actually I felt the satisfaction of a fine dining restaurant after a long time..went on a Tuesday night the place was empty being a weekday..the servings were too fast..the quantity was good..the quality of food was perfect..the staff was humble..the place had a classy and posh interiors..

Now coming to the food-
We tried Peshawari kebabs in starters, fruit punch in mocktail, lachha paratha, Pudina paratha, Dal makhani, Jaipuri malai kofta and Vegetables dulhari and finally biryani in main course..
All were up to the mark actually a perfect north Indian taste and tadka..
Special Mention - vegetables dulhari is superbly amazing..a perfect blend of many vegetables..!!
Malai kofta was even lipsmacking..
Fruit punch was actually a punch of fresh fruits inside our mouth..
All the food are so special and well prepared and well served..
This place is highly recommended for the north Indian food lovers..!!

Located conveniently just at the junction of Rashbehari and Southern Avenue, we entered the restaurant at around 1 in the afternoon on a Sunday. The decor and ambience was very nice. The staff were courteous and eager to help and take our feedback. We ordered
1. Murgh banjara- kebab deliciously prepared
2. Wrap black pepper chicken- a good dish though there js scope of improvement here
3. Pan fried lamb with red wine sauce- A dish that left us wanting for more
4. Nizami and Hyderabadi dum biryani- Both the dishes had distinct flavours and both very deliciously prepared
5. Murgh musallam- a must have dish...simply superb
6. Masala kulcha- yummm
And all this for Rs2100....
The place is extremely pocket friendly with very good food quality and ambience.
A must visit for everyone@dishabhattacharya

We visited this place to celebrate our mother's birthday and were quite happy with their foods and service. We even got a brownie from the restaurant for celebrating the birthday. 

I am deducting 1 point for the waiting time. The restaurant was not that filled up but the waiting time for foods was on a higher side. We received our appetizers after we have completed our soup and almost waited for 20 minutes.

Located just in the beginning of southern avenue (rashbehari side).
When we entered no other visitors were there.
So we took a sit as per our choice. 
The ambience is totally mind blowing as well as the food.
We ordered Murgh Banjara(Succulent chicken breast marinated in Lemon juice, besan & yogurt cooked in tandoor), Murgh Hara Pyaaz(Chicken in delicious chef's spices & spring onion), tandoori rotis and virgin mojitos. I especially liked the Murgh hara pyaaz. Virgin mojito also tastes good.

This restaurant is a hidden gem of the city of joy. The food, the ambience and the pocket pinch is like all the USP I can think of for this one hell of a superstar of an restaurant. The staff especially the owner are really courteous and friendly. I have never experienced such hospitality from any restaurant owner and their staff. 
Now coming to the food. 
I along with my friend tried mughlai cuisine and it was "nawabi"  to the fullest.  For starters we had ajwani machhi which was succulent and tasty. For main course we tried the murg bagmati with mohini naan and both of the dishes lived up to its name's reputation.  The murg was surely bagmati and was succulent with herbs and the naan was sure to sway you of your feet like it's sexy name of mohini. Dessert as badam firni is a brilliant choice. 
Overall this restaurant, it's food and ambience which surely will be remembered by me for a long time and all this for a meagre 1000 bucks.

THE PALMS: Simply Flawless

Introduction:
Gone are the days when you would have to think twice about where you would get different cuisines in one roof. And even if you get, its difficult to love all the cuisines in the same place. But, here is a place where you would just love everything whatever you order. Yeah, this was my experience when I went to this lovely place. The Palms is one of those places which defines the word "flawless" and makes you awe with its food, ambiance and hospitality.

Location: 
Located in Southern Avenue. This place is not a difficult place to find. You find this place as you go towards Southern Avenue from Kalighat Metro Station. Just 

Ambience:
Well, ambience and decor is something which is top class here. The place looks posh and classy. As you enter the place you would be mesmerised by seeing the decor. I loved the bright lightings here, which is different from other places as the trend is dim lighting. The sitting area is nice and cozy, making you comfortable right from the beginning.

Service: As i said there is "flawless" factor here, the same goes with the service too. The service was great. The staffs are polite, well behaved and did their job perfectly. They had a very good knowledge about each and every item they were serving. The staffs were attentive and were keen to help whenever we required anything.

Food: There were some great dishes which we had. These are the following:

Drinks:
#Heaven's Calling: The first drink was just outstanding to start with. Looked great.

#Pineapple Blossom: It tasted different with chocolate in it. But somehow I liked it.

#Strawberry Blossom: I do not like much of strawberry so it was just okay for me.

#Fruit Punch: Thick and yummy. I love thick shakes and it was just that. The best of the lot.


Soups:
#Chicken Sweet Corn Soup: It was more on the sweeter side and tasted decent. 

Kebab:
#Naram Dil : The name was as good as the taste. The crispiness in the exterior and soft cottage cheese inside felt just amazing inside the mouth.

#Kumbh Galawati: If you are a mushroom lover, you would just love it. The spicy flavour was going well. The presentation was again top notch.

Main Course:

#Murgh Bagmati: Rich, spicy and just something you would crave for as a Indian Cuisine Lover.

#Gosht Roganjosh: Just Wow, I was drooling when it came on the table. The aroma was just heavenly and did half the job.

#Fish Amritsari: Well, soft and juicy. The fish again was again on the top bracket. I couldn't find any error which I was trying hard.

#Kumbh Bori Biryani: The Biryani was spicy and had a great aroma. It was different but it tasted fab.

#Mohini Naan: The name excited me first. It kept me guessing what will it be. But as I had my first bite all the focus was just on the food. It was something very new for me and its just too good. A definite thing to try. 

Desserts:
#Date Pancake with Vanilla Ice Cream: Well you need a good ending after a great meal. And it just did that. The pancake was crisp and had the right amount of sweetness and was going really well with the vanilla ice cream.

#Firni: You do not need much description about this item. It was just the perfect ending with the firni.

Last Words: 
The place is just as good as it can be. The best thing about this place is the owner who is just too good with her work. She is very passionate about everything in her restaurant and is the key person to make this place flawless. A definite recommendation from my side. A place where you would love to visit again and again.

So disappointing to know that a restaurant with such pomp and show and having listed copies items from the Mughal cuisine family, this restaurant does not have halal chicken/mutton. I had to order Tandoori Lobster and Lehsuni Jheenga, which to my sheer disappointment were indescribably not good. Alas, A restaurant just with a name!!!

The Palms and I have a long association. This beautiful restaurant, located in the Posh localities of Southern Avenue, is an Architectural marvel. From the Gaint stairway, stone walls, magnificent ceilings, to the water fountain at the center of the hall, the beautiful and cosy white themed custom made sofas, everything about this place spells Delightful!

The phrase and the restaurant‚Äôs name in this instant case, ‚ÄúThe Palms‚Äù, will bring about thoughts of luxury, often depicted in resort chains along coastlines and other such lavish inns with posh interiors and relaxing amenities. The Southern Avenue region has its own Palms in the form of a chic looking restaurant serving Asian and European cuisines alongside superfluity and calmness.

You can get to this eatery by getting down at Kalighat metro station and talking a 2 minute walk towards Southern Avenue and Rashbehari crossing. The restaurant is on the first floor of the building it is situated in, so keep your eyes open if you don‚Äôt wanna miss it. We had been invited here for dinner on the occasion of a Blogger‚Äôs Meet organised by Shahbaaz Zaman in co-ordination with the owner, Priyadarshini Dey, who was a delightful host and accompanied us during the entire event.

Right after you stepped inside a place, if you see a staircase decorated with LED welcoming to walk your way to stardom, don't you think it will create an immediate effect on you to make you feel honoured and high in life??!!!!

Exactly that's the vibe you will receive once you step inside "The Palms", located right beside the "Cafe Coffee Day" at Southern avenue, bang opposite to "Power FM" office.
After walking up the stairs, when you enter the main hall, you'll discover a place which is no way different than a marvellous palace, glowing with all of its shine. Yes, that's the way the interior is decorated with an exclusively fine taste of aesthetics, which is sure make you feel royal, and mesmerize you with the mellifluous vibes of a melodious charm.
To add upon, the awesome hospitality by the owner, Miss Priyadarshini, is something that is definitely worth appreciating. The way she handles the entire operations along with her team, and the way she treats her guest, is worth learning. 
Coming to food, each and every dish is just a heavenly treat for your taste buds.
Every time you have a sip, or take a bite, you can feel some beautiful notes rolling down your taste buds leaving you utterly delighted. The mocktails, the starters, the main course, and specially the desserts, each and every dish is crafted with care and love to create a magic on your tongue.
Should recommend this place as a heavenly bliss for all the foodies out there. 

Thanks a lot to

The name " The Palms" spelled royalty i imagined a place fit for royals . From the moment i entered i indeed felt "special". The moment you enter this place you feel classy, the place is Beaitifully doneup and the decor is something befitting the tag " a place for fine dining"
As starters thete were 
Sweet corn chicken soup- a thick soup rich in chicken and corn.
Tomato dhaniya Shorba- I absolutely loved the soup, the texture was rich and cream and the taste was balance between something tangy and sweet. This will absolutely lift your mood..
Kebaabs
Naram dil-This was a vegetarian kebab which had a coating of oats and the inside filling comprised of mased paneer and green chillies. 
Khumb Galawti- The vegetarian cousin of the famous Galawti kabab, this dish was really innovative. The soft kabab was served on tiny rotis which was really a departure from mundane
Appetizer
Crispy Lamb with raw mango- the lamb is dried and cut into small strips and pan fried with raw mango.
Steamed black pepper chicken- This dish surely made me crave for more. There were chuncks of chicken steamed in black pepper and minutely sliced veggies. I will surely go back for more very soon!!
Entrees (veg)
Maharaja Kofta- Two huge chucks of beautiful kofta served in a thick gravy. A delightful dish indeed.
Paneer Karachi- Chunks of cottage cheese in rich gravy that goes perfectly with Indian bread.
Dal Bukhara- Tasty daal prepared in an innovative way to compliment with naan
Entrees(Non-Veg)
Murg Bagmati- tenderly cooked chicken in a green gravy. A mouth watering dish indeed.
Ghost Roganjosh-The quintessential  popular mutton dish prepared with mch care, consisting of tender and soft mutton chuck. I so loved this dish!
Fish Amritsari -Fish chucks in thick rich gravy which is completely Yummilicious.
Rice
Kumb bori Biriyani-I found this dish ainnovative as instead of the common begetarian biriyani they have infused small chucks of Khumb that elevated the dish to another level.
The non veg gosht biriyani is all delicious!!
Bread
Mohini Naan - i must say that this is the first time i tasted a naan which had beaten egg and spring onion, a perfect eg of fusion food that tasted delicious.
Cheese garlic naan- the smell of garlic and the softness infused by cheese was a revelation!!
Desserts
Date pancake with vanilla ice cream- A departure from the common desserts  this was  light and was a befitting dish to conclude a delightful filling dinner.
Firni- A must try!
There are numerous mocktails to quench yr thirst with-
Heaven's Calling(a comcoction of sprite, lime juice, khus syrup); Cindrella( mixture of vanilla ice cream, pineapple juice, sugar syrup); Depp Sea(blend of khus syrup, jaljeera, rock salt, chaat masala and sprite); Strawberry bloosm ; Fruit Punch
All in all "The Palms" will elevate yr fine dining experience to a new level. There are a no. of innovative dishes to try and taste, and the service , the decor and the warmth of the hostess absolutely compliments the lipsmacking food served.

I was delighted to visit this place for dinner along with my blogger friends to this popular restaurant. It is quite commendable how "The Palms" has seen such heights of popularity in such a short time. The owner, Priyadarshini is a delight to talk to. She is involved in all stages of the restaurant - from the presentation to thinking the names of the dishes to kitchen handling to supervising the kitchen to ordering the crockery...she's doing it all. Her strength is her staff who swears by her goodness. This place is her baby, and she gives it all to see it standing so proud! 

"The Palms" the name itself transports you to an imagery of palm trees, water, relaxation, and good food! The nameplate can be read from across the street and is done up in green. It is situated on the first floor of the building. Conveniently located, parking also should not be a problem.

Nicely lit staircase leads you to the dining area, the interior is done up beautifully! Such intricate designs, color combinations, fountains, statues, a separate office area. The ambiance is extremely relaxing, the lights add on to the soothing nature of the place.

Much about the place, let's get to the food. Short, crisp menu printed on colorful paper sheets brought out the smile across our faces!

I settled for a pink menu and this is what we were served.

**Mocktails**

1. Heaven's calling: The name might set you thinking but the drink will not. It is a concoct of Sprite, Khus Khus syrup, lime juice, and crushed ice. tasted really nice.

2. Deep Sea: Comprised lime juice, crushed ice, grenadine syrup, rock salt, sprite. The rim of the glass was spiked with black salt and chaat masala. This tasted quite different and acts good as a drink one would order with Indian dishes.

3. Cinderella: The name itself got my interest and I waited with bated breathe for this drink. The drink had lime juice, crushed ice, pineapple juice, orange juice, sprite, and grenadine syrup. It was an okay drink for me.

4. Pineapple Blossom has the usual pineapple juice, some ice and the glass bottom was designed with chocolate syrup.

5. Strawberry blossom was in the same category just that the beautiful pink color was lovely to look at, and the strawberry crush added to the taste.

6. Fruit Punch is a mixture of pineapple and orange juice, mixed with crushed ice, vanilla ice-cream, and strawberry crush.

Best thing about the drinks, they were all different from each other. The quantity was perfect, the presentation was taken care of, and the drink tasted like drinks and not ice water which most restaurants serve!

Our food session started with some soup; chicken sweet corn soup for us, and tomao dhania shorba for the vegetarians. Nothing much to add, they were served nicely and tasted good.

**Starters**

1. Naram Dil (loved the name): A paneer mashed starter filled with veggies and coated with cornflakes, deep fried. Inspite of its fried nature, it still melts in your mouth. This was accompanied with some mint chutney.

2. Khumb Galawati: You eat this and do not miss your meat! It is difficult to believe that a beautiful galawati can be created out of a vegetarian item and not minced meat! Kudos to the chef and the team of The Palms.

3. Crispy Lamb with Raw Mango: The concept is so different. They store and dry the lamb till it gets hard. Then fry till crispy. It is crispy but not hard. It is so unique, and such thin cuts. A lot of thought has gone into this starter.

4. Steamed Black Pepper Chicken: The dish was presented in a bamboo basket. The chicken was steamed to perfection. The chicken juice mixed with the vegetables and the pepper added to the taste. It was so good that we were left wanting for more!!

**Main Course**

1. Vegetable Dulhari: A very simple gravy of vegetables cooked in aromatic spices. Tasted good with the naan.

2. Maharaja Kofta: Koftas could be so interesting, who knew!! They looked like pretty flowers submerged in array of colors. They had 2-3 layering and the taste together was beautiful. It melts in your mouth yet you chew it to get the distinct tastes.

3. Paneer Karachi was a paneer based red gravy. Subtle taste, could be eaten with rice or bread.

4. Dal Bukhara was nothing out of the box, the usual dal preparation.

5. Murgh Bagmati was a chicken based green gravy. High on spices and taste quotient. I would love to order this and eat it standalone without any bread.

6. Gosht Roganjosh was so so light. The mutton pieces were sized perfectly and so succulent. The meat was cooked to perfection such that the minute you to try to take the meat out it comes off easily yet not overcooked. Recommended.

7. Fish Amritsari: When a restaurant uses fresh and top class quality products, you know it immediately! The fish was extremely fresh and of good quality. No fishy smell, no over burnt skin. The fish was cooked to the extent where it is neither too soft nor too hard. 

8. Khumb Bori Biriyani for the vegetarians, I tried a spoonful because I was too full by then.

9. Hyderabadi Dum Biriyani: This is where I had to dig in with my hands. The biriyani was so, so good. Aromatic, soft mutton pieces, perfectly cooked rice, not spicy! I asked for a second helpful.. :)

10. Mohini Naan: The name creates this interest. Name credit, the owner! It is a regular bread with add ons, egg and spring onions. The appearance is lovely and green. You need to eat it the minute it reaches your table else it gets chewy and the entire purpose is lost!

11. Cheese Garlic Naan: I really liked the naan, nice garlic flavor with mouthful of cheese. Soft and perfectly blended with the gravy dishes.

**Desserts**

1. Date Pancakes with Vanilla Ice Cream: The date pancakes were on the crispier side but tasted good with ice cream.

2. Phirni: An age old dessert served with Indian dishes. Tasted really good.

The restaurant owner proudly proclaims they score higher on their vegetarian offerings. Such is their popularity that non-vegetarians throng her restaurant to try vegetarian dishes! It was a lovely evening and a new addition to my list, a restaurant which offers excellent oriental and Indian cuisine! Here's wishing them great glorious years and much success..!

Once you enter the place, it will start surprising you from the staircase itself.. the LED studded staircase is itself a warm welcome..!!
When you enter the dinning place, you will have no other option rather than admiring the beauty of the place.¬†
In short.. very elegant place to be with you family and friends (if they are able to sacrifice their craving towards alcohol, as the place doesn't serve alcohol till date).
The quality of the food they serve is amazing, I had no complains with the food.
I found the dessert options to be very limited.
You are ought to admire the ambiance, the behavior of the staffs and the choice of music..!!

Try it once at least.. you will love it for sure..!!

This place was on my wishlist as i heard about this new place a lot ....It is located at the Southern Avenue near Kalighat Metro Station,an walking distance from there...
‚Ä¢Ambience-This place should get a 10/10 for its wonderful decor and a peaceful romantic environment.
‚Ä¢Staffs-They are extremely cordial and always ready to help you.I will have to mention the owner for her friendly behaviour and her excellent advise for choosing food.
‚Ä¢FOOD-This is something people remembers at the end of the day..Today we decided to satiate our taste buds with awadhi delicacies.So we ordered for -
¬∞Sikandari Raan-This was really mouth-smacking..tender drumsticks in a thick sweetish gravy...
¬∞Khumb Bori Biriyani-This is really different 
from the usual biriyani you get in Kolkata..paneer stuffed mushrooms are mouth watering...u get a delicious rayta with it.
¬∞Makgani Roti-I didn't find it very tasty or unusual.So this was average..
We also got two complementary papads..
So all I can say give it a try..

In one word it was fantastic!! Very well decorated. Ambience was very soothing. Behaviour of all the staffs were overwhelming. We ordered nizami biriyani,chicken lahori,tandoori roti. Quantity and quality of each item was up to the mark. At the beginning mahi kolivara was just out of the world!!it was yumm. At last we ordered sizzling brownie with hot chocolate and chocolate ice cream with dry fruits. Both were satisfactory. The staffs were very attentive and they took care of us really well. It is near the tollygunge police station. Overall a very well experience.

If you walk from the main rashbehari crossing towards southern avenue, then this place is just a few minutes walk on your left. The decor is very beautiful and aesthetic with a lot of indoor plants, even a miniature fountain. For starters, we were served wrap black pepper chicken and murgh banjara, both deliciously prepared. Our main course consisted of long bean fried rice with egg yolk, spicy fried rice with taro and spring onion, phad thai noodles, pan fried sliced lamb in red wine sauce, spicy lan ching chicken claypot and chicken teriyaki with baby corn. Each of the dishes had generous helpings and tasted great, especially the pan fried lamb, which was so good that we had to order it a second time! However, most of the desserts in their menu were not available...which was utterly disappointing! We were presented with only 3 options! Pricewise, the place is not too costly..a meal for six cost around 3000 rupees, which is more than reasonable. Also the staff are very polite and helpful and service is efficient. Love to drop by again soon!

Kebab festival is on at the new south kolkata food station "The Plams". The restaurant has a great ambience with a very well mannered staffs..now the main part of the story, THE FOOD..i personally like mutton boti kebab from the list..we had mahi ajwani, tengri kebab, chicken banjara, mutton boti kebab.. The portions r good, but it lacks the WOW taste that my tastebuds r looking for.. Tengri kebab should be more spicy and we'll cooked, mahi ajwani was ok nothing out of this world sort of..Quantity can never overpower the quality..So next time i wish to have a great food from The team Palms.

We were invited by Zomato (after a long time) to this rather recently opened restaurant on Southern Avenue, which serves Asian and Indian cuisines. It is conveniently situated close to the Russa Rd - Southern Avenue Crossing, where Funjabi Tadka was.

The interiors are bright and elegant, not at all loud. The wall textures are rather nicely done. ¬†The layout is roomy, with tables well spaced out.

Started out with a reasonably well made Fresh Lime Soda. I opted for the rather nice Prawn Tomyam Soup with Noodle. Then came the Mixed Salad with Lotus Roots and Prawns with Beansprout Salad.

The non-veg starters comprised of Suan La Crispy Lamb with Raw Mango (nice and tangy), Japanese Style Double Fried Chicken and Crispy Chilli Squid with Oat Flakes. ¬†Each one was good enough for second helpings!

The main course saw us enjoy Steamed Fish with Blackbean Sauce, Braised Pork Belly with Pakchoi and Pan Fried Sliced Lamb in Red Wine Sauce. These were accompanied with Spicy Fried Rice With Shitake Mushroom & Spring Onion and Seafood Oriental Noodles. I was way too full to try the noodles or the rice, but what I (and most of us) really loved was the Pork! It was soft, delicious and full of awesomeness, that only pork can be.

We ended with two desserts - Date Pancake with Vanila Icecream and Banana Toffee with Plum Sauce. They were both just desserts, nothing exceptional.

Our companion during this immensely elaborate and satisfying meal was Priyadarshini, the owner, who spoke with us about her vision and plans, and impressed upon us that they use the freshest ingredients, best practices and always looking for new idea.

Thank you The Palms and thank you Zomato.

Although I have been to this restaurant before, I specially wanted to visit during the Kebab Festival. I find the ambiance of the restaurant very pleasant and I feel that the decor has a and calming and soothing effect which puts the guests at ease from the time they step into the place. Although the restaurant was pretty crowded, the service was fast and the food was absolutely excellent.I specially liked the ¬†Galouti Kebab, which was as good (or maybe even better) than the ones I had in Tunday's in Lucknow. Absolutely recommend the restaurant for food, ambiance and the wholly satisfying ¬†experience of fine dining.

Loved the decor, the ambience, and above all service. 
Talking about the food starters were very good and the main course was mouth watering...  Really happy with the place would love to visit again in future. 
Only reason to give a 4.5 is because the bar option is absent.üòÄ

Visiting this place was not a part of any plan...we happened to break into this place...the ambience is beautiful hence its popularity in romantic dining...the presentation of the food items is quite good and the treatment of their staff is impressive but the food is very average...
we had tom yum soup which was good,double fried chicken in japanese style  which was very bland...we took flat thai noodles which tasted too sweet and average,spicy lan chicken which was okay to taste...for desserts we had sizzling brownie which was not that much of a dissapointment afterall....hope to see improvements in my next visit

The Palms, when we hear this name, an image of a beach comes to our mind. But this restaurant is located in a awesome location of South Kolkata, very near to RashBehari Avenue Crossing, just in the opposite road of Tollygunge Police Station, above CCD. I went there for the Kebab Festival. When I reached there and stand in front of the restaurant, the initial impression was nice seeing the outer looks. But when the welcome door is opened, a psychedelic staircase welcomes you, which gives you a magical feeling. Once you enter the restaurant, you see a small fountain and the staffs welcomes you with a smile and offers you to take your favourite seat. I choose a seat which was near the window so that I can enjoy both the indoor and outdoor view. The decoration of the overall restaurant is really nice. As I said before, I went for the Kebab Festival, I can only give my opinion regarding that. More than 40+ types of kebab were being offered with two pieces of each, as many times you want with a complimentary welcome drink. The ambiance and environment was really nice, the staff are really well behaved with a smile on their face always but the serving time is a bit long. Though we ordered kebab (which usually takes time to get cooked), still I think, it could have been served a little faster than it was served to me. Well coming to the food now, each and every kebab item that I took (on my own choice or as suggested by them) were really awesome, well cooked, great taste, well decorated and presented, just melts in the mouth. I ordered for butter nun as well to have along with the kebabs and that was also very nice. The most important thing which I liked the most was the owner, Priyadarshini's gesture. She herself came to our table and enquired personally whether we are liking the food or not and is everything okay or not. While waiting for my order, I was going through the menu card and found that the price of all other items available there are moderate and not on the higher side, which is really a plus point according to me, for the location it is situated. Would love to visit The palms once again, to taste the other items offered by them as well.

We are extremely disappointed by unprofessional behavior and bait-and-switch tactics of this restaurant. They had advertised for a buffet featuring kebabs at Rs550/- per head. 

On 7-June, I had called the cell number displayed on their profile and the owner Priyadarshini spoke to me and accepted a booking for 2 people for 8th June 8:30PM.

However on reaching there we were told that the buffet was no longer being offered and asked to order from the ala carte menu instead, even though

the advertisement standee for the kebab buffet was still proudly on display outside their entrance. They were apparently using this offer to lure customers through their gates.

When we called the same number via which we had made the booking, we were told that it no longer belonged to Priyadarshini and that we had reached the wrong person.

Dining out with family has become a rare affair nowadays with most places opting to get a younger crowd on board. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the ambiance and food being served at ¬†The Palms Restaurant. ¬†The tandoori aaloo they served had a delicious filling while the mutton seekh kebab left us wanting for more. What I liked best about the place is they have only two types of cuisine they have so many options within the two that it actually leaves one flabbergasted.

The rotis are crisp and the kumbh galawati kebab was something that I had never tried before! They have some great main courses!

Definitely worth another visit.

Have vouched will never visit this place again@

Back in town after a long time, I recently visited The Palms Restaurant after a friend recommended the new eatery. Always skeptical of trying something new, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I actually liked the place! The food was tasty, the mock-tails refreshing ¬†and the fact that it serves both¬†Indian and Oriental just made my daughter's day!
We ordered for the Chicken malai kebab and the twice fried Japanese style chicken for starters (just wanted to see if they have equal finesse in both) and boy they delivered! Succulent non spicy cream based chicken in the kebab were delicious while the Japanese style chicken was well balanced and tasted beautiful!
The main course too was tasty, while we did not order much, we genuinely loved the Emperor Seafood Fried Rice ¬†and Pan fried sliced Lamb in red wine sauce on the side!

Totally worth a couple of more visits!

Horrible service. Would not recommend anyone to be here, even if they are serving food free of cost. Ordered for a platter of veg kebab, and within the platter of veg kebab, there was even CHICKEN RESHMI KEBAB. such a kind of service is not at expected from a restaurant. Kindly be sure before stepping in.. And after updating such a review , the manager of the restaurant came down to the table and requested to remove the review that i updated. Never had such an great experience at any other restaurant ever

The Palms is located on Southern Avenue and its been on my go to list for a while ..... I am glad I finally was able to visit because I had a really nice meal. Very nice contemporary and tasteful decor and good service were added pluses to the yummy meal we had. They have two separate menus for Oriental and Indian Cuisine and I was torn between the two so decided to have a mix of both. From the Oriental Section we ordered Chicken Spring Rolls , Seafood Dimsum , Crispy Chicken with Raw Mango , Schezwan Peppercorn Chicken and Fried Rice. All our dishes were good but I loved the Crispy Chicken with Raw Mango as well as the Schezwan Peppercorn Chicken. Looking forward to exploring more oriental selections on my next visit.¬†
For the Indian Section we ordered Reshmi Kebab which was delightfully different as it was coated with egg , Mixed Kebab Platter so we could taste more kebabs , Fish Tikka which was really good and appreciated by all of us. The showstopper however was the Khumb Galawati Kebabs which were amazing and even though I am a hard core non-vegetarian it stole my heart. Our mains were Kali Dal , Murgh Mussallam and the Maharaja Kofta with an assortment of Roti's. The Kofta and Mussallam were very good. We were too stuffed for dessert but I will surely visit this place often and keep room for dessert on my next visit .... I want to sample the Firni.

I've been to palms twice and on both occasions I've had some yummy food.  The first visit was purely oriental.  The crispy chicken with raw mango stole the show,  I love the lamb in red wine and the fish in black bean.  The stir fried green beans were delicious  too.  The do need to work a bit on the tempura batter.  It's decent but nothing worth raving about.  

The second trip was Indian.  

Highlights :
Stunning kebabs.  The Rashmi kebab comes enveloped in a egg blanket with to me was the show stopper.  The fish kebabs were stunning very different from a mundane tikka or ajwaini.  But to my surprise  the mushroom galaoti was brilliant.  Velvety,  light and very delicate  flavor balance.  

One must try the maharaja kofta,  very different from a regular  malai kofta and excellent  portion sizes.  

The downs :

The dal makahni...  Not to my taste,  am a makahni snob and this to me was more of a tadka.  

The need to work on presentation  such delicious food needs to look pretty as well. 


The place is spacious,  very neat n clean and the food is worth every bit..  Do try.  

Cheers.

I was rather interested in the Indian segment of the menu, and as it was a hot summer‚Äôs day, we decided to pick out some of the signature dishes from the menu. Between the three of us, we picked a few, and while S wanted the Kasundi Mahi, with flaky fish and a rather strong hit of mustard (which I felt overpowered the fish), the chef sent over a lovely chicken kabab he had whipped up in the kitchen, covered with a fluffy egg omelette, with cubes of soft chicken inside.
¬†The Veg Seekh Kabab was, for me, a rather simple, yet perfectly executed dish, with a crust which held on its shape until it was consumed, and then, the kabab would simply disintegrate in your mouth, revealing the nubbins of peas, carrots, and other assorted vegetables within. A great way to start off a meal!
                                                                ...

Right from ascending the stairs one can start expecting something grand..but I am a bit disappointed....the steward ,Biswanath catered all our needs and his behaviour needs special mention...inspite of the best efforts of the staffs the food failed to impress me...we ordred sultani irani and I was utterly surprised....the meat was very stiff...they replaced it though....prawn tempora made our afternoon wonderful...those were just mind blowing....the thai green chicken was again disappointing...the brownie served in sizzler style was something new and enjoyable... according to me ,the pages should have a better knowledge of the dishes ,so that they can guide the people....the ambience was fantastic and also the hospitality....but the value for money was not as it was thought...it is a mixture of good and bad....

Amazing ambience first of all...very classy.. We ordered Mahi ajwani and Dehleez for starters... The fish practically melted in our mouths.. It was extremely soft,  I felt the flavour of ajwain could have been stronger otherwise marvellous... Dehleez was the most amazing dish I've had in a long time.... Just wow.. The butter naans were good and so was  Kandhari gost... But I didn't like Murgh kalimirich as much as the others--it had a bland sort of taste...
The staffs' behavior was extremely prompt abd polite... All in all an amazing experience.. Awesome.. Keep up the good work!!

‚ÄòMAGNIFICENT‚Äô ‚Äì The only adjective that does justice to this place. ‚ÄòThe Palms‚Äô stands imposingly on Southern Avenue, near rashbehari more. 

‚ÄòThe Palms‚Äô, which gets its name from the one of the renowned hotels of Digha, ‚ÄòThe Palms Resort‚Äô, is located on the first floor; and as I entered, a dramatically lit staircase invited me. After walking up, I walked into the restaurant arena and was awestruck by its lavishness. The owner, Pridarshini Dey, is a woman of many talents; apart from being a gracious host, a wonderful person and one of the youngest successful restaurant owners in the city, she is also a marvelous interior designer. The elaborate and sumptuous interiors are all her creations. The moment I entered, my eyes were greeted with a gorgeous looking mini-fountain. A small white marble fountain upon a bed of pebbles, encircled by small plants, with a background of a black colored stone chipped wall, is awe-inspiring. Each of the walls is intricately and painstakingly done and looks ravishing. An elaborately ornamented false ceiling with modernized lighting gives the place a subtle and yet sophisticated glamor. The sitting area can accommodate about 70 odd people; it‚Äôs spacious and well-organized with white and black colored luxurious and comfortable sofas, white table cloth with blue or red colored cloth added for decoration. Everything about this place is grand, luxurious, magnificent, and once I started eating, definitely delicious.

After a long time discovered a place with good ambience plus food.
Lets begin this with no valet parking with this one, roads longside are empty parking can me found.
A perfect family restro with good ambience perfect seating arrangements though its a small one in terms of seating but decent.
Food is good, the tikkas and starters i tried really amazing with spice and cooking and temperature all going fine and right.
Its has cuisine which is chinese and indian.
Menu is exciting fresh new items with indian flavour and chinese.
It has good items in mutton which are new and worth to give a try.
Pricing is good its not on a expensive side . 
Quantity of the food is quite good.
I got 8 pieces of tikka and i dont remember any other restro which offers 8 pieces. 
Gravy items were also good in quantity & taste.
So final verdict a great family restro or friends party area with delicious food and pleasant ambience.
Recommended by me should try it...

to the management.¬†

I was thinking about planning a birthday surprise for my girlfriend, where we would be having lunch or dinner in your restaurant, and after the meal, a birthday cake would be brought to the table by the attendant with a lighted candle. I would be providing the cake myself if you have no such option. would that be possible???

We had the Indian fare - kebab platter, a chicken biriyani &  mutton entree - with mixed results. The kebabs all tasted pretty much the same, the biriyani was quite good and the mutton was tasty but tough. Overall, the food is not of the quality suggested by its Zomato rating or, for that matter, its well-appointed interiors.  Service is very slow but the staff are courteous.  Using a Zomato-gifted coupon cushioned the pocket pinch. Not sure whether the meal would have been worth the billed amount without the coupon.

I was privileged enough to be invited for a zomato foodies meet up ( after a long time!) for lunch at this particular venue. Located conveniently right at the mouth of Southern Avenue in the floor above the ccd outlet this place is very neatly and intelligently done. The soothing colors,the spacious interiors,the comfortable sofas and the water fountain inside give this place a classy fine dining kinda feel.

I started off with the prawn tom yum soup with noodles. It was one of the more authentic versions of the tom yum soup i have had. It was just a tad too sour for my liking.

For salads,we had the prawn with bean sprout salad and the mixed veg salad with lotus root. Both of these very fresh and refreshing. I liked how the prawns were kept very uncomplicated with their original flavor and freshness coming through.

Next came the starters one by one.The crispy lamb with raw mango was delightfully tangy.The Japanese style double fried chicken was simple yet one of the stand out dishes of the day. We could tell that the batter was really well done. The exterior was crisp and the inside soft and succulent. The crispy chilly squid with oat flakes was up next. The presentation looked a bit messy but I loved the dish as a whole. The quality of the squid was first class and there was a sweetness about the dish which i really enjoyed. The oat flakes added to the healthy food quotient theme that the owners are trying to implement.

For the veg mains,i had the braised tofu with aubergine and waterchestnut and the Thai green curry. The tofu was well done and the Thai curry nice and fresh and flavorful.

The non veg main course comprised of steamed fish in black bean sauce,braised pork belly with pakchoi and lamb in red wine sauce. The fish was fresh and the lamb was tasty. But the stand out dish was the pork. I am somewhat biassed towards pork generally but this was one of the best pork i have had ( and i have had quite a lot of pork). The pork contained the perfect proportion of lean meat and fat and it was cooked impeccably well. The meat was wonderfully tender and succulent.

For desserts,we had the banana toffee with plum sauce and date pan cake with vanilla ice cream. Compared to the high quality of what preeceded the desserts,i  felt the desserts were a let down. The banana toffee i did not like at all and the date pan cake i felt was slightly overdone.

Apart from the food and the classy ambiance, we met the owners and were impressed by Priyadarshini and her ideals. She was not only a lovely host but I loved the fact that she had a very strong view as to what she wants to do with her restaurant. The management takes a lot of effort in using fresh and authentic ingredients and hiring quality reputed chefs. These efforts were no doubt reflected in the food they served up.

Overall I had a hugely satisfying meal at The Palms and I will surely be back for more. 

Cheers ! :)

An amazing place to dine in... with great food and ambience... the palms has won my heart... 
We tried to mix and match with double fried japanese chicken to start with followed by nizami biriyani & mutton rara. All the items were amazing. 
I will surely be visiting this place again and would rate this place as a promoter to everyone.

An amazing fine diner,,, done up beautifully in pristine colours of ivory nd red,,, The Palms is by far one of the most romantic dining options in Kolkata.... Serving cuisines like North Indian, Chinese, Thai nd Mughlai,,, it attracts a lot of family crowd but with the right table,,, it is ideal for a romantic outing....

Visited this place on a Sunday with family. Very nicely located in Southern Avenue near the metro station. Nicely done interiors with bright lighting. Courteous staff.
So for starters we ordered Royal Hara Bhara Kebab and Veg Tempura. The kebab was excellent. It was served with two chutneys which were very nice. It was really good, a must try. The tempura is a thumbs down, totally avoid it. 
For main course we ordered dal, Veg Kolhapuri and Khumb Nawabi. We ordered an Assorted basket of breads. The peshawari naan, cheese garlic naan, kulcha were all quite good. Overall the food was quite good. One more thing. Really thankful to the manager. They don't have Veg biryani on their menu. But they made it for us. It was really nice. I would request you to add it your menu.

The only reason why I am giving this place a 3.5 below their average of 4 is their service. The staff is courteous and nice, but the service has to be improved. During the main course they forgot to give quarter plates. These are just small examples.

On separate occasions, I have been to The Palms, and the food has been pretty nice every time. A few days ago, I was there for lunch and ordered a few things - the veg Seekh kabab, the Maharaja Kofta and the Peshawari naan were really good, and I had to pack some of it home. I also sampled some of their Oriental fare, and the Malaysian Crispy Chilli¬†Squid, Crispy Lamb, the Vegetable Tempura with a thin and airy batter and the Double fried Japanese Chicken were all really well-made, and I have to say, I would return for these again. Service needs to be worked upon a bit more, but otherwise, a rather nice place to relax.

Had a wonderful dinner at The Palms, located near the Southern Avenue and Rasbehari Avenue junction, while coming straight from Lake Stadium crossing.

Rarely, have I come across such a majestic interior. The leather upholstered sofas, the water fountain, the tables and seating arrangement ‚Äì it was impeccable ! The waiters were very courteous and helpful as well !

What a marvelous effort executed with painfully exquisite attention to details ! Kudos ! !

It was wonderful to see the menu boasting the fact that they only specialize on Indian and Chinese dishes. So, true it turned out to be ! !

We ordered, chicken tandoori and shammi kabab for starters. Tandoori was absolutely well-cooked and not scorched at all, spiced to perfection. But, the real clincher was the Shammi Kabab. I have been fortunate to be served home-made shammi kababs during my stay in Tiljala and believe me it‚Äôs totally different than the ones served by Zeeshan / Arsalan / Shiraz , where these become oil soaked, greasy coarse minced meat tikkas. The Palms served the shammi kabab with that delicate smell of chana dal and mince meat paste lightly sauntered on a tawa. The taste and flavor was exploding in my mouth ! !

For main course, we ordered cheese-garlic naan, Chicken Biryani and Murg Kali Mirch.

Murg kali mirch had a thick gravy with whole black peppers creating the signature flavor and the cheese-garlic naan was soft and full of garlic and cheese cubes.

Biryani had 2 pieces of chicken and was well spiced up.

It is unusual to experience such good food and such a superbly finished d√©cor in South Kolkata.

Overall price : 1650/- was worth every single penny !

Very Good Food ! Yes that's the answer when you come across this place. Beautifully decorated, peaceful ambiance and a proper family restaurant with well behaved staff. This place will surely stay if so marketed well. Its just the place where Funjabi Tadka used to be and the food is really good with lot of options for non- vegetarian. They can surely do more with the place as its big and it shall be also better if they can keep two sections where they can divide it at one to be for the young crowed keeping Hookah n stuff and another for the family section. Anyways coming to the food the lamb is a must try along with the sea food rice.
Just it needs some marketing to flourish well.

Today I went to visit this place in the company of my relatives, who are as Foodie  as I am. 
Before this restaurant came into being, there was another restaurant in its place and I loved it for its ambience, staff behaviour and of course delicious food. I was saddened when it closed down.
When The Palms came up, I was interested but could not make it to come here. Today was the opportunity and I decided to make use of it.
The ambience of the restaurant is much better than Funjabi Tadka. I was blown over by the beautiful and tasteful interior decoration. The sofa sets were soft and comfortable. We took a corner seat overviewing the busy traffic and the green trees without.
The staff were courteous. The door was opened by a middle aged thin gentleman named Alam who gave us such a beautiful welcome smile that for a moment we forgot how much toil we had to undergo just a few minutes ago.
Kushal Pandit, who I believe to be the Manager here, took down our order,  assisted by Alam. They gave us food suggestion according to our preferences and we are quite pleased with the outcome.
For entree, we took naram Dil and tomato shorts for the vegetarians in our group, while for us non veg it was steamed chicken with black pepper. I loved naram Dil. It was crispy without and soft within and tasted great. Tomato shorba also tasted great. The steamed chicken was also a good choice. 
For main course we chose phad Thai noodles with chicken and King Pao chicken. The vegetarians chose a paneer dish - I forgot its name - and butter nun.
The nuns were soft, and the paneer pieces were soft and the curry was sweet but delicious. Phad Thai curry was ok but the chicken pieces were very few. Kung Pao chicken I did not like because it felt a little bland.
The staff were very courteous and helpful. Nice place to have family lunch.

The Palms is a relatively new restaurant located at Southern Avenue (diagonally opposite Tollygunje Police Station). I was invited for a Zomato meet along with fellow foodies to sample their newly launched oriental menu.¬†

Priyadarshini, the owner of the restaurant hosted the Saturday lunch meet up. She took us through her journey in this industry and spoke to everyone about this newly opened restaurant that serves authentic oriental and north Indian dishes. Their menu is devoid of the run of the mill Chinese items that we find at every other eatery.¬†

The interiors are simple yet classy which is done by Priyadarshini herself. The lighting is perfect which is why all the pictures come out really well.¬†

A special 5 course menu was fixed for us to sample which included a soup, salad, starters, ample main course option and a couple of desserts. For drinks I opted for a Virgin Mojito.

We kick started the meal with Chicken dumpling clear soup with spinach and prawn with beansprout salad. The soup tasted okay but the salad tasted refreshingly good.¬†
In starters we were served Crispy lamb with raw mango, Double fried chicken in Japanese style and Crispy Chili Squid with Oat flakes. My favourite out of the three would definitely be the double fried chicken. The crispy chili squid is an interesting item. The quality of squid was top notch and I would not mind having this as a dessert since its on the sweeter side. The lamb preparation was decent but the meat was chewy which was kind of disappointing.¬†

For main course we tried Steamed fish with black bean sauce, Braised pork belly with Pakchoi and Pan fried Sliced lamb in Red wine sauce. The fish was well done, the lamb was decent but the pork simply stole the show. Im not a huge pork fan but one bite into the succulent chunk of pork made me fall in love with it instantly. Perfect blend of spices and sauces and none overpowering the other, this is a must try dish for any pork lover.¬†
The seafood noodles and spicy fried rice were average to taste and paired well with the main course items

There were two kinds of desserts served to us - ¬†Date pancake and banana toffee. However none of them appealed to me and they should work on their dessert menu if these two are the best that they have to offer.¬†

Over all an above average experience with hits and misses. I should be back to try out the other items on the menu especially the North Indian stuff.

The owner has probably got this place cheap from the owner of the restaurant that existed here last. With loads of cash to spend, he has ended up using too many types of tiles and marbles and wall papers and leather on seats and glass and keeping the table on the contrary very low key. Thumbs down to the place for the feel. The ceiling and the walls are overly highlighted which is not required. 

Being a vegetarian, I found the menu to be very unattractive, not many options to choose from. For a foodie you should be spoilt of choices. There isn't any surprise element or interesting. 

No complains for the vegetable and daal but the breads are thick. They either don't serve papads or they ran out of it at 8.30pm in a restaurant with just 3 tables occupied. 

Not recommended!!!

The Palms is situated where the Funjabi Tadka used to be at Southern Avenue. Best way to reach is to take the metro and get down at Kalighat Station, take the tollygunj phari exit and it is a walk of 3 4 minutes thereafter to reach the huge sprawling restaurant situated on the 1st floor. 
The interior inside is marvelous. A huge fountain greets you once you enter the place. Really well lit and spacious. All the pictures come really well thanks to the lightning. :-) the main door has a huge mirror so you can check yourself once in a while eating!
Now coming to the food. I had a huge spread. The night started with mocktails. The best was the strawberry blossom hands down. Made with ice cream and milk nothing could go wrong with it. The deep sea was green in colour and super refreshing. It was a thick mocktail with jaljeera on top and it really went down well with the food that was served. The Cinderella mocktail was suggested by the manager, Mr Shahrukh and it was Wow.  Barring these 2 mocktails I had fruit punch, pink island,pineapple blossom,sweet and Salty fresh lime soda. They all had a weird taste to it as I felt that the lemon that they used was an artificial one which did not go well at all.
Then came the seafood clear soup with prawn dumplings. The soup was light and the prawn dumplings were big in size.
In the Indian starters I tasted the Makhani Karahi which was a spicy chicken starter. I must say beforehand that all the starters were really soft and succulent. The murgh banjara was a chicken kebab with mild flavours. The mahi kolibara was a pomfret kebab. Fresh ingredients and products are used and it reflected on the food. The mahi pahari was another fish kebab made with coriander and mint leaves and it was on a bit sour side, if you love tangy flavours you know what to order. From the oriental section I had the prawn tempura served with 3 types of dips. It was well fried and the best part was that the oil was drained really well. The last starter was the crispy thai chili squid. One word for this. Mind blowing. The squid is coated with oats and the Thai chili gives it a nice flavour to it. It has a sweet flavor and I can have plate after plate of it. 
An assorted bread basket was given which had lacha paratha,cheese naan,garlic naan and keema naan. Soft and hot coated with butter. Need I say more? 
The maharaja kofta was a mix of vegetables and nuts crushed together and cooked in a really nice gravy. The jaipuri malai kofta was a white gravy base cooked with cashew nut paste giving it a rich flavour. 
Coming to the non vegetarian items, the nawabi gosht was as the name says. Nawabi. Soft juicy melt in your mouth mutton pieces. The murgh lahori was also a white gravy based dish. The fish hyderabadi was cooked in a coconut coriander sauce and the fresh fish used took this dish to a whole new level. The last Indian main course was the lehsooni jhinga a.k.a garlic prawn Indian style. If you are a garlic lover like me you will definitely want to order this dish. Lastly came the hyderabadi dum biryani accompanied with raita. The raita and hyderabadi styled biryani for me is a match made in heaven. 
In the oriental section plain rice with thai red curry in chicken was served. One needs to specify the amount of hotness one can have. Mine was perfect to my liking but since taste varies it is advised to inform the chef beforehand. The veg Thai green curry did not go well with me maybe because I had had the chicken one first. The Kung pao chicken was filled with cashew nuts and on the spicy side. The steamed fillet in the black bean sauce as mentioned earlier also was made with fresh fish and with it I had the chicken pot rice with glass noddles. It was really yummy. I have never had a dish like this but I must say everyone should try this when visiting The palms. 
Then came the desserts. Yes I still had space inside me. Dessert always has a different place reserved inside me. Apple toffee was served first. It was apple pieces deep fried in a batter and coated with a honey sauce. The hot and cold gives it a unique flavor. This will be liked by people who love fruits in any form. The sesame tossed honey noodles with vanilla ice cream was basically thin deep fried flour noodles tossed in the honey sauce. Crunchy and delicious. The gajar ka halwa was loaded with almond slivers and the ghee flavour was very clear and it made me very happy that they use good produce and it reflects on the food they serve. Lastly came the the sizzling brownie with ice cream and cherry on top,drizzled with chocolate sauce. I am sure I don't have to describe this dish in detail. 
Our server,Mir Abdul was really nice and catered to all our needs. Thank you Priya for being an amazing host. Keep up the good work. All the best.

Visited this beautifully decorated place yesterday for lunch. It was empty and my friends really got sceptical as it was oir 1st visit.
Anyways, we got seated. Very comfortable sofa seats...beautiful lighting and wall decor.
Coming to the food now. Ordered Peshwari paneer and Makhani karahi in starters and Fresh lime soda. The paneer was soft and quite spicy. I liked the accompanying chutney as well. 
In mains, ordered Tandoori roti and naan with Gost Jalandhari and Maharaja Kofta.
The roti and naan were of high quuality. The mutton was tender and the kasuri metho gravy really complemented the mutton. Now the Maharaj kofta, which was highly recommended by our server, came woth 2 koftas and a gravy. I never tasted a better kofta anywhere. It was really awesome. 
We were so full that we had to skip dessert. 
One last point, our bill was handwritten due to some technical issues and all taxes were exempted. The bill amount was Rs. 1715 which was justified considering the food,service and ambience.
Definitely deserves a 2nd visit and hopefully many more.

Went there on valentines day, it was very nicely decorated. Had candle light dinner. Food was quite good and staff very courteous.
We had murgh banjara in starter and in main course it was murgh peshawari. Only problem was no difference between lachcha paratha and butter naan.

Yesterday, I went for my second Zomato meetup to The Palms, a new restaurant in Southern Avenue that has opened in the same place where Funjabi Tadka used to be. Priyadarshini, the owner was a very gracious hostess and she was there throughout talking to us about the food, the ingredients used, what sets apart her menu from the other oriental restaurants etc. One thing you must keep in mind is that here, you won't get your run of the mill Chinese dishes. If you are planning on ordering Hakka noodles or Chicken Manchurian, Chilly Chicken, Fried Babycorn etc, this is not the place for you.¬†
A special menu was created for Zomato and I started off my meal with a refreshing Prawn with Beansprouts salad. For starters, we had crispy lamb with raw mango, double fried chicken in japanese style and a unique crispy chilly squid with oat flakes. My favorite of the three was the double fried chicken and I specially loved the spicy dip that was served along with it. The crispy chilli oat was loved by everyone but I found it too sweet for my taste. The quality of the squid was excellent though. Not chewy at all and cooked perfectly.
For the mains I had steamed fish with black bean sauce, braised pork belly with pakchoi, pan fried sliced lamb in red wine sauce along with sea food noodles. The lamb was again too sweet for my taste and it was also chewy but they nailed the fish and the pork belly. All of us loved the pork belly so much that we requested for another serving of the dish. If you love pork, do try that dish there.
For dessert, we had date pancake with chocolate icecream and banana toffee with plum sauce and vanilla icecream. ¬†Both were quite nice.

Located on the main street of southern avenue this place was quite impressive to enter with. Though you have to walk to the first floor their d√©cor is pretty good and the place looks pretty posh.

Coming to the food we wanted to have chinese and since they serve both Indian and Chinese we were happy. We ordered soups and starters. Now comes to the point the service is very very slow. It took them like 10 mins to get our soup in place and they served only 1 soup. They said the other soup will take some time. Then one starter came‚Ä¶ then another.. so by the time the last person was having soup (which came last) we were finished with the whole of starters and soup.

The taste of the soup was way to sweet and it had no salt but the 3 treasure mushroom starter was really good and something different which they serve here.

We decided to have indian at this point as we say that all the tables were eating that. It took them like 40 mins to serve indian and in the same the maharaja Kofta was amazing‚Ä¶ it was very tasty and the way they served it.. it lloked very pretty as well‚Ä¶ the dal is OK OK nothing great to talk about but then in indian food people normally rate the food based on the daal. But it was nothing above average. The people there are friendly and nice and they were talking properly and knoew their menu as well. They even served us a roti when they were almost closing which was great.

Coming to the prices I found this place to be slightly over priced as there are better options at the same or cheaper price in Kolkata today. 

Overall I guess this place is a 1 time try and it was a fun experience as they are in no hurry to serve food if you are in hurry to eat and can gossip for some time.

I was invited by a couple of friends. We ordered murg banjara kebab as starter.. Pieces were large, soft and aromatic. ... Maharani kofta was tasted good. Murg kalimirch was average . Veg pulao was ordinary. I couldn't locate any special USP of this place. The tables were placed in a straight line which I thought made it cramped. When you get the menu,you get everything .. Indian Chinese Thai etc etc.. I get confused.¬†
What I liked most is the well behaved staff.. The bill came to about Rs1200 which I thought is about 20% higher than the mental price which one would have considering the overall experience. It's conveniently located and would probably visit again..

Had a fantastic experience here. It's very easy to locate this restaurant. The decoration, the ambience was really nice. Perfect place to go on a date and the fluent romantic music adds an extra romantic flavour to the ambience. Food is very tasty and also good in quantity. Service was fast and fantastic, the waiters were very attentive and nice. Really had a magnificent lunch. There are very few restaurants in Kolkata where I had experienced this kind of service.

Absolutely wonderful place to dine in! Courtesy of staff, decoration & ambiance all deserves special mentions! We tried Hyderabadi biriyani and Galawti kabab! The biriyani was delicious and certainly one of the best in the town!! I just felt the kabab was a bit more dry!! The chairs are really comfortable! A nice place to visit!

The family and I landed up for dinner last night to the place which previously housed funjabi tadka , a very popular establishment in southern avenue. We loved the food in the last restaurant so much that we are guilty of asking the servers several time if the restaurant had the same owners or atleast had the same kitchen staff. However we were very pleasantly surprised with the food on offer which was well presented and delicious. To start with we had the kebab platter which was enough for the four of us. A special mention for the fish kebabs in the platter, which I admit are the best fish kebabs I have had in a very long time. As a vegetarian option we tried the dahi ke kebab made from hung curd which was really good.
For the main we ordered a bread basket , murg Peshawari and a chef's special fish. Bread basket has an excellent assortment of misi roti, garlic cheese naan etc and each one of them was surprisingly good. The fish was a recommendation from the ma√Ætre d' and was so incredible that we ate more that we should have. The Peshawari murg has a beautiful rich sauce which is smooth and creamy. Only let down is that the spices hadn't been absorbed by the meat well enough.
I rate this restaurant a 4 only on their food. For the ambiance and decor I should mark it at a 3.5. It does not cut it as a fine dining restaurant as it lacks some finishing touches. Firstly to have wash basins right next to tables is a strict no no. I don't want to see people washing their hands when I am still eating my food! This is a quick fix , just put up a opaque glass partition to separate the basin and WC entrance from the diners.
Secondly the sofas are incredibly comfortable but the seats need to be firmer. I am 5'7 and I was sinking into the cushions so much that the table was almost upto my neck! This is not a convenient position to dine in. Have lower tables or firmer seats.
Printing mistakes on the menu is OK for a dhaba not a good restaurant. Mains are written as entres , also the menu card itself looks shabby.
Lastly the approach to the dining area is very shabby. The stairs leading up have no character. This makes it look very unfinished . mirrors or a water feature or even a
ma√Ætre d' s table would look so much more professional. Tamarind has a similar approach but they have done it up beautifully.
The establishment has tremendous potential. It is value for money has excellent service just lacks finishing .

Very nice ambiance. Went there for my best friend's birthday party. Food was delicious and was served hot.
I was totally unaware of this place until my friend told me about this beautiful restaurant.
Although the Makhani Naan could have been a bit more impressive.¬†
Also they play good music

I was unaware of this hidden gem until last Saturday when I was invited for food audit as part of team Panchphoron.Nevertheless,I am glad that I was invited here for food tasting!!!

It is located very close to the Rashbehari crossing...walking distance from Kalighat metro station gate no 3.There is a CCD on the first floor and this restaurant is located on the 2nd floor.

The ambience is quite romantic,so anyone living by can come for a nice romantic dinner at this place .It is not as small as one might think looking at this restaurant from outside.As we entered,we discovered that only a part of the restaurant was visible from the road and that it was more spacious than we imagined.There is a beautiful water fountain waiting to greet you as you enter.Normally,I don't comment about the furniture of a restaurant but this place has one of the most comfortable sofas I ever sat on in a restaurant!!!

The owner,Priyadarshini,greeted us as we took our seats.She suggested us some of her Oriental and North Indian dishes which we gave a try.

We started off with a few mocktails:-

Cinderella-This is pretty average.It looked better than it tasted actually.

Deep Sea-This was a jaljeera based green drink which tasted good.It had a different flavour due to the jaljeera.

Virgin Blue Lagoon-This is the normal Blue Lagoon that one would get everywhere minus the vodka.It was not the best but definitely better than most of the places I tried it in.

Pink Island-This was the worst amongst the lot.It was too sweet and syrupy.Absolutely flavourless!!!

Heaven's Calling-This was the best of the lot!!!It was light green in color and had a mint based flavor.The most refreshing among all the cocktails...I would definitely recommend this!!!

For soups:-

Murg Yakni Shorba-This needs a lot of improvement!!!Most of the places that I have tried shorba in,they were thicker and creamier. Flavor wise,it was average.

Tom Yum Noodle Soup-This usually comes with chicken but can also come with prawns.It had a lot of vegetables,was spicy and tasted good altogether.However,this soup needs to be made thicker.

Seafood Clear Soup with Prawn Dumplings-The best soup of the lot!!!It had a very mild and soothing aroma,suitable for people who don't like thick and creamy soup.The prawn dumplings were beautifully and perfectly steamed!!!

For starters:-

Khumb Galawati Kebabs ‚Äì This was an eye opening dish for me since I didn't know that vegetarian kebabs could taste this good!!!. The mushrooms had been made into a paste and soft enough to melt in your mouth.It comes with a small paratha below it.Must try for vegetarians!!!

Makhani Karahi ‚Äì This one was good,the chicken was soft,though a bit spicy!!

Prawn Tempura ‚Äì The best starter of the lot!!!Prawns were fresh and perfectly cooked..the batter could have been crispier and the batter lacked a bit salt..but it was compensated by the sweet chilli sauce!!!

Stir Fried water-chestnut-I could not make out the flavor of water chestnut initially,but when I did I was amazed!!!Never did I imagine that a dish can be made from it...it tasted good.

Stir Fried Pak Choi in White garlic Sauce ‚Äì This was another surprise for me. The Pak Choi was saut√©ed in white garlic sauce and that tasted lovely!!!

For mains:-

Chicken Thai green curry with steamed rice ‚Äì This was a bit too sweet than it usually should be!!!But tasted pretty good nevertheless.IF you don't want it to be too sweet,please mention while ordering..

Spicy Lan Ching Chicken ‚Äì One of the best chicken dishes we ate..The chicken had a bit of skin on it which made it crispier,accompanied with veggies and sauteed with soya sauce.

Fish Hyderabadi ‚Äì This was a very confusing dish since it was supposed to be predominantly coconut milk based,but had a whole lot of different flavours!!!As a result,this dish disappointed me!!!We were served Pomfret but it is usually served with Bhetki..

Keema Naan ‚Äì This was good though I hardly found any keema!!!They should increase the quantity of keema.

Emperor Seafood Fried Rice ‚Äì I absolutely loved this!!!We were served prawns and fish but normally they serve squid as well,which was unavailable that day!!!Another highly recommended dish.

Steamed Fillet in black bean sauce ‚Äì The presentation was really great and the dish tasted good too!!!However,I found the fish a bit old and smelly..

For deserts:-

Gajar ka Halwa ‚ÄìI don't eat this anywhere but here it was really good!!!The color was deep orange without any artificial colors mixed and it wasn't overtly sweet!!!We could taste ghee in it.

Sesame tossed honey noodle with vanilla ice cream ‚Äì This was a good dish. The flat sesame seed tossed fried noodles topped off with vanilla ice cream and sesame seeds on top made it a pretty good dish!!!I would suggest to increase the amount of ice cream for the noodles served...

I am really glad to have been introduced to this place by Panchphoron and would visit back soon!!!

Southern Avenue gets another good eatery serving quite a wide variety of dishes and cuisines! Though it is just six months old but it has already started building the goodwill which is vital for any restaurant (or any business) to do well in the long run. The Palms offers some good food with amazing ambiance at reasonable prices which is quite a deadly combination for sure. And definitely the service is equally good with attentive and helpful servers right there at your service.

Last Saturday I was invited to this place for a food tasting event and had the opportunity to taste a huge variety of dishes that truly helped me to evaluate this newly opened restaurant. I had some suggestions and I hope those will be taken care of in near future; but otherwise it was a lovely evening and a scrumptious dinner for sure with North Indian, Awadhi, Chinese and Thai cuisines fighting among themselves on my table! Let us delve deep into a bit details to get a hang of the food quality and other paraphernalia related to this place.

Location - - - - - This place is placed very close to Kalighat Metro Station (Gate no. 3) and it is a two minutes walk from there towards the Southern Avenue, it is there just beside the CCD outlet. There used to be Funjabi Tadka at this place. You can park your car on the main road. And if you are at this place after sunset, you can surely spot it more easily with the blue LED lights that write the name of the restaurant on the name-board.

Ambiance - - - - - The entrance is bit small but when you walk inside you will find that the place is quite spacious. As you walk in you will find several stairs which you need to climb to reach the restaurant that opens up into a large hall which is very well lit. Also as you step inside the restaurant you will find a beautiful pristine water fountain right there in front of you against a dark rocky wall, the incessant sound of flowing water calms you down and enriches your entire dining experience even without your knowledge. But I would suggest the management to play some soothing Indian classical instrumentals in the background and to stay away from playing Bollywood numbers that might ruin the classy ambiance and overall mood of the diner, also the volume of the background music should always be kept a bit low. But I would anyway like to appreciate the interior d√©cor which is so perfect for this place. The furniture and the wall textures are amazing and very urbane. The seating arrangements are so comfortable and you can sit, dine and have a great conversation there for hours maybe. Also as said earlier the place is very spacious and the seating arrangements are very well planned, which is a huge plus point. The place has got a capacity of accommodating total 70 guests, and you get several tables here for large groups, which is again a plus point. I even loved the classy false ceiling d√©cor and everything about the warm romantic ambiance and lovely interior d√©cor of this place! Hope this will be well maintained and if the place starts providing free wifi to the guests then it‚Äôll be an added advantage for sure. Now, coming to the cutleries, I have got no complains with that, they are pristine white and very classy, just perfect for this place.

Food - - - - We decided to taste some mocktails followed by the North Indian, Awadhi and then the oriental dishes. So it was a huge spread and we managed to finish things off well and on-time :) So, here are all the items we had ordered:

<< Mocktails >>

a)	Pink Island ‚Äì I will avoid this mocktail on any given day! It tasted very syrupy and was tad too sweet for my liking, it was dark pink in color and we could not finish it in the end.

b)	Heaven‚Äôs Calling ‚Äì This was just opposite the last one, this was the best mocktail I have tried at this place. It was light green in color and had a lovely refreshing taste which was bit sour and sweet, just a perfect blend. Must try!

c)	Deep Sea ‚Äì It was a nice jal-jeera based mocktail, kinda aam panna flavor with that deep green color and served in a nawabi glass that added more glam quotient to it :)

d)	Virgin Blue Lagoon ‚Äì At other places I have tasted very bad Blue Lagoon mocktails, but this one at Palms was a better one and I quite liked its taste which had a nice balance of flavors in it.

e)	Cinderella ‚Äì It was again on the sweeter side but was nice and refreshing. But importantly it looked great with a dark orangish base and a light colored top!

<< Soups >>

a)	Seafood Clear Soup with Prawn Dumplings ‚Äì It was the best soup that I had at this place. It was very soothing and the mild aroma was so satisfying. The prawn dumplings were beautifully made, and the greens were put in right proportions. Must try!

b)	Murg Yakni Shorba ‚Äì Not that great, mainly because of the chewy chicken pieces which were in there, the flavor was okayish but not really worth the penny.

c)	Tom Yum Noodle Soup with prawn ‚Äì It was really good and loaded with ingredients like shrimps, zucchini, red chilies, mushrooms, noodles, etc. Bit spicy as expected and very flavorful, but it could have been a bit thicker in density.

<< Starters >>

a)	Prawn Tempura ‚Äì It was an amazing dish and the prawn in there was very fresh. The coating could have been a bit crispier but anyway I liked it the way it was. Dip it in the sweet red chili sauce and enjoy! Worth a try!

b)	Khumb Galawati Kebabs ‚Äì This was another amazing dish. The mushrooms have been pasted into flat round balls and you call it the mushroom galawati kebabs which are dipped in garlic and ghee, it is so smooth in texture that you need not chew it, it‚Äôll just melt in your mouth!

c)	Sultani Irani ‚Äì This was a tandoor-ed mutton boti starter with jafran and yogurt, it was devoid of any spices so tasted a bit unusual, it was tad too sour for that yogurt and I felt as if some other spices could‚Äôve made the thing taste better. It tasted different for sure and the mutton in there was fresh, but I may not have this again.

d)	Makhani Karahi ‚Äì This one was very good, it was tandoored soft, juicy boneless chicken in sweet and sour red sauce. Worth a try!

e)	Stir Fried water-chestnut ‚Äì Nice and innovative dish for sure. We Bengalis normally have water-chestnut raw as a fruit, but here it tasted amazing in this spicy and tangy gravy with black pepper, asparagus and sugar snap. Worth a try!

f)	Stir Fried Pak Choi in White garlic Sauce ‚Äì This was the star dish for sure. It had a very simple presentation and tasted just amazing! You get a choice of sauces here and I went in for the white garlic sauce which I guess was the correct one. The Pak Choi leaves were saut√©ed in that white garlic sauce and that produced some lovely mild aroma and intense inimitable flavors. Must try!

<< Main Course >>

a)	Chicken Thai green curry with steamed rice ‚Äì One of the most common Thai dishes available around the globe. The ingredients used were all perfect like lemongrass, galangal, kaafir lime, sweet basil, coriander, etc but one thing went wrong - it was tad too sweet which was a let down. But anyway the sweetness was eclipsed by all those great ingredients, the refreshing aroma and the juicy chicken pieces in there. Just ask them not to make it sweet. Worth a try!

b)	Spicy Lan Ching Chicken ‚Äì It was one lovely spicy side dish with hint of soya sauce and the chicken had a nice texture with some skin on it, the diced exotic veggies used made the dish even more flavorful.

c)	Fish Hyderabadi ‚Äì This dish is generally prepared with Bhetki but it was prepared with Pomfret for this event. The fish was fresh but I personally didn‚Äôt like the preparation, it was bit watery and the gravy did not seem to be coconut gravy, as the dish claims!

d)	Keema Naan ‚Äì This was really amazing. Soft naan stuffed with keema. Really one great find. Must try!

e)	Sea food Fried Rice ‚Äì Again a star dish! Though it was not having the squid in it but still it tasted very sea-food-ish and the intense flavors blew me away in the very first bite! Nice aromatic dish with loads of fish and shrimp bits. Must try!

f)	Steamed Fillet in black bean sauce ‚Äì Oh boy this looked so awesome! The presentation was really nice and it tasted equally good. The Bhetki fish was really fresh and tasted great with the black bean sauce.

<< Desserts >>

a)	Gajar ka Halwa ‚Äì I am not a fan of Gajar Halwa but I must say I loved it here. It was so light, mild and absolutely not overtly sweet. Worth a try!

b)	Sesame tossed honey noodle with vanilla ice cream ‚Äì It was an innovative dessert and it looked amazing, and tasted equally good. The flat sesame seed tossed fried noodles had a dollop of vanilla ice cream on top and it was a joy to have this after the heavy meal. A perfect ending! I am happy that orthodox vanilla icecream with darshan was not served and there is a touch of innovation here, which is appreciable. Must try!

Service - - - - - The place is very new so the training of the servers are yet not over. But I found some of them are working extremely hard to make things work, they are sincere, helpful and courteous and I guess with time the will serve us even better.

Summary - - - - - Here are my granular ratings:

Food quantity: 4/5
Food quality: 3.7/5
Food presentation: 3.8/5
Value for money: 3.7/5
Ambiance: 4/5
Service: 3.7/5

My overall rating comes to 3.8 out of 5, which will be rounded off to 4 out of 5 Zomato rating. So this was one remarkable gastronomical discovery for me and I am sure I have marked the star dishes for which I‚Äôll be back. Overall I felt the oriental dishes are better at this place though they stress more on their Mughlai or Awadhi departments. Hope they will work on the couple of suggestions provided above in this review and I wish them all the best for the coming days. I would just like them to stress a bit more on publicity so that people are aware of this new place, till then the word of mouth publicity would do the trick. If you are reading this post and are already planning to visit this place then I would suggest you to please go ahead, bring in your loved ones and you will love the overall experience!

Cheers!
                                          ...

This fine diner at Southern Avenue is beautifully done up in pristine colours of ivory with touches of the red family. The seating looks elegant and is unbelievably comfortable, I almost sank down into its couch by a few inches. The glass wall on one side, the dome fountain lined with pebbles and the fresh smell all added up to whet my appetite. 

I had gone there on an invitation to PanchPhoron, and tasted a selection of their newly introduced oriental menu. The Bonbon Chicken salad tempted me visually with its vibrant colours, and perfectly cut vegetables, but was low on dressing. The Asian Green Soup with Tofu was really good, with clean flavours and was exactly what was expected of a good Asian soup. The Potato with Pickled Ginger however was a little disappointing, with the potato themselves being a touch undercooked. The sauce coating it wasn't evenly spread either. The Prawn Tempura lacked the crispiness of a signature tempura while the Chicken Satay was not grilled to perfection. 

For mains, the Oriental Noodles were pretty good, but the Stir fried Bokchoy in Yellow Sauce was no t the perfect accompaniment to it. The latter was more of a salad, and a pretty good one. The Braised Tofu with Water Chestnuts was good, but being a fan of tofu and not a big fan of chestnuts, i had to pick out on the former. But my favourites of the day were the Fish in Black Bean Sauce, which unlike many other places was not overtly soya saucy. The Diced Chicken with Shiitake Mushrooms was another winner, with the fresh velvety mushrooms making a perfect partner for the fibrous chicken, and the sauce bringing them together wonderfully. 

In all, though they need to add a little more punch to their starters, their mains were pretty good. I would definitely recommend this place for a good family dinner. It also has an intricate and elaborate Indian menu, and I will definitely be going back to this place to try out that too.

P.S. The lady in charge of the place, Priyadarshini, tries to be there most of the times. She also takes care of the guests personally in her graceful demeanor.

Was here for a food tasting event...! The Lady who owned the place took care of us along with her efficient team of severs. We were served mocktails on arrival... I got the pink panther which did not please my taste buds much. The heavens calling was excellent though. Blue lagoon was an usual  experience. We choose our soups, the prawn dumpling seafood soup was amazing...The tomyum soup was perfectly done up,the murgh shoba should be avoided at any cost. For starters we started off with perfect prawn tempura, amazing murgh makhni tikka...soft and yummy, a mutton sultana iranian kebab which I did not like again. The mushroom galauti was the best and it's unique, we choose stir fried asparagus and waterchestnut which was decent. Coming to the main course for Indian it was keema naan,which was nice and crispy though they could increase their stuffing a little. The hyderabad fish which I did not like. The oriental fare was better... The seafood rice was delicious, the sang li chicken was amazing, the fish in black pepper sauce was nice too. The thai green curry was a Lil more seen than it should be, served with perfect steamed rice. I tasted some steamed pakchoy which is supposed be bland but tasted pretty much ok. We ended our meal with mind blowing gajar ka hawa and honey lovely honey sesame noodles with a dollop of ice cream . An amazing session leading to a evening well spent. Thank you The palms :)

The Palms is the new fine dining restaurant in the Rashbehari area. Located right at the corner of Southern Avenue near Rashbihari more, this restaurant offers variety of North Indian, Mughlai, Chinese & Awadhi dishes. Its on the First floor, seating is spacious. The ambience offers a very calm environment, rightfully featured in the Romantic' collection by Zomato. Their selection of music too does compliment with the theme.
I was invited along with Shahbaaz to try their Thai & Chinese offerings. Thanks to the 'The Palms' for having us. Below is the review of the dishes we tried.

1. Bon Bon Chicken Salad: The salad was good in taste as well as in presentation, but the chicken was a bit overcooked, & maybe they could replace the black sesame seeds with white ones.

2. Asian Green Soup with Tofu: This one is good. Specially loved the tofu.

3. Potato with pickled ginger: This was a tad disappointing. Specially considering the price of 160 rs. All the potatoes weren't boiled properly, & the garnishing wasn't great either. Maybe not the dish one would like to order in a restaurant.

4. Prawn Tempura: Not quite tasty,may have been a problem with the prawn itself. Also there was no extra flavours in the coating. Needs to be eaten along with the sauce served, which we weren't aware of.

5.Chicken Satay: Needs to be grilled more, so as to make the grill marks visible. Also the accompanying sauce can be changed.

6. Stir fried Bok Choy in yellow sauce: Pretty decent in taste. In fact the bok choy were realy fresh & young sprouts. Served as a side, this is better consumed as an appetizer/ soup replacement. Also it can do with some crunchy topings.

7. Braised Tofu with water chestnut & chilli beans: In one word, amazing. The Tofu was cooked to perfection, while the sauce was tasty.

8. Diced Chicken with shitake mushrooms in oyster sauce: Another amazing dish, the right choice of mushrooms, the well cooked chicken which imbibed the oyster sauce to the full presenting an excellent dish.

9. Steamed fish in Black Beans Sauce: The fish itself was soft. the dish quite juicy, but the portion was a little on the lower quantity. Order keeping that in mind.

10. Veg Oriental Noodles: Great taste, another dish which was made tastier by adding tofu in it. Quantity was a good, as was the presentation.

11. Spicy Fried Rice: This too was quite a decent dish, & as the name suggests is on the spicier side. Fish in oyster sauce will be a great side to this dish.

Overall the main dishes were good. Specially they cook excellent tofu. Their starters need slight modifications as mentioned. When we talked with the chef, we found out some dishes might have gone wrong due to the fact that we were really in a hurry, & he did not get the required time to do them right specially the satay.
But given the right amount of time, I believe the dishes would have turned out better.
Will definitely visit again, with time to spare, so that i can taste the corrected dishes.Also this time couldn't try their desserts.Next time maybe.
Till then
Happy Eating.

The first thing you notice when you enter the place is the fountain and beautifully decorated interiors. apart from the food what I look is the seating arrangements which is top notch to say the least. Now coming to the ambience it is really Royal whether it's the interiors,the lighting and of course the courteous staff. Now coming to the food,we ordered galauti kebabs and the dahleez kebab as starters. to be honest the galauti kebab took our breath away as it was simply stupendous and the dahleez kebab were well prepared though a little bit spicy for our liking. the murgh peshawari we ordered for our main course was rich and somber in taste which complimented well with the jeera rice. the gulab jamun was very soft and melted in the mouth. I would definitely come back,keep up the good work

Tastefully decorated interiors with soulful music playing in the background, makes up for an awesome getaway for foodies here. The service team, being overtly generous; from seating you in your chair, serving food till taking regular feedbacks on the food they served, evidently showed that they meant Serious Business! The food was mouth wateringly good. The Hyderabadi Dum Biriyani, well cooked with the right amount of assorted spices. The Galawati Kebabs ruled your tastebuds with its soft texture. The desserts were a bit of a let down. They were average. The unavailability of Chocolate Brownie with Ice Cream was a mood dampener too. Overall a pleasant experience.

The interiors are spacious..nicely decorated and good ambiance..the waiters are very well mannered asking for feedbacks on the food as we eat..we ordered galawati kebab for starters..which is a little too costly provided the quantity served..then hyderabadi dum biriyani which was really good and lastly gajar ka halwa and gulab jamun as the desserts..we came in at 3pm on a sunday afternoon and the non availability of the the chocolate brownie in the desserts section was a real let down..overall for the experience and quality and quantity of food in the same price range of restros i would prefer Oudh 1590 anyday.

Had a chance to visit this restaurant, opted for takeaway but the few minutes spent there inside the restaurant was great. the ambiance is great, brightly lit spacious area, one fountain infront of the door, well decorated table chairs, polite staffs but unfortunately the restaurant was totally empty, dont know why such a great looking restaurant which serves good quality food at a posh area was so empty at peak hour!! I ordered masala kulcha, maharaja kofta, murg lahori and fish hyderabadi, among these items I didn't like the fish item as the quality of the fish was not that good but the others were excellent, special mention goes for the maharaja kofta which is absolutely brilliant and a should be a must order item here.. overall had a wonderful gastronomic experience with the delectable foods brought from the palms.

I'll definitely think to take another food in future many more. Your charges also negotiable for every one.

Well
I went to The Palms on 26 Jan. Since it was quite late there were very few diners. The decor is striking with a fountain as we entered. The waiters were very soft Nd cooperative. The food was quite good especially the sorba and the naans. The mutton was quite soft too
And another interesting point- the glasses were excellent.

One of the newest hub for authentic North Indian food in town..Located right at the start of Southern Avenue opposite to Tolly P.S. where Funjabi Tadka used to be earlier..There are ample number of North Indian and Mughlai joints in the city, but I guess with an innovative menu and distinct flavours surely this place has something new and different to offer from the daily trivialties of Biriyani and Chaap..Coming to the ambiance, this place is elegantly designed and signifies aesthetic taste of the management..A beautiful fountain at the entrance..nice,cosy sofa offering a warm and comfortable set-up.. Service is just spot-on..can't get better than this..Extremely cordial, knowledgeable staffs.. may be because we were the only dine-i guests for the whole time..A bit uncanny for a restaurant like this..Coming to the food we ordered:
Makhani Karahi: Ordered on server's recommendation..Nice, juicy, succulent chicken morsels marinated in a red paste and charred nicely..melts in the mouth..
Sultani Irani: Mutton Boti, marinated in a Jafran flavoured paste..the portions could have been a bit bigger for the price paid..also a bit underdone for my liking..
Maharaja Kofta: Even being a hardcore non-veggie, was blown away by its taste.. Koftas were made with Cottage cheese, palak and a crisp outer coating..loved the creamy gravy with Tandoori Roti..
Murgh Mussalam: Only dish which failed to impress..The Chicken was not tandoored properly and was a bit chewy..also the gravy lacked the punch..
However they need to revamp their desert menu as we can't find anything worth sampling..
Overall the food is quite good and distinct flavour wise..Looking forward to try the other interesting dishes on the menu..our total cheque comes to Rs.1600/-(all incl) for 3 people..
Food: 3.5/5
Pricing: 3/5
Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 4/5

Located very close to my house, I have been here, number of times and every time they don't fail to impress me. They have come up newly like couple of months back and the interiors look really awesome. The food, each and every item on their menu is great. The prices are not really high compared to the quality they serve.

Highly recommended..

Just opposite to tollygunj police station this restaurant is situated. We went here on 1st January.The ambience is attractive and beautifully decorated. We ordered geloti kabab,naram dil(a paneer preparation),biriyani(the quantity was less,compared to others),nun,dal makhani,veg polau,paneer maskawala,one chiken preparation,hot gulab jamun(tastes yummy) and fresh lime soda. The staffs were too good,polite and gentle. Overall a good experience to begin 2016 with the tasty food of palm.

The Restaurant is situated just beside CCD, Southern Avenue. Locationwise it deserve to get full marks. The service, decor and ambience was really good. The staffs were really good at their service. Among kebabs the Makhani Karahi was really good, soft and tender. But a bit of improvement is needed regarding both the sweet and sour sauces. The other non-veg dish i.e. Murgh Mussallam was very good and spicy. Tandoori Roti was good. The best item among all was Paneer Maskawala... Nice blend of spices give it an awsm taste. 
Though the price was high but the quality of food was good. If the Palms authority add some more veg. varieties and desert varieties to their menu it will be really good.

Located at the entrance of southern avenue..right opposite to tollygunge police station.. this restaurant serves fine indian cuisine.. the restaurant offers a very different kind of menu..it kind of looked really nice and different to me..

i have tried their khumb galawati kabab which is their speciality..it was commendably tasty..and murgh banjara for starters..which was also nice..

For the mains i had, jeera rice and murgh bagmati which again sounded very different to me.. for dessert had gulab jamun... basically i tried stuffs i hadnt had before and it was definitely worth the try.¬†
service is good and the managers are doing a great job. Very cordial staffs.¬†
The interiors are well decorated.Gives a lovely ambience..
My overall experience was greatly satisfying..thanks for the lovely food. Hope to visit again very soon.. :)

I went to this place with my wife. It's a very new restaurant which has opened next to CCD at Tollygunge Police Station. The place is really awesome. The internal decoration and ambience is good. The taste of the foods are really awesome. Every staff members are very nice and humble, and they would help you in every way. It's little bit expensive however for good food in such a nice place you can still manage. I would definitely love to visit this place again and would definitely advise my friends to visit as well.

It was a very beautiful experience visiting this place . Service was top notch , staff were very humble , patient and helping . Food was delicious , specially the starters which were mouth watering with the chutneys and probably I could have enjoyed them as main course too :p . Now coming to suggestions part . Firstly you should consider adding more dishes to your menu for vegetarians explicitly . That will take it to the next level , I can't suggest about Non- Veg as I didn't have a look at those. Secondly I would love to see the same service,dedication and food quality the next time I visit :)

Situated just beside CCD on Southern Avenue, this place is relatively new. But it strikes gold with its ambience, decor & hospitality. The decor gives a very princely feeling. The menu is very intelligently prepared.

Coming to the food we ordered :
1. Murgh Yakhni Shorba - Mildly prepared. Ginger gives an interesting flavour.

2. Makhani Karahi kebab - too delicious & certainly a welcome break from the regular tikka, reshmi & hariyali counterparts.

3. Murgh Kalimirch - chicken pieces in were tender but not much to my liking.

4. Naan - soft & melts in the mouth.

The food quality & quantity both are well-maintained.
The pricing is a bit on the higher side though. The waiters are very friendly & super-efficient. Will definitely look forward to try out their kebabs.
Keep up the good work

On my extensive search for a new restaurant with a good ambience and quality food, I luckily discovered 'The Palms'..
A brand new restaurant with absolutely gorgeous ambience.. large sofas, large windows, altogether sets a perfect mood as soon as you step in.
Coming to food, we ordered
fish haryali kebab, chicken banjara for starters.. the fish was soft, juicy and tasted superb. For main course, we had mohini Nan, khumb bori biryani(their speciality dish), veg pulao, chicken hara pyaza and achari gosht.. the palm's special khumb(veg) biryani with lots of mushrooms and the complimentary raita, tasted heavenly. The mohini Nan was a totally unique type of nan with a thin layer of egg and lots of spring onions in it and had an awesome new taste. The side dishes were also pretty good. Only the dessert- gajar halwa- was a bit of a disappointment.. felt a little dry and could've been better.. ( 'cause we had set our expectations too high after the mouthwatering starters and main course!!)
Well, the staffs and the courteous waiters need a special mention. Specially, Mr. Shahrukh khan, thanks a lot for helping us find the exact location and for suggesting the best dishes for us and giving us a lovely dining experience.
Friends, do try out their khumb biryani and mohini Nan.
And yes, the pocket pinch is surprisingly low as compared to other places with such good ambience and food.
Overall, this place is a gem in itself. Hope to visit again :)
