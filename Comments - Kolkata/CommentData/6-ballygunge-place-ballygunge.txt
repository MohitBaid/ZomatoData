Dal
Big Parse Sorshe

I have been visiting here since a long time. This is one of the favourite destinations of my parents. I've had ilish biryani, ilish bhapa, bhetki paturi, mutton dakbangalow, daab chingri, niramish shobji and pulao. Also the nolen gurer ice is too yummy. So far my favourite  best Bengali cuisine place

Bengali cuisine at it's best only at 6 Ballygunge Place
.
Bengali cuisine has got it's own spark yet the food, the taste with which they( 6 Ballygunge Place) cook remains intact.
The taste can even give you some serious nostalgia as it may bear some resemblences with your mom's or your grandmother's recipe.

The lost forget Bengali recipe which our grandmother's used to make are getting revised keeping the taste and the feel intact.

If you're Bengali then you already know the culture and the connection we bear with food and for others do check-in if you love to taste some amazing Bengali food.

The Pithe Parbon Utsav is going to be celebrated and if you love to savour some pithe then definitely head towards 6 Ballygunge Place. They are bringing up a unique pithe this time called as 'Baashori Bhapa Puli'. This pithe is made inside a bamboo. Other than that there's a lot of variety like 'Basanti Bhapa Puli' , 'Kesari Patishapta', 'Gajorer Patishapta' , 'Dhakai Ros Pithe', 'Ros Bora', 'Komola Chushi Pithe'.

The festival will go on for 3days 13th Jan to 15th Jan 2018.
So make your plans accordingly so that you don't miss out this amazing treat.

Happy eating.😊

Awesome taste and delicacies. The buffet consists of eggs, chicken, fish and mutton, all served in proper bengali style. With "begun bhaaja, dhaaka sobji and luchi", the platter had no point deductions for the taste. This was topped with chutney-papad, nolen gurer rosogolla and mishti doi.

The ambience was nice as well, a classic raajbaari look. 

The staffs are a bit less sophisticated though. A training session, with a bit focus on communication skills would definitely work.

Thumbs up!

Went on saturday for lunch. We had a booking of two. 
Nice place with lots of hand crafted decoration. Opted for buffet. They served welcome drink first.
They served luchi and begun vaja on table. Rest of the items we took by our own. Foid was really very good in taste. Options were nice too. Gondhoraj chicken was very good in taste. Mainly this buffet included main course. It had rice, pulao, dal, fulkopi, alur dom, chicken, pabda, chingri, mutton etc.. I tasted each and every item except dal and rice. And each item was perfectly cooked and very nice in taste. Dessert  included chatni, papad, misti doi, rosogolla, another sandesh, paan etc. 

Overall very nice experience. Staff were helpful and prompt. Loved it.

My go-to place for delicious Bengali food...I have been to this outlet many times and returned with satisfied tastebuds everytime...

Cosy warm ambiance with soft music in the background and very courteous staffs...A perfect family restro :) 

Items i have tried out here...

Kaju Kismis Pulao with Kosha Mangsho --- My two most favourite dishes here...The pulao is the best i have had till date and same goes for the Kosha Mangsho...I have tried the latter at many other places but nothing beats this...The mutton pieces just melt in the mouth...Perfect blend of spices and flavour...The gravy is lipsmacking and would surely leave you craving for more...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
This combo is a must have for me whenever i visit. 

Gondhoraj Chicken(Starter) --- My favourite starter here...Tastes fantastic...just the quantity feels a bit less😜😜 

Doi Murgi --- Another delicious chicken preparation...goes well with pulao/rice...Again the gravy is awesome 😆😆😆

They have drinks and shakes by the names of roads of our city...Don't remember the names and can't find them here on zomato also...so can't tell...but basically the Blue Lagoon one works well for me...though i feel it could be a bit sweeter...and a Strawberry flavoured shake goes well for my Mom.
The prices are on the higher side.

Great service! Very courteous staff. 

For me, the must haves include the following:

1. Steamed aam kasundi murgi (wonderful combination of tangy and sweet chicken pieces)

2. Bhetkir paturi

3. Laal Mangsho (very flavorful - a little on the spicy side though!)

I wasnt very happy with their mutton items. The pieces were too chewy. 

For two people our bill was 1600 INR.

A very nice ambiance, which we generally do not see in restaurants. It gives a feel of home, with the Bengali food and the homely decor.

None of the dishes are too heavy or rich in spices. We went for the buffet which had luchi, begun bhaja, aloor dum, plain rice, daal, veg. Sabzi, machher jhal, chingrir malaikari, kancha lonka chicken(seemed more like dhaniya chicken), pulao, mutton dakbungalow, dhaniya fried chicken, Khejur amsotyor chutney, mishti doi(too bad), gurer roshogolla(was not gurer at all), baked pantua(too sweet), papad.
And apart from that we had taken chitol machher muittha, daab chingri.

None of the dishes I can say was praise worthy or exceptionally tasty. I expected much better taste.
But most importantly, the muittha was extremely rubbery and chewy, the mutton was undercooked, the fish did not seem to be fresh.
Daab chingri was good. 
I loved there complementary gondhoraj lassi.

Went here quite a few times, mostly with family as this is a family favourite dueto its delicious Bengali cuisine. 

Each item prepared here appeals to the taste buds whether it is chingri malaikari/dab chingri, pabda, hilsa paturi, baked bhetki, or kosha mangsho. Chingrir pulao is the one to go for. I always find it tastier than mangsher pulao. Tempting desserts are the icing on the cake.

The ambience is cosy and homely. Would love to visit often

On the occassion of our 2nd anniversary, we dined at 6 ballygunge place as a mini celebration. We opted for the buffet and the spread was quite lavish. We started with luchi, begoon bhaja and aloor dom. We were also served with gondhoraj ghol and that was really amazing.

The main course consisted of rice, shukto, dal, aloo seddho, saang bhaja, parshe maacher jhol, chicken curry, kochi pathar jhol, chatnee and papad. I found the chicken gravy slightly oily but all the other items were delicious.

The dessert section had mishti doi and sandesh.

The pocket pinch was less too and the waiters eere friendly. Had a good experience!

Good Bengali food, very courteous staff, slightly pricey.. 
The lunch buffet had Rui machher kalia, dhonepata diye chicken and mutton kasha as the only non veg dishes (no non veg starter, nor were there any other form of fish).  Seeing this we decided to go for a la carte. 
Had 
Haser dimer devil 8/10, which was excellent though it came with an overpowering flavor of garam masala, 

tel koi, 7/10. Very good.  Appeared to be sweeter than the natural sweetness of the coconut, 

Chitol muithha, 6/10. Good, nothing extraordinary. The koftas were a bit rubbery! 

Kasha mangsho 9/10 was outstanding and goes really well with luchi. 

The total came up to 1680 for two incl of tax.

Daab chingi, kosha mangsho with luchi, malpua are something that redefined my perception about Bengali cuisine. The only one in my family to find fish to be painstakingly difficult to eat I found peace at this restaurant and flavours that belong to this region are amazingly presented here. The high ceiling, the interiors remind you of a Calcutta long forgotten but preserved in our hearts forever.

In my humble opinion, 6 Ballygunge Place serves some of the most authentic and delicious Bengali food available in the city. We went there on a Sunday night and although there was a vast buffet spread, we were in the mood for ala carte. We were told that the buffet involves a helping of hot loochis straight from the frying pan and long lyaj-ola begun bhaja (brinjal fry with the stem included). However, we resisted the temptation and opted for a lighter menu. We had their famous haser dim er devil as a starter along with a couple of mocktails. Their devils are whole eggs with a coating of minced lamb meat and an outer coating of breadcrumbs. At the tables they cut it into half length wise and serve it. If you take out, they are not sliced. The meat coating is extremely delicious and not too hot, which is sometimes a problem for this dish. However the coating is rather thin, so the dominant taste was that of the boiled egg. Their mocktails have rather catchy names after the residential addresses of various famous Calcuttans. We had the 24 Aswini Dutta Road (named after Sharatchandra Chattopadhyay's Kolkata home), which is a butterscotch concoction, a little too sweet for my liking. The other mocktail was a lime soda, whose name I forget. It was nice and refreshing.
In the main course, we decided to go with plain rice, daab chingri and bhuna mutton. Both the chingri and the mutton were finger licking good. The shrimp was cooked in a coconut gravy, much like the malaikari and served inside a green coconut (daab). The mutton was soft, cooked in a rich gravy and not too hot, which was a plus point for me. 
No Bengali meal is complete without some dessert, a little mishti mukh. We had their baked mihidana with rabri. If you have a sweet tooth, you will find this heavenly. The portion is normally big enough for one person, but as we were already stuffed and my friend wasn't much of a sweet person, we decided to share one between the two of us and it was quite enough. 
The decor of the place is lovely-charming and quaint. The waiters are polite and efficient. The pocket pinch is perhaps on the high side, but only slightly so.

Sorry for this late review.. it was a great dinner for me after my 3rd prof... cherished each and every moment ...dinner buffet was undoubtedly good...severel items were there...in started they served luchi and begun vaja and alur dom.. luchi and alur dom were good enough.. among veg items i liked the dhokar dalna most... it was the best one for me till date.. the taste of the egg kari was unforgettable ... but there were only one item of fish..which was sorse pabda..though it was good nd fresh but there should be one more item of fish...among meat,there were both chicken and mutton..chicken was well cooked nd good in taste but the mutton was not well cooked...beside these.,we ordered sorse ilish...though it was well cooked and very good in taste bt the hilsa was not as good as we expected..it was a very much disappointment.. as it was the good season of ilish and market price of the fish was very low so they can and should serve good quality of hilsa.. now coming to dessert..there were baked rasgolla,misti doi,chatni and papad...all were definitely good...
Lastly i should mention the ambiance...i loved it so much...it was like a zamindar palace... overall, good one..

Jhinge aloo posto - good
Cholar dal - good 
Rice
Mochar Paturi
Chingri malai curry - good
Boneless Bharat ilish - disappointing - small quantity and taste wasn’t good

It's located in 6 Ballygunge place. A proper Bengali restaurant. We went there yesterday. We had to wait in the queue for 10 minutes. We opted for lunch buffet. It costs 672rs per person (including tax). The ambience is very nice. But the staffs are not so good. They are not able to handle that crowd. They didn't even serve the complementary drink at the very beginning. We had to ask them repeatedly for the drink. Finally they served the ghol when we're already in the middle of our lunch. They should increase the starter items (mangsho chop is the only item) . They should add a paneer item in the veg section. The non veg section was the only good thing in the buffet. For desserts, they had rosogolla and mishti doi. I think, they should add some more sweets to the desserts section. A lot of improvement is needed for the buffet area.

6 Ballygunge Place, referred/recommended one of the best places for authentic Bengali Cuisine unanimously, and for really for some good reasons !!

The decor and its soothing ambience are the key features.
Bright lights, spacious and beautifully decorated indoors. Its a two tier restaurant with ample seating capacity. Ground floor offers buffet options and the first floor is meant for regular dining.

Being a North Indian and my first try on Bengali Cuisine, I got all immersed and need to mention food was heavenly, beautiful blend of aroma and spices.

Rohu Fry needs a special mention, lip-smacking good, fried to perfection.

I have to acknowledge, the staff here, for they were the perfect ingredients to the making of the whole experience being very courteous and polite. 

In nutshell, it was an admirable experience with the restaurant and the food (obviously). Recommended !!

If one's ever in Kolkata, and has time for just one meal, this place is one of the top contenders for where you should have that one meal. We had their begun bhaja, doi murghi, and mangshor jhol, and each one of these was good. Also, did I mention that their nolen gur ice-cream is to die for?!

I am a vegetarian from Bangalore. I visited 6 ballygunge place based on recommendations by a friend, and I was absolutely delighted with the food. So much so that I have revisited the place within 3 days.

Food was absolutely amazing. Waiters were courteous and were very helpful in getting us the right combinations of food. Ambience is good. Service was reasonably quick. Not very expensive.

Thumbs up by me on all counts.

Since many days that place was in my wish list. Today that wish came on my plate. I was there today with my ma baba for their anniversary. Really speaking, I am lezy enough to write reviews for restaurant. But their food and ambience couldn't stop me to give reviews on them. 
The joint does'nt look like restaurant, rather it is a complete house with study room, dining room, bed room with perfect decor of Bengalis' culture and customs. We ordered fish kabiraji and chicken gandhoraj in starter. First one was awesome, excellent, didn't know how to use more adjectives to describe smell and taste of the former one. Gandharaj chicken was good enough. In main course,   ordered steam rice, polou, prawn malaikari, muttoner jhol, bhetki paturi. Bhetki was muaahhhaaa. Muttoner  jhol was not so rich, goes with my Baba correctly. Prawn gravy was too good, bt little disappointed with prawn itself. Order nolen gurer ice cream in desert, too good, too good. 
Thanks subhra, a man who served us so well and let us feel so comfortable. Thanks again man, thanks 6 ballygunge. Would be there next time very shortly.

6 Ballygunge Place, referred/recommended one of the best places for authentic Bengali Cuisine unanimously, and for really for some good reasons !!

The decor and its soothing ambience are the key features.
Bright lights, spacious and beautifully decorated indoors. Its a two tier restaurant with ample seating capacity. Ground floor offers buffet options and the first floor is meant for regular dining.

Being a North Indian and my first try on Bengali Cuisine, I got all immersed and need to mention food was heavenly, beautiful blend of aroma and spices.

Rohu Fry needs a special mention, lip-smacking good, fried to perfection.

I have to acknowledge, the staff here, for they were the perfect ingredients to the making of the whole experience being very courteous and polite. 

In nutshell, it was an admirable experience with the restaurant and the food (obviously). Recommended !!

If one's ever in Kolkata, and has time for just one meal, this place is one of the top contenders for where you should have that one meal. We had their begun bhaja, doi murghi, and mangshor jhol, and each one of these was good. Also, did I mention that their nolen gur ice-cream is to die for?!

I am a vegetarian from Bangalore. I visited 6 ballygunge place based on recommendations by a friend, and I was absolutely delighted with the food. So much so that I have revisited the place within 3 days.

Food was absolutely amazing. Waiters were courteous and were very helpful in getting us the right combinations of food. Ambience is good. Service was reasonably quick. Not very expensive.

Thumbs up by me on all counts.

Since many days that place was in my wish list. Today that wish came on my plate. I was there today with my ma baba for their anniversary. Really speaking, I am lezy enough to write reviews for restaurant. But their food and ambience couldn't stop me to give reviews on them. 
The joint does'nt look like restaurant, rather it is a complete house with study room, dining room, bed room with perfect decor of Bengalis' culture and customs. We ordered fish kabiraji and chicken gandhoraj in starter. First one was awesome, excellent, didn't know how to use more adjectives to describe smell and taste of the former one. Gandharaj chicken was good enough. In main course,   ordered steam rice, polou, prawn malaikari, muttoner jhol, bhetki paturi. Bhetki was muaahhhaaa. Muttoner  jhol was not so rich, goes with my Baba correctly. Prawn gravy was too good, bt little disappointed with prawn itself. Order nolen gurer ice cream in desert, too good, too good.

Come down nd enjoy the bengali cuisine out here.

Living in Kolkata for almost 5 months now, I can safely say that my South Indian tastebuds were totally mortified at the thought of eating Bengali food; or what I thought was Bengali food. After a long day of sight-seeing with a dear friend, we couldn't muster the energy to get dressed and go to dinner. The owner of the Air BnB apartment we were staying in highly recommended, insisted even that we try the food out at this spot to get a 'real' taste of what Bengali cuisine was like. 
My stomach churned in nervousness about the overload of mustard oil it was going to receive and I was dreading this meal. My dear friend requested a home delivery of the popular Kosha Mangsho, Luchhis and Baigun Bhaja which was promptly delivered to our apartment in Jadavpur. 
The reception staff were very kind to us and guided us through the menu as we were spoilt for choice as we saw a large crowd manoeuvering their way through the well-known buffet spread.
As we got home and got into our pyjamas, eagerly waiting for the food, it arrived in style and we dug in without saying a single word. One morsel and it was safe to say, it was the best mutton I had ever eaten in my life. The beautiful meat, almost falling of the bone was very correctly flavoured, allowing the meat to take centre stage. For a gravy which was richly coloured, the spices were mild and robust at the same time. 
The luchhis, almost as big as an LP record disc complimented the beautiful mutton gravy like chocolate sauce to vanilla ice cream. The Baigun Bhaja, although oily was wonderful to eat along with a biting cold beer and gave us the feeling of having eaten something different from your regular 'chakna'. 
I hope I get the chance to go and check this place out for a proper meal in the near future so I can take full advantage of the service, ambience and of course, its mind-blowing food.

I tried both the weekday and weekend buffets. Service is good. Food however is nothing to go ga ga about. Veg items are better. Fish items are good. Chicken and mutton items are okayish at most. Desserts are definitely a let down. Trying to satisfy more on the quantity and variety rather than quality. Enjoyed the gondhoraj ghol sherbet the most. And the manager who was in charge during the sunday lunch buffet the day I visited with around 10 of my family members should be reminded that he is into service industry and must always be nice with guests. He retorted in a very rude tone that we need to finish our feast by 2:15 when we informed him that a couple of our members are running late.

Went there to attend a birthday party recently. The food and the people serving them were nice. The trouble however was the fact that they have very very very very very little place dedicated for general amenities, washrooms to be more specific. They have 3 in total. One in the ground floor for all. One each in the 1st floor for males and females. No other place to just wash your hands. That is definitely not a good news for anyone who is careful about personal hygiene.

Bengali cuisine in all its glory. Heard of this place a lot mostly famous for their authentic bengali foods. It is located at 6, Ballygunge Place, Ballygunge, Kolkata. This is a proper Bengali restaurant. You'll feel the essence of it as soon as you enter the place. The good thing was we didn't have to wait in queues for hours. We were seated as soon as went inside. It has a very soothing ambiance with soft lighting and beautiful decorations. Service is prompt.

All the items tasted nice except the daab chingri which was salt-less and bland.
 The Dal and aloo posto was also not upto the mark. Kosha Chicken tasted great. Also,the litchi lonka sherbat is a must try here. The thali ended with rosogolla,chutney and papad. 

Hope they keep up the good job!

Widely considered by many as the best Bengali Restaurant in town, I recently visited 6 Ballygunge Place with a friend and had a rather 'mixed' experience

Ambience- From the outside, the place gives off a very warm vibe with a nice open area with benches exuding an very understated charm. The interiors are a contrast, they're beautiful but is very in-your-face beautiful and screams 'Bengali' which probably appeals to most people but not to me.

Service- Prompt and courteous.

Food- We had plain rice, enchorer kofta, Dab Chingri and chitol maccher muitha. On a previous occasion I had had Bhapa Illish. Now, I don't visit bengali eateries very often because I can have shukto and begun bhaja anytime I want at home, but when I do, I expect the food to have a little bit of 'Xing'. 6, Ballygunj Place serves food that is typically very light and tastes like home cooked food which is fine by me if the ingredients are fresh and dishes flavourful. The Chiton Maccher Muitha and Enchorer kofta were fresh but not exactly tasty. There is a fine line between subtle and bland and the muitha was really bland. The Dab Chingri was probably a tad too sweet which I loved but my partner did not. I've had better dab chingri at this restaurant in the past though. I remember the illish I had a while back to be heavenly but then again I wouldn't base my rating on it. The size of the portions is good.

A bit overhyped, yes but I'll give higher rating based on happier past experiences.

Was there on Doshomi this year for their super famous buffet. The buffet was a huge spread which included a host of Bengali delicacies. It had everything to make people's soul happy, which according to me is very important. The fish roll, koraishutir kochuri(peas kachuri), chitol macher muitha needs a special mention. My Sindhi wife was eating a proper Bengali buffet for the fist time and she enjoyed it like how!! 

The pricing for the buffet was on the higher side but then we Bengalis are born to spent money on food.

A good spread of well cooked Bengali food. We opted for the buffet option. It's value for money if one likes non vegetarian food and can gorge on fish and prawns. The luchis and brinjal fries are served warm at the table. The veg dishes were yummy, too. I wish they had put in some more effort in the starters and dessert sections. There was no starter section to speak of... There was only a fish chop. Ambience is decent, the service is prompt. Definitely a one time visit.

There is a reason why they call this place the ultimate destination for typical bengali cuisine ! The presentation here and the catchy names in the menu for local delicacies are the main attraction here! Must try the daab chingri and the Kosha mangsho! Took a non bengali friend here for lunch and he fell in love - not with me but with the food!

Come here is you want to eat Bengali food like the Bhadralok, but dont come with a lot of expectations. The place looks like a Bengali villa converted into a restaurant. Every cornee is filled with local art and architecture. The food is good except for the fact that the service is a bit slow and the price is a little high by Calcutta standards. The Fish kobiraje is exceptional.

Went today for lunch buffet with my friend. It is the best bengali buffet restaurant I can say. Located near Ballygunge phari. Ambience was nice. Coming to the food I liked each & every item. There was a welcome drink named "Gandhoraj Ghol", it was the best start. Then luchi, begun vaja, alu dom, Badshahi daal, fish kobiraji in the starters. In the main course there were rice/kaju kismis pulao, kumro ghonto, bhuna chingri, parshe jhal, dhonepata kacha lonka murgi, Mutton kosha, chatni & papar. In the desert there were chanar malpoya, baked rasogolla and misti doi.
It was a complete Bengali thali for me. I enjoyed the Sunday lunch completely !!!!!

Authentic Bengali food.
Went for a lunch and ordered Fish fry and Pur Vora Achari Lonka for starter.The quantity was good for two people and the crunchiness was more than perfect.
Then ordered Posto Narkeler Bora, Moong Mohan Dal, Doi potol, Dab chingri, Kakrar(Crab) Jhal, Bhapa Ilish and Steamed Rice.Being a Bengali all the food were very common for me yet loved their authentic taste.Loved all the fish recipe specially the crab and Hilsa.
For dessert we ordered nolen gurer icecream wanted to try more but we were full .. <3

Its a must visit if you want to know the taste of West Bengal.
For locals "maa er hater ranna is even better".They also have a good buffet option but Ala card is recommended.

Ambiance and Service: Their picturesque interiors, Bengali themes, Bengali background music, polite service stole our heart..

Price: Affordable for a fine dine place.

Would visit whenever will miss #Maa_er_hater_ranna...

Went for Lunch to 6 Ballygunge Place today with colleagues. Started off well with Prawn cutlet & Mutton chop. But the we noticed hair in chutney & the servers were bringing the food & leaving it on side stations & in one case with the dirty plates from another tables. Food quality & taste is very nice , but couple of things pointed earlier left a very bad taste. They tried to recover by offering drinks & ice cream with their compliments, but I'm not too sure

The long time yearning finally gets fulfilled on a Sunday when we crossed the threshold of 6,Ballygaunge Place.
We were promptly given our table as it was an early dinner(at least for me). We opted for the Buffet which costs about 750/- per person.
But if you go for " According to the Menu" it would jump to 1200 Per Person for a 3 course meal.
However, the complimentary drink(Aam panna) was given. Luchi and Begun vaja(Bong but simple) were also served at the table. The dinner wagon was full of - Gondhoraj grilled vetki(Just superb,done with perfection), Vaat, Polao,Dal,Alur dom,Potoler Dolma(stuffed),Chicken( Was in green gravy,can't remember the exact name), Mutton,Prawn. In dessert there were Chatni, 6anar Malpoa, Sondesh(baked).

Looks amazing.. Right? But regrettably those were not. Very much average taste. We only enjoyed The starter.. It was really good. And then potoler dolma was above average. Oh, 6anar malpoa.. Yes it was good too. But the other preparations thwarted us. I think,they focus on the items listed in the menu. And treat Buffet items less important.

Conclusion: One must visit this authentic cuisine but I would suggest him / her to go according to the menu.

3. Spacious place, nice interior, food order time 20 min approx.
4. Food is finger licking good. 
Recommendations: Kaju kismis pulao (enough quantity for one), Kachalanka dhonepata murgi, Gondhoraj bhetki (2 pcs/plate), Dhakai pora mangso.
But Dab chingri (8-9 pcs/dab) - very average dish. Better try some other prawn dishes.

Overall I am satisfied with quantity and quality 👌

Disgusting to say the least. Have uploaded the photos for proof as well as people might think I am lying because mostly the reviews are good here. Please do not ever order food online from here. I did the same mistake of ordering food online through zomato here I ordered pabda jhal and they gave padba sorshe with stupid mustard gravy instead! Also I had mentioned specifically to give the pabda fish in 2 separate boxes as I had ordered 2 of them, they did not even bother to do that. The reason I did not cancel was it was late and I was hungry by that time. These people are a bunch of cheats and deserve no applause. Food is pricey and cold, not worth the price at all, in fact too much overpriced for such cheap food. Even if you do order online from here, dont pay by card, order by cash on delivery and when the person delivers the food to your home, do not pay the cash unless you check what they have given in the food because there is a high chance they will dupe you in  online ordering ebcause they very well know there is less chance that you will return it after so much time. They are overcharging, making money as well as making a fool of their own customers, they are spitting on the very plate they get their money from, really shameful to say the least. Do not trust these guys at all. In case the food delivered is wrong or in case you face any problem at the restaurant itself, simply take photos of the food and post the photos along with reviews along with sending it to the food safety department, but DO NOT PAY FOR STALE OR WRONG FOOD THEY GIVE!!  Insist on a third party settling the dispute in case they force you to, because its the nature of these kind of restaurants nowadays to force people for stale food or wrong choice of food given due to the restaurants fault. This is the worst place which is highly overrated simply avoid at all costs.

My First Experience.. Authentic Bengali Food.. Had heard about the Macchar Jhol.. etc.. never tasted.. was wary 😒.. Fish used might be smelly.. 
( we left to our server.. to decide for us.. prawns.. served in fresh green coconut .. sole fish in mustard.. ((( excellent ))) & of course the machar jhol with rice .. ( a little bit of oil can be reduced in the curry ) some crispy parathas too..
Still have the taste.. in memory.. and taste buds .. can recall .. simply.. finger licking good... oh we also had chajj..a little too sweet..

Dropped in for lunch and ordered the following:

39/2 Elgin Road- a great spicy drink.
Pur bhora aachari lonka- crispy on the outside and soft, stuffed with cottage cheese inside.
Rice
Mochar paturi- a bit oily but the mustard flavour hits the right taste bud!
Bhetki paturi- cooked just perfectly on the inside.
Macher matha diye mochar daal- flavour full which best accompanies plain rice
Narkel Posto Bora- crispy, a bit sweet due to the coconut with a hint of chilli
Daab chingri- creamy, soft and smooth
Nolen gur er ice cream- just the perfectt dessert to end a grand lunch on the best note.

The service was a bit slow, but I suppose that was due to an almost full house.

Good place, great food!

Located exactly at the address mentioned in the restaurant's name itself.This outlet is one of those places which serves authentic Bengali cuisine.I went to this place to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and I am really glad that I had chosen this place .I had the best ever lunch so far in my entire life.
Their hospitality and management is top notch.Staffs are well behaved and extremely friendly.
Ambience is very much cosy and homely.
The place is well decorated.They decorated the place in such a way that you will get the old "Bengali" culture in a contemporary way.
Coming to food part we had mangsho kasha,dab chingri,steamed rice and aam chutney.
Dab chingri-It was the Best dish of that day.A must try for all foodies.Medium sized prawns were perfectly cooked in "dab sash" ,cocunut milk and mustard based gravy.Aroma of the dish was so appealing and tastewise it was heavenly.
Kasha mangsho- If you want to have a perfect Mutton kasha then your search is over.This outlet will definitely satisfy your cravings for kansha mangsho. Mutton pieces were So soft and tender that it just melts in your mouth leaving behind a flavour that satisfies your tastebuds to the fullest.
Aam chutney-It was a perfect item to finish our lunch.This dish was also yummy.
They serve dried Misti pan as a complimentary mouth freshner.
Conclusion:-
Decor-5/5
Staffs-5/5
Food-5/5.Actually wanted to give more than that.
Price- obviously on the higher side .But trust me they worth every penny .You will get full value for your money.
P.s.-A must try for all foodies. A highly recommended place to have a perfect lunch.

One of the best Bengali cuisine I have been by far.. I need to put some thought around where to start.. Starting from the luchi and Dal, Apratim to the duck bungalow Mutton. It was all awesome. Both veg and non veg options was awesome. But I must say I missed hilsa. That would really made the buffet complete. I felt a bit low going around the desert table, but what the heck I am not a sweet person.

Undoubtedly one of the best bengali restaurant in Kolkata. Located at a very convenient location in Ballygunge this place is a treat to your belly. Traditionally a very bengali restaurant with its signature dishes of Gandharaj chicken, Kacha lanka dhone pata murgi and many more. The ambience is extremely spacious with an old bengali jamidar mansion theme and the waiters are quite efficient and amicable. The food is top class and is a must visit place for bengali for sure and even for non-bengalies for a feast to their taste buds. Pricing is quite standard but basically for upper middle class people considering the quantity with price.

A superb restaurant to try out with your friends a D family. Beautiful ambience, pretty decor with a hint of bangaliana, nice and helpful staff and most importantly sumptuous Bengali cuisine. 6BP is my fav Bengali joint for a family dinner. It would be a waste to visit 6BP and not tasting their "Daab chingri". You will keep licking your fingers until the end.Please everyone do try the nolen gur er ice cream in dessert section, its a piece of heaven served on a plate. I love the nice and pretty varieties of spread they keep everytime in their buffet. In one word 6BP is awesome. Wonderful experience every time. Will visit again.

Wow! What an experience!! A great buffet!!! Perhaps the best Bengali buffet of the town. Today's (Tuesday) buffet had a decent spread - rice, dal (unbelievably good taste), alu posto, sag bhaja, a superb tomato Bharta, luchI & begun bhaja (both served steaming hot on the table), chanar dalna (another surprisingly good item), fish paturi (a Kapil Dev sixer), doi Murgi - a Ronaldinho free-kick!!!!, and mutton dakbanglo - a Pele goal after outwitting at least four players!!!!! The ubiquitous papad and the otherwise neglected chutney (pineapple with raisins) proved to be a Viv Richards sixer!!!
The sweet curd was the only "sour" item in the menu, literally & figuratively; the chitrakoot, however did justice to the reputation of the joint.
Priced at Rs. 550.00 per person on weekdays, Rs. 600.00 (Sat - lunch), and Rs. 700.00 (Sat- dinner & Sun - lunch and dinner) plus taxes is reasonable to say the least. Prawn is served on both Sat. & Sun.
A good ambience and an excellent service - can one ask for more? Wish some TV anchor-turned restaurant owner took some cue and given her own restaurant a make-over????!!!!

Ambience wise, it is one of the best. But when it comes to food, I did not like it at all. They need to improve the taste of the food. The chhaanch needs to be prepared with more care. The food appeared more like Bengali cuisine western style to me. Dissappointed.

This place has become like a family restaurant. They did the catering for my wedding and I had my first wedding anniversary party at this restaurant as well! Their buffet is amazing as is their a la carte menu. I was blown away by their luchi and potol bhaja, and that was only the starter at the buffet! The food is extremely well prepared and of top notch quality. You must visit this restaurant if you want some high quality bong food, and especially if you are not a permanent resident of Kolkata. The food will absoltely tug at the bangaliana in your heart!

I had a long wish to visit this restro and it got fullfiled at last on 18th September on the occasion of my sister's birthday...

We booked the table 5 days beforehand and so we faced no issues when we reached there.

The interior is nicely decorated with "haat pakha" and the soft melodious tune going on just sets the mood to have a perfect dinner.

We went there for buffet and it had:

Luchi
Begun bhaja
Sada bhaat
Polau
Dhokaar dalna
Daal
Alur dom
Haanser dimer dalna
Shorshe parshe
Murgir jhol
Kosha Mangsho
Chatni
Papor
Misti doi
khirer malpoa
All the items were equally good (the polau was liked by all with no oiliness with just the right amount of ingredients) but the sorshe parshe and Misti doi were my personal favourite.
The staffs were courteous and the food quality was very good.
Overall my experience was very good here and hope to visit this place again..but this time looking forward to their ala-cart-a

This place needs no introduction, their picturesque interiors, bengali themes, bengali background music, polite service and most importantly the food.. Quite evidently 6 Ballygunge place has won over so many hearts in this city of food lovers.
We ordered:
⏺Hansher dimer devil👍👍
⏺Kankrar gal petechi👍👍
⏺Moroger polao👍
⏺Chitol macher muitha👍
⏺Bhuna Mangsho👍
Prices are high, but the awesome lipsmacking Bengali food suffices for that. Will visit again!

Regal bengali food and ambience. 

Thumbs up - Great food, very bengali kind of ambience which is very soothing.  About the food,  we had ordered almost every veg items and some. Non veg items, veg items were really tasty, dint expect from a place which is famous for non veg food,  in non veg we had ordered for Dhone pata chicken ( coriander chicken) bhetki Paturi,  daab chingri and one more fish item which I don't remember the name of it. All were just delicious.  It was light on ur tummy all the spices really blended in to give u a flavourful meal. In the end u get a finger bowl with black tea instead of warm water to rinse of the oil and smell of the food.  A big thumbs up for this unique thing. 

Thumbs down - it's a bit pricy and staff could be more  courteous,  although they were friendly, nothing else to Complain about. 

All in all a very good experience. 

Price for 2 - 1200-1300

After a long, I visited this restaurant again. Last time, the experience was not so great, so I was a bit reluctant to go to this place again. They made me how wrong I was. In a nutshell, the food was delicious.

Tried to book a table, but due to some network issues (maybe mine), I could book one, so we have to wait for 10 minutes to get a table. We went for the a-la-carte menu as getting a buffet table would have taken more time.

The service was good but could have been better. The negative part was that they were bringing the food together, even though we had given them specific instructions.

Rating: 3/5

Ambiance: The place was nicely decorated. They extended the place. Previously, they were only serving on the ground floor. Now, they also open the second floor. I was only missing some classic Bengali songs on the background.

Rating: 3.5/5

Price: The a-la-carte menu is a bit pricey. On the other hand, the buffet menu is quite economic.

Rating: 3.5/5

Food:

We ordered 38/2, Elgin Road, 2/6, Biren Roy Road from the thirst breaker. For the starter, we ordered Gandhoraj Chicken. Next, we ordered Karaishutir Kachuri, Chhaner Dalna. From the main, we tried rice, Kaju Kismis Pulao, Shukto, Dab Chingri, Chitol Maachher Muitha, Kachalanka Dhonepata Murgi. Finally, Nalen Gurer Ice-cream for the dessert.

38/2, Elgin Road: It is a spicy pineapple based juice. I liked the taste. If you want to try something new, then go for it. Waring: It would be very spicy. (4/5)

The other mocktail was average.

Karaishutir Kachuri (Peas stuffed pooris) was served hot. Nicely done. Another recommended dish. (4/5)

We tried chhaner dalna with the kachuri, but it was not a hit. Channa served in a red curry with potatotes. The curry was lack of taste. (2/5)

Sukhto was nicely done. (4/5)

Dab chingri was good. 8-9 pieces of prawns served inside a daab (coconut). The green color was full of flavors. All the ingredients were mixed properly, so none of them was overpowering each other. (4.5/5)

I was excited about the chitol maachher muitha because that was the fiirst time I had it. To me, the taste was average. This is the dish for which I can die for.I liked the chicken preparation. 6-7 small pieces of chicken prepared in dhonepata and kacha lanka. (4.5/5)

Pulao was also delicious. (4.5/5)

The dishes of the night were ghondoraj chicken and the ice-cream. I should not say anything, you have to go and try it yourself.

Bon appetit!!!

Overly expensive. Food is also not so great. In our case, they served cold foods. They only have some mouth-watering name on their menu but items are not so tasty. Per head cost approx Rs800+. Better to try buffet (though I never tried it here). Service is quite well. But again foods are not up to the mark.

A regular place for office lunch parties, this is my favourite Bengali Cuisine restaurant in Kolkata. They have both Ala carte and Buffet options and we mostly take buffets as its easier to manage in big team size.

The ambiance is Beautiful and give you a very traditional feel. Its basically a stand alone bungalow converted into a restaurant.

The Buffets have every possible classic Bengali dish in the spread. Fish, Mutton, Chicken, Shukto, Baigan Bhaja, Luchi etc. If you  get Mutton Dakbangla on the day you go, consider urself lucky. Daab chingri is not a part of Buffet but we always order it separately. You cannot go to this place and not have Daab Chingri.

Sweets will mostly have Mishti Dohi, Rasogulla (fixed) and a malpua or another dessert which keeps changing.

Definitely a recommend from my end..

People can be found sampling delicious Bengali dishes during Durga Puja .  From snacks to sweet dishes, Bengali food has something to offer all food enthusiasts. If you’re in Kolkata in this Durga Puja, you cannot miss the authetic bengali Food from 6 Ballygunge Place .This Place located at Ballygunge .This place is one of its kind for the ambiance and experience which one can feel there. 6 Ballygunge Place serves amazing Bengali food along with a private dine in experience.I was there on an evening with Team Panchphoron to attend their Durga Puja food menu launch and was amazed to see the interiors. Typical bengali vibe. We tried few of the things from the menu.

Want to experience the perfect Bengali cuisine? Then look no further, this is the place to be. 

Though there are limited options for vegetarians but Aloo Posta, Daal and Radha Ballavi with Rice will satiate your hunger in the best way possible. 

Recommendation: It is okay to use your hands instead of cutlery to eat. No one is judging.

Experienced Bengali hospitality but will prefer ala carte over buffet

Quality of service: Good and prompt culminates with butler's suggestions if you are unsure based on queries and prodding of your culinary tastes make you feel at home. 

Ambience: Experience traditional setup and ambience and a clean surroundings. Tables for 4 are a bit crunch.

Food: Will prefer specific Ala Carte items over Buffet.
Fish fry and fish orly tasted great, you could taste the freshness of fish and contents and crunchy bites confirmed the proficiency of cooking. But will prefer specific Ala Carte items over Buffet - especially Pathuri (steamed Fish item) and Pathar Mangsho (Goat mutton) was especially out of favour with me ---not sure if that was unfortunate for that specific day..

Overall:  Good - Enjoy your food in peace, to your taste and with hospitality.

I think there is enough written about it's ambience. I.ll stick to it's food quality .
We ordered 
1. Dhonepata kachalonka chicken 
2. Lal murgi
3. Dab chingri
4. Bhekti paturi
5. Badshahi pulao
6. Prawns pulao
7. Luchi
8. Aam porar shorbat. 

Every item was absolutely delicious. Special mention has to go to the pulao items, perhaps the best pulao I have ever tasted. Al though the quantity of dhonepata kachalonka chicken was not quite what I hoped for but still it tasted great. 
In case you are looking for a restaurant to introduce your friend to Bengali cuisine, I highly recommend this place. I am certain everyone will have a very fulfilling experience.

I visited during Puja. The restaurant is quiet spacious and well organized. Also well decorated with some cool antique stuffs. Coming to food, bengali cuisine is something to die for. We had gondhoraj chicken for the starters which was tasty. In the main course we had manghshor polao,bhetki paturi,daab chingri, dhonepata kachalonka chicken. The daab chingri dish just blew my mind off. It was a dish to die for. Paturi was also good. Polao and chicken dish was average.

Being a pure bred bangali, I rarely opt for a Bengali cuisine restaurant when eating out because that's what we eat everyday at home. But made an exception for my mum's bday and took out my parents for a dinner at this place. I must say I didn't regret the decision at all!
Ambience-- very classy and makes you feel royal.
Order-- drink-aam pora shorbot,
Starters--mourala machher peyaji, gondhoraj chicken, mains--chicken er tramfado, kosha mangsho (mutton) along with porota and bhaat.
Dessert--nolen gurer ice cream.
Food-- exceptional! The gondhoraj chicken was one of the best fusion of chicken and lime I've ever had.
Kosha mutton with porota is every bengali's dream dish and I'm no exception. And the taste didn't disappoint at all.
Mourala macher peyaji was a pleasant surprise. I didn't know what to expect from the dish but I'm so glad we ordered it cuz it's a bomb of flavors! Do give it a try guys.
The best of the day was the nolen gurer ice cream. 1 spoonful and you're transported to heaven. Seriously.
The only dish I didn't like is the chicken tramfado. I just didn't like the taste of it.
Pocket pinch- around 2600 INR
overall-- yes it's a bit on the costlier side but I think they deliver in accordance with the price. If you're in a mood to try out Bengali cuisine this restaurant might be just what you're looking for.

Went their to celebrate my sister' birthday! don't know about their À la carte menu but the buffet was literally disappointing. My aunt selected this place on the basis of recent exaggerated promotions in magazines. But trust me, if someone is really willing to have a bengali buffet lunch or dinner - Oh! calcutta is a solo champion in the field. What this place has compromised is 'Quality'. The buffet menu is limited and there is no seperate starter and main course section. It began with rice, pulao and dal, which was the most let down part. 
The menu options available were - rice, peas pulao, dal, illish mach with kochur shag, echor dalna & aloor dum (both of them were bland and horrible), tangra macher jhol, chicken curry (hard and not satisfactory), mutton kosha, mishti doi and a type of sandesh. Among them only - tangra macher jhal and mutton kasha are mention worthy.
However, the decor was quite decent one! the outlook of the building resembles somewhat around Bengali Bonedi bri. They also used some antique show pieces and music systems for furnishing which seemed quite appealing.
Anyways, want to try out some of their signature à la carte dishes in the near future.

I went there with my parents for lunch. We , since long , wanted to have buffet there and order  DAAB CHINGRI (their speciality) in ala carte. So accordingly , we had buffet which included a wide variety of items to choose from . Each and every dish was delicious and had BANGALIANA feels in it but for me special mention should be made of the FISH KABIRAJI , HARIYALI CHICKEN and obviously the DAAB CHINGRI , they were special <3. The orderlies there were very cooperative and cordial . The interior decor is majestic and the ambience is very calm and soothing with a soft music playing in the background. 

All in all we had a pleasant family time there and were content .

We visited this place on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Since we didn't have prior table booking had to wait half an hour, but the ambience and decoration of the place more than makes up for the waiting time! It's beautifully decorated giving a feel of the quintessential Bengali heritage ! We had our meal upstairs which also has a pleasant and soothing decor.
We ordered luchi, radhaballabi, cholar dal along with Pur bhora achari Lanka(3pcs) and chal kumro narkel sorshe dye bhaja (6pcs) and bati chochori along with steamed rice ! We had to order these veg items since I was with a Tamil friend who didn't eat non veg !
The waiting time is a bit high but the food more than makes up for it, the staff are courteous and polite and eager to serve you !

Unable to resist the urge of non veg, I ordered doi murgi (4pcs) which was excellent ! We finished our meal with a misti doi which was pretty good !
The cost is a bit on the higher side and a thousand bucks for two people for a average meal ,a lac carte is a must !

Highly recommend : Pur bhora achari Lanka , Doi murgi

N.B. Steamed rice 1plate will more than enough for 2 people (I was about to order 2 plates, the waiter advised against it, a big thank you ! ) & the last order for lunch should be placed before 3.30pm

Been there for an invitation. We had buffet dinner there. First of all, their sitting arrangement is not fit for buffet. Food is good but very few items in menu. Particularly the dessert section was very lean. Also the staffs were very reluctant to fill up the finished items. Considering the pocket pinch, not at all a good experience.

Definitely the best Bengali buffet in town. Especially on Sundays. With everything a Bengali craves for on a sunday, starting from bhetki maacher paaturi to chicken to mutton, roshogolla, mishti doi, the whole package. Luchi and torkari tops it off. And the decor is absolutely stunning, with all the Bengali feels.

Awesome food. Lovely ambience. Very polite staff. A great place for Bengali food lovers and also it restores the Babu Culture of Bengal from the previous years of Bengal. We went for the buffet. It had:-

1. A ghol or kind of lassi.
It was the welcome drink and tasted good. Though having it upfront killed our hunger and therefore we weren't able to eat everything properly.
2. Luchi.
3. Begun Bhaja.
4. Aloor Dum.
It was not very good as it tasted very plain.
5. Basmati Rice.
It was great and properly cooked.
6. Shaak Bhaja.
7. Kumro Bhaat-e.
It was also very plain and dull in taste.
6. Paanch Mishali Daal.
7. Mangsher Chop.
It was lovely.
8. Pabda r Jhaal.
The quality of the fish was great and the gravy was good too.
9. Murgi r Jhol.
10. Morich Mangsho.
Obviously it had mutton and the meat was cooked to extreme tenderness. I personally loved how tender it was and the gravy was spicy and exciting too.
11. Aamshotyo Khejoor er Chutney.
12. Papad.
13. Chom chom.
14. Mishti Doi.
It was probably one of the best mishti doi's in Kolkata. It was chilled and after that heavy meal, tasted heavenly.

Overall a great experience. A must visit for Bengali food lovers.

P.S. Loved how hygienic and clean the whole place was.

Absolutely loved the place. Decor is beautiful with unique wall papers and painted chairs in every room- yeah they have multiple seating halls. Menu is extensive and explained nicely. Food is mouth watering. Their buffet is a great value deal. But be mindful that buffet doesn't have Hilsa to offer. You got to go for alacarte if you have specifically come to enjoy Hilsa. Their hilsa prep is also extremely good.

I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good Bengali meal or anyone new who is not sure whether to go for amazing lip smacking Bengali food. I would recommend kosha mangsho, hanser deem er dalna, prawn Malai Curry, doing murgy, ilish mach paturi, bhetki fry, daab chingri, some parantha and have plain rice with any fish item. Chenaar malpoya and nolen gur ice cream in desserts..

The buffet had lots of variety. The price is also very pocket friendly. It cost approximately 1145 for two on weekdays. Each and every item was extremely delicious. We loved the chicken specially. From starters to dessert it was heaven. We are looking forward to go there again.

Who says people won't bong food outside in the city of Kolkata. 6BP is the exception, varieties of options to choose from and great taste of food. 
The drinks are named as per the streets of Kolkata and it's fun to choose your pick. On the main course, a must try is daab Chingri. Worth mentioning is the interior of this place. 
A must try place in city of joy!

6 ballygunge place has firmly established itself as a trusted specialist in Bengali cuisine and over the years they have a developed a large and loyal customer base.

We dropped by today and after a testing wait time of 45 minutes we were shown our tables. The place may seem crowded but that's because of the insane demand for this place; the waiters and management were prompt and courteous....

We tried their buffet spread where we pleasantly surprised by the wonderful Chingrir jhaal and dhone chicken...

The dhone chicken gravy was a delight and the prawns were done just right.....

The mangsher jhol was good but nothing extraordinary...the mutton was extremely well cooked.

For desert they served mishti doi, shondesh, malpo and chutney....

All in all a pretty decent spread for 650 plus taxes...

Kudos, 6 Ballygaunge place....

A must try place if you are in Kolkata. Authentic Bengali cuisine taste personified in their food that we ordered. We ordered Aloo Poshto (rating 5), macher mata diye daal (3.5), Doi Hilsa (4.5) and Koi machher jhol (5). However it was the crab which was out of the world. I would also have mention of about the hospitality, it would 100 out of 100. When we visited the restaurant there a renowned bengali actress who along with her entourage was also in the restaurant, however the restaurant staff  paid equal amount of attention.

Starter Chalkumro was good. alur dom not to the mark, it was like without onion garlic potato curry. Ordered chital peti ( piece doesn't justify the price) it was not peti (Bengali cut) taken portion of backside. Tel koi suppose to be very oily rich dish. No oil found. Healthy not healthy no argument , but taste was not good. Bhetki paturi and Dab chingri was ok . Biulir Dal with Chingri better not to try it was very ordinary. 
Apart from food ambience was good. Old Kolkata style. Bill was near about 4k for 4 people. Ofc not upto the mark.

The best Bengali food place in Kolkata. Without a shade of doubt. The gobsmacking delicacies of Daab Chingri and Ilish Bhapa are my personal favorites. Ideal for a family outing consisting of a gastronomical delight. The decor is meticulously taken care of. Location is also of the best order. The only drawback would be a pocket pinch, but good food is never cheap. So, that's a negotiation one needs to undertake.

Definitely one of my favourites for Bengali cuisine. 
I was hugely impressed with 6 Ballygunge place after their renovation. They redecorated the entire house to convert it into a restaurant which depicts a common Bengali household. The various intricacies of the restaurant is what impressed me the most , with attention to details to everything from the floors, ceilings , wall , chairs and tables. 
Their service is also on point , all the waiters and managers are courteous. 
The menu is extensive and gives the guests a wide range to choose from. 
They named their mocktails after the names of the streets in Kolkata , which was very innovative. 
Coming to the food , we ordered Bengali fish fry , chholar daal , bhapa bhetki, tel koi , kasha mangsho, ilish paturi and loochi . 
Everything on the menu that we ordered was delicious (my favourite being the fish fry) ! The presentation is also great. The only slightly disappointing dish was bhapa bhetki . It was slightly bland for our taste buds. 
For desserts, their Nolen Gur ice cream is a MUST try!

I always enjoy going to this place. And for the quality that they give, the price is also very reasonable and doesnt burn a hole in your pocket. 
This place is a MUST if you are visiting Kolkata, not just for the food but also for their architecture.

(I would also recommend a la carte over buffet)

It had been quite sometime since I have wanted to visit this quintessential representative of authentic bengali cuisine.We dropped for a quick lunch and ordered Aam Porar shorbot,Gondhoraj Chicken,Kaju Kismis Pulao,Murgir Jhol and Baked Mihidana with Rabdi.The ambience is authentic,and perfectly compliments the food that reminds one of a typical mouth-watering Sunday meal in a Bangali bari. :) Special mentions : Gondhoraj Chicken,-a perfect starter of fried julienne chicken strips infused with the aroma of Gondhoraj lebu.
Baked Mihidana with Rabdi: Served hot and yummy,absolute treat for people with a sweet tooth.

Only recommendation from my side would be to reduce the serving time if possible,since that is a problem in case of time constraints and makes one consider the Buffet as a better option.

Well if in ur heart there is craving for bong food. Then it is d best place where u can quench ur thirst... I was unable to find its location when one of their employee helped me out over phone. When I reached d place no seats were available... We were waiting for the seat.. When I got the seat  i though the quantity I do eat, is really meagre, so I didn't choose the buffet version.. We ordered rice, dab chingri , lal murgi, vetki paturi, hilsa and misti doi.. All were superb... Chicken was spicy and juicy...I feel vetki paturi could be better, because there was less salt according to my tastebuds.. But dab chingri was just fabulously awesome... I will always remember this savour of daab chingri.. And the hilsa paturi was also competing with dab chingri.. That was a win win situation for our stomach.😝. Well last but not the least let me tell about the misti doi and its creamy texture.. Aha.. What a lunch.. Just bliss..we thought to take bhapa doi. But tummy was full..  The staffs were so cooperative.. Their behaviour must attract u too.. It will force u to visit this place again and again..😘😘💖💖

A white and grey house surrounded by a few trees. As we reached the place the guard gave us a warm welcome.We chose their buffet instead of a la carte in the lunch.The buffet comprised of-

1. Sada bhaat
2. Green peas diye Moong Dal
3. Palang saak bharta
4. Loochi
5. Macher dimer Bora
6. Bhendi masala
7. Fish Paturi
8. Murgir Jhol
9. Morich Mangso
10. Khajoor aamsattya chutney
11. Papad
12. Chanar malpoa
13. Misti Doi.

A 13 course meal. Simply awesome. Limited number of food items but each having its uniqueness. If you haven't been there till now then please don't waste any more time reading this review of mine. Book an uber. Give them an opportunity to serve you. I am sure you will enjoy it.

I was there on 28th Dec.It was special week for christmas and upcoming new year.So the good thing was that special buffet menu and the bad was crowd.waited approx 20 minute in the desk which was beautifully decorated.Now the menu,every item was delicious.At first they welcomed by dettol hand sanitizer then 'gondhoraj lebur shorbot',then luchi and begun bhaja.The main menu contained,as much as i can remember,fish finger,aloor dum,plain rice,kaju kishmish pulao,parshe mach,one prawn preparation,dahi chicken,mutton,2 types chutney,baked rosogolla and malpua,and paan.The staffs were good,asking if food was ok or if we need anything else.Cost was a bit high due to special menu,approx 1600+ for two with vat.Wish to visit there soon.

Awesome experience... Visited this place this month only on the ocassion of my father's birthday. Opted for buffet, people i can say u will blown away with food n also it is an umlimited buffet with fish,prawn,mutton and chicken. Ambience of the restaurant, you wl feel like a jamindar having bengali food. I went on Sunday. Now coming to the food part. 
Buffet menu was Aam pora sarbat(welcome drink), Fish Kabiraji (starter) with kashundi present at buffet counter, Luchi and begun bhaja (served at table), kumro bhate, saag bhaja, basmati steamed rice, peas pulao, moong dal, alur dam, potol alu posto, parshe macher jhal, chingri malai curry, chicken kasa, mutton jhol, papad, khejur aamsotto chutney, misti dahi, sandesh, malpua and last bt nt the least pan masala. Ufff over with the mouth watering menu. 
Now coming to taste of the authentic bengali cuisine as claimed by the restaurant. Aam pora sorbot mmmmmmmmmmmmmm, loving n refreshing taste. Luchi , begun bhaja and alu dam served hot and tasty. Fish kabiraji ufffff what a taste, fish quality was superb, original bhetki and well fried. No smell but just oily. Rice, dal, posto perfect taste of bengali gharana. Kumro bharta and saag bhaja thk thak taste. Now coming to parshe jhaal, the size of parshe too good, taste of the fish just no words and the way it was cooked nothing to say. Fish was well fried and then cooked in mustard paste, jhaal in bengali. The taste of the gravy was perfect not too spicy and not too blunt kust perfect. Then chingrimacher malai curry aha aha aha aha what a taste of the gravy, superb, perfect blend of masalas. Then chicken kasa extremely good taste and the color of the kasa oh my god by seeing u will fall in love. Mutton jhol was ok ok not that extra ordinary and mutton could have been cooked a little bit more then we would have enjoyed as bengalis do. 
Nie dessert part: chutney masah allah what a taste just one spoon n u wl be lost, dahi also with the matha yummyyy, sandesh also light n nice and then malpua. Malpua was little sweeter and was not so comfortable, bt taste wise ok. And lastly the masala pan u get.
After having all these just u need a bed and deep sleep.
Great experience will visit again.
A suggestion if u want to opt for buffet them reserve ur seat prior it will be easier for u people as u dnt hv to stand in queue then during lunch hour rush.
Also u can try a-la-carte daab chingri, ilish bhapa, chingri cuttlet, chittol macher muitha.

The buffet section is very weak. Hardly any variety and variation. Same old menu. If you are planning for a lunch buffet, make sure to call the restaurant beforehand and check their menu. It will be handy, considering their floating menu.

The place was recommended by a friend and also was suggested by zomato... Reached for dinner... Amazing weather with heavy rains... We ordered Bhetki jhal, masala aloo dum, baigan bhaja, aam kasundi bhindi, moong mohan dal, steaming rice and puri... The food was served fast and piping hot... The taste of every dish was so varied and unique... And as they say not only food matters but the ambience too... A beautiful house turned into a restaurant, with superb paintings from Mamoni Chitrakar, haanth pankhas, Victorian styled furniture and a very courteous and polite staff.. a good evening...

We went there to celebrate my sister's anniversary.. we reserved tables for the timing 2:30 to 4.. all of us reached by 2.. we chatted a bit outside.. took pics etc etc.. finally we were given the table at 2:30..
It seemed like a traditional home rather than a restaurant.. the first 2 storeys had been turned into a restaurant.. it has won many awards even.. place was beautifully decorated with painting and lamps.. we finally settled down.. first came a bowl with lemons.. next aam pora shorbot.. it was thick and tangy.. followed by phulko luchis.. on the buffet were alu dim and dhokar dalna to go with it.. begun bhaja was also there.. sadly am allergic to brinjal.. dhokar dalna was really good.. soft Dhoka in thick gravy with peas.. however the alu dam wasn't quite upto the mark.. it was a bit sour.. maybe coz of too much tomatoes.. there were plain rice and kishmish rice present.. and papda, chingri, chicken and mutton.. papda and mutton deserves a special praise.. mutton was so soft it melted in the mouth.. papda was fresh and damn tasty.. there was a huge demand for chingri.. it was getting over as soon as it came.. but I didn't find chingri that tasty.. I am not so fond of sweet dishes but I quite liked the Mishti doi.. malpua was too sweet.. I didn't like it was all.. overall a must visit restaurant for good Bengali cuisine..

We arranged for a family get together for celebrating my brother and sister-in-law's marriage anniversary. We booked tables for 21 of us. It was a great get together with the bengali cuisine adding to the ocassion.
 We went for the buffet which comprised of a grand 19 items. Aamporar Shorbat was the welcome drink followed by luchi , begun bhaja and kumro chetki. Piping hot luchi and begun baja were too good...simply lip smacking. The veg items were dhoka , dal with rice and puloa. 
The lavish non veg spread of mangshor chop, parsher jhal,chicken and mutton curry is simply too good to be true.Each items were exemplary with the mutton and prawn been outstanding.
The sweet dishes were sandesh, misti doi and hot
 malpao.Malpoa was simply out of this world.
An absolutely outstanding afternoon with family and great food.
The only reason of giving 4.5 and not 5 was because the demand of prawns was so high that they were a bit slow in filling up the buffet tray.
A special mention for the manager for his extremely courteous behaviour and interaction.
A truly classic place to visit with family.

Cool decor, excellent location, cordial staff, comfortable seating and good food at reasonable prices..what more does one want?

We went for a Saturday lunch buffet..big group of 15 people with 3 vegetarians. The luchi begun bhaja starter was the perfect start to our sumptuous meal. Aloo dum was also there to accompany the fluffy luchis. Fish chop and mochar chop are the other appetizers which were not impressive. Main course consisted of chhanar dalna, saag bhaja, pabda sorshebata, murgi aam-kasundi, mutton curry. For the vegetarian friends additional dishes of patol dolma, bhindi mustard we're provided. Mishti doi and baked rosogolla for dessert. 
Mutton curry and chhanar dalna were made to perfection. Both were soft and succulent. Entices you too indulge more and more...kalmi saag (morning Glory) fried with garlic was very homely ....

We had heard so much about this place, went for a family dinner out, opted for the buffet. I must say the choice was pretty limited. Tastes and overall quality was just average. Most of the well publicised items were not available in the buffet spread. We were certainly disappointed. Felt the place is a bit hyped up.

Nothing can replace Mayer hater ranna when it comes to Bengali cuisines, but if something comes next to it, it's 6 Ballygunge place. The decor and ambience have an old school charm. Previously tried their buffet lunch couple of years back, and liked it. This time went for a la carte. Ordered 1/1 bishop lefroy road ( the name itself was so irresistible), mourala macher peyaji, bhat, chhanar dalna, chitol maacher muithya and chhanar malpoa. The dishes are delicious. The service was fast, staff were well mannered. Price was reasonable.

Awsome place..and awsome gesture..
They greeted us with a huge choclate cake..which i cut to celebrate. Then i opted for the grand bengali buffet.
It is the most pocket friendly buffet with variety items..
Was a bit dissapointed with the dessert section...
As it was not so good..
But other delicacies were great in taste..❤
It worth the visit..
The buffet costs 645 around including taxes.
It includes awsomw bengali  dishes.

We went on a Thursday night and we opted for dinner buffet. The buffet included luchi, begun bhaja, aloor dom,chapor ghonto,mutton curry,hasher dim er torkari,chicken gravy,fish paturi,veg pulao,plain rice,mishti doi,chom chom,chatni, papad.For the veg options they prepare it whatever you order from their designated menu.For mocktails we went for amporar shorbot,virgin mojito.The ampora was really thick and refreshing.If you go on weekends the buffet will be little more vast like including prawns,etc.The quality of the food was really nice.The ambience is posh as well as ethnic.We were 16 of us so they gave us a whole room,that was really helpful.Because when there is a gathering the sound will rise up to 1 level more😁.. so in all .. 
Food-4 
Ambience -4 
One suggestion - they should include payesh or ice cream in the desserts,that will add to the taste!😃

প্রত্যাশা আর উত্তেজনা,
 
এইখানে আসার আগে এই দুটো জিনিস আমাকে আছন্ন করে তুলেছিল।
 
রবিবারের বারবেলায় হাজির হলাম।

 দেওয়াল জুড়ে অপরুপ চিত্রশিল্প।
 
বাঙালিয়ানা আর সাবেকিয়ানার ধারক ও বাহক। 

একরাশ মুগ্ধতা নিয়ে বুফে- যাত্রা শুরু হল। 

স্টাফদের ব্যবহার প্রসংসার যোগ্য।

 কিন্তু বুফে-তে খাবারের তালিকা বেশ ছোট।
 
গরম গরম ফুলকো লুচি দিয়ে খাবার পরিবেশন শুরু হল।

 শ্বেত-শুভ্র লুচি অহমিকা ও দম্ভে স্ফিত।
 
সংগে আড়াই হাতের সরু মুচমুচে বেগুনভাজা।

 লুচির প্রেম-সান্নিধ্যে থাকা বেগুনভাজা মুখ-গহরে গলে গেল।
 
খাসির মাংসের সাথে লুচির বন্ধুত্ব স্থাপনে ব্যর্থ হলাম। মাংস আরো সেদ্ধ হত। 

একটু শক্ত। এখানকার পোলাও-এ হলুদের ব্যবহার নেই।
 
গুরুপাক নয়। একমুখ সারল্য।
 
ডাল-আলুর দম র সাথে পোলাও রবীন্দ্র সংগীতের মতই স্নিগ্ধ।
 
পারশে মাছের ঝাল ভাল কিন্তু আহামরি নয়। 

ধনেপাতা মুরগি সুন্দর। হাল্কা ধনেপাতার গন্ধের সাথে সুসিদ্ধ মুরগির মাংস ভালই সুসম্পর্ক।

 পিস গুলো বেশ বড়।
 
কিন্তু হৃদয় কেড়ে নিল গলদা-চিংড়ির মালাইকারি।

 বেশ সুস্বাদু। অসাধারণ। 

শেষ পাতে মিষ্টি সাধারন।

পান্তুয়াতে মিষ্টির আধিক্য স্বাদতন্ত্রকে হতাশ করল। 

ভাল লাগল কিন্তু অসাধারন লাগল না।

 প্রত্যাশা পূরনে কিছুটা হলেও ব্যর্থ।

দুপুরের খাওয়া শুরু হল সাদা ফুলকো লুচি আর বেগুনভাজা দিয়ে। তারপর ভাত, বড়িভাজা দিয়ে কলমিশাক,গাজর-ফুলকপি-মটরশুঁটি দিয়ে মুগডাল। সাথে ছিল আলুর দম। তারপর ময়দানে নামল ভেটকী মাছের পাতুরী। তিন টুকরো মুর্গীর মাংস খেলাম- দুর্দান্ত স্বাদ। এরকম চিকেন বহুদিন মনে থাকবে। আর খাসীর মাংস।চাটনী পাঁপড় তো ছিলই। মন মাতাতে আসরের শেষ লগ্নে ছিল বেকড রসগোল্লা।সবশেষে প্রান জুড়িয়ে দিল মিষ্টিদই।

A welcome place for Bengali cuisine lovers but service is not good at all. 

Went there with friends on Eid. Took the Buffet. Ambience and decor were pretty good, in-line with a 'bangali' theme. A special mention for Bhetki Paturi and Chingri Malaikari. Not many options in the dessert section. An addition of Mishti Doi (chilled) in the dessert menu of Buffet would be welcome as it is considered a traditional Bengali dessert. 

The biggest con is the behaviour of service staff. They seemed to be in a hurry of vacating the table. Kept asking repeated times whether we are done or not !! It was really annoying. 

My rating - 3/5

Verdict - Visit the place surely if u want to indulge urself in Bengali delicacies. 

Recommendation for the restaurant - improve the quality of service, try to be a little patient with customers.

Heard about this place many a times but wasn't fortunate enough to visit . So I and a friend decided to explore the heritage restaurant on Monday to get rid off the blues.. 
Not very easy to locate if you don't live in that area . We entered a white building while the gatekeeper welcomed us . As soon as we entered it felt as if I am in a " RajGharana " of the Zamindars . The decor and the interiors were so much on point . Quickly we were escorted to our tables and we chose to have a sumptuous Bengali buffet. The first thing I loved was that we were given scented icy towels to refresh ourselves from the heat . And next we started our #Bhuribhoj . We were served Potol Bhaja and Gorom Luchi on the table. 
Next , we tried everything in the minimal spread but the dishes that amazed me were : 

Begun Basundi 5/5
Parshe Jhol 4/5
Bharta 4/5
Lal Murgi 4/5
Chhanar Malpua 5/5
Aam Doi 5/5 

Value for Money : 4/5 ( They should add some more dishes to the spread ) 

Recommended :)

It was during the Hilsa Festival sometime back that we had ordered some preparations of the fish from this famous Bengali Restaurant. They had claimed that they wait for the monsoon to strike so that they can get the best quality fish, before commencing the festival . However our experience showed quite the reverse. The fish which was heavily expensive ( you pay 5-7 times the money you'd pay for a piece of fish in the market ) was not upto the mark when it comes to the quality. Being a Bengali and enjoying the delicacy since the beginning years , one cannot be hoodwinked when it comes to the quality of his beloved fish. We get far better Hilsa at the local markets in Kolkata. Coming to the preparations the fry filled with boneless fish tasted nice , and the jhol with the 'lou doga' ( gourd plant) bits in it tasted alright , though a bit mild. However nothing can meet up for the quality of the fish and that too at such an exorbitant price !!

P.S. - Had attended wedding functions where 6 Ballygunge Place did the food catering , fairly dissapointed with that too !

This was suggested by my bengali friend and it was worth going to this place.
Food is amazing, the ambience is nice and the service is good.
The interiors are done perfectly and going with the theme and feel of kolkata
Loved this place. Would visit it for sure whenever I come to Kolkata again.

Hugely disappointing! Went for a lunch buffet.... But I was informed that there are no starters in the buffet. Stayed unattended for a long while with no one in sight. Later I was informed that I need to start with the main course.... Which again had very, very, very few choices. Just one mutton, fish and chicken item, along with rice and Dal. Is that all there is to at the lunch buffet. The welcome drink of aam ras or whatever it was... was never served. A roadside Dhaba would offer more choices than this place. No prawns or crab in the lunch buffet. And they are supposed to be serving authentic bengali food! Have to give it one star for there's no option for a half... Avoid it if you can....

I have had this restaurant on the list for quite sometime now. Last time i went it was under renovation. So this time when i got to know from a friend that they have reopened i had to make a stop. We went there as group of 5. The waiter greeted us and showed the way to our table. The upscale ambience with touch of nostalgia was the perfect blend of tradition and modern. Then the welcome drink was served at the table. We had the buffet and it had quite a diverse range of dishes. All authentic bengali cuisine.  The luchi was served at the table. And then the buffet began. The shorshe parshe, doi murgi and mutton was all delicious. The baked rosogolla was the icing on the cake. Overall nice ambience, good food and full value for money!!

1. Dab chingri made me sleepless with its taste..see my first pic ..Do go there and taste it with some hot rice ..it will be once in a lifetime experience i bet

2. For Starters we ordered prawn cutlets and it was awesome

3. Fish curry was excellent and a chicken dish that was wrapped in a mustard leaf....both were heart melting but i don't remember their names

Service is good.. Needless to mention...and a must visit...

When you are in Kolkata...you should not miss out on authentic Bengali cuisine. 6 Ballygunge Place is one the best places if you want to have a taste of Bengali food. 

They have both options of a sumptuous buffet as well as a la carte. Sadly for us, we took the buffet instead of a la carte. 
 Full marks on ambience and service of the staff. 

The buffet was a limited yet delightful spread(only for non vegetarians). Sadly if you are a vegetarian..you should better order from the a la carte menu. 

Great place for seafood and fish delicacies and all things nonveg. Vegetarians should think twice if u don't end up only aloo

There food is not so much up to the mark except ilish fish curry. Specially veg dishes not up to the mark. I took buffet so I can eat all type of dishes. Start with luchi and veg dishes. Luchi is not so good and alur dum alu is not boiled inside. Bata fish jhal in there no taste found. Sag I ate I would like to ask what exactly they cooked. Only dai ilish was good but the charge they took for 2 piece its too much. If you took mineral water they charged 50rs where MRP is only 20Rs how could they charge that much I didn't know. After GST implemented nobody will go outside for lunch or dinner. Sitting arrangement like if you carry any bag u have to put in the floor. So you can understand how they loot the people on their brand name. Waiter will not come when you need. So wait ..And u will fall in sleep.

A quintessential place for having the best bangali food.This place is just 5 mins away from Bijon Setu and locating the place is not at all an arduous job.The place gives you a feeling of an old Calcutta Bengali house.The interior is ethereal and you will just spend few minutes to admire the place, as soon as you enter.I'm a person who is highly meticulous about interiors and this place has just won my heart.They served aam pora shorbot in earthen glasses while we were waiting for our table.The shorbot was chilled,tangy and yummy.
Now,we went on Poila Baishakh for a buffet lunch.I was totally impressed with their spread of various bangali dishes.Every typical and famous bangali dish was in the buffet.It started with bhaat,aloo bhaja,kochuri,aloo dum,jhinge posto,kumro ful er bora,macch er chop,pulao,sona mugh daal etc and ended with non veg dishes like aam kasundi chicken,dhakai mangsho,golda chingri er curry.There was so much that, I even forgot the names of many dishes.The dessert was no less.There was chitrokoot,patisapta,butter scotch sandesh,aam er chatni,papad and the most famous misti doi. Though the patisapta was not good as it was a bit under-cooked,but altogether the food was great.
The only problem was with the waiters.They were not executing tasks quickly.I asked a waiter to get a finger bowl,but in spite of nodding yes,I saw him standing idle.The plates for the desserts were not available and they took ages to get a plate and spoon for me. In fact, the floor manager got them for me.The floor manager was an efficient guy.
I will definitely visit the place again and I would recommend others to visit this place too.

My 2nd review of the day:

28th May 2017 will be long cherished for me as this is the date I gave treat to my and my extended family a grand treat with my own money for the first time in this particular place.

Food: 5 on 5. If you are having a la carte here ,then hardly there would be any item which is not good. We tried a lot of items from prawn to chicken to mutton to fish along with polao and paratha and hansher dimer devil. To sum it up nolen gurer icecream was heaven on earth.

Ambience: 4.5.. Deducted half marks because the ac is never chilled here. When you need a table fan in addition to ac to cool yourself,that means there is some problem.

Service: It was not at all expected that 6 ballygunj place would let me down as it did. I ordered many things to be packed up and they forgot to add the prawn cutlet for which I had paid. They remembered when I Crossed park circus. I had to return back to pick the item. 3 on 5 maybe.

This pure Bengali restaurant is located at 6, Ballygunge place , Ballygunge where one would find pure Bangaliana in terms of food, ambience and decoration.

Ambience - Serene ambience with a Bengali ' Bonedi Bari ' touch, sophisticated and classy . Wall pictures, lanterns, Hathpakha , designer plates , soothing music etc were totally enchanting. This place is quite spacious too.

Staffs & Service - Staffs were well trained and service was nice 

We Panchphoron team went on a food tasting session to try out their V- Day special Thali.


V-Day Special Thali @ 6 Ballygunge Place
Where: 6 BP (Ballygunge and Salt Lake) 

When: February 14, 12.30pm-3.30pm, 7pm-10.30pm

Highlights: A Bengali meal that includes Chicken Kabiraji, Radhavallavi, Aloor Dum, Aloo Jhinge Posto, Garlic Bhapa Bhetki, Chingri Malai Curry and Kosha Mangsho.

Review - All the items were authentic, well cooked as it should be and tasty. 

Foodie's  top picks - 

1)Chicken Kobiraji - Kabiraji cutlet is made of fish, meat or chicken, crumb coated and then deep fried and covered with a lacy net coating of egg batter. It was crispy outside, juicy inside and yummy.

2) Aloo Dum- It was thick, rich, flavourful and lipsmacking.

3)Garlic Bhapa Bhetki- It had an awesome flavour and it melted in the mouth within no time.

4)Chingri Malaikaari - Chingri malai curry also known as Prawn malai curry, is a Bengali curry made from prawns and coconut milk and flavoured with spices. It was very palatable.

5- Kosha Mangsho - Mutton curry is an Indian curry dish that is prepared from mutton and vegetables and originated in Bengal. It was rich, flavourful and lipsmacking.


Love pinch for two: Rs 1,500 (plus taxes). aaà

So don't waste time and come here with your friends and family any day to relish the authentic Bengali dishes.

Thanks to the management for their warm reception & hospitality.

I have eaten at events catered by 6 Ballygunge Place before, but this was the first time I visited one of their restaurants in person. There were 3 of us, & we decided to opt for à la carte experience, rather than the buffet.

We ordered Luchi, Rice, Dab Chingri, Chitol Macher Muittha & Bhuna Mangsho. We wanted to taste a preparation of crab as well, but the server informed us that crab was not available that day. As for the items that were ordered, dab chingri was undoubtedly the best- subtle & sublime, it tasted good with both rice & luchi  ! Chitol Muittha was also good. The mutton Bhuna was a bit of disappointment though. And one additional issue was the size of the servings, which seemed to be somewhat small considering the prices. 

As for the service, the servers were all friendly & helpful. However the food was a bit slow in coming- though they did tell us about the expected wait upfront.

Overall, a nice experience, but there's room for improvement.

As I'm visiting this place since my college days, I've nothing to say about this place..
I'll just suggest you if you want authentic Bengali Food, please come here...And do not forget to have Luchi and Mangsho...If you miss particularly this platter, you might commit a sin.. 😂
Just come here with your friends and family, enjoy the food and take loads of selfies..

Happy Tummy in advance...

Food quality has gone down the drain.

Specially​ if I order online for delivery.
I ordered the chicken thali a week back. The chicken curry was so tasteless. The rice quality was bad. 
Again ordered some starters today on account of some guests . And got nothing but embarrassed.
I ordered samosas..see the size in attached pic. And no where it was mentioned in the menu they were mini samosa. I ordered mutton chop. It has seeds of veggie..parwal which kept on crunching and ruin the taste in every bite.
Last was chicken pakoras..dhania fried chicken. It had no taste.no salt . No seasoning. Just disappointing and wastage of money.

There honestly isn't much I can add as a review towards a legendary restaurant as 6 Ballygunge Place, other than share my awe at the lunch buffet spread that I was able to witness and savour.
It was a weekday and the following things were on the buffet : Rice, Cholar Daal, Doi Potol, Luchi, Dum Aloo, Doi Pona, Fish Kobiraji, Coriander Chicken, Mangshor Jhol, Shaag bhaja, Begun Bhaja, Mishti Doi and Chanar Malpua.

Everything was lipsmackingly delicious, and very homemade style, as there was not a drop of oil in sight on any of the curries. The mutton curry was extremely well balanced and the melt in your mouth chanar malpua wrapped up a amazing meal. Simply awesome. I cannot emphasise enough how this place is in a league of its own. Bhojohori Manna and such places don't compare to this when it comes of quality and homemade-ness of the food.

Thinking Bengali food? 6, Ballygunge Place is "the place" to be.
The interiors consisting of hand fans ( haath pankha) gives an authentic Bengali feel. 
We had the buffet there . The menu was quite extensive with a wide range of dishes . To begin with there was Dal, rice, eggplant fry , aloo dum leading onto kasha murgi, bhetki paturi, mutton and mishti doi and Gulab jamun for desserts .
A special shout out for the bhetki Praturi which was very intricately prepared and aroused all the taste buds. We also had baked roshogolla and prawn fries which we had ordered separately . The prawn fries were served crispy and hot however it was served in the middle of the main course. The baked roshogolla was neither too sweet nor soggy, it was just perfect.
The mocktails could be a bit better , but overall the taste was unique and it stuck to the Bengali theme of the restaurant by giving each mocktail a unique name of a street of Kolkata , named after a famous Bengali person. 
The overall experience was good. The staff could have been better . The price was worth the quantity and the quality of the food we received.

We thought of trying some authentic Bengali cuisine . After getting recommendations from locals n bloggers I decided to try out this place,  We reserved Our table. Coming to food we opted for Buffet. 

They had rice, Pulao,  moong dal,  some veg curry,  loochi,  aloo dum ( average)  , Baigun (deep fried brinjal ) , Egg masala,  Mustard fish,  laal maas (Mutton curry)  , Chicken curry  , Boondi,  Misti doi.  
Food was excellent . Loved mutton curry so tender meat , the meat just melts in your mouth , Fish was good too.  
Definitely worth a visit!  👍

Negative remarks -
Bit overpriced , Management need to take care of this issue  . 
We expected baked rasogola and chingri (prawns) to be in the menu . Bit let down for us.

Hands down... This place is a bit difficult to locate... Yet... Thank u google maps😅 I would first of all commend the ambience... The section we sat in had an "aadi bangali" feel with the "Jomidari haatpakhas" depicted on the walls... Now, me being a foodie has a lot to do with my mother being a great cook... As we entered the place, I remember my dad and me joke about the upcoming competition to be held in our minds between my mum's luchis and 6 Ballygunge place's😆😆 I admit that it was a tough fight... I have had luchis at Oh calcutta! but this place serves the best luchis in Kolkata without a doubt... It was simply amazing😇 We preferred to opt for the lunch buffet and have alur dam and potol bhaja with the luchis... Both of which were really good... Yet the alur dam failed to sweep me off my feet. For the mains we had gorom bhaat, mooshor dal, my personal favourite Alur chokha, shaak bhaja in the vegeterian section. It really reminded me of home which is exactly what I came here for. In the non-vegetarian section... they had kacha longka dhonepata chicken, parsher jhal and mangsher jhol... Each of the items were perfect. My favourite was the mangsher jhol... You could actually see the mutton falling off the bones which was enough to give foodgasms😄 If we hadn't seen enough through the mains, the desserts were there waiting to sweep us off our feet... They offered an exquisite plethora of baked rosogolla, khejur amshotto chutney which was hands down... The best  chutney I have ever tasted in my life, papad, mishti doi. So yes... 6 ballygunge place was veritably successful in bringing home the "robibar dupurer bhuribhoj" feel... Yet... I would really recommend anyone aspiring to fill their stomachs and hearts here to visit this place on the weekends because they serve the best options of food on weekends. Overall, beautiful experience...

Simply the best restaurant I have been to for Bengali food! Everything they serve has been truly excellent. My favourite items have been the aloo jhinge posto, begun bhaja, begun basanti, kosha mangsho, daab chingri, malai chingri, and the bhapa doi. Hoping they open more outlets in other cities as well -- it's just too good to be in one place!

Food and food everywhere, not a single portion to waste, in a word heaven.
What we tried -
Rice, mooger daal, jhuri alu bhaja, mochar ghonto, chingri malaikari and vetki paturi. We ended with nolen gur er icecream.
Taste was yumm! My achievement was one of my bengali friend never interested with mochar ghonto, after a spoon he ordered another plate for his own. Vetki paturi was optimised with amount of mustard and mustard oil.
I asked those guys about the jaggery they used for the ice cream in off season and came to know they have a different wareshouse for anything that is available at restuarent during off season like jaggery in summer or hilsa in winter. 
I would definitely recomend this place for multiple visit, since every dish they have you should try at least one.
End of story, had a great dinner !! Happy Tummy, burp, love you for the food!! CHEERS!! 👍

A lot has been written about this place here on Zomato and maybe not much needs to be said anymore. 
The ambience... Excellent and in total Bengali style. It is basically an old home turned into a grand restaurant. The interior matches the exterior in its grandeur. 
The food.... Being a Bengali myself, I can say with absolute conviction that the legacy of Bengal and Bengali cuisine can truly be experienced here. 
The service....Excellent again. They managed the orders well on a very crowded day indeed. 
 Words cannot define the food that they serve on the plate. You have to be here to believe it. 
Do try out the following :
Dab Chingri, Prawn Cutlet, Mourala Maachher Peyaji, Kumror Doga diye Achari Ilish, Ilisher Tel Jhaal, Chingri Maach diye Biulir Daal, Bhuna Mangsho, Posto Narkel Bora.

One of the best places in Kolkata where you can enjoy very good bengali cuisine. It's not my first visit there. Great decor,  calm and very  soothing place to be and have your perfect 'bangali khabar'. Like always I went for the buffet and the bong in me was never this happier before. My favourite from today's buffet menu was 'chichinge diye chingri' and 'doi murgi' followed by their very famous 'baked pantua'. Service is top notch. Hope to visit this place again.

I wanted to visit this place for a really long time but got the opportunity to visit this place today for the lunch buffet. The restaurant have an amazing ambience. We seated ourselves on the ground floor. It had three room like sections. The section on which we sat was a bit smaller than the other too sections but it was very nicely decorated with bengali hand-fans or 'hath pakha' as we call it in bengali.
After we sat in our respective seats we were given cold towels which were wet as well. It had a fragrance which was very refreshing.
Now coming to the food, the buffet spread was decent. There was no starters as such like cutlets or something but the rest of the food made up for that.

Alurdum- This dish had a decent taste and it went well with Luchi
The Luchi and the Potol Bhaja were served on table. The luchi were light and fluffy. It was perfect.
Didn't eat the potol bhaja but my friend said that it was good because the potol didn't have too many seeds in it and it was fried perfectly.
Then there was Rice, Moong Dal, Saag bhaja, Alu Bharta, Bahari Begun, Parse Maach, Kanchalanga Dhonepata Murgi and Mutton Dakbangla.
Each and every dish was perfectly done. The chicken was tender and the green gravy had an amazing taste. The mutton was also tender and tasted just like the Mutton my Mom cooks.
A special mention to the alu bharta. I, being a fond of alu, absolutely adored the bharta. It was amazing.

There was Papad and Mango chatni as well. For desserts there was Chanar Mapoa and Mishti doi.
Chanar Malpoa was too good. It had shreds of almonds on top. The doi was good too.

The service was promt and the pocket pinch was reasonable. Will definitely visit again 😊

Being a bengali with a mother who cooks very well, I don't like going to Bengali Restaurants since I always end up comparing with my Mum's food, and my Mum always wins! But this place really stole my heart today. It reminded me exactly of my Mum's food. Their food is very quintessentially Bengali and will surely remind you of 'Maa er haather ranna'. 
The restaurant is built inside a very pretty typical Bengali house. The inside is truly Bengali and very welcoming and warm. The staff is very friendly and helpful, exactly how typical bongs are!
So we went there for lunch today and opted for their buffet. They had White fluffy Luchi, Alurdom, Saag, Alu Chokha, Sada bhaat, Moong daal, Potol Bhaja, Begun Bahar, Parsher Jhaal, Dhonepatar Chicken, Mutton Dakbunglow, Aam er Chutney, Papad, Chanar Malpua and Mishti Doi. Everything was delicious and very authentic! I never had better Bengali food in any other restaurant. 

Let me tell you, you might feel you have wasted your money because you can get exactly this at home, but that's the beauty! They serve authentic Bengali food, and if you are a Bengali you will know its worth!

This place promises to deliver bangaliana. And indeed they do so.

6 ballygunge place is located about 10 minutes of walking distance from the ballygunge phari petrol pump.

Ambience is pretty good. The decorations reminding us of old zamindari traditions. A nice place for family outing. 😃

The staffs are well behaved and courteous. 😃

We went for a tuesday lunch buffet. The item served were : luchi, aloor dom, begun bhaja, saag, some tomato bharta or something (i really dont remember exactly what it was), shada bhaat, tok daal, bhindi masala, maacher paturi, murgir jhol (as bengali as it can get), and mutton. In the dessert section there was chatni, papad, mishti doi, baked mihidana with rabri
Each and every dish were well prepared and tasty (didn't try the saag and that bharta though). But i personally didn't like the aloor dom.
Ok... Now having said one negative... Would like to add a special mention that the mutton was excessively well done... Be it the taste, be it quality of the meat, believe me everything was right about that dish.

The pocket pinch was around 600 per person all inclusive which given the food that they serve is less i would say. 😃

Had a pleasant experience at this place... would like to give it another visit for sure... 😃

Great service. Outstanding food. Generous portions. All boxes checked. 
Only grouse. Not a single non fried bread option :/  would've helped assuage some of the gluttony guilt :)

Visited this place again yesterday, for Family lunch. This time we had it the a-la-carte way. We started with the aam pora sherbat, which is such a pleasant relief in the hot summers and also the gondhorajer ghol is equally refreshing.Each and every item we ordered was prepared to perfection. Dimer Devil, Fish Fry, Aloo dum, Luchi, Sukto, Kosha Mangsho, Shorshe Ilish, Daab Chingri all of it.  A must visit for any bengali for an authentic bengali cuisine journey. The decor of the place just adds an extra element of charm to your dinnig experience here.

Overall good experience. Lastly.....the pan  masala which they provide .....can some one guide me where to buy those????

Went here for a quintessential bengali lunch, and the bong in me, has never been happier! 

The old bari feel, the pictures on the wall, the lanterns , even the faded paint, and the worn out walls, reminded me of my dida'r bari and all good old summer vacation lunches. 
We ordered the buffet, and were served a super refreshing drink, which was aam panna, though i am forgetting whats it called in bengali. 
We had the fish cutlet, with kashundi and a bongs favorite begun bhaja and luchi( uff those fluffy loochis)
Lunch was maach, chicken curry, mutton kosha, shorshe maach and ofcourse daab chingri, with pulao and rice, everything was cooked, just like Maa serves it!
Dessert was sweets i cant remember  naming and mishti doi :)

Loved the ambience, tonnes of bengali families lunching in the perfect afternoon, the chattering of the ladies, the stories of the men. 
I recommend this place for experience more than for food, go there if you like me, are stating away from kolkata, and wanna re feel all that in an afternoon.

If you love Bengali food this place is a perfect destination for you, no doubt. They have varieties of Bengali dishes to offer your tongue 😝. My favorites are- macher mtha diye daal, jhurjhure aloo bhaja, gandharaj bhetki, dub chingri, dhonepata chicken, mutton dakbunglow. You must feel heaven. As if a Bengali grandma has cooked for you. The accommodation is very artistic with a traditional Bengali architecture. Service is also very good.

Love! This place is love.

1. Ambiance : It is a bungalow restored as a restaurant. The walls have those amazing paintings. Even the plates have so much bongness in them.

2. Food : Too good! That too in this price - it's actually unbelievable. Everything is so well cooked and flavourful that you will fall in love with bengali cuisine.

I had the bhetki fish and radhabollobi and also pabda fish with rice. The usual potol was also made with loads of innovation.

A must visit in Kolkata!

This place has been in my bucket list since a long time. We had a great grand Sunday brunch there. The restaurant is located at Ballygunje Place..some few minutes away from Gariahat crossing.
The inner decor is soo eye soothing and heart warming it will give you a feel of old Zamindar houses with colorful patchitra and other beautiful decorations. A good place to visit with your family and have a good time.

Coming to the main part that is the grand Bengali spread they had for us. We have ordered for the Sunday buffet.

Initially we were given aam porar sherbet as welcome drinks. Then heading towards the buffet menu---
Luchi
Alurdom
Begun bhaja
Some aloo bharta kind of thing
Saag
Plain rice
Kishmish and Kaju pulao
Dal
Chanar dalna
Fish Kabiraji(deserves special mention)
Parshe maccher jhal
Chingrir malaikari(another awesome dish)
Lal murgi(needs a bit of improvement)
Mutton(light yet tasty..succulent pieces of mutton cooked to perfection)

Desset section includes-
Aam er chutney
Papad
Mishti Doi
Chanar malpoa
Baked rosogolla( well I can eat a whole plate of those, they were soo tasty)

The food is really tasty specially the non-veg section and desserts are good in taste. The fish kabiraji has stolen my heart and the Baked Rosogolla has stolen my soul. I think a bit of a improvement is needed in the vegetarian section as tastewise they were okayish not much worth mentioning.
Staffs were well behaved and really courteous and service was quick.
Overall totally satisfied and had a great time there. Hope to drop by there soon :)

One of the best places in Kolkata serving bengali cuisine. This place was renovated few years back and it looks amazing with beautiful wall paintings, bird cage chandeliers, traditional hand fans hanging from the ceiling.
Be it a la carte or buffet they never fail to serve delicious food. Among my favorites are Gondhoraj Ghol, Biren Roy Road, Gondhoraj Chicken, Luchi, Bhaja Masala Aloo Dum, Machher matha diye moong daal, Daab Chingri, Hilsa Tel jhal, Chitol machher muitha & many more. The luchi, aloo dum visually is heavenly and so is in taste. All the other dishes are delicious. In desserts baked mihidana with rabri & nolen gurer ice cream are to die for. I prefer the a la carte menu over the buffet here.
Service is very nice, the waiters help you choose your food according to what you want & are courteous.
Pocket pinch is moderate. Doesn't burn a hole in your pocket.

Go-to place for your authentic Bengali craving.
Tried their buffet..
Menu
1.Luchi
2.Beguni
3.Plain Rice
4.Pulao
5.Mung Dal
6.Aloo Dum
7.Doi Potol
8.Bhapa Oll
9.Doii Chicken
10.Mutton Kasha
11.Sorshe Parshe
12.Aamer Chaatni
13.Mishti Doii
14.Gulaab Jamun

Each and every item tastes good...
But with the price they charge a little better than parshe is expected in the fish section..
Also deprieving of Shukto and Aloo poshto is criminal .
Would have rated 4.5 otherwise.

Probably the best place in kolkata to have  bengali cuisine. Visited in the poila  baishak. On that day there was bengali buffet available  only. Great ambience with ethnic decor. Staffs are descent and well behaved Foods was awsome. Chitol macher muithya , Ilish bhapa and  prawn malaikari was really delicious. Deserts was awsome specially baked mihidana and nalen  gurer  ice-cream.Overall pleasant experience.

Well I have always loved the quintessential Bengaliness of the decor, the politeness of the servers and of course the wonderful cuisine.... Though begali food is something I eat daily at home sometimes it becomes necessary to step out and eat what is essentially delicacies cooked to perfection. I eat duck eggs at home... But "Hansher dim er devil" is something I haven't eaten for a long time... So what essentially was a trip to no 6 to have a few mocktails (with ingenious names ranging from the address of Satyajit Ray in bishop lefroy road to Tagore's abode at Jorasanko) and a couple of those devils, my  friend and I ended up having dinner... And it consisted of steamed basmati rice, the fabled daab chingree and bhuna mangsho.... And for that perfectly sweet finish... Baked mihidana with rabri. All the food were excellent... Though I would have loved the devil more had crust not been too hard . It was a perfect dinner... Oh if you dont like molten butterscotch icecream steer clear off the 24, Ashwini Dutta Road drink. My 3, Gour Mohan Chatterjee street drink was awesome... And it is my all time favourite...! Sayantani Sen

I had dinner with my family on the eve of Bengali New Year. Though we had to wait for an hour or so due to the rush, but it was worth the wait. Authentic bengali food is served here at this 2-storey restaurant. We wanted to have food on the A la Carte basis, but we were informed that due to rush, everyone were being served food on the basis of Buffet System. We were served Aam Pora Shorbot as a starter, which was kind of nice and delicious. In the main course, we took Rice, Green Peas Kachori, Badshahi Dal, Beguni, Jhur Jhure Aloo Bhaja, Potol Posto, Macher Chop, Aloo'r Dum, Chitol Macher Muitha, Chingri Macher Malai Curry, Chicken Aam Kasundi, Dhakai Mutton Kosha; out of which Chitol Macher Muitha was my personal favourite. In the dessert section, we took Chutney-Papad, Misti Doi, Icecream Sandesh and Patishapta. We also had Meetha Pan as a mouth freshner, which was being served downstairs. The ambience of the restaurant is a traditional Bengali type and the Manager & waiters were quite friendly. Overall the food quality was good, except for the Dhakai Mutton Kosha, as the mutton was not tender enough. I therefore recommend this restaurant to everyone, especially to those who are looking for a good Bengali Restaurant which is comparatively 'bit' pocket friendly.

Please take reservation before being there. Since Last Sunday afternoon there was really some rush in this restaurant. We and Our Bangladeshi relatives had a very sumptuous lunch over there.We have ordered egg devil and fish fry which was much better than the previous time we had it over there.Our Relatives loved the dish Ilish Bhapa and mutton Kasha , for me my favourite is murgir jhol, and chitol macher muitha , and dishes like Mochar ghonto and shuktuni which we tasted last sunday. It's like whenever we need to have some authentic Bengali food ,the name first came to my mind is 6 ballygunje place,

We Bengali's don't like to visit bengali restaurant in general but this was in my bucket from a very long time after tasting their catering menu.
Located in Ballygunge place,their dining services is hosted in two storeyes.As soon as you entered the place u will be greeted with a warm welcome from the staffs and then you will be given option to choose from buffet and A-la-carte.We prefer to choose A-la-carte.
Service was excellent,ambiance was awesome and have a touch of bangaliyana in it,old Bengali classic playing in the background will definitely create a nostalgia to all bangalis.
Comming to the food,we were served:
1. Mocktails- Bishop Lefroy Road,Gour Mohan Chatterjee Street and Am pora sorbot.
Out of this bishop lefroy road catch my heart..blended with ice cream and orange juice this drink will definitely soothe your taste buds.
Gour Mohan Chatterjee street is highly recommended in this hot weather...perfect blend of ginger mint leaves,this dish will definitely beat the heat.

2.Gondhoraj Chicken-Simply amazing...u can feel the flavour of gondhoraj lime in every bite.

3.Main Course-Paratha,Steam rice, Mangser jhol,Dab Chingri,Chitol macher muithya.
Paratha was light and tasty.
Mangser jhol was ok ok.
Dab chingri (the famous authentic prawn dish of epar bangla) and chitol macher muithya (the famous dish of opar bangla) is the must try dishes.Prawns were soft,it will melt in your mouth..flavours of coconut gravy will definitely tickle your taste buds.
Muithya was soft,red gravy was bit on a sweeter side....simply amazing.

4.Nolen gurer ice cream- Aaaahhhh!!The show stopper of the day...your meal is incomplete with this...
Made of nolen gur and coconut (narkel), this dessert will beat the best desserts of the world.A must try dish.

So if you want to taste the flavours of bengal without a very high pocket pinch..then you are absolutely in the right place..and for the non bongs you will definitely be taking one of your sweetest memories back home from here..☺

Being a Bengali I generally avoid going to a Bengali restaurant, as ample options are available at home only. Our moms and aunts re already great chefs. But once in a while changing the taste doesn't do any harm. So we ended up at 6 Ballygunge place!
Ambience: rightly said its quintessentially Bengali in every aspect.
Food: we opted for a-la-carte. Rice with daab chingri is mesmerising. Its something that we don't frequently prepare at home. My friend preferred luchi and kosha mangsho. The pabda jhaal was also good.
Price: slightly on higher side.

For someone travelling into Kolkata, to try out Bengali food would be on top of the list. Someone suggested this place for me to try out Bengali cuisine. The ambience was beautiful and perfect. I am sorry but I can't remember the names of the food that I ate (as the staff had suggested the food for us) but it was super yummy!!!. They have some quirky names to their drinks, of which the Kiwi Lemon soda (name in menu is different) was pretty yumm! It's a must visit for me when I get there next time.

Definitely one of the best restaurants serving Bengali Cuisine in Kolkata. Located in a renovated old house at 6, Ballygunge Place, the ambience fills up your senses the moment you enter. The interiors have been carefully made up in keeping with the Bengali theme of the restaurant.
Coming to the food, we had ordered ordered Gondhoraj Chicken and some cocktails for starters. The chicken was good but the cocktails were not quite up to the mark. We ordered Bhekti Paturi, Daab Chingri and Rice for the Main Course. All the items were delicious but Daab Chingri was the real highlight of the meal. Consisting of succulent prawn pieces, cooked well in coconut milk and mustard, it will leave a rich aftertaste in your mouth for a long time. If you visit this place, definitely try Daab Chingri. 
We concluded our meal by trying out 'Nolen Gurer ice cream' which was as good as we ever had.
The ones serving food were at their courteous best.

This place will change the way you think of food made in Mustard. Brilliant is the word that comes to my mind for every element of the restaurant starting from the lovely stairs eclectic decor, well designed plates, awesome post meal saunf (dried meetha pan, heavenly!), friendly staff and delicious food. I had Bhapa Ilish and Dab (Dab means Green Coconut) chingri (Chingri means Prawns) as rightly suggested by Megha Parekh. They suggest you to have these with dishes with rice, I suggest you have it with their Puri also. Have the refreshing Aam Panna which is another rmust have and after Ur meal have the mishti dahi for sure.

After all this welcome to the blissful state of food coma :)

Where to start from...

Okay lets just start with the Fly swimming in the water...
From the lack of Salt in practically every dish offered...
To being offered a strategically placed cheaper item like a Duck egg preparation.... and all togethar skipping Bengalis very own Prawn/Hilsa dish instead doing away with an okayish Pabda dish. Thereby the effective cost cutting..
Also just 2 items apart from the an alur dom and Tel potol. No Paneer... nothing.

Coming to the deserts... Theres no Payesh... cant even imagine a Bengali buffet menu without payesh... tssk tssk... 
6 Ballygunge Place...congrats on making a huge mess out of such a great Culture. All this at a hikey 665 bucks.
Wont go ever.Period.

Authentic Bangaliana served on a plate. Located in ballygunge and hosting 2 storyes of dining space the space still gets all the rush it deserves and one should surely expect a fair amount of wait time for their weekend lunch buffets.  Had visited the place for a Saturday lunch. Although the place offers varied choices in their a la carte menu we still opted for their buffet. 

The place is neatly done and reflects the traditional heritage and culture of bengal in their decor. The staff is nice and courteous. Finally coming to the food the buffet it serves at the price point is exceptional. It has a huge range of options with some of the bengali classics like luchi, moong Daal, sorshe pabda, kosha mangsho and ending it with, of course, mishti doi. I like most of the dishes that were on offer in the buffet and overall it was quite a filling and complete experience. 

Will definitely recommend it and will surely visit again.

If one seeks to have unlimited pure bengali food then 6 BP is undoubtedly the best place.Starting with their luchi,alur dum and ending with their misti doi and khirer malpoa,this place has been satisfying the tummies of bengali fooodies for years.I visited this place twice and has been satisfied on both the occasions,except for one fact that their menu is too constant and it shall be better if they keep changing their items and bring in some new interesting ones.But the variety of dishes is quite great with the spread including items like tel potol and even neem begun!Overall a great place to have food with friends and family.The ambience and the hospitality is also remarkable.

I have tried their catering menu at so many weddings ,that coming to savour the real thing was always on my list. Never knew that the buffet menu could be so different and disappointing from their a-la-carte fare. We opted for the buffet which comprised off begun bhaja, chena kofta,shorshe maacherjhol, chingrir malai kari ,sada pulao ,daal and gorom luchi amongst other items .the aamsato khajur  chutney was very good . The service ,ambience and decor was top notch . The taste and the disappointing desserts on offer at the buffet that day left me a little disappointed because I had high expectations ,as the place is known for its versatile bengali cuisine and classic desserts .Will definitely choose a la carte next time

Poila boishak Buffet was way over priced.
It charged double the normal cost.
The food was not good.
The mutton and chicken was stiff.
Chitol maachher muitha was sort of sausage type, rubbery.
Chingri bharta tastes good by the covers where grinded with the fish which made taste sand.
Only the fish chop was good.
Not going to visit again.

After a long time I had some delicious bengali cuisine probably one of the best bengali cuisine restaurant in kolkata. I ordered rice, mug dal, alu vaja, pabda mach sorse, rui macher kalia and kacha lonka dhonepata bata chicken. Mug dal was awsome and the best part was it had a slight flavour of kacha aam. Pabda was average but rui mach was nice in taste. I love that chicken it was the best amongst all. Overall nice bengali cuisine restro loved it totally.. worthy for a visit.

Have been to this place quite a few times in the past and always liked the food.

However,last week decided to pick up some food(post renovation)and was expecting fireworks.Sadly,it was one horrible experience.

We ordered for Bhuna Mangsho,Kaju Kishmish Pulao,Paratha and Murgir Tramfrado.

All items tasted horribly bad especially the Bhuna Mangsho which had an awful smell and the Paratha which was the size of a medium Pizza and tough to the core.

Loved this place. It is a 3 floored building with small rooms inside having 3-4 tables in each room. Each room is decorated in a traditional bengali style with handmade sketches & old Bengali heroine's photos.
Food quality is awesome, but price is little in the higher side - 1000 - 1500/- for 2 person. We have ordered afghani chicken cutlet, bhapa bhetki, mangser polao & fresh lime soda & baked mihidana with rabri. Each one of the above is delicious & hygienic also. I am giving 4.5 as I have to explore other items otherwise it should be 5 on 5.

Hands down the best bengali buffet spread available in the city. A bit tricky though to locate the place. After it has renovation done last year, the ambiance of this place resembles that of a zamindar era. We hardly waited for 10 odd minutes on a Wednesday afternoon in order to secure the table. Piping hot fulko luchi and brgun bhaja was served at the table. Sada bhaat, dal was just like what we normally have in our home. Mangso(both chicken and mutton) and Maach were the show stoppers with hardly any bone. I even saw few guys gulping down entire plate full of solid non veg items. Desert section needs to be improved though. The experience was however  More than paisa wasool for the price range the entire buffet was getting served for.

Restruant decorated with originality of bangaliana, specialised in bengali cuisine has become a hot craze for people craving brngali food. They have some of their signature dish which are perfect to greet special guests. Chingri malaikari they prepare is good with medium spicey. I personaly was slight disappointed as because i had to add extra salt to the dishes served and I expect bengali dish to be cooked slight rich.

A Sunday Bengali buffet is all you need to give yourself and your loved ones . Everyone is aware of their traditional Bengali food spread in the form of a buffet, many have tried and some of them have still ignored it . Where some of them have applauded , quite a few of them have criticised for being non-adventurous . I had this buffet some months prior to the date of this review so it was pending for a long time . But, i am finally penning this and this is my take on one of the popular buffet spreads of this city . And my take is that every foodie should have a visit and taste their buffet atleast once . Without giving too much on the location and everything let's get straight to the fact as to why you should try this buffet atleast once :- 

BENGALI BUFFET SPREAD 
-----------------------------------------------------------
===============
WELCOME DRINK 
===============

Classic ghol ( 4 / 5 ) :- Good tasty drink to start with your drink . It is served cold .

===============
STARTERS :- 
===============

You will hardly call it a starter spread as they mostly consist of hot , freshly fried luchis . They will serve you the luchi on a bread container . They are hot and the texture is perfect to go with any side like ALU r dum . You have to take the sides from the buffer counter . Along with the luchi they also serve begun bhaja which are like the classical big begun fries that you normally get in occasions . You will also find another fry from the counter ( this varies ) . I got mangshor chop which was tasty but certainly not what I was hoping for while listening to the name mangshor chop . Mostly the masala is keema , but it didn't taste meaty enough for a non-veg fry . So, it was kind of a disappointment . So, following will be the list of starters :- 

1. Luchi ( 4 / 5 ).
2. Begun bhaja ( 4 / 5 )
3. ALU r dum ( 3.5 / 5 ) 
4. Mangshor chop ( 3 / 5 ) ( this varies ) 

===============
MAIN COURSE :- 
===============

*******
VEG :- 
*******

1. Plain rice ( 4 / 5 ) :- Fine quality basmati rice to go with your main course dishes .

2. Moong daal ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- This is your basic Sona moong daal . Cooked exactly like the way that is done in your home . It tastes good .

3. Fulkopi roast ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Once again an okayish veg Bengali dish . The fulkopis are roasted properly with peas and no gravy . This dry dish can go well with your hot rice .

Along with the above 3 dishes , you also have the ALU r dum so certainly not a good spread for the veg counterpart . A strictly no no for people who are looking to have veg.

***********
NON-VEG 
***********

1. Rui shorshe ( 5 / 5 ) :- let me tell you . If you are someone if you refuse to eat Rui in a buffet then you are going for a big miss in this restaurant . This fish dish is a stunner . Firstly , due to the quality of the fish which is top notch . The white texture and the tenderness will make you wonder whether you are actually having rui or bhetki . This is a must try . And the halka sorshe ( mustard ) gravy goes so well with the well cooked fish . This dish with some hot steamed rice will make you go over the moon . Highly recommended .

2. Chingri malaikari ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- Another well made prawn dish Bengali style.  The malaikari gravy is as good as it gets and the bagda prawns are a classic . The size is not big to destroy you plate , something that golda chingri does with it's size and scales . Eating bagda is way easier , the meat is so tasty as these are really fresh prawns. I could not count how many of them I had . It was yummy . Once again recommended .

3. Golanda chicken kosha ( 3.5 / 5 ) :-  The dish with minimum interest from the foodies because it is hard to concentrate on chicken when you have so other better delicacies to choose from . Just an normal kosha chicken curry neatly done but not exceptional like the other non veg main courses . The chicken seemed fresh but I didn't find the meat to be the most tender . You can skip this one .

4. Mangshor jhol ( 5 / 5 ) :- The traditional mutton Curry and trust me this is the big daddy of the buffet . Meat cooked so well that you can have a go at the bones. The cooking is so perfect that the meat will not fall of but it will still be tender . Once again the gravy is perfect to go with hot rice but who cares about rice when you can go for pieces after pieces of mutton . This is where you will have a " Paisa wasool " moment . I will not be surprised if people come only for the mutton . It was really good and highly recommended .

===========
DESERTS :- 
===========

1. Chatni & papad ( 3.5 / 5 ) : traditional tomatoes chatni ND papad .

2. Mishti doi ( 4 / 5 ) :- Fine textured top class mishti doi .

3. Rosbora ( 2.5 / 5 ) :- Not that impressive , found it a little hard . Can be skipped .

4. Malpoa ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- Not the bear but still decent enough .

5. Baked rasogolla ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- once again I have had better, but still it was good .

-------------------------------------------------------------------

VERDICT :- A really good buffet for non veg Bengali food lovers . The 3 main course dishes will be worth the 800 rupees that you spend for a weekend buffet lunch . The following are the main points :- 

1. Excellent ambience . Legendary atmosphere for you to spend a quality lunch / dinner with your loved ones .
2. Superb non veg main course especially fish , prawns and mutton . Have as much as you like .

Probably the best Bengali buffet in town so go for it with a hungry appetite and an empty stomach .

The best thing about this place is the old Calcutta vibe that it exudes. The food has Bengal written all over it. From the fluffy and oily Luchis, to the lip smacking Chitol er Muittha, the delicacies are quite wonderful. Their dessert section is equally sinful, specially the Mihi-Randi. All in all, a wonderful experience.

Great food! The best even. I have had Bengali food in Mumbai before, not being crazy about it. But my lunch today has definitely converted me into a fan. The whole meal was a gastronomical delight. The fried bhetki was a clear winner, unparalleled to any fry fish I've had before. The mutton was succulent and delicious. We ordered the hilsa, which left a nice tingly sensation . However the surprise of the day was Nolan Goud ice cream, simply a delight. The ambience was very Bengali, with Mario-esque caricatures on the wall and Robindra sangeet in the background. The service was warm and everything recommended to us by our server was spot-on. A must visit place when in Kolkata.

Going back to roots and how! Started with the Aam Kasundi Murgi which is boneless chicken marinated in aam kasundi steamed in gourd (lau) leaves. I ate two because well you just have to once you have had one. It was not a traditional Bengali meal because I had decided to forego the daal and alu bhaja or the vegetables. Straight on to chitol machh er muithya, which was garlicky (in a good way) and spicy. My absolute favorite and the one that I had my eye on even before I got there was the Bhapa Gondhoraj Bhetki. It did not disappoint. I knew it had to be delish and it was! The main courses ended with Daab Chingri. For dessert, Nolen Gurer ice cream was a very pleasant experience. The fusion of earthy nolen gur and ice cream was interesting to say the least. The baked mihidana with rabri was pretty good too but predictable nonetheless. 

As a Bengali who lives away from her hometown for most of her life, 6 Ballygunge Place gave me memories to cherish and take with me. Do visit.

Haven't been to the restaurant but had food delivered hence reserving a point for that. Taste wise the food is much better than the Salt lake outlet. The coriander chicken that I had hated at salt lake was awesome here. There is some scope for improvement in desserts though.

We visited this place last weekend. Really like the interiors and staff service. Since we were new to kolkata, someone referred this place. Nomenclature of drinks is interesting. Ordered one lemon mint and guava drink. Dont remember the names but both were refreshing. Then came our prawn malai curry. Prawns were tiger and with shell. Little cumbersome to eat. We were given fork and spoon. Probably knife would have helped to eat it. Also came bhetki paturi and that was awesome. We finished the curd with baked curd. Probably if the honey on top were absent, then we would have loved it. But still good to have. I found it worth spending 1500 bucks for 2 people on a hearty meal with flavors packed service.

I have eaten at the saltlake outlet but this was my exp here as well as the buffet.
Our gang of cousins invaded this place on a sat afternoon.
Was impressed with the decor and service but the 
Food was good in parts and disappointing in others.

The initial loochi begun bhaja and starter combo was good ,so was the fish chop... veg items were avg.

Pabda jhal was disappointing .. fish was not fresh and neither was the cooking..

Mutton was smelly and horrible. We complained they tried to rectify but u can do nothing when the mutton is smelly
Misti doi in desert was good.

Not going back for buffet again.

Being Punjabi, I had a great experience with Bengali food.  I and my friend decided to visit a place who can serve a great Bengali food. So we searched in Zomato and came to know about 6 Ballygunge place to experience typical Bengali food. I must say the food was simply excellent and tasty. Both Veg and NonVeg Items were good!!. The ambiance was also classic and elegant. The best Bengali food I have ever had!.

We had an amazing experience dining out in 6 ballygunge place. This place has a very beautiful,calm and quite atmosphere. The waiters were very helpful and patient. We ordered fish fry,gondhoraj chicken,bhapa ilish,dab chingri,pulao and rice. Fish fry was exceptionaly good and so was gondhoraj chicken. Bhapa ilish and dab chingri was above average. At last we ordered desert indrani which can be compared with rasmalai but the taste of the dish was amazing. The combination of cottage cheese and milk with dry fruits was very delightful. Overall we had an amazing lunch at this place.

Was here to try out some authentic Bengali food and wasn't disappointed at all. Loved the place and the service provided by the staff. The dal was mind blowing and so was everything else on the lunch buffet menu. Personally like the Veg Menu more than the Non- Veg Menu. Dahi Misti was awesome ! Keep it up ! 👍🏼

Good food. Especially their machher paturi. But they have a thing called murgir paturi which was a disappointment. The staff is quite courteous. The decor of the place is a bit too dull. But the quality of food is quite good. One improvement they can do is to ask the customer how much comfortable they are with spicy food and make it accordingly. I can't eat spicy food. So it becomes a real problem for me then.

No need for explanation, it is famous for authentic bengali food. Though the place is quite expensive. We celebrate our first marriage anniversary at there. Teste of daab chingri is fabulous. In weekdays they serve buffet lunch just 485 plus tax. They serve loochi begun bhaja, rice,moog dal, pepe bharta, saag bhaja, alur dom, chitol macher muitha, kosha Mangsho, doi murgi, chaini, papad, malpoa and misti doi.

Went for a buffet lunch on Friday. It was not too crowdy then (though advise you to book a table before going). Manager and staffs welcomed us very nicely. Restaurant is very well decorated and ambience is very nice.

Coming to food. It started with fulco luchi and begun vaja. That was awasum. Beside that there were dal, alur dom, echor curry (I didn't tasted any of these because main items were coming :-P ). Then there were rice, rui ma6 er kalia, chicken and mutton. Each and every item was delicious and was solid (means pieces were big and really had chicken or mutton rather than bones). Combination of fulco luchi and mutton was best. In dessert there were chatni, papad, gorom malpo and misti doi. Malpo was awasum. 

Price of non veg buffet at weekdays is 485 + Tax (around 100 rs).

Only problem is the location. You cannot go there by public bus or auto. You have to book a taxi or ola (at least we did not found any public transport there). Also remember there is also another outlet of this (6 Ballygunge Place Thali), so be specific when you search for taxi.

Overall a very nice experience.

Decor is very impressive, so are the staffs and also the ambience. We went for a lunch buffet. Plenty of spread, two or three items were really good. Although I feel, the food reviews are slightly overhyped as the taste of several items can be better. Value for money. Recommended for those want to try authentic Bengali dishes.

This is probably the best bengali restaurant in and around Kolkata. The beautiful interiors add a special taste of nostalgia if you've come to the city of joy after a long time. From bati chochhori to chitol machher peti roast, every food item is cooked to perfection. The gondhoraj bhapa bhetki and ilish paturi need special mention. The kasha mangsho was one of the best I've ever had. Dab chingri was unique and very tasty. We ended with Baked
 Mihidana with Rabri and Nolen Gurer Icecream. Both are highly recommended.

This is place which says Authentic Bengali food and yet the Bengalis who eat say, this is "NOT" what it should taste like. Apart from the expensive bill, not too good a food menu and food including, the place in inside has a tried to make it look bengali styled, but Bengal has become a bit more modern for the same ambience. Otherwise Kudos in trying. :)

Spare the prelims and get right down to main course. Bhat, dal, jhuri bhaja, mustard rohu/ rohu kalia, a piece of bhapa bhetki. Indulge the greed with a couple of luchi and mutton koshsa mangsho. Dessert- you got to kidding.
Warm the plates lads, the ac chilled the plate and thus the food went cold in a jiffy. Got to dock yu 1/2 point therefore.
Food par 10/10
Service 10/10
Cold plates.....brrrrrr....10% deducted off the perfect score

We had a family get together to celebrate my son's first birthday. The food was great both in terms of variety and taste but what stood out is the exceptional service. We were made to feel right at home. From the assistance in cake cutting and serving to attending to our little needs they came through on all grounds. Can't thank them enough for making the day memorable.

Staffs eere well behaved and prompt with their services.. now coming to the food I would like to say it was quite satisfactory but somehow I felt there should be a little improvement in the selection of items in the buffet.. although my taste buds were quite satisfied with the buffet.. the authentic bengali cuisines made my evening.. overall I had a pleasant experience at this popular bengali restaurant.. :)

Always a fan of quality Bengali food, 6 Ballygunge place actually disappointed me. Bhuna Chingri - didn't get the test, Mutton was hard, plenty of big names to ordinary foods, only exception was Fish Fry. To all the Bengali Food lover please try Fish Fry at Mitra Cafe & Niranjan Agar they are exceptional.

This is one place for authentic Bengali cuisine. The place is well decorated and furnished with quality service and hospitality. I tried their weekdays buffet. Which comprised of rice, dal, aloo dum, sim bharta, ,luchi,begun bhaja,fulkophir Torkari,panda jhaal,murgi jhol,mutton kasha, Nolan guruer misti, dahi,pineapple chutney and pappad. Some dishes like the mutton kosha, seem bharta, Nolan gurer misti was delicious.The mutton was very well cooked. Rest food was average.But the spread was generous and pocket friendly. I came to know tat during weekends they serve prawns nd some special dishes so the rates are little higher but worth a try!!! I am yet to try their A la carte.. Especially the Hilsa..and crabs..So 6 Ballygunje place meet u soon once again..till then Good luck..😘

The quality of the food has got worse. I have had their food earlier and it was tasted just awesome, but my recent experience is really bad with them. We had been to there on 04th Feb 17 with much expectation like earlier. We opted for Saturday Buffet Lunch, the spread was not much good. The chicken , mutton both were stiff like anything, it seemed those are not cooked well or they have done this intentionally so that customer shouldn't consume much and they save their food. We complained about the same to the waiter as well but found no changes in the same. Fish preparation was just ok, Gondhoraj ghol, luchi, Begun bhaja, malpoa was somewhat good, but the main dishes are really bad. Will not recommend anyone for their buffet. Don't just go by their name it's better to have roadside food than them

Three words: Authentic Bengali cuisine. 
I went there on my first trip to Kolkata and had mixed reactions to the things I tried there, some were okay, some were good and one was fantabulous. 
The place is beautifully decorated with miniature portraits all over the walls. It gives you a very homey feeling. The service was prompt. 

We tried Bengali fish fry for starters which was crisp and yummy. 

For drinks we couldn't pin point on anything and thus ordered beckbagan row which was too spicy for my taste and Gondhoraj Ghol whose taste did not agree with me. I thought it would be kind of a sweet lassi but it turned out something else. This we had a raw deal with the beverages. Better stick with plain water. 

For main course we ordered dal which was again just okay. But their aam kasundi bhindi is out of this world. It was the dish I have ever had in any Indian restaurant. Lip smacking delicious. The paranthas we ordered with it were also good, a bit different from what you get in north India but they were good. 

We also ordered prawns, which were good. The curry was really yummy. 
I would definitely recommend fish fry, bhindi, and prawns with parantha.

Myself with my friend and family had lunch on 5/2...The ambience is good, we ordered "Gandoraj chicken" as starter which was perfect..And in main course we ordered "beckti paturi" which was also good.. Chicken and mutton dishes were also near to good..But the orders "Lal chicken" was bit dry and hard which is below standard..In dessert "nalon gurer ice cream " my fa@vourite.. Overall must tryout for guys looking for pure Bengali cuisines..

Had an extremely bad experience at this restaurant. 
Food had long hair in two items. 
Food was served cold. 
Not at all hygienic, compared to the price they charge. 
You guys should be very sorry but no one apologised us for this disaster service. Staff courtesy is definitely not acceptable. 
Will not recommend anyone.
Visit date - 5 Feb dinner.

I had to change my review about this place!
I had given 5 stars back in February, but Sad , I was not at all satisfied the latest time.
It was 2.50pm, we came, they told we have to wait for 10mins as the buffet is not ready yet, we waited , Alu daam was the worst I had, bitter and cold!
I liked the chicken , also mutton , there was Pabda fish, it was really good, and it was empty after a while , we had told to re fill , they told to wait , okay we were waiting and we ordered a Fresh lime soda, we had to order 3-4 time consistently, fresh lime was no where to be found!! 
Then we had to shout literally, and then it came, also pabda fish was not refilled, we went to take desert, there were no desert plates or spoon!
I’m sorry, I love this place but the services went really down.

It had a great medley of flavours with modern touch yet traditional at heart.. loved the most was the fish fry and Gondhoraj lebu chicken for the starters.. thank you #Kolkata

I have never relished eating a path patar bora as much as I have done in 6 ballygunge lane.. I never used to eat it when my mom or aunts made it in lunch.. I always thought it to be a part of wildlife, some flora exotica.. but after I tried it here, it has become one of my favorites.. such is the food here.. everything is immensely tasty and the buffet will never be satisfying to the heart as your stomach will be fulfilled before your heart.. I love going there and have taken my extended relatives too.. will go again on my next kolkata visit ! Love it!

Plain and simple... Loved the whole experience!

Starting off with the food...we got all the traditional bengali favourites.
Bekti and illish Paturi (fish),  kosher maangsho (mutton) bengan baja, luchi, daab chingri (prawn) and jaal kakri  (crab).

Have to say I loved every single dish! The flavours were so mild yet intricate  in the curries. And  I don't even like fish and I couldn't stop eating the bekti Paturi. 

I also had a very interesting cocktail of lime soda and butterscotch icecream which was weird but wonderfull in its own refreshing way. 

And after all that lavish eating We even managed to squeeze some dessert in....the baked sondeshs and the mishti dhoi both of wich were really yummy.

And the ambiance.... it was soo colourful and cute it really adds to the whole dining experience. 

Being a visitor to Kolkatta myself I have to say if you have visitors and want to take them out to a nice bengali dining experience take them here! It's a feast for the eyes and the pallet

An well decorated Bengali cuisine restaurant. Went there with friends and had buffet there. Firstly they served us luchi and fulkopir bora. And there were plain rice, moong daal, begun bharta, bori die pabda maach, lonka dhonepata chicken, mutton kosha, anarosh er chatni, rosogolla and dwai in their buffet. And there was a preparation of shaak which we didn't had. And most importantly the taste of these preparations were just too good. Undoubtedly one of the best Bengali cuisine restaurant in the city.

Everything was very good but felt that they could have put one more veg-gravy item. I missed our very own sondesh in dessert section too..

One word: Perfect

I went to 6 Ballygunge Place yesterday with my parents and few other acquaintances and to my surprise, noticed one of its staffs gleefully greeting us and arranging for our table at once, even though the place was extremely crowded. 
The staff behavior was praiseworthy, they were really hospitable and helpful, perfectly complementing the unique, beautifully decorated interior, with a dash of Bangaliyana.

We ordered Koraishuti'r Kochuri, Chholar Dal, Mochar Chop for the starters and Bishop Lefroy Road mocktails respectively. The food arrived at our table in a matter of 5-6 minutes and was cooked to perfection.
Highly intrigued by the appetizers, we went for the entrée straightaway.
Enthusiastically, we ordered the Gondhoraj Chicken, Mutton Jhol, Kankraa'r Jhal, Chital Maach'er Muittha, Kaju-Kismis Pulao with steamed rice and Begun Bhaja.
The bulk order arrived quickly, which were delicious and acted as a catalyst for our gargantuan appetite.
For the dessert, we went for the highly appreciated Nolen Gurer Ice cream, which was simply ethereal and made us speechless.

All in all, it was one of the most delightful dining experiences in my life and I strongly recommend this restaurant to all the foodies out there.
This eatery is bound to deliver you unadulterated authentic Bengali cuisine, and is remarkably economical and pocket friendly, as compared to other over hyped and overrated eating joints.

Happy Poush Sankranti to All! Makar Sankranti which is also known as Poush Sankranti in Bengal is an auspicious day in Hindu culture. It is celebrated almost all over India and in other Hindu based countries. 
Pithe Puli Utsav – 6 Ballygunge Place is Celebrating The Bengal Delicacy in a Grand way.
Thanks Rajdeep Da for the invitation to be part of this heritage event.
The restaurant is conveniently placed in a bustling locality in South Kolkata. It’s only a 10 minutes walking distance from Gariahat crossing. Designed to resemble a building from the golden olden era, 6 Ballygunge Place gives you a cosy homely feeling from the moment you step in. The outdoor is decorated with arc like glasses in top of the windows, which is a reminiscent of old Kolkata. The interior is well decorated with comfortable sofas and chairs. 
They had arranged a special live baul programme which was a perfect touch to the Royal Bengali Pithe Puli Utsav.
The ambience was typically old world, our vanished yesterdays, and a prominently displayed gramophone added lustre to the scenario. We started with Mocha Chop, a Gondhraj Chicken, a delicacy where boneless chicken is marinated in ample juice of strongly flavoured lemon and the fried in oil. Then we had Ros Bora. A pure bliss for the sweet lover. It was so soft that it was just melt in a whiska. I could not resist myself from having an another go. Ranga Alur Puli was the next item to follow. It was another blockbuster I must say. Such a lovely preperations of Ranga Alu and Coconut. Just no wards to describe. Just a must try dish. Though there were more items to follow, but still I did not think twice to have another bites in to that preperations. After fulfilling the hunger meter upto a certain level it was time to take care of chal bhapa malai and Pati Shapta. Pati Shapta was rightly placed at the tail of the story. Nalen Gurer Kheer Pati Shapta was just wow. No one can eat just one.
The menu was quintessentially ethnic Bengali. The rates are not exorbitant and the quality of the food and ingredients were definitely top notch. There are many places where we can have Bengali delicacies round the year but 6 Ballygunje   Place undoubtedly takes the showstopper when it comes to Bengali Cuisine! Keep the flag flying high for maintaining and upholding an essential part of our culture and heritage.
Go and have a day out at 6 Ballygunge Place to enjoy probably the best show of the season. Rajdeep Bhattacharjee Soujanya Rakshit

I do agree that this is one of the best Bengali restaurants in Kolkata. Fish fry, prawn malai curry, dab chingri, bagun baja... these are just some of the delicious offerings at 6 Ballygunge. Recent renovations have transformed its blah interiors into a modern and artistic restaurant. So I can hardly find fault with the place. Food is delicious. Drinks are interesting. Decor is savvy. Price is within reason. Parking is manageable. If I had to constructively criticise I'd probably point out that they can do away with clumsy waiters who are forever dropping cutlery, and an over-zealous maître d' who kept insisting we register at the reception before entering, despite our reservation.

And the decoration was awesome....absolutely looks like a palace...total bong feeling...infact i would say the best decoration among all the bengali cuisine...now come to the main part which is of course food....we have ordered karasutir kachuri (good enough 4/5), paratha(4 again out of 5), cholar daal( too good, the best.. so I will give full marks on it, 5),chaanar dalna(normal so 2.5/5) ,kaju kismish pulao (nice taste full of kaju nut so will give 4.5/5), kachalonka dhonepata murgi ( total disappointing, under cooked, no taste of kacha Lanka, salty so 1.5 fr that)
Come to the desert baked mihidana with radbi (it was nice so 3/5), baked sandesh( very good ..do try it 5/5)
Lastly Stuffs were very helpful,cooperative...good service...
So,fr me Decoration was more eye cathing nd attractive for me over the food....👍

Visited the place during puja menu launch with Team Panchphoron. As usual amazing experience.  They crafted an authentic Bengali menu specially for Durga Puja. The menu contains :
Luchi – Our favorite deep-fried flatbread made of wheat flour that is typical of Bengali cuisine.

Alur Dom –It was the perfect combo Luchi+Alurdom. Alur dom was terrific, mind blowing taste.

Kosha Mangso –6 Bp is famous for this particular preparation. A spicy dry mutton item. Tate wise its heavenly. Must Try.

Chingri Malaikari – Chingri Malai Curry is among one of my favorite Bengali dishes. It was  made from prawns and coconut milk and flavored with spices. Another Must try if you visited 6Bp.

Vetki Paturi - Chunk of vetki marinated with mustard paste and different spices and wrapped in banana leaf and steamed perfectly. Tradition Bengali preparation. Mouth watering!!

Fish Cutlet: A perfect starter option. Taste wise very good. 

Pulao – Pulao is a very traditional Bengali rice dish. This is a sweet pulao very good in taste. 

Palong chanar kofta- An unique delicious veg preparation. Kofta was made with fresh cottage cheese and palong paste and cooked in a delicious spicy gravy.

For dessert you will get misti doi and others delicious sweets.
So if you looking for a traditional bengali lunch or dinner where you will get authentic bengali preparation then this is the place you must visit. Good Food FeeL Good. Happy Puja everyone. 
  

                        If you want good service , a nice ambiance and delicious authentic Bengali food,  this is the one of  best place which will satisfied your needs. You will not regret. Its located in Salt Lake. Their fish fry is a must try. Start your innings with Aam Sorbot and Gondhoraj lebur Ghol , in the main course we had  basmati rice , sukto , dal, hilsa and mutton kosha its just mouth watering. Specially the hilsa teaste really good, we finished our innings with the nolen gurer ice cream. Whole experience was very nice. Buffet seems to be little pocket friendly you can also go for a la carte it will be little bit costly but you will get what you loving the most.

Been here several times and tried their buffet and separate table both. 
For Bengali cuisine lovers it's best place than Bhojohori Manna in town. Great quantity with good quality and delicious items. Be it Bhetki Paturi,or Ilish Bhapa a must try. 
Staffs are attentive and refined. But staffs aren't best when you're at buffet in this case I found them quite unheeding. 
Main course? Not such great variety! Choices are poor but they can surely improve this if want!
Ambience is excellent, enriched with ethnic decor. 
Overall, Great service for Bengali cousin in town.

The food here was so excellent! Everything we ordered was delicious and tasted home made. The staff was very helpful and accommodating as well. The restaurant itself is very quaint, it's is an old colonial style home which has been conversed into a restaurant. I'm not from Kolkatta, but I will Still recommend this place if you're in the city and I will definitely go back if I visit Kolkatta again!
I'd recommend the Bengali fish fry, the coconut gravy prawns, the eggplant in mustard gravy and the jaggery ice cream.. all so, so delicious!

I went for their special buffet lunch on 31st December, with my family. 
First and foremost, brilliantly decorated interiors. They sure know how to create an ambience!
Secondly, the spread was quite elaborate, as you will notice in the pictures. They served fresh Luchi (bread) and Begun Bhaja (Deep fried eggplant) on the table and a welcome drink (Gondhoraj Ghol, fixed for the day) too. My personal favourites? The Mangsher Chop, Gondhoraj Ghol and Baked Roshoglla. Being a Bengali, I get to try good Bengali food, served up by most of my relatives. Even though there is room for improvement (such as the Begun Bhaja fried for longer and the Chingri Machher Malai Curry, could have been so much better), I can still confidently say, 6 Ballygunge Place serves pretty good quality bengali cuisine.

We had gone here on ashtami this year.
The pujo buffet was costlier than the usual ones.
And there was enough special items which made it worth.
The buffet got us luchis,potol bhaja,begun bhaja,dehradun rice,moong dal,rui machher kalia,murgi kosha,pathar jhol,illish maach bhapa,chingrir malaikara.
Like yes all the heavenly bangali khabar put together.Also came with a complimentary ghol.
Sesh paatey chaatni,mishti doi,sandesh,moong puli was certainly there.
Any bangali should visit here.All the items are perfectly cooked to allure the taste buds.
Apart from this we took a mocktail which also tasted nice.
Beautiful house turned into a restaurant gives a homely feeling with some great interior decors and antique furniture.😍

This place never dishearten anyone ever. If you really wanna try Bengali food, this is one of the best option and it's really b@ang for the bucks. After a long time visited on 31st December and like everytime the experience was memorable. 
Mutton was finger licking tasty and Golda chingri was just out of this world. Great hospitality, Happy to have food. Super recommend for family lunch or dinner.

When it comes to indian bengali authentic cuisine these people are the ultimate. 

It was a house named after its address and fter this many people followed the naming trend.

The buffet is classy 

Almost 20+dishes and desserts were there .

Being a bengali i salute them

Went there for lunch. We ordered strawberry shake, mishti pulao, shorshe ilish, chitol macher muitha, doi murgi, and nolen gur er ice cream. The ambiance was really nice and very home-y. The food was delicious, but Ive had better. Being a bengali, food from even the best restaurant cannot beat my Thamma's traditional bengali food. But food here was pretty close to that. Had a great experience overall.

Finally got time to rate this place. I was there on my birthday. I am a huge bengali cuisine fan so wanted to try this place on my special day but got disappointed not because of their quality of food or ambience but because there was hair in my food twice!!! I so hated it. One of the staffs, who was serving our food, tried to ignore the matter and was giggling about it so i got disgusted. Another staff was well behaved and apologised for the whole mishap. The rating solely goes to the quality of food.

I haven't been here personally but having had catered food from here in a wedding and a seminar I attended a while back,I felt compelled to write a review. The food here is excellent. It's very easy for Bengalis to nit-pick in restaurant made Bengali dishes but 6 Ballygunge Place deserves the niche it has carved itself in the Bengali restaurant food scenario in Kolkata. The gondhoraj chicken, bhetki paturi and Kosha mangsho are my favourites. They had catered pure vegetarian dishes for the seminar and I remember eating till I was full to the brim! For dessert I had had Chanar Payesh served in Chocolate cups and baked Mihidana and Sondesh too. Just thinking about them makes me hungry. Great job 6BP!

Wanna go out for an authentic bengali meal? 6BP is the must go for you. 
Their buffet spread is elaborate and super delicious. 
They have chitol maacher muittha, mutton kosha, chicken, pabda maacher jhaal, cholaar daal, luchi, shada bhaat, aloor dom, daal puri. 
The luchi mangsho combo there is my fav. 
For sweets, there was roshogolla, gurer shondesh and  aam er chutney. 
All the preparations were amazing. Well done. 
Absolutely lovely experience. :D

This is a decent place for Bengali food. We had dinner buffet on Christmas day. I liked the fact that they served medium sized prawns as part of the buffet menu that too on a festival day. But I was expecting better taste for the curry items. Maybe taste is an individual factor but most of us agreed that the curry could have been better. I liked that they had few continental items too. The grilled chicken was good. I am giving this a 4 rating for the awesome desserts. They had caramel pudding and baked sandesh which were yum. Also they had cake since it was Christmas. Overall good experience!

We have had food here end number of times since we came to Kolkata in 2009 and also have introduced a lot of friends to the place. We have always liked the food (always ordered a la carte) but found the service and courtesy of the staff bad. Nevertheless we went back for the food. Yesterday christmas day we went with full enthusiasm to have a choice of our food through a la carte. We were told only buffet was available, we sat down anyway. My son who is 6years old usually never had choice her he would just eat luchi, fried fish and steamed rice and he was happy with it. Yesterday however all the food on the buffet was spicy except for the white rice and papad. I asked the staff if something non spicy can be made for my child he said no. I asked him to request the floor manager who bluntly said no and then goes on to say we will not charge the child. As i said earlier courtesy of staff here is bad but this was the heights, he actually expected all of us adults to enjoy the food while my 6year old boy who was so hungry watches us doing so. Shame on 6 Ballygunge place a shame to think that this is where i took all my foreigner friends who wanted a taste of Bengali culture. Shame shame shame.

Tasted the Bhuna Mangsho, Papdar Jhal, Chitol Maacher peti, Baati chodchodi, which were all excellent. The icing on the top of the cake was the Nolen Gurer ice-cream, which was heavenly.

When good, nay excellent service accompanies excellent food - you know you've come to the right place. And of course - this is as true for this restaurant. The funny thing being - I had been hearing so much about this restaurant and even had their food couple of times but as takeaways ordered by others! So when I finally landed up here, along with a friend who was visiting Kolkata and wanted to have the authentic Bengali experience - you can say I made the perfect choice. Despite me reaching earlier and opting for the buffet, the staff gave me a table. Needless to say, both of us loved the food (and I say this despite being used to the same fare at home) as well as the very courteous staff. An evening well spent, indeed!

OVERHYPED?? OVERPRICED?? Huh.... I FELT OVEREATING AND DEFINITELY GOING FOR 2ND TIME AND 3RD TIME ALSO...
I don't really like to have a pure bengali food in a star bengali restaurant, as I Belong to the group who believe 'My mom's cooking is the best'. It was my first bengali restaurant hangout with my beloved fiancée and we willfully chose to have a sunday lunch buffet in this famous, authentic bengali cushine on a very special day. So that obviously worths a review.
BUFFET MENU - gondhoraj ghol
1. Fulko luchi
2. Chhaka tele vaja begun served smoking hot
3. Alurdom
4. Chhanar kopta
5. Macher chop
6. Basmati chaler vat
7. Kaju kismis polao
8. Sona mug daal
9. Sakvaja
10. Alukorola vorta
11. Golda chingrir malaikari
12. Pabda sorse
13. Bangladeshi murgir jhol

15. Anaras er chatni
16. Khejur amsotto chatni
17. Papad vaja
18. Nolen gurer rosogolla
19. Misti doi
20. Chitrokut
Now come to the review of the food....
All the itens were freshly prepared and of the best quality and taste. Pabda sorse was the best..no no morich mangso, actually both won the heart of us and I should visit again to decide the winner( lol). Galda chingri malaikari was not bad at all... Chingri size was medium to big( should not expect jumbo size). Chicken was soft, a bit less spicy( patla jhol ar gorom vat ar robibar er dupur, aha, ar ki chai. Polao complemented morich mangso tastefully or vice  versa. Enough said ( or eaten ;-) ). Come to the desert- misti doi was just awsmmm.( I wish I could have an extra stomach for the whole handi).
 The ambience, decor was nice, as we were having a meal in a very old jamindar bari. The staffs are very polite, helpful. Service was upto the mark.

CONS- 
Rosogolla was good in taste, but i expected sponge variety and was disappointed as it was soild rosogolla, that is my personal opinion ofcourse.

Loochi is not a starter at all that is been served here and this is the only starter they can offer apart from beguni. But bengalis have a loot of starters. I think 6 Ballygunge place should increase their variety of items. I missed rosogolla!!  If u have ur maa's recipes everyday then 6 Ballygunge place is nothing new. Vegetarians.... please, this is notba place for u.

Definitely one of the best, if not the best, restaurants for authentic Bengali cuisine. The name of the restaurant is obviously derived from the actual postal address of the place.

The best way to try out most dishes within a limited budget is to try their lunch & dinner buffet. (They even have special buffets during special occasions, so keep a good lookout..!!) Well-mannered helpful staff are always at hand to offer you good suggestions and prompt service. A nice stream of Bengali music wafts down from the speakers and creates a splendid ambience.

The luchi, sukto, potol with fish filling, mourala machh bhaja, chital macher muitha, dak bangla mutton, gandhoraj fish/chicken, prawn malaikari are mouth watering. During buffet, you have an endless flow of hot luchis served on your table.

A definite try if you crave on Bengali food and if you don;t want to burn your pocket, then buffet is the best option to opt for, no regrets!!

[edit] : You can also visit the 6 Ballygunge Place Thali outlets in various places, or their stall in the Acropolis Mall food court to sample their dishes.

This place is well known for its authenticity of Bengali cuisine. Recently they had renovatated and now the place has a new, more authentic Bengali look and feel to it. 

The food is of a very good quality and the quantity was food too. The brand name of this place has become so strong that it is now anonymous to authentic good Bengali cuisine.

Visited this place with my family today. As soon  as u enter it's a feeling like ur in a bengali rajbari. The ambience is spot on giving the Bengali feel. We were seated on the 1st floor.We asked Manav to help us with the menu specially the starters and the things he adviced us were really tasty. The server debobroto sorry "about the spelling" is trained well as they were introducing the dish before serving us and asking if every thing is good or any complaints. I'm pretty impressed with this place. I always thought kasturi in new market had the best Bengali food but it seems this place is my new favorite. The .5 is missing cause tell ur staff to ask the guest their name as it makes us feel good and also to introduce them self to us.now coming to the food we started with afghani chicken at first we thought it was fish cause the meat was perfectly cooked and tender. The second starter we took was some mutton egg cutlet type which was really yum and a different dish which I never had. For main course we ordered bhetki and ilich paturi they were so yum and the mustard din overpower the fish. Prawn malai curry and dab chingri were really yummy both were made with coconut based but the texture and flavores were different. Mutton curry was good. It din blow my mind or anything but it was good.

Had a family get together and food was ordered from here.Tried the following items:
1) moong dal- (3/5)very light and tasty! It also had peas which made it look colourful! 
2) cauliflower curry:(2/5) just the regular cauliflower curry we bengalis make at home.
3)chhanar Dalna:(4/5) this one tasted great with the cottage cheese balls really soft! Recommended!
4) pabda fish curry: (4/5) another very light and tasty curry...with hardly any spice! People with a preference towards light curries should go for this!
5) Golda chingri (lobsters): (2.5/5) I am not much of a lobster fan yet this dish didn't disappoint me as much as other lobster dishes do! If I could find this dish okay-then the dish is good! People who like lobsters should try...
6) chicken curry-(5/5) I absolutely loved this dish! Boneless pieces of chicken that were properly marinated in spices and the gravy tasted superb!A must try for all!
Overall the food was great and cooked in a very homely Bengali way! Bengalis would love this place for sure... 😃

I have been wanting to visit this one for a long time. I have been hearing about the great food they serve here, the fact that they have converted a house into a restaurant was pretty intriguing. So, one Sunday afternoon, I visited this place for a family lunch. It looks like a house from outside (well, was is a house, so duh…) and was packed with people waiting to get their tables. We were told that there was a one hour wait, and honestly we had expected just that. Nevermind, good things take time to brew. So, we waited eagerly for our turn. The waiting room was adorned with a lot of interesting antiques…. An old globe and a mirror amongst others.

Finally the hour passed and we were taken to our seats. There was an old Bengali charm to the entire lace, and I simply loved the layout of their menu card, which contained recipes of Bengali classics like radhaballabhi and chingri malaikari, all written in beautiful verse. Well, so far so good.
 Coming to the food, for starters, we ordered fish fry, steamed aam kaundi murgi and gondhoraj chicken. The fish fry was amazing and I realized why so many were raving about it. Thin but crisp coating, a thick fillet of flaky, delicious bhetki and a great kasundi to go with it. It was one of the best fish fries I have had yet. The steamed aam kasundi murgi was probably the weakest link in the entire menu. Wrapped in gourd leaves (lau pata), the chicken was pretty tasty but soon became a tad monotonous. But my personal favourite was the Gondhoraj Chicken. We had decided to order two plates and we did not regret it. Slightly crisp exterior, perfectly cooked bits of chicken, bits of coriander and most importantly, the dominant flavor of gondhoraj. It was absolute bliss.

Next time the main course. We ordered Daab Chingri (one of their specialities), dhonepata kachalonka murgi and kosha mangsho, with kaju kismis polao and parathas. It did not take us more than a bite to realize why the Daab Chingri is their speciality. Delicate flavours, plump and perfectly cooked prawns. It could not have been better. The dhonepata kachalonka murgi tasted great with the polao, but it was just a tad underseasoned.  As for the Kosha Mangsho, it was brilliant. Soft mutton, rich and spicy gravy, it paired perfectly with the sweet polao and also the parathas. Special mention was be made of the polao, which I loved to bits. Probably one of the best I have had in a long time.

Although we were pretty full by the time, you simply cannot end a Bengali meal without something sweet. So we went ahead and ordered a hot and a cold dessert (not that we planned it that way, but I love it when things work out). The hot dessert, baked mihidana with rabri, was hands down one of the best Indian desserts I have had. I love a bit of fusion and the mihidana pearls blended absolutely  perfectly with the rich, creamy rabri on top, accentuated by the slight texture of almond and pistachio. The gentle warmth of the dish made it even better. We devoured it in a matter of seconds. The Nolen Gurer Ice cream tasted just as it should, full marks on that. As a big fan of Nolen Gur (well, who isn’t?), I was blown away by the taste.  But there was something about the texture, a touch of graininess which I did not like. But still, a great way to end the meal.

The service was absolutely top notch. All dishes of each course hit the table at the same time, and it looked very little time to do so. The staff were extremely polite and helped us in choosing some of our dishes, answering our queries. Value for money? Well, considering the food served, I would say you get excellent bang for your buck here. I will definitely be  going back to this place, time and time again.

Went to 6 ballygunge place with a friend who had come down from Delhi as he wanted to experience some Bengali food and this was the closest. The place was a house which has now been converted into a restaurant which has a nice feel to it.

Confused what to order from the a la carte menu, we went in for the buffett, the buffett spread isn't that huge when compared to other buffett places but it covers the basic dishes. I had the rice, moong daal, chicken in orange and mustard sauce and mutton in gravy, radha ballabi and aloo dum. All the food was amazing,especially the mutton, very well prepared and extremely soft. 

For desserts there was malpua and mishti doi, the mishti doi was just amazing. The staff was helpful in getting food to the table when our hands were too full. Overall an amazing experience.

To celebrate an occasion went for the Saturday Lunch Buffay at this restraunts.Located at the exact same address as the name suggest, has a forecourt and car parking assistance.
The Buffay section is at the Ground floor, though I guess Ala- carte can also be ordered sitting on the same floor.The Buffay pavilion is quiet big with scope for easy movement.
As per my counting there were 17 varieties of dishes, including Welcome beverage , Starters, Main course varieties, Accompanying dishes, and the quient essential Bengali Sweets.Welcome drink and the freshly fried Luchi and Begun Bhaja were served at the table.For the main course one has to go for self help.In the main buffay spread there were two varieties of fish items- one in the form of Fish Chop, the other one was "Pabda Shorsha" .Two varieties of meat as well - " Dhona Kachalanka Murghi" & " Kochi pathar Jhol".Each of the buffay items were fresh and the raw materials were of supreme quality, as any foodie can judge it from the taste .Obviously, Chatni & Papadom was there.Sweet section had only two varieties- "Misti Doi" & " Gulab Jamun" .
Frankly, was very satisfied with the taste and hospitality.Though I would have been delighted if instead of two varieties of fish it would have been three and a bigger spread of Bengali Sweets.How can a Bengali buffay spread be absolutely fulfilling with out a bigger and better option in the Desert section.At a little over Rs 660 /- per head inclusive of tax, the buffay at this Bengali restaurant is a delight.

Never tried their non veg dishes. The veg items are not that great. The spice is very similar and too much salt. Not a big fan of excess oil, spice and salt in my food

Ballygunge 6, the original down on Ballygunge Place, is a joy to visit! First the interiors are neat, yet innovative, created by one of India's most respected architectural firms! Next it's cozy and comfortable and quiet enough to hear your mates speaking! But don't sit downstairs in the buffet! It's noisy, a little pushy and a bit of a fish market! 
Get upstairs! But that's your choice. Try Shikoku, Bheti Jhal, Chalkumro Narkel Diye Bhajahari and Mishti Doi!
Without giving names, I rate this the world's top Bengali restaurant. Mainly for the food! Fresh fish, carefully prepared in great sauces !
Don't leave Kolkata without visiting 6 Ballygunge Place!

It was durga puja saptami. We had a lunch over there. Situated at proper ballygunge near patha bhavan school. Due to the durga puja rush only buffet was available.
   Tried almost every item. Plain rice was there along with Basanti polaw. Chicken curry, chingri malai curry, dhokar dalna, Shona mug dal was there in the menu. Each and every item was superb!! At first they served doi er ghol. Begun vaja, mangsho kabaab, fish fry was there in the starter. They served a bucket of fulko luchi. In desert there was chatni, papad, rajbhog, malpoa, kesari doi, chocolate sondesh!!! The keasri doi was yummy !!!

Had the buffet on my birthday with my brother. The ambience is really nice. The food was decent. I don't like their dum aloo at all, and I feel for my sake they should change the recipe. The other items were okay. There weren't many. Especially in the dessert section. It was kind of a disappointment. I think  choosing to eat a la carte would have been better.

BONG CONNECTION...

Over the recent few years, Kolkata has been bursting with a plethora of restaurants promising ethnic Bengali cuisine and some recipes that are about to be lost or become extinct. Such places claim that Bengal food is part of Heritage cuisine or Vintage food. 6 Ballygunj Place is not just a name, but an address to such food. The chefs cook well, they taste good and they are served nicely. But what the menu offers sometimes makes me question what is in there that can't be home-cooked!
I never got an answer.
Or may be my answer was different and will be....
It is indeed relative...

'Quintessential Bengali Cuisine' is an apt word for this place. Be it their ambience & decor or food & service. Bengalis as most Indians are die hard foodies and to know why land here.

I had been to this place on some afternoon like a day before Durga Pooja. The whole city in festive mood and leading me to this classy restaurant was like a grand welcome to my tummy :D

I have had 'A` la carte' and their buffet both.

A` la carte - 
Foodgasm at its best. I had Bhetki fish fry to start with.
Next came two curries - Maachher Matha Diye Moong Dal  & Bhapa Ilish (steamed Hilsa in mustard gravy) to go along with white rice and Jhur jhure Aloo Bhaja as sides (thinner version of French fries- just amazing).

Both the curries comes with green chillies almost raw and trust me all you spice lovers it just explodes like asteroids on your tastebuds. Finally the dessert Nolen gurer icecream ( jaggery with icecream) - a best treat to your wagging tongues after some spicy yummy food , which made my dining experience just perfect. And trust me this is one of a kind dessert you must try !

Buffet -
Buffet was abysmal and for that 1k plus taxes it's definitely not worth it. The spread was good but the quality is like zero apropos 'A` la carte'. So the management needs to do something about that.

To sum it up this place is worth many visits to try more amazing stuff on their A` la carte :)

Such a homely atmosphere. Welcome drink was super awsomee. Food!! My god. Being a bangali I would love to say super tasty and fresh. Served well when needed. Served according to our request and instructions. Variety of the items were awesome. Didn't find any minus point. Already visited twice. Will visit 100 tomes more. Still my mouth started watering while thinking about the menu and  giving this review.

And it rightly deserves the top spot in Rankings for বাঙালি Restaurants.
The Excellent fish fries, Ilish Macher Paturi, Mutton Duckbunglow etc. are all worth craving for.

On the day of Dashami we went to lunch there, they had a special Durga Pujo lunch buffet. For Bengali cuisine this place is apt. There was fish chop super yummy, prawn in mustard sauce super duper uber yum and steamed fished wrapped in banana leaf was aweeeesome. Mutton not so great, no flavour just masala. Chicken also not so great.
There were hardly any veg dishes on the buffet, the server got some dishes after my father in law was done eating. Also there was waiting of half n hour after making a booking.

Delightful to see the old house renovated at its best to convert it into an ethnic fine dine bengali cuisine restaurant... Splendid... 8 of us went for a family lunch today... It is really appreciable to see such a decor... We reached at around 12.30 am, almost at the time of opening... We opted for buffet non-veg... Welcome drink as gondho raj lebu r ghol, Starter as luchi, begun bhaja, mourola macher piyaji, main course rice, muger daal, kono saag vaja, kumror varta, sukto, rui sorshe, dhone pata lonka chicken, mutton jhol. In desert, aamsotto khejur er chatni, anaros er chatni, papad, misti doi, paantua...
Mourola macher piyaji was awesome, chicken, mutton, sukto, daal, saag vaja all were cooked excellently... Rohu fish was big in size as a result, taste was not comparable with other dishes... Also I recommend to discontinue rohu fish in buffet... Misti doi and pineapple chutni was too good... 
Overall the ambience and hospitality of the staff was courteous... Thank you for the experience..

Had been waiting to try out this place for a while, and it has been worth the wait !!  Very cosy and homely setup, makes one relax completely.  Ordered 3 vegetables - all perfectly done, absolutely authentic. Special mention goes for mochar ghonto and aam kasundi bhindi !!  Fish were fabulous, fresh and the right balance of the spices. The pick was daab chingri, though the chitol maacher peti and kankra gravy tasted a bit similar.  And of course a beautiful sweet ending with nolen gurer ice-cream. A big thank you to the lovely, friendly and helpful staff, and kudos to the chef ! Only minus, is the lack of parking. Looking forward to my next visit !!

Went there today to celebrate my dad's bday, place looks regal since its a heritage building. We had a wait time for 30mins. Place was super crowded and seating congusted. We ordered for 3 buffets and a grilled chicken and mocktaits. Service is slow and food quality is average. I was a little disappointed I must say. On the positive side portioning is good and prawn size was big. Total bill 2900 total. So pocket pinch is reasonable.

Items which I liked most were Potoler dorma, Chingri Malaikari, Mutton Kasha and a lot in the dessert which i forgot at present. Lastly a Misti Pan- a complete bengali feeling!!

6 Ballygunge place is famous for its Classic Bengali ambience & I totally agree with that. The food is great but Buffet choices are a bit limited. From my experience, if you are looking for a 'Bangali Khana' you should visit this place.

The Price was 550 plus Tax on weekdays but the choices were pretty limited:

Gondhoraj lebu diye doiyer ghol, Loochi, Begun Bhaja, Rice, Aloor Dum, Shak bhaja, Dhokar Dalna, Muger Dal, Sorshe diye Rui, Chicken, Mutton Kasha, Anaras Chatni, Tomato chatni, Papad, Misti Doi & Rasogolla.

We were a bit disappointed to see the Dessert, we expected better from them. However we ordered Baked Mihidana & Baked Gulab Jamun from A la Carte but again quantity was not as expected.

Overall I would rate this place a 4/5 for great Bengali theme & classic Bengali food.

I went there ( Saltlake ) on "Ashtomi" this year it was totally converted to BUFFET restaurant on that day which was not intimated over phone when booked.  Totally mismanaged by few unprofessional people . Only Ground floor is considerably furnished as per Bengli ambiance is concerned but it was just mess in 1st ,2nd and 3rd floor. I will not suggest anybody who loves taking food with time and good ambiance in any occasion in this particular restaurant.

Truely speaking it was divine. My family had taken the buffet. I could see the pleasure received by them by th quality and taste of the food served. They loved it a lot. It was mohaloya special menu containign kochuri, begun bhaja, hinger alur dum,sak bhaja, alu sedho, dal, chicken cutlet, dhokar dalna, rice, pulao, chitol macher muithaya, mutton kosha, dhonepata kachalonka chicken, papor,2 typer chutney, doi, malpoa and malai chomchom. According to them everything was good and worth taking more than one.

Me and my family went there on saptami during durga puja. It was crowded as expected and they had a special pujo menu from sashti to dashami. The buffet prices were 1000+tax for non veg and 800+ tax for veg. Non veg one was okay seeing the menu but veg one was bit expensive according to me. There were gondhoraaj lebu ghol, luchi, begunbhaja, dal, dhokar dalna, fish fry,dhaniya fried chicken, chingri malaikari, chicken curry, kosha mangsho, chatni, baked mishti doi, rosogolla,chhanar malpoa etc etc. Food was yummy. Every dish was too good. I loved the ambience too. But the waiters weren't attentive. We had to call them again n again for drinking water and other stuffs. Overall its a good place for authentic bengal cuisine. ♥

When it comes to Durga puja, good food is the prerogative of Bengalis. And to suffice this, we all end up queueing outside the pioneers of our delectable cuisine. Pocket pinch doesn't matter to even the middle class. There is only one thing we all desire - foodgasm. 
For a similar intention I chose this place for a family dinner on saptami night. The memories of a smoked hilsa from 2011 made me opt for this place with a lot of confidence. However, my expectations were buried with every dish I tasted from the buffet line up. 
Apart from a brilliant fish fry, all the items were pretty abysmal. I mean may be I wouldn't say the same if this was a road side joint charging minimal cost. But for a 1.2k buffet I absolutely would call it a disaster. Yes the food was edible and had color to it. But taste, which I consider the biggest factor in judging food, was miles away from the dishes this place served.
The service was good and the staff congenial. But these positives weren't enough to cover up the negatives.
I do hope this was an isolated incident. I still hope this place sustains the potential to serve delicious Bengali cuisine and I get to witness the same when I go back sometime in the future.

The first time I went to this place was to invite Mr. Sushanta Sengupta to my school Delhi Public School, Ruby Park, Kolkata. When I went there and saw the restaurant I really liked it in there, Then Mr. Sengupta came to our school and I was lucky enough to have a taste of the few things he made. That is when I made up my mind to go this place. Trust me you wont regret it. This is by far the best bengali cuisine you will ever have in Kolkata.

Went on panchami lunch buffet..750/- + tax ....Went 1st floor as prior table booked ....Staffs were very humble n attentive...first they want to know whether we would take buffet or a la carte..in lunch buffet ghol with gondhoraj lebu served as a complementary drink..then luchi n begun bhaja served as a starter ...in buffet kumror chokka, plain rice, mug daal, polao, dhokar dalna, alur dam, mangsher chop n raita, rohu sorshe, chingri malakari, doi murgi, bangaladeshi mutton , anaros chatni, khejur amsotto chatni, misti doi, totapuli, baked sandesh were there ...every dish tastes awesome ..though I liked chingri malaikari n baked sandesh most ...wish to go next time for a la carte option ..have to taste their special dab chingri...
This outlet is very spacious....look like a well maintained purono bari not a restaurant feel will be there ..very quiet n calm environment ..no chaos at all..family get together is ideal for this place ...4  medium decorated (separate pattern) rooms on 1st floor n ground floor well interior designed ....

I have been to this restaurant multiple times. My earlier visits include their regular buffets and a grand Durga Puja buffet in 2012.

My last visit to them happened yesterday for Durga Puja Saptami. 6 Ballygunge Place has organised mega buffets on all the 5 days during the festival. It was a family get together/dinner with most of us coming from different parts of the country to celebrate the festivities. This dinner holds special significance to the family as all our cousins, uncles, aunts gather for the same. Coming to the price part of it - charges for the buffet is 1205/-. And here is the menu that they offered for Saptami dinner -

Gandhoraj Ghol
***
Radhaballavi
Steam Rice
Badshahi Pulao
Aam Aada Diye Moong Dal
Begun Bhaja
Dhakai Aloo Dum
Dhokar Dalna
Fish Fry with Kasundi
Chingri Macher Malai Curry
Gandhoraj Fried Chicken
Aamla Madhur Murgi
Dhakai Dum Mangsho
Aamer Chutney
Papad
***
Baked Kesari Doi
Rosogolla
Chhanar Malpoa
Chocopill Sandesh
***
Pan 

We were told to pay the restaurant in advance as the demand is very high and we will not get any seats even if we reserve tables by calling them prior. Only an advance payment will ensure you are allowed and given seats as per the booking time. And guess what? No online payments allowed. You have to go to their outlet and pay there itself.
Anyhow after completing all their so called procedures for the coveted Saptami dinner and braving the million people gathered in Ballygunge area - we reached there right on time. 
However to our utter surprise - none of the dishes in that long buffet was good. All the non veg items - starters as well as main course dishes were extremely disappointing with Dhakai Dum Mangsho - topping the chart. The mutton gravy was greasy with no particular taste to write about. Both Gondhoraj Ghol and Gondhoraj Fried Chicken - had no flavour of Gondhoraj lime. The Dhoka in the Dalna was so hard that you can use them as paperweights instead. Fish Fry had way too much salt. At one point we prayed to the god that the desserts should not be as disastrous. However our prayers were not heard by the chefs of this restaurant. A very hard Malpoa, extremely sweet Rosogolla and the baked Doi - in a state between Doi and pudding - just added to the peril. Overall the buffet was a disaster. Since we were a group of 10 people you can easily do the math how much it would have cost for the entire group. 
I have one word of advice for the management of 6 Ballygunge Place - when you are charging premier rates for the buffet - please bring your A game with it. Please don't charge such a hefty fee if you can't match that with the  quality and taste.
So word of caution for all those who are planning to go for their Durga Puja mega buffet - please find an alternate and avoid this place during Pujas.

Subho Sharodiya to all my lovely readers! I am so happy as I am in my hometown for the Pujas. And also a sorry because I am late in posting this. Guess what today's story is?  6 Ballygunge Place is the very name.

Celebrate the festive season with the grand buffet at 6 Ballygunge Place, the main branch at Ballygunge. Recently, the food bloggers of PanchPhoron were invited over lunch for the Puja Buffet menu launch. 

I was amazed at the hospitality and courteousness of the staff and the management. Next what caught my attention was the vintage looking decor giving it a feel of the ages. 

Next came the welcome drink Gondhoraj Lebur Ghol. I simply fell in love with its taste, the creamy texture and the aroma of the lemons.

Now let me take you to an insight to what the restaurant has to offer in its scintillating Puja menu.

Doi Murgi

Luchi

Shorshe Bhapa Chingri

Bhaja mosla Aaloo Dum

Baishali Mangsher Jhol

Rui Machher Roast

Kaju Kishmish Pulao

Kosha Mangsho

Baked Sondesh

Didn't you just love what's there in the menu? The Puja menu has been crafted in such a manner so that it caters to your taste buds at its best with the Bengali cuisine. 

I am definitely going for the Puja buffet one of the Puja days out here! Join me in.

Much love! Hugs! Happy Puja!

Our experience was not good. When we had booked 7/8 days before panchami we were told the price of 584 per head and the price would be higher from Shoshti (6th Oct). So we booked for Panchami(5th Oct). But the day before Panchami when we called to reconfirm the booking, they told the price is 750 and we were surprised to hear that front desk person might make the mistake and we have to pay 750 if we want to reconfirm/continue the booking for Panchami.

We reconfirmed for Panchami with 750 as we had already invited our guests on Panchami and didnt have any other option because it festival time so we accepted there option

Whenever comes to authentic bengali foods sometimes it’s quite hard to select which one is better,where to go.if you’re still confused then don’t think just go for 6Ballygunge place where you will find lip-smacking foods,old kolkata “Bonedi barir” look as well as “Bonedi barir appayon”.this place is very popular and famous for their mouth-watering bengali foods.Durga pujo,bengali’s and foods attached with each other.the place is beautifully maintainted,surrounded by classy interiors as well with lovely ambience.soothing music playing in the background,a perfect atmosphere for chill out over couple of lip-smacking dishes.recently i was went there over a food tasting session with my fellow foodies.apart from the buffet menu section they introduced authentic bengali dishes which will available from this week Panchami to Dashami.we started with Gondhoraj ghol which was made with yogurt and gondhoraj lemon,it was made perfectly,very cool and refresing.

Outstanding! Was here for a solo lunch and really didn't miss having company thanks to the food! The buffet was not bad at all, and has a lot of variety even for vegetarians. Very traditionally made dishes: baigun bhaja, greens bhaja, dhokar dal, bangladeshi chicken jhol etc

I believe the a la carte is much nicer and hope to try it out the next time

If you're a Bengali and love prawns, then I would say it's a right place to have 'Daab Chingri' (Prawns in a coconut). The other Bengali delicacies are eventually good. Try to have the thali. It's a better place to have lunch with family. Though services might be provided a bit lately, if the restaurant is full. They should put more effort on providing more space and washrooms.

I would like to give it the title of the Best Bengali Cuisine outlet in town!! I had been here for a lunch buffet with my friends and recently i had the opportunity to have ala Carte in the dinner which was just awesome. Each food served overrides the taste of the other! 
I went here for a dinner arranged by my maternal aunt and uncle and the food just got me bowled over. The decor was just too good. We had the complimentary drinks and fish fry .The fish fry needs a special mention it was a pure delicacy ! 
In the starters we had gondhoraj chicken , then luchi and cholar dal, in the main course we had rice ,bhapa ilish,chitol macher muittha , and mutton kosha . The hilsa fish was extremely tasty and was beautifully made, chittol mach was another delicacy it was soft and melted in the mouth and the mutton was yummyyyy!! In the dessert we had nolen gurer ice cream which was another amazing sweet tooth in the end.
The staff here is extremely courteous and friendly that one feels like at home .Amazing service ,amazing food,and the money you spend on this amazing dishes is just worth it !!!!

Very few restaurants get a 5 rating from me, happy to say this one surely deserves it. We were three of us, two veg and one non-veg, we tried 5 different veg dishes and I took Hilsa made in mustard sauce. Every item was just amazing. Done with care and perfection and served well. The place itself was nicely done, decor is in white and servers are well trained. Best part is their dishes are small portions and priced accordingly, which prompted us to try so many of them. One of the soulful foods that I have had in a long time.

Today they served 200 veg food packet in my college (special order). It contained alur dom, luchi, potoler dorma, green peas rice, chatni, mishti and salad. I hsve never tried such worst alur dom, potatoes were half boiled with excess spices. Luchi was quite thick. I have never expected such poor service from 6 ballygunge place. The only item -potoler forma was good.

Recently visited this famous restaurant with family members and I was impressed with the kind of renovation it has gone through. The entire decor has been changed and changed for good. The restaurant now looks grand with the artistic designs; and the colours and themes are refreshing to the eyes. However, there was no need to change the quality of the food because the food was the best one can hope for. From Luchi to Mutton Dak Banglow, every item was delicious. If you are going for buffet menu then is it advisable to have the Sorshe Pabda as it was clearly the best fish preparation served by the restaurant to its customers. However, the Dab Chingri was pretty average compared to the other items and I did not enjoy it. Overall it is the one of the best Bengali cuisine restaurants in the city and remains so with the new look and decor.

I absolutely loved the renovated milieu. This is my third visit to the place which serves quintessential Bengali food. The place has lived up to the Goodwill of that they have earned in terms of unamalgamated Bengali food. Paturi was the victor of the war today for me. The decor is adding that extra panache to the place. Loved the experience.

Birthday Dinner couldn't have been better! 
This was my first visit to this outlet of the restaurant. Recently revamped, this place spectacles you with its quintessential Victorian Bengal era charm. The spectacular Arched doorways, Birdcage chandeliers, Potochito and Shahaj Paath sketches on walls and the menu, aesthetically hung paintings and lanterns, Custom made designer Sharbari Dutta plates and cushions, a Gramophone here or a Rotary dial telephone there, It would seem like you've stepped into an extravagant studio!
Coming to the food, we ordered Koraishutir Kochuri, Pur Bhara Doi Potol, Kaju Kishmish Polao, Chitol Maachher Muitha and Bhetkir Paturi.
We also ordered a mocktail named 3, Gour Mohan Chatterjee Street. All the dishes were excellent. Although I would suggest not to order the chitol machher muitha. It tasted like the frozen chicken sausages available in stores. Paturi was brilliant. The staff is very courteous. This place is a must visit for everyone who digs bengali cuisine. Would love to go back again!

Visited this place for the 1st time yesterday for dinner with relatives and we opted for buffet. The ambience was OK not something to write home about. The seating arrangement was a bit cramped in the sense that for buffet one has to regularly get up to get refills and it was difficult moving in and out of the chairs in the space provided. One could only get out from one side of the table, where the chairs were against the walls. The Service I would rate as poor on account of the fact that two of us had sore throats and wanted drinking water at normal or ambient temperature. The staff told us they could only serve Chilled water !! In a fine dining restaurant, this was simply shocking and unacceptable. The net result was that my relatives avoided drinking water during the course of the meal. Probably, many other patrons face the same problem. The Management should redress this issue at the earliest if they want to maintain their reputation.

Regarding the buffet spread the hot hing kochuris and kumro bhaja were good. The Tomato-borboti bharta was a first time experience and excellent. The aloo dum was so so. The Begun basanti was good - but I would have preferred if they had used longer brinjals instead of the short ones. The fresh Parshe mach and Kosha mangsho were excellent. The Chingri preparation was not upto the mark and I did not get to taste the Murgir jhol. The two varieties of Chutneys on offer were good. However, I was very disappointed with the desserts on offer. It:  was only Mishti Doi and Chanar Jalebi. We Bengalis normally avoid Doi at night. That left us with the Channar Jalebis which were not soft enough. We had to order Ice creams outside the buffet to satisfy our sweet tooth. Buffets everywhere normally have a min of 4-5 items in the dessert. Request Management to look into this.

Overall : FOOD  was very good , AMBIENCE was OK and SERVICE (because of the water fiasco) was POOR. Hence the overall rating of 3.5.

And there are places which are literally meant for the soul. You don't really understand Bengali food unless you try it here. You get the feel of bengaliness after you have looked at the decor, breathed in the environment and gorged on those deliciousness. Smoked ilish, Afgani chicken cutlet, machher matha diye moong daal, Dhokar dalna, Bhuna Chingri, Manshor Jhol and Nolen Gurer ice cream, each one of them were better than the other. If I had it in me, I would have tried all. There was this very interesting drink- I forgot the name, that was good as well. In short, this place is a must visit!

I loved everything about 6 Ballygunge Place !
The decor was going really well with the cuisine offered here i.e Bengali . This place has rooms wherein each room has,say around 4 tables.I loved how each room's decor was slightly different yet not very different that it looks odd if compared with the other rooms.
This is an apt place to come with your family.            The service is really good ! The waiters are polite and hospitable. 
The food here will make you visit this place again and again. 
Eating here is an experience in itself . This place has a Bengali classy vibe (could be also because of the music played )                                                   I'll surely revisit :)

The best bengali food spread in  Kolkatta. This place has its old vintage charm which blends in the aesthetics of old Kolkatta. The lunch buffet spread is just a perfect spread which is so completely uncompromising. The starters both vegetarian and non vegetarian were equally delicious. I would rank a 10 on 10 for the steamed fish in mustard sauce. The zingy mustard paste just blends in so well into the river water fish.
The aam panna worked very well with the meal.

This is one of the places I had been dying to visit! One fine day I made up my mind to have the buffet lunch here. 

The place is really beautiful and I loved the pottery and the elegant decor and obviously the wonderful spread. Without wasting much time I picked up a plate and was up and running! 

Since I am not a bengali, the names flew over my head! I tried a mustard fish wrapped in some leaf which was really toasty. However, I found the mustard flavour a little too strong. Still, I had two helpings of it cause it's fish after all! The chicken was also really tasty! The mutton was amazing too and it was very well cooked. The aloo dum was fabulous! I loved it. It wasn't too hot so I had a lot of it! Another veg dish was there which I found really delicious. I was surprised it was so good. I just can't recall the name. The begun was really well cooked. It was quite tasty. The luchi was also hot and well puffed. 

I ordered an aam porar shorbat separately which was thick and delicious. 

All in all, everything was delicious and well worth the price paid. And that's more than one can get! 

Recommended to all who haven't yet made their way to this classic Bengali restaurant!

Happy Dining!!

The revamped ambiance of this place is defintely worth a mention. They have done up the place very strategically. Coming to the food, it was as usual delicious. Though somehow i liked the spread i had during my last visit. The beckti paturi is worth a mention. Just one little thing- they shud seriously train the staff on the knowledge abt the mocktails available. The one who attended our table had absolutely no idea about the mocktails when asked.

This place should be one of your destination if you love bengali food. Though the location of this restaurant is a little difficult to find, the ambiance, the furniture and of course the food quality will not disappoint a foodie. Service is not that good but it can be compromised. My suggestion is to go for the buffet.

Was looking for a nice place that could serve vegetarian food on a Kolkata visit. My colleague suggested that we visit this restaurant which is housed in a century old building and it served authentic Bengali cuisine. The place was full of surprises - from ambience, to service quality and food - it was a wonderful experience. Mochor ghonto was a unique offering among vegetables and phool-gobhi with aloo was prepared in a different manner. But the icing on the cake was Nolen Gurrer ice cream which is made of date palm jaggery. Highly recommended to everyone who visits this place. We met Palash, the young and dynamic Manager who speaks with lots of passion about the brand - 6 Ballygunj. We were informed that we may soon a version soon in Delhi.

Well , one of the top three restaurants in Kolkata for authentic Bengali cuisine undoubtably. People already aware of it very well . No need to explain it more . Last time I dined out there in poila boisakh , 2016. Food was good but the spread of buffet was less compare to previous years. Did not get their signature fish varities much . But the Ballygunj new renovated outlet was superb. The retro ' Bangaliwana Look' was definitely an eyecatcher .

Really love this outlet of 6 Ballygunj place. Easily one of the best places. It's located on 2 floors and the insides are like that of a bungalow converted into a resteraunt. They have a buffet lunch but I always end up going for a la carte as that offers me choice on what I want. The interiors arw well done and the staff are very friendly and efficient. 
Love the gondoraj starter drink, the gondoraj starter chicken is also great. 

For main course love the patuli ... Chola dal .. the luchi and mostly the kosha mangsho. Very Bengali and very tasty.

*sigh* I am so, so satiated. I had only heard stories about the legend that is 6 Ballygunge Place, but never thought the legend was correct to the fault. 6 Ballygunge Place, Ballygunge is easily one of the best restaurants in the country for Bengali cuisine. Tastefully located in a British mansion, the restaurant boasts of beautiful interiors and elegantly placed structures that bring alive the Victorian era Bengal to its glory.

If you love bengali food and want it n abundance then you should visit this place. Their buffet is well stocked and well prepared. Its an elaborate menu which consists of everything from fish to mutton(chicken and prawns are included too). All the items were fresh and tasted really good. Their pulao was delicious when combined with their mutton. Coming to chicken and mutton, lal murg was good enough but their mutton was really awesome. They even took some and heated it up a bit more than normal temp to make it feel extra yummy. Basha macher paguri was good but they sorse a bit more than required which if removed in the future will certainly make the dish better.
Coming to desserts ,they had two kind of chutney and both were equally good. Though me and my frienda liked the one with pinaples. It was extra classy.
Their service persons were really polite.
Ambience is really peaceful which makes your meal a worth having one.

6 ballygauge Place has established themselves as a premium authentic Bengali restaurant as well as a reknowned catering service in the city and they live up to this reputation quite well.

On a recent visit to their Ballygauge outlet for a family dinner last month I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner starting with fresh fish fry followed by steamed rice ,dal , alu bhaja . Then came the giant chitol peti prepared very well and the polao accompanied with mutton Kassa . Absolutely delightful. In the end the nolen gur er ice cream and the doi bhapa- added to our plate as a dessert.

Simply wow kind of an experience all together starting from the food to the service everything was top notch. We all were extremely satisfied and loved every bit of it. A big thumps up to the team and wish they keep continue the same standards.

WE VISITED THE PLACE FOR LUNCH TODAY AS TODAY IS OUR  MARRIAGE  ANNIVERSARY AND HAD A VERY HORRIFIC EXPERIENCE,  WE ORDERED  FOR  BUFFET , FIRST, THE STAFF WERE VERY RUDE AND FORCING US TO TAKE MOCKTAILS  AND DRINKS AND ARE IN A GREAT HURRY TO PUSH US OUT OF THE RESTAURANT , THEN THE FOOD WAS VERY PATHETIC, EVEN WRITING ABOUT IT I FEEL LIKE VOMITING, AS I THOUGHT THE MUTTON AND CHICKEN WERE COOKED AT LEAST  3 TO 4 DAYS BEFORE, THE CURRY HAVE NO TASTE AT ALL  . I HAD A STOMACH PAIN  IMMEDIATELY    HAD TO RUSH HOME AND THEN HAVE TO VISIT DOCTOR . I HAVE VISITED ALL THE BUFFETS IN THE TOWN LIKE MAINLAND CHINA, SARSON, BARBQUE NATION, FLAME & GRILL, TAPAS BAR, HAKKA, IVORY KITCHEN ETC BUT DOES NOT GET SUCH A  PATHETIC EXPERIENCE BEFORE, AS IT WASTED MY WHOLE DAY EVEN THOUGH THEY TOOK 1470 RUPEES .

This is one of the best bengali food restaurant in town with a lavishing buffet spread. Situated a very posh region of bullygunj, at first it will look like a well decorated house. But when u will enter u will be welcomed by our rich bengali tradition and culture. The ambience is really awesome. 
Coming to food, we opted for buffet. It was a saturday brunch, so the restaurant was almost full. But as we had booked earlier, no problem was there for us. 
We were welcomed by am pora sorbot, luchi, begunvaja.
REst of the items were: Steamed basmati rice, mug dal, choto alurdum, alu vendi, mangsher chop, Pabdar jhal ( which was so awesome, i had 5 pieces of that), lal murgi, mutton jhol. 
In dessert: misti doi, chatni, papad, malpoa was there. All the items were too good. But they should add more 1-2 items in dessert. 
It was a really very nice experience. The total bill was 2651/- for 4 people. I am looking forward to going there again.

Authentic bengali food. Each n every dish is very yummy. Bucket full of flavours.

We went on a week day but since it was a special day they had special menu and d buffet price was 650.

Ambience is ausome.
Loved d prawns. Mutton was also tooo good. We also ordered for ilish kebab which was fabulous. Enjoyd d main course.
Unfortunately misti doi was not in d menu that day.  The sweets were very sweet which was a let down for me.

Overall experience was really very nice.
Itz recommended to call and know the buffet menu and price before booking.

We ordered Luchi Aludam Cholar Dal Shukto and Chanar Dalna  with Khejur and aam Chutney. OOPS how could i forget the Mochar Chop that was the best of the lot. Thoroughly enjoyed the food surely going back at the earliest.

After a long time yesterday visited this place. It was a Sunday lunch and we opted for non veg buffet. We welcomed by aam pora sarbet and starters were served on table, which was loochi & begun bhaja. Others items were rice, peas polao, mug dal, kolmi shak with kashundi, dhoka r dalna, mourola machh er peyaji, chingri (prawn), pabda, chicken, mutton, aam er chatni, khejur aam sotto r chatni, papad, pantua ( gubab jamun), mushti doi, baked mihidana with rabri. The place was really crowded. If it's weekend visit, prior reservation is mandatory. Decor was good but as the place is really crowded, it's difficult to get any ambience. Now coming to food which was actually good. Prawn curry, mourola and pabda were really fresh & tasty. Mutton should be a little soft. Chicken preparation was good as well. Deserts were decent, pantua was soft, mishti doi was good. But didn't like baked mihidana much as it was only mihidana with a layer of rabri on the top.
Service was strictly OK. What was really disappointed that when we were busy with deserts a stuff came & asked us to finish our meal as he said many people were waiting outside. Now it was really unprofessional. We had a prior reservation from 1pm and during our reservation nobody told us any time period of having buffet. We were 13 people and this is the 1st time we have faced such incident while having buffet in any restaurant.

The pocket pinch was moderate, slightly on higher side. Buffet was ₹650+ tax which was ₹783/ person.

Best bengali restaurant in Kolkata! After the renovation, the ambiance has become like a royal palace and the capacity is also increased. You can frequently find celebrities to dine here. You get authentic home cook style bengali food. The items are not to heavy and neither light. Service is awesome. Not to miss out Dab chingri their famous dish. I love their ilish er paturi and also bhetki paturi. Fishes served are fresh so, that increases the taste of the food. You can opt for buffet as well as ala carte. But speciality items won't be available in buffet.

I wanted to go to this restaurant for quiet a long time and it was worth the wait. I went there with my family to have lunch. The decoration and ambience was fantastic. I actually didn't expect such nicely decorated and such big place. Probably it is the most beautifully decorated restaurant I have ever been in. The food was also the best, very nicely cooked, not over-spiced and had the perfect taste. Heard about the famous nolen gurer ice cream of this place and it was really one of the best ice creams I have ever tasted. It is made of nolen gur, vanilla ice cream and kheer inside the ice cream. The service was also very nice and quick. Now it's in the list of my favourite restaurants in Kolkata.

Mutton is BEST OF THE BEST . Best Bengali cuisine (Lunch Buffet) I ever had. Each and every dishes are perfect in test. BTW expected variety in fish. I am not much enjoyed their ''Gondhoraj Ghol'' . Anyway Mutton with Luchi or Rice is highly recommended and trust me this Buffet is value for money. Location great, nice decors with calm ambience with full of Bengali touch. Staff is very dedicated and cooperative. MUST VISIT AGAIN AND AGAIN.

OLD WORLD CHARM WITH A TADKAA !!! This restaurant has been transformed from an old Bengali home that had the pre independence British architecture...not sure if it's that old...but the owners have done well with plane interiors...some antiques which seem personal possessions of the owners...and comfortable wooden furniture. This is not a planned restaurant, so the tables seems to be hurriedly put through to ensure maximum seating. Car parking is outside on the road and can be an issue on rush days. They have guard outside who sometimes assures you that your vehicle will be looked after...deserves tipping...

I have been here quite a few times for dinner (a la carte) and lunch buffet.

The buffet was value for money for a specialty restaurant and the fish preparations were palatable with a good spread of Bengali deserts.

But, being a restaurant specializing in Bengali cuisine, the food is not up to the mark. It may be cooked with fresh ingredients and exquisite Bengali spices and methods...but it lacks the refined taste. Good for your time off evening with friends but never has it satisfied my foodie senses.
This doesn't mean the chef are not doing a good job, they are doing a great job...but that X factor is still missing...and I hope the owners find it in their own family legacy...we have now numerous Bengali joints...but how do we find the one that our cuisine stands for...
Will continue to visit and look out for that hidden recipe (dish) that this restaurant wants badly...and does it...

I would like to conclude saying that the elegance of this Bengali palatial home itself is an experience which calls for a visit...wish I could go back in time and live in it...when it was at the peak of its glory that is forgotten now and soon will be lost in time.

A wonderful place given both food and decor. very friendly staff too.

I would suggest going to their original location in the "address" - which is their name itself, if you are visiting this place for the first time. Very scrupulously done place. wonderful paintings and art on the walls. I was thinking of something of "4.7/4.7" because the art work could have been a little spaced out. but all in all very nice.

Now coming to the Food which is DEFINITELY a 5. Very sophisticated subtle taste. Each dish is uniquely done. No overpowering spices and oil to make the food tasty (which is typical of average places). Here the food is simply wonderful because of  great quality of ingredients, freshness, subtle cooking and wonderful flavors. Tried their mochar paturi, kankrar gaal petechi (stuffed crab), doi-gondhoraj bhetki, dab chingri...all of which were wonderful.

With the arrival of monsoon, comes the perfect time for hilsas to reach Bengal. It is during this season ( mid June to October) that hilsa is readily available in the market at decent prices, thus attracting the hilsa-loving Bengalis. The restaurants in the city do not miss out this golden opportunity and almost every restaurant serving Bengali cuisines comes up with hilsa special dishes in their menu. I was invited for one such occasion at 6 Ballygunge Place.

If your looking for good Bengali food  summarized in a buffet spread check out 6 ballygunge place.Though I've opted only the buffet but quite confident on their Ala cart offering as well.The journey begun with aam pora sharbot followed by luchi,begunbhaja,cholar daal narkel diye. Then sada bhat,ghee bhat/Polao, Chanar dalna,vetki paturi,dhone murgi,golda chingri malaicurry,kosha mangsho took part into the play.Concluded with sumptuous bhapa doi,indrani,baked mihidana. The Ingredients used  especially the bekti  fish were of premium quality except the mutton that i felt little dry & chewy & probably under cooked. Desserts selection & taste  deserves big applaud.I don't know if the desserts were outsourced but if  they are in house,hats off to the chef.Buffet refilling  was not very prompt but decent & food temperatures were nicely maintained which is often missing in lot of buffet offering.Soothing decor & ambiance signifying traditional Bengali outlook.Buffet pricing is reasonable but Ala cart would be highly rated but surely wont be disappointing Would love to try their Ala cart offering. Bon apetit

The restaurant that stands as the epitome of Bengali cuisine. For bangalis, a restaurant serving bengali food has to be excellent. Because they are under pressure to make their bangali customers happy! Simply because we cook at home most of the items at menu. So, create a mentality where you actually pay for the same food has to be the best that is where this restaurant comes in. The decor is nice. Recently revamped. Food is also good. I have never had a disappointing experience here.

A popular name when it comes to Bengali cuisine, 6 Ballygunge Place has been holding its flagship high, by serving authentic Bengali and Bangladeshi cuisines since quite some time now is extending their warm welcome to celebrate the Hilsa Festival with their delectable spread and array of exciting preparations. Lipsmacking and irresistible as they are ought to be, each of these preparations has been carefully handcrafted to provide the best of flavors, so that the memory and experience may retain in your tastebuds forever!

Upping their ante, most of these specialties have a touch of fusion and modernism imbibed in them. While you have Gobinbhog Ilish on one side, you have Ilish Dopiyaja, Ilish Malaikari and Aam Tel Ilish to go along with it. For starters, one may try Ilish Maacher Tikia, Ilish Porotha (Moghlai Porotha with a 'Ilish' twist in it), and smoked Ilish. A typical and most popular item, which I found here, would be Ilish Maacher Matha diye Kochur Shaak. Ilish Potoler Dolma, Smoked Ilish and Ilish Begun Roll are some of the other must-try items here.

If you want to have something from most of the things in the menu, you can opt for the Special Ilish Thali, which has been priced economically, considering the variety, quality and ofcourse the quantity of every item included in the Thali. Team Panchphoron was cordially invited by the management for a special food tasting session, to sample some of their traditional and fusion Hilsa preparations, which would be on offer for this special occasion. 

The décor here is absolutely amazing. Reflecting a colloquial Bengali household, you get the warmth and feel of ‘Bonadiyana’. I have been to their Salt Lake outlet multiple times, but was my first try at this original outlet of theirs. Nevertheless, after a brief round of chit-chat and sipping a glass of their popular ‘Aam-Panaa’, we started feasting on the very ravishing and delicious looking Hilsa preparations.

Following were the dishes offered:

ILISH MAACHHER TIKIA => Pan grilled Ilish medallions flavoured with Mint & Indian Spices

ILISH POROTHA => Paratha Stuffed with Ilish, egg and Indian spices.

ILISH POTOLER DOLMA => Potol Stuffed with Ilish with thick tomato onion gravy

ILISH MALAIKARI => Ilish cooked in rich coconut and onion gravy

ILISH DOPIYAJA => Ilish cooked in rich curd, tomato & onion gravy

ILISH BEGUN ROLL => Slices of brinjal, grilled stuffed with ilish and fried.

LAU PATA DIYE ROSOONI BHAPA ILISH => Garlic flavour Ilish wrapped in pumpkin leaf. 

GOBINDO BHOG ILISH => Ilish cooked with Gobindobhog Rice. One must try it.

SMOKED ILISH => Boneless Ilish marinated in continental style, baked with a smoky flavour. 

AAM TEL ILISH => Ilish cooked in mango pickle flavoured gravy. 

ILISH MAACHHER MATHA DIYE KOCHUSAAK => Head of Ilish cooked Kachu saag in traditional Bengali way.

ILISH THALI => An assortment of various Ilish preparations, to go with Rice and Luchi.													

The Festival would be held from 5th of July, 2016 to 17th of July, 2016 at the Ballygunge branch and the Salt Lake branch.

Timings: 12:30 - 3:30 PM and 7:00 to 10:30 PM

The abovementioned festival would also be celebrated at 6 Ballygunge Place Thali - Kasba and Salt Lake, Sector V Branch from 5th of July, 2016 to 17th of July, 2016.

Timings: 

6 Ballygunge Place Thali (Salt Lake, Sector V): 12 Noon to 9 PM

6 Ballygunge Place Thali (Kasba): 12 Noon to 10 PM

Each and every preparation was unique and left a long-lasting impression on our tastebuds. Apart from the fact, that the cooking was beyond excellence, the quality of the Hilsa fish played an important role as well. Being fresh and of a large sized fish, the quantity was more than enough, to justify the price tag. Being a Bengali, it is actually more of a sinful pleasure, to enjoy the taste and delicious preparations of Hilsa fishes in this very season of Monsoon. With such a prestigious brand extending their arms by preparation such ravishing dishes, all we need to do, is to take our family and friends, and sit cozily to enjoy a delicious and sumptuous meal. So, do not waste time drooling over the pictures, and make your way the very next moment to one of the branches to enjoy the king of fishes.

If you want authentic Bengali food with chilled out ambience this is the place to be. Each and every item ordered was better than the previous one. Make sure you have a reservation made well in advance, otherwise there is a long wait. Best of all its not priced in comparison to other Bengali food joints

OMG! Awesome ! Yummilicious ! 
Being from north part of country i never imagined bengali food would taste so awesome.. That too vegetarian. 
The decor is done brilliantly well and soothing. 
I took all the recommendations from the server and all were worth it. 
If you are in calcutta and not visiting place then u are at loss. 
The 5 star is missing due to service .. But its the food that matters in the end.

This was the first time I had Bengali cuisine. It was worth it. The starters, main course, mocktails and desserts were lip smacking. We had AJC Bose Road, Gour Mohan street and Biren Roy Road as mocktails among which the first one is their speciality. We had Morola Maccher Peyaji and Gondhiraj Chicken as starters which were delicious. The main course comprised of their specialities ie. Kaju kishmish Pulaao, Mangsho Pulaao, Bhuna Mangsho, Kasha Mangsho and Daab Chingri. All were tasteful so specially the Daab Chingri. For desserts we had Baked Mihidana and Nolen Gur er ice cream. The ice cream was my favourite. It was subtle but had the flavour of Nolen Gur. 6 Ballygunge Place is worth a place to try for, not once but many times. It lives up to one's hopes of having good food and satisfies one's taste buds.

Its always been a pleasure visiting this place time and again and never disappoints. After the overhauling they did, went in there after pretty long time and was literally stunned to see the make over. An wonderful mix of tradition and new era, its been awesome. They have taken over the entire premise and now boast of a banquet and 1st floor is meant for alacarte during week days. However buffet is served on ground floor and first floor during weekends and have a lift for escorting the elders. We went in during weekday and opted for lunch buffet. Priced at ₹485 plus taxes which makes it around ₹650/ person, it will satiate any bengali and had compilations like rice, luchi, aloor dom, dal, kolmi shaag, potol bhaja, sarshe begun, parshe mach, dhaniya chicken,kosha mangsho, chatni-2 types, papad, mishti doi and gulap jamun. Just awesomeness. At the end we ordered their quintessential classic dab chingri for take away and was priced ₹572.50 with taxes. 
Forever recommended.

Visited the place for the first time and the entire time I kept staring at the decor. It was a house which has been renovated into a restaurant. We sat on the ground floor which kinda had 3 rooms for seating and the hall was turned into the buffet area. From the attire of the waiters to plates and the lighting everything had a 'bangali abhijatyo' touch. Now coming to the food - we had the dinner buffet which had aloor dom, begun bhaja as starter and the best part was they kept bringing hot fulko Luchis to our table as per our demand. The chingri Bhuna and the chanar dalna were the show stealers. Aloor Dom was really good too. Mangsher jhol had a ghoroa touch was delicious. In desserts we had sandesh sewai payesh and chhanar malpua. Overall a great experience. We were charged 650 for dinner buffet which seemed reasonable.

This place truly lives up to its fame! From the time you enter, the look and feel of the restaurant, the ambience makes you feel like a true Bangali.. The buffet spread was a great deal.. starting from tomato bharta, begun bhaja, mourala macher pakora going all the way through chicken chaap, mutton kasa, chingri malaikari and ending with chomchom. The aam panna sarbat was the show stopper.. over all I am in love with this place and will go for it again and again!

I went here with my family for my parent's 25th anniversary. We went here today. They had special buffet lunch for d day. 
The decor was " sabeki" with rabindrasangeet instrumental being played. We had already done with seat reservations so didn't hav to wait even it was a bit jammed up today.
In the menu, to start with was luchi, begun bhaja, alurdom and aam pora sorbot. In the main course was rice ( plain and pulao), daal, tomato bharta, mixed shaak, dhokar dalna, mourola macher peyaji. I loved the mourala mach preparation. It was lovely. Alur dom deserves special mention. In the non veg there was pabdar jhaal sorse diye( it was actually scarce in the bowls so when we asked for it they served it separately), chingri, doi murgi, mutton. The chingri and mutton was splendid. To end with there was papad, aamer and khejurer chatni, semaai payesh, chomchom, khirkodom. 
The staffs were polite and good. The service was good too. 
I would definitely love to visit again.
Only thing is, i was not aware that on public holidays their charges vary. So , it was a bit of awkwardness for me when i got to see the bill amount. Otherwise it is one of the best bengali cuisine restaurant i have visited so far.

Tried buffet lunch yesterday with family. While the food was so so the service was pathetic. I was surprised with the rudeness of the lady associate who was serving, she did not have any touch of hospitality in her. There was an instance wherein we asked for bowls which was outright denies stating that there is a ilish festival going on thus the same won't be possible.  I wrote this in there feedback form , noticed one of the servers reading the same however no one bothered to come and speak to us. Surprised and disappointed with the service honestly.

Visited this place a few weeks ago. So a bit late for the review. 

Firstly, i would like to thank the management and staff for their service and extremely polite behaviour. Coming to the food, if you are Bengali and you haven't visited this place...you're doing it wrong.  The Food is absolutely sensational and i promise you, you'll keep coming back for more. Ordered a variety of dishes and all of them were very good. Need to try a few more varieties of Hilsa dishes here. Might pop in again this Sunday. Overall, lovely experience earlier and looking forward to more in future. Thumbs up from me!

We had an official dinner today organised by 6 BP / Savourites and the foods was absolutely terrible. Te order was for 200 heads and we had gone ahead with the rates given by them... i.e. we did not make any negotiations on the rates. However, the key issues were...
- Overall food was terrible e.g. chholar daal was too sweet without any taste
- Mutton only had fat or bones and nothing else

As a regular visitor of 6 BP and frequent user of Savourites / 6 BP from an official angle, I think the services were below basic standards. Also, nothing was done when it was mentioned to the manager.

We should not be using them any more as we feel they are just complacent.

I have been trying to go to this place for a long time after hearing rave reviews about this place . Finally when I got the chance to visit this place , I must say that this place lived up to its reputation. Right from ushering in, decor, this place had all the right vibes. We (me and my wife) were famished and ordered Afghani chicken cutlet and 38 AJC bose road as starters as suggested by the waiter . Though it took a little to come but the wait was worth it. The cutlets were succulent and the crust was just perfect. The mocktail was one of the most refreshing drinks I drank for a long time.
For the main course we ordered plain rice, muger dal, aloo bhaja, gondhoraj bhapa bhetki, Ilish paturi. All the items were exellent but the bhetki , to me, was top of the lot.
I have been to almost all the top Bengali restaurants in Kolkata and I must say this place is right among the top.
Only suggestion- please try to reduce the waiting time for meal serving.

Went to 6 Ballygunge Place after a long time yesterday for dinner, and in fact the first time after their renovation. Firstly i have to say the décor is really good, it's calm and soothing and the ambience is good too. The staff is very friendly also. The food was great as usual.
We ordered posto narkel bora,begun bhaja,luchi,steamed rice,bhaja masalar aloor dum,pur bhora doi potol,chitol machcher muitha,murgir tramfrado and bhapa doi and baked mihidana with rabdi for dessert. Tried the tramfrado for the first time and loved it. Would definitely go back and will try the continental dishes this time.

The perfect destination for Bengali cuisine served in a delightfully done up 100 year old Bengali home filled with old world charm. The name comes from the actual address of the restaurant and is the pride of the para. In fact every time someone is visiting Kolkata and wants to have Bengali food, I always flaunt 6 Ballygunge place as our showcase restaurant for authentic Bengali khabar. The best way to sample the wide variety of the cuisine would be to go for their extremely popular mouth-watering hearty weekend buffet. The sumptuous afternoon buffet starts with fulko luchhiss served with begun basanti and alur dom on the table along with the aam pora shorbot. And then then its begins, the numerous trips between the buffet area and your table. The weekend buffet would have special items like fish kabiraji cutlet, pabda jhal, Kasha Mangsho, doi murgi besides the regular dal, shaakh bhaja and shukto or tomato bharta. In case you are vegetarian they will offer veg items like dhokar dalna and mocha in lieu of the non- veg main course. The aamer chutney , khejurer chutney and papad will give you company through the meal. You will end you meal with mishit doi, pantua or sandesh and of course nolen gurer ice-cream with drops of the syrupy gur that will have you craving for more. And some more. Gur is winters gift to summer and the restaurant stores it post winter to serve this ice-cream in the hot summer months. Chew on the bits of pan served with the cheque and bless the team for this wonderful gastronomic experience!

From the al carte: The chitol muitha is a must have.

I was just overwhelmed by the food and the place! The lunch buffet got me flooded with various Bengali dishes...traditional, light and utterly delicious. From shaak with bori vaja to pabdar jhaal to dhokar dalna to doi mangsho and lastly the mishti doi with various other things, it was a wholesome meal.  It was more than 'jamai aador' since now and then a mango chutney or aam pora shorbot was provided in addition to the buffet! 
The service is really good and the interiors and also the house itself exuberates a strong smell of Bangaliana!
Strongly recommended to visit.

Though I am not a Bengali I absolutely love Kolkata ( I was born here) and I adore Bengali Food. Regretfully its not cooked at home very often so I usually like to head to 6 Ballygunge Place my cravings attack. I recently visited with my family and had a superb dinner there. This place has had a makeover fairly recently and is nice and brightly done up. Loved all the colorful traditional fans and loved the specially designed plates laid out on each table. I felt the table could have been a bit larger to accommodate all the food we wanted to order (LOL) but otherwise it was a very pleasing ambiance.

I liked this place till two weeks ago but things seems to have changed.
I was going there for last several years, ever since it opened its 1st unit. Food quality is indeed admirable. Waiters are very courteous. However, floor management is pathetic. Food quality is drawing people but on Sundays it's chaotic and disgusting. There is no visible counter for getting the names entered. There is no one at the entrance to guide as to where to enter the name , where to wait and when to go to the table. On 29th May, Sunday, I went there with a guest and went upstairs. The floor manager who was in a suit told us to occupy a table. While I was in the restroom, he came to my guest and very rudely told her to vacate and asked as how she came to the 1st floor without permission.
When I came back from the restroom, I found her standing in a corner with a face full of insult and disgust.
He could have properly guided but instead talked rudely much like low category place. 
The body language and attitude of the floor manager reflected a similarity with government babus.
Needless to say, my outstation guest, who had heard a lot about the place was shocked beyond imagination and that triggered posts in a number of whatsapp groups.
I took her to another bengali restaurant in a mall where we were received very elegantly. Though we had to wait there as well but there were proper arrangements.
I feel bad because I liked 6 Ballygunge Place very much for its food, innovation and efficient Waiters. The way they started in an old house is a success story to admire.
Sadly, unless they take efficient floor managers and replace those who lack courtesy of the level of a fine dining restaurant, they would struggle to sustain growth and brand.
Sad truth

Bengali food is my weakness and for me, a Bengali buffet is the best way to celebrate special occasions. We went on a week day so there was no Chingri Malai curry or Kosha Mangsho or Paturi. These items are usually available on weekends and I wasnt really aware of that. Nevertheless, I loved the Shaagbhaja and Uchhe Diye Aloo sheddo. I like homely B engali food, which is a luxury for me, coming from a non bengali vegetarian family. The chicken on the menu tasted very homemade which is good when you are eating an all you can eat buffet. My partner really loved the mutton. There was a fish preparation as well but I did not like it as much. It was Rui machh in a green gravy, probably spinach. I was more interested to savor some shorshe bata preparation which was not on the menu that day. I am eager to visit on  a weekend to savor the Paturis and Malai Curries. They highly recommend you call beforehand to enquire about the day's menu. For dessert, I had a huge serving of mishti doi and by the end of the meal, I was very full and satisfied with the dining experience as well as the service. 
I appreciate the old ancestral home feel in the decor.

The food is good. The buffet will give you a sumptuous guide to the essential bengali cuisine. but the spread is more than the food.they've taken over an entire 'old' kolkata house and tastefully some up the interiors. you must take a type of all the rooms for the fantastic decor. The service is homely and warm. if visiting kolkata for a day this is a place you may want to spend some time here.

Ambience-check, hospitality-check, with food it's between two options it's either great or great ;) daab chingri has to be the one to look forward to. If u go and don't have it, then don't return... Buffet's great as well. This place is just a go go..... Go out their on a lazy Sunday afternoon and be blown by those lip smacking Bengali cuisines.... Peace :)

this is a great place to eat. such good bengali food! i am not such a big fan of bengali food and i hated that i was being dragged there. i hated it even more when i saw the menu, very homey menu i was. but the food was beyond-belief good! a simple fried eggplant, kachuri, the typical kasha mangsha that we have at home are made so differently! they had made a prawn kabiraji, which was in a special buffet menu, it was so extraordinary that two-three were not enough!

The rating is more for the experience than the food.thats not to say that their food isn't great but the décor and the tiny little house it's nestled in makes you feel you are in a distant relatives house for lunch. It's best to go here with small groups so that seating isn't a problem. Love the posto Bora , kakrar jhal, machher matha diye dal and the bhaja bhujis. They are really good at catering for biye bari and infact have been catering for every biye bari I have been in south Kolkata. They are owned by the owners of my favourite restaurant in Kolkata ...Wall so that's that.

Though this outlet has been established long back, this is my first visit here. It is an ancestral house beautifully decked up and converted into an eatery. They have two seating zone with one being on the 1st floor. The ambiance is quite plush with wall arts and some typical bengali household artefacts. The seating is a concern though.

Sumptuous buffet with Parsher Jhal, Murgir Jhol and Mutton Kosha in the non-veg spread. Besides Dal, Bhaat, kochuri, alu dom also on offer. Begun Basanti, begun bhaja were specially good. Rounded off with two types of chutney and good old mishti doi and sandesh. With excellent service and very reasonable pricing.

I LOVE THIS PLACE. 
The lovely wall art in the waiting room, the Bengali feel of the place and the absolutely at home feel of the place and the brilliant service all add to its charm. The posters of landmark Bengali movies, paintings and what not on the wall makes the place look lovely. 
AND THE FOOD <3 
Food is just great. The mishtis are love.

6 Ballygunge Place,Ballygunge -- explore a new dining experience.

     As a member of KolkataFood Bloggers, we were invited at an official inauguration of the newly renovated 6 Ballygunge place, Ballygunge . The first word one would say “WOW” as this newly renovated place is shining like a gem with rich Bengali past, offering a pacifying and aesthetically soothing ambiance .The restaurants recently got a complete makeover and yes an added floor too. One can find this brilliant ambiance with a various range of uniquely designed interior-exterior which reflects a rich tradition ethnic Bengali touch everywhere.

     After being completely take-over by ‘Abin Design Studio’ one of the leading architectural firms in Kolkata in collaboration with Square Consultancy Services for renovation for more than three months, this well-known Bengali restaurant reopened once again with a bang with a complete new makeover and bong feel. Now the restaurant become bigger as the entire building becomes opened for various purpose as a single unit.

 The ground floor serves the buffet at lunch and dinner time and the 1st floor take cares by serving guests as a regular A-la-carte. The total seating capacity now becomes more than 150. The 2nd floor totally converted into a banquet space along with the nice rooftop catering about 200 guests at a time. So the restaurant becomes a full grown food hub along with a luxurious party hall.
The architects decided to play around this beautiful residential structure from nineteenth century with some natural feelings of Bengali and are actually inspired by the paintings of ‘Lalu Prasad Shaw’, the brilliant colour compositions of his works were transliterated architecturally in the form of hand painted walls, furniture and lighting design. The idea was to render a theme in spatial and temporal domains rather than using as mere wall embellishments. 

    The exterior design is inspired by the ‘Sahaj Path’ of Bengali language with exterior painted in pristine white provides the perfect canvas for painted motifs from ‘Sahaj Path’ that wraps around the ground floor .   The Bengal ‘Potochitro’ and the Babu culture depicts in the huge wall at the first floor framed by a series of arches presents a traditional wall painting and rendered over chair backs, Menu card and crockeries. 
Central hall is designed with Sahaj path motifs and provides a symbolic representation of balcony on one side.  The smaller rooms house Sara paintings on the walls. These are augmented by wooden louvered fenestration that allow filtered sunlight to create interplay of light and shade that enlivens the interior. Accent lights were customised that combined illumination and decoration. While the central buffet holds a chandelier made with traditional Bengali kitchen equipments , the cage chandeliers exploits traditional Bengali fascinations with pet birds. Mamoni Chitrakar from Pingla, West Midnapore, has come up with these cat-and-fish imageries on Kalighat saras (Bengali styled convex earthen pitchers) that adorn the bright yellow walls. Gramophone at the corner makes the ambiance more attractive.
Must mention Sarbari Dutt one of the renowned dress designer has designed beautiful crockeries.Each and every artworks from top to bottom were well described by PR Sneha Dutta who mentioned Ramchandra Dey and Debatosh Kar done most of the paintings and sculpture works.

    There is so much to mention regarding decorations! One can find the actual art works by visit the place once and can actually experience the past in the present.

    If you see the Menu card there is also a touch of Bengali literature specially poem like description which is really -really innovative and Bengalis will find this menu quite innovative and it keeps you bit busy till food serves. This menu card also has a simple English version for non-Bengalis and foreigners. This menu card is designed by “Inner Circle Ad Agency”. 
    Now coming back to platter, the Bengali menu is same as before with some additional items like ‘Laoer Doga Diye Ilish’ means Hilsa with bottle guard stems,Dab Vapa Puli,Vaja Pithe and Bhuna Chingi from Bangladeshi cuisine . 
They have also mentioned that due to huge demand of continental dishes across all age groups they once again re-launched continental dishes. 6 Ballygunge place proudly operates catering services ‘Savourites Hospitality’ in no of IT firms and also in some well-known clubs like Calcutta Club and Tolly Clubs.

  Among continental ‘Grilled Fish on the bed of veggies and mashed potato’, Bread  & Butter Roasted Lambs are launched and also we got the taste the same.       find 6 Ballygunge Place in Salt Lake other than Ballygunge itself along with restaurants in Bangalore and Guwahati

A plan to enjoy some delicious Sunday lunch with family and what better than our very own Bengali cuisine to treat our gastronomical urges. Though this outlet has been established long back, this is my first visit here. It is an ancestral house beautifully decked up and converted into an eatery. They have two seating zone with one being on the 1st floor. The ambiance is quite plush with wall arts and some typical bengali household artefacts. The seating is a concern though. The chairs could have been a bit more comfortable. The tables are very disappointing. Absolutely tiny and not at all robust. Kind of shakes with even a minor push. 

Coming to food, we were quite impressed with the buffet spread and also the price. The Shukto was very delicious. Out of the veg items, the Aloo Tomato Sabzi or rather known as Aloo Chokha was the best. Even the Aloo Dum tasted good and i would particularly like to mention that it was not heavy on spices. They had Mangsher Chop (Bengali styled Meat balls) for appetiser and i would rather describe it as satisfactory. I loved the crispness of the item but felt the filling is something they could improve in terms of taste. The best item for the day was Sorshe Pabda ( Pabda fish cooked in mustard gravy). It was an absolute delight to be honest. The gravy was made to perfection. The fine long grained basmati rice with the gravy was a killer combo. Though i avoided the chicken but my parents praised the Methi preparation. The Mutton was disappointing. I was all geared up for the famous Luchi Mangsho combo but avoided it because of the Mutton. For the desserts they had Mishti Doi,  Strawberry Sandesh and Gulab Jamun. The Strawberry sandesh was very nice but the Gulab Jamun was too sweet for my liking. We ordered for their specialty Nolen Gurer Ice Cream outside the Buffet and it was very good as expected. 

I would appreciate the service as it was too crowded and inspite of that the servers were prompt and attentive.

This was my second visit to this place, and I was not satisfied this time. Today we opted for buffet lunch but the item's being served there was not up to the mark leaving chicken cutlet and mutton. We also tried dab chingri from a-la-carte items and found this once-lip-smacking dish has lost it's taste and the prawn pieces was not at all melting inside mouth as they promise. I'd definitely give a second thought before going to this place next time.

Went there for the first time and have already fallen in love with the place. The Bengali feel in terms of both food and ambience is praiseworthy. The waiters were very friendly. We ordered aam porar sharbet, 54 AJC Bose Road, Bhetki fry, Kaju kishmish pulao, Masala Aloor dam, Daab chingri, Bhetki paturi, Bhuna mutton and Chhanar malpo with ice cream. I recommend the bhetki fry. The fish just melts in your mouth. The mutton was perfectly cooked. Daab chingri and paturi were also delicious. The aloor dam was not at its best however. Chhanar malpo also one must try. If you are a foodie and love Bengali cuisine this is the right place for you. You'll love it!

Even 15 years back, our city, Kolkata didn't had an eatery which specialized in only Bengali food in the city of Bongs or food-loving Bengalis. In 1998, Savourites, the mother company, owned by three friends Anindya Palit, S. Ramani and Chef Sushanta Sengupta, each master of his own domain, started up a restaurant named 6, Ballugunge Place, totally dedicated to pure Bengali Cuisine, at a 100 years old two-storied bunglow of a former Rai Bahadur, at south of city, ballygunge. Keeping the old world charm of the house with minimum decor and with capacity of only 84 seats, just with the Bengali food served keeping its authenticity alive, this place soon became a popular destination of people from all walks of lives. Nobody has ever complained about the place as the food they served was finger-licking delicious all the time and they have always satisfied everyone who came to dine that place. But recently, the management team has decided to renovate that place and give it a complete new look keeping the architecture of the old house intact as it is. And after opening after 3-4 months, they invited My foodie Group, Kolkata Food Bloggers, to visit the newly designed 6, Ballygunge Place and I represented my group along with two other Kolkata Food bloggers. 
The change for betterment :: 
you can get a good view how they have renovated the whole house from the pictures attached in the review. Other betterments in some points for you all...............
(A) The house which was two storied at first, two more new floors are added and are used for banquet purpose. Now catering, banquet and restaurant all these you can get under one roof. The restaurant has a total of 4 floors, ground and first floor are used for restaurant purpose whereas top floor and rooftop are used for banquet purpose which is also very popular in the city. 
(B) A lift is also added for visitors specially for elderly persons so that they can enjoy their food at any floor they want conveniently.
(C) Restaurant has got a new Reception-cum-waiting area at the ground floor, off course. 
(D) The restaurant which had 82 seats before, now has capacity to accommodate 150 persons. 
(E) Before, only lunch buffet were served, now it is served on lunch and dinner.

On The Platter :: 
   The Bengali specialities on the menu are the same as before. Only few experimental Bengali dishes and a few Continental dishes have been added. Continental section which was a part of menu at the beginning, was cut off few years back. But on the request from guests, they have added a few continental dishes on the menu card again. Chef-in-charge Sujoy Halder, who has no culinary degree on his shoulder but has more than 15 years of restaurant experience on his sleeve and he proved that to be a good cook, one need experience more than a degree, here in 6 Ballygunge Place where he is serving near about 10 years now and satisfied the food-loving Bengali people with his service. Here are the new dishes he created and we sampled. And no doubt each and every dish was finger-licking delicious.
In Kolkata, you'll find 6 Ballygunge Place in Salt Lake other than Ballygunge and outside Kolkata, they are running their outlet in Bangalore and Guwahati, too. 

Pocket Pinch for 2 : Rs. 800-1200 apprx. 

So don't forget to visit this place if you're living in Kolkata or visiting Kolkata by any chance. A double thumbs up for 6, Ballygunge Place

This was my second visit today. Went for a lunch with my parents. Ordered buffet lunch with daab chingri and chitol macher miuttha. It was a special buffet with 5 non veg items that included bagda chingri, doi chicken, pabda, lotte pakora and mangsher jhol. Daab chingri was different, i liked it. Chitol was not up to the mark. Overall experience was good.

A paradise for the lovers of authentic bengali cuisine this place is the classiest among them all. Took my mother for a lunch on one fine day. We had FISH KOBIRAJI (4/5).PLAIN RICE, ILISH BHAPA(3.5/5) the taste of ilish was a bit dull though ,DAB CHINGRI(4.5/5), BHAPA BHETKI (GONDHORAJ)(4.5/5), CHITOL MACHER MUITHA(4/5). In dessets we had MALPUA(3/5) which was too sweet and MIHIDANA WITH RABDI(4/5). Overall it has been an overwelming experience.

This is a wonderful bengali cuisine. The variety of recipes and fishes are really good.  Little costly but it pays off if you are non vegetarian.  Please veg people don't visit this place.  You will hardly have anything to have.  The quality of fish is really good. The deserts are wonderful specially baked mihidana.

It's an old house converted into a restaurant..! The interior is creatively done... Nothing over the top .. Coming to the food, i was really satisfied with quality.. we opted for buffet.. And i could not help eating extra.. The daal, the chicken ,mutton, aaloo everything was just so perfect... Mishti doi gets an extra point 😊
Quality- 5/5

Went for the weekday Lunch buffet last week with my husband and the place is looking good after a recent renovation. Started the buffet with Kachori and aloo dum. The kachoris were hot and fluffy and very good. Then had the rice with bhetki fish in a light mustard gravy. The fish was fresh and the gravy was just right, not too overpowering. We also tasted the chicken gravy and the mutton rogan josh. The chicken was again good, brought back memories of good home cooked chicken gravy. The mutton  pieces though were the fatty kind and had to really search for a piece but there was mostly bones and fatty pieces. There were also accompaniments like the begun bhaja, saag bhaja, yellow dal. Was disappointed there was no aloo bhaja or aloo bharta ( instead there was pepe bharta) and dessert had Misti Doi and 1 Indian sweet. on the whole, it was a good buffet for a reasonable price of Rs 485 + tax

Situated in a century-old bungalow,,, 6 Ballygunge Place is yet another great choice in Kolkata for traditional,,, authentic Bengali food.... Among other features,,, enchanting pictures of old Kolkata,,, 6 Ballygunge Place offers a lovely setting as a backdrop to a truly delectable Bengali meal.... The menu holds something for every palate,,,, nd caters equally well to both vegetarian nd meat lovers... Popular choices include the kasha mangsho (a delicious, spicy curry of mutton) nd daab chingri (a dish of prawns marinaded in mustard and typically cooked inside of a hollowed-out coconut)....

I am in Kolkata to taste my bud with some exiting dishes from some reputed restaurants. Started with 6 ballygunge place with Bengali cuisines. On a busy Tuesday I dropped in here for lunch. Decided to go buffet along with daab chingri, although the buffet menu today was not looking so great. But believe me sometimes yours eye can be wrong. All dishes were really good specially the mutton daak bangla. But the best was the daab chingri which I ordered separately after seeing about it in zamato.

“Though the border between India-Bangladesh divides Bangla historically and geographically, for me both the countries are same as we continue sharing a very strong bond through our language, films and food. I have never seen them as two different countries and that’s what we have tried to show in our film Sankhachil. I am happy that 6 Ballygunge Place is hosting Paatpere Padma-parey and I’m certain everyone will enjoy the feast,” said Prosenjit while discussing the opar banglar food celebration planned by the epar bangla’s famous 6 Ballygunge Place.

Went last Sunday with family ,the ambience and decor was great. Coming to the food the mutton kosha was salty and the chanar dalna was very tasty but not much chana in the besan balls. The two pullaos meat and kaku kismish was awesome! Fish fry was good too. Overall I think it could have been better considering it is quite expensive.

Last to last year we visited this restaurant during the pujas and had a buffet lunch over there. Ambience is excellent , Presentation is good Food is great and their Service is also good. They served us a total bengali buffet starting from shukto, begun bhaja.,chingri malai curry, sorshe illish, kosha mangsho, pulao and a sweet dish. shukto and begun bhaja was nice sorshe illish and chingri malai curry was very delicious and tasty. The kosha mangsho was also good and quite yummy though. Everything was nicely arranged and well decorated. The cost of the buffet was also not that high. It was Rs 800 per person at that time. Therefore a very systematic restaurant and one of the best restaurant serving Bengali cuisines:)

This place has definitely lived up to its name and has given us the perfect Bengali feel. Located at a very convenient spot from Ballygunge Phari, the place has been done just so beautifully that one will take a liking to it at a go! Its generally very crowded, especially on Sundays.
Firstly for starters, we ordered 3 Aampora Shorbot, one Gondhoraj Chicken and one Aam kasuni Chicken.
All of them were heavenly!
Now coming to the main course, we ordered for one shukto, chanar dalna, mochar ghonto, bhetki paturi, and kosha mangsho.
It was basically heaven on our plates and finally for the dessert, nolen gurer ice cream and baked pantua, which is basically gulab jamun wrapped with baked cottage cheese!
All of it is totally worth the price, and a must visit place for all the Bengali food lovers.

Ultimate Bengal cuisine. The buffet is more than enough to satisfy bengali food fantasy. The luchi , alu chokha , daal, shukto , assorted bhajas to dhonepata-kachalonka chicken, suttle mutton jhol, chingri n rui machher kalia . Dessert will be welcoming with chutney, papad, malpua and doi. Not to miss aamporar shorbot . The cherry on cake - bhetki paturi . Next agenda @6 ballygunge place would be to the steamed fish - consisting of as they mentioned bhekti fillet steamed with veges and bread.
On the second visit this place disappointed us. Service was not upto the mark more than one person attending our table created confusion. The food was good no doubt. Nice chicken fries..curries..shukto was too good..but we found small hair strands in the mutton curry..some one on the other table complained of hair in alu dum. In the end even the toothpick tub had hair in it. Eating place with so much hair is nt a good idea.

All you north Indians there...
I highly doubt that people from North would like this typical bengali cuisine.the only plus point is their ambience and courteous staff.their food is famous among the bongs but I personally didn't like.the biggest drawback was they were missing starters in their buffet.apart from their buffet we ordered their signature mocktails.that was too disappointing.overall good for the bong family 👪 to hang in.

Location: Opposite to kasturi and fish fish in swinhoe lane

Ambience and Decor: the decor is the best I have seen, given the theme of 'Flavours of Bengal' it is the most bong type decor with beautiful color combo of silver and yellow and drawing on the walls with bird cage like chandeliers for each table to go with the silver accentuated tables and chairs which are pretty comfortbale
The ambience is nowhere less and gives a nice simple and classy feeling

Food and Menu: on the menu we have bengali and continental
The food is the finest and the best one can have in dis particular cusisine, from quality to quantity to presentation to taste, they get 100 out of 10 stars for their food.
Special mention for the Grilled fish, morog polao and the ilish bhapa.

Service and Staff: prompt and well mannered staff and quick delivery or service timing

Overall Verdict: if u think bengali food, think 6 Ballygunje place, you can't get anything better.

When the heat is enough to give you blisters, I ventured out on such an afternoon to have some Bengali food. My love for Bengali food has carefully developed under the aegis of my Garndmom and father. Being a "Bangal", I understand fish better than my Bengali contemporaries. I had the buffet and at the outset thought that it was moderately priced. Although they did not have much to offer, but considering the price the buffet was a delight. Grainy Musirir Dal, Rice, Begun Bhaja and Luchi to start with. I loved the shukto because it was not unnecessarily flavoured and tasted bitter. The Mourala Piyaji Fry and Parshe Maaach was also delectable and fresh. Although I thought the chicken was a bit oily, the mutton sealed the deal. It was a light seemingly home cooked gravy which was absolutely wonderful.

We went there on the occasion of poila boisakh...nobo borsho...they had a special buffet menu exclusively laid out for this day...
Firstly the ambience impressed me a lot...small cozy well decorated rooms brilliantly lit and connected by an arrangement of buffet dishes..
They served the very traditional aampora shorbot which was served in mud cups and had a unique taste..
The buffet dishes comprised of plain rice,luchi,alur dom,polao,chingri malai curry,bhetki paturi,crab cutlet,chicken,mutton,paneer,potol bhaja and some other vegetarian dishes...Among all of these,the crab cutlet,paturi and polao deserves a special mention and was excellent to taste...
The best part comprised of the desserts...baked rabri with mihidana was too mouthwatering;besides their misti doi,chatni n papor,malpoa were equally good...
although i hav not been to this place on a nrmal day i would lov to visit this place sometime soon

One of my favourite restaurants for Bengali food.. This place is very well decked up. Traditionally bong! The menu is quite elaborate and the food as usual is very good.

Quite underwhelming, which was not my impression when I dined there a couple of years ago.  We had the buffet in which nearly everything - rice, jira rice, dal, papad, loochi, begun bhaja, doi potol, kumro chingri, laal murgi and mutton curry as well as desserts - were mediocre at best. It seemed to me that in trying to become inoffensive, they have become bland and forgettable.

Ballygunge is one place in Kolkata which houses so many restaurants at stone's throw from each other that you are always split for choices. And if the restaurants are well-known for a particular kind of cuisine, and almost all are neck-to-neck competitors of each other, the decision becomes tougher. Add to that, the particular cuisine is Bengali, and almost all the restaurants are putting up their best front for the occasion of Poila Baisakh. Tough call, right?

I was facing the same dilemma today as I finally decided to step into this beautiful place called 6 Ballygunge Place. Well, I think it won't harm if the authorities put an extra 'a' in the name of this 'place'. The moment you step inside, you are transported to a different era. With chandeliers and hand-fans adorning the place, no matter how small the place be, and with classic Rabindrasangeet enhancing the ambience, you will fall in love with the place the moment you step in. Hardly have I found any restaurant taking so much care to set up the mood.

Step in, and you find small cubicles housing 3-4 tables with dreamy yellow lights and high-backed chairs and sofas awaiting your arrival. Once you're settled, you'll be asked to choose between the Buffet or A La Carte. And trust me, it's a tough call. I had read plenty of Zomato reviews and ticked all the dishes that I need to try out here. But limited money and a variety of options can take a toll on you at times. So, finally, I settled for the Buffet. 

The waiters are extremely polite and helpful, and guide you through the mocktails. For Mocktails, we ordered:
1. 3, Gour Mohan Chatterjee Street: As written in the menu, it's a tall cool lime drink, spiked with ginger and grenadine syrup. And it really is refreshing, and also a treat with the eye with all the red and yellow.

2. 31, Beckbagan Row: This one is made of guava, rock salt and Tabasco. It has a little fizz to it, and the taste is not that of a typical mocktail. 

However, the thing that struck me most was the names of the mocktails. As is evident, they have been named after the houses of famous personalities of Bengal, and I must say, a really innovative one.

Coming to the Buffet, there were a multitude of choices, as is expected of a Buffet. So, I will just go through the menu, as I had it.

1. Luchi and Aloor Dum: What can possibly go wrong with this combination? Though I found the Aloor Dom a bit salty, the combination itself can make me go weak in the knees.

2. Sada Bhaat
3. Moong Dal
4. Kumroni
Again, a combination that will remind you of your grandmother's cooked food. A Bengali can never resist the temptation of Begun Bhaja and Kumro Bhaja. And 6 Ballygunge Place chooses to tease us by giving this combination.

5. Nim Begun Bhaja: Another favourite of Bengalis who are fond of the bitter taste. 

6. Saag Bhaja

7. Dhokar Dholna: For me, it was one of the best dishes of the afternoon. The Dhoka was soft, the juices had penetrated deep down within the Dhoka, and with the Moong Dal, it made for the perfect combination. No wonder I finished most of my bhaat with this only.

8. Bhetki Machher Jhal: Another good dish, with the soft Bhetkis and Shorshe combo strengthening the taste.
However, I would have been happier to find a Bhetki Paturi here.

9. Murgir Jhol
10. Mutton Dakbungalow
These again remind me of the sumptuous Sunday lunch that all the family eagerly looked forward to. Starting from buying the mutton/chicken from the bazaar, and peeping into the kitchen every now and then to check out the progress, and coming back with a lung full of the aroma, and finally licking your fingers for the fascinating mutton/chicken curry that your Grandma cooked- I guess it had been the scenario in most middle-class Bengali households a decade back. And these dishes will just remind you of those days.

11. Chutney and Papad: I can possibly never criticise this, because I have hardly seen anyone going wrong with this. And am just a die-hard fan that even if it goes wrong, I will still be having it to mark the perfect finish to the main course.

12. Desserts: For desserts they had Pantua and Mishti Doi. Now, this was one section that I felt hadn't lived upto the rest. Not that the preparations were bad, but well, they were ordinary and didn't exude much memories or awe.

13. In addition to the Buffet, we also ordered a Dab Chingri to compensate for the absence of Prawns in the Buffet Menu. And boy, what a grand dish it was! I haven't been to Bengali restaurants for sometime now, and the only dish I really missed was this Dab Chingri. And 6 Ballygunge Place made up for that absence. There's a saying by Bankim Chandra in his novel:
'Jaha dekhilam, jonmo jonmantoreo bhulibo na' which roughly translates as, I will never forget what I saw, in this life, or the next. Well, I just want to replace thay 'saw' by 'ate'!
The Dab Chingri was perfect in every sense-both the execution(it came in a dab) and the taste(the smooth flowing curry, and the soft bhapa prawns done to perfection).

Overall, for the Buffet, I feel adding some more fish items would be good, since the place is mostly famous for that. I had avoided having Bengali food at a restaurant for a long time, and 6 Ballygunge Place just reminded me how big a mistake that is. I will surely be going back to the place to try the A La Carte, and perhaps for the nostalgia and warmth that the place exudes.

Ambiance of this restaurant is highly attractive and you will feel at home. Staff is so courteous, caring, polite and friendly. Since I was alone, opted for the buffet dinner. There was luchi, steamed rice, kaju-kismis pulao, mug daal, raw posto bata, kumroni, dhokar dolna, aalu dom, a mix veg with prawn(can't recall the name), chicken curry, chicken dakbunglow with two type of chutney and papad. Mishti doi and pantua was offered for dessert. Quality and taste of food items was good, but it seemed to be a little bit overpriced. They can consider adding two three more items in buffet menu, to make it more vivid and attractive. Overall experience was very good!

Just what a Bengali needs to satisfy the craving for mouth watering delicious Bengali cuisines! The name itself suggests the exact location of this place. 
The best thing about this restaurant is the food feels like it has been cooked in your mom's kitchen. You will get absolutely typical Bengali dishes here, only made even more sumptuous with their secret ingredients. The buffet option is also available along with all-carté at very reasonable rates. The buffet menu will have almost everything you can want for on your plate. 
And what takes your experience to another level is the brilliant service offered. You will definitely feel at home. 
Can't wait to drop there soon and gorge on my favourite dishes!! 🍛🍲🍗

Well, visited the restaurant for the Nobo Borsho special buffet. Undoubtedly the spread was impressive but i expected a little more fish items which 6,Ballyganj Place is famous for and the mutton could have been little soft. Anyway, the dessert was yummy and the service and ambiance was quite good. I would love to visit this place again but only to try some more dishes which were not included in the buffet.

Went to feast on the Bangladeshi food festival, first of its only ala carte for the festival, the buffet have the usual menu. So if you are planning to visit the festival plan accordingly.
We ordered Mourola Macher Peyazi, Padma Nadir Ilish, Aar Macher Bhuna, Kachki Mach and steam rice. The food was great as usual.

Well what I can I say. It was only a dream to visit this place. I seriously don't earn that much (even after promotion) to go to this posh Restaurant...!!!
But I have done it. Today aka 10-04-2016, Sunday I took my most lovable persons to this place, 6 Ballygunge place.
Coming to the best part 1st and bad one's later, the best of the best was obviously THE AMBIENCE!! It's perhaps the best I've ever visited. It doesn't look like a restaurant at all. It's more like a 'Bonedi Barite Khete Esechi' kono occasion e. Fatafati. Ek Kothay Oshadharon.!!
Price - It's very costly and for rich people.
Food - Posh jaygay Bengali khabar khete Chan, this is the place. However the taste was a 'Theek-Thaak' to me. No comparison can be done what my mom's cooking. As my mom's cooked khana is the best.
We ordered some creative thrust busters (lebu jol with soda types) which was besh unique and cool. Ah one more thing the menu card is really unique and creative.!!!
In the main course we ordered rice (as expected) daal (Theek-Thaak) Sukto (not at all up to the mark) I had one of the most best Sukto in a Sraddho bari way back!!
Potol er item was chole jabe types, Jhinge aloo posto was motamuti.
The bhapa ilish was very very good. The best one of the lot.
I'd recommend to order nonveg here rather then veg.
The services were excellent.

However I've been to Bhojohori manna and Koshe Kosha too, but the best Bengali food I liked was in Bedouin Sher e Bengal. Not only me but my best friend agreed to this as well.

* Postscript - Till date this is the highest paid bill by me till date and it's a lot. A bit of Food was wasted. Even amar moto chele er gaa e legeche. I found the joy of giving today. I have also fulfilled someone's dream to be there. Yes it was 41° almost today but that didn't stopped us. Thank you to God and my parents to make this day/this dream come true.
A rating of 4 majorly because of the Ambience.

The rest of the day was awesomely spent Courtesy Mani Squre, The Jungle Book, 3D, Movies after 22 years!!! Yes. I have indeed done it. A promotion treat which neither one of us will ever forget.

This is the place to have authentic Bengali food. I had my doubts on how vegetarian food would taste in a Bengali restaurant, but i was proved wrong. 
It is an independent bungalow converted to a restaurant. The ambiance was very tastefully done with a mix of modern and old. Once again like any other restaurant in Kolkata, there is a long waiting time.

We ordered Paratha, Karaishutir kachori and Radhaballavi for breads. Sides were Bhaja masala aloo dum and enchorer dalna along with kaju kismis pulao.
All the breads were unique and went exceptionally well with the sides. Aloo dum, though nothing much different, was cooked to perfection. Enchorer dalna is a seasonal dish made with jackfruit and was unlike anything i ve had before. Pulao was rich and had loads of kishmis and kaju.

Service was good, prices are definitely low given the location and food. Those craving for authentic bengali cusine, head to 6 ballygunge place.

i was there for a sunday family lunch, curious to explore what the craze is all about! and what i had was pretty impressive. the ambiance was very pleasant, sophisticated and the new way this restaurant got decked up was redolent of Bengali Babu culture nostalgia.
now for a weekend lunch, since i had no booking i had to wait, but for a few minutes only which i didn't mind. i went for a la carte, and to be candid it seems buffet (which i had here before) in this particular resto is much economic than the former. the foods served were no doubt tasty but to my taste not something too extraordinary.
in detail, we took prawn cutlet and gandhoraj chicken for starter. prawn cutlet = crispy, awesome to taste, gandhoraj chicken = not the best yet good enough. next as maincourse we had bhetki paturi, bhuna mutton along with prawn pulao and the kaju kishmish pulao. bhetki paturi = was so so, bhuna mutton = serves 4 large pieces, was tender and deliciuos. talking about the pulaos kaju kishmish pulao = stands out with its light & flavorsome taste, while prawn pulao = was uniquely flavored.
 i went for a la carte this time coz i was determined to taste some items in particular. but choosing items was much influenced by the waiter there, whose hospitality was amazing though. he coaxed me into taking prawn cutlet instead of duv-chingri, which he suggested would be small regular prawns.
in general i love the luchis here, the fries and most of the starters (for a la carte) and would suggest anyone to opt for buffet. oh we also had desserts this time, baked sandesh rabri, mihidana rabri which all seemed average and less in quantity. except for the mishti doi (which was everyhow sweet & nice) & the mozzito in the tall glass which seemed soothing in a summer noon.

I think by far the best authentic bengali food restaurant. If you have not tried the Bhekti Fry and the Bhekti Paturi here then you are missing out. The ambience, the menu, the quality of the cooking is all quintessentially Bengali. Would love to go for the Buffet one day. Maybe next time ☺

6 Ballygunge Place needs no introduction. This has been & will continue to be the go to place for people looking for authentic Bengali dishes at a not so premium price. Although I have had the chance to relish on their delicacies at parties & receptions through 6 Ballygunge Place Catering, I was yet to taste the same at their flagship outlet. So when I got the chance to do the same on the occasion of inaugural dinner for 'Paat Perey Padma Parey' I was excited like anything.
Situated at, you guessed it right, 6,Ballygunge Place, it's actually an old building repurposed into a restaurant. So though it has all the modern amenities like elevators & air conditioning, at its heart it still manages to continue with the old world charm. The railings & windows are all from the bygone times. The carefully planned lightings, & decorative items like gramophone & wrought iron bird cages add to the beauty. Equally beautiful are the wall paintings which depict people of 'babu-bibi' times. Even the back of the chairs are beautifully painted in a matte finish resembling potochitros of rural Bengal. All in all you definitely get the feeling of being transported through a time loop into the yester era of Kolkata.
Coming to the food, it was a preset buffet comprising of select dishes that ballygunge place is known for.
1. Aam Pora Shorbot:
The welcome drink, made from roasted green mango and select spices was great. A touch too sour for me, but great tasting nonetheless.
2. Luchi:
Soft & fluffy, nothing to write about really.
3. Steamed Rice & Basanti Pulao:
Made from Basmati rice, the Pulao was excellent, but in my opinion could do with a li'l more sweetness.
4.Moong Dal:
Good, nothing exceptional.
5. Aloor Dum:
Too much Gravy ruined the show, taste was good, no complaints, but for something as a side to luchi, a drier preparation is desired.
6. Sim Aloo Paturi:
Who would have thought paturi could be made without fish also. 6BP did & managed to keep it tasty also.
7. Chhanar Kalia:
Balls of cottage cheese immersed in a lightly sweetened Gravy, I first mistook it for desert by the appearance. But to my astonishment the flavours were great & perfect for a side dish to rice.
8. Kachki maacher chocchori:
The Opar Bangla counterpart of putimacher chocchori this was appreciated by the fish loving people.
9. Doi Murgi:
Chicken in a white Gravy , with curd as the base. Amazing taste. In fact one of the dishes that 6BP excels at. However a little less oil would've made it more appropriate as a side to the rice. It felt more suited to breads.
10. Mutton Bhuna:
Another great dish. Pieces were evenly cooked & flavours adequately infused, making it all the more better. No wonder I ended up having having multiple serving of this.
11.Khejur Amsattor chutney & papad:
A standard sweet dish at the end of a Bengali meal. Was good.
12. Kesariya Phirni:
I highly doubt whether it's a Bengali dish at all. Predominantly featured in the dessert section of Mughlai restaurants, it was a pleasant surprise. However 6BP nailed it. It was really well made, creamy & cooked to perfection with the sprinkle of almond & cashew on the top.One of the best Phirni I have had in recent times, I ended up having two of this. Definitely a must try.
13. Bhaja Paan:
This one's quite an innovative item. Recommended by many & you'd know after you try it. Some may find it too sweet, but well a mukhsuddhi or mouth freshener generally is so. Unique in taste do try this when you visit.

All in all it was a great dinner. 6BP didn't dissappoint. Although did miss the gondhoraj chicken items I've had before at their Gupshup outlet & Catering. Will no doubt visit again to try the prawn items & other a la carte offerings.
Till then
Happy Eating
Cheers

The Kochki Machher Chorchori was brilliant, and the sheer simplicity and honesty of the dish is sure to make one’s heart melt. Another favourite of mine was the Murgir Lotpoti, which had the throat, stomach and liver of the bird along with the meat chunks, doused in a thick, whitish, slow-cooked gravy.
                                                                ...

The dining experience at 6 Ballygunj is surely lives upto its reputation. i mean, the quintessential Bengali feel in terms of food and ambiance. they have revamped, and that too on a good note, completely. First floor is the new addition. it adds to the typical Bengali Badi charm to this iconic authentic dining. The Ground floor is the one one where they spread the buffet and just in case you want to go for a la carte, they will direct you the First floor. A long staircase with a Vintage phone kept on the mid way is very small but quite unique idea.

It is more spacious now, well lighted, and you will have the feeling of openness.
It was a sunday dinner when we checked the new revamped 6 Ballygunj place. we already had our mind set as in what we would be ordering.

Drinks: We really liked their Mocktail page wherein each drinks is been given a street address.

1/1 AJC BOSE Road is something they serve as Virgin Mary with the rimmed glass and Tobasco in a syringe. you can add as per your taste bud.

Bhetki Paturi: It was quite authentic. fish was well flavoured and each and every ingredients were put to perfection. Look and feel of the dish was wonderful and tasted Great

Kasha Mangsho: Perfect Kasha Mangsho. the kind of i was craving for. Thank you for living upto my expectation and not letting me down. it was juicy, tender, well cooked and rightly spiced. The best accompaniments? either parantha or With some hot luchi just from the Kadai.

Keep giving us Memories....

Love you more with every visit.........

Had a sumptuous Bengali a la carte lunch with posto narkel bora, shuktoni, plain moong daal, murgir jhol, doi ilish, plain steamed rice and nolen gurer ice cream!!! And that's for my frugal diet. 😊
Coming after a pretty long time, in their newly renovated avatar, the quality of their food maintains the same high standard. The authentic quintessential Bengali. 
Nothing extravagant, flashy or noisy. All in synchrony. Food. Ambience. Etiquette. Music...and more.

Ilish tumi kar? Kolaghat-er na Padmar?
In my opinion this is the single most quintessential question that has plagued Bengalis, Bangladeshis & Bongs alike for decades if not generations.However more often than not the Ilish from Opar Bangla has emerged victorious in this fishy business.

Unfortunately for us, the Bengalis of Epaar Bangla , it has always been a tough luck to lay our hands on the golden crop of the Padma. The exorbitantly high pricing prevents us most of the time from tasting 'the' best fish God has ever created.Sometimes the imports are low, sometimes they are non-existent altogether. Blame that on the ever fluctuating relations between the two countries, which can change several equations, but not affect our love for food! Thus,we have always loved each others food irrespective of which side of the border we are on.

The recent venture by 6 Ballygunge Place attempts to bridge the gap. Serving Ilish & Chingri in the same menu & tries to bring the two Banglas closer.
As the name suggests "Paatpere Padma-parey" is the Bangladeshi food festival which will be held at the Flagship & Salt Lake outlet of 6BP from April 8 to 23 (excluding April 14), from noon till 3:30 p.m. & 7:30 to 10:30 p.m.

6 Ballygunge place had made its name in the Kolkata Food Scene long back by becoming the go to place for a authentic Bengali lunch or dinner. While their ala carte menu will continue serving their regular Epar Bangla specialities, the Festival menu brings in some special items from Opar Bangla too.
Starters like Putimach Bhaja will compliment the mains like Murgir Lotpoti, Mutton Bhuna apart from the stars of the meal i.e. Padma Nadir Ilish & Chingri Bharta. Dishes like Kachki Maachher Corchori , Seem Dana Bharta. Seem Aloo Paturi & Begun Khashiya will also be served..The meal will end on a sweet note of Kesariya Phirni.

The festival was kicked off by none other than our very own Bumbada, whose recent film deals with the post partition Bengal. 'Sankhachil' directed by the acclaimed director Sri Goutam Ghosh is winning hearts. This Indo-Bangladesh Production has already won the National Award for best Bengali feature Film. Speaking About the Epar & Opar Bangla, Prasenjit said, "I have never seen them as two different countries and that’s what we have tried to show in our film Sankhachil. I am happy that 6 Ballygunge Place is hosting 'Paatpere Padma-parey' and I’m certain everyone will enjoy the feast".

Meal for two comes at the price of Rs 1200 excluding taxes. Six Hundred Rupees is hardly a big price to pay when one can lay hands on authentic Padmar Ilish, that too prepared by Chef Sushanta Sengupta who has always tried to offer something new keeping to the tradition at 6 Ballygunge Place. So book your table before time runs out & embark on culinary journey across Opar Bangla with these mouth watering delicacies from 6 Ballygunge Place.
Happy Eating.
Cheers
                                          ...

Very well located tucked away from the bustling Ballygaunje Phari on a quiet bylane with easy parking facility. Menu is great and taste authentic.  Service is personal. Ideal for small group of family and friends due to the layout of the place.

And thus zomato puts an end to an evitably long desire of visiting the utopia of authentic bangali food. 6 Ballygunje place has long being on my wishlist and finally Zomato invited me as a part of Panch phoron to the inauguration of PAAT PEREY PADMAPAAREY , which is a culinary journey where Chingri machh and ilish machh meets. This festival is due from the 8th to 23rd of April. 

Location: The easiest way to reach 6BP is toavail the metro and reach Jatin Das Park , from where an auto for bondel gate is to availed. Hopping down near Ballygunje shitola mandir and walk right for a few minutes. There stands 6BP on the left.

Decor: Since it was a pre festival party, we were escorted to the banquet hall. On entering it, I was simply astounded. The typical chandeliers, the black and white checkered floors,the beautifully lined chairs gave an impression of shobhabazar rajbaari being revisited. The typical babuana flavour being imperative at every nook and corner.

Ambience: since we were much into the banquet hall, the ambience was simple enough. I wish some light bengali classic was being played. This would have just add spice to the authenticity. 

Coming to the most important part of the journey:
Beverages-
Aam porar shorbot : this was absolutely aunthetic roasted cumin mango drink served during bengali summers. Indeed refreshing. 

Mains-
Luchi : was enough fluffy and soft

Steamed rice 

Basanti pulao : the yellow rice was cooked to perfection with the right amount of spices.

Moong dal : this was decent as well.

Aloor dum : somehow I felt the luchi aloor dum lacked to create the magic as the aloor dum should have been could have been a bit on the drier side.

Sim aloo paturi :quite innovative and tasty. The spice in the right  amounts made it even more enjoyable.

Chhanar kalia : the cottage cheese drawn into pakoras were just way too authentic. The slightly sweeter aunthetic chhanar kalia was amazing.

Kachki maacher chorchori: this was however the surprise of the evening.  Haven't really known what kachki machh is. It is the 'bangal' form of puti machh. This was amazingly made, which brought a smile and contentment to the fish lovers.

Doi murgi : this was very well made. The marination was just too perfect. However , I did feel , it could have been less oily.

Bhuna magsho: the mutton pieces were soft and supple which made it even more palatable. The spices stood out in its taste and this in turn made bhuna mangsho a hit of the evening. 

Desserts-
Khejur chatni with papad : an evitable wayout to end up bangali bhuri bhoj. The dates and the papad made all the difference.

Kesaria phirni : possibly , I would have preferred a rosogolla or pantua to end up a bhuri bhoj. This kesaria phirni was way too amazing to even complain about not getting what I desired.  So, definitely recommended.

Fried paan : guess the numero uno of the evening. Had to be the fried paan. Its the same old end to a bhuribhoj, but this one has a new tinge. The strong aroma and flavour of paan lingers on your tastebuds for long. So definitely recommended.

All said and done. 6BP is a must visit for people who love quintessentially bangali cuisine. Please do drop into the PAAT PEREY PADMAPAAREY utshob to try out really interesting dishes where East Bengal fuses with West Bengal.

I will definitely recommend the place for its great service , polite well behaved staffs and last but not the least aw sum food. Its defiantly one of the best Bengali restaurants out there. I was in this place twice, first time, I had the "ilish macher paturi" and "chicken dakbanglo" both were just magnificent. The second time, i tried out the buffet on the new years eve, every thing on the plate from the starter to the desert was GOOD BENGALI FOOD. It had a mouth watering aroma, nice taste, good visual appeal, gourmet quality seasoning. Over all, It was a terrific dinner. One point of improvement is the ambiance else i would have given them a 5 but the food quality can obviously compensate it. Keep up the good work I will defiantly dine here again once I get the opportunity.

well.... for bengalee food lovers its the perfect place. when u r ready to spend ur earning on food u should do it in the right way and this place is one of those. Best bengalee food delivered out here according to me. No one out there in Kolkata delivers such beautifully tasty bangalee food. U must try the POSTOR BORA. Desserts are really good. Try the fishes. The cook it really good. Try AMSOTTOR CHATNI. Trust me u can't be dissapointed. u r gonna come out with big smile and with a perfect pet pujo. :) in some places during puja, they deliver u not the same quality food as they promise to but for 6 Ballyg they always keep their promise. 
TRY TRY.

I landed up on 6 Ballygunje Place one Sunday afternoon, after years of crossing by and thinking of popping in. The interiors are charmingly done, with vintage Bengali touches. The food is authentic and quite delicious. I liked how they named their mocktails after addresses, and I especially loved how their version of the virgin mojito (which they call 54A AJC Bose Road) is made with "gondhoraj lebu", a beautifully fragrant version of the common lemon. Service is good as well. I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for some good old Bengali food.

Bengali Cuisine at its best..
Went for dinner and opted fr their buffet service..
There were limited yet good dishes.. Starting wd luchi,begun bhaja, bhaat, kaju kishmish rice, moong daal, aloo dum, chanar dolna, echor chingri, parshe maach, doi chickn n mangshor jhol..
D luchi n begun bhaja ws well fried.. D rice ws of good quality.. Special mention for d moong dal. Ws yummy..
Veg items were good.. Echor ws good though chingri ws hardly seen in it..
Parshe maach ws well prepared n d fish ws of good quality. Chickn n mutton were very tasty..
Chutney ws also up to d mark.
The only place I feel dey need improvemnt is there desserts. There were only 2 items.. Mishto doi n pantua.. Mishti doi ws satisfactory bt d pantua ws d worst dish of d buffet.. It ws v hard..
It will b awesum if dey add a few items in dere dessert n improve d quality of dessert!!
Otherwise d food ws fingerlicking good..
The staff ws also helpful n service ws up to d mark..

Well its my first experience. Truly its an amazing place. Ambience is very good. Authentic bengali cuisine and the staffs are very good also.They suggested some items which were really very tasty.
We had ordered Chana with motorshuti chop which was very tasty!. then we also ordered Morola Maacher Pyaaji. Honestly saying i ve had this for the first time and it is extremely tasty.!!.
Then in the main course we ordered Kaju kishmish pulao,Kosha Mangsho and Stuffed doi potol. three of them were very good!.
I would surely recommend others to come and experience the Authentic bengali cuisine.
Very good service. 😊

Well to tell you the truth, I found Bhojohori Manna much better in terms of quality, taste and value for money. 

We ordered Fish Fry and Chicken Ghondoraj on starter which was awesome and we had best fish fry in our life at 6BP.

I'll try to review each and every dish we had. Moving to Main Course we ordered Steamed Rice and Biulir Dal with Prawn. We hardly found 3 prawn which didn't justified the price.

Next was Dab Chingri which if I compare the price, quality and taste with that of Bhojohori Manna, Bhojohori Manna wins hands down. The price of Dab Chingri is much more than that of Bhojohori Manna but doesn't serves Lobster / King Prawn like Bhojohori Manna instead uses general prawn which is available in Market easily.

Next was Ilish Paturi. I'd say it was great and 6BP have tried a new way of Paturi by using Gourd Leaves instead of common Banana Leaves.

Next comes the so called famous Doi Chicken. First of all when we tasted the curry, we felt like yummy..!! But when we moved on to the chicken, it was full of fiber. And this is not at all expected at restaurant like 6BP.

And finally, the bill was whooping 7k. Well I do not mind paying the amount, but if I justify the quality and value for money, it fails.

This is my second review of this place. It has a revamped look. The interiors  much better,new seats….gives a feel of openness and more space. First f loor is the new addition. More seats . Well arranged tables,gives you more privacy.
 The service is better. The waiters rather everyone is more cordial and prompt.
Now food. The menu is little altered. It seemed cooking has become better.The quantity is huge.We had prawn cutlets.Five pieces in a plate.Mourola macher peyaji was excellent as before. The ghol was not available.The mocktails didn't suit me. 
Main course was simple.Mutton pulao and kasha mangsho. Tmutton pulao was amazing. No oil, mild spices and what a taste. The mutton dish was  too good. First time tried this two items at this place.  Without a sweet dish a bong lunch or dinner is not complete.. The hot rabdi n mihidana combo was too sweet but heavenly.
Worth every dime and fully satisfied we two returned home.

Having loved the food at the Salt Lake branch, I was more than pleased about going to the original restaurant. Being vegetarian, we chose to go a-la-carte. The mochar chop was a delight and the achari lanka set my tongue tingling with heat. Unable to resist the charms of radhaballavi, I tasted that too and it was delicious. The dhokar dalna was well made with the dal cakes melt-in-the-mouth soft. The moong dal was subtle and satisfying. In my previous visit, I had had and loved the fresh mint drink. I tried a guava drink this time and did not enjoy its excessive tartness. Also disappointing was the chhanar malpoa which was just too heavy and might I say, average for a place like this. The place is done up very charmingly. The service was great except that it was quite a wait. This was a very good meal overall but in the end, I felt like I wasn't wowed. Not the way I had been in Salt Lake.

This is probably my favourite restaurant in Kolkata after they have renovated.
What a beautiful place and such Amazing food!
I go there on every occasion(well almost!)
I must say their new look is so so classy.
Coming to food their menu card even looks so classy and their mock rails have names after the street names of where some really distinguished illuminaries have stayed.
You just have to visit to know.
I LOVE their karaishuti r kochuri dim er devil and baked mihidana.
I visited the place recently for my birthday.
We ordered
Koraishuti r kochuri chhanar Dalna
Dim er devil
Rice
Chitol maachh er peti roast
Bhuna mutton
Daab chingri
Baked mihidana
And a mock tail named biren roy road.

I can die for their baked mihidana.
Love this place.Highly recommended!

This is a classy restaurent situated At ballygunge serving purely bengali delicacy..As soon as you come in front of the restaurent you feel as if you are entering a 2 storied bunglow..Mind you its not pocket friendly but If you really want you to sweep your friend and family with food this is a place to be..Intetior will take you to old world charm as if you are a zamindar and ready to enjoy your food..had ordered fish fry and gondhoraj chicken fry for starters along with great drinks named after roads..fish fry was soft from Inside and crisp out side with a dash of kasundi..will melt in your mouth .Chicken was stripped and marinated and fried given a flavour which is unique. .for maincourse had ordered..Chingri malai curry(prawn cream curry) ,Lal murgi jhol (red chicken curry preparation) echorer dalna (raw jackfruit curry) narkel posto bora, moong dal with maccher matha to go with steamed rice Ending with malpua and indrani..try this will take you to old days when Grand ma used to cook pithe..that is small rice and coconut flavoured balls dip in rich milk preparation..You must have malai curry normally places serve this with a sweet tinge but not at 6 ballygunge place they ensure that you crave for the gravy its creamier and not too sweet..Lal murgi was just great. .you can also have a buffet which will cost you 650+taxes.
Go for it guys..one place you cant miss if you are a foodie.

Last evening suddenly we got to know that we need to plan
for a lunch party for the entire project team as our manager from Chennai
wanted to give us a treat. I was asked to choose the venue as everyone knows
about my Zomatian activities.

I asked our manager if she would like to have authentic Bengali
food, she said YES provided it shouldn’t be spicy. From my prior experience at
the outlet in City centre 1 of 6BP, I could not think of any other place for
the requirement and that also in buffet category. Initially we were planning
for Dinner but buffet was not available for dinner so switched to lunch (I am
still burping by the way J
J )

We booked the place last evening for 30 people and they
asked us to drop in by 1:00 PM. We were a bit late and we got stuck in traffic while
driving from Bantala to Ruby. However, we reached there finally at 2:30 and
without wasting much of time, just took the plates and started with the Luchi
and brinjal fry (Begun Bhaja). There was no other fry items like the famous “helencha
shaak er bora” or the “Mochar chop” in the menu today – I don’t have any idea
why it was not there. This was followed by basmati rice, aloo posto, biuli
daal, dhokar dalna, sorshe katla, chicken kasha, doi mutton, chutney(mango and
aamsotto-khejur), misti doi, notun goor er rosogolla.

Definitely if not all, the Doi mutton was very sumptuous – I
don’t know if this preparation is made every day or not but I am considering
myself lucky enough to offer this blissful delicacy to my tastebuds. The misti
doi as usual like the city centre branch was excellent and so is the Rasogolla.
Aloo posto is such an item that we Bengalis have in our meals almost on a
regular basis but trust me this preparation is exceptionally lip-smacking .

As I already experienced the signature preparation of this
place – “Nolen gur er ice-cream” so this time I tried for a mocktail. The
preparation is called 54 AJC bose road. Surprised? Even I was. The waiter then
explained that as the restaurant itself is known by the address of the venue so
to keep a cup tie with the name, they have named their mocktails with the
address of renowned Bengali celebrities. “54 AJC bose road” which is nothing
but a virgin mojito, thus signifies Mother Teressa’s place. This one also, if
not awesome but good for the huge food that u have already consumed.

One negative point I would like to highlight here is the
fish was not washed properly – I found blood spots in the centre bone of the
piece I took. Check the photographs.

Having said that, it is really a nice place to
have authentic Bengali food and that also within a standard buffet price (583
rupees inclusive all taxes per head).

For a foodie hailing from Mumbai, having roots in Gujarat, when I reached Kolkata, something I really wanted to try was a meal of the famous Bengali cuisine. And thus, came my tryst with 6 Ballygunj Place. 

Highly acclaimed for its authentic Bengali dishes, this place appeals the pallet and at the same time does not disappoint the pocket. 

Disclaimer - as my name goes, this meal too was a pure vegetarian meal and yes, vegetarian Bengali, however funny it may sound, was brilliantly prepared, presented and devoured at 6 Ballygunj Place. 

There isn't much variety of vegetarian food but, if ordered correctly, the limited variety is more than sufficient. 

In the starters, the begun bhaja (4/5) is a dish which can be ordered by people who enjoy aubergines prepared in a masala and it goes well with the jhur jhure aloo bhaja (2.5/5) which is similar to crispy aloo sev. 

Along with that, I tried the virgin Mary drink which taste wise is regular to any other virgin Mary but what intrigues me is the presentation of the drink (4/5). Served in a short glass, the tobasco to go with the drink is served innovatively in a syringe. Small details but make the meal interesting. 

In the mains, Mochar Ghonto (4/5) and Mochar Paturi (5/5) bring the flavours of Bengali cuisine to the table. Both have a base of banana florets but each having a unique flavouring of its own. A must try. Along with that, we ordered the bhaja masala aloo dum (3/5) and the chholar dal (3.5/5). The dal is a thick dal having a distinct coconut flavour. The aloo bhaja is similar to the dum aloo, nothing special. 

In the breads section, we ordered the Loochi, Karaishutir kochori and Radhaballavi. Loochi is a simple crisp and fluffy puri and the kochori and Radhaballavi are variations of the same. A nice variation and can be tried. 

We did not order rice dishes as, in Kolkata, meals are either with Loochi or with rice but not both together, and if in kolkata, do as the Calcuttans do. 

In the dessert section, go for the Mishti doi (5/5). A simple sweetened yogurt, served in a clay pot. Gives a good finish to the meal. One can also try the baked sandesh (3.5 /5) which is a bengal speciality made from channa and rabdi. 

I also tried the nolen gurer ice cream which is a local flavour of ice cream made of jaggery (gud). An interesting flavour which I found alright but for someone who enjoys the taste, a must try. 

The staff is very curtious and service is swift. The ambiance is a stand out and makes the meal a memorable experience. 

Will surely visit this restaurant the next time I'm visiting Kolkata. 

Food and drinks (4/5) 
Ambience (5/5)
Cost (4.5/5)
Overall experience (4.5/5)

If you love bengali cuisine, this is one of the few places in Kolkata where you can get authentic dishes. Their buffet is excellent - they serve hot, freshly prepared "luchi" in a basket to start with and the spread includes both veg and non-veg varieties of famous bengali dishes like "dhokar dalna", "potoler dolma", "alur dam", "bhetki paaturi", "kasha mangsho", "mochar ghanto", "pabda jhaal", "mishty doi" to name a few. In a-la-carte one must try the "daab chingri" and "sorshe ilish". Their name is their address i.e. 6 Ballygunje Place and after the recent renovation, the ambience has also improved - very much bangali with background Rabindra Sangeet. A must visit in Kolkata!

Bisudho bangali Khabar....went 4 a birthday celebration... Good 4 Bengali food lovers...but din't quite ring the bell 4 us..
1)buffet spread is so so ....not much variety
2)to b specific,starter option were only kochuri & kumrolina...both r good but not good enf 4 a high priced buffet starters...
3)no mocktails in buffet
4)main course option ws rice & fried rice....even a pulao or I guess variety of roti wd Have done justice
5)we cd nt find anything in salad option...soni guess it's not include in buffet
6)no option of complementary birthday cake or food or anything 4any celebration which I guess quite a disadvantage compared to other places offering buffet
7)once u ask 4extra starters...they take forever to serve...so u r like eating dessert when starters come
8)cooking ws a win win but truly we dint end up there for eating one variety of fish(vetkir jhal),one variety of chicken (doi murgi...gravy ws OK but chickens were not@all testy),mutton(jhol,well it ws well cooked)...I mean wat if sm1 dsnot like that particular dish...they just Hv to discard item....like oh chicken is not that gr8 can I hv any other dish with chicken??noooo there's only one variety🙍.
9)chanabora ws good & as usual only 1 variety
10)dessert ws extremely limited...misty doi,pineapple chutny & khejur chatny,malpoa.end.....ice cream or payes or rasagolla or atleast sandesh...for which bangalis r famous wd Hv done justice🙇.
11)last but not least,if u r really considering having buffet here consider this...book a cook(or ur mom!) To cook fried rice,paneer,chicken,mutton,chutny & papar & fish if u wish or just order a caterer cz all dishes in ballygunge place felt like home cooked💑 (so sweet but not gr8 to celebrate) & buy misty doi from sm famous misty shop(or make@home) & voila!!!u just had all d funs we had there😳 without having to leave home...I just saved u a lot of time😋so Hv a gr8 celebration & add whatever complementary cake/luchi payes u wana add👍

Last Saturday, having craving for Bengali food me and my wife went to the renovated 6, Ballygunge Place.. They have increased their seating. We found the place under staffed, thou the steward who took our order didn't quite agree with me.. So finally after waiting for 20 mins he took our order...
We ordered for Chanar Dalna (i enjoyed it as its my favourite in my menu) Cholar dal( thick dal), Alu bhaja (potato sticks finely cut and fried to perfection)as my wife is a hardcore vegetarian and I ordered for non-veg food, murgir jhol (the chicken was tender and juicy) and steam Aam kasundi murgi(I didn't quite enjoy it because mustard had given it pungent taste)..along with it roasted papad(the paper wasn't roasted well, when pointed out to the steward was told this is the max we could do).

For deserts I had misti doi which tasted heaven...

Overall the service wasn't that great what it used to be earlier, food took a lot of time to come. The taste was good, thought not so good as I expected out to be. Being ardent fan of this place I would keep coming here, Overall I would rate it 4/5

We finally got to taste the brilliance of the original 6 Ballygunge Place address after Saraswati Puja. Having a massive appetite, we settled for the very appropriately priced buffet. Starting with super hot luchi and begun bhaja on the table accompanied by aloor dum from the buffet spread, the gastronomical journey began on a wonderful note. ( Had 8 luchis myself! :P )

The scorching heat outside pulled us towards the mocktail menu, from which we settled for 16/22 Temple Gardens (weird blue drink, not very refreshing) and 4, Moira Street (standard fresh lime). The names of the mocktails are catchy as ever. 

The buffet spread greeted us with EPIC AMAZING bhetki paturi. The paturi was compact, with a 'fragrance' that could get any Bengali drooling in seconds, and tasted  heavenly. Then followed really good Laal Mangshor Jhol and Home Style Mutton Curry. The chicken could have been a little more tender but I guess the overall experience on the food could do without any complaints.

The dessert spread had two variants of mishti chutney, both of which were good. Lipsmacking mishti doi followed with a delicious and famous Bengali sweet. I must say, the spread was pretty much worth the money spent. 
However, a slight issue happened when there was confusion as two stewards informed us differently regarding a complimentary drink (no complimentary drinks are given, by the way). I'd give it a 4.5 rating otherwise.

Amazing food, amazing ambiance. Visiting soon for the famous daab chingri. :)

Chance visit to this place on my first trip to Calcutta in 10 years. Words can't express the palate arousing dishes, Bengali food manifested at its best. The desserts had my Gujju and Marwari friends (veggie, non Bengali cuisine loving guys) licking their fingers and wanting more. A complete experience and I dashed again to the place on my next visit there so as to confirm the consistency and again left wanting more. This place really completes Calcutta....wish they open an outlet in Dubai.

That is all i can say about 6 ballygunge place in one line..well, it was my first visit to this place..i am fond of bengali cuisine and having gone through the reviews about it, i wished to go there...so, lets talk about the food..they provide great buffet (probably best among those bong restaurants who provide buffet)...the buffet consisted of luchi, begun vaj@a, basmati rice, veg dal, alur dom, sak vaja, an item made with potato and tomato, parshe mach er jhal, chicken, mutton kasha, papad, 2 types of chutney (both aam and khejur-amsotto), pantuya and misti doi...each and every item was too much tasty, especially mutton kasha as it was perfectly boiled...the behaviour of the staffs were very cordial..and@ the price was quite reasonable...i definitely want to go there again and again...

I went for a family lunch to this restaurant in Jan 2016 and I will surely rate my experience as one of the best. The very fact that they serve  you hot Luchi and Begun bhaja at your table is a great thing to begin your lunch with. They are tasty indeed and I can tell you that you will try it couple of times and fill a part of your stomach with it before you even have a look at the buffet options. The buffet offers great options for non vegetarian people – the day when I tried, it had Sorshe Vetki (4 out of 5), Doi Murgi (excellent is an understatement. The pieces were big, yet so well cooked) and Kosha Mangsho (this is mutton and soft mutton! Yum!! )

The starter options are bit limited with only chicken cutlet being available. But that was great too – I tried 4 and I wanted to eat more, I swear!

You might have noticed that in many restaurants in Kol, the dessert choices are bit repetitive and common. It is not the case here. You get Mishti Doi and Gurer Rasogolla. They are awesssommeee!!! I wish I kept some more space in my stomach to try more. 

The staff are polite and friendly, though they are bit busy serving so many people at the same time. 

The ambience is too good, of course one of the reasons is that they have renovated it recently. The walls and décor and light are all shining – hope they maintain it this way

And it is not pricey – the buffet with so many options cost 550 plus tax. I will call it economical. I have not tried the Ala carte, so cant comment if that drills more in your pocket. 

Overall, very nice experience and surely worth spending your lunch time in with your dear ones.

Situated at a place identical with its name this restaurant offers an unforgettable experience and leaves you craving for the next visit. To start off they have adequate parking space which provides a hassle free experience to people coming in their cars. Ambiance, decor is wonderful and there is adequate space to house around 70 people. Seats are very comfy.Coming to the food it truly offers provlbably the best bengali cuisine among the standalone restaurants in the city. The Kosha Mangsho(Mutton) was delicious and it seemed to melt in my mouth and so was the Chingri pulao. The chicken items were also delicious and overall the place is highly recommended.

Visited the place for buffet dinner on Saraswati Puja - 13th Feb,2016. The menu included steam rice,khichuri,beguni,labra,alur dam,luchi,mugh dal, morola mach fry, sorshe die rui mach, chingri mach, chicken, mutton,kuler chatni,tomato chatni, nolen gurer chom chom, abar khabo sandesh and vanila ice cream. We were also served gandhoraj ghol. However, the taste of the food was not up to the mark. The sorshe mach tasted pale, so was the chicken. The quality of mutton was that good. There was practically nothing in the starter menu. Also expected items like bhetki paturi or bhapa mach. Also it could have included some veg items. The service and ambience was great tough.

This group of restaurants have become my family's favourite eating joint and catering group for a while these days. I have been coming here since my school days with my parents being a student of Patha Bhavan. We have been missing this place for a while as they were shut down for renovation and we had to travel all the way from South Kolkata to Salt Lake for the sake of 6 Ballygunge Place delicacies. As they are open now in a completely new manner and style with much elegance and class, I am all happy to come here regular than before.
So, it was yesterday, Saraswati Pujo in the city. We were gifted a gift coupon meal for two by the 6 Ballygunge Place authority for being their regular patrons. Me and my friend had decided to go and have a la carte lunch as there were no boundaries in the things we ordered. First things first. The food was awesome, completely keeping up to the typical standards of 6 Ballygunge Place.
We had ordered Chingrir Chiney Kebab and Steamed Aam Kasundi Murgi for starters. The chicken was spicy devouring the flavour of mustard and chillies. The prawns were good as usual. We were so elated to try them again after such a long time. Then for the main course, we had Chingrir Pulao, Bhuna Mangsho and Kakrar Jhaal. These all are those dishes which I have tried so many times and needless to say that all of them are really delicious, satisfying your taste buds to the fullest.
I won't bug much about their food because they are just out of the world and need no comment upon that. But what I was mesmerized by is how they have completely transformed their old house into a classy elegant resto serving Bengali food remembering the charms of Old Kolkata. I am extremely happy at this transformation and I am very sure that I will keep coming back here again and again. Happy Dining! :)

What a wonderful b'day celebration it was in 6 B.P.

Magnificent Food .

Wonderful Ambience.

And Great Service from all of them.

Its my 7th visit there , and I still want visit it again and again .

Well Mutton Dakbanglo was fabulous .

So was "The Grilled Fish"

The Grilled Fish and other continental dishes  were  outside there comfort zone.

Still still they put forward amazing food.

Other than this mutton pulao, chingri pulao ,chitol mach , Ilish Paturi , jumbo prawn , kabiraji , chicken ala kiev were outstanding .

Hospitality from their people were really amazing .

>  0.5 which I took away from them is because Sometimes they lack in Buffet Menu Department, which I sincerely hope they will take care in the years to come .

Visited 6BP  on a sunday. Feasted on the brunch. A very sumptuous spread. The mutton dak bunglow was the best dish hands down, followed by Fish Kabiraji . Even the chicken and fish dishes were equally good but mutton,for me, stood out.
The sweet dishes were delectable, "Baked Mihidana with Rabri" in particular and even the chutneys were delicious.
Would love to visit every weekend to savour the delectable bengali cuisine.
I also loved the décor and full marks to the choice of tableware.
An extremely fulfilling experience. The best in the city of joy....!!!

This is a must-go-to place for us when we visit Kolkata, and it's a bit of exotic bangla food which we just don't get (in Dubai), and it's a bit of how ma (mom) would make it. Or how it's made at my in-laws. This is just magic.

We have been many times, and never really come away disappointed. Ever. The food is consistently good. From the begun bhaja, cholar dal, shukto, dhokar dalna, aloo jhingey posto, to golda chingri, bhapa ilish, pabda jhal and kosha mangsho, everything is just amazing. Each and every time. Oh, and the loochi. 

We don;t deep fry at all at home, so the loochi is a stand out item. As is the posto – because that stuff is actually banned in Dubai. The bhapa ilish (like a baked hilsa) is fanastic. And the kosha mangsho (mutton curry) is how every bhadralok's kitchen would make it. Just the right side of oily, but oh, so, delicious.

Just can't wait to get there again. Apparently, they've just renovated. So, it should be another treat.

If anyone wants to wallow in the sublime taste of authentic bengali cuisine, there is none other than 6 Ballygunj Place. After the renovation this place is shining like a new penny, offering a pacifying and an aesthetically soothing ambience. Me and my parents had the dinner buffet. Every single item in the buffet stood out brilliantly. But the Dum Aaloo, Dhokar Dalna, Mutton Dakbunglow and Mango Chutney deserve special mention. Also, Daab Chingri and the Shuntki Maach that we got separately were amazing. The staffs were very cordial and courteous. In conclusion I must say, 6 Ballygunj Place is back in the game, Oh Calcutta you better watch out!

The restaurant has undergone a complete overhaul since we last visited. An entire new floor has been added and the interior decoration reflects traditional ethnic Bengali mores. Needless to say, the restaurant now looks much better designed, comparable to other 4-stars in the city. The staff were extremely courteous and professional. As for the food, the Bengali cuisine served was top notch and delicious. We started off with gandhoraj chicken, mourala machher peyaji and kabiraji cutlet. The starters set the tone for our main course, comprised of kaju kishmish pulao, chicken tramfrado, begun basanti, chalkumro fry, steamed rice, tel koi, sorshe ilish and rohu kalia. All were equally toothsome and exquisite. Finally came the famed nolen gur er ice-cream, a signature dish famous for its authentic mixture of nolen gur and gelato. Overall, a highly recommended place for bengalis who want a break from their mundane bhaat-dal-torkari preparation.

Delicious bengali food served beautifully.

Got the chance to try their food as they were catering for a friend's reception and what a treat it was. With a spread that consisted of a good selection of non vegetarian eats, the service was amazing. 

I was delighted to see that the plates were handed over to guests from individually packed paper bags. They had a few salads on display but I quickly passed that to make my way to the non veg counter. The first thing that attracted me was the lemon butter fish which was being grilled hot to perfection (crispy and crunchy on the outside and soft, tender and flaky on the inside) served with butter garlic sauce. I think I ate this and went to heaven!
They also had chicken, mutton, matar poori, aloo and koftas on offer that were all delicious but had particular spice notes that did not suit my palate (maybe because I have not eaten too many bengali dishes to have acquired the taste).
The desert counter had an assortment of sweets that was served in 'mitti' bowls and topped with rabri alongwith sandesh.

Sophistication all the way! The place looks like any regular household with a revamped aristocratic look where time never gallops, rather it slowly waddles it way through. The black-white photographs of quintessential Kolkata-ness gives the effect of a studio living room with awesome food to offer. 
We started off with the Aam-Pora Shorbot. Definitely the best shorbot by a mile. It actually had the smoky, charry flavor of the raw mango; a beautiful palate cleanser. We ordered for traditional Bengali food-fare. Since I'm a dedicated Bhakt of all things dal, we ordered rice, jhurjhure aloo bhaja and moongmohan. Oh how heavenly it was!! Dal tempered with just right amount of spices, subtle and not too overpowering and complicated. Aloo Bhaja just the way Grandma makes it. 
Then came the pièce de résistance, Dab Chingri. 8 pieces of juicy, fresh prawns swimming in a mild gravy of mustard and coconut. By the far, the best I have had. 
After gorging on so much food, we really didn't have any place for desserts. 
Hopefully, that will be covered in the next visit. 
It is True: Bengalis do know how to dine in style and this place proves the point brilliantly!

But yep, the Bengali cuisines they make were good but I didn't really enjoy it I keep the money matter in mind. May be as I'm a vegetarian..I didnt get to taste most of their famous items. But for sure, the ambience was really great, classy and equally arty.

One of the family favourites for a clan-lunch or a welcome home-lunch for a probashi member. We might be trying out every new place on the block but we will always be coming back to places like these for a hearty bangali meal! My personal favourites are lote machher bora, mourala machher peyaji, bhetkir jhal, chitol muithya, kosha mangsho and ilisher tel jhal, and of course, the jhurjhure aloo bhaja! O yes, and the names of the mocktails are so unique, always lead up to a  guessing-game session while our bhaja bhujis arrive!

Its an Authentic Bengali restaurant. One of my and my family's fevorite. A vintage home converted a chain bengali restaurant. I dnt remember haw many tym i hv been here. Evry durga puja this place comes for my family on "must go " list . U will find this place very crowded and packed. specially on sunday and Saturday noon time. U might hv to b on line or write name to security to get a place.
Ambiance hold the key to the brand. If u r thinkgn of hvng lunch with family thn i would suggest to go for buffet . Coz u r gona get lot of various types of food all together.   i loved " bhetki paturi " thts my fev.  "choral daal" with "fish fry" and "begun vaja" . My lil sister loves specifically that " nolen gur er ice creme. . I hv no complain bout their food.  Seriously very low price and very tasty food. I nvr had a chance to  review this place. But today Suddenly i saw on zomato so did it 😇. I should do this b4.

This was my second visit to this place, the first time was pretty good since it was during the last year's durga Puja. This time I had a mixed feeling about the place. I wanted to try the much hyped "daab chinkri". Ordered dat, rice n 2 cocktails since this place doesn't serve alcohol. Virgin Mary had a fancy name on the menu but had a disappointing taste. The "aampora sorbot" was so much better and almost half the price. The bigger disappointment was wen the daab chinkri came, it had medium sized prawns only. Seriously a waste of the gourmet dish. And of course a pocket pinch of almost half a k. The service and the ambience are bang on the Bengali theme but the signature dish was so messed up.

This is one place that has consistently good food and has provided a very pleasant overall dining experience the last few times I've been here. 
The Pantharas were an item I hadn't come across before but they were well executed. I would also strongly recommend the classics - Daab Chingri, Ilish Paturi and the Kosha Mangsho. I'm not very particular about ambience in general but the home style decor does add a nice feel to dining here.

I had stayed away from home for quite some time and was craving for bengali food and this place was all i could have asked for! Right from aam panna, basic rice, Brinjal fry to mutton curry and fish in mustard gravy, everything was very delicious! "Baked sondesh" and gulab jamun were perfect to finish with! You could visit this place with your friends family or date!

The occasion was that I was going to get married and i had to disclose it to two of my bosses. Now, I had to give them a treat and so went to this place. 
Though, this place has less items for buffet; thank god its a good thing, since all their items tasted fantabulous.
My bosses love it so much they gave me a return treat at the same place.

I was gonna rate this place a 3.5 due to the buffet menu being ridiculously small if you go by the number of items available for 600 per person but although few almost everything it had to offer tasted SO good.
The ambience is good, could have been made better and the service is quite good too if not the best. The buffet spread as I have mentioned before is of the highest quality in taste but very less in number.
The place was a bit difficult to find as it is situated a bit away from the main road.
A must try if you want some authentic 'ghoti' bengali food in your taste buds. Table reservation recommended. 
Food-4/5.
Ambience-3.5/5.
Location-3.5/5.
Staff-4/5.
Value for money-4/5.

Outstanding. It was my last night in Calcutta before heading back to Dubai. My friends asked me what cuisine I preferred. I said Bengali and we headed to this place. We over ordered. The greedy us. 
Excellent portions. Great taste. Yummy food. 
Highly recommended and must visit if you are in Calcutta. 
Table reservations are a must.

Being a vegetarian, I have had limited choices. But Have treated more than 500 people at this place. 

All had one word. AWESOME!!.. 

Must try items are Illish paturi and Daab chingri. Its a complete bengali cuisine and one would love the authentic taste. 

They do catering as well, and best at it.

A heaven for lovers of Bengali food ... As a Bengali who doesn't stay in Kolkatta, this place is special for me :) the moment one enters here, one would start anticipating some great food coming your way ! Start with the classic all time favourite fish fry.. Try the chingri, ilish maach, aloo posto on the menu accompanied by some aloo bhaja ! You are guaranteed a smile on your face :)

Over priced. I'd go there only with cousins visiting from abroad, or if I'm in the city and desperately want shutki maachh. Yes, their shutki maachh is todiefor. The nolen gurer icecream is decent too. I've recently fallen in love with their narkel-posto bora but I still maintain that they are ridiculously priced. One should definitely try their peas kochuri with the chholar daal and mochar bora and mortally avoid the oil drenched radhaballavis.

Amazing place to be, to start with the decor and the ambience; it has no words, simple but authentic very beautiful, which added the cherry was the beautify traditional Bengali audio tracks playing at the background.

Had been there with my best friend and family. Being a Sunday I had reserved the table to be confirmed and get a table without waiting in the queue. I would suggest you to do the same.

For the food: started with Mutton Pantaras which was ok nothing that great, the fish fry, kacha lonkha bora ilish and the traditional all time favorite mochar chop was just out of the world, delicate and freshness of all the flavors and ingredients were just coming out so distinctively. To flush this down was the fresh aam pora sharbat ❤️

For the mains: we had ordered Kosha Mangsho, Daab Chingri, and Ilish paturi with steamed rice, no words all the dishes were outstanding and just could not resist to have more....along with Fresh lime soda salted.

As we did not want the flavor of the food go and being stuffed we did not try the desserts.

I was very happy with the food, it was fresh and had a distinctive flavor and the that homely touch was there.

The service could be better if trained well.
Had an amazing time and my best friend and family loved it. On my next visit would love to try the buffet.

Very disappointed at 6 Ballygunge Place. Had the Lunch buffet on 15th Aug which was Rs 1000 (plus tips) per head including taxes. They charged full for the 8 yr old non-eater, but I ignore that. Did they do ok with me? No.

The spread wasn't value for money, either in terms of quality or quantity. Pedestrian variety of both veg and Non-veg. The Anarosh-pora sorbot to start with was nowhere. Neither appetizing, nor tasty. I looked for flavor at the end of day. With the exception of the Paneer Dumplings with peas filling, which was exceptional, I can't say anything that stood out at all. The filled Kakrol was semi raw, the dimer devil was dry but passable. Radhaballavi was served hot on the table, but eat it with what? A mixed dal, more resembling Punjab than Bengal (though very tasty) or a Dum Aloo, which was probably cooked by an intern from a local catering school?

Among the Non-veg items (a grand total of 4), the prawns were too small, smacking of being cheap. The paturi was so dead dry, I had to gulp water to get it in. The Chital Machher Muithha was in too small a bite, didn't make any sense. On this particular item, I have to say I'm biased because mother made the best one. I've had none beat her as yet and this one is forgettable, doesn't even come close. That Kawsha Mangsho might have been good, but by this time I was so pissed off at having to spend 3k bucks for 2.5 people for this nonsense, I hardly tasted it.

3 desserts, none worth the bytes to upload a review.

So, what would I take home, if any? Just from flavor, The dal, though Punjabi, was good. The paneer dumpling with pea filling was exceptional. The prawn curry, with small prawns, would mustr some grades. Everything else is hype.

Many Bengali restaurants in my distant NCR serves better value for price.

Had a buffet Dinner. Ambience is GOOD. The variety of food on offer is impressive. Almost everything tasted great, including their Pinapple Juice.  It's really hard to explore much of the main course and the desserts.

Definitely a good option if you're looking for a bit of occasional luxury in terms of food.

But am not Happy with the Price.. Its bit expensive comparing with the menu...

A very decent place for bengali food. Ala carte is okay, but the buffet is real value for money. I ordered chana dal,  dry masoor dal (both bengali style), shukto, alu posto, and pomfret cooked in curd and mustard paste. All the items were excellent except shukto which was not upto the mark. The fish was truly exceptional. Nolen gur ice cream - well I think all the restaurents get it from same vendor. I tried this thing in all the bengali restaurents and the taste was identically good. By some misfortune found a hair in our alu posto, which was a setback for the experience. When informed the hotel guys changed it and did not charge it in bill.

A peculiar place in Kolkata giving strange yet homely ambience. Nice variety of Bengali cuisine offered both in buffet as well as Ala-Carte. 
Overall nice experience to a typical North Indian palette, decently priced however would definitely recommend ala-carte since buffet dishes didn't seem warm and tempting, despite nice variety.
Must try dessert - Cottage cheese and Jaggery

If you are a non-Bong and planning to visit 6 Ballygunge then read this. I have been there once only and this review is only for Thali they serve, I didn't try other things.

The first thing you will notice is that 6 Ballygunge Place is a Bungalow. So seating arrangement is unique. They have put in tables across different rooms, dining room, halls etc and preserved the feel of the bungalow. Secondly, it does seem like the restaurant is in need of some makeover as most of the furniture and interiors seems highly used up and torn.

Coming to thali, don't expect Naans and Biryanis if you are North Indian. The thali in which they serve food is so heavy that a waiter can bring only one Thali at a time. Thali comprises mainly of Puri (Luchi) and Steamed Rice. However, I must praise and praise again the mutton, fish, and prawn they served. Each one of them was authentic with rich ingredient and really gave a home cooked feel. If I ever visit this place again, I am gonna try all three again. Even the chutneys also have home made feel.

Over all if you are in Kolkata, and wanna try Bengali food....visit no other place than this. You will have lots to talk about.

This restaurant is an esteemed 12+ years old restaurant, and is very popular amongst Bengali cuisine lovers. It is divided into 5 rooms, and it’s total seating capacity is 78. Seatings are in the form of chairs and sofas. Apart from a Victoria Memorial style bench, there is a separate room outside for waiting. It’s called ‘Baithak’. There is ample parking space outside. Décor is in hues of red, off white and brown, and is very simple. Furniture is wood and leather. Different rooms have different flooring, ranging from wood style tiling, to marble blocks. Walls are adorned with small and big framed pictures and graphiti.

Of all days possible, we happened to dine there on a heavy monsoon day, when even a cyclone was predicted! Instead of discouraging, it all the more evoked the belly fire of true foodies, who were now more determined to enjoy the rich and fried Bengali delicacies. 

The 6 Course Vegetarian Dinner included – 
********************************************************

Course 1: Aam Pora Sarbat (Aam panna). It was thick and sweet. Quite a thirst wrencher.

Course 2: Mochar Chop (Croquettes of plantain floret) and Chhana Motor Shutir Chop (Cottage cheese and green pea croquettes) with Kashundi (Mustard sauce) and Salad. 

Bengali vegetarian cuisine is exclusive in the sense that, other than fruits and vegetables, it makes good use of other parts of plants, like – stem, leaf, flower etc. ‘Mochar’ refers to the flower part of banana plant and it’s quite an exclusive ingredient of Bengali cuisine.

Both Chops were nice. They were crispy from outside and their respective fillings were well cooked. Normally, we consume the starters with tomato ketchup and/or green chutney. Herein, we consumed them with Kashundi aka Mustard Sauce, which is widely used in Bengali cuisine. An authentic Kashundi preparation is done by using raw mango along with mustard seeds, and thus it is also referred as, Aam Kashundi.

Course 3: Loochi (Maide ki kadhai ki poori), Chholar Dal (Bengali dal with coconut), Bhajamasala Aloo Dum (Aloo Dum in spicy tomato gravy). Most of the Kolkata based vegetarians must have tasted the Loochi and Chholar Dal combination, as it is a must in all Bengali marriages, ‘bhog’, and is widely available as a breakfast option, in many of Kolkata’s Bengali sweet shops. They tasted as per expectation. Bhajamasala Aloo Dum was quite a downer. Neither it tasted like a regional delicacy, nor it matched the everyday ‘aloo sabji’ preparation in most of our homes. ‘Aloo Jhinga Posto’ (A potato and ridge gourd curry made in khus khus gravy) would have been a better option.

Course 4: Steam Rice, Kaju Kismis Polao (traditional Bengali rice preparation, rich with a tinge of sweetness), Thorer Ghonto (Melange of banana floret, potato and coconut, in a mustard marinade), Bati Chorchori (Dry mixed vegetable), Navaratna Paturi (Mixed vegetables, cottage cheese, mustard and coconut wrapped in banana leaf and grilled). Kaju Kismis Polao was subtle and sweet in taste. However, it is a developed taste for diners who are more accustomed to north-western versions of ‘pulao’. ‘Thorer’ refers to the stem part of banana plant. Thorer Ghonto was very well cooked. Bati Chor Chori was also nice. Navaratna Paturi was most awaited, as it was a vegetarian take on a popular ‘hilsa’ fish recipe. Also, we had never tasted it before. Though it was well cooked, but the end result failed to achieve anything.

Course 5: Papad and Aamer Chutney (Mango Chutney). Papad was non spicy and fried. Aamer Chutney was sweet and had big raw mango chunks. It’s very much like the non spicy version of ‘laungi’. It’s a Bengali tradition to have papad and sweet chutney before desserts. Most Indian vegetarian cuisines have only papad before dessert.

Course 6: Patishapta With Kher ( Rice, semolina, flour crepes stuffed with coconut and jaggery mixture, served with rabri like sauce)and Aam Chhanar Payesh (Cottage cheese balls and milk pudding). Patishapta is a traditional and popular Bengali dessert, made particularly on ‘Poush Sankranti’, and also eaten otherwise. 

Patishapta was the hero of this meal. The crepe was thin, uniform and chewy. The blend of its filling was very nice and tasted better than most of the ‘Patishaptas’ that we have had till date. Chhanar Payesh was also good. Inclusion of mango chunks in the payesh, made it all the more tasty. It was good fusion.

All in all, it was a well prepared and hearty meal. Staff was courteous and patient.  They were well informed about the serving dishes. The old gate-keeper was attentive in escorting the guests back to their vehicles, under his big umbrella. It was pouring, and the canopy of his umbrella was surely welcomed.

I was here last on the day when the unfortunate first earthquake shook Nepal in the month of April 2015. But nothing unfortunate with the food that was in store for us here. As it was a weekend, I did call up for reservations before going down since I had to wait for long twice I was there last. The buffet spread was awesome. We ordered some starters from the menu as well and were not disappointed. It was the fish kobiraji and the portion was huge. I have never seen such a big kobiraji in my life. The buffet spread (although very very limited for vegetarians) was plentiful for us non-veggies. Hence I would never complain. The mourola maachh aar peyaaji for the starters along with the kobiraji is what filled me up. I still went ahead and had the chicken gravy, pulav, mutton and the baked shondesh. The food in one word is awesome and I keep coming for this experience.

The reason I am putting 4 instead of 5 in the rating is because of the negative attitude of the staff there (mainly the servers). I know it's a thankless job but service industries have their disadvantages but that should never trickle down in your demeanour towards patrons.

A must go to enjoy quality bengali food at a affordable price.6 ballygunje place is a nice and suttle balance between bojhohori manna and oh calcutta .The food is really good and authentic as well as it is not a very pocket pinching experience.

Location : the place is located just bang opposite to a restaurant called fish fish.they have converted the bungalow into a very decorative restaurant  .

Food : We ordered for topshe mach bhaja, korai shutir chop for starter.The starterd were absolutely awesome. The korai shutir chop was exquisite as thr chop were made up with a very unique filling of cottage cheese and peas and gently fried served with kashundi. A foodie cannot ask over anything in a super rainy weather.Our next indulgence was topshe mach bhaja,a plate of topshe mach has 5 pieces and trust me they are really good.They are properly fried with not so excess amount of batter in them .

Main course was just magic. We ordered for a sukto, paneer malai,sona mug dal,doi ilish and and shorshe ilish.THe doi ilish was amazing with right amount of curd and  mustard . The shorshe ilish was yet a killer with sweet smell off mustard oil filling up the nostrill 

We ordered for noren gur icecream which was something different and unique

A very good expereince with amazing food and supergood hospitality

Just happens to be the ideal place to indulge in a simple yet traditionally set bengali cuisine. Often it so happens that we crave similar food from a place other than from ones in domestic confines. And this place happens to be the very same haven for the nonchalant bengali gentleman. You'd expect to be greeted by a mix of veteran and new staff who waste no time in setting your table which lay standing on the magnificent grandeur of number 6. The very surrounding somehow makes you enjoy your food more be it plain rice or kosha mangsho. Plenty to choose from but the listing caters to bengali cuisine only. Here quantity isn't very impressive but the quality has remained the same from our last 2008 visit. Very keen and eager personnel and top notch ingredients are used. It's a fish lovers paradise but don't expect a pond.

well, I did not get the "quintessential bengali feel" but never the less the restaurant serves good food. 

1stly the location, it is not easy to fine the easiest one would be taking the lane adjacent to the ITI going straight, you will see another famous restaurant on your right naming "fish fish" there is a lane exactly opposite to that restaurant take that go straight for 5 min minutes you will cross the telephone exchange and there you are. 

its a small, timid, classy restaurant, We chose the buffet which was reasonable. the waiters were definitely courteous. the menu as follows- for the starter- fulko luchi and begun bhaja( yes the luchi was indeed fulko and hot), the rice, daal,chachra,dhoka dalna, parshe macher jhaal( brilliantly made),chicken, mutton kosha(not that authentic taste), doi,mishti,papod.

 A heavy lunch indeed. But the point is we get to eat this daily at our household and who can be a better chef than a mother? so for a change yeah one can go and eat beside that there is no point in havinging lunch here we have all tasted it before at our home.

Celebrating a special day requires a special restaurant...! And thank God, we chose 6 Ballygunge Place. Reserved a table beforehand, and therefore, didn't have to wait for too long to get to our seats.

Thanks to Zomato once again, the menu was already planned out and we wasted no time in ordering our picks. Let's dive straight into it, shall we?

31 Beckbagan Road & 38/2 Elgin Road: Two drinks named after two famous landmarks of Kolkata (in fact all their drinks are), they were such a lovely treat. Most restaurants mess up the drinks while mixing two or more flavors. Thankfully, the flavors here were kept at bare minimum, and the cherry on top.. er... floating I mean... made it even more appealing.

Gondhoraj Chicken: Succulent chicken strips flavored with the juice of Bengal's very own 'gondhoraj' lemon. It goes without saying that a mixture like this is a winner from the onset. The quantity was "neither too less, nor too much" as a starter for 2 people. Ah, and the smell!!!

Ellish Paturi: Wow... just wow!! This one is definitely my pick of the lot. It was my first ellish this season, and boy did it taste divine! While most Bengali restaurants serves a single fillet, 6 Ballygunge Place actually serves two... thus justifying the price as well as sparing us the pain of dividing the beauty into two halves. This is a must-try dish if you're at this joint; I promise you won't be disappointed.

Bhapa Bhetki: Cooked in yogurt with minimal spices, the bhetki tasted a little bland. But just a little though! Maybe because I'm not used to a main course that is on the sweeter side. However, there were two pieces served again, and that was reason enough to make us gobble the well-cooked fillets as fast as we could.

Daab Chingri: One of the signature dishes of this restaurant, well-sized prawns cooked in coconut water and malai is beyond a shadow of a doubt another stunner and a must-have item. I had a taste of this exquisite dish long back at a different restaurant. This one here is in no way inferior!

Oh yes, there was plain rice too. Duh!!

The sole reason to deduct 0.5 points is because there isn't an option of ordering a half plate of rice. I believe that every Bengali restaurant must offer its customers this option. Sometimes, all one needs is a half plate of rice to share in order to fill the tummy to the perfect amount. A second serving of a full plate is simply impossible to finish for two people. Please consider this request and try to implement this small inclusion into the menu. The rest is PERFECT!

Ambience: This outlet is the original one, where a small house has been converted to a restaurant. Hence you get that homely feeling when you have your food, sitting on small dinner tables. The place is nicely done and you will really enjoy the food.

Service: Service is prompt, enough people from the management around to help you out. And yes you don't have to wait much for your food to arrive. 

Food: Again so much to choose from:

1. Hamsher Dimer Devil: A meat-lovers dream, it has duck eggs covered in minced meat covered by crispy Fried crumbs. Talk about inception of food. 

2. Chingrir Kabiraji - Minced prawn coated with a net of egg batter. Crispy and yet so soft on the inside, it is absolutely delicious. 

3. Doi Murgi - A very, light  nice preparation of chicken in curd. Perfect after a dose of heavy snacks. 

4. Chingrir Pulao - It is a brilliant preparation full of aroma and delicious chunks of prawns.

Verdict: I feel this was the best Bengali I had, I really liked the preparation and the quantity. All the outlets will not disappoint on any front but eating at the original place has charm of its own.

one of the best places in kolkata to relish bengali delicacies in a buffet. Had been there on a weekday for their buffet.Excellent variety in veg and non veg. Luchi,begun bhaja served on the table. Sorshe parshe,mutton dakbunglow were the highlights.Staff are very friendly n cheerful as always. A must try place. Beatiful ambience and a family setup...will definitely visit again.

Been a regular to this place since day one( also cause close to my house :-)  )  .. . most enjoyable if you go and eat there. .. They try to make you feel as comfortable while servicing tables ... Food is a good balance between authentic Bengali cuisine and restaurant eating ... If one really needs to eat authentic authentic Bengali food ,that's only found in  homes !!! 
 Note - they could try reinventing or adding new dishes to their menu

The food here is marvellous! Try daab chingri here and you will never forget. ilish will be good during the right season. In veg try chanar malai curry, very good. In fact all dishes are lovely and lip-smacking. This is one place i have been visiting every pujo everyday for their exhaustive buffet menus. 5 on 5 is what they deserve but a .5 less for the walls which i found aweful stained withs. If we do not compromise with price, i will not compromise with the eating environment. Please paint/whitwash the walls asap. Otherwise the ambience is spoilt.

The title flavours of Bengal is just the exact tag line. To taste bengali food this is the right destination. I have heard this name from many but never had a chance to visit this place. Atlast the monsoon arrived and  the cool weather made my mood to say yes to visit this place. The buffet was just mind blowing. Bhat da,l luchi ,begun bhaja,  dhokar dalna,  tangra mach, chingri pach torkari, chicken,  mutton dak banglow , chutney,  papad , misti doi and last but not the least chanar malpoa.. Ever food was rightly cooked and i love the taste of chingri preparation and mutton.. Bhat dal and begun bhaja just made me feel  at home. Instrumental rabindra sangeet at the background made the mood romantic. The decor had aristocracy look. Well maintained staff and polite behaviour.. In other words courtesy well maintained. I love to visit this place again for yummy,  delicious food.

We went for buffet meal which included luchi, begunbhaja, alu dum,  dhokar dalna, sadha bhaat, sakh bhaja, daal,  chorchori, parse maach, chicken chittagong, mutton dugbunglow,  aam er chatni,  papad, doi and hot gulabjamun.  Adequate quantity and nice service also within budget. Will be happy to visit again.

Would have given 5 as a first time visitor but there was a slight problem in the end .
Loved the Baithak . As it was raining and having a kid along, you need this type of waiting lounge . It lacks in many good restaurants. Had taken up the lunch buffet and the taste of all dishes were very good . We ordered separated Sorse Ilish which was also delicious .The desserts(though not my favorite part) were mouth watering , especially the baked mihidana , heavenly.
2 things which made us dissatisfied were the cheque came very very late from the time we had requested and kid's buffet charged at Rs 425 where a 6 year old kid can't even eat one thing(acc to her age, most of the dishes were spicy ). She had just white rice and little mourala fish fry.The amount we paid for the kid buffet was not at all worth the price.
Otherwise, I am ok to revisit again though the waiting period on a Saturday was long(50 minutes)

Went their on Father's Day with family.On arriving we were politely informed that the minimum waiting time was 1 hr and was asked to wait in their '' Baithak '' meanwhile.
the air conditioner in the waiting area was not working properly, or they were intentionally switching off the AC from time to time to save electricity.After waiting for around 1hr 15 min our name was called off like a lucky draw winner with all the equally frustrated guest envying us.on entering the dining area we were made to sit in a table of six in spite of other four seater arrangements being empty. Fail to understand the reason behind the whole hush hush about seat availability.Nonetheless we waited patiently for someone to take the order but everyone was busy rushing to and fro. Finally I have to literally plead the nearest waiter to take the order as we were already running late.
Order placed, we continued waiting for it while someone unceremoniously dumped a bottle of hand sanitizer on our table.Reminded me somewhat of my hostel days.We had ordered fish fry as starter but it was served to us after luchi and dhonepata lanka chicken.Missed the whole purpose I guess.The food was unique, though the mangsher puloa was a tad bit greasy for my liking.We ended our meal with the nolen gurer ice cream which was really the show stealer.
Overall the food got five thumbs from my side but the management need to be careful about the other aspects if they wish to maintain their goodwill.

I am leaving for Singapore and Australia tonight.So on a busy working day wanted my fill of bong food since I'll be away for some time.And 6 Ballygunge Place it was.
This place is a trendsetter in many ways.I have been one of their earliest clients and know the owners personally.When they started,they were one of a kind restaurant.And they showed immense guts in remodelling the ground floor in an upmarket residential neighbourhood,one of the first to do so.Their menu was an eclectic mix of Calcutta food and most importantly their food was good to taste.
I went for the buffet and a veritable feast it was.Luchi,begunbhaja,dal,sada bharat,Rui kalia,Doi Chicken,Mutton curry,followed by Doi and mishti.Oh I forgot to mention the paper and chutney.For the uninitiated I had spicy fish curry,chicken with yogurt,and mutton curry with rice and followed by desserts.
Everything was uniformly good,the quality was excellent and the service adequate.On a weekday afternoon,all the tables were occupied and as a budding restaurenteur it warms the cockles of my heart.Keep up the good work guys....

A very relaxed place. Had the charm Kolkata promises. It's just that even after having tried most Bengali dishes like meat/ macchh... I'm apparently not blown away because I'm no connoisseur of bong food. But the decor, warmth of the culture and service might have me give it another shot.

Went there with huge expectations and was disappointed. I have tried their speciality dishes, like the dab chingri, bhapa eilish and mangsho kosha and have not found them to be anything to write home about. However, on a brighter note, some of the starters here are really good, like the "bengali fish fry", "fish kabiraji" and "chittagong pomfret fry". So in case you do plan to visit this place, please don't skip the starters! And oh the desserts too!!

PS: my Mom cooks some really mouthwatering bengali dishes, so I could have been a little too critical about their food! :D

This place is super famous for Bengali food, so much so that even my Bengali friends approve of it. Expect long waits during festive seasons (like the Durga Puja period in Kolkata). This place is reeeeealllly popular.

I finally had the chance to eat there on a Saturday afternoon. There's a buffet and an ala carte menu. Go for the latter as it has much more variety to offer. If you're not familiar with Bengali food ask your waiter to make you some recommendations.

I tried the Galda Chingri Chimney Kabab (Giant Prawns cooked in a semi spicy onion based gravy), Bhetki Paturi (Local fish cooked in mustard) and Gondhoraj Chicken (pan fried chicken with a local lime flavour)

The prawns and fish lived up to their reputation, though I could have done with less of mustard on the latter. The chicken wasn't spectacular and is something you can avoid.

This place is definitely more authentic than the celebrated Oh Calcutta franchise (which is great too), and doesn't burn a hole in your pocket.

Celebrated my sister's birthday at the main branch this year. 

A nice selection of mocktails named after roads of Kolkata greeted us. The starters are undoubtedly one of the best in the city - the gondhoraj chicken and specially prepared prawns being simply awesome. We were lucky to be there when the 'pithe' festival was going on and the milk sweets are blissful delicacies for dessert. 

A must-visit joint for people yearning for something truly Bengali.

We had gone to 6 Ballygunge Place last Sunday, and I can summarise the experience thus: top-class Bengali food, wonderful ambiance (cheerful interiors, instrumental Rabindrasangeet playing in the background), top-notch service (the waiters kept serving small portions at a time and kept coming back to offer us more, they were attentive and courteous). Now for the food; we had luchi, chholar daal, pulao, dhokar dalna, bhetki paaturi, chitol maacher muiththa, daab-chingri, shutki maach, and nolen gurer ice cream. I am not a shutki maach lover so I cannot comment on the quality of that item. However, everything else was pretty amazing, and my favourite was the ice cream (I blame my humongous sweet tooth for this bias towards desserts in general). The dishes were light and healthy too, with minimum oil and spices. I'd say it's an ideal place to take someone from outside Bengal for a meal, as well as us Bengali food lovers who want a change from homemade food.

It feels good to sit and have at 6 Ballygunge place.. I mean this restaurant is there in bangalore and other outlets also.. And i feel good having food in the original place. In Bangalore many people had asked me why the name is 6 ballygunge place? Or is it just a fancy name? Well... We all know the answers. Coming to the food factor and ambience i love this place. One must try here at least once.

A good place to savour Bangla food delicacy. You are spoilt with choice for starters range from Aalu-Chop , Peyanji , Mochar chop etc to Chingri r kobiraji , Topshe maach bhaja , Mourola maach er peyanji etc with Aamporar Shorbot. 

On to main course with shukto , mochar ghonto , moog monohor daal , chhanar dalna with steam rice...(drool).

Daab Chingri & Bhetki Paturi , Chital Maach er Muitha leaves you wanting for more , need extra "storage space" for Kosha Mangsho with Badshahi Pulao....

Chhanar Payesh & Baked Sandesh tells you that there are many more items left to be explored on further visits !!!!!

Highly recommended for a family get-together over lunch.

Excited by the hype about 6 Ballygunje Palace, I planned a lunch there with my colleagues. We are a group of 5 and opted for Thali. We have offered a table at the ground floor just in front of the entrance  itself and I felt the ambiance not so much appealing. I do not have any idea about the other floors. The quantity of the food is quite satisfactory. The quality is OK, nothing special. The most awful experience is about the service. There is only one person is there who is attending us and also attending some other table on any upper floor. After every 2 or 3 minutes he use to disappear and we had to wait till he comes back. We had to ask for dessert twice before it appears on our table but the bill was presented even before the soiled plates are taken care off.  May be they are facing a staff shortage for that time period. Whatever, I would definitely like to go back again to taste their Daab Chingri & Nolen Gurer Sandesh and will expect a better service that time...

Had been recommended to visit 6, Ballygunge Place by many, and after visiting I think I know why. It's a house turned into a restaurant - so the setting is unusual. There are rooms with 3-4 tables of varying seating capacity. The staff is very courteous (a rarity in Kolkata eateries, from whatever little experience I have so far).

We ordered Bengali Fish Fry for starters, Chingrir Pulao , Illish Paturi, Kasha Mansho & Luchis to go along. Between the 3 of us, we were extremely full but couldn't resist dessert. We tried Nolengerur Icecream & some Chanar Payesh in Chocolate shells. 

Did not order the much celebrated Dab-Chingri, saving it for the next visit!

If anyone wants to try authentic bengali cuisine then it is one of the finest restaurants. This year on Poila Baishakh I went there to enjoy a lunch with my family and I was more than happy. Because of the special occasion, there was no a-la-carte, only buffet. It was expensive though, we had to pay 1200 including taxes per head. But the price was worth paying. As the welcome drink they served Aam-pudina sharbat which had an awesome blend of sweet and sour. Then in the main course, basanti pulao was good along with Kumro borir bharta and Mochar dhokar dalna. Among the non veg items, bhetki roll, chingri malaikari was too tasty to be told. The Murshidabadi grilled chicken was also nice. In the desert, there was mishti doi, chanar malpoa and baked mihidana with rabdi. My personal favourite is the last one which was simply out of the world.
In short, we had perfect bengali lunch.

Food lovers are fanatic about the intricacy of different tastes and I think if bongs are blamed to be poetic, the thrust comes from its food :-)
Had been here for lunch with family.
Of all other outlets, the one in ballygunge place itself would be the best. Buffet choice is good though i always would love to go for customized A-la-Carte. Had Deemer Devil as starter this time (have been here countless times), followed by "Daab Chingri" (Prawn in coconut), steamed rice, Shorshe Ilish and "Kosha Mangsho" (Mutton Gravy). What I like the most here is the ambience of a typical bengali "Boithokkhana" (one might feel the seating to be a little congested) and the names in the menu as a description depicting the flavour of old Calcutta charm and especially the name of Mock-tails (do take a loo at the menu).
My Strong recommendation is A-la-carte and not Buffet.
If you are going as a say group of four, I would recommend have few dishes ordered along with the enticing buffet choice. Being there as a couple would give you a tough choice of Buffet or NOT :)

If you love bengali food and wanna  try it out outside your home, then 6 Ballygunge Place is a must-visit restaurant for you, dear!  And before everything else, I want to tell you that Don't go for their Buffet , try out A-la-carte and then only you'll get the opportunity to savor the best dishes over there!

Coming to the food, Dab-Chingri is something you shouldn't miss! This is the most stand-out (and most-famous) dish of this place.. For starter, we ordered Pomfret fry, Gondhoraj chicken.. Pomfret fry was awe-eeee-some! Gondhoraj chicken was okay-ish (compared to other dishes ). For main dish, we had Badsahi polao, Kaju-kismish polao and steamed rice..All of them were equally good in taste! With rice, we took Kosha manghso, Pabdar Jhal and Dab-chingri...among which Dab-chingri and Kosha mangso were out of the world! ( Pabdar jhal also was terrific! )..For dessert, I'd recommend anyone to opt for Nolen Gurer Ice-cream!

Service was good (could be better though), ambiance was also nice, but the food overshadowed everything else! 

Overall, Loved this restaurant! Would love to visit over and over again.

Out of the Bengali food places I had been to across kolkata Mumbai and Bangalore, this would be one of those restaurants which truly values their service (usually Bengalis are not defined as business class and customer service is the least taken care of thing). Food has a good variety and the menu shows their keenness for innovation unlike the typical Bhojohori Manna type overhyped places. "Mourola machher peyaji" is something we never miss to order here. Little overpriced though the next best thing after Oh Calcutta when you crave for some specialty Bengali cuisine.

1st review:
Went here few months back.Ordered fishfry,nicely puffed luchi,peas kachori,mutton kasha,prawn pulao,dhonepata chicken,misti doi,baked pantua,chanar payesh and 'yummy' cholar dal.mutton kasha tastes good but a bit salty.both ambience and service is good.

2nd review:

Revisited 6 ballygunge place yesterday..Ordered galda chingri chiney kebab,dab chingri,elish tel jhal,dab chingri,murgir jhol,doi potol along with steamed rice.chiney kebab is good but not worth of its price.no need to mention about the sumptuous dab chingri.elish piece is very much succulent. but the real show stealer is doipotol which is very very sumptuous .malpua with vanilla and nolengurer icecream made the day.

When it comes to "authentic" Bengali cuisine mostly people visit 6 Ballygunge Place. I have never visited their any other branch so can't really say how the other places are...but this restaurant is situated in an old majestic Bengali house, decor is modest but at par with the theme. I think the best thing about this place is undoubtedly their staff, who not only makes you feel comfortable but  also exudes a very home like charm, as if instead of a restaurant you have come to a very close relatives house! 

We ordered their supremely refreshing "Aam pora shorbot " and their highly recommended "Dab Chingri", steamed rice, moong dal, a portion of aloo bhaja and bhetki macher paturi. Since I don't have prawns I cannot describe the dish but everyone else loved it, the steamed rice with moong dal and aloo bhaja with the bhetki paturi is like a mini carnival for the taste buds, very nice. 
Was way too full to try out their delicious Malpua but I am sure I will go back some time soon for that one!

Both were delicious and the chicken was prepared really well. It was tender and had a delicious scent to it. We ordered some mangsher pulao, elish tele jhale and bhapa pomfret for maincourse. We also ordered the mutton kosha and mutton patla jhol. I must say all the dishes were prepared beautifully and worth a try. Ended our meal with some mishti doi, malpoa and baked rosogolla. All of them were really yummy! Altogether it was a really satisfying meal for me and my family. Definitely would come back for more once i'm back in Kolkata.

It was a pretty good place only if you are a hard core non-vegetarian. Being the only vegetarian in the group , then trust me , you will have a hard time. I was stuck with puri and mix veg sabzi while my friends were munching on the buffet with chicken , mutton and all. The only dish which i liked was the misti doi. That was good. 

Overall , if you are a vegetaran then it is not a place to be. Else you can get authentic bengali food. The rates are pretty steep. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Ambience was very good !

This is a premiere eatery serving delicious bengali cuisine. They serve you authentic bengali delicacies the names of which you don't get to hear at bengali households these days. Conveniently located at the 6, ballygunge place adjacent to Chowman, ballygunge this is one of my fav restaurants in town. This place is not very big but the interiors give you a feel of the old Kolkata. They have a multitude of different bengali preparations which are mouth-watering & are always neatly presented. I love the daab chingri from here which is as delicious as it sounds. The prawns are succulent and melts in the mouth. My other fav dishes include the echorer dalna, ilish and bhetki paturi, doi ilish, lal murgi (which is spicy and delicious), chingri r pulao. But your dining should not end without their legendary nolengurer ice cream and misti doi which are a must-try as you are having an authentic bengali cuisine. The staff is polite and courteous. This is an expensive place and I visit this place only on ocassions. If you're a non-bong you should definitely give this place a shot & even if you're a bong this place will make you relive the old taste of bengali cuisine you have never tasted. Hail Bengal. Hail 6 Ballygunge Place.

This is the best place to go out for an authentic Bengali meal. I cannot begin to point out the specific dishes that one must try. Everything is beautiful. If you are a nostalgic Bengali, you must visit this restaurant. It is expensive nonetheless. The ambience will remind you of Kolkata and the food will make you believe that you are at a Bengali household. This will make you want to dive into the true essence of Bengal.

6 Ballygunge Place is one of my favorites to have Bengali cuisines. It is spaceous and nicely decorated. The service is good too. I have tried both buffet and a la carte here. Buffet is very good ..have a wide range of choice and saves some money. Last time we ordered Bhetki Paturi, Ilish Bhape and Chitol Macher Muithya. The Paturi and Bhape were outstanding, but i didnt like the Muithya as it was a sweet preparation in contrast to the hot spicy preparation I am used to from childhood. Anyways, definitely a place one should visit for a good bengali meal.

This has to be the most authentic outlet of the iconic 6 Ballygunge Place chain. Located exactly at the address as it names, it's a vintage house converted into a fine restaurant. The ambiance holds the key to the brand. The food tastes brilliant and service is as good as it gets. Would love to visit the place again whenever possible. Nothing's there to complain about the restaurant cause there are none.

Being A Bengali by birth I have always had an attraction for proper Bengali Delicacies. I am a big Foodie and always craved for Proper Bengali Food. Finally I found my destination. It was 6th Ballygunge Place that fulfilled my appetite. There has been very few places where I have had proper, tasty and good Bengali cuisine but 6th Ballygunge place served to be on top. Specially the Daab Chingri, various preparations of the Hilsa, The famlus Bengali Thali, luchi, kosha Mangsho, and Obviously to end with a tinge of Chutney, papad and payesh. Though there is nothing new to inform people about this Restaurant I would still tell Bengali Foodies ... visit this place sometime.

It was all started with a ghol ( a curd based drink) and ended with nolen gurer ice-cream. 

One of the best place to have Bengali food in the city. The place was converted to restaurant from a house. The ambiance was really nice.
We took the buffet option as we have find out À la carte option a bit on expensive side.
Coming to food, yes we have enjoyed it fully. From Prawn kabiraji to malai chamcham. Every food item was cooked in optimum level and vetki paturi was as its best. There is no word to compliment the chicken kasha.

Last but the best part was the nolen gurer ice-cream. If you have not tasted this eternal element, then friend, you will feel world will be a more better place when this thing will melt in your mouth.

Authentic Bengali Cuisine served with great hospitality!!!
6BP has been there in my to-visit list for a long time and today, finally got the opportunity to satisfy my taste buds with sumptuous foods.

Location: As the name suggests, Near Ballygunge Stn, located at 6, Ballygunge Place Road.

Ambiance: Very much Bengali style, decorated with wooden chairs and sofa, colorful lights and instrumental Rabindra Sangeet playing background. 3.5/5

Service: The staffs were very prompt in service, courteous, well knowledgeable about the cuisines, Hospitable, and alwayd had Smile on their face. Thumbs UP for the great service. 4.5/5

Menu availability: Anything that you can ask for a Bengali cuisine. The name of the mocktails definitely need a special mention here. From Moira street to 38/2 Elgin road to Gour Mohan Chatterjee street: you will find everything here. 4/5

Food: Now comes the sumptuous, delicious foods. I would say, Every Penny worth It. U relish your taste buds and it feels like, yes, this is what I waited for. We took Chitagang Pomfret fry as starter. It was mouth watering and could very well give the elementary idea of what's waiting for us. Aamporar shorbot was also very good.
For main course, we had steamed rice, Pur bhora doi potol, navratna Paturi, Bhetki paturi, Daab Chingri, Doi Ilish, Kanchalonka Dhonepata Murgi. Pur bhora doi potol: every bit worth it. Navratna paturi was well cooked, served on banana leaf, but could have been better if it has a little more flavor of Sorshe (mustard). No adjectives could suffice the yummilicious Daab chingri. It indeed was a heavenly treat for me. Doi Ilish was Okay. Bhetki paturi has a very strong and rich flavor of sorshe. Well, the chicken dish disappointed me a bit, the chicken was not so tender and it could be little more spicy.
For the dessert, we took Nolengurer Ice cream. It was truly the SHOWSTOPPER. Every spoon was soooooo mouth watering that my heart longed for more, but my stomach couldn't afford it. 4/5

Overall, A Pleasant, Delicious, sumptuous Gastronomic treat it Was!!! Did I miss any adjectives for their food? Well, may be... For now, I'm again thinking of the dishes and their smell... aaahhh!!! Life is Worth while eating!!! :)

Bengali decor, Bengali food. Feels like you're in for a Bengali wedding treat at your neighbors'. Quite uniquely, the beverages are named after the residence addresses of great Bengali men. Names of other dishes are long and Bengali, but comprehensible. Seafood's cooked in Bengali mustard oil and is pretty good, especially the Malai curry prawn. Vegetarian is good too, quite unexpectedly, albeit a little greasy. Musur Dal Churchuri or Roast Phulgobhi with Radhaballabi or Karaishutir Kachori might be a little too sumptuous but totally worth it. Do try out the Butter milk there (very complex name). The portion is pretty small but pretty good.

I took a friend out to lunch at this place and tried the buffet. Found the food extremely good so much so that I concentrated only on my favourite dishes like tangrar jhaal, maachher maatha diye puinshaak, manshor jhol (the typically Bengali paatla variety) etc. The spread was good and I would have liked to try my other favourite dishes like dhokar dalna, Bangladeshi chicken, daal et al but decided to save space for chaatni and desserts. I must say I was not disappointed. The mishti doi was particularly good. It was not too sweet as Baanchharam, Mishtimukh etc places tend to make it but had a lingering slightly sour taste to it. The bhaapa sondesh was similarly superb. Again, it was sweetened just right and not in an overpowering manner. The ambiance was good though the place needs to do something to augment its washroom facility. There was always a frighteningly long queue of people wanting to use it. The waiters were attentive and very well behaved. I would most certainly like to revisit it on my next trip to Kolkata.

Well this is a place is the best place if your'e taste buds are dying to taste some authentic bengali dishes when you have lived outside kolkata for a very long time.The first thing you do after coming to Kolkata is taste Bengali food and what better place than 6th Ballygunge .Went out on a family dinner .Food was great , everyone loved it .The staff is very friendly and service is pretty quick and they took a family photo for us also! The standout was the Daab chingri,Doi ilish,Badshahi pulao and Ampora shorbot is a must ! The only thing is the price is on the higher side but still when you get such great food you don't mind spending some extra bucks .

It was a mid winter Sunday afternoon, when we were to host one of the post-marriage ceremonies and then someone suggested 6ballygunge place. From the services to their preparation,every bite brings you satisfaction. The ingredients dwell deep in the taste of Bengal and the consequent compensation leaves you with value for money. They host a separate room for private gatherings which they call the "baithak" wherein the walls hosts photo pin ups extracted from the streets of the very elegant city. The Daab chingri, bhappa Hilsa in mustard sauce, the crab chilly, and kassa mangsho with loochi provides you with the perfect synergy of a family dinner. The gudd ice cream and the baked pantua is the right way to end your Bengali delight. This place keeps up the promise of the city and brings you joy with its melancholic preparations blended in the perfect rhythm of your hunger gliding gracefully through your salivating tatsebuds.

Bengali cuisine heaven i can say , from where to start not getting the words but food on top, no complaints , authentic food with flavours , varieities and lots more . In my buffet lunch dream dish was sarson da murg , served in parted rooms over there . This  place is suggested by discovery channel also for good food . Foodlovers dont miss this place if u r in kolkatta . Thxs to the one for that taste still on my tounge whenver i reminds of 6 ballugunge .

If you ask "Where to get Bengali cuisine?" in Kolkata, then you are none other than a fool or an outsider. But if you ask "Where to get Authentic Bengali food with elegant ambiance and service?" then definitely you leave the answerer with very few options in mind! And of course, "6 Ballygunge Place" must be in this list, authentic food with elegance!

Ballygunge always seemed very fascinating to me for its establishment type and the environment. This joint is located none other than in a typical Ballygunge House. The interior is very eye-catching, walls full of different paintings, nicely decorated tables and chairs, vintage lights and fans. The seats are inside different small rooms, but not at all clumsy.

I have been to this outlet once, on a day of my friend's b'day, one of the day on which a typical bong wants to have a full course Bengali lunch. We ordered plain rice with mung mohon dal, Jhur jhure aloo bhaja, Rui macher jhol and Doi sorshe pomfret. All the items were delicious, simply awesome! :) I liked the pomfret most. And how come a Bengali not have 'Payesh' on his/her birthday!!?? So we decided to order Chhanar Payesh with choco shells as dessert. It was great as well!! Very different in taste from any traditional payesh, but marvelous to end a great lunch with.

No objection with the service, the waiters were prompt, efficient and courteous. Cost is a bit higher if you compare with other places, but worth every penny according to the quality, ambiance and service.

Final verdict :
Food - 4
Service - 4
Ambiance - 3.5
Value for money - 3.5

Dab chingri, a dish cooked inside the tender coconut, bhetki which is a fish in mustard gravy have made us go in #foodcoma! And there's no worries for the veggie buddies... Karaishutir kachori which a puri with green peas stuffing, have it with bhaja masala aalu dum... And to top it up fervour sweet tooth is the mishti doi at its best! And and and... The colonial style British raj ambience with friendly staff just ensures that you enjoy every bite!

I'd say this is one the best places to have Bengali food. On visiting the restaurant on a weekend, I was first disappointed by the long queue but I and friends decided to wait. Well, after the wait was over we were taken inside and was left unnoticed for almost 15 minutes. Then we were given the menu card. The ambience and the setting of the restaurant was just awesome. Then the food came. We had ordered fish fry, kosha magsho(mutton curry) and kaju kismis pulao. Each one of them were mind blowing especially the mutton( which was extremely tender and just melted in mouth). For desserts we had baked Sandesh and baked pantua. The Sandesh was not so impressive but the pantua was.
Now the points:
Ambience:4/5
Food: 5/5
Service: 2/5
Overall: 3.5/5

Kolkata edges out Delhi in terms of the comfort food the former provides which is so rich in taste and low in pocket that you wonder why the city is not referred to as the food capital of India. 6 Ballygunj place is testimonial to this. A visit to 6 Ballygunj Place cannot be short of drama as one may miss locating the restaurant which looks like any other standalone bonedi bari, found aplenty in that area. I went with my parents to enjoy a meal and what we got was wonderful memory of a evening which will remain alive with us forever. Only because of the food! For starters we ordered mochar chops, which, served with fresh mustard sauce (kasundi), were so crispy and crunchy that you will yearn for more. Next up was luchi with cholar dal. Heavenly! Very light and puffed luchis were served with perhaps the greatest cholar dal I ever tasted. The items were very fresh and well cooked. Next we ordered kosha mangsho, murgir jhol, rice and aloo bhaja. The Kosha mangsho could have been a bit better but was tasty nonetheless. The mutton appeared to be a bit undercooked but that was it. The chicken curry, i.e murgir jhol, was a show stopper and very, very well cooked and tasty. The dish was not at all spicy and tasted just perfect to compliment plain rice. Aloo bhaja was good too but nothing special about it. I had  a 38/2, Elgin Road which was extremely refreshing without being fizzy. The ambiance was great with Bengali instrumental music complimenting the Bengali food. The evening was made perfect by all this and we had a great time. The behaviour of the stuff was very cordial and helpful. I would definitely visit the place again and would congratulate the management of this place for maintaining the standard of this place so high.

So we wanted to throw a farewell lunch for our colleague who was retiring. We went on a Tuesday. Was amazed to see the place was quite packed. However, we had made prior reservations so we got a nice table for the 14 of us girls.
We had the buffet. Honestly, I'm not a fan of Bengali food.
But the Parshey was great, so was the chocchori. The mangsho was just average.
The Malpua was too sweet but still likeable.
What the place took onus for was the service they provided. It was really commendable.
Overall, we left the place happy and with a heavy stomach.

A visit to 6 Ballygunge Place had pending over a past few trips. This weekend presented us with an opportunity. They stated that weekend lunches are not based on reservations and walk-in was alright starting 1230. The first table for two that we were shown was in elbow-jostling mode with the next table for two. We moved to another table. Curiously, they claim that there's no reservation available for weekend and immediately asked us to shift from the table we selected citing "it is reserved". No signage was put for the reservation though.

The menu walks the 'safe, standard and easy' fare that is becoming the de-facto "Bengali Restaurant" menu across various cities. Given the heft of reputation this place has, expecting a bit of daring and experimentation would have been not far off the mark. However, that wasn't to be.

We selected Chingrir Kabiraji and Pantharas as the starters to be followed by Kanchalonka Dhoneypata Diye Murghi with Kaju Kismis Pulao. The 2/6 Biren Roy Road (mocktail) was also ordered. The best thing to say about the food is that we weren't deeply put off. The items were adequately prepared and devastatingly poorly presented. All of the selected items are stock - you cannot really make a terrible choice with that combination. I wouldn't recommend the mocktail - it is a poor blend of taste and something that shouldn't make it to the list of any decent place.

The staff need more training and in double quick time. They have no idea about how to present plates on the table - cutlery and crockery were askew terribly placed around. For obvious reasons a table for 14 (next one) received more attention than a table for 2 (ours) - glasses were empty and in need for a refill through an entire course. The worst part is the poor table manners. A table for 2 is often a tight fit for an order. In our case, the staff member decided that putting the entire dish of mustard relish on my side plate was the best way to make place for more stuff. This action was repeated when the bowl of pulao went up on the side plate again. I've never seen such shoddy handling of dishes and deciding on how to handle a table layout without even asking a guest whether it was good idea.

The acoustics of the place don't lend themselves to a notion of privacy and conversation. Especially if you end up next to a large group. The separation between tables is around 2.5 feet at best and in inches at worst (the first table we were shown to was separated from the next one by less than 12 inches). Unless you really do want to check out "Bengali" food at a somewhat decent (but not value-for-money) prices, don't opt for this place.

After much failed encounters, finally made it to 6BP that too on Republic Day. They had a special menu only for that day comprising of luchi, beguni, rice, dal, grilled bhetki, chicken, chingri maach, mutton, chatni, roshogolla, patishapta etcetera. The reason for my etcetera is due to the fact there were too many items and frankly its not humanely possible to have them all and not puke. What overwhelmed me with quantity, disappointed me with quality. There were many items which tasted so very bland. Other than that there are no negatives. The staff very friendly, foods fresh and environment very pleasing.

Saw this ad on epaper of Telegraph, one day before flying to Calcutta. Was there on the beginning of 01 Jan and there was a platter festival. My mind had one thing the bhapa bhetki fish or chingri malai curry.

With these expectations i always wanted to try out and beleive me I was not disappointed They have valet. Voila!! Great!!
Liked the ambience. Its soft lighted. Soothing. Seating is very comfortable.

The main course was a hoggers delight with perfectly batter fried Crab Cutlet
 They had the starter Lebu sorbet ghol , then Crab cutlet the crab cutlet was softly battered and was cooked to perfection then mochar chop. Hot Koraisutir (green pea) kachuri with mix veg(Tok jhaal siter sobzi), daal pancharatni and Dhonepata alu dum . The Dhonepata alur dum was suberb minty flavor and was good getalong with kachuris....

Now in Non-Veg Section :

Bhuna Galda Chingri----This was a bit disappointment 1/3 since it was not cooked
properly
Doi Murgi --- Succulent peices of chicken in curd 3/3
Railway Mutton  Curry - The same bengali favorite nicely cooked but I will give 2/3 since Oh Calcutta has better version of the same
Bhetki Paturi --- The show stealer ...Tenderly steamed fish cooked into soft and juicy  intact 3/3

In desserts : 2/3 since the season was of patali gur and they didnt do any of the same

Baked Mihi |Dana : 2/3 healthy concept and less sweet

It is one of the best restaurants serving Bengali food in town. Though for Bengalis home cooked food (by mothers, of course) always tastes best, 6 Ballygunge Place has never disappointed me. My personal faves would be: 1. Chitol macher muittha
2. Chingrir Malai Curry 
3. Shutki Mach.
A MUST VISIT.

It was a weekday afternoon.A couple of friends of mine and I were very hungry and we decided we had to have a buffet somewhere.Looking at the probable options we chose this place because we felt a buffet lunch at around 500 bucks all inclusive was a pretty good deal considering the fact that the buffet prices have gone up quite a bit of late at most places.We ended up experiencing a good deal no doubt but it was certainly nothing special.

Coming to the food,the buffet spread comprised of plain rice,dal,alo-fulkopir torkari,alor dum,luchi,begun bhaja,sorshe diye parshe mach,chicken er jhol and mutto curry.The dal with vegetables was pretty good and they provided gondhoraj lebu along with the dal which I really liked.The luchis and begun bhajas were served hot and in the table itself.The alo dum and the aloo fulkopir torkari were okayish.The sorshe diye parshe mach was nice.The quality of the fish was good.The chicken was absolutely horrible.The curry was dilute and tasteless.The chicken itself was a bit under cooked.The mutton was decent.The curry was not the tastiest but the mutton was well cooked,soft and tender.For desserts,they had chutney,papad,chanar malpoa,mishti doi.The dessert section was pretty good.The chanar malpoa especially deserved a special mention.

I feel any buffet is incomplete without an ice cream and we did feel the lack of it.An ice cream should have been there.Also,when you are having a buffet you do not expect exceptional quality but I felt there should have been one or two items that should have stood out.Though the fish was nice,apart from the chanar malpoa nothing really stood out.But then overall we were more or less satisfied with our meal.The spread we felt was decent specially considering the price.

I have also had the a la carte here before and that is surely a better option in terms of quality though a little more hefty price wise.But if you are looking to eat a lot at moderate prices the buffet here is a good deal.

The ambience is minimalistic.It is basically the ground floor of a residential building converted into a restaurant and hence there are about 3 separate connected rooms instead of a proper single space.This is undoubtedly one of the more popular places and hence even on a weekday afternoon it was full.The place can get congested at times.But the staff are nice and friendly and do a good job at looking after the customers.

Overall 6 ballygunge place is one of the better options if you are looking for a Bengali meal and the buffet here though not exceptional is one of the most economical value for money deals that you would find if you are in the mood to eat and taste a lot!

I took my children aged 11 and 8 and my third child who I was carrying at the time, four years ago to treat them to some poush parbon pithes and pulis. The decor is quite good and imaginative. The food, while good, was very little and a little show-offy, which means if one has foreign visitors with them, one is accorded more attentive service but not when you are Bengali and obviously a Calcuttan (although visiting after four years abroad and three years in other states on India)! So we ordered all that were on offer in the special puli-pithe festival menu (patisapta, roshbora, dudhpuli, khirpuli) apart from chholar dal, alur dom and luchi, a chicken prep and bhaat. My main aim was to introduce my kids to some solid Bengali taste. While they found the ambiance mildly intriguing the food wasn't great and the quantity quite disappointing. I did like the funky names given to their mocktails and enjoyed the Bishop Lefroy one immensely! We plan to go back for this year's poush parbon and I shall report back if there is any change to our experience of four years back!

Nice place for great bengali food. I love their Chngrir Kabiraji, Paturi and fish items. The ambiance is good and staffs are co operative. It's always recommended to try the Thali as you can experience a number of varieties at one go! However, if you are someone like me who wants a special treat, go for the A La Carte menu and choose the ones you like best. 
Last time I went there, ordered for Chital macher Muithyya along with some other delicacies. I would proudly say that my mom makes it better than them, not because she is a pro but she knows how to make it more delicious. I am highly disappointed as the filings had lots of green chillies and less of fish. Also, the shapes are quite small in size and it was not soft as it should be.

I love their Luchi Mangsho and it's a must try. 

However, if you are in Kolkata and want to try some mouth watering bengali food then this is a great option.

The location is good. Plenty of parking space nearby. Nice cosy minimalistic ambience. It is created out of the ground floor of a big vintage house and so the interiors are mainly an aggregation of small rooms instead of one large open space. I liked the attractive and comfortable enclosure outside the main building as a waiting area for guests in queue. The staff are friendly, prompt and smiling. Quality of service is good. One gesture of theirs that I loved was providing a hand sanitizer at each table when you take your seat. Bengali cuisine needs to be eaten by hand and such a caring gesture of providing you the facility to wash your hands right at your table. The food has much scope for improvement though. Special mention goes to the gigantic and delicious Bhetki Paturi and the Crab cutlet. I have only tried the buffet menu on New Year's Day 2015 and was not impressed by the quality of chicken and mutton dishes. Lack of freshness of the food was also an issue. I shall comment more after trying their a la carte menu some day.

Overall verdict:
Location: 4/5
Ambience: 4/5
Staff: 3/5
Service: 4/5
Food: 2/5

So when ever you are back to kolkata and you are craving for bengali food then this is the place to come and visit. Food is not at all cheap it is reasonable, Ambiance is fine but the service is quite dull. You can find different types of bengali food here. Sukto, Mutton curry, Prawns are one of the best here.

Whenever my heart craves for having some true Bengali food...its surely one of the restaurants which comes in my mind...though its not the best Bengali cuisise I have had in this city..but its above average..
1.Ambience - thikthak
2.Reception and servicr - also thikthak
3.Food-not the best Bengali cuisine in the city but you can go for it without lamenting after having it.
4.Price- not cheap but reasonable.
Final verdict-being a bagalee you can.go for it without hesitation.I can assure you that you will not repent after that..

A nice to place to visit with family for a quiet outing… Well everyone knows that this place is one of the few where you get authentic Bengali cuisine with the “price is right” quotient added to it. It is recommended that reservations should be made for  a Sunday as it can get very crowded. They have a policy that lunch reservations can be made at two time slots: either 12:45 pm or 2:45 pm; not in between.

The staffs were courteous. They were very attentive towards us. 

The decorum is very sober , soothing. They also consider hygiene issues with great care.

Now the food….. one word: AWESOME!! 

We ordered three mocktails: 38/2 Elgin Road, 24, Ashwini Dutta Road, Gandhoraj Ghol ..  Though I must say these could have been better. Did not impress me that much.

Starters: Fish Kabiraji, Bengali Fish Fry.. kabiraji was awesome..  fry was above average.

Main course:  Moog Mohan, Aloo vaja, Badshahi Pulao, Eilish Paturi (Boneless),Pabdar jhal, Kachalanka Dhonepata Murgi, Kosha Mangsho..

the boneless eilish was a first try for me.. really liked it! The mutton was a tad bit undercooked, hardly an issue though. The “Kachlanka Dhonepata Murgi” deserves a special mention!!! Don’t go for the looks, this green curry can turn into fireworks of joy inside the mouth! Brilliantly prepared.

This was a good experience. Will come back again soon!!

Must try dish: Kachalanka Dhonepata Murgi ! (you’ll thank me)

Easily my favorite place for Bengali food. I have lost count on how many occassions I have dined alone in this restaurant only to ensure that I enjoy the company of food alone. Yes, You have to sit back and relish every drop of the Jhinga malai curry to understand why this is not comparable to most other restaurants  which claim to serve authentic Bengali food. Big Thumbs Up from me!

Though I would prefer having bengali food cooked by my mom rather than dine in any of the restaurants here. But at times when I have to take my father out for lunch or feel like having bhaat mach and murgi outside I would stop by here. This place is homely and very calm. Its more like eating at somebody's home. Food is light yet tasty. I like the dhania chicken, shukto, narkel daal and alubhaja a lot. Kosha mangho is good too. My father's favorite is the chanar dalna. Food is always served fresh and the desserts are satisfactory. But I have complains regarding the quantity of food. Its really less. If you are two, ordering one plate of anything won't suffice. And ordering two might be extra sometimes.

First time visited this place on a Tuesday. Was empty at the beginning but ended up to get pretty crowded toward our departure. Waiters were cordial, service time was not bad, food tasted good. Loved the baked sandesh which was not revoltingly sweet. Personally I feel that the variations of the puris are not so fascinating. Prices are a bit on the higher side compared to the portion size, but not crazily expensive. Best part is ample parking space and easy accessibility. Will visit again on special occasions.

My favourite place to have Bengali food. Been going here since ages and in each visit the food becomes tastier. Try their one of a kind mocktail flavours with a Bengali twist. Plus the names of the drinks are also so very Kolkata. I love the gondhoraj chicken, the paturi dishes, coriander and green  chilli chicken and baked sandesh in dessert. The other dishes are amazing as well. Do try 6 ballygunge place and if you have guests take them to try their authentic Bengali cuisine. I definitely recommend it.

Good food and service. Wanted to try some authentic bengali, so landed at this place for lunch. Had the fish fry, prawn fingers and koberaji fish - all fried and delicious. Dab chingri and fish mustard curry were great. Didn't like the mutton (kosha mangscho) though. Don't try mocktails here. We tried a few snd sent two back but to their credit, they replaced them with another drink without asking.

I was visiting my family in kolkata and was here with my family, my aunt, cousin and his new bride. The ambiance was good enough. What disappointed me a tad was the food though... I mean the gondhoraj chicken and fried prawn were alright. However my grandma maybe spoiled me with her delicious food, since I didn't find any of the main course dishes anything home to write about. They were ok. Not great. Not bad. Will probably not visit this place again since I have access to better food elsewhere in kolkata.

Being a bengalee we don't go to a Bengali restaurant very often. However we, group of two, dropped by in a hot summer. We had buffet lunch with a A-La-Carte starter. We loved the buffet with "Luchi"-s served hot. Mutton(Pathar jhol) and "Dhokar Dalna" was good. However I did not find it to be very excited. Also its a costly one. I would recommend a 50:50 for this restaurant.

Whenever I go to this awesome place to eat I get full satisfaction. The place is awesome for the typical Bengali dishes. If you miss those Bengali delicacies then this is the perfect place. The restaurant will wow you will its superb Bengali items. Also the place offers various snacks and chops. Also there are veg items. I ordered chingrir kabiraji which mince prawn cutlet fried with an egg net butter. Also I had topshe mach bhaja. The crunchy taste is simply appetizing. This is butter fried mango fish; both the items are simply yummy. Then I had chingrir pulao which is rice cooked in prawns. With that I ordered murgir jhol, this home cooked chicken curry is definitely different from your mamma’s chicken curry. We Bengalis love our fishes; any fish item is good for us. So I chose pabdar jhol. Any fish cooked in mustard oil gets an awesome flavour. While looking through the menu I spotted their long and unique list of fish items. We can’t do without our sweets so I ordered chanar malpoa, misti doi. Then came chutney.

Having eaten at most of Kolkata's better known Bengali restaurants, I will have to say that 6 Ballygunge Place is numero uno. Awesome food, friendly and efficient service. Not much more needed. My only suggestion would be the introduction of a 'small' thaali option. The present size can only satisfy the biggest eaters.

This place was on my wishlist for a very long time and finally I made it there last night for dinner. Being a bengali myself, I have a passion for bengali cuisine and I had high expectations from this place. Not to mention that the restaurant did stood up to my expectations and its name. In one word the food was simply Outstanding in terms of quality and quantity.

We started off with fish kabiraji which was cooked to perfection. For main course we had steamed rice, bhetki paturi, eilish bhapa, dab chingri and mutton kosha. Every single dish was finger licking good and did stood apart from other restaurants serving bengali cuisine. I never expected eilish to be that tasty in the month of November. Full marks for it. The mutton was also served in good quantity and the pieces were soft and tender with very tasty gravy. Loved every bite of it.

If anybody is looking around for a nice bengali style meal... this is where you could start.

The best place to try authentic Bengali food. The Ballygunge outlet is actually an old house thus giving the feel like eating homecooked food at home. The Doi Murgi and Daab Chingri are my best dishes here. The Luchi rocks with the Kosha Mangsho too. The Aam pora Sherbet before the start of the meal just clears your palate before you actually dive into the food :D
A wow place :)

My first tryst with Bengali cuisine after coming to Kolkata. As it is I love the food. I've had Oriya food in Bhubaneswar, Bengali food in Bangalore and mammar badi!????  but this was yummy. I went at the time of pujas. So ala carte was off and it was only a buffet. But lovely spread and all you can eat. Try making out early though as the buffet upkeep is never good and after some time the food does not look as appetising.

And the food was just gorgeous!!!! The chef knows how to play with the known flavours and work them up in such a magnificent way! the bhetki patury was soaked in pungent mustard...loved it !....equally nice was the kosha mangsho and pulao duo!
And the icing on the cake was the baked sandesh and gur ice cream!!!!!

This is a restaurant that one must visit while travelling to kolkotta. The buffet should be given a skip. The echor dalna which is jack fruit with a masala gravy is delicious. You actually feel that you are having meat due to the texture and taste. This should be had with rice . The bhetki paturi is boneless fish with a mustard paste wrapped in banana leaf. This also should be had with rice else the mustard really hits you. The prawn preparations are also good. The highlight is eelish bhapa. I prefer the boneless one which is pretty expensive , those that can manage the bones find it delightful . I have only been to the branch close to city center1.

I and my friend visited the "old house turned restaurant" during the Durga Puja and availed the buffet offer. Ambience and service both were equally good and every details were taken good to maintain the traditional Bengali style. We loved each and every item in the buffet from Jeera rice to Rasmalai. All were too tasty with pure bangaliana flavour. But my personal favourite was Chittol Macher Muthiya. I am not a fish-lover as I have to struggle too much with the bones. But the Muthiya was awesome. It was like having "Chittol" (bengali name) fish sausage in mustard gravy (sorsher jhol). The Mutton preparation was also good and spicy. This is the first time we visited and would like to visit often.

6 Ballygunge place a case of classic Bengali food and nostalgia for any probashi did not blind my view that their hard selled chital macher muitha fell flat with the extra spice. But no doubt being a classic place it did come with their brilliant gigantic Radha ballabi and mochar ghonto. Set in an old bungalow the mood is just right for the cuisine to be enjoyed. A definite yes for a visit.

This place serves the most authentic Bengali cuisine. You feel home with the taste of the food and the Tagore piece that plays around. We had gondhoraj ghol which was very refreshing and the must mention is the daab chingri. We could not stop licking our fingers. Finally, for dessert we chose nolen gurer ice cream which is mind blowing. You can feel the granules of sandesh in it.
Super taste! Fine ambience! Worth the price!

6 BALLYGUNJ PLACE

Words fall flat when describing Bengali cuisine as it is one of the most vivid and colorful cuisines we have in India, this place needs no special mention or introduction as 6 ballygunj place has been dishing out authentic Bengali food for quite some time now, this was my first visit to it as I had a hankering for some “Mangsho” and not Chinese style cooking, but some closure to my roots was what I was looking for.

There are many franchises of 6 ballygunj place, but as the name suggests we went to the ballygunj one for lunch as I had my heart set out on their buffet spread, the décor is rustic and soothing, we were politely guided to our table and I could see that all the servers had a smile on their faces, and they were treating the customers as “guests” in the true sense of the word which is reminiscent of our Bengali culture.

The buffet consisted of a plethora of authentic dishes namely “ Dhokar Dalna”, “ Masala Aloo dum”,  “Moong Dal”, “ Macher Matha die badacopi”( Fish head cooked with cabbage), “Parshe mach shorshe”,”Murgi Kasha”( Chicken) ,” Mangshor Jhol” ( Mutton) , Luchi , Begun Bhaja , and the usual Chatni,  doi ,papad and mishit without which no proper Bengali meal is complete, since I had a hankering for mutton I jumped straight into it and it was delicious to the S, it was tender and the meat was falling from the bone and melts in your mouth, the luchi was served piping hot on the table itself along with the beguni , the luchi was fresh and just like your mom would make, the other items say the aloo dum , dhoka dalna were also good , the rice was light and smooth, the chicken was spicy and dangerously delicious in its own way. I didn’t get a chance to try the fish as I was engrossed in the mutton a tad too much, ate to my heart’s content.

The buffet was priced at 425+ tax and the total bill for 2 came at 1015 bucks,  the service was commendable and praiseworthy , and food was gorgeous, when we left , there were two wooden benches in the compound and we took some pics , and the security guard out of his own accord offered to take our picture together, where will u find such hospitability if not in Kolkata..

VERDICT – Must visit, great food equally good service and for those who miss the true Kolkata and its cuisine u have to visit and start living life a bit more.

Couple of weeks back, I flew to Kolkata to meet few of my friends. I landed on September 17, which was Viswakarma day and there were hardly any cabs plying in the city. Next day was worse – there was a total transport strike coupled with rains.
Anyway, relief came as a visit to 6, Ballygunj place, when we visited the place for dinner.
The thali was first rate and I loved the mutton and large prawns in gravy. I also loved the prawns in malai curry which was served in tender coconut and the fish fry.
The ambience was great and so was the service.
Unforgettable experience!

This was on my wishlist for a while and finally got a chance to lunch with family yesterday. Only buffet was there and our group consisted mix of veg and non -veg and so had the opportunity to try all the items on the menu. To start with, the ambience simply bowled us over -just like a traditional bangali baari. The waiter was extremely courteous and guided us to our table which was in a cosy little room. Luchi n begun bhaja were served at the table- the bhaja could do with some mishti flavour though, especially when almost all the items had somewhat sweet flavour. The buffet had rice, moog dal, aloor dum, chapor ghonto, chital machher muithya, dhonepata murgi, mutton, anarash chutney, papad, rajbhog n mishti doi. Additional veg dishes were served at the table - dherosh sorshe, alu fulkopir chochhori, aloo posto n kofta. As i said, posto n kofta were somewhat sweet n chochhori had dominant garlic flavour. However, we enjoyed the chapor ghonto.  The posto could have been more jhaal. But overall I liked the veg dishes. I am told that the mutton melted in the mouth n the chingri tasted delicious. The doi, however, was sour. We enjoyed the meal and the service was excellent. The prices were on the higher side though - 600 for the non-veg n 500 for the veg buffet excl taxes. Compared to bhojohori manna n sholoana bangali, prices are steeper but in terms of availability n variety of veg items, this restaurant won't disappoint bangali vegetarians like yours truly. I'll surely recommend it.

It was a Nabami Lunch, tables were booked, and we reached in time, ready to end the pujo in style.

 

The seating arrangement seemed more of a North Calcutta rajbari family lunch (The place would remind you of a typical Rituparno Ghosh's movie set) with large and small tables neatly set in different rooms . The decor and the lights stayed true to a quintessential Bengali household.

Once settled, we were greeted with Gondhoraj Ghol (served by waiters in traditional outfits) to start off what eventually turned out to be a delicious buffet spread. Gorom luchi (served at regular intervals) , alur dom, lomba begun bhaja , dal , and sounds of drizzles on asbestos outside, had perfectly set the mood.

Followed by fish fry , of the quality every bong would swear by, one would be left to savour a plethora of main course from plain rice (of the finest quality), sahi pulao, panir kofta, chitol macher muithya, golda chingri, chiken kosa, to achari mangsho(Muton, is my personal favourite), it was a journey your taste buds had rarely been on.
 
                      A dedicated waiter for your table is what makes the experience even more cosy, always ready to serve you according to your need, so u don't have to get up everytime.

The desserts from rajbhog, rabri pantua, to mango doi was awesome.
 And just before u leave, there is this pan stall(included in Buffet, that's right) for just the perfect goodbye!

Cost was a tad bit high during pujas(Around 1000 - A.I.), but the experience served was great.

On my wife's birthday I visited this place and Taken Buffet Lunch. Food quality just awesome. 

First they served Gandhoraj Ghol. First time I have tried this and like as well.

Then Sakh bhaja, Luchi and Hot Begun Bhaja. 
After that Prawn Kabiraji just awesome,
Also they have Sada Bhat, Mug Dal, Sukto and AlurDom. 

Now time for another Delicious dish Fish paturi, this one also mind blowing. 

Also on buffet they have Big size Chicken Curry and Mutton Kasa. 
Khejur Amsotto Chatni, Papad and Lord Chom Chom etc..

But I didn't like only Lord Chom Chom.

Good bengali buffet lunch within cost effective price just 475 + Tax.

Suggestion: Please include Crab and Hilsa on buffet.

With durga puja just 2 days away...i am so thrilled to be in kolkata at this time ! Riding in the taxi with my mom, watching the beautiful pandals, we decided to have a pure Bengali cuisine( for the very first time) and the nearest destination was none other than 6, ballygunge place( thanks again, zomato)
We were the first ones to enter the restaurant ( it was 7pm sharp)! 

It seems that restaurant was once a home as the architecture of the place was such! Everything in the restaurant gave a 'pure bengali place' feel! The paintings, durga ma's faces all over the windows,etc! 

Coming to the main component: Food! Well in the appetizers , we had bengali fish fry: amazin bhetki fish with a crisp layer! Marination was done to perfection! Its a must have ! Also, chicken gondhoraj was something with a unique amalgamation of flavours. It was a darling appetizer too! We had mocktails too : ajc bose road with coconut , cream and mint flavour! And a kiwi fruit cooler, which was more of a sprite and a slight flavor of kiwi! It was good enough!
In the mains , we had daab chingri which i always wanted to have, the day i heard about it(a month ago) ! The prawns cooked in mustard and coconut water gravy, is a dish to die for! It lived upto my High expectations! I had it with steamed rice: perfect! 
Posto aalu was again a dish cooked in nearly same gravy but wasnt sweet( as was the chingri ) ! It was just okay! Our next pick was bhapa bhetki: marinated in curd and lemon(i guess) ! This was again a dish to die for! I recommend this too! 
The mains took quite a long time to be served! 
In a nutshell, the punjabi foodie in me will never mind to become a Bong foodie, for this place left all smiles ! 
Neglecting the few follies, because of the amazing food, this place is a BANG ON! scorer from my side!

Simply awesome food. Proper bengali food. The main thing which interested me was that bengali s favourite fish 'sutki mach' was served and not bit smell, tasted like any thing, just can't express in words. More over deserts simply didn't hav any comparison ice cream (nolen gur er), baked sandesh etc etc. And about main course luchi and morich mangso(mutton) was very very well prepared. Again abt starters fried prawn the best I ever had.

Nothing much to write about. This is already tried and tasted restaurant. Very very nice food, not too costly like Oh Calcutta.

Every dishes tasted like homemade food,  was not too rich, not to oily. I had the best postor bora, though the posto(poppy) was less than I expected, they put some coconuts within them which made the taste a bit different than usual. The Ilish paturi was Ok, but the mutton tasted like heaven.

This has become one of my favorite bangla food joint :)

just went yesterday for dinner and I'm overwhelmed. superb decoration (may remind u of #ItachunaRajbari) , instrumental Rabindrasangeet and warm welcoming will surely reduce your allday's stress. firstly we took narkel posto er bora and aam pora sorbot,  both were perfectly made and the first impression was WOOWW! As we were soo busy with our adda and fun that even forgot that drinking water in d table is finished. They noticed and served it (with a smiley face) when came to take order of thr main courses..we ordered a nonveg thali (which contains Ghee, Vat, Luchi, begun bhaja,dal, mochar chop, aloo posto, chhanar dalna, bhetki paturi, golda chingri er malaikari, dhonepata mutton, aamsottwo er chatni, roasted papad, doi & pantua) and a steamed rice and dub chingri, as desert chhanar payes in chocolate shells. Each and every item was excellen just I don know about d mutton as I don't take  ever,  but rest say it was good too. Thali is impossible for one to finish. Here I must say dub chingri contains here mustard gravy,  not like Oh!Calcutta one's, so it doesn't go with kaju kishmish pulao (don't worry stuffs will guide you! ). In a nutshell, we spend a quality time there and superhappy at their services.bill is worthy.

Being a bengali i prefer trying dishes or cuisines that are different and those that creates an element of surprise in my mind. Therefore, to go to a place serving bong food was never in my option. But the good reviews of 6 Ballygunge place urged me to give it a try. Thanks to zomato and the reviewers for the same. To top it up, since i had  a friend from Delhi i thought there was no better time to visit this place and also to treat my friend to an authentic bengali feast. 

Ambiance is quiet aristocratic. I think the beauty lies in its simplicity. Although i thought the seating for two is very small. They need to make it spacious enough to accommodate the plates and dishes on the table atleast. Also I felt the service was little slow so hopefully the management will take notice and make amends to keep up its reputation. Apart from that from the doorman to the waiters and receptionist, everyone was polite and well informed. 

This restaurant undoubtedly serves the best bengali dishes that i have had so far. We ordered the bhekti paturi which was amazing, had no fishy smell, succulent and just melted in our mouth, then mutton kosha with luchi which too was yummm and cooked perfectly, was not at all chewy and finally the daab chingri with rice which again was a hit. All this was served with the famous "gandharaaj" nimbu which made the food and taste even more delectable.  Last but not the least ended with Kolkatas famous Mishti Doi. 

We had a wonderful time and my friend till date remembers the dishes with fond memories. Great impression left in our mind. Will deffo be visiting again.

'Quintessential Bengali feel in terms of food and ambiance' or not, this is a place that will make your day especially if you had a craving to visit this place since a long time. Located at the heart of Ballygunge Phari (please do not try to land at 6 Ballygunge Place from Ballygunge station, that will take around 20 minutes through obscure lanes and will totally fly your mood out the window, instead, try the Phari scene) , this place is a landmark in itself and is truly deserving . 

The lunch buffet, which had amounted to a total of Rs 550 (incl of all taxes) per person and the menu consists of 
luchi (served on the table),
alur dum,
channar kofta,
beguni (served on the table),
rice,
a saag,
mug daal,
1 mutton dish, 
1 chicken dish,
2 dishes of fish.
Desserts included misti doi, chatni, papad, and a sweet dish. 

Quality is paramount and you will get your money's worth out of this place. But the variation and innovation in dishes is limited. So is the space. I felt, somewhere with my 3rd luchi down, that this place, as a balance with its name, could really expand into something larger. 

However, to draw the bottom line, the place is perfect to have a good bengali lunch (no buffet in dinner )  and the price is extremely reasonable, so are the tastes.

This place is a legend. I had a mouth watering experience. 
Service: excellent. 
Food: brilliant. 
Ambiance: great.
This seems to be  a perfect combination of all the three features a restaurant requires and you would never regret paying. I believe those were not ethnic bengali dishes which they served. So I would also recommend this place to people who like North Indian dishes. This was completely different flavor in total. Do try their fried rice. The essence is so Indian but again the food won't make you feel heavy. I can keep on eating there :P

I had heard a lot about this place and finally got to visit it with a few of my uncles and cousins on the evening of Bhai Phonta last year. The address of the restaurant is the same as its name. It is more of a house than a restaurant. It's just a 2 storied building, the interior of which has been converted into a dining space. You would feel having dinner with your family at your home literally.

I personally found this place much over-hyped going according to the standard of its food and the high prices. For bengalis who live in kolkata, they would find much better bengali food in their own homes at much lesser prices. This place is actually for people who don't get to eat bengali food daily. They would enjoy it as it really serves authentic dishes. That evening buffet was not available. They were serving thalis and ala-carte. We chose the latter. 

We had ordered KAJU KISMIS POLAO and MACHER MATHA DIE MOONG DAL first. Both were average in taste, you would find much better polaos at weddings i could say. Then we took to the traditional delicacy, LOOCHI with CHHOLAR daal. Again, quite average. But the BHAPA ILISH and BHETKI PATURI were quite good . The sizzling smell of mustard with green chillis really gave the taste buds a good kick. And finally the famous KOSHA MANGSHO of bengalis. I've had much better kosha mangshos at my home even. So it was  really not worth trying it out with so many bucks. Among the desserts we took BAKED SHANDESH. It tasted very unique, warm and different.

Overall, you could try this place out if you are looking for authentic bengali food , provided you don't have it daily. But still, I would say, the prices don't match up to the restaurant's standard and fame.

heard of this place a lot of time but never got the chance to step inside(cz i am a bit lyadhkhor). ultimately got the chance due to treat from a senior in college. we went for the lunch buffet. 
The ambience inside was nice. soothing rabindra sangeet music,ghoroya poribesh. the service was nice.
First the luchi was being served in the table. it was awesome with the alur dom. then there was plain rice, dal, chanar dalna, parshe mach sosrshe die, doi murgi, mutton kasha, chatni, papad, chamcham, misti doi.
i didn't like the dal at all. but the chanar dalna was good
But the best two dishes were parshe mach and doi murgi.
parshe was just awesome that i ate 5 of that. :P(sry, but i was too hungry).
and the doi murgi is also superb.
mutton was good. but i didn't like the misti.
doi was good. 
i think the price for the buffet is ok. but they can increase a bit more variety in the items with an increment in the price.
but afterall i liked the place, the food and the servuces.
But I have a suggestion. please assange for a wash basin outside the toilet cause as it is inside the toilet there was a line for hand wash.

Had heard a lot about the place, till we finally got a chance to visit the famous '6 Ballygunge place' for a lunch with my family and family friends. The very first impression I had of this place was that this restaurant had an amazing ambiance. Really soothing.... Coming to the food we had ordered- bhat, dal, aloo bhaja, begun basanti, chanar dalna, dab chingri, doi murgi and mutton kosha, out of which my personal favorites were-  chanar dalna, dab chingri and doi murgi. I strongly recommend these dishes at '6 Ballygunge place'. The service was nice too. Overall this was a great dining experience. Looking forward to return again, some time soon..:)

This place is repeatedly criticised for being priced too steeply. Well, good ambience + good services + excellent lip smacking food has its price. If you are a gourmet,this is a place you cannot miss. I had visited this place with my family. The Aam pora shorbet was divine. We tried out the veg and non-veg thaalis. Believe me, the portions served could easily have been shared by two. The alu posto and hilsa deserve special mention here. The pantua however was exceptionally sweet-my only regret.

This is an overpriced place no doubt about that but I also cant deny that they serve good quality food even in their buffet. Once during Poila Baishak i went to their restaurant with my husband and had a great time savouring the delicacies.. The menu consisted of Luchi,alur dum, Plain rice, Dum pulao, Baked shukto, moog mohon dal, jhuri alu bhaja, Topse fry, Bhetki paturi, echor chingri, chingri bhuna, chicken torpedo, morich mutton, aam chatni, papad, Aam doi, malai chomchom and choco sandesh and sweet pan in the end.. The dishes that stood out were the Luchi-aloor dum , topse fry, echor chingri, the Pulao-morich mutton combo and the Aam doi. Didnt exactly remember the price tag that came along with it but i remember it was quite high.. but the items in the menu and quality was so good that i can forget that.. The service was also good :)

Well the food is good if you are craving for Bengali fare, but the fact remains that the place is a tad over priced. Also, the cooking is not consistent -- the taste of an item may differ when you repeat it upon your next visit -- which is a normal thing at home, but not expected at a restaurant. However, to be fair, this place is a good choice for someone trying to taste authentic Bengali cuisine.

If you are a bong food lover, this is undoubtedly the best food outlet in kolkata. The ambience is superb. And the authentic bengali dishes are just awesome. I have been to this place for 8 times probly, mostly for the buffet. However, fish kabiraji, chingri malaikari are worth trying. The bhetki paturi and baked mihidana with rabri are yummy! Do visit the place. I can bet u would like to visit again and again and again.

Lovely Bengali food selection ! Took me some time to understand the menu with a lot of help from the waiter although he was very helpful and suggested some favorites. I absolutely loved everything we ordered and needed a long nap after lunch to help digestion. We had selection of sea food with a jumbo prawn curry which was delightful. To my good luck they had some boneless fish cooked in a leaf which tasted phenomenal.  We even ordered a batter fried fish that came with a mustard sauce and its pungent notes made it the perfect combination. A bit pricy by worth a try.

Today I went to enjoy Hilsa Festival hosted by 6 Ballygunge Place. Monsoon is just the right time to indulge your taste buds, and what better way to do it than celebrate with the queen of the river, Hilsa. Like previous years, 6 Ballygunge Place creates magic with the fish under the planning and guidance of Chef Sushanta. Ambiance was awesome and I was greeted properly by the staffs. As soon I finished my 'Gondhoraj Lebu r Sorbot', I dig into their ‘Elish Machher Cutlet’ and the soft crispy boneless hilsa just melted in my mouth. Then I relish some ‘Achari Elish Kumror Doga Diye’ which really tastes out of this world. Taste of traditional ‘Elisher Matha diye Kochu Saag’ will definitely make you nostalgic. ‘Anaras Elish’ is a one of its kind dish and really innovative and you could not stop eating dishes like ‘Aam Tel Elish’, ‘Dumur Elish’, ‘Elish Korma’. For connoisseurs with appetite, there is the ‘Elish Thali’ as well, that serves Elish Macher Tel, Elish Macher Dim Bhaja, Elich er Chachra, Bhapa Elish along with plain rice and dal. Hilsa has the power to get our hearts racing, our tummy happy and our senses rousing – much like the promise of a new love. This festival is highly recommended for Hilsa lovers.

The food is definitely good but I think there is hardly any variety in the buffet fare. The ambience is warm and inviting and they also indulged our request for luchi to be served with the buffet of which it wasn't a part. But I really think the buffet fare is really limited. Would like if you added some more dishes to the menu. Other than that all good. :-)

I visited here for the first time not having experienced bengali food outside much and I must admit being astonished at the superb quality of food that greeted me here. I tried the prawn finger and the 1/1 bishop lefroy road (a drink which deserves an applause ad much for its taste as for its naming). The main course consisted of kaju kishmish polao and dhone pata kancha lanka chicken which were both pretty good. The pineapple chutney was a bit too sweet for my taste but the finish - a chanar payesh with chocolate shell was simply legendary. If anyone wants to taste authentic bengali cuisine this is the place

Since Bengali food is best cooked by my Mom and served best at my place, I never really thought of having Bengali cuisine anywhere else. Once my friend gave a treat in 6BP and that is how I was introduced to this place. We went to their main joint in 6 Ballygunge Place only. I liked the vintage look of the building and the interiors in similar taste. I loved their unique style of Menu and it took me quite some time to order my mocktail and I finally had 54A, AJC bose road --- coconut water based drink , though not comparable to paramount's daaber sherbet it was quite refreshing and new to my palette. Gondhoraaj chicken was our starters and the flavours will  fill your senses with aroma and taste. Then we moved to main course. If you ever meet someone who can cook shukto to perfection know for sure the person is truly a masterchef --- for judging the same about 6 BP we ordered SHuktoni as they call it and Mochar Ghonto as it is my favorite. We had plain rice and daab chingri. Here I was a bit disappointed as the Daab chingri of Oh! Calcutta is a class apart! and this was not much close to it, it had less malai and more of a  shorshe based gravy in a simmered inside the daab for a mild taste of coconut malai. I was not satisfied. WE then had asanti pulao and kosha mangsho and it was good, very good indeed. We ended our meal with Nolengurer Ice cream and it was splendid!

I think the place is quite overhyped...1. the food is nothing special..its simple(atleast in the buffet)...and sad to say my mom can prepare better food than theirs ;p2. ambience is perfect....its calm and soothing...even the interiors r good3. I have to say dat the service is excellent...the waiters are friendly and helpful...they are always by your side..4. the eatery is overpriced....a lot...apart from the buffet...

ONE TIME VISIT IS ENOUGH TO SATISFY YOUR CURIOSITY .

Everytime I visit this place, I am bowled over! There are hardly any other Bangali restaurants in the city which can sync quality, quantity and taste so accurately. The luchis they make are the perfect Bengali dida's luchi. Soft and fluffy. I would specially mention the menu card, which I think has a very novel concept of providing a nomenclature for the dishes and drinks. And speaking of the ambience, it helps you digest a perfect meal! And a very friendly staff on board as well.

Authentic Bengali Food for Outsiders
Being Punjabi, i wanted to try Bengali Cuisine, So my friend took me there for Authentic Bengali Food, There was waiting period, this hotel is actually made in Apartment type layout, though the ambiance was good. We ordered for Luuchi,Sweet Dal, Shukto  (Mix Vegetables in Bengal), and some dish made of Fried Brinjals.  The food quality was good, aromatic and very well presented. For Desserts i had Curd served in pot.

This was my second encounter with Authentic Bengali Cuisine. The ambiance is very warm & inviting. I wanted to tried the vegetarian food & ordered Aloo Jhunga Posto, Chhanar Malai Curry with Parathas. The food was served in time & aroma of mustard was great. The food was simple, but very tasty. We tried Raj Bhog & Misti Dhoi. Everyone in Kolkata knows how to make it, but very few have cracked the desert. Here, deserts very fine. Staff was very helpful & their recommended food was delicious. Overall a good experience. Recommended if you go to Kolkata.

Had been to this place with my boyfriend on of the weekends during my stay in Kolkata. Being a Bengali , I couldn't afford to give this place a miss. Though had to wait for a long time before we were given a table , the wait was worth it. Once you enter it, you would get to see all people hungrily and happily gorging on the delicious bengali food. We ordered crispy pomfret fires, maacher maatha diye moong dal,kosha mangsho,tel koi,shukto,plastic chutney.And trust me all these dishes completely satiated my hunger for bengali food. The ambiance is pretty and it is very spacious too. Though one might tend to get irritated with the constant loud,chattering of people.This place is a  must visit.

Price was it is good and the qty was sufficient. I especially liked the chingri macher malaikari and Bhetki paturi been a fish addict. Mutton was ok. Veg items were average. Overall the experience was good and would suggest to visit at least once.

But the staff were not friendly. The ambiance is nice and perfect for a bengali cuisine restaurant. But being a bengali I don't really like to spend exhorbitant amount of money. But their ilish is worth the money. Those who want to taste bengali cuisine this is a must.

Visited this place last week on a weekday afternoon. It was easy to locate as opposite of my school patha-bhavan. 
The place was full and we need to wait 15 mins in a small room on the side of main resto. The room was AC, so, it was OK.

Coming to main attraction food, well, it was plain and simple food. Its normal pain and simple food. The spread consisted of Aam pora shorbot, luchi, begun bhaja, aloor dum, mangshor chop, saada bhaat, moog dal, maacher jhal, lal murgi, kochi paantha r jhol, chutney, papad, mishti.  
They place for serving buffet was not very neat and clean. The waiters seems to be laid back, and not very attentive when needed. 

Overall, an average place to me, however looking into the crowd, it seems very popular.

Fine Bengali dining calls for a must visit to this place! The ambiance is great, the waiters are very patient and helpful! And although I have had home-cooked Bengali meals all the time, I have to give these people their due! The refreshing gondhoraj ghol, the crispy Pomfret fries, the succulent strips of chicken with a lemony tang! I liked the spaciousness of the place, however with time it got crowded, with kids screaming/crying, and a whole different buzz! and I usually prefer my fine meals in a quieter setting! Coming back to the main courses - the paturi, the mutton and the daab chingri was definitely a delight, the portions were quite fair. For those with sweet tooth their dessert section is a must try too ! This place is not for a one-time visit, one will keep coming back for more!

Absolute delight for anyone who loves Bengali food. Simple decor, high ceiling,it's like one of those houses from the early 20th century.We started of with Posto Narkel Bora and Mochar Ghonto, Pur Bhora Doi Potol. The Mochar Ghonto was just out of the world.It's absolutely must have. Coming to the main course, we had Bhapa Ilish and Pabda Jhaal . I love Pabda, but was somehow disappointed. The Ilish however stole the show. It was just perfect.  

Topped it all with Nolengurer Icecream for dessert. 

Overall a very good experience.

Anyway , enough with the whole ranting. Some items on the menu are good to go with and some are a total waste of money. So choose wisely when you order food here

Had the buffet on Saturday afternoon with family. Didn't have a reservation and had to wait for 15 min. But they have an air conditioned waiting room outside the restaurant so it wasn't painful. 

Went for the buffet at 475/- plus taxes.

The spread comprised of Aam pora shorbot,  luchi,  begun bhaja,  saak bhaja, aloor dum,  mangshor chop, saada bhaat,  shukto, moog dal, parshe maacher jhal, lal murgi, kochi paantha r jhol, chutney,  papad. 

Dessert comprised of mishti doi, gulab jamun and rosogollo. 

The food was good but not exceptional, especially if you are a bengali and have such food in your home. 

Service was good. Despite being a buffet the waiters were serving hot luchi on the table from time to time and despite being a packed floor, the waiters were constantly asking if we needed anything more.

Visited this neighbourhood eatery for its lunch buffet. Regal, homely ambience but the food, for me did not live up to the hype. A couple of things I really loved were Lal Murgi (robust) with rice and Begun Bhaja (succulent). Where as Luchi Alur Dom, Musur Dal, Bhetkir Paturi, Bhetkir Jhal and Mishti Doi were most-average. Not a great place in terms of value-for-money, either but surely deserves one visit.

The original restaurant (@ 6, Ballygunge Place) gets a bit crowded with the tables kept so close on rush days like Bengali New Year, but I think we can ignore that completely once we focus on the food!

Had been to this restaurant this year on the eve of Poila Baisakh (Chaitra Sankranti day).
Though I had been to their Salt Lake restaurant earlier, this was the first time I visited their original branch.
We were a large family group of 9 and initially the person who took the booking had miscommunicated that they cannot accommodate a large table for the entire group. The restaurant is located in a converted residence building and hence generally lacks a sprawling area since the tables are fitted in the different rooms. But finally we were happy that they provided us seats at a large oval table at the rear end of the restaurant which fitted the entire family well.  Though the place was very crowded, we found the ambience decent enough. We started with Mango Am Panna drink and the Gondhoraj Chicken, Topshe Mach Bhaja and Posto Vada as starters.. While the Gondhoraj Chicken was excellent - a very light Chicken preparation with a mild aroma of Gondhoraj, we however didn't like the Topshe Mach Bhaja much which we would have preferred to be fried without the masala coating to enjoy the freshness of the fish itself. The main courses that followed after that  (Luchi/Kosha Mangsho, Mutton Pulao, Chringrimacher Malaikari) were all excellent preparations. The mutton pieces of Kosha Mangsho were extremely tender and soft (which is generally rare in most Kosha Mangsho preparations). The biggest find was the Mutton Pulao which was a very light pulao with tender small pieces of mutton in it (very similar to a Hyderabdi biriyani) and tasted heavenly. Overall the food was extremely tasty, the portions were all of good size and made a good a mark on us. Apart from the food, 2 more things I liked- a small hand sanitizer for each table and a rack for the daily newspaper to spend your time with till the food arrives. These are small low cost items but are definitely big differentiators and adds to the overall impression. The place however lacks any alcoholic drinks which was a slight let down.

Well I am a vegetarian, had gone to show my friend the taste of Bengali food, which she wanted to try. Well we started off with some sweet and salty curd beverage, which was nice to start with as it refreshed me completely. I ordered aloo dum, cholar daal and radha ballavi, which turned out to be really good with lot of cashews in the daal giving it an elite and rich look and taste as well. Though the aloo dum had a lot of oil, making us both like the daal more! Radha ballavi was light but the taste could need some attention from the chef! The ambience is majorly Bengali traditional look, little classy and little old fashioned, giving it the perfect score for out comers to visit.

More than their food, I like the interiors of this restaurant. Its homely cozy atmosphere will definitely put an Bengalee at home, instantly. The food was not extraordinarily praiseworthy. However, I think they have a well balanced buffet, which is not unnecesssarily overloaded with items. The must have is the nolen gurer ie-cream.

I went to 6 Ballygunge Place with an empty stomach and a head buzzing with questions, most of them of the happily curious kind. Glad to say I wasn't let down at all. We picked this place as a treat for a dear friend visiting from Mumbai who wanted to try authentic Bengali food. As per suggestions made to us, we ordered the buffet... WHAT A FEAST!
The menu was huge and sumptuous and the quality and quantity of food superb. 
Let me start with the "Begun bhaja and Saag bhaja" as starter items with Luchi or Bhaat as you prefer. The Daal with Bitter gourd was the best I have ever had. Followed by Dhokar Dalna, Aloor Dum, Lau chingri (let me say here that my friend was reluctant to try this as he isn't fond of Lau..but, he took 2 helpings of the same). The Papda (fish) was fresh, soft and cooked perfectly in the mildly spicy mustard gravy. The Doi Murg was good too, and the Mutton stole the show away. The meal ended with Baked Sandesh, Mishti doi and chuntey-papad... 

Considerably heavier on the tummy and not too low on the pocket, we came out of the place wanting more. 

I'm going back... SOON!

P.S - The Gondhoraj Ghol was light and just the right amount of tangy...

Authentic Bengali food at its best. Tried out the fish, prawn and lobster gravies, and while all of them came in mustard sauces, there were marginal taste differences in them making each dish taste phenomenal. Just have all of them with rice, and you would be treated to a feast at 6 Ballygunge. 
Not being available in too many cities (apart from the original in Kolkata and one in Bangalore) and being fairly heavy on the pocket are the only downsides to this awesome restaurant.

"6 Ballygunge Place" the name itself invite you to eat. Located in a well developed residential area of Ballygunge-Kolkata. Heavily crowded even at 3 and we had to stroll for almost half and hour to find a seat. Restaurant is split in number of rooms. As i was already stuffed from Mocambo we tried only 2 dishes. one was Betki Paturi - a fresh water fish roasted and served with coated coconut chutney and wrapped in a leaf. High in mustard fish tastes good only if you have liking towards fresh water fish. Posto Narkel (fried poppy seeds preparation) Pakoda type was an average dish. overall a good place atleastyou get a typical aroma of fish preparation once you enter.

We reached early at about 7:30 and the place was empty indicating we were the first customers for dinner .
The staff is polite but maybe a little too eager 
As soon as we were ready to order 3 waiters came forward! While one actually took it down we were surrounded on 3 sides by other waiters who kept putting in their inputs on what we should try.
All through the meal there was 1 waiter or another standing right behind us watching us eat who only went away when we stared him down
Honestly!
The food was ok and I have to say I've had better Bengali cuisine at other places (Oh! Calcutta anybody? ) even though I'm not a fan.
The price was pretty cheap so if you're planning to spend less you probably consider this place .

6BP is a good deal, if you are looking for Bengali cuisine. The place is way better than it's Bangalore counterpart... giving you the feeling of that authentic "Bangali Bonedi Baari". The decor and the interiors are very elegant. Service is great.

Loved every item that I tasted..... with special mention to Radhaballavi/Karai-shootir kachuri, Fulkopi-r roast, Daab Chingri, Bhetki Paturi, Bhapa Ilish & Morich Maangsho. I can almost smell all of them as I am typing this in. 

A visit to 6BP is bound to make some TASTY memories. BLISS!!

Fantastic food is the reason for 6 Ballygunge Place being the #1 Trending Restaurant in Calcutta.

The restaurant was quite full for a weekday lunch. Along with a foodie friend from Bombay, I ordered the traditional vegetarian dishes and felt the following - 

•	Begun Bhaja - Succulent shallow fried brinjals that did not ooze oil 
•	Chollar Daal  - Thick and rightly sweet
•	Navratna Paturi - Mixed veggies and cottage cheese grilled in bananas leafs. The strong mustard provided a new and different flavor for the palate and the plate  
•	Loochi and Radha Ballabi - The traditional maida puri and the huge stuffed puri were both fried but did not need to be dabbed with a tissue paper to remove the extra oil.

A hearty meal for a small price. The service is slow and we waited for around half an hour for our food. 

But, the food was so flavorsome that it made my friend forget about the long wait in the restaurant and the scorching summer outside it. 

I am definitely going back to try some non - traditional dishes to see if it can live up to the expectations too.

lot have been already told about 6 ballygunge place and indeed it's a great place if you are heading for authentic bengali delicacy. though i am not too keen on trying bengali food outside my home, i went for their special buffet offer of bengali food during durga puja. the menu was elaborate starting with bhekti fry, luchi, alur dom, chhanar malai curry and then moving onto doi pona, chicken curry, kasha mangsho along with polao. every food item is cooked well with big pieces of fish and tender pieces of mutton welcoming me to taste them. for dessert we had pantua and mishti doi. we also went another time after puja and ordered a-la-carte and the food were good once again with basanti polao partnering well with bhapa ilish and kasha mangsho that time.
coming to the decor and ambiance, nothing is worth complaining. very ethnic and pleasing to the eyes, not loud at all. waiters are very polite and always come with a smile. overall, a thumbs up from me to the premiere bengali restaurant of the town.

An authentic Bengali cuisine restaurant that needs no introduction in Kolkata. 6 Ballygunge Place is a restaurant on every Bengali's mouth and also since Poila Boishak is knocking the doors, many Bengali's would target this place for their lunch or dinner on that day.

Menu consists best of all mouthwatering Bengali dishes and available in both buffet and a-la-carte. A-la-carte is a good option if you would like to try some of their best food, buffet is a descent option though. For starters I recommend Gondhoraj Chicken (boneless Chicken strips with essence of gondhoraj lemon) and Fish Fry. Main course dishes are too flavorsome and anything and everything is recommended in the menu. Cholar Dal with Pulao along with some Luchi is great to go with. Apart from that, Doi Murgi is good to go as it is boneless and mutton dishes are also juicy and so soft that they feel next to boneless. Also, didn't I mention about Fishes? The Bhetki and Eelish Paturi are very good and you would always want more of it.

Coming to desserts, which is comprised of mostly sweets. The Baked Mihidana with Rabri is a good recommendation. Apart from that if you don't like sweets, various ice-creams are also available.

Prices are closer to what I would say budget friendly mostly due to the quantity and people will not mind paying a bit more for such homely and authentic food. The services is a bit slow, mainly because Bengali dishes require bit more time for preparation.

Ambiance is really good, since this restaurant is converted from a house, you will find small rooms with three or four tables inside. It's a sort of private dinning except for the fact that there are three or four tables in each room. Lighting is sort of uneven as one area is very well lit and another corner is poorly lit, taking photos is not an easy job in the sort of pale lighting. Tables, sofas and chairs are of descent quality except for the fact that tables have little scratch marks on the edges. Soft instrumental music is always played to keep the decorum of the place.

6 Ballygunge Place also provides catering services and I have seen them catering in many parties and occasions. I don't know the pricing for that but it's worth giving a try especially if you have any parties or occasions where you would invite lots of Bengali people.

THESE PEOPLE ARE REALLY UNPROFESSIONAL...I CALLED UP TO MAKE A BOOKING FOR 2 on POILA BOISAKH, WHILE ONE OF THEIR EMPLOYEE TOLD THAT SLOT FOR 12 PM and 3 PM IS AVAILABLE, OTHER PERSON REVERTS 3 MINS LATER THAT THE  SLOT IS FULL.

I HAVE EXPERIENCED BHOJO HORI MANNA AND OH CALCUTTA BOTH, BUT NEVER CAME ACROSS SUCH UNPROFESSIONAL PEOPLE OF A SO CALLED REPUTED BENGALI JOINT.

I was in 6 Ballygunge Place, to celebrate husband's birthday. It was worth it. I loved posto narkol bora crispy and crunchy. Then, we tried mangsho er jol, it was really hot outside, food was low spiced and absolutely perfect to weather. The serving staff were kind and pleasing. The ambience inside restaurant brings memories of ancestral homes of Kolkata. 

I would give them 5 , if the rooms were more spacious like it is old house and  improve on interior decorations  may be old chandeliers, old style cutlery ,old furniture etc. Food was perfect.

What can i say about this joint that has already not been said. I am not a fan of fish, although am a bong. But the topshe macher fry here is absolutely delicious. You can possibly not get enough of it. The typical  Bengali 'kosha mangsho' is very good to taste too. However, I think the Hilsa dishes could have been made to taste better. The beverage menu can be improved and more desserts can be added to the existing ones. The nolen gurer ice cream is wonderful. I would highly recommend 6 Ballygunge Place to those people who don't want to go through the hassle of cooking exotic Bengali dishes, but still want to have them.

I will talk about the food in a minute, but I do want to mention the great use of music at 6 Ballygunge. Restaurant music is admittedly hard to get right - instrumentals can make you feel like you're stuck in an elevator or worse remind you of India's late 90s crush on Yanni and Kenny G. Too upbeat and they risk being jarring, drowning conversation and defeat the purpose of a leisurely meal. 6B, with it's judicious use of instrumental versions of Bengali music sticks to it's theme and one would not be far off in calling it 'lilting'.

Great service , food is prepared fresh and they warn you before had of the time it's going to take (and more wondrously - stick to it!). The Daab Chingri was delicately spiced and well presented, the Ilish Paturi melts in your mouth and the Mochhar Ghonto was the only time I ate and enjoyed any sort of Ghonto. Well done 6B, well done.

The Malpuas and Nolen Gurer ice cream were really good too -  but those are a little hard to get wrong.

On the downside -  the menu is a little busy

Definitely look forward to another visit.

This Saturday was a cousins' day out and we had decided to go for a bengali lunch...and 6 Ballygunj Place turned out to be just the right place! We had opted for the buffet spread and was delighted by the taste of each item. Everything was well cooked. Lal murgi and shukto were my favorites. We were too happy with the piping hot Malpoya's as dessert! We didn't have to interact much with the staff but they were decent enough. The simplicity of the decor was soothing. Apart from the ambience what i must add is the politeness of the gate keeper, who even offered  to click our group pic. :)

I love bengali food. Never really had to go to a restaurant to eat it because our maid and my aunt would cook it for me. Both being exceptional cooks. alu jhingey posto, sukhto, chod chori, mochaar chop, chichinga, dhokar dalna,chanar dalna, tauk daal, chichinga- you name it, i have had it all.

But i had been wanting to visit this place since the time they opened because i heard good things about them and also because  i am a regular at their other restaurant " The Wall" popular for chinese. I finally did go there a month back (wished i had not). I was supremely disappointed with their food.  

We asked for 2-3 drinks which they were unable to provide so had fresh lime soda.Their mochar chop was above average, begun bhaja not good ( the begun had really thick skin, non chewable almost). For main course we ordered the foll:

1. bhaja masala alu dum- the alu was neither bhaja nor had any masala. it seemed as if boiled baby potatoes had been just been tossed in a pan with some red chilli. very bland and tasteless. The worst i had so far.

2. phulkopir roast- This was very good, the only redeeming dish. Made in typical bengali style.

3. chollar daal- decent enough.

4. khejur aam paapad chutney-  Not good at all. not the right colour, consistency was thin and was overtly sweet. lacked the tanginess of the aam paapad.

5. Luchi- i could make better luchis i guess. cold and thick.

6. Radha ballavi- They dont even know what it is, looked and tasted more like dal paranthas.

7. karaishutir kachori-  again over fried, very thick and cold.

8. kaju kismis pulao- average.

9. desserts- chanar payesh in choc shells- pathetic, had to throw it away
                        baked pantua- average.

I would love to believe that it was one of those bad days where you get bad food even at a very good joint. But it does not seem that way. For the price they charge and the kind of location; they really need to pull up their socks. It seemed that we were eating a roadside joint. You dont expect this kind of food at an upscale, posh bengali restaurant. 

I would got to " oh! Calcutta" anyday.  This place is not even in the same league, Even though oh calcutta is almost one 1.5 times of what i paid here but its food that you will truly relish and enjoy. It was hard for me to believe that the same management runs " the wall" .

Authentic bengali cuisine and vintage decor. For us bengalis, roots are as important as spinach to popeye and this restaurant certainly helps maintain the culture our grand parents proudly talk about. 
The lunch Buffett is mouthful and homely. For best results please use your hand. Nicely balanced veg and non-veg dishes. Especially"lal shaak" bhaja and achari mangsho. 
Deserts could be improved. We bangalis are no longer satisfied with lal doi and channar malpoa. We need dry sweet. We need gurer ice cream. 
One also feels the big table set right in front of the Buffett table to accommodate more customers makes maneuvering around the food extremely cumbersome. And thus it is considered kindof "hanglamo" on the restaurant's part for more money. 
Waiters are nice and friendly and serve food on the table if requested, thier dress code is an area of improvement though.
Decent experience overall. Worthy of a rank in cultural food tourism.

. I moved out of kolkatta two decades ago but keep returning . I  love bengali food but i am a veg. This place has good homely bengali food without being rich . It is simple and not at all pretencous . It has enough seating space and was not noisy at all . At around eight o'clock we easily got a table for eight . The food is made fresh . We ordered starters, which were two types of chaap . I liked the chena one better . The came two dals and aloo dum , The dals were ok . But the aloo dum made up for it . The luchi were soft and light and was not too oily ,I had personally orderd dhoka dalna ,It was  up to my expectation . what i fell in love with was a dry vegetable with coconut and mustard preparation. It was Jorjori something .Did not get the name , but it was the first time I had the preparation . The rest was good but nothing out of the ordinary . 
Pricing was reasonable except that they charge rupees 7 for packing the extra chatneys which were not complimentary .
 I would not do justice if i did not comment on the service , The service is bad . The head waiter for got the bhajas and insisted we had not ordered , He later forgot the mishi doi we ordered as deserts . When asked he again blatently insisted that we had placed the order , This after asking when we would like the doi , 
So if one has the patience to tolerate incompent service it is worth a visit ,

After hearing a lot about it I finally visited it today with my friend. The interior is like home, neat and clean. Waiters are polite. I took buffet there. Rice and dal was ok, nothing special about it. The fish was good. I did not like the chicken item really. But mutton was superb, so soft and juicy. Chatni and dahi was good, and the malpoa was supercool. It was the best malpoa I have ever had. But i must say i expected a little more quality food. Their food quality does not justify their cost fully. All I can say undoubtedly it is a good restsurant but for me, definitely not the excellent one.

Hi,



I m from mumbai,....one of my friend told me you can taste authentic bengali dishes in 6 ballygunge place.

Went there with lot of expecatations on 16 the Feb14 along with my family

The ambience is good ...there is an old world decor in the place and perfect surrounding to feast on the bengali dishes.

We ordered - Morolla Pyazi, Gondhoraj chicken( at waiter's insistence), Alu Posto, Dhokar Dalna, Chingri Malai curry, Kosha Mangsho, Bhetki paturi, Noren gurer icecream.

The starters - Morolla Pyazi was good , the preparation/concept  is good but  had a feeling the morolla fish were tad overfried.

Gondhoraj chicken other than the faint gondhoraj lebu's flavour in the strips of chicken, there is no novelty in it so you can skip it.

Aloo Posto- I think an amateur cook can also prepare  it better and the potatoes were bit overboiled and there ws no flavour of Posto

Dhokar Dalna- It is a full paisa wasool   dish, perfectly prepared, every body in our group liked it.

Chingri Malai curry- Simply let us down , very ordinary can skip it

Bhetki paturi- Excellently done, the flavour of mustard was simply overwhelming would recommend every body to have it.It is too good.

Kosha Mangsho- Good preparation .

Noren Gurer icecream - Tasted awesome bt some of us felt it had an overdose of sweetness bt i did not mind as it did justice to my sweet tooth,



The restaurant guys were very helpful  in serving....

Would like to have another visit of of 6 BP.

After hearing a lot of great reviews from my friends about this place I finally managed to eat here on Christmas Day 2013. They supposedly had a special buffet that day and I enjoyed it thoroughly. 

The ambiance was classy and made me feel very comfortable. The service was top notch. The waiter was kind and timely. The buffet in itself was Bengali in every sense, it was full on flavours but at the same time looked simple. It had one dish of chicken, mutton, prawn, fish and anchovies. 

There were also few dishes for the vegetarians too but I was too busy with their non vegetarian offering. The anchovies were not great. It was made like pakoras, mixed with onions, the normal stuff. Then came I tasted their prawns. I could feel my taste buds dance in joy every time I sucked the juice off the prawns.  The chicken was good too but could not beat the high standards set by the prawns. The fish was cooked in banana leaf and had a nice, simple and subtle flavour of the banana leaf which I liked. The mutton did not disappoint me either. Melt-in-mouth mutton! Literally! Whoa! Their rice and puris were good but I had very small portions of them because I was hooked to their PRAWNS! 

Coming to their dessert, they had mishti doi, hot jamuns and christmas rum cake. The doi was creamy and tasty. If you got a thing for creamy sweets you will love their mishti doi. Their jamuns were served hot and were like any other jamuns, nothing special there. The cake was pretty ordinary. Mishti Doi was the clear winner that night!

The food is slightly overpriced at Rs. 875/head (special buffet, rem?) but would be a great place to try Bengali food.

Menu- starters- Prawn fry & Fish fry, Lime Juice, Sprite & water for the health conscious..Main course- Ilish bhapa, chingri malai curry,kosha mangsho,rui macher er jhol, pomfret roast, eichor er dalna, jhuri bhaja-alu, moong dal, paratha without oil, steamed rice.Desert- Nolen gurer er icecream.

I went with my uncle,aunt and extended family for lunch to 6 Ballygunge Place and the meal was simply awesome, all-though I did feel the rui shorshe could have been a tad bit better, the bhapa ilish was quite good and the kosha mangsho gravy was excellently made. The eichor er dalna and alu jhuri bhaja  simply vanished.
The fish fry was also very well made, all-though I prefer the one at Fishfish..The maida paratha without oil was the highlight of the entire lunch and made very well.
Overall a lovely experience and I would take people again for lunch especially elderly. The ala carte menu was better than the buffet spread.

Frankly speaking, I do not prefer going out and checking Bengali restaurants of the city. I feel it is a complete wastage of money to spend on a cuisine that I have already tasted as its best at my own home. I feel my mother is the best cook existing on this planet and there is no bong platter that she has not prepared for me. But on this particular day, I did go out as it was my fiance's preference. He had just come out of fever and said "I am not getting any taste from whatever I am eating. I want to eat something nice and spicy that I am sure to like. Not something  that I have not heard of." Basically he referred to me who is famous for ordering food from the menu which I have never tasted ever. So, as he presented his case, he won my sympathy vote and we both ended up stepping onto 6 Ballygunge Place. It was not his suggestion as he had his own personal favourite. It was my request to visit this place as we had never checked it out , though heard of a lot. He was all angry as he stepped in. We visited the one in Ballygunge itself. The restaurant occupied the ground floor of a Bengali household. One had to move from one room to another to search for the best available place. The owner didn't seem to have put much effort and breaking and making walls .He simply painted and polished the place to make it look appealing. My fiancé was used to getting into large places , places which were constructed with dining area in mind. Next was the intellectually snobbish crowd who ordered "begun bhaja" (fried brinjals) and ' luchi"( Bengali styled "puris" made out of refined wheat flour) as if it was something exotic. This doubly put him off.
We quietly ordered our choice of food which didn't take more than fifteen minutes to arrive, as promised by the waiter. The "phulkopir roast" (roasted cauliflower) was my choice as it was something that I had never had at my house. It was mildly spiced, light white gravied tangy preparation that we both relished with utmost delight. It was something that one is sure to crave for more once done  with one portion. The "bhetkir jhal" and "morich murgi" was next on the list. The fish was of high quality and the mutton was well cooked but neither was something that I never tasted before. For dessert, I ordered for baked "pantua"("gulab jamun"). It was nothing special as it sounded. It was the same "gulab jamun" that one gets in every sweet shop layered with a dash of "rabri" to give it an extra punch.
There was "shutki maach" on the list which was quiet a surprise item for me. I have never seen "shutki macch" being served in a restaurant. It was typical East Bengali home specialty. The tag line was tastefully apt-" not for the fainted hearted- pungent and spicy". Although we were in two minds as to whether to try it or not but decided for a second visit as we were short of space in our stomachs.
The food is served in sumptuous quantities. One wont be feeling disappointed with the portions nor will be feeling overbeared with it. We also came to know about the "thali' system being served here where one could taste multiple items at a reasonable rate. As for us, we were biiled 1284 INR which I feel was "paisa wasool".

Love the old world charm of this place with great home style bengali food. The Kacha lonka murgi and masher jhol were great. A good party place where large groups can easily be accommodated. Good location, good ambience. The pricing is just right not low not high…. The only thing about the place that needs improvement is the speed of service. That is the reason I give this place 4 stars and not 5

In the last few years Kolkata has seen the arrival of some very good destinations for the people with a love for food.
6 Ballygunge place is a place where you find the ambience to be relaxed and the food to be just the type you want it to be.
Last time I had gone with a guest who had come from Mumbai and who did not know the typical bengali cuisine and so was not interested in trying it out, lest he miss a wonderful lunch in the city of Joy. Succumbing to my consistent requests, he finally went for mocha, dhokar dalna, and chingrir malai kari. The only feedback he gave me is that he was really lucky to have listened to me. All in all i would say that everything is just perfect.

Well what do I say about 6 Ballygunge Place! Bangali barir baire abhijatto Bangali khabar er shera (the best in the business when it comes to serving traditional Bengali outside a Bengali home). That is the best way I can sum up this place. I cannot single out items from this place to recommend. It just is not possible. Most of the appetizers as their classification suggests are appetizing, my personal favourite of course being the kabiraji. The vegetarian preparations are as outstanding as the appetizers. The shukto is prepared very distinctly in each Bengali household and there is a distinct method and flavour that goes in to each and every style. Same is the case in 6 Ballygunge Place. Also a must try is the dhokar dalna. Try all the non vegetarian mains. I especially like the kakrar jhal, ilish mach preparations (mostly I have found the quality of the fish to be good in case of the hilsa), the chitol macher muitha which is really succulent, the  chiney kebab, the bhetki with gondhoraj lebu and so on. To be honest I haven't tried the pabda and rui here although they feature amongst my very preferred fishes. The kacha lonks murgi is really sumptuous as is the mangshor jhol. All of the pulaos are excellent so take your pick depending on whether you want mutton or prawn in the pulao. I am not particularly fond of the desserts here but the malpua is an exception. The food here is so good I almost forgot to describe the decor. The setting is like an ancient aristocratic Bengali home with red oxide flooring and the and whole architecture and setting of the dimly lit rooms. I especially love the floor. The staff are decent and courteous enough as well. So there really are very few shortcomings of this place save for the desserts. Na hole ekhane kobji dubiye khawa jaaye. (The food here is so good that one can soil one's hands up to the wrists while eating.)

"6 Ballygunge Place" what say about this restaurant... 

The mochar chochori with rice was superb.  
Mangshor Jhol: A traditional bengali dish (Mutton Curry with Aloo),  was very aromatic and bursting with flavor. It went well with white Kaju Kissmiss Polao.

The service is excellent and staffs are well trained to serve the food in a decent manner.

The ambience is excellent.  If you are a Bengali food Lover, then I must recommend you too visit this restaurant and try them.

Have been to this place multiple times and this has to be one of the top ones for Authentic Bengali cuisine..

Went for the Salt lake branch. Just at the stones throw distance from city center 1, Ambiance great, services great, hygiene great and food is fine. This place has its own share of culture adding to the Bangalis and the city. I must say the kind of brand this restaurant it is very hard for itself to maintain. They are doing it fairly well. But  to me, I must say the food they serve can be made more at the par to its expectation.

Heard about this place long ago. Had a strong desire to visit there. But couldn't get a chance until 17th Nov. Finally made there on my parents' wedding anniversary. This was my anniversary gift to mom and dad.

We went there for lunch. We had to wait in queue. The manager told we had to wait for around 60-75 minutes, but we were given table within next 45 minutes. The staff was too polite and cooperating. Hats off for that. The place gives the slight feeling of an old aged Bengali home. The lighting and interiors were good.

Coming to the food. We ordered:
Sobji diye Moong er dal: It was the best ever Moong dal I ever had.
Aaloo posto: Reminded my grandmother's aaloo posto. Just awesome!!!
Chitol maach er peti roast: Not up to the mark. Priced at 395/- INR could have been a bit better. Size of the fish was okay as compared with the size. But the peti part was too small. That is why it was full of fish bone. This was no extra ordinary.
Borishali Chicken: My mom and dad liked it too much. It was too good. It was the same as compared with other chicken items in 16 ana or Bhojohori manna. 
Rajbhog: The size was okay as compared to the price, but the quality was not up to the mark for 6 Ballygunge place!
Nolen gur er ice cream: It was the best part of 6 Ballygunge place! Just outstanding. 

Couldn't get daab chingri, shukto, narkel posto that day. Felt sorry for the same.

Anyways quality of food was good [no stomach problem after consuming it] quantity was okay. Could have been a little bit more.  5 stars for that.

Good location, good ambiance, a little over hyped and a little over priced....This is what exactly what I felt about 6 Ballygunge place. Nothing special as heard...

Price??!!!........ don't get busted....... it's a real value for money treat, excluding the taxes U suppose to pay........ no issue, the food will amuse U for the coming days:)

the ambiance too was remarkably good......... the toilet was also neat, clean and tidy.

A must have experience for families, friends, colleagues and of course any especial relationships:)

thnx....... 6, Ballygunge Place................ I'm LOVing it!!!!!........................

I had heard about this place for a very long time so this was always on my list of to do things in kolkata. So last week when I was in kolkata I made it a plan to visit this place for dinner. 

We enter this place and instantly we get a feel of an eatery in kolkata. Unlike the joints in bombay this place is quite, the lighting is not to bright. Me and my friends are instantly in love with the ambience. 

Coming to the food. Being the only non veggie in group I had to make the most of bengali cusine so I decided to go in for the non veg thali. Where as my friends being the non experimental types ordered the veg thalis. I really loved my thali which had a mutton, fish and prawns dishes along with a host of veg dishes. Though I dint touch the veg part I must confess I loved every bit of non veg. To top it all we were served misti doi as dessert. I was in bengali food heaven. My veggie friends also liked there thalis. 

The service here does need some improvement in terms of getting the orders. It took an eternity to get the thalis we ordered. However the waiters were curt and served us with a smile. I'm surely looking forward to my next trip back to kolkata. I'm surely coming here again.

Went to the place for the first time on last Sunday. Earlier I encountered their food in few parties. We were super excited to taste the food. The nice heritage look and interior of the building fueled our craving even more. I am not trying to be over critical but being a cook myself I often tend to criticize (and I too have my own days.......eisha mauka roj  kahan milta hai! ) Well coming down to item wise review-
Moruola fry- Good taste, crispy, even my 2 year old liked it 
Gondhoraj chicken- soft and succulent, the flavor of the lime was little strong
Mochar Ghonto- Simple awesome....best mocha had in my life
Dab Chingri- Very disappointing , the fish was not succulent and salt did not penetrate the fish 
Chitol Macher Muitha- Again not up to the mark. The fish dumplings should have been more soft 
Bhetki Paturi- This was alright. An average scorer
Nolen gurer icecream -Grossly overpriced. A mild burning smell was there......
So it was a mixed experience .We enjoyed the décor ,their hospitality and ambience, the time spent together but ....my expectations regarding food was not fulfilled. Better next time.

People usually tell me a good food critic is one who never gives full marks. always finds scope for improvement. Well, i beg to differ. I am a regular at the salt lake branch and i was told by my friends to go to this outlet if i really want to have a good time ...

Firstly , it located on a corner plot in ballygunj place, in a heritage sort of a building. Simply loved it at the first stance. As we entered we are greeted by snapshots of kolkata on the walls. I simply loved the durga puja shots of the walls and also the lighting. The color combination of off white and brick red simply adds so much warmth. The place has the feel of a bengali home. 

As we entered we roamed all over and chose the table we desired. The staff was very warm and courteous . the seated us treated us well . 

This review is specifically for the thalis. Silver plated with small silver bowls. loaded in portion size of heaven . Lets come to food now. 

Potol Bhaja : scoured like fish scales and fried. It was one of the most well cooked potols i have ever scene  
Mochar chop: banana flower chops... The ginger and chili notes were delicious 
Dhokar dalna : the best i have eaten so far
Dal : the delicate flavor of coconut is still in my mouth. loved the sweet dal .
Dum Aloo : not brilliant ... but good. 
Kosha mangsho: 6 ballygunj place cannot go wrong with kosha ... they have my loyal vote 
paturi: fish was soft, flaky and super moist 
Chingri malai curry: though i am not a huge fan.... the flavor was brilliant...
Rice
Luchi 
Ghee
Date chutney : tad bit too sweet, but delicious 

this was followed by misti doi and totapuri (lengcha) .... I Liked both

over all my veg friends also loved their veg thalis ... I simply love the fact that the staff is very attentive to smallest of things. 
we were taken very good care of ... 

cant wait to be back soon ... KUDOS !

Ate here quite a number of time but thought of writing a review now, because I concluded the DAAB CHINGRI served here is unique! I have tried Bhojohari Manna & Kewpies but found this to be the best to my liking . Daab Chingri served with whole green chillies & Steamed rice is heavenly :) My hubby's favourite is the Kasha Mangso -it is almost brownish black in colour & he insist only this form of Mutton even at home these days! I also quite like the "Mourala Mach er peyaji" & "Kakra gaal petechi" as starters. We found their quality of food so consistent that we decided to avail their catering service- Savourites in our marriage- needless to say we have received countless appreciations for our choice :)

It really is a tale of two visits this one. 

1st Visit:  Brilliant reception, excellent service, and absolutely gorgeous food. Mouth watering indeed. Had the urge to go back again.

2nd Visit: The reception was completely opposite to the previous visit. Cold, indifferent and distinctly unfriendly I might add. We had made a reservation and yet when we went, the manager said that we had not made any reservation and would be served based on our time of arrival. The food consequently wasn't that good either. Too oily, spicy and not having that Bangaliana.

I am visiting here for d 15th time.... and every time they surprise me with various new dishes and every time I get mesmerized by tasting those dishes. Each and every item present on their menu has its very distinct taste which has no comparison with any of the other Bengali cuisine restaurants. First I would start with d starters I liked d most, -- Bengali Fish Fry, Fish Kabiraji, Chingrir Kabiraji, Gandhoraj Chicken, Hasher Dim-er Devil, Dhania Murgi. All of them tastes fabulous. The way they serve is really mind blowing. Now coming to d main course which I have tasted so far and I liked d most are, -- Daab Chingri, Prawn Malai curry, Bhetki Paturi, Ilish Paturi Boneless, Kacha lanka Dhone pata Murgi, Lal Murgi, Kasha Mangsho, Morich Mangsho, Mangsher Polao, Ilish Polao. These r some of d items I would like to recommend for all bengali food lovers who would like to visit 6BP for getting d actual taste of bengali cuisine. Now coming to d dessert section, one should not forget to miss these items like Chhana-r Payesh in Chocolate Shell, Nolen Gurer Ice cream, Baked Sandesh.... And at d end they surprised us more by giving us a complementary dessert item which they have launced recently - Coconut Ice cream, which tastes awesome. So I would like to visit here again and again for their never ending delicacies. God Bless Savourites Group.

Poila Baishakh 2008. Mum wanted something different from the regular celebration we had...continental that is. I had a date and the nearest experimental joint i could think of was 6 Ballygunge place. And trust me how i thank my fiance , becoz if it wouldnt have been me getting impatient to meet him i would have missed on having the best bengali ever. The buffet spread was fit for a kings feast. Starting from the immaculate taste of the shukto till the baked roshogollas. I still can feel the mutton melting in my mouth....n gos knows how many ilish bhape i unwtapped from the emareld green kolapatas.....though i am not a fan of fish...yet the one at 6th Ballygunge Place i can have over and over again. Daab chingri.....WOW is the only word. When my boss asked me which is the best place to have authentic bengali food.....6th Ballygunge is all i said...and after that i was the official connoissure of ny office.

This place served an amazing crab curry to us. But it was too oily .
We had bhapa ilish, rice , fish pakora and few other fish items. The other fish items were light.
The ambiance is classy and staff is on their toes to serve you and help you order. But somehow the crab curry which was very tasty left me feel too much stuffed, I was trying crab curry for the first time may be thats the way it is supposed to be.
But I visited Oh Calcutta,Bhojohari  manna and  find their food more tasty as compared to Ballygunj place.

This place is worth more than a few visit if you have fallen for the Flavours of Bengal and, most importantly, never got the chance to taste the typical Bengali food in your home, because 6 Ballygunge Place does a fair job to bring the taste of "Ma-Kakimar hather ranna" (i.e., home-made Bengali food). You are bound to spend bucks here if you can not get it at your place, right? And this place does make u feel at home with its wonderful service. 

To start with the praises, the menu booklet itself is attractively designed, compiled with lines of Sukumar Ray. The mocktails have been named after famous streets of Kolkata; they strike a nostalgia-chord right at the beginning. My advice, try the 1/1 Bishop Lefroy Rd. once.

The starter section presents a variety of fries. I have tasted only Chhana Motorshuntir Chop and Pomfret Fry and both are really good. The former one is a rare item as I never came across to such a thing at family outings before. But the toughest part that the chefs have managed is to make a wonderful Shuktoni; that is one very delicate piece of Bengali food business. Apart from that, they have experimented a bit with the vegetables and came up with dishes like Navratna Paturi and Chhanar Malai Curry, and I must say, those experiments have paid off! The usual fish and meat items are good, but not worth mentioning, except that Dhonepata Murgi. They also have a Daab Chingri, but a number of prawns within a coconut does not do the trick correctly. It would have been the best to have one jumbo prawn inside a coconut. The desert section is good too. Do not miss out the Nolengurer Ice-cream and Chhanar Malpowa.

If you want to hear some 'cons', the biggest one is the towering cost. If you can not check yourself from having too many things, you might end up with a feeling of being completely robbed off! Another most important point I would like to share, most of the items are as good as those get in your home. While this is a praise for the chef there, my point is, why waste money if you can get it from your mom? :)

One of the finest dining space of Kolkata offering authentic bengali food. Though i have every kind and variety of bengali dishes at home but still it was great to have A1 quality of  a platter of bong food. The shukto of this place makes a special mention, the perfect blend of every ingredients and the soft and juicy 'bori' in them deserves special mention. The mangsher jhol was also light and extremely tasty, a good sized mutton with potato in a very light gravy. jhinge posto was also very good to taste. The place would definitely be a must go for non bongs to catch up with our authentic and exclusive cuisine.

6 Ballygunge Place is located near South Point School and near Chowman.
From outside i will look like you came to somebodys house ,but when you enter you will realise how nice it is.
The ambiance is really great ,with photographs of Calcutta ,Durga Puja  in Black and white effect.
They typical bengali restuarant ,which most of the people love.
They serve best and rarely available foods.
They are always ready to help you.
There are two types Buffet and a-la carte  .
You can celebrate your Birthday ,Wedding,Anniversary there.
There are private rooms reserved for different occasions as per your request.
You should try out chololate sandesh,Dabh Chingri,Iilish macher paturi ,Baked fish .
The price is oviously a bit high as you get so many facilities .
They even serve sagh bajha ,potol baja,daal ,Dhokar dalna  which you will love.
A must visit ,especially if you get a treat from your friend.
I am sure you will feel like visiting there again and again.

When it comes to best Bengali food in the town, then definately this restaurant will be somewhere on the top list to be considered. 

Located at 6, Ballygunge place, it is a little difficult to locate as it is situated in the interior to the Ballygunge Circular road, but many people know and will show you the way. The restaurant is modelled as an old traditional house with high roofs and classic decor resembling the rich Bengali culture.

The staff is very courteous and attentive. The service was pretty decent, no delays whatsoever. I can only remember eating my food whenever I wanted to, the other factors really didnt cross the mind.

Food- is the highlight of the place. We tried Chingri Cutlet and Bhetki Kabiraji. Both were well cooked and neatly served. The taste also reflected the service they offered... 'amazing'. We also ordered narkel-posto bora, sukto, macher matha mug dal, bhapa ilish and Rice. Narkel Bora was a setback.. as felt that the amount of coconut empowered the effect of Posto as I like more posto in the bora. Sukto was one of the best I have eaten so far, reciprocating the same quality and taste they serve in the Salt Lake branch. It is a must try and the taste is worth every penny.  The Bhapa ilish and Macher Matha mug daal was equally admirable. The sheer perfection in cooking will definately lift ur spirits and hunger to a high level.

The dessert - I guess almost everyone who has visited this restaurant has definately tried their famous dessert Nolen Gurer Icecream. Its difficult to describe the taste until you yourself have tasted it. The quality is amazing and its a wonderful closing to your sumptuous and quality meal. Nothing compliments it better.

All in all below are some pros and Cons listed for 6 Ballygunge Place.

Pros:
1. Among the best bengali food restros you will find in the City.
2. Amazing food
3. The nolen gurer ice cream is itself enough to pull people from everywhere.

Cons:
 1. It can burn down a hole in your pocket if you are opting for ala-carte and are carried away by the quality of the food.
2. Location is in interior, so no public transport available. only taxis.

Must Try:
Sukto and Nolen gurer ice cream. You will not regret trying those.


All in all a must try for those who love Bengali food and the ones who want to give it a try. For lower cost options, you can opt for the buffet, but for availing your favourite dishes, go for ala-carte but keep a watch on the budget. Happy eating!!!

ambiance is great. service is good,the food will take some more space.it is advisable to ask the waiter himself about what is good,they have a good idea.rice and munger dal is classic.so is mochar chop.starters are decent.postor bora is disappointing and overpriced.dab chingri has to be eaten to be believed,i think its the best in kolkata restaurants,better than even kewpies.chital maach er muitha is as good as any and better than most.the rest are average 
unfortunately ,the so well advertised bhapa ilish is mostly disappointing.somehow they always manage to make the mustard gravy bitter.it is even more bitter when the bill for the same is presented..
but definitely a place to go to with your friends family s and visitors

Awesome food.  Apart from their famous bhapa elish, kosha mangsho, etc other items off the menu are also memorable. What is remarkable however is how they manage to turn any ordinary every-day dish cooked with simple ingredients like pabda begun bori die or koi macher jhal into something so good that the taste lingers with you. dimer devil and dhania murgi are also excellent. the nolen gurer icecream ofcourse is a must-have. I always feel really happy after a meal in this place, my satiation centre gives me a high-five. every body should visit this place atleast once.

Went for a lunch at this place with my family, at a time when the Uttam Kumar Food Festival was going on. This was supposed to be a spread of food that the famed Bengali actor loved. The fact that both my mother and I liked the food proved the fact that food was good. The ambience was decent enough. The spread consisted of all the typical Bengali fare, wasn’t too oily. The staff was well-informed and well behaved. I consider this as a value for money place. Can be very crowded during weekends so reach early to avoid the long queue.

Good location, good ambiance, a little over hyped and a little over priced....this is exactly what i felt after having food at 6 Ballygunge place. Their signature dish daab chingri was just average, i felt rather it was simple narkel chingri served in a empty tender coconut shell !!!!! Infact elish bhapa and kasha manghsho was not something extra ordinary... anyways quality of food was good [you will not get stomach upset after consuming it] quantity was okay..can be little bit more... the best thing which i liked was malpoya and baked sandesh... sweet lovers will have heavenly satisfaction with their array of sweet dishes.

Heard of the place a lot. Expected it to be overwhelmingly good to sweep away all my previous experiences of Bengali cuisine. But alack!! Ordered Fish Kabiraji, Gondhoraj chicken in the starter ; Kaju kismis Pulao, Eilish Paturi, Rui macher roast and kacha Lanka dhone pata murgi. The food tasted rather flat. Sensed no tantalisingly delicious flavour to tempt the taste buds as the waiters came with the dishes. The quantiy offered per plate is not sufficent even for two. Neither the Flavour lingered nor the taste. But your purse is sure to weigh less. Even Rajbari at Survey Park, Santoshpur, lends a much better experience of having good Bengali food.

a place that over the ages has degraded. you don't get the same food for which the place made its name. the service is too slow and  due to the long transit time the food served is often cold. the kosha mangsho is too bland and a bit undercooked. the only highlight would be the paturi but the amount of mustard added is inconsistent making it the hero on somedays but on other its jus too bitter for my palate.

Very nostalgic, Simple, Silent, Old looking, Neat n clean.
Great combination of the Bengali foods, lot of items, great taste.
All the items are very much popular among Bengali's.
It is tough to select food item at a time.
Aam porar sorbot, Doi Ilish, Chital macher muithya are fabulous...
We (with my Mrs.) waiting for the next time, when we go for it?
Other than weekend it is quite pleasant.

i heard so much from my journalist friends about the food at 6 ballygunj place that i decided to check it out for myself instead of listening to all the hallaballoo. i started with the starters where i ordered pantharas and devil. i liked the duck devil but some how the pantaras was lacking in something may be some parslee which usually added was missing in the keema filling of the pantaras and it was oily. then i ordered the dab chingri and the chingri malai curry, bhapa elish and bhektki paturi the dal char chari and the rice of course.  well the dab chingri i had was not as quiet of the ones had at oh kolkata and i found the prawn a little overdone although the coconut base of the chingri was nice. the bhapa elish was not elish from padma because bhapa elish from dhaka taste much better than elish from bengal. bhekti paturi was quiet good but i thought that the fish tasted more like basa fish, the char chari dal was also good. the aloo posto which was also ordered was deserves  a mention. the deco can be spurced up a bit and the service was not bad location wise its a good place.

Over the years, 6 Ballygunge Place has always been a standout amongst foodies as also non foodies retrospect to college crowd or families. One of the most famous and well known food hub of the city, though has lost the quality of the food and the charm of the place a bit, but still has that awesome and mouth watering "Koi Maach" dish that we all Bengalees love to just brim on it. All in all I would recommend all fellow foodies out there to must try this place and surely I would be going back there soon enough....

I think it's a great place for good bengali food , the fish fry along with the koi Mach bhaaja followed with ilish ,daab chingri and kosh mangshoo  with cholar dal and aloo bhaaja along with lichi and Bhaat surely is a treat , the kosha mangshoo could have been a little better but on an over all  score surely would get back here .

If you are Bengali and can't keep the pride of being so within yourself then drive to this place with your family and share your love for Bengali cuisines with your loved ones. 

You are going to get a touch of Bengal from the building to the way the dishes are served. Even the names of the dishes are going to make you feel like home. Hospitality is a big plus for this place. The Daab Chingri is a top pick over here.

Although i feel the prices are a bit on the higher side, it is definitely the place to go if you are looking for some real bengali cuisine.

It always feels really good when I see Bengali cuisine advertised and delivered in such an excellent manner and 6 Ballygunge Place is a testament to this. Before going into the analysis of the food, I would like to mention that the staff are really courteous and give excellent suggestions. There were 6 of us who went and we had a mix of buffet and a la carte.  The buffet was really good and comprised of chicken, mutton, bhetki paturi as the star items along with excellent alur dam and potol bhaja. The sweets were tremendous. However I wanted to be more analytical and since buffet brings out the unlimited eater in me :) , I went for the following:

haser dimer devil : amazing with duck egg and mutton keema

fish kabiraji: this is a must if you go there because they don't put any unneeded filling than the fish and egg. Yummy!!!!

sada bhat and chital macher muitha: both very tasty, no second words

I would recommend this place to one and all.

'This place here, namely 6 ballygunge place has been there on the top, known for its bengali cuisine for quite a while',that was exactly the thought when I decided to make time and take friends out for a sumptuous bengali lunch. The occasion was treat for my newly landed job. I wanted something special and sought help to mother of all cuisines, bengali cuisine. She came in my dream one thursday night and sermoned " baba, 6 ballygunge place chole ja. Ami okhane shoyong redhe khaoabo" (boy, go to 6 ballygunge place, I myself will cook for you there.) And that was just the catalyst as I made up my mind. So the next saturday, 4 of us took a taxi and entered the ballygunge place via merlin park,table was previously booked ( which is a strong recommendation for weekend lunch). The waiters wearing striped waistcoat made us seated. We felt the interior carries the smell of an old zamindar house, redecorated yet beautifully kept ethnic. The almirah decorated with poramatir ghora ( terracota horse), bauler ektara(one stringed guitar of a bengal  village baul) were just at the perfect harmony with the atmosphere.
To start with, we took macher matha die moongdal and kurkure alubhaja, and the fish kabiraji. These dishes were as close to a bengali mother's kitchen as it gets. The rice was tasty, jhoorjhoore (fine) basmati which is the finest form of carbohydrate to accompany. 
Next came chittol macher muitha and shorshe ilish. God how can I describe how I felt. It was like feeling the lost roots of my eastbengal through the hand made, perfectly bonded muithas. And the ilish, raw emotions of mustard and the inexplicable ilish, once I took a portion of ilish in mouth and then chew the rice blended with mustard, the outside world blended into the piece of indulgence called shorshe ilish.
Next came the mutton kasha blended with rich spices like dried chilli and coriander,combined with rice, the spicyness caused a cauldron of volcanic lava to erupt in our mouth. Rich in taste, aroma and vigor, we ended on the highest note of the concert called lunch at 6 ballygunge place. After all, the dream had to come true.
Recommended strongly for a heart touching eating experience. The narrative is not an over-statement at all , with the aftermath feeling over the moon.

Surprisingly fabulous food for a vegetarian! I had my doubts over the choice and variety available at a Typical Bengali cuisine restaurant, but really fabulous food choices for Veg ppl as well!

The best veg dishes were the kacha aam chenna kasundi chop along with the traditional aloo dhoka, moong dal and mochar ghonto and steamed rice. 

The dinner buffet is rather expensive and offers less choice however. The best choice is to go ala carte. However, I read the review here and went keeping in mind a similar pricing. But it was pretty expensive, about 6k for 3 vegetarians and 4 non-vegetarians combined.

Many a times, I have been to 6BP for the bhetki paturi and bhapa elish that is served. Honestly , the food was  nice but these dishes were brilliant.
My last visit was in the previous week to the ballygunge outlet with my girlfriend for a change to bengali cuisine...
The ambience is very ethnic Bengali , with traditional as well as booth sitting arrangements.Their service and hospitality is very good.The restaurant staffs are helpful in choosing your dishes.They would give a brief description of any dish in demand.

We ordered the most trendy dishes that included :
1.Bengali Fish Fry (two pieces)
2.Posto-Narkel Bara (8 pieces)
3. Radhaballavi
4. Mangsor pulao
5. Bhetki paturi
6. Bhapa Elish
7. Doi Murgi
8. Chutney of the day(Mango Chutni)
9. Chhanar Payesh
10. Nolengurer ice cream

The whole meal was awesome and the taste of their trendiest dish bhetki paturi attracts me to visit again and again.
The batter was crispy, with coarse grained breaded mix, bhetki was fresh and very well marinated with a hint of lemon.

All inclusive, spent around Rs. 1200, for 2 of us.It became a bit expensive as we both r great foodie and as mentioned earlier wanted a change.So just tasted the best dishes..:D
But it can easily be made to about 800 for 2 inclusive tax..
6BP give the best impression to bengali food and the above menu chart is recommended if u want to know the best of them..
I would give 4.5 out of 5.Half marks deducted for being highly priced and not pocket friendly.:( :P

Highly recommended for bengali cuisine lovers!!!!
Cheers!!

Visited this restaurant couple of times with my family. They have an awesome array of authentic Bengali dishes in their menu. I tried fish starters and liked their "Chital Machher Peti" with rice the most. If compared with BHM the price is slightly on the higher side but then they have more unique options on the menu. I'll visit again to try something different dishes. Go with your family and you won't regret it.

I used to go to that place as a child... when it was one of my grand dad's house...... it's strange at times to be back there and setting those rooms as places where people are eating.... but it's a real good diner though it has lost a bit of its shine. savourites their catering part is perhaps better.

it remains a favourite among the Bengals and you should get reservation done for weekends.....
dab chingri ... that is coconut prawn is a must have. their choice of mock tails is quite average.... and avoid chanar devil... had a bad experience when they have us a dish of the same which was only bread crumbs. 
but leaving that experience aside the place never disappoints..... average on decor but good service...

This place is totally different than other popular restaurants which serve authentic bengali food. The ambience is so nice and gives you a comfortable feeling. Their hospitality is good and so is the menu. 

I never knew that a normal Dal Chawal can taste that good, until I visited 6 Ballygunge Place. Since I had already tasted many premium dishes in other restaurants in kolkata, I wanted to try the simple dishes. We were 3 people and we decided to taste both Veg & Non-Veg. We ordered Steam rice, Moong Dal, Alu Bhaja, Alu Jhinga Posto, Mangshor Pulao and other dishes. 

Guess what... I was completely satisfied with just the plain rice and moonga dal with alu bhujia.. The taste of dal was simply superb. And Alu Posto being my life time favourite bengali dish, I just loved tasting it every spoon. :)

Other dishes were also equally good. One must definitely visit 6 Ballygunge Place for its menu and hospitality !!

Recently went there with friends after hearing and reading good reviews about this restaurant. It was my first try at Bengali food outside home cooked food. But I was really very disappointed with my experience there. Apart from the service nothing was impressive. We ordered Chitol Macher Vaja, the fish was smelly to start with. We also ordered Vetki Maasher Paturi which really screwed our appetite. The dish was uncooked and the fish was atleast two three day old. Although they replaced the dish upon complaining, we didn't risk of trying any more fish item. Only the Kosha Mangsher Jhol was worth mentioning. It was excellent.and to sum up our forgettable experience, they added an extra 960 bucks for something we didn't order. Overall I was very disappointed with my experience and would never again visit there.

Good standard food. Prefer to have the alacarte menu over the buffet. A bit expensive for Bengali food but nevertheless easy on the wallet when compared to its competitors. 
Not much experimentation done with the food. Quality and quantity is good. One can give it a shot if he/ she is interested in Bengali cuisine at mid to high rates.

Very good place for Bengali food, and probably a bit easier on the wallet than Oh Calcutta ! Choice of menu is very good. Just went there yesterday and there was a buffet lunch at Rs 375+taxes, but it disappointed badly. We had to take a couple of more items from the menu.
The Daab Chingri, Chitol Machcher Muitha, Doi Murgi and Kakrar Jhaal are some of my favourites.
Desserts are good too.

I remember the last time I was in India 6 BP was in the works and after it was done, my mom, grandpa, brother, Dadua (Mr. Palit) and I tried the food. It was very tasty and the waiters were very nice and helpful. I am coming back this summer! I can't wait.

Visited yesterday afternoon with my fience for the first time though our aim was to visit Kasturi but didn't get seat and we were hungry after our half day office. So took a quick turn and entered 6 Ballygunge place... The ambience was nice and the staff were friendly. There was buffet as well as a-la-carte... But we went for the latter option and the food took us by surprise.

For starter we took gondhoraj chicken and it got 10/10 from us as the taste was excellent... Chicken strips fried in a light batter with a wonderful flavour of gondhoraj lime.. Succulent and delicious

Next we took for main course Kajukishmish pulao, manghsher pulao, Bhetki paturi and chitol macher muitha...

The kaju kishmish pulao remimnded me of my childhood ashtami when dida used to make that same pulao with dehradun rice and loads of kajukishmish and ghee.... Their pulaos are all the same type only the ingredients are different like if u take chingrisr pulo they will toss the boiled rice in ghee and prawn... and whatever other ingredients they put in it... But taste and quantity is good. Same goes for our mangher pulao where mutton replaced kajukishmish..

The bhetki paturi was good and my rating will be 8/10 as  somehow I still searches for the taste that my dida's paturi used to have.... Well still it's a good paturi but my heart still searches for that taste..

Next on the line was chitol macher muitha which I tasted for the first time and it was delicious.. The fish was made boneless and little chunks and it came in a light spicy gravy with potato... Its took my heart awayyy and won the first prize from my side... The gravy was nice and will go great with plain rice.. 10/10 

Dessert was a shortfall as there was only misti doi and rajbhog and the other items were not available so I gave it 0/10.. hehhehehehehehe

But again I got impressed by their dry pan served with sugar coated saunf...

Now coming to the cost part: For two and the above menu our cost was approx Rs1500/- 

PLZZ DON'T WORRY AM COMING BACK AGAIN FOR ANOTHER ROUND ASAP..

And I was NOT disappointed! :) Doi Murgi, Paturi, Luchi-torkari, even the Dab Chingri was awesome! The ambience - pure delectable spirit of Kolkata! The staff were courteous and well-versed in terms of the menu. A tad too expensive for the common man, but a total package for a nice, cosy evening with delicious Bengali food at your side. A must-visit for any foodie in Kolkata, or someone who really wants to get the Bengal charm!

The last time we had the following:

1.Posto Narkel Bora.. good
2.Bengali Fish Fry... very good
3.Chhanar Dalna.. passable.. it was TOO refined for my tastes..
4.Pur Bhara Doi Potol... DIDN'T LIKE this. The Potol was half-cooked and tough.
5.Doi Murgi...GOOD.. but anyone else apart from me didn't like it..guess itz for the ones who are looking for milder tastes.. 
6.Radhaballavi..though the size is huge, it could've been better tastewise..I wish I tried out one of their Pulaos..

It was the Holi evening so they were serving a complimentary Thandai (no, it wasn't spiked with Bhaang lol ) so we skipped out on the mocktails. On occasions like Bhai Phonta etc. there's a massive buffet spread..and A La Carte isn't served. The only minus is that the restaurant is kinda cramped and offers almost nil privacy to the diners. Otherwise the ambience-servers-crowd-locality etc. are good.

P.S. They should take special care in choosing the Bengali instrumentals they insist on playing... Biting into a piping hot delicious fish fry with "Muktiro mondiro shoponotole" in the background completely destroys the experience.. if you know what I mean.

I have come to meet the owner of the restaurant Mr.Palit personally and form that experience I can tell that his colourful attributes are spilled in the restaurant and making it a splendid place to dine-in..His hospitality and warmth is soo heartwarming that one would feel at home while having an autentics bengali "adda"(chit-chat) and some lip-smacking,mouthwatering delicacies..for starters one must must must(this is not an unintentional error,but used consciously to emphasise)mourola macher peyaji..simply mind-blowing..the taste and innovativeness of this particular dish is stunning..for main course the options are really wide and different..from mutton duckbungalow,mutton kosha,daab-chingri,kankra-sorshe to different vegetarian fares will make your taste buds dance in joy..for those having a sweet tooth must try their baked sandesh..out of the wotld..ambiance is classic old-world themed bengali "baithak-khana" styled..in fact i should not make this review more lengthy,simply because I am in love with place and i am afraid i won't be able to stop in time..so i have said a lot,now it's your turn to try..

I used to go to a tuition in Ballygnj Place just opposite to a big old but well maintained house of a big family. The address of this house was 6 Ballygunje Place. But one day I saw that people did not live in this house anymore and this is no longer a house in the first place. That was the birth of 6 BP. 

A good job done creating the homely atmosphere (very obvious, it was a home back in 2003)   Dab chingri and Ilish mach bhapa being the most famous dishes are tasty and worth it. Every other dish that I tried were tasty too but our Ma's and dida's at home are equally good at making these bengali dishes so I felt at home. :)

For food: 4/5
For ambiance: 4/5

I dislike Bengal in general and the same sentiment creeped into my opinion towards Bengali food as well - until one day I went to 6 Ballygunge Place. Possibly the only Bengali restaurant in the world that doesn't reek of fish stink and has spotlessly clean table cloth, on every table !

The staff was super nice ( compared to all the other places in Calcutta that I had visited) - were patient enough to explain everything on the menu and help us make decisions.

The Malai Curry ( Prawns in Coconut Curry) were just out of the world - Delicious !

The Begun Basanti was equally impressive and the Eilish Paturi ( boneless fish) was the winner of the food parade.

Considering the only Mishti Doi we had been eating all these years came from Mother Dairy, the one served here was a million notches above. I still never liked Mishti Doi though.

We went there several times again, tried most of the things on the menu - and superb quality on every occasion.

Don't get fooled by their other branch in Salt Lake - this one is the real deal.

The prices are extremely reasonable, for 1500 two people can eat & drink like they just arrived from Bangladesh. ( although it is quite expensive by Calcutta standards, btw).

Thanks to Ballygunge place, my faith in humanity and respect for Bengal was restored.( which was taken back again by the driver of the dirty yellow ambassador on the way back.)

A MUST VISIT restaurant in Calcutta.

I have been to 6 Ballygunge Place quite a number of times. Most of them were with Bengali friends living out of the city. They crave for Bengali food once they are in the city. And 6 Ballygunge Place is a good option.

First let me list the absolute delights - Dab Chingri, Ilish Machher Paturi, Hasher Dimer Devil. These are simply out of the world. The rest like - Chingri Machher Malaikari, Bhetki Machher Paturi etc. are very good too. Their meat - chicken or mutton was okay. And I didn't like their Vegetarian dishes. It was either too sweet or too rich or both and didn't taste right.

The Lunch Buffet they offer is good for the price but the Fish Fry is inevitably slow to come and you have to make a serious effort if you want a second helping.

I confess that I don't have a sweet tooth, hence can't really comment on the desserts.

Went there late on a Sunday afternoon. Had the buffet, which was good. Nothing fantastic, but there were two dishes that stood out - the Bhetki Paturi and the Mutton Dakbangla. A fellow-diner was particularly appreciative of the softness of the mutton. The staff were helpful and brought certain items that should be eaten piping hot to the table.

I did notice that the restaurant was running out of certain items that were on the bufffet menu. While the fish, chicken and mutton dishes were replenished regularly, some of the vegetarian dishes were not. The restaurant might consider stocking up on those items, or reducing the duration of the buffet. Another problem was that the Mishti Doi had turned to slush because most of the diners did not know how to cut portions out of the earthen pot - it might make sense for a waiter to perform this service. 

The only major problem with the place is the lack of space. Tables are clustered together, especially in the room to the left of the buffet table. The buffet table itself is difficult to access on account of a large centre table that is meant for diners.

A GREAT bengali restaurant.....the food is authentic and the price is fabulous..Yeah okkay many bengali friends of mine keep quibbling that its expensive,but that's probably because they could hardly go figure that the authentic local cuisine their grannies whip up could cost anything at all...Seriously, 6BP is quite acceptable price wise.food here is good..and the service is acceptable as well. One thing thats really worth mentioning is the wonderfull desserts they offer.A pleasant experience,and definately worth a visit.

Visit this place you are never going to regret it. I went with my fiance a week before my marriage. The food never tasted better with her. 

jokes apart, the must visit to this place if you want to try authentic bengali food. 

STAFF - The staff is friendly and have all knowledge of food how it is preapred. They will try to make you comfortable.

TASTE - The food is what it should have been originally prepared. All the preparations like sukto, veg preparations, fish, mutton, daab chingri everything is so authentic. 

If you want someone to love you more take them there.

I recently visited 6 Ballygunge place for lunch and ordered a few things right off their menu, starting off with the posto narkel bora and gondhoraj chicken with rice as starters, with chholar dal and mangshor jhol to follow. The chicken and bora were good, while the chholar dal, I found, was too sweet for my taste. However, the disappointment was the mangshor jhol. We had ordered it thinking it to be something which would involve melt-in-your-mouth pieces of meat and aloo and rice. However, the meat was tough, and not cooked fully. Also, I found a faint smell, which indicated that the meat was not too fresh. 

We opted for a dessert and the service was quite slow, and we had to ask twice before getting a response. The chhanar payesh in chocolate shell was good, but too cold, if there's such a word. 

Our bill was not earth shatteringly high, and I do like the food quality in general. However, they should pay more attention to the goat meat quality.

A good Bangali restaurant.
Ambience: The restaurant is done up in a typical shekeley style with a few modern touches as well. Personally I loved the heritage feel of the place.
Service: I absolutely loved their service! The waiters in dhoti-panjabi were very cordial and prompt. So a thumbs up!
Food: According to this foodie, the Bengali food at 6 Ballygunge Place is among the top five in the city! The buffet spread is also very well thought out and versatile. 
Recommendation: Try their buffet! And also the Nolen Gurer ice cream...aha! :)

bhapa ilish and nolen gurer ice-cream... the reason i'll go to 6BP again!! the food they serve has an amazing blend of spices and that's what makes the food so special and very bengali. I love spending on food and 6BP did not let me down :)

When it comes to Bengali Cuisine, I am extremely particular and also sensitive. The rating would have been better had I gone there without any feedback. I have been hearing about this place from many of my friends for a long time. Most of them told me it is a cheaper edition of Oh Calcutta! 

I would say, it was not a pleasant experience after going there. Let me first tell you the better side of the story. 

Ambiance was perfect. Decor was also very good. You will find it a bit hard to park your car, but I am sure you will surely get a place within 400 meters of the place. 

Now coming to food.
Comments of some of their delicacies:
 
Begun Bhaja & Posto Narkel Bora - Really good. 
Gondhoraj Chicken - This one was the best non-veg dish among those which I tasted.  
Chital Macher Muitha - Utter disappointment. No way you can even compare it with what you get in Kasturi. 
Kasha Mangsho  - Was good but somehow I felt it was old stock cooked again. Mutton pieces were not uniformly cooked. It may happen that there was a mix of old and new stock.   
Sukto - I think they should stop preparing this dish immediately. How come Sukto becomes such a spicy affair? The essence of this dish are the spices and the aroma. The rich thick gravy was unwanted. I would not give even a 1 star for this dish. 

Now comes my utter disappointment, the Dab Chingri. - I would never recommend this one to anyone going to 6BP. The dish they prepared was not the authentic Dab Chingri. It wither should be removed from the menu card or they change the recipe. Also the quality of prawn was not good and I could smell they were old stock re-cooked. It was totally a bad choice for us. 

The best part of our lunch was surely the Nolengurer Icecream. This dish only makes me feel elated to write a review. 

Having said it all, I think this is not a place so bad. And possibly worth a visit again. The reason is the menu spread is so large, that I may go back to taste other dishes as well. I am sure they will read the reviews seriously and make some changes in the recipe. Sorry for being so critical but I feel as a fellow Bengali, I must say what I feel.

Many a times, I have been to the City Center branch of this joint, for the lunch buffet that is served. Honestly , the food was nice, but, never brilliant.
For the first time, last week, I went to the Ballygunge branch of 6BP, and was pleasantly surprised ! ! !
We were the first guests and had a lot of time to order. The ambience was very ethnic Bengali , with traditional as well as booth sitting arrangements.
We ordered a dinner thali which included :
1. Luchi
2. Rice
3. Dhokar Dalna
4. Daal
5. Bhetki Paturi
6. Kasha Mangsho (Mutton)
7. Chingri Malakari (two galda prawns)
8. Plastic Papaya Chutni

We also ordered a Breaded Fish Fry (two peices on a paltter), a portion of Posto-Narkel Bara (8 pieces if I remember correctly) , 1 Alu Bhaja , 1 Basanti Polao , 1 Chichen Curry.

The dinner thali was very filling and the food was tasty, with a Rs. 650/- price tag. Mutton was soft and the prawn was fresh. The Malakari Curry was sweet, to the perfect extent !
The biggest surprise was the Fish Fry. We were a bit skeptical ,whether, to order a Fish Fry platter, in a through-and-through Bangali restaurant. But , it turned out to be the clincher ! !
The batter was crispy, with coarse grained breaded mix, bhetki was fresh and very well marinated with a hint of lemon.

All inclusive, spent around Rs. 2000, for 3 of us, with 1 dinner thali and 2 a-la-carte orders.
A tad expensive but money well spent ! !

Highly recommended !

I absolutely love Bengali food .... unlike earlier there are a number of good restaurants where one can appease their craving for this delicious cusine. 6 Ballygunge Place has been around for a while and have earned the reputation of being one of the finer restaurants that serve Bengali  Food in Kolkata. We started with the Pantharas which were spot on and delicious..... we loved them, we also ordered the Bengali Fish Fry which was quite superb and one of the best fish fries I have had in the city. For our main course we ordered kosha mangsho and phulgobir roast with a mix of luchi,karaishutir kachori, porotha and steamed rice. We felt a bit let down by the mutton which was undercooked and hard and extremely spicy however when we called the manager and complained he immediately offered us a replacement. For dessert we had their delicious nolen gur ice-cream and the malpua with vanilla ice cream. All in all a good experience !

When I stepped in here one evening I found it peaceful and homely, later on as I was going through my food adventure there I came to know that some years ago it was indeed a family house until they turn it into 6 Ballygunge Place. 
I ordered for a Non-veg Thali and let me tell u dear reader, its a lot to eat for one, until you are one big eater, so every Thali falls small in front u. So I ended up being packed with food until my neck (Imagine!) and fortunately all good food. Those who have tasted good Bengali food before they know how it can carry you on to overeating, so was my case. In my platter there was almost everything starting from Luchi, Rice, Begun Bhaja, Chanar Dalna, Kasha Mangsho, Prawns,Mochar Ganto, chutney. I will specially mention the Chanar Dalna, it was so subtle and so very good, this dish was talking softly and for me it was the star of the whole Thali. I have tasted Chanar Dalna which is Cottage Cheese Dumplings in a  light Tomato Gravy in so many places but this was the best I tasted in a restaurant. Truly subtle and  exuberant. Also, I will mention the Kasha Mango( mutton slowly cooked in spices) was also something that made me happy. The Prawn Malaikari was ok, so was the fried aubergine.
As I said for someone who has never eaten Bengali food before, this place will make you happy and satisfied, wanting for more, the food is not overly spicy and in most cases they are truly Bengali delicacy to venture into. The off-white rooms carry a sense of peace in them which is a plus point as I see and for someone who eats Bengali food in abundance this place will not blow your mind off but will make u happy.
As for the money this is on the upper side. Yes, a bit costly and as for me moneys worth. Though I know places which serves great quality food at much lesser the price, the ambience is decent, nothing flashy or spectacular, it has a homely feel rather. The staff is ok, I can't say they are very polite or helpful, though they should be. The good food experience won't be complete without a good human interaction.

Perhaps would like to go there again, so if you on the deciding moment pondering, I will say do give it a try, it will make u happy :) so, Bon Apetit!

We went at 6 B thorugh word of mouth from one of my bengali friend in Toronto canada, the moment we stepped inside, we felt that we are not invited because of our non-bengali back ground. the service staff was just doing their part because they had to and it's a part of their job. let me come to the main aspect  of our whole sordid experince of the food. we ordered 2 prawn malai curry and guess what....it was raw. as if the chef was not in a mood to do his job properly. we did'nt ate anything else, after this traumatic and humiliation experience at 6 B. i would definately  inform non bengali food lovers to call this joint ahead whether they will serve non bengali patrons without being biased and discriminatory attitude. Before i end, i would say 6 B, you have just lost a huge corporate business account.

sincerely

My da threw his reception party here. One big problem with place is that their banquet hall is on the 2nd and 3rd floor. So for aged people or people with problem in climbing stairs it becomes difficult. however, I found the staff to be extremely well-behaved and friendly and they particularly made sure to help people finding problem with the stairs. Perhaps they should arrange for a lift if possible for such occasions.

Now coming to food: Mochar chop with coffee : awesome. kaju-kismis polau was good and Bhatki paturi was sooooo yum that I had atleast 5 paturis :P However, the kachalonka dhonepata Murgi was disappointing and not upto the mark. The ending with baked sandesh and vanilla ice-cream with chocolate sauce was heavenly. and how can I forget to mention the gandhoraj ghol!!! One must taste that tooo ... this menu was a part of the buffet we choose. I just mentioned my favs. There were other items too but they could not live up to my expectations.

Went here a few times over last couple years, and found the place sadly lacking. The old building and exterior is inviting, and we went in expecting a taste of old Bengal. Instead, the interiors were very shabby, the a.c. didn't work, and the whole place had that stale food smell. Food itself was mediocre at best, far surpassed by places like Oh Calcutta (although they do have different price points so maybe that comparison is unfair). Went there after seeing a cooking show on tv that extolled their virtues, but will probably give the place a miss in future.

I think this was the first venture from the house of Savourites. Palit & Ramani over the last few years have dabbled in many gourmet affairs of which 6B & The Wall stands out the most. 

Folks anyone can open a restaurant, run it for few years, but running it consistently and surviving the market moods and competition now that's another story. 

One will be intrigued by the menu as it features many traditional Bengali dishes, one palatable to our bengali tastebud, only with lot more spices and oil than we are used to at home. 

Top picks

Luchi, Chholar Dal & Begun Bhaja
Posto Narkel Bora
Gondhoraj Chicken
Mochar Chop
Dhokar Dalna
Pabda Jhal (depends on the quality of fish)
Chital Macher Muitha
Lal Murgi
Kasha Mangsho (spicy) 
Nolengurer Icecream (whoever came up with gr8 job dude) 

For those who hail from a Bengali epicurean family, don't waste your precious penny on 

Doi Pona 
Tel Koi
Hisla (most of it bad and it's tastes frozen fish)
Malai Curry & Dab Chingri (they don't know how to make this)
Aloo Jingha Posto (this I make better than 6B chef)
and most of Veg dishes ... Ask your mom I'm positive she will do a better job :D 

Overall, once in a while a place to be considered while dining out. For those who aren't Bengali, folks this is as close you will get to a Bengali meal in a restaurant. 6B is a good attempt to suffice the contemporary urban citizen's culinary excursion for the genuine and authentic Bengali cuisine; for me - close but no cigar, for you - worth a try. Enjoy.

The problem with this place is it has no consistency.
I think their chef suffers from mood disorders !
Last year when my friend was about to get married I threw her 'Aiburobhaat' here and the food was quite tasty and everything was perfect to the core ! The malpua - should be mentioned and is a MUST TRY dish.

But when I went there after a few months everything  what we had ordered previously was such a let down ! The Kosha Mangsho was watery, Bhetki Macher Paturi had few mach and more masala, all in all a bad experience.

I think if the chef is in a good mood then only one should go here so please call in advance and   ask him properly whether he is in the mood to cook PROPER food ! Haha

Of the two starters we ordered, the Prawn finger rolls were mediocre -- too much bread crumbs, while the sauted chicken was quite good -- tender, not too overdone. Unfortunately the starter list is too heavy on fried stuff.

We tried the thali for dinner -- overall a very good experience. Large, fluffy luchis served piping hot, with complementary alur dum, dal and kosha mangsho. The latter was over-peppered and drowned in sauce, thus masking the taste of the meat.
The paturi Bhetki was excellent, though it could be rather sharp for those unaccustomed to the heavy mustard dosage. The prawns were again disappointing -- clearly the same material is used for both the finger rolls and the malai curry, simply by putting the prawns into the pre-made curry. This was well below the standard we expected here.

The mistis were also good -- apparently they make them in house

Contrary to the experience of some others here, service was excellent!

Look forward to trying their chitol maach next time :)

We took advantage of a Groupon coupon to grab ourselves buffet lunches at INR 199 each.

Food I felt was below par. The menu was not very carefully selected either. Its almost 10 pm now and the food is still sitting heavy in our stomachs. Our observations are:

1. Like its Salt Lake brethren, the Ballygunge Place outlet too is cramped. The first table offered to us would almost be playing jigsaw puzzle with another one. So we shifted to another, though not much better table.

2. The staff were more interested in checking our coupons in the beginning. THey later redeemed themselves, because the Groupon coupons were indeed faulty and not being accepted by the system, but they were nice about it and finally it was resolved.

3. The only real fried item was begun bhaja, well enough done. It was accompanied by alu with some other green sheddho.

4. There was a dal which I didn't taste. The shorshe shim was nice enough. The alu dam was downright awful. The luchis, served on the table were fair.

5. The non-vegetarian selection didn't quite impress. A parshe bhuna (just thick gravy I guess) was rather tasteless. The fish perhaps needed to be somewhat larger too. There was an interesting spinach with prawn, but one needed to find those elusive creatures. The doi chicken was bland. The mutton curry thankfully tasted better than it looked, but I didn't see too many nice pieces.

6. The combination wasn't too nice. I would have hoped for a fish fry or a paturi to make the meal more enjoyable, more memorable. Additionally there was just no magic in the cooking. Just like any mediocre caterer's offering.

7. Dessert was a bit better. Apart from papad and chatni, there was a fair mishto doi, but one that tended to break up too easily. The chhanar malpoa could have been deeper fried though. They were both, thankfully, not over sweet.

8. Mint saunf and Kolkata paan masala was served at the table post meal.

Not a patch on most buffets I'm afraid.

In case you are looking for a place to try out bengali cuisines at a comparitively reasonable price, this is the place I would vouch for. The waiting period was the most annoying bit of the whole experience. Once we got a place to sit ourselves in, the menu made me clap my hands in glee. The food was delectable and I loved the pulao. In fact, all the preparations were great. We ordered mangsher pulao, chingri pulao, chingri malai curry, kosha mangsho, jhuri aloo bhaja and luchi. I loved the names that they had conjured up for the mocktails. Would have appreciated if someone could tell me what the importance of those addresses were, if any. The seating is a little conjusted for my liking, but some could call it cosy too. Hit this place!

A Bengali could have all the Italian, Mexican or Chinese he wants to, but at the end of the day nothing can beat Kasha Mangsho, Elish Korma or some Pantharas. 6 Ballygunj Palace is quiet rightfully considered to be one of the best Bengali restaurants in Kolkata. With an array of authentic Bengali dishes and a quiet a few innovative creations the menu is sure to make your mouth water. I might as well add that the mocktail section was a nice touch with all the drinks named after important streets of old Calcutta. Every other Bengali I know is an avid lover of seafood. For them, this humble restaurant near the Phari is a pilgrimage spot. Prawns, Crab, Barramundi, Hilsa, Rohu, Pomfret and what not. The Radhaballavi with Cholar Dal here is just to die for. There are a few downsides however. The waiting room is a separate area within the restaurant's compound, which is no better maintained than the tool shed in my backyard. The waiters could probably do better by actually doing their homework before coming up to take the order. And even tough they have tried to bring the traditional Bengali household ambience to the "place",they have missed the bull's eye by several inches.
This place is a must visit for a Bengali foodie who wants to come back to his roots.

I am not a big fan of Bengali food...but yes i do find the food of 6 Ballygunge Place decently well cooked. May be its my prejudice against the food as i almost have these foods every day at my home since i am a bong. But from non bong perspective...the Food is the best offered in Kolkata. I took my Bosses who are biggies from Mumbai as they wanted to eat Bengali Food and not in Oh ! Calcutta . I took them to this place near to my house and was praying hard that i dont get fired for this experiment. After the lunch was over the silence prevailed till i recieved an sms from my boss..."Thanks Anandi!! I have never thought that authentic Bengali food would be so delicious....Thanks for making me experience this."

I should admit it is one of the best Bengali food hub in Kolkata. The people were very friendly. Also the food was served in proper timing. They not never late in serving. Couple of dishes from the menu like the "Gondhoraj Chicken", "Doi Chicken", "Mangsher Polau" and "Chingrir Malaikary" were really really excellent. Would definitely suggest others.

If you are craving for tasty Bengali cuisine away from home in a very Bengali environment, knock here. I had preordered from a la carte for an evening out with family and was not disappointed. 

Of course if you are looking for fancy decor, english speaking staff and the works, better go to Oh Calcutta. This is a small cozy restaurant where your granny would feel comfortable as it serves its basic purpose - good food.

I would recommend friends or family dinners here.

I was just surprised to see that how it is NO.1???? Ambience is very dull and according to me food is just flavourless and staffs are not at all well-trained. I had  Ilish bhapa and paturi,they were absolutely tasteless and pricing is not worth. I went three days back. It has totally lost its standard and its not at all the best place for having bengali cuisine. I would rate only 2 stars for it. Second of all,it is not situated in a well-known place and the worst thing was that staffs could not talk in english properly. Sitting arrangement is okay but i want it to improve especially the food quality and quantity. No suggestion goes to people for having food here.

6 Ballygunj place has been my favorite always. Whenever it's a family lunch or dinner we just know the place to be. Whenevr it's the ilish season we just can't wait to taste the smoked hilsa or the tpshe fish fry when its not our favourite fish saeson. An ardent lover of fish i rarely try chicken dishes. But the Kosha Mangsho dis is just too good to not try. Also tle simple Dal and aloo bhaja is worth the money spent both because of the taste and the quantity. having nemed such mouth watering wonders i just cannot wait for the Durga festive season to be here! Just another excuse to dig in the dishes at 6 Ballygunj Place!

Given that an establishment like 6 Ballygunge Place is known for serving bengali cuisine, I cannot imagine why someone would go there looking for non-bengali cuisine.

For a non fish-eater, the kosha mangsho does one justice as does my favorite chholaar daal with steamed rice and jhuri bhaja, a staple which some places can get wrong, surprisingly. 

One of the items which did alter my dislike for fish, is the Bhetki Paturi, which is quite delicious. 

A must-try dessert is their homemade mishti doi, which never fails to please the palate. 

I'd recommend this place for it's authentic bengali food.

The lunch buffet is the one to go for. I never imagined i could take second helpings of a mere "saak bhaaja" or a "alu bhatey". The aam pora shorbot is a must have though it's such a tiny serving that it leaves you craving for more. Fish is a must have, especially the bhetki paturi. I did not care much for the kosha mangsho though, specially after the wonderful fish & chingri malaikari. They make even a simple lucchi-begunbhaja taste like a million bucks. I have also tried the thali that they serve for dinner & although it was quite good, it was too much for one person & does not have the advantage of the buffet that you can avoid the things you don't want & have more of the ones you do. Plus it tends to go cold by the time you even reach the fish. So take time out to go for the lunch buffet, you will know why bengali food is the best cuisine in the whole wide world. High prices though.

Medium expensive really good tasty Bengali foods make me return back to them at a regular interval. U can eat good Hilsa at any season for a moderate cost, best is mutton and misti polao. They offers a wide buffet.



----- 25 Sep, 2012 -----

I prefer this restaurant over Oh Calcutta now a days as its price are more reasonable for the Bengali food, also they have homely atmosphere and staffs are helpful. By some means, the food seems more tasty than any other bengali restaurant in Kolkata, I give them 5 out of 5.

Was here with a couple of friends of mine !..We ordered for radhabollobii, dab chingri, paturi and  doi murgi..Brilliantly cooked and exquisitely presented to us..  The mocktails and drinks were very good too. The service was really pleasant, although the food takes a little more time to get served here compared to other places but the food makes it worth the wait.. being a traditional bengali and eating at this place..Often reminds me of my granny's cooking ! fabulous i would say.. would rate is as 3.5

It is a good family restaurant.The food there gave me a feeling of a typical bengali home made food which is great specially dal muro-ghonto and fish kabiraji,rui shorshe was excellent;the smell of shorshe goes perfectly well with warm rice.The paan at the end completes the bengali cuisine.
The interiors brings us back to our tollywood film industry.

Love the place for its food, but good food doesn't come cheap. The food is very very good. Very original bengali food. 

But go there with sufficient time for dinner - the reasons are 
1. you need time to enjoy and savour the food (which is very good)
2. The staff takes so much time to deliver the order (which is not so good, particularly when you are hungry)

But overall experience will be quite pleasing if you are not looking for value for money.

The best Bengali Cuisine serving restaurant in the city. The quality of the food is awesome. I like the simplicity in their food. The dishes are mostly mild, not extra spiced, no extra oil and just perfectly seasoned.

The decor is also good and they have very well behaved stuff. Seats may be a problem in a holiday, it is advisable that you hit the restaurant in early lunch/dinner hours.

The decor is mainly old calcutta items and they continuously play soft instrumental music which creates a nice old calcutta mood.

Some great items that I found over here are
1. Bhetki Paturi/ Bhetki Ganga Jamuna
2. Doi Sorshe Pomfret
3. Palak Chhanar Kofta
4. Murgir Kanchalonka Dhonepata jhol
5. Mangsher Jhol
6. Fish Fry
7. Koraishuir Kochuri along with Bhaja Mosla Aloor dom
8. Chital Peti
9. Dab Chingri
10. Nolen Gurer Ice Cream (must try)
11. Chingri macher bati chochhori

Now you have to hit the restaurant and try it out. My vote for the best bengali restaurant goes to 6 Ballygunje Place.

The food, authentic Bengali cuisine, is simply lovely. The price range is similar to Oh! Calcutta. This means it is one of the expensive restaurants in the city - but you get your money's worth here. Located very close to Patha Bhavan High School and South Point, the restaurant is easy to locate. However, for a full family meal for four, be prepared with about Rs.3500 if you want to enjoy a complete experience. Service is good but...the waiters -some of them at least give you the cold shoulder if they are not happy with the tip. A bad experience after a good meal - something that you would not find at Oh! Calcutta. So, conditions apply...

Probably one of the best Bengali restaurants in Calcutta. The ambiance is simple and elegant with dim lighting and classical Bengali music playing in the background. The food is mouth-watering. I personally have eaten their lunch buffets many times and have always left extremely satisfied. Their lunch buffet is very reasonably priced and boasts of 3 vegetarian items along with 3 non vegetarian items excluding rice and the bengali favorite 'Luchi' and deserts; which are also included in the buffet. On the weekends, the restaurant has Special Bhoj where they add more food items to the buffet.
If you want to experience real Bengali food that melts in your mouth then 6 Ballygunge Place is the one!

Food was very good; the waiters were polite if not super efficient; speed of service was good for a Saturday lunch crowd that was just picking up.

The menu is quite extensive and innovative.

The decor is tasteful but adjustments need to be made.  Walls need to be cleaned and touched up; the fan in one of the sections runs only on high speed; and there are a few other small details that could be improved.

However, as far as the food goes, this place is definitely worth a return visit.

1. Good clean Bengali authentic cuisine

2. Do your homework, staff is not trained

3. Expensive

4. Very long wait times are normal - service is not the strong point

5. As pointed out by most reviewers, do not go here if you are pampered with delicious home made Bengali food everyday. Most people of the rat race who do not have access to laboriously cooked home made Bengali preparations are the ones clamouring for this restaurant.

Yesterday, on 13th May, 2012 (World Mother's day), I went there for the first time, along with my 72-years old mother and my 9-years old son, in public conveyance, and in a very ungorgeous & simple attire. Outside was scorchy sun, at about 1:15PM. At the entrance, security told "yes, seats available". Then, after entering the first door, right side, reception-man on being asked, said that seats were not vacant. Then on being told about what security-man said, he said how can a security-man know that. Then he didn't say anything, and after a few moments' pause, we went outside. That man's gesture & talking were not rough, but, extremely cold; and, he never advised us to wait. So, at this, we went  to another place for lunch. Thought came to my mind that the man ignored us due to a very different & simple appearance compared to other customers entering that eatery; however, of course, there was no straightforward evidence; I couldn't read his mind. Next, we went to another eatery on Purna Das road (Tero Parbon), where also seats were full, but they welcomed us inside and got us waited on a sofa for about fifteen minutes, before directing us to a dining table.

My girlfriend and I went in search for an authentic Bengali cuisine and after reading all the reviews we decided to try 6 Ballygunge out, was a little difficult to find the place but somehow reached and at first glance it looked like just another home in the block but once we got inside we were greeted with a fresh bong aroma. We ordered stuff lamb paranthas as starters, dab chingri (brilliant concept of prawns in a coconut which tastes even more brilliant) and bekthi jab ( the most tender fish I have ever had) and rice. The use of mustard was prominent in all the dishes which both of us loved and for the dessert we had Payas in chocolate shells and Nalun gur ice cream, both were out of this world. Even though it was on the expensive side the whole homely experience was worth it, this is a must visit for all if you are in Calcutta !!!!

Being in Calcutta for past 6 months have heard quite a bit about this restaurant. But it turned out to be a sad affair visiting the restauarant, the food was just okay. But the major let down was the hospitality. The staff had no cue on the cusine, random serving of dishes and definitely not at all cordial. There are a lot better places in Kolkata for Bong food.

An official visit to kolkata, made me craving for an ethnic Bengali meal, and here I had a friend who was quick enough to help me out. We set off from AJC Bose road to Ballygunge. 

6 Balleygunge Place is located in the corner house and is also the address of this restaurant. Unlike conventional restuarants, there wasn't a single hall, the seating area was segregated as per the rooms layout.

When in Bengal eat Maach (fish) so we ordered Fried Bhetki for starter with Mustard sauce. Nice & crisp. The tone for the dinner was set.

We ordered Begun Basanti (brinjals in curd based curry), Macher Matha Diye Moong Dal (Fish Head cooked in Moong Dal), Kasha Mangsho (Bengali mutton curry), plain rice and Plain Crisp Parathas. 

The begun was simply awesome, while as much I tried I couldn't resist the kasha mangsho, the dal along with the head made a distinct taste along with the rice.

For dessert we ordered Misthi Doi (sweet curd) as the Baked sandesh usually takes 15 mins..I would suggest go for two as it is heavenly.

No reason why this place does not deserve 5 stars. Some news for the drinkers..the place does not serve alcohol.

I have just visited this place with my family - awesome experience.

The restaurant is actually situated in someone's house in posh colony of Ballygunje. We ordered Luchi, Ada lanka chicken and Aloor Dam - all tastes euqally brilliant. In dessert, we ordered their signature 'Nalen Gurer Ice Cream' - which was out of the world.

I liked the ambience too - all Tagore songs were playing throughout. The menu card is simply amazing. 

Pricing: On the higher side, per Kolkata standards; but worth a try. 

Service: Though waiters were well-informed, they need more politeness and should be more prompt in their service.

Overall Rating: I would say 4 out of 5.

A colleague of mine took me to this place on a recent business trip to Kolkata.My only exposure to Bengali cuisine prior to this has been a few visits to "Oh Calcutta" at Nehru Place,in Delhi.

10 Balleygunge Place is the name as well as the address of this restaurant. The joint operate out of an old bungalow at Balleygunge. The interesting fact about the place is that the owners have not relayed the interior walls. So the seating area is segregated in several sections, which were perhaps different rooms of the house. Our table was in a room which was might have been the bedroom of an old Bengali gentleman.

So, coming back to food:

Our order was Fried Bhetki for starters followed by Kasha Mangsho (mutton ),chholar dal, plain rice and loochi ( puri ). For someone who has survived his entire life on a hardcore Punjabi / Mughlai food, the food was a welcome change. Fried fish was simple amazing. I had heard stories of mutton, which melts in your mouth, but I experienced it for the first time in my life with Kasha Mangsho. It actually does melt in your mouth.
The restaurant even makes the humble chana dal come alive with taste. 

Great food.

For dessert we ordered Sandesh and Gur ice cream. I don't think should comment on Bengali sweets as words would not do justice to the same. 

Anyone visiting the city of joy....do drop in for a bite. It will be a great eating experience. And, you should go here for dinner instead of lunch. Reason? 
The food is so great you will definitely end up over stuffing your self. So, if you have any plans of working post lunch, it is going to require some superhuman effort.

Located in the heart of the city, 6 Ballygunge Place is the name for the perfect authentic Bengali delicacies.

Restaurants have their individual characters, signature and inimitable features, but almost by some tacit understanding or 
telepathy, the personality of its cuisines has remained intact. Chingri Machher Kabiraji, Daab Chingri and the regular Chanar 
Daal are just awesome. Moreover, the tempting aroma of the servings are enough to tingle your every taste bud. The wooden 
furniture and the clean interior with the paintings about Bengali heritage creates the perfect mood.

To taste the authentic bengali flavours, the unanimous vote would go to 6 Ballygunge Place.

One of the better places in Kolkata that serves authentic Bengali cuisine with a touch of elegance. The restaurant itself provides a complete ambiance of Bengali culture. The rates are slightly on the higher side compared to Kolkata standards but the detail taken to prepare the dishes offsets this. A must visit for anyone who is going to Kolkata.
