Well to be honest I am not a big fan of South Indian dishes except I love Dosa.The quality is awesome,not only that the sambar and chutney they served was really impressive and tasty.We ordered Dhaniya Butter Masala Dosa which is really delicious than the other.Though Rava Masala Dosa was also good.The price was also reasonable.Overall,it was a nice experience.Hope will be there soon.

This place is truly a hidden gem when it comes to south indian food. 
They have a wide range of food items including desserts in their menu but sadly i have only tasted their dosas which are a delight to the mouth.
 
I keep on coming back to this place just to taste their
 
MYSORE BUTTER MASALA DOSA
PODI CHEESE DOSA
PLAIN CHEESE DOSA
AND THEIR FILTER COFFEE which tastes heaven. 

Not only the food. The waiters are polite and courteous.
I am really looking forward to try out their different dishes.
The rates i feel are reasonable for what they are offering and the food quality is really top notch. 
Would love to recommend this place whole heartedly .

One of the best South Indian food joints in the city. I went there with a group of friends for some evening snacks. We had Cheese Onion uttapam, Cheese Rava Dosa and their famous filter coffee. The food is very good and takes you to the kitchens of South India. The filter coffee is brilliant and the best accompaniment for a great evening with your loved ones. The uttapam and dosa were soft and crispy and cheesy in taste. 
The ambience also gives a South India feel, the dishes are served in banana leave and the coffee in a steel glass. It's a must visit!

Among d best South Indian restaurant in Kolkata..  Every dish here is perfect n d service is really quick... One must try here the typical South Indian thali which consists of 2 3 veggies, rasam, curd, sweet, Puri, rice, 2 types of sambhars, etc... it's really yum.. der is 1 mini thali which vl provide u wid all items such as 1 Idli, 1 vada, mini dosa , sweet.. it's a complete South Indian meal ... Apart from dis all other varieties r equally Good.. Those who like sweets den it's a place where u have suji halwa in different flavours as in pineapple, orange, dey also keep sevai.. every day dey have different sweets bt 1 for d day... Definitely it's a place to visit n pocket friendly too...

When it came to South Indian food the first thing that used to come to my mind was, "Man not that same old idli or dosa again". ¬†This place has majestically broken that stereotypical notion of mine.¬†

Located at Hemanta Mukhopadhyay Sarani, (Landmark: near Vivekananda Park), this place is an ideal place to enjoy a humble meal with your close ones. The menu is deliciously authentic.¬†

Recently I was invited to a bloggers meet to enjoy a humble breakfast spread at this eatery. ¬†So, I would like to take a moment to thank

The tranquillity of Vivekananda Park and my own sense of peace after a tedious work-week complement each other.¬† I was relaxed and laid-back. Banana Leaf has always been my go to place for South Indian Cuisine. There is something non-superfluous, yet welcoming about¬† this place and its people.

As I am alwz a south indian food lover..so obviously I loved this place. 
So we ordered 1 plate idli and 1 plate masala dosa.
Both of them were tasty and light ..so I liked it.

I didn't want to cook today and decided to take my parents and grandparents to Banana Leaf, Vivekananda Park. What can I say, but it was the best south Indian food I've ever eaten. The delicately made dosas paired with delectable coconut chutney was so good that we ended up ordering a second helping for all of us. Though there was a lot of rush in the restaurant today due to Diwali, and service was a bit slow, the outstanding food made up for everything. We went back happy!

Came here for a nice Diwali Breakfast, but sadly it was ruined.
I understand the shortage of staff due to festivities. But you'd much rather shut the restaurant for a while rather than have 5 tables of irate customers asking for food and service.

Felt like the one poor chap was cooking cleaning and serving. It wasn't his fault but he dealt with a lot of hate.
Saw one person walk into a kitchen asking for someone to take his money for the bill.
Saw the staff wrestling customers not to leave.

Management game failed. 
Better to call a day off than to give such bad impressions.

I knew banana leaf service was bad but I did not think it was this bad. I would advise people not to order from this restaurant. And the worst part is that zomato itself cannot do anything. 
My order number is 39461755.

I was looking for a vegetarian restaurant and this one serving South Indian dishes fitted the bill perfectly. Ordered Masala Dosa and Uttapam Platter and it did taste good. I also took sambar vada (for parcel). However it was a bit too oily according to my liking. The sambar dal and chutney were decent as well. 
Coming to the ambience, it was really nice with a pretty simple decor. The hosts were really cordial and were always happy to serve when there was any need. Also they did not take much time to serve the orders but you never know what it's going to be like when more people will be there at the food joint (because there were only two people at the restaurant when I went in).

We were lucky to visit this place on the first day of its launch and we are totally in love with it!
The place is quite spacious, nicely lit and clean. The view from the glass panel is totally worth cherishing. One of the best places to enjoy the rain with some hot hot food!

Nonetheless, we tried the much talked Tiffin which comprised of mostly all the dishes in small portions. Perfect meal to opt for as you get to eat and taste almost everything üòÑ

Next we had the Cheese Podi Dosa, which is a masala dosa stuffed with some cheese and gun powder. Delicious and spicy this was! Must try!

Next was the Uttapam platter consisting of 5 mini Uttapam! We loved it and would always want to order that!

Last but not the least, we tried the Kesari halwa which was steal of the evening! The mild flavour of saffron was all over it and it tasted spectacular.. 
A must visit place, with courteous staff and finger licking food.

The service is soo bad that it will end up ruining your entire experience.  And the staff are shamelesss and clueless. They dont even have the courtesy to serve water . We ordered food and they gave 2 out of 5 orders after 45 min and we kept waiting for for rest. The previous two finished their meals but rest of food dint arrive. They had not even served water till that time even after repeatedly asking for it. After getting too irritated and literally shouting we got water and rest of the order. By that time the mood was completely  ruined. Would advise anyone to visit this place.

I have been to all outlets of Banana Leaf the food is always great as usual. Recently I went there with a few friends of mine to Vivekananda Park branch and ordered the Paneer onion masala Dosa and the thali. The Dosa was amazing and thali was great as usual. There I found ample parking space for the vehicles too. Enjoyed my time there. I am Planning to visit again. Thumbs up

Banana Leaf is located in Southern Avenue, near Vivekananda Park. This is basically a South Indian place. I have passed by it a lot of times but never ate there. The food is reasonably priced. Yesterday I ordered a Masala Rava Dosa from there. The quantity of the food was quite good. However, it was a bit oily according to me. The duration of the delivery was also a bit long. But the packing was neat. The people are quite nice and they call up to make sure the food is properly delivered. All in all, I am satisfied with the experience.

This was our maiden visit to a south Indian eatery situated in Kolkata. As my partner is a staunch non vegetarian we didn't get the scope earlier. On a Friday afternoon after the movie at lake mall we needed to have a meal in giffy and almost all the restaurants nearby was closed as it was five already so we decided to crash in here and the experience was a good surprise. We ordered sambar vada : crispy and tasty. Onion utthapam for my guy as he doesn't like Dosa and Mysore Masala Dosa for me as I, well like Dosa quite a lot. The meal was completed with two lassis. Pocket pinch was lighter, which made us happier even more.

Coming from a person who does not prefer South Indian food anymore, after years of overeating, a 4.5 must really mean a lot. There was a time when I used to dine here with a friend EVERY SUNDAY. We would have lunch here before heading off to tuition.¬†The food here is great. Definitely one of the best South Indian places in the city.I have had Dosas, Idlis-Sambar, Uttapam as well as their complete Thaalis.¬†The Dosas are huge and filling. The taste and stuffing are good.
The idlis and Vadas are great. The sambar is amazing
The thalis contain a lot of different things, and are a delight to have! They serve extra rice free of cost.The interior and decor are good.
It's been a while since I last went there, and writing this review has tempted me to go there again very soon.

If you are looking for authentic flavour of the South, please visit the place. Nothing fancy here, chowmin-dhosa seekers will get disappointed. They don't serve fusion food.

From filter coffee to idly, it's pure South Indian cuisine. Love it.

Had 5 flavoured Uttapam(Tomato, Onion, Aloo, Paneer & Podi) with Tea as breakfast, also there were 3 different chutney, sambar..Loved the taste, cleanliness, the cool atmosphere. Ideal way to have a healthy breakfast. Next time will try some special dosa or vada..

An average place to have south Indian food. The dosas are pretty oily. Although the paneer dosa is overloaded with paneer. The dosa should have less oil. Moderate overall.

Coming from a person who does not prefer South Indian food anymore, after years of overeating, a 4.5 must really mean a lot. There was a time when I used to dine here with a friend EVERY SUNDAY. We would have lunch here before heading off to tuition.¬†The food here is great. Definitely one of the best South Indian places in the city.I have had Dosas, Idlis-Sambar, Uttapam as well as their complete Thaalis.¬†The Dosas are huge and filling. The taste and stuffing are good.
The idlis and Vadas are great. The sambar is amazing
The thalis contain a lot of different things, and are a delight to have! They serve extra rice free of cost.The interior and decor are good.
It's been a while since I last went there, and writing this review has tempted me to go there again very soon.

The restaurant is named Brillia's Banana Leaf.
However the standard of food is as as good if not better than the original place in Lake Market!
Quality of servings and presentation of the dishes was amazing and of high standard!
The idli and vada that we first ordered was very good. Can't remember the last time I had such soft idlis which just melt in the mouth!üëå
The next was a recommendation, the uttapam platter, which was a pleasant surprise and frankly different from the norm in South Indian joints.
We also tried the dosas and found them to be good.
The number of chutneys given was also very nice.
Above all, the ambience - quiet, sober and great for a night out with family.
The decor was simple and yet soothing, esthetics had been taken care of neatly!
Would love to come here again and again!

**One of the best South Indian Restaurant in town**

Banana Leaf completely satisfies the craving of South Indian cuisine if you really have a taste for it. 
I had been to their Vivekananda Park outlet recently for breakfast and ordered Idli vada and filter coffee. The food came quick and it was served hot & fresh. The waiters are friendly and courteous. Restaurant was very clean and has a good seating capacity. Ideal for family visit and enjoy nice South Indian food.
I am definitely visiting again for lunch/dinner soon.

If you love South Indian cuisine and you are a Kolkata inhabitant, Banana Leaf is your destination. Banana Leaf has been a name for South Indian food in the city now. There are several outlets in the city ‚Äì very recently I had reviewed their Sector V outlet (read here) and I was amazed by the food. This time, it was an invite for a food tasting and bloggers‚Äô meet at their newest Southern Avenue outlet. Find Banana Leaf ‚Äì Southern Avenue here on Zomato.

If there‚Äôs one place in Kolkata that has braved the pressure to modernise traditional food, and stuck to authentic South Indian cuisine as we know it, it‚Äôs Banana Leaf. I agree that South Indian food is much more than just dosa, idli, and other veggie goodies; I have myself experienced the goodness of the flavours and variety of South Indian food. But, I also agree that idli, dosa, uttapam, sambhar, etc. are a huge part of it. And, Banana Leaf has, for decades, shown Kolkatans how it‚Äôs done just right. Originally operating at Lake Market, the restaurant started to branch out only recently, with outlets at Bhowanipore and Salt Lake. And now, there‚Äôs a new outlet of Banana Leaf at Southern Avenue: and I had the chance to enjoy a royal South Indian Thali there!

Dear Kolkatans! Finally an authentic South Indian restaurant Banana Leaf near Vivekananda Park is in this city and I am so happy to visit this place today for lunch. Let me tell you I am settled in Chennai and no one but I can assure you the authenticity of the food here. Its a small 45 seater restaurant at the first floor of the building located at lake terrace road crossing. There is nothing much to talk about the ambience but about the features and decor...its a very neat and clean restaurant without any fancy decor but a roadside view from your seat would make this place little happening. Coming to the food (for my mom and myself) we ordered Mysore Masala Dosa which was really crisy the filling was pipping hot and fresh and the dosa inner layer was coated with the perfect amount of Mysore masala, also ordered medu vada which is by far the best I ever had ( including all the n number of plates I hogged in Chennai at various famous joints there) , one meal which had drumbstick kuzhabu, cabbage porial, bottleguard kuzhambu ,sambhar, rasam,butter milk, mixed veges raita, steamed rice, pooris, Pappad, kesari as dessert. The thali has unlimited servings and all the dishes were freshly made and with perfect amount of spices to make it just the way it is down south. Finally we finished the meal with filter coffee served pipping hot and with perfect amount of sugar in it. I personally like light decoction so for me it was just fantastic.

The service guys were really courteous and on their toes. 

 But but but...the only drawback and why I couldn't give a 5/5 is the fact that the thali service was too slow and it came after one of us had finished most of our food so the other person just sits and stares which was very bad. After the billing I asked the person serving our table why was the thali delayed and why it was taking time for every refill in thali and he said that the rice had got over which didn't quite make sense as rice is given after the thalis come with the pooris and even after the rice was served the refilling was taking time. 

However I am visiting this place again soon with my husband (as being a Tamilian he would definitely like the food at this place)

There is some connection between my taste buds and authentic South Indian cuisine that I am yet to decrypt. Bengalis when they travel down South, they look for homely food but that‚Äôs not the case for me. I always try to explore places that serve the authentic local food. Actually that‚Äôs true for any place I visit, in the country or abroad, I truly love the fresh flavors of authentic local food that a place has to offer, that‚Äôs kind of a weird stress buster for me! So anyway, when I am in my home town (Kolkata) I try to explore every nook and corner of the city to find out joints that dish out truly authentic flavors that come close to what I have tasted back in that particular place, for example when I tasted Nasi Goreng in my city I was continuously comparing it with the dish I had tasted back in Indonesia couple of years back and often I am utterly disappointed (like in this case of Nasi Goreng). So, coming back to the South Indian food I was talking about, if you really want to have fresh and authentic South Indian food in Kolkata or want to treat your South Indian friend then you have to try out places like Banana Leaf.

Banana Leaf Chain of South Indian restaurants in the city of joy under Rajesh Bala is a reason of double joy now as the newest location is spread open at¬†P 264C, Hemanta Mukhopadhyay Sarani. Near Vivekananda Park, Southern Avenue, Kolkata . The newly opened one is very well set up with nice glass facade surrounding its exterior and interior look. Nice spacious seating arrangements of wooden make as always like its other outlets is seen here as well. The colour of green and white gives a pure vegetarian and Banana Leaf signature colour combination around. I love the feel and vibe here once you get in as its always one of those clean and hygienic friendly restaurants from where you want to have a good meal from. Not only that but the menu options are vast and very much in the variety zone . Anyone who loves South Indian cuisines must not miss this place as its a new one and has great potential to get the best food at your table.

We ordered a Paper Dosa which was perfectly done , a Cheese Plain Dosa with Masala on the Side which was a Cheese lovers delight and I am still salivating over and a Vada which was again perfect ... soft inside and crisp outside. Full marks for the Sambar and Chutney. Your going to find me here often !

Want to try some authentic south Indian titbits?
Then this must be your new place in the foodcoma list!
They surely will grab your attention by their simple yet neat decor situated in the 1st floor of Zucca lounge.
Quite spacious I must say!
Photo lovers would get their zone against a green wall while climbing up the stairs ;)
Coming to the food I would say, they're good for sure.
Filling and tasty with a reasonable price. Special chutney was amazing.

Must orders: 
‚úîMysore butter masala dosa - Red hot dosa with an amazing poor inside it. Sambar was plain. I liked the chutney more!
‚úîCheese dosa - it was the best!!
‚úîIdli 
‚úîKesari halwa - unforgettable dessert. Loved every bit of it.

For drinks you can try buttermilk.
Fresh lime could have been better :)

Banana leaf... I'm very much familiar with this name for long... As because my Didi is a huge fan of their food... And she used to take parcel from the Lake Market wala outlet more often... And at that time it was the only joint of this brand... But time has changed and the brand expands from South to Salt Lake... And why not everyone deserves to taste their delicacies... 
Some days ago we went to this outlet... Ambience is very beautiful... Large window panes making the place more attractive... Their simple wooden chairs n tables  are very classy too... Service was not that good... Staffs need more training...

In food we tried their...

‚òÖ Filter Coffee~ Excellent one...

‚òÖ Card wada~ Good one...

‚òÖ Uttapam platter~ Mind blowing...

‚òÖ Cheese Onion masala dosa~ One of the best dosa I even had... 

‚òÖ Sada wada~ Extremely tasty...

‚òÖ Kesri halwa~ Just insane...

Overall another very satisfactory experience at BL... Will visit again for sure...

Over the years, Banana Leaf has maintained its stronghold over South Indian cuisine in Kolkata and have come up with a new outlet at Southern Avenue to fortify their dominance.

Visited this new outlet of theirs with some friends. It is located just beside Zucca Lounge. I have always loved the variety their menu exudes which is also their strength.

Getting to the food, we had the regular Idly and Vada. The Special Chutney served with it was too good, something very different. We also ordered Cheese Masala Dosa, which was absolutely amazing. Next up we had the Uttapam Platter. It is my favourite here and is on my regular order list. The 5 varieties of uttapam served are really impressive. Cheese Uttapam was also lovely; couldn‚Äôt stop myself from having more of it.

Their signature Rava Kesari always proves to be a spell binding dessert.

The service is fluent and quick. Price are very reasonable keeping in mind the top quality food served here.

This is my first time in this newly opened outlet of Banana Leaf.
Ambiance was good with an equally good service. Ordered Vada, Butter Onion Masala Dosa, Cheese Butter Masala Dosa, Fresh Lime and Lassi.
I preferred the Cheese Butter Masala Dosa over everything else. It was sooooo good!
Butter Onion Masala Dosa had too much freshly chopped onions in it against my liking.
Both Lassi and Fresh Lime was amazing!

For a foodie who loves south Indian food‚Ä¶Banana leaf is the place you gotto go in Kolkatta. I had the opportunity to visit the newly opened restaurant at Vivekananda Park, I must say its clean, hygienic and located at an ideal spot .

I am the one with a  large appetite and up for a meal anytime, so I ordered a sumptuous meal, the food was super tasty ,the service quick, and the waiters are full of hospitality refilling your quantities of palya, sambhar and rasam .

My husband ordered the dosa and couldn‚Äôt resist taking 2 additional helping of the sambhar and chutney ..

This place is surely a visit for all those looking for a  sumptuous lunch and mouth-watering Idli and Dosas ‚Ä¶ you sure wont be disappointed.

I am not much fan of South Indian, but visiting this outlet I must say, they taste good too. Banana leaf is hotspot for South Indian dishes in town. One of the best place for South Indian food. They have a few more outlet too. 
I visited here and had Cheese Masala Dhosa which was very good to taste.
The Uttapam platter with 5 Uttapam was also good enough.
Their Gajar ka Halwa was the best thing to try here.
Prices are reasonable enough.

Over the years, Banana Leaf has maintained its stronghold over South Indian cuisine in Kolkata and have come up with a new outlet at Southern Avenue to fortify their dominance.

Visited this new outlet of theirs with some friends. It is located just beside Zucca Lounge. I have always loved the variety their menu exudes which is also their strength.

Getting to the food, we had the regular Idly and Vada. The Special Chutney served with it was too good, something very different. We also ordered Cheese Masala Dosa, which was absolutely amazing. Next up we had the Uttapam Platter. It is my favourite here and is on my regular order list. The 5 varieties of uttapam served are really impressive. Cheese Uttapam was also lovely; couldn‚Äôt stop myself from having more of it.

Their signature Rava Kesari always proves to be a spell binding dessert.

The service is fluent and quick. Price are very reasonable keeping in mind the top quality food served here.

A lovely South Indian joint that has opened on the same building as Zucca, in Southern Avenue. Food here is spectacular- especially their Cheese Butter Masala Dosa and Buttermilk. Their Gajar Ka Halwa would also leave you licking your fingers for good. Do drop by and try their authentic, scrumptious food.

Located conveniently at Southern Avenue, on the 1st floor of the Zucca Lounge building, this new place serving authentic South Indian food will make you happy no matter how much you keep your distance from veg food.

This place is quite spacious. Decoration is minimal.
Service is good. Price is quite reasonable.

Must orders -

Cheese onion masala dosa
Cheese uttapam
Sambar vada
Mysore dosa

Dahi vada could be better.

Recommended!

South Indian Cuisine is something which I love and am very critical about it. Heard a lot about Banana Leaf and decided to visit this outlet which has been annaugrated few days back. Loved the quality of food here. I liked the interior, they have made it simple and the green and white colour is going really good.
I took a Cheese Onion Utthapam, Butter Milk and Butter Onion Dosa.
I liked them all.
A good place to have some south indian stuff.
