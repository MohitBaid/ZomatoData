Located just beside GD Market in Salt Lake this is a quite popular sweet shop in the locality. The sweets are ok type , nothing outstanding but not bad either . This place is mainly known for their Singara & Amriti . They make beautiful Singara at very low price which can give tough competition to some of the well known Samosa outlets in the city. They have a live counter to make Amriti in the afternoon ( roughly from 4-30pm onwards) . Though it can not be called traditionally authentic , as they  use besan instead of dal , yet they are tasty & the hot Amriti will surely please the taste buds.

Today we placed bulk quantity order to this place for our office friends, on occasion of Rath Yatra. Half an hour before we placed order and they served on time. Very professional service and quality.

Note: Â This review is intended for New Raj Ballavi Sweets, as the picture put by Zomato here suggests, and not Raj Ballavi Sweets There is a shop by the latter name exactly 2-3 stores beside, placed on the same lane.
This is a place a bit away from my residence and I do not usually have the chance to come here. The location is pretty decent though. This sweet shop is located just outside of GD Market. If you know where Susruta/Heart Clinic is, keeping Heart Clinic and Susruta on your right, take a left turn from the round island. Keep walking for 3-4 minutes and you would see the market in front of you and a lane going to your left. This sweet shop will be right in front of you.

Coming to their offerings, I must admit that they make really amazing Samosas. Salt Lake lacks decent Bengali sweet shops which produces good samosas. Instead it is dominated by stores like Gupta Brothers and Bhikharam! This outlet perhaps is the only one which could not only compete with them but also beat the likes of the mentioned heavyweights. A spice potato filling with the crunchy floury goodness. To top this, they serve freshly prepared Jalebis right in front of you in the evening time. So, what else do you want for a perfect Bengali snacks in the evening time?

I haven't tried much of their sweets other than the Malpoa. I really miss the goodie old Malpoas which a sweet shop used to serve nearby my home before it got closed many years back. The Malpoa available here made me remind of them. Not too thin, yet not too over-puffed with unnecessary batter, this one serves as a perfect sweet to end the meal. And if you think, you have eaten too much, get hold of a Cold Drinks, as they sell that too! :-)
