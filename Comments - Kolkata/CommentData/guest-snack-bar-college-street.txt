Nothing special about the place... It's dirty, unhygienic  and unclear... Although the staffs are very courteous... Service was fast too... I had their chicken sheek kabab and rumali roti... The combination was good but not anything excellent... Pocket pinch is very friendly...

Located at Amherst Street and Surya sen Street crossing, near to Purabi cinema hall. Actually it's not a bar, just a small zone serving mughlai, rolls and north Indian foods. Quality is quite good. MUTTON TIKIYA is tasty . Rolls are good for quick snack. Service is OK. Better for take away as though there is dine in option but it's small and uncomfortable. Price is cheap.

A small joint at the end of Surya Sen Street. This place is much popular for Chicken Rolls which are really good here. I have tried it a number of time passing by this area and Everytime I was satisfied.
They make good biryani too.

The dearest friend of mine happens to be a resident of College Street and thus I often spend time there. During one such visit to his place, we decided to have our lunch outside as there were no one present at his place and thus visited here.

Located just along the intersection of Surya Sen Street and Amherst Street, it has a deceiving name. It calls itself a 'bar' which is far away from the truth. It placed itself almost on the footpath, has a 'kind of' mezzanine floor seating arrangement and the ground floor holds some seats with the cash counter.

On our visit, we ordered three rumali roti and few tikiyas. The order got delivered almost instantly and since the roti was warm we enjoyed our lunch. To comment on the taste, the tikiya was indeed awesome and the rumali roti was just fine. For a roadside kind of stall, the taste of the tikiya is worth appreciating. It is also heard that they serve some great 'chaaps', but, I am yet to try it.

They also serve rolls and fries which tastes okayish and not much to expect from.

The behaviour of the staff is friendly and it seems that the owner of the place sits at the counter who follows up if the order delivery is delayed.

The cleanliness of the place is a major setback but comparatively the seats are clean enough for one to have their food. However, the chaaps are seen to be prepared at an open place just parallel to the footpath which give me a very inedible kind of feeling.

A visit advised if you are an experimental being.

Guest Snacks Bar is located at one end of Surya Sen Street toward Sealdha. While passing number of time in this Street I have visited here a few time. Mostly for their Biryani. Guest Snacks Bar is one of the oldest Biryani seller in this entire area, before those Rs.70 Biriyani came up at every corner of College Street. Biryani here is good. But if you compare it with those selling at Rs.70 they are almost same in quality. Chicken piece was of average size and quality was enough for single person.
Next coming to their Rolls, I have had rolls for here a number of time. Their Chicken roll is very good. Thick paratha and less oily and good size Chicken pieces. They charge one Chicken roll with single stick of Chicken Rs.40 and with double stick of Chicken Rs.70.
Things to try here : Biryani and any Roll.

Situated on the junction of Surya Sen St. and Raja Rammohan Roy Rd. (erstwhile Amherst St.), this is a very small place with steep and narrow wooden staircases, and a dark, dingy & cramped interior. Nothing to attract one's attention, were it not for the sharp, hot aroma of frying mutton tikkas that hits the nose as one turns the corner.
And that's really the only worthwhile thing there. Avoid the biriyani, eschew the gravies, stay away from the kebabs. But go for the mutton tikka, which is the best in Kolkata, with rumali rotis or parathas. It's a short walk from my workplace, and I lunch there once or twice a week. Prices are very reasonable.

A very small shop which runs really well suited to low budget eating. Had the Rumali Roti with Chicken Kasha and Chicken Cutlet from here. Very average taste. The Kasha is too oily. Not recommended really.

Best as snack place . Local exactly Surya sen street crossing. Having 2nd floor but small steep staircase and just no luxury. Low cost good food  and for mughlai lovers. Mutton tikia is good with paratha or roti. Small area one to two staffs. Take away is best. Price is kind off okay. Can try if hungry and liver ready to junkies. More or less well. Can hit this joint for once. Cheers!!! /m\

Located near Purabi Cinema Hall just a few minutes walk from there.
Not a bar at all as the name may suggest. 
Just normal fast food items are available. 
Best for takeaway though dine-in is there. 
Ordered Moghlai Special and Egg Chicken Roll. Overall an average experience.

It is a very very small eating place near my house. And it is a ritual for us to visit guest and eat upstairs every panchami.
All the nearby mughlai restaurants fail to make a good tikia. The tikia at guest is really really good. Obviously you need soap later on to get rid of the dalda but the taste is worth it. And for rs 35 a piece and 3 roomali rotis for rs 15. It is worh every cent you pay. You can try the biriyani, chaanp, moghlai here as well and you won't be disappointed. But first you need to have the mutton tikia.

The first thing that delighted me about this place is the 'Two-storey' design of the restaurant, the place is quite small though. In terms of ambience, it's not that good but service time is really, really quick! I tried out Mutton Moghlai. Though it did not taste very good but the filling of the moghlai was full of minced mutton which was a plus point. Potato curry, salad and tomato sauce alongside went good alongwith the moghlai. This place is good for real quick-bites!

This place is just a road-side fast food center. Dont go by the name, they do not offer any alcoholic beverages. Taste of the food is OK, quanitity is very less comparing to the price. Service is not good enough. Prices are kind of in the higher side for a below average eatery like this one. Take away will be the better option rather than dining in here because of uncleanliness.

This is not a very good place to sit n eat. It is not clean but that is expected from a road side eatery like this. However a take away is a much better option because although the food they serve might not be suitable for the diet conscious but it is quite a delight for the foodie. The mutton kebab, n d tikia both are a real pleasure for the taste buds. I would recommend this place for those who are always up for street food or for those who want a quick delicious snack at a low cost.

this is not a big place to hangout with friends.....trust me...its not where you can go and have food and njoy the ambience...its simply a street side fast food centre...but,since i happen to stay near college street...even during the pujas,i love taking dinner parcel from here....be it evening snacks like roll,moghlai paratha,fry,cutlet or dishes like biryani,tikia,kababs,chap,kosha...they all taste really nice...the kababs are garnished with lemon and onion and they taste simply superb....if you are walking by this shop and you want to have some snacks to satiate your taste buds...go for it...

Happened to be in College Street area and could not resist myself from gorging on the typical north kolkata street food!! Could not make out enough time to visit Food Station or Paramount.. and found Guest in my way.. and could not pass by without making a visit!!

A typical old north kolkata style eating joint... crampy sitting arrangement... but flavours of delicious fries and chaaps coming out!! Ahh.. was missing this since long!!! We were three and ordered a Fish Fry and 2 Chicken cutlets in first round.. they arrived in a jiffy... with generous amount of orange-red colored tomato sauce and cucumber-onion salad.. It took us exactly 5mins to finish them!! They actually served as appetizers and we were hungry like we had not eaten for ages!! 

Our 2nd order went for 2 moghlai parathas.. one egg and another chicken... Those too were served within 4-5mins... along with Salad, tomato sauce and the Aloo sabji.. We jumped on them.. only to get a little disappointed.. the aloo sabji lacked proper seasoning.. and I particularly avoid adding raw salt to my food.. the chicken moghlai was way better than the egg one.. somehow the egg filling was quite hard and flaky and missed the gooeyness of a delicious egg filling... Nevertheless, it took us 10-15mins to finish them.. they were quite filling indeed.. The pocket pinch came as 164/- .. its been long since we have enjoyed almost a full meal for 3 in just 164/-!! Giggling!!!!!!!!
