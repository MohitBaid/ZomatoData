Deshbandhu Mistanna bhandar serves excellent luchis. ðŸ™ˆ I just love the luchis they serve. ðŸ˜‚ Try the gulab jamun and mihidana too if there.

Deshbandhu mistanna bhandar located right next to the first red light crossing on your way from gowrah bridge to bara bazzar. This shop is located on your right hand side if going towards barabazzar or college street and on right hand side if coming towards howrah station. Easy to locate and trust me your nose will detect the sweet smell from a distance and your brain will turn your head towards the shop.
I have been to this place numerous times. The best sweet of theirs is sitabhog and mihindana and trust if you get them hot and steaming you are the luckiest. Samosa served by them is small but in terms of taste its nice. Kachori and sabzi is good (this is what my friend told me not my review). There are various sweets available some are pretty good like gujiya, kacha golla, sandesh and many more. Some are okayish. But its one of the best sweets shops in bara bazzar. Every sweet shop has their speciality they too have their own that is sita bhog which is a must buy. Pithe during pithe season are lovely treat. Recommended.

Situated in between strand road and satyanarayan park area under the vidyasagar setu flyover of barabazar area. Very famous for it's milk and milk products. Ambience was average but hospitality and service was good. Price was pocket friendly. I tried their rabdi it was the best in town. Perfectly made and heavenly delicious. Experience was really amazing. Highly recommended to all for their milk based sweets.

Have been in this sweet shop many times while shopping in Barabazar. Their kachori, aludum , singaara are too good. In sweets section, mihidaana, sitabhog, kalakand, milkcake, gulabjamun , amriti are delectable and a must try.
Ambience and staffs are OK. Always a rush is there. Prices are damn economical along with quality.

Located at Â Bara Bazar just near to the strand road crossing. Was coming back from office work and looked upto this place for some sweets. Tried their Imarti and Gulab Jamun. Both of them did a fantastic job to satify my tongue with the freshness and taste.

A sweet shop since probably more than 40 years. Very famous for the ubiquitous luchi dal and mihir dana. They stock many varieties of bengali sweets and being on a very busy street always remains crowded.

Deshbandhu Mistanna Bhandar is one of those outlets where you can't stop going if you are a sweets lover :) They make the best Sita Bhog in town I guess. Their Singharas are also super tasty.

Ohhh God..  I am so emotional while writing this review because this place reminds me my favourite time that is my childhood. This shop is situated in same building where my nani's house was. We all go there in our summer vacations. I ate only their rasgullas sorry roshgulla. More than 7 years gone as we visit Kolkata last in 2008 but still I can feel the real taste of those rasgullas in earthen pots. I wish I could go again there and feel the awesomeness.

If you're an early riser of the city, rush to this outlet by 7-7:30 in the morning to taste Luchi and Kachoris fried in pure ghee..!  The Luchi & Kachori both are made in bengali authentic style. Also I cherish their Sitabhog and Mihidana. A must for all sweet teeth out there.

Went to this Old School Legendary Sweet Outlet just before Howrah Bridge and Tram Depot..... Though I am personally not a Sweet Craze Fanatic but I love to eat selective Sweets of my own choice..... Ordered Desi Ghee Laddu on the eve of " Maha Shivratri " and I must definitely say that This Legendary Shop proves why its is called Legendary in its Professional Taste..... The Laddu was awesome and was made out of Pure Desi Ghee which made me go Mad and have plans to visit this Outlet again.....

Barra bazar and deshabandhu's name goes hand in hand and trust me,they serve the best sita bhog in the city. Each and every sweet they serve has a touch of bengaliness in it. Unlike most other sweet vendors in the area, they serve the likes of bengali people. Their samosas are a treat every time u try them. Yum yum. And for a person with a sweet tooth like me, this kinda places are no less than jannat. Love their sweets..

This place is just located at the corner of M. G. Road when you are coming from Howrah. The place is quite big and the mishti is really great. The Hing-er Kochuri are always hot and served with a aloo chholar dal. Â Rosogolla is a must Â after the kochuri and you should not limit yourself to only one if you are a mishti lover. The Shakh sondesh is good. Hot Pantua is available if you visit the place a bit early. Pocket pinch - not really!

A  few  years  back  used  to  have  sweets  from  Desbandhu  frequently...   liked  their  sweets  especially  the  Gujia  and  amriti... The  gujia   had  a  very   different  and  interesting   flavour  with   grounded sugar  adding  to the  taste  and  texture...however  when  I    had  their  sweets ,  was  disappointed  a  bit  with   the   taste  and  quality ,  the  laddus  or  the and  the  amriti   weren't  much  good ...hope  they  improve  their   sweets again  in the   near  future! :)
