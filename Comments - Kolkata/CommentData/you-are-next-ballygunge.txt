One of the worst cafe I've ever been to...
Won't ever go there in my life for sure...we were like around 10-12 people...and they made us sit on floor mats...in some room specially made for groups...
And the worst was their service and food..
The dish we get the fastest in any cafe or restaurant is Crispy Chilly Babycorn...which we generally get it after 10-15mins of ordering...and here we got it after around 45-50mins...Over all nothing was too good to be appreciated...even their pasta wasn't good... undercooked...lacked flavours...
We needed to knock the management again and again for our order...they were sort of least bothered...
It's just that Hookah is cheap... can't advice all to go...
Not at all appealing ambience...

If u r thinking about Da staff they are like family
Regarding the quality nd quantity of food it's more than u want 
If u r thinking for a private place to spent time it's a perfect option for you

As few of the other reviews say : the positive reviews seem completely fake. We ordered a Hookah which was not good. The charcoal used was one of the cheapest avaliable in the market. One wouldn't last more than 15-20 minutes and coal change costs Rs 49. The Service is extremely slow. We ordered Chinese Bhel which was served exactly after 1 hour after we ordered it. The taste was good and quantity was satisfactory according to the price. The singing show was nice and enjoyable. The furniture seems very cheaply managed. The place is very congested. The staff behaved well but couldn't help in any way with the delayed order. Visit to this place is a complete NO.

Was looking for a restaurant opened after 1am and this one. Ordered Dragon chicken, schezwan fried rice,  garlic pepper chicken and KitKat shake. Each of the items were tasty though the service is not that fast. The ambience is moderate. The Billiard's board was a good attraction.

This cafe is located near Ballygunge phari just a few steps away from Chowman.
The interiors are quite good and there are two private space available too.
Coming to the food we ordered 


‚Ä¢Chilly Garlic Rice- It was tasty and not too oily.

‚Ä¢Schezwan Chicken- It consisted of 8 pieces of medium sized chicken and was spicy and hot.

Overall a we had a good time.
A good place to hangout with friends.

I did not like the place much. Firstly, the area in which it is situated is not up to the mark. Next, the service is super slow. Like we ordered 3 hookahs, 4 mocktails, and just 2 starters and with just these servings, we stayed there for about 4 hrs. The service too wasn't up to the mark. The mocktails were nice but starters were something which we had to bare. Though the bill was very affordable but everything else was aa waste. So I'd probably never go there.

It is hard to explain how a place can effortlessly click, be it the food, the music or the company. M sure one goes through zomato at least once before hitting any such cafes in town.
On entering, u find this beautiful lit cafe and soft romantics playing in the background which will definitely act as a soother. I'm sure one will fall in love with the interiors. It has got 2 private sections as well where you can spend some quality time with your partner. 
Coming to the food... Being foodie I'm very particular about foods. The food was yumilicious (in my words)
It's very very very pocket friendly for students like us.
Rates were nominal, quality and quantity both were good and as I had said initially, they have a good collection of music.
The staff was equally good and friendly.
It's month end and you are broke but u still crave to eat something good then "You are next" is the place my friend. I'm sure you won't regret visiting this newly opened cafe.
Be it a dinner date or a hangout with your friends this place is a must visit.

Best shisha in town all you need to do is think of the flavor you want and it is there. The marvelous thing about the shisha is that it is clean, they serve you a clean water shisha just filled up before serving it to you. They use a high quality charcoal for the shisha which is great.

Wow! I just really wanted to let you guys know how impressed i am with your service,...

It's a new cafe. I read about it on Zomato, and decided to give it a try. It has opened only a day before I went. 
The cafe is decorated with red and white balloons. They led us to the private area. It had mattresses on the floor, and cushions. 
The owner of the cafe, as it seemed, greeted us. 
The staff were good and well behaved but they lacked professionalism.
Coming to the food, we had
1. Kiwi blast- it had a very strong kiwi flavor , which was nnice 
2. Brownie blast - they told us that they didn't have brownie at that time but then they arranged it from somewhere and presented it before us. They had put a rumball in the shake instead of a brownie. And it tasted good.
3. Basil chicken. 
4. Baby corn. 
5. Veg hakka noodles. 
6. Honey chicken.
7. Blueberry flavored hookah. 
The quantity of the food, except the noodles, wasn't satisfying. 
The service was somewhat slow. The music they played was boring, too. 
There was a pool table. 
Altogether, a nice place to hang out with friends. The prices are inclusive of all taxes, which is good. They also gave us a discount, maybe because it is a new cafe.
