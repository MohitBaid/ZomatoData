This is a much needed addition for the foodies of howrah, and for those looking for better options to order cakes for theor loved ones. I decided to try these people out for one of my friends birthday, and it was delicious - we actually regretted later wasting half of it on our friends face!
A 5 from me.

I don't know where to start from since everything I have had till now has left a satisfactory. Let's start with my most favourite , the red velvet cake. It's amazing how the cream cheese does not give you a sugar rush by the end of your last bite. It is perfect. It is a must try for everyone. 

The latest dessert I tried is the Lamington which is mind blowing. It's impeccable in the way it looks as well as the way it tastes. More than anything I feel that the use of creativity in the simplest of her desserts as well as the decorating and presenting of it is very impressive.

Puja......... You rocked it!!
