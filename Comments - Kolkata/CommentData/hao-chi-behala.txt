As always I would like to say this is entirely my take on the food, so it would be¬† quiet normal¬† if our opinion are different . So coming to the main point, this was my first time ordering from¬† here(I won't be commenting on the service as this was a home-delivery), I was not sure what to expect or what to order,¬† so I went for random items without looking at "What people love here" part at Zomato.

Thus these were what I ordered for: -

For Starters: Chilli prawn dry, Drums of heaven. For Side Dishes: Hunan Chicken, Mongolian chicken, Chilli chicken. Along with some Mixed fried Rice.

¬†*Side note: No complain on the quantity, enough for 3 people. Also the price was "thik-thak".
Read below for detailed review:

1. Chilli prawn dry: Good. The sweetness with a hint of tanginess really makes it appropriate for starters.

2. Drums of heaven: meh. Although this is one of my favourite dishes, this one really didn't do justice to how it should be. Too dry. If the sauce with which it is coated doesn't stick to your hand(thereby
letting you lick your finger), then it doesn't deserves to be called drums of heaven. More like drums of earth or land.

3. Mongolian chicken: Cool. It was like a treasure box, so many veggies along with nice piece of chicken and all cooked well. A job well done.

4. Hunan Chicken: #feelingOld. Now let me tell you this when I ordered this it was mostly because my friend wanted to have it, so I had no idea what this was going to turnout. Although he did say that this was something quiet light on the taste buds. But after having it I really have no idea on what to say about it (whether it was good or bad) but one thing I can say for sure is that when I get old(around 80) this will be what my doctor might recommend.

5. Chilli chicken: NotAgain. Too much soya sauce. Fed up on repeating same thing to every other restaurant: "Adding more doesn't make it good".

6. Mixed fried Rice: OK. You will get this same at almost everywhere. That very same one that your neighbor aunty gives you at her kid's birthday.

All over review: 2/5. "Next time won't be ordering no. 2, 4 and 5, dusra kuch try marney mein harz hai, sayad achcha ho".
P.S, Naye saal ka pehla order.

Their special Swiggy Combo at 180 bucks is simply the best.Thet give Chicken Fried Rice , Chilli Chicken and Drumsticks in the combo which can be easily be shared by two .Once we dined out at their restaurant and the Fried Rice was really good there too.
Overall, an extremely budget friendly place which gives tasty food.

Ordered food from Hao Chi's. I opted for their combo of half dry chilli chicken and chicken Momo (5 pieces). I wasn't disappointed at all with the quality and service, the former being really good and the latter being before expected time. The momos, which were a bit bland for my taste, were otherwise a good accompaniment for the dry chilli chicken (absolutely delicious, strikes the perfect mid point of all spices).
All in all a good evening snack.

My personal favourite is Mixed Gravy Noodles and Dry Chilli Chicken. They have some combo offers which one can try if they are not in the mood of wholesome meal. Quantity is more than enough and they always excel in taste. A must try place. I would personally recommend for home delivery.

Hao Chi Behala offers a Fantastick combo over a food delivery portal priced at Rs 180 per order.It consists of some delicious chicken wings tossed in a spicy sauce consisting of three pieces, half plate Chilli chicken which was rather lightly spicy with soya taste busting in the mouth and lots of gravy,Chicken pieces were batter coated and was of standard restaurant size.A full plate chicken fried rice which was good to taste as it was light fluppy , and a tinge sweetish to go with the Chilli Chicken.
Packing of fried rice and Chicken wings was in paper boxes and chilli chicken was in plastic container.
Over all a great offer at Rs 180/-

Haven't visited the restaurant in person, ordered in through Swiggy. This is one of your local Chinese restaurants that one visits often for some decent yet  cheap meal that is good for both the tummy and easy on the pocket. It's more of an indo-chinese restaurant and the food is moderately spicy, just how most Indians prefer their Chinese. I had ordered pan-fried momos which was very good as well as one of their combos. The quantity provided is generous and priced very reasonably. Will order again.

Momos were not out of the world but was filling and tasty. The drums of heaven tasted a bit chewy but the flavor was good, not too spicy or sweet.

Ordered food from here today through Swiggy.We took a panfried momo and a combo which had chicken fried rice,chilli chicken(half),drums of heaven(half).Swiggy gave a discount of 15% from this restaurant.

Panfried momo-The sauce in which the momo was tossed was good.The coating was crispy.But the filling lacked flavour.

Combo-Usually the portions in combo are less.Here three drums of heaven,4 pieces of chilli chicken was given along with a big portion of fried rice.These can be easily 2-3 adults.
Coming to taste..the flavour wasn't compromised at even such a low price.The chilli chicken was old Kolkata style..very spicy which went very well with the light fried rice.Chicken pieces were soft.. and not overly coated with babycorn which I liked.The drums of heaven were pretty good too.The outer coating was crispy with juicy chicken inside.The sauce it was cooked in was also very spicy.

Ideal place for those who likes their Chinese food with a punch of heat in it.Maybe difficult for the people who have less tolerance towards spicy food.

The rice was very soft. It was perfect. And the quantity was enough for two people.

#Chilli_Chicken
It was also good in taste. It was not spicy at all.

#Chicken_Drumstick
I liked this most. It was very spicy. And I liked the crispy drumstick tossed in sauce.

#Pan_Fried_Chicken_Momo
Momo was fresh and good in taste. Inside of the momo was not oily.

Overall it is nice pocket friendly place to have some chinese food .

i found about hao chi in Zomato and decided to try out their dishes . ordered lat me kai,mix schezwan rice,chili chicken and thai soup.lat me kai and the rice was excellent and the chili chicken was okay.but the soup didn't taste anything like thai soup i would say it was chicken clear soup.overall the quality of the food is very good considering the price.

Value for money!!!
I live in Parnasree and even if the restaurant is about to close, they still take the orders.
The home delivery time is super quick.
The food is pretty good compared to the price they charge.
It's better to avoid dine-in as its a very tiny little food joint and its a bit claustrophobic.

I went here for the first time recently and I tried Thukpa and Lat Me Kai and Pepper Fish and I absolutely loved it <3
Well the Pepper Fish wad disappointing to be honest but the Thukpa was a healthy delight to calorie-conscious-protein-lovers delight ! 
P.s- The place is too small .
Servicing is good .
Chinese food here is upto the mark and it's worth a visit!

Combo @ Hao Chi

yesterday for dinner i ordered Non - Veg Combo through swiggy
it contained Egg rice (half plate)+ chilli chicken (half plate)+ drums of heaven (half plate)
price - rs 150 + rs 20 delivery

review...
Egg rice - good!!
chilli chicken - good! but too much spicy!!!
drums of heaven - worst!!!!! and again too much spicy!!!

verdict - if you love spicy foods then haochi is the place for you!! the food was so spicy that still now my stomach is burning!!!
giving .5 extra for giving spoon tissue paper and all..

dissapointing!!

I always order for home delivery from this restaurant. And I love their foods. My special favorites are Mixed Honey Fried Rice & their dry chicken preparations. They know the exact balance between sweet & hot which I enjoy thoroughly. Simply can't get enough of their food & definitely would try again in the near future. Hope they keep up their excellent job.

Perfectly located! My life saviour since I got married. Starters are very delicious, I find the spiciness according to my level. Most importantly they use good quality of fish. Perfect take away option. Very homely behaviour. The place is not at all specious! Hope they will expand soon. As it's a Chinese restaurant, waiting for some pork items in the menu. Then it'll be a 5 out of 5 place.

Hao Chi, situated in Parnashree near Bus Stand. A Chinese restaurant with Chopstick as its prime competitor. A very small restaurant with very less capacity. A total of 4 tables in this restaurant with very less space to even stand. A dim light making the place gloomy. Taking the food into consideration now, nothing to talk about. There are very less positives which i could get from this restaurant. This was the second time in this restaurant and I ordered the following:
|| Chicken Steam Momo
|| Crispy Chicken
|| Chicken Fried Rice
|| Hunan Chicken Gravy

The only thing which was good was the momo. But it was only good and not great. The rest of the items i didn't like.
The quantity was descent. The price is reasonable but when it comes to the taste of the food, it was a total disappointment. 
Won't suggest anyone to go to this place because there is a great Chinese restaurant just on the opposite side.

2/5 is the maximum I can give to this place, being lenient though.

One thing that should be noted is that this is primarily a take-away or delivery-only outlet. If you are expecting a lavish table spread for dining out, then this should not be ur take. But if you are looking for some finger licking yummy dishes at cheap rates, then this is it. Their pan fried momos are a must try. Also I loved their dry chilli chicken.

But if you're looking for a fine dining restaurant with shiny clinks of glasses, this is not the place you should be going to. Hao Chi is ideal for takeaways and order ins. Their food quantity is outstanding given the low price and minimum billing. All in all, a big thumbs up!

I am a regular customer of this restaurant. This place is located at a corner in the main market area, which makes the ambiance really pathetic. The interiors are not so great and are not noise cancelling. Located so inconveniently, one will be constantly annoyed by the hustle bustle of the busy market hours. Also a reason why I prefer takeout/home delivery from here. The food is satisfying, being served at standard rates. I would honestly prefer if the waiters were groomed for their job, rather than acting like ignorant bastards all the time. Also, if the space could be expanded a little more it would be really nice. Being a 'family restaurant', the space is too small to accommodate even 15 people at max.

This is a pretty small restaurant in Parnasree area, good for take-away and best for home delivery, as they accept orders till late in the evening. It's only a 12-15 seats place, extremely congested, so be mindful if you are visiting with friends and family for casual dining on weekends. The food is average over here. Over the past couple of years they reduced the quantity too, with the increase in prices. I like their Noodles better than the Fried Rice. For side dishes, don't experiment too much. Go for the traditional chilly chicken or chicken manchurian. You may also try the fish dishes too, they are reasonably good. Among the dry items, I like the Garlic Fish better. Momos are pretty ordinary here.

Tis' an alrighty-matey Chinese cuisine restaurant. Been eating here for a while and their home deliveries are really prompt and blazing fast. Their main highlights are the Steamed and Fried Momos (or 'dumplings' as some call it) and they're making it right!
The Hakka noodles were a downer last time but their soups are scrumptious and nutritious. (Although my mom said the soups were - ¬†so-so )
We remember ordering once before Chicken Lollipop and they ended up serving me the Drums of the Heaven dish. (Which to be honest, ended up being very spicy)
¬†
That was pretty disappointing. I mean, no offence but, serving up the wrong order is pretty awkward.

Also wish they could lower their prices. A tad too expensive for a local mainstream Chinese eatery. Their portions look smaller too considering the prices they dish them out at.¬†
They can't even make Singapore noodles the right way. (lol)¬†

The Singapore noodles tasted more like "Haldi" (translation: turmeric) ¬†noodles. ¬†The Paneer Pakodas were waaaay too salty and the texture wasn't very smooth either, it's like as if they bathed it in some salty seasoning.¬†

They also forgot to throw in their home delivery menu card even after giving them a good reminder.¬†

The only good food are the steamed and fried chicken momos. (At least, according to me) And those are my 2 cents I guess.¬†

Frankly speaking, I hope they take this with a grain of salt and strive to get better. It's nice to see the culinary industry improve so it'd be a double downer to see them go downhill with the quality of their food because of a few criticisms and such. After all, criticisms make one better if taken the right way. :)

Better luck next time I guess, Hao Chi?

HAO CHI, Behala, Parnashree

'We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read......the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so' - "Ratatouille"
PROS - 
a) good taste of simple preparations like chickn fired rice,chili ckickn, chckn momo, chckn chowmein etc
b) quickest home delivery, covering a circle of around 2-3 kms
c) food price within budget (highest priced item is 110/-)
d) a two person full course meal would cost max 300-400 /-
e) place got A.C but still wont charge any VAT or Service Tax extra( plz vice-versa dnt expect a tax invoice or bill)
f) food serving time max 10-15 mins if u decide to sit and have ur meal.
CONS - 
a) a lot of fancy food names on menu though their preparations and taste hardly caters to actual bit.. so try on ur own risk
b) Space of 10x14 ft accomodates hardly 20-25 person ( 4 seater table - 4, 6 seater table - 1)
c) 90% of business from food parcel & home delivery due to space insufficiency hence unwanted crowd gathering at their doorway, mostly local lads, and the discussion may not be healthy for ur family visit.
d) No desert or soft drinks/ mocktails on menu, hence a demand for thumps-up requires the waiter to run to the local outlet.

Well apart frm all pros and cons i enjoyed my meal and wish very best to all the unseen cooks behind the closed walls...

Only a resturant in behala which serves a good chinese food. The resturant is quite small & the decoration is also not up to the mark, but no dought food over here is realy good. In a low price you can have a tasty chinese.

Got food delivered at home. Food was average. Packaging was below average. Quantity was more than expected. 1 Plate Chowmein would serve two persons. Don't expect awesome tasting food (like Mainland China & Mirch Masala), at just Rs. 65/- per plate chicken chowmein. Food lacks the authentic Chinese touch, but its all right as most of the elite Chinese restaurants wont deliver at Parnasree.

i don't know how people don't find the food here tasty .. but for me its really great .. offers the largest quantity and a decent quality .. its crispy chicken goes good with booze.. yes its a small joint so guys plz stop talking about ambience .. its just a take away shop .. not great to have yojr food there .

@Soumen: U r absolutely right. I am from Parnasree and I have been to Haochi during pujas and all I wanna say is this restaurant is simply bakwaas. They don't even know how to cook Chinese dishes. Chopstick Restaurant is some what satisfactory..
What a waste of money.
