If you are looking for Kolkata street food but in a hygienic way... this us the place for you. You can be here chat to your hearts content or work while you eat... the Kolkata chilli chicken reminded me of the "chilli chicken " we used to have when we were kids and Chinese meant chilli chicken... the rolls cane with good amount of meat and fresh onion salad inside.. the fish fry was tasty n the fish didn't smell.

Tiger crisis is a most recent problem nowadays. This joint focuses on the theme "Save the Tiger". The decor was extremely nice. Coming to the food, I ordered Gariahat style breakfast which includes loochi, cholar dal and alurdom accompanying with
cool beverage. However I found the quality very ordinary and extremely over priced. The baked rabri was good. I liked the theme and the ambience though.

If one heads towards the Royal Calcutta Golf Club from Tollygunge side,they will find this place to their left ,close to the classical music academy "Shrutinandan".

They specialise in items that have defined the essence of Bengali Cuisine-Luchi/Paratha and Cholar Dal/Kosha Manghso,Moghlai Paratha,Cutlets,Fries and Chops.
They also serve Beverages and Sandwiches.

Food is presented well,I especially like how they cut up the Moghlai Paratha into four triangles.
Their Sandwiches are good too.

Boasting a large seating capacity with both indoor andÂ  outdoor sections,it's a good place to hangout and spend time at with others.

Had their chicken mughlai as recommended by few of the foodies.It was the only item that actually satisfied my taste buds.I also ordered veg ghugni, laccha paratha with aloo dum and potato wedges.The yellow dried peas in the ghugni almost had a hard texture, which I disliked personally, as I want ghugni to be a bit mushy texture.The aloo dum had a mild gravy and the potatoes were cooked to perfection, and the soft and crisp laccha paratha made it quite a good combination,nothing much to talk about the potato wedges as you can't go wrong with that, so they didn't, it was roughly cut and thankfully the potatoes also maintained it's crispyness.

This joint is at golf club road but if someone could't knw the place properly they could'n fnd it.they have't any road direction.the decoration and ambience is good.we had two nearby coupoun which was kasha mangsho platter.after we showed them the vouchers they told us we had to wait min 20 to 25 mins.bt the food had cme min 35 to 40 mins.the coupoun had rice,mangsho and lemonade.the quantity was too little that one could't feed properly.mangsho was good but the lemonade was just pathetic.even they could't serve a glass of water by their own side.allover jst pathetic service.not recomended at all.

Been there a couple of times... Tried their chicken mughlai parantha which is really good.. The coffee wasn't bad either.. But their egg devil was a disappointment.. For that price they served just one egg cut into 2 segments.. The fish fry tastes good but again was too small in size.. The mughlai paratha is really good with generous filling n a flaky paratha cut into neat triangles... Nice place to hang around.. I love their forest theme.. Will surely keep visiting..

I always wanted to be there. But somehow it was never been possible for me.

But today I was there with a big expectation and yes what i heard about that place is true. I liked their foods for the first setting in a cafe I first ordered food rather then the coffee ðŸ˜‚ ..

But it okay I love that mutton ghugni ... so bengali .. yes and one will definitely love their one of the bigest selling dish mutton ghugni ...

Than I orderd a cappuccino and it was lovely and my brother ordered hot chocolate and he said it was nice.

After that we ordered mutton chop which was good too. But love those two items most.

Over all it was nice experiment and I travelled long to visit this place today.

Ps: the song they played in the background is really contemporary and nice.

Have been a regular visitor for more than two years now and they do serve good food and the ambience is nice as well.It is very spacious and staff is well-behaved.Their coffee and cakes are nice.But for the first time i felt like experimenting with their menu and ordered chicken moghlai and pao bhaji and both were a total dissapointment.When i got the parcel the sauce was leaking and the bott of the paperbag they supplied was sticky and wet.God knows who on earth packs sauce in a big silver foil rather than using a small plastic pouch ! Any sensible person will know it has to leak ! Plus the sauce was not pure i felt it was watery may be to increase the bulk quantity they add water which is pathetic considering the charges they imply.The pao was burnt.The moglai tasted lik paratha and it was also fully smeared with that leaked sauce.The bhaji had a weired taste.Big dissapointment because i paid 350rs for what wr get on the streets at hardly 100rs.Guys its a nice place only if yoy stick to coffee french fries sandwiches and cakes

The place is very easy to locate...the ambience is great..good music, good deco and very courteous staff.
However some of the food items weren't satisfactory at all. Like the kasha manghsho and mughlai platter. You can get much better mughlai paratha for much lesser price from shops near your home. The dessert was good and the drinks were pretty charming as well.
It is a good place to chat and have coffee and snacks. If you are thinking of having a heavy meal then you have other choices..
