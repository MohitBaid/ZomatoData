Design My Cake could have a much better bakery than what it is.
Visited their small shop which is opposite to Gariahat Pantaloons and close to CESC office, without any specifications in my mind, I was overwhelmed by their designs. However, I went their to satiate my immediate cake cravings and I was left with a bag of mixed feelings. üôÑüôÑ It lies somewhere between a good experience and a very average one.
I tried out a Santa special pastry which was very average to taste but super cute to look atüòú. Then there came Truffle and Black Forest(my favourite oneüòè) which were on their regular menu. Both tasted oh so good and had the perfect kind of softness attached to them. Thumbs upüëçüëå for them.

P.S. they remain short of cakes and one might find oneself almost without options. Hope to give it a try at a latter date.üñêÔ∏è‚úã

Ordered a cake for birthday, red velvet flavour. The order was almost last minute order. Still they arranged for one. The taste and design was ok. Nothing to be very fancy. Need to try some more flavours to provide a final verdict.

Needed a personalised theme cake and it was a last minute thing. After almost all places arnd new town denied same day delivery, this place agreed to do it and i am glad they did.

Ordered a lazy girl themed cake in chocolate flavour and it was made to perfection. The design was just what i had discussed and shown to them in some sample. The cake tasted good. Delivery was done as per the time they committed. I am surely going back to them for many more orders.

Recommend - Yes

It was my son's 6month birthday n i had a plan to get a customised cake. But because of some unavoidable circumstances i could not plan before hand n on the very day when i remember about the cake all the bakeries said they cannot do it in such a short notice. Moeover i need a 1lb cake ,many bakers said they do customised cake only above 2lb wt. So i was literally feeling hopeless. Then DESIGN MY CAKE appeared to me as a boon. I ordered them around the 12.30pm n they told me to pick up by 5pm. My hubby went to collect it n the cake was absolutely similar to the picture which i gave them. I wish to gv them 5/5 bt deducted bcoz of 2 reasons-- a) the cake could be more moist n soft b)the lady at the counter must hear n thn speak n she can be more polite

A cute designer cake store located at the foot of the gariahat flyover. We have started ordering our office cakes from here and they look as good as they taste. 
My colleagues ordered my birthday cake from here and it tasted divine!
Recently we also ordered a chocolate peanut cake and that too was delicious.
Design my cake is becoming my favorite place to order cakes from.

ed not to avail the Store. Narrow space, uncomfortable sitting of 2 only. And, the behavior of the Lady shopkeeper is extremely bad. And, if you want for online transaction, then forget about the prestige of you there, and that too by silent support of the shop owner.

I can only say that this shop is a bus.ard shop and nothing less than that.

This particular outlet is located opposite to Pantaloons,gariahat. Personally i have visited this outlet but seen it from outside. It is definately a small outlet. Coming to the food, my dad brought 2 walnut brownies. The brownies looked quite good. It tastes great too. Crunchy outside and soft inside but not goey. Not being goey it was a bit disappointing. Nevertheless taste wise it was good to have. Will definately visit again.

Wanted to try their cakes and pastries since long. Finally yesterday I had ordered a praline pastry, butterscotch mousse rolls, strawberry shot ( don't remember the name accurately), veg puff( actually I had ordered corn puff and they had replaced it with veg puff), chicken roasted sandwich. They didn't bother to pack the items individually and didn't even microwaved the puffs. The chicken sandwich was a disaster! 
The other items were tasty though.

Small bakery near gariahat situated where the gariahat flyover starts towrads ballygunge side. Interiors are clean and cake models are displayed. Prices are okay. I previously tried few savouries , choco truffle pastry and choco rolls and quite liked them. This time took a truffle cake for my sisters birthday wothout any preordering . The cake looked average , decoration part and tastewise can be improved a lot . For 450/- i have had more yummy softer and better looking chocolate cakes.

Earlier read some reviews about insensitive staff at this establishment. The other day a relative went with a Nearbuy voucher to purchase some items. Heard that the staff were passing on taunting remarks like how the company is giving such discounts etc.¬†
As I live close by so it did not evade my notice that most of the time this shop is almost empty. Then the few people who are dropping in , will they ever come back with such kind of customer service? Therefore I hope that the company starts hiring real human beings and not mere caricatures. Then they should sufficiently train them before unleashing them on the shop floor.
On the food front I have tried their Truffle and Checkers pastries and find them average. Nevertheless a good customer service often turns even a simple meal into an extraordinary affair.

I came to know about this place from a friend. I haven't got the opportunity to visit the shop yet, but I had ordered a birthday online. The cake was camera-like and chocolatey. I half expected it to be like the photo I had sent them. But when it was delivered, I was surprised to see how perfectly the cake was done,exactly like the picture. Delivery was also on time.
Coming to the taste... The outer fondant layer,used to keep the cake in shape was too sweet. But inside, the cake was awesome. It was very soft and we could feel the rich chocolate used. Even there was chocolate chips and nuts which made the delicious. Based on the shape of the cake and its taste, the price was reasonable.
Overall my experience was really good and I hope to drop by the shop soon.

My bf ordered a cake from here and they exactly made the same cake what he showed to them and that also through WhatsApp. It was a heart shaped choco truffle cake with choco flakes on the top. They delivered it in less than 24 hours. The cake was super awesome, beyond our expectations. It was out of the world.

A lot of my friends had posted pictures and gave rave reviews about the place. So went to get a cake for a farewell party today. Most of the items were not there. Had to settle for a basic chocolate cake. Priced at 350 for a pound. It was just okay. For the same price ,cakes is way better. No one was there to write a message on the cake even. Most of the employees had apparently gone for some thing in milan mela. That is something I found it very weird. Keeping a shop were people need such stuff and not having a person to do so!! The cake taste was not out of the world. A tad bit dry. I don't think I will be dropping by anytime soon..

I ordered cake for my anniversary from design my cake. The outlet is located just opposite to gariahat pantaloons. The cake was awesome and looked exactly same as I ordered. But the lady at the shop was the only draw back I find in the shop. I visited the shop thrice. All the time she was busy attending phone calls from her family. Although she was behaving nicely but I had to wait for some time for her finishing her calls. If she is more focused on attending her customers that would be more beneficial for the shop. You guys are doing awesome with the quality of the cake.

I came here for desserts after lunch at 5SOS cafe.My expectations weren't fulfilled completely.

My friend took a strawberry shot and me being a chocolate lover was attracted to the choco avalanche seeing the dark chocolate bowl and chocolate mousse,brownie within it topped with chopped nuts,choco-chips.But it the texture of the chocolate bowl was too thick.It was very hard to bite.The mousse inside along with brownie,nuts and choco-chips tasted good.The mousse had a rich chocolatey taste but didn't have that light airy texture which I like in a mousse.
The strawberry shot was better.

Worst thing is that the person serving us was a bit rude.She asked us to give feedback but when we gave our honest opinion she didn't take the criticism well and argued with us instead.That's not the way one should behave with customers.

Came to this place yesterday. The place is very small, cutely decorated, easy to locate - opposite to the Pantaloons outlet in Gariahat. 
I loved the decor. There were many dummy fondant cakes exhibited at the counter which looked pretty good. I loved the Harry Potter one. It was pretty unique. 
I tried the Chocolate Butterscotch Roll and Chocolate Praline Pastry. The latter was suggested by the lady at the counter. The chocolate roll was good. The butterscotch filling too was good. There were nut coverings at the faces of the rolls which kinda tasted weird. The praline pastry was also good with ample amounts of praline on top. But the pastry was a bit crumbly. 
I got a Nutty Corner packed for my home. When I tried this, it tasted good but was a bit soggy and broke. 
Their concepts and the items are really good but just needs to add that touch of finesse to make things even better. There is also an offer for the day - all pastries and puffs at 50% discount after 6pm on Saturday. But I went to beat my Monday blues yesterday. So no discount. Still, Happy Dining! :)

A small outlet near the Prapti in gariahaat. This outlet has much to offer from beautifully designed cake tocute muffins and fresh sandwich and mousse. I was much tempted by the colourful cakes and muffins and tasted a strawberry mousse. It was beautifully prepared, not overtly sweet with a little zing added in form of the strawberry jelly. The birthday cakes with adorned the selves were pire eye candies....

Located in a very prime position just opposite gariahat pantaloons, this is not really a fancy place. I liked their pastries. Although I won't say those were great. I would rather walk a few more steps and have pastries from Cakes instead.

Came to this place yesterday. The place is very small, cutely decorated, easy to locate - opposite to the Pantaloons outlet in Gariahat. 
I loved the decor. There were many dummy fondant cakes exhibited at the counter which looked pretty good. I loved the Harry Potter one. It was pretty unique. 
I tried the Chocolate Butterscotch Roll and Chocolate Praline Pastry. The latter was suggested by the lady at the counter. The chocolate roll was good. The butterscotch filling too was good. There were nut coverings at the faces of the rolls which kinda tasted weird. The praline pastry was also good with ample amounts of praline on top. But the pastry was a bit crumbly. 
I got a Nutty Corner packed for my home. When I tried this, it tasted good but was a bit soggy and broke. 
Their concepts and the items are really good but just needs to add that touch of finesse to make things even better. There is also an offer for the day - all pastries and puffs at 50% discount after 6pm on Saturday. But I went to beat my Monday blues yesterday. So no discount. Still, Happy Dining! :)

A small outlet near the Prapti in gariahaat. This outlet has much to offer from beautifully designed cake tocute muffins and fresh sandwich and mousse. I was much tempted by the colourful cakes and muffins and tasted a strawberry mousse. It was beautifully prepared, not overtly sweet with a little zing added in form of the strawberry jelly. The birthday cakes with adorned the selves were pire eye candies....

A tiny shop opposite the Gariahat Pantaloons, Design My Cake is a lesser known confectionery and by my experience, definitely underrated. The place boasts of a huge spread of cakes and savouries at extremely reasonable prices (a lot lesser than its top level competitors throughout the city), and of amazing quality. On recommendation of the lady behind the counter, we took the CHOCOLATE AVALANCHE consisting of a chocolate bowl filled with choco chips, cashews and brownies - an absolute delight for a chocoholic like me. The availability of customised cakes and chocolates viz. a full chocolate Taj Mahal are sure to bring me back here.

All the best to the team behind this lovely shop.

7000 miles away from home, I hoped to gift my sister a special cake on her birthday. I reached out to Design My Cake via their website and received a quote within hours. Rahul was very accessible, prompt and courteous throughout the process. The cake was delivered looking fab and tasted great (so I hear from the actual consumers!). Thanks to the entire team for making my wish come true :)

I had ordered a photo cake which was in black forest flavour and square shaped 7 days before the delivery. It was supposed to be delivered at 1pm but it was delivered after calling a certain number of times at 3 pm. Please make your service fast. I was waiting on the store for 2 hours. :/ the cake looked and actually was nice but a customer wouldn't wait for 2 long hours!!!! And yes the chocolate pastry is nice too :)

This shop is just around where the gariahat flyover starts from the ballygunge side.
Easy to locate.
When I scanned throughout the panes there were oh-so- nice looking pastries n cakes...so I couldn't resist the idea of humping over them. üêà
Ordered a common black forest and chocolate paradise.üòä
Black forest was perfect with ample amount of cherry skins in it....and other one was just heaven as the name.
Prices were on the reasonable side.
I'll come back to this place for birthday cakes.. They have amazing collection of designed birthday cakes and cupcakes as well. üòá

Went to this place on a friends recommendation to order a birthday cake...it is very conveniently located. Coming to the service the staff is very courteous and over enthusiastic to help you. There's a wide range of cakes one can choose from the catalogue or you can also design your own cake. I had settled for a two pound butterscotch cake. The shop delivers the cake to your home. I was pleasantly surprised with thier punctuality. The cake was made beutifully and tasted awesome, it was moist and creamy. Would certainly recommend this place to others !

I were to travel two cities and finally reach my mother to celebrate her birthday. Her fiftieth. Big Deal.
So I had options to order from "cakes", "Kookie Jar" , "Mrs. magpie" etc etc , the top dogs.. But what I needed in that situation was an affordable + well designed + home delivered cake and that's where DMC comes in.
I talked on the phone and saw some reviews and ordered the Choco Flower Cake (1 lb) and it got delivered to my doorstep on time , even with complementary Magic candles with it.

The design was great, even though the shape (cross-section) wasn't perfectly circular and the cake seemed smaller to me than I expected.

Now, the best part is , the cake was so awesome to eat, one of the most well made cakes I have ever tasted. Kudos for that.

I write this review as a fan of DMC and would love to order cakes in the future as well as visit the joint in Gariahat.

Anybody who read this, Just try it.

This place lives up to its name. If you are planning to get a unique cake for your special occasion then this is the shop to head for. Located opposite to Gariahat AC market this joint is on the main road but is so small that you may miss it if you are not scanning for it minutely.

There are tiny animals showcased, in case you want some for decorating your cake. The owner of the shop actually discusses with you and guides you through the whole cake design. In my case, he gave me valuable inputs on the colour combination of my cake where the ‚Äòtweety‚Äô represented the birthday girl. I wanted the elephant & the lion on the cake to look cute & young, as they represented the two young cousins of the child. Soon he made the two cute animals & showed me for approval.
As we were ordering for the cake we tried out their chocolate roll and chicken puff. They were good. We also bought their Focaccia bread.

Everything went right for the cake, I had just one regret - they forgot to paint the feet of the tweety in orange (especially because the feet of the tweety had the pet name of the child inscribed). The owner tried to make the correction but it was too late.

However, apart from that small regret the cake turned out just the way I imagined it! Once the design was decided the owner advised me to go for chocolate truffle cake. I agreed to his suggestion and had no regrets when I saw my guests, from younger ones to the septuagenarians enjoying it. And the fact that the five pound cake was cheaper than the quotations I got from some of the best pastry shops in the city gave me more reason to smile. The cake looked cute, tasted yum and was competitively priced. I could have given this place a 4.5 if my tweety got orange legs but am surely heading for this place when I plan the next cake for my near and dear ones.

I have been going here since two years, when it was named Cake My Day. I have actually fallen in love with this tiny place and its tiny red chair. The interior has been nicely redecorated. And the addition of chicken items in the menu is a very wise decision. :D The shots, Caramel, Strawberry, Chocolate are delicious. The chocolate tart is my favourite for the molten chocolate which starts flowing as soon as you have your first bite. I am really not ashamed of the added calories and I keep going back to this place, again and again. :)

I had ordered a 2.75 lb butterscotch fondant cake for my parents 25th anniversary. From that sentence and the picture uploaded, one can see I had many conditions :-P
But their service was extremely hassle free. The instructions were followed to the dot. They would deliver anywhere and at anytime you would want. Not to forget, the taste was AMAZING! Was not a fan of butterscotch but they surely have made me now. My whole family loved it. Do give it a try :-)

This is like breaking news for me...I got another favourite cake shop apart from Kookie Jar and Cakes. It was my hubby's birthday and I was not feeling well to go out and buy a cake the previous day. Since Kookie Jar and Cakes do not home deliver I resorted to Zomato as my saviour. Firstly I'm very choosy about my cake...I'm being blatant that I can't eat cakes n pastries from mio amore, sugar n spice or Kathleen. This cake shop showed up on Zomato , it also mentioned home delivery done.Quickly went through the reviews and understood its benchmark. Called through Zomato. ..Spoke with Rahul ..he was fantastically courteous,  patient and cooperative. He listened to our choice and suggested accordingly. Got the delivery on time.They had also given complimentary magic candles. I had told him we like the ganache taste.The cake was superb.Soft chocolate truffle topped with chocolate ganache decorated with chocolate flowers.All this for 600rs including delivery. He mentioned they deliver across Kolkata. So foodies this place is passionately recommended. Budget friendly,  Superior quality,  Awesome taste. Celebrating with

I would very often try out their pastries and muffins whenever I was around Gariahat. Their prices are extremely affordable and the store is a delight to walk into, with its cute interior colour combination, in spite of not being too spacious! The other day I happened to buy a Chocolate Truffle Cake from them and boy, was it the most delicious one I've ever tasted. No kidding, but being a huge cake buff I end up eatimg a LOT of cake, like you know when I roll my eyes n say "a LOT", that kinda lot. But still nowhere else has chocolate truffle appealed to me this much. Either it's too moist n loose or too tight n sweet. This one was a delight right from the moment of slicing in! You can feel the texture if a cake when the knife dips into it! :D
And what's more, it's dark chocolate! Not to mention the designs are way too classy! <3
Birthdays to come, mine or anybody else's who's worthy of cake, Design My Cake is the place to go! :)

Whenever I have guests at home I go there for cakes and puddings, it's out of the world.
If I have to visit someone this is the ultimate place to buy goodies from.
Keep up the quality.

I was out with my college friend on a sunday evening and i wanted to have some cake badly. I searched on zomato for a new joint and found it out. We searched it so badly. I called the number provided on the zomato site but none picked up and finally found out that it was closed. After few hours the owner called me back and invited me and informed that they remain closed on Sundays which of course a bit awkward. 
    Nevertheless , i went there on a weekday afternoon when i was passing by the joint. It's located beside Gariahat prapti opposite to pantaloons, where 'cake my day' used to be. I ordered chicken jhaal farezi. It tasted good, spicy and hot just like its name. But chicken pieces are very less. Next i ordered chocolate avalanche. A crispy chocolate bowl filled with almonds, dark chocolate, brownie, liquid caramel justified its name. It tasted delicious and a must try for all chocolate lovers.
     I brought some butterscotch pastry and chocolate-butterscotch roll which is a new thing to me. A hard chocolate cylinder filled with butter scotch cream and tasted heavenly. All the items were very reasonably priced. More chairs would have been a good help.

Two, underfed and undernourished girls were passing by this cake shop at Gariahat when one of them popped the question and the other one dramatically accepted the proposal and entered this cake shop ! The smaller girl chose her favourite Nutty Cone made famous by hey favourite Kookie Jar and the bigger girl chose her all time favourite Chocolate truffle. Both were contented with their buys and gorged on their spoils blissfully, forgetting the perils of an increased waistline. They finished their eats, paid and came out, amazed and happy with their new find and surprised that they never saw this place before!

A surprise and by chance find on the gariahat stretch.. I am happy that I have found this little treasure of a bakery. I had their chocolate tulip which was a refreshing change from¬† all that is available in the usual market. It was rich, soft chocolate mousse topped with praline and caramel in a mouth watering chocolate shaped tulip. The quality was superb, the chocolate and mousse soft and fresh. I will definitely recommend this to my family and friends and come back for more!

A week old, nicely done up, hole in the wall bakery,  Designmycake is a new addition to the ever-increasing dessert and savoury scene in South Calcutta. Strategically located opposite Pantaloons at the last point of the Gariahat shopping area, this shop should be fairly noticeable to people (I landed up here after a long diversion to ekdalia evergreen pujo pandal).

While the menu is yet to be up, based on a cursory look around, it seems to me that this place is an entrant in the mid-range affordable dessert category, with most pieces priced south of 50 bucks. Surely, pricing is its greatest advantage. 

The chocolate cake I had at 40 bucks (inclusive of tax), was rich, but a bit sweet for my tastes. There is also a textural inclusion underneath by keeping a chessboard white and black cake arrangement which I am not sure works to its benefit, since the white cake only interferes as dry and coarse element in a decently rich chocolate background. 

The pineapple pastry was decent, again slightly sweet for my tastes. 

Now what I have been slightly confused with is the brand location of this business. The name "designmycake' and the decor clearly indicate that it is more of a niche premium dessert place, but when you enter you find a bunch of affordable standard desserts. 

If it wants to target a more subtle palletted young crowd, it needs to change the product range and pricing to cover more premium items and improve upon the existing ones (more bitterness to chocolate, more freshness to pineapple and of course chuck that over-sweetened cherry on top).

If however it wants to retain the product range and wants to cater to the Gariahat crowd (mainly comprising of price-sensitive women customers, who want to carry food back home for family or have a quick value-for-money bite after shopping, and would probably be thronging to Cakes), then it needs a more homely bakery branding, which is familiar and accessible to its customer base.
