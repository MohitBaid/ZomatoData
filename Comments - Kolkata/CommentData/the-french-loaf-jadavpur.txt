It is a comparatively new outlet. Opened up early December. It is located at Sulekha more. They were still finishing the floor when I visited. There was a BOGO offer going on in desserts. So I ordered a Chicken Supreme and Chocolate Pyramid. The Chicken Supreme was bread with Chicken sausages inside it. It was very tasty and the bread was really soft. The Chocolate Pyramid was amazing. It had a coating of chocolate cream outside which was delicious. It could have been a bit more soft though. The staff was very courteous and efficient. They have a nice seating arrangement at the back. The d√©cor was great too. 
Edit 1: On another occasion, I tried their black forest. It was delicious too
