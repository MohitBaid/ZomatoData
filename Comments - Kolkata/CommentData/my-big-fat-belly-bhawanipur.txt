Finally visited this place, after hearring a lot about it and it was a quite nice experience. The space is very small and cozy. The decor is rustic and defines the space with its lamps and other little details. Coming to the food, pretty good. The only thing on the menu card, which was deceiving was the BFB special wings with some ghost chilli sauce, as its description seemed dangerous so, we ordered the medium level spicy, but it was not that spicy. Should've ordered the "phaadu" level. The winter menu special, crab cake burger was finger licking good. Then there was a dish with chicken skewers, herb rice and makhni gravy, which had great portions of chicken and tasted yumm! Value for money is a 7/10, because it is a bit costly, is what I felt. But all around, totally recommendable.üëç

Celebrated by 21st birthday here. I was in constant doubt whether I was taking the right decision by giving a treat here. Well, as it turns out, it was an amazing decision and everyone enjoyed a lot.
The Restaurant is a bit small for the¬† number of customers they receive. The food and service was amazing though. We ordered a lot, but i do remember "The Big Bong Burger". One of the best burgers i ever had.

In a nutshell, a great place to eat. Enjoy. Keep Eating!

This was my first time here and I am already in love with this place <3

Ambience: A little cosy restaurant with good interior that makes you feel like you are in an American cafe!¬† But it could be expanded, as there are only a 8-10 tables!

Service: Staff is decent and service was prompt!

Food: To cut a long story short- it literally blew us away!
We ordered the following:

1.¬† Watermelon Mojito: A sweet one! One can get the real taste of watermelon. And why not, there were chunks of watermelons in it <3¬†

2. Ginger Orange Mojito: Refreshing unusual taste.. tangy as well as not too sweet! It was great !

3. Chicken Wings in Ghost Sauce: As the name suggests its very spicy XD Beware if you cant handle spices! It comes in varying spice levels: Regular, Medium, Phaadu! We took the Medium one and yeah it was real spicy. I wonder how much more spicy is the Phaadu one !

4. The Ultimate Jucy Lucy Burger: BEST BURGER EVER. It was just lipsmacking. Careful with it, because it is too juicy as the name ssuggests. Must try!

5. Grilled Chicken Burger: This one was great too. Contained Grilled Chicken, Lettuce, Texan Mayo, Caramelised Onions, Fried Egg and Cheddar Blend Cheese.

6. Al Pacino: A Thin Crust Pizza with generous amount of chicken and cheese and other ingredients! A true tummy satisfaction :)

7.¬† Blueberry Cheesecake: Perfect dessert to end your meal. Delicious and quite filling.

Value for Money: In 1.5k 2 people can eat their heart out! Totally Worth It.

We ordered two caesar salads, one russian mafia sandwich and one bacon wrapped prawns. Salad was good and prepared with a rather oily but great tasting dressing. Chicken was in good quantity and addition of capers was a nice touch.

Russian mafia sandwich looks big and tastes great. One must be prepared with great appetite and complete disregard for calories. This is one truly filling and tasty treat.

Lastly, for a reason, the bacon wrapped prawns. Nothing much can be said about them. Extremely oily and a complete nonsense relish to go along with that. Bacon wrapped prawns cooked properly are heavenly and very fulfilling. This is not one of them.

Place itself has a nice setup and we didn't have to wait for long for our orders.

The place lives up to its name, you will come out with a big fat belly. Their menu is so tempting that you will want to try it all. The burgers are one of the best that I have come across. It is juicy and succulent and ticks off all the taste buds in your mouth. The place is really small but cozy with a lively ambiance. The walls have cute posters of food and the ceiling was done with old wooden doors and windows giving it a rustic kinda feeling. I would love to go back and try the rest of their menu.

APPETIZERS 
1. 4pcs BACON WRAPPED PRAWNS
This dish a cult classic tasted mouthwatering and lived upto our expectations.  It was served with garlic infused mayo and a spicy chutney that complimented the dish.

Main course
1. Cheese fondue with non veg platter consisting of breads, masala sausages, bacon , roasted potatoes, olives 

Dessert 
1. CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE
2. EGGLESS BLUEBERRY CHEESE CAKE


Both the cakes were top knotch with absolutely  spot on flavours !

The name itself says it all!¬†

This place is a complete food paradise with delectable food sure to leave you with an overindulging belly after a hearty meal.¬†

Coming to the food, i visited with a whole bunch of foodie group to try out this place for the first time. The menu was so lavish that it was tough to decide but we settled finally on - Fried chicken burger, butter chicken risotto, cheesy magherita pizza, non veg fondue and chicken lasagne.

Once again i was in food heaven. The creamy texture, the flavorsome aroma and the perfect presentation made it all worthwhile.¬†

Non veg Fondue Platter.. It came with a variety of chicken and the yummiest hot cheese.

Lasagne.. Ever had a lasagna that was prepared inside the crust of a bread loaf? This was indeed a creative item we tried and loved.. The bread crust was perfectly done, buttery and crunchy which enhanced the taste completely.

Butter chicken risotto... A wholesome meal with the perfect blend of flavours and spices. It did wonders to my taste buds.

Fried Chicken Burger ... Juicy, crunchy and cheeesy..... a perfect tummy filler.¬†

And any meal is incomplete without dessert... and when its blueberry cheesecake you can just say WOW.¬†

This is must visit guys...!! The foodie in me just hit a new level with this one :) GO VISIT.

The best Risotto in town, and definitely by a long margin. The best thing about this place is the behaviour of the staff as they give you ample of suggestions regarding what to order given your taste and your appetite. The best thing to do is to take suggestions regarding what's best and what to order. 

P.S: Do order the Mixed Fruit Mojito. You're welcome.

Had gone in for lunch to this hole in the wall restaurant, was surprised to find the place packed, we had to wait for 20 minutes just to get a sitting (well they have only 5-6 tables). It‚Äôs a small establishment but packs a punch with the dishes it serves. We had ordered two different Veg Burgers and a pizza, they looked great and tasted even better. The servings were large making the pricing reasonable. We also had some mocktails, it was good. Would love to come back or get home delivery from the place so I can try other items on their menu.

Celebrated my best friend's birthday here.
Could not have been more pleased.

I can't remember exact names of the dishes but the Pizza and both the burgers bowled us over.
The burger patty was perfectly juicy and so wholesome.
The pizza was thin crust and perfectly tangy with chunk chicken pieces.
The meat platter was really great too! It had a good assortment, complete with pork along with chicken and fish.
The pasta was as cheesy and flavorful as one could possibly imagine. Although, I'd personally prefer spaghetti over penne, they've left no room fo
The only complaint would be the fish and chips, which had a pungent odour and we could barely finish it.
But the drinks and the mango cheesecake made up for it.
It's a good place for hanging out, however they have limited space so waiting often becomes imperative.

A walk away from elgin road this is a small, pretty restaurant tucked in the corner of a street. 
Its got a very chick interior and seating arrangement that can accommodate like 20 people. 
The ambience is super nice with a rustic charm to the cafe and the lights there are amazing. 
The food was simply awesome.
Reloaded Cheese cigars - Fried sticks filled with cheese, couldn‚Äôt taste better. It‚Äôs accompanied with a chilly strawberry sauce which tastes nice and is very unique.
Herb fried chicken - Deep fried boneless chicken chunks served with mayo this is again a comfort food though I expected the chicken to be a bit more soft but tastes amazing.
Al pachino - Aha this was one damn pizza as good as the legendary actor himself. Basil and generous sprinkle of olive oil lifted it to another level a must try indeed. 
VIRGIN mojito - like any other mojito but the thing i liked was that it was a tad bit less sweet and that made the lemon flavour more intense. A pircher can be enough for 3 people. 
Blueberry cheesecake - Heavenly. Couldn‚Äôt be better and it is less expensive than other places. 

Overall a fantastic place to drop in for any meal any time any day. Amazing food, service and decor. 
Cheers !!

My "Favorite" place to be. This restaurant is on Sarat Bose Road ,South Kolkata. 
It's a small restaurant which accommodates 5 tables . Don't let the looks decieve your thoughts because the food served here is absolutely lip smacking. 
Food - 
* The Big Bong Burger - it had tender fleshy meat seared in oriental spices ,punched with fried eggs and lettuce . It was served along with onion crispies ,French fries and mayo dip.
* The Ultimate juicy lucy Burger- there are options for (chicken /lamb) my personal favorite is the lamb one. The lamb/chicken melts in your mouth. It is served with fried onion rings, mayo dip and French fries.This burger is out of the world . You must try this burger. 
*Al Funghi belifier - it's a thin crust pizza which has mushrooms tomatoes and topped off with mozerella and cream cheese . It's filling and quiet tasty .
*virgin mojito (watermelon)- It's the most refreshing drink ...punched with lime mint watermelon and crushed ice . It's the best drink anyone can ask for.
Service and value for money- service is quick and the staffs are really helpful. This place is moderatly expensive as it serves quality food with authentic tastes . The prices levied are completely justified .I will highly recommend everyone to go and visit this place.  It's hands down "burger lover's paradise".

Went for dinner on the 1st of Jan of 2018.
Food that we ordered are Fresh lime soda, Non veg fondue platter, Chicken lasagne, Al pacino pizza, some pasta in white sauce (forgot the name), Chicken juicy lucy burger, Pork chop with rice.

What I liked:
1. Food presentation is very good.
2. Quality and taste of food are good.
3. The fondue platter is exeptional.

What I disliked:
1. Waiting time for some dishes are high.
2. Service is a bit slow.
3. All the food that we had are unique in their own way but at last the taste is quite similar and that is due to the cheesy flavour. It seemed, we had variety of food but taste is very similar.

This place keeps getting better and better every time I visit. The obvious mention is the bacon bomb, which is simply otherworldly in taste! And honestly, somehow it tastes even more amazing each time I try it. Also worth mentioning are the grilled chicken steak and the Caesar salad. They also make some strong and tasty cold coffee.
The staff is really polite. And the interior is very cozy.

This place is a foodie paradise.. Just as the name suggests, its better if you have a big belly to stuff all the good food into or they'll make sure you leave with one after your visit.
Jokes apart.. This little place really is a good one. The staff are hospitable and warm.
Coming to the main thing. Food.
For drinks we had two mocktail pitchers
For starters we had two pizzas, one of the best.. Nonveg pizza with bell peppers and Veg mushroom pizza. Both were mouthwatering. Later we had Non-veg bruschettas, one with mushroom and chicken topping and the other with tomato chicken topping. 
Later for the main course we took
Non veg Fondue Platter.. It came with different types of chicken and the yummiest cheese 
Chicken stew with rice - it was a comfort to have this wholesome dish
Mixed Meat Lasagne - have you had lasagna that was prepared inside the crust of a big loaf? This was a new thing we tried and loved.. The bread crust was perfectly done, buttery and crunchy and it added more taste to the lasagna
Bigde Nawab Burger - another delicious one.. Their burgers are great and so was this.. The patty was unlike anything I've tasted before.. 
For the desserts we had
Tiramisu - what better way to end a meal than a soft melt in the mouth zingy tiramisu
Blueberry cheesecake which was great too

Overall this is an amazing place for a foodie.. They also have two food challenges always on. One where you have to finish a maharaja burger within 20 mins and another eat hot chilli. Its fun and if you can do it, you get your picture up at their Wall of Fame.. Fun, good food, warm service - a highly recommended place

Firstly i have to apologise for being too much of a glutton (and proud to be one) and not having any pics of this place. But then you should blame the appeal of the food of this place that makes you forget everything and just gobble it down! The place gives off this cool cafe vibe with its interior arrangement and presentation. Maybe a bit more brightness is recommended though. The service was good, waiters were polite and took good care of the customers. The food was awesome. We ordered chicken the ultimate juicy lucy burger and ghost pepper wings of the phadu variety. The burger is recommended to everyone- if u enjoy having a good burger with a juicy patty and excellent flavours, you're gonna love this. And the onion rings on the side were just love. Now as for the wings, there are 3 varieties of the sauce and kids, the phadu variety is not for you. It truly delivers on its promise of being spicy but they also provide this awesome mayo on the side to temper it down, in case you can't handle the heat. Overall we had a good time with great food, and definitely looking forward to visit again.

What i loved the most was grilled chicken burger .. i just cant get over the wowness of the food . Margherita reg pizza was another tasty treat ..  the crust were so thin , perfectly baked and toppings were delicious though thin . A medium size wud suffice 2 peopl if u r going to order more of delicacies.
Last bt not the least , brownie shake just completed our meal with loads of sweetness and coolness. ‚ù§
Looking forward to go there again . 
The decor is so so and place is a bit too small , cant accomodate more than 20 peopl .

As the name aptly suggests, this place will make sure you leave with a filled up tummy for sure. One really needs to have a huge appetite to try out all their amazing Italian & American delicacies. All the dishes are cooked to perfection and the quantity is more than enough for two. The d√©cor adds brownie points to the place and also the ambience is really great. the service was fast and really good. You can find groups of every age group hanging out and relishing some great food and conversation.

I went for a late lunch with some of my friends and thoroughly enjoyed our time there. Every dish was luscious and flavorful. Started with some beverages we opted for two mocktail pitchers - 
‚Ä¢ Watermelon Lemonade 
‚Ä¢ Orange Lemonade 
Both the drinks were really exhilarating and tasted too good. The food we ordered -
‚Ä¢ Al Funghi Bellifier Pizza 

‚Ä¢ Al Pachino Pizza (one of the best thin crust pizza I've ever had, this is totally recommended)

‚Ä¢ BFB non veg Bruschettas Platter 

‚Ä¢ Non Veg Fondue Platter (this is perfect dish for all meat lovers, and also the cheese was so rich and creamy. Best fondue ever)

‚Ä¢ Mixed Meat Lasagne ( Lasagne in a bread, this was a great idea to serve lasagne and the bread adds more flavor to it) 

‚Ä¢ Bigde Nawab Burger - delicious and really tough to finish even by two people.

For Desserts, we tried the -
‚Ä¢ Tiramisu 
‚Ä¢ Blueberry Cheesecake 
Loved both of them and actually had it till the last bite. Overall, if you wish to savour delicious food with great ambience & a good chat this is the place to be at.

Our second visit to the place was a tad more disappointing than the first. Here is what I noted:
The round tables were both wobbly. We shifted to the high tables but the seating was not comfortable. In addition, the table had some dirt (probably old food) lying there which the cleaner missed. My daughter and I both kept glancing at it... Somewhat disturbing, till, I brushed it off.

For drinks, we had Cold Coffee, Strawberry Shake (both nicely done), and the Fresh Lime Soda which was very nicely done served in a long tall straight glass. Starters was the Herb Fried Chicken, which though of sizeable portion, was more of spice than herb. It could have been softer, and perhaps thinner. The dip was niceeee!

My wife had the chicken steak which was okay, got cold by the time she got to it. My daughter tried the Gardinere Bellifier Thin Crust Pizza with added mushroom. Very well done I must say. I opted for the Bacon Bomb, as recommended by them. The pork was on the drier side, and I didn't much care for the spice flavouring. The rice too wasn't great, and it seemed to have been simply microwave-warmed, and turned out dry. Overall, the dish could have been better prepared.

Overall portions are ample, perhaps a little more than expected. We could not finish the food, but also for some reason all three felt bloated midway through our meal.

Service¬† was friendly, though on the slower side, the starters took long, and one main course was got immediately along with it.

I do not like the seating at all... I am more traditional as far as my choice of restaurant seating is concerned. The food tends to be over spiced, and also I felt the restaurant looked a wee bit more faded than I saw it last.

What I love is the menu on offer. There really needs to be more places that offer such food, including the made to order chicken and pork sausage they serve.

As interesting is the name , so are the interiors. Loved the decor and the ambience . We had a watermelon pitcher to start with , which I really liked. The tangy taste was just perfect.
For starters , mushroom pizza fritte - mushroom dumplings wrapped in pizza bread. The filling was extremely yummy. The dips - pesto and tomato was superb.
Veg cheese fondue - the cheese sauce was commendable. The breads, panner pieces, fries tasted good with the cheese dip.
Veg lasagne - I had never seen a lasagne served in this way. It looked like a huge garlic bread scraped from inside . This bread was enveloping the lasagne.
Agarwal ji burger - this big and filling burger will make ur day. Very well presented.  The chutney inside the syringe adds a totally different flavour to it 

Finally we ordered a blue berry cheese cake- looked beautiful, tasted amazing. The flavour was very different from what I have had before.

This place reminds me of a place called truffles in Bangalore. Similar kind of energy is running through the place. Youngsters sitting inn groups, amazing music playing in the background, live mocktail counter right at the entrance. Though small, this place serves some real tasty food. The thin crust pizza Al funghi was simply delish. The mocktails were really refreshing. 
The lasagna was served inside a scooped French loaf style bread, full of flavours, exotic vegetables and cheese. Loved the cheese fondue too.
For desserts we had blueberry cheesecake- and tiramisu. Both the desserts were simply amazing. Liked the cheesecake better.

Went to this place today with a group of friends. The ambience is good. This place can accommodate about 15-20 people at a time. The ambience is really good. The staff were so so friendly and cordial. The service is swift and for the main attraction the food, I'm sure it can win anyone's heart.
We ordered Mocktails Pitcher, Non veg bruschetta,Mushroom pizza fritte, Non veg and veg fondue, Mixed meat lasagne, Veg lasagne, Bigde Nawab Burger,Aggarwal Ji Burger And for desserts we had tiramisu and blueberry cheesecake. Every dish was cooked to perfection but I loved the taste of the bigde nawab burger. It had checked keema egg and ample amount of cheese melting in my mouth. The Tiramisu was too good. Considering the food quality, this place is quite reasonably priced. Would love to visit again.

The location of this place is very convenient . The place is small but spacious and the seating arrangement is nicely done.. The lights above the tables are cute. 

Coming to the food, i wished i had bigger belly to load everything they have.. if you love spicy items you should order the CHICKEN WINGS IN GHOST SAUCE. We ordered the medium spicy one and it left us with tears in our eyes :P 
Next favourite thing from the list was- THE BIG BONG BURGER filled with lamb and egg, is too juicy and came with the sides of french fries, onion rings and coleslaw. 

For desert we wanted the choco mousse but it was unavailable so we opted for TIRAMISU and BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE. tiramisu was great and cheesecake was usual. 

I would like to visit again ‚úåÔ∏è

Rating a 5 to this special place must not come as a surprise to anyone who understands super delicious food at the highest quality. 2 Weeks ago my friend & I decided to have our lunch from this place since this was on our bucket list from its inception. The outlet is located just opposite of Dugout on sarat bose road. The outlet is a tad bit small which could become a problem during rush hours. We luckily had got our seats without any problem. The decor is certainly eye catching & would remind you of a food bar kind of place with full of vibrancy.

Anyways moving onto the food part, we got ourselves the following:-

1. Green Apple Iced Tea - We availed a pitcher of this which comes in the quantity of 1 Ltr. The ice tea was very refreshing & had the perfect tanginess of green apples which felt very soothing during our heavy meal feast. The quantity to price is spot on. Certainly a value for money drink. Recommended.

2. California Orange Cinnamon Blast - This is a mocktail which i found unusual & unique due to its name on the menu and hence I decided to give it a try. The mocktail was served had quantity of 250ml. The presentation certainly attracted my attention & looked very tidy. The infusion of cinnamon with orange juice juice was certainly a new combo to my tastebuds. This was decent & would be liked by anyone who has good fascination for cinnamon flavour.

3. BFB special chicken wings in ghost chilli sauce - It had 8pcs although half plate is also available at 6pcs. The wings had very spicy marination of ghost chilli sticky sauce with sprinkle of herbs over them. Mind you they serve the wings with skin on so everybody might not like it in that way but still the wings were simply delicious & was on the hotter side, so mind you on this. It is advisable to the non spicy eaters to customize the spice factor. Recommended.

4. Ultimate Juicy Lucy Burger - I took the chicken version after having high regards about the burgers and trust me i was not left disappointed after what i experienced. The nice burger with a juicy chicken patty with caramelized onion,bbq sauce,lettuce and a soft poached egg with onion rings. The palette also had french fries & coleslaw. The burger just blew us away with its taste & i would certainly swear by it. The french fries were also perfect with the coleslaw. The onion rings however felt a tad bit overfried. Also the burger would not suffice a heavy eater's apetite but should be enough for a person with low apetite.

5. Kosha Mangsho Burger - Who would have thought that a bengali favourite delicacy kosha mangshso would be turned into a burger version. This is their in house special item and certainly won our hearts. The kosha mansgho made out of mutton was super juicy. This also had french fries & coleslaw as accompaniment. Really lives up to its name. Recommended.

6. Al Pacino Pizza - They serve really large & super thin crust pizzas of 14 inch which is round about 8 slices. This was savoured by us gratefully. The contents of 3 different kinds of cheese namely mozzarella & feta was heavenly. The hint of basil & grilled chicken was also a treat our tastebuds.

Since we were too full to try the desserts so we decided to skip it. The bill was around Rs 1400 in total including GST %5. The service was good. Well i found this place to be flawless from every angle & was glad to be a part of the whole experience.

Finally we landed up here after months of unavoidable delays. Right from the moment of entering the place, it gave a vibe of hip. With a rustic steam-punkish decor, to the insanely heavy wooden furniture, all add to the tavern-like feel of the place. And to top it all off, a close look will make you realise the walls (and the ceiling!) are actually old wooden window and door panels, and the light fixtures are pipes and gauges.

We went for a burger and some fried chicken, so:

1. Herb fried Chicken - 4‚≠êÔ∏è
[crisp, to the point with the herbs. Would have preferred the inside to be a tad bit more softer, but the mayo/white sauce dip was THE DEAL!! Probable the best mayo dip I‚Äôve had in a long time!]

2. Juicy Lucy Burger (Chicken) - 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è
[not so Juicy, the burger was filling, yet it could have been a lot more]

Both the dishes came with AMPLE amount of French Fries with them. We tried something crazy by putting a piece of the herb chicken within the buns of the last bite of the burger...that was THE BOMB!!

We‚Äôd rate My Big Fat Belly a good 4.5‚≠êÔ∏è because of a special person, Mrs. Bhargav, the owner of the joint. This sweet lady made us feel at home, took an extra effort to make our first time visit a memorable one, small things like making sure we had extra plates to share the crumby food, etc. and in general a sweet lady to talk to.

P.S. They have a 12 pcs Ghost Chili Sauce Chicken Wings challenge...game on!!

I've always been a fan of small burger joints which do wiches and wings and shakes and stuff. This seemed like the perfect spot to get all of that and it delivers.
It's quite a compact space with some wall decors and high seatings around and an open kitchen.

What we ordered:

-Lets Nacho : really liked it. They had loaded it and it tasted fresh

-Chicken Wings : not at all to my liking. The were a bit chewy and I did not like the taste. Also I am not that great lover of chicken wings as my brother loved it

-Grilled Chicken Burger : good on size and served with fries and cloeslaw. Brilliantly done burger and the Patty as well the bun we're good with some fried egg

Murg E Azam Sandwich : this was the best of the lot. If I am ever going again,this is what I am getting

The service was quick and the prices were nominal

I came to BFB with the impressive response at Zomato on my mind and it did justify why . The place has limited sitting, but suffices for a small group and when a good conversation is what is in your mind. The menu is quite impressive, both in terms of variety and experiment. We order a basic Greek salad, French Fries, Bruchetta platter, a pizza and a cottage planner steak. For desert we had blueberry cheesecake and my personal favorite the Tiramisu. Tiramisu was disappointing in terms of texture. I have had better and would love them to improve upon it. The food was good, both in terms of taste and servings. A decent nice little place. I am definitely going back. And that minus point 5 for the Tiramisu!

Yesterday I went there for dinner. It's small food joint with some shady lightings. Not much decorated but gives you a vibe of New York street bars.So we ordered for BFB panko fish and chips which comes with tartar sauce and mayo-mustard sauce and french fries. It was an utterly delicious dish to start with.The fish was well marinated but with less salt.The tartar sauce was too delicious.Then we ordered for Porked you regular sized pizza, Chef's special bacon bomb and braised lamb shank in red wine gravy. The pizza was the winner of the evening, it comes with so generous amount of mashed pork sausages, bacon, pepperoni and salami and it was loaded with cheese. We requested to add bell peppers and mushrooms. A perfect meaty and cheesy combination it was. Highly recommended!! Bacon bomb was wrapped with bacon and inside it was loaded with minced pork and cheese. It comes with mashed potato and a sunny side up fried egg. The gravy was a perfect combo of herbs and sauces. The lamb shank comes along with mashed potato and herb rice. The lamb shank was quite dry inside, which was very disappointing. But again the gravy was too delicious.Pricing was good.So over all it's a nice experience here..

Situated on the main road, it has a sign in yellow light bulbs saying My Big Fat Belly.  However, half the lights were either too dim or not working at all. Inside is a very small place and it looks like it has been stuffed. When I went in it was pretty full and the table I got was near the toilet. Not the ideal place to sit and eat your meal. The plates were small and the decor didn't do much to improve the already bad first impression. 

Coming to the food. The ASSORTED BRUSCHETTAS were good, but the lettuce leaf in between the bread and the toppings were an unnecessary addition. The SUNDRIED TOMATOES AND CHILLY RISOTTO was good. Although I couldn't taste the chilly and I was glad that I couldn't. Just can't imagine chilly in a risotto. The LEMON ICE TEA was also a half hearted effort. I am sure I could have made the same if not a better ice tea than that. 

The service is horrible again. The staff don't bother noticing when you call them. And when I asked the one of the guys want he recommends he was confused and ultimately said pasta, although I believe this place is popular for its burgers. I ended up trying neither. 

Overall, to sum it up. Not the best place to sit and it in, bad service and decent food. Only plus point is that it's decently priced but that's no compensation. I don't think I will be going her again and definitely not be recommending it either.

Don't go by the size of this place. It might be a cute little cafe but the food they serve is really big on quality and quantity!
Ambience- what they lack in space is made up by the warm welcoming vibes and beautiful innovative decor.
Food- we had a pepperoni meat lovers pizza, a juicy Lucy Burger and a fried prawn dish.
The pizza was amazing. Meaty and drenched in olive oil just the way it should be. The prawn dish was a letdown and could have been better. The Burger was however the star. True to its name it was juicy, came with a big fat meat patty and a poached egg over it. It was served with fries and onion rings. Oh I loved it.
Pocket pinch- around 900-1000.
Overall- highly recommended!

We ordered Walk from Chowringhee and Juicy Luicy. It's awesome.Patty is awesome. Chowringhee has a fish patty while the Juicy Luicy comes with a choice of chicken or lamb. We ordered a chicken wings plate. Its awesome but spicy.The restaurant has a good ambience too.In short it's a paradise for burger lovers.

Walk in for the Pizza, stay for the fiery Wings and When I say fiery, I mean, bhoot jholakia( Naga King Chilly) fiery!! Yeah two things, don‚Äôt have it to prove a point and don‚Äôt order the ‚Äòphaadu‚Äô category, which implies that they will soak it in naga chillies!! If you are looking to enjoy an authentic bite, settle down with the medium category and dig in for a tasty surprise!! They are hot, so if you are not used to sweating through the back of your neck while you gorge on them, don‚Äôt try and take a curious or courteous bite, YOU WILL REGRET IT!! For people who enjoy heat in their food, it is a delight!!!

Located just opposite Duggot in Elgin Road, it might seem to be a small n not so happening place..! The place is not rather big but the interiors give you a feel of the 80‚Äôs.. Nice and cozy ambiance..!
The menu has quite a lot of good options so you might as well have to do some amount of brainstorming.. The service and the staff behaviour is very much up to the mark..
Coming to the food everything that we ordered was just amazing..
For all the veg lovers I would definitely suggest:
‚Ä¢ The Cheese Sigar - they are crispy and the dip they are served with is üòã 
‚Ä¢ Agarwal ji Burger - It‚Äôs a burger with a complete twist.. There‚Äôs coriander and tamarind chutney instead of the typical cheese slice and the patty is of peans, paneer with Bhujia as the sides which is truly insane..! üëª
‚Ä¢ Signature Garlic Bread
‚Ä¢ Lemon Ice Tea - perfect flavour and very refreshing
I also tried the Lucy Jucy Chicken Burger which also was good just the patty was a little hard but the taste compensated for the same..

I would say if u still have not been to this place you surely must try visiting it once..

Not a very big place but has a good ambience and great food. We had the famous big bong Burger and seriously guys it's a must try coz it tastes awesome! Then Annie Aunty's Alfredo pasta was also very tasty. Then we had ginger orange mohito and Oreo shake which was pretty good . But one thing which was not that great was juicy lucy 'veg' burger . Choco decant mousse cake was a great way to end the dinner ; it had rum and coffee too mixed in it which tasted delicious! In all a good experience.

It's a small and a decent place, located at the opposite foot of The Dugout. For a big group, you might have to wait for a while to get a place there. The ambience is cool. 
When we visited, the waiter had forgotten to ask us about our order :D Hence, we called him and gave the order. We ordered Gardinere Bellifere Pizza and Aglio Olio V2 Spaghetti. Pasta wasn't very good, but satisfactory. But, the pizza was superb. We had a great time there.

One of the best places in town definitely. This place is mostly crowded and is perfect for hanging out with friends. This one particular cafe has won my heart and their hospitality was really good. The manager there was extremely polite and kept a thorough check on the food quality served to the customers and his customer's well being. The place has a nice ambience and yet again a good playlist. A live burger and drinks counter.
Coming to the food, well there was not one single dish that lacked taste or quality or quantity.Each of the food items¬†was unique in its own way and was equally¬†lip-smacking.
Items tried:¬†1. BFB SPECIAL CHICKEN WINGS IN GHOST CHILLY SAUCE-- I have never had a softer and juicier plate of chicken wings. Equally tasty and tossed in exquisite sauces with a rich hot flavour. Also a small recommendation if you do not like hot and spicy food try choosing the regular sauce from the 3 variants.
2. MURG-E-AZAM-- Now who will not love tasty chicken tikka pieces in their sandwiches? This absolutely die for signature big belly witch is sufficient¬†to fill your tummy even if you are extremely hungry. The sandwich is filled with mayo and cheese and lots of tikka pieces and served with fries and sauce.
3. THE ULTIMATE JUICY LUCY (CHICKEN)-- This was the tastiest dish of theirs. The chicken patty was absolutely the best chicken patty you will ever find inside a burger in Kolkata. seasoned with fresh herbs, filled with lots of cheddar cheese, caramelised onion and poached egg. Served with fries and mixed mayo and onion rings.
4. WATERMELON VIRGIN MOJITO-- A very refreshing drink having blended mint, crushed ice and watermelon syrup.¬†
5. BLUEBERRY SHAKE-- I loved the presentation of this particular dish more than the drink itself. Although this was a really creamy and tasty drink. This served as a pretty dessert to us more than a drink.¬†
The pocket pinch was extremely reasonable. I will absolutely recommend this place to everyone and also their juicy lucy burger.Refer to my account for more pictures and reviews of other food joints.

A restaurant that hits you with its warm homely atmosphere inside. The lighting is carefully done to make it feel so. There is a 80s feeling to the cafe. The quirky graphic posters and Table one liners is sure to crack you up. Service is quite nice here. Coming to the main attraction, the food. 
Everything is perfectly made till the garnishing. 
My personal favourite been Quinoa chicken salad and Bellizzaass (big sized signature pizzas)  and also California Orange Cinnamon blast. A special mention is that this place makes one of  the best salads in the city. Not everyone can do that. Also I aim on taking up the BIG FAT CHALLENGE soon.. Will keep updating. Till then all hail to Big Fat Belly üòâ

This place was bookmarked on zomato from a long time. Finally made a visit. Located at a very posh locality of bhawanipore it is very easy to find. It is a cute little place which seats 24 pax at one go.Quirky interiors with an upbeat lightning fixtures.

Coming to the food now. We ordered quite a few food items.
‚ñ™Cheese cigar
‚ñ™Signature garlic bread
‚ñ™Alfungi bfb
‚ñ™Big bong burger
‚ñ™Shroomy speghatti
‚ñ™Decadent mousse cake
‚ñ™Tiramisu
‚ñ™Watermelon Mojito

All the food items were just fantabulous. Loved each and everyone. The big bong burger was the standout along with the tiramisu. The service is also up to the mark and pricing is justified.

Verdict: This place is a Big tick in the box.I shall return very soon. Highly recommended for all!.

This Sarat Bose road restaurant,located just opposite Dugout had been lying on my wishlist for quite sometime. Finally decided to visit this place and I must talk a little about their quiry decor with funky lights and cutesy posters. The live drinks counter adds a jazzy effect to this place. But if one decideds to visit this place in large numbers then it should be booked in advance because it is not a very spacious place where only 15-20 people can dine at the sane time.
This place lives up with the service,with courteous and well behaved staff and prompt service.
Coming to the food,we had ordered:
‚Ä¢Peach iced tea
‚Ä¢Chicken Sausages
‚Ä¢Chicken salami garlic loaf
‚Ä¢Alpachino bfb
‚Ä¢Chicken jucy lucy burger
‚Ä¢Butter chicken rissoto
‚Ä¢Blueberry cheesecake.
One would definitely have a big fat belly after gorging on the amazing food by My BFB.
Looking forward to next visits.

As the name suggests "my big fat belly" which is exactly what you need to have incase you plan to visit this placeüôà. Because this place has got so many amazing things to offer that you'll be left with a full tummy for sure‚ù£. Starting with the location and its ambience, this place is basically located at Sarat Bose Road right opposite to The Dugout. It has a really cute and funky interior along with some cool posters hanging around. The only minus point about this place is that its quite small and there are limited amount of seats available. Hardly 15-20 people can dine in at a time. But, otherwise the food, the service and the staffs are really great. 
Also the prices are quite affordable with respect to the amount of foodüëçüèª.
So now coming on to the food, we tried a bunch of items from their menu which are- 
Starters-
1. Cheese Cigar- If you have a spicy taste and a big fan of cheese you are bound to love this one. I absolutely loved this and the way it melts in your mouth and you get that spicy effect it's amazingüòç. Also, the mayo & strawberry chilly sauce they gave along with this was equally goodüëåüèª.
2. Signature Garlic Bread- Being a big fan of garlic breads, this one was really good and soft as wellüòÄ
3. Watermelon Mojito- Must say this one was super refreshing and watermelon is love‚ù£üçâ
Main Course-
4. Alfungi bfb- This was the mushroom pizza topped with Italian tomato sauce, truffle oil, mozzarella cheese & cream cheese. To be honest I had such good pizza after a very long time. Also, the softness & thin crust made it all the more excitingüòç.
5. Big Bong Burger- this is something you have to try if you visit this place coz its totally worthit. It's quite different from the other burgers you get as they have replaced the patty/ tikki that you usually get with kosha mangsho‚ù£. Yes, you heard that right. This was my personal favourite out of all the other dishes. 
6. Shroomy spaghetti- Great in taste and has a creamy texture to itüëçüèª
And to put a perfect end to the amazing lunch, Desserts-
7. Decadent mousse cake which was so amazing‚ù£ and,
8. Tiramisu- just one word for this one, "heavenlyüòç"
(Do try this out)
Overall this is surely a must visit place. And I'm so happy to finally tick off this place from my bucket listüíû‚úîÔ∏è.

Nice cozy place.. Ordered the Squidgy Brownie Shake, Ultimate Juicy Lucy Burger (Chicken), Bacon Bomb and Special Chicken Wings (Phaadhu Chili Sauce).. I would have liked the Shake better if Milk used was more cold, and I would have preferred the wings if they were served minus the Coriander garnish.. apart from that, a great experience. definitely going back to try some more dishes from their extensive menu.

Located at chakraberia crossing,one can take the auto from deshapriya park and it will drop u just opposite to my big fat belly.
Having such a prime location is a big responsibility in itself as people come here with high expectations.
So on the day of my birthday my partner took me here on a surprise date ,he has been here before.
So the orders were tasted and tried by him
1.Bellisma Fries-just perfectly done French Fries topped with ranch dressing I presume,cheese and olives.served with tomato salsa and a peculiar tasting dip.
2.Cheese Cigars-These were flavour bombs.Loaded with cheese and served with a cheese dip.
3.Green Apple iced Tea- Perfect accompaniment to wash down your food.Very refreshing.
4.Big Bong Burger-This one was the show stopper.Kosha mangsho shredded and topped with a sunny side up.served with beer battered onion rings and French Fries.Totally droolworthy.
The decor is nicely done.Will give you a very cost feeling.Though there is a bit of space crunch....you can see your drink getting prepared in front of you.
Service needs a bit of improvement.All our orders weren't gapped accordingly.
But nevertheless.Had a nice time.
HappyEating!

I visited this awesome little place this afternoon with a bunch of cool friends and above all foodies for life..had a lot about this place and am happy I ticked it off my list.. although it was a week day but it turned out to be a packed house..
Now coming to the food this is what we ordered... though we felt like ordering everything from their super amazing menu we stuck to the following..
Watermelon Mojito as coolers (oh so refreshing)
Cheese cigars( they actually ooze out cheese and melt in your mouth) and signature garlic bread (highly recommended as you have not had anything like this before) as starters..
Alfungi bfb ( thin crust mushroom pizza loaded with extra cheese) and big bong burger ( HIGHLY RECOMMENDED... the one of its kind where the patty is replaced by shredded kosha mangsho..a one of its kind of experience)
Shroomy spaghetti( perfect spaghetti cooked in cheese sauce)
Decadent mouse cake( ultimate decadence..you can actually feel it)
Tiramisu (soft and velvety..rich in taste)
And this was not all the amount of effort put in was seen all over..may it be the staff or the service..
My big fat belly you have touched my heart..kudos and keep up the good work..

This place is what you call 'Chota Packet Bada Dhamaka.'The place is a small one but the food over here is exceptional.
Located at Sarat Bose Road just opposite to the Dugout.
I visited this place for Lunch today and Now I want to go back for dinner again.The food over here is that good.A Foodies paradise. The staff was very friendly and the service was good too.The place is beautifully decorated and the chairs and seating arrangement adds to the charm of the place.All in all this place has a great ambience.Now coming to the Food.
What I had there
*Cheese Cigar (Recommended)
A bite into it & u could see Cheese oozing out.The dip they serve with it is amazing.
*Chicken Sausages
It was good.
*Chicken Salami Garlic Loaf (Recommended)
Garlic Bread loaded with pieces of Chicken Salami.
*Alpachino BFB (Chicken Pizza) (Strongly Recommended)
One of the better Pizzas I have had in a long time.
*Big Bong Burger (Strongly Recommended)
Bongs you will just love this.The perfect fusion of Kosa Mangsho and Burger. Good thing they have shredded the mutton and not made it into a patty.
*Butter Chicken Risotto (Strongly Recommended)
Risotto in a butter chicken Gravy?
Was a bit curious how it would taste but then this was awesome. I can go back again and again just to have this.

This was great too.

Don't let the tiny size of this place fool you, this place is a foodie's paradise. It's a cross between an American diner and an Italian bistro with an occasional glimpse of Desi Tadka.
Me and my friends had ordered the following items from their impressive menu :
Watermelon Mojito
Cheese Cigar
Signature Garlic Bread
Alfungi bfb (mushroom pizza)
Big Bong Burger
Butter Chicken Risotto
Decadent Mousse Cake
Tiramisu

Where do I start? Each and every dish was PERFECT. The cigars were perfectly crunchy with gooey melted cheese oozing out in every bite, the garlic bread was baked to perfection and this too came with cheesy toppings.
The pizza was one of my favourite items from the menu as I love vegetarian pizzas with a thin crust and this one was bursting with mushroom chunks and the crust was wafer-thin. After all of these vegetarian dishes we went for the ultimate meat dish of My BFB - The Big Bong Burger. The succulence of the kosha mangsho reduction nestled in the heart of the buns with a soft, pillowy sunny side-up egg works wonders on your palate. The next item we had was also a fusion dish like the last one, it was 'butter chicken risotto'. They perfectly fused two classics, the butter chicken of India and the risotto of Italy and presented us with a mind-blowing dish.
The star of the show were the desserts though. Much to my excitement we ordered the Tiramisu which is my ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE DESSERT, I loved how they balanced the sweetness from the sugar and cream and the bitterness from the coffee powder and cafe liquer. The choco decadent mousse cake, true to its name was 'decadent' : a sinfully rich dessert.
We washed all of it down with an extremely refreshing pitcher of watermelon mojito.
Do visit this place if you are a fan of frill-free diner-type food, with a twist.
It's easy to locate and quite reasonably priced in accordance to the quality and taste of food.

My Big Fat Belly was on top of my list, for a long long time because of the reviews it was getting. Finally got the opportunity to visit. The place is tiny, but the decorations have been done in a way that will brighten up your mood. Had ordered the Big bong Burger, the Chicken Steak, and a Tiramisu. The Big Bong Burger is a MUST try. Hands down, it is one of the most tastiest burger I have ever had, the pulled lamb in mustard sauce is just perfect. However be prepared to make a mess while eating it :P The steak was also good, though I didn't quite like the Tiramisu.

Prices are fine, quantity is fine.The service is also fast. Hopefully they will move into a bigger space.

Happy Eating!

If you are a real foodie then this place is definitely for you.The cafe is easy to locate stands opposite Dugout (near chakraberia crossing).The outlet is a bit small with limited space.But its like "chota packet bada dhamaka".Within a limited space they try immensely to satisfy your appetite for food.The price which are mentioned in the zomato menu is different from the menu we were provided with.We ordered Grilled chicken Burger,Grilled fish in gondhoraj lemon sauce,stuffed cheesy loaf.All of them were marvellous.You must have burger when you come to this place.And for desert we ordered Tiramasu,which is again an awesome prep.Staffs are polite and need to be much more active.And lastly I wish them luck and look forward to pay another visit.üòä

Ordered one Big Fat Belly Calypso Pizza from here today...Unfortunately the only good thing was the big red box in which the pizza came...
It was a bit too thin crust...but yeah that can be dealt with...Toppings were okayish...But it had like almost no cheese in it man...For 521 bucks you better put some cheese in your pizza...It felt like such a dry pizza that we had to dip it in tomate sauce to gulp it down...Very disappointing experience :(

Re-Review -- So they sent me another pizza today...the same calypso one as mentioned before...Certainly this one tasted better...Much less drier...Didn't need tomato sauce to have it...Yet i still feel the quantity of cheese needs to be worked upon...I was actually wanting a cheesy dip or something to have it nicely...
I understand its thin crust pizza...But still...I have had much cheesier thin crust pizzas...There are customisations available to add more cheese but that would further hike up the price...Its already quite well priced...So the normal one itself should be having more cheese...The toppings are good and crispy thin crust is also fine...Just add more cheese guyzz..and it will taste much better...Thanks for the free pizza though...Good customer service...üëçüòé

As the name suggests, this place is ideal for guys with big fat belly. The place compensates space crunch with innovative decor and mouth watering delicacies. Be it thin thin crust pizzas or bong burgers, they give dominoes/ Mc D's a run for their money. Make sure to visit this joint with enough appetite and you won't leave disappointed.

Went to have lunch today. The place is small and cozy  and the decor is really quirky. The service of the serving staff was impeccable. Coming to the food, we ordered THE RELOADED CHEESE CIGARS, THE ULTIMATE JUICY LUCY BURGERS and CHICKEN MAC n CHEESE.  The cheese cigars were mediocre, nothing mind blowing. The Mac n cheese was really delicious and sumptuous, whereas the burger was a let down. Going by the rave reviews about this particular burger we ordered this one. But what we got was an average burger with a very small quantity of cheese and the taste was nothing unique as well. The prices of every items excluding the mac n cheese seemed a bit overpriced considering the portions they serve.

Prompt service was great, but the juicy Lucy burger wasn't up to the expectations as stated here by the reviewers. It was smaller than any burger from Hondo's even the cheap ‚Çπ200 MCB was bigger than that. And side dishes weren't able to make up for the hunger which was left in. Mac n cheese was awesome. And it should be the main attraction instead of the burgers. For burgers Hondo's is better and tastier.

Ahhh!!üòõ writing a review for this place brings water in my mouth.The location is great and easy to reach. Situated on Sarat Bose road opposite the Dugout.The ambience is cute, seems like Italishh..But the sitting area is small (Not great for throwing parties involving big groups).This is the only snitch.Coming to the food..The food is simply awesome, lip smackeringly delicious.And the potion size is quite good.We ordered Chickenora- many layers of chicken salami with basil tasted sooo goood...And the ultimate Juicy lucy burger...Caramelised onions perfectly blended with cheese just made a lasting impression..For desserts we had the Squidgy Brownie with ice cream which was absolutely delicious.
The staff are very friendly.And the pocket pinch is more than decent.
Looking forward to visit this place again soon.

A small little place on Sarat Bose Road this place is known for its burgers primarily. And I agree. Kolkata doesn‚Äôt have many sensational burger joints, but this place, one of the best I‚Äôve tried here so far. The burgers were delicious and the patty was juicy. The fries were crispy. However, their strawberry shake needs improvement. Overall, really liked this place.

Do try their juicy lucy burger, which as the name suggests is the juciest burger I have ever tasted.The perfect balance of the spices and the melt in the mouth meat will force you to go back again and again. Their fusion kosha mangsho burger is also delicious.who ever thought kosha mangsho can go so well with bread.

Locating just opposite Dugout, this cute place will win your heart with their appetising foods. I went there for family dinner and loved every bit of it. A small garage turned into food joint, my big fat belly has lot to offer ranging from burger to lamb shanks, grilled fish to bacon bomb and lot more. Food was extremely tasty and quantity was good too. In short I came out with a big fat satisfied belly after a lovely dinner.

This place was on my mind since long now . And finally we made a visit and I regret not coming earlier . This place is love .

It's basically an American Restaurant . The place is a little small but the sitting arrangements are done in a way that doesn't trouble you . The interiors are very well done . The walls are adorned by photo frames of different food items . 5/5 on ambience for sure .

We had a whole lot of food - From the mocktails , starters , pizzas , burgers and desserts and not a single item disappointed . Everything was on point .

My Recommendations :

Kiwi Ice Tea Pitcher : Very cool and refreshing . Just the thing you need on a sultry afternoon . Loved it .

Pili Pili Prawns : Prawns are love . I am mad about prawns and when you prepare it in a spicy sauce it automatically becomes awesome .

Peri Peri Chicken Satay : Brilliant . Loved these a lot . Spicy chicken is what I want everyday , everytime , every moment .

Al Fungi Pizza : This is the best Thin Crust Pizza you'll ever have . Hands down . üëå

Big Bong Burger : This is the SHOWSTOPPER . The Bong reference is the Kosha Mangsho that you find in the burger . This is huge . Served along with fries this burger's taste will remain on your taste buds for long . Writing this , I am craving for it again .

Coming to the desserts ,

Tiramisu : Just the right amount of sweetness , this one is for those who don't have extra sweet desserts . This coffee flavoured Tiramisu is a hot favourite .

Blueberry Cheesecake : Just like the pizza here , this is the best cheesecake I ever had . Cheesecake lovers out there , you need to give this place a visit for the sake of this cheesecake .

Other Dishes we had were Spaghetti with Meat Balls , Cheese Cigars , Butter Chicken Rissoto , Chickenora Pizza , Roasted Chicken , Watermelon Pitcher , Mousse Cake and Bailey's cake . Everything was top notch .

Service : Very friendly staff . Helping you with everything you want . KTT time is impressive which is a very important factor for me at least .

MUST ViSIT :)

Ordered Lamb shank in red wine sauce. It was aweful.  First the quantity was scanty in comparison with the price.  We ended up paying 399+GST=471 for this. And the taste of the sauce was also mediocre. 
Not sure about other items.  This was a great disappointment.

We ordered Cheese Cigars ar Herb Fried Chicken as starters, Juicy Lucy Lamb Burger and Mac n Cheese with Chicken as mains. Juicy Lucy lamb is a standout, tasted better than Chilis burgers even! In an earlier visit had also had the Bacon Bomb which was superb. 
They also gave a complimentary cheesecake on asking as it was a friend's birthday. But the best dessert is the Squidgy Brownie with Vanilla icecream which I had on an earlier visit. Service is okay, ambience is good and takes pretty pictures.

A cosy little place situated at an advantageous location, 'My Big Fat Belly' is an amazing place to dine at. The BFB special chicken wings in ghost chilly sauce is an absolute delish! The Grilled Chicken Burger is a hit among the chicken lovers. The Ultimate Juicy Lucy(chicken) is delicious with a slight smoky taste. The onion rings served along with it are crispy and give a tough competition to the French Fries. A great place to hang out at.

If not a 'big fat belly', you surely do need a 'big fat appetite'...to counter their loaded repertoire...Which is a gateway to delectable comfort food...!!! Apart from the delightfully tasty dishes...the other factor which impressed me the most, was their portion size, which is literally mammoth in stature and you really need to be gutsy to take it down on your own. I would definitely recommend everyone to visit this place, as our impromptu visit... Literally made our "bellies dance" with joy and contend....!!! üòÅüòÅüòÅ

This is a very cozy place located in Sarat Bose Road.I went there with 3 of my friends.It is actually perfect for small groups because the place is quite small.The decor is very nice and the ambience is also good.We ordered for Grilled Chicken steak one with mushroom creme sauce another with BFB special sauce.Both were good but I preferred the mushroom sauce as the BFB sauce was a little spicy for my pallette.Also ordered for Grilled fish with lemon butter creme which tasted awesome.The quantity was actually more than enough.We also had thin crust veg pizza which equally tasted good.The food didn't take a long time to get served.The staffs are very friendly.Overall a very nice experience and will definitely visit again to try the other dishes.

This small food joint is ideally located at Sarat Bose Road, and its within walking distance from the Forum Mall. We took an uber from Rabindra Sadan and arrived here. Walking in, the first thing I noticed is that its not a big food joint and the seating arrangements are limited. So if you're a group of more than 4, you might have to sit separately. Nevertheless, after getting a seat, I started looking around and I noticed that the theme of this food joint is reminiscent of the 70's with old wall lamps and the ceiling is decorated using wooden doors. I loved the decor and that's one of the things that catches people's eyes. We ordered a large calypso pizza and two big fat belly juicy Lucy non veg burgers. Later on, we took a pitcher of Virgin mojito. Service was relatively fast and we got our pizza quite early on. But what we were waiting for was the infamous big fat belly burger which took its sweet time to reach us. Verdict: Its definitely worth the wait! The large pizza is enough to serve 4 people. It was delicious but a little bit spicy, which is manageable. But the burger, oh my god, it was mouthwatering. Even looking at it will make you fall in love with it. Finally, our pitcher of Virgin Mojito arrived. Its nothing like the Virgin mojito of KFC but its good nevertheless. A single pitcher can serve 6-7 people easily. So, overall, this place is a definite yes if you're a burger fanatic. I'm going to visit this place soon and try out their other burgers.

All good things come in small packages, it is said. True for this place. It has just five tables maybe, but the food served is amazing. We ordered the cheesy cigars, herb chicken, tomato and basil soup, cream of mushroom soup, Greek chicken salad, chicken on skewers and rice, paneer on skewers and rice. One of the best tasting meals. The mushroom soup is a must try, as are the cheesy cigars and skewers dishes. The price is also affordable and the ambience not bad. The service can be improved a bit to make it prompter. Definitely going back here to try other things from the menu!

Was looking forward to visit here since a very long time, and must say it was worth it.

We ordered Nachos, bellisma fries, 2 burgers, and 2 pastas. Each and every dish was extremely well prepared. It has an amazing ambience, friendly staff, and the best part is that, if the dish is wanted in a different way, we will get it. 
Amazing experience. Good going Adarsh.

This place was in my wishlist for quite a long time. With the rating so high it was tempting, so my friend and I paid a visit here.
The cool joint is located at Sarat Bose road, just opposite of Dugout.
Not a big place, but spacious enough to accommodate 15-18people at a time.
Interior is minimal and cool. Overall vibe is positive. Staff is good, well mannered and fast.
The menu offered by MBFB is vast. Many things to opt from.
Now finally coming to the food, in one word, it was delicious.
We had ordered Ginger Orange Mojito, Watermelon Mojito, BFB Special Chicken Wings in Ghost Sauce(spice level : "Phaadhu"), Chickenora Pizza, Blueberries Cheesecake and Choco Decadent Mousse Cake. Not a single dish made me wonder that it could have been better. As I have said earlier, the food was delicious.
I look forward to my second visit to MBFB and try out other items from the menu!
:)

A small and cosy place, easy to locate, won't really get the essence of this place unless you step in through its doors. Very unorthodox and interesting decorations. Friendly staff. And AMAZING food.

Went with two of my friends. We ordered cold coffee from the beverages, herb fried chicken from the starters, juicy Lucy burger, pasta arabiatta and finally a choco decadent mousse cake for the dessert.

The pasta arabiatta was a bit lacking in taste compared to the other dishes but overall, the food is of great quality and will leave you wanting for more.

We had ordered one pasta, one pizza (small) and one bacon wrapped prawn; all the items were tasteful and more than sufficient for 2 people. Alongside the food we had also ordered 2 drinks and they tasted pretty good. Overall, it's a nice and pocket friendly place to visit and I would recommend this place to my friends.

I have never tasted a burger that leaves you yearning for more! My friend and I had murgh e Azam and grilled chicken burger. Murgh e Azam is basically french bread with fillings. It also tasted heavenly. My search for those perfect burgers definitely ended here!

Visited this place recently. A beautiful cozy place with nice hospitality and serving up some exceptional food. Tried the Bellisma Fries, Dolce Vita Mushroom and the Grilled Chicken Steak. Each and every dish was simply amazing and mouth watering. The Tiramisu was nice too but felt it could have been slightly better as the ladyfingers could have been soaked in coffee liquor slightly more.

Good place to visit with friends.. I didn't find something wow to visit it more than once or twice. But if you are at bhawanipore this place can be a good place to have food. We ordered cheese cigars which was actually cheesy and good. The pizza was different with thin crust, sufficient for two and the burger we took, was delicious, cheesy and enough for two if you share. 
Pocket friendly and well decorated place. Staffs were equally well behaved and polite.

Ever since its inception, My Big Fat Belly has been the talk of the town. The name itself will give you a feeling of how good the foods gonna be. Indeed when you check out of this place, your belly will be full and also end up with a big happy smile in your face. I went along with a couple of friends and tried a few dishes. 

Mocktails: 

Watermelon Pitcher- its fruity and refreshing. If you like the flavour of watermelon, this will surely give you a delight. 

Ice Tea Kiwi Pitcher- i am in love with this drink. It definately has that "wow" factor. Its tangy, refreshing and is seriously flavourful. You wont be able to realize it unless you try this yourself.

Starters:

Cheesey Cigars- oh my god. This is sheer heaven. The oh-so goeyness from the cheese and the above philo pastry will send you to heaven. It comes with a mayo and strawberry chili sauce and trust me guys that chili strawberry sauce is seriously good. You can't ignore its flavours.

Peri peri chicken- these were just delicious. They were spicy and the chicken was so soft and juicy. Loved its flavour.

Pil pil Prawn- sounds quirky right but trust me guys it was ahmaazingüòç. How can you go wrong with prawns. They were juicy and had the perfecr balance of flavour. One of the best dishes i had.

Main course/Pizza:

Butter Chicken Risotto: this type of combination i had for the first time and i was like god this is so good. I was absolutely amazed how they beautifully balanced out the flavours of butter chicken with that of risotto. Hats off to them.

Al Fungi Pizza- one of the staff there recommended us to have this one. This turned out to be apt example of a perfect pizza. Its cheesy and packed with flavours.

Chickenora Pizza- its absolutely delicious. 

Bing Bong Burger- juicy mutton burger. Its beautiful and lovely. One of the best burger i had in town.

Meat ball Spaghetti- i actually licked off the place. It was that delicious. Spicy meatballs with the smooth spaghetti noodles is a foodies dream. Dont miss this one out guys.

Chicken Roast- the chicken was soft. The sauce along with it was just perfect.


Desserts-

Guys even if you are full, dont forget to try out their desserts or otherwise you will miss a major thing of your life. Desserts here are just fabulous. Each and every dessert that i tried was perfect and has their own strength and dignity. Desserts we tried were tiramisu, cheesecake, bailey's cake and mousse cake. Each has its own potentiality and doesnot overpower each other. You get the coffee flavour from the tiramisu, the smoothness and sophistication from the cheesecake, the subtle taste from the bailey's cake and the rich and gorgeous texture from the mousse cake. Desserts are a must try.

My Big Fat Belly has the potential of bringing a smile in your face. If you're still wondering whether you should visit or not, just give a visit. You will fall in love with this place again and again. I am going to drop here soon with my people.

Located on sarat bose road, the place inherently has a very cosmo vibe to it. We went for the burger challenge. Absolutely MONSTROUS burger with a huge serving of fries, a bowl of coleslaw and a tall glass of fresh lime soda. Certainly not for the faint hearted. Tastes absolutely brilliant. Hands down the best burger in Kolkata. Finish it in 20 minutes and the meal becomes free plus you get your picture up on the wall of fame and other goodies. Needless to say we couldn't finish it. The coleslaw and fries were too much to take really. The monster burger has 6 homemade pattys and it was easily more than 12 inches in height. Adarsh, the guy who runs the place, is a friendly chap. He seemed to have a lot of idea about how to make good burgers and pattys. It was really nice chatting with someone so passionate about what they do. A must visit to fix those burger cravings.

Go here if you love quality food and you are ready to pay a decent price for it. It is a small establishment which packs a great punch in its food and service. I have always cribbed after coming back from Delhi that Kolkata doesn't have a proper idea what a virgin mojito is or how a cheesecake should taste like. This restaurant¬†proved me wrong and I know where to head for good food and cozy ambiance next time I am in the splurging mood.

A nice cozy joint that serves real yummy american delights

Ambience : Plenty of young crowd. Nicely decorated. Always buzzing with people. Be prepared to wait in long queue. The place is not too big.

Staff: Has knowledge of what they are serving. Serving is fairly prompt.

Food: This is where it steals the show. Generous meat quantity and great quality. Properly cooked and loads of flavors. We had the kosha mangsho burger and the bacon bomb, our favorites. Their spicy chicken wings will leave you craving for more. The desserts are also good.
Note: They also have food challenges for the brave heart and big belly.

Overall: A must visit place for all the meat lovers out there but be prepared to wait in queues. And definitely not the most friendly place but the food will make up for it.

üçùFood: Well, coming to food, I tried a wide variety of their items, each one being really really good!!
üçüFor beverage, We ordered Watermelon pitcher and Kiwi pitcher. Both the mocktails were flavourful and really soothing.
For starters, we had ordered Cheese Cigars, Peri Peri Chicken and Pil Pil Prawns. All the 3 items were exceptionally good and were real treat to the taste buds!!
üçïFor Main Course, we proceeded with Butter Chicken Risotto, Al Fungi Pizza, Chickenora Pizza, Meatball Spaghetti and Roasted Chicken!! Really enjoyed each of them, my favorite pick being the Risotto!
üç∞Coming to Desert, I tried their Tiramisu, Mousse Cake, Bailey's Cake and Cheese Cake. I just loved their Mousse Cake, the others also being well upto the mark!

The big Fat belly is located nearly to the Pabrais Ice Cream at sarat bose road.

I was really amazed by their positive response on zomato so finally I came here for a lunch with some friends.

Place was cozy but beautiful, deco and ambiance was very good.

We had Kiwi Iced Tea and Watermelon mojito. Both were very refreshing and good. I literally ended up pitcher by myself.

Appetizers we had cheese cigars, peri peri chicken skewers and pil pil prawns. From presentation to taste entire thing was brilliant.

From the main course we had Al Funghi pizza, chickenara pizza (based on 4 types of chicken) and butter chicken risotto along with big bong burger and meat ballz spaghetti.
All were good but loved the risotto and al funghi pizza was excellent.

Desserts we had Mousse cake, blueberry cheesecake, tiramisu and baily's cake. Loved the mousse cake and tiramisu.

Everything was so damn perfect, that I had put my rating is 5/5. I wish I could rate more.

It's a nice little place located on the main road. I'd always wanted to try out this place because of its amazing burgers. And I wasn't disappointed when I had the Big Bong burger which is phenomenal! But keep in mind to have lots more of tissues papers since delicious food can get a little messy. I had the watermelon and kiwi mojito pitchers respectively. The kiwi gets my vote.
Then there were the cheese cigars, al fungi pizza, the chickenora pizza and the butter chicken risotto which are a definitely must try! Then for the dessert, you HAVE to have the Blueberry Cheesecake! Probably one of the best cheesecakes that I've ever tasted. Must visit place!

Visited here on last monday.  Such a lovely decoration with full of unique frame hanging on wall,  bulbs and ceiling pattern.  The ceiling pattern have done by full of vintage wooden doors and windows. 
Service is good and staff's are very polite and you don't need to wait for your food for a long a time.

We have ordered two brownie shakes,  one chicken skewers,  one herb fried chicken.  Trust me each and every dishes they are made excellent. 

P. S -  The name "MY BIG FAT BELLY"  is totally justified and means for this place.  
Love to visit here again and have to try there giant burgers.

We have picked food from here on multiple occasions and was never really disappointed.

The interiors are not very spacious but is done very smartly as it looks inviting with its contemporary and modern feel.

The outside of the restaurant is equally attractive especially at night as they have displayed the name of the outlet in an attractive array of lights.

Another USP of their place is that are open way past midnight.

We ordered the below items and my observations follow:

Grilled Regular Chicken Steak-It tasted good and came with sauteed vegetables.It was priced at INR 279.

Herb Rice-It tasted decent and was priced at INR 69.

The Big Bong Burger-This was definitely the show stopper as it was fusion redefined in terms of having pulled Kosha Mangsho in a burger.It was very filling and more than enough for a single person.They also gave Coleslaw and French fries along with it.It was priced at INR 299.

Now for the part which I liked and appreciated the most-PACKAGING.

I happen to mostly order food home or take away and one can judge a lot about a restaurant by the way they pack the food.Unfortunately,most outlets don't really care much but this place was AMAZING.The quality of the packaging is faboulous and awesome.

The menu looks very promising and i would love to try out more items in the future.

Tried the quinoa salad and the mushroom risotto. Was surprisingly delicious even though I had it packed for a takeaway. Some items on the menu are a fresh pack whilst the rest were the regular offerings (like the agarwalji burger lol) so the menu was a mixed bag in that sense. The first experience was a pleasant one though so looking forward to trying it again.

Absolutely amazing mouth watering food... Beyond yumminess....top end culinary talent... We ordered cheesy fries, agarwalji burger, and pizza everything was just as amazing as it sounds... And no matter how much i say and describe about the food its just not enuf.. Uv got to visit this place if ur in Kolkata... On the main streets of landsdowne bhawanipur, thers this small and coz place which serves food descended from heaven...the dish of the day tho was the agarwalji burger... This is not any regular hometown burger, now i am a big fan of burgers and generally don't miss a burger at any good place where ever i travel... But this was just class apart... Perfectly cooked aloo and bean patty crispy outside and yummy inside... Balanced texture and gooieness of the stuffing... The fresh veggies and the sauce... Crafted to perfection... And if that wasn't enough the chef personally came and made sure we were licking our fingers.. A definite revisit wen i go to Kolkata again... Keep up the good work guys.. Looking forward to seeing u again... Adios

P. S : mojito was a turn off

The place is right in the corner¬†of a crossing, from the outside seemed a normal cafe type place but was amazed to see such a nice treat in there. lovely place nice interiors service is good . Had a Annie Aunties Pasta with an oreo shake which was fair enough to get you through after a long day at office above all pocket friendly.

Hardly matters, if you are in Diet or not, but if you come here, definitely you will return to your home with ‚ÄòA big Fat Belly‚Äô. Yes, if you are a proper American or Italian Cheesy food fan then this food joint should be your one stop destination.

Location - Located at Sarat Bose Road, near to Elgin Road, opposite of The Dugout, Padmapukur. Nearest metro station is Netaji Bhavan. So not a hard thing to find it out.

Decoration & Ambiance - Now come to the decoration part. The retro decoration of the whole restaurant will surely catch your eyes. Wooden doors and windows at the celling add the artistic touch in your mood. Overall a big thump‚Äôs up for the decoration and ambainace.

Now let‚Äôs come to the food. But before starting the food part, first want to thanks Mr. Shabaaz Zaman for inviting us and also want to thanks

This is the best example of what you call a budget eatery with incredible quality of food. The small space totally makes up for the food. The variety and the quantity is both satisfying. For bacon lovers like me, you got a lot to choose from.
Do try the Bacon Bomb and the overly famous Big bang Burger!!

Though I'd suggest Zomato to update the menu. Cheers!

Finally got to visit this much hyped place. Easy to locate, just opposite to Dugout. We ordered juicy lucy burgers. Starting from the lamb patty to the onion rings garnished on the top, everything was perfect. The burger was huge, filling, tasty and absolutely worth the price. The ambience was great as well. Will visit soon to try their pizzas.

Visited with a friend on Shashti afternoon.Ordered a large Pizza(The American) and some Chicken Wings.The Pizza tasted pretty good to be honest...however despite ordering the Large aka My Big Fat Belly size, the slices were RIDICULOUSLY thin.Taste WAS good however.The Wings were pretty good as well.Prices were slightly high.Overall its okay.If you could make the pizza slices...ahem a bit..."fatter"...then it'd be a 5.At least from me.

This place has been into much fame more recently among the foodies. After receiving so many good reviews from my friends finally decided to give it a shot!
Went there on Shasthi afternoon to catch up with two of my dearest friend. There are quite a few important landmark on this road but the nearest and known to most is St John Diocesan school.
This eatery is a small cozy cafe, with okayish american bar style decor.
May be we went there during durga puja time and it was quite a rush hour so service was relatively slow. But thats fine, the food compensated for all.We ordered - 2 Big Bong Burgers, 1Juicy Lucy Burger with bacon and lamb, 1Peach flavoured Iced - Tea, 1 Virgin Mojito Pitcher, 1Tiramisu, 1Blue Berry cheese Cake. Will have to admit that this place a real gem when it come to burgers, their speciality. Am not a burger fan, yet it managed to win my heart! Regarding cheese cake, I will say that despite my blind love for cheese cakes, this one was a disaster. It seemed like they just spread simple Amul cheese cubes over a slice of cake but Tiramisu tasted really good. Pocket pinch is usually on the higher side.

- with Ayshee Bhaduri.

Live Review : While Zomato-ING for lunch around Minto park amidst the hustle and bustle of Durga puja,I came across this restaurant which sounded like  a typical American diner/Cafe. The restaurant is on the smaller side in terms of the floor area. However the seating arrangement is quite intelligent with a few high chairs.

Food : We ordered : 

gooey cheese sticks (Cheese Cigar) which are apt, quite gooey and moderately deep fried.

Bacon wrapped prawns : one of the best bacon wrapped prawns I have had.

Big bong burger : it has the kosha mangsho touch to it! Never did I imagine the two word coming together in such a beautiful way. If you ignore the oiliness and the frozen French fries, it's a must try!

Grilled fish with gandhoraj : Well cooked fish with tons of veggies and the ofcourse gandhoraj lemon! One fine dish.

Drinks :
Choclate Oreo shake and Lemon Ice Tea. Both were were rightly prepared.

Ambience is quite nice and cozy. The interior is decorated with tons of DIY ideas which is always soothing.

It's quite pocket friendly too.

Overall it's a good place to come and chill with friends.

We ordered cheese cigars which we too good with the dip. Next was Agarwal's burger and chicken juicy burger. Both were finger licking good. The French fries were crisp and hot just like I love. Was a very good experience and love to go back again

Had heard a lot about this place and finally decided to give it a try on Panchami of Durga Puja. BFB sits quietly at a crossing in Chakraberia, waiting to amaze anyone who enters the place with the awesome ambiance and mouthwatering food. The entire place is covered with wooden window panes, multiple types of windows all across the walls and ceiling -- a very different look for sure. After waiting for about 10 mins (which we didn't mind as it's Puja time in Kolkata after all) my wife and I got a table near the entry door. We had ordered a Green Apple Ice Tea, Bacon Bomb, and Fish-n-chips. Everything was fantastic and I will give extra points to the Ice Tea for sure. We also had a great chat with the owner of the place -a very warm guy indeed. Overall it was a great experience and would love to visit again. Hope this place makes it really big. Cheers!!

It is situated near Bhowanipur, a few mins walk from forum mall. They offer intense variety of food with appropriate prices. When we entered we were seated at the side tables that are high up as the restaurant was completely filled.It was peak hour .We ordered chicken sausage Casanova and fried chicken breasts. The chicken sausage Casanova was cut into two pieces and served along with french fries. It was heavenly in taste, full of cheese and stuffed with beautifully cooked salami pieces. The chicken fried breasts were total 6pieces along with french fries and mayonnaise sauce with salads dipped in it. It was cooked in exotic spices and tastes wonderful. The service is good, ambiance is also fine. The only problem is that the menu available in Zomato is not in accordance to the menu served.

One of the best continental start up restaurants trying to do something different! The word "hatke" applies aptly to this. We ordered bruschetta, walk from Chowringhee, herb chicken. Bruschetta just stood out amidst all... Rich aroma of basil, tangy sauces and juicy chunks of chicken.... Altogether bruschetta was the right choice for us. Walk from Chowringhee sandwich failed to impress us...herb chicken was there to balance it out... Sauteed veggies are an addition! Loved the pub-stylo sitting arrangements...a cozy, uptown restro which doesn't pinch Ur pocket! Good going guysüëç

We went there yesterday.. it's a quaint place with a very contemporary feel about it and is always packed with young adults feasting and chatting. 
We had heard about the chicken wings and so we ordered 8 pieces of Regular spicy Chicken wings..but we were kind of disappointed because the chicken content was not enough at all. But the sauce was really good.We ordered fresh lime sodas and a lemon iced tea which were really refreshing.
Then we ordered a Grilled Chicken burger, a Chicken Mac an' Cheese and a Grilled Chicken Steak along with Mashed potatoes. Lastly we finished with a platter of nachos and bacon strips. All of them had been fantastically executed, both in terms of presentation and taste.
Overall it was a wonderful experience and the price was decent as well. Hoping to visit again . :)

Ok so no doubt this is a great place to get a good burger but my visit was focused more on there other foods like fries there chicken wings drinks salad they provide.

1 their fries, with cheese sauce was dry...the cheese sauce was thik sticky ...cheese sauce to me is creamy not dry.

2 their wings, the sauce they use its a little strange I never tasted like this ever in resturent...it was like home made gravy of kosha mangsho...that taste ...i don't know maybe some people dig it...i didn't.

3 their salad ,there salad was really good i really enjoyed that the becon there pulled sausage it was really good ..not the best but good.


In the end there a very good place for boutique burger not good for other stuff..
Only if they upgrade there sauce game it will be a home run cheers

This one was on my foodie target list for a long time and for all the right reasons. Finally I got to visit this place today. Though I didn't get to eat the legendary burgers I ordered Al Pacino Bellerizza (aka chicken olive pizza), lime soda and chicken nuggets. All of them were cooked √° point. The service is brilliant, quick and waiters are always at their best behaviour. The ambiance is that of an American cafe. T@he decor is unique and a little quirky. It is best place to hang out in group of four, more than that and you might have to split to sit. It would be so great if they had a better and larger sitting arrangements. The only con is the location. Too far than the main road and tucked in a corner, but it's worth a long walk. I am looking forward to visit again, soon. the

Quite a small place so call and check if tables are available before going. I strongly recommend everyone who comes here to try their Gooey Cheese Cigars as they were a treat on which wars can be fought. The chicken wings were a disappointment as the wings had chicken skin on them which were undercooked and chewy but the spice factor was a plus. The Mac n cheese was bland and lacked a certain oomph to it. Ice tea and lemonade were okay.
Overall the experience was great and someday I would love to try their wings challenge.

Bun,lettuce,ketchup,cheese and that heart warming patty.

That's *BURGER* for you.

We all need to make time for a burger once in while and if you're a calcuttan, I've found the perfect address for you to comfort your burger belly.

Situated in Elgin Road, *My Big Fat Belly* is popularly known for it's Burgers,traditionally made but a twist added to the flavours.

‚Ä¢DECOR¬Æ

The best part about this place is it's decor and lighting.The installation of Filament bulbs inside the carved iron holders gives this place a traditional touch but at the same time depicts the progressive process of the modern food scenario.

The place is extremely picturesque as it creates a natural warm effect.The celing is phenomenally crafted with ancient wooden doors and windows with flaps,which itself act's as a light absorbent creating an artistic shadow.

The photoframes too add that element of humour to your food journey(PUGTATO).

‚Ä¢FOOD¬Æ

Now coming to the food scenario,The Big Bong burger is the one to kick start your meal with and to perfectly carry on the legacy of flavours, there's this "KOSHA MANGSHO BURGER"(Recommended).It is one such Burger which takes the food scene¬†of this place to a whole new level.Authentic burger with classic bengal twist(kosha mangsho) makes this burger lip smacking and will make you long for more.

"Bacon Bomb" on the other hand is all about the flow of various flavours into your tastebuds.

"Grilled Fish in Gondhoraj" tastes fresh and superior.Superiority of flavours comes from the fish itself and not from the overflow of spices.¬†

The melt in mouth "Cheese Cigars" and the buttery "Fish Fingers" are the perfect companion for your tummy alongwith the giants of the game "Burger" and "Pizza".

"Green Apple Ice Tea" and "Water Melon Mojito" are refreshing and applies that characteristic cooling sensation to your food journey.

‚Ä¢Desserts

Chocolate Decadent mousse and Blueberry cheesecake are the hot favourites but¬† Tamarind mousse is what tasted more original and out of the box.

Thus if you're looking forward to offer a decadent treat to your tastebuds with the twist of tastes to some authentic recipes and rejuvenate your tastebuds,MY BIG FAT BELLY is the right place for you.

The Food is mouth watering. So much to choose from. Some of the items are quite unique. Its great "value for money" as its quite cheap as well. I have also noticed that the guys who own it makes sure that they meet and greet every diner. I guess that makes the service even more efficient and personal. Will go again and again and totally recommed it.

'My Big Fat Belly' is one of the best cafes in South Kolkata. We went here yesterday at 7.30 pm.

The decor inside is amazing and the ambience is soothing. After a photosession of the restaurant we were served with the delicious 'Watermelon mohito' and the yummy 'Gooey Cheese Cigars'. I have never tasted so much cheese at one go . I was impressed by the quality of the cheese cigars.

Next, we were served the delcatble,fish -filled, neatky zero batter 'fish fingers'. The fish fingers were delicious to the core.

Up next we were served with 'Green Apple Ice Tea '. I personally liked this drink better. Then we were served with the cheese sauce topped 'bellisma french fries'. It was delectable.

After this came the Pizzas. The 'al fungi pizza' and 'the chickenora' pizza were delicious. The crust was thin,crispy and delicious. There was no dearth of toppings on these delicious pizzas.

Up next,came the 'Chicken Juicy Lucy ' and 'Big Bong' or 'Kosha Mangsho' burgers. The burgers had along with their juicy,delicious patties one sunny side egg each. They were served with coleslaw and french fires . The burger affair was a messy one but a delicious one. However, the 'Big Bong' or 'Kosha Mangsho Burger' is the best burger that I have ever tasted.

Next came the chicken rissotto which was delicious as well. Then came the 'Grilled Fish in Gandhoraj Lemon in white sauce' which was delectable and the 'Bacon Bomb' . It was the best item that I have ever had. The bacon was tasty and the sunny side added to the taste.

Finally the desserts came. Each one of the desserts that is, the tiramisu ,the decadent mousse cake and the blueberry cheese cake was delicious.

The staff was cordial and well-behaved. We will definitely go here again.

Absolutely loved the place! Though it's pretty small, didn't feel very cramped up. The mixed fruit mojito is refreshing and yummy. The mixed sauce pasta is the best I have ever tried! The agwarwalji burger, is quite a fusion, as the name has it, with marwaris all time favorite haldiram Bhujia and chutney. The nachos was pretty average. 
All in all, delicious food, amazing presentation, decently priced.

Let me warn you right away. If you are on a diet or planning to go on one soon, you should stay far far away from My Big Fat Belly, a new restaurant that has garnered¬†some rave reviews. However, if you care more about a juicy burger or a cheesy pizza than the size of your belly, you must visit this restaurant because the food here is insanely good. We had our Kolkata Food Fanatics meet there last month and I was mighty impressed by what I ate.
                                                                ...

My Big Fat Belly is definitely on my list of favourite places now.
The Location : Located in Bhawanipur, this place is pretty easily accessible and easy to find.
The Ambience : The place is not very big. At a time, it can accommodate 25 people. But the ambience is good. The waiters serving us seemed to be nice and polite too.
The food : Their Burgers are amazing. No doubt about that.
We also ordered Gooey Cheesy cigars and Sausages in chef's Signature sauce. Both were spot on. 
The Pizza,  "Al Pachino" was great.  This place had its  own thin crust,  which was so unlike the latex like crust that domino's pizza has become synonymous with.  
We ordered Brownie shake and Peach flavored Ice tea.  I absolutely loved both of these drinks.  
The Pocket Pinch : This place is a bit expensive.  But,  I think that's okay because the food was very impressive. 
Recommendation : Absolutely .  Go there and try out their Burger Challenge.  And If you win,  you have a wall of fame to your name! :D

My Big Fat Belly - A decent experience.
=====
Location & Intro:

It is located right opposite Dugout where little donkey was located previously.¬†

It was my first visit to MBFB. I had been hearing a lot about it from food connoisseurs and food enthusiasts and that's when it got me excited to visit this place. But sorry to say, my expectations were quite high from this place.¬†
=====
What i tried here: 

‚Ä¢ Chicken Wings - The wings were good but it surely could have been much more succulent. The flavours were nice.¬†

‚Ä¢ Big Fat Belly Chicken Burger - The burger was presented well with french fries, onion rings and also egg was added inside the burger. ¬†Taste wise, it was not the best burger i have had in kolkata. However, It was good to taste.¬†

‚Ä¢ Tiramisu - It was just fine. I have had better tiramisu. What i did not like about their tiramisu was that it was not so soft as it should be. ¬†
=====
Pros:

‚Ä¢ Good food presentation and taste.

‚Ä¢ Good ambiance.

‚Ä¢ Good menu variety to choose from.

Cons:

‚Ä¢ Prices are slightly inclined high.¬†
‚Ä¢ The staffs should be more hospitable. It is not just about come, eat and go. It is also about the experience to revere. ¬†
=====
Meal for two: 500-1000 approximate (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc.)¬†
=====
Summary: 

Quality 3.5/5

Taste 3.7/5

Quantity 3.7/5

Presentation 3.8/5

Hospitality 3.6/5

Ambiance 3.6/5
=====
Conclusion:
I had a decent experience here.¬†

The ambience is good. But the should highlight the name of the restaurant outside. 
The service is very quick. 

We had Watermelon Mojito, Green Apple Ice Tea,Big Bong Burger, Chicken Wings, Mushroom Risotto with Chicken Tikka, Brownie Shake, and Mousse Decadent Cake.  
Mocktails are very refreshing.
Chicken Wings are soft and juicy, the dip  and the sauce is good in taste. Burger was very good. Risotto is OK, I don't like it much. Brownie Shake and Mousse Cake are wonderful.

The food is good here. I had belly fries with bacon slices. It was cheesy and healing. But this place is over crowded and seating area is not that spacious. The services are very much delayed.

Been here just once so the review might change later.
The place is a cosy cafe, the kind I like to visit often. Menu is pretty good and the preparation takes a while but the end product - Your food, is actually worth the wait.
Burgers, Pasta, shakes... Had them all, loved them all.
Hope to give a detailed review when I visit the place again, soon.

2nd time. Friday night. Ordered the Mushroom veg burger and it was a killer item. My friend ordered chicken steak and he was happy and so full. We also got the chocolate moose and it was delicious.
So, the rating remains same, high.
PS-As there were no customers, wait time was just 10mins

I would have given a 4.0 rating but they said they didn't have any hot coffee. I don't know how. How can you be out of coffee in a cafe!? Not even Nescafe? Seriously? Not cool!
It's a small cafe just opposite to the dugout. We ordered a lemon iced tea, herbal tea, bacon wrapped prawns and Big bong burger. The herbal tea and iced tea were normal, nothing to write home about. The prawns and burgers were pretty good and satisfying.
But, I didn't get coffee....

Sort of my go-to place when I'm unhappy or for a quick dinner out. The chicken Steak, Grilled fish in lemon butter sauce, and the chicken skewers in Makhni Gravy are sort of becoming the ¬†standard orders, not to mention the cheesy loaf with pepperoni, or the Cubano, which felt like it was meant for me. Good food, great portions, and a menu I can gladly direct carnivores and herbivores alike.

So my much awaited visit to My big fat belly was finally fulfilled. We visited there one fine afternoon. It's placed just opposite to the dugout. The place was packed with people when we reached. Though the place is small the seating arrangement was quite nice. There was this lady who was managing the place. She nicely asked us to wait for a couple of minutes till one of the seats got empty. Such nice gestures naturally lift up your mood. The ambience of the place is also very pleasing. Not very sophisticated but nice. And they had some good music playing which was another plus. 

So for food we ordered Pork sausages, Chicken juicy lucy burger and an oreo shake.
The oreo shake was pretty normal. 
The sausages were nicely cooked and the quantity was good. The sauce in it tasted amazing. 
Now comes the famous juicy lucy burger. It sure lived up to its name as it was delicious. It came with some onion rings, a side of french fries and coleslaw. 

Though the prices of the dishes are a bit high but the quality of the food made up for it. We were not really hungry so could not order much. But I'll make sure I try the other stuff on their menu soon enough. Keep up the good work. :)

We got good review regarding this place from zomato, hence we tried to explore this place. This seemed like a small and quaint place from the photographs posted in zomato. We went there and we found that there were only 3 tables available so we occupied the only comfortable table available. We were a group of 3. In some time few girls arrived and we were asked to shift to another table. Though initially we refused, we shifted to the next table later on. That table was meant for 2 people, yet we somehow managed. We asked for another extra chair to keep our belongings. After sometime when that group was joined by few more of their friends, we were first asked to shift to another table to which we refused and then asked to vacate the extra chair. After sometime, we were again asked to shift to another table and at that time we decided to leave. We had ordered for two items, and we asked them to cancel the second one. There are no complains against the staffs working there, but the lady who seems to be the owner was pretty rude. Hence, my experience is quite dissatisfactory with My big fat belly.

After a disappointing experience in one of the so called best burger places in Kolkata, we headed to MBFB. Thanks to Zomato reviews and their apparent popularity in the peer group, we had huge expectation from this place. It is a small cozy nicely furnished cafe. 

But the food was barely acceptable. We tried the most popular things there.
1. Cheese cigars- tasted good- but was not of feta cheese- which is supposed to be the filling.
2. Chicken wings- hot alright, but instead of tasting like chicken wings- it tasted like Chicken Kassa with too much of chilli pepper.
3. Juicy Lucy burger- the most disappointing encounter with any burger I ever had. It was looking like a bada pao. Not at all juicy. Patty was bad. Onion rings served were swimming in pools of oil. Cant begin to say what was wrong with it.

Want to rate 1. But service is good and place is nice. I really hope management takes care of the food and delivers what they really promise.

The ambience was pretty good.. The hostess was certainly a cheerful lady who suggested us some of the good dishes there.. The bellisma fry was lovely... The big bong burger was tasty especially the onion rings.. The BFB chicken platter did not do justice, though.. The sausage in it was hard... Had to waste a greater part of the dish... The mousse cake was, however, very good...

Went there for a second time and this time I'm convinced that these people can maintain quality. The juicy Lucy is a must try, the filling in the bacon bomb could have been better and the Keema Ghotala Pizza is a must try. Definitely one of the best burger joints in the city. That being said it has a lot more to offer. Try the tiramisu too!

My Big Fat Belly is one of the american restaurant which I had been planning to visit since a long time. And finally I visited this place with my friends a few days back.¬†

And It was a weekday evening and we got a table. The interiors looks beautiful. The seating arrangement and the walls look amazing.

We started with Watermelon Mojito Pitcher, which was totally cool and refreshing. And Peach Ice Tea Pitcher, I completely fell in love with. <3

The starters arrived next. Goee Cheese Cigar, Wings Chicken, Herb Fried Chicken was excellent. I couldn't believe the taste of Goee cheese cigar and herb fried chicken dish left in my tongue. This is something you should try at this place.

Then Pizza like Alfungi, Alpachino and American regular pizza. Their pizza was thin crust yet had the consistency, which I loved. This was unlike most other places where thin crust pizzas crumble. The cheese and the toppings had their own magic, giving a beautiful flavour to the pizza.

And their come Big bong(Mutton) burger and Chicken juicy luicy burger, which was absolutely amazing and tasty mainly chicken juicy one.

I was too full to Mac & Cheese Chipotte Prawn, Butter chicken risoto and Keema aglio dio which came next. I somehow managed to eat and it was tasted superb good and heaven.¬†

Finally ending our meal, for desserts we had Blueberry Cheese Cake, Tiramishu and Decandent Mouse Cake. I personally love the blueberry chesse cake and mouse cake more.

Overall, my big fat belly is a good american foods. You just can't stop visiting this place once you give it a visit. ¬†The service and hospitality were of top notch. The food exceed all my expectations. I'm looking forward to come back again. :)

What does one go to a restaurant for? Ambience? Check. Service? Check. Food? Um... check?

Yes, the question mark looms large over the experience and mostly because of the stellar ratings and raving reviews on Zomato. Perhaps, all publicity is not good publicity. The Big Fat Belly is a new entrant in the buzzing Kolkata cafe scene (at least new by my standards as I visit my lovely old city only once in a few long months). It has quickly shot up the charts and some of the dishes have been repeatedly given a nod in the reviews. I tried some of them- and well, I really didn't get what all the hoopla was about.

To start off, I had the chicken wings in a fiery sauce (same as served in the BFB challenge). Not as spicy as you'd imagine, but I figure they make it spicier for the challenge. The wings were soft and succulent but the sauce didn't have any signature flavor- like, it was a generic vinegary spicy red sauce.

After that, I ordered a Juicy Lucy burger which disappointed thoroughly. For one, it wasn't nearly as juicy as you'd think- the fried egg should have been runny instead of the hard fried, well-set yolk. The onion relish wasn't tasty and the burger patty lacked seasoning. It was just a slice of cheese sandwiched within the ground chicken patty- that's all. The quantity of fried served with the burger was good.

Finally, the grilled chicken steak. The mashed potato was creamy and smooth- a thumbs up for that. The red wine sauce paired well with the chicken and sauteed veggies. But the star of the dish, the chicken breast, was a bit tough for my liking. If it were slightly flattened and cooked for a minute less, it would have been perfect.

Overall, an average lunch. Might try some other items next time.

Another awesome place in bhowanipore.  Superb pizzas.  Close to my house is a big advantage as they don't have any parking arrangements - I walk down. Small place but super efficient.  Very high quality standards.  Pizza is probably the best in town.  Super stuff.

The restaurant has a great ambience and a lovely host...
The bong burger was good especially the onion rings, the mutton inside was juicy and well cooked, the flavor was mesmerising ...
The bellisma fry was also a unique dish, the cheese was enough to take hearts away...
However, the BFB chicken platter was not that satisfactory...The sausage was not well cooked..
The mousse cake was delicious...

Finally visited the place after waiting since long time. Located just opposite to the Dugout. A small outlet  with tons of drooling stuffs. Ambience was great and so was the service. 

Now come to the food we had.. 
They serve the best Ice Teas I have ever tried. Ordered Watermelon Mojito Pitcher and Peach Ice Tea Pitcher(recommended). 4.5 out of 5 for the beverages. 
In starters we ordered Gooe Cheese Cigar,  wings chicken, Herb Fried chicken. Cheese Cigar was awesome with crispy layer outside and melting cheese inside. 
After that we ordered Alfunghi  Pizza and, Alpachino  Pizza. Pizzas were price worthy with thin layer of crust and lots of cheese and toppings. 

I must say they have the best Burgers in the town. Ordered Chicken Juicy Luicy and Bing Bong Burger(recommended). 5/5 for their burgers. 
At last but not the least the desserts. Ordered Tiramisu, Decadent Mouse Cake and Blue Barry cheese cake. All of them were fantastic.

My Big Fat Belly has always been on my wishlist, and finally I visited it! 

The place looks cosy and comfy with dim lighting, and has a very peppy playlist. The USP of this place is obviously the lip smacking food. So we gorged on a number of items ranging from burgers to pastas to risottos. Let's begin.

We started our meal with thirst quenchers. These were the Watermelon Mint Mojito Pitcher, and Green Apple Iced Tea. Both tasted amazing, yet being an iced tea lover, I'd choose the latter!

Next up were the starters. Gooey Cheese Cigars were a delight to my taste buds, with cheese oozing out with every bite. The Chicken Wings came next. They were spicy and flavourful. The third item was the Crumb Fried Chicken served with French fries. All the starters tasted brilliant. 

Coming to the main course. We started with an array of brilliant pizzas. First up was the Al Funghi which had a topping of button mushrooms and shitake mushrooms. Then came my favourite, The American Pizza which had a generous topping of pepperoni which tasted out of this world. Al Pachino which had a topping of shredded chicken tasted good too.

Next we had Keema Aglio Olio pasta which tasted heavenly. The show stopper of the evening however, was the Prawn Mac and Cheese. If you want to fall in love, this dish is a must! We also had the Butter Chicken Risotto, which had a mild flavour and was topped with spicy onions. This too tasted amazing!

The must haves at My BFB are definitely the burgers! The Big Bong Burger is a stunner with a stuffing of kosha mangsho. On the other hand, the Juicy Lucy, as the name denotes has a juicy patty along with a fried egg.

Next up were the desserts. The Tiramisu was one stunning dessert with the perfect texture and taste. The Decadent Mousse Cake was equally brilliant. But the best by far was the Blueberry Cheesecake, which won me other with its creamy texture and amazing taste. 

So as you can see I had a amazing time at My BFB and I'll be back again for sure!

The restaurant is quite cute and comfy. With both high and low seats. The service is top notch. The lighting conditions of the place is quite dim, which is however the case of most of the restaurants these days. 

Now coming to the main part, the food. We ordered quite a few items. 

1. Watermelon mojito pitcher - Tangy and refreshing 
2. Peach ice tea pitcher - You can feel the aroma freshly brewed tea
3. Alfungi regular pizza - A stunner
4. American regular pizza - Average 
5. Chicken juicy burger - The burger comes with onion rings, egg and succulent patty and is a MUST try
6. Mac and Cheese chipotle prawn - Never before did i taste such a combination. It blew my mind away
7. Butter chicken risotto - Yummy. A great alternative for people looking for north indian cuisine in this cafe
8. Tiramisu - perfect blend of all the layers
9. Blueberry cheesecake 
10. Decadent mousse cake - The sweetness was just the right amount. Loved it.

Overall, this place is worth revisiting over and over again. The pocket pinch is also on the moderate side.     To cut it short, youll have a happy tummy and a happier pocket in the end.

Next in line was the American pepperoni pizza, Classic Mac n cheese. Finally their burgers....the juicy Lucy burger and the big bong burger (my favourite) which had the yummiest n juiciest kosha mangsho filling in between. Ended our happy meal with the choco decadent mousse cake and strawberry cheesecake. And we are done! Phew! I wont say a word. Just one advice. Go and grab their food. It's damn good.

BFB chicken wings: they were good but not exceptionally tasty
BFB Chicken Shawarma. The lightness of the wrap and crispness of the filling was impressive.
Squidgy brownie with ice cream. The brownie portion should be more. It felt like a miserly amount compared to the price they charged.
Overall, not bad if you intend to have lots of money spent.

My Big Fat Belly was in my wishlist for a long time and I finally managed a visit. Well, this time I was with a group of friends and I tried a number of dishes, which mostly include their specialities.

The Watermelon Mojito and Green Apple Iced Tea were very refreshing. The Mojito was tangy and had a beautiful of watermelon. The iced tea was one of the best I ever had.

Among starters, the Goeey Cheese Cigars were crispy and extremely cheesy. The dips - flavoured mayo and strawberry chilli sauce, complemented the cigars well. The Chicken Wings were very spicy, though the chicken was soft. The Herb Fried Chicken had a crisp covering followed by a delicate thick layer of chicken. It was served with fries.

The fell in love with the pizzas which came next. Being a non vegetarian, what impressed me the most was the Al Funghi Pizza, loaded with button mushrooms, shitake mushrooms and cheese. It was full of flavour. The other pizzas which I tried were The American, which was topped with pepperoni and Al Pachino, which was spicy and topped with chicken slices. The pizzas are a must try over here.

The risotto and pastas tasted amazing. The Butter Chicken Risotto was a sheer delight. I'm not a fan of risottos but this didn't fail to impress me. The risotto had chicken slices cooked in a mild flavoured creamy sauce and topped with spiced onions. The Mac and Cheese with prawns was an absolute delight. The cheese sauce tasted out of the out of the world. The Keema Aglio Olio had spaghetti with minced mutton. It was spicy and tasted great.

Coming to the burgers, The Big Bong Burger, with pulled mutton and fried egg was heavenly. It was irresistible. I can't think of any burger that can even come close to this ! The Juicy Lucy Chicken Burger tasted good as well, with a chicken patty, cheese and fried egg.

The desserts stole the show. The Tiramisu had an amazing texture, with a beautiful balance of sweetness and caffeine. The Choco Decadent Mousse Cake was made with rum and dark chocolate, and was drizzled with chocolate sauce. This was the best among the desserts. If you love chocolate, you must go for this. The Blueberry Cheesecake was wonderful. The sweetness, the texture and the flavours were perfectly balanced.

Overall, this place is a must visit for every foodie in the city. The burgers, pizzas, pastas and the desserts are amazing. I actually fell in love with this place and will be back here very soon !

XD...and the wall posters, the decorations...all were innovative and funny....spend the day with a nice bunch of friends....we had ordered mixed fruit mojito, watermelon mojito, spicy chicken (try the faadu sauce...it's really hot...but could have been hotter!!)...then we had chickenora pizza and chocolate mousse (which I must discourage you from having)...but one of the cons of that place is that it is too small and cramped.....it has seating arrangements for only around 30 people... overall the place got a good vibe to it!!

This is a small but very deftly decorated restaurant. The whole arrangement gives you a casual and welcoming feel. The orders were taken right away and serving time was around 10mins. We ordered for an Al Pacino pizza , juicy Lucy burger, the bong burger a cottage cheese burger, and a mixed fruit mojito pitcher. I would definitely recommend the pizza. It was thin crust,spicy and filled with chicken. Among the burgers(which we shared) I loved the bong burger . The buns are filled with kosha mangsho! 
It was yummy. And finally the mojito didn't disappoint at all. It was the right amount of tangy and sweet.

In their crust I trust‚ùó
This place was bookmarked since long in my #edible_story.
Finally we could make it this week.

Where: Bhawanipur, just opposite to Dugout. Easy to locate.

What: Excellent service with good food. We tried almost everything on earth and was tummypacked!
#Goey cheese cigar was the first thing that I had n it just melted in my mouth. Full of cheese and not at all spicy.
#Herb fried chicken accompanied with french fries n mayo made me happy. Crispy n fresh it came!
#Drinks like peach ice tea n watermelon mojito made the occasion more refreshing.
The pitchers were beauty to look at!! Do check that in my pictures.
Peach ice tea was more likeable.
#American pizza resulted into fine tossed crust with those amazing pork meats . Amazing that was!
# Al pacino pizza tastes superb(and why not when mushrooms are there) and be loved by the vegetarians.
#Well my most favourite among all was Mac n cheese.
Perfectly baked with cheese n shredded prawns this dish is here to tinker your tastebuds for sure.üòç
Wish the bowl had infinite amount of it!

#Burger alert‚ùó
An excellent hub for burger lovers this is. One can gorge on king size mutton plus chicken burgers and participate in a burger contest too. Isn't that interesting?

Finest desserts are available here namely #blueberry cheese cake, Tiramisu, Decadent mousse cake.
I can visit this place again and again for their mousse
cake. Soft creamy rich n frothy!‚ù§
Highly recommended üëç

I had gone a few days back to this place with a couple of my friends and the food here was amazing.The ambience was great.We ordered Bellisma fries and Grilled Chicken Burgers.The fries were amazing too. Very delicious and too crispy and the mayo put on the fries added blast to the taste. The burger too was juicy and the patty very tender.The things which I didn't like about this place was the serving time and the accommodation space.

Located at Sarat Bose Road, opposite to Dugout,this place is pretty visible... coming to the food and ambiance,this is what Calcutta Cravings has to share:
Ambiance- there's an element of surprise as one enters this place..though it isn't that generous in size(max 20-25 people can fit in),the look and the decor definitely gives a comfy vibe.¬†
Staff and Services- super courteous staff.. they really know how to work between the tables effortlessly. They will guide you through the menu if you find yourself unable to decide what to order from the impressive list of mouthwatering items on the menu. Hassle free and quick services.
Food- We ordered:
BFB Special chicken wings in ghost chilly sauce(medium spicy)- though the mixture of herbs and sauce was on point,the chicken pieces were relatively small. Expected it t be some sort of special,but interestingly the other ¬†dishes were better in comparison. The mayo dip was praiseworthy.
BFB Fish & Chips- super delicious and a must try for every seafood lover. The softness of the marinated fish distinctly complimented the crispy flavor of the covering crust..together with the dips,the taste was heavenly!!
BFB Chicken Mac & Cheese- the unique presentation was not only attractive but it did the job of keeping the dish hot till the last drop of cheese was devoured. The oh-so-cheesy bowl of mac & cheese was perfectly cooked and was absolute bliss...the chicken pieces would have tasted better if they were cut a little shorter..the accompanying bread suited better as a decorating item and tasted rather clumsy.
Beverages- Kiwi Frappe tasted too¬†frothy and is not recommended.. Rather the green apple iced tea¬†was really refreshing and goes along with the dishes very well..
Pocket Pinch- Rs.1127(including GST)
Definitely worth a visit and the actual menu has a variety of options other than what is provided here..
Keep Eating!!! All the love....

This restro is located just opposite Dugout on Sarat Bose Road, thus quite easy to locate. It is a small place but very nicely decorated which adds warmth to the ambience. Cordial staff. Coming to the food, some are excellent whereas one dish I felt was not up to the mark. We ordered Chicken Caesar Salad, Cheese Cigars, Virgin Mojito and Mushroom and Asparagus Risotto(chicken). All the items tastes very yummy and delicious especially the Mushroom and Asparagus Risotto which was mouth watering good except the Chicken Caesar Salad, which I didn't like much. It was good but not as good as expected or as good as the other items. Overall I liked this place. Looking forward to visit again.

Located out of the hustle bustle of Rabindra sadan, this cafe at Chakraberia more is in line with the recent trends of startup cafes for college goers and young officials.

The rating of 4.6 attracted me and my Didi to this place after a movie show at Nandan. It's hardly 10 min walk from there.Later, one of my friends, joined us.
 The first thing , I liked about this place is it's menu list..It was completely synchronized with its name.

The ambience was good..The decoration was akin to brick and mortar style with some photographs over there. And there was a frame with photos of those people who got into hall of fame by fatting there belly! One thing I missed about this place is a soothy background song.

Coming to the food, We embarked with the panko fried tiger prawn,which was mouthwatering and light.The mayonese and the French fries, accompanied it, were just ahh!

Next we ordered big bong burger, which was unique combination of typical Bengali Kosha mutton and fried egg, soya sauce with bun. I highly recommend this menu - just have an extra napkin to clean urself!

We ordered a Bellizza also(sorry for unable to remember the name!). The distinct thing about it was it's thin and crunchy crust with healthy toppings.

The spice of BFB special chicken wings was very tasty and would surely charge u up giving your taste buds an awesome syncretic touch of spice and sourness.

The drink accompaniments- the kiwi drink and chocolate mocktail did justice to there recommendations by Zomato. I was awestruck by the kiwi drink specially.

The owner of the outlet personally enquired about the taste of foods and asked for any suggestion. The prices, I found to be instrumental with the quality and location of it. Pricing for two would be around Rs.1100.

The staffs are courteous and seemed to be non tiring!

My rating:

Location: 4.5/5
Ambience:3.5/5
Food:4.5/5
Service:4/5
Overall:4/5

Overall it bestowed us with a good experience.  If you want to go for a good extravaganza in Bhawanipure, you may peep in here. üòÉ

This was my first visit after hearing a lot about the place and I was surely not disappointed. 
The ambience is nice and they have made good use of the limited space available to them. 
First the service. The service was great with no hiccups at all. The food came prepared hot and fresh and in quick time. A special mention to the gentleman who took care of us; Mr. Christopher. He deserves not only a pat on his back but also a small bonus from his boss !!!! With guys like him around; there will surely be more and more regulars. 
Yes...the FOOD !!!! The food was was excellent and we just did not realise how it all melted away in quick time. We ordered Alfungi Regular Pasta; Cheese cigars; Let's Nacho Regular and Mac & Cheese Regular Pizza. These were all out of the world and simply "to die for." 
Now the reason why i did not give it a 5.0 rating. we had also ordered cottage cheese skewers and they were a big letdown. The cottage cheese was hard and flat in taste. It seems the marination was not upto the mark. Apart from this dish; it was a fantastic gourmet experience. 
Hats off the My Big Fat Belly !!!!!

Its very popular for its different types of burgers and subs. Located in Bhawanipur its buzzing with teenagers. Small and cozy environment with delicious food.
Location- Bhawanipur
Ambience- nice. But the place is small. Had to wait 45mins to get a table.
Food - ordered ultimate juicy lucy in burgers, eggjactly in subs and mixed fruit virgin mojito. Both the burger and sub was awesome. Tasted different. I personally liked the sub more.
Stuff- there was a elderly madam who was continuous apologising for the delay in getting a table. Also had a chat with us. Suggested food items. Felt nice.
Definitely going there again.

At last we ended up at My big fat belly, which was on our wish list for long time.

Location : on Sarat Bose Road, exactly opposite to Dugout, quite easy to locate.

Ambience : simple and decent. Little cramped,with 6 small tables and chairs. For a large group it may be a problem. Dimmed lighting and pretty minimal decor. 

Food and beverage : we were 4 people and tried a number of items about which my views are shared below:
#virgin mojito - we took 2 pitchers. Very refreshing.

#Herb fried chicken(starter) - French fries and the tartare sauce was more to our liking than the chickens. The strips of chicken could have been more succulent.

#Sausage(starter) - the dish was suggested by restaurant person. It was mind blowing and a must try!

#Chicken skewers with herbed rice: the dish was as pleasant in taste buds as it was visually. The gravy provided alongside was complementing the dish perfectly.

#Chicken steak with mashed potatoes - mashed potatoes was a bit blande for our taste. The chicken was perfectly done with a poached egg on the top.

#Grilled bhetki with gondhoraj sauce and herbed rice : I really did not have anything so good , outside home, in recent times. The fish was fresh. The sauce was tangy , salt perfect. Hit all the chords! It's a must try according to me.

#Calypso pizza : thin crusted pizza with French fries, grilled chicken. Nice and light.

As they say 'there is always place for dessert', inspite of the above elaborate dishes we opted for desserts.
#cheesecake with blueberries - one of the best I have tasted. Loved it.
#Chocolate mousse cake - dark chocolate mousse cake was an absolute delight and met all expectations. Being a chocolate lover it was a pure bliss.

Service : prompt and good. The lady present helped us with the menu and guided about the must try items. 

Pocket pinch : we found it reasonable, considering the amount and quality of food they serve.
We had a delightful experience. Shall come back soon for more.

Best wishes to BFB and the dedicated Belly Crew.

The name attracted me the most. The day I heard about this place I made up my mind to visit but some way or the other I was not able to go but at last I made. The place is just opposite to the dugout. Not a big spacious place but good enough for a hangout. The place, the ambience, their food, service everything is really good. I found the place quite pocket friendly thought some may not. But I must recommend everyone to visit the place at least once. Had a really good experience. Looking forward to visit again.

Then i ordered grilled fish with mashed pptato in godhoraj flavour.the fish was soft,perfectly cooked,the mashed potato was creamy but the vegetables served with it was too blunt.a little amount of spice or salt would have played the trick . anyway i liked the place and its food.overall good.

Have you ever had a burger so juicy so cheesy so perfect that it makes your inners melt? Then you should try out the burgers at My Big Fat Belly.
This eatery is located on Sarat Bose Road bang opposite to Dugout(very near to Pabrai's)
Lazy sunday afternoons call for dining out and we did precisely that. We were kind of bowled out looking at the menu card. The interior is pretty well done with doors making up the ceiling of the place. There is also a semi open kitchen on display here. 
We had ordered a Grilled Chicken Burger with bacon served with french fries and a serving of coleslaw and ketchup & a Grilled Chicken Steak in a mushroom creme served with mashed potatoes and saut√®d veggies.
While the burger is a melt in the mouth beauty with smoky bacon churning out a wonderous explosion inside your mouth, the mushroom creme was so perfectly creamy and thick that it turned the steak into the clear match winner.
The steak was well done with perfect seasoning and the sauce composition was bang on mark. The burger was very messy just like that perfect burger that you never had!(well almost)
The restro is a bit crammed up with just around 6-7 tables available for service, though the staff is very courteous. I shall surely go back to this place yet again to try out their burgers and steaks.

Visiting My Big Fat belly was definitely a weekend plan.Since this is my first time here(after seeing lots of positive reviews from Zomato) this restaurant has left no flaws to let me down. 
Well located and carried away by their ambience and decor. 
We have ordered
 herb fried chicken -cirspy chicken nuggets basically with spiced mayo-tartare sauce and a handful of  French fries.Overall tastes good.
Grilled fish in gondhoraj chili lemon creme(belly burner)-bhetki fish served  with sauce and mashed potato and vegetables were palatable infact good in taste.
tiramisu -nice desert and well complemented with our food.
 virgin mojito- perfect one.
Overall verdict-
Good and great  food at a bit hby price.
This restaurant deserves 'multiple ' times visit..

This is an American food joint which is located in Sarat Bose Road, just opposite to The Dugout.
This is a small place with a good ambience and classy decor. They have 4-5 tables at the most. 
We were 5 of us and the food we ordered- 
1. 7 pieces cheese cigar- bread sticks filled with cheese and served with dips.
2. Bruschetta- this is a salad with minced mushroom and tomatoes and tastes really good, a must try for mushroom lovers.
3. Chicken and Prawn Caesar salad- bowls full of good salad soaked in mayo sauce filled with chicken and prawn consecutively. 
4. Mac n cheese- This is a chipotle with bacon and chicken and has so much cheese that it melts when it enters your mouth.  We ordered one regular Mac n cheese also with prawn where the prawns were well cooked and together with the cheese tasted heavenly.
5.Big Bong Burger- this is a must order at this outlet. This has pulled lamb, kosha mangsho Bengali style ,egg poach, cheese and mustard sauce making it a wholesome meal.
6. Juicy Lucy burger - Chicken burger with enough juice and cheese to make you go gaga.
7. Grilled chicken burger- burger with a thick grilled chicken patty together with cheese and veggies taste delicious.
8. Al fungi pizza - pizza filled with mushroom and cheese and a must try for mushroom lovers.
9.  Chickenora BFB- a chicken pizza with 4 types of chicken cooked in Indian style.
10. Tiramisu- This is the best among the desserts' section. I am out of words to describe this cake.
11. Cheesecake- a typical cheesecake made into a unique one and tastes creamy as anything.
12. Mousse cake- This has a perfect blend of coffee and chocolate mousse and so creamy that it melts in no time.
13.  Green Apple and peach ice tea- We ordered two pitchers of each and the green apple tasted so well I repeated it several times. Peach ice tea was also one of its kind.
The ambience is lively, the presentation and the unique names of the dishes make it appealing, the quantity of food is commendable, the quality is top notch, the service is impressive. The price is also easily affordable. Highly recommended!

I had gone to this place just about recently with some friends as we were looking for a good lunch outing and this place came out to be a winner .

We started with cheese cigars and the way they would melt in your mouth is amazing .
Followed by it we had mushroom buschetta which is by the way a delight for mushroom lovers like me !

We opted for chicken and prawn ceasar salads along with peach,kiwi and Iced tea served as drinks .
Iced tea has a rejuvenating taste !But kiwi tea stole the show .

Next up were their famous Pizzas -
Al fungi and chickenora absolutely stand out of all.Thin crust cheesy pizzas loaded with chicken and mushroom is just about perfect to treat your buds.

Mac and cheese pasta is also worth a try !

Personally my favorite had been the burgers namely Jucy Lucy chicken burger , Grilled chicken burger and big bong burger(which is their speciality as it has Kosha mangsho flavour)!

Last but not the least we had deserts namely chocolate cheesecake ,mango and my favourite being Tiramisu.

It is a nice place with good ambience ,good music and cosy decors but if you are a foodie you must give it a visit for their Pizzas and burgers and of course Deserts .

Food served with love and care, is a rarity these days. You are not disappointed once you make it through the door. 
Courteous staff even at the wee hours of 11:30 PM and I presume the owner's son or the owner himself. 
Pick a dish and it wont disappoint, pick a dessert - wait, pick two tiramisu - thank me later. 

At times, I do understand late Sunday night at the closing hours but perhaps the restaurant floor must be cleaned, especially the floor underneath the tables. And swiping away the garbage next to the center serve table isn't a delight to the eyes. Perhaps I was with my friends during off time - let's hope for the best next time around! 

Having said that, I should have asked for the person waiting on us - he was a true gentleman - thank you! 

And if I'm not mistaken one of the owner or the son of the owner was courteous enough to help us along the way. And you know the food is good when you see a motherly figure making the rounds past midnight. 

I for sure will have a good Monday - thank you! 

PS: I took off a point for the uncleanliness, and give a closer look at the glassware - perhaps I did find some smudges. This place deserves a 5 star. I hope this is taken up in the most positive sense.

Lived upto the reputation as just as i had been planning and thinking of since morning. Coming to the place, its a relatively small outing with around 7 tables. Not much effort been put in the decorum of the place as im sure they have satisfied every bit of it through their food. Lets kickstart about food. We started off with two of their trademark shakes- oreo & cream shake and creamie brownie shake. Now when the start is super-exciting you ought to expect more. Then came the cheese cigars followed by a regular chicken stuffed thin crust pizza. It was like knocking on heaven's door, here being my mouth. Such was a sumptous gastronomic adventure. We ended with a mushroom rissotto with chicken flakes. It was heavy as cheese was molted and drained in it.
Overall their food covers up for all and everything being pointed negative about them. I would love to be here again and would also recommend others as well.
Cheers!! to the 'belly crew' team.

Pros- Good food, ambience is good (preferable for friends group, cozy couples)
Cons - Space is very small, not advisable for big families w/ kids, will pinch your pocket compared to quantity, stuff knows the menu well and provide suggestions but are a bit unattentive
Warning- Visit only if you are open to continental, American food type

This place has been on my bucket list for quite a while, more so because of the rating and reviews in Zomato. Yesterday I finally got the opportunity to visit the place. It's a little place quite easy to locate though in Bhawanipore. The yellow lights and the combination of high and low chairs give you a very pub like feel (even though the place is purely non alcoholic). A very unique decor which closely resembles the theme 'American restaurant' is indeed very welcoming.

Coming to the food, we had ordered a grilled chicken burger, a Russian mafia big fat sub, a fresh lime and a cold coffee.
The burger was heavenly, the chicken was very succulent and perfectly wrapped between the poached egg and the fresh lettuce, salami and cheese was indeed a delight. Adding to the burst of flavours were the caramelised onion rings and the coleslaw.
The Russian mafia sub was very filling. The addition of boiled egg was very refreshing. But it was a little bland and lacked sauces.
The beverages were equally tasty and went really well with the food. The best thing about the beverages section was they even had an option for pitchers. 

I was a little disappointed with the staff and the service. But all in all the place completely lived upto my expectation and I am surely visiting this place again.

i have been following the Zomato page for MBFB for the past few months for everything this place has,  comes with a twist.... to start of with the name which is different for sure.... the pictures posted on zomato for both food and decor was extremely impressive and offcourse a whopping 4.6 rating which tells a success story even before you visit the place.... 
the night life and dining culture of the city is changing and MBFB just adds to it.... it stays open till 1.30am over the weekends.... so people like me do manage to visit after a hectic Saturday night and i was accompanied by my brother and wife and we reached at around 11.30pm....all the way i knew what to expect from this place since i hav virtually read all the reviews and almost saw all the pictures posted but still i was so thrilled to push the door and take a glimpse inside.... surely not in kolkata i am,  is it.... ok to cut it short,  the place has picked up a very unique decor with a pub like environment... p. s. they dont serve alcohol... lol... it was not full and thankfully we got a seat right away.... i kind of knew whats there in the menu but still pondered thru the pages and finally settled for a non veg grill platter and a big 12" pizza for us.... the food arrived and voila.... it was sex inside the mouth wit every bite.... i seldom use this phrase but when i do,  i mean it.... right from presentation to cutleries to sauce consistency to meat quality and pizza crust,  everything was top notch.... the non veg grill platter was actually pretty interesting and a simple dish which was taken to the next level in the way it was conceived with the texture of the creamy mash and the rustic mutton patty along with the crunch of the veggies and the silky smooth red wine jus.... immaculate..... 10 out of 5 for the food.... 

now coming to highlighting a few points to the owner which is purely and feedback and i am sure these can be managed or it was just the odd day where i faced it.... the staff are extremely polite and seems well versed with the menu but are extremely un attentive... we had to ask them to fill our glasses throughout our stay whilw they were 4-5 people catering 3 tables.... the place was a little dirty with food particles and tissues all around so maybe a periodic swiping of the floor would help.... the ac was dripping again throughout the stay and hopefully can be fixed.... i wont complain of the waiting time since the food was top notch but others might since we were served almost after good 45 mins and can be annoying to others... the prices are pretty steep with 1100 shelled out for these two items.... the menu rates in zomato are not updated for long it seems since the rates are higher than what they say for all the items... and the worst thing was that we ordered a grilled bhetki and after 20mins, were told that its unavailable.... so a lil mismanagement it seems.... 

it takes a lot to run a restaurant and you only do it when u got passion and not for money,  surely not for money only..... the owner seems to have plenty of passion since he takes the time out to read reviews and comment on them specially the ones which are negative.... a very very rare trait i must say extremely admirable.... a rating of 4.5 inspite of few niggles are due to extremely good food that should always come first.... i know it since i am in the same journey myself.... extremely happy for this new place and all the best for the future

This is the second time I am visiting this place.. very well decorated and well oraganized.. this is located just opposite of Dugout.. very easy to locate.
Today I had herbal fried chicken, bacon boam, brownie shake and orio shake..
Orio shake is all time favourite.. expect more orio crunch in it.. but the taste was good..
Pork boam was mind blowing.. the pork was nicely minced and stuffed.. bacon is very soft..
Now come to fried chicken.. the chicken was very soft and properly fried, served with french fries and mayo.. a good place to hangout with your friends.. and pork loves should try bacon boam once.. its a must try..

Located at Sarat Bose Road (exactly opposite of Dugout), it bragged a position in my list of favourite restaurants on my first visit to this place.. Though small but a sweetly decorated.
Coming to the food, we had ordered for BFB Chicken wings, Bacon Bomb Risotto, Brownie shake and Blueberry shake. The bacon risotto was one of the BEST dishes I've ever had (5/5). The BFB chicken wings were very spicy but good (3.8/5) but I have had a better preparation elsewhere. The shakes were delicious!

On a rainy afternoon, when the sudden urge to have good food raised it's head; we decided to tick off one of the places that had been on our list for quite some time. 
My big fat belly, a short walk away from the Netaji Bhavan metro station, combines a simple, yet artistic decor with some really good food, so much so that minor inconveniences like sparse seating take a back seat. 
Coming on to the food, we decided to stick to the favorites, and they are favorites for a reason. 

Cheesy cigars.. the perfect combination of crunch outside and melt in your mouth goodness inside along with fingerlicking strawberry sauce set the tone for the delights yet to come. 
The big bong burger.. in one word, sumptuous. The nostalgia of Sunday lunches made into a melts-in-mouth patty is a treat for all senses. 
Meaty monster pizza.. overloaded with meat to such extents that it visibly sags when you pick up a slice. And just as effective gastronomically. Turned my partner into an ardent pizza fan. Recommended. 

The staff is courteous, the service prompt. A perfect little getaway into a gustatory wonderland.

Located in Sarat Bose road opposite Dugout, MBFB is a gem. The moment you step inside, you're mesmerised by it's beautiful ambience. The playlist is good, the lighting is dim, with a feel of old school charm..
Coming to the menu, it has been formulated very cleverly since its innovative and every item is prepared with full dedication. They believe in serving both quantity and quality food over a not so pocket pinching rates.
For starters we ordered :
1. Cheesy cigar sticks : This dish deserves a 8/10. Served with a unique strawberry sauce and a creamy herb sauce, the cigars tasted good.

2. Chicken wings in special BFB ghost sauce : Deserving a whopping 9.5/10, we ordered this in medium spicy sauce, and there was a very good balance of spicy factor along with the mayo dip.

For main course we ordered :

1. Juicy Lucy chicken burger : Man! This was a treat to our eyes..Such an enormous gluttony! Served with generous amount of fries, onion rings, and a good patty along with fried eggs..Juicy Lucy is no doubt one of the best burgers I've ever tasted. Without a second thought, I rate this dish 10/10.

2. Risotto in spinach and corn : I don't exactly remember the specific name of this dish, but tasted heavenly. So 10/10.

3. Chicken skewers with herb rice : This dish is complete in its own way. Served with 6 pieces of chicken in a hanging skewer, with herb rice and a separate red sauce.. I loved the flavours of it, but the chicken pieces were a bit hard to chew. Somewhat dry too. So a 7/10.

We were so full that we couldn't try out the dessert section, which we intend to do during our next visit.
Overall, MBFB is a great place which serves amazing food.

The outlet is easy to locate but is quite small. I tried there grilled chicken burger , juicy Lucy burger (lamb) , Oreo and cream shake , blueberry shake and agarwalji burger. I loved the juicy Lucy and shakes but the grilled chicken burger was a bit dry and lacked taste. Fries , coleslaw And onion rings on the side were great . The staff and owner was quite interactive and courteous. They made the whole experience a little better. I hope they get few more outlets opened up. Overall a great lunch.

Went there today for a lunch. The interior, though small, is beautifully decorated. The behaviour of the staffs were very good. Had chicken sausage for starter. The best thing about it is that - the sausage is not readymade, they make it themselves and it tastes very nice. For main course we had bacon bomb. It was delicious. Both the dishes were well cooked. For drinks we had a pitcher of virgin mojito. Overall it was a good experience.

A new destination for the burger lovers giving them the chance to think beyond the McD n KFC. The burgers are fresh,tender and juicy and way better than the old players in this market. The crispy onion rings serves as a right companion to the soft burger buns. The ambience is fine but the size of the restaurant is a bit small but if you are lucky to find the empty seats on the weekends then this place is the right place for your burger cravings.....will try their burger challenge next time which is only available on the weekdays...we had also tried their pastas but it was more of an average....but thumbs up for their yummy n big burgers...

Been eyeing this place on Zomato for the longest time, so when we decided to have lunch around Sarat Bose road this was naturally the first option.  

Sarat Bose Roads offer foodies lot of options, but if you want to satisfy your belly, you may want to step in here. 
Big Fat Belly is located right on the main road with big   boarding so you can't miss it. It has no allocated parking spot, so if you are self driving parking WILL be a major problem

Stepping in to this rather small shop to with a big appetite I was greeted by dim lighting and seats with chairs. It can accommodate about 30 people. And having big groups may be a problem. 
It has posters and the decoration is minimilistic. 
 
We reached about 1pm, so we squeezed into the only remaining table. Recommend reaching early ! 
The menu card is a happy one with detailed description of their bellyfires. 

We Ordered Pizza, chicken hokonara. It's a thin crust pizza with a lot of toppings and little cheese, just the way I love it. 
Next we ordered, Grill Chicken Steak, it had one big piece of chicken on a bed of buttery mashed potato and veggies with the perfect cream mushroom sauce and a slice of garlic bread. Recommend this !!! 5 stars! 
Next we had mac and cheese, macaroni cooked al dante, and too cheesy. The only thing it lacked was a bit of seasoning. 

drinks were excellent, the oreo shake and caramel shake. 

The food service was really prompt, the managemnt excellent and most importantly food brilliant. 

FOR that we ordered it was a pocket pinch of 2000 for 5 people. 

The only con is parking. 
Everything is 5/5. 

Will I come back? yes!!!

The ultimate juicy Lucy is the best burger I had till now. It was so soft and cheesy that it melted in my mouth. They served it with French fries,egg and caramelized onions and some kind of dip which had a bit sour creamy taste.Then I took the bacon bomb which is a mixture of bacon,pork and cheese moulded into some ball shape and it was delicious.The meat inside is 100 percent pure and soft at the same time and the filling of bacon makes it a bit spongy at times . If you are a bacon lover and carnivore ,you will surely like it.I also tasted a bit of chicken steak in J's BFB sauce which my dad took.It was spicy and very good.In drinks, I had one brownie shake which was great and finally a fresh lime soda with salt for proper digestion.The soda had a funny taste(not bad but a different).U will get a shock in ur tongue whenever you will sip it and I enjoyed it.All over the food experience was great and a pure American cuisine- a perfect place for burger and meat lovers.

LOCATION:

Situated on Sarat Bose Road opposite Jai Hind Dhaba (About 200 m ahead and on the opposite side)

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

My Big Fat Belly is the perfect example of the food and restaurant modernization in Kolkata. People have started thinking outside Park Street and Tangra and as a result have presented an opportunity for novel start ups with unique concepts to open their doors.¬†

The interiors of the place are well done up. Filament lamps add a mellow feel to the place and naked brick walls washed in white give it an american diner feel. Although the place is small, its laid out well and the owner is very proactive in the operations of the place which is one big reason for its popularity. I liked the signage outside done in low powered bulbs which reminded me of one of my favorite bodega's in Chicago.

WINE & DINE:

Among the few occasions that I have been here, I have ordered for the following:

Pizza Margherita : Undoubtedly this place has one of the best late night pizzas you can find in the city. Its thin, soft and crisp at the same time which means the chef has got his dough bang on. The pizza itself is flavorful with a generous quantity of cheese and toppings. They hold back on overcooking their pizzas to make it crisp and brown as many places in the city do and that adds a hint of authenticity to it.

Agarwalji Burger : Its their veggie friendly version of the Indian burger. My wife likes the same and orders it everytime we go. I find it to be decent but not mind blowing. I feel that the burger is presented with innovation with a syringe carrying a tamarind sauce punched through it and gives the consumer a nice way of interacting with what they're eating. But the flavors are common and lack the kick that the presentation has.

Cheese Rolls : What could possibly go wrong with this one ? The dish is well made with oodles of cheese and a nice dipping sauce. I would have liked a hint of black pepper in the same which would have added a bit of punch in every bite.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

I found the dishes to be a bit overdone with cheese. However, that is my personal view and flavor. I think the people in the city love that very aspect about the place. So no complains on that.

VERDICT:

A good eatery in the heart of the city run by proactive owners serving genuine food at honest prices. Far better than the half the branded diners in town. Recommended !

My Big Fat Belly has long been on my wishlist and finally went there today. And to be very honest it was simply awesome. We ordered chicken wings (Full), Cold coffee pitcher and Fish & Chips chips (Full). The food was really great and fulfilled our expectations. The ambience was really impressive and the hosts were cordial as well. Looking forward to visiting this place again to try out the other dishes.

We went here on a Sunday and it was really packed.The place is quite small with a capacity of around 20 people. Coming to the food we ordered cheese cigars and stuffed cheesy loaves for starters. Both were quite good. We then ordered the shroominator and the agarwalji burger. These again were good. We also ordered the Alfungi pizza , the pesto pesto pizza and the sun-dried tomato risotto. These three were absolutely delicious and I would strongly recommend these three. We also tried the cottage cheese steak with sauted vegetables and rice which was also really nice and so were the cannelloni and the ginger orange. In short there was nothing that I tried that wasn't nice . Would strongly recommend this place.

This place is located opposite to Dugout on Sarat Bose Road, is a bit small place having an accomodation of approximately 25 people. Went for a Sunday dinner with family.
Coming to the food we ordered gooey cheese cigars, stuffed cheesy loaf, shroominator, pesto-pesto pizza and sun-dried tomatoes and chilly risotto. And as for the drinks it was ginger and orange mojito.
The stuffed cheesy loaf, pizza and the risotto were really good. Overall, it was a nice experience.

There is no sincerer love than the love of food and if the food is Italian there is nothing romantic than it.My Big Fat Belly is no exception.Located in Sarat Bose Road this restaurant serves decent american and italian foods. The outlet is small but it will attract you immediately once you enter the place,nicely decorated and sophisticated. Ambience is cool and calm.Service is prompt and fast.

Let‚Äôs come to the food now.We have tried a lot of items there.

Cheese Cigar-crunchy,cheesy,awesome in taste with the dips.

Bruschetta-wonderfully decorated,and flavourful.

Caesar Salad-have tried two types (with prawns and chicken),both are delicious and divine,a recommended one for salad lovers.

In drinks Green Apple Ice Tea and Peach Ice Tea are winners.

Trust me you can never say no to Pizza specially when it is tempting and mouthwatering. Pizza is not trend,it‚Äôs a way of life for a foodie. We have tried two types of pizzas

Al Fungi pizza- it was over the top and heavenly tasty,highly recommended of My BFB.

Chickenora pizza-this one was too amazingly delicious and yummy.Pizza lovers just can‚Äôt give it a miss.

Now coming to the Pasta‚Äôs.People just adore pasta,it‚Äôs a simple fact and I am a huge fan of pasta,I can eat those every single day.

Mac and Cheese pasta with chicken is a magic,tantalizing,wonderful in taste,pasta lovers must try,highly recommended.

Burgers are the trump card of My BFB.Had their

Juicy Lucy Chicken,Griller Chicken Burger,both are distinctive and enticing.

Their famous Big Bong Burger is just wow,it‚Äôs difficult to find a proper adjective for it,mind blowing.Have never tried this type of burger before it in this city.I can eat this by sitting in the restaurant with gravy and the ketch up dripping down my face,highly recommended.

There is always a room for dessert,they mesmerize my heart.

Tiramisu is my all time favourite and no exception this time.Mousse cake and cheesecake are enjoyable too.

My little compact belly thanks My Big Fat Belly for this pleasant experience.

Next up we had their famous pizzas -Al Fungi and Chickenora.To my surprise i liked the Al fungi better as it had a tangy base.The chicken pizza is special too as it has 5 types of chickens served on it .
Awesome variety,Awesome food.Must visit.

For Burgers we had -

Coming to the food, everything which you see on menu is worth a bite. The presentation and taste is 5 star. You should not miss their shakes and beverages. We had a big pizza and chicken sausages along with shake & the bill amount was still so low. I would definitely recommend it to everyone who prefer food before ambience.

We ordered chicken mac and cheese, Alfredo,  brownie with ice cream. The dishes were simply awesome with the pastas so very tasty and creamy. Just yummmmm..... the brownie was sizzling hot with good amount of walnuts  which complemented the vanilla ice2 cream so  very well. The lady who was sitting in a corner gave us such a warm welcome.

Found just at the exact location where it's showing on map. We (Two people) went into and found a retro theme inside. I found that a pleasing ambience. Things we ordered: Pasta Arabiatta Chicken with mixed sauce, BFB Non-Veg Grill Platter of Lamb. To our surprise they served us very quick. The pasta was served first and no doubt it was tasty with enough chicken pieces. Mixed sauce it was and probably white sauce would have been tasty too. Then came the BFB Non-Veg Grill platter and that had a damn variety!! We took the option of rice and not mashed potato with this. So there were rice, a handmade sausage, a fried egg, a lamb bacon, a lamb medallion and some fried veggies. I loved the sausage most and the rice was just perfect with a pleasing aroma. The bacon was tasty as well but the lamb medallion is not for everyone as practically it has got a bit smell of red meat which many won't like while having that.
They've got a varied menu, so I would rather visit again to feed myself & to rate this higher.
P.s.- Price doesn't include GST (18% on this day)

Wow! What a gastronomical experience to behold! We went on a Saturday midnight and surprisingly found the place totally empty. Ordered cheese cigars, pork sausages, oreo shake, the meaty monster pizza and the Gondhoraj Lemon Creme Grilled Fish. The gooey cheese cigars did make our day yeah and the oreo shake was pretty sinful with the sweetness perfectly balanced with the whipped cream. The tangy quirky pork sausages tasted out of the world. The meaty monster pizza was quite a treat with a thin crispy crust topped with generous amount of chicken salami sausages and bacon. But for me the highlight of the experience was the Gondhoraj Lemon Creme Grilled Fish. That aroma! That texture and freshness of the fish! That portion size! Mindblowing! The bill of INR 1600 with GST quite justified our order. Overall a helluva experience but taking a point off for the extremely dirty washroom!

The food was excellent, we ordered the meaty monster pizza, checken wings, pasta carbonara and something similar to a lasagna, the food was excellent, the price was a little high for the quantity, but it was acceptable considering the quality of the food. The service was also satisfactory, everyone was well behaved and attentive.
The only reason It did not get a 4.5 was because of the ambiance. There was a pool of water where we sat. The place is a little congested, so some people might get a little claustrophobic, and there were some spider-webs in the light shade hanging right above us. Also our table felt a little oily.

had Chicken The Ultimate Juicy Lucy Burger
Inspired from Texas,
chicken stuffed with cheese blend, caramelized onions, fried egg, pickles imported cheese blend, Texas sauce, onion rings, served with fries & coleslaw.

review - average! :/ my expectations were lot more :| PS the chicken patty was awesome but still... lastly price wise pretty on the higher side!

P.S. i upload reviews through PC but due to some error uploaded through mobile that's why the photos are not in order!

Been to this Hell's kitchen this evening . It's a small cosy place perfectly highlighted with cool posters but the belly crew is really good and courteous.  Now we ordered 
1.- Gooey cheese cigars ( well this was finger licking good . And the main attraction of this dish was the 'strawberry chilli sauce' quite innovative and amazing)      2- The ultimate juicy lucy chicken burger ( this was definitely a turn off. And was worthless and not at all good. The fries served with this was hard and burger was tasteless too)
3-  Grilled fish - this was definitely belly burner. One of the best steak I've ever had . The mash potato was definitely the cherry on the cake . So fulfilling and lip smacking totally .
4-  fruit mojito (it was good  and very refreshing. )
5 - ginger orange mojito ( this was okayish the ginger was bit more  which killed the  flavour of orange i felt so ) 


 Overall it was good experience . We wanted to try the deserts but unfortunately we dint have a big belly üò≠üò≠üò≠

Recently visited this small cozy restaurant for lunch with my friends. We ordered chicken wings in ghost sauce and bacon wrapped prawns for starters. The prawns were delicious and the portion was good. We also order for a refreshing green apple iced tea pitcher. For the mains, we tried the lamb shank, the Mac n cheese with chicken and bacon and a bacon bomb. The portions were very filling and the food was delicious. Overall, my big fat belly is a great choice to make for a good meal as they meet all your expectations. The only drawback was the service, either they were understaffed the day we visited or the waiters were in general inattentive.

A very cosy place with an elaborate menu. 
This place has definitely got the heart. From the moment you walk in till the moment you walk out, you see dedication. This place wants you to truly enjoy your food. 
I went there with a friend and we ordered a chicken steak with black pepper sauce and herb rice, a non veg platter with mashed potatoes, a watermelon mojito and an orange ginger mojito. The food was undoubtedly delicious and cooked to perfection and the meat was soft and succulent.
I will definitely recommend this place to people. 

The only drawback I experienced was the noise level inside. There was music, loud customers and busy staff. There was a lot happening around us. Having said that, I can't really blame the restaurant for this, but a slight inclination towards trying to maintain a bit of quietude would resound loudly on the restaurant's part.

I had ordered the vegetarian "juicy lucy", apparently their best vegetarian burger, which was a complete disappointment; dry and flavourless! When the owner asked how I liked my order, I told her it was not as good as expected, to which she had the gall to say "well, you can't expect much from a vegetarian burger"!! Definitely not a place for vegetarians..

Had a bad experience and gave it a one star first, but the owner replied and wanted me to visit again so I thought I should, went there today and was very delighted. Ordered the nachos, juicy Lucy burger and pesto pesto pizza for food. Drinks- mixed fruit mojito and chocolate mousse slice and mango cheese cake for dessert. Loved everything. One thing I love about the place is that the food is cheesy and I being a cheese lover could not have asked for more. The mango cheese cake was amazing and the owner was very sweet and took care of me and my friends very well. As the owner had said to me in his comment that they leave no stone unturned to make their customers happy, they did live up to it.

Well, I was surprised to find this place almost crowded on a Thursday evening! Luckily, I found a table as soon as I reached, but after that people started pouring in. The tables and chairs are quite cute. There are round tables and then there are also the bench type. It is a little congested as the area is very small and it isn't exactly cosy; noisy as well. However, all this is made up for by their food and service. The staff is prompt and professional. And even though not elaborate, the menu is quite fascinating and novel. I ordered a california orange with cinnamon mocktail. The light cinnamon flavour is a fantastic innovation. I had their Greek salad which was interesting. In the main course I had a cottage cheese steak with red wine and rosemary sauce (you can get a pepper or mushroom sauce variation). This was served with herb rice (you can get it with mashed potato also). I thought it was very tasty and wonderfully plated and served. Overall, I enjoyed the food.

Cautious about figure? 
Well you'll have to give up on that, while you procure a big fat belly after a big fat meal here. 
Hell's Kitchen. BFB Bible. Quirky food frames about Fryday, Instaham, Pugtato and the likes. It has stacked up all the collateral perks needed to highlight the appeal of this rather little yet yielding joint, to mostly the youngsters of this time.
Place isn't much capacious, often you have to wait in a waiting zone, where you can order quick bites or drinks if you wish. However the management is good and the waiting doesn't tickle much after you're served. 
Let's get to the main story. 
Food and drinks are highly palatable. Won't say super great, but considering the price, I'd say it's top notch. 
Started with mocktails. 
It was called Strawberry Delight, and truly so, it brings a smile on your face as you revisit childhood. The pink drink covered with a big foam sprinkled with tiny sweet treats, is really a treat to the eyes and joy to the heart. 
Kiwi Frappe, undoubtedly my favourite from there. The slushy, pleasing frozen green juice with kiwi pulp is the ultimate refresher. 
Also we took a pitcher of Ginger Ale Mojito. Not only it was cost friendly, it turned out to be absolutely tantalizing. 

As for solids, the menu covers a wide range of what it offers. 
Grilled Chicken Burger, definitely nothing like your regular ones. Packed with a thick chicken patty, a salami strip, jack cheese, caramelized onions and other greens, topped by fried egg, it was totally a mouthful and toothsome. 
Meaty Monster, a thin crust pizza which keeps up with its name. Perfectly crispy crust topped with generous portions of sausage, salami, bacon greased with cheese and sauce, it was devoured with vim. A true blue winner. 
Grilled Chicken Steak with Red Wine and Rosemary sauce, a big syllable name with its glorious kingdom of taste. Tenderized juicy steak sided with sauted veggies and fried egg steals both tongue and heart. Can't get enough of it. 
Grilled Fish in Chilly Tomato Ricotta. My my, now isn't fish a delicacy? Delicately pleated fresh slices of bhetki, grilled and marinated to beguile oneself, and successfully doing so. Accompanied by herbed rice, it could replace any fish-rice dish, eazy-peazy.
Becon Bomb. Yep, beware of the explosion inside your mouth. The only kind of explosion which doesn't kill you. Minced spiced pork ensembling cheese cubes within it, wrapped by bacon sheets into a floral round bud as if; draws your eyes at first sight. The sauce poured over it drips into base of smashed potatoes, making you salivate. Cut through it and witness the oozing cheese making its way through pork and beacon slowly, truly a sight to behold. Man, won't even talk about the taste. Go try it out yourself. "Beyond the senses of a carnivore."

Sad. I wanted to try desserts too. But I have only one belly in this mortal life. Next time, eh.

My big fat belly known for it¬† Oh-so Delicious burger!
Fails to serve you with¬† any good food.
I had heard so many people talking about this place, so I was quite excited to pay a visit,
The ambience was fine, not too shabby
But the food, was a big time dissappointment.
We had ordered,
Wings served in¬† chilli ghost sauce and juicy lucy burger(recommended by the staff,as he believed it to one of the best burgers they serve)
But expectation hurts,
And so did the taste of the burger
The chicken wings was not at all spicy , and tasted¬† miserable.
Overall, their quality of food doesnt deserves more than 2.5 stars.
The only good thing about My Big Fat belly is their chilled water and mayonnaise sauce.
I will surely not vist their again!

-One Food lover.

Al-Pachino(pizza) was the best and Oreo shake was like heaven for us. We absolutely enjoyed the food.
First when we entered the place we thought this place is really small and congested but the food made us forget about everything. The name of this restaurant is only enough to attract people.

Small little gem near Bhawanipore. Went with my group of friends and had a lovely time. Nice ambience. The place is small though and can't accomodate too many people. We went on a saturday evening and saw people waiting. Great burgers..we ordered quite a lot of varieties like the lamb juicy lucy, chicken juicy lucy, grilled chicken and one with the fish. The fish burger was a let down, otherwise the rest were simply amazing. The mixed fruit mojito was also very refreshing and the cheese cigars were great as appetizers.

One of the best places in Kolkata to enjoy quality food. The place is really small and cosy but it still has a charm of its own. They have a lip smacking menu which includes pastas, pizzas,burgers and shawarmas , although the shawarma is not available most of the time. I had the sun dried tomato risotto and the chicken pasta over there, and both were really delicious. The brownie shake is really amazing and also tried mixed fruit pitcher which can serve around 5 to 6 people. The standard of the food is really high comparing its price. A must visit for all.

As the name goes,it will leave you with big fat belly.One of the most amazing places to eat,eat and eat in Kolkata.
We had ordered three things and we wish we could eat more and order more.
Everything was perfect in quantity and quality and flawless in taste,look and service.
I loved the courteous staff,they were always ready to help and suggest perfectly.
We had ordered one Formaggio pizza,that was perfect in cheese and delicious to taste.
Then we got the Great Agarwalji burger(as the column suggests Burgasm,it truly is)
It was so attractive first of all.The burger was served with tamarind syringe ,that was really interesting.Also fries and bhujiya.
We also went for Kiwi frappe that was so good that it completed our meal.You get the richness and feel of Kiwi in it.
I never had a more satisfying experience than this at any other place.
Just the place is a little small otherwise it is even reasonable.

Tried the non-veg grilled platter. It's incredible, and the portions are sumptuous. Great value for money. There was a misunderstanding due to a waiter's fault. The owner gave us complementary French fries and hash brown bread to make up for that!
However, the place is small. Approx 20 seats total.

Located opposite Dugout on Sarat Bose Road, this is a very small place with say 6-7 tables. The waiting time can exceed 30 minutes. It's open till late in the night, hence if one wants to beat the crowd, one can plan for a late dinner.

We ordered Gooey Cheese Cigars, Bellisma Fries, Cold Coffee Pitcher, Herb Fried Chicken, Al Fungi@ pizza, Gardenire Pizza and BFB Veg Grill Platter for appetizer and main. In desserts we had Tiramisu and Squidgy Brownie with ice cream. The service is bit slow, but as they say patience is rewarding :). The food here is absolutely phenomenal. All the dishes were tastefully presented and thoroughly enjoyed by us.

Only disappointment being some dishes which have been discontinued are still in the Menu. Please update your Menu.

Overall "A must visit". We will surely go back to taste some mouthwatering burgers.

My Big Fat Belly- this name itself is enough to draw your attention, isn't it? So, it was in the wishlist from the day I found this one in zomato. And the next thing which drew my attention is definitely the higher side rating this cafe had. So after many plan and plan we are here on the last day before GST may hit our big fat belly.

Location:
___________
This is located at sarat Bose road. I will not say that just opposite the Dugout, as this Big Fat Belly is just good enough to located by its name only. Just trust the Google map if needed.

Decoration:
______________
Honestly, when we entered the cafe we were a bit shock, as the place was very small, hardly 20 people can be there at one go. The decoration of light and wall is offcourse a bit catchy. Then the lady, owner of the cafe came and welcome us. And trust me she is very keen about her guest and will make you very ease.

In the mean time.. one thing was going in my mind, such a small place, I mn how it can get so heavy rating.. I was in little bit dilemma, as I insisted my other companion to come over here :P

And then came the foods and beverages , and one thing I can say the taste of food ended my all confusion, queries and all.

Snacks:
____________
‚úì cheese cigar : these come in mug , cigar but of chesse. And the 1st bite of it set the tone, it's just delicious. 7 pieces of cheese cigar with two dips.

‚úì Stuffed Cheesey loaf : we took the regular one. This one is Cheesey bread ( we asked them to not to garlic). But anyway that taste just extraordinary. I mean how can a bread preparation be so tastey.

‚úì Pork Sausage: Sausage tossed and cooked with pure perfection. Excellent one.

Burger:
___________

By the way before going deep into this,let me make one thing pretty clear- this is the paradise of burger. And as they called it it's Burgasam :D

‚úì My Big Bong Burger: as the owner said " this is a tribute to the bengaless" and rightly so. burger with kosa mangsho , fried egg, onion ring and mustard sauce. Pure delight for us. Superb one. We took it twice.

‚úì Chicken Juicy Luicy: Another burger. And most importantly complement it's name totally.  We took the chicken one. It comes with spinach, corn, fried egg, cheese and Texan sauce. Just yummy.

‚úì walk from chowrangiee: Another excellent burger preparation. The chicken burger taste just superb.

Evert burger served with French fries and most important part is that every one taste superb and taste different.

Pizza:
_________
‚úì Meaty Monster - we took the pork one. And trust me it was just insane. Thin crust pizza with salami, sausage, Becon with tomato sauce. Excellent. Regular one contains 8 pieces. Enough for 4.

Main Courses:
__________________
‚úì Spinach and Corn Cannelloni: Cannelloni is basically a dish baked in chesse with stuffed veg/ meat rolled in pasta.
We took the veg one. This was excellent in taste.
‚úì Annie Aunty Alfredo : we took the regular one. Pasta cooked in white sauce with cheese, bell paper. It tastes really good. Veg one.

‚úìAgilo Oilo sea food : Pasta ( noodles type) cooked in olive oil with prawn. This on taste just superb. When I was having it, I had my stomach full, but still I could feel the excellent taste of it.

‚úì Baconn Bomb: 
As the name suggests, this one is like a bomb , wrapped in bacon sheet and stuffed with masala shredded pork. Served with smashed potatoes bad veggies. Mind-blowing.

Beverages:
_______________

Now we mainly tasted their mojitos only. And that menu is not available in zomato. They have shakes also.

More interesting part is that they have the pitcher option for mojito s.

‚úì Mixed Fruit Mojito ( regular) - excellent in taste. Just refreshing. 
‚úì Virgin Mojito ( pitcher) - they served it in pitcher- you can make 5 glass out of it. Just mind-blowing and refreshing. 
‚úì Ginger Orange Mojito ( regular) - the taste of orange and ginger is just superb. It was damn refreshing.
‚úì Ginger Orange Mojito ( pitcher) - At the end of the meal we need it. So this time we ordered the pitcher one.

Each mojito prepared with damn perfection. You will taste the real mojito here, there is no artificial taste.  I have short of words to acknowledge it.

Dessert:
____________

To be honest we had plan to taste two or three items in desserts. But the stomach , perdon me, our BELLY was totally full. So we decided to taste only one.

‚úì Mango Cheese Cake : excellent one. 

Now suming up the overall experience:  each and every item, taste just superb. There is no room of any complaints. They are just bang on in their preparation.

To the owner: Mam, you are just superb. to make it more correct you and your BFB team. You hospitality, taste of food is totally van experience to remember.

Just one recommendation: if possible just try to increase the sitting space. As the buzz you guys are creating with your food, the area will need to increase for sure :)
------------------

Now all that cost 5426 INR for 5. Yes we were overloaded. Even with two dish less also , we were with our BELLY full. 

To all : I guess nothing left to tell, just go there. And make your Belly a little more fat :D

I have heard a lot about BFB's burgers so it was on my wishlist for a long time. The outlet is decorated with cute photographs and quirky lines on the tables. We ordered mix fruit mojito, bbq chicken wings, crumb fried chicken burger and porked you pizza. Mix fruit mojito is the clear winner. A pitcher full of this refreshing drink made our day. The 6 pieces of chicken wings was a perfect start to the evening. They served it with mayo and we have added Texan mayo dip. The crumb fried chicken burger had four pieces of fried chicken pieces in the patty. Chicken pieces were juicy and the burger was large and filling. Then we had the Porked you pizza and it was just too simple to taste though my partner enjoyed it. The burger and mojito are definitely recommended and this restaurant serves a large quantity which doesn't hurt our pocket. Overall experience- 
Ambience - 4.5/5

Location: It is a cosy joint in the crossing of Sarat Bose Road and Chakraberia. It is on Sarat Bose road and you will not miss it.

Ambience: Small cosy warm joint with about 25-30 seating.

Food: For all it is a must visit. Their food is just out of the world. We had ordered their signature dish the bacon bomb, American pepperoni thin crust cheese pizza, Fish and Chips,  Bellisma French fries, virgin mojito . 
The bacon bomb was perfect, lovely succulent meat in an amazing tasty sauce and topped with 2 yummy sausages. A Must have.
The American pepperoni pizza is the best that you get in the city. Would definitely recommend it.
 
It has become my favourite food place in the city.

Service:  They have a completely personalised service as the owner Akarsh and his mother are constantly taking care of all the guests. The service is very good and quick. We were so full that we were in no mood for dessert. But very kind of Akarsh that he said no meal is complete without a dessert so he insisted it is on the house and gave us tiramisu cheese cake. It was just heavenly, never to be missed.

Pocket pinch: Around Rs.950 for 2 persons. Great value for money place.

We had planned to go to this place a lot of times and somehow ended up elsewhere. Yesterday finally was this day when we successfully made it there. It is a small and nice place and once you order the food you are sure to be bowled over by it. We ordered- 

The American pizza- It was beautiful with all the cheese and the pork pepperoni. I'm not a pork person but I loved this one.

The meaty monster- it was topped with 5 kinds of meat and tasted amazing.

Chicken wings- this was also good. But only one complain-  we ordered the medium spicy ones since we thought the 'faadu' one would be too spicy for our palletes but was a little disappointed since the medium spicy ones weren't spicy at all. 

The big bong burger- This was a burger filled with kosha mangsho and egg. Again I'm not a mutton person but this tasted amazing. The perfect blend of the mutton, egg and the mustard sauce is very appealing to your taste buds.

Mixed fruit mojito- This was by far the best item we'd ordered. We went for the pitcher and it was a very wise choice on our part. It was perfect. 

Finally I would also like to say a little bit about the service which was super amazing and and very aptly timed. This is another plus of this place apart from the food. So I would recommend this place to all the foodies out there.

Just love their food specially the grilled chicken burger comes fully stuffed woth masses of chicken along with a fried egg. Also we loved the french fries with all the layering of mayo and dips. The dips are super amazing here. Pocket pinch again varies from person to person but for  our last visit it for 1000 for two

The walls and ceiling adorn doors and windows. There are cute posters that reads 'pugtato' and 'bellies out'. The bright yellow lights add to the vibrancy of this small yet cosy place. 

Food we had :

1. Greek salad with chicken : I am not a big fan of salads but this was really a good experience. Chunks of chicken and fresh veggies tossed together. Tasted really good!

2. Cheese cigar : Gooey mozzarella sticks that I absolutely loved. 

3. Bacon wrapped prawns : You can never go wrong with bacon and prawn. This was one of my favourites from the day. Well tossed prawns wrapped in bacon that melted in mouth made me love this dish!

4. Murg-e-aazam : Sandwich with shredded chicken. The flavour was great and it was very filling. This is served with fries and kurkure.

5. Crumb fried chicken burger : There were three to four crispy fried chicken patty inside the burger. It tasted brilliant!

6. Chickennora : A thin crust pizza with both shredded chicken and chicken sausages. Highly recommended. 

7. Aglio olio with prawns : Spaghetti with prawns. Another favourite from the menu! The quantity of shrimps in the dish will make you scream in happiness. 

8. Tiramisu : The perfect dessert for people who doesn't like it too sweet. Very tasty.

9. Decadent mousse cake : If you don't have this,it will be a regret. This is one of the best dark chocolate mousse cakes that I ever had.
Washed down these with mixed fruit mojito and watermelon mojitos. 

The service was perfect and the staff were very friendly. Amazing experience overall.

My Big Fat Belly is one of those places which makes you come back for more, time and time again.

This was my second time, here's what all I had:



1. Mixed Fruit Mojito - Served in a Jar, ideal drink for the summers.

2. Cheese Cigars - Definitely recommended. The photo should say it all. The melted cheese inside takes the cake!

3. Stuffed Signature Garlic Bread - Not your usual garlic bread, this is different and worth a try!

4. Bacon wrapped Prawns - The combination is deadly, and this place makes it deadlier! 

5. Mushroom Bruschetta - One of the best in town eclipsing age old favourites of the city! If you're looking for some not so unhealthy option, you know what to choose.


6. Crumb Fried Chicken Burger - This was awesome. It was large and filling. The crumb fried chicken inside was crispy and fried to perfection.

7. Walk Down Chowringee - A fish burger to say the least, the dish was presented with crunchy, onion rings on top. Please note that the fries that came with the burgers were different than your usual fries. I am sure you'd like it. 

8. Formaggio - A pizza made up of 6 different varieties of cheese! For Pizza lovers who love their cheese, your God is this! I will just leave it here. 

9. Aglio Olio with Shrimps - Really really nice, and the amount of shrimps they give is lovely! You would be satiated.

Coming to the desserts, you should try Mango Cheesecake, Tiramisu & the Chocolate Mousse Cake! They are perhaps one of the best in the city! Don't miss the desserts when you come here!

Went there today with a bunch of friends and boy I fell in love with the place. Our order was extensive and it included the following - 
1. Watermelon Mojito- A sweet refreshing drink with chunks of watermelon and ice. This red drink is visually very appealing and I am sure any watermelon lover would love this. 

2. Mixed Fruit Mojito (recommended) - This one is my favourite. Taste-wise I found it better than the watermelon one. This wasn't too sweet nor too tangy. It had the perfect balance of every flavour. ‚ô• 

3. Cheese Cigars (recommended) - it was the best start to the food journey there. The cheesy goodness of this dish made me fall for it. Such a simple dish yet so amazing! ‚ô• 

4. Stuffed Signature Garlic Bread  (recommended) - garlic bread had never been this good. Do try this when you visit. It will make you want for some more ‚ô• 

5. Bacon wrapped Prawns (recommended) - what can go wrong with bacon and prawns together. It was just yummy-licious ‚ô•Ô∏è

6. Mushroom Bruschetta (recommended) - this was heavenly. It was so tasty that I can bet every non-vegetarian would choose this if there's an option between this and another non-veg bruschetta. It was heavenly. ‚ô• 
There was a tomato variant too but I didn't try them so can't comment on the taste.  

7. Murg - e-Azam - Barbecued chicken with tomato, shredded lettuce and mayo. It was healthy and tasted good. 

8. Crumb Fried Chicken Burger (recommended) - the burger was awesome. It was large and filling. The crumb fried chicken inside was crispy and very very tasty ‚ô• 

9. Walk Down Chowringee (recommended) - the dish was presented in a unique way with onion rings on top. It is a fish burger and it was super tasty. The crumb fried fish was crispy and tasty. It was served with french fries. ‚ô•Ô∏è

10. Chickennora (recommended) - this is a chicken lover's pizza. It is a  huge thin crust pizza with ample chicken toppings. It is one of the best pizzas I have ever had. ‚ô• 

11. Formaggio (recommended) - an authentic cheesy pizza which is definitely gonna remind you of Joey's pizza from friends. It was finger-licking go. It is a must try for everyone. ‚ô• 

12. Shroomy with Chicken (recommended) -  penne pasta in white sauce with chicken and mushroom. It was creamy and amazingly tasty ‚ô• 

13. Aglio Olio with Shrimps -  my least favourite dish from yesterday's lunch though my fellow foodies loved it. The taste didn't quite appeal to me. 

14. Sundried Tomato and Chilli Risotto with Grilled Chicken - again this dish disappointed me a little. I found it to be too tangy for my liking. 

15. Mango Cheesecake - can't comment since I am a non-lover of mango. My fellow foodies loved it so I guess mango lovers should give it a try. 

16. Tiramisu (recommended) - It was very good. ‚ô• 

17. Chocolate Mousse Cake (recommended) - the lunch could not have ended on a better note. It was pure heaven. Please do try this dessert when you visit. You can't help but ask for a second serving I bet. ‚ô• 

The portions were amazing and the tastes are awesome. This is one of the best food joints in Kolkata right now and I can bet this place can never disappoint any food lover. Keep it up guys. Will surely visit again ‚ô•

Located right opposite to Dugout in Sarat Bose Road, this indeed is a very happy place. Had been in the bucket list for long and finally got to visit here with a group of seven people.
A glimpse of all that we ordered:

Beginning with the Watermelon Basil Mojito and Mixed fruit mojito. The latter tasted heavenly. 

For starters,
Greek Salad with chicken.
Cheese cigars- gooey cheesy and absolutely amazing.
Stuffed signature garlic bread- quite a different presentation and tasted out of the world. And when I say that for garlic bread, it definitely was out of the world.
Bacon wrapped prawn- the best in town. No other words.
Bruschetta platter- mushroom and tomatoes.

Main course, ftw:
Murg-e -Azam - chicken tikka burger for the better.
Walk from chowringhee- crumb fried fish basically, I could have it all day. 
Chickennora pizza.
Formaggio pizza.
Sundried tomato n chilly risotto with grilled chicken. 
Aglio olio with prawn- again, one of the best.

And for desserts: 
Chocolate Mousse cake, cannot forget the taste of this. Loved it.
Tiramisu- quite a good one.

We were very happy with the service, quick and helpful. I will never stop praising the dishes we had today, you really need to check it our for yourself.

Expected the place to be bigger...  but it did surprise me with the good quality food... the Menu is pretty good with good options for vegetarians as well. The star of the night was the cold coffee which was very well made, one of the best I have had at a restaurant. The mixed fruit mojito was awesome.
Coming to the food the juicy Lucy burger was lip smacking with the right amounts of toppings with the patty... it did do justice to its name... a place I will definitely go again to try the other items... the only feedback I would have is maybe some of the staff need some training on the menu and the rice on the side of the fish that I ordered was dry as wood... but the fish and gravy was good enough for my wife to forget about the rice!!! 
A very nice small joint for good food and fun!!! It was good to see the owner to take feedback from customers directly!!! I suggest you give some training to Keventers for the shakes you make!!! Awesome!!!

The first thing that you notice when you enter the place is the neatly done interiors, which give you the feel of a lady's touch. Then you meet the wonderful host and and you know the reason why you feel so welcome here. We went to this place on a busy puja day, exhausted and famished. I had a burger for myself and snatched a few bites from my friends' plates. The food is delicious. Although service could be a tad bit quicker. Would love to go back with my better half

Located just opposite to The Dugout at Bhawanipur, this place is not too spacious but this place is well lit and cosy. The burgers here are to die for. We started with the Virgin mojito which was refreshing and the butterscotch shake which I didn't really enjoy. However the burgers were too good. Juicy, tender and well done. Served with fries and coleslaw, I had the Ultimate Juicy Lucy Lamb burger with bacon. I loved it. Definitely going back to try more.

Before visiting Kolkata I searched on places to eat there and saw my big fat belly as suggestion by a lot of people!! Considering the reviews I decided to go there and I'm glad I did! Apart from the drinks music and ambience I absolutely loved the food there and considering I'm from delhi I have quiet rich taste buds. I orders the spicy juicy lamb burger and it was by far one of the best I have ever had. Apart from this I also ordered their bacon bomb and tiramisu and it was equally scrumptious! To top the experience the hospitality was amazing! It's a must visit and I'm sure and will alway hang out at this place during all my visits to Kolkata!

Ordered home delivery of watermelon & orange salad served with foccacia bread, as per the menu. The person who took the order informed that they will give garlic bread instead of foccacia. The salad was delivered without any bread. On enquiring with restaurant they said they do not serve any bread with the salad. It's really sad that the guy taking the order and also the menu speaks otherwise. Even the quantity of the salad they give in packing is far less than what is served at the restaurant. Will never order again from MBFB. Very unexpected and disappointing.

Me and my friend wanted to go to this place since a long time as we both stay in different cities and not in kolkata so when we both were in kolkata we found this place extremely fascinating though the place is a little small and we had to wait for approximately half an hour to get a table and there was no waiting area as well but when we ordered our food came really fast and I was very happy with the food. We had ordered brownie shake and kiwi frappe which was damn nice and totally worth waiting! Then we had ordered for starters which were probably cheese cigars which were amazing. Then we ordered a gardeniere pizza and a paneer satay from which I remember. Both were lip smacking and amazing. Overall I loved the whole little cute place to eat at and the food was also too good.

This restaurant My big fat belly is located right at the busiest point of South kolkata, Bhawanipur, this place sees most traffic in the city being a hustling junction and a connector. This area is over populated with cafes, restaurants and pubs as one of the most important education centre is located nearby, which caters to the running of each of this places more or less successfully. Coming back to our concerned joint, this is a European stylised cafe-cum-restaurant which serves great fast food and full course meals. They have tied up with food delivery apps owing to which food is being delivered to places situated in a close proximity of 3 to 4 kms of the place. They have a pre plated service concept, where the portion size is more than enough for one person.
                                                                ...

Amazing decor packed with people....Few foods included in menu card were not available..The burger was yummy bt the pasta was less in quantity and was lacking a flavour....I think they should add more food option in menu card.options are less.. will visit the place  again and hope next time it will match my expectations.

First of all, sorry about the pic. Had to steal it from the insta story. 
Alright now. The place itself is fairly small. I didn't like the way AC's are set up, regardless of where u sit, they will blow thay cold air straight to your face, now this could get annoying when you trying to enjoy a hot burger or pizza or any food for that matter. Service was right on par, no complains In that area. Drinks is something I can't talk about as we only ordered basic ice teas which were fine. 

I ordered the juicy juce chicken burger with added bacon which was satisfactory, the flavour was good, caramelized onions did the trick. Cheese was perfectly melted, buns were warm and soft which is how they should be. The taste texture were spot on. It definitely had a good flavour. But it wasn't really mouth watering. 

Now, my friend ordered the grilled chicken burger with bacon. I took a bite from this burger and instantly could say that this burger was definitely more of my choice. Too bad that I didn't order it. Anyways next time. But this burger had grilled chicken, egg fried, bacon and veggies which were perfectly laid out between the buns. The burger is definitely massive in size. It however is on the plain side of flavour, not a massive on the flavour side but still a good tasting flavour. 

Overall I would say for the price, this place is a wicked place!! Definitely a must go for burgers!

This place is nothing short of amazing. The food is delicious, and the ambience makes you feel like waiting and enjoying the place. The server's are very cordial, and accommodate requests. The only reason for 4 star, is cause, I ordered mac cheese, without olives but it was served with olives. So I had to get it changed.

Absolutely love love love this one, from its location to food to service everything is just perfect. The staff here is very warm and the hospitality will attract you right at the beginning. Located very near home has made me a frequent visitor here. Their skrewers are very good and so are their non-veg platters. The pitchers of Mohitos are pretty good and economical. The best part is that its pricing is reasonable and will be easy on your wallet. The only minus is the place is too small and gets filled very fast as a result.¬†

I had

Orange juice wid blast of cinnamon üçπ , this went perfectly well with

Al pachino pizza üçï , which came as a thin crust 8sliced pizza, looked authentic and tasted amazing

Chiken mac and cheese üçùwas ordered after it, and tasted equally amazing. They served it with complementary garlic bread .

Mango cheese cake üç∞( day's special) just melted in my mouth..... and i need not say more!

The service was very friendly.üëçüëç
I am sure to visit this place once more, to try out their risottos and steaks .

Very poor food. Tastes very very bad. We ordered more than 5 items, none good at all except the pasta. The orange-ginger mojito was good. Sorry management. This was a bad experipience for me. Please improve the Calypso Pizza, Herb Fried chicken and Russian Mafia. Maybe we should have tried some other stuffs. But these were very very bad in taste.

Great food, great service. Enjoyed the chicken wings with mayo and the staff clearly took care of the request to make it less spicy than usual. Their pizzas are really good. In particular, the formaggio had a perfectly thin crust and loads of stringy cheese, topped with tomatoes. The bacon bomb was a winner, and every element, even the sauteed vegetables, tasted perfect. Prices are more or less reasonable, too.

Finally visited this much reviewed place on 02/06/2017.  Very cozy place always crowded. Had to wait 20 minutes to get a table. 

The lovely lady who greeted us, also the owner recommended a few dishes. She appeared really proud of her little restaurant. 

The staff were very slow in clearing the tables. 
The pictures fail to depict how small the place really is. 
We wanted to try the Bologna pizza but they didn't have it, so we opted for Calypso (4/5). Good amount of toppings and perfect thin crust pizza. 

The herb chicken (full) had 6 tasty pieces of fried chicken. On the side was a little amount of fries and dip. The coleslaw supposed to be served with it wasn't there. We didn't notice early because we're famished. (3.5/5) 

Other than that we ordered regular balisma fries, which never arrived and when brought notice of the server he said it's getting made. Another 15 minutes passed and when we asked again, same reply. So we cancelled that. 

Lemon iced tea (3.5/5) refreshing and good quantity. 

Despite asking them to adjust the AC, not sure what they did but the AC above us wasn't working much. 

It appears I'm among the handful of people who have given this a below 4 rating. 

I would love to visit and hopefully see improvement in their service later on in better weather.

We stepped in here on a sweltering May afternoon. The place was nearly packed and I found the room to be a little cramped. We started off with a ginger beer (from the specials written on the blackboard, I think). It tasted really refreshing and just the perfect amount of gingery. Next we ordered the Americano, a pepperoni pizza based on the waiter's recommendations. I had come here hearing very good things about their pizza and it just fell a little short of expectations. Pretty good pizza, lot better than your run-of-the-mill dominoes and pizza Hut but nothing really mind-blowing about it. We also ordered the seafood pasta in arrabiata sauce. It had more than adequate amount of seafood in it but tasted very average. I had my mind set on the mango cheesecake (from the specials menu) but we were informed that it was not available. :)

My big fat belly lived up to my expectation as far as the taste of the food is concerned. Had heard a lot about this place and the food were worth trying. We had pasta, sandwich, chicken steak, soup and dessert.¬†
The main issue with this place is that they believe in small. The place is small and during the rush hour it faces problem in accommodating people. also, the food portions are also small. So, sharing will be a bit difficult.
The staffs are always ready to help.
P.S...enter the washroom by looking at the mirror...lol

With such high ratings. We payed a visit to this place. Small cramped, very bad seating arrangement. We sat on the table just infront of the stairs and I was asked by the waiters to move twice, I repeat twice. The service is a joke. The waiters were busy talking among themselves rather catering the customer. Anyways we ordered 1 Green Apple Iced Tea and 1 Ginger Ale (from the speicals menu), Ginger Ale was supposed to be fizzy and not a plain Ginger Lemonade, it was disappointing. The for the Main Course 1 Carbonara, 1 Chicken Skewer and 1 Grilled Chicken burger. We were 3 and all of us mentioned the waiter to serve the food together. First comes the Carbonara which again was fine, it's not authentic like none of the places in Kolkata has one. The Grilled Chicken Burger was fine, my friend added Sauted Mushrooms to it and the mushrooms were not seasoned.The  best part was the time gap. There was a solid 22mins time gap between them. Then, came the Kabab skewers after 32mins since we recieved Carbonara and it makhni sauce lacked flavour it has intense paprika notes. And despite mentioning the food to be delivered all together they gave us food in such delay. Confronting the staff they said that it's not in their control Grill takes time. Everyone knows grills take time so cook the pasta later. All together the experience was NO GOOD. I would really suggest the management to have a look. And with so many good reviews you guys must have done something right, so it is possible something went wrong. But, I guess you guys should surprise I'm always open to change reviews.

I heard a lot about this place from my friends, however it failed to meet my expectations. The place is located in Sarat Bose Road. Decor was comfortable and rustic. The food was average. The serving time was way to long. And last but not the least, the service was merely average.

After reading so many positive reviews of this place, we finally decided to give this place a try. We were a bit disappointed once we were inside the place - we were expecting a larger place, something like SpiceKraft. The tables and chairs were quite high - the chairs had the height of bar stool chairs. Anyway, we ordered a pitcher of Mixed Fruit Mojito, Bellisma Fries, and Chicken Wings with medium spiciness. The Mixed Fruit Mojito was enough for three of us, and had floating chunks of fruits; it was quite soothing after that assault on the palate from the Chicken Wings. The Fries and the Wings arrived simultaneously, and they had a very light garlic flavoured mayo (or maybe aioli) and Pico de gallo as accompaniments. Unfortunately, as they arrived all together, we couldn't tell which accompaniment was paired with which dish.

The Bellisma Fries were quite good, with a lot of molten cheese squirted on the top of the fries. Definitely more flavourful than regular fries.

The chicken wings were succulent and spicy. The heat of the ghost pepper is not immediately noticeable. It's not like our Bengali green chillies. But the heat sneaks up on you. By the time you'll gorge on the third chicken wing, you'll be craving for that sip of your drink. A note - if you don't have a secret death wish, don't even think of trying their Beat the Ghost challenge. You'll need to get your stomach pumped.

For main course, we had Herb Fried Chicken, Grilled Chicken Steak with Red wine and Rosemary sauce, and Grilled Fish in Gondhoraj Chilly Lemon Creme.

The Herb Fried Chicken was quite nice. It unfortunately didn't come with coleslaw, but with french fries. The best thing about it was that it was completely devoid of oil, in spite of being properly cooked. The batter was crunchy and the chicken was soft and properly seasoned.

The Grilled Steak was awesome, and the sauce is one of the best I've ever had. It has a robust flavour that is characteristic of Rosemary perfectly balanced with the acidity of the wine. It was, in one word, beautiful.

However, the Grilled Fish was the best dish among the three. The fish was perfectly cooked, soft and deboned. The sauce was creamy and was a perfect foil for that fish. One word of warning, though. The fish had the typical fishy smell, which is expected. Unfortunately, some of us expect the fish to be absolutely odourless, which this is not. If you love fish, you will love this dish. Otherwise, stay away from this item.

The ambiance was quite lovely, and was perfect for clicking photos. The service was prompt, and they even helped me charge my cellphone.

A rare 5/5 from me.

Well well boys and girls.. ¬†This is the place where you should be if you are a non Hookah lover like me.. One of the coziest and best place I have ever been in Kolkata. Hands down it's food and ambience deserves applaud.

This place is small and with small I here mean literally very small. Its located opposite to Dugout on Sarat Bose Road. ¬†It has a seating space for 25 people with an open drinks counter where all the mocktails and shakes are prepared. We went there on a Saturday afternoon and had to wait for 20 mins in order to get a table. So it's better if you start a little earlier if you are planning to visit soon. As per the owner, in evenings usually the waiting time is more than 45 mins. Now that's interesting. Right?

Now lets come towards food,

*Garlic Bread - Bang for the Buck! 4 pcs for just Rs.69. Tasted great as well! [4/5]
*Gooey Cheese Cigar Rolls - The most awesome preparation in my whole experience. It tastes heavenly.. Six pieces are served in the full portion and is priced at just Rs.199 [5/5]
*Gardinere Pizza - The regular thin crust which cafes usually offer. Well prepared, though a bit extra olive oil was used. [4/5] Price - Rs.319
*Nachos (Paneer Khurchan) - Tasted good but if I visit next time I am gonna opt for regular ones. Since toppings on Nachos kinda ruins the experience. [4/5] Price - Rs.209
*Mixed Sauce Pasta - Good preparation! [4/5] Price - Rs.269
*Strawberry Shake - Extra sweet! :( The major loss! [2.5/5] Price - Rs.129
*Squidgy Brownie Shake - Good. The quantity of brownie could increase! [3.5/5] Price - Rs.139
*Oreo and Cream Shake - Great! They even offered us an extra oreo biscuit when we asked for it! [4/5] Price - Rs.129
*Ginger Orange Mojito - Though it is priced the least, it tasted the best! [5/5] Price - Rs.89

VAT - 14.5% | Service Tax - 6%

Our total bill was Rs.1869.

The staff here was polite and the owners were really courteous.

Suggestions: Don't forget to have Cigar Cheese Rolls, Pizza, Pasta and Ginger Orange Mojito.

Looking forward to visit again!

The food itself is fantastic. I've had their pizzas and burgers on a few occasions, and I've found them delicious on each occasion I've eaten at this restaurant. It's a small place, but with such superb food, one doesn't really mind. However, I do wish they had more Mexican dishes, as I really miss the previous establishment at this location - The Little Donkey. They've done a good job though.

It was just one of those weekends when we took an off from school and watched Bahubali 2. We were famished when we reached there and we were very lucky to get a table quick. Though I had heard a lot about the place, but the crowd seating space was a bit of a downer as we were a group of 7 people. As usual the onus of ordering came to me and we ordered veg nachos, bellisima fries, gooey cheesy cigars,herb fried chicken, chicken sausage and an iced tea pitcher, brownie shake( which was fabulous) and a red bull drink. All of which came fast and hot and everything was scrumptious. Special mention to the sausages as they were among the best sausages I have eaten till date. It was their in-house concoction and an absolute must try. We even ate all the dips that came with the food. Nachos,cigars and fries were all cheesy and gooey an loaded with chosen toppings and the chicken was crispy and surprisingly not oily. Then came main course with the pastas and the burgers and they were great too. All in all we did come out of the place with a big fat belly that day.

Been there about a week back, recommended by a friend. Decor done in an innovative way which utilizes space in a unique manner - small round tables and high square tables coupled up with moderately comfortable chairs, dim lighting and a small long table and bar stools set up. The decor inside is very intelligently done and adds quite a quirk to the place - full of cheerful youngsters enjoying themselves. We had ordered a Grilled Chicken steak served with herbed rice - perfectly done and full of taste, Bacon bomb - again a winner in terms of taste, a grilled chicken skewers served with rice - again a winner in taste and an Orange mint cooler - not too impressive. So when it comes to food - there is total taste and finesse in quality, quantity and presentation. Coming to areas of improvement - the service was painfully slow, my little daughter was hungry and we had to wait for more than half an hour for a single dish to arrive. The service team wasnt warm - though the owner made up for it at the end as he generously asked for a feedback. The space is a little crammed, so with a family you cant sit for long. Overall a good experience , however , I deduct 1.5 points for the painfully slow service and the crammed space.

Long overdue but I believe this place deserves a review. MBFB popped up not too long ago and had a pretty exciting menu. I have a thing for burgers and kolkata has very limited options when it comes to good burger joints. Well, come along My Big Fat Belly! I've been here multiple times and every single thing I've ever eaten has been exquisite.

Pros:
1. Out-of-the-world burgers. Spectacular food in general. My favorites would be their in-house pork sausage preparations, juicy lucy, the burger with kosha mangsho reduction. I was skeptical about kosha mangsho with bacon, but it was heaven melting in my mouth. Their fondue platter is a monstrosity in its size, and absolutely delicious. In fact, their entire winter menu <3
Also, one of the best cheesecakes I've had here.

2.The decor is just quaint, hep, and very cozy. Love the interiors. It has a very rustic, traditional all American pub feel to it.

3. The staff is courteous, they keep checking in to see if we are enjoying and if everything is up to the mark. The host is a wonderful guy too, he has come up to us each time and exchanged pleasantries.

4. The service is prompt and sharp. 

5. The price! Compared to the quality of the food provided, it's quantity and in comparison to similar establishments, the price is a delight.

Cons:

1. No booze. This place would have been just perfect if they served alcohol.

2. I'm not a fan of their mocktails. It'd be nice if they upped their beverage options. 

This has quickly become a favorite for me in kolkata and would always be my go-to place.

Location: It is located opposite Dugout in bhawanipur 

Visited this place with my school friends .. surely you can get the best burgers in the city of joy.. 
Coming to food we opted for : 

Refreshments:
 Kiwi frappe: it was really refreshing and it's perfect on a sunny day. 

Chocolate oreo shake: it was more like bournvita but it was really good with a Oreo topped on it.

Strawberry frappe: it was very good in taste and treat to your eyes for sure which was also topped with a marshmallow.

Solid gulps:
The Great Aggarwalji Burger
Czar's Turkish Cottage Cheese Burger
Crumb Fried Chicken Burger
Grilled Chicken Burger


That's all with my great experience with My BFB ..
All the burgers tasted great with rich fillings.
HIGHLY RECOMMENDüòä

UPDATED REVIEW: Ok so the Caesar Salad debacle appears to have been a bad day in the MBFB kitchen, because the very generous owner of the restaurant resent the dish a few days ago and this time it was perfect! So I'm happy to revise my review & rating. Still 1 star less because I really feel that it shouldn't take a bad review to bring out the best service in any establishment.¬†

OLD REVIEW:
                        Ordered a Caesar salad for delivery. Quantity was pathetic, like half of a standard size. ¬†Quality was ok. Not impressed. I'd heard good reviews about this place but I'm quite disappointed.

A restaurant which is highly recommended with a variety of dishes! The gooey cheese cigars are a must try and one just can't get enough of it! For all the mushroom lovers out there the shroomy pasta is a must try, it is absolutely delicious and one of the best I have had yet‚ù§Ô∏è
We had ordered the Juicy Burger which was pretty good to taste and we had ordered the Hotty Betty Pizza which did not really match our expectations as it was a bit oily due to which not very good to taste. We had tiramisu and brownies with ice cream for dessert which was pretty good! 
Apart from the pizza each and every dish which we ordered like garlic bread and Arabiatta Pasta  were delicious. 
My Big Fat Belly is a place where I would love to go again and again. It is like the perfect place for my big fat belly and would recommend everyone to visit this place ‚ù§Ô∏è

.My Big Fat Belly.

A restaurant you can recommend to your friends, family and even strangers‚Ä¶trust me you‚Äôll get a lot of blessings. For me this place is the cheapest ticket to American style food in a town where the only thing you get in the name of American cuisine is a potato patty burger. The potential of this place to satisfy your hunger as well as your belly is through the roof. No wonder it is prevailing on Zomato with a 4.5 overall rating.

Located bang opposite to The Dugout, the owners have smartly picked the best possible location for their restaurant. It‚Äôs not a complete family diner and thus gives them the advantage to host a lot of teenage crowd in an area where youngsters flock in numbers.
There is a big neon brand board at the fa√ßade, much like the motels on American highways. Step in and you are welcomed by rustic interiors with dim lighting just as you would find in a casual American caf√© (damn I missed the chilled beer). Spread over a confined space, there is a 20-soul seating capacity. The seating has been arranged smartly to utilize maximum possible area but that makes it hard to accommodate larger groups of people (say 6+).

The service is consistent and sharp. Attending to tables and keeping a regular check to ensure the guests are enjoying themselves. Hugely impressed by this place and will surely be back for more.

Check out my blog for a wholesome experience.¬†
Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.¬†

¬†And Be Suavy !!

Intrigued by the name, we decided to drop by this place on a hot and humid Saturday summer evening.After a shopping spree, we landed here at 8.00 pm.The location is exactly the Sarat Bose crossing, opposite to another popular eatery "The Dugout".Well the place was full to the brim, and we had to sit at the waiting area for quite some time.The place seemed to be a regular with the hep gastronomic crowd of the city and as we waited¬†with the menu card in our hands, we couldn't stop drooling as the smell of pizza, burgers started filling our souls.After 20 mins of a hungry wait..we got our seats.The place is pretty small with a simple yet classy decor.The buzz of the crowd around dimmed yellow light and just the right dose of music creates a great ambiance.We ordered the Al Pacino pizza and the Juicy Lucy(captivating names).As for coolers, we ordered the ginger orange mojito( a supreme delicacy to beat the heat) and the Kiwi mocktail(which was not much of a delicacy, as it reeked with the taste of rock salt). Food arrived pretty early and it was awesome with a capital A.The juicy lucy was really a succulent platter of meat and bacon with a right dose of cheese and served with french fries and mayo.But the pizza was the one which you muuuusssssstttt and i mean muuuussssst try out.Thin crust, with a kind helping of cheese , chicken and an assortment of bell papers and veggies.Food for the soul as my friend exclaimed.We definitely plan many future visits.p.s.The belly crew was prompt, decent and kind!Sathi Chakraborty¬†!

We had heard a lot of good things about this joint and  decided to pay a visit on a particularly hot afternoon. This is in the same place as 'The Little Donkey' which was a good place too. A very laid back feel is evident all around and the staff were happy enough to let us cool off for a while we waited for our late lateef friend to arrive. 
Finally we got around to ordering the drinks - a green apple iced tea, a California cinnamon blast and a oreo shake. The iced tea was too sweet and the cinnamon drink too overpowering. 
For the food we had a Russian Mafia sub, a Grilled Chicken burger with bacon, a Casanova sub and Auntie Annie's Alfredo pasta. Also accompanying these was a portion of Panko Fried Tiger Prawns. The burger was something out of this world. The right combination of cheese, fried egg, a juicy patty and of course, bacon makes up this sumptuous burger. However the Fried Tiger prawns were a loss of money, costing waaay too much. The pasta was superb, lots of flavour and a creamy, cheesy texture ticking all the right boxes. The Casanova sub deserves a special mention, awesome mix of the sausage and cheese and tomatoes makes it a delectable choice. The Russian mafia sub was also a winner in its own right.

Pros : 
The dishes were extremely well presented.
The Lamb Shank was extremely meaty and the Mashed Potatoes were silky smooth. The Chicken Steak also tasted wonderful.
The staff were EXTREMELY courteous.
The food was very cheap.
The ambience had a nice retro look to it.

Cons :
The order took a VERY long time to arrive.
A few of the items such as Stuffed Chicken Steak and Bacon Bomb were not available.
The cutlery were extremely grimy and we had to ask for a change.

BFB is like my Second home now , we are welcomed with so much of warmth and ever smiling faces . Each and every dish that we have tried here is excellent. Tastewise, presentability , all are superb! We recently hosted a party at our place and our main course was ordered from BFB . Our friends simply loved the food especially risotto and gnnnochi. Thank you Akaarsh Bhargava and entire team BFB for superb  food and warmth.üòäüòä

Bhawanipur, genuinely floored me with a destination which I definitely want to visit once again. If possible, right now.. üôÇ üôÇ When you are craving for a luncheon, a small cozy cafe with good food is enough to calm your foodie soul. That destination no doubt matches my identity ‚Äì ‚ÄúMy Big Fat Belly‚Äú.

Lets be a tad technical on this one. The old school way. The goods the bads and the uglys maybeüòõ

Decor and Interior - Crampy coz of the area of the place. Obviously they tried to accomodate max seating which gave the place a crampy pub feel.

Hospitality - The people who runs the place were quite interactive with each and every guest and were smoothly personalizing them. It gives u a feel that u are a regular there. Thumbs up for that.

Food - Kiwi Frappe was quite good. I dont remember seeing this item on any other menu. It was a first timer for me. Grilled Fish in Gondhoraj Lemon Cr√©me and BFG Non Veg Platter was filling and classic steakhouse material. 

Value for money - All of the above in 1000/- bucks. Decide for yourself. üòÉ

Only if the area was bigger. This brand has the potential to make it big. Go for it guys. üëçüèΩ

My husband and I wanted to try a new place and hence ended up at this very quaint but fantastic place for a Saturday dinner. The place was jam packed but we luckily got a table in 10 minutes.

We ordered a Calypso pizza, bfb non veg grill platter and mango cheese cake (images attached). We had seen the photos of the fondue on Zomato and Facebook and had really wanted to order it, sadly that's available only in winters. The prawn cocktail tart and chicken Sharma too couldn't be ordered as they weren't available. The pizza was extremely juicy and crunchy and the platter was extremely filling and yum. The mango cheesecake was nice but I think I should have ordered the squidgy brownie shake instead.

Lastly, what seemed to us to be the owner and his mother, came to check on us more than once and that felt really nice. All in all a pretty good experience. Will surely go back there soon.

Should I say Kolkata needs more places like this??
They are open till 1:30. I was craving for some desserts and my friend was craving for food but we wanted to go to some new place, came across big Fat belly and yes they did make our belly fat because we hogged till 1:45. Kind staff didn't throw us out. We eat and they smiled that we are enjoying. They have some lip smacking Burger's. I took a bit to taste but I continued eating till I finished. Poor friend of mine. So please go enjoy eat and make your belly fat.

1st June is my second visit to this place and it is my birthday. And they are so sweet enough to get me a cake and play amazing birthday tracks for me. So grateful and thankful.. Really thank you for making my day so beautiful..

One of the best American restaurants in Kolkata in a reasonable price and very lovely food . Pleasing ambiance and very polite staffs . The owner himself came and asked about how the food was . We were hungry and jumped right into burgers . We ordered Juicy lucy burger and the Czars cottage cheese burger . Both were quite juicy and well seasoned . ¬† Fries were crispy , ¬†For desserts we ordered the MAngo Cheesecake . It was simply exquisite .

But but after having food you'll forget everything. We ordered Craz turkish cheese burger, The ultimate juicy lucy n Mango cheese cake. Burgers were served with coleslaw  n french fries..no doubt taste was really good with lots of caramelised onions, pickle... chicken was quite juicy n tender so also the cottage cheese.. And last mango cheese cakeüòçüòç ... it was creamy, little bit sour n sugary.. in short became my fvrt dessert. It's definitely must visit restaurant for American Italian food lovers. üòäüòäüòä

During my recent visit to Kolkata I went to this place as I had heard from many people that it's one of the new places in town and is one of the best! And It did live up to its expectation. The ambience, scrumptious food, music everything was just perfect. There was nothing I could complain of. I had their grilled chicken burger and I must say it's one of the best I have ever had! The staff was just amazing. Courteous, humble, prompt they definitely know how to make their guest happy. It's a must must visit if you are in Kolkata! Great going team my big fat belly!

Good ambience, comfy yet quirky seating.

We ordered for a meat pizza, grilled chicken burger and choco decadent mousse cake.

You know a food joint is super awesome,  when the sides with ur mains are prepped with equal love and care and attention. 

The coleslaw with the burger was crunchy and fresh. The burger itself was melt in the mouth. The pizza was a meat lover's heaven. And that choco decadent mousse cake was the icing on the top,  was finished in a matter of seconds!!! 

Kudos to the team!!

Just my tastebuds had an incredible experience at BFB when i visited it on Tuesday. It was a sudden plan and after a tiresome shopping we ended up to this small eatery which i found really cute. We ordered Al-Pachino, a brownie shake and later cheese cigars. Starting with Bellizzaa Al pachino was one of the best thin crust pizza that i had in a while and then their brownie shake (who's name I kinda have forgotten üòÖ) was also incredible but the cheese cigars were just normal nothing outstanding in compared to their other two items that we had ordered. The prices were also reasonable and not that hard on the pocket as well so that's another plus point. Definitely going there again soon.

Went there after watching the DD vs KKR match at Eden Gardens. Reached there around 8. Had to wait for over 40 mins to get a seat. 
Ordered the pepperoni pizza with extra cheese and chicken burger with extra bacon. 
Both the dishes were great. 
During that time their machine was down and they were making hand written bills so by mistake they charges us more with two shakes which we never ordered. I found out last week but I get it was kinda our fault as never went through the bill and paid whatever was asked to.

So I have been here twice and not once it has disappointed me. It's located just opposite Dugout in Sarat Bose Road. It's name atop is fashioned in an innovative way with light bulbs. Inside, it's a compact place, perfect for small groups but congested for large groups. However, the special thing about it is its burger (as the name suggests). 
Coming to the food, it has some lip-smacking & mouth watering burger items which one can't miss ordering. I had Gooey cheesy cigars to start with. Cheese was gooey and delicious. Shroominator burger is a total delight for mushroom lovers. I loved it. BFB Mac N Cheese is something you won't get in every place. It's different and quite fantastic. 
The interiors are good and the place feels cozy. It's definitely a must visit for fast food lovers and Italian lovers.

A much awaited visit to this restaurant left me a bit disappointed. After a long wait for 40mins outside in d heat, when finally I got a table it was very small for the four of us. Also it was a bit sticky, not properly cleaned. The staff were okay but there's always a room for improvement.
But the food was a pure gastronomical delight. The BFB Bruschetta platter was awesome. Fromaggio pizza was cheesy thin crust & totally yummy. The herb fried chicken & Keema Canneloni was also not bad. The Shroomy (sea food pasta) was out of this world.
With our big fat bellies didn't have much room for anything else. Oh! The mojitos were very ordinary & so was the Butter scotch caramel milk shake.
The best part is that the price was extremely reasonableüòä

Visited this place a month back. The ambience is welcoming. I did not like the seating arrangement. The chairs were too tall. I get that it is part of the aura of the restaurant but it didn't suit me. I was a little uncomfortable in the way I was seated. But that can be ignored. The staff was alright, they could work on their response time.
We ordered BFB Special Chicken Wings in Ghost Chili Sauce Medium. It is advertised to be super spicy but that disappointed me. I didn't find it spicy at all. And the sauce itself could be improved upon. We should have tried the next level. Maybe next time.
We ordered Lamb Chops with BFB Sauce, their highly recommended Bacon Bomb, and their daily special Lamb Shank. 
My main dish was the Lamb Chops which I loved but the sauce was a little over the top and turned out it wasn't to my liking but I would definitely try the red wine sauce next time. The quantity of meat  I was great and it was very soft. The bacon Bomb was as good as people said. The sauce was the same as the lamb chops, which was a turn off. But the soft bacon covering the masala pork was a marvel and I would recommend this to anyone coming here. Also, they could dial down on the quantity of sauce poured on the meat. The lamb shank was undoubtedly the best among the lot. The soft meat, the presentation, the sauce, everything was just perfect. A little low on the quantity of meat though. The sauce felt a little Indian, but it went very well with the dish.
The food was overall great, but there were places where they can work on, but this place is definitely worth trying out.
The only complaint I have is that the staff is very slow when it comes to producing the bill, which can get irritating.

It's easy to see the appeal of My Big Fat Belly once you step inside the caf√©. Quirky pictures on the wall and quirkier patterns on the walls and ceiling.
The food, I was really looking forward to their Panko fried prawn and the prawn tarts, however, both were unavailable at the time. That was a big disappointment.
Anyway, we ordered the herb fried chicken, juicy Lucy (chicken), cold coffee, pasta arabiatta and the choco decadent mousse. While the starter, drinks and dessert were top notch, the main courses unfortunately fell a little short, especially the pasta.
Anyway, we did end up leaving with a big fat belly.

Size S or Size L, you'll grow a big fat belly overnight if you drop by this place. 
Definitely Kolkata's most trending restaurant since a good one year and here are a couple of dishes that they are known for. 
Bellisma Fries Paneer Khurchan- delicious dish with fries and paneer smeared in cheese sauce. A total winner! 
Bruschetta- Another lovely dish topped with Shitake and Button Mushroom. 
Seven Heaven Cheese Pizza and Al Fungi Pizza- My taste buds was left pleased with the pizzas MBFB had to offer. Thin crust, cheesy- it couldn't have gotten better than that. 
Among their sweeter items, I thoroughly enjoyed having their mousse cake. Their Mango Cheese cake is also a wonderful selection for the summers. Another sweet item to go for would be their Tiramisu.

Finally ticked My Big Fat Belly off my wishlist and I am soooo happy!!! My belly and heart surely thanks My BFB for the awesome experience I had here. It's located bang opposite Dugout near Elgin Road. It's a small and cosy place. The ambience is quite warm. The restaurant was full even on a weekday evening so that's saying quite a lot already. Without any further ado, here's what me and my friends had from here:
*Watermelon and Cranberry Mojito, Flavoured Iced Tea and a Blueberry drink- Thumbs up to all of them
*Bellisma Fries with Masala Keema- Cheese+Keema+French Fries=üëå
*Bruschetta- it had mushrooms and tomatoes 
*Herb Fried Chicken- Total love ‚ù§
*Al Fungi Pizza, Chickennora Pizza, Seven Heaven Cheese Pizza- The pizzas here are AMAZING!!! The thinnest crust I have ever had anywhere. Crispy and flavourful,every single pizza was rocking! The seven heaven cheese pizza is a must try as it has many types of cheese on it and will surely take u to heaven üòçüòç
*El-Cubano Sandwich- Cuban sandwich with pork salami. It was tasty :-)
*Cheesy Garlic Bread- Garlic bread stuffed with gooey cheese AND topped with cheese üòçüòç
*Grilled Fish with Gondhoraj Herb Cream- The soft fish and the yummy gondhoraj flavoured cream paired very well together to make a great main course dish.
*Chicken Steak- Good portion of chicken with the best potato mash I have had in this city.
*Bacon Bomb- It was a beauty! This is something which you will not find anywhere else in this city as was told to us by the Chef and owner. Pork keema wrapped in bacon= Perfection!!
For dessert we had :
*Mango Cheesecake
*Mousse Cake
*Tiramisu
All of them were fabulous and are a must try!!!! Please go have them asap! I definitely was #bellified at My BFB and would recommend them highly to all my friends. #Foodgasm guaranteed üòÅ

When you meet your friends after a long time and want to spend an evening with lot of chit chats over food this place definitely suits our taste.

Located in bhawanipur just opposite to dugout.
It's a very small place and for some it might be difficult to locate specially in the evening.

The ambiance was good and with limited sitting arrangements.
The owners are two brothers and you will be touched by their hospitality.

The service was fast and helpful.

We ordered,

1. Masala keema Fries- french fries tossed with keema served in a iron cast pan topped with cheese and mayo.

2. Bruschetta- there were two kinds of bruschetta- served the classic tomato and cheese bruschetta- and another with mushroom.

3. Herb fried chicken.

4. Seven heaven pizza - it's something truly heavenly. Thin crust pizza with 7 different kinds of cheese. A must try.

5. Chickennora pizza- beautiful thin crust pizza with chunks of chicken and onion rings.

6. Al fungi

7. Grilled fish with gondhoraj herb cream- beautiful tender fish steak in gondhoraj herb cream sauce served with veggies and rice

8. Bacon Bomb - Now this is something remarkable.
Minced pork with herbs in the shape of a ball wrapped with bacon and grilled. Served with yummy sauce and rice.

9. El-cubano sandwich

10. Mango cheese cake- probably one of the mango cheese cake I ever had. And the mango flavour is on point.

11. Mousse cake

12. Tiramisu- dying to try out tiramisu for a long time now and am really really happy with the taste. the perfect blend coffee, rum and the mascapone cheese. Aah! Heavenly.
A must try.

Big bellies at the end of night? Hell yeah.

Cheers to team My BFB !

A quirky name, easy to locate restaurant being just opposite to the dugout - nearest metro station being rabindra sadan, an eye - catching interiors, comfortable seating arrangements, an ever smiling and courteous staff and an extremely friendly and polite chef Cum owner- that is My Big Fat Belly for you folks. You will probably end up with a belly once you are done with your meal, yes it is that gastronomically satisfying!
This place was on my bucket list for quite some time and i finally landed on its doorstep with my group of friends and what followed thereafter was magic to our eyes and stomach, literally! What we ordered :

1. Mixed fruit mojito, green apple ice tea, blackberry mojito, watermelon mojito - This place surely knows how to make its mojito's. It was smooth, not overly bitter, the balance between syrup and the soda was just perfect and they give proper attention to details as well such as the decoration, it looked visually attractive!. Go for the pitcher, it is very economical and is adequate for an entire group.
2. Bruschetta - The bread was mildly toasted to perfection with a adequate toppings of olives and mushrooms, not to forget, cheese too! Highly recommended.

3. Bellisma fries masala keema - Okhay so you loves fries? Let's try something new now? How about fries with mutton keema? Doesn't that sound delicious Already ? It tastes even better! The fries were hot and crispy and i am not a big fan of mutton but on second thoughts, i love mutton keema now after today's outing!

4. Herb fried chicken - Now i am very particular about my fried chicken and this one was really upto the mark, not overly fried and it retained that crunchy adage which we all seek when we order fried chicken. Highly recommended. Oh it comes with a mayo dip too!

5. Seven heaven cheese pizza - So love pizza's? Cheesy pizza's to be more specific? This one would be the perfect go to option for you. We were literally blown away by this particular dish. It consists of 7 different types of cheese being feta, ricotta, parmesan, cheddar, mozzarella and i was too busy eating to recollect the other two names.

6. Chickennora pizza - Loaded with chunks of chicken and cheese, the ultimate meat lovers paradise! With 8 big slices, the management really knows how to tap your taste buds without compromising on the quantity and quality.

7. Bacon bomb - This is their signature dish, and this particular dish stole the show for me. Served with a portion of rice and veggies, the portion of meat literally Is of the shape of a bomb, the outer coating being entirely of bacon whereas the the inside is filled with adequate quantity of well cooked minced masala pork. A must try and highly recommended.

8. El- cubano sandwich - Pork lovers out there , this one is meant for your taste buds! The bread was soft and the pork, it was something else literally, one of the best sandwiches i have had till now, excessively stuffed with pork ; comes with fries.

9. Grilled fish gondhoraj herb cream - Now grilled fish is not an easy dish to make, one expects it to be soft and tender and this dish was spot on in every department. It literally had me craving for more. It was unparalleled in taste and quality. Comes with a portion of rice and veggies.

10. Tiramisu - This is one desert i am definitely going to order In my next visit. After you gentle touch this little masterpiece, coffee oozes out of it, a visual treat followed by a gastronomical delight! Highly recommended.

11. Mango cheese cake - Really? Two of my favourites in one single cake? I thought they were joking till this sweet piece of masterpiece of a cake arrived. It was brilliant. One of the best cakes i have tasted till now.

12. Mousse cake - Fan of chocolates? You will love this one surely! We enjoyed it thoroughly! Every bite of was sheer delight!

I have never been much of a deserts person but this place has surely managed to change my opinion today! My big fat belly really raises the benchmark when it comes to dining and it surely knows how to make its diners happy by providing such quality food at reasonable rates.

My Big Fat Belly (the name forbodes your condition after repeat visits) located smack dab in the middle of the city has carved out a little niche for itself when it comes to serving eclectic and mouth-watering American fare.¬†

A quick chat with the Bhargava brothers is enough to help you gauge that they've put their heart and soul into MBFB, perfecting the minutiae of their offering. Right from the attention to detail of the retro American ambience with the quirky quotes and funky posters adoring the wall, to the quality of ingredients used in their dishes.¬†

I have visited their quaint little joint a handful of times and have sampled both their vegetarian fare as well as their meaty offerings. My two-cents on the dishes:

The Great Aggarwalji Burger: As the name suggests, the burger was crafted to suit the palate of the typical marwari seth, replete with a generous helping of "sanskaari Amul cheese" and the marwari staple, Aloo Bhujia to satiate the perennial craving. Overall, it was a matrimony between traditional home-made Aloo Tikia burger and the American way of munching.¬†

Czar's Turkish Cottage Cheese Burger: A must for the paneer lovers. Filled with well grilled paneer, generous helpings of in-house specialty sauces and a side of fries makes for a delectable offering that should satisfy most vegetarians.

The Ultimate Juicy Lucy Burger (Chicken): A fan favourite amongst burger lovers across the globe, the Juicy Lucy at MBFB does justice to the reputation of the burger. The caramalised onions and pickles add that extra zing to the taste which lingers for quite some time after you're done.

Gooey Cheese Cigars: As soon as you dig into these, you're greeted with an explosion of warm wonderfulness that is the gooey cheese. Paired with the Texan Mayo and a unique Strawberry Chilli Sauce, the cigar rolls make for an excellent appetizer to prepare you for the onslaught of the main course.¬†

The desserts were good, but nothing exceptional. The butterscotch shake was exceptional to taste - thick with dollops of thick cream. I am yet to try their other offerings - the submarine sandwiches, the "Bellizzaas" (pizzas) and the italian dishes.¬†

The following that this place has garnered in such a short span of time is well-deserved. Undoubtedly one of THE best burger joints in town! A must- visit.

My big fat belly has become the talk of Zomato in a very little span of time. Last Saturday was my turn to experience their oh-so-trending meaty delight in person. The decor of the place is really cool, quirky and easy on your eyes with dim lights and everything but have very limited seating area. We had to wait around 10 minutes to get a table. But their food compensated well for that later on. In the beverages their Kiwi burst mocktail was quite good, the flavour was strong and indeed worked as a Refreshing cooler. We started with their fried chicken wings in BFB special sauce and Pork sausage BFB special. The wings were spicy, juicy and delicious! But it was the pork sausage which was the clear winner. Amazingly done with the right‚Äã amount of spices and minced soft pork. They were pretty generous with the amount as well for two people a plate. In the main course we went for the big juicy lucy burger and Bacon bomb. Now though the former is a top pick for foodies at BFB I personally wasn't very impressed with the same. It tasted too ordinary and they can really work on the patty to be it on the Spicer side. But their bacon bomb is a pork lover's paradise. Minced pork and cheese diced in black bbq sauce, wrapped with fried bacon served with veggies and mashed potato. Absolutely delicious. The prices are very reasonable here and quantity has a good value for money. Efficient and warm service. My BFB experience says you should go and check this place out asap!

A very good place for Italian, American and Continental food with very friendly staff. We were two people and had the BFB Special Chicken Wings, Meaty Monster Pizza and The Big Bong Burger. They were extremely delicious. We also had an Oreo Shake and a Cold Coffee. I also loved the attractive shape of the plates and glasses and the high tool seating arrangement.
I shall make it a point to visit it again the next time I am in the city.
A must visit for food lovers.

Visited this evening eventually cos it was long overdue.. glad that I did cos I loved it. From the decor to the music to the service and last but the least the food was better than I expected. We ordered the mojito and the ice tea to start. The mojito was very refreshing however the ice tea was a bit in the bitter side so that definitely could have been better. Ordered the Pork sausages in Sriracha which was delicious the sausages were homemade and not processed hence that was a thumbs up. Also ordered the fomaggio which was very tasty. Usually pure non vegetarians don't enjoy veg food but the pizza was yummm. The owner was also very polite and friendly and kept asking us if the food was ok. So all in all it ticked all the right boxes hence definitely this will not be my last visit. For the readers a little birdie told me that may is a must visit for their special summer menu which is a must not miss!!!

This place is located right on Sarat Bose Road and unlike what the timings say, opened pretty late into the night. I had visited the place at midnight on my birthday. It's a small cozy and a well decorated place.  The catchy taglines and the quirky decor makes the place pretty vibrant. 

Coming to the food we had ordered for a grilled chicken steak, the big bong burger and a bacon bomb. The steak is pretty average and the mashed potatoes severed on the sides were good too. The big bong burger was excellent as the pulled lamb with the kosha mangsho reduction took it a notch higher. The show stealer and a must have if you are there is the bacon bomb.  Bacon sheets wrapped around minced pork,  this masterpiece is indeed an explosion of flavors. Absolutely beautiful. The staff and the service is pretty good too.  They even treated me with a complimentary chocolate decadent mousse cake as a birthday treat. 

Overall a pretty good experience. Prices are on the higher side but in my views totally worth it. Will recommend.

Absolutely brilliant place... 

Big fat belly turned out to be quite a surprise on my first visit and then it has been a favorite. I eat out very less and when I do its just meat. Wings being my weakness, my first visit was to check out the Naga chili wings. And since I love heat in my food. They impressed me right away. 

The next visit was with a bunch of foodie friends and we were absolutely stunned with the food. The big bong burger is like my dream come true. As are the home made sausages. Once you have these Siracha sausages, you will never feel like touching those horrid synthetic ones you get at the supermarket. 

The lamb shank is a pure show stopper. The jus is so silky smooth. 

One must also try the fig salad. It can give you hallucinations. They love to play with layers of texture and it is seen in many dishes. The flat bread pizza is also hugely recommend. 

Overall, you will never fall  short of praises once you cone here. They are wonderful.

Visited this place two days back with three of my friends. Misguided by such high rating on zomato we decided to end up there. Ordered gooey cheese cigars, chicken sausages, the big bong burger , gardenier. The only dish that I could like was the chicken sausages. The other three ended up being an utter disappointment. 
And the service was remarkably poor. They didn't even bother to provide us drinking water until asked for repeatedly.

Your love affair with food begins and ends here.The super delicious fare on the menu at 'My Big Fat Belly' will make you a bellified loyalist. Starting from the refreshing coolers like the watermelon mojito to the extremely thin 'thin crust ' pizzas with oodles of cheese and toppings like keema,chicken ,shrimp ,mushrooms and much more . Let's not forget to mention the bellifier- ' the BFB special chicken wings with hot sauce ' -these are super delicious and hot quotient ranges high ...!!
The cosy little place offers a friendly food lovers ambience . The service and dedication to serve to everyone's tastes is top notch. Their signature juicy Lucy burgers are the best tasting burgers in Kolkata ,hands down . Served with crisp onion rings and freshly prepared coleslaw ,it's a meal in itself . You even have the 'bong favourite : kosha mangsho burger' what more can I ask for.
This one's here to stay and rule!

This place is near Sarat Bose road,a walking distance from pabrai's ice cream parlour. The place is quite small. We ordered Irani keema pizza,which was on the day's special menu.Also ordered meaty monster, both were thin(est) crust pizza , I've ever tried. Not with heavy cheese yet tasted good. Herb chicken with garlic mayonnaise was yummy too.

I don't usually start off a review like this bit ever since i walked out of bfb, i have this feeling of going back and trying out different options. Two of us, we ordered the herb crusted chicken which everyone should try and the Lucy burger, which was heaven in each mouthful. The orange ginger mohito was nice but a tad too gingery. I wish i had space for dessert.. But like i said, I'm coming back again to this place. Points taken off for the space, which was a little small for us.

We ordered 3 juicy Lucy. It had too much salt and black pepper. The French fries could've been better. Except these, the dish was fine. Overall, it felt little overpriced compared to the quality and quantity. The service is quite poor though. It took a long time for the three burgers to be served and also to clean up and bring the bill. The place is quite cramped and there's always an irritating noise of mixer grinder which ruins the ambience. Decoration of the place is quite good, specially the ceiling, but the mixer grinder noise just kills the ambience. We were fooled by the 4.7 ratings on Zomato, definitely doesn't deserve that much, specially due to bad service and ambience. Not the right place if you're meeting someone after a long time and want to chat a lot.

Interesting name I must say!üòÄ
Having heard a lot about this place,decided to visit Big Fat Belly. Located on the main road in Sarat Bose Road.. it can accomodate a maximum of 5-6 groups at a time. It has an open kitchen.

Coming to food,
Chicken Wings in Ghost Sauce(half plate): 6 pieces of chicken wings was served with a mayo dip. Though it was written three levels of spice on the menu, the waiter didnot ask anything while taking the order! I guess regular level of sauce was used for preparation as I didnot find it too hot! I liked it,but I had better chicken wings in other places!

Herb fried Chicken: Okay! I am a fan of fried chicken. Ignoring that fact I must say this was awsome! The outer coating was crispy and the chicken was well marinated and tasted good. French fries and mayo dip was served with this dip too. üòä

Prices are a little on the higher side but that alright if you compare the quality of dishes!‚ò∫

Truly the apt place for the people of kolkata, as we kolkatians hide our abs below a layer of fat. Jokes apart, this small place though accommodate limited number of people at a time but never fails to satisfy their belly buzz.
Easily locatable on the busy road of Sarat Bose Road (near padmapukur), the interior is very subtle with a touch of urban flavour.
Coming to the food, we went for-
‚Ä¢Mango Smoothie: pardon me on the name as i cannot recollect the exact name but worth a try for refreshment topped with whipped cream.
‚Ä¢BFB special chicken wings in ghost chilly sauce: just like the name the dish is also a nightmare for those who cannot eat spicy stuffs. We went for regular spicy even that tickled out tear glands no wonder what the highest (phaaddu) one can do.
‚Ä¢Crumb fried chicken burger: the stand out dish, served with fries and coleslaw. A must try regardless to say all the burgers here are mouth watering.
Zomato's info for pocket pinch is appropriate and really a value for money place to hang out.
P.S. They have discontinued the shawarma which is a lil disappointing.

Amazing place, though a little hard to locate. It's located on the opposite footpath of Dugout. The day decoration was very pretty and the place accommodates around 20-25 people at a time. Very cordial staff and the food is bombüíô we ordered crumb fried chicken burger and let's nacho . The nachos were perfect and by far the best I had. The burger was amazing. But the fries that accompanied the burger lacked in seasoning. The chicken was so soft and tender and also it had a smoky taste. Would surely visit again and recommend others to visit my big fat belly. The costing was average considering the quality and quantity of food. :) PS , try their chicken bellisma in the fries section. I swear it's one of the best things

First the ambience.. its that of a pizza place.. with bricks and all.. its not too fancy. I loved it though. Definitely not for a romantic date though üòÇ
You can also see there is hell's kitchen in the joint.. üòâ
Now to the staff, they were really not doing a great job. We told 1 member to give us water.. 2 mins no water, we then told another member to bring us some.
Same happened for plates, spoons. Behaviour was good though but servicing wasn't.
The manager was nice lady but it was my birthday and my friends brought a cake for me. This was first restaurant where we were said not to cut a birthday cake(even though we were eating food). I disliked it a lot (but thanks to that we were able to go to another resto after it)

Coming to food.. it was not too great. Good enough maybe, quantity can be increased more.
I loved the special wings with phaduu sauce(wasnt too spicy for me)
And also the herb chicken. It was good.
We had 2 non veg platter with bacon,lamb,chicken but one was with rice,the other baked mashed potato.
Platter quantity was not good at all. Liked eating it though the seasoning wasn't good.
Next time planning on taking the challenge they have.

A small place but amazing nonetheless. Tried the Juicy Lucy Burger with a bacon add-on and lamb patty. They didn't disappoint. A must try for any burger lover. The mocktails were quite refreshing too. Will come back to try the rest. :')

Okay! I really don't know how to start.. But I can tell you.. My big fat belly, really gave me a big fat belly (literally).. Its one of the best American joint in Calcutta.. Yeah, the burgers are expensive.. But you cannot just overlook the quality, the effort that takes to make that juicy burger soo damn good, that you are gonna be like.. Ohh man!! This is gooood.. That look on your face is worth the money.. 

Personally, you should try the BFB chicken wings (it's hot, it's going to tingle your tongue), the chicken skewers from the main menu and perhaps all the burgers that's on the menu.. So do go ahead and have the taste of your life..

This was my second visit and i was even more impressed by the food than last time....This place houses modern unique ideas and offers great service. The owner is highly interactive and amiable and was very supportive as i devoured those painfully delicious ghost pepper wings. The pizzas are marvellous....I bet you cant find a crust like that in the most expensive of places......I no longer have to complain about soggy pizzas....I know where to go........The pasta was cooked to perfection.....no complaints whatsoever.....
The highlight of my meal was the sugarless flourless brownies......I was expecting a horrible dish that health conscious people "learn" to like but was quite taken aback when it turned out to be as good as any other brownie...even better in fact...The ambiance is quaint and cosy much to my liking and the food is without a doubt scrumptious...All in all my experience was fabulous and as much as I would like to find something to criticise I cannot as I lack worthy material......we need more places as bold and on point with their ideas......this is definitely one of the most unique places i have come across in Kolkata and hope for more places that aren't afraid of experimentation....Cant wait for the new establishment

I had bookmarked this place few days back and then finally planned to GROW MY BELLY FAT by dining on a Sundayüòú
I was really looking forward to this place as the menu seemed quite mouth watering.
The dishes I ordered were Gooey Cheese Cigars which was aptly cheesy as its named.It comes with two dips one being the strawberry flavour which was very unique.
Second was Fish And Chips which was amazingly tasty,served with Fries and two dips.. I was already full by now and struggled to finish my plate
Lastly came my Juicy lucy Chicken burger served with coleslaw and Fries with onion rings on top. Honestly I have never eaten such a burger which comes with so much extra. I was so full that I couldn't think of ordering my dessert.
I was happily satisfied with everything over there,the ambience,staffs,the owner and ofcourse the delicious food with great quality and quantity.
Definitely going to visit again and again to try more.
Keep up the standard üëçüèª
Keep growing EVERYONE'S BELLIESüë®üèª‚Äçüç≥

Located bang opposite dugout at sarat bose rd.
The name made me think this place is gonna give me Unwanted calories. Nevertheless, the foodie in me had to try this joint near my area.
The place is small and cozy. Music playing in the background. Dim light,open kitchen. Hustle bustle.
Dishes were good but heavy.
We ordered a pitcher of mojito in mixed fruit. Loved the fresh taste, but it had some soda.
Fish and chips was yum. Fish was super crispy and evenly cooked. Some parts tasted strange though.
The chips in disguise was actually French fries.
The dip was yum.
The other dish had a lengthy name.
Basically herb rice and chicken tikka presented beautifully.there was daal makhanni kinda curry.
It was wholesome n v we 2 wer totally full with all that.
If u r a foodie,u can try it out.
The prices are moderate.
Our bill with taxes was 852/-

I have visited My big fat belly a number of times. Sometimes with my mom, sometimes with friends.
Since my mom is a vegetarian, I had risotto and pizza with her. They were delicious, pizza was tasty and crispy. Risotto had cheese, tomato and various sauces, all of which were mixed to create a sumptuous dish.
When I went with some friends, we had pork sausages, herb fried chicken, the big bomb burger, and pizza. My friends freaked out. All the dishes were lip-smacking.
I once went there with my cousin who is 5 years old and from London. He wanted to have chicken pizza so I got him here. He has never had even 4 slices of any pizza in London, but here he had 6 slices of chicken pizza at BFB !!!! He said the pizza was tastier than any pizza he had in London. He was overjoyed.
The food at BFB is ideal for food lovers with different varieties of delicious food and not to forget the desserts - blueberry cheesecake, brownie with ice cream and chocolate sauce.
Okay, my mouth is already watering, if I continue any longer, I will again have to end up going to MY BIG FAT BELLY !!! 
KEEP IT UP !! I LOVE BFB !!

Had a splendid weekend saturday with an good experience. Went to this place for dinner tonight. It was housefull so we had to wait for half n hour, thereafter the owner had personally came and took our order. We were a group of five and we ordered for veg and non-veg dishes both. I had their Goey Cigars and Arabita. Both tasted superb and I liked their way of presenting the dishes. The service was prompt and portion size was satisfactory. Will prefer going to this place for the second time with my friends. The owner was sweet enough to come and take feedback of each and every dishes taste. Thumbs up to the team!

I had ordered bfb bruschetta via swiggy.The bread was soggy.Half of the toppings were missing.The remaining toppings were too salty specially the one with mushroom.So I thought I should let the restaurant know about it .So I called the restaurant ,a lady picks up the phone.I informed her everything. She was hardly bothered.She was like "kiya hua  hogaya galti,order hi kyun kiya".I told her politely that I had placed an order after reading reviews of THE BLOGGERS who  all wrote such good reviews about it.You know what she did without excusing herself started talking on different phone and was not even listening to me and disconnected my call.I felt so insulted.I am OK with the bread becoming soggy but toppings missing and that extra Salt!!!!!Thank you MBFB.""ORDER ISLIYE KIYA KYUNKI MENU MEIN THA".

Had a very very bad experience at My Big Fat Belly.
Ambience was worst I have ever experienced.
When I was entered into the restaurent it was full. So, one of the staff told me to wait for 25-30 mins. Suddenly after 5-10 mins a lady came who must be the manager or owner I dont know, told me if I can wait outside the restaurent which is nothing but the footpath and it was around 34-35 degree celcius at that time. The behaviour of the lady was not so good too. I was like a insult. I will never go to this place again.

Well, me and my friend decided to visit this place. Reading their amazing reviews we had high expectations and trust me they fulfilled it. Its in Sarat Bose Road near the Royal enfield showroom. A cute little place but interiors are beautifully decorated with wooden tables and high chairs and wall paintings with quirky and funny quotes written. We orderd for bigbong burger,ultimate juicy lucy burger and decadent mousse cake. I loved the burgers especially the big bong burger with kosha mangsho stuffed in it. ¬†I'm not a desert lover so the cake was okayish to me but my friend loved it. The waiters were bit slow. The prices are reasonable compared to the quantity they serve. One burger for one person is more than enough. ¬†
Overall its a must visit place if you are a burger lover.¬†

As all must be knowing"My Big Fat Belly" in bhawanipur. I thought of visiting this Amazing bold caf√© style eatery with my friends.
I ordered "Asparagus and mushroom risotto", My BFB chicken wings" , "shroomy" and " choco decadent mousse cake"
The shroomy was basically a fussilli in white sauce with cheese blend and white wine.The pasta was 'al Dante ' and the flavour of cheese was really coming well alone with the buttons mushrooms.
The risotto was more of less the same taste as the shroomy
The chicken wings were really amazing with a good spice in it and we'll flavoured .The best part was it's
 dip which gave a gud hint of garlicky twist in the mayonnaise
And the show stopper was of course the desert..The Brownie was really moist,bit bitter and soft.. With ice cream,the perfect combination...
Overall it was a really good experience.Just it was bit humid inside as the air-conditioning wasn't working.The staff just had a bit of casual attitude.

Located on Sarat Bose Road near Chakraberia, this little diner is a gem of a place. May BFB has managed to get diners gaga ever since it opened up few months back. Unfortunate enough, I couldn't visit the diner earlier despite several attempts. However, last Sunday, I was in luck since a friend suggested dropping by here for dinner and I was more than happy to oblige. 
The place is small and be ready to brace long queues if you are going there post 7.30 on weekends. The decor is understated at best and that's not a bad thing. It kind of exudes the vibe of a speciality pizzeria somewhere on a desolate stretch of North America. 
Well there may not be all that pomp and glitz and stuff, but what you get is seriously delicious food. We started off with a pitcher of lemon ice tea. The ice tea was a perfect thing for a warm March evening. It wasn't too sweet and I really appreciate that. The starters were cheese cigars and herb fried chicken. The fried chicken is dunked in a secret batter infused with spices and herbs and deep fried. However, the good thing is that you will not get a thick coating of crust and whatever are minimum is the necessity, it's delectable. A half plate consists of 4 decent strips of boneless chicken and comes with a side of coleslaw and garlic aioli dip. The dip is a tad bit spicy and renders the preparation a new dimension. 
The cheese cigars are fabulously gorgeous. A wanton with cheese blend fried to perfection and served with interesting dips. The Texan mayo is a spiced up mayo but the exciting one is the strawberry chilli dip. It was a tad bit sweet with an undertone of spice. The dip perfectly complimented the spicy cheesy blend inside the wanton. 
The mains were pork chops and Al-Pachino pizza. The pork was a bit fibrous and my friend really didn't enjoy the mains that much. The pizza was a clear winner. Generous chunks of chicken with bell peppers and kalamata olives with generous toppings of Mozzarella and Ricotta cheese blend and a hint of extra virgin olive oil on a thin crust...now that's what you call a pizza. The pizza was one of the most delicious pizzas that I have had in Kolkata and seriously is leaps and bounds ahead of the fare offered at leading pizza chains. The 11" pizza was humongous for me and I had to pack a portion of the same. 
They say save the best for the last and the dessert we ordered did complete justice to the saying. The choco decadent mousse cake is quite possibly the best mousse cake that you can get in this part of the town. The chocolate was somewhat bitter and infused with liquor and had the perfect consistency. The best part was it wasn't overtly sweet and the bitterness of the chocolate actually helps to cut down the sweetness.
Pocket pinch is decent, possibly a tad bit on the higher side. But the food that you get more than compensates for the price you pay. Go there seriously...like seriously!!!

I have been yearning to go to this place for quite sometime now, and when I finally got the opportunity, I simply grabbed it!

Located right opposite to The Dugout, locating this place isn't a tough job. Walking in, however, I was a little disappointed, since the place is quite small compared to what I had expected. However, the good news is that, they will be opening another outlet in Elgin soon! So cheers!

Even though the interior is cramped for space, the decorations and ambiance are quite peppy, and there's a wall dedicated to a painting, right beside the 'Hell's Kitchen'. The tables are arranged to make the maximum of the space available, so it might get a little difficult to have spend private times considering that the restaurant is almost always full.

Now coming to the reason of my visit: FOOD!

Refreshments: Watermelon Mojito and Iced Tea were on my order list. I loved the former - it's the perfect cooler on a sunny day.

For the solid gulps,
1. Chicken Caesar Salad: I have hardly tasted any better salad elsewhere! There were a lot of chicken and the dressing was perfect. Highly recommend this one.

2. Grilled Chicken Nachos: I am not a big fan of nachos, but these are one of the better ones I have had. 

3. Al Fungi Pizza: How can mushrooms ever go wrong? The thin crust pizza is perfect, and even though I missed the cheese, the taste was pretty good.

4. Fish and Chips: The crunchy outer part and the soft and well battered inner fish, served with mayo was delicious.

5. Burgers - Now, honestly speaking, this was my main purpose of visiting the place and needless to say, they didn't disappoint me. I ordered the Ultimate Juicy Lucy Chicken Burger and the Big Bong Burger. The chicken was marinated perfectly in the former and tasted excellent with the egg poach and the mutton reduction in the latter was delectable. Though the burgers were a little loose, the taste was too good for me to overlook such small things. Even the onion rings they served alongside were fantastic!

Desserts:
I was quite full by now but desert goes to the heart, not the stomach, right? I ordered for a Blueberry Cheesecake and Mousse Cake. I am probably one of the rare specimens who aren't fond of cheesecakes, but the one served here was light and the cheese hardly made its strong flavour felt. The blueberry on top was just the icing on the cake! The Mousse Cake too was pretty good, but then it takes a tremendous amount of effort to go wrong with Chocolate Mousse. The point that deserves mention here though, is the fact that there pastry chef is just 21 years old and he's doing a fantastic job already!

Overall, HIGHLY recommended. I would love to go back here for the Lamb Shank and the Burgers, and would advise everyone to do the same!

This is a very cute lil cafe situated on Sarat Bose Road, and serves some good tasty food.
The place is actually a bit too small which can accommodate not too many people.

However the food is delicious. We took the Jucy Lucy chicken burger and the Bacon Bomb.¬† Moth were quite meaty and fulfilling with adequate garnishings.
The Fruity mojito was quite refreshing while the Mango Creamy Shake was pretty good too.

The service of the place was nice and dishes were served in fairly quick time.

A visit to this place is highly recommended! :)

This review is limited to the takeaway and I have never been to the restaurant. The burger was average sized and the patty was not that big to command such a price. But it was very good to taste which makes up the aspect of the volume... But by the time I got it.. It was not very hot so the entire thing didn't excite me much.

It actually took me 1 month to come up with the post, and that is not because of the belly satisfying experience over there but the recent health hazard I was dealing with. Coming to My Big Fat Belly, let me share the weird thing first when I first heard about the place I decided to not to visit it and that is just because of the name! I mean My Big Fat Belly, errrrrrr‚Ä¶.. though I was told about the insanely good Burger they are famous about several times but somehow I was not happy with the name and not visited it; well before the 3rd anniversary meet of Kolkata Food Fanatics! Then, my friends, I forgot the name and just enjoyed my¬†food there and then there was Pugtato, and I was in love with him. In fact, it was love at first sight!

Goofy friends and great food is a deadly combination. 
"My Big Fat Belly" will aid you to reach atleast one step closer to that goal. 
The ambience here is amazing. The restaurant is definitely small and we would love to see a bigger outlet or maybe another branch catering their lovely food to a much larger crowd.

The service is good but could've been better. They were taking an average of 20-25 minutes per dish even though there wasn't much rush . Definitely need to improve on that.  Apart that they were serving steaming hot food which nowadays is a luxury! 
Moreover, Hats off to a lady who I believe is the owner, who occasionally used to ask us for  suggestions, because this what owners nowadays lack (which is in-fact, pretty sad) and it is was defines a good eatery. Thanks again ma'am.
 
Finally, the thing that we cherished the most, food. 
Along with a Virgin Mojito we had ordered half a plate of chicken wings in ghost pepper sauce(regular/mild) and a meaty monster pizza with mushrooms. 
The Mojito was excellent with the perfect balance of sour and sweet, served in a Mason jar it looked nice but I believe the BFB could come up with something much more visually attractive.  
The chicken wings were excellent. I would suggest the BFB team to add a small portion of salad along with it just to the douse down the heat. Except that, the wings were simply amazing.
What we loved was the pizza. Thin crust yet soft(unlike many other joints), it was topped with chicken salami and sausage along with bacon and an add on of mushrooms. The pizza (currently) is at the zenith of "great pizzas around Kolkata" and doesn't need any further improvement. 
Overall a great place. Would undoubtedly suggest it to anyone. Thanks for that amazing food.  
Happy dining.

Been here with some of my foodie friends to try this Fast food joint in Bhawanipur.

"My Big Fat Belly"... ah not mine guys it's a name of this Restaurant. So My BFB is an American & European fast food joint which serves some delicious Snacks, finger leaking Burgers, mouth watering Pizzas and refreshing drinks. A decent sized restaurant with sitting capacity of around 20 able to win your hearts with their D√©cor, Ambience, Presentation, Hospitality and food cooked in Hell's Kitchen. If you Belly is also Big and Fat like mine and you and guts then you must try their "Our Belly Challanges" where you got to eat delicious Jumbo burger in time limit. 

Restaurant was situated in 22, sarat bose road, sreepally crossing. easily findable in Google Maps.

D√©cor - D√©cor was very attractive. It's attract your attention from outside itself with it's Bright neon yellow lighting and Cathy name. The moment you entered you'll see upper ceiling designed in indian style doors and with retro light bulbs, bricks wall, wooden chair, tables, floor and decorated walls d√©cor shows it's one of a kind uniqueness. very Cathy and impressive d√©cor which looks damn cool.

Ambience - Ambience was really good. Unique Themed restaurant with classy environment. Hospitality was also very impressive. Staff was well trained. Very friendly and helpful. They take care of their customers very professionally. Prompt service and ravishing presentation. An amazing experience with hospitality here.

So, we tried couple of refreshing drinks and some delicious Snacks which were reviewed below starting with drinks - 

* Watermelon Mojito - A perfect summer cooler drink which was the most refreshing one too. My personal favorite drink at any restaurant. Classic virgin mojito made with refreshment of mints and tanginess of lemons comes with added more refreshment and sweetness of watermelon. Very delicious and full of flavour drink which steel your heart definitely with it's taste.

* Lemon Iced Tea - Another Summer cooler and another one of the most refreshing drink too. They made it perfectly. With tanginess of lemons you'll get the aromatic rawness of tea in this refreshment. Full of flavour drink which tastes amazingly delicious. Loved it.

With this drinks with tried some of their most selling dishes reviewed below - 

* Gooey Cheese Cigars - Their Cheese played the most important role in making customers Belly happy it was fantastically delicious. This snack was heaven your cheese lovers specially of gooey Cheese lovers. Gooey Cheese Cigars are deep fried wanton rolls stuffed with imported cheese mixed with jalape√±o and herbs. Mouth watering delicious snack served with Texas mayo and strawberry Chilly sauce. Recommended.

* BFB Bruschetta Platter - Here comes the shows topper dish. It's my personal favorite dish. The Best Bruschetta's I've ever had. In this Platter we have three different Bruschetta's two each. All with Roasted Italian Bread base. 1st one was topped with italian tomatoes, Parmesan cheese, shavings, basil and on top extra virgin olive oil. Little tangy, cheesy and very delicious. 2nd one was topped with spinach, corn, ricotta cheese and on top cherry tomato. Very heathy and tastes amazingly delicious. Last one was topped with shitake and button Mushroom cream with truffle oil drizzle. Very juicy, creamy and heavenly delicious. Personally recommended.

* Veg Caesar Salad - A Caesar salad is prepared with ice berg lettuce, Cherry tomato, olives, croutons, capers and Caesar dressings. They made it Traditionally and served with focaccia bread. Creamy and cheesy taste. Very healthy and deliciously tasty. Loved it.

* Grilled Cottage Cheese Skewers - This dish is the part of Modern Indian Cuisine which was the rage in indian cuisine. The challenge is to unlearn everything about traditional¬†Indian cuisine¬†and be open to¬†modern¬†flavours. Marinated with Indian spices soft and creamy grilled Cottage cheese served with steamed rice and San Marzano Makhani Sauce which was made with juicy American tomato paste with indian makhani tadka. An amazingly finger leaking delicious dish which was loved by all.

* Al Funghi Pizza (bellifier) - I'm fall in love with these modern pizzas. Super thin crush pizza which was crispy and perfectly made covered with Italian tomatoes sauce with toppings of button mushrooms and shitake mushrooms with poured truffle oil in mozzarella and cream cheese. Very delicious pizza totally loved it.

* The Great Aggarwal Ji Burger - Great Burger not by it's name only but also by it's taste, quality and quantity too. American Burger made totally desi style with homemade stuffs. Bun was filled with Masala Aloo Tikki, chatpata dhaniya mayo, onion rings, tomato, cheese slice & cheddar blend and served beautifully wit sweet tamarind chatni injected. Truly amazingly delicious desi marwari taste burger served with Aloo bhujiya, fries and coleslaw.

*  Czar's Turkish Cottage Cheese Burger - The Royal Turkish Burger which tastes royal and looks royal. Amazingly delicious and very tasty burger made with Bun filled with soft, creamy and herbal grilled Cottage cheese patty with grilled onions, Monterey jack cheese, cucumber pickles, Texas mayo and topped with onion rings. Brilliant burger served with fries and coleslaw.

We ender this finger leaking food experience with couple of delicious desserts reviewed below - 

* Decadent Mousse Cake - This dessert is a chocoholic's dream of rich, intense and delicious flavours. made with a chocolate cake base, cool creamy mousse filling¬†and topped with rich dark chocolate ganache.

* Blueberry Cheese Cake - Blueberry Cheese Cake was one of most favorite desserts. It's cheesy, creamy, little salty, sweet, little tangy and heavenly delicious. Crushed cookies based creamy and cheesy cake topped with Blueberry jelly made perfectly and tastes heavenly.

That's all with my never forgetting experience with my BFB. Like to thank staff and owners for these wonderful experience. A must try place for their American and Italian snacks with Desi tadka. Personal favorite highly recommended to all.

This tiny, easy-to-miss restaurant is a must visit for meat lovers! Barely bigger than a medium sized garage, MBFB houses 6 tables and offers the most delectable Bacon Bomb, that will linger on your tastebuds and make you come back for more. Other savouries worth a try include, but not limited to, BFB chicken wings in phaadu sauce, braised pork chops, non-veg platter in BFB sauce and blueberry cheesecake.
Service is prompt and the staff are courteous. Great experience overall. Will definitely visit again.

Over the last few months this place has become my go to place. The place is done up very well specially the high chairs! üòÉ
I have been here a couple of times and the food to the service everything was excellent.
Recently I visited this place with a friend we had ordered a pitcher of peach ice tea, meaty monster pizza, juicy Lucy burger and the prawn cocktail tarts.
The peach ice tea was good as usual. The pizza was wow and the burger patty was gooey and well done. They serve the burger with onion rings and fries which makes it a wholesome meal. üòÉ
The only thing which I didn't like was the prawn tart, the tart was stale and the prawns were old. But once we told our server it was changed immediately. Instead of the tart we got fish and chips and it compensated for the tarts. It was made very well. Kudos to the team for such prompt service.
The food here is excellent and pocket friendly. The staff is courteous and helpful. A must visit! üòÉ

Good options are there in pizza and burgers. They even have specials in almost all categories. With the kind of food and atmosphere they offer the price is very much reasonable. A perfect place to spend quality time with your special one. The staff is very friendly and service is also quick.

This place has been in my wish list for so long.Finally came here with group of friends.Its a pocket bomb indeed.It remains full even at odd hours of weekdays owing to the fantastic food they serve.

We started off with

‚Ä¢Gooey cheese cigars- I am an ardent lover of anything cheesy! Here molten cheese oozing out from golden brown cigars were sheer bliss for me.It was served with cocktail sauce and strawberry chilli sauce.The latter was something very unique which I never tried before.It was amazing.

‚Ä¢Chicken quinoa salad- Who knew salad could taste so good? Loved the refreshing flavour in it.The rocket leaves and chicken tasted so well together.Its a perfect summer dish.

‚Ä¢Nachos with chicken- This is a commonly loved Mexican dish.It was made perfectly at My BFB.

For the mains we had

‚Ä¢Fish and chips- A British classic.Two cornflakes coated crispy fish fries were served with tartare dip and mustard mayo.Fish was fresh, soft and flaky within.

‚Ä¢Al funghi pizza- Perfect thin crust cheesy Italian delight it was! Loved the topping of mushrooms and cream cheese.

‚Ä¢Burgers- These are signature dishes at My BFB. We tried two varieties. The big bong burger with kosha mangsho reduction as filling and chicken juicy lucy burger. For me the big bong burger was the clear winner as Kosha Mangsho gets any bangali emotional at the core of their heart.Onion rings and fried served with it were also very good .

‚Ä¢Chicken skewers- Loved the presentation of this dish.Two hanging chicken skewers were served along with herb rice and gravy.This was like comfort food.

Such a huge spread needed mocktails alongside them.We had Watermelon Mojito and Iced tea.I preferred the first one.

For a sweet ending to the meal we chose the best desserts My BFB offers.Its hard to pick a favourite amongst this two.Both are great in their own different ways.

‚Ä¢Decadent mousse cake- Omg! Such a sheer sinful bliss of chocolatey delight it was! The light airy mousse showcased flavour of rich dark chocolate at its best.

‚Ä¢Blueberry cheesecake- The cheesecake was light and the rich blueberry compote on top balanced it out well.It was a tangy refreshing dessert that cleanses the palate at the end of the meal.

I'm definitely going to come back at My BFB in future to try their spicy treats when the heat in Kolkata's weather will be less scorching.

FINALLY ordered (thru Swiggy). 3 burgers - Juicy Lucy (chicken and Lamb), Grilled Chicken. DISAPPOINTED! Apart from burgers arriving stone cold (500 mts away), the chicken and Lamb patties tasted 95% identical. Too much seasoning (oregano). A burger in which you can't taste the meat patty IS NOT A BURGER. The egg yolk was not runny. I can go on but suffice it is to say - WASTED! Eaten 10 times better burgers in Kolkata.

YOU CAN'T MISS THIS!!üíØ

Located right beside Sarat Bose Road and Chakraberia Road confluence, it's very easy to locate.
The name of the cafe definitely acts as a magnet.

As soon as you enter, you get the feeling that you are going to have a wonderful time.‚úî
The place is filled with young crowd, amazing music and cosy, wooden decor.

I tried the following items:
Veg Caeser Salad: I'm not a salad person but I liked it.
Bruschetta: Delectable.
Pizza Al Fungi: The mushrooms on the top of it tasted ravishing.
Cottage Cheese Skewers: From presentation to tasteüëåüëåüëå.
The Great Aggarwalgi Burger & Garden's Treasure: Both are burgers tasted like heaven.üòäüíØ
Blueberry Cheese Cake and Decadent Mousse Cake: 
These desserts undoubtedly stole the show. How so good???!!!üòç‚úîüíØüëå

The service was top notch and the same goes for the management. The price justifies the quality of the food they serve. My best wishes to Aakarsh Bhargava.üëç

Before coming to this restaurant, I had very high hopes and expectations but after coming to the restaurant, I am deeply disappointed. The veg dish my friend ordered reached the table after an hour and that also the wrong dish. Simply unacceptable. I wish someone takes strong action against this situation. The only good thing is that I left without A BIG FAT BELLY.

This is located very close to my house, and I have been receiving positive reviews about it from a lot of people. I finally bunked college to visit the place a couple of days back and I really did make the most out of ¬†it! The place is cramped for space, but it has a pleasant air about it which is enjoyable. We were a group of about seven people. We ordered an Al Fungi Pizza, Fish and Chips, Burgers - Chicken Juicy Lucy and the Big Bong Burger, chicken skewers, and Mousse Cake and Blueberry Cheesecake for desserts. Among these, the fish and the burgers were too good! The pizza was delicious, too. The mousse Cake here is definitely one of the best I've had in the city. The price is quite cheap in comparison to the quantity of food they serve. I can't wait to come back here!

A restaurant which lives up to its name. when you leave you do get a big fat belly. The Big Fat Belly sauce is beautiful. The Bacon Bomb was heavenly. We also had the grilled chicken burger, ultimate juicy lucy, Russian mafia sub, grilled fish and the non veg platter. wanted to try the belly challenges but was informed that the challenges¬† were only allowed on weekdays. this last hiccups prevented me from giving 5star to this otherwise fine establishment.

Horrible horrible service , took more than an hour to get 1 pizza . Food not bad but cannot make up for the extremely horrible service . They said they don't take reservations when we called but upon reaching we had to be shifted to another table halfway through our meal as they said the table was RESERVED ( they said they don't take reservations!) Would not recommend going here ... You should go here only if you want to wait 2 hours for food . Just because there were senior citizens present there .. they served them the whole meal while we didn't get our starters as well ! Also there was no mineral water available here and we had to drink tap water , glasses had lipstick on it . After all this waiting they still managed to screw up our orders . Manager was very persuasive. We were in a hurry and didn't notice but later we say that we got cheated of rs 300 . Would never recommend going here

My Big Fat Belly has come up on Sarat Bose Road. American and Italian dishes are what they serve. Headed by Aakarsh Bhargava My Big Fat Belly has some great things in store.
The interior is beautifully crafted with Wooden Table and Chairs with rough walls. Filament bulbs lights up the entire interior.
Coming to the food try out the Caprese Salad which comes as a weekly special. The Cheese slices goes really well with the salad.
For the thin crust lovers My BFB has a long list of delicious Bellizzas Pizzas. Comes in thin crust and good amount of toppings they taste wonderful.¬†
Fondue with veg as well as non veg platter is another excellent dish to try at BFB. The Cheese dip that it is served with is warmed by a candle under it.
Lamb Shank at Big Fat Belly is a must try for everyone.
The Baked Penne Ala Vodka is another dish worth trying here.
The meal is good when the desserts are fantastic. And here is a cheese Cake Pastry with Gajar ka Hawla on top to make it a perfect dessert to end your meal. The combination is tastes wonderful.

Service is excellent. Satisfaction is utmost. Prices are reasonable as quality is very good.

Another welcome addition to Kolkata's growing list of cafes. My big fat belly lives up to its name with humungous portions. Chicken nachos, the way you like it, an insane sandwich called The Russian mafia, and herb fried chicken - all were good. The place is small and cozy. Tastefully decorated (look out for the ceiling!). Staff is courteous and friendly.

I have a habit of searching for new restaurants out in Zomato and deciding on my next hangout accordingly. Well, this fitted the bill as we had planned for a small meet up with old friends. We noticed it to exactly opposite of The Dugout and easily found out the place. Though parking was a bit problematic but we managed. We were impressed with the customer service and the unique menu cards. We tried out Bull Mojitos (exceptionally presented and packed with surprises in every sip), Sausages and Chocolate Mousse all of them being prepared near to perfection. The ambience was really old-school and catchy being all our childhood chartbusters played one after another and that too a commendable volume so that we can enjoy the music and talk as well. Will surely come back again.

Tasted the Ultimate Juicy Lucy burger with chicken patty and a vegetarian burger (don't know the name, the waiter suggested it for the vegetarians in our group). Juicy Lucy was by far the tastiest burger I've ever had. Very satisfying, cheesy and meaty. Quantity of the accompanying French fries and onion rings was quite good. The Veg burger needed a bit of improvement.

Overall, great experience, though it is slightly on the expensive side.

The ultimate juicy Lucy was a wonderfully presented meal with coleslaw and fries at the side. Although I didn't get a good picture I can assure you it looks mouth watering. 
I ordered the chicken burger and it was more than enough for one person. It could easily substitute the entire starter-main course-desert ritual. 
I also ordered the brownie with ice cream (no pic) which was a good seal the deal desert. It was just the right amount of sweetness you'd need after the heavy burger.

So this was in my list for pretty long and considering how big my appetite was yesterday, it deserved a Big Fat Belly dinner!
Bad things first.. The vegetarian options were few and unimpressive. We ordered a Thin Crust Gardeniere Pizza, The Great Agarwalji Burger & Bruschetta Platter.. All very mediorce. The burger was pretty oily even to my Marwari palate.
Now.. The good part.. Braized Pork Ribs were so good, with the gravy it was like a mouthful of heaven ‚ù§ The Bacon Bomb was good, but I aint a bacon fan myself.
Mixed Fruit Mojito was the perfect drink to go with.. Tangy & very Refreshing. 
Last and the least, they killed the Blueberry Cheesecake. Considering the fact that they suggested it themselves, it was painfully average.

My big fat belly !!! Big fat wedding ‚Äì Delhi belly ‚Äì big fat belly (myself off course) ‚Äì my big fat belly ‚Ä¶.. No, I am not trying to discuss the evolution of the name behind THE place for burger in Kolkata this time. Just that my thoughts go wild at times- that‚Äôs why‚Ä¶

So, it was the Kolkata Food Fanatic‚Äôs 3rd anniversary meet in february and My Big Fat Belly had worked out a fantastic deal for us, so the madness was held there this month. It‚Äôs a small joint in Lansdowne Road (sharat Bose Road) somewhere in between elgin road crossing and Padmapukur. Travelling towards padmapukur, it‚Äôll come on your left and somewhat easy to miss during the daytime. In the evening , off course, the glow-sign shows its true color and it‚Äôs pretty visible. Parking is slightly problematic, yet managable.

The interior is minimalist yet tastefully done. Wooden panels are used abundantly and furniture gives a rustic looks. But, who cares for furniture when the food is good ? The standard condiments are given, nothing fancy.

The non-alcoholic drinks came in- a bottomless portion of flavored mojito and iced tea. Along with it, came the nachos with cheese cream sauce (in-house) and green salad with feta cheese. The nachos were good, but I felt, has become slightly soggy due to the sauce, but probably that‚Äôs the way it was supposed to be. The portion size is huge‚Ä¶. and the salad was good, but I promptly finished all the feta cheese dollops from the salad, despite everybody giving me stern looks. See, I don‚Äôt care, I am a bong and I love cheese- period‚Ä¶

The next item blew me out. Is was one insane stir fried sausage (both chicken and pork) with bell peppers. Now, off course, while pork is there, I normally don‚Äôt look at chicken- but here, even the chicken sausage was good. We were told, they are outsourced from Kalmans and probably that had made all the difference. It was moderately spicy, and upon request, Aakarsh immediately got me their BhootJalokia dip and it was insanely hot (boy, I was missing my old monk+ Thums up). a definite must-try.

¬†
Next came the fondues with veg and no-veg dips. It was probably one of the best collection I‚Äôve ever seen in Kolkata restaurants. I won‚Äôt be able to describe them, so, please have a look. One portion can easily, very easily be shared among 2 persons and by the sheer portion size, it won hands down.

Next was the pizza time. Now, pizza in an supposedly american joint ? Probably I was smirking, and the owners probably sensed it. What came next, is one of the best thin-crust pizzas in the city. Though the pepperoni version is my favorite choice, the veg version is not left behind. And, my apologies to the establishment for underestimating them. thy were not over cheesy (pun intended‚Ä¶), but rightly finished.

I was full, when I was asked for my choice of burger and being the shameless glutton that I am, I asked for their Juicy Lucy. I loved it from my first visit to this place and it was one hell of a burger. Served with fries and a small portion of salad, it‚Äôs one complete meal for one person. And the good part, if you‚Äôre full, they can pack it nicely and you can have it next day and it‚Äôll be almost as good as the previous night (pssst‚Ä¶.. I did it). My big fat belly is famous for their burgers and within a very short time, they‚Äôve made their mark and with this product, I can vouch for that.

They say, ordering an item in restaurant is something like choosing the bride (groom also‚Ä¶ ) in an arranged marriage. Once it comes to you, you feel the dish ordered at the next table is better, but then you can‚Äôt return it. Such happened here.  Rishi ordered for their Lamb Shank, and it was superb. A perfect shank of lamb braised with brown sauce and set on a bed of mashed potato- who am I lesser mortal to not to like it ?

There was some dessert after this, but frankly I was going to ask the owners to arrange something to lift me up, so full I was‚Ä¶.. So, can‚Äôt tell much about the dessert. However, with few good, mad people around and damn heavy, sumptuous food, an evening can‚Äôt go wrong‚Ä¶..

Way back in early 2000‚Äôs, Om Shanti Om released and suddenly everyone was talking about SRK‚Äôs 6 packs. A few months later Amir answered back with his 8 packs in Ghajini. But behind all this battle over 6, 8 and maybe even 10 packs, Kolkata‚Äôs beauties were still falling for the good old bhuri of a Kolkatan. Nurtured by the serious love for food and untimely afternoon naps (fondly called bhat-ghum) the bhuri is as much a part of the City of Joy as the tram or the Victoria Memorial. From the jolly good one of Gopal Bhanr to the sinister one of Maganlal Meghraj, the bhuri is everywhere. So it is no wonder that a restaurant called The Big Fat Belly should open its doors to Kolkata. And it has been received and how! (currently a 4.6 on Zomato)!
                                                                ...

A week back, me and my buddy was thinking on having a meal outside and naturally I opened Zomato for probable suggestion which made me chalk out ‚ÄúMy Big Fat Belly‚Äù. Though, neither of us have had big fat bellies or interested in making one; the urge to have food from this place took a liking. Both of us, along with a common friend of ours, made a visit to this recently opened solo outlet.

It is located on Sarat Bose Road, around 12 minutes walking distance from Forum Mall, but a fair distance from Rabindra Sadan Metro. It is right over the main road crossing and hence detection is never an issue.

We entered to a small area of regulated temperature with unique seating arrangements and dimly lit ambiance to give it a vintage feeling. The chairs are placed in a circle around the table while some seats are highly placed. One unique factor about the chairs was that it is reasonably heavy being possibly made of iron and just the seating portion is labelled with wood to give the necessary comfort. The table top are decorated with quotes, tag and one liners and this is what keeps you amazed along with the light bulbs which makes you feel that you have been teleported to British era. However, the bright LED TV in the background is distracting and does not seem to go on with the ambiance.

We started with a signature dish which goes with the name, ‚ÄúBFB Special Chicken Wings in Ghost Chilly Sauce‚Äù and with Creamy Mushroom Soup. Since, none of us are comfortable with ‚Äúhot chilli‚Äù, we took the regular one and continued to enjoy the ambiance. We were served with soup sooner than we thought and the Chicken Wings followed soon after.

The staffs out here are cleanly dressed, always wears a smile and soft spoken. You are ought to feel a good vibes with them.

Just as we sipped through the Soup, which was served with Bread Crumbs, the owner of the particular outlet came and personally asked for the feedback of the same. Since, I am not particularly a ‚Äúsoup‚Äù person, I declined to give any judgments and just replied with ‚Äúgood‚Äù. It is then I asked who he was and he introduced as being the owner of the place, is an ex-cook of a 5 star hotel and seemed to a manager of the place too. He also asked if represent any organisation due to my query of minute details. I replied him saying that I am just a regular reviewer on Zomato and that is how we ended up here. He requested us to try other dishes and then give him suggestions to improve.

Soon after, the Chicken Wings made a visit with Mayonnaise to compensate the hotness. Just as I took a bite of the chicken, the hotness forced me to make a hissing hound which prompted the owner to again visit us and asked us to try any more items. I said that the chicken is indeed very tasty and he need not worry much as we can handle the hotness once in a blue moon. However, the mayonnaise seemed to have a strong garlic touch which I did not feel much comfortable with. 

Completing the wings, we ordered for a Butterscotch & Caramel drink and an Oreo & Cream as a parting dessert. Both of it arrived fairly soon and it was suitably chilled. The caramel was little on the lower side but the Oreo & Cream is sure to make your day and we fairly enjoyed it.

Just as we asked for the bill, we were presented with a Choco Decadent Mousse Cake as a sign of apology since we felt the chicken too hot. We wanted to say the owner that he need not compensate us likewise as we were prepared for the hotness in it, he was nowhere to be found and thus could not share our thought. However, the mousse cake was extremely delicious and we instantly regretted not ordered it at first.

Getting loads of positivity from the place, we made our way home.

To rate the food being served, I seem to present in this manner:
1) Creamy Mushroom Soup ‚Äì 4 / 5
2) BFB Special Chicken Wings in Ghost Chilly Sauce ‚Äì 4.5 / 5 (for Chilli Loving Person ‚Äì 5 / 5)
3) Butterscotch & Caramel ‚Äì 3.5 / 5
4) Oreo & Cream ‚Äì 4.5 / 5
5) Choco Decadent Mousse Cake ‚Äì 5 / 5
** Pocket Pinch ‚Äì 5 / 5

Qs) Should you visit them?
Ans) Yes, of course you should.

Qs) Why have I rated them 4.5 stars?
Ans) Honestly, I found everything in place and surely they deserve positive ratings. However, I offer full ratings only when the outlet in question serves in a similar manner even after one year of operation and hence it is on hold. Also, since this place offers free WiFi, the waiter or representative from this place should personally demonstrate or ask the customer if they want WiFi or the procedure regarding the same should be made handy. N.B. - None of us required any internet connectivity as we had 3Gs enabled; it is for people who might require but skeptical to ask for the same.

One of the best cafes in the city I've been to, with one of the nicest ambiances. 
Usually occupied by the young crowd, with groovy background music coupled with dimmed interiors (courtesy lanterns) and a cozy environment perfect for gupshups and long conversations, My Big Fat Belly's offerings will surely make one's belly big and fat indeed!

Coming to the food, we ordered something like asparagus soup (although I do not exactly remember the name) and herb fried chicken.
The soup was the best soup I've tasted so far. Even better than the Knorr soup that many have at home.
Served piping hot in a nice round bowl and spoon (not the soup spoon so those not accustomed to drink with it will find it convenient), it was thick, creamy, and so very delicious! Though I had to blow the spoonful of soup for it was extremely hot initially, nonetheless it left me complety spellbound.

The chicken fries - made with boneless chicken coated in Chef's secret batter, infused with herbs and seasonings and fried to crispy perfection - were less salted, but when dipped in the garlic aioli dip or tabasco sauce it tasted well enough. One can sprinkle salt if necessary. The hot fresh French fries accompanying them were tasty and crispy.

Unfortunately due to some technical glitches they couldn't receive the money via cards that particular day, so all the guests had to pay in cash. Thankfully our bill hadn't amounted to much and we hadn't been short of cash.
I would request the management to look to this issue to avoid further inconvenience. Not everyone would know to ask whether cards are being accepted for the day or not before entering the eatery.

Overall, one must surely visit it if one loves and enjoys good food. If you already haven't do so ASAP. Even if all items are not that praiseworthy one won't be disapointed leaving this must-visit cafe in the city.

A small yet impactful eatery. The rustic interiors where basic and simple. The USP is it's food. Double thumbs up. I being a vegetarian, had ordered a bowl of nachos, a veg Lucy juicy burger and a pitcher of mixed fruit mojito to go along with. My friend ordered eggjatly, an omelette sandwich and prawn tarts. Just upto the mark. Nothing disappoints you. At the end of such a lovely experience we ordered for a banofie pie which was again amazing. The staff was courteous and friendly. Had an amazing experience altogether. Would highly recommend this one.

What a fantastic cozy little delicious place! I'm really happy to have found this... And how I wish I would have visited here sooner. What finally brought me here was it's fantastic menu and stellar Zomato rating!

Ambiance and seating wise it is a really tiny place with room for no more than 20-25 people to sit. The whole decor is made to give it a very comfortable and chatty feel. The downside was that with the restaurant full, there was a lot of commotion with the staff taking and delivering orders along with working on their takeaway orders. The upside was that the small arrangement enabled them to give personalized attention to each and every guest right from suggesting dishes to taking feedback - which was really good.

They have a really good menu, and even better are all the dishes. You can see the love, care and meticulous effort behind every dish - as if extra care was taken to make the dish extra special for you! We were a group of 6 and ended up eating a lot more than we could or should üòõ

In appetizers, we had Loaded Nachos with Grilled Chicken, Chicken Wings with Faadu sauce and Cheese Rolled Cigars. The Faadu sauce was really Faadu! A real adventure for your spice buds. Cheese Cigars were basically Cheese Balls - crisp fried on the outside and molten cheezy from inside...like perfection. These two are must tries here! You can maybe take a pass on the Loaded Nachos...which were served slightly cold and weren't up to the mark as the other two dishes.

For main course we had Grilled Chicken burger, Chicken Juicy Juicy burger, Veg Juicy Juicy burger, Czar's Turkish Cottage Cheese Burger, The Great Aggarwal ji Burger and Auntie Annie's Alfredo Pasta(Veg). Standout items were the Pasta, Aggarwal ji Burger and the Juicy Juicy burgers. All the burgers are very well presented and served with fries and coleslaw. Juicy Juicy burgers additionally come with onion rings. The Aggarwal ji Burger came with a syringe of meethi chutney and Bhujia Sev on the side! Hats off to that presentation. The Highlight of all the burgers was the Patty. Aggarwal ji Burger came with a spicy patty which exactly reminded me of the Ragda Patties patty served widely in Mumbai. The Juicy Juicy burger's patty is seriously loaded with Cheese and veggies and what not!! I was slightly disappointed with the Paneer burger...I would have loved a KFC's paneer zinger kinda patty instead of a spicy marinated giant slice of mighty soft paneer. The Pasta was the best dish of the lot! Cheesy and cooked to perfection. I would have liked to have a slice of Garlic bread to its side rather than the piece of bun that came with it.

In drinks, we had ordered Blueberry shake, Brownie shake, Hazelnut shake, Oreo cream shake and Peach Iced Tea. And god were they fantastic! Every single one of them! Especially the brownie and blueberry ones. I would have loved them to be thicker though. All shakes are well presented and a good in quantity as well.

At the end of the day it was a true delight for My Big Fat Belly with all the great food. A big thumbs up to the staff as well for the awesome service üëç
The place isn't heavy on the pocket either. It fares way too high on the value for money front. You'll have a great time at this place - a must visit üòä

The food is exquisite and the keema cannelloni deserves a Special mention. 
The burger variety is so vast that I might have to come another 10 times to try each one , it being so filling. 
The pizzas are also pretty good .
The service time is so short that the team deserves a clap for it .

Ordered in on Valentine's Day. Had the typical juicy Lucy burger, chicken wings and pizza. We had gone to this place earlier but this ordering in was a first. The packaging was done right as there was not any significant spill over. Coming to the food, Burger was awesome, pizza came in a delightful heart shape which you can see in the pics I upload. However the wings were a big big miss. They were just fat and mostly inedible. So next time onwards it's just pizza and burgers from this joint.

It is a very tiny place located in Bhawanipur just opposite to The Dugout. We were a group of 7 people and had to wait for almost an hour to get a table. The staffs are well behaved and the service is good. Ambience is okay.
Now coming to the food we ordered Chicken Wings in Ghost Chilly Sauce, Chicken Steak in J's BFB Sauce, BFB Veg Grill Platter and Arabiatta. The chicken wings were soo good, I felt like eating it all alone. Chicken Steak was also very good. Arabiatta was just okay, neither too good nor too bad. Overall a good experience!

A nice tiny cozy place by the main road just around the corner. Great Ambience, the walls carry lovely frames with food-sarcasm. The washrooms are so well kept-I‚Äôd give you guys a 5/5 for hygiene.

Our order began with a BFB special chicken in ghost chili sauce (for real chilli lovers this may be a disappointment) the skin of the chicken was not removed- I sort of felt uncomfortable with this fact- it better be mentioned in the menu.

Next we went for the Russian Mafia-a coleslaw- a perfect blend of eggs and chicken in just the right proportion. I‚Äôd rather call this English something as this dish was so perfect English.
Next in queue was the Annie Aunty‚Äôs Alfredo. For a sauce lover like me- this was a so so. I really didn‚Äôt enjoy this much, the penne was barely soaked in the sauce but I had to complete the dish.
My friends picked the Al-Pachino pizza and this was a delight. It was a burst of sauces, cheese,veggies and all the good things that complemented the tender chicken you have with every bite of that perfect crust. This dish was all justice.¬†
We finished with Choco decandent mousse cake as they did not have Bellypathy (Which I so badly wanted- I mean look at it on the menu, it is so calling!)¬† 

So basically my experience graph was a lowhigh-lowhigh but a nice spot to hangout with friends ( a party of small though). And what I see from other reviews is this spot is a place for pizzas. So choose wisely.

Although my expectations are too high I am still looking for a joint to match the Pollo Forza of pizza express.
They could add a little more flavors.

The initial plan was to go for the BFB Wings challenge, but then we decided to test the waters first. The Phaadu sauce isn't named so for nothing. It is quite hot. We also tried Annie Aunty's Alfredo, Chicken Skewers with San Marzano Makhni sauce and Brownie with Ice cream and chocolate sauce. The service is quite great and so are the dishes. A place that you should definitely try out.

My Big Fat Belly is one of the finest new addition to the food scene in Kolkata with superb food at very pocket friendly prices.

Located on Sarat Bose road opposite Dugout, BFB is a small joint with a big heart. The restaurant is casual and is quite comfortable. The staff is warm, polite and the owners personally overview the place so it leaves little room for error. Menu is elaborate with some exceptional fusion dishes that come at reasonable pricing considering the ingredients, preparation and portions.

Tried the nachos with paneer khurchan which was great and loved that melted cheese sauce alongside. Fondue platter is one to die for. It has veggies, grilled potatoes panner, garlic bread, fries alongside the cheese dip that was insane. Hotty belly pizza was great so was the veg juicy lucy burger. Star was the cottage skewer with herbed rice and San Marzano makhni gravy. The gravy was made from imported tomatoes from San Marzano and had nice texture and flavour. Loved the cottage cheese skewer buy presentation was mind blowing. Ended up with some nice chocolate mousse cake. Loved their peach iced tea and watermelon mojito.

Overall, loved everything I had here. It was a king-size meal for me here and am in love with this place !!

Today we had a great lunch in My Big Fat Belly. The place is a bit small, we had to wait 25 minutes to get a seat but the owner kept us company until we got our seat. The food was worth waiting for. We ordered hot chicken wings and sausages in chef's special sauce, both of them were very good. The sausages here are homemade and highly recommended, they were yummy. For mains we ordered there signature dish Big Bong Burger and Bacon Bomb. Both of them are very good and truly there signature dish. Overall we had a great time and enjoyed the food. 

Definitely visit again to try there pizzas.

Arrived on V-Day to this place , and I was in awe with the door of this place ,it has got a French touch it gives you a French cafe feeling , with eye catching label of My big fat belly on top of the cafe door is sure to boost your appetizer . The whole set is pretty inside not too spacious yet you can create your own space . Coming to the food we ordered chicken Ceaser salad which was disappointing for me personally I have tasted better and it wasn't close enough to good either , my man ordered pork chops in starters which was quite tender and spicy a bit too spicy but my man was happy and for me it was in between above average and good mostly good . Now my favourite part main course I ordered chicken steak in mushroom crepe and it was amazing it's just melted in my mouth I preferred with saute veggies along mashed potato rather than rice and they suggested me to tag along with cheese which I didn't but next time I'll make sure I do that. My man ordered some lamb dish in BBQ sauce which he was pleased with and really happy , which stands that I did not really had to do any extra effort to keep the man content on V-Day credit goes to BFB . Price was okay it was around INR 1400 slightly pricy I felt but never mind it was worth it .

The restaurant is at a prime location in sarat bose road and The first thing that attracted me is their old English type decor and the Name!!! The hospitality and behaviour of the ever smiling and helpful staffs are worth tp be mentioned. we tried their pork chops and chicken steak and chocolate cheese cake. The pork was and the chicken was very tender,well cooked and they customise as per the guest's choice which adds a special zing to the flavour. The cheese cake was soft and really deliciously baked and served. As the name suggests My Big Fat Belly really fills their guests belly with their varied delicious food which also satisfies the soul.

Manages to sneak in a place thanks to the lovely lady owner of the place. The place offers both veg and non veg offersings . We ordered a fries preparation which was good .¬† A pizza which was just too good . To top it all we ordered cheese fondue which was good. I didnt like all the accompaniments that came with the fondue . Never seen Raw carrot , raw cucumber ,¬† soup sticks along with the fondue . The mojito pitcher we ordered was suffice for 4 people easily (in 200 bucks) . Overall a great place to head to if you love food.

A small and a cozy cafe, gives an American feel. The menu is quite extensive just little less options for vegetarians.
Ordered cheese cigars, grilled chicken burger, Shroomy Pasta, Spinach and corn cannelloni and Blueberry Cheesecake. The chicken patty in the burger was a little dry, apart from that everything was absolute delight. The cheese oozing out of the cigars, perfect sauce and macroni blend in the pasta and cannelloni was heavenly. Cheesecake was creamy and had perfect blueberry flavour, just the bottom biscuit layer was a little thin. Overall a must visit place for people who love continental food.

A newly opened eatery located @the crossing of Sarat Bose Road and Chakraberia on the left while coming from Minto Park serves authentic home-made continental cuisines, if you have crave for western palette. Loved the decor with hand crafted doors, windows, wall paintings, vinyls, hanging lightning from ceiling which resembles western flavour all around. Coming to its food, their expertise staff recommended to try the home made pork sausages and the burger which tasted awesome. However the dessert was not so satisfactory. Service was speedy and rates are on higher side.

Located beside the juncture of Chakraberia Road and Sarat Bose Road, My Big Fat Belly offers amazing continental cuisine. This is a small outlet with around 5-6 tables, the decor is nice, urban and impeccable. I have ordered one Green Apple Ice Tea and Grilled Chicken Breast. The iced tea was very refreshing, and was soothing in taste. The grilled chicken comes with choice of sauce, herbed rice or mashed potatoes and saut√©ed vegetables. In the menu fried egg was written as well, when asked why it is missing, the reply was its an add on. One suggestion, please mention explicitly which stuff is an add-on, as your menu did not mention likewise. I chose the mushroom creme sauce, the consistency of which was perfect but it was a bit over seasoned. Chicken was perfectly grilled. Overall, a nice experience.

TL;DR (Too Long, Didn't Read) Version : Good food, good ambience, great service, slightly spicy food, must visit.

It often happens that my family decides where we should eat after we've left our home and this time the decision was my big fat belly, we visited this place on a Friday night and it was fairly crowded, we were 8 of us and got the 2 tables at the center of the restaurant. I must mention I absolutely loved the ambience and decor of the place, especially the ceiling which had old doors and windows on it, looked absolutely wonderful, the lighting of the place is spot on and does wonders for the restaurant. Now for food, we ended up ordering a LOT of it, so please bear with me on the review:Exotic fruit salad - This item isn't on the menu but was on a chalkboard on today's special so we decided to order it, it had strawberries, dragon fruit and pomegranate. It was definitely tasty but it had a spicy element to it as well, so if you can't handle spice, I'd suggest against this dish.
Paneer Kurchan Nachos - These nachos were really good, the chips didn't seem store bought and had a good taste to them, there was ample toppings so that no nacho had to be eaten alone, but again, was a little spicy, so keep that in mind while ordering here

Formaggio Pizza - This was a four cheese pizza and was really cheesy, the crust was good too, great pizza overall

Grilled Chicken - The chicken was well marinated and cooked well, it was accompanied with the restaurant's special sauce which paired just right with the chicken, the mash potato was well made too.¬†

Fish and chips - The classic fish and chips but the only variation was that the fish was too thin and the batter didn't have any taste, I found this as a negative part of it and the chips they gave were french fries whereas usually fish and chips are to be accompanied with wedges.

Baileys Irish Cream cheesecake - This dessert was absolutely FANTASTIC. I could taste the irish cream in each bite and it was a delight to have this!

Service was quicky and the staff was friendly, tables are slightly small but it's manageable. Do visit.

For photos of places where I eat in Calcutta or other cities, follow me on Instagram. (Same name in both places)

The cafe has a lovely ambience. It had bern on my wishlist for months. We ordered their famed Big Bong burger and The Juicy Lucy (lamb) and Choco Decadent Mousse Cake. Both the burgers came with coleslaw and french fries. The burgers were juicy and delicious. The mousse cake was a delight. Quick service and polite staff. Reasonable prices. Looking forward to another visit soon.

The little cafe on the corner has a lot to offer. The service is prompt and the staff friendly and full of suggestions. The problem occurs when you decide to not take their advice and order something that sounds interesting. One out of the three dishes ordered was good. The other two definitely had potential but didn't match up to our expectations.  Definitely worth a visit though

A teeny cafe located just at the crossing of Chakraberia and Sarat Bose Road. This place is foodie's paradise. As soon as you make your way inside, you know you have made a great choice, the aromas inside¬†engulf you in sinful delights you are about to have.

The interior is very pretty with somehow vintage accessories makes it¬†picturesque. Adding a¬†cherry to the cake is the good music in the background making ambiance just perfect.

The attending staff was very prompt and helpful while suggesting dishes. They make you feel so special. Great experience in that front, they take care of customers very nicely.

Coming to the jewel of this place: Food. We had ordered a Margharita, Juicy Lucy veg and chicken burger, Big Bong burger, Shroominator and Bellisma fries. All of them were just made from heaven. The Chef has done a tremendous job here. These are the best burgers you'll ever have. Just like in advertisements shown on TVs, the world would literally move in slow motion when you dwell into the first bite. The fillings and patties were very well cooked with an¬†amazing combination of great ingredients used, the veggies were caramelized to perfection and the sauces gelled to whole making it a marvel. I was wooed by Juicy Lucy and the Big Bong Burger. The pizza was so so good; the pizza sauce and cheese complemented each other to fit. To all the foodies: You are about to have a big big foodgasm.¬†

Might seem a little pricey but believe me, it is definitely worth it! They make the best burgers served in great great ambiance.¬†

I would definitely try some Pasta dishes on my next visit. ¬†Thanks, BFB team! Looking forward¬†seeing you again!

This is a beautiful small cafe located opposite to The Dugout in Sarat Bose Road.
The interior is absolutely pretty and cheerful with nice music.
The staffs are friendly and explained us the dishes patiently.
We ordered a Bbq chicken wings in ghost chilli sauce which tasted awesome.
Since wraps were unavailable,we took a sub,Russian mafia.It tasted average though.
The hanging chicken skewer was the best.It tasted too good.
Dessert options are less and bellypathy was unavailable.
We had two mocktails-Kiwi frappe and mixed fruit mojito.
I really loved the mocktails.
This is a nice pretty place for hangouts.
The prices are reasonable too. üòä

A quirky food joint with an interesting decor and hospitable staff. The funky interiors really got my attention. A subtle music playing in the background, a casual ambience and a great place (not too hard on your pockets) to spend time with your family and friends.
The service is prompt and if you want to omit a few things from your choice of food (eg: I wanted mine less spicy), the staff will be obliged to do so. Being someone who barely orders veg dishes when eating out, I'd like to say the Strawberry Salad really enticed my taste buds. The non veg Cannelloni is another favourite.
A paradise for every cheese fanatic. All in all a regulars' delight! And if you are lucky enough you might even be invited by the management for a complimentary meal.

The new place in town, BFB is located on the main road at the crossing of Chakraberia and Sarat Bose Road. This destination is nothing less than every foodies dream.
Location: 5/5 the location could not be better. Set near the nightclubs, it's the perfect youth destination for after party hunger pangs. Also very conveniently being in the main road at a corner it is very easy to spot.
Service: 5/5 the service is prompt and very helpful. The suggestions offered by the manager and staff were all spot on and they make people feel at home and the experience special.
Ambience: 5/5 
The perfect youth ambience where no one feels excluded. A person can sit alone and have food but still not feel alone such is the effect. The chairs and tables are unique and the little space they have has been used tremendously well. It does not at all feel clustered.
Food: 5/5 the crowning glory of this place is the food. To anyone going there I would definitely suggest the sausages, as they are the best I have ever had. We also had the meat monster pizza. The thin crust was crispy and the ingredients extremely fresh and tasty. The Mac n Cheese was tasty and extremely well cooked as was the Premevera pasta.
Will definitely be trying the burger next time.
For such brilliant food the price was reasonable. It is the perfect foodie destination and youth hangout spot in Kolkata.

I haven't had the chance to go to the cafe and eat. But have managed to get a home delivery twice. 
I had ordered the following items:
1. The Ultimate Veg Juicy Lucy Burger
2. The Utlimate Chicken Juicy Lucy Burger 
3. Czar's Turkish Cottage Cheese Burger 
4. Fries 
5. Chocolate Shake 

My order on both the occasions was delivered in well packaged boxes. Their burgers are delicious and quite filling for one person. The chocolate shake was equally yummy. Two burgers and a shake can suffice three people's dinner.

Visited on the afternoon of December 31. The place is small, so one might have to wait for a while for a table (we waited for nearly 30 minutes till we were seated). The food is quite good, especially the meat platter. The starters (cheese sticks) and shakes are quite ordinary.

Went here on a Thursday night with friends. I loved everything about this place. Its a quaint little food joint with a power packed menu!

We chose about 8 items from the menu. This included chicken wings, pork sausages, a meaty monster pizza, a pulled pork burger, keema risotto, oreo creme shake, and a ginger orange mojito. But the highlight of the night was their bacon bomb! It was all meaty goodness! I could not fault a single dish that was placed in front of us. 

The service is as good as the food. We had a lovely experience here. As a cherry on the cake, the owner served us a complimentary chocolate mousse cake. As a dessert lover, I have no words to describe the experience! Kudos to the chefs!!

Finally a big thank you to the entire My Big Fat Belly team! So looking forward to the next visit here!

This is a small joint near in Bhawanipur. It's good for snacks and hanging out with friends. The staff is helpful and the service is quick. Coming to the food we ordered the cheesy cigars, nachos,juicy Lucy  burger , Agarwal ji burger and corn and cheese cannelloni. Completely loved the cheesy cigars..oozing with cheese and served with a red dip it was a lovely dish. The nachos were your regular nachos... maybe they can serve them with different types of dips to increase its USP. The burgers were good, fries crunchy and the salad was fresh. The juicy Lucy burger was a little spicy for my taste. The Agarwalji burger had bhujia on its side to give it a Marwari touch befitting its name. The cannelloni was well prepared..Perfect balance of the filling and the cheese.
Little pricy, but a must visit.

Located opposite dugout bhawanipore this medium sized joint is for the food lovers. Had a variety of options and the pictures on the menu make it more appealing. 
I noticed about 5 chefs working outside plus a person on the drinks counter. Also was told there are other chefs working inside. The patty they make is absolutely fresh and the burgers we had did confirm that. 
The jucy lucy burger and the grilled chicken burger both were fulfilling And very very yummy. A special mention to the beverage menu.. tried the ice lemon tea and it was really great. Service was fine. Will visit again though we were informed they will soon be shifting to a bigger location and much better quality. I had a great time here so i can only imagine what the new joint will offer .
Also the playlist was great!

When I went there last, it used to be 'The Little Donkey' then, which served mostly Mexican food. To be frank, authentic Mexican food does not go well with our Bengali palate. :3
So I'm not surprised that they had to relaunch the place to make it work.

I heard about the relaunch a few months back, and finally was able to go there yesterday for a quick lunch. And buoy, it's good!

The decor is quirky. I loved their high sittings. If you're there, just look up at the ceiling!
The stuffs are as friendly as ever. Now coming to food, we ordered:

üî∏Gooey Cheese Cigars - Well, the portions that had cheese, tasted delicious. But I expected much more cheese in it, as that's all it should and must have. So, yeah, that's quite a big disappointment there.

üî∏Big Bong Burger - I mean, cummon, this is Bengal, and you have a burger with Kosha Mangso reduction and a Dim Bhaja in it. I of course had big expectations from this one, and it definitely was not a let down. Tho tbh I was a bit skeptical, but it turned to be really delicious.

üî∏ Grilled Chicken Steak with Red Wine and Rosemary Sauce - It's one of their signature dishes. We wanted the stuffed chicken breast but since that wasn't available we went for the regular steak. It came with mashed potatoes (you can also choose rice, if you want) and saut√©ed veggies. The sauce tasted okay, the protein was soft and succulent but they didn't serve it with fried egg as mentioned in the menu.

üî∏Ginger-Orange Mojito - We wanted some latte or cappuccino, but since it wasn't available we ordered this. Apparently they do not serve hot beverages; I don't know why they included it the menu then. But anyway the drink tasted alright.

Oh, they have a nice playlist. Basically they were playing all the popular 2016 songs from YouTube. Which is way better than many other restaurants tbh. XD

Overall, it's a really nice place with decent food which does not burn a hole in the pocket. Happy eating!

A big fat 5 star Rating to My Big fat belly. The gourmet justifies the name. All the best meat you can hope for. All of it cooked very tastefully to almost perfection. Since we were a big group, we kind of had a taste of all the best things on their menu.
All the dishes were absolute stars in their own right. But their was one clear winer for me. IT was the grilled fish in gandhoraj sauce. A first for me and oh man, was I floored!!!anyone visiting this place has to absolutely try this.
Another star was the braised pork chop. This us exclusively for pork lovers. The sweet after taste will surprise you. Also everyone should try their pork and chicken sausages in bfb sauce. The desserts were good as well. But not much to choose from.
Since this is a cute small place, taking a big group out there may not be a great idea(like we were a group of 7). But the food is definitely worth it. A special thank you to bye hostess who was very gracious in making sure we made all the right choices. She also made us feel extremely at home.
Do visit for the good vibes here. I am already looking forward to going back again.

We visited this place at night of 31st dec 2016 so this was my last eat out for 2016 and honestly i was pleasantly surprised.

Ambience is good. Nothing fancy but has a warmth of its own. Service is quick and prompt staff.

Now coming to food : We ordered prawn tarts, Pulled pork burgers, lamb burger. Also their pizza. Pork chops. The burgers were some of best i ever tasted. Full juicy barbecued filling.

Special mention. We tried their BFB special chicken wings in ghost chilly. Hotness level we took Phaadu .. it was raining fire in mouth. It was yes very tasty but the heat was unbearable. I usually am very tolerant to high hotness in food but i was about to break down. I would suggest keep the level to medium. Phaadu level is for very brave people.. ;)

Warm place to grab your meal along with close friends.
Must visit.

I had recently come across this suggestion on Zomato and yesterday thought of trying it out with my friends. First things first, this place will blow you away with the ambience. The seatings, the lights, the decor, the slow music, even the open view counter where you get to see your food coming it all its glory, this little place gives you all the right feels. The ambience gets full marks. Your expectations about the food can reach sky high just by the sheer look of the place. And it doesn't disappoint. Almost.
There were three of us. And we ordered 1 Cheese cigars, 1 BFB special chicken wings in Ghost Chilly sauce for starters. The cheese cigars were okay and if you've tasted cheese balls then you'd know exactly how they'd taste. The chicken wings were on the other hand, beyond expectation. I LOVED THEM. But a BIG disclaimer: it's spicy. WAY TOO HOT. And not many can handle it. Since I am crazy about chillies, it was the best I could have hoped for. You could however, always ask them to skip the extra spicy part. The sauce is wonders. And if you have a little adventurous spirit in you, just go ahead. Have it and you'll have one great time.
Then we went for burgers. I had a chicken grilled burger. My friends had one Juicy Lucy (veg) and another Big Bong (lamb). They were all good but the Big Bong burger has a bit of a gravy that gets a bit tough to eat with time as it's burger and it's messy already when you're rating a burger so the gravy makes it even harder as it keeps dropping down. The coleslaw was perfect and so was the mayo. You'd be surprised how very few places get their mayo right. That's right.
We ended it all with a pizza. We ordered a Pesto and we removed the pine nuts and asked them to add Avocados. So that was a good decision as avocados are always a good decision. :)

Overall the food was great and the management was very cordial and warm. They would greet you and readily suggest you for their best signature dishes. This cozy little place has always become one of my favourites in the city.

P.S. uploading only one photo as we were too hungry to even remember taking more photos! That's a compliment, BFB. :)

Situated on Sarat Bose Road, this restaurant sports a relatively small and unusual menu, but whatever they serve is delicious & will linger on your mind for a long time! We tried the panko fried tiger prawns (which were okay-ish), the bigbong burgers, grilled chicken steak in mushroom sauce, fish n chips, grilled fish in gondhoraj chilly lemon sauce and the day's special baileys cheese cake along with a chocolate mousse cake! Everything was more or less nice , but the fish and the desserts were pretty good! The decor is interesting and the ambience is colourful and positive! Being situated on the main road,Parking becomes a little issue sometimes but that shouldn't stop you from trying this place out!

My first brush with MBFB proved rewarding. Though we tried just 2 items a Fish n Chips and a Lamb Burger with all the fixings, we enjoyed it thoroughly. The Fish n Chips was ok but the Juicy Lucy Lamb Burger was melt in your mouth goodness. In my opinion, In my opinion it is best Lamb Burger in town. Can't wait to try the rest of the items on their menu.

To start with, the place is really cosy and the interiors are trendy. The service was prompt and polite. But the best part about this place is the kind of food they offer. They have a wide range of cuisines on their menu and each of them have a certain uniqueness to it. We ordered bruschettas, kebabs and a chicken burger. Each of which did complete justice to our expectations. I would love to visit this place again.

Location : Just opposite Dugout, Bhawanipur.

The Little Donkey gave way to this new Tex-Mex caf√© and people of this city are going crazy over it. I've been hearing so much about this caf√© that I finally decided to pay this caf√© a visit with few of my friends. The caf√© is not too big with a seating capacity of maximum of 25-26. I loved the D√©cor; from the¬†round wooden tables to the chairs to the walls everything had a very rustic feel to it.

Mocktails :

*Kiwi frappe & watermelon mojito : both were amazing and the presentation was lovely!

Food :

*Panco fried prawns : This was soo GOOD. The shrimps were nicely fried with panko bread crumbs giving it a lovely crispy texture. The flavours were amazing.

*Al¬†Funghi Pizza : Nice and thin crust¬†, but not crispy which I loved. The cheese¬†and mushrooms¬†used were of very¬†good quality.

*Al Pachino Pizza : This pizza was topped with generous amounts of mozzarella.The mozzarella was so fresh and lovely., had a super creamy texture. This pizza was again fantastic.

*Big Bong Burger :¬† This is the much talked about burger of this caf√©. The patty is made of minced mutton cooked in Indian spices : 'Kosha mangsho' style ( Bengali mutton curry).¬† The burger was super juicy and I loved the richness of the mutton. Full marks for the fries and the onion rings.

* Chicken Juicy Lucy burger : This burger was again very tasty. And I loved how they insert a fried egg in each burger.

*Lamb shank : Loved it. The shank was served with mashed potato and gravy. The gravy was rich and divine. The lamb was cooked perfectly, the meat was falling off the bone. The mash was creamy and tasty.

*Grilled prawns served with sauted veggies and Mexican rice : Awesomely delicious!

* Strawberry cheesecake : This was the cheesecake of the day. I loved it. It was nice and creamy, the biscuit bas was nice and hard and not crumbly. The strawberry compote cuts through the richness of the cream cheese and tastes delicious.

* Squidgy brownie : Who doesn't love brownie with ice cream ? 

Service : The staff is very courteous and attentive. 

This place sure bags a recommendation from me.

I am overwhelmed to write the 100th review on Zomato and what better to review a place that's close to my heart and an inspiration too ! As the name sounds, My Big Fat Belly is a proper indulgence to all those Belly Bangers of the city who craves for "Tex-Mex". A 30-35 seater outlet, with a cool decor and an electric ambiance, MBFB is all set to be a horse of a big race.
Myself, with my wife dropped into this outlet a month back on a lazy Sunday afternoon to analyse whether its truly worth the hype or not. And by god, it truly emerged out as one of the best dine-outs I ever experienced in their genre of cuisine !¬†
Following are the food we ordered along with their reviews :
1. MBFB Special Chicken Wings with Ghost Chilly Sauce - Tasted okay but didn't touched the strings of my heart. :) Needed a more zip and tang to it.¬†
2. The ultimate Juicy Lucy Burger - Undoubtedly the best burger I have EVER had ! And I mean it ! It was so good that I had re-ordered it even though I was almost full. :)
3. Grilled Chicken Steak with Rosemary Sauce - The steak taste magnificent with the sauce adding an insanely brilliant flavour to it. However the rice with it should have been a bit more softer and juicier.¬†
4. Kiwi Mojito - In one word, INSANE !
5. Orange and Ginger Mojito - Another masterpiece of a mocktail I have ever had. Washed me down and refreshed me to the core !
A generic review on food - they are all made with fresh raw materials and with the best of cheese, butter and oil possible, and I coming from the same industry can feel it from the core.
Coming to the service and hospitality, the service staffs were very courteous and were up on their toes striving for the best. Such a hospitality drives a customer to revisit a place, not once but a many more times. A special thanks to Aakarsh Bhargava and his team for upholding the customer experience to what it is today and I would urge him not to loosen up the shackles of perfection in every department of this outlet, like it is at this very moment.¬†
Take a bow MBFB, take a bow ! I am coming again very soon !

Read some really great reviews here and decided to order the Mushroom Smroominator Burger for home delivery. However highly disappointed with the food and 70 minutes delivery which rendered the food cold. Very oily & bland patty, without much garnishing or flavors. Only saving grace was the sides of fries and onion rings which were done well.
Absolutely not worth it for this price point.

Everything was just excellent ! Just awesome! And in the end...the dessert was like a cherry to the top with the Strawberry Cheese Cake and Brownie.....

I have been away from zomatp for quite sometime now ... but i had to return for rating this one ... situated at the chakraberoa sarat bose road crossing and bang opposite to The Dugout this little cafe serves the best pork sausages in town...   though we did not  order any of there signature burgers but i still can rate this place a well deserved perfect 5. The pepporoni pizza was once again delicious and did I forget to mention their super delectable squidzy brownie shake ...ohhh yummmm... the eggless chocolate mousse cake was just okay...
The place is small and was decked up in the xmas decor... perfect for hangouts ... and not to forget the extremly well behaved staff ... n the courteous owner bid us goodbye as well ... 
Lastly i do believe this place has some connection with The little donkey coz i do remember noticing something in their signboard outside... 
suggestions- please add more dessert options..
I m definitely returning for those extravagant burgers and the pork chops...

Yes, another place worth giving a 5 in Zomato, because it deserves it. The things I tried, were way out of explanation. Service(9.5/10); Ambiance(10/10)
They're as follows

‚òÖKiwi Frappe(9.5/10): Perfectly sweetened and presented, a sliced kiwi serving as its lid. Serves 2 in winter.
‚ú©Watermelon Mojito(10/10): This is remarkable. Perfect mixture of ingredients with a light spicy goodness.
‚òÖPoached Pear Salad(8/10): A decent salad.

‚òÖPanko Fried Prawns(10/10): Brilliantly cooked Prawn has its own domination in the restaurants, this is the king.
‚ú©Al Funghi Pizza(9/10): Another delicious and worthy item in the menu. Try it.
‚òÖBig Bong Burger(9.5/10): If you love Lamb and you're a bong, this is your day! Mind you, this oozes out a lot of juicy sauces on the first few bites.
‚ú©Al Pachino Pizza(12/10): Yes 12, because this is the best thin crust pizza I've ever had and its Wondrous, trust me.
‚òÖChicken Jucy Lucy Burger(10/10): The patty is delicious and with other additions, this steals the show. You get fries and crispy onion rings with the burgers.
‚ú©Lamb Shank(9/10): Served with mashed potatoes. Tastes really good.
‚òÖGrilled Prawn(10/10): This is a wholesome meal and served with rice. This is awesome.

‚ô°Strawberry Cheesecake(10/10): My first time, and I loved it. You must order this for your dessert.

‚ô°Squidgy Brownie with Ice cream(10/10) Though this is common, every place has its unique touch. This place too, in its brownies.

You won't regret your visit to this place. After the items mentioned below, my belly has got more fat.

Located opposite Dugout on Sarat Bose Road, visited this place to try out the Burger Challenge but upon looking at its size on the menu, we decided to settle for our willingness to go back home instead of a doctor's clinic and ordered a Gardinere Pizza, a BFB Mac n Cheese and one Cold Coffee with Ice Cream Pitcher. Words are not enough to describe how blown off we were with the Mac n Cheese. It was better than my expectations. 4.5/5. The pizza was another surprise but not as mind-blowing as the Mac n Cheese. The crust was thin and crispy and the toppings and cheese made the entire pizza marvelous. Deserves a 4/5. The Cold Coffee pitcher was enough to feed 4 people. Given its price, I found it completely satisfying. 4.5/5.
Though this place is not very spacious, I liked the decor and the chairs. It looked like a Mini European roadside cafe with beautiful lights. 
Waiting to visit this place again to try out its burgers.

Passion is the word that I would most associate with Aakarshh and Adarsh Bhargava. I first met them at Streets of India at Swabhumi a few weeks back. I had heard a very positive buzz about My Big Fat Belly or BFB as they refer to it. I liked my interaction with them and I promised to visit soon. A few days later I was on Zomato and bookmarked them and I immediately got a call from them inviting me over. We fixed up for dinner a few days later and boy am I glad I did!

I would recommend both of them. The molten cheese in Mac n cheese will fill your mouth with joy! The interiors are pleasant and so are the staff on duty. Would surely come back for more !

Located at the heart of the city in Sarat Bose road opposite dugout cafe. 
The ambience is really cosy and good. The staff is courteous and the cafe is really well managed.
We ordered a Chicken juicy Lucy Burger, Meaty monster pizza and Gajjar ka halwa cheese cake. 
The burger was really sumptuous and juicy as the name suggests. The pizza was thin crust which had toppings of chicken salami,bacon and caramelized onions.It was perfect.
Needn't describe about the cheese cake..One should definitely give it a try.It was out of the world.
Overall, it was a lovely experience.

Gist : Bit pricy but taste worthy, Great Decor, Cozy place good seating arrangement. Today's Special available. Challenges to be accepted!

I visited this place on 22.12.16 around 2.30PM. Easy to locate. Staff & Owner was cordial. Decor was great (even washroom). Place is not big but they manage to arrange 4+4+4 seats at normal height & 4+4+2 seats for higher. Serving time is more than burger king or KFC but still good. Ordered The Ultimate Juicy Lucy - lamb with bacon & chicken. Was eager to take the Big Belly Challenge but if you take 45 minutes to prepare a burger how it can be eaten in 20 minutes ? If things are balanced challenge will definitely be accepted. Will visit again to try other items.

First of all the price estimate given by Zomato isn't very accurate. 3 mains and 2 desserts for 2 adults and a child was sufficient, and the cost was north of Rs. 1500. 

Ambience will be enjoyed by the younger generations, not, quite so much for the older generation. Limited seating. 

Food was excellent, even though, i felt the taste and quantity for money of the weekly specials wasn't up to mark. The pricing of the food on the menu is reasonable.

Its a small eatery,albeit a well decorated one. There's an open kitchen...and quirky posters to add to the vibe.
The service is good. I had the sausages,juicy Lucy lamb burger and Bacon bob. The burger was awesome,perfectly juicy with an egg with a gooey centre.The sausages were cut and stir fried ,which kind of overpowered the actual taste of the pork sausages. The bacon bob was tasty but the portion was too small. The dishes were well presented,though.
I'd give this place a thumbs up for being a good burger and shake joint.

Had planned my anniversary dinner here, called in for reservations (on a Thursday night, not a typical rush day for a restaurant) and they said they are full and there is a 15-20mins average wait time, so they are unable to take reservations!
The last time I heard this in Calcutta, was at Mocambo or Peter Cat! 
For a joint that has just opened up 3 months now, this is unheard of.
We dropped the plan that day, not wanting to wait on our anniversary, but visited the very next Saturday, more out of curiosity, and well, were pleasantly surprised.
With seating for about 20-24 people well managed in 580sqft, with a warm nostalgia stimulating ambiance; which felt very much like old Calcutta(set aside the large TV üòÜ) the place was bustling with patrons, with 2 couples already waiting outside.
We finally got a table after 15mins or so. 
Seating is tightly arranged due to space, but even my wife who is claustrophobic, did not feel uncomfortable for once. In fact, it felt quite warm and cozy.
The food is broadly continental, had a bold bong flavor, reminded me a bit of Bohemian, but set itself quite apart.
4 of us adults literally gorged on 4 starter dishes, 3 main course items, a dessert, and 2 pitchers of drinks! The quantity was quite good with relatively standard prices; none of us can be classified as 'petuk', yet the food was so good we just kept gorging. (But it was really light, none of us felt bloated or had indigestion.)
Their sausages are home made, are unbelievably tasty and a must try! The Bengali style Keema Risotto(I know it sounds weird, but they've literally outdone themselves here) was the best I've ever had in Kolkata. It was a heartwarming soul filling dish that I could wrap in my arms under a blanket on a cold winter night and keep having forever. Prawn tarts were a burst of flavors and textures in your mouth that has been put together just right.
I loved the idea of pitchers(served 4) of ice teas and mojitos that cost just 150-200. They were a great compliment to the food, and the low prices meant we could afford to try out other dishes.
We spoke to the owner and personally thanked the chef at the end of the meal for gifting Calcutta such a wonderful restaurant.
My best wishes for them to do well and maintain the awesome food so we may keep visiting in the years to come.

A super cute and cozy restaurant on Sarat Bose Road. I found their menu very exciting, and it was an easy decision to go. We had the cheese chilli cigars (they had the pocket version that day), nachos, a veggie pizza, an oreo shake and a kick ass iced tea. All pretty good fare. We ended with the chocolate mousse cake which turned out to be a hard set block of chocolate, not my favorite way to eat it. But, it was a good meal overall and it's always wonderful to meet a passionate proprietor :) Definitely going back some time to try the burgers.

Headed to this place last night with a bunch of my friends and loved the d√©cor: basic clean cool toned interiors with a wooden touch. Pleasantly surprised with the moderately raised stools and the semi dim lighting we dived right into the food. This place is primarily known for its delicious humongous burgers but we decided to give the other items a try and see if they stood up to our expectations and really good reviews.

 Panko fried tiger prawns: Crispy deep fried prawns, nothing more, nothing less.

Chicken steak with BFB sauce: Taste was good, quantity was definitely not overwhelming.

BFB non veg platter: The  absolute highlight of the night, the in-house sausages blow your mind with their flavours.

Grilled fish in gondhoraj chilli lemon cr√®me:  A stand-alone great addition to the menu, refreshing with nice flavours but seemed too bland compared to the in-house BFB sauce that my friends were having with their dishes. Hence one shouldn't combine flavours with other items while having it.

Staff was very courteous and overall a satisfying experience. Deducting 1 point  for portion size of non burger food items.

It's hard to critique a restaurant so well rounded. Walking in, all the reviews you've read just sort of walk out the back door. It's hardly a proper restaurant, rather a well run eatery. The essentials of good food are ever-present however.

The d√©cor is as apt as the music is. They play the Bee Gees and Michael Jackson 24/7 and it's well equalised to suit a dinner space. The restaurant is small, but well furnished. An open kitchen is present, which always adds to the flavour. The service is strong, friendly, professional. The waiters are quick to suggest items, but stick to the burgers and the starters. A BIG shout out to Abhishek (man who served us); great experience with him!

The food is where MBFB excels. The shakes are massive and there is nothing to fault it with. The brownie shake packs a punch and is packed with ice cream and milk. If you like your sweets, you'll love this! The burgers are their essentials. Everything is edible but you'll notice what sounds the best, is the best. The Bong Burger and the Lamb Speciality Burger (names?) are the standout. When it comes to dessert, try out everything. They make a mean ice cream and brownie dish.

When it comes to value for money, 1200 for 2 is an expected bill amount. This'll include a starter, a couple burgers, a dessert and a shake. That should fill up most of you heavy eaters.

Ambience/Interiors: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Food: 4.5/5
Value for Money: 4/5

Thanks for reading and pardon any grammatical errors I may have made.

Visited this place on a Tuesday night with some friends. Had heard good things about the place so went with high expectations. The first disappointment was with the menu. Most items that we wanted to order were unavailable. The starter we ordered (Goeey Cheese Fingers) was average at best and came served with a strawberry sauce that just tasted weird. The burgers (our second choices since the first was unavailable) were good although. The best thing about the place was value for money... Nice to see a place give off the feel of an American diner without fleecing customers...

Can a burger be so good that you have to pinch yourself to believe it? Thats what I had to do at MBFB on my first visit there. The Big Bong Burger is the best burger I have ever eaten! I am not a huge fan of red meat but I never knew that the combination of soft and juicy kosha mangsho and soft burger buns could be that good! Its pure genius. 

The MBFB Special Chicken Wings in Ghost Chilli Sauce were delicious and I like the fact that they have options for portion sizes. 
Service is good and the owner himself helped us with the order and actually recommended the Big Bong Burger. We paid about INR 950 for the burger, chicken wings, two drinks and a dessert and it was well worth it. I highly recommend this place, specially if you have an knack for kosha mangsho!

I visited this place with a friend of mine , based on the reviews on Zomato. We had ordered for a Ultimate Juicy Luicy Burger and a Big Bong Burger( Lamb)
The big bong burger was very juicy and tasty.. the burger bun was soft and with every bite you take, you would be using the tissue paper to wipe your face( provided you don't want to eat In a messy manner), that's how juicy the burger is. The Ultimate Juicy Luicy was pretty good as well, but I wasn't too happy with the patty in it.. was a little over cooked and had dried.. but the patty was well seasoned and tasted good. We also had the Caramel shake, which was okay okay.. it lacked the punch of caramel flavours.. the staff is very courteous..
You sure would improve a lot, wish you all the best for your restaurant.

The fried chicken couldve used a little more flavour I guess. And for drinks we had 1 ice tea,1oreo shake, 1cold coffee and and 3 were equally good.

Melt in the mouth stuff. ¬†I followed it up with the Juicy Lucy, incredibly succulent . Rivals anything I have had in India or abroad. My wife had the Bacon bomb - she loved that too. Was too full to go to dessert. Need to go there in the starving state next. Super ambiance, prompt service and great suggestions. Going back with all my meat lover friends.

I had been eyeing this place for some time hoping to try the some American food. Finally got to try it today and was not disappointed at all. I had a few different things such as the cheese cigars and the butterscotch and caramel milkshake  which were really good but the best was the meaty monster. I was talking to my friend who had tagged along for a meal so it got cold but still didn't lose its flavor or crispness which just shows how well it was made. Also got to try some of the juicy juicy burger cause of my friend which was tasty too. The ambience of restaurant was really nice and went well with the American style food. The staff were also really nice and I got to have a chat with the owner of the place as well who described the food and you could see the passion in his words in making the restaurant fit his ideals. The restaurant completely deserves the ratings and I'm planning to visit again in the near future. Kolkata needs more places like this.

Gujrati mithayee a very subtle drink beautifully flavoured with safron..Veg bruschetta a combo of 3 different toppings simply well blended freshness and true flavours of each ingredient used, Juicy lucy burger ooh it was the show stopper..amazingly juicy as it says in the menu.
Chocolate mousse was just perfect. The place looks insane with doors on the roof..to sum it up it was a brilliant experience would definitely recommend to all my friends and yaa the do have a pure veg selection which is very mindful of the owner to establish in this area.‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏èÔ∏è

One of the best restaurant I have tried recently. I wish I could give them over than 5 here. Everything is perfect out here. Starting from they welcome the guests to how quickly everything is done and so perfectly. The order was given on the table within minutes. Food was fantastic literally it was divine. I wish I could have ordered more but i was full. We ordered herb fried chicken, ultimate juicy lucy burger., squidgy with brownie shake. Squidgy brownie shake was big and tasted best I had recently. The best thing about this place is that price is so cheap here. The quality quantity you get here is just unimaginable. Ambience is cute. I wish the place could accommodate more. I request them to maintain this standard always and I will have no doubt that this place will be the best fast food restaurant in Kolkata. I  am sure about hitting this place quite often now.

Did you ever overeat and still continue to eat even when your stomach is saying I can't take more, but somewhere your heart says "This is just too good, bring it on". This place gave me the exact feeling when I went and had some delicious food. I couldn't resist myself gulping everything down whatever came on the table. My Big Fat Belly is heaven for foodies. A place where you would get variety, a place where you would get a twist in the dish making it unique.

WHERE IS IT?
My Big Fat Belly is located in Sarat Bose Road, just opposite to Dugout. The name written with bright yellow alphabets will help you to find the place much more easily.

HOW IS THE AMBIANCE AND DECOR?
A small place with not a big sitting capacity. but the decor of this place is quirky with proper lighting. The entire ceiling done with old doors and the lamp shades customized very differently. The rough walls complimenting the entire decor.

I quite liked their menu and we being meat lovers thought it to be must to visit this restaurant... they have a really nicely mentioned menu card by seeing which ur mouth is sure to water...
Yesterday we thought of going to this place to try some of their signature dishes... It is situated on the main road itself, and it opened in the place of The Little Donkey, opp to The Dugout.. The interior is small and cozy and pretty attractive...
Now coming to the food... We ordered
1) Sausages in Chef's signature J's BFB sauce in chicken as the starter..
And 2) Bacon Bomb
3) BFB Non Veg Grill Platter with sausages, bacon and BFB sauce..
The quantity of the starter was less as compared to the price.. However the food didnt disappoint us.. It was good and flavourful with an amazing aroma of home made,sausages..
Next were the main courses.. Well, honestly we expected a lot out of this place.. The presentation of food was really good but i somehow didnt like the bacon bomb. There was not even a full bacon covering the patty.. It was slightly disappointing and not something like a signature dish..
Secondly was the Non veg platter.. It was way better than the bacon bomb. Nicely cooked, perfect portion size and i quite liked it..
Overall, i had a descent experience.. nothing over the top but expected a bit more..

I liked their menu and the pizza they suggested (gardenia) was pretty good. Pizza was definitely better than my expectation, the loaded fries felt tasteless to me though my friend did like it. 
I did quite like the ambience of the place, the seating is more like a subway or domino's which are predominantly take out places.

FAT BELLY - The name itself scares me out thinking in a literal sense. BUT the quirkiness of the Brand name made me want to visit this place. So happened to visit it around Durga Pooja.

The Sign Board is very catchy as well as the the exterior. Stands out look wise in this area. So we enter. The interiors have a wooden cottage feel with everything wood and balanced with pretty colors. The wall white and brick-laid and is adorned by cute illustrated poster frames and art. ¬†I love brick walls. The kinky ceiling is wooden with beautiful lights. One of the attention grabbing parts were the Air Conditioners. They painted them in pretty pastel shades ! A couple of tables have ¬†innovative words on them. The lighting was perfect. Nor bright neither too dim.

So, ordered for -¬†

A BFB Margherita
A Veg Burger¬†
Veg Pasta
Don't remember the names of the Burger and the Pasta but whatever they were, they were wonderful ! :)
Had also ordered for a Cold Coffee which was equally good.¬†

Overall. A good experience. ¬†Would rate them a 4.0 based on their food, ambience and the service. :)

My Big Fat Belly is a real winner. I was looking forward to this place with high expectations, and it definitely delivered. The only thing I can complain about is that the seating is a bit less. That said, it is not like the place is uncomfortable. Anyway, the winner is the food.
Right from the outset you can see the menu here is unique. And indeed, even taste wise, you dont find the same in kolkata.
We had ordered the BFB veg grill platter, Al Fungi pizza and the Shroominator burger. Each dish left us craving for a second serving although the burger was a little cold. The veg grill platter is a must try.
The ambience and pricing is also fine(above items cost a total of 1000), making this is a place I will definitely visit again.

Quite an over-hyped place in my experience. Food here is very, very average.

Went there on a busy Saturday afternoon, the ambience is good but it's a really small space with barely 7-8 tables. The decor is innovative and welcoming with a cosy, pub feeling.

We tried their chilly cheese cigars (now comes in jacket shapes), the juicy Lucy burger and the shroominator burger.
The chilly cheese 'jackets' taste pretty good especially with the chilly strawberry sauce (which seemed to be essentially strawberry syrup with chilly pepper and dashes of salt). The burgers were nowhere mention worthy. There are much, much better burgers to be found and enjoyed in this city at a similar price range. The buns were greasy. The shroominator was bland and the juicy Lucy was no good either apart from the Monterey Jack cheese addition.

It isn't too bad a space to spend some good time if the food was any impressive. They have quite a varied menu I'm sure I'll be coming back to try more.

Me and my sister looked up this place on zomato and actually walked in with zero expectations. But my, oh, my, were we pleasantly surprised! Starting from the 'not trying too hard at all, cozy' ambience to the heavenly good food, everything is perfect about My Big Fat Belly. 

We ordered the BFB fish and chips, the big bong burger, grilled chicken steak with herbed rice, and brownie with ice cream for dessert. Every item was simply yum! Even the dips served with the fish and chips were very tasty. But the dish to die for is definitely the big bong burger. And, this is coming from someone who is not a burger person at all. It was delicously juicy and left us wanting for more.
 
A special mention for their service and the lovely owners. They just added up to the warmth and pleasantness of the place.

We left the place feeling content and happy. I am definitely coming back here again. And for food as glorious as this, I don't mind a little fat belly!

Small cute place which is a complete bliss for ur foodie soul n belly. Only negative thing about this place is their cramped seating arrangement. Apart from this everything is too good. This restaurant is run by an extremely cheerful and ever smiling family. Now the best part is their food. We tried pork sausage in chefs spl sauce , chicken wings and cream of corn soup for starters. Each n every dish were perfectly balanced n lipsmacking good. Then we tried their famous juicy Lucy burger and bong burger. Big size burgers will satisfy ur belly and soul. All this with a mixed fruit mojito peacher. Our belly were too full to try their desserts. One of the must visit place.

It's one of those bad times when I had landed up in a restaurant and they didn't had FOOD. well. Unlucky me, unlucky BFB. 

As soon as I entered the much awaited visit, we immediately ordered Jacket Cheese Potatoes, which I had longed to eat. Then we came to know that the burner was under service and the gas cylinder was missing. So, no food for me. 

Still had that cheese potatoes and bean tarts along with a butterscotch mocktail. Food, was Wow. Service was great. Just the bad time. Nothing else. 

Will definitely come again to try other items.

I was wondering how did My Big Fat Belly make such a high score within such a short span on Zomato. On visiting this place last Tuesday with my friends, I realized that it was no wonder actually. They have done such a brilliant job! It is located at the heart of Puddopukur area, earlier where Little Donkey used to be. A small quirky place with an even quirkier d√©cor resembling an American tavern with high chairs and similar accessories around the corner, I loved this place from the beginning till the end. All of their items are homemade. Yes, including the sausages, a few oils and the sauces. We had lots of things that day and each of them were better than the previous one. The items were ‚Äì 

Drinks ‚Äì Peach Iced Tea and Virgin Mojito. Both of them were excellent, perfect flavours and presentation was brilliant as well.

Appetizers ‚Äì

Grilled Wings in Ghost Chilli Sauce ‚Äì Chicken wings in their house special sauce. A statutory warning : this sauce is really spicy but you can ask them to customize it for you according to your taste buds. The taste was excellent. Loved it very much.

Home Made Chicken and Pork Sausages in J‚Äôs BFB Sauce ‚Äì These sausages just blew away my mind. These are not the usual ones as they get all of their sausages done by the house special recipe. It comes with some dressing and taste even better with a homemade unique strawberry chilli sauce. Brilliant!

Panko Crusted Prawns ‚Äì The prawns tasted so fresh. Frying was done perfectly. Went very well with the wasabee mayo sauce. A must have at My BFB!

We had four varieties of Pizza that day. Pizza Al Funghi, Pizza Al Pacino, Margherita and Meaty Monster. Each one of them was brilliant. The toppings were adequate. The crust was so thin yet perfectly baked. Loved every bit of all the pizzas. If you ask about my personal favourite, then this would be Al Funghi and Meaty Monster.

Main Course ‚Äì 

Trust me, we were too full by this time. But the food here was so good that we couldn‚Äôt resist ourselves and hogged into the next course like foodie beasts. And that too, kept us mesmerized as well. 

Aglio Olio with Prawns ‚Äì Among all the pastas I have, Aglio Olio being my favourite, I fell in love with it. The prawns were actually shrimps and they were so good. The garlic bread served as accompaniment went very well and literally melted inside my mouth. An excellent dish it was!

Big Bong Burger ‚Äì A fusion connection of the American burger and Bangali classic Kosha Mangsho. Can you imagine how close it can be connected to a Bangali‚Äôs heart when there is Kosha Mangsho in it? The fusion was brilliant and I loved every bit of it.

Chicken Juicy Lucy ‚Äì This was a burger with a beautiful patty and each one of us in the group devoured it humongously. 

The onion rings and french fries did pretty well and the presentation of the platter was excellent.

Bacon Bomb ‚Äì Oh! What a beauty it was! Balls of mashed potato containing minced meat, wrapped by bacon in a brownish red sauce created all the drama inside my mouth and my tummy. My BFB calls it a Carnivore‚Äôs Delight doing complete justice to this beauty. 

Grilled Fish in Gondhoraj Cream with Herbed Rice and Vegetables ‚Äì Pure Kolkata Bhetki in Gondhoraj Cream Sauce along with the rice and vegetables. I personally didn‚Äôt prefer this dish a lot after having so many brilliant dishes. But I must say the fish was very fresh, the dish was made very well. If you‚Äôre a fish lover, you gonna love this.

Desserts ‚Äì 

Decadent Chocolate Mousse ‚Äì This rum infused beautiful chocolate mousse was absolutely fantastic. The dish came in and vanished like magic. All of us loved it. Being a teetotaler, the essence of rum didn‚Äôt bother me much, rather it acted like a catalyst to devour the mousse.

Squidgy Chocolate Brownie ‚Äì The classic brownie with vanilla ice cream. Loved the brownie as it was fudgy yet gooey and soft. Acted as a brilliant climax to this beautiful sumptuous dinner.

My BFB experience was fantastic. This place is definitely recommended to people from every category as they serve excellent food with a touch of uniqueness in the flavours, recipes and combinations at a very good price. My only suggestion is if they could add some fruity dessert in the menu. Rest kept assured, this place will soon be leading the food scenario of Kolkata. Best wishes to Team BFB! Happy Dining! :)

My Big Fat Belly surely makes my big fat belly very very happy! This is situated just opposite Dugout on Sarat Bose Road. It's a tiny place but truly delivers. The decor is great and the staff is very friendly.

For starters ordered the cheesy pockets which were delicious! Next we ordered the Meaty Monster Pizza. Thin crust and loaded with meat. Loved it! Also had the peach iced tea and the brownie shake.

Loved this place and will surely visit again :)

2nd Visit: Tried the herb crusted chicken- could've been better. 
Shroomy pasta- Bang on! Loved it üíï
Arabiatta- Really good 
Juicy lucy- Delicious! Recommended for all to try.
Big Bong Burger- My favourite on the menu! üòÅ

The place was on my wishlist for a long, long time. I wanted to visit the outlet and enjoy the dining experience here. The wish came true and we were here for an evening meal! The name itself catches a lot of attention, and keeps you wondering if you have eaten enough to leave with a big, happy belly :)

The place is extremely easy to locate. The ambiance is perfect to set you out on a long chit chat filled evening against yellow lights and humble owners. The owners visit your table and guide you through the menu. In fact, you would need some help because there is so much to try, you let them pick the best for you!

What to order:

Grilled Wings in Ghost Chilly Sauce: The best wings ever. The meat is cooked to perfection. You sink your teeth and the meat falls off the bones. The sauce can be adjusted to suit your level of ghostliness!! They have these interactive competitions whereby within a stipulated time you have to finish the wings etc. It's fun, it's interactive, and leaves you happy!

Home Made Chicken and Pork Sausages in J's BFB Sauce: At one point, I was so grossed with the super market tasteless bland sausages I used to rush to New Market for the masala sausages. But now, BFB is my next go to place! The sausages are thick, and cooked to perfection. They make it in-house with their spice mixes. The sausages are then mixed in their house sauces and veggies for the final output. Best ever, recommended.

Pizza Al Funghi: The thinnest crust pizzas ever. The bread is perfect so are the toppings and do not forget to add their chilli oil on the pizza. Sit back and enjoy. This one's a vegetarian version. Down it with some green apple iced tea!

Meaty Monster: A thin crust pizza loaded with chicken salami, chicken sausage, bacon. This one's a winner!

For the mains, don't forget to order their:

Aglio Olio with Prawns: Aglio Olio is essentially pasta cooked in olive oil, some garlic, some capers (sometimes), chilly flakes and cheese grates. Add some prawns to that and voila! A sea food pasta is ready. Best eaten hot, the taste is spot on. Recommended.

Bacon Bomb: The name says it all. A bomb shaped dish whereby the meat is wrapped with bacon strips. innovative, no complaints on the taste. Do order.

However much full your belly maybe, you must, must order their best burgers - Big Bong Burger, a kosha mangsho based burger where there is only meat and meat unlike other places, and their Chicken Juicy Lucy, the meat is juicy and leaves you craving for more. Served with the best ever eaten onion rings and fries.

Grilled Fish (Bhetki) in Gandhoraj Herb Creme served with Herb Rice and Sauteed Veggies: The quantity is overwhelming. The fish is crusted on the outer surface and soft and perfectly cooked from the inside. Laced with the thin but not runny gondhoraj sauce teamed with the rice is a clear winner. Definitely recommended.

**Desserts**

A good meal ends with hearty desserts, and these guys take it to a different notch all together.

Decadent Chocolate Mousse Cake: An eggless dessert. The dessert is huge, fluffy and does not kill you with over sweetness. With a nice designed tempered chocolate to finish off the presentation, recommended.

Squidgy Brownie with Ice Cream: The brownie is gooeeyy, squidgy, chocolatey, soft yet hard. The perfectly baked brownies served with a dollop of vanilla ice cream. Pocket pinch is unimaginably reasonable.

The next big thing in Kolkata is the BFB, the place is quite small, 24 seater BUT the food quality makes up for everything else. Kudos team BFB, please continue running the show as you have been and advanced 3 months birthday wishes for the team!! :)

The best part about this place is the quality of food and the personal touch provided by the owner. We went their with our family for lunch. Getting a table for 6 took quite some time so we waited and the owner took care that the elederly could sit inside and offered us water etc...so overall definitely a good effort to tske personal care of the customers..
Food was nice and well presented. Fish and chips were crumb fried so not the usual batter fry that one might expect however it tasted nice and the fish was of a good quality. Chicken wings were served in a dainty tray shaped like a guitar! Bacon bomb was so so. Veg caesar salad tasted good with grated cheese.  The cold coffee and brownie shake were both quite good. Salted lime soda had too much salt so we sent it back asking for a change.
Staff is very courteous and smiling. Space crunch might be the only issue here. However with the quality of food at the prices listed it is definitely a place I will want to revisit.
Advice..go with enough time in hand so that even if you have to wait you can spend time with your near ones chatting..and of course be prepared to waot for a while if you are in a group.

Located where the Little Donkey used to be(still miss that place),the ambiance and service is top notch. The family that owns the cafe was present and very friendly. Special mention to the son who thoroughly encouraged us to come back again for their epic food challenges.

The Thin crust pizza was crispy and loaded with meat. Their chilli oil is yum.
The Juicy Luicy Chicken burger was moist and delicious.
The Chicken Steak with Rosemary Juis had the perfect subtle flavours needed.
The gooey cheese cigars were as promised,gooey and cheesy
We had an unusual dish of french fries with cheese and chicken strips,even that,contrary to my expectations was delicious.
Downed it all with the bull pitcher. Why is it green in colour though?
The bill was 2088/- for 4 people
Overall,great experience.

This is among those places where you revisit only because you simply can't ignore its delicacy.
They probably serve the best burgers I have come across in our entire city. My favourite- Shroominator. 
However there was just one thing I did not like about it, that I went there twice within a month but they could not fix their coffee machine.
Apart from that its a great place to chill.

The place has grown to be one of my favourites in the span of last few months. Not only does it serve some pretty good stuff, but the whole setting is so cosy and the service so personal. After a couple of visits, the servers already know what you want, whether you want extra ice cream in your shake or no ice in your iced tea. That is the kind of service a lot other places in the city lack today, and these are the exact things that make me love this place a little more every time.

When I first dropped into My Big Fat Belly, the menu just took me over by surprise, and left me confused as to what to order. But I was soon guided to some of the most appetizing dishes on the menu by the management. Some of my favourite picks from the menu ever since, have been the chicken wings in ghost chilli sauce (I keep it at a medium), the prawn cocktail tarts, gooey cheese cigars, and a bunch of other appetizers.

The Burgers and the pizzas served here are in a whole different league all together. The Chicken Juicy Lucy and the Big Bong are my favourites. I can almost feel the melt-y cheese in the juicy lucy flood my mouth, whenever I think of it.

When it comes to Pizzas, The BFB Margharita, Pesto-Pesto, Al-Funghi and Al- Pachino are my favourites. The crisp, thin crust, the wonderful in house tomato sauce teamed with all those fresh and delicious toppings, makes these pizzas one of the finest in the city. Don‚Äôt forget to drizzle a bit of their in house chilli oil on top of the pizza before sinking your teeth into one.

Whenever you drop into the place, let the management guide you through the menu, you‚Äôll get the best food on the table.

Got the opportunity to try their Kosha Manghso burger @StreetsofIndia , packed the burger for maa who loved every bit of the flavour and the taste. Will surely visit the outlet to try more burgers.
Well after tasting their burgers in #SOI, I  went to their  restaurant and was really bellified..
Starters
Grilled Wings in Ghost Chilly Sauce-This starter is spl as the sauce is made with bhut jolokia known for being one of the hottest chillies in the world. Thus this is apt for those who love their food to be hot and spicy.
Chicken and Pork Sausage in BFB's spl sauce - A  wholesome dish that I fell in love with . What made this all the special for me was the fact that the sausage were made in house.
Pablo Crusted Prawn- A perfect dish for all the prawn lovers.
Pizzas
BFB has a wide variety of pizzas to offer. The pizzas are thin crusted,  with an over dose of veggies and meat and cheese. You have Pizza All Fungi, Pizza All Pacino ,Margherita, and Meaty monster to choose from.
Main course
Big bong burger -One of their best burgers and in the words of the owners it's their tribute to Bengal. The patty is made with minced red meat, topped with fried egg.
Chicken Juicy Lucy- perfect burger for all those chicken lovers.
All the burgers comes with onion rings and French fries
Bacon Bomb-A plate ready to explode in your mouth
Grfilled Fish in Gondoraj Cream with herbed rice-  Beautifully grilled bhetki in Gondoraj sauce served with herbed rice is a perfect example of fusion food. The sauce adds edge to the dish.
Dessert
Decadent Choco Mousse-A perfectly tasty mousse. I bet one will not suffice yr taste buds
Squid choco brownie- A brownie served with ice cream looks and tastes perfect!!
BFB is a perfect place for foodies who love to taste something different.

Previously this place was a Mexican joint which I have forgotten the name !!! A very cramped up place , interiors are above average , I guess you can call it nice , does not provide any ambience actually I never felt it , but you should definitely go there because of the pork , and the pork sausage too , had a nice chat with the chef and the owner of this joint , and got to know that they make their own sausage and they get their pork from Bangalore , which imyou can differentiate as the quality of pork is mouth watering and it just melts and each and every spice the flavour the Aroma you get it , a bang for your buck place , I hated the Al Pacino dish , but the rest was good !! Satisfied to say the least !

Interiors are brilliantly done! Pretty unique too!
Staff and owners are very courteous and friendly.
Now comes the food . That was great too!
We had spicy wings which lived up to its name and was amazing and the seafood Risotto was superb too. The quality is amazing.
I wish them all the best and hope they really change the idea of quantity over quality in Kolkata.

beautifully decorated eye catching interiors and the courteous waiters will definitely set your mood for a happy meal.
We ordered a juicy Lucy burger. With the flavours of lamb, bacon, cheese, egg all together exploding inside the mouth, this was the best thing I ate yesterday! We also ordered one aam admi club sandwich and 2 shakes.. every dish was perfect. The menu card is very interesting with very reasonable prices. The place is always packed with people.. so you may have to wait for sometime to get a place.. and there's a very sweet aunty who takes care of all customers and arranges seats as fast as possible.

Located in sarat bose road.. this small joint is already creating wonders and on its way to make a big success.
Good luck to all the awesome staffs :)

Seeing the good zomato ratings we decided to go to My Big Fat belly..Big fat belly gave us good food no doubt..We tried Gardinere pizza,Agarwalji & Garden treasure burgers,Pasta,Nachos and none of dem disappointed.The only let down was d service, where we had ordered d mocktails and got dem served at our table wen we were halfway thru our food and after so much followup with the servers..The space is cramped up and wen the restaurant became full it became suffocating due to poor air conditioning.

Just wished the place was a tad bigger..

A small cozy cafe run by a team of congenial staff . Food tastes good and suggestions are welcomed . So, whether it is a Sunday brunch with family or a catch-up dinner with friends ,this place is suitable for any kind of mood you are in . Oh !and definitely the Beverage pitchers are an attraction for the weather in Kolkata .

This is the kind of restaurant that ought to gladden the hearts of all Calcutta foodies ~ new, different and excellent! We had the cheese cigars, a vegetarian pasta and the non-veg platter, all of which were top-notch, and bore the marks of creative cooking rather than just being copies. Although space is a constraint, the discreet and appropriate decor evokes a trattoria, which adds to the charm of the place.  We will be back for sure!

We had been hearing about this place for far too long, to ignore it. Located on Sarat Bose Road, right at the intersection which also houses The Dugout, My Big Fat Belly is exactly what it's name sounds like - a big, generous, comforting hug of food. Despite its tiny (no really, it's almost a hole in a wall), MBFB has managed some tasteful and minimal decor, with a lot of character. I do think, however, that the space could have been utilised a little better (they have only 6 - 8 tables, which can cumulatively accommodate about 30 people).¬†

The food was phenomenal. We kickstarted with the Squidgy Brownie Shake, which was not as chunky as I would have probably liked it to be (the owner painstakingly explained to me later that their brownies were too soft to give a granular texture to the shake). We ordered their Nachos, which could have been a little more generous in their toppings, especially considering they were baked. Their tortilla chips, however, were top of the class - perfectly seasoned and super - crunchy. Their staff recommended the Al Pacino Pizza (a word here - the stewards are really thorough with their menu, and go out of their way to suggest recommendations. I would suggest that you follow them, they seem to have clear star performers). The pizza was perfect - thin crust, good toppings, and it came with some infused oil - something I have never seen before in Calcutta! We also ordered the vegetarian variant of the Juicy Lucy. It was good, and satisfying. Lastly, their chicken wings were amazing! Good piece - to - sauce ratio, nice clean presentation, and a super yummy, sour - cream based dipping sauce. BIG thumbs up!

Their service is quick, albeit the pizza can take a little long. They do complete justice to their prices. Catch a quick bite here with friends, you won't regret it!

Visited this place twice in as many weeks,and really enjoyed myself. The restaurant is a bit small,but the ambience is nice. Good music,and very friendly/helpful staff gives it a very relaxed atmosphere. The food is excellent, with a slowly increasing variety. Isn't too hard on the pocket either,so win win on most fronts! I'm going to be going back pretty often for sure!

An article in T2 (The Telegraph) led us to this tiny joint right in the heart of Sarat Bose Road. We were extremely hungry and ordered way too much food for two bellies but we definitely didn't complain. 
The first dish we ordered was the Meaty Monster pizza which was thin crust and loaded with cheese and meat, especially bacon, so we enjoyed that a lot. The next dish was the grilled Lamb Chops in red wine jus (as suggested to us by the in-charge sitting there at that time) and I have to say I was a little dubious about the red wine part, but the jus was a winner. Also the mashed potatoes were very well..er..mashed. Just the lamb chops were a little more bones than actual lamb. The next was the famous Juicy Lucy Burger which came with a couple of onion rings, fries and coleslaw. All the accompaniments were pretty good and the actual hero of the dish was loaded with meat and eggs and quite a treat to the palate, if only a little devoid of something saucy. Overall the service was good and the ambience pretty homely and I would love to go back for the pizza and the buttery mashed potato.

This new cafe was on my list since a few days. And finally we went there yesterday.
Located on Sarat Bose Road, bang opposite Dugout.
Not a very huge place, approx. 20-25 could be accommodated at once. The decor was chic. Not funky but stylish. 
Coming to the main part. We ordered quite a few dishes as per the recommendation of Mr. Akash Bhargav, the owner and a wonderful host.

Gooey Cheese Cigars - Simple wanton rolls filled with cheese. It had to be great. What did the magic was the Maple syrup along with it.
BFB Special Wings - Not quite a fan of wings, but since it was a speciality we went for it. The first thing which came out was, wow it's fleshy. It wasn't as spicy as expected.
Chicken Juicy Lucy Burger - Good taste, the patty was absolutely juicy. The sad part was too many onions along with it.
Lamb Juicy Lucy Burger - This was the better one. Absolutely loveable. We ordered many more of this. xD
Al Pachino Pizza - Not quite of a thin crust pizza fan. But this was thinner than thin crust. And with a special request of extra cheese. This was simply classic.
Premevera Pasta - This turned out to be much more delicious than expected.
Squidgy Brownie Fudge - Quite okayyish. Not worth having here.

What gives them an edge is the service. Even on a weekend with us taking time to assemble and order they were absolutely courteous. The order took time to be served but that's the charm at such places. Good to see foodie cafes. Hope this place goes big. Cheers.

The bacon bomb, a very innovative idea, is one of the best dishes i have seen in a long time. The juicy lucy burger also is very filling and tastes very good. 
One more thing that i would like to mention is the affordability of the food and a special mention goes to the innovative drinks being served.its a meat lovers paradise

Fancy name.. Average food... Extremely bad service.. They could not serve us shakes,  because the bar man was busy fighting with the other staff in the kitchen. 
Their dish napoleon BFF,  served after 65 mins of placing the order,  could not be swallowed because of extremely high content of salt put it.. Probably their cook was busy fighting inside the kitchen.  Overall an extremely disappointing experience.

Okay so I'll admit that after reading reviews on Zomato I was expecting this place to be too amazing and it was quite good. 
We ordered 
1. Cheese Cigars - the dips were yum but the cigars could have a little more filling.. it felt a little uncooked. 
2. Nachos - I was really hoping for some real cheese sauce instead of the tin cheese.. and I don't think it was really great. The dips were less than average. Can do without this. 
3. The pizza (fungi) was really tasty and the obvious highlight of our meal. 
4. The burger was yum. It was delicious and packed with flavour. 
It's a small place but the ambience is good. The staff is very well trained and they treat you very nicely. The owner was also there giving us suggestions which was quite amazing. Over all it was a great experience.. can't wait to go back and try more dishes!

They Say Big things come in small packages. This BFB ( Big Fat Belly ) though a really small eatery is Big in substance. I had gone with my children to this place and we were not disappointed. The service was really good and the menu was refreshing and fairly priced. Have to specially mention that this place doesn't have a " Service Charge" unlike most dining places these days who charge you as much as 12% as Service Charge and that causes a Big dent on your wallet. The Portions are filling . The Kids meal was really good with some yummy shake and mini brownie. The Pizza which was a regular size was almost of good size and tasted good as well. ¬†The Ice tea was so good that we ordered a repeat and the quantity was generous unlike other places where it is hardly 150 ml of actual drink and mostly ice. I would definitely visit this place again . The owner took special care of all guests which added a personal touch to the dining experience.

Located close to Hotel Samilton, this newly opened European Joint will surely grab your attention with its bright neon lights and catchy name. Inside, its a rather small 20 seater earery. Giving the place a rugged look are some coarse walls with patchy artworks & posters , brightening up the place are some emulations of street lights, some bold wodden furniture, and a funky looking mocktail counter ‚Äì everything together gives the place a trendy appeal.

We were actually driving towards the Steak Factory when the board of "My Big Fat Belly" caught our attention. By the next signal, we did a U-turn after doing some preliminary research about this new joint. We were happy with what we saw. Once we entered the place, the chicness of the place brought a smile to our face. The place is not that very big. At the max, it can hold up 25 people. It has high tables along the wall and round tables at the center. When we reached the place, we easily got ourselves a round table at the center of the place. The decor is wooden, the roof is made in the form of windows with good lightings. They have a mini-bar at the entrance where they prepare the mocktails.

With regards to the menu, it has so many things that I wanted to try them all. Also the prices were reasonable. So for our meal, we ordered the following:
-BFB Chicken Shawarma : Very excited to see this on the menu. Had high hopes, but it was more of a wrap and not a shawarma
-Fish n Chips : The best I ever had.¬†
-Grilled Cottage Cheese Skewers - The Makhani Sauce was a killer!¬†
-Grilled Chicken Steak
-Lets Nacho - Good munchies!¬†
- Paneer Khurchan Shawarma - More of a wrap
- Big Bong Burger - The pulled lamb was amazing with an egg fry in the middle and side dish was a "ghugni". A bong's delight!¬†
- Mojito Pitcher - Refreshing!¬†

Overall, the food was amazing, the portions were good and the presentation interesting. The one point of contention was the service! It took them ages to get the food on the table and they could not serve all our simultaneously. So the vegetarian junta was done and dusted by the time the complete order of non-vegetarian junta was served. It was luck on our part that after we started the place started filling up fast and people had a waiting time of 30 mins. The staff was courteous and were giving us update as to by when the order will be served.¬†

Nice place to hang out with friends. The Cafe culture is coming to Kolkata. This looks like a good start!

A bit congested though a lovely place to visit in small numbers.Not a good idea to visit here in large numbers.
Easy to locate,service was prompt,but overconscious attitude of the staff and owners really bothered us.Moreover its not a cozy place to visit with grandparents or old family members since they only have normal seats at the centre and elsewhere there are chairs in which we had to climb up literally üòû
Now comming to the food,price is a bit high as per the quantity offered.
We ordered Grilled chicken steak with red wine and rosemary sauce.Rice was well cooked,sauce was good but chicken was a bit dry.
Last but not the least its a good place if you want to have an adda on the lazy afternoon.

Quirky and contemporary, MBFB is quickly becoming one of my most favorite late night haunts in the city. With the knowledgeable and friendly issue of brothers as your hosts backed by an attentive sorry staff, you are bound to have a saliva fueled dining experience. Don't forget to check out their open faced calzone styled Cassanova sandwich, the filing of made from scratch pork sausage steeped in the secret house blend of cheese,  packed and baked to perfection in philoey pizza base. I found it pretty uniquely delicious. Go Belly!

What a bellicious dinner i had last day!! MyBFB is located conveniently opposite DugOut on sarat bose road , a small eatery on the ground floor with the masculine wooden and rugged interiors with 3 rectangular high tables for four on one side, two round tables for three and a table for two in the middle and an open kitchen the other side, the music , the lightings , the vibe like we expect in an american joint was awesome. Mr. Akarsh Bhargava , the chief belly banger ( and the owner) is such a warm host , welcomed and helped us through the menu and he individually looks after the guests taking note of every detail from them.
Coming back to our bellifying dinner for two : BACON BOMB , SQUIGDY BROWNIE SHAKE , MEATY MONSTER PIZZA (cheesy thin crust :D ) were all so good but THE clear winner was the ULTIMATE JUICY LUCY CHICKEN BURGER (slurrrp!!) , well that was something droolworthy. One might find the portion of bacon bomb quite less comparing the pricing, but the rest were all value for money.

just one suggestion to the staff , though i've seen the kitchen to be quite small , still as the serving time was prolonged(as in our case ) , you may need to be a little more efficient in dealing with our waiting time. Rest all is fantastic üëç will definitely drop in soon , the kosha mangsho burger is yet on my wishlist üòä

Right on Sarat bose road. A small place with a really cool decor. Yellow lights and the ceiling had doors and windows fixed on them. Seats only about 20 people though. People kept coming and going all the time. I was surprised to see such a new place having so many customers already and such great ratings. The service is great. Staff really friendly. We had the Squidgy Brownie shake, The ultimate juicy lucy burger and a classic chicken steak in mushroom sauce. The shake though nothing like the picture on the menu ( we were pre warned by the staff that it would not look anything like it) was nevertheless amazing. The burger was served with onion rings and fries and had chicken wrapped in the most delicious cheese and a poached egg. I did not like the onion rings but the burger was heaven. The steak was okay as far as steaks go. The sauce though was tasty. Looking forward to visit soon and try their pizzas. They also serve these pitchers for drinks. The owner comes and asks around if we liked the food. 
On my second visit I tried their fried prawns, big bong burger and mousse cake. The Prawns were served with a delicious dip. The burger tasted like minced kosha mangsho was sandwiched between the bread. It was delicious. The mousse cake was also heaven. It completely melts in your mouth. The owner even gave us a cup of a warm mocktail they were experimenting with. It tasted of apple cider, cinnamon and lemon. He asked our suggestions on it.

The sundried tomato risotto is the best I have ever had, the nachos were average, mushrooms Arancini was good, bellisma fries is a new concept but tasted average, cigars were very ok. Pizza margarita was good and so was the paneer skewers with rice n makhni sauce, loved the sauce though the paneer was a little bland.

After a lot of searching on Zomato, we'd finally zeroed in on My Big Fat Belly, since it looked different and creative, and seemed to have a lot of different options. It turned out to be a good choice.

Food - To start with, they have a lot of variety. The Gooey Cheese Cigars were nice, crunchy and tasty. The Paneer Khurchan Shawarma was average. We'd ordered for a Mushroom & Asparagus Risotto, which was delicious. It's a very common dish these days, but it had a unique flavour to it. 

We also had an orange ginger mojito, which was refreshing and had a very balanced flavour with small bits of ginger. The Shroominator burger had great flavour and was very filling. 

More options in the desserts section would've been good, but they said they're gonna add more desserts soon, so hoping that happens.

Service - The service was good. The staff was courteous and the food arrived in good time, without being in a rush. The owner was present and was talking to the customers and taking feedback, which was quite nice.

Ambience - The ambience is casual and modern; a good place to be with friends or cousins. Probably not ideal to come with the family if you wish for a quiet and relaxing meal. Have given an extra 0.5 rating for the music, as some good music really makes a difference to the whole experience, especially when the music is compatible with the ambience and feel of the place.

Overall, a nice experience and we enjoyed :)

Situated in Bhawanipore, My Big Fat Belly is a fairly decent experience. The ambiance is ideal with some clever paintings and a surprisingly good selection of songs to set the mood. The overall feel to the place is good, of course the friendly staff is a plus. 
They do have certain "Challenges" in place if you think you can beat the house for free food and the staff are rather enthusiastic with the whole matter which is always good to see. 
Coming to the food, we ordered the Grilled chicken Burger and the herb Chicken. Both presented well with some fries. The burger had poached eggs stuffed in between and was fairly tasty, not the best I've had but good. The Herb Chicken was slightly chewy but the flavor was rich and tasteful and made up for the shortcomings. 
My big fat belly is a really nice joint supported by great staff and certainly, above par food. I'd visit again and would recommend others to try it out at least once.

A small tiny outlet located on Sarat Bose Road. Trendy interior with scrumptious food. But they failed at the most important aspect of the industry to which they belong - SERVICE. 
Really slow service . Giving the menu - 10min, taking the order - 10min (after we are ready with the order), no one to serve water, food comes before the cutlery . 
Having started their outlet as new as theirs they don't have a cashier rather all the waiters are doing the entire bill entry individually hence not being able to serve the customers properly. 
I hope the management realise that in today's world no matter how good your food is, if your service is not upto the mark it will leave a bad taste in customers mind. 

P.S - a small piece of advice, if you are ever short staffed don't delegate the responsibility of that staff on every staff rather shift one staff entirely for that work .

The food is innovative - had ordered the bong burger, pasta carbonara, pasta aglio olio v2 and chicken let's nachos. The pulled lamb burger was delicious, sumptuous and the ghughni on the side was a great idea. The pasta too was pretty good.

Justifying the name of the place,indeed we all had a big fat belly while leaving the place after having a grand lunch here.its a small place which can accommodate 20-25 people at a time.on dasami afternoon we had to wait for 45 mins before getting a table for 7.the owners were extremely friendly and constantly communicating with us while we were waiting and infact they said,since they were making us wait for so long its their duty to serve us good food.and truly they did so!starting from,chicken wings,sausages,grilled fish,chicken skeweres,russian mafia,grilled chicken burger everything left us spellbound..we were highly satisfied and extremely overwhelmed while leaving the place..they are doing an extremely good job.üëça big thumbs up to the team for servimg such mindblowing food and their amazing plating ideas.thanx for giving us a belly tickling experienceüòÉ!

TL;DR: My Big Fat Belly is LEGEN...wait for it...DARY . It also has the best burger in Kolkata: The Ultimate Juicy Lucy.

My Big Fat Belly is the newest food hotspot in the Elgin region. What sets it apart from other food joints of the same genre is its attention to detail. Hats off to the management for that. The moment you grab a sight of the place, you immediately love it. Open Sesame its doors and a small open diner-esque setting welcomes you. It is complete with its high chairs and tables, Victorian lightbulb casings and an interior decor that screams "New York" to my face. Every element in the decor is well thought out (especially the windows-for-ceiling bit, which you have to see first hand to admire) , and the space management for such a small place is excellent.¬†

The food: Let's say I would miss the premier of "Justice League" to have a great lunch at this place. It is a sensation like no other. If foodgasm is your word, you'll have it often while munching on the various delicacies from the menu.¬†

We ordered an Iced Tea with Peach flavouring, a Fruit Shake with Kiwi, Chicken Wings in Ghost Chilly Sauce, Bacon Bomb, and The Ultimate Juicy Lucy Burger with Bacon. The drinks in general are ¬†very good, though the iced tea was a bit on the bitter side. Chicken wings in ghost chilly sauce is spicy, but I would recommend getting a medium spicy order. The Bacon Bomb was indeed a bomb. I've never had such good bacon in the city at such a pocket friendly price. The sauce in the Bacon Bomb gets a special mention here, as it was the adhesive that was keeping things together and speaking to our senses. Yes the sauce was that good.¬†

The burger, as recommended by the owner of the establishment, was a triumph of its own. Its a burger fit for champions. Hands down the BEST BURGER in Kolkata. It was juicy, meaty and had a supreme filling of lamb, which was cooked to perfection. The fries also get a special mention, as they had the perfect amount of crispiness to them.¬†

All in all, this was a foodgasmic experience, and I would be visiting this place again.

This place is new and a little small but packs a lot of punch. Their Juicy Lucy burger is a must try and is just heavenly. The lamb patty is bursting with flavour and in combination with other ingredients makes it a delight to taste. It can lay claim to the title of the best burger in the city. We also had their Bacon Bomb which is incredibly good and the bacon is very juicy and succulent. We had their BFB Special Chicken Wings too. A word of caution- Its not as hot and spicy as they claim so definitely go for at least medium spicy. We had the regular one and it was quite good but the zing could have been upped a bit. Their Kiwifruit shake is also delightfully smooth and creamy.¬†
Service was exemplary and the staff is very friendly and helpful. We also had a nice talk with the incredibly friendly and courteous owner.
If you want top class and very affordable gourmet food this place is recommended. I am definitely a fan now and would be coming back regularly.

The place is nicely done up and thats its usp. The food does not justify the high rating. Their menu sounds interesting but once the food comes out its quite basic and lacks taste and quality. 
Can try once to see if it suits your palate.

I went there just yesterday and the experience was so thoroughly enjoyable that when they asked me to drop in a review,  I immediately decided to do so!  The ambience is so cosy and stylish at the same time. The chicken wings were the best ones I've tasted in a long time and the mashed potatoes are to die for!  Will be going back soon enough to try out more exciting dishes! :)

This was one of my Durga Puja outings, ¬†but I remember the experience as if it was yesterday :p
The restaurant is located on the main road, very easy to find and looks average from outside but its totally deceiving! The interiors will give you the feels of a quaint little cafe with a warm atmosphere and the light music and cute little posters are a treat to the eye. The owner/manager is always chilling around and makes you feel at home occasionally dropping by and not in an annoying way :p

We ordered a Grilled Chicken Burger and Big Bong Burger ( insisted upon by the staff). The chicken burger was fine but the big bong burger was by far ¬†THE BEST BURGER I have ever tasted. I completely regretted not ordering the same for myself. ¬†The patty was replaced by "Kosha Mangsho" reduction and the staff called it a tribute to Bengalis and believe me it is. The sides onion rings and fries were decent but the burgers are massive all by themselves.¬†

The food was amazing and for that price, totally worth it! Will be back soon myself and I recommend to all burger lovers.

2. Herb Fried Chicken - Very well Crusted with Juicy chicken inside - Very Good
3.Sausages in Chef Signature Sauce _Pork - Extremely good quality of Pork seasoned very well. - A MUST EAT

Main Course:
1. The Ultimate Juicy Lucy _Lamb - The description says it all. ¬†I would definitely go for the burger. I hope they wont disappoint me on the burgers.
2.Mushroom & Asparagus Risotto_Seafood - Good¬†
3.Grilled Chicken Steak with Mushroom Sauce - Ok
4. BFB non Veg Grill Platter_Lamb- Very God

So this was a place where we went during pujo. The ambience is brilliant, such warm lights and cozy seating. I LOVE their ceiling (please visit to know). The menu has some quirky items just as I like it. I took a mac and cheese chicken (was craving mac and cheese) and my friend took Chicken Champ with pita bread. The mac and cheese was DELICIOUS, the pita bread could've been a bit softer. We also took Oreo Shake which was delicious. It was a great experience for sure.

My Big Fat Belly is a tiny little gem of a place at
Chakrabaria ‚Äì interiors are innovative , recycling vintage door and windows in
a very chic fashion . Food is awesome and there are interesting twists ‚Äì I
would recommend the Bacon Bomb to anyone that loves their meat and the Big Bong
Burger is also quite yumm. The Pizzas are a lovely thin crust with the optimum
balance of meat , sauce and cheese ! Service is quick , well informed and
friendly. The only downside is a rather limited dessert menu. Would love to go
back and eat my way through their full menu !

Conveniently located on Sarat Bose Road, I first visited this place on Dashami eve with the Puja verve on the low. The decor and the ambience of this joint seemed a bit mellow with the classic 70s rock music playing in the background.

The menu provides a lot many options which definitely makes this not your typical burger and fries joint, but maybe more. I ordered a Brownie Shake (bit sweet to my liking) along with a 'Juicy Lucy Burger' which was really a deal maker. I asked for an extra layer of mushrooms, which indeed lifted the taste another notch. Loved how the grilled patty didn't seem dry until the last bite, with the richness of cheese and the fresh lettuce. Overall, a fine experience.

I'd be back for more very soon. Perhaps, even compete in the burger eating challenges I heard this place has up for bets.

Smack dab on Chakraberia crossing is this place for people whose tastes run a little...eclectic.  It's a smallish joint (hardly enough space for thirty people), which is why the menu is so surprising, both in content and variety. 

It's an understatement to say I love the food here. A better word would be "addicted", because there are times when I feel a hankering that only their Hot Wings can sate. Lucky me then, that the place is all of 90 seconds away from my office. Having been to Big Fat Belly about twenty odd times in the last few weeks, I have many, many recommendations, but since we don't have all week, let's keep this brief. Zomato tells me a good review should cover Food, Service and Ambiance, so that's how we'll proceed.

TL;DR: The short version of the review? If you haven't been to The Big Fat Belly, go there. Like, right now. Yes, WHILE you read this review. Read it on your phone on the way. The food is just that good. It's hearty, meaty, cheesy fare (I'm told the vegetarian options are good too, but I haven't tried them), that's surprisingly less common than you'd think in a foodie city like Kolkata. Barring a few experimental dishes, the food is familiar, but with its own twist in terms of flavour. The service is pleasant and the decor is suitably bohemian. And now, to the details...

The Food: It should be apparent by now how much I love this place. There is an element of creativity in every dish, with little surprises littered throughout. The Hot Wings are just the right kind of hot, starting off low and slowly setting off little peppery fires in your mouth. Another favourite is a grilled fish which comes with a variety of sauces, but we pick the Gandhoraj Chilly Lemon Creme sauce every time because my mouth refuses to believe there could be a better choice. Oh, and the bed of mashed potatoes the fish is served on deserves special mention, because it might as well be butter - so soft and smooth. The burgers deserve special mention because we don't have nearly enough places serving lamb burgers in this city, and the burger meat they use is incredible - full bodied and yet soft enough to melt in your mouth. I prefer burgers that use the traditional patty, but The Kosha Mangsho burger has its fans as well. Even something as basic as a Mac and Cheese is great. The only secret to a great Mac and Cheese is making it as cheesy as possible, and these guys are NOT stingy, resulting in the most comforting of comfort foods. Not the healthiest, but hey, there's a reason why the place isn't called "My Six Pack". Even the salads are standard, but filling and crunchy - as satisfying as a salad can be. Oh, and special mention has to be made of the limited, but great drinks menu. There's this concoction they create out of Orange and Cinnamon that can only be described as "heavenly" (unless you are some horrible person who doesn't like Oranges or Cinnamon). However, if you prefer your drinks tangy rather than simply sweet, there's this fun drink they serve with an actual "gola", (the name escapes me at the moment), that my friend swears by.

The Service: Despite the burgers and pizzas, this is not a "Fast Food" joint. So don't expect your food to be served immediately. That said, service can sometimes be a little bit slow, but it's always, uniformly pleasant, the wait staff is never pushy, and recommendations are usually spot-on. You barely notice them until you need them, which is pretty amazing in such a small place as this.¬†

The Decor: Not that it matters much to me, but the decor is fun. The ceiling is pretty unique (you have to visit to find out why), and the whole vibe is laid back and yet, somehow, has a sense of energy. There's art on the walls, some of the pieces clash with the others, and not everything looks like it fits and yet, somehow, it does. I guess, it's a little bit like Kolkata itself that way. Huh....maybe that's why I like it so much.

I know it looks like I am shilling, but I really do love The Big Fat Belly this much. It's the right combination of exactly the kind of food I love, with exactly the right kind of ambiance to hang out with friends for a decent adda, and exactly the right kind of unobtrusive service that adda needs. Good times are to be had at The Big Fat Belly - I hope you're hungry.

I had heard a lot about a certain burger found at this place. And today we all decided to try it. We had the fruity mojito, brownie shake , a meat lover's pizza , two bong burgers and the chicken juicy Lucy burger. 
The shakes were nice and thick, with pieces of brownie in between. It was not very sweet which was good. The fruity mojito had its cranberry juice dominating, but the tanginess of lemon juice and the sweetness of passion fruit was also present. The drinks were shed in mason jars with handles on the side. 
The meat lover's pizza here was truly amazing. It had different meats like bacon , ham, chicken in it and the amount of cheese used was enough to make it a good pizza. It was a thin crust pizza. 
Coming to the burgers, the chicken burger was good. But what I had and liked most was the bong burger. It was a take on kosha mangsho, a famous Bengali dish. So it was mostly like a sloppy joe sandwich with pulled lamb instead of pulled chicken. The burger was really good, it had shredded lamb cooked in Bengali style with lettuce, mustard, cheese, omelette and potatoes. It was served with fries and onion rings, the onion rings being crunchy and well seasoned. The filling of the burger was the lamb and was very tasty. Alongwith the burger they served ghugni, again a typical Bengali specialty which I would say could have been better. The ghugni dal was a bit undercooked and had less salt. But other than all that, it was a wonderful experience to dine in here. It's a small place, right in front of dugout and has reopened in collaboration with ' the little donkey'. The staff and owners of the restaurant were very caring and friendly and gave us suggestions as to which items to try from the menu. A must go-to place for all meat lovers. Do try their Bong burger because this is the kind of fusion food which cannot disappoint you.

I heard abt this joint from one my friends so we thought to hav a go.It is just opposite of DugOut bhawnipore it a very compact well designed nd its interior decor hav artistic touch of American Fast food chains.As it was festive season so we hav to wait for a bit to be seated inside as we entered the owner of the joint gladly welcomed us nd showed us the table.I found the baground music to be a bit loud which i dont prefer much butt they hav a nice collection of music tracks which i liked.There was so many dishes in the house that we were a bit confused at one point so took the main chefs preferece which one to order
We ordered The big bong Burger,Bhetki paturi wala Burger,&The Meaty Monster

Big bong burger was too good to be true it has a perfect blend of all the spices nd meat which made it a top notch Burger a must hav burger nd it was served with ghugni which i found a bit surprised but happy as well.In my opinion if you r having a burger u dont need addons it a solo wala food.Bhetkir Paturi Burger was good some thing we dont hav it other joints usually but it could be great it tasted a bit flat it could hav tasted much better.Moving on The Meaty Monster it is basically a Pizzza with different varietys of meat nd it has a thin crust the first bite i took it i find a perfect touch of master stroke in the pizza it was something i never found in any other pizza.Mark my words this Pizza willl be a dominating factor for big fat belly in the pizzzza serrving industry.A must hav dish if u visit The Big Fat Belly.

I found pricing of food to quite cheap compared to the quantiy quality of food they r serving to the customers

If u like American Food then u should definately hav a go at this place i am sure u will be quite pleased and satisfied with service of the Big Fat Belly wala!!!!!!!!

This place was on my wish list for quite sometime. It's a small eatery just opposite to The Dugout which has an interesting decor and an amazing food quality. 

Though it's the pujas here in Calcutta but getting a seat wasn't that difficult. I ordered BFB fish and chips and was very satisfied with the quality of bhekti they served. I also ordered pork vindaloo with rice which was the pujo special menu as suggested by the owner himself which didn't disappoint me either. The kiwi drink was just perfect. 

HAPPY BELLY.....HAPPY ME!!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

This place has recently opened and is one of the few that truly understands the importance of "home made", this includes their scrumptious pork sausages! The meat for the sausages are sourced from parts of India where the quality is great, there's no compromise which is lovely! 
We tried the Juicy Lucy which was a delicious veg burger, a great option if you're off meat where you feel as good as the meat lovers on the table! 
The Mayo-mustard is home made rather than pre packaged and the ingredients are fresh, testament to this is the Greek salad that I had. The only thing I would've hoped for is more of a cream-free dressing and the olive oil, balsamic dressing that would've made is more authentic. 
They've even got tribute burgers where they have married Khosha Mangsho and a Cheese melt, and also launching the Patoli Maachi burger, a take on the Bong steamed fish. 
A definitive must-do in Kolkata!

Visited My Big Fat Belly 2 days ago with my family.
The place is very neatly done up. Loved the false ceiling made of old doors and windows with a distressed look. Wish the place was bigger- there was too much crampiness inside.  Tables are too small- cannot even hold the serving dishes and drinks properly.

Now for the food-- the icing on the cake! Amazing food , attentive staff, prompt service  . I had a pizza - Hottie Bettie- crisp , spucy , right amount of cheese. The kalamata olives gave it such a lovely taste.
My husband had the cottage cheese skewers served with a bed of herbed rice and the malkani sauce- lip slurping sauce but the skewers were too spicy for us.
In fact each person on our table enjoyed hire or her dish immensely.
A nice place with good food and good service - at affordable prices.  Will definitely go back and even recommend to friends.

This is one of the newest places that came up. The manager was really polite and we even had a talk about future plans for the place. But what's most important is that the food here is really delicious and yes, u will definitely want to come here again. The best part is that they make everything here on their own except the ketchup and pita bread. I had shawarma, pasta and an amazing dessert and yes it was worth the price I paid. Would recommend this place.

                Enjoyed a thoroughly satisfying and completely indulgent lunch here on Friday afternoon. I reached at about 2:30 and the place was jam packed till we left at 4. We ordered the cheese cigars, grilled burger with add on bacon, and chicken shawarma. The portions are generous and the burger is sinfully juicy. The oozy cheese cigars are worth every calorie (especially with the quirky dipping sauces that accompany it). As a lemon iced tea addict, I can safely say it's one of the best in the city. 
If you need any more reason to visit, the staff is super friendly and helpful. We left with big fat HAPPY bellies

It was on 25.09.16 that me and my friends decided to eat here for dinner. It is located just opposite of one of the famous hookah bar, The Dugout. We entered and we were told to wait for at least 15 minutes but we waited less than that for our table. The owner, who i think he was, is extremely kind and so is the manager! Coming back to the place, it is very small and hardly there's 7 to 8 small tables with small chairs. But it didnt stop us from eating. We ordered grilled chicken burger, aunty annie and cheese chilly toast. The good tasted really good. And it is pocket friendly too. Hoping to come back here next time!

Placed an order for home delivery: the person on the phone very polite and helpful. Instant positive vibe. Wanted to order shwarmas but they had none left at 8pm on Sunday!! Little disappointed about that. Finally ordered ali oli, arrabiatta, chicken burger and a fish sub. 
The chicken burger was good though they didn't pack the Cole slaw only fries and burger. 
The rest of the order was also above average. All in all good cafe food with good service! Keep it up!

The place has wonderful ambience owing to its lighting and choice of interior.However due to the huge billing counter and drinks area , one could feel a bit claustrophobic .
Coming to the food , I had 4 dishes -

Al pacino pizza - It had a lovely thin crust and the flavours were good.

Chicken Shawarma - The shawarma here is of top quality ! The pita bread was soft and easy to chew. The filling was delicious .It wasn't super heavy (did not contain dripping sauces) like the ones we get at other places in the city .Also the humus served with it had a wonderfully rich texture.

Nachos with Grilled Chicken - spicy and perfectly crisp Nachos served with soft and juicy grilled chicken strips . It is complete ecstasy.

Made in Indtalia-A wonderfully crispy crust and the lipsmacking combo of spicy italian sauce and teekha chicken tikka make this one a winner !

Quick service,amazing food.Keep it up guys !

Good food. Must try to juicy juicy burger. Stick to the fast food side of things vs. the more continental dishes. Gondhoraj fish and the red wine based chicken were average lacking crazy flavour. 

The ambience is great as well as the music. Hope you guys get a liquor license soon!

The food was totally insane. It ws the best american and italian food i have ever eaten in kolkata or anywhere as a matter of fact. The burgers was huge, juicy and delicious. The pasta had all the flavours bursting in ur mouth. And the brownie was outstanding and perfectly cooked and served with vanilla icescream. The ambience and interior was simple yet pleasant. The service was very quick and friendly. The price is very pocket friendly and reasonable. I do recommend this place to anyone who has a good belly and a good taste in food. PS. I couldnt wait to take a picture coz the food was looking delicious af and was smelling awesome.

The place fits into the category perfectly . Although the place cannot accommodate more than 20 people at a time it is fun to visit! The food was good enough. They can improve their standards though! The nachos should have had more filling and the shawarma could have been more tasty! But overall the experience was very goodüòäüòäüòä

First look at the place gives a very positive vibe..The place is beautifully decorated with overhead doors and window designs..The service is extremely good and quick. The place is a bit small and a little cramped up. Hopefully they'll try to expand. The price is worth what they serve. Coming to the food we ordered BBQ sauce chicken wings, grilled chicken burgers with added bacon, chicken crumb fries burger with bacon, Russian mafia and ice lemon tea pitcher. The amount is quite a lot. The bacon tastes amazing,so does each of the food items. The ice lemon tea was a bit turn down however. The manager came and spoke to us,took our feedbacks from time to time,gave us suggestions. It was a wonderful experience. Highly recommend the place

Just got out of a movie at midnight and was heading to Jai Hind Dhaba when a friend called me over to this place. (Its near to Jai Hind). Its a small place but very creatively designed just like its dishes. The innovation in their food is mind-blowing. Its not molecular gastronomy but its built on deconstruction of American cuisine with a blend of taste picked from day to day cooking of an Indian household.

Keep up the good work guys!

Well heard a lot about this place from friends so wanted to check out what all the fuss is about. And let me just say that the hype was absolutely justified.I was also very pleased to see the kind of fusion that they provided. The level of detail you see in their burgers is much appreciated by a burger enthusiast like myself. We ordered  "The Juicy Lucy" & "The Big Bong" burger along with a pitcher of mix fruit mojito,which to my surprise was also delightful.
An over all satisfying experience...am definitely going back to finish off the rest of the menu...would love it if every foodie can be as satisfied as i was.

The American dream? Its real folks! What's America for a foodie? Burgers, steaks, platters and lots of food challenges! My big fat belly just recreated that in a cosy cafe located on landsowne bhawanipur junction.

Succeeding from the little donkey, my big fat belly is Kolkata's take on american and Italian. What's different? Well from a foodies point of view! Everything!

Went here for a dinner for two and was warmly greeted by the owner, Adarsh who made sure we were comfortable.

AMBIANCE: Lot of wood used, black balancing, the interesting old door installations on the ceiling, use of pastels near the main door. The vibes are pure modern with a rustic feel to it. Wooden stacks contain essentials like cutlery, paper towels, seasoning and sauces! Yellow dim lighting works well to elevate the setting!

FOOD:
- Hazelnut iced coffee and Almond Irish iced coffee were ordered for drinks. I found the concept of iced coffees very very refreshing! The same kick as coffee without leaving you guilty for gulping down milk and cream! It leaves you light in the tummy to eat well! #recommended

- Gooey cheese cigars half portion came with the cigars hot and piping! It was served with their house Texan mayo which was creamy and slightly spicy.
The other sauce was a chilli strawberry and trust me I licked off the plate with this one! It was sweet with a good strawberry flavour but was hot from the red chilli. Absolutely loved the idea of this sauce! It felt like a cheese tasting with cheese and fruit and trust me- cheese and fruit is a deadly combo! #recommended

- Gardens Treasure burger was a heavy duty burger, justifying that the place serves american! Americans are known for king sized portions whether it is burgers or pizzas or even popcorn! The burger came loaded with a veg patty, grilled onions, montery jack cheese ( seriously? I love u guys) and tangy cucumber pickles ( totally american). It was served with home fries and a coleslaw side.
Believe me here comes another #recommendation from my side!

- BFB Veg grill platter was served with a huge portion of grilled veggies, cottage cheese, cheese in a beautiful mushroom sauce. The sauce was so tasty that I am salivating by just mentioning it! #Recommended

We didn't find any desserts to go for so we skipped it!

SUMMING IT UP:
The portions of the food are nice and I hope that they maintain it!
Spotted their monster challenge and I will one day brave it for sure!

The prices are justified and the food delicious! The service wins an additional point from me! The servers and chef personally explained all the dishes and the idea of conceptualisation! The waiters were prompt with clearing the tables!

Overall a brilliant experience at MBFB at guys, if you haven't already then please do visit this place!

Best wishes to Adarsh and team!

A tiny place with lots of awesome foods.Right from the starters to the deserts everything was awesome. Not going to blabber much about the foods...cause you really need to taste all of them. But I will definitely mentione about two things...First the soup, I really hate tomato soups...but they made me fall in love with their tomato and basil soup. Second one is the bacon bomb,its just HEAVENLY....perfect blend of pork and sauces..and also the mocktail.only one thing will make this place better, can you please make the sittings a bit more cozier...@Pooja Banerjee

I rarely rate restaurants 5/5 on Zomato but this new joint really deserves it. It's a rather small cosy eatery located on Sarat Bose Road with rustic interiors (not hipster tho). I really can't fault them with any of our orders. We ordered fried Janko prawns (which were very fresh) served with a wasabi mayo dip which is definitely a far cry from the generic dips I've gotten used to. The chicken wings were also very good, tender, succulent and spicy. For the mains,  we ordered lamb chops, the bacon bomb, mushroom and asparagus risotto and the shroominator burger. I don't have the patience to describe them individually, but they were all delicious (to a large extent because of the sauces and the reductions they were cooked in). This place definitely serves larger portions and significantly better food than its competitors like Chili's and TGIF at a fraction of their price. Unfortunately, they don't have a bar license which is their only drawback in my opinion. The brownie milkshake (packed with crumbed brownies and ice cream) deserves a special mention too. Also, the owner is a really chill dude and his banter-game is absolutely on point. 11/10 would come here again, maybe after a j or two.

With a handful of new places opening in the city, decided to strike this one off the list with a few friends.¬†In a nutshell, lip smacking food, warm and cordial service, and great value for money, which I believe is the place's competitive advantage and hope the food continues to be priced just right!¬†

Food&Beverage: Called for the BFB Chicken wings in their 'Phaadu' variant of their ghost chilli sauce. What an absolute delight! Perfectly caters to those chicken-wing cravings. Also tried their Herb-Fried Chicken which is served with their Garlic Aioli Dip and is commendable!¬†
For mains: ¬†I called for their Lamb Chops in Red Wine jus. At par with the review so far. The jus was absolutely delicious and the meat perfectly cooked. Also had their Shroominator and The Big Bong burgers on the table. Friends who called for the two were more than satisfied, especially with their conceptualised Big Bong burger. Last item for the mains was the Grilled Cottage cheese Skewers. The Skewers come with a smooth creamy Makhni Sauce. The sauce is a must-try and kicks the entire dish up a notch.¬†
Desserts: ¬†Tried the Squidgy Brownie with Ice Cream. The brownie stays true to the name and gives the gooey texture of a tad undercooked brownie. Another absolute must-try on your visit. ¬†

Ambience: The place is nice and small. A round about dining space for 25-30 people. Done up well. The feel of the place coupled with the menu would've gone perfectly with some wine and beer. Hope that shows up soon.

Service: Humble and courteous staff. The owners were around too and were more than willing to constantly suggest items off their menu and were definitely worth listening too.¬†

All in all, a great experience. They've set the bar high in terms of quality of food. Definitely going to be back to try other items from the menu. Prices are just right for the pocket and renders it great value of money.¬†
Cheers!

They are just awesome. A small cafe with super tasty food. Good music, great ambiance. Went there with 2 friends, ordered sausage in BBQ sauce and chicken wings for starters. They tasted excellent but the quantity of the sausage was not satisfactory. My friend ordered chicken quino salad, it was prepared very nicely and had enough chicken. The best part is the The American Pizza. I ordered the 14" size. This is one of the best thin crust pizza I've ever had. My tummy was full, so I'll visit again for the burgers.

New place ... Lively place ... Small place .... 

This review is based on just two items we tried .. the juicy lucy  burger and the russia  mafia .. 

No problem with juicy lucy ..its perfect for the price ... the dressings were just perfect and the patty was awesome with perfect amount of cheese inside the patty ... wish they had a XL version of the same ..

The russian mafia is bang on price ..very testy with ample filling ..  but the bun needs some attention... wish they try the same with baguette bread .. that would be 6/5 ..

The juicy lucy scores a home run and with not much compitition at present in kolkata....  and is one of the very best burgers you get in town ... SO SURELY A MUST VISIT . 

Happy Fooding  :)

When @_mybigfatbelly_ opened it's cute doors to the public a couple of days back, we just knew we would love it there. So, last night we had an impromptu dinner plan and looked no further than this brand new eating joint, with tastefully done interiors. The moment we set foot inside, we felt like we were "home". Being Fashion Designers, we always look for teeny-tiny artsy details everywhere and the place was so cosy and done up really well. With vintage doors for ceiling and walls done up with bright pop-coloured window panes, comfortable seating area and soothing yellow bulbs! We love our "Bhoot Jolokia" urf Naga Chilli and when we saw that they served Chicken Wings that had Naga Chili Sauce in it, we obviously ordered for it and went for the Phaadu Sauce, which is the spiciest. We've never felt happier with a fire in our belly. Very few eating places actually live up to it's promised "very spicy" tag, My BFB surely did. Disclaimer: Do not, we repeat, DO NOT have this if you have a weak heart and tongue.ü§ì We jumped to main-course right after that and were very kindly helped by Mr.Adarsh, to select our dishes. He suggested we go for the Grilled Fish in Chilly Lemon Creme with Mashed Potatoes and Chicken Skewers with San Marzano Makhani Sauce. The Grilled Fish was heavenly and went so well with the perfectly mashed potatoes. They Gondhoraj Chilli Lemon Creme sauce was the perfect blend of creaminess and freshness and complimented the grilled fish so well. The Chicken Skewers with the San Marzano Makhani sauce was another interesting dish. Who knew Indian and Italian would be mixed to create such an out-of-the-world concoction?‚ù§Ô∏è They served this dish with herb rice and we were more than happy (we are Bongs, so you know the deal). We are usually not such light-eaters (you guys know by now) but we were looking to have a light dinner this time, so basically, this was just a tiny food-tasting session for us. We are going back pretty soon with our Hungry-Monster mode on, to devour the other amazing dishes they have to offer. Our Big Fat Bellies were satiated to my extent last night and we cannot wait to go back for more. *dream and drool mode on*

A really nice place with amazing presentation , mixed with superb flavours in the food taste. The burgers are too juicy and has very unique flavours. The pander skewer presentation and the gravy with it is a must try! And you cannot miss the "Marwari masala" its taste and the presentation. All the best!


Once again this place has some amazing juicy burgers to try and the taste just gets better each time  you visit. The mushroom risotto I tried at this place was just the best dish of my dinner. Waiting for the summer menu to come next week!

A place which I wanted to visit for a long time disappointed me bad. A visit with 2 friends left me wanting to avoid this place in future. 
We took our Seats and waited for menu, while one of the co-owners came up and spoke to us which probably was the only good thing that happened. 
We called for 2 tea's which were tea bags brewed well. It was gooey cheese cigars which were no where close to gooey,it hardly had any cheese and tasted just bland, the chef came up to check and on complaining he turned arrogant, he said he had a measure portion size of cheese and it could not go wrong, such was the hospitality. 
The mushroom arincinni was so so, edible enough but a little cold from inside. 
The big bong burner had bones inside the inside the lamb and was replaced as soon as bought to notice. 
Next was grilled veg and paneer in mushroom sauce, the sauce was sweet and I have never tasted a sweet mushroom sauce before. We left the food as we don't have the heart to complain anymore. 
The only saviour was the caramel butterscotch shake. 
I had a very bad experience, where everything went wrong.

The food here is just amazing with great combination of flavours. Menu offers a great variety and the hosts personally entertain you, giving a different touch.
Must try the paneer skewers with Makhani Gravy, it is the best dish for vegetarians in the house. Risotto tastes great with flavours to compete with one of the finest fine dining restaurants.
Place is quite cozy but ambience is lively.
My overall experience was great and I would totally recommend it.

This is the place where "The Little Donkey"used to be which I had visited last september.... & was really disappointed when it closed it's doors. Suddenly last week I saw this new name "My Big Fat Belly" while visiting Forum,searched on zomato and bookmarked it at once ! Finally, this afternoon me and my friend checked in for lunch...hungry and tired after a shopping trip.It was a rainy afternoon....perfect for a lunch date. The staff was very welcoming...we got sitted though I found the high chairs a little uncomfortable (for my heightüòÖ). I ordered their Butterscotch and caramel shake and BFB Cold coffee (both quite popular) I'm assuming the owner was present at that moment and he came and greeted us and took our order. He suggested all the 3 items and we agreed as I was not too keen to read the long menu (we were too hungryüôÉ)
Started with Gooey cheese cigars...4 crispy fingers with a mayo dip.and strawberry chilli sauce which was unique in taste. There's a little suggestion though...as mentioned on the menu the cigars are supposed to be filled with jalapeno,herbs and cheese mix. But I only tasted cheese and nothing else.
Next, the Dolce vita sandwich....with spinach,corn and ricotta filling served with fries. This sandwich is nothing like your regular sandwich..it's made with pizza dough which was nice and crispy. I personally don't like ricotta....so didn't enjoy it much...but the quality was good no doubt ! The french fries were crunchy and perfect.
Now came the Permevera pasta with added veggies and focaccia bread. That plate of pasta really looked appetizing with the red cherry tomatoes and yellow and green zuccini and sprig of basil. The sauce was creamy...not too spicy not too bland...after a long time I enjoyed a good pasta dish at any eatery !
Now for the cold coffee and shake...the cold coffee was average ! The butterscotch shake was really tasty(I could see they used Amul butterscotch ice cream). The bill amount of Rs.855 was quite reasonable for the whole experience(with no added tax)The prices on the menu are inclusive of taxes for the time being.
Next time I'm going back for their burgers and oreo chocolate shake.
And last but not the least...I really appreciate how they have done the interiors with old painted wooden windows and those wrought iron wall lamps, along with that bold name tag in black against a white kitchen area.
I hope they keep trending on zomato and have a long run !

A very friendly environment, the ambience is really good, a place where you'd be really comfortable to sit and eat.
We ordered the chicken wings in their 'phaadhu'  sauce which was simply outstanding. It had been a while since I've had some good wings and MBFB wings were just awesome. 

Herb fried chicken - too good. The Mayo dip with it was just too good.

The big bong burger - the lamb preparation of the burger was just outstanding. The meat was so soft and so good, rich in flavor, was just melting in my mouth.

Lamb chops in red wine sauce - Again the preparation of lamb was just outstanding. So good so soft rich in flavors, the wine sauce was terrific. Just loved it.

Finally we had the 'squeezy' brownie with ice cream - I'm not sure if I've spelt it or said it correctly but you will know what I'm talking about. The brownie was simply delicious with home made chocolate sauce, just terrific. You can't just have one bite of it.

This place is a must visit. Hence, My big fat experience 5/5.

Loved everything about this place. The d√©cor, the music, the staffs, the ambiance, the food in short everything. Checked in to this place today evening with my sister. On our visit we were served with a welcome drink which was really refreshing and had a taste of watermelon infused. They have a wide array of choices from both beverages and food menu. We had ordered kiwi frappe mocktail (on suggestion), oreo and cream milkshake along with chicken shawarma and russian mafia sandwich. The mocktail was nicely made and had that original flavour of kiwi whereas the milkshake absolutely won our heart. Shawarma was good and the sandwich was worth the price. Their quality and quantity, both satisfy the prices. The manager was constantly attending his customers and was trying to help us with everything. Overall an excellent experience it was. Looking forward to visit you guys soon.

The moment  i entered the cafe i noticed it's  ceiling which was done with some old windows which had the old bengal feel..the interior has rustic feel..moving on to the food..We ordered a peach ice tea pitcher, oreo cream shake, lasagne, pizza, butterscotch and caramel shake, of which oreo cream shake was absolutely yumm... Lasagne was decent.. And pizza was nice and crisp.. Butterscotch and caramel shake and peach pitcher  were nice.. And in the we got a complimentary cheese cake which i think was a very sweet gesture.. All in all the place, food, service everything was good and the place is pocket friendly too.. So my experience was great..will definitely visit it again.

Located right opposite to the Dug Out caf√©,My Big Fat Belly is a small,cosy place bearing the resemblance of one of those American country side eateries.We ordered cold coffee,lemon iced tea and chicken stuffed burger which was served with onion rings and french fries.The quantity was ample and the food was more than amazing.The place has an appreciable interior and the staffs are polite and cordial.I am definitely going to visit this place again in the near future.

Small cute space, right opposite to the Dugout on Sarat Bose Road. Went in for a lunch. For starters had Gooey cheese cigars, served with a chilly cherry sauce and a texan mayo dip.
In main course we took The Big Bong Burger. It had Kosha lambmeat reduction cooked in the bong way, stacked with an egg poach, veggies, mustard and mayo; accompanied with onion rings and ghugni!! This dish is a must try. The next dish was Bacon bomb. Minced pork meat wrapped with bacon served with a spicy sauce and wok tossed veggies, was a true delight. 
Also took a cinnamon lime mojito! Great experience. Would surely visit again. 
Bellified! :D

The decor is nice and cozy. The food very very good. The things to try are the Paneer skewers, the pasta, and the cheesecake. The marwari masala mocktail was also different and refreshing. Really enjoyed the place and hope to visit soon. I really did leave with a big fat belly.

This was from my list of unexplored Kolkata restaurant and i really liked the food and the interior. ¬†You guys have really done a nice job with the old windows shutters and doors.¬†
Now come the food review. In the menu there are lots of innovative stuffs.¬†
We tried Stuff Chicken steak (to be safe) and pasta. The use of herds and cheese were perfect. Your style of preparing cold coffee is some thing which is new to the town. It goes just opposite with the name and thus makes it is a must try thing.¬†
Over all experience was good. Looking ahead to explore more from your menu in near future.

This is the place to be!! Dropped in for a quick meeting here and I was offered the most amazing shake one could have had. 
Butterscotch caramel shake. A thick concotion without any dilution. Perfect taste and topped with whipped cream. Must try.
Then came this oh so perfect brownie.
Soft and moist on the inside and perfectly crisped on the top. Served with vanilla ice cream,  a piece of chocolate and drizzled with chocolate sauce.
I am dropping by here for a full meal really soon.

My love for burgers, sliders, sandwiches and wraps is a saga worth celebrating. Fillings and dressings, with a touch of seasoning, between two pieces of bread are what my dreams are made up of. So the  ‚ÄòMy Big Fat Belly‚Äô, the newly opened place in Sarat Bose Road, is totally my kind of a place!

I loved their decor, the Apple-Cinnamon flavoured water, their Spinach-Cheese Bruschetta and their in-house dips (the strawberry-chilli dip is amazing!). When I went to My BFB, just a few days before they opened, to sample their menu, I whet my appetite with mocktails, salads, and pizzas, but made sure I had enough tummy space for the burgers on the menu.

The Russian Mafia Sandwich with juicy Chicken Chunks, Chicken Salami, Boiled Eggs, Garlic Aioli, Coleslaw and Cheddar Blend, is a killer of a sandwich. Big would be a severe understatement and at no point does it feel dry or boring.

Of their sliders, the Big Bong Burger with a filling of Pulled Lamb with Kasha Mangsho Reduction and the Babu Moshai having Aloo & Beetroot Chop with a good slathering of the Kasundi Mayo, are both worth trying. And being biased towards Kosha Mangsho, it goes without saying that the former impressed me to the T. However, my absolute favourite for the night was the Juicy Lucy ‚Äì a beautiful, big, bold burger with a delectable chicken patty, cheese and egg, served with onion rings. One bite into this, and I only had happy thoughts in my mind!

The Marwari Masala, a drink with a good punch of lime and green chilli, with a gola over it, was the perfect end to my hearty meal at the My Big Fat Belly. Mr. Bhargava, the gracious host, showed us the kitchen, and it was unbelievably organized and clean, that too after serving a line of varied dishes for us to taste. The person mixing the mocktails and shakes, is ready with his recommendations, and those his flavoured water deserves special mention.

P.S. Don‚Äôt miss their Squidgy Brownies. Just don‚Äôt!

On a rainy day almost drenched entered this place with my guy.I was super hungry.A warm welcome by the people.Very innovative menu..Ordered a pizza and a BFB cold coffee.
It was superb.The pizza was not the typical thin crust pizza like a "papad".Full of cheese and soft.
The dessert was yet another happy ending to my evening.
Very good hospitality.
Would definitely recommend this to all people looking out for good food at a pocket friendly price.
            
Thank you Kaushik & Mr.Aakarsh Bhargava,Mr.Chef and all others for the lovely hospitality..
Will visit again very soon...

New place !! Good interiors !! Amazing music !!

Food ?????

Food was good. Ordered quinoa salad which was amazing. The mushroom risotto balls were ok but the dip served was excelent

The margarita pizza ordered was very thin and crisp. The quality of mozrella used was also very good. But the sauce lacked the taste and was a bit low on salt.

Overall excelent place and loads of new stuffs on menu to try again. 

Can't wait to visit again.

One thing I forgot to mention was it's extremely pocket friendly. With most of the cafes in towns getting overpriced someone who prices correctly feels pocket friendly.

It's a must visit place

Located bang at the paddapukur crossing of Sarat Bose Road, ‚ÄúMy Big Fat Belly‚Äù stands where the erstwhile ‚ÄòThe Little Donkey‚Äô used to be. Headed by Aakarsh Bhargava , who has been In the food industry for quite sometime now, ‚ÄòMy Big Fat Belly‚Äô boasts of an impressive selection of staff handpicked by the ‚ÄòChief Belly Banger‚Äô as he likes to call himself. The staffs have been trained well, as is evident from their understanding of the menu, inspite of the fact that it has been finalised recently. The d√©cor too has been improvised in house. The quirky colour tones , with filament lamps & wood plank finish tables, gives the whole place a rustic feel. The most interesting part was use of windows & glass panes in the ceiling , & I have been told the glass panes will be used for some very interesting things in the futureüòâ .
As for the foodies, Rajdeep Bhattacharjee, Devpurna Talapatra, Archya Sengupta & myself were the ones invited for the tasting of the items.
My Big Fat Belly hopes to disrupt the current food scene of Kolkata. How much it can deliver on the promise was to be found out as the dishes started arriving from the kitchen.
I can tell you one thing, the sandwiches & burgers are to die for. Equally good are the pizzas. For details on the food do check out the full post...
