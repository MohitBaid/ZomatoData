It is a in-house restaurant of Rajasthan Guest House situated at Zakaria Street. It is famous for its delicious foods. I regularly visit this place for North Indian breakfast, lunch or dinner. My recent visit was for breakfast where I preferred Alu Paratha with Cholla and it was so delicious as always.

You will get always fresh prepared foods and I recommend its Paneer butter masala, Alu Sabzi, Chapati, Butter Nan, Gatta ki sabzi, Alu Paratha with chola & tea . Its south indian preparation is also very good.

Service is good, ambiance is good, a must try restaurant for delicious food where satisfaction is assured.

A famous place at Zakaria street. Very old restaurant with amazing Rajasthani food and Missi roti is a favourite. Proper fine dining restaurant but the location is too shabby. Guest house is good and food is even better but location is little difficult for south people to go and dine.

Located near M.G.Road Crossing, this place provides with a traditional Maadu (Marwari) dining food. Everything is alright but it does not stand that well to Thakur Mahal Restaurant which is very near to it.

I visited this place on 28/10/2015 for lunch. This place is very near to my office. Went there with a cousin of mine. 
Ambience is average. Staffs are well trained. Service is prompt. The dishes are served hot. Foods are not that expensive.
Food :
As it was a working day, so didnt ordered any starters or deserts. We ordered.. Mushroom paneer, chana masala, dal makhani, fulka, steam rice, papad & fresh lime soda.
Mushroom paneer.. It was very good.. First time had this combination together.. Must try..
Chana masala.. It was average.. 
Dal Makhani.. It was good.. It's pricing is high compare to other dishes..
Fulka.. It was soft.. Of the best I have ever had..
Steam rice.. Was regular.. Nothing special..
Fresh lime had perfect proportion of lemon n sugar.. Loved it..
Overall good experience.. Must try for people who look for pure veg restaurants..
Pocket pinch.. 500 for 2 (inclusive of tax).

Used to go long time back with family. Food is good. Quality n quantity both are great. Restaurant is divided into two floors. Ambience is simple. Pocket pinch is too low. Service is fast. Staff are cordial.

Pocket friendly restaurant - I like the simplicity of the food - stomach filling food- taste is good - don't think of hygiene and ambience just enjoy the good Marwari food - cant think of any special dish just try and enjoy the food

My favourite place for breakfast when I'm in this area. The aloo paratha with chana masala accompanied by tea just makes my day. The aloo paratha is completely different from what you can get anywhere else. This is the biggest vegetarian restaurant in Central Kolkata but has no great ambiance through the service is fast. The food feels fresh & often simple yet tasty! I recommend to pay a visit at least once.
