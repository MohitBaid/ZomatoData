This place use to serve good food before. Now taste has changed. I ordered special mutton biriyani and was disappointed. To my surprise the mutton pieces are undercooked and even the taste of biriyani itself has changed. Disappointed

First of all, this is my favourite Arsalan of all the Arsalan I have been to...The ambience is so elegant yet homely and the service is very impressive. The food, dear lord, is mouth-watering, mind-blowingly delicious. I generally have the special kebab, mutton/chicken biryani with mutton chap. The food is very tasty, especially the potato that comes with the biryani here, is very tasty. I would go here again and again.

‚ÄòKolkata Biriyani‚Äô and Arsalan is a deadly combination. Really misses that when I am not in Kolkata.

Whenever people of KOLKATA talk about Biryani, the name of ARSALAN restaurant comes to mind. It is basically a Mughlai specialty restaurant open since 2002. Biryani is their specialty and one of the most important and famous dish of Mughlai. This RESTAURANT is in the heart of the beautiful city KOLKATA. Close to the market and mall, importantly close to many of the public places. Arsalan have total number of eight outlets in KOLKATA and every outlet is situated in best location of KOLKATA.

In this restaurant we find various "‚ÄôNorth Indian‚Äô, Mughlai & Rolls" cuisines. Here we can find multiple non-veg food items and very few veg food items, all under one roof. Arsalan delivers many flavors in the form of various cuisines of ‚Äú‚ÄôNorth India‚Äô, Mughlai & Rolls.

Arsalan is a Muslim baby name. In Muslim the meaning of the name Arsalan is: Lion (or King of Jungle). According to the name this restaurant gives king feeling to its guest.

Around 11 days ago I visited this place to have dinner with 10 other family members, we all are of different age group. We all ordered multiple starters, dishes and desserts. I can say that it was overall a good and nice experience. 

Their service was not bad, I mean it was good and fast (quick).

Staff of Arsalan is very honest, friendly, courteous, energetic and care full.

I have to admit that each and every food item in starter as well as in main course was properly cooked and their quantity was good as well as sufficient. All of them are tasty and smells very nice. Also each and every dessert item was really fresh and tasty. The texture and presentation of every food item including desserts are simply superb. I love their every food item, it‚Äôs too good

People, 

Ambience was good upto a certain extent, but gives a royalty feeling.

'Cost of Food' is not high. If you want to eat good, hygienic as well as traditional veg and non-veg "‚ÄôNorth Indian‚Äô and Mughlai" food under one roof in good ambience than the cost is good and friendly to the pocket.

Long list of various cuisines in its menu, makes it difficult to decide (because here every dish is yummy and tasty).

I recommend this place to every person of KOLKATA to visit and have food here.

QUALITY OF FOOD: 4/5

QUANTITY OF FOOD: 4.5/5

HYGIENE: 4/5

SERVICE: 4/5

AMBIANCE: 3/5

HOSPITALITY: 4/5

COST OF FOOD: FRIENDLY TO THE POCKET

Food quality, quantity, hospitality, cleanliness, staff's behaviour everything is great.üëçüëç This the best of all branches, as the main branch is crowdy all-time..

An ultimate destination for Biryani Lovers!! The most common place from where I order for take away at least once in a month. Normally every one loves to have the famous aromatic dum cooked biryani served with the a chunk of meat and an aloo (this aloo melts in your mouth the moment you have a bite). Well, I have a different item which my favourite, The Mutton Stew... the original name of this dish was the Irani Mutton Stew. This was the name on the menu, when I first had this item.. with time they have changed the name as Customers doesn't prefer this dish much. I will strictly recommend this odd delicacy, for which this restaurant is least known for, rather this is a must have dish... have recommended this item to many and every one has come back and said this is an amazing item which they never knew off.

This time we tasted kebab platter... Fish kebab was mind blowing, mutton ribs excellent, chicken kebabs were good...
Next mutton biriyani... Wow... I mean how come they come they can cook the potato so softly... I love that... Nothing to say, but they are best...
Highly recommended for family to visit circus avenue outlet instead of park Circus...
Staffs are very energetic and courteous...
Service and decor are equally good...

There are other factors like ambience and behavior of the staff and all you have to keep in mind. I surely will not visit there again .horrible experience.

As a biryani lover, i sense biryani to be heaven and tasting biryani from arsalan really fulfils my heavenly wish. Biryani travelled regions it added flavours nd varities. This also added identities to different regions, Motiyon ki biryani from Lucknow, Hyderabadi from Hyderabad, Amritsari from Punjab and many more. Kolkata shares a special relationship with biryani nd arsalan contributes a lot to it.

PHIRNI-Sometimes i get surprised thinking how arsalans managed to make such highly thick, rich nd delicious Phirnis. Its origin from Persia nd now nearly travelled all over the world, its really a mouthwatering dish for the Indians. Known in different regions as payesh, gil-e-firdaus it gained a lot a fame. It is typically served as a desserts. I thnk everyone for once should taste phirnis from arsalan.

Arsalan is a biryani joint which definitely doesn‚Äôt need any introduction! Like me there are lakhs of others in Kolkata who take pride in saying that Arsalan Biryani is one of the best biryani‚Äôs served in the country...the aloo is quintessential in Kolkata biryani and Arsalan cooks it to perfection. Must haves would be mutton biryani, rashmi kabab and chicken rezala.

Chicken Butter Masala: Another decent dish.Tasted good.But it was way too oily.

Roomali & Tandoori Roti: Both were good in terms of taste & size.

One of the best biriyani i have ever had, add to that the outstanding mutton rizalla and mutton nalli gosht, this place is truly a mughlai food lover's paradise. The mutton pepper fry was great as well. It is definitely a must visit place anytime of the day.

Arsalan never fails to satisfy it‚Äôs customers. 
This outlet of the Biriyani giant, close to the AJC Bose Road Flyover is perfect for dinner or lunch dates with friends and family members! Given the cosy seating and courteous staff, it gives one the satisfaction of being properly sought after.
Coming to the food, as usual the fish kebabs were moist and tender, perfectly cooked with a beautiful blend of spices. The Tandoori Chicken pieces were quite big and filling. Mutton kebabs were nothing special, but yes, they did melt in our mouths. Dayyum ‚ù§Ô∏è .

What to write about Arsalan park circus? My favorite place for biryani since college days. Other than biryani I like their chicken reshmi butter masala and chicken chap. And to be mentioned their rolls are also great.

Arsalan is one of the top most mughlai joints serving in Calcutta since ages. 
The Mutton Boti Kebab & Bara kebab are excellent along with the regular chicken kebabs. Havent ventured much in terms of the gravy items save for mutton chap which is nice enough. Their USP is their Biryani and undoubtedly they serve the best Biryani in Calcutta. Their naan‚Äôs are huge so keep in mind before you order a particular quantity. 
This joint of Arsalan is comparatively a smaller one but the service is fast enough. Worth every penny.

I've always been a fan of Arsalan's foods, but this seems to have beaten it's own taratala branch in their taste. No doubt the service is good. The seating arrangements are good too. We ordered a plate of chicken reshmi kebab and two bottles of coke for starter. The kebab was 'wow'. The rich, creamy malai was lovely. The chicken was tender as it was perfectly cooked. You'll remember the taste long after you have left the place. Then we had a plate full of chicken biryani. The aroma of the dish was enough to make your mouth water. The aloo was rightly boiled, the chicken was tender as it was easily falling apart from the bones. The best thing about Arsalan is that they use good quality of oil and there is no chance for you to feel uncomfortable after a plate full of biryani. The service was good.

Located near the AJC Bose flyover, this is a small branch compared to others. They have two floors though. The interiors were cosy, but it was extremely dark. There was hardly any light for clicking pictures.

Coming to food. The pan fried momos were tough. The filling appeared to be stale. It was a wrong choice to order it.

The chicken tandoori was delicious. It was soft and juicy. It had a fresh taste unlike the momo.

Mutton boti kababs were extremely small. It was soft, but the marination was nothing great. It was okay. It did not bring out the feeling of moghlai food.

The fish tikka kabab was nice. Juicy tender fish cubes, spiced and cooked to perfection.

Butter nan was soft and big.

Chicken Reshmi butter masala was again very tasty. White gravy, cooked to perfection. The chicken pieces were big in size. It was delicately spiced, and the after taste was great.

Coming to the star of Moghlai food the biryani. The mutton piece was tender. The potato was soft and flavourful. The rice grains were long and spiced well. The biryani is a must here.

Welcome to the Gunda of all restaurants ‚ÄúArsalan Park Circus‚Äù. They have become the pioneer of Biryani and all Mughlai dishes hence they have the right to give no Fudge to customers anymore. Today I ordered some main courses and desserts and before doing so I called them and asked if they take ‚ÄúSodexo‚Äù (meal coupon) they person on phone said ‚ÄúJi Ji zaruur‚Äù (of course) so I went ahead and placed order when the ordered arrived I handed the delivery boy the Sodexo and he outrightly said I won‚Äôt take as we don‚Äôt take Sodexo. I told him to take it to the hotel if rejected il pay him. He went there and called me saying these people are refusing I immediately took over the call and said what is this, the guy on the phone shouted at me and said ‚Äúye nahi chalega aapko jisne bola h wo bewakuf hai‚Äù. He not only talked extremely rudely but he also had an attitude ‚ÄúYe arsalan h Kya karoge dekh lenge‚Äù 
Such terrible customer service and illiterate people will spoil your experience here, atleast in Park Circus, Please come here if you want to get manhandled by Muslim Gundas.

Was here on the 29th of September when I visited Kolkata during Durga Pujo. It was also my birthday. Arsalan has multiple locations in Kolkata like Paradise in Hyderabad. This specific restaurant near JCB flyover has the highest rating on Zomato, so we chose this one for lunch. This was a great decision and I was so happy after an appetizing lunch here. We had special chicken biriyani, assorted special non veg platter, chicken lahori and tandoori rotis. Every item was well prepared and was mouth-watering. I had one of the best biriyanis outside Hyderabad. The ambience of this specific restaurant is pleasant and service was satisfactory. The total bill was INR 1497 inclusive of the GST, which I think was reasonable. Will certainly go to this restaurant if I happen to be in Kolkata again.

I had heard a lot about Arsalan¬†and its famous biriyani from my friends in Kolkata since long and had been waiting to get a taste of it. So on my recent trip to Kolkata, I made it a point to visit this legendary restaurant. I went on a weekday around 9 pm and the AC section of the¬†restaurant was quite full. I was lucky to get a table all to myself since I went alone. In most of the Zomato reviews, people had recommended Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Arsalan tikka among other items. So I also ordered the same.¬†The food was served without much delay. Though I had no complaint about both the Biriyani and Tikka, it fell well short of my expectations which I had formed after reading so many rave reviews about it. The Biriyani was a bit too dry for my liking. The mutton and the potato was well cooked.¬† The chicken pieces in the tikka was a bit hard and were not as much tender as I had expected. The cheese coating on the tikka will not get down well with people who have got a spicy palate.The ambiance has not much to boast of and space inside is little cramped.The pricing is moderate considering the location of the restaurant. Overall if you don't go with high expectations, you might like the food

Arsalan is by far my most favourite place that serves Indian food. Their biriyani, though a bit costly but worth every penny, is so light and soft. Their lachha parantha is THE best lachha parantha I've tasted in kolkata. And the kebabs are equally delicious. I strongly recommend this place.

This is for all biryani lovers of Kolkata whose mouth starts watering at the slightest mention of the name Arsalan. It has been the same for me as well. Since its inception it has done wonders to our taste buds and now after around fifteen years Kolkatans are crazy for this mughlai dish prepared by the hallowed chefs of Arsalan. Arsalan was like a dream come true for all biryani lovers.

Yesterday was the day when this sweet dream was rudely destroyed by Arsalan of 28, Circus Avenue. I completed some urgent official work and visited Arsalan with all sweet memories that I had gathered for the last fifteen years alongwith my family. Well, mutton kakori kabab, was the one I was dreaming off along with some main course. The waiter straightaway told me that kakori kabab won't be available and have to select some thing from the chicken menu or one or two mutton menu. As Arsalan is not famous for kababs I did not bother and had some basic main course menu like Chicken achari butter masala and roti along with mutton boti kabab. My idea was to savour the biryani luxury at home and ordered for special mutton biryani and normal mutton biryani. The prices were a bit on the higher side but all good things must have some price and so I carried them home. Dinner time I received a biryani shock of my life. The biryani that I got from Arsalan was much similar to the ones served on the roadside for a paltry sum. Though the rice was a bit standard the rudest shock came in the form of mutton. The size has nearly halved compared even to a year back and the soft succulent mutton pieces of yore has become a folk lore and in its stead hard and small mutton pieces could be found inside the rice. Even the chicken egg has come down to koel egg size.

Really, it was like attending the funeral of a dear one who was very much closest to the heart. I would be definitely eating in Arsalan in future as well but the blind faith has taken a backseat now and I would be more cynical in my approach --- not expecting the best or even a good standard biryani offering from them.

Hope this review may have a little effect on the management of Arsalan.

I have been having here since ages and it is my favorite biriyani place. I love their Mutton Biriyani. The tender mutton piece is love and the aloo is perfectly cooked. My other favorite is Chicken arsalan kabab which is chicken kabab covered with cheese. It is absolutely delicious.
The staff is courteous and attentive. I have loved almost all my visits here.

Situated in the park circus seven point crossing this Restaurant serves probably one of the best biryanis of Kolkata. The biryani lovers feel orgasm while passing by this restro. Visited many times but never had the opportunity to take picture as we were busy in finishing the plate full of yellow rice with soft aloo with a tender piece of mutton full of mouth watering flavour.Few days back ordered food through Zomato and was able to take pictures. We had Mutton biryani(of course) with chicken bharta and chicken chaap with nun. The side dishes were tasty too and the breads were soft. As dessert we had Firni.. Arsalan has always been a lovely experience for me and never disappointed any biryani lovers. Some may tell that its too oily- for them Biryani is not the right choice.ü§ì

Had dinner here on Shosti night! The place was very crowded given the occasion but we did manage to get our seats after sometime. We had ordered Chicken Tengri kebab, it was quite delicious, the chicken was tender and very tasty, I didn't like the dip much though, then we had chicken biryani, I had a lot of expectations because of all the praises that I heard about Arsalan's biryani but it tasted ordinary, may be because of the pujas! we also ordered butter nun and mutton kassa, the nun was quite tender but the mutton tasted too sweet! Generally during the pujas the quality of the food in the restaurants tend to lower so I'm looking forward to giving it another visit and hope to have a better experience!

The mutton in the mutton biriyani is melt in your mouth and their special chicken cheese kabab is too special for words. The ambience of the AC restaurant upstairs is better than the non AC one downstairs. This branch is the original Arsalan and according to me the best one to buy your biriyani from. One plate of Arsalan's mutton biriyani and you will know why the Kolkata Biriyani is the best Biriyani there is!

I am in love with their Biryani and it happens that those who love their Biryani generally do not like it from elsewhere. Its greasy, comes with overcooked aloo and if you are lucky you may get a bit charred portion of aloo and soft tender meat. Quantitywise its more than satisfactory. Another side dish which I like is their mutton stew.

As we all know that Arsalan is a famous renowned restaurant for Mughlai dishes (especially for Biriyani). We always like to eat Biriyani from Arsalan.

So we went to the Park Circus outlet at the time of Durga Puja on 26th September. We had ordered for 10 packets of Mutton Biriyani and 5 packets of Firni. Then after reaching home, we saw that  we had received a packet of Egg Biriyani instead of Mutton Biriyani because there wasn't any piece of Mutton. But we had paid the whole money of Mutton Biriyani. We didn‚Äôt believe that we had been cheated by such a reputed restaurant.

CHICKEN RESHMI KEBAB also tastes lovely here..

One of their specialities is ARSALAN SPECIAL KEBAB...which is actually the Chicken Cheese Kebab i.e. big pieces of Reshmi Chicken wrapped in a thick layer of cheese...
Their FIRNI is good too... :)
Ambiance and interiors of the new Park Street branch and the new Ruby branch are lovely... :)

Had visited this place a week back after nearly a year or so. Can't help but point out the degradation in their standards. The quantity is not the only thing that has decreased. Quality deterioration was also noticed as both the plates we had ordered contained semi-boiled pieces of potato. Only after complaining twice was a boiled piece of potato brought to us. The size of the pieces of meat have shrinked like anything and the biryani tasted just bland more than anything. Though yes the Arsalan i remember used to produce a very very oily biryani from which they considerably improved with the biryani containing less oil these days. The meat also wasn't tender at all, it was quite stiff. Though the floor lead guy was courteous, the remainder of the guys serving the customers were pathetic. Like who brings a dirty spoon to the table and then takes an hour to change the spoon when you're done with the food. And the other thing i would like to point out is the delay in service. A biryani is not something that requires preparation every time a customer places an order. Therefore, waiting for 20 mins after placing your order while the people sitting at the table next to you get their order within 10 mins of placing their order even though they've arrived later than you is unacceptable. Absolutely Pathetic.

The biriyani is excellent but I think it is overpriced.  Also I do not understand why they charge 18% GST for the take away customer, when I am really not enjoying the AC for which I am paying the premium. I request ZOMATO to intervene and this is completely unfair.  Iam sure all the take away customers have this same query.

Quality of their food certainly justifies their fame. Biryani is the star attraction here. Though I would also like to mention that the Tandoori Chicken Butter Masala that I ordered was awesome!! I got two large sized breasts with rich gravy and the taste was overwhleming. The biryani though a bit spicy for my platter is certainly a recommendation and is equally tasty. But what I was not impressed by was the price tag that comes along. Biryani now costs 220 rupees excluding taxes which I think is bit pricey and certainly not appealing to many middle class budgets.

Yesterday we had ordered for Mutton , Chicken and veg biriyani. Very dissapointed to see the degradation of Arsalans quality. The Rice seemed to be prepared long back, mutton/ chicken pieces were small and the veg biriyani was simply unpalatable.

The Indian food is pretty good but I'd highly not recommend eating the Chinese food here as it is quite bland and tasteless. However the Biriyani is heavenly and delightful. My personal favorite is the Mutton Biriyani.

A great place for having Biryani at its best taste.Had visited Arsalan  a number of times and had a great xperience....üòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è...Arsalan, to me, is the best place in kolkata to hangout wid frnds and family....Its a great place to spend facetive evenings...I always use make plans with my buddies for having biryani...Specially Mutton Biryani is d best item to be ordered in Arsalan...The price Arsalan charges best price for the items they order..I will prefer people who are planning of hanging out in the coming festive season to visit Arsalan once.I can guarantee they will again visit again in a short notice in Arsalan..I have enjoyed some of my special moments at Arsalan. I will grade Arsalan as the best restaurent that kolkata have. Hope Arsalan will inprove in future more by serving the bestest Biryani to its customers.

Ordered chicken tangri kabab..They called and changed it to chicken tandoori as the latter was not available. Chicken tandoori was stale and the meat was rotten. Had to throw it all after the 1st bite. Disgusting service. When I called to inform them about it they blatantly said that they are closed now and nothing can be done. Very much upset with one of the leading food brands.

Horrible!!!! Arsalan the bane synonymous to great food..  has lost its glory. Be it dining or delivery. We went in April,ordered Mutton Biriyani... the food which came was tasteless.
Once I ordered via zomato.... biriyani of course... they delivered some parathas and rotis... 
Today we ordered 2 mutton biriyanis... got 1 mutton and one egg biriyani. The egg biriyani still had some flavour.
The mutton biriyani had white rice with a few strands of yellow rice and a mutton as chewy  as a rubber. Even the potato was not boiled properly.
Being a foody..  Am striking off Arsalan until it improves again.

First thing that you notice when you reach here is, people. Alot of people. Alot! People outside waiting, people inside eating and people roaming about.
If you wanna come here for peaceful dining then this is not the place but if you are here for food then let me tell you, you are in the right place. 
(The biryani monster in me was lured here by the sweet smell)
Been here twice, never disappointed. The quality and taste is top notch. We ordered a biryani special and kebabs. Delicious!

Would love to go there again.

My all time favourite restaurant... Whenever I am out with my family..it's like a rule to go to Arsalan to have dinner/lunch..no matter how much tired or exhausted we are... If we don't have the energy..we will pack the food and bring it home rather... But..won't be back without Arsalan's food... And the Biryani... Every time I have it..it literally makes me speechless... I have never had such delicious Biryani till date... For me..Arsalan's Biryani is like Kolkata's best Biryani..whether it is Mutton or Chicken...  Looking forward to visiting Arsalan soon...

1) Biriyani - 5/5. Nothing is there to beat this Biriyani flavour for a Bong person. The tenderness of rice, aroma and softness of chicken pieces, can't be compared. A Real Benchmark.

2) Kebabs - I have tried almost all kebabs. All are awesome. Once, i was served kebabs, which were not at all hot. So, rated 4.5

3) Firni - Definitely worth a try.

Hearing so many good things about the restaurant, one just couldn't resist the temptation of heading there.
But the biryani was a let down(i know bengali's are gonna kill me for this). I prefer the north indian Mughalai or hyderabadi biryani over this any-day.

But a blessing in disguise was - mutton pashinda and naan which is a must have at this place.

Ambiance - 3/5
Food -4/5
Waiting time - 0/5 (you can be standing out there for hours)

This outlet needs no introduction and rightly so..a landmark in itself serving the best biryanis and kebabs in town..coming to the food..their mutton biryani would make u hungry for more..succulent juicy mutton piece and quantity is also adequate..mutton stew and mutton chanp is out of the world..though i liked the stew better..though newer cuisines have erupted and crowded beside these outlets but the Biryani loyalists and every foodie who has tasted their stuff would agree that its surely amongst the best and keeps growing with each passing day..

Located in Park Circus this resturant is a delight to every foodie. My love for food knows no bound and one dish for which I am even ready to pay thousands of bucks is Biriyani . I had ordered Chicken Biriyani and Firni. There's no many resturants in Kolkata where you can taste the North Indian delicacy yet Arsalan is the best as tge biriyani served over here is not so dry. The rice was well cooked and it was moist ,the chicken pieces were so soft and tender and they taste of it is heavenly. The quantity and the quality both is great. And the next one was even more special- the firni. I loved my experience over there and have visited the place a lot of time later as well. There's so many outlet in and around the city so go and venture the store as soon as you can.

Arsalan probably serves the best "iconic" Kolkata biriyani......the special biriyani is what one should opt for - two succulent, melt-in-the-mouth mutton pieces, an equally soft and heavenly piece of potato and a boiled egg adorn the delectable long grain cooked-to-perfection bed of rice in truly the "made-for-one-another"manner. Sample any of the kebabs in their menu; the special Arsalan Kebab cooked with cheese, a real innovation, is worth a definite-try......the circus avenue joint offers some unbelievably good Chinese fare too!!! A food lover's - PARADISE - period.

If you asked anyone in Kolkata about the food joints and specialities.. Arsalan will always be in their list and it's speciality is, like everyone knows, BIRYANI! I have tried their mutton biryani and chicken chaap, good enough to meet ones expectations from that legendary place. 
I am a great time biryani lover and I have found it to be good but not out of the world. I will rate them 4.5/5 that's almost close to a full mark, right? 
The price is quite reasonable and you will find it crowded every time you go there. They have nice and decent seating arrangements where you can comfortably eat your food. The staff's behaviour was also good. 
If you are at Kolkata, not miss the chance to taste the awesome juicy, mutton biryani at this place.. Kolkata's pride - ARSALAN.

Visited them recently with a business associate as he recommended the outlet. An elderly employee with an eye for detail spotted us and came to take the order. Appearing confused, we were unable to decide on what to order when he advised us to order 2 chicken biryanis with mutton stew. The food was simply amazing and delicious. We were still hungry for more yummy food when the waiter (Azam I think) again came to our rescue. He advised us to order Chicken Lahori with khammeeri Roti which again turned out to be amazing. Full marks to them only for the food. Half mark deducted on account of poor ambience.

Biriyani King of the town

Any food enthusiast‚Äôs diary in Kolkata is not complete if there is no mention of Arsalan. So here is the review of my favourite Biriyani joint in Kolkata.
This outlet of Arsalan is the closest to its main branch and is located at the starting of the AJC Bose road flyover near Park Circus crossing. We ordered an Arsalan Special Biriyani, a masala Kulcha and a Murg Makhani. The biriyani was as usual not rich and non-oily and tasted heavenly. The masala kulcha was stuffed and filling while the murg makhana had big chunks of chicken and the taste was awesome. However, the chickens seemed a little hard though. The service was okayish and the serving time can be reduced a bit.
Cash and card was accepted. Parking is available in front of the restaurant, under the flyover. 
Definitely recommended.

Have visited this place a numerous times. Though nowadays I hear some people complaining about arsalan's food quality,i always had a soft corner.I went to arsalan 2 days ago as I was dying to get some good malai kababs. Ordered a plate each of mutton biryani and chicken biryani. And ofcourse a malai kabab. The malai kabab totally disappointed me as there was no speciality. It just tasted like a regular kabab. Now coming to the chicken biryani. As for Arsalan,this wasn't which I expected. Lost the old smell,elegance and charm of a typical arsalan biryani. I had high hopes on returning to arsalan. But this time I was only left disappointed. And I think they were right when people said this place is losing it.

Ok..now i was confused about how much to rate..

The place isn't aesthetically pleasing.. ground floor non-ac ...1st floor a.c... but 1st floor is very cringy..thats what i felt. Actually, I don't know how many people will agree..but i feel if i m going out to have good food..i would prefer a place with a good decor. Though these are secondary things,food is the main concern.. but still.. it can b because i expect more.. don't knw....

Food... Yes it's an ultimate destination for biryani..so biryani there is obviously good.. I love both mutton and chicken biryani.
Three dishes that i'll talk about.. that i absolutely love..and actually eat whenever i get that chance..
HALEEM...SHAHI TUKRA...TENGRI CHICKEN...!!!!

According to what my taste buds felt.. the haleem here is the best of allüòçüòçquality quantity..A++
Shahi tukra...is laajawab.
During Ramzan .. along with my friends..i never miss these two items.. absolute delicacies!!!!

And for tengri chicken.. the aroma..that charcoal smell..that texture..that gravy...is just superb..!!

I really hope that they improve on their decor.. though that will increase the cost i think..üòú

I had a very disappointing experience with Circus Avenue Arsalan last night. I have been visiting this particular outlet since a very long time and now I can say that this outlet is the worst outlet now. The reason being the chefs keep on changing very often which leads to change in taste of a particular dish for which I visit Arsalan. It's been happening since a very long time so I decided to share my experience. The Second reason is the AC are just for show. It doesn't work properly. The last reason is unhygienic washroom. Low maintenance. 
Had a very disappointing experience.

Who can miss the Biriyani of this place? It is light. Flavourful. Perfect chicken. Perfect Aloo to go with it. The aroma of the Biriyani here is amazing. It is quite difficult to get a seat here during afternoon. We had waited for around an hour to get a seat. 
We ordered Chicken Tengri Kabab, Chicken Biriyanis and Chicken Chaanp. 
Wanted to have Firni but by the time we finished our Biriyanis, we had no place for it! 
Service is prompt. Ac seating is cozy but if you are looking for some privacy then this ain't for you! :(

Located near 7 point crossing its One of the best place for biriyani lovers!!..Been there few days back for lunch..Coming to food we had Chicken Biriyani which was as usual delightful.. Quantity is sufficient..The combination of aromatic rice with perfectly cooked chicken makes it taste flavorful.. Staffs are also courteous and ambience is also good..

Amazing as always...ordered mutton biriyani via zomato..prompt delivery. The biriyani was tasty as always. The chicken pieces were pretty big. On most restros,what we see is the quantity during home delivery is much less than that in restro itself. But the quantity was also very good.

When it comes to biryani, the place has to be Arsalan, Park Circus. This place needs no introduction and no explanation. Undoubtedly the best place to have biryani in the city. Located at the heart of city, exactly at the Park Circus Seven Point Crossing. Nevertheless this legendary outlet knows no critics and I'm not gonna be the one.

Totally dissapointed. Whatever we were ordering, the waiter was simply letting us know that it was unavailable. They were infact recommending mutton or chicken biriyani ( according to them, it is the only typ of biriyani which is good). The menu card was listed with variety of biriyanis (almost all were unavailable). Parcel during durga puja is again a big NO. I feel arsalan at majherhat (opp - mint)  and arsalan Ruby are much better.

Each and everything was delicious. They have started serving chinese too so I am definitely going to try the Chinese items on my next visit.

Being a Biriyani Monster, Arsalan is heaven for me...
It never happened that I passed from park circus area  without visiting Arsalan...
It has two areas, Non-Ac and Ac...the non-ac area is a open space with tables and chairs and big fans here and there...nothing special about it's interior or ambience...The AC area is upstairs and the ambience is perfect to taste the heavenly Mughal delicacies...Blue toned lighting, cold and soothing ambience, nicely arranged tables etc..

I haven't found the stuff friendlier than this Arsalan outlet anywhere..They treats us like their children and addresses us with "Beta"...It gives a homely feeling...I don't know they treat every customer like this or only the frequent visitors like me..And most importantly, the stuff give the best suggestion on the dishes we should order...I really love their behavior and hospitality...
Now coming to the food, well if you are a avid biriyani lover like me, Arsalan is the best place to head to...They serve many options in biriyani but I prefer the mutton special biriyani for 2 people most of the time ..they serve the most mouth watering kababs and side dishes...I love the sweet dishes as well...and don't forget to try the oh so good mutton/chicken Halim in the season of Eid... it's authentic and delicious!!
Overall, Arsalan is a zone for foodies and people who love Mughal cuisine...

So when we were casually talking about the best Biriyanis in town at work, I like a fool just blurted out that I had never been to Arsalan and the looks I got (Man! What looks!) made me make a mental note- "this weekend, Arsalan it is."

This was a few years back ok.. and the irony of it all is that when at Arsalan, I love the kebabs, namely the Chef's Special Chicken Kebab and Mutton Kebabs, like crazy like crazy crazy! The Biriyani is good too but I have had lighter Biriyanis but hey, occassionally I like digging into the Mutton Biriyani here ok. The place is a little chaotic so mostly we get our food packed. The staff is good, the price-point decent and the kebabs fix your food mood for an entire week. What else do you need?

And ah yes! Each time I miss out on the Ramzan special menu (the haleem is a delight I have heard). I am really hoping I make it some day. Till then, keep up the good work Arsalan! You are Calcutta's own. :)

Located in Park Circus area this is one of the best places to have Biriyani in Kolkata. Living upto it's name this place remains crowded almost every time I visit.
The service and ambience is pretty decent. As far as the food goes, the Mutton biriyani and the Chicken biriyani are a delight . The Mutton and Chicken chap are too good. The Chicken hariyali kabab and the chicken kakori kababs taste heavenly .
To conclude the food is pretty good especially the Biriyani. It's a must visit for all Biriyani lovers.

This was my second visit to this Arsalan outlet,  the first visit being years ago. I dropped in here for a late night dinner with my family. This time we wanted to have Naan and curry items instead of Biriyani. So we ordered butter Naan with chicken chap and Arsalan special chicken. The chicken chap was perfect with whitish gravy. We loved Arsalan special chicken. It was yummy.  It was perfectly buttery,  with right combination of sweet and spicy gravy.  The surprise item was navratna pulao. It had generous amount of saut√©ed veggies and chunky fruits with fried onions which gave it a nice smoky flavor. The pulao tasted so good that we gobbled it up in no time.  The pulao is perfect for kids. Truly Arsalan never disappoints :)

We went there last December at noon. Place was too crowded and we were hungry. So we agreed to sit in the ground floor area and not the upstairs air conditioned encclosure but little did we know that meant sharing tables with utter strangers. But well hungry stomachs didn't see any point I'm complaining. We ordered chicken biriyani with arsalan chicken kebabs. The cheese wrapped kebabs were heavenly. Biriyani was good, if not great. But the phirni ordered last tasted the best. Will be going back again for all three.

Well..the name 'Arsalan' has become synonymous with biryani in Kolkata. This is my undisputed go to place whenever I crave for some delicious and lip smacking biryani.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The ambience though is an area I feel they can improve, service is satisfactory.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Tried out mutton biryani, Chicken Chap, Laccha paratha, Chicken Tandoori Butter masala, Fish tikka masala.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† ¬†
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Cannot really complain about the food, there is a reason why they have created such a goodwill in Kolkata and they deserve every bit of it.

FINAL VERDICT- Definitely recommended, biryani is a must try here for all, and also do try out the dish Chicken Tandoori butter masala, its a personal favorite of mine.

They simply serve the best haleem in town .. being a hardcore Haleem fan I cannot resist going there all the time during the month of Ramzan only for the sake of mutton Haleem . Price is definitely high.

 In case of biryani most of the times I m not happy with the chicken or mutton pieces they serve . Gone are those days when Arsalan used to be the KING of BIRYANI in town .Their quality has detoriated a lot over the years .It mostly survives on its past name now .Once the mutton had only bones n very little flesh ..Another time it had only fat .. once the leg piece of chicken was too thin .. many a times I had to ask them to change the piece ...Maybe I have had better biryani experiences at less than half the price that's why it wasn't so appeasing ..  Spending 210 for biryani and not getting a good meat piece is not something I am fond of , spcly when I have had better chicken biryani at just rs.70 ..  So I go there mostly for the haleem.
Another thing the ambience is a bit noisy and poorly .. The staffs r polite and courteous  but somehow they always expect their  customers for a tip which is not always possible!

One of the best places in Kolkata to have biryani and mughlai food. Located right at seven point, it always attracts heavy footfall. Known as one of the best, if not the best, biryani joints in the city boasting of Kolkata biryani with the trademark aloo, it did not disappoint us. Reshmi kebab and mutton chaap was also pretty good.

Order any item here - and I mean any item - you won't go wrong. 

There might be dozens of good biryani restaurent in Kolkata, but these guys serve the best stuff - both mutton and chicken. The only other places other than Arsalan where I long to go and eat biryani is  Haji restaurant in Dhaka, and another place in Bahrain.

Short and simple recommendation -
Cheese chicken kabab
Mutton Rezala
Chicken stew
Either of chk or mttn biryani

This is one of those businesses which has not gone down on quality even after adding so many outlets.

Arsalan at Circus Avenue in Kolkata has a pathetic Home delivery structure. If you are ordering through Swiggy then perhaps they will serve you on priority, but if you are ordering directly then forget about the delivery on time. It will never reach on time. Prices had increased but home delivery service had declined alarmingly. The owners are quite decent and are always helpful, since I know them personally, but as they are busy looking after other outlets the Circus Avenue outlet had been ignored while they handed over it to the Manager and staffs who are not able to handle situation competently.

I received biryanee with bones instead of chicken .Egg was missing and only one piece of potatoes in a special chicken biryani .There was so much left over oil in the container that I could cook 2 meals out of it .Really depressing .Hope the place gets back to how it was

6 years ago I had seen Arslan through my taxi window whilst travelling to the airport and wished I could dine here because of the amazing things I had heard about it. 
Finally dined here and was pleased. 
The restaurant is crowded and chaotic. That's how heritage places are and will continue to be if the food's good. The service will not be smooth in weekends and rush hours and it's definitely not a place of leisure. It's a place of grab a table, oder asap, gulp, burp and leave with amazing taste lingering. 
Almost everything from biriyani to kebabs to curries to firni is slurping. Meat is of finest quality. And very light on pocket. I prefer the AC seating. Will go again to try the rolls. 
Am writing this after 3 visits and hence my ratings.

the special Kabab they offer which is wrapped with cheese that is one of its kind and have a unique Complex flavour only Arsenal can offer. I will strongly recommend everyone to taste that.
coming to the other items , Biryani is quiet good and the quantity more than sufficient for 1.5 person.
although I rated this restaurant as 4 there is a significant area of improvement in the ambience and presentation.

The biryani was light, chicken very well cooked, potato had all the flavors and was properly boiled. We ordered a chicken dude dish, something lahori, it was very oily but tasty. And last but not the least we had firni. Quantity of food is good for two. Certainly the best biryani and firni in town.

The quality of the Biriyani rice was very good. It full of that yummilicious flavour and its not at all oily. The size of the Mutton piece was good. It was so soft and tender¬†.The Kebabs were delicious. The chicken was literally melting inside the mouth.Finally, the Firni. It is the dessert that makes a meal perfect. The Firni was the best. I just loved it.Had an amazing lunch!We had to wait for around 20 mins after order ,as we ordered for the Kebabs first. Otherwise, the service was satisfactory.

Most calcuttans will not hesitate to vouch for Arsalan as having the best biryani in town, also serves the best firni in town . Despite its reputation at the top it also provides the best service and holds the longest weekend waiting lines in any restaurant in Kolkata. Food is very good and this is a legendary restaurant , I would never say no to a plan to Arsalan. Ambiance is overcrowded however it's worth the wait for the food. try their chicken chaap and Arsalan special chicken cheese kabab.

A visit to Kolkata always calls for a biryani treat to this restaurant. I feel the biryani here is the authentic Modified Awadhi Biryani i.e the Kolkata Biryani. We ordered for Special Mutton Biryani, Reshmi Kabab, Firni and Sprite. The biryani was just perfect with the mutton pieces melting in the mouth...reshmi kabab was just as the name suggests as soft and fine as resham...the cherry on the cake was the Firni...I can't have enough of the firni here. The staff is courteous. Overall a very good experience.

One of the busiest places in town..like they are always so full! Especially during any occasion. Everyone knows Arsalan offers the best North Indian cuisine in town at the most affordable price. Their best item is the Double Biryani and the Cheese Chicken Kabaab. The mutton is always so soft and tender, so is the aloo in the Biryani. But don't think Biryani 's all waht Arsalan is all about-try out their Kashmiri Pulao. It is my eatout place for every month. But they have been making a lot of mistakes during delivery. Also once a hair was spotted inside my half-eaten Phirni. I showed it to the waiter and he got me a full, new one. I would say service is good enough. Otherwise, my favourite!

Out of all the many outlets this old age 'legendary' restaurant,we went to the beck Bagan,circus Avenue outlet.Me being a vegeterian, its fame of being a biryani and primarily non veg was playing in my mind , however,the same was demolished after trying the dishes especially the mushroom starters.another item needing special mention is the flat breads,all of them.the feedback and reaction of my non vegetarian colleague's also validated the choice of the restaurant as a safe bet on any day of your craving.we as a group ordered around 20 -25 items and most of the items turned upto our expectations.the point of grouse however was that the staff seemed to decide the quality of service based on the eventual bill being racked up which also reflected in the n number of faces hovering around the table at the time of payment expecting fat tips.good food and a safe bet nonetheless.

Food is great, nothing new to add there but porno can be better, service and ambience can be better.. difficult to get parking and long waiting for take away orders makes you think twice before going...

India restaurant khiderpore is far better than Arsalan or shiraaz in everything‚Äã starting from food, ambience, pocket pinch , hygiene etc. This place is d Salman Khan of biryani world movie chahe kaisa bhi ho 100 crore toh kama hi lega.

Kolkatas answer to Hyderabadi biryani is the bengali  biryani, the aalu wala mutton biryani, and what better place to have it, than at the experts, arsalan. 
We all know the place, the busy grounf floor, and the small lil upper floor for families. 
The waiter was everything we desire in a food guide, guiding us thru the best dishes, how much should we order and when.
We finally ordered mutton biryani, raita, chicken chaap and chicken cheese kebabs(starters)
While the biryani was great the chap so average i was frankly disappointed. 
Nevertheless legendary food knows no critics and i am not gonna be one. 
Service was great, albeit a lil slow! 
Food was ofcourse inexpensive :)

One of my all time favorite restaurant at Kolkata. This place is quieter than the park circus branch. We just keep going back to this place. I just love the mutton biriyani here and the firni. This place is always full on a friday or saturday evening. If you are a biriyani lover then this is a must visit place.

OMG! I am a faithfull followers of Arsalan for years and especially of the Park Circus main branch. I love almost whatever they serve and my favourites are mutton biriyani, cheese kabab and mutton rogan josh.     Though I now stay out of Kolkata but I make it an agenda to visit this place every time I come to Kolkata.

No doubt it's the best place in kolkata to have biriyani. From the first time I have biriyani here to till date the taste is same and excellent. The mutton in the rice almost melts in the mouth . Mutton rezala and chicken kakori kebab is also delicious. And at last the firni gives a perfect ending . Countless  time I visited here and countless time I will visit later. And I know every biriyani lovers think this.

I ordered a fish tikka and roomali roti for take away, when I opened the package at home it was chicken biryani and some kabab. 
While I was waiting for my take away, I thought of trying the mutton kakori roll, I requested not to add any sauce, I was given a completely cold roll which was full of tomato sauce!!
Then I ordered another double chicken roll without any sauce, once again served a roll full of tomato and chilly sauce. I told them to change it this time as I had had enough, the guy simply removed the fillings from my roll and put sm chicken and gave it back to me completely cold!
Never again trying this silly joint...

Biriyani love has always dragged me to Arsalan...
Though I have tried biriyani in various parts of the country, Kolkata biriyani has this magic that makes it peerless...and Arsalan, without disappointing, serves one of the best biriyani in the city.... Simple antique interior....nominal rate and awesome quality as well as quantity... service is good...if you are new in Kolkata city...do try this place...Nd if you have been residing here for a long time now...you already know ...

I just love the Briyani available here, being a Briyani lover the fast thing that comes in mind if I want to have Briyani is Arsalan or it's branches. Anyways the kawabs are also pretty good even the laccha paratha available here is quite good. Overall the foods are quite good. Prices ok compared to the quality without tax, with tax I won't tell anything as I hate paying large amount behind food tax.

I have been to this place a couple of times for dine in with friends and have parceled food for home a numerous amount of time. Recent visit 15/04/2017. Arsalan especially the branch at park circus one is the best till now in Kolkata. I have been to other outlets but this outlet has its own authenticity. The biryani whether chicken or mutton is the best in the town. The chicken and mutton is cooked so perfectly and is so tender that your taste buds will keep asking for more and more and more.

Food and presentation- First talking about the food it is just-just-just amazing I'll rate it 4.5 out 5. I would deduct 0.5 because I found the oil in the matar paneer was a bit high. Yes, we took one Matar paneer and one of my friends is vegetarian. Chicken biryani requires no description once you grab it will just pamper your taste buds and you will keep having it until it's finished. Kebabs are delicious. Chicken melts in the mouth like Sandesh. Talking about presentation it's pretty simple no extravagant like some 5-star restaurant. Simple and clean white plates for biryani and served with lots of love. For parceled food, the quality is the same as they serve. Big chicken pieces in biryani and the amount they serve is pretty much good enough to fill your tummy.

Ambiance- lovely ambiance. They have two stories. The upper one is AC and the lower one is NON AC. If you are here for food you won't care about AC and NON AC. The decor of the restaurant is pretty good.

Customer service- One of the best in town. Warm welcome. You get a table ASAP if you are not here on a rush day. On the rush day, you would have to line up just like you lined up in banks during demonetization?. No extra charges on festivals or so. Taxes are 20.5% in total. The staff is friendly and good. Washrooms are well maintained. And if you parcel food they provide you with the strongest containers in the market.

Value for money- we were three people and our was merely 800/- INR so yeah pretty cheap. We had a lot of food. Definitely value for money and a must visit for every foodie.

Definitely recommended. Have a good time.

This place is very close to most kolkata people for their love of Biriyani. I am no exception. This particular outlet near AJC Bose road fly over has the best dining experience.the old Kolkata nostalgic decor adds up to it. 
Food...mutton special Biriyani...godly .
Arsalan special cheese kebab ... killer.
Firni..perfect way to end the Nawabi cuisine.
For anybody who wants to eat Calcutta Biriyani...this is Ur place buddy.
I have had to pack Arsalan Biriyani and fly them across country for Bengali friends staying there.thts the craze.

Completely Loved the place. This is one of the best places in town that you can think of. Time and again I have visited this place and the best thing about this particular restaurant is the ambiance that thy have. Engrossing. The food is equally good and is as mouth watering as you can possibly think of. Obviously, had ordered a biriyani and as always, the dish was well garnished and served smoking hot. And the firni, at after the heavy meal, was completely a delight! Loved to be there! Hope to be back soon!

To be a true Calcuttan, you need to eat at least once in Arsalan Park Circus. Renowned to be the best of the best with the delicious biriyanis, chaps, kebabs and several other marvelous items. The interior is wonderfully decorated. However, parking is quite a headache here.

We have visited arsalan for the first time ....We are from Mumbai....And now I can say that why Mumbai hotels are better in every aspect than kolkata.
The following were the specialities which were observed by us during our visit in arsalan...
1.  No spoons or plates were made available ...We had to literally beg for it
2. We were in the middle of our course when our bill came ...So no time to place order for other foods.
3. No respect for the time of customer ...No warm wishes for customer ...As we get Everytime Mumbai irrespective of customer's footfall.....Learn from shalimar hotel chain in bycullla Mumbai.



I don't know how did it get ratings from zomato ,. Burp...Arsalan ...The pretended famous name in Kolkata ....LOL.

When it comes to "Biryani", it has to be Arsalan. A practice since childhood, where religiously we only savoured Arsalan's Biryani. ¬†As a non-biryani lover, it was only Arsalan which was flavoursome.Even though jam-packed, making it nearly impossible to get into the restaurant at once. But I guess, the wait is worthwhile. Hygiene could be improved much more. Otherwise, prompt service and excellent north Indian food are available here.

Without bragging, no other biryani in the country beats Kolkata style biryani. There have been ongoing debates about which is the best biryani in the city and after trying a lot of biryani (literally, A LOT) I can safely conclude Arsalan biryani is the best biryani in the city. Other items you can try out- Special Fish Masala Kebab, Chicken Chaap, Chicken Butter Masala and their spectacularly soft romali roti.

When you are at arsalan you will be there for the biryani undoubtedly.  Since I belong to Mumbai I was really surprised by the mildly spiced biryani here. It was so flavourful.. it was an aromatic break from the Mumbai styles dum biryani. I loved the spread with the egg and potato. Also when at arsalan DO NOT miss their arsalan special chicken kebab. They serve it with a very twisty tangy chutney (which in itself is very delectable btw). The kebabs are simply gorgeous and u just won't feel like merging it's taste with anything else. They come in mutton variants too. Arsalan is a must visit in Kolkata.

One of the landmarks of Kolkata. Situated at the hustling and bustling crossing of park circus...Arsalan hase been dishing out yummy biyanis for years... i particularly am fond of their mutton biryani served with mutton chaamp. Over the years the only issue is now the cooking medium as they still cook in old traditional fats...

I know its already renowned and I personally liked the quality of their food and this being the reason I ordered some food for parcel on call while returning home.They took my order in my name and acknowledged as they started preparing it which i supposed to pick after 30mins.I reached there,the Arsalan beside the Haji Saheb/park circus petrol pump,after parking my cab I was waiting there saying name as the manager confirmed me parcel is yet to come.And after my repetitive request he asked one of the waiters and suddenly he replied they were not preparing it and they din't record the order. So,almost after 10 minutes of waiting if somebody tells you that they havn't noted down your order although they confirmed you on call & even at your presence in the restaurant that order is getting prepared, how do you feel like?? I still din't understand whats the cause of this kind of act by a famous eatery.

Hands down, they have the best rolls in Kolkata. You can get me any kind of roll from any place in Kolkata but Arsalan‚Äôs would still be the best for me. I crave for those rolls here because Delhi doesn‚Äôt offer anything like that. You cannot get that taste here at that superbly pocket-friendly price. 

The place offers North Indian and Mughlai cuisines and it‚Äôs known for biryani and tandoor. Zomato shows price for two as Rs. 700 but it has been cheaper for me and fulfilling too. 

My favourite/most eaten item from their menu is the chicken roll. They make the rolls at the front counter so you can see how they go about the whole thing. I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs possible but the cooks keep changing from time to time and the taste of these rolls remain the same. There‚Äôs definitely some sorcery behind the making of these rolls. The paratha is always crispy and delicious. The chicken, the julienned onions and sauces do the rest of the magic. I‚Äôve had this roll for breakfast, for lunch and also for dinner. Over the span of 3 years, I have absolutely no count of how many of these I have gobbled down. And all this for just Rs. 45. They say Kolkata has good and cheap food? They‚Äôre right! If you‚Äôre a bit hungrier, just order the double chicken roll (Rs. 65) and I can bet you‚Äôd have not seen so much chicken in a roll before. It‚Äôs very filling. Stuff like that just makes your smile broader. Get an egg chicken roll and you‚Äôll probably get wings (not chicken wings!). The paneer roll is also good but obviously I prefer chicken. I‚Äôve had rolls from a lot of places in Kolkata, a lot of famous places, but Arsalan stands unmatched.¬†
Obviously, Arsalan doesn‚Äôt just offer rolls. That‚Äôs like their cheapest flagship product. Get deeper into their menu and you‚Äôll see other mouth-watering delicacies.

Their kebabs are finger lickin‚Äô good. I‚Äôll recommend all of them because I‚Äôve had most of them and I‚Äôve never been disappointed. Kebabs are love. Their chicken malai kebab is succulent and creamy (I‚Äôve always been fond of chicken malai kebabs but theirs is simply impressive). The best on their list is the chicken tengri kebab. You can never go wrong with this choice. It‚Äôs spicy, a great, balanced combination of all the flavours and they give you a good quantity even if it‚Äôs just 2 pieces. They are some big, juicy chicken legs; sexy af. All the kebabs are cooked in a tandoor.

There is one kebab whose name I haven‚Äôt seen on the menu ever but have eaten at the Park Street outlet. It‚Äôs called Arsalan special kebab. It‚Äôs basically pieces of meat marinated in spices, grilled on skewers and has a thick layer of cheese on it. Almost like seekh kebab but bigger and better. It‚Äôs even better than the tengri kebab. The cheese does all the magic. It is a must have. All kebabs are served with onion juliennes, lemon and green chutney, which is also A plus; it‚Äôs mixed with curd and, hence, is not that spicy which is perfect for me. 

Arsalan is famous for its biryani. Well, Kolkata is famous for biryani. I‚Äôve had chicken biryani from Arsalan, that too only once because I‚Äôm not very fond of biryani. Personally, I believe biryani is bit overhyped (a lot of bad words coming my way?). Yes, it‚Äôs convenient to eat but I prefer rice and chicken curry. Some people just serve bland and tasteless biryani and beam with pride over other people‚Äôs fake compliments. I keep mum. I‚Äôd rather stay shut than do false praising. Arsalan‚Äôs biryani was, thus, okay for me (get a cold drink with it though). I think, people in my family make more flavoursome biryani. 

¬†The mutton pasinda (shredded mutton in gravy) is good. It‚Äôs one of my uncle‚Äôs favourite. He orders it every time. My favourite gravy items are chicken boneless masala and kadhai murgh. These paired with their butter naan is just the best lunch you can have. Truly. The boneless masala has a hot gravy and they use kebabs for the chicken pieces which I think makes all the difference. You get a chicken gravy item plus kebabs with great texture. The kadhai murgh has North Indian flavours and is loaded with veggies. When everyone else is eating biryani, this is what you should order (I did that :P). Also, chicken butter masala is good. Chicken bharta (shredded) has a lot of oil floating on top but if you can put that aside it is a good choice for those who don‚Äôt like spicy food much (appropriate for kids I suppose). Chicken Kashmiri was a bit sweet (I need emojis here). To be honest, I‚Äôm checking out their menu simultaneously and all of the chicken in gravy items are good: chicken reshmi butter masala, chicken tengri, murgh makhani and I‚Äôve mentioned so many already. Just order whatever and it‚Äôll be good, even the vegetarian dishes (except for paneer kofta; it was weird and sweet). Wasn‚Äôt all this so mouth-watering? I‚Äôm hungry (chicken masala and butter naan <3). I have to go to Kolkata soon.

I think they have a slight inclination towards adding some sweet flavour in some of the dishes. Slight. It‚Äôs probably a Mughlai cuisine thing but I did not know it back then. Like, for example, I was trying to experiment once and, so, I ordered the Arsalan special naan. It costed 80 bucks and, ergo, I had high expectations. I had ordered some gravy dish too to go along with it. Much to my horror, it was sweet. I had thought that it would be loaded with spices, butter/cheese or contain chicken keema maybe. I definitely did not expect the special naan to be sweet. That was just one weird experience.

Biriyani lover do visit Der, but please don't compare with hyderabadi biriyani. Kolkata biriyani got a blend and touch of Lucknowi biriyani and both are completely different,  I tried both but personally I prefer Lucknowi biriyani we're u can get flavourful aromatic fragrance of all herbs its not spicy.

Ambience: The restro is decorated nicely with blue lights which a give calm and peaceful feeling.. perfect place to have a long talk with ur buddies.. 
Food: we ordered chicken biryani, chicken reshmi kabab and chicken reshmi butter masala.. all dishes were too good.. And, Arsalan biryani is one of the best in kolkata.. 
Service: We had to wait for about 20 mins.. service is good and staffs are friendly.. 
So, you can obviously try this one without any doubt üòä

Last minute Biryani Plans?

We were seated almost outside the restaurant but the food made up for everything else. We ordered the arsalan special and the dish was a bit too cheesy. The cheese was a bit too heavy. But we still enjoyed it. 
Next up was the biryani that we were waiting for. It did not disappoint and I must say that the biryani was really well made. Perfect balance of the spices and the rice. The biryani was really good. 
Although the place was a bit more expensive than we thought it would be, but our stomach liked the biryani very much. 
Once a while its good to eat here. Definitely a must go biryani place.

Honestly speaking, I'm never disappointed when I step into Arsalan. 
Ambience: Calm ambience. Perfect ambience to sot with a plate of biriyani and have a long talk with your old school friend or colleagues. Will give you a kind of old world feel. 
Food: This place always fulfills my cravings for biriyani in a promising manner. 
We ordered 
‚Ä¢Chicken Reshmi kabab- Delicious. Served with butter dripping from it. Heavenly. 
‚Ä¢Nun - Well and good.
‚Ä¢Chocken in Arshalan Special Masala - Okay. I need to talk about this. I was never so satisfied with any dish that contains Chicken and Veggies together. It was simply finger licking good. Not only chicken but the veggies also tasted delicious. A must try dish here. 
‚Ä¢Chicken Biriyani - Arshalan and no Biriyani is simply not possible for me.
Disappointment-Chicken in Biriyani was a bit bland in taste and lacked flavor. 
‚Ä¢Chicken Chaap- Though tasted good but chicken was a bit tough. But much better than that of Biriyani. 
Overall, had a descent lunch there.

It seems to have become Calcuttas top few Biryani's, it's good. But didn't change my life the way it seems to for most people.
But still go there, try out the pasanda kababs and the biryani, because i cant tell you you shouldn't. It's a must visit. Wether to simple cross it off your list or to enjoy a good biryani and mughlai spread.

ARSALAN PARK CIRCUS - SERVICE IS BAAADDD !!!
Yesterday we had ordered 12plates chicken Biryani packed for an office Lunch. At time of taking the order ¬†Arsalar Park Circus they said they would deliver dry biryani (less oily/no taal), as this was my repeated request. I has called their number by accident, thinking it was Circus Avenue Arsalan. On receiving the order all 12 biryanis were full of oil, extremely salty and they gave all the burnt portions as well as the taste was NOT OF ARSALAN STANDARD. Rice, meat and aloos were burnt black - and I guess they did not care as this was a home delivery order. Also, it could not be returned and most was wasted as no one ate the oily food. We had to rush and get sandwiches, fruits and sweet curd to compensate and fill everyone. This was most embarassing as outside guests were present. ARSALAN DO NOT CARE ON THE QUALITY THEY SERVE/PACK WHEN THEY DO HOME DELIVERY - THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME. I WOULD CAUTION NOT BELIEVE THEM WHEN PLACING ORDERS.¬†
ARSALAN CIRCUS AVENUE IS MUCH MORE PROFESSIONAL AND RELIABLE AND VALUE THEIR CUSTOMERS' REQUEST.

Now in Kolkata, arsalan is a big brand in restaurant business. At park circus outlet one has to wait behind a very long queue to get their turn. Food is good here but place is so crampy that on hardly can enjoy food. Even the the waiters are in a great hurry while serving you. Some one is paying 190/- for a regular mutton biryani and she has every right to enjoy it comfortably taking her own time. This is not a restaurant. It seems that it is a langarkhana where they serve food for free. They do not respect the customers feeling. Seating arrangement and interior is awful. Very highly priced considering its overall experience. Service is noncordial, detached. People here are only bothered about getting new customers in. Food is tasty and that's why they can do it. Monopolising the Mughlai food market in a way. Don't like to be there at all.

Arsalan serves THE BEST biriyani in the city. It's that taste of biriyani which you will always crave for once you have it. I had a group of friends and we never miss to visit arsalan in a month and never get bored of it as well.
We have had chicken biriyani, Mutton meatball biriyani, reshmi butter chicken, kababs and nawabi paneer pasinda because there was a vegeterian in the group. All the dishes were too good but I must say that the paneer dish stole the show. One must try that once.
And the main dish that I drool over here is firni. Its the best I have ever had anywhere.

Ok. So Arsalan people stole my birthday cake. 
Waiters were awful, we had to literally get up and serve our own food while they stood there and watched. There were never enough spoons or plates on the table and each one of us had to ask them individually,to give us plates. It was my birthday so we cut a cake and asked them to serve it to us. To my shock there were 11 of us. They gave us only five slice of cake and took away the rest. Ridiculous. I don't know what to say. Food was not what I expect from Arsalan and ambience was close to a fish market.

It was quit  late at night when me and my friends decided to give in to our meat cravings.
Four of us had a tandoori chicken, 2 malai kebabs and one Achaari chicken.

Now, like every Kolkatan I have dined at multiple branches of Arsalan before and liked it. It was the same for this as well.

The Tandoori chicken and Malai kebabs were top notch. No complaints whatsoever. However, the same cannot be said about the Achaari kebabs. They were not spicy enough and were dry. Maybe because it was late at night and they might have been running out of the ingredients, the Achaari chicken kind of spoilt what could have been a perfect ARSALAN Dining experience.

Let's s hope that they serve a better Achaari chicken the next time I visit.

Umm about the problems once in every hundred times i get a hard piece of meat in the biriyani and thats all. over all amazing place to have delicious biriyani!!!

Located just a few metres away from the Arsalan at the Park Circus Point. There's not really much to say about one of the finest Mughlai dining places of Calcutta. The biriyani(mutton) and chap(chicken) was  just what one requires on a sunny afternoon after a long walk. The meat was tender and well prepared. Loved it.

Located at the 7point crossing of park circus, this restaurant is so easy to find.
Ambience and decor is what the management should work on.. 
As far as the food is concerned, biriyani and kebabs within your budget is something for which you should opt for this place.. mutton is well cooked and soft, and the kebabs are soft as well.
overall, a light mughlai restaurant within your budget.

I prefer this outlet over the one at 7-point Crossing.

To me Arsalan can do no wrong.I've had amazing experiences at all the outlets of Arsalan,even the lowest-rated one at Chinar Park.Also,biryani is my dessert-island dish, so even the worst renditions have a way with me.

I got a takeaway of mutton biryani from this place today.

Hits-
‚àöFragnant,long-grained rice
‚àöMelt-in-the-mouth piece of well-cooked meat
‚àöAmazing quantity
‚àöSoft, fluffy piece of potato
‚àöNon-greasy

Misses-
√óThe potato was very salty
√óThe piece of meat was quite small

They don't levy any taxes on takeaways which SHOULD be the norm.The staff is competent.

Overall,another great tryst with my favourite biryani brand in the city.

This is one of the oldest and the most famous biryani restraunt in the city..
For sure they have the best biryani to serve..
Bt the service in the non a.c court is one of the worst you'll ever come through..
The service upstairs on the a.c court is good..
Except from the biryani people should also try the arsalan special cheese kbabs those are really yumm..
Have tried the kbabs many a times..
Last time i was served with cold kbabs, Which was replaced after complaining..
As said they may have the best biryani Nd kbabs..
But other dishes doo need a lot of work or new chefs to cook cz the kormas, chanps all were floating in oil, and didn't taste as expected..
Though i am visiting here from childhood, m attached to this place bcz of biryani but it really needs improvement..

Am a frequent visitor to this place. Almost everything they serve tastes the same as the likes of other arsalan outlets (obviously), rahmania, aminia, shiraj. It's as if the same chefs cook in all of these places. Its a ok sort of place if you wish to go light on your pocket and have the taste of biriyani with local flavour.

One suggestion: Atleast train your chef or packing boy to cut Naan in peices before packing and Naan is always packed in silver foil not in a paper enevelope.

The Bengalis and Kolkataians in particular, delights themselves even with the term Biryani. Although, I myself am a 'Biryani Boy', I have no such fascination owing to a reason that it is prepared on a regular basis at my household. However, I am bound to have biryani in a restaurant just because my friends are universally biryani freak.

When it comes to having this "Spicy Rice with Meat", Arsalan was the the ultimate choice among many, which with passage of time has gradually declined. However, my encounter with this restaurant was okaish. On more than couple of occasion, during the past few years, I have been to Arsalan and tried just Biryani with occasional sides in the name of Soft Drinks, Firni and Salad. I have had tasted in both the outlets of Park Circus, but, I tend to prefer Circus Avenue over 7 Point, may be because of the less crowd in the former one over latter.

Although this outlet is smaller one, I have had experienced less people approaching it, most probably because of the locational difficulties. However, the taste of food in both these outlets seems identical and it denotes that the food is cooked in one kitchen itself. The staff are okay behaved but the services are slow, comparatively.

Irrespective of the outlets visited, I have seen a gradual decrease in taste of Arsalan over the years which has considerably reduced my visits to the place. But, I can successfully conclude that it still serves tastier and quality biryani than many outlets in the city.

My biggest weakness is Lucknow nababi cuisine and Moghulai food.

Arsalan is one choice which has evolved over the last decade defacing competitors Aminia,Shabir,Rahmania,Biryani Hut to name a few.

My biggest problem with these eateries are that they all have evolved into GenX eateries with great facilities but their kitchens are yet to.

It is equally important that  cooks, stewards and cleaning sections evolved to the requirements of food safety and cleanliness in today's perspective when human life is threatned with unknown virus 
and bacteria attacks.

While eating in many of Arsalan joints I have found the utensils clean but to my doubt not fully santised.

The hygiene class of the kitchen and their cooks,are two most important and basic factors which I shall take into considerations while taking out friends and family out to an eatery.

 Cleanliness and sanitisation of plates,forks and spoons are equally important while considering a good palate.

Arsalan's special Mutton kababs and biryani are one of the best and I prefer take aways over sitting and eating.The place is too crowded and the quick serving and eating bothers me a lot. I always prefer to unwind myself with friends and relatives and relax a bit while eating out.

Management can implement steam based vaccum cleaning systems to help customers enjoy safe and healthy food.

Best biriyani in Kolkata. Don't expect a hyderabadi spicy biriyani. The potato inside the biriyani makes the quantity less :D A crowded place

I like this place a lot, the crowd, the vibrancy and the best biryani makes this an experience everyone should have once atleast. Had chicken biryani and chicken chaap here and both were delicious. This place is almost always crowded and sometimes you have to share seats with other people also. But for the love of biryani this is worth it.

The King of Biriyanis. Rich in flavor, extremely aromatic and super succulent pieces of meat. The ultimate rendition to a Bengali Biriyani. I believe they can increase the portion size a little. Over the years the price has gone up but the quantity has failed to catch up. Even the special biriyani does not offer a huge difference. Not a big fan of their Mutton Rogan Josh. Definitely can be much better.

Biryani and kebab lovers this place for north indian cuisines is the place for you. Right at the seven point crossing, this places ask all from seven different points to come and try the dishes, the smell itself provokes! The hariyali kebeb the special mutton biryani-yum yum!. Do not forget the firni.

Add the cheese chicken kabab my heart skipped a beat !! We did order the pomfret fry it was god cant say it was special...all in all I KNOW WHAT THE BUZZ IS ALL ABOUT!!

Been to Kolkata¬†on a business tour for two weeks and luckily it was Christmas time and there is no better way to enjoy with a mouth watering biryani. As sitting was not available due to crowd so preferred¬†takeaway, Ordered a Biryani and Firni.
Biryani was delicious and had Hyderabadi¬†Biryani before so serving¬†biryani with boiled potato is Kolkata specialty and on a lighter¬†note, people here won't accept biryani without potato.
A perfect blend of spices, light compare to Hyderabad¬†biryani, brilliantly cooked full marks to Biryani.
Now comes Firni, it was good but not so impressed¬†but ya I had made my Christmas¬†tasty.¬†

Most recommended¬†if you are on a short trip to Kolkata.

I went on the day of Saraswati Puja with friends & had to wait for about an hour before a table was made available but everything that followed made the wait worth it. To begin with, it isn't a fancy restaurant but the food & hospitality makes up for it. We ordered Chiken tandoori kabab, mutton arsalan kabab, Mutton special Biryani, mutton dum gosht handi and mutton rogan josh and ate bare hands. The biryani was just perfect. This is perhaps one of the best Biryanis I ever had. It was perfectly cooked, juicy, tender & melts in your mouth. The Rogan josh had a punchy flavour to it which many restaurants fail to achieve. The aroma was natural and there weren't any hint of artificial added flavours. I have tasted the Official Hyderabadi Biryani of the Paradise Hotel and to be honest I don't get what the fuss is all about, Arsalan is just as good as they are if not better. The restaurants has a spacious front, so you don't have to worry about parking space. But I'd recommend not to visit during any Festival, it gets really crowded and noisy and food as good as this deserves to be eaten in peace. Will be back soon.

Went to this outlet of Arsalan after seeing a huge waiting list at the 7-point crossing outlet.
I've always heard good reviews about this outlet (just beside the rivalry mughlai restaurant 'Haji Saheb') but my expectations were more. I ordered a mutton biriyani. It came very fast. Just within a minute. But I felt the quantity was not upto the mark as per the price (Rs.210 without tax). But taste wise there is simply no comparison.

What more can be said about this brand of Biryani? Arsalan has actually bulldozed into Kolkata‚Äôs culinary scene and captured the heart and mind of every biryani lovers except it‚Äôs competitors. Who would not like to caress the soft strands of flavourful aromatic rice, succulent chicken and the ubiquitous potato, very characteristic of Kolkata biryani ‚Ä¶.

In a world of Lucknawi and the Hyderabadi, Kolkata biryani has a place of its own but sadly it has not been able to carve the same niche like the former two. India is the melting pot of cultures and biryani is a dish associated with so many states and regions. But we are aware about just the two of them.
                                                                ...

This one is not situated in park circus 7 point connection. But from there you can take the direction and have a good time. The main Arsalan which is situated in park circus is very crowded all the time. But this one is not over crowded. So the ambiance of this one is very good. And come to the main point, the food, they serve the same food as main restro. So that's very good to taste. And actually you can enjoy the food here more then park circus one because of the present ambiance. Nothing to say about biriyani. Always my favourite. Awesome. Outstanding. The legend.

Arsalan is another iconic place I had heard so much about. Being a non-resident Bengali, never had the opportunity to try this place; and being a die-hard biriyani lover, always had a wish to go here someday.

Visited this place for dinner on 25th December evening. Waiting time was reasonable, and we were ushered to the first floor once table was available.

The seat we were offered had an AC unit overhead, and it was leaking. And not drop by drop but some heavy constant leakage. We asked for a different seat, and the waiter told us pretty rudely that this is the only place left and either we had to take it or leave it. After some argument, the manager intervened and assigned a different table reluctantly. -0.5 for such rude and unprofessional behaviour.

We ordered mutton tikka and mutton biriyani. Tikka was kind of burnt, and the mutton was really really hard. The biriyani was good, but I did not find anything to justify the "iconic" tag. I had had same standard of Kolkata-style biriyani in Mumbai, Hyderabad and Bangalore too. -1 for not-so-good food.

Service was very slow and pathetic. We ordered one cold drink at the time of ordering and it came after we had almost finished the meal, and after multiple reminders. -1 for the service too.

Oberall, IMHO, neither I could find anything that justifies the "iconic" tag, nor I would be too willing to go back there.

What's the big deal? Nothing spectacularly special about the place. The biryani rice was the only good bit. Service was disinterested, the mutton was rubbery, the kebabs came in cold. You want good biryani, there's a billion places, non-heritage, but really good out there.

500 stars for the Biryani. No, 50,000 stars because nothing else matters because nothing else should matter and because I don't care about your opinion. Biryani is heaven served on this God forsaken planet, I am not bothered about what illegal stuff they mix (heard somewhere) because Biryani is all about Aloo & Aesthetics. Stay in Central, Western, Southern India and you will understand the value of Aloo in Biryani if you are from Calcutta/Bengal. This is majestic, the only real reason I am alive and I have a reason to wake up. Salute to Arsalan. Kings of Biryani!

I heard about this place on the high way on my plate show and have been looking forward to trying this place ever since we planned a trip to Kolkata!

We go in the mutton and chicken biryani and some for I

The biryani was nice and mildly spiced and not too oily which was nice. Only recommendation would be for them to cut down a little bit on whatever they put that gives the biryani and "airfreshner-esque" after taste.

On the whole I'd say it's very different from the hydrbadi dumb biryani style I'm used to and like but it's good for a change. However It has  not been able to convert me from hydrbadi dhum to Kolkatta style biryani

The firni was also not bad but again too heavy on the kesar and air freshmen taste for my liking but on the positive side I'd say it was not too sweet.

On the whole I'd say it's good but not the best iv had. Glad iv tried it but I, personally, wouldn't go back

Ordered biryani from here through Zomato. Delivery was awfully delayed and to top it, there is no raita or saalan with the biryani. For first time customers, not knowing this might end up ruining the whole biryani eating experience. First time I've ordered biryani anywhere and not got raita with it. Biryani is good though.

Arsalan is rightly Kolkata's Biryani monopoly. And you don't need to give an introduction to justify that. One mouthful of that flavourful rice, you'll be swooning over its awesomeness. 

The service is a little bit delayed, I feel. Makes it difficult to wait with all the aroma making you hungrier. :P Ignore that, you're set for one amazing hog-athon.

Many of my Bengali friends vehemently argued with me when I told them that golgappe in my hometown of Lucknow are far better than puchkas in Kolkata. A good news for them - Arsalan, in my view, compares with the best food in Lucknow.

We had the rezala, a flawless 'white qorma', the chaap, similar to Lucknowi boti kababs (and chops as I had assumed it to be), perfectly spiced and melt in mouth mutton, biriyanis that was fragrant but not spicy, shaahi tukda where you had to search for the bread under the rabdi....don't go near the bathroom scale for a week, and friends will keep asking you why you are smiling!

Few things in the biryani world compare to the Arsalan Special Mutton Biryani. The quintessential Calcutta biryani with fragrant rice, two huge pieces of succulent meat, a massive potato and an egg....this remains in my list of toppers ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ My son thinks only mutton biryani is worth his while and chicken is passe, so mutton it has to be!

And super quick delivery when you order through Zomato!

Craving for chicken bharta got us here. 
Difficult for parking, but can be  otherwise easily  located. Coming to food, had tandoori roti, chicken bharta and tootie frootie. 
The chicken bharta, was no doubt with robust of flavours, but it was extremely oily. It seemed the oil is the gravy and the chicken is the island floating in it. 
Coming to the  desert,  shahi tukra was unavailable so had to go for tootie frooti, which was balanced with loads of citrus fruits and ice cream.

We stayed at Astor and thus, a lunch at Arsalan was always on the cards. We ended up there one late afternoon, hungry and impatient. We quickly ordered the famed biryani along with a signature dish, until the man taking our order, a seasoned gentleman said "try the mutton stew, my recommendation. Tell me later how it compared to what you ordered earlier." We agreed. We ended up ordering the stew 4 more times, with roomali roti.None of us six people who went to Arsalan that day will ever forget the experience.

Ever heard of chota packet, bada dhamaka! This place truly depicts this saying. I had heard a lot about arsalan's food from my friends and also read about it on zomato. When you see it from outside, it looks like some regular small restaurant but when it comes to food, it is mind boggling.

Me and my friends went for lunch. We ordered one mutton biryani, two special chicken biryani, one chicken chap, one kadhai chicken and one assorted kebab platter.

The biryanis were delicious. In Kolkata, biryanis have both meat and potato. This was something I had never heard of. The quantity was more than sufficient and the taste was superb. I Loved it.

The kadhai chicken was dead spicy and made the biryani taste better. The gravy was so tasty that we requested for extra gravy. I didn't like the chap much. It was too oily and was kind of bland in front of other dishes.

The assorted kebab platter had chicken, fish and lamb kebabs. The chicken and fish kebabs were amazing. I didn't like the lamb kebabs much.

Overall, a very reasonable place with a lot of offering. A must try for all the biryani lovers.

Best biriyani restaurant in Kolkata ( both chicken and mutton ). Their kebabs are delectable too. I love their mutton pasinda , which is bit oily but delectable.
Ambience is good and service is good too.
It's quiet economical as per the brand name but biriyani 's quantity is bit less. A must visit for mughlai dish lovers.

one of the most flashy places for biriyani in Kolkata¬†

the taste the aroma the looks all add up to a treat¬†to remember¬†

but ¬†if you are looking for a good ambience then it's really disappointing¬†

because they offer a very common seating place¬†not so different from a normal restaurant but the food fills up the gap here¬†

and the prices are still within the reach of common people¬†
so worth a visit

Arsalan has been my favourite biriyani outlet in city of joy for a long time.The long grained rice with rich aroma and flavour,big aloo,soft mutton piece,so tender that the meat falls off the bone..it lives upto the reputation of being one of the most popular restaurant serving Kolkata style biriyani.I also love their kababs(tried the tikka,reshmi ones in both mutton and chicken variant).I like to team up their butter naans,masala kulcha with mutton pasinda,mutton chanp some times.

Food is undoubtedly good. All the mughlai items and breads are just awesome. Their Biryani is one of the most famous now a days but I visit this outlet when Shiraz used to be famous for Biryani and Arsalan was my fav for Rezala and naan. They fail a bit on the service part since the pressure of huge order is always there.

Anyway, a must visit place for Kolkata food lovers.

I personally prefer this outlet of Arsalan over the one in the seven point - even though it is the closest Arsalan to my place - mainly because of the better and professional behaviour of the staffs. Moreover it is entirely air conditioned.

Needless to say, I swear by Arsalan's Biryani.
But today we ordered online a Half Tandoori Kebab (2pcs) and Tangdi Butter Masala (2 pcs) with Butter Nan.
Tandoori Kebabs were juicy and tasty as always.
The Tangdi Butter Masala was good too. Butter Nan had lost all it's essence by the time it arrived as it had soaked up all the butter already. Also, lost the little crunch it normally has and become moist from soaking up the trapped steam.

Arsalan has been one of the best places in kolkata to hv the Biryani and other authentic non veg dishes.. Despite lots of other places promoting high n wide, these guts at Arsalan have stuck to basics n keep on churning the best biryani on offer.
The Arsalan special kababs are the other unique feature here which is not to be missed. They just melt in the mouth n leave u with a taste if soft chicken n cheese which slowly fades away.. Tried the other popular curry dishes of chicken n mutton too but nothing to beat the biryani n kebabs.
The firmi at the end for deserts is also good n not to be missed.
The seating etc is still below par n needs improvement.. Cleanliness also needs to be improved but with the killer taste of food, who's bothered abt how the seating is. Service is good n overall a very goid value for money.
Keep up the good work...

Arsalan is a restaurant tat every Biriyani lover in Kolkata knows of. It's one of the legends in Biriyani. The taste of Biriyani does justice to the high name it has in d market. Slightly costly. Staff behaviour is moderate as they are always in a hurry to talk to you. Their rolls are also very good and must taste atleast once. If U are in a big group U can book the table in d another branch near the Park Circus Flyover.

Arsalan to our group, has become synonymous with biryani. No one says biriyani khaane chalega anymore, all we say is arsalan chal. 

Speaking truthfully, if you're the kind of person, who needs a good ambience, courteous staff, quiet atmosphere then maybe arsalan is not for you, but if you want good food with fast service, arsalan is your place to be. The biriyani is perfect (at the risk of everything, my favourite) and the kebabs are amazing too, if you feel like you have some extra room in your stomach, order the arsalan special kebab, and you will not regret it. All in all, arsalan food is amazing and I honestly can eat it whenever you give it to me! :D

Biriyani was not at all good... I have had better biriyani in the recent past! Butter masala was okay but the chicken resala, again a doom.

This restaurant was recommended by our Hotel staff and was the first place I visited here in Kolkata. Upon arrival the hosts were very friendly and the service was really quick..
The food was really tasty and the portions are huge. There food is very innovative - still Indian but with some dishes I have never seen before. 

 -0.5 as the wash room was not clean. 

One tip; it is recommended to bring a scarf or a jacket - it is quite cold inside. 

Enjoy!

I knew that this is the main branch of Arsalan. After having a more or less good experience at the Bangur outlet, I expected this place to be better. And it turned out to be the exact opposite. We were taken to the first floor. The staircase was so narrow that only one person could fit in. The room available for dine-in is quite small. That's why there was a big crowd for take-aways as people don't want to sit and dine here. The staffs were too slow. They lacked minimum courtesy. Didn't take the order properly. One of them pointed to another waiter and he pointed to somebody else. The tables were too small. We couldn't keep our legs properly. The four plates placed on the table took all the space. We had Chicken Biryani and Chicken Reshmi Kabab. The biryani was good. The kababs were excellent. Hence we ordered another plate of it and we were again made to wait for another half an hour. They didn't even bother to refill our glasses. The food was good. But the service, worst!

Most of our Park Circus ventures take place after office.

After a very busy birthday of my partner, we dropped by Arsalan to pack dinner for home.

Tried their chicken roll and kathi kebab. 

I'm usually not a fan of chicken rolls with tomato sauce in them, I prefer it with lemon juice rather.However, I quite liked the way this particular roll was prepared with the tomato sauce. It was juicy, succulent and everything nice.

The kathi kebabs, too, were pretty appetising and good in qty as per the price paid.

Also ordered Hariyali kebab butter masala, mutton tikiya and parathas for takeway. Delectable! 

Happy souls, us. :)

This is our preferred outlet of Arsalan whenever we go out with family & friends . For the first time today we visited their first floor sitting area. Parking has become a problem in this outlet though they have valet parking. Ambience of the first floor is quite good with white comfortable sofas instead of chairs on the ground floor & the AJC Bose Road Flyover presenting a nice view. Coming to the food we ordered the following : 
1) Mutton Biryani : I am a fan of Arsalan's Biryani but today I was a bit disappointed . The Biryani  somehow lacked in quality & the piece of mutton was much smaller .
2) Tandori Roti : Usual type , no complaints in this regard . 
3) Roomali Roti : A bit heavier than normal , taste wise ok type .
4) Mutton Chap : Best of the lot , nicely cooked & tasted heavenly .
5) Mutton Kassa : Well cooked & tasty but the quantity of mutton should be increased .
6) Mutton Bhuna : 3 pieces of well cooked mutton , nice combination with tandoori roti . 
                The service was prompt & behaviour of the staffs was cordial .
                 We also parcelled Mutton & Chicken Biryani for home & there is a difference of price between takeaway & in-house menu . 
                  Overall quality time spent with family & friends but had better Biryani on previous occasions .

Been here[ARLSALAN,CIRCUS AVENUE,NEAR AJC BOSE Flyover] on 23.09.2016 sunday lunch time ordered chicken Biriyani,Mutton Stew,Chicken Reshmi Kebab.
Billed around 1000Rs but Biriyani quality was worse than roadside.Chicken ,alu was of merely boiled taste .Rice was not long grain.Height of poor quality biriyani.May be due to huge customer base of students in this area its going on.
Washroom in dirty condition.Reshmi Kebab also of not comparable level to Arlsalan Brand Name.
Complained to the waiter while paying. It is pityful to see a good food brand name getting misutilised.

There is two outlets of Arsalan in park circus area. But this outlet is down graded and way away behind from the another one in terms of food. We ordered mutton biryani and mutton rogan josh. Biryani looks very yellowish (usually their normal biryani looks white and tiny yellowish). Biryani is to much salty in taste and oily too. Mutton piece was hard and chewy (less meat and big bone), not properly boiled. I didn't find the aroma and taste of their famous biryani in my food. Mutton rogan josh is another disappointment for us. It smells and tasted like mutton curry in cumin (jeera) and coriander (dhaniya). Mutton piece wasn't totally boiled. When we told their staffs for to change our foods, they refused. To much disappointed, we can't completed our foods and stomach fully but paid totally. Not expected this type of food by Arsalan. Food quantity and quality is low as compared to the another outlet.

Usually Arsalan is famous for its different cuisines but for this particular outlet I felt a little down graded food quality, hospitality and ambience. Still the taste of Biriyani was better as compared to other cuisines.

Quite late for this review, but never the less, A perfect pit-stop for those who are a huge fan of mughalai food and Bengali Mutton Biryani.
As a biryani lover we walked in the restro at lunch time, the restaurant had good crowd.
We ordered for as usual Motton biryani, Mutton chap & Chicken reshmi kabab,
The food arrived on time, loved the biryani as it was one of the best biryani's i tried, perfect blend of spices & fragrances no flavours overpowering, the protein was the best part the mutton(lamb) is tender and melts in your mouth, perfect portioning, the mutton chap was good, but was quite harsh on spices, chicken kabab was flavorsome, over was a good experience not too heavy on pockets though. Service is ok, the table coasters is quite nice, interiors are rustic & pretty clean.
Food: 4.5/5
Service: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5
¬†
Overall good experience would visit soon.

Visiting this place after almost 5 years. This place in general- is overcrowded and never properly maintained. The Biryani off course is very good and is highly acclaimed restaurant for biryanis. Their kebabs are also worth praising. But I would say the taste of their biryanis have gone down with time, the mutton wasn‚Äôt tender, it had that rubbery taste (May be just one bad day or It was my bad luck!). Other than biryanis and kebabs; most of the gravy items are in general too oily. The ambience is not the best, specially sometimes it feels too unhygienic. But considering the taste of food and pricing it definitely worth visiting this place.

Pros: Classic biryanis, good amount of food, pricing is decent.

Cons: Ambiance is not that great, little oily foods specially on the gravy items, service is poor in the weekends.

Although it's small and always crowded the food more than makes up for it. Located in a convenient place it's very good

Ordered 3 special mutton biryani yesterday and I was shocked when I opened the boxes, the biryani was cold and it was evident that they had given the left over stock of the afternoon and furthermore the rice was floating in the oil oozing out of the boxes. I called up Arsalan and they assured me of replacing all the three portions. I sent it back with my driver and they replaced it, the moment I opened the boxes again it seemed they had just microwaved it and sent it back again. Would not recommend Special biryani to anyone.

Arsalan can be still called one of the best places to have authentic biriyani. The ambiance is moderately nice, they have also opened up another floor which is big and airy. It isn't truly a fine dining experience, but can be visited if one is in kolkata for the first time. I've had chicken hariyali kebab, the biriyani of course and the mutton haleem( available only during Ramzan). Quality of food is good, quantity is also good, but they should pay heed to the cleanliness.

Well what are the different ways you can appreciate this wonderful restuarant. They serve perhaps the best Biryani in town. It is pure bliss.¬† Coming to their kebabs, the Arsalan Cheese kebab is something¬† you cant miss everytime you visit this place. you can also try their haryali kebab tikka kebab and kakori kebab. This place brilliantly maintains their quality of food even during festive times. Their service is satisfactory¬† na ambience is pretty decent.

Review: Arsalan Restaurant, Park Circus

Location - 5/5
At exactly Park Circus 7 point crossing no one will have difficulty finding it, even if they don't have any help from google map. Reachable by surface public transport from any part of Kolkata very easily.

Facilities - 2.5/5
No parking facilities from the hotel, parking nearby is a tad bit difficult, specially in festive times and weekends. You can pack your food and there is a separate counter for that outside, and they don't take too long for that.

Ambiance - 2.5/5
Clearly not for the guys who expect a very nice ambiance, and somehow everything around the place screams "cheap", not to mention the overcrowding of tables. But it is clean and not very uncomfortable in matter of table heights & seating arrangements.

Food - 4/5
For Biriyani and most kababs-rezalas-chaaps kind of foods one of the best places at Kolkata. But, the food type is tilted more towards Mughlai, rather than Hyadrabaadi cooking style, but modified well to suit bengali palate. Food during festive seasons are bit off compared to normal days. Pricing will feel value for money for most items.

Service - 3.5/5
Not very polished, but not crude either. If you don't care much about sophistication, warm courteous service only does well for you, then not a bad place to be. And, naturally when pressure is too high, during weekends and festive seasons, service quality falls a bit.

Overall - 3.5/5
Not a bad place if only thing matters to you is food, and not the total ambiance and all.

Arsalan couldn't keep up it's standard, coping with the pujo rush. I,  with my friends, went there on Ashtami,  the rush was much less than expected. It took us quite a long time to catch someone's attention to wait on us. Quite a great number of dishes weren't available and the food quality was not that good. Overall,  not quite a good experience.

The place was overly crowded and one doesn't feel very pleasent in such an atmosphere...However the interiors remind you of an old Kolkata.. You see a telephone which is from the old times and you feel nice walking in there...

This is the best arsalan in town with its fragrant, flavourful biryanis, juicy, succulent kebabs and spicy, rich gravy based dishes. A relatively new name in the biryani business in kolkata, it has already carved out a niche for itself. The restaurant is not very big, but in my gastronomic experience delightfully great food comes from such small places.

The place is just a normal sitting, which is at most of the times packed, and during proper meal times the place is always in waiting. It‚Äôs a two floor restaurant, with non AC being at the ground and AC (family sitting). We tried the Chicken Arsalan Kebab‚Äôs, and mind you this is the best starter I have ever tasted, chicken pieces filled with cheese, the first few bites are total heavenly, but do try this only if you‚Äôre at least 3 people as it becomes too much otherwise. The next dish to try was the Mutton Biryani as there was too sho-sha abo,
ut it. The Biryani was a nice, it was non oily with small rice, unlike the biryani I am use to. So for me it was ok ok, but others with me just love it. For desserts we tried the Firni, which tasted more like a Rabdi, but nevertheless it was worth for money and taste bud.

The authenticity of a kolkata styled biriyani comes with presence of spiced of boiled potato along side the medium spiced rice and well cooked chicken/mutton pieces which is what the arsalan's have been doing better with the growing years. I also had chicken chanp which had very tender chicken pieces slowly cooked under the flame which resulted into a bright rich golden granulated gravy which will definitely tickle your taste buds. The kebabs that I ordered where crunchy from outside and juicy from inside thus was delicious. The paper laid on the table forced us to end with the fabulous firni which resembled more like rabdi mixed with dry fruits served in earthenware. Overall the ambience was average and we had to wait for a small duration due to heavy rush at this branch which I believe was worth it.

I am very disappointed with the services and food of Arsalan. I often visit here as my office is nearby and order for only Chicken biryani coz, as i get it faster. I visited Arsalan last time 2 months back and we frends ordered for Mineral water and the seal was broken. Today we ordered for chicken biryani and they said there is no chicken biryani available and so we have to order for Mutton biryani. Ok wew did so.. But I was shocked seeing the mutton pieces as there were only big bones. Also they never served us Salad as we ordered that. Later we had to cancel dat. Sorry for writing it here as we need better services and better food. We spending money to eat so it should be perfect.

This place is for crazy biryani lovers. With my experience of staying in other cities, what I have craved the most is biryani. I bet you there is no other city that makes biryani as well as ours. And arsalan can proudly take the ownership of making it the best way. Impossible if you are visiting the city and not trying biryani here. Apart from biryani, their kebab platters are also worth trying (masala tikka, hariyali, tangri, reshmi). Must visit.

Arsalan of course makes the best biryani in town as on date. And the statement its not open to debate.

A late entrant into the biryani scene, it has worked hard to take on the biggies of mughlai food, who are just not popular joints but names that almost¬†¬†define¬†the category.¬†

Recommendations:¬†
While the mutton biryani, fish tikka, dal e hariyali, mutton rezala and Chicken Tandoori Butter Masala are delicious, the unsung hero is a kebab innovation - chicken arsalan kebab - its chicken shammi kebabs, rolled in cheese and oven baked. Its brilliant  and will be a non negotiable item on your order every time you visit the place. A special mention for their variety of vegetarian food which is not very usual in a mughlai eatery. The only place which needs a little more work is the desserts section which just has a very average tasting phirni and shahi tukda.

I had a mutton biryani. The meat was tender, and the taste of biryani was good. Full marks for it, but the restaurant is always a rush. This one at Park Circus is the most sought for in Kolkata.

Arsalan Park circus is best in Kolkata among all other Arsalan restaurants. I ordered multiple times from there. I wl recommend biriyani (mutton as well as chicken) and along with that varieties of kebabs like chicken Rashmi kebab, mutton sikh and boti kebab... All of them are good.. Also if someone is taking biriyani then please make sure after having biriyani ur having firni because that combination is very delicious..I haven't gone there so won't be able to comment on other stuffs like behaviour of waiters, ambience etc. But yes I can surely can good was delivered on time or even sometime before the mentioned time... So based on all these factors I can rate Arsalan as 3.5/5. Thank you.

We ordered Biryani and they weren't concerned about serving it. We asked them to serve. From the plate in which they brought that Biryani, they served some to my friend and they bluntly gave me that same plate in which they have brought Biryani. So bloody pissed off. Over that they insist for tips. That is verry irritating.

Situated right at the park circus 7 point crossing.This place is hugely popular and probably the best Arsalan outlet of Kolkata with respect to the other outlets.Biryani is what Arsalan is famous for the ages and they cannot go wrong with it's taste.

We tried : Mutton Biryani, chicken Briyani, Tangri Kebab, Tandoori chicken.
Both their Biryani and Keabs were equally delicious.Food was excellent and service was very prompt.

This is a perfect place for having lunch or dinner with family and friends.
Strongly recommended to people who haven't yet tried this place........

Friendly service and a lip smacking biryani Avoid the recommended Arsalan kebab as its egg and cheese marinade is strange tasting but meat is wonderfully moist The biryani is fantastic

The one at park circus is much better, this one over charges and you pay more than what you see on the menu (they claim the prices have recently changed). the service is not fast and they charge you for containers although biryani is always served in boxes all over the city for take away
the service is bad and the staff are definitely not courteous. the ambience reeks of pakistan

You can never be disappointed with Arsalan 's  biriyani and this is exactly what we had expected. As expected the biriyani was out of the world. Non greasy and non oily, had the perfect blend of the rich flavours. The second floor of this outlet is done in a simple but elegant manner. The waiters are extremely polite and sweet. We had ordered a chicken jhal farezi and two mutton biriyani. The jhal farezi was tasty and tangy with the perfect taste. The biriyani was extremely light and airy. The food is  pocket friendly and tasty as well. :)

Have been waiting to review this for a really long time..
So here it is...
I'm talking bout the air conditioned cozy outlet near park circus 7 point, not the big one situated at the heart of it.
First , the food of course, undoubtedly it's d best known n most famous biryani outlet in the city of joy in d mid ranging group, n lemme tl u, not for nothing.
The biryani is of Kolkata variety, an offshoot of lucknavi biryani.
It's well cooked, tarr, as the Urdu word fr moist, n never hv I seen such succulent mutton pieces which melt in your mouth, the aloo in biryani is a tricky part, cz most of the biryani places can't get it right,well, not arsalan.
It's magical.
We ordered a side dish of boneless mutton masala, which is very rich n tasty n goes down well wd d biryani.
They hv veg dishes too for all u veg ppl out the, but haven't tried yet, so can't judge.
The staff n management r very polite n helpful.
Overall, I gv it a big thumbs up if Ur in Kolkata n looking for genuine Kolkata biryani without burning a hole in Ur wallet.

We had a special mutton biriyani along with butter nun and chicken reshmi butter masala! The food was heavenly and satisfied our appetizers as well as raised our taste buds!

Have been dying to visit this joint since I heard its better than its big brother (the one at 7 point crossing), and hopefully the place maintain my faith in this legendary food chain! The decor was so-so. The service is decent. But food is the best part. If you want Mughlai food in reasonable rate, you can‚Äôt really go wrong here. What I have realized also is that I like going here on weekdays. The place isn‚Äôt typically full over weekdays at least and their service stays pretty good. I have ¬†heard that when the place is semi-full (especially over the weekends), the service tends to suffer quite a bit. Their kebabs are quite nice. The Mutton Biryani along with mutton rogan josh pretty much satisfied my palette! Had their mutton piece be a little bit tender, it would have been great. And last do taste their firni its definitely their hidden gem!

Arsalan! Because biriyani is love.

 And this place serves one of the best biriyanis in the city.  Location is known to every foodie. But apart from this Park Circus outlet they have few other outlers as well. They have AC and Non AC sections. People often end up in the Non AC section to avoid long line for the AC section.  
Biriyani is heavenly.  Kababs are  mouthwatering.

If I had a dollar for every time some Bengali recommended Arsalan to me, I would have enough money to buy a lot of biryanis from this place. However, that being said, the golden question that arises is would I spend that money on Arsalan? 

Well, I would spend a few of those dollars since its pretty damn good. BUT, it is also a little over-hyped in my opinion.

Kolkata is foodie heaven and since there are so many places which serve biryani which is just as good as this place I think that the hype around arsalan needs to reduce. That being said, Arsalan still serves one of the most balanced biryani‚Äôs I have had. The meat is always tender and just dissipates in the mouth and the rice is very aromatic and full of flavor. I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone and will continue to keep visiting this particular outlet.

If you are an ardent biryani lover and you are in kolkata, this is the place you should definitely not miss..for me, it serves the best biryani in the city..standing in the 7 cross, the place is always crowded for obvious reasons..and the mutton biryani (with the aloo) is worth the wait!! You can also try the chicken reshmi kababs and their chicken chap..but the biryani is the best of the lot..can never get tired of this place!

For when, writing a review for Park Circus Arsalan is just a trivial matter as everybody has got their own notion about it.
Standing tall amidst the 7-point crossing of Park circus, this place literally exudes the flavoursome smell of Mughlai all around. Well the lower portion is mainly non-ac and the 1st floor is AC with dim lights and well furnished decor having the perfect dining ambience.
Tried quite a few different items in each of my visits.
‚Ä¢ Chicken Biryani : A plate full of long grained basmati biryani with a humongous piece of chicken and potato. I don't prefer awadhi biryani much as because they don't serve ALU with it, being a Bengali it's tough to gulp biryani without ALU. Without going into superfluous description about this dish I can put it as the "BEST BIRYANI IN KOLKATA".
‚Ä¢ Chicken Tengri Kebab : this meat kabab is my personal favourite, chicken leg pieces well marinated with spices and well roasted and then assorted with salads and a super tasty Dhaniya-curd chutney.
‚Ä¢ Mutton Boti Kebab : moderate pieces of mutton roasted in a stick with veggies and served in a platter with pudina-curd chutney.
‚Ä¢ Chicken Chap : another favourite of all time, as well a arsalan speciality.
‚Ä¢ Shahi Tukhra : An extravagant sweet dish made up in form of bread pudding with kesar n dry fruits kheer can blast someone's taste buds.
.
Here staffs are well-behaved and prompt as well, although the place gets crowded with time and then service gets slow.
.
Pocket pinch is moderate with taxes.

Biriyani especially the Calcutta style biriyani is synonymous with Arsalan. Even though an avid biriyani lover, my encounter with Arsalan was pretty late but quite impactful. The mutton biriyani tasted like heaven. The mutton tender and juicy, the rice filled the mouth with flavour and special mention must be made of the Potato (a Calcutta thing). We also ordered chicken reshmi kebab with the biriyani and the kebab was equally good but again I would say, the biriyani was the show stealer any day. The ambiance is ok, service a bit slow. We waited almost for 20 minutes for our bill, but I am ready to forget it in exchange of another plate of mutton biriyani üòâüòâ

FINALLY, I had their Biryani!! I have been looking to visit the outlet but it never materialised. Ended up ordering on Zomato. 
I had ordered a Mutton Biryani. 

The Biryani was fabulous! Absolutely delicious! I loved every bit of it. The mutton was cooked to perfection! It was tender and falling off the bone. The rice had amazing flavours. 

The price came to just around 210 rupees which I'd happily spend any time for such a wonderful treat! 

I am really impressed by the Biryani here and definitely recommend everyone to try it out (though highly likely that you already have! ;-)) 

Happy Dining!!

There are two restaurants of Arsalan at Park Circus Area. One is at the 7 point crossing while the other is at Beck Bagan. To me,  the second outlet is somewhat better than the first one. Though,  my personal favourite in terms of service is the branch at Park Street.

Why Arsalan?
If you love Biryani and if you want to taste of the greatest biryanis in town, you have to be here.

What to have?
Ofcourse biryani! Beside that,  you can start off with a plate of Malai Kebab and take a side dish like chicken chap or mutton rezala,  though it is not mandatory.
End up with firni or shahi tukda.

Pocket Pinch?
Reasonable and worthy,  as you are paying for one of the best Mughlai foods of the town.

Service?
As I mentioned earlier,  Park Street Branch tops the list. Then comes the Beck Bagan branch which is at a walkable distance from the 7 point crossing branch.
You might have to wait to get a seat at the 7 point crossing branch. I am yet to visit the Ruby branch.
Hati Bagan branch is also good.

Food: For all kolkata biriyani lovers , this is heaven. Biriyani is full of flavor , rice quality is excellent , Mutton is well coocked, if you are unlucky sometime mutton can be medium cooked. Mutton stew goes well with mutton biriyani, its spicy and awesome. Arsalan special kabab is also good.

Service: The only issue with the old park circus outlet is you have to wait to get a table. There is another outlet in park circus which is better (service wise) . Park street outlet is also spacious, best is the new outlet in ruby. 

Ambience: Arsalan is all about food , not ambience. Newer outlets in Ruby has an excellent ambience as well.

Known For : Mutton biriyani, Chiken Biriyani, Kababs, Mutton chap, Chicken Chap, Mutton Stew.

Arsalan, the big name in Kolkata and in list of Biryani experts. Being a Biryani lover, how can I miss that. Me and my friend once went there but returned as it was full. We were planning to dine out and my friend suggested to 'conquer' the place this time. And we successfully did it.

Coming to the review. First, the place. This Park Circus branch is Okay Okay type. No much decorations, small place. We didn't go for the A.C floor, so can't say how it is. This wall of the billing counter is decorated with the awards to Arsalan. Now, the food. We ordered Mutton Biryani, one Special Mutton Biryani and Firni. The quantity of the rice was good. In the Special plate there were two pieces of Mutton and one boiled egg. Now the quality. Well, as much I know, the yellow rice is coloured using Kesar. I was really happy to see Kesar in my plate. But another ingredient used for that Biryani smell, Kewra Jal, that was missing. I mean I missed the Biryani smell. The mutton piece is very disappointing in both the plates. The Firni was good. I liked it. It was not WOW, but it was OKAY....

Arsalan is arsalan. So for biryani if I have to choose any outlet...this arsalan joint always come to my mind. This is so because tables are always available here. I have had a good experience always in this particular outlet. However last Sunday that I went with family....the food quality was poor. The biryani lacked flavour and essence. We ordered for egg biryani for the eggetarians but were served mutton biryani. Even the naan....n north Indian dishes lacked the flavour and essence. I suppose it was the Sunday factor that played a big role.

Been there with my father and sister some time ago. Everyone knows that arsalan is the king of biriyani so we decided to try it out. When we entered the restaurant it was almost vacant. The dining space was a bit small but the seats were well arranged making adequate space for dining
The ambience was decent and the staff attended us well. Nowpving on to the dishes

1. Chicken reshmi kabab - the star of the day. It just outsurpassed our expectations. Tender pieces of chicken shimmered in reshmi gravy
 A hit. The dish was served us hot and quickly. I would give it 4.8.

2. Chicken tikka kabab - not as great as the reshmi kabab. But yet one decent dish. Chicken pieces cooked in spicy Indian gravy. The taste was quite decent. A 4.2.

3. Chicken biriyani - we came here to taste the biriyani and as all say it was heavenly. The chicken pieces were tender and quite big. Not overfilled with spices and oil. Altogether a great dish. A 4.5.

4. Chicken tikka butter masala   - my favourite dish and it was also really great. Tender juicy chicken pieces cooked in spicy tikka gravy with cream and butter. Heavenly isn' t it. I would give it a 4.4.

5. Mutton biriyani - another star dish of the day. Arsalan was frankly the first place where I tasted any mutton preparation and it was worth it. The mutton pieces were greatly cooked and level of spices was balanced
Indeed a great dish. A 4.5

6. Firni - the firni is a dessert one can have in Muslim restaurants. It was really a great dish and it ended our dining greatly. A 4.5.

The bill was reasonable and I would surely revisit this place.

For side dish I would say Chicken Lahori or Mutton Strew with tandoori roti. Trust me they are one of the best sides. You will fall in love.

This outlet is the best outlet of Arsalan. I simply hate mughlai cuisine. But as my mother wanted to taste Arsalan's biryani we went there. We ordered mutton biryani, hyderabadi biryani and Arsalan's special assorted kabab. Quantity was so huge that we couldn't complete our meal. Kababs were excellent especially fish kabab. As I am not a mughlai food lover, may be I am not going to visit it again. But I can assure that there are few restaurants in kolkata which make such delicious mughlai food.

Please dont look for a decor the place is just for a yum yum tum tum full food.

Be it the Mughlai dishes  or the biriyanis or the laccha paratha or gravy siders or Shahi Tukra the taste remains all the same all the time.

Please dont try Chinese, its not worth. And the place is not for chinese. 

If you are a big time fond of briyani no one can serve you better.

Kolkata's go to biryani place.
The ambience is not fancy. The staff is courteous. The food is delicious to say the least. Their lacchha paratha are equally yummy.
Don't make the mistake of ordering Chinese. Although I have no idea why anyone will order Chinese in Arsalan!  üòÉ

I can not think of any other place for Biriyani... I am having their Special Biryani since it was 140-150 rupees a plate... No other place I can ever think of serves such an amount of quality Biryani...

Halim, during the season of Eid is quite good and is a must have for foodies... Firni and Kebabs are worth mentioning... In another outlet of this same restaurant at Park Street, I have tasted their Cheese wrapped mutton kebabs which I always crave for...

Arsalan defines Kolkata Biryani- yes, Kolkata Biryani is a separate recognised type of Biryani... Arsaland cleverly blends Kolkata Biryani's mother flavor from Lucknow and urban, elite Bengali flavors of Kolkata...

Who wouldn't recommend this place???

Went on a busy Sunday Afternoon.. Had to wait around 15 minutes to get a seat upstairs.   Went in to Order Chicken Tengri Kabab, Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Lahori. Chicken Tengri Kabab was nice. Chicken Biriyani was okayish. I did not find it extra-ordinary. But yes! Chicken Lahori was something I wanted to try out after reading Reviews on Zomato and I am not dissapointed. I feel, the staffs need to be a little better, even though, I know, there's a lot of pressure. Service is quick. Would visit again to find out why it is sooooooooooo famous.

It's a very old food joint with great food and history. especially like their mutton Tikka, Biryani, mutton chaap and cheese Kabab. the most important part of Arsalan is the Mini Arsalan beside the A J C Bose Road flyover starting point.. it has the best prawn Biryani which is really excellent and you will not get it everyday . if you are lucky you might get it.

It was most probably the last Ramzaan weeekend when I headed to this restaurant with family. At first glance I had a feeling that Enamiah ( the new restaurant in the city) somewhat tried to copy the decor. Nevertheless, Arsalan stands out for what it is and it's been years that we keep going back to this joint.

We opted for Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Biriyani, Butter nuns, Chicken Reshmi Butter kabaab ( tasty), Chicken Hariyali (don't order) , Chicken masala and firnis. I somewhat felt that they reduced the quantity and have compromised the quality upto certain extent. Don't know if the reason being late Sunday evening or not.

Pocket pinch : 2000

Though we have too many options, there are certain places we love going back. May be for it's taste, may be to buy nostalgia or perhaps it being under comfort zone. Arsalan ain't a mistake to go to!

Enjoy food. :)

Arsalan - the biryani brand of kolkata . This mughlai food chain across the city has won numerous hearts with their biryani . The biryani is well cooked and the chunks of chicken / mutton are tender and soft . Mutton kasturi kababs , tandoori items and firni are other main attractions of this place
Biryani lovers this is the place for you :-)

It is well known for its outstanding biriyani and kebabs. All of these are perfectly done, which leaves even a calorie conscious person asking for more. What else can be added after this? Enough said! Price is reasonable and this is another factor which makes me crave for Arsalan right now while writing this review.

Great Restaurant. Remains packed during the rush hours i.e. afternoon and evening. They also have a fast food counter outside that makes brilliant tasty rolls.
Chicken Tandoori was awesome..The coriander chutney was refreshing.
Menu is very lengthy but thats not a problem. Biriyani, roti, naan, tikka butter masala, reshmi butter masala, and the list can go on. Everything is a speciality here. I don't think they have a dish on the menu which is not good.
Service is fast and restaurant remains crowded with a queue of hungry diners waiting outside. So you won't get much time to spend inside.
But its the taste of the food that sticks to your tongue and makes you want to come back again.

But this is not the way food to be served. It could have been dangerous if someone have it ! we communicated to them and they said their owner is not there and out of country hence I thought to share this to your authorities to take necessary action.

Though it has the same standard of food as its other branches but the stuffs here are not efficient.

One of the premier restaurants of the city when you think of mughlai food, a name synonymous to biryani in Kolkata. I have had and from time to time feel like having it again, it's called the Arsalan Mutton Biryani craving. I remember to have called here and asked if Mutton Biryani were available and when answered No I just disconnected, as nothing else matters. We always have either the Mutton Biryani or the Arsalan Special Mutton Biryani, what changes - the side dishes and the kebabs. I also love the kebabs around in here especially the boti, malai, reshmi, and tandoori kebabs (my mouth waters even when I'm writing this). In gravy dishes I like the chicken bharta, chicken champ, kadhai Mutton - actually they all taste pretty darn good.
If only their delivery quality improves they would get the 5 stars they so deserve.
I have been here numerous times and would definitely visit another countless times more.

Its an all time favourite biryani stop for me. Have been there with friends this time and it unfolded with even better spheres this time. Had ordered Chicken birani, Chicken Hariyali and chicken reshmi butter masala. When they served it, it smelled like heaven. The taste was fabulous too and that too within a reasonable rate.¬†
Just one suggestion which I think would make the place even beautiful is the music. A good collection of music would add to the taste of biryani for sure.

Arsalan for me has become the next door joint for ¬†mughlai food.In fact their products have often been consumed for office parties.I have mixed experience regarding the products .Biryani is what they are known for ¬†& they never disappoint on that note.Quality of basmati they use is brilliant.I even got special feeling for the tangri kebabs here.Very very juicy & tender & the product speaks for itself.Mutton & chicken gravies are above average.I also feel that there hygiene standard can improve since i had a not so good experience once. Their pricing is reasonable & portioning adequate. Bon apetit.

Went there for lunch yesterday... It is a nice cozy place with good interiors well behaved staffs and good food.. The only con is that it is not that spacious..  The gap between the adjacent tables are too less.. Anyway, we went there at around 1pm.. The restaurant was completely empty at the time when we had visited..  Later on few people started pouring in.. Our order comprised of CHICKEN MALAI KEBAB for starters, MUTTON BIRYANI, CHICKEN TIKKA BUTTER MASALA and TANDOORI ROTIS... 

CHICKEN MALAI KEBAB- it was okayish..everything was fine except that it was tad bit sweet...although my foodie partner loved it, I being a non-lover of this kind of  sweetish flavour, didn't fine it that lipsmacking..

MUTTON BIRYANI- biryani is what arsalan is famous for and they cannot go wrong with it's taste so this time was no different..  The biryani was lip-smacking with a big piece of potato and mutton and generous amount of biryani rice for one person.. 

CHICKEN TIKKA BUTTER MASALA- this was lipsmacking.. The kebabs used were fresh and succulent...the gravy was rich and flavourful..this dish went prefectly with the TANDOORI ROTIS... 

After eating all this both of us were too full to eat any dessert..

Service was promt..prices are moderate.. Nice and clean place..so all in all a perfect place for having lunch or dinner with family and foodie friends...
Will definitely visit again..:-)

Went there for lunch today. As usual the place was full, had to wait for sometime before we were seated. We ordered for Tandoori Chicken, Mutton Biriyani and Mutton Chaap with Salad. The food was served quite fast and the staffs were attentive. The biriyani was good though I'd issues with my mutton piece in it. It was too tough to chew. But I didn't complain. But the taste was good and it was light. The tandoori chicken was the best part of our meal. The portion was good and the chicken itself was flavourful. But I'm not a fan of their mutton chaap, usually the mutton pieces are too tough and rubbery. The gravy was good though. But these minor issues somehow made my meal a little unsatisfactory. But anyway, it disappoints less. But the place is pocket-friendly and always busy. So the food served is always fresh and even the portions are decent compared to the price tags.

Want a feel of Kolkata Biriyani? Look no further. Choose a starter . I will recommend the non veg platter. Then proceed to a biriyani, chicken or mutton doesn't matter. They both taste heavenly. For the braver lot I would suggest Lucknow biriyani which is a tad bit more spicy. For side dishes try the mutton stew or the mutton chap. End your meal with their firni. The firni has the perfect balance of sweetness. This place has been home for me for 10years now. I can assure you will have a great time.

And the food is amazingly delicious .¬†

The food which I have tried here is - :
1) Egg biriyani - the egg was boiled and little fried on the sides and added to the delicious & flavorful rice .
2) Egg curry - spicy , tangy and delicious with enough curry .¬†
3) chicken biriyani - only two words Deliciously aromatic .
4) Navratan korma - Best navratan korma i have tasted!! ¬†Nicely fried yet soft veggies , cashews , raisins and fruits and that amazing white gravy :) absolutely delicious¬†
¬†Arsalan is a place which you must visit .
I recommend ¬†- Navratan korma , Egg curry ¬†& chicken biriyani .

Had an opportunity to visit Kolkata, asked my bong friend about the must eat places there and guess where we ended up. You enter Arsalan and you can smell heaven.. err Biriyani. The menu had variety of non veg dishes but the aroma around you doesn't let you order anything but Biriyani. But honestly I found the Biriyani a bit overrated (the spice factor missing), the mutton chap was delicious and the place happening. Overall a good experience.

I have visited this restaurant at least fifty times but never got a chance to post a review, so finally decided to write one. This is based on my experience last week, so it is all fresh.¬†

Lets talk about the food first. If you are a fan of North Indian food, Biriyani, kebabs then Arsalan is a must try for you. ¬†Chiken Tandoori is delicious, juicy and hot. If you are a vegetarian, try Crispy chilli baby corn or chilli potato. They are not famous for Chinese dishes, but you will be amazed to see the quality.¬†

For the main course, after trying several items, this is what I will recommend. Go for Garlic Naan, Biriyani and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. Biriyani is one of the best in Kolkata and you already know that. I have tried many different types of Naan here and that includes Kabuli and Keema naan. But the garlic naan is undoubtedly the best. For the chicken items, Chiken Lahori I have ¬†tried before but I didnt like it that much. Chicken Tikka butter masala contains 6 large pieces of chicken in a very rich, thick gravy. Lovely. If you are fussy about oil content, then this dish is not for you.¬†

Staff are good. However, they are busy. You dont expect extra attention like what you get in some other restaurants.¬†

Ambience is good too. Now they have built a floor at the top, so you can enjoy comfortable sofa. Also, this floor is spacious.¬†

Price - it is cheap. You cant get a better bargain at that quality and quantity.¬†

I recommend.

Not much to be told about the food as it is mentioned in one of my earlier reviews. I believe It is almost time that we use the name "Arsalan's biriyani" as a metaphor. However as usual ended up with the mouth watering Chicken Arsalan Kebab and the lucknowi biriyani but this time in a place which has been designed to be a little more antique. Specially the type of seating, the huge wall clock dangling which just grabs anybody's attention. The staffs were extremely generous and polite and definitely on time to serve the food at the table. As usual at a much loss of words to describe how good the whole experience was.... strongly recommended to people who haven't tried this place still.... though I doubt there is any.

Mughlai cuisine is my all time favourite and so is Arsalaan :D though mostly people talk about their Biriyani which is exceptionally great!! but here I would add few more things for you guys to try must 1. Chicken Lahori and 2. Haleem. Our menu were:
1. Assorted Chicken Kebab Platter - 2 leg pieces, 3 pcs of Chicken Reshmi Kebab, 3 pcs of Chicken tikka and 3 pieces of Chicken Hariyali;
2. Mutton Biriyani;
3. Mutton Rezala;
4. Mutton Kassa;
5. Chicken Lahori- It's a Pakistani delight and I was delighted to experience it- this resembles Punjabi style chicken a lot but the kasoori methi gave it a twist; and¬†
6. Shahi Tukda (My favourite dessert)

I missed Haleem cause we were quite late for it and you'll get it only during Ramadan Month (as far as I remember) so till the holy month of Ramadan you may try your luck to have a taste of Haleem, but you have to reach before 8 pm. I absolutely loved their hospitality and the best part I felt about them is "Unhe apne hunar ka ilm hai" I don't know the payment part as my Jij and Di were taking care of it :D

Biryani being my staple food at home, it had never intrigued me much. Biryani might be a comfort food for many at my household but not mine. But unlike me most of the people living in this city are mad lovers of Biryani, they never seem to get enough of it. For all those people Arsalan is highly recommended because it serves the best biryani in the city undeniably. The food here is not profoundly rich in oil neither it is heavy on the stomach.
Apart from Biryani this eatery serves good Tandoori items if you haven't tired them already.
So if looking for the best biryani is town this is the place offering a wide variety of Biryanis.

I heard this place is rated among the top 3 for biryani in Kolkata so I came with high expectations which were met by high satisfaction. The biryani was indeed absolutely perfect, flavorful and well spices without being too heavy. The chaap is outstanding and the firni 10/10 recommended. I am no expert to judge if it's the best in the city but I sure enjoyed it!

This place doesn't need any review. This place is the king of biryanis and Park Circus area. But only problem is that very limited vegetarian options and place is very smelly of mutton. Jam packed on weekends and more of a favourite with Muslim community.

Regular visitor of this branch..not remembered how many times I have been there..this branch is my personal favorite..coz it  maintains quantity nd quality for each nd every dishes they serves...tasted most of the dishes...last time we went for haleem..by alas..we were late.. nevertheless we tried chese kabab..chicken Biriyani..mutton chap..firni ..
Chese kabab..every time I went for this particular dish I feel heaven..I would suggest everybody should try this item at least once.. chicken Biriyani nd mutton chaap were as usual very good in taste...but Biriyani was little bit oily last time.. nd what a way to finish the meal.firni.. awesome preparation..I m cutting. .0.5 bcoz it was a sunday nd we had to wait 45 minutes..

A Halt For Haleem

Whenever I think of any mughal delicacies, the first name flashes in my mind is Arsalaan. I don't know why I have such an affection towards this restaurant but definitely it never ever disappointed me.

Last Saturday I went to this newer branch of arsalaan, beside the A.J.C Bose road fly over especially for haleem. I think this part of arsalaan is mainly for taking away or delivery because while getting to the table we were asked thrice whether we want delivery or not. The interior is most like the upstairs of the main arsalaan at park circus 7 points. We ordered mutton haleem, rumali roti and green salad. The taste was haleem was too good. Just like what I thought of ! It was neither spicy, nor oily and not at all heavy. The tiny pieces of mutton were soft and submerged in the thick gravy of haleem. One plate of haleem is sufficient for two people. I don't have any complain about the quality but yes, the green salad should more decorated when served. I saw this joint is also have chinese items in the menu. I will be there soon to have a glimpse of that :)

I was one of their everyday customer until they opened an outlet near my place. 

Now, if you are in Kolkata and you never had Arsalan Biryani, we can't be friends. \/

Usually you'll get a seat eventually but on a holiday it's near to impossible to get a seat. Most people prefer take away. 

Must try- Biryani. <3

I don't even know why I'm writing a review for Arsalan because they don't really need one. Everybody who has stayed in Kolkata or has visited, will know that we swear by Arsalan's biriyani. Actually just dive for anything here, their biriyani, mutton chaap, kababs, rolls, firni, mutton tikka, just anything and you'll fall in love - more and more. Again and again.

Definitely the best restaurant in Calcutta for biriyani. As delicious as the biriyani in Awadh, this place has earned so many accolades and they truly deserve them. Parking shouldn't be a problem as they let you park right there at seven point crossing if you find space there. Adds to the swag factor of arsalan. Service is lightning fast, dishes are so damn tasty. If you are ever in kolkata at any point of time and you don't eat at arsalan, it's simply your loss! Thumbs up for this one.

If anybody lives in Kolkata but don't visit arsalan till now please do it asap. Here I have came for several times and every time I have enjoyed the test of foods as same as the first time. They maintain the quality very well specially in Biriyani. Now on the time of ramzan their special mutton halim is extremely delicious please try it specially for this time with lachha paratha or any kind of rooti . In one word Arsalan is awesome with its quality foods and environment.

If it's Biriyani it's none other than Arsalan. Such oil free Biriyani and the taste is amazing. The kebabs are also quite delicious here. My all time favorite from here is their mutton Biriyani, chicken tandoori, butter chicken. The ultimate taste of the Mughlai cuisine. A key area to improve upon will be the Mocktails.

Visited a few weeks back. Me and my girlfriend had planned to have lunch here after buying some books in Dalhousie. But being tired of chicken due to having it for quite a while, we decided to go for the egg biryani - and it was awesome. Extremely light in taste and flavor, low oil content, and the quantity was simply extravagant. We wanted to order Firni, but it was not available. So my girlfriend had a kulfi, which was OK as kulfis go. A good lunch experience.

Their biriyani is delicious. Every time I'm around Arsalan, I make sure I eat my biriyani there.¬†

This is the legendary place for Kolkata-biriyani and no one can deny that! Arsalan itself has set up various branches but this one still remains epic and continues to rule.
We used to get takeaway for Murgh Mussallam and rumali rotis quite regularly apart from chicken/mutton biriyani. Nothing more to say; you HAVE to taste this and keep coming back again and again!

This review was long waiting. Had been to this Arsalan outlet around a month back on a weekend. The place was overcrowded with mismanagement written all over it.
We got to sit on the first floor after waiting outside for 25 mins. The service was too slow and glasses of water were poured in after another 15 mins.
Coming to the food, every dish had one similar trait - cold as ice. From the Biriyani to the Kebabs to the side dishes, everything. The biriyani tasted okay though. However, the kebabs lost their lustre and the chutney was missing. We called for chutney which were delivered almost when we were at the verge of completion of our meal.
My experience of it has made the brand ARSALAN dicey in my mind and from this experience, I always confuse myself as to which experience is the exception - this one or the one which the 7 point crossing outlet provides (not by service but atleast by their standards of food) !

Food is always good. I lost counts on the number of visits. Not only that any occassion at home calls for a home delivery from arsalan. Chicken cheese kabab is my favourite out of all the kebabs.

After some time the site says delivered. But nothing was delivered, I called zomato and informed them of non-delivery. I told them to check the delivery status and let me know. Instead after this, they stopped picking up a phone. This is complete FRAUD. Beware of the Zomato service. You will llose money if you preorder.

I had ordered food from this outlet through zomato online order app.
My order consisted of 2 mutton biryanis, chicken tangri kebab masala, tandoori rotis and 1 lachha paratha. 
Instead of lachha paratha god knows what they had parceled. It was some kinda yellow tandoori roti and there was no tangri in the tangri kebab masala. They had sent huge chicken breast pieces in the dish. 
I complained to zomato about the error and the food got replaced. The food reached us at 11 pm. Couldn't click any photos of the food in the midst of these exchange n all.
Apart from all this nuisance, the food tasted yummy. The biryani was perfect and the tangri kebab butter masala was very well cooked. Tandoori rotis were pretty small but the lachha paratha was not good. It didn't even look like a paratha.
I wanted to give a rating of 2.5 or 3 bt i am a little biased when it comes to Arsalan food. The food tasted too good. So 3.5 for it.

This is my favorite biriyani place. Biriyanis are so good in taste with the mutton being of soft quality and great taste. But only drawback is the mutton pieces they give are very small and hardly any flesh stick to it. Few times I have had this experience. They should improve on this and make sue they give good pieces coz the prise they charge per plate is 175 rs. which not too less really, given its not a fine dining restraunt.

This was my last stop for the tour and im glad i visited this place! The first impression it gives is of a regular iranian cafe on the corner of a street, with a lot of crowd outside! Once you walk in, the AC section is on the upper level and this again is mostly full! Thankfully i could find a staff who was more than happy to help me out in finding a table as well as with my order. My order was for Chicken tangdi kebab, Chicken biryani and Firni.

The kebab was well cooked while biryani piece was soft and the rice was all flavourful! Firni didnt have any extra sweetness and tasted pretty good! Overall, for a pricing as theirs, the food was simply amazing and the service too! A place worth visiting again for sure!!

Ps: Pics do the talking! :)

The best biryani you will get in Kolkata. Have been visiting this branch for a long time. Do try the arsalan special kabab. And the quantity and quality of their biryani is just top notch.

Every time I pass through 7 point I fell hungry for  mutton biriyani. That's Arsalan for me for last 10 years. Nobody can match their class. 
P.S it would be better to have a home delivery as the place is always overcrowded.

The Biryani is undoubtedly wonderful and obviously ranks among the best in town. Its a pinch bit spicy than the standard calcutta Biryani and maybe that's the reason it works.

Arsalan, a household name that always comes in mind due to its finger licking gastronomy. Such is its delicacy that every intricate details of preparing the menu with proper of mix of ingredients and toppings like pepper, spices etc. becomes a special attraction in here. The spicy mouth watering Biriyanis are ready to tease your taste buds with its rich aroma being gracefully served on plate.

For biriyani and mughlai dish lovers , arsalan is a fairly dependable place to eat . For tourists visiting Kolkata , you must try the chicken biriyani . It is soft , naturally flavoured rice with chicken with respectable quality and fair quantity . I have seen this place since 8 years and it offers a lot of other choices . The tandoori butter masala is a strong choice and although a bit on the spicier side . The kababs like the reshmi and the hariyali are brilliant and extremely soft and must have for kabab lovers . Although it started fairly cheap , arsalan is amping up the price of late and losing a bit on the value side . Overall though , it is a fair place and it offers a good variety within 700 rupees for a couple . Hoping for them to introduce buffet !

Have been visiting this place from long time. I find this outlet much cosy n comfortable compared to others. We have always tried normal chicken biriyani but today I tried Hyderabadi chicken biriyani & it was amazing. The chicken piece was succulent, it wasn't too oily but a bit spicy. Overall a good place for Biriyani lovers in the city.

I had heard a lot about this place before I travelled to Kolkata... So I decided to try this out the first day I was at Kolkata... Upon reaching this place, it was not unusual to find the place heavily crowded... After finding a seat, we ordered for mutton biryani, mixed raita and phirni... Mutton biryani was good and mutton was too soft and succulent... The biryani was high on taste and flavors... Understand the craze behind this place...best place for Calcutta style biryani... Phirni was good...but I have had better phirni... Overall a great place for biryani... Highly recommended for someone who wants to have good biryani...

Now come to the food we ordered Chicken cheese kabab,chicken biriyani,chicken tikka masala and salad and wanted to have the firni but after taking the order they disappointed us by saying its out if stock..
Okay so the chicken cheese kebab was good but some were the chicken quality was list in these certain years as I have been here many a times before.
Now the chicken biriyani it was good, less oily but lil less amount, potato half cooked, and the chicken piece I started laughing after the chicken it was typically polio marka chickenüòÇ
Now the chicken tikka masala the gravy was good but the chicken pieces were full of fat some how no chicken likes it was watery types.. Very disappointed with the chicken quality specially..
Arsalan not the one we know..

This place needs no introduction perhaps. Although Arsalan has opened its branches all over Kolkata, with Park Circus itself housing two of them, this is perhaps the most popular one. And with the recent addition of the second floor, its room for accommodation has gone up. It's one of the oldest biriyani houses in the city, and people who have tasted their biriyani can hardly find a better one. However, apart from the Biriyani, which is quite spicy and undoubtedly delicious, my other favourites from this place are the Arsalan Special Chicken Cheese Kabab, and their Phirni.

Now, you can order any kabab you want, and be assured that it's cooked in the perfect Mughlai style, with the right amount of apices. But the Cheese Kabab is, hands down, their best. The cheese just melts in your mouth, and with the chutney, the taste is out of the world. The chicken or mutton side dishes are equally good, with the Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala being one of my all-time favourites from the place. And to end it all, the Phirni. Try it to get the real taste of it. Mere words cannot describe it.

You're not a true Mughlai lover, if you've not visited this place. Highly recommended!

Wednesday late evening and the crowd was moderate. So the biggest negative of this place, that of tables jostling with each other was a non issue. Service was prompt, polite and professional. The biryani tasted great & much better than last time, the mutton pasinda was OK. Washed down with a cola, it became a dinner the doctor would never approve of. But it was a great family outing with good food, conversation and a sly burp. Parking was easy as it was after 9.30 pm. Worth going back to every now and then.

Kolkata is famous for its alu biryani and this place is the best to try it out. Arsalan is the final stop for ur gastronomic quest. The biryani is amazing, aromatic long grains of rice with the perfect amount of oil greasing it. The alu is so tender tht it just melts in ur mouth. The mutton or chicken is full of flavour n gives ur taste buds a feeling of rejoice. The other items which are a must try here are the Arsalan special kabab. Pieces of reshmi chicken kabab chargrilled with cheese in the tandoor.. The murgh lahori has a typical awadhi taste to it. The tikka kababs as well as the tangri kababs are par excellence.

Who said Biriyani was meant to be spicy . The chicken is succulent, the aroma is rich and flavorful. A welcome change from the sad and hyped kolkata Biriyanis sold across the city. The ambience isn't all that great, but the simplicity in the service and the fresh food on the table will beckon you another time. Thumbs up for me.

Being an iconic biryani destination, you will be disappointed by the service that they offer at the first floor. they are good, when it comes to take away foods and delivery, but the service part is irritating during all of my dine in experience.

I had few friends visiting from Delhi and i thought of taking them to park circus Arsalan, which is open till 12 midnight for an experience. we ordered mutton biryani, that that its all been consumed. considering the fact that we were late, we asked them for chicken biryani. after few minutes, a seniors person walked in and they said, chicken biryani is not ready it will take time. we said no worried. we will wait. serve us the other things in the meantime. they agreed and started serving the other food that we ordered. after like 5 minutes, another person walked in and said chicken biryani will not be possible. only mutton biryani they have. we said no problem serve us that only.¬†

Too many goof ups and service staff looked lost.¬†

Good for take out. will not at all¬†recommend¬†for dine in experiences..

This is the only Arsalan outlet I come to, whenever I plan of having Biryani. Also, while my stay in Mumbai, I had always missed the Biryani out here. So, while am in Kolkata and Biryani is on my list for lunch or dinner, this outlet of Arsalan is my favourite. I have come here may be innumerable number of times, most of the times with my elder brother and sometimes alone. You basically dont need a company out here, all you concentrate here is the food. Inspite of my several number of visits out here, this is the first time am writing a review and am happy about it that for the first time am reviewing my favorite Biryani joint on Zomato.
Location wise its the easiest to find, tell any cab driver to take you to Park Circus Arsalan, he will take you but yes, please do mention that Bridge ke niche wala Arsalan and not the Seven point one. 
The number of times I have visited this place, I have always found this place full of people. I most of the times get the same table to sit, coincidentally. Being a regular customer, the waiters and managers are very well acquainted with me and they always treat their customers with much respect and value thats what I live about this outlet. I have become so regular out here that the waiters doesnot even give me the menu now whenever I visit, because even they have to come to know what I will be ordering. Haha! Most of the times, I order Chicken Biryani, sometimes I change it for Mutton Biryani when am
High on my red meat cravings, a sweet lime drink is a must for me, and to end my meal with a dessert, I go for their special Firni which is another delicacy I love from them. Sometimes, I go for Chicken Tandoori when I accidentally become little diet conscious. üòÉ
Biryani - the aroma of Arsalan, finely selected rice, the aloo that they add in it, the juicy tender chicken/mutton pieces, the spices, the tenderness and taste everything adds up to make it a delicacy worth eating from time to time, everytime. I just love it! Coming to the tandoori, they serve it well-grilled, with very little oil used, non-greasy, well spiced-up, with a good quantity of salad of cucumber and onions finely chopped in round pieces, and the yummy raita of dahi and finely chopped onions. Sweet lime that they serve is so refreshing, that I order it the first before I start off with my main course. I love their Firni and I never miss out on it, it just has the perfecr taste with the perfect amount of sweetness and milkiness, the rice granules are so fine that you can actually feel the softness, they are served chilled and with a kesar flavor which you can make out from the aroma of the dessert.
The prices are always pocket-friendly. Sometimes, when I go for a take-away order, my bills are exempted of the service taxes also, only the mrp (inclusive of taxes) mentioned on the menu are added up. I love this Arsalan outlet and will keep visiting it time and again. ‚úåüèªÔ∏èüòä

Average place. The tables are cramped (upstairs/AC) while the non ac part is smoky and noisy. The biriyani is their main selling point but a lot of it goes by the name. While the Biriyani definitely was good here along with the Firni there are definitely better ones like in India Restaurant, Khidirpure. The quantity could have increased given it's price. Overall an average place you can go to with friends or if you just want to check out what the hype is about. The other dishes r average to disappointing.

The chicken tandoori, chicken malai kabab and chicken reshmi kabab are absolutely fantastic.

Arsalan(PC) review :

Truly, I am yet to figure out the reason behind the long queue.Found it to be an overhyped place altogether.Taste was just normal.
Parantha was better at Nizam's,Laccha Parantha was way better at Chachaz hotel.As Biriyani is the most consumed dish here,I took a detour.Ordered Kebab and Chicken Do Pianza.Do pianza was less onion and more tomato.May be I was wrong,either I had tasted wrong recipes of do pianza (before yesterday) which tasted better,or may be Arsalanz do pianza was carrying some subtle taste which my taste bud could not figure out.But the Martyr Chicken did not lie,felt it to be undercooked and extra juicy.Which confirmed my beleif, all hurry and less attention,made do pianza an ordinary dish.That's the game big eateries play,you eat your words before you speak out,Arsalan prepared it,then it should be the best Do Piaza.

Did not manage to get a seat upstairs because I went alone during peak hours,so they clubbed me with 2 guys and a couple.Sheer discomfort for a 5 feet 6 inches guy.The tables were high,chairs were low and small.I could Imagine Sachin,Amir dining at Arsalan,they would run away.
Waitors were on the angrier side mostly.
Overall,this was a place I would not like to visit with my family,atleast not for fine dining,rather I will request a home delivery.
I am sorry,if I have hurt anyones Arsalan sentiment for breaking the stereotype but that's the way I found it was.

If you are in Kolkata and haven't tried Arsalan for some Biryani and kebabs then you have missed out the most popular and yummy biryani in the city .
Located in park circus 7 point crossing this restaurant is running the business for years now and till date they have expanded their business over the city remarkably capturing foodie lovers to dwell in their food experience . Arsalan has two seating arrangement so they had made two floor where one will have air condition which is on top and the ground will be without air but sufficient fans to cool you , and restrooms is also there that is kept clean .
Coming to the food I must say they really have some seriously good flavoured biryani sufficient enough for 1 person and in fact little more for one person to eat so they dont compromise with quantity , then the ingredients is very rich which does give you a feel of a high standard biryani making it always a choice on priority for people who love biryani.
Apart from biryani other dishes and foods are available Indian breads like naan , roomali also they have rice there, different types of curries like chicken kassa ,chicken chaap , kebas are all prepared with the same standard for years now.
Moving over heavy meal now Arsalan also has roll counters outside the restaurant as you enter you will spot it making rolls for people to just have a quick bite which is made very nice and garnished well too.
With everything seem to be close to perfect over here I always feel the price factor at times is a look out but nevertheless food is simply ( A ) standard and I tend to come here on a regular note .

Do I really need to review Arsalan that too the Park Circus one? üòÇ Oh yes! I need to mention how much I love the place. Several visits and the same love for their food! The best biriyani of Kolkata. Best tandoori rotis, best side dishes. Love of my life. :)
Just one complain, Arsalan you made me fat!

It was a weekday n 6.30 in d evening....
Yet full house,not even a place to sit.
Obviously it was none other than the main park circus 7 point Arsalan.
My most favourite Mutton malai kebab n mutton biriyani n d best biriyani making cuisine in kolkata.‚úå‚úå‚úå
As there was no sit,we have to took it away. Our orders were....
1. Arsalan Mutton Malai kebab(10 on 10 for its smoothness,richness in malai n of course for its heavenly taste).üëèüëèüëè
2. Mutton biriyani( undoubtedly 10 on 10 for its lip smacking taste n biggest mutton pieces they give always as compared to other Arsalan outlets).üëèüëèüëèüëè
3. Mutton Chap (8 on 10 for the taste was unique,but some how mutton bones were bigger).üëåüëåüëå
4. Mutton kasa (again 10 on 10 although it was slightly oily n spicy. But you don't find very taste of mutton kasa if it's not spicy n oily).üëçüëçüëç
5. Mutton rezela (always my hot favourite though rating 6 on 10 cz the pieces were smaller this evening).
Although we didn't get sit n we didn't wait for it,yet d staffs were quite friendly, very cordial, helpful n well mannered. I liked it so much.üëçüëçüëç
I didn't know,but today only I ve noticed that this Arsalan outlet got best biriyani outlet award from zomato reviewrs in 2013. They deserve it every year. üíúüíúüíú

Daddy's birthday celebration is incomplete without ARSALAN. It's his favourite. We ordered mutton masala, naan, achari kebab and malai kebab. All dishes were extremely delicious and well cooked. Mutton was soft. Kebabs were as usual juicy. Achari kebab's pickle type test didn't suit my tastebud well. But my husband liked it a lot. I just loved malai kebab. It was slightly different from reshmi kebab. Overall the celebration was superb.

I don't have to talk about the Biryani because the crowd and the waiting, all of that is a sign which speaks out loud for Arsalan. 

I love the Tangri Kebab specially. It is a bomb. I always order that. You would want to try all the kebabs there. It is mouth watering just the way it looks.Everything was good but Firni could be a lot better.

I don't need to tell you how good this place is as every biryani fanatic who lives in Kolkata or been to Kolkata  knows about this place. The ambience is ok and so are services but the biryani is heavenly; also they serve some of the best Mughlai dishes at their prices. I always visit Arsalan when I am in Kolkata so should you if you love biryani as much as I do.

Although the new outlet near Ruby is closer to my house, I revisited this outlet recently on the 1st of Jan. The Ruby one was too crowded. Hundreds of people clamouring outside. The crowd here was better managed. We stood in a long winding queue on the footpath outside the resto. But it took us barely 20mins to get a place inside. It was my first time on the upper level. Nothing very special. Place is pretty ceamped and I didn't like the blue light. However nothing matters once you get your plate of biriyani. You forget the world and keep eating. I've tried the mutton, chicken and the special biryanis. The specials have two pieces of meat. Otherwise tastes the same. I love the firni too. Not too sweet. Clearly the best biryani in the city.

Am an ardent lover of Arsalan Biryani from the day one. I visit Kolkata once a year & make sure I eat atleast once or twice a week in Arsalan & people who invite me over their places order Arsalan Biryani. Its just so flawless.

This year I had Biryani & some more items from Arsalan 4 times in 22 days. First day it was at Circus Avenue on 16th Dec'15 & I found the Biryani was salt-less & spicy-hot (jhaal in bengali). Cook Must have forgotten salt & added more garam masala instead. I added raw salt & had. Well, 2nd day at my friends house at Diamond City. They picked up from Park Circus crossing one. It was ok.

3rd Time I picked up from Circus Avn on the last monday of december & again it was so 'Teekha'. I never heard or had Awadhi Biryani so spicy hot - not even from Arsalan. It had always been a mild spicy & sweeter in taste as the mutton they cook marinated with Khowa / Malai. 

4th time on 2nd January 2016 -- biryani was once again abnormally HOT, the  paneer preperation had more green chilis than paneer. It was simply horrible. Could eat at all.

Why? Why Kolkata biryani has to be spicy hot? Most bong ppl avoid spicy hot food. Either check your cooks & change them or change your recipe. Ask their preferences and deliver the same. Not all to everyone. I had an opportunity to taste our childhood fave Aminia's Biryani in this visit & they are heavenly. Is Arsalan going down? Not only that -- when I was discussing about this in the party -- most of them supported me & they stopped ordering from Arsalan & order from Aminia or Shiraz instead... 

Dear Arsalan, I know, your name is growing faster than usual, going far places in moments -- but Pls dont go so far that its gonna be tough to retufn

When it comes to biriyani and tandoori ... You can trust Arsalan with eyes closed...
I have visited many times and in many outlets... the park circus 7 point outlet and other the park circus outlet which is near the park circus uddan are the best ...
The biriyanis are really delicious and perfect (not too spicy ,not too oily) ...
Chicken and mutton gravies and Tandoori are also scrumptious...
Kebabs are spicy and tasty ...
I have tried different types of biriyanis here... mixed prawn and arsalan special mutton biriyani are the best...
Also Their Firni as a desert is very tasty...
The ambience is good but the service and the waiters are too fast and sweet mouthed ...
When Biriyani comes in mind ... the name "Arsalan " comes first...
But only thing is Arsalan is very known restaurant so always it is crowded... so u may have to wait for some times to get a table...

Probably the most over hyped mughlai restaurant in kolkata. Would rather not eat anything but have biryani from this place.. Went there to pick up a parcel at 11:30 coz no other mughlai restaurant is open til that late. I spoiled my entire night after having there biryani and chaap. Biryani was still ok but the chaap was terrible. Entire food ws wasted by everyone in the family.

For a kolkatan, biriyani and arsalan goes hand in hand and is almost synonymous. I have been having their biriyani from a long time and till date enjoy it. Though most of the time i prefer take away..i have dined in the place too. The place is a crowd puller and it is almost full even on a normal day. If visiting arsalan on any holiday or infact sunday, there is quite a qeue. This joint is very minimistically decorated, but the indoors are neat. The staff is courteous and the place can boast of a very quick service( but this holds true only for the biriyani, because kebabs take a long time to be served). Now, coming to their usp...i.e their famous biriyani  which is super delicious. I am a big fan of their special mutton biriyani. The flavour of the dish is excellent and the best part  is the mutton piece and the ever favourite 'aloo'of the biriyani, which are amazing. The biriyani is very light and not at all oily which makes it a treat. The other favourites of mine from this place are the chicken tikka kebab, mutton kakori kebab and my utmost favourite fish reshmi kebab(a must try if visiting for the first time). I personally feel this outlet of arsalan serves the best food in both quality and quantity  compared to the other ones. The price of the food is justified based on the quality and quantity.Though my review may sound a bit biased, but whenever the word biriyani is uttered the next thought of mine reads arsalan. Hence.....Highly recommended....!

No doubt Arsalan is one of the prime leaders in Biryani at Kolkata. I have started my journey with Arsalan around 10-11 years back. At that time, it was only one, the main 7 point crossing restaurant. Now they have come up with many branches, but I still prefer the 7 point crossing old and main joint.¬†

Arsalan Biryani has it's distinct signature with a kind of well balanced juicy texture. It's not that oily, but it is rightfully done to preserve it's moisture. The nose and palate both feels excellent distinctive character. The note of ghee is slightly less dominating compared to Shiraz. But very well balanced. I noticed the Garam Masala, to be specific cinnamon is slightly more dominating over kewda or rose water. Saffron gives a right aroma and colour, while the mutton fat adds a perfect savory flavor. There are two versions of mutton biryani there, the ordinary and special. I always go for the special one, not because there are two pieces of mutton, but I always found some dried fruits in the biryani, which adds up more flavor.¬†

Generally I do not go for Chicken biryani, because I do not identify Chicken biryani with my taste. Along with the biryani, I always like to have a green salad and nothing else. Not even any cold drink. To me, mixing any other flavor with Biryani is a serious offense.¬†

The service at the busy hours can be frustrating. But that goes with the fem of every restaurant in the city. You attract more with your good quality and ¬†your service suffers. Thankfully, it is only the quality service that suffers with the huge crowd not the quality of the food.¬†

I am a big fan of Arsalan. But I have one advice to the people who are going to taste Arsalan Biryani for the first time. Have it there itself. Don't take it to your home. The magic disappears with time.¬†

For the Kababs, all are good. They have a special Arsalan kabab, which is kind of Chiken reshmi wrapped with cheese and then baked. But somehow, I think this doesn't go with the Mughlai tradition of the restaurant. They should change the name of the dish, as Arsalan is known for Mughlai cuisine, and this dish is a fusion dish.

Arsalan..one of my favourite places for mughlai food in the city.We went to the newly opened branch in park street near Mocambo.The place is quite spacious consisting of two floors,as we were a group of 10 we were made to sit in the 1st floor.So lets jump to the food quickly
Starters:chicken reshmi kebeb,chicken haryali kebab,chicken tikka kebab all the kebabs were good,my personal favourite being the reshmi kebab...it just melted in my mouth but didn't like the haryali kebab much as it was on the drier side.

Mocktail:dont really remember the name but can be said as strawbery based mocktails which was tasty indeed.

Main course:chicken biriyani,mutton biriyani,kashmiri Pulao,butter naan,roomali roti,mutton stew,chicken kassa,mutton pasinda.All the three rice dishes were excellent..tender meat..perfectly cooked rice.The butter naan was a bit hard to tear and the roomali roti was as usual.All the three gravies were very good...The star dish being the mutton stew,tender pieces of mutton in a spicy gravy...it will just make you drool.The chicken kassa was also very good & was in a red gravy.The mutton pasinda was good aswell.

Would always love to visit here again and again.

Maybe the best place for biriyani in Kolkata. The soft juicy mutton and well cooked rice and the "biriyani aloo" , leaves you with heavenly tastes and craving for more although your belly will be filled. It's tandoori is top notch too. Perhaps mughlai food in its best form is available here. Although space crunch is a concern and the only mole of this beauty of a place. A must go for anyone wanting to enjoy Kolkata's mughlai cuisine.

Another heritage of Kolkata.
This place cannot be missed if one is standing at park circus 7 point crossing.You will definitely find people making a queue to eat over here.This restaurant has a non ac section and an upper ac section.We got seated at the non ac section to be greeted by an old waiter.

The restaurant feels fresh with enthusiastic people enjoying their food.
We ordered mutton biriyani,chicken malai kebab and a chicken gravy item.I am pretty sure the old man served us a different gravy item.the chicken pieces were so soft.The biriyani was superb as well.(Ofcourse not beating dada boudi biriyani,whose mutton portion remains unbeatable and also being the most tender..coming from a North Kolkata snob).
Happy eating..:)

At the time of writing, this place has a rating of 4.3 with 3311 votes. I apologise if I hurt your foodie sentiments, but based on my today's dinner experience at Arsalan Park Circus, I rate it as an overhyped, overgrown, rotten, dingy, filthy place to taste good Biriyani at Kolkata. Again, based on my sole experience, I vehemently oppose all the good ratings and reviews this place has received so far. Either the Kolkata Biriyani lovers have completely lost it, or there is a problem with the review system, or most of the reviews are posted by the near and dear ones of the restaurant's owners, or I was plain unlucky, or a mix and match of some or all of these. Here is why:

1. The ambiance: Old, filthy and dirty. The floors are "divided by two". No fans, only split ACs right above the tables. Nice way to stay cool! Tiny tables meant for 2 had 3 chairs, when we requested for 2 chairs only, the waiter needed to seek an approval from the higher management if that could be done. The city and red tapes - inseparable.

2. The waiters: Clueless of which is which. We ordered Arsalan special Biriyani. We wanted the authentic Arsalan Mutton Biriyani, and that was the one suggested by the waiter. Here is where the problem started. What we received was RED SPICY RICE with no flavor. When we enquired what was it supposed to be, the supervisor said it is South Indian Biriyani. South what? We came all over to have the South Indian Biriyani which is from Kolkata? Flawless! It had 2 mutton pieces which were hidden in the red rice, if you know what I mean. Bravo.

3. The management: Further to that, I went downstairs and complained to the people at the cash counter downstairs, it had 2 senior people, and while I mentioned that problem of how come your authentic Biriyani was missing the a of authenticity, he turned it around and had the audacity to blame us for wrong ordering - "aap ko pata hona chahiye tha aap kya order kar rahe ho". Yeah of course Sir, I should have known your version of special Biriyani is nothing but spicy red rice. Bravo. He offered me a consolation prize of a complimentary pack of mutton Biriyani which I now taste as no better.

All in all, my personal opinion is, Arsalan Park Circus has grown too big for its shoes and has forgotten usual stuff like ambiance, customer service and of course food quality. I will of course never venture near, nor would recommend. Go there at your own risk. PS: It does not provide good photo ops too, only you may post an update saying that you have been there, or maybe you will be more social if you broadcast you had been there or say you live for and like the food there. Good luck! Aminia, Shiraz, Zeeshan, Alibaba, here I come.

Nonetheless all the hoopla about this place, I found the food here to be fairly average. Even their hallmark Biryani (I tried with chicken and goat meat) didn't seem any better (or worse) than what you may get at Aminia or Nizam's at a much lower price (and be able to avoid the mad rush).
This place is under-staffed and the servers make mistakes with orders pretty often.

The food is crowd pleaser and makes you happy if you are having biryani. But if we order a roti than by the time we call the captain for second roti/naan and wait till it comes the food gets cold. If we order 2 or 3 rotis together than the roti gets cold. Please figure out a way to balance this. Except for this it would have been a fiver instead of 3.5

Arsalan is an evergreen restaurant which never seems to run out of fashion.
Whenever I am in town I make a point to visit this place. It has been probably 10 years I am eating in this place and yet I still cherish Arsalan.
MUTTON BIRIYANI in Arsalan is always an obligatory choice. For me it's as if Mutton Biriyani is the deity in the Mecca of Arsalan. With succulent and soft and juicy mutton coupled with a dum potato, and the beautifully flavoured Biriyani, Arsalan always manages to tickle my taste buds for good. The main feature of the dish is its ridiculously pleasant and 'Mon bhorejawar' aroma. It's as if the aroma in itself is sufficient to please your tummy. For me Mutton Biriyani in Arsalan is a habit, and a good habit must always be treasured.
FIRNI
A post Biriyani sweet dish, FIRNI in Arsalan is a beautiful pudding and a good appetising dish in Arsalan is never consummated if not for a FIRNI. It has this incisive sweetness, which I absolutely adore. And so, FIRNI in Arsalan is always a welcoming dish for me.
KEBABS
Apart from the brilliant Biriyani they serve, Arsalan is well known for its Kebab. Smokey and tasty as they are, the different kebabs they serve will surely conjure your taste buds for good. The Reshmi Kebab and the Malai kebab are always asked for and hence are pleasured.

Normally, I generally give a lot of importance to service and ambiance. However, for special instances as in this case, one may turn a blind eye towards those aspects for the food they serve is happiness personified. That being said, I absolutely love as to how quick they serve the food and yet they are fresh. I always love the fact that even though the waiters are super busy, they still lend a ear suggesting you different combinations, and I haven't yet encounters any unpleasant behaviour so far. A kudos to the entire Arsalan family.

Bon apetit üëå

Stared walking from Esplanade we finally reached the Park Circus wala Arsalan after almost 35 mints!! I don't know why this is the main and the biggest and the 1st branch that have opened in Kolkata that I've heard of!
Since my college life I always wanted to be here. Today it's finally achieved! I have been to the Park Street wala branch.

Ordered special chicken Biriyani.. Which is close to Rs 300... Its was like a good Biriyani and nothing else. It had two large pieces of Chicken and one aloo and one egg. Paneer butter masala was pathetic! A bit too salty I'd say!
What eneded well was the Firni!! It was yuummmmyyyy...Laccha paratha was good BTW!
Yes..
I have been to the Arsalan main branch located at Park circus 7 point crossing!

Well! We had been to the Arsalan at Park Circus 7-point for a number of times. On our last visit to the same place, we discovered that there was a huge queue waiting to be seated in the restaurant. One of the workers there suggested us to visit the Circus Avenue outlet which remains comparatively empty. And hence we landed up here. The seting place was much more spacious than the 7-point outlet. The ood needs no mention here. However we tried a few items new here like the Chicken Arsalan Masala, Kadai Murgh apart from the traditional Biriyani, Reshmi Kebab, Tandoori Roti. Chicken Arsalan Masala was just great.

Biryani!! Quiet to die for simply. The rounded taste of spices including cardamom. Took a take away so can't judge interiors. In case you are indecisive, go for this one for sure. It is rich, but how horrible would a low cal biryani taste, isn't it??

Having heard so much about Arsalan, we decided to go there with family last night . We were 6 of us. Being a Monday the restaurant was nearly empty with just 2-3 tables occupied. 

We ordered - 

Chicken Reshmi Kebabs as starters 

Chicken Biryani

Mutton Biryani

Chicken Kashmiri

Mutton Pasinda 

Chicken Bharta 

Roti's

The Chicken Reshmi Kebabs were very dry and tough - a result of just being reheated and served. On complaining , they brought another 2 plates but they were also dry and tough. 

The gravy items served were luke warm and we had to send them for reheating . 

The Biryani- somehow the rice is not fully cooked and the grains are also smaller . Dryish and again not hot . To be fair the Mutton piece was thankfully cooked and soft . 

The rotis were undercooked and cold. 

By this time we had lost the entire appetite to eat . 

What made it worse was that the staff was busy chit chatting with each other and appeared to be discussing us as if we were from Mars and had no business to complain. 

Few well meaning suggestions for Arsalan to improve - 

1. Do spend some effort to train and retrain your serving staff.  

2. Have someone senior to oversee operations . It appears that no one senior was in the establishment and no one appeared in command of the place or  interested to work 

3. Serve food piping hot . 

4. Get a good kebabchi . Your kebabs were an utter disappointment 

5. Train your serving staff to understand that indian food needs to be served with serving staff careful about rotis being served at the correct time and should be piping hot. 

I know Arsalan is a much popular place but to me they just don't seem to be able to get their act together . It would take a lot of persuasion for me  to attempt another visit.

Most popular and the best outlet among all the Arsalan in Kolkata ... In kebab the special Arsalan kebab is a must ... And they make the one of the best biriyani over here.. No other outlet can make this kind of biriyani ..n this is coming from a non biriyani lover which is an honest judgement ... And in roti section they are the best in tandoori roti ... Must try.. Also the mutton rezala and chicken reshmi and tikka butter masala is good.... 
Try out ...

I have had always received brilliant reviews of this place. So I decided to go down and taste their 'heavenly' Biriyani.

I was thoroughly disappointed. The chicken biriyani was nowhere near what I expected. It was cold, the rice was hard, the aloo not fully boiled. Tasted like something you get from the average roadside Biriyani stalls.¬†The chicken Tikka Kebab was good. Their lachha paratha was too crispy. The chicken Bharta was tasted okay, although slightly oily.¬†The chicken Tengri Kebab was good. The chutney provided with the kebabs was very tasty.

The staff wasn't really very courteous. They kept urging us to order the main course although two of our friends hadn't arrived yet. We had ordered starters already but it didn't pacify the waiters.

Don't expect good service. The salad was served after the meal was nearly over. We had to ask for water which was supposed to be served first of all. Only biriyani was okay, this was horrible and not juicy. They ask for tips after such a bad service. Overall it's a third class restaurant.

Do you love Biryani? Have it here!
I just love their chicken biryani with a plate of chicken chaap... But I always begin with the Arsalan Spl Chicken Kebab which is a plate of juicy chicken kebabs rolled in melted cheese and finish with a bowl of firni, which is just as legendary here as the biryani.
Really great food.

The cons are: very cramped up and parking is a big issue!

This is like paraphrasing a nursery rhyme its so well known for Biriyani and Mughlai delicacies. Still penning my ecstasy with the Kolkata Biriyani.  They serve some awesome kebabs. The most specialized ones are Kakori (soft minced meat binded with mutton fat rolled like a sheek  kebab) ...pure delicacy. Special Arsalan kebab (fish or chicken) are lipsmacking tandoored with molten cheese. Not for the weak hearted it's really wholesome. Murg Wings Kebab...deliciously spiced n tangy tender chicken wings charcoal grilled. Coming to Biriyani , it's aromatic flavoursome rice with tender meat , potato & egg . It actually half melts in the mouth when hot. Excellent. The bharta is a healthier option to opt if the Chaap is overwhelming with The Biriyani.  Although Mutton Chaap is a super option with the butter naan. This place is a saviour for late night Biriyani cravings. Seated at midnight having piping hot Biriyani is a dream experienced.  Passionately recommended for Mughlai cuisine lovers for a royal and budget friendly meal. Do not expect fine dining experience here just fall in love with the food.

Well if you really want to use the term "king of biryani" in Kolkata, then you do not have any other choice other than Arsalan. You will just fall for their awesome biryani. I have visited innumerable times, and I have never been disappointed. Amazingly consistent taste and flavours. The mutton or chicken whatever is served, is always juicy and tender, yet well cooked and tasty. Special mention to the biryani potato, which is a signature in Kolkata. Another dish worth mentioning is mutton stew, which unlike its name, is a spicy dish with whole pepper, goes well with biryani as side dish. Try the phirni for dessert. Pricing is good and staffs are cooperative.

I went to arsalan, park circus and I was really hungry. Its a common scene to wait in a queue for a table which is always well managed by the staff. The kebabs came surprisingly quick which is when I found out that they weren't fresh and were just re-heated. The chicken had lost its taste and texture and they had to change it. What I really liked is their biryani. Also while taking the order, the waiter informed that he would change the potato and the pieces of meat, if I didnt like it. Overall experience was good. Would definitely recommend for mughlai lovers.

I dont know what the hype is about their biryani, have tried it twice mainly once for checking it out and once on being late to return home and on a hungry starving stomach and the price is excessive, the quantity is very less, it is very oily, the chicken is tender but size wise is very small. Probably its more popularity that creates the crowd than the quality and quantity, have tasted better stuff at other joints, even some road side joints serve better quality less oily better chicken piece biryani at lower prices. Even their kebabs are not that good. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.

My cousins since long have been mentioning about this place that the biryani here is the epitome of best Kolkata biryani and so decided to visit while being on a spree of puja pandal hopping.

The non ac section was literally fully occupied even though we were there early in the evening. Luckily we got a table in ac section.

We ordered for mutton biryani and believe me it was awesome with tender and flavourful mutton pieces along with aromatic rice. Too good!! We also asked for chicken reshmi kabab which was also delectable and went well with biryani. All these at fairly decent price.

A must visit for one who have not tried here before and get a taste of this legendary place.

Arsalan at it heights. A famous place to eat in Kolkata as many suggested.The outlet we dined in is so congested and don't know how they could manage if more number group gets in. Tandoori Chicken is very delicious and a perfect pick here. Chicken Biryani is also good but not very reasonable for its quantity. Chicken kurma will be given at many places I visited as an addon but here we need to buy it separately. As in the pic the quantity is so less for that price even taste is good.Finally its good to dine in for its fame but not for its ambience.

biriyani from Arsalan has been a staple and having an outlet open closer to home is always a plus. Having said so, the overall flavour has unfortunately deteriorated over the last couple of years. And at every visit,  the prices seem to be climbing through the roof. 
Delivery took place within the stipulated time and food arrived hot,  so that's a plus. Kindly note,  the minimum order delivery varies based on location. Would suggest placing the order directly via telephone, than via zomato's new system (that is if you dont want to spend a grand in a go).

Its generally overcrowded in the non a.c segment of the restaurant , but the a.c segment is great with relaxing ambience , soothing lightings , well mannered waiters and the optimum temperature of the conditioner .

Coming to the Food :
We ordered
1. Arsalan Briyani - its kinda khatta briyani and u will get surprised by its taste . Try it if u want something new but not THAT GOOD .
2. Tandoori roti - smell is kinda peculiar but believe me it jst melts in your mouth .
3. Butter Chicken - Pathetically Delicious !! You will get 4 medium size chicken pieces and the pieces are tender and juicy . The gravy is superb and I bet u can't share it with your friends.
4. Chicken Tandoori -  Too Good!!!! OMG JST TASTE IT !! Its the best c.t I hv ever had . Also they it with a chutney, which makes it jst unputdownble .

Grt Experience .

This is my favourite Biriyani place in Kolkata. I just cant seem to have had enough of it.. Whenever I go to  Arsalan it's like a treat to me. The last time I ordered Chicken biriyani special, chicken tikka masala and mutton reshmi masala.
The taste of biriyani has an eerie way of pulling you back to this outlet again and again..

Simply the best biryani in kolkata.  I'm not much of a biryani lover but that didn't stop me going through 1 1/2 plates. The haleem wasn't half bad either though a little too rich for my taste

This being our first time in Kolkata, me and my colleague asked the cab driver to take us to a decent restaurant around Park Street (we had heard a lot about Park Street) and he suggested us to try this place near Park Circus..
We ordered for Chicken Tikka kebab and Chicken Malai kebab. The chicken tikka kabab was one of the best I've ever had. Not too spicy, not too burnt..this was just made to perfection.. 
If you are a fan of kebabs, you would love this place.. 
One area of improvement would be to work on their ambience. It needs some improvement!!

The food is OK,but it was quite surprising to know that the waiters did not know the difference between Reshmi kebab and tandoori kebabs.Anyway that can be for looked, the food on the whole is good the breads are soft and a very nice smell that you get because of the nigella seeds used but the decoration and the place is not well kept so that is a drawback and also the staffs are not enthusiastic.Personally I would not visit a place where the people or the staff aren't friendly.

Around the time of RAMZAN I always wanted to have 'HALIM' for at least one day. This is the time in the year when the Kolkata based 'BIRIYANI' restaurants keep busy their Menu with HALIM. In the evening me and my wife thought of having 'HALIM' and left for one of the renounced 'BIRIYANI' joint. On the way we decide that, as 'HALIM' is not the regular item from the menu so let's check from by calling them. But Alas they told us that 'HALIM' will only be available between 3 PM to 6 PM. So we ended up at some other place and decided that we will visit Arsalan on next day.

Next day we reached Arsalan around 3:30 PM. At that time we easily got table to settle down. And we ordered for Mutton Arsalan Kabab. It was soft and of very good test. Now comes the main part of the lunch. As suggested by the person who is taking the order we ordered only nun and HALIM. And I liked that very much.

I visited the place innumerable times. And the dishes exceeded my expectations every time. I am in love with their mutton biriyani. Every time I visit the place or take away the food from the restaurant I never forget to have the mutton biriyani. Biriyanis from Arsalan will always remain in number one position for me among all other Kolkata Biriyanis. The unique smell of the mutton biriyani will mesmerize you every time you go to the vicinity of that place.

When we are talking about Biriyani, no place in Kolkata is quite like Arsalan. They serve this unique low-oil, well-cooked and easy-to-digest Biriyani which scores big in the taste dept. You gotta order it to believe it.
I also recommend you to try their Reshmi Kebabs, Mutton Rezala and Butter Chicken while you are on it.

Now, a quick view of the cons. 1stly, the place is compromised for space. So you might have to wait in huge lines on prime hours. 2ndly, I'm not a fan of the dim blue lights in the AC lounge. It's not ideal for having a lively brunch.

But clearly, there is an unwritten code for every Kolkatan to pay them a visit at least once. They don't disappoint. :)

In these eight years of staying in Kolkata I never had the experience of dining at arsalan's main outlet in park circus. So,when opportunity knocked at my door I was exhilarated.... First,the ambience..well,nothing to write home about but I must say the decor was clean and the service prompt... Now,the food ,it was excellent we ordered mutton biriyani and special chicken biriyani.. Both were just out of the world,not too oily or spicy it was just the perfect biriyani in my opinion. In fact,the other arsalans I have dined in didn't offer such excellent biriyani!! Overall,a must visit...üòä

Both biryani and kebabs are equally mouth watering.

If you are a herbivore and have somehow made peace with aaloo that you get in the Kolkata Biryani, you'll like it. For the carnnivores, this can't get better anyway. One of most iconic Biryani joints in town definitely worth trying. (For convenience, try the home delivery option. The place is worth the half hour wait, though, at peak hours)

If one is in Kolkata and looking to have good and quality biryani, they should then be looking towards Arsalan. I have been having biryani, be it chicken or mutton, from Arsalan for a very long time since my school going days. It is an absolute delicacy and the food delivers an immense pleasure and joy. The food especially the potato they provide with the biryani just melts into the mouth. The meat is soft, juicy and tasty. Apart from biryani, one should also try their Chicken Garlic Butter Masala and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. The gravy is so beautiful and delicious that sometimes it may so happen that one might finish having the gravy prior to the Chicken.

The second best Kolkata biriyani restaurant available in Kolkata..its truly developing over the years. From my school days it has been the best food joint I could ever visit . Last Saturday I went there with my lady who is Die Hard fan of biryani and others Nawabi dishes. We ordered for chicken tandoori and two biryani and Chicken Arsalan Kabab. Her favourite is the chicken Arsalan Kabab which is actually a variation of the chicken cheese Kabab and is a speciality here. It was totally lip smacking and I strongly recommend this dish along with biryani and chicken tandoori here. So all foodies here keep rocking and keep enjoying Kolkata food.

I have actually lost count of the number of times I have been to this legendary outlet of Arsalan, but the strangest fact is - I never felt the urge to review it. Because I thought it needs no review, the food at this place speaks for itself. But after ordering from this joint last week my opinions changed a bit and I felt I need to pass on some suggestions and opinions about this landmark outlet. It was an office-delivery order and the total bill was over INR 5000/- and so we expected really good overall experience. Well, we almost reached there barring few points. We were told that orders from Sector-5 will be delivered only if the order value is more that INR 2000/-. We were fine with that point since we had almost 20 people for that lunch meet. But still after delivering, the delivery boys kept on asking for extra tip!

DELIVERY PROCESS: Well we had called them up a day earlier and placed our final order since they said you need to place the order a day ahead if you do not want your food to be delivered late. But then also after accepting the order (a day earlier) they said the food can't be delivered before 1:30 PM. We wanted to go for Arsalan, so we did not cancel the order. Next day we were pleasantly surprised when the food was delivered few minutes before 1PM. But then the delivery boys should stop asking and nagging for extra money, that's really irritating.

FOOD ORDERED: We went in for Chicken Biriyanis, Mutton Biriyanis and few plates of Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. The side dish i.e. the Chicken Tikka Butter Masala had 6 pieces of juicy chicken kebabs per plate in very thick and rich gravy which is extremely tasty, sinful and oily. The Biriyanis also tasted divine, the quality of rice was good and it was overall not so oily. The sweet potato was very well cooked, flavorful and was almost melting in the mouth. But sadly my packet mistakenly had two pieces of large potatoes and hence had very little rice in it which was extremely disappointing. The main concern is ‚Äì The quantity per plate has gone down drastically, we were still hungry after finishing our meal. That was very sad and extremely embarrassing for the organizers. Maybe this is only true for their home/office delivery orders, because I had a much better experience when I used to dine-in here at this joint. The joint has got no ambiance, remains over-crowded and has got mediocre service, but the food quantity served here is always sufficient and ofcourse no questions about the taste. These biriyanis now cost INR 170/- and it is truly disheartening if they still can‚Äôt fill in your tummy. Also I found the mutton piece in the biriyani had huge bones that might have occupied most of the space in that biriyani packet, sadly the mutton in there was not so soft, it was bit chewy and dry, that is so unlike Arsalan! But still I‚Äôll rate the food joint 4 out of 5 because this was not my first meal here, I really had splendid meals here several times in the past.

SUMMARY: Here are my granular ratings for this place:

Food quality: 4.1/5
Food quantity: 3/5
Food presentation: 3.4/5
Food packaging: 3.4/5
Delivery process: 3.6/5
Ambiance: 3.4/5
Value for money: 3.7/5
Service: 3.5/5

Overall this still remains one of my favorite spots to savor some delicious biriyani in the city. Maybe we won‚Äôt be going in for big office-deliveries again, but still we will keep on visiting this place for some memorable dine-in experiences.

Cheers!

GREATNESS : Arsalan at Park Circus 7 point undoubtedly serves one of the best biriyanis in Kolkata. The crowd here is overwhelming on any given day and if you visit here durings puja, boy, be sure to get your sits after a long queue. I have been frequent at this place for a really long time as the aura of this place pulls me to have a plate of biriyani. The ambience, the accomodation, the services etc all falls perfectly into place in here whether you are here with your friends or family. Very good place overall and definitely gives you and your tastebuds a great experince altogether.

It has been a preferable restaurant for me and my friends. We often visit here. The foods are very nice. The taste of reshmi butter masala wss still in my lips. Also the other dishes are very nice. Biriyani is also awesome. But the delivery of the rolls are very slow. We had to wait for over an hour to get our rolls bt the taste was good. Love visiting here again...

A visit to the famous arsallan has been on my wish list for a long time. Finally made a trip to it with my friend. We seated ourselves in the ac part of the restaurant which is upstairs. We ordered tandoori roti and chicken tengri butter masala. The dish was prepared to perfection and there were 4huge chicken pieces. The roti was hot and soft. It was a real TREAT!!üòä
As we were full we couldn't order firni. The waiters do not take much interest in serving the customers. The place is always overcrowded..we were happy to find a table for two. However the food more than makes up for all its flaws. Would definitely visit again.

If you love Kolkata biriyani, this is the place. There is always a debate with other contenders like Royal, Aminia, Shiraz etc. However I consider that as a clash of the titans, where ultimately biriyani wins. My personal favourite is Arsalan. Not sure how many times I've been here. Apart from the biriyani Mutton Pasinda is also a great dish.

Though i don't like biriyani very much but its one of the best biriyani destinations around kolkata as per my opinion, at this price range. Its not very dry like others & its smell was authentic. Chicken item (irani dish) Was very spicy & yummy & finally the firni it was a perfect end of a wholesome lunch. A must visit for biriyani lovers

Let's not talk about the quality of biryani they serve because it's too good. The hospitality is equally well. Though the food takes a long time to arrive but that is acceptable as all good things takes time. Gone a few days back with my friends and loved the place. Will be visiting again soon. :)

Nothing less than 4.5 for this legendary restaurant..my friend and i were in the mood for some biriyani and what better than arsalan.. We had to wait in the queue for about 15 min to get a seat..we ordered the mutton biriyani and a mutton dish. The long basmati rice had the perfect aroma along with a succulent piece of mutton and a potato. The mutton dish was quite rich and oily but tasted wonderful..an excellnt value for money..

Probably the only place in Kolkata which serves comparatively descent Biryani, but still you would be having dalda made Mughlai food till you are in Kolkata. 
Food here is Usual dalda made greasy Mughlai dishes and dalda made biryani which is A bit on the drier side.  
Their Firni is pathetic and has the consistency of malleable rubber.

Bad customer service, you wait like forever to get your food, Biryani is just OK (I prefer the Hyderabadi style better), but the rotis are the best, you need to visit this place to understand why rotis are called as bread, soft and filling
also dont miss the mutton rogan gosh and chicken chanp

I will name 3 items that taste like heaven here

Before places like Oudh, this was THE place to visit when your heart craved for some strong tastes. And today, though no longer unparalleled in this cuisine in Calcutta, it continues to be one of my favourites!

I have been to the one on 7 point crossing several times, this one was less crowded and more spacious. Food Quality & Quantity was same across all outlets that I have been to so far, however this one's quality seemed V slight better (personal opinion or may be because I was hungry).
For Price sensitive people(like me), If you choose to sit & dine then add Rs. 10/- to each item on the menu card displayed at Zomato website (The menu displayed here at the website is the takeaway menu) and thereafter add 20.1% (5.6% S.Tax + 14.5% VAT) to the total bill to calculate the actual amount that you shall be paying.
Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala & Arsalan Special Kebab ( Cheese Kebab) are sure to steal your heart.
Time & again, the same request if possible, please publish/display your menu card with all inclusive prices.

One of the worst experiences I have ever had.

I was staying at The Park hotel and searched for good non vegetarian eatable places nearby and out of the list I choose ¬†Arsalan(out of my bad luck). I called up to ask for directions and asked ''Bhaiya main Park Hotel se bol raha hun...'' and before I could continue the person on the other end said ''To??? Main kya karun?'' I said '' Bhaiya naraz kyun hote ho?'' and He says''Hum Park mein delivery nahi karte''. Well I thought that was an enough I had for the day hence I just hung up and avoided going there.

Am I glad I went here for lunch! To say this is carnivore heaven is not doing it ample justice. Went with two big boys so had 2 plates of mutton chaap, dal ghost, two mutton kassa, a mutton biryani and phirni. If you are in Calcutta, dont mind superbly oily and rich food once in a while, and appreciate heavenly food, you'd be pretty foolish to not visit! Yes, its packed and its ambience aint worth writing about but the gritty, hardcore foodies who worry about food will be richly rewarded.

The real address of authentic Kolkata Biryani is Arsalan. I cant say exactly how many times I have been there, or how many times we have ordered for home delivery. The count goes endless....

Biryani, kabab, tandoori preparations, firni and especially the chicken cheese kabab here are some of the trademark food items which I have orders times again and again.
Located at the Park Circus crossing is well connected from all ends of the city. And a must must destination for foodies.

If you are a biryani lover,then this place is right for you.. 

Arsalan is really the king of biryanis,besides biryani you can also try some other mughalai items like chanp,kebab etc.. 

The interior of upstairs air conditioned room is pretty much comfortable and relaxing,the light is dim,if you are with friends or family,you better choose upstairs air conditioned room for eating,the ground floor interior is average but it is not so relaxing because of rush... 

One have to wait in a queue for around 15-20 mins to wait for his turn,especially on Sunday,that's the most annoying thing one foodie don't like.. 

But if you want to taste the real mughalai food and you have not visited Arsalan,you don't know the taste of real mughalai food.. Must visit this restaurant with your friends,family or relatives..

After reading a lot of reviews and hearing about this place from a friend, we decided to try out Arsalan's Park Circus outlet yesterday. We reached there @ 7:30pm. It was very crowded. We ordered chicken biryani. The staff were polite & attentive. The service was really quick. Ambience was good & the prices are reasonable. We found that the biryani was well cooked & was really tasty. The chicken was succulent. But the potatoes were undercooked. We're looking forward to trying out their kababs next time.

If you are in search of good biryani, arsalaan in definitely the place to stop by. Its taste cannot be written in words but can only be perceieved by our palate. If you are thinking to go,  its better to have a reservation as the queue can get pretty long. I had tried their reshmi kabab, chicken bharta, and of course the most famous biryani. Highly recommended if you want some food that will bring back wonderful memories.

Average Food, crazy rush for their biryani which strangely enough, according to me, seems too overhyped. The service is a bit rushed up, and at times seems like their waiters are on the white powder, egging you to move on to the next phase of your meal, and then hurriedly show up with the bill. Average place. Average value for money.

Well in kolkata my personal favuorite biriyani is Arsalan's biriyani... the biriyani is juicy, which i like most... i dont like dry biriyani... and the balance of fragrance and spice is perfect... uust try biriyani of this restaurant... except that u can take arsalan special kebab... which is chicken wrapped with cheese and spice... its mouth watering... one more delicacy i will suggest ... if u r goin with family plz order a murg masallam ( u hv to pre order it 4hrs back) ... trust me... best murg masallam i hv ever had... a whole chicken staffed with egg, nuts , dry fruits and spicrs... its really tastes mind blowing!!! Its pocket freindly... so u can go whenever u want!!! :)

If you talk about biryani in Calcutta you have to name "Arsalan" first. I judge the quality or the standard of biryani of any restaurant with Arsalan because in Calcutta Arsalan is a brand if biryani. It has been almost 8years since I am having biryani from Arsalan but there was not a single day when I realized the standard of  biryani has dropped even a percentage. Yes the place is not for fine dining , yes the place where it is located is not very posh  but if you keep this things aside and just concentrate on food then this place should be your ideal destination to have Mughlai cuisine.. Biryani, Mutton tikiya and  Chicken chap are the all time favourites of mine at this outlet..

Started eating at Arsalan even before the city had its craziness for Arsalan.
In the recent past, the biriyani has lost its touch a little. But, for a first timer Arsalan would stand out. Mutton Stew is a must order. It is a hidden gem product of Arsalan.

I'm not typically fond of mutton or chicken so I tried their vegetable dishes for a change. I have had navratna korma in many restaurants so decided to try their's and guess what it was very delicious and one of the best I had. Every ingredient put was perfectly cooked amplifying the taste together. I also ordered their special arsalan sabzi which unlike the previous one was little bit spicy and hot.
I know it's a bizarre idea to try their vegetarian dishes instead of their biryani but yes if you get bored like me you can take my suggestion for a change I hope you won't be disappointed.
My rating 4.0 would be for the korma, it was too good lol. I wish they served beef :(

I had read a lot about this place on Zomato so decided to visit to satisfy my non-veg taste buds. We ordered a Chicken Kebab platter and a Garlic Chicken Gravy. The food was decent but not as amazing. To be fair the place is famous for Biryani which we didn't try. The restaurant also serves complimentary coke. However, for some reason, they refuse to take it back if you don't want it. Seemed wasteful.

Ohh my poor Kolkata brothers and their sisters.. If this is one of your finest biryanis, then I'm sorry to crush your fairytale dream world... But this definitely wouldn't qualify for that title in Mumbai... 
It was very bland, negligible/no masala, limited mutton pieces, mutton wasn't soft enough... Also the shami tiki wasn't up to the mark
While I haven't travelled too much within india to recommend places around the country but for Mumbai, please visit the following
Lucky restaurant - chicken biryani- Bandra
Persian darbar - raan 3 in 1 biryani- multiple outlets
Britannia cafe - chicken berry pulao - fort Ballard estate
Golcondas bowl - biryani is good not amazing but is served with mirchi ka Salan and is worth a try
Kakori house (strictly no biryani but their kakori kebab is heaven and shami kebab is very good) - multiple outlets

Cheers,

if it is biryani it has to be arsalaan form. love the food and place. Then only thing i would go there is for a biryani and nothing else. Even the chaap is good, service wise it is slow if you order something else apart from chaap or biryani.

This outlet has lost its charm completely ..¬†MUTTON Rogan Josh is of very poor quality ..Curries are drenched in oil ... hardly any place to sit .. and very slow service..Raita too is a FLOP over here .. Kebabs are tasty though it takes nearly 30 mins for them to serve ...and the firni .. it SUCKS !!!

Their biryani is something special..a 'must visit' place for food(biryani) lovers..the kebabs and others chicken item are just as good as their biryani..though it always remains full of crowd, it is always a pleasure to visit arsalan..
It mainly is a place for casual dining, but the food they serve is off a very high order.

Pandit Manish Sharma is a very talented musician , who plays Jaltarang so well that , there are times one quivers whether a water fall is nearby , he can also create the same magic by using various utensils and crockeries , one of those instrument is thejal tarang. I always dreamt to play the instrument like him , my visit to Arsalan restaurant in Park circus accidentally created that opportunity for me , it was 17th of July'15 , me and my family made our way up to a dimly lit Air Conditioned enclosure to enjoy a lunch , which resembles more like an underworld infested gambling den than food joint. Tables and chairs are packed in that limited space to accommodate as many foodies they can,such was the comfort that, one can rest his arm on his neighbours shoulder while having the meal. We could somehow locate a table and piled and jostled around each other centering the table. After settling in , we observed in disbelief, that even after spending considerable amount of time , not a single waiter approached our table. Then I located a silent man , possibly the cashier , sitting in the farthest corner of the room with a small pile of table mat kept on the table in front of him. I could attract his attention and requested for a waiter , he gestured , that , waiter will be attending shortly. The angel, our coveted dear waiter appeared exactly after 5 mins , & took our orders . Then my dream opportunity to clone Manish Sharma's magic arrived from no where , after Mr Angel took our order , we have to wait another significant period of time for the empty plates  to be put on our table, and then the wait was endless ; I could then suddenly discover that my chance to fulfill my musical destiny  is just a palm away , I picked up few spoons & could  play thejatarang on empty plates. I am enclosing some pic of empty cutleries , sadly none of my compatriots endorsed and like my idea of playing the instrument, so they have not taken my pic during the performance.
Finally the dishes arrived , the afghani pulaow was tasteless , mutton boti kabab pieces to be discovered under a microscope , hariyali chicken was boiled chicken in a green paste , the chicken biriyani was  ordinary to say the least , the only good part was "Mutton Chap" , it was delicious. In between the meal we have to wait and wait for even a glass of water, for a spoon , for a coke and for so many small things . The final amazement came in the form of bill , we have to pay a hefty price for an ordinary meal & service . I will still thank Arsalan Management for giving me the opportunity to achieve my dream of cloning my respected musician.

YOU SHOULD READ THIS REVIEW, ESPECIALLY MY FOLLOWERS. ITS IMPORTANT.
The reason it should be called ARSALOON.

OR A*salan.
*COMPLAIN BOX*
I hope I don't have to come back again.
*because reviewing this experience would be a sin*
Entered at 8.45 pm. Immediately got a seat for 3 of us. The restaurant has the SLOWEST service in the city.
People in the table in front of us, ordered their food 10 MINS after we placed. They got it before us!
Ambiance is acceptable and the lights are blue.¬†
The steel chairs are really a pain, you cannot lean on them, it will hurt and its cold so you would feel uncomfortable please get better ones, its just soft on the bottom, the rest is *OUCH*..
¬†
There is ***only one man ***taking all the orders, who is ignorant and is slower than Internet Explorer.
There is no mobile network inside the restaurant.
Salad was served 20 mins before the rest of the food was served, What's the utility? NOTHING!
Once an order is delivered to a table they never attend or look at the table, not even if called, still some other person staff heard us( the order taker was lost). We added 2 more, he went away , did not inform the chef.
May be the inner tables get more priority.
Orders:
1 Mutton Biriyani(5/10)
That Rich delicious Biriyani or Arsalan is DEAD. Yes foodies! Its dead and there's nothing the foodies can do except post a bad review in Zomato. The mutton piece was small and the rice had small bones mixed. Quantity wise, its not up to the mark at any given day, with this quantity I can have 3 plates without side dishes.
2 Plates of Chicken Biriyani (5/10)
Same problem with the Richness and Quantity.
The Chicken must have been on Diet, so it couldn't grow much flesh on its body, poor Arsalan staffs got tricked.

Reshmi Butter Masala (6.5/10)
Just Averagely good. Proper quality and quantity. 6 pcs were decent in size.

While having our food, as I was saying earlier the man heard our order but did not inform the chef. That time we ordered Shahi Tukra and a plate of Chicken Biriyani to be packed.
We called for the bill, it was brought after 15 MINUTES! The bill did not have the packing food amount. We told them, they took back and came back empty handed for the packing order, where we got to know that previously our order wasn't informed, they said that Shahi tukra would take ***30 mins more!!!!
It was already 9.40 pm. We Took only the Chicken Biriyani and left.

THE PACKED BIRIYANI HAD A HUUUGE POTATO, WHICH LEFT OUT NO SPACE FOR THE RICE! NOT WORTH RS. 175
PLEASE VISIT AFZA, ZEESHAN , ALIBABA GOLD,ZAM ZAM, HAJI SAHEB OR SHIRAZ.

After such a Siht service, the one who took the payment, took the normal payment(card) and kept the diary on the Table. And was standing there, looking at us, like a beggar for the *TIP*.

*DELETED MY OLDER REVIEW BECAUSE IT WAS TOO MAINSTREAM*

DDIFFERENT FOODIES HAVE DIFFERENT BUDGETS, OPINIONS AND EXPERIENCES AND THUS, READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS FOR BETTER CONCLUSION BEFORE INVESTING FOR THE LOVE OF FOOD. KEEP GOBBLING.

When you want to have delicious biriyani just think of Arsalan.
Probably the best Biriyani in the city serving mouth watering biriyanis and other delicacies.

You just cant ignore the aroma and the taste which Arsalan provides.
You always carve for more and more and want to come back again to taste the delicious foods.

Whenever the word "biriyani" comes in the mind of any Kolkata people, one of the first names that come in our mind is Arsalan. This outlet is situated at park circus 7 point crossing and a long queue is visible in most days. We went there twice. The taste of the biriyani is vey good but it is too much oily. The quantity of the food is also not satisfactory. We took biriyani, mutton rezala, tengri kebab and cold drinks. Mutton rezala is not up to our satisfaction with too much oil. We liked the kebeb. 
The air conditioned sitting area is too much congested. It is not at all a good dining experience. This restaurant can be reached for its famous biriyani but only as take home delivery. With lots of new restaurants giving special care in dining atmosphere and also serving "healthy" and tasty biriyani, this once very famous restaurant may need to renovate itself to keep itself up with the present dining scenario of Kolkata üòä.

If you are a Kolkatan and have been a fan of splendid and delicious Biryani, then you must have tried out the Arsalan Biryani of all the Biryani serving outlets present in the city.

Not just the aroma, the taste and especially the spicy potato that crumbles in such a
tempting manner when you try to break it and almost melts in your mouth only goes ahead to certify Arsalan as being one of the best Biryani Houses in all over Kolkata.

To top it all, the Mutton Biryani is a speciality that Arsalan in particular takes pride in along with the Mutton Kassa side dish. It is a complete worth for the money spent and a delightful experience for the foodies.

Arsalan's biriyani and kebabs are one of the best that are available in Calcutta. The mutton biriyani and any choice of the kebabs firm a great combination. Having a plate of firni to round off the meal is a must. Haleem is available during the Ramadan period.
There is a huge rush at this place, no matter at what time you visit this. You are expected to order fast, have your food fast, pay fast and leave fast. Lunch time is the best time for the biriyani. Once we arrived for dinner, and was probably served the bottom layer from the biriyani handi which was more oily than usual.

Chicken biryani is just too good but it's quite heavy too..
You must try ¬†Chicken cheese kebab which is wrapped in cheese, and justs melts in your mouth..
I personally prefer Shiraz's biryani now days ¬†because it's less oilier than this..

The "Awadhi Style Slow Cooked Biriyani" is the first thing you should search for in the Menu. Everything other than the biriyani is acceptable except the frequent rushes which would make you frown( you won't get a seat that easy, one of the best place for casual dining). One more thing that I'd want Arsalan to improve upon is their service. I rate it a bit lower than other restaurants. Their welcome isn't that warm :).

If there is heaven on earth, its surely is Arsalan for me. The best Biryani. Period.
At one point I visited here almost every week after college all by myself. Ordered a chicken biryani. Ate it with divine dedication. Its so well made that you get the flavour in every strand of rice. Follwed by Chicken arsalan kebab which is wrapped in cheese and baked. It is simply the best edible thing on planet earth. The firni is sadly not always available as they run out of stock.
Overall a complete foodgasm. If I feel low anytime I go to Arsalan. It magically works.

According to me Arsalan's biryani is the best in the city. The aroma, color, proportionate spices, quantity everything is just too good. Tandoori, chicken lahore masala are up to the mark. But the special mention is the arsalan special chciken kebab. Cheese covered and perfectly fried kebabs will just melt in your mouth and give you an immense pleasure. Firni is must after a heavy meal.

Located near the park circus crossing, was very excited about their 'so-famous' biryani. But it turned out to be an utter disappointment. Their biryani was literally soaked in a pool of oil and the butter chicken wasn't butter chicken at all, it was just some white gravy floating in a pool of oil.
The only reason i gave then a rating of 3 is because of their rolls, especially their paneer roll.

I remember, when I ate Biriyani from Arsalan in the early 21st century, I forgot all other restaurants who prepare Biriyanis. At that time the price was ¬†Rs. 55/- for Mutton Biriyani. The Biriyani taste always pushes me to go and eat that one. Now it¬†is become 165/-. Whenever I go at Arsalan, I always ordered Biriyani and any side dishes, But the known fact is there is no need for any side dishes with this Biriyani. This restaurant also famous for Rolls and Kebabs. Chicken Malai Kabab is the awesome one. Many other preparations also good, but only Biriyani is best in Kolkata.

Just had my lunch last Sunday during the high hour. After reading i felt, it's impossible to get a table, but luckily that never happened. After going up, i was stunned. How on the earth a place such small can provide a sitting experience. Frankly i didn't like the space as it was too crowded, intimidating, not-too-good for second time. But but but, the smell of the biriyani, chap, halim and tandoor made me forget about anything else. They were wonderful. Tandoor took some time to reach at us, probably she was not expecting us to order that. We had mutton biriyani, chicken chap, halim and tandoor. The quantity of biriyani is apt for two if you are ordering other dishes. However, biriyani should not be shared (that's what i feel). The mutton was deliciously cooked, the chicken tandoori were fine and halim was toooooooo good. The gravy of chap is another fav of mine. Overall, i can go there again and again only if they update the sitting area (which is hard). Decor is nothing to mention. Go for the food, not for anything else.

Arsalan is one of the most popular mughlai restaurant in Kolkata. Among all arsalan outlets this one is best. Its is always busy. To get a table you have to go early. Some how we got table after a long wait. We ordered chicken lahori, chicken dopiyaja and lachcha paratha, tandoori roti. Chicken lahori was very tasty. Ambience was good and service was also very quick. Mughlai lovers will definitely visit here. Thumbs up from my side for such  nice dishes.

Doesn't even require a mention if you are in Kolkata and you favour the Mughlai cuisine. This restaurant has made its name in the city, especially for its Biriyanis and rolls. Located prime at the 7-point crossing of Park Circus and very visible to the open eye. The crowd outside starts to hover at the late hours. The rolls are the best I ate in the city. The Biriyanis have a lil spice but are the ones to never miss. The kebabs are a craze here.
Trust me, this is a competitor of the elite club of mughlai restaurants in the city and state.

"Arsalan" does not need any expertise review, it already become a Tag... It was my pleasure to be there at the time of Roza... Me with my office colleagues went there to try their special "Halim" .... It was too awesome.. Started with chicken tandoori, so tender that was, then tried Halim with rooti.. It was so creamy and spicy along with mutton pieces.. Then ordered firni, and the showstopper "Shahi Tukra"... I must recommend all to try this Shahi tukra over there...the best dessert I have had... Awesome food experience...

this is my second best favorite place for biriyani after oudh 1590, it's Lucknow biriyani is excellent, while its firni also deserves a special mention. Btw this place is good casual dining and take aways only, strict no for luxury and family outings

If you visit the restaurant in person it's best Biryani in Kolkata. But delivery service is very poor. They deny missing items in delivery and pathetic experience if you are arranging a small party depending on it's delivery service.

During the time of billing the waiter literally threw my Card across the table after swiping it in the machine .as he thought he won't get a tip, and after that kind of attitude definetly he wont.

This is the busiest of the Arsalan chain and also the most preferred.
The place is always crowded and at times you may have to wait to get a table. But when you get in, the seating is comfortable and the service is quick.

I prefer the biryani here, but other mughlai dishes are great too. A must go for lovers of biryani & mughlai food.

As everyone know it is a very popular restaurant of Kolkata and so every time I visit here I had to face a long waiting line outside it. The ambiance is not good, the space is very small but the moment you get the touch of their food into your mouth all these negative things just wash away. The biriyani and chap are awesome, I prefer the Kebabs also, they are very delicious. Though I like the outlet at Hatibagan more because it has ¬†more space, the decoration and ambiance is very nice, the quality of food there is more or less same.

Ordered a delivery for an office party for 20 heads. Chicken biryani, Mutton biryani and Chicken chap. All Kolkatians know about the Arsalan Biryani, its one of the best we find in Kolkata. However, on the chicken chap front was surprised to get stale chicken chap. Was pretty disappointed with the stale chicken chap. Just called them up to let them know. Embarrassing situation in an office party.

We had ordered a home delivery for a full course meal consisting of kebabs tandoori biryani butter naan and daal makhani...
To start with the kebabs.. It was over cooked and burnt
Chicken tandoori was stale and smelly.. When I took the same to their restaurant the same day to complain they refused to take it back and said I must have exchanged it with some other restaurants product, then I approached the manager, he was willing to help but he told the cook to attend me who refused taking it back because "ee toh khaya hua hai!" I left it there with him.
Biryani was like arsalans, no doubt but the chicken pcs had shrunk.
Now coming to the butter naan... Do you call that a naan, it was just a tandoori roti... Naan is a multilayered thing dude and they charge 60 bucks for each of that shit... Its better to buy tandoori roti @ 5 bucks from a local shop and put another 5 bucks ka butter on it for a satisfying result.
Daal makhani was good though.
But with the starters our mood also became stale and a get together of friends were spoilt.

Arsalan  doesn't need an introduction in Kolkata who loves Mughlai cuisine and Kolkata style biryani. I am not a fan of Kolkata style biryani hence I will not comment on biryani, Kolkatian  thinks Arsalan's biryani best in city. Me along with my two colleagues visited this Park Circus 7 point crossing joint on an weekday luckily we got the seats in the AC floor immediately. The logic is very simple there just enjoy the food don't give a damn about ambience. Food served really fast there. We ordered mutton biryani, mutton stew, mutton chap and firni in desserts. Firni and the mutton chap was superb. Rest was okay. Who loves oily Mughlai food it's must stop for them.

This one is really good for takeaway, there service is awesome and preparation are best in the town. However , the horror descends when you go for lunch or dining. They simply fail to manage the sheer inflow of crowd and the waiters are not properly trained and are highly unprofessional. One would be safe to order the traditional dishes and not experiment too much because honestly they have an expertise in Biriyani and that's what one should go there for. Ordering anything else is a big loss of money , mood and time.

The Calcutta biriyani which is famous for the huge sized baked potato should at least being tasted from here only, the dine out place does not give you the five star comfort, the glass, the plate with which they will cater you the foods are actually ordinary, but they have decent air conditioning and if you are a foodie, you will never mind about the standard environment, its not cheap, all kind of people goes there, from middle class to the richest and the reason is their quality of food will slap in the face of many five star awadhi and north Indian cuisine. They are really famous for their Biriyani, my suggestion is to try Arsalan Kabab which is available in both mutton and chicken wrapped with slightly molted chicken.

Great Mughlai (Lucknow type) place. With great Biryani, kebabs, chnaap, korma and a lot more.

Pros
1. Great food. Especially biryani, half the population can swear by their biriyani. Its absolutely brilliant.
2. Great location, bang on Park Circus crossing.
3. Massive portions. Its feasible to feed two average persons off one serving.
4. Decent prices.

Cons.
1. Mildly difficult to get parking, although the security does help you considerably.
2. If you are planning to visit on a weekend or on a holiday, be prepared to be in a que for about 30mins. (The wait is worth the food).
3. The food may be a wee bit oily, so if you are on diet ask for a less oily portion.

Overall, a foodies paradise.

Arsalaan is one of the best biriyani places in the world and definitely the best in Kolkata. Kolkata style biriyani which is a derivative  of awadhi style biriyani is cooked on slow flame with basmati rice, chicken/ mutton and potato. It is not as spicy as the Hyderabadi style . Arsaalan has a number of branches in Kolkata but I perfer the one in Beckbagan for its lovely ambiance and decor. The food is of same high standard everywhere. apart from its world famous biriyani....one should also try the arsalan special kebab which g=has a coating of melted cheese over it...just awesome. If you love Biryani this is just the place to be. LEGENDARY !!!

Arsalan undoubtedly is one of the best Biriyani houses of our city. The delectable Mutton Biriyani offered to titillate the taste of Kolkata takes the restaurant to the acme of its glory. The kebabs, and especially the tandooris, must be tasted with sweet delight. Wonderful place, where quality is strict and value for price: at its humble best.

We ordered Mutton Biryani, Chicken Biryani, Chicken Hariyali Kebab, mixed Raita & Firni. Biryani was quite good, mutton was soft, less oily. Kebab was good, tinge of green in it. Firni was good also.

Note: Min price for home delivery is Rs 2000.

A foodie's journey in Kolkata is never complete without biriyani. And where better to have it than at Arsalan. This being the original outlet is by far the best and thus also has a huge crowd pull. I would recommend a takeaway or a delivery rather than eating at the restaurant but you wouldn't be disappointed by the service inside either. I always go for the arsalan special mutton biriyani with rezala on the side. The taste and consistency is perfect and they are never off the mark. I am always racked by guilt after the sumptuous meal as my diet goes down the drain but the phirni gets me over that!

Kolkata being my hometown i always use to get busy with lots of household stuff and when ever I thought of biryani use to get it from nearby always thought of going to Arasalan was very far from my place and they don't give home delivery to my place for less than 3000 rupees. I use to go to sealdah station and on my way it used to come but as was always in hurry to catch the train never got down. One evening just decided it's high time so went there using auto then bus reached park circus. I ordered chicken biryani   Lucknowi mutton biryani chicken rezala and chaap.
The total amount was around 950 but quantity was huge for 5 adults 2 children for 2 days 
The taste of biryani and chaap was too good that was there speciality they were beyond expectations 
Only thing would want store at south Kolkata or home delivery to naktala

Located bang on the 7 point crossing, this place is always extremely crowded. People order the Kolkata Biryani (simply called Biryani in Kolkata :) ) like crazy here. Not a place known for the ambience, you would end up taking away from this place in most cases (unless you are out on a cheap date and you don't want your parents to know).

No review which I write will do them justice because they have already made a name for themselves because of their brilliant Kolkata Biryani. But if you've never been here before, do try their biryani, roll and firni.

I had heard a lot about this place from various acquaintances, so tried this place out. I was there for lunch with my mum, and the place was completely packed. We took seats on the first floor. The first thing I noticed was how claustrophobic it was. Hardly any place to move at all. The ground floor was comparatively open, but it was full of school kids and people mostly there for a short meal. So for ambience 2. 
The food was good, I recommend the special biryani; my mum liked it very much and so did I. 4 for the food.
The service was mediocre; nothing too great. So a 3 for that.

As usual best in town while it comes to biriyani. 

This time first tried the Arsalan special kebab which was just awesome . It had a soft coating and tender chicken inside. It was really mouth watering.

Then took the Arsalan special biriyani which was again a masterpiece. But nowadays I think it is getting beat more oily.

May be I am wrong but thanks to Arsalan for carrying this legacy for such a long time without any quality compromise.

I went with my family to the much famed Arsalan restaurant at their park circus branch... The facility is clean and I went on a weekday , that could be the reason... We sat at the upstair AC restaurant, our server was exceptionally good and courteous..
Now coming to the food... I mean they are in the level of folklores and I was not at all surprised. I mean we had the best awadhi/ mughlai delicacies ever eaten... Started with the tangri kabab , done to perfection with the optimally charred aroma and texture.. Succulent and tender ... Amazing in one word. Next the magic moment we had all been waiting for... Came the special mutton biriyani.. Special one makes sense as it comes with two pieces of mutton , one full potato and a boiled egg... Man you gotta taste it to believe it... They are Godly.. The taste is like the first kiss... It's been in my mind And I want to do it over and over again and again.... One is sufficient for two persons... To end it we ordered the firni and that is another Blockbuster... Not too sweet or rich , simply magical.... Can't wait to be back here again... Yeah next weekend sounds just about right ;)

And I tried their famed haleem and mutton stew at my uncle's place... amazing again !!!
With rumali rotis I couldn't have asked for a better dinner. ¬†:)

I generally order a mutton biryani, mutton stew (it goes surprisingly well with the biryani. You can also have it with tandoori rotis) and a garden salad and finish it off with a firni. Its heaven.

Arsalan is another legend from kolkatta, which serves kolkatta style mughlai biryani , which is drool worthy and carry a style of its own.¬†Biryani is well flavourd , fragrant yet rustic in its appeal , wit tender mutton and the most deliciousnuse of potatoes that makes this arsalan biryani on the must have list of any one coming to kolkatta.¬†Other must have is the kasha mangsho that we had , which was very tasty , service is a little slow and prices are reasonable.¬†A must try , Definitely.

Arsalan is an absolute paradise for Kolkata Biriyani lovers like me! It serves the best Biriyani and at amazingly reasonable prices. The kebabs and other side dishes are great too. Every item on their menu is an absolute bliss.
The place is always packed and you might have to wait a while to get seated, but it is worth the wait. Service is pretty efficient. So if you wanna try Kolkata Biriyani definitely drop in to Arsalan!

This place never fails to satisfy my hunger pangs for muglai delicacies. 
Brilliant Biryani . Just the exact proportion of spices in kebabs.
However a few waiter seems weird..They stare :/
Cause of lack of space on the 1st floor there isn't any privacy. ..However I think the food served there can forgo a few of its flaw.

Aah the name itself speaks of the food. This place is famous for their biryani. So I had ordered Biryani along with Paneer butter masala, Butter Naan and Firni.
Preparation was good. The meat was soft and tender. Had tasted firni for the first time. It was awesome. Prices are reasonable.

This is Park circus crossing area outlet, Biriyani and firni here is good. But enviroment is too crowdy, noisy. Most of the holidays you have to wait to get a table. Food quality is as i mentioned for every arsalaan outlet, kolkata's one of the best biriyani or mughlai more specifically lucknow styled mughlai. But still i prefer the circus avenue outlet more because better ambience.

Arsalan is another word for world class biriyani, followed by the firni. 
The side dishes include various chicken and mutton recipes, all of which are quite delectable. The biriyani is filled with flavour and aroma, enough to suffice as a single main dish. 
The menu is very limited, but each item is cooked to perfection. 
It is a treat for hardcore non vegetarians. 
I highly recommend their top notch firni.

I am visiting Arsalan since past 6 years. Their speciality is biryani. Kababs are also good. But the thing I have liked the most is Irani Khichdi. They claim that this dish is their speciality and well they don't lie about it.. BTW it is the best hub for mughlai foods in my opinion.

The place is famous for its biryani, which brought me here on the first place and it didn't disappoint a bit. The flavours were exotic and would entingle ur senses. Along with the biryani we ordered fresh lime soda. The soda had really good flavours and I would really recommend to try it. Everything was good there, just hope that the people there would be more cordial.

Well the name 'Arsalan' speaks a lot.No need to comment on their biriyanis.but they definitely need improve their mutton dishes. We got seat after waiting for around 15 mins. We ordered chicken reshmi kabab for the starters. It was really awesome. I would love to give 4.5 for the food but minus 1 for the behaviour of the waiters as they expect u to order main course only and leave the place as there were huge rush during weekends. For the desserts I will recommend firni as it is the 2nd best thing after biriyani.

By no terms Arsalan can be called a Fine dining restaurant, but for foodies who can die for the Biryanis and kebabs, it is one of the holiest places in Kolkata. I have tried biryani in Hyderabad, Delhi & Lucknow, but I found the Kolkata version of Biryani, the best. I have visited Arsalan several times and will be going there again & again ...

Almost every Kolkatan vouches for Arsalan's biryani. Keep health worries aside for a day and gorge over what they have to offer. Gets pretty crowded almost everyday, so advisable to go early, have your fill, and leave early.

One of the places I use to visit regularly during my Internship days. Their smell of Biriyani attracts you even from distant place. With a wide range of biriyani in the menu this restaurant also excels in Kebabs especially the Chicken hariyali kebab and the mutton peshawari kebab are my favorites. Don't miss out this place and grab as much kebabs and biriyanis as you can that will give you an eternal peace, because nothing pacifies you as much as a food a can, and especially BIRIYANIIIIII .......... :D :)

Been here many a times with friends since 2007. Arsalan Biriyani scores over anything. Still I'd say that the quantity and quality of Biriyani here  has dropped a bit over time. 

Things you should try?

1. Chicken Arsalan Kabab, 
2. Chicken Tandoori Kabab,
3. Mutton Biryani, 
4. Chicken/Mutton Rezala and
5. Firni. 

Umm... Delicious, isn't it? ;)

Well well well turns out the hoopla about Arsalan ka Biryani is not baseless! On visiting this place me and two friends of mine were lucky to find a place to sit! We ordered the Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani,Chicken Lucknowi Biryani and plain and simple Mutton Biryani. I went for the tried and tested and its a decision I have not come to regret. The Biryani was sumptuous and the Mutton simply delectable! My friends also enjoyed their Biryanis and if we had money we would order second helpings! The Biryanis took a long time to come which is understandable.. Staff r courteous even when they have hundreds of people there! But they badly need to improve their seating. Its for the seating I have given 4.5.. Would like to come on a Friday and have the Irani Khicdi n Murg Mussallam! Anybody reading this could you please care to comment on whether the Khicdi n Murg Mussallam is good?? Thank You.

I took one delivery from this restaurant..so wont comment regarding the decors or ambience....who cares about ambience anyways when the name is arsalan and you are dying out of biriyani hunger....the delivery time only matters, as it did for us...

We got it delivered to DLF II building from park circus. To be honest, the delivery time taken was not too long, but acceptable with a good level of patience. we had to wait at least 2 hrs after the order.

I had mutton biriyani and chicken rejala. The biriyani was oily, but awesome taste. The mutton piece was beautiful, soft and juicy. Rejala was tasty and chatpata, but, oily again!!! I enjoyed my meal and after a long while, I finished the biriyani and side dish within 20 minutes!!!!!

Thumbs up from my end!!!!

Arsalan, on hearing this name, the very first imagery that comes to your mind is Kebabs! Yes, you get Kolkata's most exotic kebabs over here only. I like their Reshmi Kebab, Haryali Kebab, Boti Kebab and Malai Kebab too. Their staffs will suggest you to go for Chicken Arsalan Kebab. Although my family goes gaga over it, but to be very frank, I just don't like it. Kebabs coming wrapped in a layer of cheese really sounds cheesy. Isn't it? Next comes Biryani with their celebrated Chap. You can go for either Chicken or Mutton because both are awesome! Sometimes, for a change I can suggest you to go for any breads or rotis with either Mutton Kassa or Mutton Stew. The gravy, which is red and spicy will leave you to fantasize about it till your next visit. Presently, Arsalan serves the best biryani, kebab and firni in Kolkata. So, for the Lucknowi delicacy, Arsalan should be your next choice. Happy Dining! :)

This is the first outlet of Arsalan in Kolkata, situated at the 7 point crossing of park circus. U will never and I mean never will find this place empty. There is always a mob standing outside the restaurant either waiting for table or picking up food parcels. This place is always packed. The sitting area isn't very expressive here . There biriyani is good not very rich in spices and flavorful but it is a bit oily for me. There mutton chaap is not very good. They give u a big chunk of mutton rather than small pieces of meat they do in zeeshan and royal hence it is not as tasty. But the biggest complaint I have with them is that they don't give boiled egg in there mutton biriyani like everyone else does.

Ok so talking about 'Arsalaan', one of the good old restaurants of the city of joy. Located in the Park Circus area with a glass door and the staffs greeting you with their smiles. I procrastinated before writing about this. Okay, a lot.. It's a place where I have been most of the time. It is specialised in North Indian dishes. But the Chinese is also a worth try. Biriyani is their u.s.p. And mutton chap is incredibly delicious. You can even try naan, rumali rotis, chicken bharta, recalls which are equally tasty.They will surely shot up your taste buds for trying some more. Even mutton ghee kebab, Reshmi kebab or boti kebab, is a good appetisers. Even their firni is also a worth try. And now going into the Chinese it's not that this place is specialised about, yet it cooks yummy Chinese dishes. Umm u can either do with rice or noodles whatever u like. But the side dish that I think are well prepared are Devils chicken or human chicken u can even try out their garlic or lemon chicken. And talking about their ambience, it's a nice place with black wooden chairs and tables. Dim lights and the aura of biriyani fills you up whenever you hit into the restaurant. But overall it's a good place to spend quality times with your dear ones.

I won't comment on the food here as I am quite sure everyone who loves Biryani and good mughlai food must have visited this place or at least have heard of it if not then sadly you are missing on something. Place is damn crowded I always find a long queue waiting to enter. I always prefer to depend on take away here which also requires a lot of effort and patience as there is always a queue there as well and no proper people management. At the end of all when you get to eat either inside if you somehow manage to get a  seat or at your own place if u manage to grab your order from the take away section you will realize it's all worth it in fact more than that. I can't blame them for the crowd waiting outside as I am often part of it :P 

Loved the food always and always, I will suggest get it packed and enjoy it at your own place the seating arrangements not that comfortable if at all you get to sit somewhere, it has AC above but it's very cramped and you will surely feel claustrophobic in there. Enjoy Arsalan at home that's my advice you won't regret the effort ever that I can promise, be sure to check your parcels told you not good in order and people management.

No need to put words for this Biryani Hub of the City, u can get so many dishes but Biryani is the only comes in mind when it comes to Arsalan or Vice Versa.. Fabulous food, well maintained and clean restaurant.. Staffs need to be groomed little and need to improve the handling tactics at the busiest hours, waiting for food when u r hungry becomes tough.. No doubt about the food quality but Biryani is a must have here...

So, a restaurant like Arsalan doesn't really need a review. It's on Zomato's list of brilliant Kolkata biriyani and the name of Arsalan has become synonymous with Kolkata biriyani.
However, I would still write a few words about the fish biriyani which I got delivered to my place a few days back. We mostly talk about the mutton biriyani from Arsalan, but this one is a gem in itself. It's a bit spicy and somewhat gravy than the chicken and mutton counterparts. It comes loaded with 4-5 succulent fish fillets, deep fried and red peppers and tomatoes. One portion should be sufficient for two. I would surely recommend this to those people who want to try something different at Arsalan.
Off course, I also ordered the famous chicken Arsalan kebab. Having so much cheese and chicken can be considered a sin and if that's a sin, I would be happy being a sinner!!!

Kolkata is known all over India for its version of Mughlai cuisine. The cuisine is a combination from the kitchens of  Awadh (stemming from the chefs of Nawab Wajed Ali Shah, who was detained here by the British), Muslim chefs from UP/Bihar as well as the Nawabi cuisine of Murshidabad. The restaurant which has got iconic status serving this food is Arsalan at Park Circus.

On a Sunday afternoon, there was a queue of waiting people on the footpath in front of the restaurant which is bang on the Park Circus crossing. It took around 15 minutes to be ushered upstairs to a table. The place was congested, not well lit, with a funny blue lighting.  Since we were clear about what we wanted to order, it did not take much time for the food to be served.

The Special Mutton Biryani was fragrant and mild. It is a huge departure from the spicy Hyderabadi version which I am accustomed to. The biryani had two pieces of medium sized soft and succulent mutton, one large potato and one egg. The long grained basmati rice had the flavor of ghee and kewra water, and did not leave an aftertaste of vanaspati which is the norm with many places serving Kolkata biryani.

The Mutton Chaap and Mutton Rezala were the other dishes we ordered and they did not disappoint at all. The sweet and sour curd and cashew based gravy of the rezala soaked into the soft tandoori roti was sheer heavenly, and the spicy and oily chap found its perfect foil in the roomali. At Rs 700, Arsalan provided another unforgettable experience which I will savour till I come back next

The food was brilliant as far as the taste was concerned. Ambience is quite okayish for a biryani joint. For good biryani of that sort, the price is also manageable. Only problem here is that the quantity against the quality lacks the fire. And also you have to wait to get a seat here. Overall the food is worth waiting for some time. Very nice experience altogether.

The best biriyani of Kolkata is found here. They prepare mughlai cuisines with top notch perfection. That is the reason why it is such a big crowd puller. You need to wait for a minimum of half an hour before getting a place to dine. Biriyani lovers must visit at least once.

This is one of the best locations in kolkata to satisfy your hunger, be it kebabs be it Biryani all will be served and the quality is second to none. 
Over the years this place has maintained it's glory and I realy hope it will continue to do so.. Cheers

This place needs no introduction. Not just localites, people come here to have their biryani from other states too. Located in crowded park circus area this place always packed and filled with tons of hungry customers and impatient energy. The dine in facility is average and most people go for parcel facility so that they can take home and cherish their kebabs and biryaanis. The service is pretty fast considering the crowd.

Coming to their Biryaani, i am not very fond of them as i have had better and extremely yum biryaani in kashmir and Delhi. More than the biryaani i have heard people talk very highly of their quality of rice which is longer than usual basmati and that it is their speciality. Anyways but if you ask me i find the taste just normal.

Coming to their mutton chanp- now thats a show stoppper. Extremely tasty very well done and blended. I just wish they could make it boneless as the bones come on the way and you cant cherish the item to the fullest.

Their malai chicken kebab, tandoori and mutton kakori was just yum. i would say their mughlai items are really mouth watering and pocket friendly too.¬†

Good news is that they deliver in plenty of areas. I live in kasba and they agreed to deliver whenever and specifically mentioned that they have expanded their deliverable areas. However that does not mean new town or rajarhaat so those living in these areas will have to check with arsalaan.

Overall i think this place does serve quality and quantity food and they have only happy customers.

Well, after all those good words by other fellows here I mention some hard fact about the Arsalan. As we all know Arsalan serve the one of the best biriyani in town but their other items are far behind few fine restaurant of Kolkata.

If you want to have typical Kolkata Biriyani then Arsalan is the place, if you are looking for north Indian and tandoor food you may have other better option than Arsalan.

The place is not at all cozy and you need to wait at least 30 minute to get a table, and every table is falling over to other table. In my last visit I have ordered Chicken Hariyali Kabab, Chicken biriyani and Kadai chicken. Honestly the hariyali kabab would earn less than average mark because the chicken was not tender, its hard and completely dry. One of the worst hariyali kabab I had ever have. Now come to the Kadai Chicken, its worst than any road side food stall. They gave 3 big pieces of hard chicken, you should workout before eat Kadai murg there. The gravy to so pathetic, its just ruined our time.¬†

But the biriyani was good as usual with out KAURA water and Roas water.

If you want to have only biriyani, then its suggested to take parcel as you enjoy more at yoour home than that over crowded restaurant.

Located at the 7 point crossing of Park Circus the place was bursting with human energy even on a monday afternoon! I do not know which one factor contributes more..the joblessness of Kolkata or the Arsalan Biryani craze! I guess both. The ground floor is non A.c but the topfloor has A.c. In both floors you need to share the table if you want to grab the meal. After a short wait of 5-7 minutes we were called up and directed to two vacant chairs. There is nothing about the ambiance.The upstairs is junked with more number of chairs and tables than the place can hold. The staff serves a HUGE number of people in a comparatively small space, so do not keep your expectations high.It is not humanly possible for them to attend all your whining needs in a matter of second. Having said all these about the superfluous stuffs..now lets come to the subject that matters..food! Our order included a Chicken Biryani and Firni. I liked both. The Biryani is Lucknow influenced one. Very rich in flavor. A bit spicy. It is served with a piece of Potato tucked within the rice. I liked the firni too!The quantities are enough to feed one hungry person. Lets say..I drooled on the Biryani and the taste dangled on my tongue pretty much enough to pull me again to Arsalan inspite of it being crowded and not in perfect ambiance!

Located in the heart of Kolkata, Arsalan redefines Biryani. Especially for those who are not from the city. The first time I tried Arsalan Biryani, I did not like it. For someone who was used to eating Thalappakatti Biryani in Chennai, it was a 180 degree U-turn. I was shocked to see a huge Aloo sitting in my biryani and staring at me. I mocked my Bengali friends - "Who puts Aloo in the Biryani??". Also, having the same without raita was another shock. After few days, I discovered its amazing taste and I have to admit that me and this Arsalan Biryani are something more than friends. Now it has become a part of my life and I travel almost 10 kms to Arsalan every week to eat here.

This place is amazing not only for the great food, but also because it captures the true charm of Kolkata. Located in the crowded Park Circus area, this place is like a shrine for Kolkata food lovers. At times I think Bengalis don't miss home food as much as they miss the Arsalan madness.¬†

My list of recommendations includes:

Mutton Rezala¬†
Mutton Kakori Kebab
Tandoori Chicken
Mutton Pasinda
Mutton Arsalan Special
Murgh Mussallam (with Kabuli Naan)
Phirni (for desserts)

My list of favorites is long and that is the only issue with this place. I have to struggle to chose which ones to order. The place is amazing because of it's excellent food and all the associated imperfections (crowded, loud and everything). If you are there in the holy month of Ramadan, make sure that you go there in the afternoon for some Halim.

Though there are many biryani joints in kolkata but this only is the best on today's date..........For ambiance,park circus is not a good option to hit at but park street and the newest outlet at hatibagan may serve your purpose.
Not only biryani,for starters the kebabs are delicious.I would personally recommend the Arsalan special kebab.Apart from its speciality ,the side dishes are awesome.
I woud say ,if anyone wants to have good biryani experience along with some other mughlai delicacies ,this is the very place one must go to........

My love for biryani  developed with arsalan.   The primary reason is their right blend of spices which makes the dish perfectly  flavored.  It is neither  too spicy nor too mild, but the flavor stays on which makes you crave for this place. Also this is one place which does not make biryani hell oily. If you prefer mild and proportionate flavors to strong ones,  this is the right biryani place for you!

Arsalan,
Location-Near Park Circus 7 Points Crossing.
This outlet serves the BEST BIRYANI OF KOLKATA. Well thats no new news.. Right???.. But believe me, during my first two visits i did not have the biryani..as i was a school boy bunking school for the whole day?For my first two visits, i had rolls. Now, the way they prepare the rolls is absolutely unique. For the first time i saw rolls made by people wearing gloves. That impressed me a lot. I had egg roll and chicken roll on my first two visits. They were goddamn delicious. Love them. My third visit was on Republic Day with my family. We came after watching a circus.. And we were dumbfounded when our eyes fell on the huge queue outside. Still, we decided to wait. Got four seats within 10 minutes. Now coming to the ambience,the non-ac section is just like any roadside eatery-small and cramped, but the foos made up for it. We ordered three chicken biryanis, one mutton biryani and two chicken reshmi butter masalas. The biryani.. My Oh My!..was soooooooo delicious. Arsalan nailed it.The aroma and the flavor of the biryani blew me off my feer. Every single rice oozed flavor. Just thinking about it tingles my tastebuds.. The chicken with the biryani was equally delicious. Now, coming to the chicken reshmi butter masala, I just want to say dat I had never seen chicken reshmi kebab pieces as big as Arsalan's. Wow. The pieces were soft, tender, juicy and the gravy with it was delectable. And the best part of the whole meal was that they wrote prices on the menu chart with the tax. Hats off to that.
On my fourth visit, i ordered chicken tangri butter masala with chicken biriyani. The biryani was as usual delicious. The chicken tabgri butter masala won my heart. Believe me, nothing in the world is as beautiful as four deliciously cooked chicken leg pieces in front of you. The chicken tangris were tender, juicy and was a little bit charred which actually tasted like heaven. I am surely going back soon to try the other dishes.

Oh how much I miss Arsalan when I am away.¬†

It is the go-to place for me in Kolkata for Biryani. When I tried it for the first time a few years ago I wasn't pleased with the idea of having a potato in my biryani. But over the years I have begun to love it so much that a fight ensues between me and Mr. A for a bigger share of the potato.¬†

Apart from the biryani, one mustn't forget their lip smacking special arsalan kebab. The cheese coating on the kebab is the best thing that could happen to a kebab ever! We always order mutton chaap to go with our Biryani. While it is definitely very oily, I can't simply resist its taste. According to me it compliments the Biryani like no other dish does.¬†

All in all, if you are ever in Kolkata it would be a cardinal sin to give this place a miss!

Arsalan is probably the first name when we talk about biriyani at Kolkata. Legendary brand name. They are consistently serving biriyani and other Mughal delicacies with a super fine quality at super reasonable price. I am a regular customer and whenever I go there I cannot resist myself from ordering a plate of mutton biriyani. Fine long grained rice, minimum amount of oil, very well cooked piece of meat, no rice grain combined together to make even a small chunk, heavenly aroma and mouth watering taste makes it one of the "don't miss" delicacies of the city. All the Mughal dishes maintain the same standard. However, got surprised to notice in the menu card that they are also offering some so called Indian Chinese dishes as well! This is something I would not appreciate. I believe, Arsalan is already so distinguished for their Mughal cuisine that they do not need any other cuisine to support the business; rather the flavours of Chinese and Mughal dishes are so conflicting that they should not be cooked and served under the same dine in roof - harmful to each other.
Dine in facility is averagely decorated. Ground floor is non ac and first floor is ac. Ground floor is always over crowded and full of noise, also too hot to enjoy the food during summer as the kitchen is just adjacent. Ac floor seems to be more peaceful.
I, last day had a long chat with the person sitting at the cash counter; not sure if he was the owner or co-owner. I wanted to get some idea of their Mutton Lucknowi biriyani. He was extremely frank and friendly to explain it in detail. I ordered it and liked it as well. It was a very pleasant experience for me.

The Park circus's 7 road crossing will help you locate Arsalan so much easily that you can rush to quiet your crazy hungry stomach. So, Arsalan totally lives upto it's reputation of being the Mughals of Biryani here in Kolkata :D¬†Chicken chap, chicken biryani (i'm too much into chicken so that's all i'll be writing about B) ) is heavenly or maybe the closest you can get to heaven after eating this (crazily delicious food i mean btw ).I won't write much 'cause you gotta be here if you are in Kolkata.¬†so gooo and get on a biryani spree and visit Arsalan and their food will blow you away.

On a biriyani trail, I ended up here which most bengalis swear by as serving the most authentic Kolkata biriyani. And I was amazed by the subtle flavors of this biriyani. The Kolkata biriyani, as expected, tastes similar to the awadhi/lucknowi biriyani with the sacrosanct boiled potatao on top.

I ordered their spl mutton biriyani , chicken tikka button masala and roomali roti. The greasy biriyani wasn't overtly flavorful but just had the right amount of spices. The rice was cooked beautifully, had an enchanting aroma and the mutton was tender. Lord potato, ;) , with a crispy skin had caramelized onions on it which accentuated its taste. The chicken tikka butter masala blew me away. The immaculately cooked chicken with the lip smacking gravy was a winner.

Situated at the heart of the park circus avenue, this place reflects Kolkata's culture. It has stood the test of time and showcases the unique taste and flavors of Kolkata biriyani like no other.

It beats it's counterparts in the run of Mughlai khana on town by leaps and bounds.It's the one restaurant in town where you have to wait in the line 24X7X365- Enough said for the craze.
Doing justice to it's Arabic etymology, it is the Leo of Kolkata's Biriyani Hub.

Arsalan and biryani have always been synonymous. My go to biryani place was always Arsalan. Not only for the biryani, the place is also known for its special kebab- chicken reshmi smothered in delectable melted cheese. 
However, was very disappointed this time. I had their biryani after almost two years. The quantity has been reduced, and there is so much grease in the biryani that you can cook another meal in it. 
This time I also had ordered for home delivery. The person taking the order sounded disinterested and insisted I increase the order amount to Rs 1000/- from 800/-. Or else there will be difficulty in delivery. Have never heard such ridiculous stuff ever. The city I reside in now has eateries delivering even a single burger! Now that's the level of customer satisfaction I am used to! After much deliberations , he agreed to deliver the order as another staff intervened and said that there is no such rule that only 1000 rupees and above order values will be processed. 
I did get my biryanis that day. However, I will think twice now about ordering for home delivery from Arsalan, coz of the whimsical attitude of the staff! Also , there are far better options in Kolkata for biryani, other than Arsalan. Totally over priced and too greasy for my liking!

Its my first time to Arsalan, but to write a proper review requires a fresh and fulfilling experience. Last Thrusday was such an occasion when we folks from office decided to go to Arsalan for dinner. This meant it was going to be a heavy! :)

Arsalan has a decent ambiance but I felt they require a clear refurbishing. Its true people come here for their mouth watering food, but they do need to make this place look better. 

Lets get to the interesting part. We started off with shorbas. I had choose ka shorba. It tasted pretty good. But briyani rice was the best. It was very rich and gave a strong flavor. Excellent drink to start the proceedings here. Recommended! Tastes the spices of Mughal. Its no doubt that people in Mughal region did their experiment in preparing the best Briyani. 

To Management: Kindly make the restaurant spacious.

Arsalan is a legendary name in mughlai and north Indian cuisine. They are most well known for their biriyani, kababs and firni. The chicken arsalan kabab coated with cheese is the best kabab I've ever had till date. The biriyani is obviously amazing. I also love their butter naan and mutton rezala. Though their is always a huge rush and struggle for tables, it's totally worth it!

being a biriyani lover, the 1st place that will come in mind is ARSALAN.
authentic mughlai cusine, the biriyani will blow your mind as it burst into flavours when put it in your mouth. the only thing that will come out of your mouth is wowwwww...                the roll counter is just outside the restaurant, even the rolls are delicious. Its an extremely pocket friendly restaurant. but if you dnt book tables you have to wait for long.. Heaven for Biriany lovers

Visited Kolkata last year after more than a decade. Ever since i was craving to have Arsalans biryani. This specific outlet has an open kitchen and some spacious dining area. The Mutton biryani , murg mussallam and roti. I kid you not but i did have a tear of joy when i had the first bite of the biryani. There are biryanis but Arsalans biryani is (i'm in tears again) phenomenal. The mutton is well cooked with their in-house seasoning and the portion is huge. Anyone travelling to kolkata has to visit this place else your trip is a waste indeed. Kudos to the management and for me they definitely serve the best biryani in the country.

A biriyani lover's retreat.
Have been there on multiple occasions.Have tried multiple biriyanis,and have a lot of favourites.Adore their Tandoori chicken kebabs.
However the mutton pasinda is a disappointment.It is far too oily for my taste.Wouldn't want clogged arteries would we?
A must visit though,for any biriyani shaukeens out there.

Arsalan is the best choice! :) 
Good ambience. Good food quality. 
Good service. Every thing one one wants. But it's not a perfect place for those who want some private time alone. It's always crowded and people in here create much noise. 
Yet it serves city's best biriyani! 
Happy biriyani eating!

Okay, so at last the famous Arsalan. Not at all tough to locate, situated right at the 7-point crossing. We, the six ravenous people, reached there at about 4 pm, and even though it was not lunch hour, the place was packed. Luckily we got a table in the AC compartment immediately, because the delicious smell coming from the kitchen was just too tough to take. On sitting we were informed that the tandoor was closed from 4-6pm, and we couldn't have tandooris or kulchas. Hearing this, almost all the others dived down in a plate of biriyani, but I for myself was never a biriyani fan. So after long pondering I went for rumali rotis and a plate of chicken reshmi butter masala. Now this is a dish I often order at various restaurants, and on that evening I was not feeling up to trying the unknown. I had reasonable ideas about how the dish might taste, and was happy with that. However, though they surely took their own sweet time to deliver the rumali rotis, as soon as I took the first bite, I was in heaven. That chicken was unlike any of the other variations I tasted, and to be honest it ruined that dish for me. After tasting their preparation, the couple times I tried to order it from any other restaurant, it seemed bland and tasteless. Besides that chicken reshmi butter masala all the items seemed to pale. I tasted some of chicken arsalan masala, which was good too, and had pineapples in the dish. As for the sweet tooths, the firni however, was a downer. It was just okay, nothing over the top, and seemed almost not worth the 40 bucks. However I'm sure I'm going to be back for the chicken. Pocket pinch was very light, 1100 for six. All in all, a worthy experience.

When one considers the best "Kolkata Biriyani", one shouldn't miss having Arsalan's delicious Biriyani with the utmost maddening aroma. They serve exotic ChiCken Bharta and CHiCken Do pyaza along with some extreme mouth -watering and tastebuds satisfying TAndoori platters. The one in Park Street being the first one is the most famous and well known ,the outlet in Behala, Taratala also serves good.

Everyone has heard about the amazing biryani that Kolkata offers! No one can miss it out on a trip to Kolkata.¬†Since I heard so many good words about Arsalan, decided to try it out with my family.¬†
As expected, it was very crowded as we went on a weekend.
We all ordered chicken biryani and my papa ordered mutton biryani along with chicken rezala and chicken korma.

The quantity was enourmous for all of us. No one could finish even half of it. It's surely value for money! However, the sad thing was I felt the biryani was not freshly prepared. Seemed like it was reheated and then served.¬†I have no qualms regarding the chicken leg as it was fresh and the spices balancing it out perfectly with the basmati rice.¬†
Chicken rezala was a bit blant for me, although the chicken korma was the best option, spicy and succulent as I wanted.
The star of the night was the shahi tukra! It made it into a rocking ending.¬†

The service was prompt and efficient. They seemed to have knowledge of the food menu.

I don‚Äôt know about you, but to me Arsalan is all about its Briyani And naturally this section is going to comprise the largest section of my Blog, Few people will also agree with me know that Kolkata is THE best place to eat biryani.¬†
¬†Choicest of cuts of meat and chicken. Superb biryani, fragrant, non-greasy yet power-packed with flavour is Dum gosht Lucknow mutton biryani at Rs 230)
It just had the taste of a restaurant biryani. The meat was completely tender and I disagree with everyone who thinks the rice quantity was more, because it turned out to be perfect for me. (MUST VISIT PLACE FOR BRIYANI LOVER'S)

Arsalan defines Kolkata style Biryani. It's like "kolkata te biryani bhalo kothaye?" and 90% of bongs would take the name of Arsalan in one shot. 
Birthdays, parties, anniversaries or any other kind of treats are incomplete without the scrumptious, oily, tasty and fragrant Biryani of Arsalan.
According to my knowledge, during famine in Bengal people started cooking potatoes with rice so that it could fill their stomach, helping them to struggle their hunger for a longer period of time. That tradition is still being followed by adding potatoes in kolkata style biryanis. The person who came up with this idea was a genius! I dont know how they manage to incorporate that amazing taste in the aloo (potato) of their biryani. The meat pieces are equally good in size and well cooked. The rice used is of good quality and the taste is one of a kind. 
The chicken chaap and mutton chaap are pretty good and both are too oily but all tasty things are not healthy.
However, I don't like their cheese kebabs. I love cheese, be it any kind but these kebabs are so heavily loaded with cheese that after sometime of eating these, it becomes very difficult to gulp'em down (kind of uneasy feeling inside the stomach).

I love the firnis they serve!

In all, Biryani is what has made Arsalan famous and be it anyday from Monday to Sunday this place remains jam packed. 

Totally Recommended. 
Happy eating! :D

Being the first Arsalan outlet of Calcutta, this one attracts the maximum crowd and is mostly for a quick bite or a take away. It's always in a rush so you can't think of sitting and eating leisurely. They have one unair-cinditioned (Ground Floor) and one air-conditioned (1st Floor) sitting arrangements. Prices are the same and service is quite smooth compared to the amount of people they handle. The food quality is the best at this outlet and that's what attracts so many people.

I wouldn't recommend someone going with family to this place as it's always in a rush. But for a quick break, this is perfect.

Whenever I visit Kolktata, I make it a point to visit Arsalan. If hogging Biryani makes you the happiest, the  I would strongly recommend this place. It is probably one of the best eatery that serves heavenly biryani. It has that maddeing aroma to make one crazy. Perfect blend of flavours,good quantity and the best part being that is not too rich and oily. Talking about biryani shouldn't allow me to miss writing about the super tender and delicious chicken kebabs. You shouldn't miss phirni out here. Go ahead and fill yourself

The name stands for not only good classy food but also dedicated servicing. Though I am fond of Chinese food but whenever I break the rule for I go to Arsalan. I love their biriyani, kebabs, tandoori, tikka, rezala chicken kasa, many more. On weekends we are quite used to relish our mom‚Äôs homemade delicacies, but to experience the same kind of food items in a different way one has to come to the restaurant quite often. Moghlai recipes do doubt are hugely popular in India and other sub continents. The rich gravy, masalas, mixtures of different flavours, all are simply tempting. Also a person like me who loves rice prefer to go the place again and again as they have plenty of pulao items on the platter. There is nothing like a plate full with hot kashmiri pulao or afgani pulao or steam rice. Also there are veg items which many love to devour. My personal preferences are corn in hot garlic sauce and veg dumpling hot garlic sauce. Arsalan is a champion in serving some great sea foods such as fish Manchurian, lemon steam fish, chili prawn, fish in hot garlic sauce etc. These are also my favourite.

THE undisputed king of Biryani in Kolkata.Apart from their Biryani,I love their kebabs,especially hariyali kebab and reshmi kebab *.*Chicken Rezala,Chicken Do Pyaza and chicken chanp taste really good with rumali roti or butter naan.Their firni is amazing too. Since it's quite filling and their quantity is good,around 500 to 700 would be enough for 2.P.S. their rolls are amazing too!

Best as a take away - the biriyani won't let you down - my tips go for the special biriyani else you will be disappointed with just one piece of meat (and be wanting for more) as the price difference between the two is also not significant 
And if you like meat try the Barrah kabab something you won't get easily in Kolkata

My most favourite food is Biryani, especially Kolkata Biryani. It is one of the best. This place is good and the Biryani is worth a try. A very famous one, I must say coz everyone knows about this place and it is the brand name that keeps it rocking. The Mughlai food, the Phirnis, the Chicken and the Mutton Kormas must be tried. Yum. Generally, we order it from here and have the delicacies in the comfort of our homes which is kind of a better way to have your Biryanis with the pickles and the onions and rest of the jazz ...

I've been very unsure about Biryani at Kolkata after eating a boiled potato for the first time. But last night Arsalan's "Arsalan Biryani" changed it all. Amazing flavours, well cooked mutton, good quantity, reasonable price and no rose water (for a change). It's a must try for all the Biryani lovers.

I started visiting Arsalan from 2002 - the year when it was opened. Walking distance from my college, Arsalan in 2002 used to serve the cheapest food in Park Street-Park Circus area. But the days of 30/- Biryani and 20/- Chicken Dopiyaza are gone now. Arsalan is now the most coveted Mughlaai restaurant in Kolkata with branches all over the city. The busiest of them all is the main one at Park Circus 7-point crossing - the lower level with no a/c is my favourite as I used to enjoy the oily and spicy foods with my friends fighting over dishes.

The best of the menu card is obviously the mutton biryani - the spicy rice, tender big chunk of muttona and the big potato - all blend together very well. Among the mutton dishes - Kassa, Qorma, Mutton masala, dahi mutton, pasinda, mutton kali mirch (a spicy version), mutton do piyaza, mutton rogan josh all are very good, but my favourite is the mutton champ - less bone than most of the kolkata restaurants. The mutton champ with the tawa hot roomali roti is a delicacy.

Chicken chaap, kashmiri, qorma, lahori murg, chicken boneless masala, tikka/reshmi/tandoori butter masala all are very good.

The items from tandoor are also very good - chicken boti, chicken tikka, mutton boti, mutton bara, fish tandoori all are mouth watering.

I have tried lachha paratha, butter naan, kabuli naan, keema naan, roomali roti - which are very good and goes well with the kebabs/gravy items.

One word of caution - like all mughlaai joints, all gravy items are extremely oily and spicy. So check your health graph before digging into them.

Also if you like to get a sophisticated and better presentation and better ambience, go for the outlet below the AJC Bose flyover or the one at Park Street area.

Lastly - this is hugely recommended to all my friends.

Go for it and enjoy the food !

Highly recommended for great tasting biriyani.

Only had biryanis here. Never deviated from my choice. But since it is their USP, I dont think I did anything wrong ;)
Being a telugu, i like my Biryani spicy. Arsalan's Chicken lucknowi Biryani definitely suites my palate. Full of spices and hotness, its a meal in itself and doesnt require any side dishes. One plate will leave you full and satiafied. The Dum Biryani is also good but a side dish would be needed to add more taste. Meat items are generally fresh, well cooked and juicy.
Getting a parking spot is tough as it is at the busiest sections of AJC Bose Road, so a takeaway is recommended unless you are on a bike or have come by public conveyance.
Ambience is good and it is value for money.
Recommended!!!

Food is good...but somehow I don't like the ambience here...last visited d day before Christmas.. Had to wait in the queue before being ushered upstairs... Though the a/c was working..it was tooo hot nd sultry..we had ordered arsalan spcl chicken to go with their chicken biriyani..firni wasn't there..:(..the chicken dish was well prepared and tasty..it was a bit swt nd it had pieces of fruit..prices are reasonable..a bit high..but OK..staff were courteous inspite of the huge crowd 
Con-dont visit on a day wch will draw huge crowds...made me feel I was in a marketplace.. :)

Would have surely given 4-4.5 stars if i would have been writing this a year or year and half ago..Yes their quality has been slightly on the downhill for some time..though it has definitely not deterred the crowd who throng there in masses... Yes their biryani is still one of the best in Calcutta.. My personal favourite from their Iternary would be Mutton Rogan Josh..its simply brilliant.. If their is still some poor guy who havent tasted their biryani, do so at the earliest..

The best biriyani you can find in entire Kolkata.It is a legendary place which stands still since ages and still serving the same old biriyani as it used to be.
The only problem which you might find here is the availability of seats as because it remains houseful almost all the time.

I have been going there since 2006 yet it took me some time to write a review on this. We had gone out for dinner one day. The service and the ambience was fine but the quality/taste seems to have gone down a lot. Earlier it used to be the best competing with the likes of Aminia, Shiraz, Zeeshan and other biryani joints in the city but not any more. We had taken kalmi kebab and arsalan kebab for starters and then chicken biryani and mutton lucknow biryani for the main course. Apart from the arsalan kebab(it was nice and soft), nothing really stood out. We had too much expectation on the biryani thinking that it's the same as it used to be a few years back but we were pretty much disappointed. Both the biryanis were bland in taste and had too much oil which is very unlikely for a calcutta biryani. The quantity was fine though. I'll expect them to review the tastes once again to be at par with its competitors.

Arsalan is proof that if a relatively new contender in the food scene can consistently deliver, they become a solid business favoured by patrons all over the city and beyond. But of course, Arsalan is no longer ‚Äúnew‚Äù in the city, and have established their mettle as one of the best makers of biryani in town. While growing up, I have always been partial to the stellar biryani at Shiraz, just down the road. My first visit to Arsalan was tinged with anxiety. I was afraid I‚Äôll be let down. Yet Arsalan‚Äôs mutton biryani delivered, and knocked me out with its succulent meat and generous serving size. This was a time when Shiraz‚Äôs glory was getting steadily chipped, as did its portion sizes. Arsalan came as a beacon of hope in the biryani scene. Ten years passed and I visited their outlet again recently. What impressed me most was consistency of flavours. And the meat was still fork-tender. Oh joy! Now I only wish they open up in Delhi soon.

Sorry, Shiraz, I have found love, and it‚Äôs not you this time.

We loved: Superlative mutton biryani, kebabs are damn decent too.
We shrugged: Gets crowded at all times. Find your elbow room.¬†

Went to Arsalan for dinner after having starters at Woldork, so were almost full. But the smell of authentic biriyani made us hungry as soon as we entered the place. Ordered tangri kabab (4 pcs) for the starters and mutton biriyani for the main course. The kabab was juicy, perfectly cooked and dint stay on our plates for more than a couple of mins. The chutney accompanying the kabab enhanced the taste by a couple of times. Then came the famous Arsalan mutton biriyani. Hot, tasty and a feast to the eyes/taste buds. Had a good time eating the soft bolied potato and the dum biriyani. The piece of mutton given was aptly cooked with a good mix of spices. 
After the heavy dinner came the desserts time. And when at Arsalan you need to have their firni and gajar ka halwa. Firni cool as ever with that perfect taste and hot gajar ka halwa with loads of ghee to compliment it. 
Had a good time at the place. Dont even remember how many times have i visited the place but surely gonna visit it a hundreds of time more before cholesterol kills me.

U ask anyone in kolkata about the best biriyani and they will name Arsalan somewhere at the top of their list! And then you have their biriyani and you are left with a simple question: was this the same place everyone said or I ended up at some utter wrong place? Yeah! That was how their  chicken biriyani tasted.. oily, greasy and don't ask me about the chicken! It didn't exist at all! A bony structure that was a part of a chicken's body someday was there though! I absolutely hated it.. Its so overrated! We once went during ramzan for haleem but it wasn't prepared so we tried that at Shiraz instead. But the no. Of packets and containers they were stacking up in front of the shop gave me a pretty picture of their sale of haleem during ramzan. I will give that a try this year but definitely not biriyani again

We (there were four of us) reached Arsalan at around 8:00pm on Christmas night after a long long walk from Park Street. There was a queue in front of the restaurant. We were customer number 62 in the queue.

I am a comfort loving person and always tend to avoid crowd and hustle and bustle. That‚Äôs the reason I normally tend to avoid going out during Durga Puja and all such occasions when there is a possibility of getting pushed around.

Arsalan queue moved in front of the restaurant like a 1000 foot snake which moved slowly but systematically. I have to give credit to Arsalan management for managing the festive crowd and they ensured the entire affair was systematically done. After standing in the queue for about 45 minutes, we were able to get our desired table at the AC restaurant on the first floor. For people yet to pay a visit to Arsalan, you have two sitting options ‚Äì Ground floor (non-AC) and first floor(with AC).

We took the seat and immediately placed the following order. We were all immensely hungry after the marathon walk.

Mutton Biriyani Special(2 pieces) ‚Äì Rs. 225.00/-Chicken Biriyani ‚Äì Rs. 150/-Mutton Rogan Josh(3 Pieces) ‚Äì Rs. 195/-Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala(6 pieces) ‚Äì Rs 200/-Chicken Bharta (shredded) ‚Äì Rs. 120/-

It was a short wait and then it was served. It was just pure heaven in a plate. The taste of all the items was excellent and biriyani was just out of this world. I have had multiple arguments with my friends that Arsalan Biriyani was best in the city. It was a great dinner.

I was not happy with the 'mutton arsalan kebab' preparation. While the outer layer was delicious, the mutton within was half cooked and fibrous.  It was impossible to chop it into pieces with a fork and knife. 

Rest of the preparations served were standard - rezala, chap, lahori murg. There wasn't anything special in these dishes to distinguish from those served in other famous mughlai outlets.

The biriyanis are good,though I personally feel its not the best. The place is not meant for fine dining. Both the non ac ground floor and ac 1st floor section gives crampy feel.
The gravy dishes are nice. Chicken tandoori is very good.

The food here is awesome! Come here just for the biryani and kebabs and chap. The ambience, well, it is always crowded and bustling. The space is extremely cramped, and the washrooms are always dirty. But he food here is heavenly and makes up for all that. Also, it is one of the only outlets of Arsalan where I actually get firni all the time.

Well, Arsalan is famous for it's Biriyani. Located right in front of the park sarcus 7 point this outlet remains crowded at most of the time. Their dishes have a flavour of true Mughal India.  Since I'm a Biriyani lover, so I've visited this outlet so many times. Other than Biriyani, chicken chaap and tandoor is also brilliant.

Totally in love with their chicken tikka kebabs, chicken hariyali kebabs and the chicken biriyani.  If you are in Kolkata and you haven't had the dum biriyani at arsalan, you haven't been around the city well enough. It is also famous for its lacchaa parathas, chicken chaap and firni. For those who haven't tried it yet, make it a point that you do.

Arsalan is "the ultimate place for having  BIRIYANI " as the saying goes. I have not personally been there. This review is solely based on the takeaway service and that too quite some time ago. The biriyani is really good. The aroma of the spices and the typical biriyani smell was sufficient to bring out the carnal hunger in me. The meat pieces were also succulent and tasty. No complaints about the packaging either. Looking forward to visit this place to have a great dining experience.

I feel the quality got lost because of the quantity..amania and Sanjha Chula makes better biryani. And the other attraction is Arsalan kabab which is still good.Have stopped visiting the place as I don't like their Biriyani anymore.

Many have changed but only a few have held on to their legacy. Arsalan is one of these few. Serving sumptuous Mughlai dishes for decades now , this place has attracted young and old alike. No discussion on Biriyani has ever been concluded without the mention of Arsalan.
Being a city boy and an ardent lover of Biriyani I have visited this plave a couple of times . Recently I been there with friends who aren't from Kolkata. So I promised them Kolkata's best and thankfully Arsalan didnt let me down.
The aroma that hits you at the entrance is just mesmerising. The portions per plate is quite sufficient . The Biriyanis are just pure perfection ,my personal favourite being the Lucknowi Mutton Biriyani. Arsalan also has varied options to choose from as a side dish. I personally would recommend the Murgh Makhhani , Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. Though a tad bit oily but hey, its awadhi cuisine. They have a good spread of kababs as well, Chicken Malai kabab worth the special mention.For the sweet tooth, you can try the firni.
This place is a must visit for every Biriyani lover.

Biryani with a rich blend of spices and aroma with soft juicy meat...what else one could ask for??? 
Chicken tandoori butter masala also needs a special mention. 
The manager is even Jolly and quite helpful.

Dishes tried: Biryani (probably all kinds on their menu), various chicken and mutton kebabs, other mutton and chicken gravies, Firni.

Quality: The best biryani in town. The kebabs are amazing too.

Ambience: Who cares, when you have a plate of their biryani in front of you?

Service: Really good, given the volume of orders they receive.

Pocket pinch: Quite cheap.

Verdict: Stop reading this. Go, indulge in some Arsalan biryani.

The hub for the 'Kolkata Biryani'. Although I have tried the more so called authentic ones, but this is by far the best. 
Although it is better to take away from here as sitting and dining with family won't be quite a joyous experience, but I suggest you sit there and try their mutton Galoti Kebab... You might be in for a taste bud arousing surprise.

Easy to rate. Just great.
Not the main Arsalan though on the 7 point but the one heading towards Minto Park. This is to me a better place to dine than that.

Ordered a Mutton Biriyani, Keema Nun, Tandoori Roti and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. Well the order was served quick enough and the food as always fantastic. Each. Reshmi Butter Masala was just fantastic. Buttery, soft chicken and just melts when it goes inside your mouth. Yumm! But yes i would have preferred a bit more Chicken Kema in the nun. Too less for 65rs but all in all a great experience. Arsalan always is. 

Atmosphere is very nice. Great Family experience and good ambience. Price is really affordable and the same as the other Arsalan's.

This outlet remains crowded all the time as its located right in front of the main park circus crossing..
However,this outlet is too small as compared to its park street one..i have been to both these places..although the food tastes same no doubt,this place lacks just for its ambiance and hospitality..the reason being the rush which makes the place quite unhygeinic..
Perhaps,a take away is always an option..i would suggest all to go for the park street outlet..
happy eating:)

This place was introduced to me by my friend, who is a regular visitor here. It is a stone's through away from Lady Brabourne College where she studied. We too our place in the A.C. Section upstairs, as we wanted to escape the rush & hustle downstairs. We ordered two Chicken biryani along with a Chicken Rezala and a plate of Chicken Tikka Kebab. The kebebs were just delicious and succulent. And the biryani was one of the best I have had till date. The place is neat and if you want to spend some quality time, just take the upstair seating.. Overall, had a cozy time here... A great place for biryanis & kebabs..

One of the most famous Biriyani outlets in Kolkata- Arsalan! Every Biriyani lover's favourite outlet. Not only Biriyani but they serve all kinds of Mughlai dishes. Their dishes have a flavour of true Mughal India. I have been at this place innumerable times. Never has this eatery disappointed my taste-buds. Lip-smacking kebabs, especially the Malai Kebab and Chicken Reshmi Tikka Butter Masala along with Biriyani are my favourites here. I will visit Arsalan again and again till have love of Mughlai dishes.

Came home after a long time and decided to have the biriyani at place I love since I was small. But I was throughly disappointed. The food in one word was blant. This place used to serve one of the towns best biriyani. But this afternoon left me heart broken. My biriyani plate had spoons of rice that was nothing but rice. Moreover it was served cold. The chk rezala was soo sweet that it was like having sugar syrup. The mutton chap was Jst sad. Only thing that stopped me from walking out of their was the firni which was atleast decent. So to all those who have had many a nostalgic time here be warned that those memories might be ruined.

This place has the charm of an Anthem. It's from a cauldron of tradition that 'lazeez' fare is poured out, assured Gastronomic Delight. You can't miss this place thanks to the crowds which throng here on any day. There signature dish is Biryani, chicken or mutton is your appetite. The food is served quickly once you can find your way through the succulent menu. The stone finish plates come wafting with savoury smell, mounds of rice ensconced juicy meat. The dining experience is cramped and brimming, so people who need their space please get your stuff packed. But the real joy is in the complete Arsalan experience. Such balance of tastes is a true rarity in the times we live in.

There are restaurants that serve authentic and delectable food, and then there are restaurants that simply carry forward a legacy, they are legendary. Since the day I stepped into Kolkata and mentioned Biryani in a discussion, I remember being asked, irrespective by whom or where, have you eaten at Arsalan? Today I‚Äôm glad that I did. 

Located at Park Circus, Arsenal requires no introduction whatsoever. As soon as you enter, you‚Äôre welcomed by the mouthwatering whiff of kebabs and rich Biryanis being grilled and cooked in bulk. There is a non AC seating arrangement downstairs and an air conditioned restaurant upstairs, hence enabling you to choose according to your comfort. The place is crowded all the time and if you‚Äôre looking out for a place to sit, a lill sacrifice and compromise on time is inevitable. The restaurant interiors are decent, nothing eye striking but not bad either. There‚Äôs always a hustle bustle kind of atmosphere, with people working and screaming out orders at jet speed. 

The food. Arsalan is known to serve unsurpassed Biryanis in town. How could I differ on that? It indeed serves ones of the finest Biryanis, long grains of rice; it‚Äôs not too dry nor is it loaded with excess oil or dalda . It‚Äôs just level perfectness. The quantity of rice served is ample and it goes without mentioning that their Biryanis are simply delicious, spot on. Probably due to excess hunger we ordered once each of Chicken, Mutton and Egg Biryani, and once again each of them was scrumptious. In their gravy items I loved the Murgh Makhani- a rich red gravy lip smacking chicken preparation with a dollop of cream on the top, which will compliment your bread and rice perfectly. Their kebabs are undoubtedly delicious with that splendid smoky flavor. Their service is amazingly quick, there is hardly any delay. Prices are affordable, maybe a tad more than other Biryani houses, yet totally worth it.

Like any other attraction in town, Arsalan probably is a must visit if you ever come to Kolkata. It celebrates food, rich and royal North Indian and Mughlai Cuisine. It‚Äôs one experience every foodie must have. Guess food itself, speaks so much better than words ;) Kudos!

One of kolkata's most popular destination to have lip smacking finger licking biryanis at one place and they are just great. It's one of my favorite place to go and have biriyani.¬†
Visited the place more than a few times but mostly i have taken parcel.

Ambiance: Its hip n happening as the new degenerates of kolkata would describe it, but very smelly... a person who is very hungry might become crazy...:) one would never find a little bit Shanti in here, staff are busy taking orders and delivering parcel, people are busy in finding what others have ordered and so enthusiastically eating, some staff are busy ogling at other peoples dishes...... so one might get to see the pseudo mentality of hungry people around... pun not intended...

Food: As i already said is truly delicious one may try anything and everything from the menu and won't be disappointed.. So you ya the one reading this... if you still haven't visited this place visit the place asap..

Staff: They are well behaved but one might get to meet a waiter sometime or the other who is more eager to eat the dish all by himself than to serve...Be Aware....

Service: Is very fast.. One doesn't need to wait more than 10 minutes for the complete order to reach the table... and biriyanis are served faster than a glass of lime juice... Less waiting for hungry and self proclaimed busy people...
looking for more??? i'm out of words..

Even if its a cacophony, five minutes into arsalan one would realize what the rush is all about.
Of course it's the class apart biriyani!! Be it mutton, be it chicken, biriyani there just rocks. N the best thing is its really affordable!¬†
Although the place is always humming with a constant bustle of incoming customers, the waiters are ever smiling and patient with menus ready to rumble on their tongues!!¬†
Undoubtedly the best biriyani @ kolkata!!
The firni to end the feast is the best dessert possible after the biriyani!! The firni made my day!!
A must place to visit for biriyani!!!! You don't know what your missing if you haven't been there!! :D

Arsalan
probably makes the best Mughlai dishes in Kolkata. They have 4 outlets in the
city, of which the one at Park Circus is the most popular of all. I, along with
my friends have visited the Park Circus outlet several times. It is located at
7 point and is easily accessible from other parts of the city. I have never
seen this place serene and idle any time of the year. The space inside is too cramped, so much that
we had to adjust our chairs to make way to the passing people. As usual, we
started with their signature dish, Chicken Arsalan Kabab. The cheesy piece full
of flavours simply melts in your mouth. For main course, we ordered Chicken
Bharta, Chicken Butter Masala, Paneer Kofta, Raita, Tandoori Roti and Chicken
Biryani. Except for Butter Chicken which had an excess of oil/butter,
everything was excellent, especially the Chicken Biryani. After filling
ourselves till neck, finally we held up our hands. Though we were offered
decent service this time, we had some bitter experiences before. Once they
produced the finger bowl before we finished our food. Another time, the waiter
asked for more tip when one of our friends was not courteous enough to offer
him a proper tip. But these hiccups are worth the amazing and authentic Mughlai
food they offer and they won't deter us from visiting Arsalan again.

Well this is definitely not a place to sit and have food.On entering you will get lot of smell of the garlic and onions that may cause your hunger¬†to die itself.So my suggestion is--just order parcel food from here.No doubt the best mutton biryani in town they will provide you--succulent mutton pieces along with proper biryani.---just yummy.Side dishes are also good -- kababs and murg masalam(my favorite).Parking around this place is also a bigger problem here.So better to order in home directly I guess.

A full-fledged biryani and kabab factory constantly churning out one of the tastiest biryani in the city! Nothing more to say.
Any time you visit this place, there is a tremendous buzz of staff rushing around taking orders, packing biryani and serving food. I have never seen this place enjoying an idle interval.¬†
The staff, in spite of being very busy, are friendly, patient, attentive to the guests and co-operative.
It has a typical mughlai dhaba ambience. If you want a restaurant dining experience, go to the first floor. If you want to grab a bite quickly without waiting for a table to get vacant, sit down at any of the tables in the ground floor area. One cannot reserve the table that you are eating at in the ground floor. Takeaway facility also available.¬†
Kolkata's best in class biryani and mughlai food in its price range. If you have not tried the Biryani here, you are definitely missing something!¬†

The best biriyani in the city of Kolkata is served here. I go out to eat there atleast once a month. Quality of food is excellent and so is the price.
The only flaw is the service and that too for a very understandable reason- the park circus Arsalan is always full of customers, especially post afternoon, and its not possible to serve everyone in the best possible way when you are always in a hurry. The Arsalan located close to La Marts is better in terms of hospitality and decor. Food is equally good here.
Tip: the beghbagan arsalan serves you a little extra biriyani later on, free of cost. That's what happened to me and my friends, the head chef(most probably) seeing our almost empty plates asked one of his staff to serve us a little extra biriyani! :)

The place for the best biriyani in town. Not for the weak bellied or the calorie concious. The special biriani with couple of pieces of meat,potatoes and an egg is what makes foodies run that extra mile for the indulgence. Their special ¬†kababs, layered with cheese, or their laccha paratha and mutton pasinda, or even the veg items, u choose it and will be amazed and definitely would end up overeating.
Restaurant-wise, they do have multiple outlets, but they never taste as good as the main one at Park Circus crossing. u will be lucky to manage a seat here at weekends or special days. but definitely worth the visit.
Personally i find the 1st floor Ac seating area a bit too cramped and dark. but the food more than makes it up.
Have been a regular guilt joint for me over the years.

Well, arsalan is the most renowned place in today's date. Visit their outlet today with my friend at evening but find not very crowded as usually they are. The ground floor ambiance was average, the table and the chair are too close to each other so sitting set up is not upto the mark. We ordered chicken biriyani, arsalan special kabab & firni our order of firni was the last two after that it became out of stock according to the staff assertion. The biriyani was congenial neither oily nor made of dalda like others biriyani shop. The chicken piece was also good & luscious. Now the kabab it was very very palatable cover with cheese and this kababs should be the king of all kababs due to their brilliant savour. The firni is the best without it all are futile. Prices are affordable & including all taxes.The staffs were polite. I will visit next time to arsalan for their kabab and firni.

Biriyani is good...chiken malai kabab is mouth watering...
But what I felt..sitting arrangement should be improved...nd during dinner time they were in a hurry to finish it up...taking off plates without asking..which is not expected at ARSANAL.....
There home delivery is good...nd they deliver long distances..

Heard so much about this place that I really had to go and check out this place. I would say if you are a fan of typical Kolkata-ish biryani, this is probably the best place I have come across. But in comparison with other varieties of biryani such ¬†hyderabadi, afghani, pakisthani etc, you can find much better elsewhere.
Have to say the kebabs here are amazing, especially the kakori kebabs and also loved the phirni they serve here.

The name itself is enough !Awesome biryani! The outlet at park circus remains crowded even on weekdays , you will have to  wait to get your seat but the wait is worthy ! I loved the biryani served by them. As soon as you enter the restaurant you feel hungry by the aroma ! A must visit place! :)

I have travelled to the major mecca's of biriyani in India and for me the best biriyani I have had till date is from Arsalan. Period.  Take away or dine in,this biriyani has the fulness to it and a magical touch on your taste buds that both physically and mentally transport you to a paradise of delectable gastronomical delights.

In Kolkata you want Biriyani , you go to Arsalan. 
I would love to give it a 5 but just can not because this one does not have any ambience. The place is always too crowdy. 

But ohhh those special mutton biriyani, those arsalan's special kababs - one does not really bother about the surrounding. 

Biriyani does not taste this much good elsewhere.

The best north indian restaurant. The location is on a very prominent place near park circus 7 point. I have visited this joint many times and every time i leave, i start planning for my next visit here. In my last visit, i was in a group. We took the following items
1. Chicken tandoori - deep fried and lip-smacking
2. Chicken biryani- less oily more tasty
3. Lucknowi chicken biryani- spicy with two pieces of chicken and flavoured spices
4. Hyderabadi biryani- very tasty
5. Roti.
6. Lahori murg- 3 pieces of chicken in a spicy gravy
7. Chicken butter masala- this is heavenly
8. Chicken haryali- spicy chicken in a green chatpata gravy
9. Murg makhani- the taste will strike your taste buds
10. Firni- the best desert ever. Its a must try

Biriyani! Biriyani! What else! Arsalan's Biriyani was on our to-eat list since long. First opportunity before Diwali and we jumped upon it. Ordered Chicken Tikka and Mutton Biriyani. The Tikkas were amazingly succulent and perfectly grilled.¬†
Biriyani was the cynosure for all of us. The rice was perfect, not too much in quantity, we could have with a little more. The potato and mutton were superbly fragrant. But there was no egg, no idea why!¬†
Lastly we ordered Firni as a dessert and it was by far the best I've ever had.¬†

Overall, Arsalan kept up to its reputation and didnt disappoint us. Would go back for the biriyani, definitely.

Having a biryani dish satisfying the apetite is scarce in Kolkata.. But the long queue over the saathmatha near ARSALAN describes it all... Went for the muttion biryani.. Tender meat pieces and properly cooked rice.. And simple flavouring.. No fancy shit...
Service is accountable and dishes are economical yet filling.. 
Can even try the phirni.. For people carving for their sweet tooth.. I couldn't have all of it.. The mild sweet taste trails over quite some time..

Gone there with my friend on 8th November,2014. This is for first time i have gone there physically,although i have ordered there biriyani several times earlier.
We ordered- 1 ¬†Chicken Biriyani and 1 mutton Biriyani with 1 Arasalan Special Chicken Kabab
I liked- 1) The biriyani tests great as usually. i took the mutton one, and the mutton piece was great.
2) Now the most loved one was the Special Kabab. what an item,I still can't forget the taste of the cheese layer and chicken pieces in it. Thanks for the suggestions of Zomato and the reviews.
I didn't liked- 1) Just for this i could't give 5 as rating. The service was so disgusting. We just had to wait for 10 minutes to have a look at the menu card and then another 15 minutes with continuous request for a glass of water. I have not expected from such a brand name.
But obviously i will visit there again for the food.

I'm not really sure why this restaurant is rated a 4.2. 
I tend to judge such restaurants in Calcutta on the basis of two dishes, the biryani and the chaap.
The biryani first: The rice is light, not very flavourful. Not great, but not terrible either. Things start to fall apart as I turn to the chicken; the meat is stale with clear dark marks of discolouration. Not very appetising. The mutton biryani is better. Stick to it.
So far, I'd give it a 2.0 or a 2.5. Why the 1.0?
The chaap. 
Arsalan's chaap is by some margin, the worst among the big 'Mughlai' restaurants in Calcutta. The staleness issue persists, but what does it for me is the unusual sourness that one gets with the very first bite. It's not a slight tanginess, but very in your face like someone had doused the pan in a lot of vinegar. Not just does this  block out every spice in the dish, but it is incredibly nauseating. 
Now, a lot of people love this restaurant, and I hear the kebabs are good. Perhaps this is true, but I wouldn't go back for them. Not if the biryani and chaap are anything to go by. 
If you're in the Park Circus area and you must have biryani and chaap, go to Zeeshan or Shiraz. Give this place a miss.
If you must dine at Arsalan, stick to mutton.

Thinking about biriyani Arsalan is one of the few places in Kolkata where u can get good biriyani. Visited quite a few times and to be honest had only biriyani. My last visit which was couple of months back was sort of disappointing, coz the quality of food as compared to my first few visits, was not that good for which it is actually known for. Ignoring the last visit, biriyani is great out here. Dont know why but I find the taste of biriyani is some what different here. Quantity is more than enough for a single person. Talking about ambiance, actually there is no ambiance, I find every time Arsalan is in a some kind of rush. Service is good and you can't expect a smily greeting from the waiter every time, might be because of that rush.

Park Circus‚Äôs Arsalan is a restaurant with a difference as it always offers something special. To taste the hugely popular Hyderabadi Biriyani, you don‚Äôt need to travel that long, the restaurant serves the mouth watering Hyderabadi Biriyani which I ordered last week when I went there with my office colleagues. The biriyani was simply awesome. With that we had a platter full with chicken tengri kebab and yummy mutton roast kebab. We decided to order the next one which was prawn tandoor chilli and chicken bharta. The restaurant has whopping list of soup items, so we ordered sweet corn veg soup and my other colleague preferred wanton soup veg. Both were simply yummy. Time for desert, ice cream and toffee banana were the last item to finish with. It was a complete meal no doubt. And at the end of the day we were happy as the bill was not too heavy.

Arsalan, heard this name from long back and I was eager to try it out, as I am a self proclaimed Kolkata Biriyani Lover :-)
Although I stay in Bangalore but when I went home this month, Aarsalan was on top of my try out list.
Coming to review, I was super satisfied with the Biriyani, one of the best Kolkata Biriyani I've tasted. If you decide to go there, don't experiment just have a steaming plate of Biriyani and you won't regret it.
Tried their arsalan special curry and tandoori roti also but was not that impressive.
Ambiance, there is none, it is a typical old kolkata mughlai restaurant, if u love them, you'll love this too. The polite sobriety of the waiters and sharing the table for eating, super hot serving, use of hand for eating all in all it fits my mentality for this kind of food.
All in all 4 points for the awesome Biriyani and for invoking my Nostlgia.

'Mecca' for the gluttons, especially for those who don't hesitate to indulge in some mouth watering rich mughlai delicacies. I must say, i have lived in Bangalore, mumbai etc but nothing can beat the Arsalan 'Mutton Biryani' in terms of richness and taste. Even the biryani served in the¬† much hyped 'Bademiya' of Mumbai, comes nowhere in the vicinity of Arsalan Biryani in terms of taste. The biryani may well represent a 'platter from heaven'. The tender thin rice wrapped around in an ocean of pure ghee and served with the most succulent and juiciest pieces of goat meat, which just melts in your mouth. The very mention of it, brings water in my mouth. Also along with it i would highly recommend the 'Chicken Chap' which is very filling and at the same time tasty. And there is an old saying, 'All is well that ends well', and what better way to end the meal with a bowl of the legendary mughlai desert, 'Phirni' . Overall an absolute value for money restaurant. Still remember the old school days when i used to sneak in this place for lunch often. I would recommend this place highly, specially for those who are new to Calcutta and would want to get a feel of the legendary 'Calcutta Style Biryani'.

But If you are a true biryani fan don't think of any other restaurants! I have been here 9-10 times and loved the 'arsalan special' biriyani every time. Try to go in the air-conditioned floor as the service is better there.
If you are looking for a quiet place along with Kolkata's best biryani, it's a no-no coz its full of noise and congestion. In that case just go for a take-away.
Arsalan park circus accepts meal passes.

It has out of the world delicacies, and the best are its mutton dishes of biryani, chaap etc as well as the awesome chicken kabab varieties! I am a regular customer! Keep it up arsalan!

Still haven't figured out what all the hype about this place is for. Don't get me wrong.. it is a good place. Some of the mutton kebabs are very good. Chicken ones are not bad either. But i found their flagship Biryani pretty average. Maybe it is just me, but i thought it could have more mutton, a bit more flavor, and a little less aloo (still don't understand why aloo in the first place!!). Worth a visit, but i found nothing which would keep me coming back..

As the tag suggests, Arsalan is legendary for its Biriyani. But its not just that, it also serves a great collection of kebabs and tandooris. But its the famous potato in the Biriyani that you want Arsalan is the place to be. They also have take away counters and its usually pretty queued up at night. But its authentic Kolkata Biriyani and its ambience, this is the place.

The outlet lives upto all the hype with brilliant yet light food. The biryanis were of a different   league altogether, never tasted such light yet flavourful biryanis, another showstealer was the mutton chaap, small pieces of absolute bliss. The only low point was the phirni, expected much better. Overall satisfied and blessed :D

Perhaps the most visited joint by me when it comes to Biriyani. Love every bit of the joint. Generally take 1st floor AC facility. The service is a little concern when it is crowded. The space though a little bit cramped still suffice. I love to taste the Arsalan Special Kebab. Its chicken kebabs cooked in thick layer of cheese and spices. They serve 5 in a plate. But I promise I can eat not less than 2 plates back to back. Next comes their other kebab platters which are also tasty but the special kebab stands out.
Next comes the Biriyani. I prefer the special mutton biriyani. The quantity is sufficient for one person and the rice quality is also good. The smell is typical Arsalan which itself speaks high and draws its admirers to the eatery. Along with that I love their Mutton Chaap - another specility of the outlet. Again, I can promise than I can have plate of chaap all by myself.
Not that I feel glad to share my Arsalan platter with anybody ;-)
Last but not the least is Firni, again the taste - ageless and royal.

Thumbs up Arsalan. Here I go !

A very common name for biriyani lovers in kolkata. There are several outlets of Arsalan in kolkata, but this is the best.its not about biriyani only. Dishes like mutton razala, butter chicken and mutton pasinda are delicious.

Biryani and Arsalan are synonymous with each other...Best Biryani place in Kolkata...its a bit oily but the taste will linger for a very long time...

Try Mutton Biryani and Mutton Kassa/Rezala

Take away. 
Biriyani and rezala is awesome. 
Try the firni for dessert. 
Usually a long waiting period during festivals or occasions. 

Try the park street brach for a better sit and dine experience

Undoubtedly, the best biriyani place in town. If you are out for a meal late at night, you can be assured to get food over here. There was a large queue at 2am during the puja 2014...still it got cleared pretty quickly due to their fast service. Apart from biriyani (preferably mutton), one shouldnt miss out their  special chicken arsalan kabab... U will not find anything lyk this in Kolkata...its AWESOME.

Biriyani lovers must go place is Arsalan. I cant even count how frequent I have visited different branches of this biriyani joints.
Beautifully light, aromatic , well cooked, not over-salty rice they serve..along with tender chicken /mutton pieces and well cooked potato is worthy of the saliva.
Must have dishes recommendation are for Chicken Chap, Mutton Stew and Arsalan Special cheese Kebab these are best till date.

This restaurant is very much famous for its delicious biriyani and kebabs. I like to draw attention on other Mughlai gharana food. Before few day I tried their Murg-musallam, a very sophisticated moglai dish. They did not disappoint me and we had a great dinner that night. Though they have a huge customer pressure always they try to maintain a decent service. Once again to all food lovers who have not tried Arsalan yet, JUST TRY IT.

If you are in Kolkata, this is surely a 'must be' place, even if it means an hour at the queue. This place has added to the Kolkata identity. Biriyani is definitely lip-smacking but do try out their Chaap too.

A fantastic biryani house. I have tried a lot of things here but the biryani stands out. Also the rolls of this place are sumptuous. So is the 'special arsalan kebab'. Mouth watering food. Nothing fancy about the sitting area. It's on main park circus junction so parking may be an issue. But otherwise, if you are in Calcutta, you have to eat the biryani of this place.

The most famous restaurant in Kolkata. Been there for years at every outlet. Just love their kababs (especially chicken arsalan kabab) & tandooris. They have improved their service also at least in this puja. Their speciality in muglai dishes is that it is not that heavy unlike some other joints. So if you are in mood for biriyani & kabab try this out.

Biriyani has only one name -well at least according to me and that is Arsalan! 
I have literally grown up (both length and breadth wise ) eating their biriyani! love the chicken bharta,the non veg kebab platter and their butter nuns. The place is basic and the amenities good, quite pocket friendly too. I am sure arsalan needs no introduction by me at least! Everyone should try their biriyani at least once!

Today I visited arsalan park circus and ordered mutton biriyani, mutton rezala and one mutton rogonjosh. The biriyani was somewhat o k but I am totally dismayed by rezala any roganjosh .it hardly has any mutton attached to the bone and bland useless taste even one can find good rezalaa in your local area. I will advise people to only go for biriyani .totally disappointed.

This is one place which doesn't compromise with quality. Been there many a times, last being during Pujo 2014. Even though there was a continuous influx of people (the waitlist at midnight ran upto hundreds), their service was very prompt and their famed biriyani and chanp tasted just as delightful as always. Kudos to Arsalan!

Being just a new kid in town, it's a daring job to review arsalan which is flowing through the veins of all the biriyani lovers out there.
Nevertheless, carefully here I begin:
Beautifully light, well cooked, not over-salty rice they serve..along with tender chicken pieces (m strictly no-mutton person)..the chicken chap is worthy of the saliva that u might be shedding because of it's aroma..n not to forget the good old aloo of the biriyani..perrrfect..!
However, the ambience of the outlet which is towards exide is far far better than d one right at park circus 7pt crossing..

I had heard so much about the biryani joints of Kolkata, that on my maiden trip here, I had resolved to check most of them out. First on the list was definitely Arsalan! At first, it took a while to accept a Biryani with such less masala, but then in a short while it completely grows on you. The chicken biryani here was light, aromatic and full of flavour. And more than the sole piece of chicken they serve in a plate of biryani, the solitary piece of potato was to die for! Loved every bit of the experience. 
One piece of advice - If you're hungry enough, one portion of biryani only serves one in terms of quantity, unlike joints in Mumbai and Delhi. My advice is order one per person, you're sure to wolf it down. Another little side to try would be the chicken reshmi kebab if you're not satisfied by only one piece of chicken in your serving.

food: food is superb fotlr the price you pay for. specially the biriyani and the kebabs. as of me, this is the best biriyani house in kolkata. smooth long rice, well cooked tender mutton and the oh-so-great aroma! its mouth watrering! same goea for kebabs and tandoor dishes like tikka, reschmi, hariyali kebab and chiken tandoori. however for side dishes like chaanp or bharta there is definitely room for improvement. 

ambience and service: if you would rather ear average food in a greatly decorated place arsalan is not for you. there is noise, service is, too, not up to the mark. personally i dont care if the food served is good enough.

price: price is obviously the biggest advantage for arsalan. food of this quality at this price is unbelivable.

so this is one of the best place to have biryani or kebabs( or both as is the case for me often)! a must visit for all food lovers.

I shouldn't be reviewing this. Arsalan has been Kolkata's most beloved biriyani joint. And for me, Biriyani and Arsalan are ¬†synonymous! Apart from the Biriyanis, the chicken tengri kababs, boti kabab, galoti kabab, reshmi ¬†kabab, mutton bara kababs are lip-smacking. the rezalas and quormas are heavenly. Even the rolls are delicious. The greatest thing perhaps is you won't find an overuse of dalda here.¬†The place always remains crowded and you might need to wait for a while. But it will be worth the wait, mark my words!

I'm too intimidated to even write this review ... But Arsalan defines and underlines and Highlights my Kolkata trip - Always! It's a special 'Day' itself- reserved time allotted to me and my Biryani for my Sweet atonement.
A new try this time - Chicken Cheese Kebab - such succulent pieces of chicken tikka coated in batter with whirls of cheese in between.
The Chicken Biryani and the Chicken Chaap - no comments- the BEST till Date,for me.Each morsel of rice being drenched in the flavours with those Huge pieces of Boiled Aloos - people really may have a lot to debate about and fire me about - but I stand by my words - and no point arguing - Arsalan it Is!

You walk on the streets of Park Circus around Arsalan and your senses capture the wonderful smell of kababs & biryanis. Its extremely famous in Kolkata, said to have the best Biryani.¬†

The amount is huge, alongwith chicken reshmi kabab and roasted chicken made my day. The food is within budget and highly praised.¬†

The 'cons' for me are that throughout the year its jam-packed, always crowded. The queue extends to the main road from the restaurant. Hard to get a seat in the AC chambers. Otherwise this place is superb.

This is how you should do Arsalan. Order takeaway. The mutton and chicken biryani are both worthy of repeated mention. Their mutton chap is groovy. And if you are the kind who likes a course along with a meal, get some of the seekh kabobs. I think the hariyali and bada kabobs are also good. Rent a movie, pop a soda and dig in. Finish with phirni. Its pretty kickass.

Arguably considered my many, as Kolkata's "best biriyani" restaurant, Arsalan has certainly made a name for themselves over the past few years.. The biriyani indeed tastes great, and would not go into the details of it.. However, the Mutton Lucknow Biriyani, be guarded, is extremely spicy, and tastes a lot different from the average biriyanis we have in Kolkata.. As for the biriyani again, one thing I would like to point out is the excessive amount of oil they use in their signature dish.. It's really disappointing, and hope they would look into that..
The best dish of their restaurant, their Malai Kebab, their special Chicken Kebab, is just heavenly.. Wrapped in cheese, it would melt away in your mouth and you would still yearn for more even after three helpings.. Undoubtedly the best kebab I have had in Kolkata..

I was excited to visit Kolkata n even over excited to taste authentic mughlai cuisine.  So.  The moment I stepped out from airport. I made my mind to visit Arsalan this time. Yes. I waited in the queue for 25 minutes to get a place and before ordering anything in the scorching heat of sun. I ordered for a special chicken biriyani and a chicken chanmp. It was mouthwatering. Quantity was more than sufficient. Service was also fast. But environment is not so classy. That can be neglected because once you see the huge number of people coming into the place, I bet you will surely compromise with that. Cost is appropriate. This much they deserve for this awesome test. I am definitely looking forward for another visit there to taste other dishes. One must visit Arsalan for biriyani in kolkata.

Whenever you get a chance to visit Kolkata, this is the place to be! If you like Non-vegetarian food - Arsalan has been one of the most consistent restaurants in the city.¬† I visited the restaurant during lunch on a Friday noon - it was jam-packed - there were about 18 people waiting to be seated and it took me around 45 minutes to just manage a table for two!¬† 

We managed to get¬† a seat but that is not all - I didn't quit like the idea and spacing of the interiors of the restaurant - tables are too close-by! The ambiance of the restaurant is decent if you sit downstairs, with those yellow lights but if you manage a table upstairs, you'll be welcomed with the kinetic blue lights allover, it is dark!

I began with the finest starter that is - Chicken Arsalan, essentially it is Chicken marinated in mild spices and wrapped with melted Cheese. Tasted amazingly balanced with the Jeera Raita they serve. The latter is something you'll probably find nowhere except at Arsalan's - must try!

For mains, I ordered for the very popular Chicken Biryani, made Kolkata style and I felt it was perfectly cooked, with minimal spices and the taste being absolutely balanced. Generally, Biryanis are spicy and not many of us can handle the spice, sometimes but this one here is a toned-down version of the Chicken Biryani served in Hyderabad or Lucknow!

Whenever I am in Kolkata, I will definitely visit the place again. Such joy!

Service: 3.5/5
Food: 4.2/5
Ambiance: 3/5
Value for Money: 3.5/5

I always had to wait in a queue to get in here. But is the hype and wait worth it??? Maybe if you try the splendid kebabs in their list. But the biryani, undoubtedly good, is pretty much the same as compared to other top notch places in Kolkata. I can think this centre could upgrade by somehow increasing the sitting space. It deserves the 4 because of its quick service and reasonable price.

Arsalan doesn't really need special introductions or reviews so won't write one. One of the best mutton biriyanis in town though personally I've always felt it's a little on the fatty/oily side. Beautiful aromatic biriyani though and the mutton is almost always tender. The kebabs are all delicious, especially the cheese wrapped Arsalan Special Kebabs which are simply divine!

ARSALAN - when I hear this word, no one can stop me from going there. Biriyani is the top item here and the side dishes are also mouth watering. The chicken reshmi butter masala is that good that I can taste is my dream also. 
This restaurant is heaven of Mughlai Dishes but place becomes very crowdy in the evening specially in weekends. Everyone should try Arsalan once and if you try once you will wait for the next visit.

Arsalan. A great place to be when you are in Kolkata. From the awesome Biryani to the chicken bharta, everything tastes just perfect. Had my Birthday lunch with a friend today, ordered some nice chatpata dish (kashmiri pulao, chicken bharta and murg chatpata) and they were good. The quantity is for two people and it's more than enough. But there was a slight glitch which we kind of ignored (a tiny hair was in the gravy of chicken bharta.) But all was good except this. "Satisfied" will define today's lunch perfectly.

Had heard a lot about Arsalan Park Circus and finally went in and had the Biriyani of my life. Cant beleive the other branches doesnt serve such delicious biriyani as this one. As we didnt get seats in the AC section had to¬†sit in the ground floor¬†which was over crowded.¬†We had to wait in front of others to vacate the seat so that we can get a place.¬†We ordered Chicken biriyani (not a single¬†mutton preparation was available which was a huge let down), chicken¬†tikka masala and nun. The Biriyani was just¬†delicious..¬†Its a must visit to satisfy your taste buds with some mouth watering Biriyani.

I think they they serve the best biriyani in kolkata,and the side dishes are also awesome.
The staffs are also very polite and good. serving is also very quick.

This is the main branch i.e the park circus one..though I feel the quality hs degrded ovr d past years.. still if its biriyani it has to be arsalan ! Still dis branch keeps d quality food compared to d othr branchs (to be precise the hatibagan branch,etc).. 
Wth biriyani yu cn choose chicken reshmi butter masala, chicken bharta or the rezala.. excpt dat dere is dis murg musallam ! U shld giv dat a try atleast fr once !! Dey also mke quality arsalan roll ... 
 choose anythng mughlai.. treat urself \m/ dnt forgt to treat urslf wth firni at d end..

Going to Arsalan, whenever in Kolkata for the last 7 years... But for the last 3 years, the service as well as the food went down drastically.

But had it in July'14 once again and was satisfied that, Arsalan is looking after its quality once more. Long grained flavoured rice, delectable and succulent mutton. Enjoyed.... But yet to achieve back the honor...

Arsalan as all know is now one of the best Moghlai eateries in Kolkata. On reaching the place I was greeted and seated into place by a kind dwarf man. I have tasted their Mutton Chap, Chicken Bharta, Mutton Biryani, Mutton Roll, Raandh [An exotic thali containing 8 types of kebabs and a whole mutton leg cooked in scrumptuos and mouth watering masalas which takes over an hour to cook] and all have turned out to be better than I have ever tasted elsewhere.

THEY SERVE THE BEST BUTTER NAN I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE!!!! including places from Delhi and Mumbai. Their Butter NAN is very airy and soft and has herbs which make you feel like you are having a bland pizza and who doesnt love pizza!!!!¬†The kulcha paratha was amazing as well. 

Overall an Amazing and mouth watering experience. Highly Recommended. ENJOY and thanks for Reading!

My cousins insisted on taking me to Arsalan almost as soon as we landed in Kolkata. Has to be something special that a relatively recent upstart has managed to throw a formidable challenge to venerable Kolkata institutions like Aminia, Shiraz and Royal.¬†

The biryani is lovely - perhaps not my favourite kind but really lovely and the potato does add a special dimension (carb on carb - why not :)! ). What I liked better was the rezala - delicately flavoured and a perfect accompaniment to the biryani because it didn't overpower the flavours.¬†

The upstairs seating is not bad - crowded and chaotic and definitely not a place to linger over a meal - but you'd expect that. Eat your biryani at Arsalan and later head to Afraa or Dolly's for a leisurely tea/coffee and conversation.

Have been there for quite a lot of time and every time its a new experience . the food Luke Biryani , Mutton Stu , chicken and mutton chap are just mind blowing . the mutton just blends in the mouth as soon as put in. The only reason I dint gave 5 stars just because they should not have wash basin adjacent to the eating area both on the ground and first floor and that too it not clean all the time and there is some stinzy smell in it as soon as u approach the wash basin area. Other than that its a wonderful place to be .

Beside Jugals in Park Circus is the Arsalan.
It was the oldest one.It was too crowded and so we had to wait in a long queue.
After some time , we got our table upstairs.
The place we got one of the chairs were not clean as food was dropped over it.
We told them to switch on the fan but they avoided it.
About the order they took it quickly and served it soon.
There service was good but sometimes they were too busy.
The food was good but the mutton in the mutton special biriyani was not hard and so was the the potatoes.
And we had to ask for wash bowls.
Else it was good.
The price was reasonable.

Arsalan a name that has become a legend in serving one of the best biryani in kolkata today.............  
But 
The service is nothing like the food they serve ???? it's really sad the staff is not the strength of this restaurant ???? 
Had gone there for as usual for the mouth watering yummlious biryani which no doubt I got but with that also got treated to many flies in the restaurant and the manager's reply to that what can we do if flies come as it's from outside considering it a. Ac restaurant they can't do much,  and that's not all if you go to the restaurant on a day when it's got less crowd then be sure to ask for any service atleast 2-3 times before you get it as the staff would be busy chatting withen them self's or busy on there mobile phones. 
Cleanliness is something they reallly need to work on and the staff as far as the  food ???? is concerned that's all good 
Hope to get n see better service and cleaner ambiance

If you looking to have good food in relaxed atmosphere, pls don't go to Arsalan. Tables are cramped, place is dirty. I do not know how much of it is compromise to keep cost down.

I can't give better marks than this to Arsalan. It always remains congested. Lower(downstair) dining is always hot and messy as it surrounded by it's rasoi, cash counter, wash basins, utensil table, etc. etc. Upstairs AC dining is just OK as it is a bit crampy and service is also not upto the mark. I only liked biriyani and nothing special to mention. It collapses totally in festive seasons.

to talk about this place reminds me of a lot of memories. been there uncountable times and have tried some awesome and unique recipies.
the best i love about this place are tangri kabab, arsalan special fish kebab, Murg Mussallum.

Now talking about murg musallam its writen that they need the order before 2 hrs of delivery but i had this dish there thrice and they took the order and served me in may be 40 minutes at the maximum. Now for a dish so mouth watering like this you can wait that 40 minutes. Its a worth. One suggestion on this - if they ask that will they serve pieces or the whole then always go for the whole and not pieces as the whole tastes a lot different and delicious than the pieces. 

Ambiance you cant complain about as its always busy and always full.

I love visiting this place and would continue doing so for more years to come.

Hands down the best biriyani in Calcutta.

Arsalan is a regular for me. I prefer the takeaway as standing in a queue for food is just not my thing.

The Special Chicken Biriyani is my all time favourite.
The Assorted chicken kebab platter is just droolworthy.For sides, I always prefer the spicy and absolutely delicious Kadhai Chicken. The flavour of the gravy is absolute winner!
The phirni is good but I've had better ones.
Staff is polite.I think the best part is the biriyani doesn't float in a pool of oil or dalda, the biriyani is really light.

If you talk about Biryani this is one name for sure which you will consider to be one of the best and it will always live to your expectations in terms of the Biryani and the mutton chaap.¬†

In terms of the service, its really fast. You also have the option of take away. Also tried the chicken tandoor. Truly noting special about it. I always prefer the joint on the rafi ahmed khidwai road if I am to sit and dine. My personal favorite Biryani with mutton chaap.

Being a biriyani lover it's a great experience eating in Arsalan. Me with my friends went there some days back at around 12 pm. It was full, had to wait a bit but the amazing smell was worth it. We ordered chicken tandoori and mutton biriyani. Service could be faster. The food was perfect, meat well cooked. 
Only thing that I didn't like was the atmosphere. There is too much noise and hurry. We didn't go for the upper a.c area though. Staff and services were decent. A great experience.

This version of Arsalan lacks in space primarily. Food is good but services and ambience lacks quality. As far as I heard, this being the oldest branch of Arsalan didn't really give me s legendary feeling. Service is quick only at the first serve call. But then u needa wait for them to serve again. I find this place need a renovation because other Arsalans boasts of its food plus decoration and space.
Its food is undoubtedly good as the others. No heavy taxes will incur. You may get some more items on the chef's special dish.
Talking about the price, its affordable. A biriyani, a curry and a firni wont cost you much though.
In short, from me, its a....................

The good thing about nice outlets is the native charm mixed with varied tastes which they offer. Arsalan is no different. It's quite amazing that I was recommended this beautiful place by a man standing 8 kms away from it who was guiding the traffic:Yup, you got it correct, a policeman. Upon reaching there, a sensational aroma of biryanis reached me and behold, I couldn't wait anymore. A very notable point is the fact that you could've tasted biryanis all over the world but arsalan still manages to surprise you. The spices used were very light, the condiments fine and texture can seriously drive you nuts. The kebabs were also good though you can find better ones in kolkata. The place is "okay-okay"for dine in; I'd recommend a take away.. Enjoy!!!

Wat i generally order in any Arsalan outlet is the Chicken arsalan kebab( obviously).. the melt in your mouth cheese layer outside the chicken is something BLISS for me.. The biryani and a gravy dish to go along with it to end up the meal with Firni.. I dont like the chap Arsalan serve.. It is not authentic.. Their rezala is quite good.. Dont expect a great ambience .. just go and enjoy your food!!

I have visited this outlet of Arsalan once for dine- in. We mostly opt for take always. The service is fast and efficient here. Whole ordering here, Biriyani is the most preferred option, besides the other Arsalan staples like Cheese Kebab and Mutton Chaap. I love the food here. For dine-in, I prefer the Park street outlet, as this branch seems a little cramped to me. However, the service is awesome.

This is one place where we do not mind going overboard on spices and calories. In fact we are ready to go on strict diet for days for indulging in a meal here. We have tried most dishes out here including vegetarian fares, and have never been disappointed. The only thing that we particularly are not too fond of is the firni ‚Äì not as rich and creamy as we would like it to be. But this place is not for people looking for light and low on spices meals.

Well, this has to be one of the top spots of Mughali cuisine in the city. Arsalan biriyani is not only famous with the city, but its good reputation preceeds way beyond the boundaries of the city. Personally, for me Rahmania has to be the best biriyani of the city, which is very much debatable, yet Arsalan has its perks right from the kabab to the last rice of biriyani. The food will play with your mouth and drastically would change your apetite of Mughlai cuisine. Simply a brand and a revelation of the city.....must recommended.

I have lost count of how many times I have visited Arsalaan... On a lazy afternoon when i had nothing to do or during a birthday treat or I dont know why.¬†

This is the best place to have Biryani and Tandoori food in the city.¬†

THE VERY BEST.

The biryani has never disappointed me. Neither has any of their kababs. During Ramzan, the haleem that is served is heavenly too. I don't think they can go wrong with anything. Service may be a question mark but it really does not matter when the food arrives. One of my all time favorite places to go and just eat till I drop. Love Arsalaan.. :)

Riding down the streets of Kolkata in the interesting yellow taxi and moreover an over enthusiastic chit chatting driver, I asked..him about the best place to eat around park street! He took me to park circus..and landed me to Arsalan and said..here you go with the best biryani in the city!
I was so sure that if the local has assured me of the excellent food over here..it must not be bad!
I was really hungry..and wanted some good food and ignored the interiors/ ambiance of the place! Since I am not really a mutton lover..I chose chicken biryani! This was a masterpiece! Perfectly cooked and such a nice aroma! Wow! Along with it..I took arsalan special kabab which were again sinfully delicious! Chicken garlic kabab..had a perfect taste of garlic and is a must must try!!
I have finally got a delectable food joint in the cultural capital!
I wish to try chicken burra kebab and chicken reshmi kebab too..next time..when I go there!

Thanks for giving such a **Bon appetite** feel!
Ps: the service was slow..but it was totally worth waiting!

As I am writing a review for my experience of this place, I am completely ignoring the service which is pathetic and a one hour wait time is normal. Rather than that I am concentrating on the food:
1) Chicken and Mutton Special Arsalan Kabab : Heavenly with the right amount of cheese and very very soft. Any amount of wait time is fine for this
2) Chicken Hariyali kabab : Slightly burnt and tough but much better than other places
3) Mutton Boti Kabab: Soft and succulent, extremely tasty
4) Chicken Reshmi Kabab: Good but needs to be made more soft
5) Biryani: A disappointment as the potato was totally raw and I did not expect this

Overall experience is good if you can afford to wait long hours without food :)

There are certain things in life which give¬†immense happiness.. which¬†fills one up with hope .. makes¬†one feel that the world is not that bad 1)Meeting your friends after a long time¬†2) Getting your first job 3) Getting married¬†( some might disagree :P ).... ¬†For a foodie like me , it's definitely having a Mutton Biryani @ Arsalan. There is no doubt on my mind that the Biryani¬†@ Arsalan is the best in India.. Hell I have tasted Biryani @ Hyderabad.. All I could think about is the deliciously fried potato which was totally absent¬†. Arsalan has certainly raised my standards. Enough said about the biryani, the Mutton chap is equally sumptuous & filling :)About the ambience- To be honest, its quite clumsy ,especially the Non air conditioned area- I don't think anyone complains because tasty food is guaranteed.About the price- Its very affordable and will definitely not hurt your pocket much !To all the people who have not yet visited Arsalan ( not many in Kolkata, I suppose) , you are definitely missing out on something special ! Go dig in !

Arsalan needs no introduction. 
The Biryani is amazing. 
The Cheese Kebab melts in your mouth and you relish the perfectly cooked chicken with the cheese that adds to the taste and aroma. The Mutton Stew is by far the best mutton stew I have ever had. So is the Naan. Very delicious, indeed. I really miss how they used to give a egg in the normal Biryani packet and now they don't. That is really saddening. But over all, Arsalan has the best Biryanis in town.

bunch of hungry souls went there to have lunch in a hot summer afternoon..after waiting for 15-20 mins we finally got table upstairs...the ambience was not upto the mark..so we concentrated on the food...we ordered the following..
1.CHICKEN TANGRI KABAB-it was really good
2.CHICKEN TANDOORI-tasted same as tangri kabab 
3.CHICKEN RESHMI KABAB-soft,juicy,nice
4.CHICKEN AND MUTTON BIRIYANI-it wasnt good at all,over boiled potato and under cooked chicken..and it was dark yellow in colour..weird..
5.CHICKEN RESHMI BUTTER MASALA-yum yum...it was heavenly...i was craving for more..
6.CHICKEN TIKKA BUTTER MASALA-It
 was spicy,as per my liking
7.LACCHA PARATHA-it was soft,nice

 bill was about 
1800 including vat..over all it was a good experience..:-)

I went here in the time of December last year. And this restaurant is really worth a review. This one is located near the park circus, 7 point crossing. This is a very very traffic high place. So, weekends remains houseful , specially getting a seat is really difficult in Sundays. So if you are a food lover, and want to enjoy it from the soul, prefer Mondays, ¬†The place is very highly maintained, clean & very good ambiance. The people working here is not up to the mark to get good points. The order taking, and serving times are very slow. The billing system is okay okay. Here i tried, their special mutton biriyani, Chicken arsalan kabab, and paneer kofta. They have really long menu, but this three are their special, so i ordered them. Eating everything is not possible. And rest i don't know, but this things were really cool, i mean biriyani of this level really left me satisfied, and i have went many times to take-away the biriyani again and again. I hope they do include some desserts in their menu. But yes, for the poor service, i have deducted few points, and the missing of desserts in the menu, also have to do with this.

Situated in close proximity to the Seven-Point Crossing of Park Circus, this food joint could never be of any inconvenience to any Biryani lover/connoisseur. The ground floor has no AC, but the First floor is totally air-conditioned. Quite noted for its authentic Biryani in Calcutta, the other dishes in this food joint are worth trying out. Notable among them are all the chicken and mutton kababs, the rotis and the nuns. Home Delivery is also available with this outlet.
¬†It opened around late 2002, but still today, they have maintained their authenticity and the quality of their dishes. Use of ersatz colors in biryanis here to make profit from the customers is out of practice since its inception.¬†The texture of the biryanis is entirely different from the ones one would find elsewhere. The kababs, seasoned with lime, gets enriched in taste.¬†
The staffs are well-behaved and amiable; they carry about their person a certain code of dignity. The prices are reasonable and one would never feel a pinch in their pockets. Overall, with a very high-spirited ambiance and jovial nature of the staffs, this place is definitely a one to drop in and to savour the finest items available here.

I have been eating here for 5-6 years now, and it looks like a historical event was made when one of my cousins suggested this place. By far it has been the best biriyani to me and several others. You can judge this by the amount of rush it brings on a holiday as well as a normal day dinner hours. I actually try to avoid dine over there simply because these people can push as many as 7 people to a table meant for 4 and do not have the basic courtesy for our food to finish before asking several times and almost taking away the chair of a person who went to give his pins to the billing counter (this really happened) Service is bad generally..But the Biriyani, i cant describe it in words..then there is chicken special arsalan kebab, which has a layer of cheese coating on the kebab pieces. I feel very nostalgic when I think of the times my father surprised me with a packed dinner from arsalan containing both my favourites. But after noticing for these long I must say quality is degrading, the cheese that used to is not the same now, I guess they should consider these points very carefully if they really want to stick to their position otherwise many small chains are blooming out here and there and I don't think it wont take that much of time (not a threat, a mere request)Then again if you have the opportunity of trying their keema naan it used to be quite nice coz most of the times its unavailable. though I don't really understand the concept of keeping an item on the menu list if you refuse to make it. I don't know what happened but the tandoori rotis definitely lost their softness when I visited the last time.I guess its just the Biriyani that keeps this place going..

I will not hear any argument that does not say that Arsalan has the best biriyani in all of Kolkata. Period. Perfectly spiced. Light. Super flavorful. And never ever dissappointing. I am a sucker for it and will always be. The kebabs are almost all good. But Arsalan Special Kabab....stuff of dreams!! That thick melty cheese layer around succulent reshmi kebab....awesomeness!! The mutton chap is another favorite. The paneer chili masala is a favorite among veg. I have never really tried anything Chinese here but I dnt think I need to. The biriyani says it all. Arsalan is the king. Enter the always crowded restro, order a mutton biriyani, a mutton chap, and chicken arsalan kabab and within 1 hour you leave the place with a full belly and blissful mood. What more can you want from life?

My all time favourite Arsalan for Indiian cuisine.
Till now I went there 4 to 5 times, but always had Chicken Biriyani and Phirni. I just can't get over their most yummy Biriyani dish.
Also tried though Chicken Boti Kebab ( yummy as usual ) , Mutton Rezala , Chicken Do-pyaaza and Chicken Tandoori with Tandoori Roti. Writing review also made me hungry and crave for Arsalan.
Any time I will visit Arsalan for my Biriyani dish.
Do visit there guys !

Happy eating ! :)

Visited this place few months back and its not the same anymore sadly. The quality has degraded. But anyway arsalan will always be arsalan. It will be a recommended place.

The thing to do the day after landing is to have some Kolkata Biriyani... So I duly made my way to Arsalan (because they have always been my favourite) and ordered mutton and chicken biriyani. 
Not sure whether it's my taste buds that have changed but that old familiar feeling of love/ nostalgia didn't overcome me as I ate it. The fact that the potato was raw could have been a factor... The mutton piece was tiny and a little tough too... 
I did order some haleem and rotis as well and that was quite nice. Hooray, something saved the day!

In a time long back when there were too few options to play around with in Kolkata Arsalan was "THE" place to go for biryanis...  Now we know that things have changed and with places opening up serving authentic food of every cuisine we do have better options with better seating, location and ambiance... 

all said and done Arsalan still has one of the best Biryanis in Town... but thats about it... for a vegetarian the other options in this place are not up to the mark at all... but the biryanis here are very very good... the taste is spot on and the flavor and rice quality is top notch... the only draw back is that the biryani is very greasy... which will tighten you stomach and could give you a sick feel if you do over eat just a bit...

other than that this is like a fast food joint if you do plan to sit there and eat and do get space... you get your food fast... are expected to eat faster... and pay fastest....

Recently I attented our college reunion lunch at Arsalan known for its biriyanis and kabab preparations. Things you must try out here is definitely the Mutton biriyani which is neither too rich nor oily and very authentic. The chicken tandoories are also good with sauce and salads. But the dish I liked the most was definitely the very famous Arsalan special kabab which was a common favorite. With cheese toppings and unusual softness the kabab just melts into your mouth making it a delicious experience. Ofcourse a masala cold drinks or soda would be ideal to top off all these heavy dishes. The per head cost was ‚Çπ450 for me. Recommendation would only be a more rich and spiceful biriyani. But the kababs are simply awesome.

I have been visiting Arsalan for quite sometime, each time been taken there by different people who are ardent biriyani lovers.
I quite like their biriyani, but i haven't had one in quite a while so i'm not giving a review on the famous biriyani they serve. In our recent roll-conquest, my partner and i had tasted rolls from various famous roll-servers of our roll-crazy city. Arsalan has never disappointed us the three times we tried in last couple of months.
Last week, i took a couple of chicken preparations for dinner at home - arsalan special masala and lahori murg. The arsalan masala was okay-nothing special.Lahori murg was different, sweet and creamy with big chunky pieces. My parents loved it.
Arsalan is always a safe bet when you are with people who are not much  experimental and like to stick to traditional mughlai. They do an amazing business and food they serve is tasty. The smile i see on my parents' faces each time i bring home an arsalan packet fetches an extra .5 point from me.

Best biriyani in town no doubts of that, weather it is  mutton or chicken biriyani or their spl biriyani . I have tried their side dishes like chicken chap, different kababs but they are just okay ....nothing out of the world . Briyani is the best dish of this food joint.
The ambience is average. 
Overall my opinion is that this place is only for the biriyani lovers.

Arsalan. The name itself evokes so many unknown senses within you that it's hard to comprehend. For anyone who has eaten here once, it's only time before he becomes a regular. Biryani is often referred to as the food for the Nawab, and this place keeps it just that.  Dig into the succulent kebabs,  the Chicken delicacies including the Tikka masala,  or simply devour the all time classic, Chicken Biryani. 

Right on the crossroads of the Park Circus 7 point, and many other outlets as well,  this place is what a true Calcuttan misses the most when he moves out (Personal experience!!). 

Nevertheless do go there once, to go there everytime thereafter.

the ultimate nawabi is best expressed in biryani & according to me it can be best found in this Park circus branch of Arsalan. the heavenly taste, the aroma, the nawabi flavor, the fine basmati rice, the saffron tint all infused perfectly to produce the enigmatic essence of the dish - but frankly the oil content & the spice have no restraint. the side dishes are also delicious. of the lot i liked their chicken butter masala, & chichen kashmiri which go well with mutton biryani ( & yes the biryani has to be mutton for me). the kebabs here are fantastic as is mutton reshmi kebab but there are some hot favorites of mine - some mutton dishes like dum- mutton handi, dahi mutton and bhuna mutton - i like them raw & spicy. & anyday i shall go for biryani & such dishes in Arsalan rather than any other items of Chinese, sea-food or even other north Indian dishes.

Think biriyani....think arsalan......d best place to have biriyani in kolkata.And not to forget arsalan's special kabab......its so cheesy n yummy dt u ll just melt along wd it!
Ryt from the time it started no other biriyani outlet dares to even come close to its level.
The place although deserves to be bigger than what it is.Its clumsy,a bit awkwardly low lit.
Try their haleem in the month of ramdaan.Available both in chicken and mutton varieties.But be sure to reach early cz its available till 5pm n finishes fast.
Last but not the least try their firni at d end of a meal for the exquisite end to a happy meal.

There is a saying about this place "Kolkata aaye aur Arsalan ka biriyani nahi khaye, to kya khaak Kolkata aaye" . And rightly said, I bet this place serves one of the best biriyanis in India. Located at the 7 point crossing of Park Circus, this legend welcomes you with often a takeaway queue, a ground floor with congested chairs, and small AC upper floor. Dp not expect too polished waiters or tiptop tables. But this is one of those places where you forget about ambience and just gorge on the heavenly biriyani. The kebabs, and the side dishes are also great!  The mutton lucknowi biriyani is a masterpiece. I have visited this time and again, and will do time and again!

Arsalan, without a shadow of doubt is good. But in my humble opinion it is over rated. It is good but not excellent. Their biryanis are good. The mutton special biryani and the mutton Lucknowi biryani are their best in my opinion. The chicken ones are not bad. But at some point of time they used 'less-oil' as their U.S.P. Now I doubt if they can lay claim to that. Not only are the biryanis oily, after gulping down one mouthful of biryani the top of the mouth remains coated with oil. It probably is not the best quality oil either. But this is probably expected of a place like Arsalan. The biryani is good but in my opinion not Kolkata's best. 
The kebabs are good as well.Some of my personal favourites are the chicken tikka, tengdi, garlic, kakori and the mutton boti, barra, and kakori. The best of the lot are definitely the Arsalan kebabs with cheese atop the kebabs. They just add a  different flavour to the kebabs.
The chicken kadai and the lahori chicken are really good. Both are extremely rich and spicy. The rezala is amazing. It tastes rather well and is yet quite light. The mutton rezala si good as well but they hardly ever serve good pieces. The kebabs in butter masala are good but nothing special. The mutton dahi and the mutton stew are two of my favourties in Arsalan. But the mutton rogan josh stands out. It somehow reminds me of the rogan josh which used to served in the railway canteens and Rajdhani trains quite some time back.
The lachha paratha and tandoori roti are not advised if you are taking away food otherwise go ahead and help yourself. The butter naan and the romali roti remain soft even after they get cold. And make sure you don't miss their phirni. Although the prices have increased manifolds in recent times but one can't really blame them, the value for money remains high.

Best biriyani in Kolkata, without a doubt. If you are a die hard food fan and may be ok with not so much a 5 star ambience, this is your perfect place. Any dish, be it the ever popular biriyani or the side dishes, or even the phirni, is to die for. Weekdays are a better time to go because the crowds on weekends are just too much. And who can blame them? The best food in town at affordable rates and quality service, both for the sit ins and takeaways, who will not want a taste of that experience.

Arsalan, park circus one of the most mouth watering food hubs in the city. The ambiance was pleasant and soothing. Their speciality i.e. biriyani just too good to have, it tastes really authentic and fulfilled my every single expectation. Chanp or any other side dish with this biriyani will be a great combo. We also ordered chicken reshmi butter masala and tandoori roti. Tandoori roti was very soft and sized really big and the reshmi butter masala is no less than silk, just excites your taste buds everytime you have it. Just delicious.
The hospitality also commendable. they serve dishes within 10-15 minutes, which makes you even more happier and sets you up for the rest of amazing, lucrative, mouth watering extravaganza!!!

For me the best biryanis in town! They certainly beat their competitors :) the chicken/mutton prices are soft an juicy and the rice is not oily! I'm not of a biryani person but if at all I have biryani it is arsalan! Among their kebabs my favorites are chicken garlic kebab and mutton bars kebab! They steal the show :) Though the service is quick for personal reasons I prefer taking back food home rather than eating there!

I have had the pleasure of tasting Mughlai Cuisines across many Restaurants in Kolkata, but, to me, if I had to chose one Restaurant that stands out with its Lip-smacking Delicacies, then it has to be Arsalan (Park Circus, Kolkata).
Conveniently located in 'the Heart of the City', the Restaurant is approachable from any corner of the City. Although, it has opened up many Branches, it is the Park Circus venue that dishes out the Best Biriyanis in Kolkata.
The Restaurant is divided into 2 sections: Non-AC (Ground Floor) and AC (First Floor) seating. One will find it difficult to find a seat during Rush Hours (Read: From Noon to Night) and especially on Festive occasions. However, when one does find a seat, its an Experience worth Waiting for!
To me, the Best Dish on the Menu and my most Frequent order, is the Arsalan Mutton Special Biriyani. With succulent pieces of Mutton and oodles of Taste, it will take you to a different world of Culinary Pleasure! Although all the Kebabs are good, but one should definitely try the 'Arsalan Special Kebab'! But Beware, its not for the Calorie Conscious foodies!
The Service is prompt and is taken care by Seasoned Hands, who are willing to change the mutton / chicken piece in your Biriyani, if you are not happy with it!!!!
The only drawback I can think of is maybe the Cleanliness. With hundreds of Visitors each day, hygiene, at times, takes a hit, with not so clean tables and glasses, which again can be cleaned and changed on request.
To sum it up, it is 'the Place' to go, if you want a feel of Authentic Mughlai Food!

I ‚Äòve visited the Park Street ARSALAN branch before but visited this legendary place at Park Circus for the first time on last Friday. Now environment, interior d√©cor, and service wise it is below average. Then how could this place deserve the coveted 5.0/5.0!? Because of the taste of the food made here. I think we all are ready to tolerate a bit of un-easiness to get a glimpse of excellence. After following  so many informative reviews in ZOMATO I ‚Äòd ordered a Chicken Arsalan Kebab and two Mutton Biriyani and we ‚Äòre being served after 20 minutes,
i)	Mutton Biriyani : How on earth they make the mutton so soft and the Biriyani less oily. But I‚Äòd tasted this piece of greatness before at P.Street Branch.
ii)	 Chicken Arsalan Kebab : Ohhhhhhhhhhhh !!  We were totally mesmerized. Every bit of this Kebab melted in our mouth like butter and contains heavenly taste. Take a bow ‚ÄúThe Creator‚Äù, take a bow. 10 out of 5 ÔÅä

Pocket pinch is only 693/- for 2(two) persons.

When you have heard high praise about a place for months, there is a good chance that you will find it disappointing when you finally get there. Arsalan is an exception: somehow, I have not been able to try this biriyani, even though I've been wanting to, for the last six months or so. But this week, (Wednesday the 25th of June), I finally found myself joining the throng that queues up and wait loyally while their orders get ready. I have no opinion on the seating area because we got our food packed. We had the Mutton biriyani, chicken arsalan kabab, and chicken champ. I recommend all three, sincerely and passionately. The biriyani is delicately spiced, the meats are cooked perfectly, and the masalas on their champ - finger licking worthy! This has to be one of the best biriyanis I've ever had (and I've spent considerable time in Hyderabad, Lucknow and Delhi, so I know what I'm talking about).

All most all the foodies in town  I guess have made their way to Arsalan for once,so this place needs no introduction.

We have visited their Park Street, Park Circus and Hatibagan branch and to my surprise found out the biriyanis at these three different branches tastes differently, albeit very minutely. I would rate their Hatibagan branch as the best one for ambiance and Park Circus one for the  Biryani. The aroma, the taste, the rice they use to prepare their Biriyani are all very different from the other popular joints and seriously they are class apart. Tried almost all the kebabs they offer and I found the Hariyali kebab as the best one. Talking about the side dishes, Lahori Murg is worth mentioning and rest are not exceptional. 
Overall Arsalan in my opinion, made a class of its own and offers the finest Mughlai cuisine in town.

oh ! my favorite place for mughlai and anything nawabi. one of the best selling restaurants in kolkata and is always packed with people. the straight out biriyanis and the chicken and mutton dishes are just simply nice. if you are looking for a upscale ambiance and star service this is not the place. the place is very neatly maintained and is clean from the eyes of a bystander but the place serves indian food specially the chicken rezala and kebabs almost better than star restaurants, cant grant any place better indian food than this place yet !!

Went there last Christmas and god there was a wait! But their biryani was absolutely worth it! Service is very prompt, as in we got a seat pretty soon given the snakingly long line and our order was taken and brought in a ziffy. This is not a place to enjoy the food at leisure or admire ambiance. It's to be visited for great tasting food and filling yourself without much ado. We ordered mutton biryani and we all liked it.
A must visit when in Kolkata for really good biryanis. Visit again?- Definitely!

Very frankly speaking i didn't find anything special about the biriyani of arsalan..there are way better biriyani's offered by other restaurants. I went to have a dinner with my parents in V-Day. As expected, it was too crowded. But i loved the decor. Wat fascinated me was that the biriyani was very light. N i enjoyed having such less oil consuming biriyani. :)

Arsalan is one of the best biriyani maker of kolkata. If you didn't taste their biriyani, then you don't know what is the authencity & flavor of the Kolkata's biriyani. 

The restaurant is located in the crossing of park circus, known as 7 point crossing. It's one of the busiest Road & you'll find the restaurant is always crowded. The ambiance was not good that's why I deduct 0.5 rating from my review. But who think about ambience, seating arrangements &  all that when you can have the delicious, juicy undoubtedly one of the best biriyani of kolkata. 

They served various types of biriyani out of which I find the special mutton / chicken biriyani was good in quantity & the pieces of meat was also good. It taste best. They offer various side dishes which I didn't like. For me, The biriyani alone tastes best. 
Among the starters, reshmi kebab, chicken achari kebab, mutton bara kebab are the best.  In dessert firni tastes awesome. 

Only drawback I found was the seating arrangements. The place to seat in ac room is not adequate and a little bit of crowdy.

But there are better one's in kolkata if you wanna go for kebabs. I went there last week and biriyani is always the call. But I would suggest that dining there is better than packing it for home. Because thay take way more time.

What can I say new about this place? Well nothing actually. As everyone else says the food is mouth watering and fits in budget well. Must try is Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Bara Kebab.

Pro: Fits in budget. Ample in quantity served. Quality is very good. Location is in the heart of the city.
Cons: Wait time is usually high because of the rush. Ambiance is also not that great. Its loud and messy.

Arsalan serves the best Biriyani in Kolkata and I have been here for about nth times on the pretext of any small occasion just to taste its Biriyani. Here goes my review ( Park Circus branch):
 
Ambiance= Pathetic. (Rating: 1/5)
I saw people eating Biriyani here, as if they did not eat food for the past 7 days! 365 days in a year there will be mad rush of customers. By looking at the 'serpentine' queue outside (for Take away) it seems that people are queuing up to enter into a puja pandal!  Inside, there is too much noise and chaos - too much congested and less space. 

Service= Mediocre. (Rating: 2/5)
Waiters are running here and there, look puzzled and loosing track of the orders placed. Always in a hurry and sweating badly (even in AC). They will come many times to check whether you are done or not (since there is always a huge queue) and will indirectly tell you to leave by handing over the bill much before you finished the food.

Food= Scrumptious. (Rating: 5/5)
Food is the only reason why Arsalan is so famous. It serves the best Biriyani in Kolkata. Don't have much idea about the other items because 99% people come here to have its Biriyani for which it is so famous for. Arsalan ka Biriyani is the best Biriyani that I have ever tasted in my whole life. I don't need anything else if I have Arsalan's Biriyani with Chicken Chap and Firni. It's simply finger-licking good.

Value for money= Reasonable (4/5)
The price is a bit on the higher side but still I will consider it as reasonable only because of the quality of the Biriyani and food that they serve.

Overall I rated it 5 and this is only for the 'Arsalan ka Biriyani'

Being a great biriyani lover,  i dont remember how many times i have visited Arsalan ..... infact i have lost the count long ago after 10 ...... :)
To me , they are the best biriyani makers in kolkata as of now ....... i have tasted dada-boudi biriyani, aminia, shiraz , lazeez, hanglatherium, and almost all other strong competitors  in kolkata multiple times ..... but arsalan stands out from the rest ...... i am never bored of eating biriyani here ........ they do strong justice to their brand name .......
Other than  biriyani, the next point that deserves mention here is their kebabs section specially tandoori chicken ...... often in most places u would find the tandoori pieces not being uniformly roasted ...some parts are overcooked and some are raw in a single piece of tandoori chicken ..... but here in Arsalan whenever i have ordered tandoori, i found the whole tandoori being uniformly cooked/roasted ,and never otherwise ........
The PRICE is standard i should say ...... a normal mutton biriyani would cost u approx 150-160rs ..... special biriyani around 240rs .....which is value for money compared to so many costly restuarants in the city ....... 
Other than the above mentioned points, everything else is ordinary ....... i.e the side dishes are average ....not bad not exceptional .... infact most of them very oily ..... u can see literally oil floating in the dish alongside thick gravy ........ the staff behaviour is not that good ...... place is very congested inside ...in both the AC and the nonAC sections ....... ambience is though slightly better in AC section .......

But still , its just becoz of their biriyani, i like to visit it over and over again ......

If you are in the mood to have some good quality Biryani in the city of joy, then Arsalan is the place to be.It is undoubtedly the best place for biryani according to me. (ABSOLUTE FOODGASM)  That apart, their kebabs,firni, side dishes (you name it)  EVERYTHING is just mouth watering.  The quantity is ample as well. the ambiance however could have been better. :P (NOT COMPLAINING THOUGH). It is situated at the 7 pt crossing of Park Circus and is almost impossible to ignore.  for me, 
BIRYANI = ARSALAN. :)

One of the oldest and popular mughlai restaurants in Kolkata, Arsalan, I have been an ardent fan of this place 

Went there today after returning fromAbu Dhabi after 2 years. 

Took away Mutton Biryani, Chicken and Mutton Chap. 

As usual the biryani is class apart from anywhere in the globe. It is simply heaven. 
I think Arsalan's biryani is by far, the best in the world! 

And what can I say about the legendary chaps! Ask anyone in Kolkata whether they tasted this delicacy and you will get majority answers 'yes of course'with a wide smile! 

Arsalan simply rocks!

I have even told again and again it's not for vegetarians! But I was in for a surprise when I ordered navratan korma.. Sweet yet surprisingly balanced.. A good side with the aloo biryani.. Luck now biryani though was a let down for my friends..

Waiters were RUDE 
Went to Arsalan last sunday for lunch, at d park circus branch. I agree it was a sunday and they are hugely full, we had to wait for like 15 mins.. it was okay.. also i do not need to mention that the food was really yum as always. But when it came to the service i was disappointed.. 
While taking the order once the waiter literally moved from our table to another customer.  He came back and while noting down the rest of the order he became rude and has no sign of patients or politeness on his face..one time he said 'hello' out loud rudely.. Also there were two people sitting at d next table, they were probably asked thrice if they were done with their food so they can clear the table. 
i wanted to rate Arsalan a good rating.. but m gonna subtract few numbers fe d bad service.

Come on hyderabad, beat Arsalan biryani!! Their special biryani and mutton rezala and firni is the best lunch that can happen to a foodie!! Awesome will be an understatement! 
Waiting times can be exceedingly painful if u visit at the peak hours and that added to the quite dingy sitting doesnt ensure the best of ambience!! Lately, arsalan have been opening a couple of branches across the city! Doubt if their standard will remain the same!

Very few people in Kolkata have not been to this place or atleast did not taste the food here. This place is famous for it's Biriyani. However it taste really nice. Side dishes are good too. Service has place for improvement. Car parking is sometimes a headache.

Food in Arsalan is the best. Be it Biryani or veg items, both were equally good. Though food presentation was not good it's acceptable considering the taste. They have only 1 problem that is their service. It's horrible. Waiters don't even know how to talk. They don't even serve foods properly. The ambience is not dat good either. I prefer it for take outs bt definitely not dine in.

I could not deter myself from awarding this joint a 5 star because I think even this is pretty less. Seriously had it been possible I would have awarded this one a 10 or a 100 out of 5, it is such an exquisite restaurant. Its speciality the appetite whetting, toung tickling biriyani is not just a dish. .......it is an experience. ...a piece of art made by the most erudite of artists!! Let me tell you I am not being effusive at all because whatever I say here comes right from the bottom of my. .......'tongue'......I would even take the liberty to state that it is the best mughlai restaurant in all of Bengal.....

The best biriyani in kolkata. The taste is irreversible good.  I am sure about the fact that they use animal fat in their biriyani that's okay ,if you want something that is out of the box.  Their service is good but atmosphere is just ok. You will find this place crowded even in weekdays. Cost is also reasonable.

Biryani is a very delicate dish. Untill and unless, the flavour kicks the taste buds of your tongue in an insane manner, you will not enjoy it. This is exactly what the chicken biryani at Arsalan does. The perfect blend of original Mughal recipe, tender juicy chicken and finest basmati rice makes it one hell of a masterpeice. The taste just refuses to die down from your mouth. Insanely great. Must visit for biryani lovers !!

This place serves the best biryani in town and probably the best of its kind in the country. Karim's biryani in Delhi is excellent but being at Arsalan when you have the special mutton biryani with mutton tikia, it makes me forget everything else. 

The taste of the biryani lies in the simplicity of the dish- it's rice, mutton perfectly cooked, potato and a boiled egg(I do not understand the reason for a boiled egg, unless it's just taste, then it's all fair).

Definitely I recommend this place mostly for takeaways but no calcuttan can deny the fact that a chicken roll from this joint tastes best when you have it there by the road or in the car. 
I would definitely love a valet service, for parking is mad/tight @park-circus circle and probably car service would do justice for the long wait. 

The Price is extremely reasonable.

But overall I bet no one can find me a biryani that beats this.

There are some places in India where anybody from anywhere would come and will fall in love with the culture, people and food. Food is one of the reason I would visit calcutta anyday and the kohinoor of this city comes as Arsalan. Even being veggie, I can't complain about anything here.

Its not a 5 star hotel or anything like that, a basic restaurant which knows the need of common people. You visit such place and just become a fan. I heard about Arsalan in my last trip, but didn't get chance that time and i.e. forced my group to visit this time.

So we 4 people reached there in evening time and place is overcrowded and I got to know its the everyday story, we somehow managed to find a place for 4 after a wait of 5-10 mins, ambiance not great, this one has basic sitting on ground floor and AC one on first floor, having high humid weather outside we opted for AC one. I don't know whether rates changes or not due to that. 

Ok too much info about hotel, skipping all details :), coming to food, we ordered 2 mutton and 1 egg biryani for my non-veggie frns and 1 veg biryani for me.  As i am used to south indian biryani i thought curd is a thing which always accompany briyani, but in calcutta that is not the case.

I ordered one paneer gravy and then started our dinner and let me tell you from the first bite itself, it was something else for all of us, specially non-veggies they were just licking their fingers, they serve potatos with rice and everybody liked that combination. Quantity for one person is definitely what you can eat so no complaint there as well.

Service sometimes is bit sloppy but all sins are forgettable when you get such heavenly taste.  I don't think people order anything other than biryani here as I saw biryani on all tables, thus will say a MUST try.

When it came to bill, it was just 150RS for a biryani on avg and its completely VFM for the taste and quantity they have.

Ratings:

Ambiance : 2.5
Service: 3
Taste: 5
VFM: 4.5
Overall : 4.5 (No avg here as taste compensate for everything)

Like Kolkata's Victoria Memorial, Park Street, Esplanade, Arsalan is one of the must-visits in the city. Needless to say the biriyani is the best I have ever had. With extreme foodies always crowding the place it is one of the most well regulated and the staffs are too well behaved. All of their recipes will make u go crazy, and will not hurt ur pocket too.

THE BIRIYANI JOINT of Kolkata! This our Paradise! Ask any bengali and they would love Arsalan's biryani and there is reason too! The non-dry, big mutton pieces, big aromatic, yummy and perfectly cooked aloo and the tall tall rice with aromatic flavour of what we call biriyani! You won't need any accompaniments with this. Yes, if you love the aloo, take another extra for Rs5. Their Chicken Cheese Kebab is yummylicious and a must have for cheese lovers. Try their mutton rezala too. Try their Mutton stew(nothing close to a stew though). Try their chicken chap. The pocket pinch will not even come in question after a satiable meal.This joint has everrything that makes me happy. Am sure you will be happy too.

For me, Arsalan is "the" place when you want to have quality biriyani. I have been to Arsalan quite a few times. And it's always been a pleasurable experience. During the festivities, one may have to wait for sometime to find a seat. During last puja, we had to wait nearly half-an-hour to get seats for 4.
Among the starters that Arsalan has to offer, I found Chicken Reshmi Kabab to be the best. The chicken is extremely tender and not overspiced, as Reshmi Kabab should be. 
The obvious thing to order in Arsalan is biriyani. Elsewhere, I prefer to have chicken biriyani, but when its Arsalan, I am always game for mutton. Its too good to resist. 
I like my biriyani as it is, that is, without any side dishes. However, I have tried their Chicken Chanp, which is okay. Nothing really special in there. 
The firni, that they serve for desert, is also nothing special. I have had better firni in Kolkata, and I wont recommend it, unless they have improved from what I had last.
Pocket pinch : Around 800 for two

Arsalan is one of my favourite destinations when it comes to mutton biriyani. It is absolutely not dry, the quality of rice is very nice. Tandoori roti and mutton keema is also one of the best dishes here. The Arsalan Special Kebab is just mind blowing- Chicken Kebab wrapped in Cheese which melts in your mouth completely.

As I  being from mumbai,typically biryani constitute of gravy and rice and trying out biryani at arsalan was an amazing experience.Biryani at arsalan was the rice itself with its own characteristic flavour and taste without added gravy.Potatoes in biryani is unusual but it enhanced the taste overall. Best biryani I have tasted, highly recommended for biryani and mughlai cuisine.

Whatever I say about this one wouldn't be enough. The biriyani, well, the name says it all. People may argue about Arsalan having the tag of best biriyani in Kolkata, but from me, who has had a fare share of firiyani in and out of the city, this is one of the bests, strictly talking about the park circus outlet. And yes, one thing you guys must give a try is the mutton chap, its absolutely heavenly. This is one place I keep going back to every once in a while.

Cons: But the cuisines are limited! Accommodation is less. Avoid Pujas and other festive seasons!

I go to this place quite often and also bring parcels from this restaurant. This is just emphasize on the fact that the food is really awesome if you are not worried about calories, which sadly I am. 
Now, the 3.5 rating is based on the tasty food and very good reception from my family members. The waiters are prompt and will always be there when you need them.
The only thing which I did not like is the ambiance. Its so crowdy and so chaotic. Definitely not a place where you'd like to take someone out to dine with. Its best when visiting with friends and you want mughlai dishes at a reasonable price.

How many times u have consumed their biriyani doesn't matter,this is the place where you(read I) can go everyday.Just remembering the very smell ,aroma of their Biriyani is enough to tickle your taste buds. Arsalan was,is and will be the top of the chart for their biriyani if not anything else. Their arsalan special biriyani with 2 pc of solid mutton/chicken and egg is the ultimate heaven and if you don't to leave the biriyani lonely in your stomach go for the chicken bharta or chicken butter masala.As a starter their tandoori chicken is a great option if not then kabab whichever you want. Do NOT go for their sweet lime soda,they only serve 7up with ice :P. But still arsalan's biriyani zindabad.Me hungry again while writing this,help!

Had started eating biryani in south india and my taste buds are so accustomed to the taste of hyderabadi style of biryani that I can't the sweet biryani.
Since I had heard from everyone Arsalan serves the best biryani in the city so decided to have my first taste of kolkata style here. The ambience not so special (sat in the AC dining hall) and decently lighted. Over to the much hyped biryani and I asked the waiter to serve the best (arsalan special) and was suprised we had to order raitha separately since in bangalore & hyderabad they serve it for free.

The biryani looked and smelled good but the chicken piece looked like polio stricken and had a lot ghee in the biryani. The biryani had a huge piece of potato and a boiled along which even though I was aware but never liked a potato in biryani. My taste buds got the first taste of sweetness only all throughout I ate the biryani and couldn't finish the entire plate.

Only advice to people used to hyderabadi style is be prepared for a sweet biryani and lack of garam masala in the biryani and no baigan gravy you get in south india. 

Overall not a bad place for biryani but my search continues for the spicy hyderabadi biryani in the city of joy.

Ahh...mahnn! wat can i say about this place ! People who come over here should not look for comfort and ambience and all. The Biriyani over here is just heaven, undoubtedly the best in Kolkata and may even give similar restaurants in Hyderabad a run for their money. Though I dont find Hyderabadi Biriyani not happening enough. So keeping that dish out of the picture, this place is the best if you have around 400 bucks in your pocket and if you have a Biriyanifying stomach at any point of the day. ;) The side dishes are also mouth watering and all at a very reasonable rate. Dessrts over here doesnt make much sense to people. It only refers to Firnee which I dont find happening enough in comparison to a Kwality walls product, may it be a Cornetto Double Chocolate. ;)

I could keep having biriyani from this particular Arsalan joint for days irrespective of how fat I become. Yes. I love it that much. The fragrance the biriyani has cannot be described in words. Let your taste buds feel it. The chicken and the potato chunk in the hot biriyani takes on its flavour and becomes irresistibly tempting. Also the chicken chap is something that you have to try from here. The restaurant is always full and crowded for the very obvious reasons and if you expect the parameters of cleanliness to be top notch then you will be put off. But the great food will more than make up for it. Oh yes, never forget to have their firni whenever you visit.

Since I am ardent fan of arsalan I always end up taking parcels from here .. Have never actually had dinner over here so can't comment much on the ambiance.. There are two sections the above one I guess is the family section with AC , we get parcels from the base section which is not AC and it's nothing great to talk about .. The main thing which is worth talking is the food of arsalan and to be more specific the biryani and kosha ... They never make us wait also please us by giving the chicken piece of our choice.. Thumbs up to the food and all the rating is only based on the taste ..

arsalan offers the BEST biriyani in the town. period. you just order their special mutton biriyani and spend a blissful next 10mins to gulp it down. add to it chicken kakori kebab and mutton pasinda and you are ready with the best dinner ever. the mutton pieces in biriyani were big but very well cooked. kakori kebab is tasty and mutton pasinda goes well with the mutton biriyani. the pasinda was very rich and spicy and i felt was a bit higher on the oil side. end your dinner with firni and then take a deep breath burp heavily :)
the waiters are friendly and food comes to your table very quickly after the order. overall, if you are a biriyani lover, arsalan is a must visit for you.

Having been there many time, its the best moglai cuisine in my mind.
Lower section is a bit shabby n swarming with people Bt upper section is much better with ac
They make the best biryani in town, fluffy flavourful rice, mutton is juicy n soft enough to curve it with spoon.
Their signature dish must be the arsalan special kebab. Its a must have. The kebabs are wrapped in molten cheese, the best comfort food i have had..
A big up from me!

Pretty famous for its biryani dishes, it is a very crowded restaurant now-a-days. The last time I went there(Jan 2013), I had to wait for 40 minutes in a long queue! The guys who were handling the crowd were really unprofessional. So, that was not a good experience at all.

But, if you visit this place at off-peak hours, you may be surprised by what it offers as far as treating the guests is concerned. Not like a genuinely good restaurant like Peter Cat, but still good enough.

Well, speaking about the dishes, Arsalan is one of the best restaurants in the city of joy that serves really good quality biryani. I have tried a few other dishes here, like Chicken Tikka Kabab or the Paneer Tikka Butter Masala. But none will beat the biryanis.

Although the meat used by them is always chewy, their biryani is still petty good....murgh makhani, chicken chaap (very little gravy though) and chicken rezala are good accompaniments to the biryani and their chicken tangdi is also good for starters

Undoubtedly the best biriyani in kolkata. I actually love mughlai biriyani ( awadhi style) more than the hyderabadi one... So may be a little biased, but that's what it is. Love the place.

This place started of very nice i was raised eating Biryani's and Arsalan was one of them but this place is being over- hyped now a days you might find hair or cockroaches sometimes in the food so be careful ... the food taste is average unlike earlier times ...

====MOST DETAILED REVIEWS====================================
Personally I visit this place more often than any other restaurant ; probably because my college is in the intimate vicinity and obviously because I am a hardcore biriyani lover. Okay its situated in the Park Circus 7 Point Crossing and most of us know that this is Sourav Ganguly's Fav Biriyani House. 

FOODS:
Only Mughlai & North Indian.
PRO- 1) The best biriyani in Kolkata. It doesn't need anyone's approval. Quantity is sufficient. Side dishes are appreciable. But all of them are quite rich and buttery. 
2) Kebabs are yummy, quite soft. And other side dishes are killer too. Ch. Reshmi Butter Masala and Ch. Tikka Butter Masala are highly recommended. 
3) Firni Is killer one here.
4) Though Zomato is writing that they sell Chinese Dishes. but I never saw any of them in Park Circus Arsalan. Even if it is available -it will not be that good, I guess.
5) Huge variations of choices in menu is available.
5) In the Take Away portion it sells Roll. Chicken Rolls are just Mind blowing. Soft and juicy. Oh yeah!! 

CON- This Restro remains busy all the time so sometimes it may take a lil longer time in case you are in the take away portion.
{rating: 5/5}

SERVICE:
PRO: All the stuffs are okay. Food is served at an affordable time gap in most of the cases.

CON: They don't have Car (4 wheeler parking area) or a waiting lounge. You have to wait outside. In the time of occasion (ex. Durga Puja, Christmas) they seem to hire inexperienced stuffs who really can irritate you at times. And in these days getting a seat can be a real pain in the rear end. 
. {rating: 3/5}

AMBIANCE:
PRO: Well, ambiance, illumination and the decoration are not up to mark. Its good for hardcore mughlai (Say Biriyani) lovers. It has a Non AC ground floor (Cheaper in terms of price.) And a AC upper floor (Costlier, Obviously). It has also a Take Away Portion in front. 

CON: All the tables have lesser gaps. Your private discussion, if any has to be done will be hampered for sure. Every time it remains congested. For family outing, Dating or romanticism-mongers- this place is not good at all. They should go to the Park Street (Beside AJC bose Flyover) Arsalan. . 
{rating: 2/5}

PRICE: Price is good. Pricing seems nice to me; if it strikes u- its because you are in Central Kolkata, it has to be this much pricey. CLUB SOLITAIRE CARD ACCEPTED with 15% rebate, only in this outlet.
{Rating: 4.0/5}

Nearby Alternative:
Arsalan Park Street (Best For Party Banquet, Family Gatherings, Date, outings etc ) in this range of price and area. 
Shiraz Park Street

ENJOY.
Happy Bengali New Year.

I can easily say that Arsalan is where I have had the best biriyani of my life so far. The taste is exquisite, the price is sufficiently cheap and the location easy to reach. The Rotis and Kebabs along with the Biriyani are the best in my opinion. Definitely a must try

This is perhaps the best outlet of Arsalan in the city. The mughlai cuisine served here is totally out of the world experience and hence is the demand of its cooked dishes which is evident by the large crowd waiting in queues for their turn for take aways and dining in. True value for money cuz the dishes served here have a sizeable portion in each serving which can serve more tham one person. Whenever I am at this restaurant (mostly during lunch hours) I always order a special mutton Biryani (contains extra rice and meat) and a mutton chaap, afyer eati g such a gigantic and heavy meal, i never feel hungry till the next 12 hours!!! Not to mention the taste, after having it, you dont feel like tasting anything else. The after taste lasts for nearly 3 hours atleast. If one tries the cuisine here, one can never feel disappointed with the food. The only downside of this restaurant is its ambience. Tables are kept very near to each other due to huge space crunch. Hence during peak hours of the day, one may not expect a comfortable sitting arrangement in its lounge for dining in. But that is supplemented by the hospitality of the waiters, thorough gentleman attitude in each of them. Only the crowded space and stuffiness in the air at its restaurant lounge is the negative point of this outlet, otherwise a great place to eat!!!
.
Edit date 1st dec 2017:
The restaurant have become very very pricey. A portion of special biryani now costs over 300 and a portion of side dish costs 200. Add taxes to it and you will be shelling over 520 per head. Aroma of the food isnt as strong as it used to be and each portion of the dishes have shrunk. Though it continues to be the best biryani outlet, its decline in quality have taken me aback.

Ok, The best place for biriyani - Chicken or Mutton doesn't matter. Both are equally good.
Ground floor  is non-AC, 1st floor is AC. 

Been there 30+ times, and its like a temple. Though biriyani is good enough to eat, you can try out mutton pasinda with it.

Doesn't matter. Just biriyani. 
Enjoy !

I can safely say this place provides the best Biriyani :) . I might be a bit partial for this place because Biriyani is my favourite dish.  I visited this place to celebrate one my friends birthday.  We stated with the Chicken Arsalan Kebab and chicken Hariyali Kebab both was great. Then came Mutton Biriyani with Murgh Makhani and Kadai murgh which I enjoyed immensely. 

The waiters are really nice always looking to help you and they served the food pretty quick. We all enjoyed the food. In the dessert firini was the defacto choice.  Some of my friends took the fish tandoori also which according to them was pretty awesome.  If you are a Biriyani fan like me visit this place .

I don't understand why there is such a hype for this place. I have gone to this restaurant a couple of times and I am not too fond of it. The place is tacky and the food is average. 
The biryani is just like you would taste in other restaurants, but with lesser oil. The tandoori rotis are great, soft and big. Chicken dishes are pretty decent, but they make up for the less oil in biryani with these dishes. 
But for a place as famous as this, you can definitely give it a try.

Arsalan serves Kolkata's best biriyani and also, other mughlai cuisines within affordable price. I just love the flavour of biriyani and their tongue-tickling kababs. Yesterday, for the first time, we tried out Arsalan Special Kabab, which was superb. Hariyali Kabab was also good and my favourite. Besides these, I liked Chicken Reshmi Butter masala and impressed by the quantity :). The Firni is okay.

The best biriyani in Kolkata, hands down. There cannot be any debate on this topic. 

The only 'iffy' thing with this place is the long waiting queue with no fault of the restaurant's. Though the place has adequate arrangements for seating, there is still a long queue even during afternoon hours. 

Interiors have that old world charm with cream walls and dark wood furniture and doors. Service is really fast. You wont be made to wait long after you place your order, the most popular being mutton biriyani which is an absolute delight teamed with chicken chaanp. Finish it off with their Firni and you will return home a satisfied man :D

Arsalan has been a big name in Kolkata's biriyani scenario.Truly speaking I dont agree much.Arsalan gives you a Kolkata style Lucknowi biriyani with a huge chicken and an alu accompanied with an egg.Good part is that rice strands do not stick to each other and meat is tender. The rice is less oily (has to do more with cutting down of costs rather than trying to serve healthy food to customers).
My disappointment is that I find the rice to be very bland ...some white dry portion and some yellow greasy portion...Biriyani is all about flavours which are missing and rice in not in homogenous state.

Good food for a change. The biryani is good but the fear factor that comes in place is the usage of excess oil and dalda. Staff seems grumpy at times with a carefree attitude to follow (noticed this in the park circus outlet only). The dish that really packs a punch is the Chicken arsalan kebab, this one's just mind blowing. I don't care much oil they use in other dishes but I'm definitely coming back for this particular dish

BEHAVIOR: The guy who had taken our order( the old one in suite) ,, his behavior is not good,,  He is not ready to repeat the description of the menu,  about which u want to know something..
NEGETIVE POINT: The place is too small & that's the reason, if restaurant is full,, u are bound to wait for some time at outside of the restaurant..

Location : At Park Circus itself

Ambiance : Above average decor. Nothing exceptional. Service average.

Food : First of all ordered the chicken Biriyani to extinguish the hunger then the Hariyali Butter Masala followed suit along with Naan and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. It's amazing to see how they are so dedicated to the quality of food being served. Each of the Outlets has this one thing in common : Consistency. The chicken dishes were moist and tender. Just falls apart in your mouth every time. Even the naan  was praiseworthy. Soft and aromatic to be precise. After all this carnage, the apple of my eye arrived : " Chicken Arsalan Kebab". This is a dish that I never fail to order irrespective of everything. We took it apart slowly and relished the cheesy , heavenly concoction. We were so immersed that forgot to click it's pic :P ! After all this was stuffed enough to order some Thumbs up !! All in all a great day as always. 

TIP : Be there by 11 AM or after 3 PM ! Otherwise prepare to stand in a queue in this blistering heat ! This is no doubt the most in demand outlet of Arsalan there is ! Although Arsalan devotees know this but still if you're looking to order the "Chicken Arsalan Kebab" do so while consuming your first dish because it takes half an hour to prepare and gets to you piping hot !!

Final conclusion : Not as fancy as their Park street outlet but more importantly the food is bang on here as well. At a cost for 2 of about 800/- plus it may not be the cheapest but sure is worth every last rupee . Satisfaction guranteed.

Arsalan.. best known for biriyani and mughlai dishes..visited few days back.. and it was a mixed bag of experience.. ordered the chicken reshmi kabab as starter. And then we had one plate of hyderabadi biriyani and the famous chicken reshmi butter masala as side dish.. the biriyani was great if not the best in this town.. and the other two dishes were awesome as well. The amount of biriyani was huge, enough for two people. But we made an error of judjement and ordered a couple of tandoori roti, finally ended up with unfinished plates and nearly bursting tummy.. but the worst part is ambience.. had to wait for some times and managed two seats sharing the same table with 4 others that too in ground floor which was non a.c. the place is severely congested and has lack of hospitality.. surely not the place of choice if you want some comfort while eating.. just 1 in 5 for ambience.. but the circus avenue centre of arsalan that i visited last time was way better.

The best of Mughlai cuisine in Kolkata. However, the restaurant is extremely crowded throuout the year. You may not like the congested settings.

Moghal food at its best in kolkata ....The biriyani we had was just fantastic.
Points to be noted :
1.The rice used is of superior quality
2. The aroma is just perfect, neither very strong nor very light
3.While havong the biriyani it did not seem that too much of oil/ghee had been used - but yet the taste was awesome
4. The chicken was soft and tender 
5. One negative is that the potato given was too big ...just too big
We also had Mutton rezala - Even  this dish was very nice 
Overall super duper food!

This place has to be the most talked one for biryani lovers. If you haven't tasted their cheese kebab and biryani then you don't know what you are missing. 

Their kebabs are just mouth watering and they melt in your mouth. 

Even though the ambience needs to be worked on, diners usually don't mind as they too busy with their food. I personally prefer visiting the freeschool st one for dining. 5stars are totally on their delicious food and quick service.

Yummy is an understatement. They launched and took the business right away from Shiraz and Rahamania in early 2000. The mutton in the biryani has become a lil tough over the years but the rice and the aloo is simply to die for. Always order for a mutton special(2 mutton boti) biryani with masala chawal. Masala chawal is what they call the juicy chawal from the bottom layer of the handi. You can also try out galauti kebab, mutton chnap, pasinda, mutton stew, and chicken rezala.

Today I had an order of 11 Mutton Biriyani, 5 Chicken Biriyani, 1 Egg Biriyani, 7 Mutton Stew, 1 Chicken Lahori and 1 Paneer TIkka Masala. They delivered the order about half an hour late from the given time and the biggest blunder they did was that instead of 7 plates of Mutton Stew the delivery boy gave us 7 plates of special Biriyani apart from the fact that the bill he was holding in his hand had properly written in  simple English language that we want 7 Mutton Stew.

Such a big blunder for a serious corporate order has imposed a very wrong picture on the minds of my colleagues. It shows that only giving good taste is not enough, a good delivery system and responsible workers are also necessary for Arsalan to stand out in today's commercialized market.

Place is too small compared to its demand.. nevertheless when the food is so tasty,everything else can be ignored..

It was our first visit to Kolkata. 6 of us had gone there to attend a college friend's wedding. We were told by a lot of KOlkata people not to miss eating at Arsalan. So we went here for lunch. 

Ambience wise, it is a normal restaurant. We were too hungry, so we ordered 2 chicken tandoori butter masala, one prawn curry, one fish curry, 2 mutton biryani , 2 chicken biryani ... One more chicken curry ( i dont remember the names ) and breads. 

Honestly that was one of the best food I have ever had, specially chicken tandoori butter masala. Perfect amount of spices...Everything was perfectly cooked. Really good quantity and that too at a very reasonable price. 6 of us ate like mads and still the bill was just 2100. 

All in all, a memorable experience. Will definitely recommend this place to all my friends.

I went there for my friends bday party she insisted we go at a specific time of the day otherwise the place would be packed...
Boy was she right by the time we were done i could see the empty place where we stood crowded with people
The waiters were very indifferent if nt reluctant to pay us any heed 
I was asking for a knife for the cake and it took me four times before they were finally able to produce the thing 
They didnt even take away the box of the cake when they took the startrers plates... boy was a angry 
But arsalan lived up to its reputation as one of the capital resturants of kolkata in terms of quality and that kinda calmed me down :-D
We orderd two starters 
Chicken reshmi kebab 
Chicken tengri kebab
Like other places the reshmi kebab was flavorless in the inside and now im nt sure if thats a resturants fault or thats how the recipe is meant to be..
But the tengri kebab was a delight juicy well spiced  all in all magnificent 
We ordered butter naan and chicken butter masala, chicken do pyaza, mutton biryani one salad (which was disappointing Btw)
The thing i liked about the biryani is that all the grains are so properly cooked not over cooked not under cooked not sticky and not broken 
The prices are bearable as much you can afford to pay  for a tasty meal
And the biryani didnot reek of the mitha aantar smell which i really hate if it does it was light not heavily spiced and the meat was well cooked i alwayd adore the biryani potato lol
The chicken preparations were also good though i have serious doubr if they can pull that off with their veg dishes (i have noticed muughal restaurants are not good with their veg dishes )
All that being said i wont mind visiting arsalan again though not that eager coz of the rude waiters and similar tasting dishes 
No variety in flavour
But i guess biryani lovers will find heaven here

Arsalan is the king in taste. When it comes to tandoori specials and delicious biriyanis in Kolkata, Arsalan is the first name that comes to my mind. But the huge problem with arsalan is the seating arrangement and behavior. If it is bit crowded the workers start behaving bad, real bad. The food is tasty no doubt but it is very very oily. I don't know what the put in the dishes but it is too much oily which might turn out to be bad for you if you have a weak stomach. All over experience was kind of Ok. I would not think of going to Arsalan again and again.

Love the mutton biriyani special. Unlike other places, here the meat is very soft and juicy and easily digestable!
Absolutely Loved the MURGH CHATPATA !! It was absolutely succulent. 
Keema naan and Chicken achari butter masala is a super hit combo!!
And last but not the least, every dinner/lunch with my friends ends with FIRNI.

The origin of the Mughlai cuisine can be traced back to the times of the Mughal Empire. The Mughals, who invaded India in the 16th century, brought with them a treasure trove of aromatic and exotic spices, herbs and nuts that were used to prepare mouth watering dishes. The natives were predominately influenced by the Mughlai cooking and got to learn new techniques of cooking. The spices and nuts used in the preparation of Mughlai dishes made food lip smacking and enticing. It was long time back. But Mughlai cuisine is still our favourite. How often my heart craves for a plateful of biryani, chicken tandoori or succulent kebabs! And whenever I crave for the flavour of exotic spices, I head straight to Arsalan.

Arsalan is known for its style and splendour in cooking. The appropriate use of aromatic spices makes food truly delectable.  Chicken biryani, mutton kasha, mutton rogan josh, chicken rezala, chicken korma, chicken hariyali, chicken boti kebab, chicken tangri kebab and chicken malai kebab are some of the exotic dishes served at Arsalan.  The soft and succulent meat pieces and the biryani, prepared from long-grained rice are so delicious! The best part is food is neither rich, nor oily so you can enjoy your fill anytime. 

Seating can be a big problem at Arsalan, especially if you are visiting the Park Circus outlet. The place is too crammed up. But you can always carry your food home.  All Arsalan outlets are over crowded during the festive season with foodies craving for more and more exotic cuisine. However, you can drop in anytime to enjoy some lip smacking food.

Last night I visited this place and it was a complete letdown.

We went there after a long day. Having been eating nothing but Biriyani and Kebabs here previously, we thought to try some other dishes. But it seemed that the staff was not even interested in taking our order so much so that we had to call someone just to get the menu. Then when we asked the waiter for some suggestion about what we should try he simply said one or two names reluctantly and went on his way.

At last we decided to go for 2 Tandoori Rotis, 1 Chicken Boneless Masala and 1 Mutton Biriyani. Surprisingly, the order came through as 2 Tandoori Rotis and 1 Butter Nan accompanied by the Boneless Chicken Masala- 1 Nan too many. We told them that we didn't order the Nan and then only they took it back.

After finishing the Tandoori Rotis we were waiting for the Biriyani. And again another surprise- Our order for Mutton Biriyani simply didn't reach the kitchen. The waiter just ignored it somehow. They took our order separately for the Biriyani and served it.

One notable thing is that when they understood that our order was not conveyed to the kitchen correctly the waiter did get a bit of criticism, if not scolding, from the other staffs (We were not able to make out what exactly were spoken). But I really doubt if that's gonna have a long-term effect.

When it comes to the quality of the food, it was great. I haven't got such nice Tandoori Rotis in Kolkata for quite some time now. They were fresh out of the oven as opposed to the "Cooked-long-ago-and-heated-on-oven-before-serving" type we generally encounter in the city. The Boneless Chicken was also awesome. Spicy Boneless Chicken pieces surrounded by a thick gravy and topped off by Fresh Cream- only a handful of restaurants can compete against this superb delicacy.

And the Mutton Biriyani was also another great produce of Arsalan Kitchen. The texture, the flavor- nothing to complain.

Then came the bill and yet another surprise. They have charged us for even the Butter Nan we didn't order and later returned. Again we informed them of it and they promptly struck off the item from the bill. We paid and came back.

At the end, I reckon it was a good decision for us to try dishes other than Biriyanis and Kebabs here. The Tandoori Roti and Boneless Chicken Masala filled up my mind as much as my stomach. Their Biriyani was, is and hopefully remain as Kolkata's one of the best, if not THE Best. I thought of upgrading them due to their expertise in dishes other than their traditional strong points.

But unfortunately, the service actually compelled me to downgrade them a bit. A restaurant of such promises that Arsalan holds can not excel much with this kind of service. Yesterday they were severely understaffed which is becoming a common trade here day by day. Separate people to take the order and serving the food can easily create misunderstandings like what happened with us. The waiters also need to be warm. Customers do not mind to repeat their orders and but they become a lot disapproving toward the restaurant to receive the wrong food. Now that their food is really gaining attention from a lot of people, Arsalan management need to focus on the service sector more. It's for them to decide if they want to be in the long run or fall from grace rather quickly and become merely another milestone in the history of Kolkata Eateries.



----- 21 Jan, 2014 -----

Third time here and I understood the secret of being here and get amazed- I am not going to  try their Mutton dishes again, ever.

My friends ordered a Mutton Biriyani and I decided to taste their Mutton Tikka Kebab. As usual, the biriyani was great, nothing to say in that sector. Service was good and the ambiance was also great this time.

However, the mutton pieces were hard. Even cutting them with teeth required a great deal of effort. The Kebabs had the right spices in the right amount but it was all in vain since the mutton pieces were not even nearly chew-able.

On the other hand, the Firni was great, I must admit.

Basically, except for the mutton pieces, it was a great experience. But the Mutton made it a complete disaster.



----- 14 Jan, 2014 -----

So, I visited this place once again but this time I am somewhat disappointed.

As soon as we got there, we noticed a number of people waiting outside. Fortunately, a two-seated table emptied quickly and we were led to the Air Conditioned 1st floor. The lighting, decoration and the furnishing was nice and soothing but it was a bit crowded. Felt like they put a table wherever they could. Customers as well as the Waiters faced problem moving around. But once one settles down, it was all good.

When we ordered Lucknow Biriyani, the waiter, for some unknown reasons, tried to discourage us by telling it was oily, spicy etc. At last we ordered a Special Mutton Biriyani and one plate of Kakori Kebabs.

The Biriyani came fast enough but somehow they did not even think about serving it on our plates. We had to take it up by spoon from the center plate.

But it is Arsalan and there is no need to tell how it was. Arsalan never felt to mesmerize with their Biriyanis. Be it the spices, the cooking or the oiliness, Arsalan produces one of Kolkata's best Biriyanis, time and again. On the other hand, the mutton pieces were a bit disappoint today. They were tender to chew, of course, but hard to cut down to small pieces before eating. Beyond that, it was all nice and great. The quantity and quality of the Biriyani easily made us forgive the little shortcoming of the mutton.

The Kebabs were a whole different story. I have heard great things about Arsalan's Kakori Kebabs so I thought to give it a try today. They took a long time to serve this dish (it arrived even long after we finished our biriyani) and it tasted like nothing that can be expected from Arsalan. In simple language, I did not like it. It tasted like cardamon in each bite. There was no tingling effect that is expected in Kebabs. It was a total disaster.

However, at the end, there is only one thing to say. Whatever shortcomings Arsalan may have, their Biriyani is reason enough to take me back there anytime.



----- 09 Mar, 2013 -----

Today i went to this place with my girlfriend and it was again proved that Arsalan IS Kolkata's best biriyani joint.

It's a little place but nice and cozy. I heard that the waiters are a bit rude but my experience was entirely different. We ordered one plate each of Lucknowi Biriyani and Reshmi Kabab. The service was pretty quick and they divided it equally and served to both of us even before asking them to do so.

At first I thought the price was a bit over rated, but had to change my opinion as soon as I saw the quantity. I mean, for two persons, it's cheaper than most local restaurants in Kolkata and suburbs.

And as for the quaIity, all I can say is that I have had the oportunity to taste real Lucknowi Biriyani at Lucknow itself and this was the first time I got that authentic taste in Kolkata.

The kabab was better than most of Kolkata restaurants but still it was not as good as the Biriyani. In my opinion, they should give a bit more attention to that section. Of course, it was unfortunate for me that the Kakori kababs were not available at that time.

All in all, a pretty good experience for the both of us. THUMBS UP.

I went there in the month of November last year...
 It was a farewell treat from my office colleagues as I was leaving Kolkata.
As soon as we reached there we went upstairs to the AC restaurant. 
The ambiance looks very ordinary with lots of noise and overcrowded. We were 6 people and the waiter accommodate us in a 4 seated table transformed to a 6 seated table ...so one can well understand how we managed to seat there. 

We ordered chicken malai kebab...followed by mutton and chicken biriyani. One of my friend ordered lachcha paratha and mutton kasha.... The kebabs are good in taste teamed with curd and mint sauce and salad (consist of only onion slices). 
Next came the biriyani. the quantity is huge and it tastes awesome. We could spare the ambience for the taste.
Lachcha paratha is very oily and mutton kasha very spicy....but tastes good.

I had huge expectations regarding the ambience which was quite dissapointing....but there food specially Biriyani are just mind blowing... But they should do something with the place...atleast the AC part.

I would rather prefer Take away than sitting there having the food.

1 st time went to taste their famous biriyani and it was a pleasant experience. I ordered for special muttorn biriyani (200/-) along with mixed raita. Service was a bit slow,had to wait for around half an hour. Biriyani was fantastic, long, well prepared rice with 2 pieces of mutton, boiled potato and egg as usual. My only concern is the that the mutton could been boiled a littile more and prepared with more time and care. Later, they also took some extra time to provide the bill (probably there was few initial mistakes ) Overall experience is pretty good! Recommended for non-veg lovers :)

Biryani is for ones with the milder palate so that is extremely subjective. One large boiled potato is for some reason not my idea of a perfect biryani. The mutton kakori kebabs were delicious. The mutton kassa was also quite nice. Go for the kebabs, they are the best items on the list.

It was very crowded when we visited and were shown fairly quickly to our tables. Dont expect much of politeness from them but. Needless to say the waiter ended up not earning a tip and consequently throwing our bill receipt at us.

They serve good mughlai food,  True!!     But let me state outright this is not a place where you want to sit and eat, my strong advice is to pack it and take it home with you to savour in peace....
As I really dont like the ambience....it is messy....there is hardly space among the tables....
On our last visit to arsalan,
We placed the order for mutton spl biryani....kakori kebab....and firni....
The biryani was tasteful.....the meat in the biryani was very tender....delicious....5 out of 5...for sure....but Kakori kebab was a big disappointment....I dint like it.....
now coming to the phirni,I must say It Made My Day....it was perfect...so tasty :-) I Love it !!!

I love to to go to Arsalan Ripon Street rather than coming here.

One Chicken Arsalan Special I had that was really awesome. I can't remember the name of the dish but it was mentioned something Arsalan Special. It was smashed chicken. You can ask to the waiter and try it.

I feel this place is too much hyped! I don't think the biriyani is as great as it preaches to be! Just average taste, nothing different from any other road-side biriyani stalls. What I liked about the place is that their service is quite fast and we didnt have to wait for too long to get our food. Quantity is also good and two people can easily share one plate of biriyani. If you are new to Kolkata, you can visit this place. You might even like their food (as my other friends). Strictly 3/5 from me!

Be there & you will feel that someone is distributing free food, because there is so much rush that you have to wait long to get a seat or get a takeaway. But after the long waiting the result will make you smile.

The food is fantastic and Biryani can be rated as one of the best in India and surely best in Kolkata.

Rezala, Chaanp & Kassa items are also very tasty.


I recommend it to every Biryani Lover and anyone who loves Non Vegetarian Food.

Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Chaap, Chicken Rezalla and Chicken Cheese Kebab. this is what you should order and this is what you should eat! The Biriyani has just the right flavour and the mutton pieces are soft. The Cheese kebab is the greatest and the Chaap is fragrant and tasty. The Rezalla is also very nice to eat. I recommend this place to any Biriyani lover that I meet. I would go on to say that the food here is better than that of Zeeshan as well. 

Yes, the ambiance is a little not upto the ,ark but its alright to go and eat there because yes the food is just that good. Take a group of friends there and hog dear readers, because after that you do not need to consult anyone to go and eat there again and again and again!

Arsalan is a place where I think experiments get conducted regularly about how to make Biryani all the more better than the previous version  and transform it to another level of being a god of non-veg food. Arsalan, specially the Park Circus branch is a competition to itself only-nobody even dares to go near the legendary mark-line drawn by it in the history of making the best Biryani.

The ethereal smell will make anyone crazy at a very basic salivary level of appetite. Each and every spice(ghee-fried-onion, garam-masala etc.) can be recognized inside the mouth. And the flavor is just a dynamite of delight exploding on the taste buds. The meat is of a good texture and is well-cooked. And the rice is excuisite, none of them are broken or over bolied. Arsalan makes it sure that each time you are served with a masterpiece of its own out-of-the-world level.

For the side dishes, special mention should be made for rezala. The warm hint of pepper and the light gravy is perfect in a cold wintry evening.

Special mention for tiny bites are each and every roll of this place. You can pick any roll and munch it inside within no time in a busy schedule. No exaggeration of sauces but a good filling and well-made paratha-cover is a mouth watering delight for the fast-goers.

People visiting Kolkata 'have to' check this place out apart from Victoria Memorial or Birla Planetarium. It is as much important as the other worth-visiting kolkata spots are.

You cant look for a fantastic ambiance if you're coming to Arsalan. What happens here is that, the food takes you to a different level of ecstasy and you forget to worry about minor issues.
Not very well lit but good enough to see what is served to you, and if not great it scores decent on hygiene chart.
 Okey, I cant wait to write about the food here. So, let's begin with Mutton Reshmi Kebab.. What should I say, in my humble opinion not many restaurants in and around can come up with such melt-in-mouth, just rightly spiced, supremely aromatic kebabs that always leave you hungry and craving for more. 

A lot has been written about the light yet tasty Biryani they prepare with well cooked meat, rightly done potatoes hitting a sixer with the aroma. I'll just add, a little fact, if Biryani is all about acidity and bloating tummy all day, you should try the one here, for me it is zero discomfort. 

Then comes the side kicks, Mutton Chanp is y call, there are several others extremely tasty on the menu, you can try the Rezala, another perfection on plate. Oh! I forgot to mention this other kebab, Arsalan special Chicken kebab, that comes with a wrap pf molten cheese. Yumm!!

I mean what you get here is just perfect, soft, well cooked meat, just the right punch of crisp and burn in the kebabs and right when you enter the place your lungs would rejoice in the ideal smokey flavor that vouches for a brilliant Mughlai and Kebab place.Get down here and treat yourself!!

its difficult to miss arsalan along with the numerous people and even more hanging seekhs while crossing the 7 point crossing.

the food is above average. the biriyani is tasty with succulent meat pieces and the long rice. the aroma will leave its mark on your nasal nerve endings. the mutton chaap pairs with it perfectly.
about the kebabs, their quality is a really see-saw affair. i still remember ordering a hariyali kebab twice only to regret it . the 2nd batch was horribly overcooked. the staple tandoori chicken is well prepared. the reshmi kebab lives up to its name.

masala kulcha with chicken butter masala is a tried tested n enjoyed combo for me.

but the main problem with the place is the attitude of the waiters and the overall service. it should improve especially in the upstairs AC section. 

despite the good food, not a decent place to be with your family or for a afterfight-makeup meal with your girlfriend/ wife. quite easy on the pocket of college goers.

P.S.- DO NOT MISS THE PHIRNI here.

Place is too crowded waiters are mannerless.They even don't know how to behave with customers.Apart from that the food was awsome as usual.I always order normal biriyani because hyadrabadi is totally different I don't like that at all.Cheese kabab,resmi others all yammi..
Rezala was not that good and the firni was good but not awesome.
Only for my cheese kabab I will visit this place again and again....

For old timers like me, Arsalan is the new kid on the block. I first went to the Park Circus joint about 6/7 years back and was introduced by a friend. Since then, it has been a regular place for me and all my guests who come to Kolkata. In fact, I suspect that several of my friends come to Kolkata more for the meal at Arsalan than for some real business with me!! Arsalan has a nice cozy restaurant and dining area which is a ctually the ground floor of a old residential house and one can make out the layout from the walls and their angles. However, I feel this adds to the ambience and feel of the place and adds to the magnificent stuff they serve. The Mutton Biriyani is the best in town.... period. But, I would rush to add here that there are several other dishes which I feel are either best or near about best in town. Try the Mutton Stew- it is a thick gravy with succulent pieces of mutton superbly diced and cooked to perfection. The Tandoori Roti is a very good too. The Chicken Biriyani has a very calm and comfortable feel about it and the Mutton Biriyani is just smooth as silk, the meat is cooked to perfection and the rice simply blends with the meat and potato. The Mutton Chaanp is also not to be missed. I always have a Menu tucked in my car or at home and they have very efficient parcel service.

Recent review 2nd Feb : thoroughly disappointed. The mutton bhoona was re heated and hard, the biriyani soggy..... EXTREMELY POOR service..... Perhaps will not come back....

I was pushed into checking out this restaurant by a Bengali friend when I visited Kolkata. Actually when Saibal was in Delhi I took him to Karim's in Jama Masjid. Call it a bad hair day or the cook was probably on leave but the much hyped Biryani at Karim's was pathetic.
He promised me a treat at Arsalan.
Man.....I just had the mutton special Biryani.....Cooked in Awadhi style with a full boiled egg in the rice with a steamed potato.....the Biryani was truly a feast for Kings. Very subtle...and very light....it was the most magnificent Biryani I had ever tasted. Guys On an empty stomach I would have probably gone in for seconds and thirds.........A thumbs Up for Arsalan!!!!!!

Mutton Biriyani from Arsalan , Park Circus
Probably the best Biriyani in town.. the rice would melt in your mouth and so does the delicious mutton and potato . Go there with time in your hand as the restaurant remains crowded even on a weekday afternoon ... The service is good though it obviously takes time to get the ordered food with such a strong foot fall. The ambience isn't anything to talk about but the food wont even let you think about that ... Go there for an excellent culinary experience and return with a simile on your face and great memories till the next time...

Okay I don't think I have to say much about this place. For those who doesn't know, this place is even Dada's (Sourav Ganguly) favorite. There's some kind of magic in Arsalan's Biryani. At least, I have always felt it. No matter wherever you try across the globe, you'll never ever find a place like this. I remember, the closest I tasted was in one of the famous places in Lucknow but still I could differentiate the tastes of both the Biryanis. The mutton chap is also very genuine. And then there's some extras like a special biryani where you pay less on a total but you get more rice and extra chicken/mutton. The firni is also a must eat after a heavy meal. To sum up, if you want to taste the best biryani in Kolkata, go to Arsalan!

Arsalan is the newest biriyani maker of the city. But has made such an impact that has put the others virtually out of business!

This place is never empty and you find at least 10-15 people buzzing and waiting, and i'm talking about deliveries. 
It has a non ac sitting arrangement downstairs, that you might squeez in to, but the ac area upstairs is never empty!
We ordered Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Butter Masala.

Anyway, coming to the food. Biriyani, is their USP. It is top notch, rich and the basmati is long and filled with flavour. The rich herb spices in the biriyani make for an everlasting footprint in your tongue that stays with you forever. The portion of mutton was big, soft and riddled with spices. The mutton was so soft that you don't even have to chew it properly! 
The Chciocken butter masala, was rich again. Bubbling flavours, the aroma...the blend of rich spices with a gravy made of onion is perfect to compliment an equally good biriyani.

I don't generally say this, but Arsalan is Horribly good. So good, that you would not settle for biriyani from any other place than this. So come here at your own risk, a risk..i feel isn't that risky to take.

Had the opportunity to sample the Mughlai mania cuisine if this unique place! Take aways like mutton biryani, chicken Chap, mutton bura chops, mutton boti kababs were the few choices we opted for ! By god were we happy! Recommend Arsalan special: mutton rezala, chicken or mutton kalimirch, mutton stew and mutton champ as well! Worth the taste, as we don't get such great Mughlai food in aamchi mumbai ! Value for money

It has never ever happened that I have been in the city, and not come here, at least once...!!!

It begins with the Chicken Hariyali Kabab, followed by the Special Biriyani and Mutton Rezala, and ends up with the delicious Firni. This course has never changed for a long time now...!!!

The place is always crowded, the people are minimally courteous, the washroom is not at all clean !!! But how does it matter, when you get the best portion of Biriyani here in Arsalan.

It again proves, however much we look for the ambiance, the crowd and the hygiene of the place, its the food that matters...

Tops my favourite list !!!

Arsalan is strictly for casual dining and take-away. Their Biriyani tastes like heaven but the service is very very slow. Well to be honest the restaurant is always overcrowded and so less waiters to serve customers, it's expected.
But people like me who are crazy and drool on their Biriyani keeps on coming back against all odds.
If you are in Kolkata and haven't tasted in Arsalan then what have you done??!! Keep it in list at par with Victoria Memorial.

If its food then definitely ---no questions asked ... in my opinion this Park Circus joint is king as far as Biriyani is considered. However the restaurant mostly stays over overcrowded which is big turn off --as no one enjoys being elbowed while concentrating on a succulent piece of  mutton..
Both the Non A.C (Ground Floor) & A.C (!st Floor) is having the similar issue..
Besides Biriyani....some more delicacies that deserve special mention are mutton tikka ; chicken tangri kebab...Firni (dessert) is a "MUST TRY" here..

Most of the calcuttan r crazy about ARSALAN's biriyani. but frankly speaking I didn't find any craziness their. I even don't liked it. very oil, not properly garnished, smell also not so good. But their KABABs r awesome & finger licking. & their chicken side dishes like BUTTER MASALA, CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA, CHICKEN TENRGI MASALA r fabulous & must try. taking about their STAFF/WAITER r not well behaved, they are  very rude, always in hurry, they don't serve it properly, disappointed a lot.!!
for this particular reason I stopped visiting Arsalan's PARK CIRCUS outlet. the other one in PARK STREET is far better in terms of servicing. 
so i rated it 3.5. thank you.:)

A lot have been written already about this famous joint. Just want to mention few things:-
1.  Biriyani is excellent & consistent in quality out here- no doubt ( though a bit too oily) but try the kababs also.
2. The arsalan special kabab is a must try.
3. The chicken tandoori along with the green chutney is a great starter for any party.
3. The chicken bharta is not worth trying -very very oily.
4. The staffs are not well mannered. Hence do not go there with expectations of a fine dining experience.
5. The spicy food lovers can try hyderabadi biriyani. I liked it.
 Home delivery/take away is recommended.

Located unmistakably at the park circus seven point,this is for me the best outlet of Arsalan.The long queue of people waiting to get a seat at all most all times of the day is testimony to the quality and popularity of the place.

This outlet has a non ac section in the ground floor and an ac section upstairs.The non ac section in the ground floor is very hot and is too uncomfortable to try.Also here you will probably have to share your table with others.Upstairs is more like a restaurant with ac and separate tables.But thats about it.There is nothing much to write about ambience n decor.The tables are very close to each other and it is always crowded and noisy.

There is nothing to say that has probably not been said yet about the food at Arsalan.For quite a lot of people Arsalan serves the best biryani in town.I do share this opinion too.The biryani is very tasty.The pieces of chicken or mutton are also generally nice.The Hyderabadi and the Lucknow biryanis are also very good and tasty and authentic.Some people find the biryani here too oily.I do not disagree completely but I for one do not mind.The Chicken chap,mutton chap and the tandoori chicken gravy here are also excellent and must try.And who can forget the chicken arsalan kabab.Its the tastiest and best kabab I have ever had,anywhere.The wonderfully prepared chicken kabab wrapped in cheese is a treat to the taste buds.The kekuri kabab is also one of my favourites.In fact any of the kababs you order will be great.
And yes,they also have Chinese items on the menu.God knows why!Its an absolute waste of time,money and resources!
Do stick to the Mughlai and pamper your tummy!

The few other advantages of this particular branch is-
1.All the items are generally available.Some items like the kekuri kabab,Hyderabadi biryani I have found sometimes unavailable in the other outlet nearby towards ajc bose road.
2.The prices are slightly lesser.
3.Service is very fast.
The disadvantage of this branch is that the ambience and decor is a bit inferior to the outlet towards AJC Bose road.

But who cares about ambience and decor when one has such awesome food to indulge in.For me Arsalan serves the best biryani n kababs in town and this outlet is the best option.

Although this is a branch of original arsalan which is beside the park circus flyover, but I consider this one is better...Lucknowi biriyani is exquisite in both its taste and authenticity...Hyderabadi Biriyani is also a must try...If you are a kabab crazy foodie the chicken arsalan kabab is the best dish you have to go for...It is dipped in cheese and served hot....I believe this is the best mughlai joint kolkata has got due to its value for money and quality of food...One thing to be mentioned is one of their waiters is a little ill mannered and if you give any special dish in order, his common reaction is "It will take 30 minutes time. Will you change your order?"....It has happened with me 6 times so I am sharing this on Zomato, which the restaurant authority must look upon...

i had heard of arsalan for quite long but never got the opportunity to visit the place until recently (towards the end of august)! eating out hasn't been a planned affair in our family but after my sisters got married and settled in different parts of india whenever they come to kolkata we plan out our restaurant visits and zomato helps therein! which non-vegan isn't a fan of biryanis, kebabs and tandooris in india and which fan of these will not be a fan of arsalaan? the outlet is a bit too crammed and i rather look out for fine-dining experiences with spacious decor but primarily it's about good food and good service! we had ordered chicken, mutton and vegetable biryani, chicken garlic butter masala, mutton stew, chicken tandoori, chicken arsalan kebab, fish tandoori and mutton kakori kebab! everything except the kakori kebab tasted heaven! the kakokri kebab was a disappointment especially considering arsalaan specializes in awadhi cuisine! it was bland and left a greasy after-taste! rest of the items were super delicious! the biryani melts in your mouth! the kebabs and tandooris were tender! the chicken masala was my favorite! my mouth is already watering as i am writing this! definitely one of the best flooding experiences that defines kolkata! the pricing is moderate and very affordable!

Situated in Park Circus, Arsalan is the place where all BIRIYANI lovers should be.With decent ambiance and great food one cannot stop after visiting this place once.
The place will give you a homely atmosphere and without hesitation ask the waiters about the various dishes if you are a first timer to this place.However I will recommend the Mutton Lucknow Biriyani for all North Indian food lovers. A mouth watering spicy dish with good quantity food, one will get back his/her full appetite just by having a look at the food.:D A trend is there to order side dishes alongside Biriyani. It may hold good for other restaurants serving Biriyani but for Arsalan's Mutton Lucknow Biriyani change the trend.No exaggeration guys skip breakfast(for females :P) or have something light for breakfast(for males :P) if you are planning to have Mutton Lucknow Biriyani for lunch.
Kudos to Arsalan for the quantity and taste they provide for this special dish!:)Arsalan bags a 4.5/5 for the food.
Coming to the hospitality part,the waiters are not always ready at your table to serve whatever you order midway.So your mid way order may get deffered a bit.:(. Thats dissapointing but never mind they make it up with the quality and quantity of food! I give a 3/5 for the service.
As I mentioned earlier the ambiance is decent (a homely atmosphere is always decent and cannot match a 5star restaurant :) ) with average dining facility.
I visited Hyderabad's various popular restaurants to have a taste of the true Hyderabadi Biriyani but those resaturants could'nt help me forget Arsalan,Park Circus,Kolkata
For school and college students with limited pocket money(precisely BIRIYANI lovers)hurry up and visit the place if you havn't done it yet.

I have been longing to visit this joint for a long time.And managed to pay a visit on my birthday.Well i am really impressed after having their food.Needless to say the delicious food made my birthday even more special.
I won't go into details like the location and ambiance of this joint. Because there is nothing extra/special to contribute.Location at 7-point Park Circus crossing is a no-brainer for people of Kolkata. Ambiance in a typical Mughlai joint is run of the mill.The ground floor arrangement is chaos at its best, wherein people are not bothered even to share tables with strangers.They come here to enjoy the food.Nothing else matters.For people who want a little privacy,less noisy atmosphere and cannot survive without an AC, then the first floor section is meant for them.
Now coming to the food.I tried the mutton special biriyani. This dish comprises of 2 large pieces of mutton,1 egg and loads of basmati rice.Enough for 2 people.I have no qualms in admitting that this happens to be one of the best biriyani i have ever had.I will not go into comparisons between different restaurants serving Biriyani in Kolkata. But in my honest opinion Arsalan and Alibaba will take the top honours.
Mutton pasinda and chicken tikka butter masala are the side-dishes that i had ordered.Both comprised of rich gravy along with boneless pieces of meat.However some people might complain about the dishes being very spicy and oily.Some might complain about being salty too.But i found them to be quite appropriate for my taste.
Amongst the bread items roomali roti and butter nan was pretty decent and soft.
Overall a very satisfying experience.Found the food to be delectable and rightly priced.No wonder this joint is crowded throughout the day and expanding rapidly all over the city,Too bad they do not have an outlet at Prince Anwar Shah Road.Are the owners listening? :)

One of the best Biriyani joints in Kolkata. Great biriyani, chaap, rezala etc. But what really stands out is the atrocious behaviour of the staff. They behave as if they are feeding a bunch of beggars for free. Something like this is not expected in a restaurant like this.

Food is no doubt a question. For foodies like us, a paradise on Earth. But I wish north indian food could be a little less rich. But anyways, a heart-throb for the Calcuttans.

Yes this is insane! To be specific, their biriyani is!

This restaurant is very easy to locate, just at the famous Park Circus junction. I won't disagree if someone argues that it's not a proper restaurant. It isn't technically. The ground floor is a hot non-AC dining area, where you'd probably have to share table with others. The first floor AC room is small and congested. There's nothing to mention about decor or ambiance. And whichever time I reach there, I see at least 20 people waiting outside (yeah they all know why they are taking the trouble, and that's really worth it). So, you have to wait for sometime before you get your seat. 

After ilish-vs-chingri and east engal-vs-mohan bagan, they next big fight bongs always cherish is the who-serves-the-best-biriyani-in-city. Arsalan, Sheeraz and some other big names have their own huge fan following. While the debate is never conclusive, this place has always been my personal favorite. And I'm sure many others would agree if I say that they serve the best biriyani in the city (and, arguably, in the whole country, after tasting biriyanis from famous restaurants in Hydrabad, Delhi and other cities). 

My all time favorite is Arsalan Special Murgh Biriyani and Mutton Stew. This combo is just out of the world! Takes you to an age of Mughal nawabs, vibrant and dark histories and mysteries. The thin long rices in bright white and yellow, white-ish brown chicken pieces and the smoke coming out of it with a thick aroma, the bowl of dark brown gravy with tender mutton pieces...you have to taste it to understand and feel it. 

You can go with any kebabs to start with, be it tangry kebab, arsalan kebab, malai kebab, hariyali kebab or any random kebab on their menu, you'll not regret it. Same goes for most of the non-veg gravies. I'm not so confident with fish items, they are not known for them. I'll strongly discourage any veg items (sorry, but this is not a good place for pure vegetarians). And don't spoil your time by ordering Chinese, try to stick to Mughlai! Perhaps, it will be wise to refrain from ordering rotis and parathas as well, and let biriyani rule. 

They don't have wide variety in deserts, but I always order firni and soft drinks to complement my biriyani and kebabs.

I visited the Park circus outlet of Arsalan, two days back and trust me when I say this, my experience was 'horrible'. Yes! Horrible is the word which describes my experience best. We reached the restaurant by 3PM, however, we were not allowed to enter. This aged man, supervising the down floor did not let us enter, and his behavior was atrocious. After a couple of minutes we were literally forced to sit downstairs with a group of strangers, however, we did not agree. At this, the man got all the more irritated and said that it would take 45 mins for the upper floor to be empty. We were ready to wait, yet, the man was not contented to this as well. He said that, in upstairs we have to share a seat with another couple. Single couple seats would take an hour to be vacant. We said that we were ready to wait, and miraculously within 10 minutes the seats were empty, much to the man's discontent. We reached upstairs and ordered the chicken Arsalan kebab as a starter, along with butter nan, chicken tikka masala, and biryani. We were told that the food would reach us in 20 minutes, however, it actually did reach us after 45 minutes that too without the kebab. They said that, they would take time to make the Arsalan Kebab. We savored the semi-hard nan with the pretty delectable tikka masala. And, the biryani as we all know, is out of the world. The kebab reached us when we completed our meal, and for the first time in the history of dining, we had our starter after completeing the meal. I found nothing special about the kebab, however, my friend loved it. All in all, Arsalan might make 'good' food but that's it. The food is nothing better than 'good' and with the atrocious behavior of the staff, I would better hang out somewhere else.

Best Biriyani of Kolkata. I am sure 8 out of 10 kolkatan will agree with me. If you want to do a to-go service this outlet is the best place as you can spend the waiting time browsing other stores; however I never tried their restaurant here. They have a bigger place to sit across the road. I found them very consistent in preparing biriyani, may be last 100 times my taste buds received same smell and taste. People told me that it is from Lucknow gharana but I guess it now can be tagged as Kolkata gharana !!

There kebabs are good but one might not decide to wait for 30 mins for a kebab or tandoori to go :) Not so much worth the wait...However I tasted their Mutton Pasinda which I found very good one...

Arsalaan is a true name for Kolkata Biriyani. As, only a very few can stand head to head with them. Visiting Arsalan for more than a few times, experiences had been good always. Its quite tough to get a table without standing in the que. Anyway that becomes a boon in a way. The rich aroma of Biriyani and chaap from the kitchen tickles you olfactory senses and stimulates the mice in you tummy to run a little faster so that when your dish arrives, your mouth become shut (stuffed with Biriyani) and a feeling of being in the jannat after you finish the light and aromatic Biriyani. They never compromise with their quality, be it a weekday, week end or a rush hour of festivals. 
Apart from their Biriyani, I got a chance to taste their north indian delicacies which are no doubt some of the best you can find in Kolkata.
Service is prompt, though unfortunately the staffs lack in smiles, but come on, as I told you, when they arrive with the plates, you will forget about your fellow diners. Cheers for the masterpiece from the real experts

biriyani and arsalan are often used interchangeably by foodies in kolkata. The tantalizing aroma of their biriyani is enough to make mouth water. one of the best food joints in kolkata. location is very easy to point out also. place remains always crowded but it is tolerable when someone is going to have Biriyani from Arsalan.

I have a bad reputation that i roam across India to taste different types of cuisine . Biriyani is something i love to the core, three types of biriyani's i've tasted till date , Lucknowi, Hyderabadi and The rest (like the Kolkatan ) . But trust me on this note , this one  attracts me the most. A perfect blend of spices, saffron , light, non sticky biriyani  with properly tendered chicken or mutton accompanied by Soft boiled potato covered in biriyani essence  makes it the No. 1 joint to have Briyani in Kolkata. I personally prefer the park circus one because according to them they are having the best group of cooks here . 

SEATING AND SERVICE  :

1.  Downstairs its non air conditioned and you have to share your table with others in case its over crowded . Food tastes the same, but the price of the biriyani and other items are less . somewhere around 10-20 bucks . 

2. If you are bringing your family , there is a staircase on the right side which will lead you to the air conditioned portion of the restaurant which is at first floor . Same food quality with a better ambiance and service . But somehow I find the floor manager bit rude at times and always coming to you and asking whether you are ready to order or not . at times he will indicate passively by asking " do u need anything else? should i make the bill? " . But I can understand that its not his fault but the rush .

FOOD : 
I will recommend 3-4 items, which is a must must try once you step into this place . 
1. Biriyani (be it chicken or mutton ) 
2. Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala   -- white non spicy gravy on a sweeter side with tendered reshmi kababs , 6 pieces . enough for 2 .
3 . Chicken Tikka Kabab--- Very nice Kababs , but you cannot rate it 10 out of 10 .
4. Chicken Tikka Butter Masala --- Same 6 pieces like reshmi butter masala but this time with Tikka Kababs and dark Reddish Spicy Gravy ( goes well with mutton Biriyani )
5 . Firni ( one of the best in entire kolkata / bit overpriced )

PARKING : Infront of the restaurant , beside the sidewalk you can risk parking your car.

POSITION : Situated in the heart of the city . Park Circus 7 Point crossing . Can be reached easily from any direction.

This is heaven for mughlai lovers in kolkata, if somebody is giving a treat the first name which comes to our mind is Arsalan . Cheap , Affordable , *Very *high Quality Food . You will find it the same everytime you visit . 

POINT TO BE NOTED : I had a bad experience on my birthday though. I ordered 10 full reshmi butter masalas and 16 biriyani's and some other side dishes for take away . But reaching home i surprisingly found there were only 3 pieces of chicken in every container . I called them up Immediately and they said sir , please come over and we take your order again and this will be for free, by that time the my mood was completely messed up and i cut the phone . The next time i visited the place i complained , but their answer was are you carrying the previous bill? then we can offer you free food for this time , which i tore long ago.  **** SO if you are having some problem with your food , do tell them and keep the bill . They will take care of that . 

Cheers and ugh ... i wrote too much , you cannot really stop when you start writing about arsalan . BURRRP!

Ahh....Arsalan....Just the name is enough to make my mouth water for an irresistible plate of Biryani ! In my opinion ( and I'm sure many others'), they serve the best Biryani in town. Having studied at Lady Brabourne College, no fest or outing of ours was ever complete without a visit to this place. Even though Park Circus has many places for Mughlai food lovers, this is a standout. And yes, I have tried Shiraz, Zeeshan, Aminia and Rahmania as well !

This particular outlet is almost always overflowing with people and if you are unwilling to share your table with complete strangers, you might have to wait a while to get seated at the upper level (A.C) area. Not that I mind waiting....Cause this is a place where it's all about the Food. Service is fast. And I feel that this kind of ambiance really has a charm of its own....where people seem to take their Biryani pretty seriously !

Coming to the food, there's not much that hasn't been said already ! Both the Chicken and Mutton Biryani are so awesome that many a times I don't even feel the need to have a side dish. And the consistency is remarkable......the Biryani seems to taste exactly the same every time I have it. Simply divine.....And it's kind of addictive ! Your first visit here will never be your last....you can count on that.

Personally, I never found the Biryani to be too oily.....but then, that's just my view. Weight watchers may beg to differ....but to me, when the food is that good, I couldn't care less. Pricing is moderate and doesn't pinch the pocket much, even for a college student. I just couldn't give this place any less than 5 stars. Yes, it may not be perfect in every sphere, but it definitely is a Paradise for Biryani lovers....in every way possible ! :)

As everyone here would know, Arsalan is a chain of restaurants known for their exotic Biryanis. The restaurant is located in very accessible area of Park Circus 7 Point Crossing, just next to Jugal's sweets. The restaurant is very small in size and one may find it overcrowded as hell during festive seasons still the service is fast enough and patience for waiting pays off at the end while having the food.

When we talk about the food, any kind of Biryani say Chicken or Mutton will leave you licking your finger. Other than that all kinds of Indian traditional food items are available which are also at par with the Biryani. Fish and Prawn items are also available in the restaurant. Quantity of the food in both take away and dine-in is overwhelming. Prices of items are on the higher side but I personally wont mind paying more to have such tasty food.

Talking of the restaurant's looks and aesthetics, the restaurant has two floors, the ground floor is a non-A/C and first floor is Air Conditioned. The ground floor is very poorly managed with very improper utilization of space, not decorated well and  a filthy toilet to increase your annoyance. The first floor is however slightly better than ground floor but on weekdays or festive seasons if you are able to manage a seat there, consider yourself a lottery winner.

In my opinion, the restaurant seriously needs some renovation and efficient space management to keep up to par with other restaurants in neighboring locations. Considering the adjacent location Park Street, many foreigners would pay a visit to this restaurant but with such poor ambiance one would prefer a take away than a dine-in.

Arsalan is one of the most popular and coverted Biriyani joints in Kolkata. Although to do justice to that tag - they serve very consistent food over time. 

Personally - the highlight is their biriyani. Very lightly done and does not leave an after-taste of dalda. Consistency is amazing - mutton is always soft, potato is always good and rice is always nice and long grains. However, do find their "Arsalan special kebab" and for the matter most of their other kebab offering slightly over rated.  

Arsalan Special kebab is a mix of sorts - "hotch-potch" if you can relate to it - it is chicken kebabs coated with cheese. I found rather a mix of strong tastes leading no-where.

Apart from that located very well centrally - service is good , always crowded. Supervised parking available in the lane around - it does get crowded very soon.

Oh!!!! what can I say about this place. I love biryani, and what can be the best place than Arsalan. I try to go at least twice a month .I‚Äôve tasted almost all the Indian items over here so I will suggest u to try all the item, because each dish is better than others. But 1 thing I‚Äôll suggest u not to go there in the festive days if you want to enjoy your food, because there is a huge seating problem and quality & quantity also go down.

I am not a big fan of Mughlai or Indian cuisine but Arsalan (especially this outlet) is a strong exception ! 

This is perhaps the best biryani in town considering the amount of money one pays for it. I should thank my colleagues for introducing me to such a wonderful mughlai joint which I was unaware of for such a long time. 

The Park Circus branch is always crowded no matter what time of the day or which day of the week it is. However service is pretty quick. I recommend dining in, however do not expect a fine dining experience. There is an air conditioned section as well but does not guarantee a quiet dining experience. 

The Arsalan Kebab is truly a revelation and is sold out by 9.30 PM on any day. It is basically large chunks of chicken kebab covered with hot molten cheese. The thought of it makes me crave for these. The biryani is very well made, a bit oily  but good to taste. 1 Plate of special mutton Biryani coupled with a side order is enough for two. 

In short my favourite Mughlai joint in the city for take away or a quick bite with friends.

Location (Rating - 5):
If you can't find Arsalan, Park Circus, then you need an appointment with the eye doctor...just kidding. You are at the park circus seven point crossing then you are at Arsalan.

Ambiance (Rating - 3):
Ambiance is good but the place is overcrowded always. Well it goes good for the sale of the restaurant but the crowd also compromises the ambiance, service, etc. Am not complaining about the restaurant, it can be called my bad luck as I like a more subtle and peaceful environment when I sit to eat.

Service (Rating - 2):
As I said if a restaurant gets overcrowded and you have not enough staff then service gets a little compromised. The waiters are very polite and helpful but when they have a rush you will sometimes feel a bit neglected. The worst part of the rush is the waiting time for your food to arrive to you and if you are hungry enough to eat a horse...!!!

Food (Rating - 4):
The food is the most important thing that makes me visit a restaurant over and over again and Arsalan serves really good food. Specially the North Indian dishes and the most renowned dish of Arsalan...BIRYANI...and its YUMMY...!!! The other dishes such as chinese, etc. are not what I consider authentic chinese as many restaurants in Calcutta offer but they are also good.

Price (Rating - 5):
The prices are excellent and very soothing to your pocket. The quantity of the food compared to the pricing is quite decent and filling. You will be happy to eat the food and also happy to pay the bill.

We have known Hyderabad as the paradise for the Biriyani Lovers, but guess that myth doesn't stand anymore. The Biriyani Joints in Delhi and Lucknow boast of their rich culture in Biriyani which ages older than the Hyderabadi Biriyani.

Not a new but definitely one of the big players in the game is the Kolkata Biriyani which is known for it's subtle taste and variation to the Awadhi biriyani... which has resulted a fame of its own. And to try this whats better than the ultimate destination - 'Arsalan, Park Cirucs'

I must admit, though this joint is famed to be the best Biriyani joint in the City, but the first impression wasn't so attractive and welcoming. People fighting over to get a seat at 3pm on Sunday afternoon in rain, is a pretty common scene here. The restaurant is very conveniently located at Parck Circus 7 point crossing and is difficult to miss.  The restaurant is decent in Size, but definitely small to accommodate the huge parade of Biriyani Lovers that raids this restaurant every day. 

They have two sections, the ground floor housed non-ac section, while the above is A/c section. Depending on that there is small price differences in both the sections. There is huge crowd always in this place, so don't expect much of an ambience. The place is packed with people and noisy which pretty much justifies that the only language this restro speaks of is 'FOOD'.

Now we come to the food quality. I have not tried much of Kolkata biriyani joints as I never lived here. Notable is I tried Aminia once and it was good. Arsalan is definitely better by far. Some people still say that Shiraz Golden Restaurant still serves the best Biriyani in town, but since I haven't tried it once, I'll go with Arsalan, all the time. 

The Biriyani is extremely tasty, but a bit high on oil. We ordered Mutton Spl Biriyani, Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Lahori and  Hariyali Kebab. The Kebab was nice, but I have eaten better kebabs. Chicken Lahori was really good. It seemed very spicy, but the taste was very subtle and you don't burn down your tongue at all. The difference between the normal and Spl biriyani is the quantity, but not the quality. The mutton we very well cooked, almost to perfection as u say, as u would like your mutton to be. The traditional Kolkata Biriyani, with a popato piece and an egg. I loved it and will definitely want to go again.

So I'll just list down the pros and cons of Arsalan, which I felt might be helpful.

Pros:
1. Extremely tasty Biriyani, probably the best in town.
2. Well on price and Budget
3. Centrally located in the city.

Cons:
1. Very crampy place, huge crowd on weekends and festive seasons.
2. Don't expect Privacy or silent dinner, this place is like a busy train station.
3. Biriyani high on oil, so weight conscious people can keep away.

If you want to enjoy their Biriyani, have a takeaway parcel which is available much easier and you can have it in peace. But if you are a Biriyani Lover, you will absorb yourself in the atmosphere of the rush and make yourself comfortable for an amazing Biriyani feast. Enjoy the food!!!

Much to the fact  is their service is really bad , waiter was rude. Chairs are not comfy.
The butter nun that I ordered was too hard to eat.The penny I spent got nothing return out of it.I will not recomend this restaurant to anyone.

This is the Arsalan I go to when I am hungry and want good service. The waiters smile at me encouragingly, and asks after my life every time I come here. And they know my general order, so all they have to do is confirm it. If I am feeling off, I generally order something apart from my Biryani-diet coke combo. Given the fact that I eat here at least thrice a month, that might happen every once in a while. 

Personally, I am not much of a fan of their chaap, but I do like the rezala here. I have to also talk about the very nice staff, who have sort of become friends, and greets me happily every time they see my face. The Chicken Arsalan Kabab is another favorite of mine, and it is extremely difficult to not eat the whole thing by myself, with a single tandoori roti to offset the protein extravagance. In all, I know that there are many people who might hate this place, but I dont. And that's what matters.

There's nothing much to say about Arsalan. Its one of the best places to eat at Park Circus area not to mention one of the best Moghlai cuisine eateries in this city. I have never found their dishes to be below par on any occasion not even when there's a long queue outside the place. We ordered Chicken Biryani and Mutton Pasinda, one of my favorite combos. Somehow I felt the taste of Biryani was average today could not get the Arsalan feeling in my mind like I had experienced hundreds times before. But Mutton Pasinda was just superb, it‚Äôs a bit too oily but mouthwatering. The place is very pocket friendly and very chirpy all the time. Food again is unmatchable. Must recommend for all biryani lovers.

to every kolkatan biriyani and arsalan have become synonymous and in a city mad about biriyani arsalan should top ones gustatory pilgrimage of kolkata. before writing a review myself I was going through other reviews by my fellow foodies and would like to point out a common mistake made over again. this particular arsalan is not the 7 point crossing one. its on ajc bose road near 7 point a couple of yards before the flyover ends and I have to say of all the arsalan branches that have come up in and around the area this joint has to be the best. it is less crowded lot cleaner and the decor suits its repute though the service time is longer and maybe that's why the biriyanis taste a tad better here. the tried and tested chicken biriyani mutton special biriyani made me try other items on the menu and I came up with two not so popular gems. one the geela bhat which is the biriyani right from the bottom of the pot with an excess of oil and ghee. two spoonfuls is enough to fill you up but the taste is heavenly. and the second which happens to be my favourite and tops all biriyanis is the lucknowi biriyani. if you like food a bit spicy like me then this biriyani won't let you down. the lucknowi biriyani is just too good to be true. another recommendation would be the arsalan special kebab-chicken skewers wrapped in cheese and charred to perfection. come here and be satisfied with the best mughlai food in town!!!

A heaven for Mughlai cuisines.... Arsalan is always the 1st place that comes to mind when its biriyani or kababs. 
Located at the junction of 7 point crossing, it serves the most amazing food . But some cons of the place are : the non ac section is not a hygienic place , service is ok types . But the price is very reasonable and if you plan to go out there for launch or dinner, you better be ready to wait coz the restru is always crowded.

Excellent!! Every time I visit Arsalan..that's the first word comes out of my month instantly after having the first bite. Mutton Iranian Stew, Chicken/Mutton Biriyani ofcourse and Arsalan Special Kebab are dishes you should definitely opt for. Other than that Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, Mutton Hariyali rock as well if tried with nun/kulcha

Park Circus, which can also be rightfully called the biriyani lover‚Äôs paradise, harbours the largest number of Mughlai restaurants in Kolkata, with the most important and debatable one being Arsalan. The unrelenting traffic of the utterly chaotic 7 point leads you to this infamous hub for biryani.

Arsalan may not score well in terms of ambiance, service or the health quotient of the biryani, but I still heart this place for a plethora of reasons (the heavenly taste of the food, some very fond memories with this place and many more).

The ground floor section hosts a swarm of flies along with the irresistible aroma of the super oily food and the first floor's A.C. section is cramped and crowded all the time dotted with some very reluctant servers.

Now, the aforementioned flaws are of little significance to the loyal customers who swear by their biriyani. As I am not too health conscious when it comes to eating, the flavoursome mutton biryani with the huge, tender piece of mutton along with the delectable boiled potato is my personal favourite. On the other hand, the soft and chewy lachha paratha makes a killer combo with any mutton or chicken side dish. Lastly, a plate of kesar flavoured firni is the best dessert to end your meal with.

Overall, this is a place for hardcore foodies who won't mind the extra bit of oil and spices once in a while!

P.S: Weight watchers stay away!

I have eaten Biryani and Chicken chaap from this place only once and i find he food is very good, in taste but it is very oily and oily biryani is not good for health. Otherwise all things is ok.

arasalan is the most renouned name for Kolkata biryani lover... however I had real bad experience with this particular restaurant (not with the other branches). .. teastwise food were good... but they serve steal sometimes. .. most of the all the behaviour of stuff are disappointing ... they interfere in to customers conversation & behave bad... I suggest if you want to go for arsalan at park circus area, then go for mughal garden court branch...

It is part of the triad of Biriyani Mecca of Kolkata: Arsalan-Shiraz-Aminia. Patrons fight over which is the best, but I think Arsalan's a strong contender for the title of 'Best Biriyani Place in Kolkata'.

The biriyani here is really good; it is not too oily, despite a subtle hint of dalda prevailing. I personally have no particular qualms about chomping down dalda-slathered biriyani, but Arsalan does a good job of camouflaging the shortening's fatty flavour in aromatic spices. They certainly don't skimp on the pieces of mutton in the Biriyani, but when I had the chicken Biriyani, I found the piece of meat disappointingly skinny. On the very few occasions 


The kebabs are beautiful to taste; the spice coat, the amount of char, the texture of the chicken are all near perfect. I prefer the Reshmi kebabs, but I have been reliably informed that the Kakori and Hariyali kebabs are 'absolutely sinful'.

The side dishes, however, I cannot rave about. They repeatedly fail to impress me. Most of the time, the creamy 'butter' dishes are too sweet for my liking. I prefer Only Alibaba's slightly tangy taste. The pieces of chicken (I never order mutton sides, so I can't vouch for that), though not exactly tough, are not as succulent as I like them to be. The gravy almost always has a curdled look that I find particularly unappetizing. 

As for the service, it's not up to the mark. The waiters have the same couldn't-care-less attitude that I have seen in so many mid- to low-range restaurants in Kolkata. On more than one occasion, we had to ask for a glass of water after getting our seats, forget about refills. For every dish we ordered, for the glass of water, for the refills, even for the bill there was a tedious wait. In fact, the last time I went there with a friend, it was just noon, the restaurant was not even half-filled, and the waiter asked us to sit at a table side by side, cramped together, instead of sitting comfortably facing each other. I have no idea how this could help them or anyone, but it was certainly a very uncomfortable lunch with both of us trying hard to fit the dishes on a table that's meant to serve one person on each side.

This got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Kolkata. It serves the typical oily yellow colored rice which goes by the name of Biryani in Kolkata. It tastes OK but there is nothing special to write home about. The side dishes are even worse. The place is crowded and chaotic, service shoddy. Definitely not a place for couples or family. In short, those who know what REAL Biryani should taste and smell like should look elsewhere.

Location:- Arsalan is located at the main crossing, when you get down from A.j.c. Bose road heading towards it cafe or bypass. This particular branch of Arsalan is always crowded with people coming for having a biriyani , rezala or rolls. I preferably like to sit in the upper air conditioned section where a small man wearing turban greets us with a smiling face. 

Coming to the pros and cons of this place
Pros
1) service is very quick when it comes to biriyani and moderate when it comes to kebab
2) large seating capacity- can accommodate a large number of families
3) the AC section is quiet maintained having a good ambience. 
4) Food is deliciously tasty including the kebabs they serve. 
5) staffs are polite out here. 

Cons:-
1) The lower section is dirty and needs renovation.
2) Not a good place for pure vegetarians
3) Prices are high as compared to other branches 

Rest, I have no complaints at all. :-) 

Must try:- chicken biriyani, mutton biriyani, chicken rezala, firni.

This Arsalan outlet is possibly the one that serves the best food among the four or five in the city. It is perpetually crowded, which makes entry a problem, but for those who like Mughlai food, it might be worth the wait.

Reams have been written about Arsalan's biriyani, with fierce debates about whether it is the best biriyani in the city, or whether some other restaurant makes better biriyani. I will pass over that and merely say that the biriyani here is certainly very good.

There are other items on the menu that are worthy of attention. The Arsalan Special Kebab, which is coated in melted cheese, is a hybrid dish, but hard to resist. Not too much has been said about the very good Tandoori Rotis and Lachcha Parathas available here. Most of the mutton dishes are good, and the Arsalan Murgh Makhani deserves special mention among the chicken dishes.

The service has been variable. I agree with many reviewers who say that the waiters have been rude.  I must also say that I have always been served by polite and friendly waiters every time I have been there (till date). Dishes that are pre-prepared, like the biriyani, arrive quickly, but other dishes take time.

In many Mughlai restaurants, individuals or groups of up to three people do share tables with other individuals or groups - it is traditional, but usually does not happen in the air-conditioned section of the restaurant.

Overall, a good place to go to for Mughlai food, provided you are willing to brave the crowds.

I am not sure I have seen any of the chinese menu in Arsalan, while clicking the menu button!  That's weird. Now lets talk about food.. May be I have visited more than 100 times in this place.. 
Even once I remember I have taken my client there. He was shocked to see the queue.. lol.. but when he started having the food, he was like waoo.. I still remember his face.. 
If you can ignore the crowd and little bit of waiting time, trust me this would be the best place for biryani.. I had biryani from delhi, hyd, even kachi biryani in Dhaka.. but none of them will be close to the taste of Arsalan.. I can give 6 out of 5 for the food.. but the ambience will bring it down to 4.5 .. so I'll suggest just ignore the waiting period and focus on the food.. it would be the best place

This place is awesome when it comes to mughlai food....the biriyani and kebabs are incomparable.
I recently had the lucknowee biriyani and its a mouth-watering delight,though the portion was too large for me.
Downstairs,its a bit messy as you are often asked to share tables and the service is not good.You'd have to holler at a waiter 20 times even to place the order....even upstairs(the ac section) its crowded.But the food makes you forget a lot.The normal biryani is excellent as well as most of the side-dishes.
If your heart beats for food only....definitely worth a visit.

The Biryani is brilliant, the rice is perfectly cooked and they also a serve a healthy piece of Mutton along with it. The portion is good and the food overall delicious.

The Tandoori Rotis were also very good; none of them had the charred bits which are often present on Tandoori Rotis. However they were a bit thick and doughy for my taste. The Mutton Rezala was great, the mutton piece succulent, flavourful and delicious.
The gravy of the mutton Rezala was tasty also

Everybody knows about Arsalan but I will some fun facts about me and my experience related to this restaurant. I never liked Biriyani until one day few of my friends invited me to this restaurant on the occasion of Bhai Phota and from that day I realized the exact definition of a Biriyani. They have this "Murgh Arsalan Kabab (special)" which is a hybrid kebab consists of chicken reshmi kebabs wraped in a roti with cheese in it. This particular dish was featured on GRAPHITI (The Telegraph supplement). Needless to say the mutton in the Biriyani is so soft and tender that it comes off easily from the bone. This place is always crowded and the ambiance is not so good and feels suffocated on the first floor (AC section). But then, who cares about crowd when you have the most mouth watering food in front of you.

We used to go to this place for family dinners as everyone in our household love their Biryani. The Arsalan special Biryani is really good. And so is almost each and everything they serve. But the Naans are too thick for my liking.
But we have stooped visiting this place because we were treated like shit on three consecutive occasions! The first time they forced us to sit downstairs and share a table with complete strangers! The second time we had to wait for an hour before we even got to enter! And the third time they actually managed to bring half our order, lost the other half somewhere and eventually brought us cold Biryani from somewhere!
If you care only about the food and are oblivious to everything else then you may want to give this place a visit.

Try Arsalan Special Kebab, coated with cheese. Have it with or without roti, either way it tastes like heaven. Special biryani can be shared by two. It is priced 1.25 times normal biryani, but contains two pieces of meat and ample of everything.

Even though their prices have almost doubled in the last 12 months, Arsalan's biryani continues to be as lip-smacking as always. Every time I plan to order something new, but the irresistible biryani simply overcomes every other thought. Recently i found out that the mutton chap is pretty good too, but the amount of oil in it might be slightly repulsive..

Apart from the awesome food, one of the drawbacks is that you will never get an empty table, and the crowd at the entrance is often huge and keeps you waiting. Ambience does not score much either, and the ground floor is super-noisy. But the service is fast and once you get your plate, all your hard work seems worth it. :)

yeah,i have to rate this restaurant this poorly,inspite of its ability to make every tandoori item taste otherworldly.the biryani is a delight,the kebabs,the butter masalas and the roganjoshes are top notch.even the roll counter serves the best rolls in this part of kolkata.


sadly,the grounstaff are horrible.and saying that would be an understatement.they are rude,haughty,with no attitude to serve their customers.they will pick on you on every small details,and talk as if they are running a charity,and you are the hobo.the freeloader.the worst part is actually even difficult to talk about.they have this communal rage kinda thing going on.you will find yourself being treated like an outlander once you have been measured,while the "bhaijaans" of the adjacent table would be receiving a smiling pleasant welcome.just beacuse of this,i would avoid this place and visit zeeshan,only alibaba,shiraz,tandoor delights,etc although i love the food here.the only relief you can get is if you take a seat upstairs in ac.  downstair, its a jungle.

When i talk about biryani, this place pops into my head. You get the best biryani here. Its a noisy place and its always full. You need to wait in line but its all worth it. I usually go upstairs for the ac section. You can get a table to yourself. Otherwise you gotta share a table with someone. 

The chicken and the mutton biryani is amazing, the mutton pasinda goes well with the biryani and mixed raita. I always end up ordering the same dish cuz i cant get enuf of it.. but will def try out something new the next time i visit this place.

Arsalan - One of my favorite restaurants in Kolkata. Been eating here since a long time. I am yet to be disappointed by the food on offer. One of the best biryanis in Kolkata. Would suggest the Special Chicken Biryani, Chicken Reshmi Kabab and finish it off with Firni. 

However off late, have noticed a few arrogant staff members. They have developed a high-headed attitude as if they run the place or something. Rude replies, not providing menu cards, no drinking water without asking etc are just a few of them. Only yesterday, as we were leaving after lunch the waiter rudely asks us as to why we were leaving without paying him anything!! I mean who in the world does that? Irony is, we had already left a 50 rupee note behind for the guy ( for no reason though ). Felt absolutely infuriated and wanted to take his case then and there. But then it is the owners who are responsible for letting such an attitude develop among the staff.

Well a landmark of Mughlai Cuisine in Kolkata. The hot-shots here are the Biriyani's  and the Kebabs. The biriyani served here is not dry but notably gheee,well that's what it gives its taste I think....This  service is prompt,but the presentation is not up to the mark. The ambience is so so,but as I said earlier  opinion on quality of food it's Bang on.Other  hot sellers here are Mutton chops,C/M Rezala,Irani Chicken stew and of course the  Chicken cheese kebab. The best way coming here is by any public transport as parking in the 5point crossing is next to impossible. They also deliver food anywhere in Kolkata(above a specified amount)which is a very good option for food food parties.After trying the home delivery twice I can surely tell the delivery service is prompt.                      
                            Well in Kolkata Mughlai means Arsalan,as for now at least.

I would say best Biriyani shop is kolkata region. I have tasted all the biriyani all over but never could compare it with Arsalan. 

Kebabs - I liked all chicken and mutton kebabs. My newest like for past few years are the fish kebabs. If it is less crowded which is hard to find, you will find best kebabs. 

I recently tried mouthwatering Irani dish "mutton stu".  Yummmy!!!!

This restru dnt need a review...

Residing at the East of Kolkata, one gets ample access to the famous Mughlai and Chinese food joints of the city, be it 'Shiraz', 'Zeeshan' or 'Beijing'. So when it came to reviewing 'Arsalan' Restaurant's main branch, I gladly welcomed it. Now, why did I mention the other three eateries if I am to review the fourth one? The answer is pretty simple. Since 2002 when Arsalan started operatiing, it has axed the popularity of the former three. Arsalan serves Mughlai as well as Chinese delicacies but it is best known for its penchant in Mughlai dishes.
I went there to find out exactly why people preferred it to the others.

Situated at one of the busiest crossings of Kolkata, the Park Circus seven point crossing; Arsalan can be surely tagged as one of the landmarks here. The first thing to catch the eye is its name and the abundant space inside. It has nothing to do with the interior decor. After I had a chat with the owner I got to know that more than anything they are concerned about the quality of food they serve. According to him, people go to a restaurant for eating not to see its decor. If the food is good they will visit it again. Still, if someone prefers good interiors and food with equal interest they should seat themselves on the first floor of this joint.

Mughlai food is known for its richness. It is famous for the exotic use of spices, dry fruits and nuts with style and splendor. Here, the dishes start from a mere 80 bucks and can shoot up to as much as 7000! The dishes include Biriyani, Kababs, Tandoori, Noodles, Soup and much more, but the dish which I liked most was their 'Kakori Kabab'. Made with mince meat, it's so tender that it simply melts in your mouth, flavored with god knows what spices! Who cares when you are eating such delicious food!

Arsalan opens at 12 PM and serves customers till 1.30 AM on normal days. During festivities it remains open till 4 AM.I have personally never seen the entrance of this food joint deserted whenever I have walked past the place. 

Am I being biased that I didn't find anything to negate? Well, there are a few negative points as well. If you plan to visit this place, you better travel by public transport because finding parking is near impossible. Get something to pass your time in the queue; it may take as long as 45 minutes to get your order served!

But I think the people of Kolkata are still crazy foodies or else this food joint wouldn't have run this well for 11 years with its 4 branches (one situated at Mumbai)!

A non vegetarians delight. Come here with a healthy appetite since the portions are large and filling. The food is very rich and loaded with calories so forget your diet when you visit. They Biryani is a must have. Mutton chops and Raan tandoori are awesome. And of course the chaap. We were seated upstairs since the lower floor was being renovated. The ambience was not that great since it looks like it was a makeshift arrangement. But 4.5 stars for the food.

If its Biriyani that you want in Kolkata, then its gotta be Arsalan. the best place for biriyani and kebabs in Kol.
Food: Awesome biriyani, superb rolls, fingerlicking kebabs, decent lacchha parathas and nice firnis. you will keep on licking your fingers after you have finished with the food.

Ambiance : Not much of an ambiance, the downstairs eating area is hot and crowded, the upstairs is AC but crowded, space is an issue here. best if you avail the takeaway. Usually there is a huge beeline at the takeaway. getting a table can be difficult in peak hours.

Quality: has been top class. All the items are well cooked and nothing really to say about the taste, its bang on.

Price: Pretty competitive, recently prices have increased, yet you wouldnt mind spending that extra buck for the quality of food that you get.

Try their rolls, im a big fan of those. If its mughlai, then its Arsalan.

Never in my life have I been let down by their food.According to me Arsalan serves the best Biryani in town ! The Chicken Malai sheek is another delicacy. Arsalan = Best Mughlai. Period.  I can overlook the ambiance and environment when I have the Biryani served. They deserve a 5 !

It has become too much costly. As a kabab lover Arsalan used to b my fav place. I often visit there. Bt today am so much disappointed! The price incresed unexpectedly high. Food wise it still remains a good place to dig in but if money n ambience matter, then definayely chose a btr place.

I'm not a fan of this eatery at all, it's overrated.  Its known for its Biryani - frankly I find it too greasy and spicy, Biryani should be delicate and filling...not overpowering on the taste-buds & the stomach! Cheese with kebabs? I am no hater of fusion, but it simply drowns out the delicacy that is a good kebab.

Well personally I just love having Biriyani and no doubt Arsalan is my favourite in Kolkata. The restaurant is right in the very middle and cannot miss your eye sight but yes parking your car is a big big problem. The prices have increased recently though not much change in the quantity but I guess you won't mind paying the extra when you get such delicious and amazing Biriyani. 
Yes the ambience is not very impressive though they have opened a brand new ac restaurant upstairs. So I always prefer to get Biriyani back home. Probably they can try and make the the ambience is little better and much cleaner. 
The place is always crowded whether lunch time or dinner time it doesn't make any difference so you should be prepared to handle the crowd.
This place definitely deserves 4 I feel.

Right now serving the best biriyani in Kolkata. With all due respect to Hyderabadi Biriyani, my 1st love will and always be Kolkata/Lucknow style biriyani. I love the chicken rezala, mutton tikia and the phirni of this place. Oh! and the chaaps as well.
Prices are perfect and not too much.
Minus points for decor and interior. Otherwise there is no negatives at all.

If you want good Biriyani Arsalan is the best place for you..
Altough quantity-wise it may be a little less..
Situated at 7 point crossing its one of the busiest resturant throughout the year..
Ambience is overall good..
Try out the kababs which are awesome..
especially the Tengri Kabab..(sorry if i misspelt)
Biryani of kolkata= ARSALAN

I have been to this place many a times, and except for one time, I have been completely satisfied. I am a true-blue biryani lover, and this place satisfies me like no other. The Arsalan special kabab is the best appetizer you can get! 

But, in just one sentence, this place has the best Kolkata-style biryani available in the city. The taste and aroma is truly unbeatable.

The only time I got a raw deal when halfway through my lunch, I realized that there was a human hair in my dish - which was replaced by them after complaints and a slight argument.

one of the busiest restaurants in Calcutta perhaps. you won't find this place empty at any time of the year. although not a very classy place, but still I LOVE this place. The Best Biriyani in town. yes, it's the BEST. my personal favorite, their Lucknow Biriyani. just awesome. it's the best place in budget. though not a very spacious place but the quantity and quality makes up for it. if you live in Calcutta and have not tasted their biriyani then all I can say that, I pity you.

The best place to have biriyani in this city.Kolkata has always been a city of foodies and arsalan meteoric rise from just being a single restaurant to chain of restaurants is a testimony to the food served by them.Be it mutton or chicken biriyani you just cant have enough when you go to this place.The fish tandoori is also very good and a must have is their special arsalan chicken cheese kebab,an absolute must have for any foodie.

I had Chicken Biryani today for the 1st time...later i realized that i have wasted so many years having in other restaurants.

The biryani was just awfully tasty with the perect mix of indian spices all cooked very nicely. The surprise in the dish was a piece of aloo which was buried admist the biryani rice...

The taste was just awesome. I doubt if u can have a better one in the city. The price was quite reasonable and the quantity served was quite sufficient for a normal apetite man.

There are restaurants which cook Biryanis and then there is Arsalan. They have crafted their Biriyanis to perfection. I don't think one can find a similar tasting Biriyani in any corner of the world. If you are not a Biriyani buff then some of their Mughlai dishes are fantastic, specially their "Mutton Pasinda". As for Ambience, there is another outlet serving the same quality food just a stone's throw away from this one where you can have nice family dinner. This on the other hand is quite rustic and interesting in its own way. I would give a 5/5 in all respects except I wish they felt a tad extra for Vegetarians.

I dont know how people of Kolkata like the food here. We ordered mutton biryani, which was horrible. the mutton pc had no flesh on it just bone n mutton fat, and the biryani was soo oily. the chaap was alright but the chicken pc was very chewy. the kebabs were dry and had so much artificial flavor. come on kolkata wake up. its time you eat good food, healthy food. just down the street is this amazing place called chhote nawab which serves healthy and good food. the kebabs there are the best ive eaten in kolkata. that place is a must try. after eating the food at arsalan i was getting heart burns. all in all very very average.

Gone here many times and yet every time I have been satisfied with the food. The decor, service and arrangement of cutlery is pretty bad...But then that is not what you should look for in Arsalan. The biryani,chap,arsalan kebab are my favourite till date. Had it yesterday again....The A.C. never works and often you may have to wait for some time...Prompt service.
The kebabs in butter masalas, firnis, are also good.
The truth is that they have been increasing prices but the quantity has been decreasing with it...So you loose out from both ends again but then you still get one of the best biryanis in town here.
The Kakori kebabs and the other Kebab sections are all very good though it takes more time, logically it must.
You need to carry more case nowadays, the potato in the biryani too was not that good yesterday but the impact of its food is very good

I have never tasted Biriyani so tasty and excellent anywhere else in my city.I have had some of the order dishes too like Chicken Reshmi Kebab,Dal Makhani  and a few more.There is this Kebab dish called Arsalan Special Kebab i had once where you will find pieces of reshmi kebab wrapped in cheese..it was like an aphrodisiac..its needless to ask the biriyani lovers to go and give it a try 'cause i am sure they have!

Nothing special with ambience, but oh my gawwwd , the food, I just die for it.Starting from their wide ranges of kebabs to chicken chaap & their Delicious Biriyani,Chicken tikka butter masala, mutton tikia..... You wont repent going there three to four times or rather more. The prices are also very affordable and the service is quick. Overall, I rate it as super awsome....

I just love going to this place and home delivering delicious foods. I have eaten food here multiple times and almost all the time i have home delivered. I think in the city of joy, Biriyani is just best here but if i recall correctly,only one time i was not satisfied with the Biriyani cause the potatoes were not well cooked and the chicken pieces were hard like wood. I think this thing happened because it is all the time filled with crowds and so the cook must have any way cooked the Biriyani for hundreds and hundred people. Ambience is fine and hospitality is good. HERE I ALSO LIKE THE CHICKEN RESHMI KABABS WHICH IS MY ALL TIME FAVOURITE AND THE APPETIZING ROOMALI ROTIS. The Arsalan masala Chicken is also excellent and pricing is worth it. Mughlai is although very heavy and its good to have it once a month. Again a nice place to visit with friends and Park Circus has many restaurants and outlets. Whwnever i go there i have to wait there for 15 minutes cause the seats remain filled and guys u must definitely visit there and i know that you will come out with a satisfactory food. A nice tip after having Mughlai dishes is you should have a glass of pepsi then you feel better and not feel the heaviness of Mughlai. The firnis are also tasty and i would rate 5-1 stars for it.

Once you dig into chicken boti kebabs, Biryani, or Butter naan and mutton pasinda, you're in heaven! Do have to specially mention mutton pasinda, its one of my favorites! shredded mutton, soft, nicely cooked, its a perfect dish to have with rotis or naans! The place every Mughlai cuisine lover in the city swears by, Arsalan is a place you just CANNOT miss!

The reshmi kebabs, chap and rezala are also simply yummy and available in both the mutton and chicken options. The Cheese Naan and Roomali Rotis are also very good. End with firni to finish your meal on a sweet note ..... however be prepared to go into a food coma thereafter !

Whenever I go to the Park circus Arsalan (this being the first outlet of all) I think of only one thing...Mutton Reshmi kebab... There is only one other place where I get mutton so tender in a kebab and that is the Karim's in delhi (world famous for kebabs). The other kebabs are also wonderful and so is the biriyani. The service is the only black spot for this eatery...however one can't say anything considering the amount of people they have to serve. All in all, definitely the one of the best mughlai restaurant in kolkata if not the best. Highly recommended...Specially the mutton reshmi....

Irresistible preparations,accurate and classical Kachi Biryani,taste of genuine Hydrabadi Biryani,and yet succulent Awadhi Biryani ( Luchnowi )is very tough to resist. A foodie from Delhi will not miss Karim's here if he visits ARSALAN. 

Chaap is fabulous and so is the Rogan Josh. You can't miss the sublime taste of Mutton Stew and there can't be anything better than Haalim during Ramzaan. I only wish the duration of Haalim gets extended during winter and so is the Paaya and Rezala .

Why ARSALAN is not opening an extension counter at Garia, Jabbar Sahab ? I have made umpteen number of requests.

BIRYANI! The thought of it makes me drool. Yes, biryani does not have to be decorated very elaborately or anything of that sort but the taste makes you feel heavenly. The small soft grains of yellow and white rice melt in your mouth only to make you crave for more and more. Not all the outlets of arsalan have an ambiance that people would prefer to go to but home delivery is the best option for an indulgence in biryani from Arsalan. I have never really tasted the chinese from Arsalan so i cant say much about it, but Mughlai is incomparable. For me Arsalan =  Biryani and im good with just that and nothing more. One of my top 5 favourite restaurants.

They surely serve one of the best biriyanis in Kolkata- very light, no dalda, the pieces of meat are cooked very well. The greatest thing about this place is their consistency, no matter how crowded the place is or whatever be the time of the year, I am always pleased by the quality and the taste.
The kebabs, bharta,and chaps are good.
The service is prompt but not polite, nothing mentionworthy about the ambiance, pocket-friendly. you can go again and again, assured of the same delight.
I haven't tried the Chinese over here, because personally I feel managing Chinese and Mughlai equally well is not very probable when it is not a dedicated multi-cuisine restaurant.

Arsalaan park circus serves the best biryani in town.Among their various biriyani recipes my favourite is mutton special biriyani .It is kept simple with less oil, huge quantity of rice, 2 pieces of tender mutton,1 piece of egg & 1 piece of potato .As a side dish one can also try their mutton pasinda which is simply delicious.The mutton julienne are well cooked and the taste of indian spices adds kick to this nawabi recipe.Kebab lovers can gorge on the arsalaan cheese kebab and chicken reshmi kebab. Tikia as a side dish with rotis or parathas is also very tasty out here.Inspite of calorie consiousness cant stop myself from vising tis place

Had Chicken Biryani, Chicken Tandoori & Firni and every item was awesome. Ambiance is ok(a bit congested). Definitely one of the best in Kolkata and very decently priced. Full value for money. A must visit place.
            

======== Update as on 6 DEC 2016 ========

Mutton Biryani: Obviously the signature dish, extremely well cooked and flavoured. The mutton piece was decent and well cooked (although my favourite would be the mutton piece of Dada Boudi's biryani). The potato and rice was awesome. This dish is definitely and without any doubt one of the best biryanis in Kolkata. Do not miss this. I can just wonder how awesome the special biryani will be. Will try it next time.

Chicken Achari Masala: Super delicious gravy, that tangy-spicy taste is really unique and the chicken pieces were well cooked and soft. Enjoyed it very much with the mutton biryani but this dish will go well with any roti.

Chicken Hariyali Masala: Again a lovely dish. The gravy looks lovely and tastes very good. But it is painful for me to say that the chicken pieces were very hard and felt like they were a week old. Totally opposite of the achari dish.

I would highly recommend this place to everyone. If you are in Kolkata and haven't visited this place then you haven't experienced Kolkata yet.

If You Are In Calcutta, U Dnt Need Any Introduction Of ARSALAN.. As My Office Is Close To The Restaurant, We Prefer To Have Food From Here Only. But Recently I, Along With Couple Of Collegues Of Mine, Decided To Visit The Restaurant. We Have Ordered For BIRIYANI and Tandoori Chicken. Product Is As Usual Fantastic..No Words Are Enough For Their Products

But The Service , We Found Was Not Upto The Mark.. I Mean To Order Tandoori Chicken As A Starter, The Steward Asked Thrice To Be COnfirmed. Also Our "Starter" Arrived After We Finished Our Main Course....

If They Can Upgrade Their Service, I Dont See Anyone Standing A Ground Before Them

it was after ages that we landed up in Arsalan last week. As usual there was a queue for the AC floor but if you are in a hurry you can sit downstairs which has seats available but is non ac. we had to wait for 45 mins but it was worth it. without much adieu my husband & i ordered for roomali rotis, mutton kasa and two chicken biryani and a salad.the food was served without much delay.& when we started consuming it was yummmmmmm!!!! the chicken kasa with the roomali roti was heavenly!!! Thank God for the Mughals who came to rule us and are still ruling the bengali stomach with their Biryani. best part of Arsalan Biryani is its juicy feel... the rice is well cooked and the aroma is perfect. we fed our stomach to the fullest after which we ended the episode with firni which was again awesome!! kudos to arsalan!!! waiting for them to open up in salt lake or surrounding areas so that we dont have to travel that far to savor the taste of their amazing biryani.

In short: Best Kolkata Biryani in Kolkata" 

The menu card is long. My reco to friends is that do not waste ur precious time , energy & imagination - just order Arsalan special mutton Biryani with Mutton kosha, ishtew & chhamp as side dishes. This word of wisdom comes after multiple visits - These r the gems - rest are good but these r the best in town. 

Kolkata Biryani is a version of Lucknow Dum Biryani in which the meat & the rice is slow cooked, (sometimes with milk instead of water). You get a piece of half a potato & a boiled egg as a part of The Biryani. 

The rice strands of the biryani melt in the mouth, burst with flavors of the spices & the meat & most importantly the rice strands do not stick to each other. The meat flavors are unique due to the spices used & slow cooking tenderizes the meat to an extent that it melts in the mouth. The potato is cooked with the biryani - so the flavors enter it & the egg is unnecessary but interesting & fun to munch on.

History of Kolkata Biryani: When Wazid Ali Shah, the Nawab of Lucknow was deported by the British to Kolkata, he got with an entourage of cooks, nautch girls & many more things. What has predominantly remained intact after few centuries, is the cuisine that those cooks introduced to this part of the country (with some modifications). 

Regarding the meat dishes, all of them are unique, sip water / cola between the two dishes - u will distinctly understand the differences. The meats are cooked in the gravy & hence are full of flavors. They are surely oily & not for the faint hearted. 

In case u r not sure how ur tummy's goin to behave the next day, just pop in pudin haras:)

To end it all - Your taste buddies (buds) will thank u for taking them to Arsalan - U just have to do a bit more of cardio next week to burn those extra calories:)

We went there on last Sunday [26Jun'11]. This was the first time we visited this particular branch of Arsalan. We had to wait for 20--30 minutes. The outside was quiet and waiting crowd was good. Inside ambiance is very much homely. The food quality and taste is VERY GOOD!!!! We must say that this is the best Biriyani we had in this level of restaurants. Other dishes were equally well. Every item is well cooked, easy to digest, no stomach problem. The staff are well behaved and professional. Price is reasonable [M-Biriyani Rs.100/-, M-Pasinda Rs. 140/-, Half-Ch-Tandoori Rs.120/- on date].
Some items like Hyderabadi Biriyani which they stopped making is still there in the menu. I think they should consider a smaller menu which they can deliver.
Good place [just this Circus Avenue Branch of Arsalan] to visit often.

I am not much of a Biryani person but having Biryani at Arsalan surely makes me one. I have never tasted Biryani as light as the one you get at Arsalan's.The Mutton Korma is spicy, oily and AWESOME. It is the perfect place for  Biryani lovers and also for those who do not like it. After having a plate of Biryani at Arsalan you may fall in love with the exotic Mughlai dish. Who knows what can happen!

Arsalan undoubtedly is one of the best Mughlai restaurants in Kolkata. The restaurant has a charm of its own.  The very essence of Arsalan lies in the fact that the mughal cuisines created by them has more of Nawabi elements of Bengal which is quiet different than the Awadhi or Hyderabadi style of cooking. The sumptuous biriyani's helped with a potato and egg makes it a fulfilling gastronomical extravaganza. The kebabs and the ghosht (mutton) are the best. A special kebab made by cheese and chicken ( Arsalan Special Kebab) is sure to take your breath away. Even in the din and the hustle of the crowd (which is a natural consequence  to their ever increasing popularity) it is one of the places to have mughlai in Kolkata.
