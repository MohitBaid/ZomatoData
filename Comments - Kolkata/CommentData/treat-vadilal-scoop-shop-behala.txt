First and foremost, they should immediately reprint their menu card. Each and every item costs atleast 20 bucks more than what's displayed on the wall and on the menu.

The ice-creams quality is just okay. The prices are quite high considering the quality of the ice-creams and other items. And not all the items are available all the time. Last day I looked for Smoothie but it was not available, so I had to manage with Chocomania.

Location is near Tawa fast food center on Banamali Naskar Rd.

Location: Lane opposite to BEHALA THANA, Walk for 4-5 minutes & this amazing Ice cream Shop will be there on your left :) 
Ambience: Small area with a seating capacity of 6 people. Decorated nicely with Soft Toys. Staffs are well behaved. 
Ice Cream: They ve got a wide variety of scoops, a lot to choose from. A new thing, ICE CREAM CAKE is worth giving a try.we ordered FRUIT & NUT (DOUBLE) SCOOP. It tasted 'dayum'. Strawberry Ice cream scoop garnished with gems, strawberry sauce and nuts. The other scoop of Butter Scotch was garnished with chocolate sauce and nuts. The rates are very reasonable.Cravi'n badly for AMAZINNGGGGG ICE CREAM SUNDAE? This place is the best option to come to. ;)

In recent times, ice-cream parlour cum cafes are springing up in Behala and 'Treat Vadilal Scoop Shop' is latest entry in the food scenario of Behala. 

This shop is located in Banamali Naskar Road. This outlet is quite small, and has seating arrangements for four people. The shop also sells stuffed toys. 

I went to this outlet yesterday at 6.45 p.m. There was one man in the shop. I ordered one chicken cheese sandwich first. The chicken cheese sandwich was made and served within ten minutes. The sandwich was crispy and delicious. The amount of cheese in the sandwich was generous. But the chips served with it was soggy. The management should look into this. 

Up next, I ordered one 'Cookie Feast Sunday'. One scoop of cookie ice cream was topped with nuts, choco chips, gems and chocolate sauce. This was delicious. The cookie ice cream itself was delicious and the toppings made it a more delicious dish. 

Finally, I went for their 'Hot Choco Dip'. Vanilla ice-cream was topped with hot chocolate sauce, caramel, nuts, chocolate chips etc. This was a delectable item. The melting of the vanilla ice-cream in the hot chocolate sauce was a grand view. 

The staff was well-behaved and amiable. All in all, a good outlet and I will visit again.

Have tried both the triple sundaes.... really nice... 1triple sundae is good enough for 2 ppl. the choco smoothie was ok..... There is a large variety of ice creams to choose from and easy on your pocket!
Definitely worth a try!
