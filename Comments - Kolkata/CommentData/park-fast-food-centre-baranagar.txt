a roadside fastfood centre at baranagar..and serves some good rolls,chicken pakoras ,chowmein etc..its quite a great food outlet nearby...
i went with Ak here while going to our driving classes and tasted their double chicken and egg roll..and their chicken chowmein..i liked the roll it was not at all oily and they donot give those sauce ..i dont like the sauce..i liked the chowmein as well..it was quite a filler..

they serve quite fast and mostly atake away joint though they have a small sitting arrangement..here the rolls are quite cheap and one roll is enough to satisfy one's apettite..i liked this place would visit here again..
