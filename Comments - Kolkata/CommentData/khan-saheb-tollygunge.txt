Had a very bad experience here! went their with my bf and his family in an ashtami night because we had to get away from the rain! Needless to say that we expected mediocre food since it was the pujas but what we got was nothing but utter CRAP!! we had ordered tandoori chicken, parts of it were completely undercooked, 4 plates of mutton kasa which had 2 small pieces each, too spicy! lastly nan and chicken rezala! the rezala was just some liquid rubbish and when I tore a piece of chicken there was blood in it!! I'm only giving 1 Rating because of the nun! They served the food in foam plates and charged us 1500 bucks for that shit!! I don't even wanna start on the ambience! So not going back there!!!!

Rolls are actually good. However not really up to the mark. Chicken egg roll is very good. But can't take up the risk to taste the other items.

Below average food and service. Dude, they'll almost rob you, take loads of money from you and will serve you below average food. We had mutton biriyani, chicken biriyani fried rice and chilli chicken. All of them were below average. Indian mothers cook better than them. Guess what, they'll not even serve free water! You have to buy bottles of water. The tables don't have any sauce, salt, pepper or anything and served the food in a thermocol plate! Dude, that's cheap. Never visiting this restaurant again in my life.

Hey friends we just visited Khan Saheb's food joint which is near Anwar Shah Road. They serve delicious food rich in legacy and authentic flavors. I would definitely recommend you the to try the North Indian and Mughlai Cuisine served in this place. Not only is this place pocket friendly but also rich in quality.

This place is very close to my house and so have been there multiple times. The  quality of food this food serves, depends upon time. A few times the biryani they served was one of the best Biryani's I had, and sometimes the quality was very bad. Basically it has no quality check on the food. But rolls, etc are always good!

The restaurant is pretty ordinary regarding service, ambience as well as food. SO that isn't what you should look up to. In fact, the roll counter is the one which keeps it going. The rolls were simply awesome. Worth a try and they were medium priced, not very costly. I don't know why it's stated in Tollygunge area I believe it's closer to Rabindra Sarobar. So, I guess they should change the location.

The double chicken roll had quiet a lot of chicken chunks in it. The service was pretty fast, keep up the good work.

Located opposite to the charu chandra police station this small outlet of khan saheb is the closest biriyani place from my home.It has very small dining area so taking away is better option. After visiting this one several times I was a bit confused whether it's good or bad.

2 years back I ate here a chicken biriyani @for the 1st time & liked it very much.But a month ago when took that chicken biriyani with real good hope, it was disappointing. The quality of food has decayed astonishingly here. I also didn't like the chicken rolls and kebabs here.

Today is 3rd Feb, 2017.This evening had their chicken roll once again & it was really delicious. So, I am updateing the rating from 2.5 to 3stars!

Visited today. Worst restaurant i have ever visited. The man taking the order had no clue whatsoever neither to the items available nor the compositions. He was running around taking orders simultaneously from many tables just to jumble everything up. He seemed to understand neither bengali nor hindi. After painstaking 10mins of explanation, he finally understood. Now the twist. He said mutton biriyani was not available, just chicken. Later we found that mutton biriyani was amply available. The chicken biriyani(special) we ordered was pathetic with two small hard pieces of chicken and 1 diminutive piece of potato. The chicken pieces were rock solid---it was impossible to put a tooth through. The rice was also poor in quantity and quality. Next twist. We had ordered chicken chap and chicken dopiaza one plate each. The side dishes came exactly 20mins after the biriyani was served, by the time we were done through half the biriyani. The side dishes were even worse. Dopiaza and chap gravy was the same!!! A yellowish brothy gravy that tasted damn sour. Where on earth do you expect chicken chap and chicken dopiaza being served in the same damn gravy? When we complained, they said it was due to extra dahi. We are pretty sure it was stale and fermented. Here again, the chicken pieces were rock solid and had to be discarded. In a nutshell, worst restaurant of the city. Never visit this place.

Khan Saheb has played the savior to innumerable house parties and stay overs with friends. Their biriyanis and kebabs are an absolute hit with the night owls. 

We generally load up on as many variety of kebabs as possible from this specific outlet, right before the stay over madness starts. Some of our favorites include the chicken tandoori, reshmi kebab, malai kebab, and the tangri kebabs. 

For mutton enthusiasts in the group, the gosht banjara and the roganjosh are a must. In case that you are looking for some spicy chicken sides, then the best options are, the chicken lababdar and the tikka masala. 

Scoop these rich gravies up with some nice tandoori rootis, some chilled cokes on the side and you are all set to have the best house party ever.

Khan Saheb - A good place to do Home Delivery from.
=====
Intro + Location : 
Khan Saheb had been on my wishlist since quite a long time now. I had been planning to visit this outlet whenever i was crossing the sarobar metro station. Nevertheless, i could not visit but did a home delivery from this outlet when some friends had dropped in to my home. It is located very near to the Charu Market Police Station and has been providing tasty food at quite reasonable cost.¬†
=====
What i ordered:

1) Chicken Reshmi Kebab - The kebabs were soft but could have been more tender. Nevertheless, was not bad at all. If you are planning to visit khan saheb, dont miss out on this one.¬†
#musttry

2) Chicken Tikka Kebab - If you like spicy kebabs, this should be your choice. It was quite spicy and i really loved the preparation. #musttry

Both these kebabs were perfectly packed and served to us with a pack of onion salad and Green Chutney. The home delivery was also on their estimated time.
=====
Pros:

1) Reasonably priced.

2) Good option for home delivery near New Alipore Area.¬†
=====
Meal for two:The kebabs costed somewhat 300 bucks to us. The meal for two would cost around 500-650 approx.
=====
Expert Suggestions:

1) More advertisement is required.
2) More offers for the customers are required.
=====
Summary:

Food Quality 3.5/5
Food Quantity 3.6/5
Taste 3.5/5
Value for money 3.4/5¬†
=====
Conclusion:
 I would revisit this outlet again and re update my review on ambience, hygiene and more. Nevertheless, a good place to do a home delivery from if you are in a mood for some mughlai food. As it is, there are very few mughlai options near New Alipore who does home delivery for a reasonable amount.¬†
=====
Unbiased review based on "my visiting" experience.

Khan Saheb has always been my favorite when I am around Prince Anwar Shah Road. This shop makes one of the best rolls. The perfect paratha and the chicken kebabs are the keys and they also add a masala ( top secret) and lemon which add to the heavenly taste. The biryani that they serve is very good. The raita needs a special mention. Just try this place and you will come out with a satisfied tummy, that too with out leaving a hole in your pocket.

I have tried only the rolls here and nothing else ever and hence my review is based on their egg / chicken / mutton rolls only.

Needless to say they make some of the best rolls in Kolkata which is at par with Arsalan, Shiraz and Zeeshan and far better than Haji in behala.¬† What i like about their chicken / mutton rolls is that you can feel meat in your mouth when you take a bite. every bite will have at least one piece of meat in it.... and that is what my mouth is looking for! 

The only thing that i feel they could improve is the wait time for one of those rolls.¬† I understand the wait time sometimes adds to their "aura" of being an elite restaurant "where you have to wait 20 mins for¬† roll".¬† Surprising, but that kind of a reputation works wonders in Calcutta.¬† 

I have never dined in and hence cant comment on their staff, service etc.

They have a very easy location (right at the tollygunge phari junction) but on the flip side, it is VERY DIFFICULT to be able to find a parking place for your vehicle in the vicinity!!

I had a very bad experience at Khan Saheb. The peas polao was biriyani rice tossed with sugar and MSG that did not melt and crackled as we struggled to eat. The chicken reshmi butter masala had stale chicken that smelt sour and was brittle. We paid the bill and left without daring to gulp the food. I will never visit the place again.

The thing i remember about this place is that they take a full half hour to make a chicken roll. And they'll still forget to add the chilli. But the wait was worth it though, as the roll turned out to be one of the juiciest and crispiest i'd ever tasted. On another day, i decided to take home a chicken tandoori and a reshmi butter masala. I was a little disappointed, but maybe that was because of the very high expectations i already had. Moral of the story? Try the roll, but not when you're voraciously hungry. You might go mad with the wait and be tempted to eat the kababs they leave hanging out deliciously in front of the shop.

This place is the only one serving as a sit n bite eatery in this area because there aren't any within proximity except the monginis, kathleens and sweet shops.
I can't really rate this place well as I have only had their rolls the other day. The sitting area is more or less okay and the guys attending are good. Their rolls are thinner than their counterparts from many a restro,but what was nice was the taste. Yes,they make good rolls and the chicken roll is worth a mention.
Someday I'll go back for more and to mention,their prices are on the cheaper side.

I visited this restaurant several times. Kebabs are their speciality and they do tastes best. Rolls and other fast food items are awesomely tastier but i must say curry or gravy items are too spicy and doesn't tastes good. Few gravy items which need to be a bit sweeter are rather spicy which destroys the taste of the food. Khan Saheb is restaurant for casual meal for a pocket friendly budget. My Verdict- 'Good'

There is a sit and eat place upstairs but it's enclosed by glass on the front facing side so not exactly a cosy place. Other than that the kebabs (all types) are extremely good and tasty and the prices are on par with other restaurants and it's the only eatery in the locality serving such food. The chicken biriyani is also a recommendation as it is priced well and tastes it's part. If you're looking for a quick byte you must try the khan Saheb special roll (roll with kebab meat) it's like a speciality that defines the establishment although a bit pricy (75-90)

I just tried the rolls here and it was good. Good coz the chicken was better than what most other places offer. There was a slight hint of the flavor of kebab in the chicken which made it taste good. And of course the smokeness was there too. Size of the paratha and amount of chicken was average. Haven't tried other items in the menu but definitely looking forward to do so.

The name of this place sounds similar to a number of restaurants across the city serving primarily Mughlai cuisine, most of which are better than this one by a large berth. Situated on Deshpran Sashmal Road, it's on the opposite side of the road from the Merlin Towers. The cuisine is Mughlai with chicken, mutton and veg dishes. Punjabi and continental dishes are also thrown in. The nondescript chinese and seafood sections should be given a miss. The fast food section has a large selection of rolls. Out of which I'd suggest you try the incredulously priced Jumbo roll just to find out what it is.
Their claim to fame was once the Khan Saheb special Biryani and Murgh Musallam. Nowadays however, they have been eclipsed by the others in the area. Try the interestingly named Russian Tandoori chicken if you go there. I missed it on the menu and am still cursing myself for not being able to understand how russians treat their Tandoori. Price is in tune with other restaurants serving the same cuisine. Although some items fall beyond that trend. The seating area goes down from the street level to a kind of basement with two tables. Additionally, a new section having a fancier but average feel has been started on the upper floor with the same number of tables. The ambiance is nothing to boast off. Service is quite fast and the man at the register was very courteous. 

We tried the fast food section this time. The Egg Chicken Roll at 35 rupees was averagely priced. The taste was fine with a proper amount of chicken although the lemon was sprinkled with liberal zeal. The double egg roll at 50 rupees was a drag with nothing special. The Paneer roll and Chicken Roll were both regular in taste as well as price. 
The size of each roll was quite satisfying. :) 
Oil oozed out of the wrapping paper from all the rolls. :(

Chakrasborty Tip : The pair of green benches on the footpath in front of the shop belongs to the establishment. Promptly shoo away anyone other than customers sitting there and claim it as your own.

Tried this small little place today and had the worst experience,i and my friends had ordered there so called"khan saheb special biryani" (chicken) and 2 normal chicken biryani with 3 plates of mutton chap, after the food came we saw that the quantity of the special biryani was similar with that of the normal one except an extra piece of chicken for which they are charging60 extra and the taste was bland and disgusting , it was tasteless,the chap was quite lemony we did not like it at all and the ppl are quite rude as well,  street food vendors serve better food than this please avoid this place if you can because we wasted 600 rs for the worst food experience

I just tried the rolls here and it was good. Good coz the chicken was better than what most other places offer. There was a slight hint of the flavor of kebab in the chicken which made it taste good. And of course the smokeness was there too. Size of the paratha and amount of chicken was average. Haven't tried other items in the menu but definitely looking forward to do so.

The name of this place sounds similar to a number of restaurants across the city serving primarily Mughlai cuisine, most of which are better than this one by a large berth. Situated on Deshpran Sashmal Road, it's on the opposite side of the road from the Merlin Towers. The cuisine is Mughlai with chicken, mutton and veg dishes. Punjabi and continental dishes are also thrown in. The nondescript chinese and seafood sections should be given a miss. The fast food section has a large selection of rolls. Out of which I'd suggest you try the incredulously priced Jumbo roll just to find out what it is.

Tried this place a few times and the stuff is average .... nothing to rave about but certainly edible. The chicken malai kebab is decent when paired with the naan and dal tadka. The Mutton Rezala was just about average when eaten with the egg biryani , however the quality of mutton is not too good so don't have high expectations on that front. Tried out the rolls as well both chicken and egg .... just so so !!!

A good experience with mughal food. Liked the kababs of the place very much . Situated near rabindra sarobar metro station this resturant is surely attracting a large mass but the sitting arrangement is not that much large and comfortable. Tried the veg items but they were not as good as the non veg ones. Overall if you live near sarobar and not willing to go to some distant place you can try the non veg items here at a reasonable price.

Small joint on a busy road is a bliss for people of adjoining area because of the absence of any other good restaurant in vicinity.food taste is above average,price moderate and service prompt.as it has only a very small sitting space upstairs its more convinient for take aways.i would personally recommend the rolls and chicken butter masala.

This is a small little mughlai takeaway joint opposite charumarket thana but it has a little dining space upstairs and also serves chinese also. Food is decent..not extraordinary but not bad also.. different gravy items have different distinct taste and flavour..we tried their special naan (though nothing special) with murg badami pasanda and shahi mutton, we were  satisfied with the food what we got..price range is moderate and service is also quick..

The mughlai is simply superb. The dishes are priced properly the the quality can anytime out-run Arsalan or any other celebrated celebrated restaurants.
