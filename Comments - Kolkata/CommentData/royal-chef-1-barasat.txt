Have been there once. The ambience is good. Coming to the food item, I ordered a kandhari kabab and hakka moodles. The kandhari kabab was very tasty but it's a bit costly. The hakka noodles was so-so. Over all the services was good enough and it's a decent place to hang out with friends and family.

Pathetic service.. i with my friends visited this place during kalipuja.. first we had to wait almost 30-45 minutes.. shocking fact is that one cannot enter with bag.. everyone has to submit it outside counter.. there was a bald man who behaved rude.. they did not supply normal water.. we had to buy water at rate 40/ ltr.. wtf.. though the food was good.

Have been there once during durga puja. We ordered crispy chicken as the starter, prawn fried rice and chicken Manchurian as the main course. The starter was too savory. And the main course was so-so. All over the quality was good with the serving time being just okay. Again, not so spacious with a dark interiors. On an average, it's okay to visit once.

A great place to dine with family. Decent food at reasonable prices. However, the seafood can sometime get smelly.
One of the Best food are the starters and the Chinese. The Indian based foods are kind of over-rich.

Last weekend I juz dropped in for a quick dinner. We were greeted by the guard while entering and we also got a place with a view. We ordered tandoori roti, jeera rice n chicken tikka masala along with salad. Food was good and quantity was more than enough for two. The only complain I have that we got our order very late and also during the bill payment they took so long. Maybe coz of Sunday night.

Visited here few days back with my colleagues for evening food. Its located beside madhyamgram main road. Then restaurant is nice and tidy. Staffs behaviour is nice. Good ambiance. They have a quite elaborated menu. Ordered Manchurian noodles and a chicken preparation named teriyaki. Both of the items are tasty but the chicken item is so much yummy. You can visit here for once in lifetime.

Well, today I want to write in a view of an Innocent customer, who always try to avoid any quarrel,, but today I was really shocked when I noticed a restaurant named #RoyalChief at #Madhyamgram, are selling package drinking water at the double price with their dish,,,

an one litter bottle of Bisleri water which is printed Rs 20/.

and you can also notice, all the beverage think are above approx¬† x2.5

there ambience is average, not a very high class, and the food quality also average,,,

I request you to all my friends, teachers, and photographers not to visit this kind of the place anytime,, they are pilling up our in a good wrapper.

Me and mah best friend went to this restaurant for celebrate her's b-day party.. 

Location- This place located near the Madhyamgram Chawmatha.

Decoration- This place is really nice ambience and music was not loud.
      We ordered Mixed Friedrice, sezwan chili, and as a starter chicken tandoori.

Mixed Friedrice: It was obviously sufficient for two people. And this taste was good.

Sezuan chili:  It was really nice dish better then expected. But it was little much chilli type of dish.

Service- Stuffs are quite gentle and helpful also.. service was good without any delay.

It was a winter afternoon in 2015 when I visited this restaurant ¬†and faced a very unpleasant experiment. I visited the place with two of my friends and a backpack :). The hotel staffs allowed us to enter but not the backpack. They insisted that I keep my bag in the luggage locker and initially I thought the choice was entirely mine whether I want to keep it outside or carry to the table. But soon they made me realized that there is no choice, either I have to leave the bag outside or leave. I chose to leave the restaurant as I felt it was an insult to the customers . I have visited several restaurants in several cities in India but never faced this kind of rule or behavior in any of them. I feel the choice should be customer's whether they should carry their belongings ¬†to the table or not. The customers should decide whether they are feeling uncomfortable with their belongings. You may offer an option to the customers to keep their bags in the locker to ensure customers are felling comfortable but cannot force them to do. Also I was not carrying a Trolley or suitcase and there was ample space in the restaurant to accommodate 3 of us and the medium size backpack. It was extremely unexpected that you face this type of incident in any restaurant. I felt extremely embarrassed when the manager asked me to leave the place. The least you expect from a restaurant is warm behavior from the staffs which is missing in this restaurant.

When the restaurant was newly opened in this area it was really a good but as days went the quality, ambience, hygiene started declining. Today after few years i went on a special occasion and i was so upset with the whole thing. The entrance was dirty emitting foul smell, half of the food (mentioned in the menu) was not available , the quality and taste was not up to the mark . I would bot recommend anyone . I would rate 0.1/5 but the option is not available.

Though very near to my home, dined in this place very fewer times. Being one of the few good restaurants in the locality this place is good but lack of good competition bars this place to be among the best.

Place : At one of the prime locations on sodepur road, hardly 150m left to madhyamgram chowmatha (if you are going towards Barasat). Nearest land mark - beside Regent station.

I went to this place before but my recent review is for a take away order I took from them recently. I ordered mixed fried rice, Reshmi butter masala chicken and paneer kulcha. The service was quite good because they prepared the order within 20-25mins of me placing it. To mention is the food quality, which I didn't liked much, the reshmi butter masala was too sweet and the chicken was not tender as well. The fried rice was good though, it was filled with ample amount of chicken bits and prawns and the quantiy was enough for alteast 2 people. The paneer kulcha as well disappointed me.
The decor is nice, I liked the warm interior and red colors all over the place. The one thing that took my eyes was that they surfaced with an idea of customer feedback form at the end of the your meal in which they noteing down your birthday as well. I don't know how much they will use that feedback form to improve themselves, but this gesture was quite impressive.
I rate this place 3 out of 5 with areas to work and improve.

This restaurant is just 5 minutes away from my house and serves moderate food.
 The service is not that good. Food takes a long time to reach the table and staffs are never available if you want a glass of water or anything else.
Coming to what I ordered
Crispy babycorn and mushroom - spicy fries babycorn and mushroom with onions capsicum. The only dish that was tasty.
Munchurian mixed noodles - low on salt and chicken with almost no peawns this dish was disappointing . Just like any other noodles u get is streets.
Soho chicken - this this was supposed to be hot and it was but I didn't find the taste appealing. 
 Not really visiting again. I hope they improve their services and bring actual decent food in the future. 
Thank you

I have visited this place only once & found it quite okay. We ordered Sweet baby corn soups, Sezwan Chicken Chowmin, Chilly Chicken & sweet lime soda. Food quality was good, staff behavior was also good, I hope normal lunch dinner foods are also good, ambiance is good but light is dim :) .

It is a good place with descent decorations and menus. Last time I ordered butter nun, reshmi kabab, and a special item( forgot the name) which had both the chicken mutton combination.... Really it was their speciality as they told. Awesome taste. Hope next time if I get a chance to have their Chinese food they will again serve such Kind of special dishes...
