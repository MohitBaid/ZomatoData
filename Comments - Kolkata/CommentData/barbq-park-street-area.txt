Visited on newyear eve 2017,the place was fully packed but we got our table after waiting for 10 minutes...after we secured our seat.. we were enjoying the ambience... the place was well decorated...then we ordered food...we had to wait for 50 minutes approximately then we got our food... i knew kitchen was really busy....but 50minutes was too much... it was the chinese food we odered...it never took much time to prepare...So it was very disappointing...now coming to the food,

1.chicken sweet & sour soup: this soup was average in taste.. small vegetables with shaded chicken...quantity was not ok....

Rating: 3/5

2.red pepper chicken: chicken satay with red bellpepper and capcicum...it was really good... quanity was good...enough for 3people as a starter...

Rating: 4.5/5

3.chicken fried rice: this fried rice was good...flavours were really good... but i could not found chicken properly...it had very poor quantity of chicken..it looked like vegetable fried rice...

Rating= 3/5

4.mixed fried rice: though the tastes was same...but they told us there were pork,chicken , prawn in this rice...but we were unable to find pork and chicken...

Rating= 3/5

5.chicken with mushroom and vegetables: this dish was really bad...tastes bad ..not properly salted....not properly cooked...lack of spices made this dish very poor...

Rating:1/5

6.devils chicken : this item was really good in taste...perfect side dish... really good dish

Rating : 5/5

We completed the food... then we asked fo the bill...we waited for 30-40minutes to get our cheque...they don't know how to treat the people...we asked for feedback book....they said they had no feedbook book there.. then they laughing at us...their service was really poor...bad experince...i had lot off expection to this place...so it was not fullfilled

The place,ambiance,service is great.But the food disappoints me as I expected more.Hopping that they will come up with good results next time.As the prices are very reliable the place is ideal for giving treats and throwing a get together

The best thing about this place is the quantity of their food.
Courteous staff. Prompt service. Well spacious. And of course tasty food.
One plate of rice will suffice two people and might end up being left over if your appetite is not much.
Price is reasonable and to dine with both family and friends , this is a good choice.
Visit is suggested.

A great place to have a big family lunch or dinner. Food is great, so is the service. Ambiance is impressive as well. Do try out their pork dishes. But their rule of not allowing to sit on the upper floor when there's no female members in the visitors' group is cringy and disturbing.

Centrally located in park street, one of the best places to have Chinese food in the city although it has a multi cuisine section aswell, service is fast but be prepared to wait for 15-20 minutes in case planning to go in the evening. Chinese bhel is amazing and for two people approx expense should be 1k.

Went there on ekadashi (the day after bijoya dashami) and to wait for some time to get our seat. Its located just in Park street hence very easy to find out. Ambiance of this restro is amazing, and also the staffs are very courteous and helpful. We had ordered so many dishes so its very tough to remember all the names, still i will try to give details as much as i can recall.We ordered chicken spring rolls and chicken malai kebab as starters. Spring rolls were amazing though i didn't like the malai kebab that much, it was very dry and nothing that special about the taste too.We ordered two types of non veg soups, i just forgot their names, but both of them were very tasty.We then had chicken fried rice, hunan chicke, kung pao chicken, paneer butter masala and masala kulcha as our main course, and each and every dish was very niceWe finally finished off with large tutti frutti ice cream, which was also very delicious.So overall a great experience, like to visit here again. Thank you

I went for dinner on a Christmas eve with my family. Naturally , the place was packed and we had to wait for 20 mins which was understandable. We were really waiting forward for the food. But to our utter disappointment the service was very slow, the stewards were not proffesional at all . We ordered for 2 Heineken ,1 breezer and ice-cream , they gave the heineken but forgot the breezers and icecream. We had to remind them twice or thrice. The food was nothing exceptional or something to go back for. Lastly, the steward gave two napkins for 4 people and as we were done, he demanded for tips.
I don't know the reason for such a poor service or not as expected quality of food but maybe because it was a festive day and they had peer pressure or maybe some other reasons. Expected a better service definitely!

The place is nice, attracts a trendy crowd but,last time we went there the food was aweful and service was very bad. The kabab's were stale in chelo kabab. Gravy of the Szechuan chill pork was also not good. Only the Fish fingers tasted good and baby corn munchurian was little too sweet.

I visited this place on 31st night with my buddies...I had several disappointments on my first visit..The place is near the crossing of perkstreet and easy to find....The place was moderately packed...We secured our table after waiting 30 miutes...

Now coming to the ambience...The place is well decorated with rounded wooden table and dim lighting...

Now after this we had to wait for 20 minutes to give our order which was completely disappointing...
Now coming to the food...

1.CHICKEN SWEET CORN SOUP:Thick soup with shaded chicken...Quantity is not good for 1...Rated 3.5/5

2.RED PEPPER CHICKEN:Shaded chicken with bell pepper and capsicum...Medium spicy...It taste was good...Rated 4/5  

3:MIXED FRIED RICE:
They told us there are pork,prawn,chicken and egg...But we were unable to find the pork and egg...This is just disgusting....Though the quantity was enough for 2 people..Taste was good enough...Rated 3.5/5

4:CHICKEN FRIED RICE:
Though the taste were same but this was comparatively better than mixed fried rice....This was also enough for 2 people...Rated 4/5

5:DEVILS CHICKEN:I tasted this item several times in many places in kolkata....And i liked it...But this time the taste was not good...Small sizes chicken with non spicy gravy made this dish not satisfying..Rated 3/5

6:CHICKEN WITH MUSHROOM AND VEGETABLES:This dish was completely third class like as their hospitality and behaviours...The mushrooms and vegetables were not boiled properly...Rated 1/5

They don't know how to treat the people...we asked to launch the complains...then the waiters were laughing at us...The service was also very poor..After odering the food we had to wait about 1 hr for the food..And i would like to attached that we had to wait 25 minutes for the bill...Even after we asked it for many times...

service and hospitality:1/5

We went there on 31st night, had to wait a bit, waiters took time to take orders, but it was worth waiting. The ambiance was excellent with the proper sitting and dim lighting. We ordered Chicken Talu Mein Soup along with Sweet & Sour Pork. The soup was a bit bland, but I liked the Pork dish, it was tangy and the texture of the pork pieces was awesome, there were some tiny pineapple pieces in the dish which I found interesting. My friend ordered a Carlsberg beer which was served with Cheeselings. Overall it's a perfect posh dineout place, the pocket pinch is moderate, so a must visit place.

Had an amazing experience in BarBQ on New Year's eve! located at a prime location in Park Street.
We had to wait for around 20mins to get a table for 2 due to huge rush. We ordered two mixed fried rice and one Chilly Chicken Boneless. They provide food in large quantity for which we had to parcel the fried rice. There were around 12 pieces of Chilly Chicken and one plate fried rice was enough for 2. 
The decor was extremely classy and gives a retro feeling. The staircases, chairs and tables all were pertaining to the ancient British phase.
Coming to the food it was incredible. Our taste buds experienced authentic Chinese taste. Definently one cannot get enough of it and will crave for more. 
The staffs were extremely courtageous. They helped in serving. The behaviour of all the staffs were appealing. The services were very prompt. Overall the experience was something to cherish for long and more than enough to make the 1st Day of New Year special. 
Total Bill Amount : Rs 220/- (Mixed Fried Rice) 
                                 Rs 305/- ( Chilly Chicken Boneless)

Total: 440+305=  Rs 745/-
Tax: Adding Gst 5% 
Total Amount: Rs 782/-


Quality of Food :         4.9/5
Quantity of Food :      4.7/5

If you are a Chinese and continental food lover be there it's a guarantee that you will not disappointed. As the quantity is too enough for one, two people can share from one plate of noodles or rice. The quality is good. The test is awesome and the ambience is very pleasant. You can go for a romantic dinner there. The decoration is elegant too.

The sweet corn soup and hot and sour soup tasted delightful. The noodles was well made and so was the chicken manchurian. Very hospitable people as well.

The food was A1, no doubt. Everybody loves BarBQ and hence the waiting time is always justified! The Ambiance is classic if you talk about it. Amazing lighting. Amazing mood. Amazing Vibes. 

The food is flavourful and the quantity is great. Is not on the expensive scale considering the hype, which is a good thing. 
The service, was not very impressive. It took a lot of time to get a basic order of Veg Noodles and Pork Manchurian.

Nonetheless I'd say the taste and the quantity was worth it.

This place has surely turned as one of favourite places to eat in Kolkata. We went there on Christmas eve for family dinner. For sure that you can get the best food there
 Everyone should try their mushroom as starter and pork for side dish. Their bar-b-q special fried rice was also commendable. Although having a huge rush that day they served us profusely. There was nothing I can complain about. I suggest that everyone should visit this place.

Bad service..went there on Christmas and ordered 2 Heinekens and a breezer..only the Heinekens came and we had to keep reminding them about the breezer..had to ask for the ice cream for 3 times then finally the ice cream came..rude steward..he spoke as if he is giving us a treat..
Service was pathetic yet at the time of leaving they demand for a tip...
We were 4 ppl in a group and when we asked for tissue paper they gave us just 2pieces..
The table was untidy with sauce all over...disgusting experience

One of the oldest restaurants in Park street with an ambience and decor going back to the colonial era. Their staff are absolutely superb and take good care of you while you are here. The Chinese they serve is awesome. They also serve North Indian cuisine. The quantity is on the higher side and pricing is reasonable. A must visit this festive season with family and friends.

Its a wonderful place to hangout with your friends or family. The food is exceptionally good and the services offered are praiseworthy. Though there might be a delay in orders due to heavy rush but you can calm yourself down with a few drinks to go with. Overall, this place offers great food, finest spirits and a good ambience.
I have been a regular visitor to this place and I must say the chinese delicacies are something you really don't want to miss. They have a wide variety of Chinese delicacies which are utterly delicious. We had ordered Mixed Hakka Noodles which consisted of Chicken, Prawns and Pork. 
We had ordered Hunan Chicken which went pretty well with the noodles. The perfect combination of taste and presentation.
For starters we had ordered Crispy Chilli Chicken Which is one of the iconic dishes of this place. The prices of the spirits are also priced reasonably so you can have a great time with your friends at a price which doesn't hurt your wallet. Overall, a must visit.

Visited on Christmas Eve 2017, the place was moderately packed and we got our table after waiting for about 20 minutes, which is acceptable.
Once we placed our orders, only a part of it was received due some misunderstanding between the manager and waiters. As a result, we had to waste about 45 minutes and reorder the food again.
Coming to the food, the spiced pork is amazing, so is the veg scezwhan noodles and chilli garlic pepper chicken. The portions is adequate to be shared among 3. I highly recommend the food, the management disappointed me.

We went there as a group of 6. After one month long exams our main purpose was to chat. We ordered chicken reshmi kebab, chicken sheek kebab, veg fried rice, chicken reshmi masala, chicken Hakka schezwan chowmein, chicken in hot garlic sauce and tutti frutti ice cream. Food was extremely good and tasty. Quantity was quite sufficient. But what dissatisfied is was their delivery time. They took around an hour to deliver the main course, half an hour to deliver ice cream and 20 minutes to deliver the bill itself. Now you can understand the cause behind such rating.

Yesterday we had a visit over here at 7:15 p.m, I would like to comment food quality decreased than before....( Might b due to Christmas time).... Service was quite poor.... Some items like hot brownie with ice cream was not available though it was Christmas time.... In chilli prawn , the prawn balls was stuffed to much with cornflour, so the taste horrible... In fried rice the prawns used was not clean properly.... Same excessive cornflour stuffing in golden fried prawn.... 

I would like management to look into this matter, ... Cz if it continues in this way it should bring a bad effect....

The food is undoubtedly one of the best in town, but at the same time, the management is the worst in the world. 

The managers are some unapologetic, rude and unprofessional idiots who keep their guests waiting by allowing them only to a partial segment of their restaurant during peak hours, while the rest remains unoccupied and waiters are seen roaming around and even taking naps on the sofa.

Horrendous experience. During holiday season and too in the evening at 5:30 pm only the front section is open and rest all are closed. There is a long queue of people waiting and the management repeatedly tells us that the place can’t be open. Management is rude and impolite. They have the attitude that they care a damn. But this place should be made aware of the event that took place in a Park Street restaurant

Would have given 0 star if there was an option. Visited this restaurant on a Saturday afternoon. Place was moderately packed. Since we were a group of 16 and on our maiden visit to Kolkata, we were recommended this place by a friend and
hence after a hectic sight-seeing experience, visited this place to wind down with super hungry people but all our expectations were washed down by an imbecile manager who was not even ready to accept take our reservation. There were hardly 10 people in the queue but the manager kept on saying that they are full and won't accept us just because we are more than 8. We even suggested to split the tables into 4, but the manager was not even ready to listen to any suggestions as well. 

I asked them to talk to the senior manager but that person completely turned his back to us and ignored and we asked to leave the restaurant very rudely by the manager.

By far the most rude and pathetic service ever by a restaurant. Such places who do not have concern to their customers do not even deserve to open their own business.
Will not ever recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Giving it a four now as the management gets paranoid when there's too much of rush and waiting- this can be improved

It was 18th of Dec.And we decided to go there on a cold evening.This probably the most crowdy food hub of parkstreet. The vintage look of staircase and the interior surprised me. Ambience is classy. Coming to the food, we ordered chilli garlic pepper chicken as starter, Bar-B-Q special mixed fried rice and Kung Pao chicken as main course. Each of the dishes was awesome. The most satisfactory chinese lunch ever. The mixed fried rice was full of prawn,chicken,egg and mushrooms. Loved the whole meal. Lastly we ordered fruit salad with ice cream.
Overall happy we were✌. Staffs were helpfull, but they frequently asked for tips, which was not a good experience for me. Otherwise keep it up guys. Cheers🍻✌

What I absolutely love about Kolkata is the quality of food you get there! Very few places in India have great food everywhere and Kolkata is one of those cities that don't disappoint you! I went to BarBQ for dinner! We were confused about where to go for good Chinese and this was right next to my hotel! So we walked down the lane and went into a really nice vintage restaurant! This is an old timer and everyone from the staff knew my friend! He ordered the pork chilly, the golden fried prawns, a crispy chicken and some chicken dimsums! For main course we went straight with the pan fried noodles and human chicken! We had to pack somenof the food but we're so greedy that tried our best to eat it! In all I absolutely loved the chisene here! This place is a must try!

Visiting this place in parkstreet is now regular for me...if you are opting to go and have food then try not to go on weekends it is very crowded n you might not get a table. The food is so nice specifically Chinese. But one thing they serve is the kaali Dal and butter naan which is so good that I forget having Chinese and I have these whenever I go there.

Heard a lot about this place, but frankly I was let down. Part street is dotted with many a fine restaurant, and this one has a lot to catch up to. Firstly, having to wait despite a section of the restaurant being empty. Further, there is no proper waiting area or a queue management system, like its neighbours offer. This would have been negligible, had the service been the least bit satisfactory. Restaurant service is not just about showing you to the table and handing you a menu. It'a also about little but important things like noticing that the table has no napkins, or that the glass is lying empty, and knowing if an item is available or not before taking the order. Sadly, BarBQ failed on all these aspects. Let's not even talk about the slow delivery, which gives the impression that the noodles had to be flew in from China. Slow delivery would have still been justified it the quality of food was up to the mark. The pork was sort of ok, though a tad under cooked. The noodles seemed to be robbed of any form of taste it could have had, except being heavily salted. Sorry, but I wouldn't think of another visit to this place again.

Barbq located at the heart of the city of Kolkata becomes a favourite dining option for all. it has maintained its consistency for ages now. The old charm of the restaurant attracts us the most. The service and the food is so good. The rice noodles, chilli garlic chicken and the shezwan fish is worth the try. The best part is the service is really fast and good. Only recommendation is please book a table before you go as you will have to wait for a long time.

A good variety of alcohols available but not so pocket friendly.
Ambience is good and has very comfortable seating arrangement. Good place for a family dinner. The captain who took our order was extremely polite.
Though the food is good here but, it is a bit expensive restaurant but quantity is more than enough for two people. Thanks!

Saturday dinner was there at BarBQ. The dinner was really awesome. One of the best places to eat Chinese in Kolkata. We ordered Drums of Heaven and Chicken Spring Roll for starters. They were just too tasty !! The Chicken Sweet Corn soup was the best I had in Kolkata. We ordered Chicken Rice Noodles, Fried Rice and Szechwan Chicken. All were so good. And special mention about the Szechwan Chicken. The flavour was so nice and accurate. To finish it off we had Choco Brownie with ice cream which closed our innings with a feel-good note.

Staffs and their service needs special mention as well. 

Must visit for all. 

P.S.- They also serve North Indian and Mughlai Food.

Pros : Super spacious

Service is fine 
Food is great especially Chinese and desserts. 
Good portion size

Do try: Crispy konjee lamb,fish finger is a must, chilli chicken, chicken teriyaki,red pepper chicken, bbq special rice, chili honey potato,hot chocolate fudge. 

Con: not a place for Indian. It's very average and will seem over priced. 
Finding seats can be an issue despite it being a big place. That's because of it's prime location and popularity. 
Sometimes services lag

Bar-B-Q is certainly among the classiest of restaurants in Kolkata, in terms of food (Chinese and North Indian), ambiance, waiter service and interiors.

I was delighted to have some of their wonderful Chinese dishes recently:
◽Sczechuan Chilli Pork,
◽Chicken with mushrooms,
◽Mixed non-veg noodles.
The dessert section is also worth a mention:
⏺Caramel custard and ⏺Butter Scotch ice-cream were both great to end the meal with. Quantity per dish is more than sufficient for 2 people.

The waiters wait on their customers throughout the course. Their politeness and attention to every detail, impressed me.
Next time it will be for some finger-licking North-Indian!

During weekends make sure you book your table 30-45 minutes prior to reaching this restaurant as there is always a huge rush for the tables.

Built in the colonial era, this mammoth of a joint in the heart of Park Street is something you can't miss if you're trying to get into the food scene of Kolkata. 
Everything about this place has that classy old school style that gives you the most beautiful hearty feel. 
Food is really good and in the most generous proportions. Everything comes in large, hot bowls that can't possibly be finished by one person ever. Ideally, the main meat dishes can easily feed 2-4 people. The pork dishes are worth dying for. 
Must mention the sliced chilly pork and the kung pao chicken. Also, the crispy chilly mushroom for starters is just so very good. 
Booze is on the cheaper side. 
Service is courteous but a little slow, we like to call it regal and anyway, that leaves one with more time to spend which is always going to go good in this space!

This place needs no introduction. This is one of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata. And also one of the famous restaurants in the Park Street Area. This place is always busy throughout the year. Yesterday we managed to get a seat there for lunch. We were lucky enough to get a sit on the upstairs. It was a cozy and comfortable place with around six tables. Otherwise the restaurant is spacious including both the upstairs and downstairs. The staffs were courteous and equally helpful. Now coming to food we ordered Szechuan Chilli Pork and Devil's Chicken. We ordered three Tuborg Strong beers and one cocktail, that is, Screw Driver. Foods were extremely tasty and were perfectly cooked. Surely coming back soon to try their main course dishes from the menu. :)

With the ratings and reviews firmly in its favour, went there after the initial choice turned out to be a tad disappointing. Service is slow. That said it's  a place to hang out and have a good time. Good food, decently priced bar menu it has become a fall back place just in case not in a mood to be adventurous and try out any new place

Food- one of the best chinese you can get in kolkata. Must try- manchow soup, american corn, chilli garlic noodles, burnt fried rice.
Location- Park street, being the array of the most famous restaurants.
Service- good
Price- decent, approx 400 per head. Value for money.
Tip- the place is huge but is still crowded every single day. You may find a table soon on weekdays, but on weekends, you might have to wait for atleast 1 hr.

This is one of the oldest restaurants in Park Street area. They have a huge dining area with numerous food options. Usually they direct people upstairs where they have segmented and escalated dining areas. Overall, their entire dining area is pretty much interesting and also complex if you're looking for someone already waiting for you and occupying a table.

Their staffs are very courteous. They usually deal with their customers in a nice manner. But we found a staff complaining loudly to his fellow staffs on not getting any tips. And, this is something that isn't expected from them.

Now let's come to the taste of the food. We ordered Bar B Q Special Rice, Red Pepper Baby Corn, Tsing Hoi Chicken and Thumbs Up. The baby corn was extremely disappointing as it was stiff and almost tasteless! But the rice and the chicken were extremely tasty. They asked us if we would like to have pork in the rice. The price is on the higher side. They charged Rs. 70 just for a 200 ml. cold drink! All the dishes were above Rs. 200. But this place is a must try if you like exploring oldest restaurants of Kolkata.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: 1000 for two (approx.)

Visited this evening for evening snacks alongwith few drinks. Astonished to find that Mojito, one of the common cocktail, was not available. Ordered chilly pork and chilly garlic pepper chicken and two pegs of Bacardi. Menu prices have been changed upwards post GST reduction to 5%. Food was ok. Nothing special. Service moderate. Quantity is very good. Oh one more thing! Rs 70 is too much for 300ml soft drinks.

its the name synonymous with chinese food in kolkata. the only restaurant in kolkata, perhaps, to have waiting throughout the 365 days. their chinese salad is a speciality. so is chilly garlic noodles and veg manchurian . and chopseuy. until a couple of years back, Bar B q had kept their menu prices relatively low but not any more. i think they revise their menu upward twice a year at least, which should not be the case. i noticed that sticker has been pasted on their menu card. and when i compared the prices with the now uploaded menu at zomato itself, i find a 5 percent upward revision has taken place post GST reduction. still, one of my all time favourite. meal for 3 will cost you around 1100 without alcohol.

Several dissapointments in one visit. First they have two divisions to the restaurant. The upper floor looks good but is meant only for family. The bottom is a dungeon if you're a male group. I ordered Kung Pao chicken which was super sweet, as if every bite was dipped in honey. Corona is the only imported beer in the menu but unavailable. I had to leave my bloody mary after one sip. Bloody Mary tasted like rotten tomato soup with no hint of alcohol although the waiter said it had the cheapest vodka. +1 for the service. This review might not be representive of the top floor food and service. I think people are going in, filling themselves with the cheap booze and reviewing this restaurant so highly. Nothing to my liking there.

I am sure that you must have heard about or rather already visited Bar B Q. I have been visiting this place ever since 1994.....nearly twenty five years now. It is one place which is full even on weeknights despite its huge covers. Its USP is it has been serving amazing Indian and Chinese food. Patrons can mix and match from both menus. The frills are few but the service and food are top notch. My favourite starters are Hakka Paneer...crispy baby corn....spinach dim sums...veg spring rolls....chinese salad....dahi kebabs...paneer tikka and many more. The main course is excellent as well....the dal makhni can compare to the famed dal bukhara. The breads are well baked and light. The chinese food too is always perfect...cantonese or hakka types both are available. Do visit this iconic place in kolkata...reach at 730pm or be ready to wait for a while. A special word for Mr. Stephen....an old friend and the Floor Manager of the Chinese section.

Being one of Kolkata's pride in serving sumptuous food since decades, BarBQ did not let me down as always. Their warm hospitality, and extremely neat interiors and systematic service will immediately life up your mood. I've been here twice in 2 months with my parents. On our first visit we tried veg Hakka Noodles and Chicken Manchurian. The quantity was more than enough. Coming to the quality,it is the best among all the chinese joints I've tried so far in kolkata. Not too greasy, or saucy, lip smackingly good food and amiable staff. Full points on cleanliness. 
On our next impromptu visit we tried the North Indian delicacies that were on the menu. We had ordered, Fish tikka and Chicken Tandoori for starters and butter chicken with tandoori rotis for the main course. 
And boy we were surprised. Having being  one of the best Chinese joints in the city since years , they stand out for their Indian menu as well. Every dish was extremely flavourful. The fish was fresh, juicy nicely smoked. So was the chicken, not too dry not too spicy. Just like you'd want to enjoy it. 
The prices are decent for the quantity and quality that they offer I would say. 
BarBQ has standards and it has successfully maintained them over the years. Looking forward to more such visits.

This is THE safest and greatest place in the city for a pocket friendly, decent, yummy meal. One cannot go wrong at BarBQ while ordering food, as the chances of ordering something not tasty are very low. The Chinese and Indian are both up to the mark and they definitely serve one of the best dal makhanis in Kolkata. The red pepper chicken is a must try, too. The seating space is ample and the management is polite. Overall, a great place to go to!

BarBQ has always been the best since it's inception. A restaurant which is reasonable, and serving best quality. However in my last few visits in BarBQ, I have noticed the waiters asking openly for tips( even when the customer is not paying by him or herself) Tips is a choice and not a request. Kindly teach the waiters the same.

The food was great as was the ambiance

Best time to reach is 7 pm ... else get ready to wait.

Must try the prawn starter and the main course prawns in Hot bean sauce. The mixed meats pan fried noodles are phenomenal as is the sesame fried chicken ( starters ) ... we ate a lot ... a lot of great food.

4/5 is what I would easily give it everytime ... but never a 4.5 ... till they ditch the basa on the menu with Bekti  ( fish) in the Chinese Menu.

A place that offers you value for money. Dimly lit interiors, cosy chairs, great service and good food at a very reasonable cost will surely make you feel good. Although I do not like all their Chinese preparations, the Pan fried mixed noodles in gravy, Sliced chilly pork and Chilly chicken are both my and my hubby's fav. The cocktails are average, have tried the Screwdriver (vodka with orange juice) here. Sweet corn chicken soup was bland. Overall a nice try in Park Street however, better to go for few tried and tested items rather than random experimentation so far the menu is concerned. Best part, its cheaper than its other counterparts in park street.

I've liked both Chinese as well as Indian food at BarBQ. Please be aware of their humongous quantities before ordering as you might not finish even half of the food. And all this at a very value for money pricing.
P.S. make sure to try their chello kebab, trust me Peter cat is overrated!

It was a fine Saturday evening when I planned to celebrate my birthday along with a couple of my close friends. And, I never repented celebrating it over here. The restaurant is a perfect blend of aristocratic ambience, family friendly place, great staff, superb food quality and stunning decor. No wonder we did encounter a lengthy queue of gastronomes.
Located at the heart of Park Street, this place boasts of its legacy of fine food and decor. On entering the place we encountered a wooden staircase which gives you early vibes of the great time that waits you. Yes, we were indeed greeted by a palatial ambience and some of the most well behaved and deligent staff I have seldom encountered. These people do go a long way to maintain the legacy. 
We were allocated a fine corner seat over another raised flooring which gave a fine view of the whole restaurant. Coming to the food; in starters we had ordered red pepper chicken and chilli garlic pepper chicken. Both were stupendously appeasing to the taste buds. The food was well cooked and a perfect delight of the seasoned spices in proportion. In the main course we had ordered Bar-B-Q special fried rice and schezwan chilli pork which firmly stood upto our expectations both in quantity and quality. Overall the place is a total value for money and ambience.

This is undoubtedly one of the finest Chinese dineout in Kolkata - if you leave out the Tangra area, that is.
On festive season, it's very hard to get a table for 2 guys in the main floor. We were instead taken to the floor below, which was a cool place to smoke and drink a few Kingfishers.
After the chakna and the daaru, we ordered the main course. Kung Pao Chicken is a must have when you're in BarBQ. We ordered Chicken Fried Rice with it.
The food was served in about 20 mins. The fragrance of the rice and the taste of the chicken was awesome. The quantity was sufficient for 2 people. I would definitely come again to try out their other dishes 💗

Located beside well known "the park". It has a very nice and cozy ambience. Unfortunately no music was playing and the chattering was on a high note. 
Staffs were well dressed, well mannered and professional.
Foods-
1. Hakka chicken : Nice blended mixed herbs with the right balance of garlic and chopped green chillies. The chicken was crispy and absolute tender inside.
Had this with a couple of nice green apple vodka.
2. Chello kebab : Wanted to try this here after Peter Cat. The kebabs were a bit dry otherwise its good.
Overall it was a nice experience. Surely will head there again.

Bar BQ definitely needs no introduction. It is one of the legendary restaurant in Kolkata. The food here is of top notch quality. And their courteous staff never fails to please their guests and strive to render the best service.
I visited this place with my friends. As it was  weekend ,almost all the tables were occupied so we had to wait for some 5 -10 mins .
Then as we entered the place,we were greeted very pleasantly by the staff .
We were seated on the 1 st floor. Ambience was soothing . It provided a environment where you can relax and calmly have you food .

Talking about the food ,we ordered
 1.chilli garlic hakka noodles- The noodles had a distinct flavour of garlic and was perfectly done.
2.Schezwan fried rice- It was so yummy that it will make you crave for more.
3.Veg manchurian 
4 . Chilli paneer-Both of these dishes was okay in taste.
5.Crispy fried chicken- This one is my favourite. The chicken pieces was so crisp and perfectly coated with sauce that it will mesmerize your taste buds.

Devil's chicken was was good, small chicken breast pieces with bell peppers, quantity wise more than enough for two of us. Chicken wings was average. Beer is little costly here. Had good crowd gowers, not a typical booze place but good for a cozy dine out.

The food was okay, up to the mark and as is expected in a place of such reputation. The person who took our order seemed a tad indifferent to our enquiries regarding non spicy items on the menu.
The quantity is quite a lot and any plate is quite enough for 2 people. So we requested the 'Chicken with Mushroom and Vegetables' that unfortunately we had hardly been able to taste to be packed.
Sadly, all we found at home were the mushrooms and vegetables. No chicken. Strange..! 🤔

So i have to say this but if anyone is planning give this restaurant a visit i suggest you don't! I would also like to remind The Team Of Bar BQ about the basics of this industry is that YOU SHOULD NEVER BE RUDE TO THE GUEST! I HOPE YOU ATLEAST TAKE A NOTE OF THIS REVIEW AS A REVISION OF THE BASIC ETHICS OF THE HOTEL AND RESTAURANT FOOD AND BEVERAGE INDUSTRY! BUT IF YOU DON'T THEN IT WON'T TAKE MUCH TIME FOR THE BRAND OF BAR-BQ TO GO DOWN AND THE RESTAURANT TO GO FOR A SHUT DOWN!

Walked into this brand chain at Nabami night. Huge bustling was seen. We registered our names at about 11 pm and was offered our table about 12.20. And our eyes rested on a good number of people who were still standing for their turn . As soon as we were provided our table, a courteous waiting staff came to take the order. We ordered Fried red pepper chicken as starter and fresh lime soda. In mains we ordered Szechuan Chilly chicken and Mixed Fried rice.
Each and every item was delectable. Satisfied with both Quality and Quantity . I liked the mixed fried rice the most.

Conclusion: Both price and worthy food tempt me to pay a revisit here. The management leaves no stone unturned to make your visit memorable. Rs 550-600 per person. Not heavy on Pocket against the quality and quantity.

After grand celebration of diwali, comes Bhaiya soon/Bhai dooj and we decided to go to bar-b-q restaurant in park Street. Since we were 12 ppl and the restaurant is generally crowded on weekends, I tried to reserve in advance but to no avail as the authorities told it's first come first serve basis during weekends. 
So, we reached the restaurant at 6.30 pm but we weren't allowed to go inside and stopped by the head-waiters (in black coat).It was 7.30 pm when they allowed us inside- the whole restaurant is empty but still they said it's reserved n can't give rooms for a bigger group( what the hell! When reservation was not allowed, how come the seats are reserved). The men in black coats were rude and misbehaved with us and least bothered about the queries/questions we asked. In particular, one man in black coat Mr. Steven ( the manager himself) shouted n misbehaved in front of other ppl when asked to exchange the seating location with small group who were occupying 8 seater arrangement! 
Wat more - the food we ordered was cold and tasteless! We ordered wattip babycorn as starter and fried rice(which was not cooked properly) and noodles in main course. Devil's choice gravy had a lot of salt in it. Worst and a disappointing experience.
Only food doesn't matter in a restaurant but the behaviour of the staff with the customers also matter- if this is the way they behave with the customers, I guess it's not long when ppl will choose other restaurants over bar-b-q. Request you to please learn some etiquette ! 
It's off my list and will not recommend anyone to go to this restaurant!

We visited this place on a Monday evening, and believe it or not the place was so busy, it seemed to be a holiday night! I had heard a lot about the fantastic chinese cuisine of BarBQ, and it lived up to my expectations every single bit! :)
The staff are courteous and they make it a point to help you out in placing your order!
So we ordered chicken manchow soup, golden fried prawn, BarBQ special fried rice, chicken in hot garlic sauce and sliced chilli pork!
AMAZING! All the dishes were really very well-prepared! Nothing seemed to be extra or less! I really really enjoyed my dinner!
Eventhough we were very full, we ordered desserts too --- tuti-fruti and vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce!
That's what we call "happiness on the plate" 😁

It was one of my favorite destinations till yesterday... what a mismanagement.. we had to wait for one hour to get water.. one particular floor manager behaved like a crackhead.. he was behaving hysterically... & finally hit my shoulder with their heavy black tray in his useless excitement... they couldn't serve freshlime soda since "the lemon was to be bought from market" as said by their waiter... although the food quality was same as before but the ambience totally resembled with fish market. Not going to visit anytime soon.

After a rainy Diwali night this was our choice of place for dinner and a wonderful dinner it was. We were 3 and ordered 1 starter and 3 main course. The Drums of Heaven really felt heavenly in our empty stomachs. The BarBQ Special Fried Rice was perfectly cooked. The taste and the amount of meat was perfect to the T. Kung Pao Chicken was as it usually tastes but the chicken really tasted good. Last was Mixed Hakka noddles. It was a little oily and salt was to the higher end. But it too tasted good.

Overall very happy with the food. The service was welcoming. And not to mention the quantity of food was overwhelming. A perfect end to a soaked Diwali.

BarBQ is one of the places of Park Street which was on my bookmark list. So we went without thinking much.
We ordered
Chicken spring Rolls
Chicken Fried Rice
Prawn Fried Rice
Schezwan Fish

Schezwan Fish was extremely delicious. Other items were also tasty. Chicken Spring Roll was little let down, because of its quantity.

Now when the food is managable, what worst was the behavior of Head waiters(There were two types of waiters - one who were in black coats and the others in white shirt who served the food). And take note here... I am talking about the waiters who were in Black coats. I don't know from where they learned to behave with customers. Man! I have explored a hell lot of restaurants, I seriously haven't seen those type arrogance. Whatever we asked from the menu, he said it will be late. BarBQ! Please teach them how to behave ... Food is not all that matters in restaurant... Behavior is a crucial part... If you don't improve on this, it's not long that people will prefer other restaurants over BarBQ.

Otherwise I have no such complaints about food. It would have been an awesome experience, but you guys didn't let that happen.

The quantity is pretty good and it is a well known place to all the people of the city and really does not need any introduction.

Went there few days back. It was a secind time. Located on park street. Fortunately we didnt have to wait for a table. The staffs were helpful. Ambiance is very nice. We ordered singapore five spice chicken, non veg thai rice, mapo tofu(minced lamb with gravy). 

The five spice chicken is no standout. Its taste is similar to crispy chicken whatsoever. Only some spring onions are added. Thai ruce and mapo tofu were good and more than enough in quantity (for two). 
For desserts we decided to hv chocolate rolls but was disappointed as it was not available. So we ordered chocolate souffle. Its texture and taste is more like a mousse. Though we enjoyed it for chocolate being there.

I went their with my family and we managed to get a table for 4 after waiting for 20 minutes and it was on a weekday. Decor was nice but seemed crowded a bit.
Wasted little time and ordered BarBQ special rice(2), Chinese Chopsuey along with Kung Pao Chicken and Szechuan Chili Pork as i found them recommended here.
Pork was outstanding in taste. One of the best pork dishes i ever had. BarBQ rice was equally good with lots of egg, chicken and pork. Besides Chopsuey and Kung pao chicken was tasty as well. Coming to quality and quantity it was more than justified. Even we had to pack. The behavior of the staffs was good and they do serve food quickly. Being an avid Chinese lover this place really livid up to my expectations.
So if you are a Chinese lover like me you can definitely try this place.

We were looking for a good place to go to while roaming around Park St and BarBQ suddenly sprung to mind. Though one of the more famous joints here, it was surprisingly empty for a Saturday evening. This review is a culmination of two visits within a week.

We were mainly here for the booze, and a large bottle of beer costs a bit much than the usual going rate. Cheeselings was the choice of 'chakna' here. 😂
We took two starter dishes, a dry chilli chicken and drums of heaven. Both were strictly average, and we were left expecting a bit better from the famous chefs of this restaurant. Strangely enough, the restaurant told us they'd take the last order by 4.30 and when we were leaving at close to 5, there was a large crowd on the stairs, waiting to go in.

All in all, a strictly so-so (fairly expensive) visit.

Me and my partner visited the place sometime back. It was Durga Puja and we targeted to go to Peter Cat. But alas! it was full. Our hunger was driving us crazy so we bulged into BarBQ. I was amazed with it's ambience. Initially I prejudiced the place but it's service and food impressed me. 
We had Tuborg with the complimentary snacks. It was cheese nimki and I fell for it. 
Then we ordered for mushroom in red sauce and drums of heaven. The food quality was really good. We were almost full but my partner ordered for mixed rice and pork. Being too full we were able to finish up the food. The quantity was well enough to serve 3.
It was a great experience being there. The service and the behavior of the staff impressed us as well.

Perfect restro for casual dining.2nd food.. barbq serves one of the best Chinese in town.ordered crispy honey chicken, kung pao fish. 
The crispy chicken was a very gd chicken dish.chunks of chicken boneless & v v tasty.the kung pao fish which was also a great dish. I loved it.quality & quantity is enough for 2.pocket friendly.. highly recommended

I have always loved this place.  Generally this place is always crowded but because the seating area is huge somehow the people are accommodated.  Their Chinese is always good.  Only once during the pujan did I find the quality going down.  But that is okay.  Such festivals always pair up  with bad food in the restaurants.  Otherwise this place has never disappointed  me.  :)

All time family place . Parkstreet and Barbq can't be a better combination.Their mouth watering starters like Crispy Chilli Baby Corn ,Dry Chilli Chicken , Chilli Pork , Lamb will give your taste buds a soothing experience and mouth watering taste .Then comes the mouth watering main courses like their signature Fried rice and Mixed Gravy Chowmein . The ambience is soothing but it's just when the place is over crowded there is quite a lot of noise here .Their hospitality is their cherry on the cake. Never gets old.

The restaurant is big enough to look like a maze. But with the stuffs directing us, it wasn't much of an issue. The only drawback was miscommunication among themselves, as one of them guided us one way, the other group directed in the opposite. But once settled, the food was good and each table was monitored by 2-3 stuffs to ensure prompt service in case we need anything. Overall it was a good experience.

Location : In the heart of Park Street Opposite to Flurys.

I visited this place today afternoon for a late lunch  and drinks with a couple of friends to celebrate the  last day of pujas.

Ambience and Dećor: The ambience is quite good,we were seated on the 1st Floor and we
got a seat after waiting for a while as there was some rush due to pujas,the ambience is quite good and the decor is simple yet elegant nothing too fancy.I like it tough.

Food: 

Chicken Gravy Noodles: This is one of the best gravy noodles I have had in a long time,very flavourful with large chunks of chicken in it. The quantity is also quite a lot, one plate is more than enough for 2 people.

Devils Chicken: This was a very good chicken dish,we opted for the dry one because we already had gravy in the noodles,it turned out to be amazing, large boneless chunks of chicken which were very tasty. Loved it. A must try if you visit this place.

Beverages:

Tuborg Strong: It was as usual good and served chilled.

Service: The service was quick considering it was a full house and our server was really very friendly and helpful.Overall great bevhaviour from the staff.

Pocket Pinch: The pocket pinch was reasonable as the dishes are reasonably priced even tough the prices were a bit hiked maybe because of the pujas.

Overall a great place to dine in with family and friends. Highly Recommended.

Visited this place with my fiance on nabami around 1pm!This was not my first time,Coz I ve been here many times but during pujas this was my first time and Im glad to have gone there😊 Firstly their staff,awesome behaviour and courteous and very friendly as always🤗 When we went it wasnt that crowded but as the lunch time had began,After 2,There was a huge que.We had ordered chicken fried wings which was tasty.Better than Kfc actually😇😇Soft juicy and tasty. We ordered 3kingfisher beers(alcohol was a bit highly priced) and for main course,We had devils chicken and chicken fried rice which was amazing.Like wow☺ They quantity and quality everything was perfect unlike other places where the quantity n quality degrades during pujas. Im glad that Bar b q had kept up with the expectations and served us really good food☺ Nabami went fine with a sumptuous meal🤗🤗
But I would suggest you to kindly change the pricing and update it to zomato so that it becomes easy for people to stalk restaurants and know the prices☺
Keep up the good work.Will definitely visit again!😊

Quality of the food is top class.. quantity justifies every penny you pay. Now, the taste may differ from okay to good. Overall the name is enough.
The bar-b-q special fried rice was very good, the Singapore chicken was also good in taste but the devil's chicken failed to satisfy our taste buds.. nevertheless it is a must visit place with good food, proper ambience and quality service.

This is the first I visited this restaurant on Ashtami night. I was lucky enough that I didn't have to wait too long to get the table. Though I wished to sit downstairs as the ambience is much more cosy but got table upstairs. Now coming to quality and quantity of food. I was afraid that the restaurants downgrade the quantity n quantity of food during puja time but it was totally different from the one I was afraid of. The quality of the food is too good. We ordered red pepper fish- I simply loved this dish, then barbq special fried rice-I expected a the dish to be a bit more spicy but it was ok (taste was good), Sliced chilli pork- This dish was also very tasty. The quantity of one plate of each food item is more than enough for two. Staffs were very courteous.

Headed off towards with very good and honest reviews, found it very good and nice place with great ambience and was managed superbly in spite of so called Pujo Rush, one improvement needed that is like a separate waiting place needed else it feels awkward that people standing nearby and peeping in and passing comments, else everything are very good will try again for sure some other day

A good ambience, a good serving by the people out there, starters are good,  but the main courses could be more tastier. although an all good feeling. But again I should say I am disappointed with their main courses. And the quality and tastes also varries according to time.

Toady we took lunch and took parcel for home - Bill No. 12010 dt. Sep 28, 2017. But after coming  home we found that 1 item was missing. We tried all the phone numbers (both landline and mobiles) provided in the bill and websites. All the phones were ringing and nobody picked up. Fortunately 1 mobile no. (under the BAR category) was picked up and the person said to call the manager Mr. Chow at 2229-8885 and disconnected. But, no. 2229-8885 was also ringing and nobody picked up. I expect after going through this review the management should call back to us.

Being located on park street, an area with lots of other restaurants to compete BBQ still has got it's charm consistent. I went to BBQ during pujo with my friend.. ! 
Just like heard from people's mouth that BBQ is great it really did outstand itself. It occupies a large space with three sections one on ground floor and the other two on top attached with balcony. Their service is really well managed as there were lots of people waiting for a table and we very soon got one. The ambience is very sophisticated and classy with dim lights hanging above the heads.  Coming to the food I ordered green garlic prawn fried rice with  side dishes of fish in sauce of your own choice (chilli oyster) and shredded lamb in hong Kong style. Just like bangalis are incomplete without fish I had to order a fish dish ! 
My favorite was the fish.it was soft and we'll cooked just the right amount of sauce to get dipped in and that too not so spicy. 
The lamb had been cooked with Chinese spices and it looked so spicy but don't judge a book by its cover. The moment I put it into my mouth it just felt like I was in China and it wasn't that too spicy. :) 
 I would have tried onto desserts but since there were other pandals to hope we left in a hurry. I had an amazingly foodfrolic experience at BBQ and sure will visit again !!

It's usually full on every restaurant during pujo but over bbq the reservation was fast once you get your name enrolled. I visited bbq over lunch with my friend. I had heard that the food is really good and it did stand out that way. We ordered garlic chilli fried rice with fish and sauce of your own choice (oyster chilli) and shredded lamb in Hong Kong style. My favorite was especially the fish, it was just the bit of non spicy we needed and the fish was well cooked. The quantity given in bbq is good enough for two to get full. A very sophisticated ambience with fast service . I really liked my experience over bbq and would like to visit again.

Located just few steps from park street crossing this place is perfect for fine dining with friends or family. We visited during pujo for our dinner and had to wait for 10mins to get our seats. Staffs were friendly and the management was efficient is handling the crowd. They have huge space inside and the ambiance is mind blowing with dim lights making the setting perfect. Well now coming to the food we ordered chilli garlic pepper chicken for starters with our drinks. For mains we opted barbq spl fried rice, barbq spl hakka noodles which comprises of chicken egg prawns pork mushroom and some veggies in ample amount and kung pao chicken which was also great. Quantity is more than enough. Surely visiting again.

One of the legendary places in Park Street, holding its reputation quite strongly and still a huge crowd puller inspite of facing stiff competition from others in this hub of famous restaurants... And to be honest, this place has surpassed my expectations...

Coming to the ambience... Its really great... It has three sections actually, with lots of sitting arrangements... Really nice place to have an outing with your family or friends or any loved one for that matter...

Coming to the food... BarBQ provides one the best chinese i have ever had!!! We ordered:-

1. Chicken fried wantons, and crispy chilli baby corn for starters: both the dishes were great... And decent quantities were provided...

2. Fish with mushrooms and vegetables: the quality of the fish was really nice... But i found this one a bit bland...

3. Sliced chilli pork: Well, it seemed this one made up for the previous one... Really, one of the best that i have had for sure.. i would definitely recommend this!!!

4. And for staples we ordered both chicken gravy and hakka chowmein: again, a decent quantity was provided. Both of them tasted good..

I have had a really nice time here... Looking forward to visiting again in future...
Keep it up BarBQ... ☺️☺️

What ever "barbeque" methods are used to come up luscious dishes, though that's a secret. My favourite multicuisine restaurant in Kolkata. The quantity said for 2 is actually for 3 members, at a price which suits your pocket. The uniqueness is in the design of the apertures, just like one room inside the other along with the array of wooden furnitures. Ideal dining place with family.

One of the best chinese food I have ever had ! Ambience is very classy. We had a Barbeque Special Rice which was really exotic yet simple with plenty of pork, prawns, mushrooms and one bowl of Garlic n Pepper chicken which is really good for people like me who cannot tolerate even a bit of spice and too much of oil n masala. They serve near about 10 moderate sized pieces of chicken for the dish. Service was a bit slow and thats why i m not giving it a 5, but overall the experience was superb. Highly recommended.

Went in here on a busy evening. Despite the crowd, it luckily didn't take us too long to get a table. 
The food was good, but one could visit this place just for the ambience to be honest. It was possibly one of the ancient big houses of Calcutta that was converted into a restaurant. This is one of the oldest restaurant in the city, and has all the dim lighting that make it appeal as romantic. Unfortunately didn't have a good camera phone back then with me to capture the best of it.

One of the legendary Park Street restaurants that has built the reputation over the time and quite successfully maintained it.
Chinese delicacies is one of the best in the town. We ordered Hakka chicken as starter which was deep fried and well packed with crunchy burnt garlic and red chilly. Mixed fried rice is filled with chicken pieces and prawns. But the best was Sweet and sour chicken which was lipsmacking. 
Overall, the experience was very good because of the ambience and courtesy of the staff.

Located at park Street area 
The ambiance and environment inside the restaurant is highly appreciated
The food is bit expensive 
Almost 800 for two people 
But the food is well standard
The best part would be "chicken butter masala "(boneless )
It was yummy !
Polao items are also well 
But it's not a good place to have some alcohol 
And the place is for good family meet ups
But wine and whiskey's can be bought
But beers would not bring that spark 
So, overall I would say it's a really good place to be!!!!!!!

Bar B Que needs no introduction, being itself a landmark restaurant in the food capital of Kolkata ie Park Street. For several decades it has been serving Chinese and North Indian food. I think there will be no kolkatan who hadn't had food at this place. 
Being a weekday, it was beaming with diners as if it was a weekend. We got our table for nine people in an unusually less than expected time. 
We had ordered for starters Crispy Baby Corn,Dahi Kebab,Tandoori Alu and Paneer Tikka. They all were fresh,tasty and delicious. 
Main course ordered were Hakka and Chilly Garlic Noodles and American Chopsuey with Devils Choice and Tsing Hoi Potatoes as side dish. Amazingly tasty and very well prepared. 
PS.  They also make amazing North Indian food. Dal Makhani needs special mention. Well cooked !
Well spent evening and to the hearts content.

Great ambience and staffs were dedicated in their job. They welcomed us nicely and made us comfortable by giving a nice table to sit. For starters we ordered Golden Fried Prawn, nicely cooked, less oily and totally justified as it named & Chilly Garlic Chicken with sweet and spicy sauce was a great combination. For main course we ordered Bar B Q special rice, Sezuan Chilly Chicken & Sliced Chilly Pork was good in taste making it great combination all together. Food was value for money (taste and quantity). Overall I am satisfied and will recommend for all Chinese cuisine lovers. It serves authentic Chinese cuisines. In dessert we had Fruit Punch which was yummy.

If you’re on the mood for some fine, perfectly cooked, delicious Indian Chinese; let me tell you BarBQ at Park Street is the right place to enjoy. Not only did I like the ambience but also the scrumptious food that melted by taste buds. I devoured into some chicken fried rice, chilli fish and chicken that was cooked beautifully followed by vanilla ice cream that tasted like heaven. The customer service was also not a disappointment here but I do feel they could work a bit on the lighting. Overall, the food is something to enjoy and savour.

The quantity of the food served is excellent as it is more than enough for two people. The fried rice or noodles both contains enough of shredded chicken, prawn, pork, egg. Thus, there is no room for complain.
P.S. - Their Devil's Chicken is superb! I would say a must try.

BarBQ has never disappointed me . It was during last puja that I went to this place for the first time and since then it has always been my constant. The food, the ambience is so great over here. And the food is the Usp. I had mixed Chicken Coriander Soup for starters and fried rice and Hong Kong style chicken. The food was excellent and well cooked .The quantity they provide is more than enough to suffice the hunger of two people. Me and my friend couldn't complete the whole bowl of fried rice so we had to pack the rest of it. So , not only they provide good food they also have some great collection of alcohol.
The staffs are very amiable and generous.

So ,this pujo make sure you eat right and from the right place.

This place has been in my list since a long a time. Finally made it. Park Street is full with vintage classy restaurants and this is one of them. The ambience can fill anyone's soul. Luckily we got a table near a big glass window with that beautiful hanging lamp covered with a glossy metal that reflects the whole scenario around us. Stuffs are really well behaved. Coming to the food, in starter we had devil's chicken and chicken fried wanton. Devil's chicken was lip smacking good and the fried wantons completely won my heart, perfectly crispy from outside and served with a beautiful sauce. In main course two of us had burnt garlic chicken fried rice and Kung pao chicken. Rice was a bit sticky, chicken was amazingly cooked and gravy was superb. Rest of us had Mutton biriyani and chicken tikka masala. Biriyani was a bit different from the one we usually have but I loved it and the creamy gravy of tikka masala was fantastic. Quantity is sufficient. I would love to visit this place again.

BAR B Q in parkstreet is just opposite to flurys, beside McDonald's.
There are two sections of this restaurant
One is chinese and the other one is North Indian.
I have only tasted the dishes of Chinese, which are without a second thought absolutely delicious.
The Hunan chicken here is one, that one would definetely relish.
The place is very good as far as authentic chinese dishes are concerned.

If you visit parkstreet then lunch over here is a must!

Worst experience ever faced. We visited this place on the eve of our friend's birthday. They provide us (8 people) a round table which can accommodate maximum 5 people. When we asked them to change or provide us another table, they said that we have to adjust in that table only. The behavior & attitude of the restaurant management was not welcoming at all. It seemed that they actually don't care about what problems the customers are facing. This type of service is not expected from a restaurant of this standard. The food was good although but we can't enjoy it much because of this disappointing service.

The ambience gives you a casual feel, nothing formal at all. Best for lunch date with friends, where you don't need to bother about laughing loudly! The food was tasty and pocket friendly. Although we had to wait for 15 mins as the tables were full, yet the well behaved staff made it seem easy. Overall a good experience.

Every year we have a winter reunion of the school buddies here. While cherishing all the love and memories, we do enjoy the food at this place as well. They offer a nice ambience as well.. not a themed one though. Try out their fried rice, it's a bit different in taste than the others. All other preperations for us.. is always awesome. :) Thanks Bar-B-Q

Have been here so many times that I've gone tired of the flavour. Last time I went unfortunately I had a problem with one of the stewards. The chili sauce had a bit of a stale smell and when I asked the steward to change it he said no it doesn't smell without even smelling it. Few seconds later the waiter brought my aunt the wrong drink instead of gin he brought orange flavoured vodka. Upon smelling that we immediately understood that it was wrong but yet again the steward said it was gin. The waiter however was quick to react and admitted it was orange vodka . Someone should teach the steward the customer is always right policy.

BarBQ is one of the oldest and posh restaurants located in the heart of park street, kolkata. The ambience is excellent. This restaurant is totally value for money. The quality as well as the quantity  of the food and drinks served is worth the price. And lastly it is the cordial behaviour of the staffs which binds together the awesomeness of the place.
P.S please try the blue lagoon for those have the knack for moctails. They serve the best❤

I'm really thankful to BarBQ for the last night dinner.
On last Saturday, we went to Park street for dinner.
But we were late.
We found BarBQ was still open at 12 am.
We ordered mutton galawati kebab, tandoori roti and mutton do piyaaza.
Mutton galawati was good.
But I didn't like Do piyaaza.
They prepare it with incorrect recipe adding capsicum in it.
Also there were only 3 pieces of mutton.
Whatever we had our dinner. That's the big thing.
I saw most of the people were ordering chinese courses.
May be next time I will order chinese foods as well.

Had a lovely evening here with friends over beer and some delicious sliced chilli pork which blew my mind off with its rich and mouth watering taste. It was indeed cooked very well, tender and juicy. We loved it so much that we ordered another plate of it rather than the usual chicken dishes we order.  A worth trying dish which really goes well with some beer. 
I have always loved this place and always will. A must visit when in kolkata.

We also had a dessert of the day which was a chocolate souffle that you must ask for after you finish your main course... It's delicious to say the least

How I love this place! One of the oldies down at Parkstreet, this one is a crowd puller. It can accommodate big groups and has a lot of seating area. They offer multiple cuisines, but I personally love their Chinese dishes the most. Enough to feed three people, their portions are generous and loaded with meat and veggies (in case of noodles/fried rice). The side dishes are also hearty and bang on the buck in terms of flavour. An absolute must visit if you are at Parkstreet craving for a taste of authentic Bengali Chinese!

We chose this place after going through zomato, this place is one of the old eateries in kolkata,the ambience was good, staff were courteous, coming to the food, we had ordered the chilli pork, the garlic pepper chicken, devils chicken ,mixed hakka noodles and mixed fried rice. The chilli pork was great, the garlic pepper chicken was ok. The hakka noodles and the mixed fried rice were ok. The devils chicken was actually quite a let down...it was actually bland..did not have proper spices nor proper salt. I would not recommend this plate at this eatery.

It's not about the food always you see. It's about your experience as a whole. We went there for Birthday Celebration of a friend and boozed a lot. While we all were intoxicated at our highest levels nail emerged from the birthday girl's food.  It washed away the good memories of corona , the awesome taste of schezwan chicken , the amazing baked Alaska flavour and everything. This place is a must visit. But be careful while you are eating. I suggest don't get intoxicated while you are eating here. You might suffer nail injuries inside your mouth. ,😂😂😂😂

This is a place where it feels like you are among old friends. Wonderful people, spacious, good food, prompt service and comparatively low waiting thanks to the huge seating availability. The price is very reasonable. The mood sets in immediately on being recognised and being greeted with the right mix of bonhomie and deference by the old hands who make this place. The drinks are served  promtly. The starters would always be served when you want it if you are careful to specify that clearly. That comes with your having empathy for people who are on their toes serving hundreds of guests for hours. So a little bit of polite and clear instructions go a long way on your dining experience being great.

Yesterday, we had our usuals from the standard chinese menu among others- Pan fried mix noodles, steam rice and dry chilli pork. The pork was really  Wow! The noodles was generous in both the serving and ingredients. The steam rice just right. Thank you folks at Bar B Q! Keep rocking.

One of the legendary outlets in Kolkata situated conveniently at Park Street.It was in my wish list for long before a friend of mine and me decided to pay it a visit.
Spacious to say the least and you will find tables never-mind the size of your group.There are basically 2 sections: the Chinese and the North Indian.The decor is classy with great attention to detail.
We had crispy chilly baby corn for starters, followed by mixed fried rice and chicken in hot garlic sauce; a classic Chinese lunch along with a bottle of Haywards 5000.
The crispy chilly baby corn of one of the very best i have tasted.Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with the perfect amount of sauce.
The quantity of the mixed fried rice was great and is enough for 2. Adequate eggs and chicken and prawns were there as one should expect in a mixed rice.
The texture of the chicken in hot garlic sauce was great with quite large chicken pieces and a hot garlicky gravy.
The staffs are co-operative and you can rely on their expert suggestions if you feel spoilt  for choices.
Overall a great place to visit with friends and family as it is a value for money restaurant and enjoy the good food and drinks on offer

This is also one of my hotspots in kolkata park Street. The food served here is quite good to taste and some were exceptionally good. You will enjoy your stay here.

To be truthful, BarBQ was a surprise for me. I had heard of this place, but had assumed that it was one of those over-priced restaurants in Park Street. Believe me when I say this, THIS RESTAURANT IS VALUE FOR MONEY. Ordered the Pan Fried Noodles. I mean wow. The taste - Wow. The portion - Wow. The presentation - Wow. Visited on a Friday night, so naturally, the place was packed as anything. The staff is courteous enough. But the winner is undoubtedly the food on offer. The noodles was so good, I didn't even need to touch the side-dish. Highly Recommended!!

Barbq has been a favourite restaurant ever since its inception. From service, to food to quauntity, everything is top notch. 

Have tried out quite a lot from their menu. I personally love almost everything they have to offer. Their drumsticks and crispy chilly babycorn are great starters. Their mixed hakka noodles and mixed fried rice have been my favourite since a very long time now. The chicken and fish main courses are equally delicious. The fish dishes are soft and melt rightaway, while the chicken dishes are succulent too. The fresh lime soda is also good. 

Lastly, do not forget to try our their thai curry, it will blow your mind away.

Will definitely revisit without a doubt.

One of the legendary restaurants of Kolkata and economical restaurants of park Street.
This is one of those restaurants where I have been dining since ages following my grand parents.
Over the ages the Food has definitely detoriated when it comes to Indian cuisine..whereas the consistency with Chinese cuisine is still there.
So I give 3.5 which is decent for food
When it comes to service
Definitely not a great service
The staff is not very prompt and persuasive towards the guests.
Ambiance I would want to give 6 outta 5
You go at 2 during Day time on any weekday and it would make you feel the same as weekend.
Being one of those finest restaurants I would want it to run forward till my coming generation.
With a little bit of alteration .
They can do excellent by working a little more on their food and service which seems to be a lil detoriated to me

My favourite Chinese and North Indian restaurant in Park Street. It is located in Park Street just opposite to Flury's. It's near my college so I would frequently visit this place for lunch with my friends. We had Chinese and North Indian on alternate days.
I love their Crispy Chili babycorn and Drums of Heaven among the starters from the Chinese menu and Chicken Malai kebab from the North Indian menu. Among the main course- Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce, konjee crispy chicken, Hunan chicken, devil's chicken are my personal favourites.  Mutton korma and chicken reshmi butter Masala are must orders from their menu. Sweet and sour fish and Prawns in garlic sauce taste heavenly and I would recommend them. Chili garlic chowmein, barb-q special chowmein and from the Indian side, Masala Kulcha are all time favourites. Finally, to satisfy your sweet tooth, order the Hot Chocolate Fudge. You won't regret visiting this restaurant with friends or family. 
The ambience is impressive with a huge seating area in two chambers, one for Chinese and the other for Indian. The service is really good and the staff is easily approachable. The presentation of food is ordinary but the quantity is appealing. The taste is top notch and the price is reasonable considering the location of the restaurant. The pocket pinch won't affect much as the food is worth the price. Highly recommended!

Been here twice.
FOOD:
Tried their BarBQ special fried rice(pretty good), chili garlic fried rice(too salty to eat even after replacement), Kung Pao chicken(average), Tsing Hoi chicken(nothing special), Schezwan chili pork(well I tried pork for the first time,so don't a have a bar to compare, but tasted good), shredded chicken green pepper(good one if you are a fan of veggies like me 😉), mandarin fish(AWESOME,give it a try), and golden fried prawn(THE BEST, literally melts in your mouth).

P.S. : One bowl of rice is enough for 2 people with average appetite! So, order accordingly.

SERVICE:
The best thing about this place is definitely their amazingly cooperative staff.

AMBIENCE:
The ambience is also good, although the place is usually a bit crowded, especially on weekends. So you might have to wait for your turn right where the others are having their meal(disappointing that they don't have a proper waiting area! ).

In all, it's a nice place to enjoy with your friends and family. 😊

This is one of Kolkata's legendary outlets. I heard that this place serves great Chinese delicacies. I could finally drop in for dinner last Friday to try out their Chinese dishes. The ambience was soothing at first but I found it too dim. With time it got over crowded and there was a lot of chaos.
Coming to food, I regret visiting this place for Chinese. Their quantity is good but I didn't like it's taste at all. After ordering Coriander soup (little salty for my taste), chilli garlic pepper chicken (overcooked) and red pepper prawn ( the coating was weird) we shifted to their Indian menu. It was disappointing as the last two dishes were suggested by the waiter and hence were expected to be good.
We first ordered the Non veg Kabab platter ( this was the only good thing for me. Both in quantity and quality). Finally came tandoori rotis and Mutton roganjosh (the mutton was extremely soft which I loved but the taste was like ordinary curry made at home).
Though the restaurant was packed, their service was commendable. The staff was well behaved and quick.

I have been there on many ocassions. The decor has a charm in it. The wooden stairs, chairs and tables add a vintage feeling to it. 
The staffs are welcoming.
And coming to the food-it's extraordinary. I have tried many of their starters and main course and none of them have disappointed me. The tutti frutti is one of my most favourite desserts here. 
So if you love chinese, BarBQ must be in your bucket list.
Three cheers for BarBQ👍

A foodie friend of mine recommended BarBQ to me. My knowledge of classic food joints of Kolkata being limited to Peter Cat and Trincas, I leapt at the opportunity of sampling another footnote in the history of this wonderful city.
So, after a hectic day, my friends and I headed to BarBQ. An unassuming exterior greeted me. Tightly nestled between two buildings, a closed door and an awning spelling out the letters 'BAR B Q' were all the decorations. Upstairs, the restaurant stretched out through the entire floor. An usher took us to our table. Chinese calendars used as a placemats were a nice touch. Waiters filled up our glasses and distributed menu cards with clockwork precision. The atmosphere inside was buzzing with snatches of conversation floating through the air. The decor was, for the lack of a better word, classic. Low-hanging ceiling fans, carpeted floors, booths lining the wall, everything was beautiful.
We ordered the pan-fried noodles with chicken, rice with mixed meats, sweet pork and a dim sum basket. During the wait for the food, the waiters filled up our glasses again, which I appreciate.
The food arrived, piping hot and was immediately and expertly distributed by the waiters. Having ordered single portions, nobody was under-served. The quantity was more than sufficient to feed 3 extremely hungry teenagers.
The noodles were served with soft oyster and button mushrooms. They were just firm and full of flavor. The rice was delicate and the meats were soft and juicy. The pork was crispy and sweet and tangy. The selection of dim sum was good, but the quantity should have been a bit more. Nevertheless, no complaints about the melt-in-your-mouth dim sums.
My only problem, and this can be termed as 'nitpicking', is that capsicum and other bell peppers could be used in some moderation.
In conclusion, for the price, the food was extremely well-prepared. If you like old Calcutta, you should definitely pay a visit to BarBQ!

Located smack-dab in the middle of busy Park Street, Bar-B-Q has been around for quite some time and is a kind of universal favourite here in Kolkata. I've been here a couple of times, the last visit being with a couple of old school friends one evening for dinner
. 
We ordered crispy fried chilli chicken for starters, followed by Kung Pao Chicken and Szechuan chilli pork for mains, along with a bowl of noodles. The dishes were all good, but my personal favourite was the spicy szechuan pork which was absolutely bursting with flavour. On others occasions I've had the crispy lamb and dry chilli pork among other dishes, all of which I really liked.

Service is prompt and the servers are polite. If you haven't been to this place yet, do visit it atleast once. You simply can't go wrong with the classics.

Located right at the middle of Park Street, BarBQ and specifically its "Flavours of China" section must be on a "to-visit" list of any foodie in Kolkata. Given the proximity to my workplace, and many other good points, BarBQ is one of my most frequently visited places, and it has never disappointed me.

Ambience - the ambience is as soothing as can be. The lighting, the decor everything falls perfectly into place with the theme.
Staff - As courteous as can be.
Food - Flavours of China serves one of the best and most authentic Chinese cuisines I have ever had. The most famous and highly recommended one is the Pan Fried Chili Fish. Trust me, if you taste it once, it will be surely drawing you again. The second most important dish is the Devil's Chicken, although the name might give you an impression that the dish is on the spicier side, but in reality it is not. It is a perfect fit for those who prefer their chinese gravy less spicey. I on the other hand love spicey food, so my personal favourite is plain old Chili Chicken which is also extremely well done. Merge it with the Fried Rice and you have an awesome tummy filler. BarBQ also serves traditional north indian cuisines, from that list, the Navratna Korma is a must try.

The only downside to this place is slower service speed, if that can be managed BarBQ is a complete 5 on 5 restaurant.

Overall, if you are planning to spend good quality time over great food, BarBQ must be on your watchlist.

The service of the restaurant is very poor. Waiter and manager are ill mannered. They served stale tandoori chicken to us and they were arguing as if we don't have knowledge about taste. Be cautious if you visit there. They pretend to be elite but they don't know the very basic trait of being elite.

I went to this place with my family on a Saturday evening.

Food and drinks:
In drinks we ordered the following:
-> 3 breezers
-> 2 Bira White beer
-> 2 30ml Gin

In starter we ordered the following:
-> Golden Fried King Prawns
-> Red Pepper Fish
-> Konjee Crispy Chicken

Prawns were delicious among the starters. Fish preparation was also great as the fish was fresh and soft.

In the main course we ordered the following:
-> 1 Mixed Fried Rice
-> 1 Chicken Fried Rice
-> 1 Chilli Fish
-> 1 Dry Red pepper chicken

For 5 of us, 2 Fried Rice was enough as they serve with great quantity. The dry red pepper chicken was really dissapointing as the chickens got burned badly spoiling the overall taste.

All of these cost us around 3900/-.

Overall a great place to dine out in Park Street with family.

They say sudden plans are the best one...and I believe that's true. Due to budget limitations chose BarBQ over a few possible alternatives. Ordered golden fried prawn accompanied with JW red label while others preferred smirnoff. The prawns were absolutely delightful. Though the liquor was just par. Then came the main courses, BarBQ special fried rice and vegetable fried rice. Which were partnered by Kung pai chicken, Mandarin fish, Tsing hoi chicken and chilli pork. Mandarin fish and Tsing hoi were treat to the palates where as the pork was a bit highly seasoned with Kung pao being just good. It could have been a 3 star but due to the ambience and service the restaurant deserves another half. Eager to visit again.

Thought of uploading the review today. 

An exclusively good place to eat out. When all the choices fail, and mind cannot decide where to eat , BAr BQ comes to the rescue. 
The environment has always been friendly , the staffs always greeting with smile. And this place has a class. 
Very authentic Chinese dishes, well cooked and served. 
And , the Drinks section being marvellous too.  
A place worth visiting no matter how many times you have come .

My favourite dishes are "Bar-B-Q special Chowmein" and "Chicken in Oyster sauce ". I love the ambiance as much as the food. This restaurant will always be close to my heart.

We had Chinese.It was delicious.The chicken soft,even the basic egg fried rice was really tasty.
The amount was great.The price was reasonable.
The interior was okay, however,we got a round table in the center and the waiters kept bumping into my chair as it wasn't spacious at all.
The staff were otherwise very attentive.Food was served quick enough.
It was packed,on a Saturday afternoon.And by the time we got up,the entire staircase was crowded with hungry people.

I have heard a lot about this place from friends so finally we decided to visit. It is kind of a landmark located on Kolkata's most famous food street - Park Street which means finding a parking space is a humongous job in itself. This restaurant doesn't have valet parking service. The ambience is nice and decor is tasteful though there is not enough floor space. Entire place is packed with tables so forget about having a private conversation without anyone eavesdropping. We tried their speciality -Chinese, the food was tastefully prepared and delicious.

Overall a place to visit if you are craving for Chinese food and is willing to ignore everything else.

Located in Park street, its a very  familiar name for the food lovers. Wooden staircases, classic interiors are  definitely treat for eyes and relaxes your mood. Sitting arrangement is nice, well spaced  but tables for 2 can be bit broader.
Now lets discuss food menu...absolutely delight for the foodies wide range of dishes in Chicken, Fish and mutton. Chicken and fish starters melts in your mouth( chicken malai tikka, fish resmi kebab, chicken tandoori are my favs) . Main courses are also very good but not as good as starters. Rice items are good. Rotis are great, Masala Kulcha could use bit more filling. Deserts are good, loved the service style.
Prices of Booze are very reasonable . Service is excellent , 1/2* extra for the quick service and the staff behaviour. Overall a must visit place in Kolkata. ....:)

Perfect food with good quantity, perfect place for Chinese cusine lovers. Been there many times & never found a reason for not to visit again. The price for the food is just worth it because of the quality & quantity they maintain. The best restaurant in Kolkata. No 5star food can compete with it.
Foods are just mouth watering whenever i go with the menu & i got puzzle coz its not possible to eat all at a time & every​ single dish mentioned on the menu is just delicious.
Starting from soup: hot & sour, manchow soup, chicken sweet  corn
starter: Drums of heaven, chicken spring roll, wantons
Main course: pan fried gravy noodles, mixed fried rice, hong kong chicken, kung pao chicken & many more
Desert : dar saan with vanilla ice cream.

I visited this place twice to try both their Indian and Chinese food.
Firstly the Indian, we had tandoori chicken, Chicken Bharta and Chicken Reshmi Masala along with Tandoori roti.
Well the items were not bad, they were nicely cooked but the taste was more or less average. Didn't feel anything special about it.

Coming to the Chinese food. It was decent and better than their Indian food.
We had Drums of Heaven, Pork Fried Rice and Kung Pao Chicken.
The Chinese items were much tastier, specially the Pork Fried Rice tasted amazing.
As for dessert we had Brownies and Vanilla Ice cream and was delicious too.

This is a good place to pay a visit if you wanna try some good Chinese, otherwise if you want to have Indian food I wouldn't recommend this place.
The pock pinch isnt much high either.

Just a drawback here is the staff is very rigid in giving a table for 2 even if their guests are waiting, they won't give a table of 3-4 to 2 persons!!

It is one of the economical restaurants in Park Street.  It's so popular one has to almost always wait some time for getting a seat. Went there with friends.  Ordered Crispy chilli babycorn,
chicken schwezuan chowmein,
mixed fried rice,
kung pao chicken,
chicken manchurian. 
Quantity was very good. But all the food tasted pretty average. Kung pao chicken was extremely bland. Others were okayish.
They should do something about their menu card and chairs...they look really dirty...else ambience is fine.  Still, a must visit in Park street especially for a group.

Often referred to as a legendary restaurant in Kolkata, and I must say, its a title very well deserved.
         From the ambience to the service to the food,it was just an amazing experience.
         We tried out the following :-

01. Drums of Heaven
02. Chicken Sweet Corn Soup
03. Chicken Schezwan Hakka noodles
04. Egg Chicken Fried Rice
05. Chilli Chicken Boneless

        All the dishes were extremely delicious, the Drums of Heaven though I guess could have been better. Quantity was also fairly good.

Final Verdict- A place I would definitely be going back to and recommend all to give it a try if you haven't already.

mixed, though it weighs more on the positive side. 
The pork dishes and chowmein are great. The naan and Paneer/Chicken dishes in the Indian section are average.
The last time we went, we ordered fried rice, which was too salty. The garlic prawn dish tasted weird, too. The kababs were good. So was the baby corn dish.

We ordered Chilli Garlic Fried rice,Hakka noodles and KungPao chicken,trust me it was finger licking.Especially the quantity is good enough to satisfy 3 people approx. Its just that the rate are a bit high but if you are in aa group and share the bill then it won't make a hole in your pocket.

Overall a thumbs up 👍 wanna visit again.

Their pindi chana and paneer Butter masala just melts in your mouth! Dal makhani and breads were equally fantastic. Chicken tikka and Shekhar kebab was to die for ! Best north indian I've had in Calcutta! The staff is highly professional and friendly. Service is pretty quick. The chocolate souffle was also nice. And the beer and Sula etc were just fine ! Overall we were 8 p@eople and the bill was around Rs 6500. I'll just recommend to add some more beverages and shakes to the menu ! Will definitely visit again soon for Chinese!

Went there yesterday night for dinner, the restaurant was crowded as always, this is my 2nd time having dinner here. The ambiance of the restaurant is warm and nice, the staffs were very courteous and well behaved. The service time was about 20 minutes.

Now about the food, we were 3, we ordered Konji Crispy Chicken as a starter, the dish was well made, but a bit too sweet for my taste and it had a weird smell. I am not sure but maybe of excess soya sauce. For the main course we ordered 2 plates of Chicken Fried Rice with Sliced Chili Pork as its side dish. The quantity was more than enough for the 3 of us. The fried rice was extremely dry and the chicken pieces tasted very overcooked and didn't appear to be fresh, whereas the Chili Pork had a bit too much of salt as its seasonings. The food has definitely deteriorated since the last time we visited this place.

Went with my college friends for lunch. We were 8 ppl together and ordered chicken fried rice, bbq special fried rice, chicken manchurian, chicken in hot garlic sauce and chilli chkn. One of my friend tried out chicken sweet corn soup but I would recommend not to try their soup category as the soup was pretty plain and tasted like dilute solution of corn starch. Coming to the main course, they were good,but not sooooo good but definitely hygienic. I liked the chilli chkn and hot garlic chkn. Bbq spcl fried rice differs from chkn fried rice in it's xtra shrimp content and may be some more egg. Do remember to tell them not to give you pork in rice if you are not comfortable with it. The decor was very good and staffs were very friendly. They served it after 15 minutes.Good place to dine with the family members.

Located in one of the most frequented places to eat in Kolkata, the name of this restaurant itself suggests mouth watering delicacies. It is spread over a considerably large area inside and people actually have to wait in line to get a table. Good food attracts more customers and for food lovers, this is the place to go.
The Indian food that I had was absolutely delicious. The staff itself suggested chocolate souffle as dessert and I was not disappointed at all. Rich creamy chocolate mousse with a dollop of cream was the perfect end to a lovely evening spent here.
I would highly recommend this place for all food lovers of all ages.

One of the favorite places to go for comfort food. Have been there innumerable times and loved it always. Be it the north Indian or the Chinese cuisine, BarBQ never disappoints. Must tries are chilli garlic noodles and tsing hoi potatoes. Extremely helpful and polite staff. Being in the centre area of Park Street, it's always crowded, even on a weekday.

Everytime I visit parkstreet I feel like entering bar b q. The place is so perfect in every way.. ambience is very calm and quiet perfect for a family visit. Food is very tasty and quantity is also sufficient for the price. Recently went with friends on a Saturday evening and had to wait an hour before we could enter. Ordered lat me Kai for starter is was just too good. For main course we ordered mixed fried rice and fish with mushroom and vegetables.

I've been to barbeque nation many a times but this was the first time in BarBQ.
Ambiance: It's suitably decorated. Although I felt the it would have been better if the lights weren't so gloomy.
Service : They're are maintaining an excellent service. Quick and prompt. Staffs are cooperative and well mannered.
Food: Both the quality is above average and quantity is sufficient for two.
Ordered Chicken and veg manchow soup for starters.
For main course we ordered BarBQ special chowmein, BarBQ special rice, Kung pao chicken and schezwan chilly chicken. Kung pao chicken is worth mentioning.

Whenever one talks about the restraunts of park street area, the expectations regarding the quality and flavours of food...ambience... reaches to a different level....😍 And as always bar bq satiates those expectations completely!!😍 Initially bar bq was always referred to as one of the best flavoured north Indian cuisined restraunt...but now it serves one of the best flavoured authentic chineese dishes as well. One should definitely try the devil's chicken and the manchow soup. Talking of the kebabs, the lip smacking kebab platter is a must try. The restraunt serves delicious foods along with an amazing ambience. 😍😍😍😍😍😍

Located at Park street, this place is bustling with people all day long. Classy place. The food they serve is such a delicacy. We ordered the crispy chilli baby corn. I normally don't like baby corn but this was such a delight! We had pan fried garlic fish which was spicy and gives the palette a good taste. We had the chilli garlic noodles with konjee crispy chicken and Hunan Chicken. Absolutely loved the food. Recommend this place. One of my favourite place to eat.

Avoid Chinese. We couldn't make the difference between schezuan, kung pao, chilli, pork or chicken without hunting for nuts, meat and chili. That they can dare to serve such food made in the same sauce in a place like Kolkata known for its food and still have a following in Park Street no less must only be blind belief that all's well like politics. Try a roadside Chinese stall instead; this one is reminiscent of all things wrong with Kolkata. 

The north Indian dishes are good though. But then again, we were happy to get a decent plate.

The interior of this place is very impressive with its wooden stairs and columns, large window panes and the warm lighting. The service is also quite prompt and efficient but when it comes to food it is not above average. Me and my friend had ordered for mock-tails, a fruit punch and a pineapple flavored drink. These were followed by prawn dumplings with lemon chili, prawn rice noodles and chicken with cashew nuts/almonds. The quantities of noodles and chicken cashew nuts were good but the tastes failed to stand out. The mock-tails were over-the-top sweet. The momos were juicy,tender and the best of the lot.

The price is good. And the food is just amazing. For the price the quantity is more. So make sure that you don't order in huge quantities. One plate fried rice was enough for three people.

I don't want add new . It is one the best food joint with great ambiance and affordable price range.
But i would like to mention one glitch which is your faulty POS devices. 
Last  Sunday i was all alone out there for dinner and billing amount was 872. I paid with by debit card and to my surprise i found later the above mentioned amount has been debited /deducted twice from my account . When the server first tried to swipe the card the POS has given some sort of error.
Again the server tried to swipe the card and  the amount was successfully paid/debited. Please change those faulty devices . I might pay visit very soon but don't want to have bad experience . If there any remedy let me know. Please introduce electronic wallet like paytm , so this type of problem will not be there .

We chose this place to celebrate the famous "jamai sashthi" festival and they didn't disappoint us. It's situated just a few steps away from park street MacDonald. They occupy a huge place and their ambience is perfectly fine. The staffs are always there to help you out regarding any confusion and information. 
Now leaving the introductory part and coming straightway to the food, we loved their recipes. 

From staters we had •mutton swami kebab, •chilli garlic pepper chicken and •fish fingers. Well among all the three we rated fish fingers as the best. But this doesn't mean the other two staters were medium, they were the showstoppers too. 

Now before we ordered the main course we decided to try their soup. We had •chicken manchow soup which just stole our appetite for the main course. 

So coming to the main course, from chinese cuisine we ordered •bar-b-q special chowmein, •kung pao chicken and •chicken in hot garlic sauce. You can easily share one special chowmein with two persons. It had black mushroom, chicken, prawns and egg mixed with the noodles. Well we don't remember any of them tasting bad. We loved kung pao chicken with cashew nuts and its sweet sour taste. 
From indian cuisine we had •lachcha paratha and •paneer makhani. Trust me we never had such well made paneer makhani. 

In short our "jamai sashthi" was successful and our lunch was perfect and we were tremendously happy :) 
I will call it a pocket friendly restaurant since it costed us around 3.3k for 7 heads even after ordering so many items which was just unbelievable. 

Will be visiting again soon :))

Park Street has always been the place for family dinner, and party animals alike. And occupying a big part of Park Street is BarBQ. There's no introduction needed for this legendary outlet, occupying a massive area right opposite Flurys. They have 2 sections for dining, and the entire place exudes the old Kolkata charm and that, I believe is the main USP of this place. Speaking of the food, the menu is one with a lot of options, and they still continue to introduce a dish or two every now and then. You have the liberty to choose from both North Indian and Chinese delicacies and there are a few Thai dishes included as well. However, over the years, I feel the quality of the food has been dipping. I had always been vocal about how the prices are quite decent in comparison to the quantity and taste of the food served at BarBQ. However, my last visit made me eat up my words. The Chicken in Hot Garlic Sauce was extremely salty and so was the Fried Rice. It was really disappointing. BarBQ never boasted of exotic dishes, but the simplicity was what made them stand apart. I hope they don't ruin that too.

And if you're looking for recommendations, go for the Golden Fried Prawns, Devil's Chicken Kung Fao Fish, Sweet and Sour Pork and pair it with either the Noodles(both hakka and gravy are delicious) or the Rice. The Indian section too has a lot to offer, but I always prefer the Chinese one. But the thing that continues to pull the crowd is undoubtedly the big status of the place and the sheer nostalgia associated.

Bar B Q is one of the most famous restaurant in Park Street where people have to wait for their turn in every weekend,  I have never seen any empty table on that place.. This has become possible for the great quality as well as quantity of their food...
Bar B Q serves excellent Cantonese Noodles, Mix fried rice , it has typical flavour which you won't get  in other places and the quantity they serve is good for 3/ 4 person...

For the food quantity.There are very few restaurants who maintains both quality and quantity of food, this is one of them.Most of the time we have to wait as it is always crowded with foodies. But we manage to get place soon.
Servicing could have been better but it's not worst atleast.0.5 is deducted for better service . otherwise a big big thumbs up !

Went to Bar BQ after a very long time yesterday. The menu had changed a lot, lamb is no longer on the list but the décor has remained the same. The staff were courteous and polite but things went wrong with the most important thing: food.
This place is famous for its huge serving size and the authentic taste but taste was the thing lacking in all the dishes we ordered except the soup. The chilli chicken dry was unlike anything i ever had, it was bland, spices were nearly absent and it felt odd. The drums of heaven and the red pepper chicken seemed so alike in the taste and i couldn't any hint of pepper in the red pepper chicken. The mixed fried rice was even worse, the rice was like sticking in the mouth, absolutely bland and seemed like it needed a healthy dose of salt to start with.
Frankly i had much high regards for this place having been there numerous times earlier but this is not what i had in mind and this is not living up to the standards.

Last time i went here it was on a special occasion and i was with a special person. We had quite a good time over the food and drinks. Its one of the most busiest and popular places in the city. The ambience is really nice. With a fun little space for couples in the corner of the sitting area its basically like a semi deck. The service was smooth and the waiters are polite. We ordered Red Pepper Chicken for starters which went very well with my favourite beer budwieser. 😝😋 For main course we had Kung Pao Chicken and Mixed Fried Rice. The quantity and quality served was really up to my expectations. And coming to the taste, it was really really amazing. Overall a thumbs up. Keep up the good work guys. Will visit again soon.

Nice place. Separated rooms for different cuisine.M not a big fan of biriyani but here I ordered this nd guess what I enjoyed that biriyani so much. Servicing could have been much better .Had to wait almost 40 minutes for a plate of biriyani.All i can say if u r hungry nd a biriyani lover nd a *lyadhkhor* to walk a little bit to go for reputed biriyani place...thn come here nd enjoy the biriyani with good quantity and reasonable price.
**But u have to wait atleast 40 minutes 😅.

This is the most "paisa vasool" place that I've been too. I personally prefer the Chinese but the Indian is great as well. The food is delicious, quantity is great and you'll be left wanting for me. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The drinks are nice. This is my go to place, and I think that isn't going to change anytime soon. MUST VISIT!

BarBQ Park Street , it's one of the most popular and oldest restaurant to eat and hang around with friends and family. Beautiful ambiance , comfy sitting arrangement. It has a staircase inside which add to the beauty of the chiaroscuro interior.   Preparation of food is very good and homely. Staffs are also cordial. The variety of food and booze available here is really impressive. We had Beer , mouth watering Pork mushroom and vegetables , Chili fried pork . Also this place is very pocket friendly while being one of the finest brand of Chinese cuisines in Kolkata .  Would highly recommend for a visit ,  you're gonna love this place. 

Cheers! Team BarBQ

Recently visited BarBQ on the occasion of my father's birthday .Have been visiting BarBQ since I was a child. I have two favourites amongst the mains. The pan fried chicken noodles and mixed meat fried rice. They beat any mains at any Chinese outlet in Cal. As a side dish with these items, I always prefer konjee krispy chicken . It's a dry item and the staff doesn't usually suggest a dry item with dry mains. But I feel it goes very well with both the mains I have stated above. As a starter, their chicken fried wantons steal the show and they have lovely soups. I have tried almost all their vegetarian items , courtesy my vegetarian friends, crispy chilli babycorn is by far the best amongst vegetarian sides for me.

So the relatives come to town and you meet them after (at least 5) years. You don't know what they like, if they want a drink, how much they eat and how much can you spare to pay. BBQ is your place to be. Great variety with good ambience and food. Serves a recognisable Indian and Chinese menu mostly. Nothing's really authentic, nothing's bad either. One of the very few places with lasting retro-Park Street charms. Ideal for meat cravings, or general luncheons. Parking is a curse, take an Uber. 
BBQ Special Chowmein is a must have.

This  is a place I don't know how many times I have visited. It never fails to disappoint me. 
To me it belongs to the 'old soul' category of Kolkata restaurants and I can't refrain from visiting this place when I am here.
It has evolved over the years, in terms of hospitality, but it has maintained its taste always.
Their crispy chilli baby corn is my favourite.
I have tried almost all of their Chinese dishes over the years and trust me , my taste buds just love it.

If you love Chinese and you are In Kolkata, don't forget to tick this off your checklist.

After a long tiring day at college and some desperate last minute pujo shopping, a tired mind and hungry stomach reached park street with the single hope of quenching our hunger pangs... Truth be told, we weren't looking for perfection. We were just excruciatingly hungry and any food would just do. But I guess, u strike gold where u least expect it. Thank heavens, we chose Bar BQ for the job. Hands down, it was the best food that I have had in the past few weeks. We went purely mainstream and for starters ordered
Chilli garlic pepper chicken-- What can I say? Maybe the most perfect balance of hot and sweet seasonings played a limbo on the palate from the first bite of this dish. Highly recommended of course!
Mains followed,
Chicken hakka noodles-- Bar BQ is probably the best place to go if u are awfully hungry because one bowl of noodles can satisfy three people... So that's a quantity worth commending. The noodles on their part was good enough with a generous amount of veggies and chicken bits sprinkled all over.
Kung pao chicken-- This was the only dish which could have been better in balance... It was a bit too much on the sweeter side. Yet it was undoubtedly tasty and again... Commendable in quantity.
Finally for the star of the evening, the dessert...
Chocolate soufflé -- I would just say... My heart literally broke when we had finished it... It was light, with the perfectly smooth texture that u want from a soufflé... with some surprise vanilla at the end... If not anything else, do have this at Bar BQ... This dessert is one ur taste buds would not easily forget.
As for the staff, perfection is the only word for them. We had ordered fried rice before, so gluttonish were we, but later debated and wanted to cancel it. We took that decision almost 20 minutes after the order. They readily cancelled it without making a fuss which is something that u don't expect from other restaurants. As for the pocket pinch, it was perfectly reasonable and the ambience is sure to make u relax on a busy day. Looking forward to my next visit😊

I had been here quite frequently because of our office dinner and frankly, I really liked in here. In fact, I always used recommend this place to the friends who were new in Kolkata. But, the last time I came with my friends,  the experience was horrible. The stuff was ill mannered, the food was also not good. We somehow finished what we ordered, and  went out to look for other place to complete our dinner.

This restaurant needs no introduction. One of the legendary culinary destinations of Kolkata, I have been frequenting Bar-b-q with my family for almost twenty years now, and the quality is ALWAYS excellent. I usually Have Chinese food with my family - the Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, the Konjee Crispy Chicken, the Crispy Chilli Chicken, the Kung Pao Chicken, the Garlic Chicken, the Chicken with Cashewnuts and Almonds, the Chicken Fried Rice, the Chicken Hakka Chowmein, the Chinese Chopsuey - all eaten dozens of times and loved every single time. Indian food is also prepared expertly here - they have some of the the softest butter naans I have ever tasted, and the chicken kebabs, Paneer Butter Masala and Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala are all spot on. To top it off, the prices are unbelievably low for such great quality. Bar-b-q is truly a shining example of consistency - my parents loved it as children, and our children will love it too! 
To all who haven't visited it yet - GO. Make a special trip to Kolkata if necessary, but go. You will fall in love. I promise.

Been here several times as it's iconic to the city and to Park street food scene. Old wooden decor which has been maintained well inspite of the footfall here. Huge quantities and absolutely delicious food. The only flaw would be waiting in ques even for weekday lunches but totally worth it. If you don't wanna wait, just call for a zomato delivery.

well for many people bar b q is quite a nice place. good food at affordable prices. but i just didnt like the place and there are a lot of reasons behind it. Firstly the staffs. They are snobs and if you ask for them to pack some of your leftovers at the end of the meal they just give you a snigger which is really humiliating. secondly i have been to bar b q 5 times counting the last time i went this sunday. and surprisingly i find that they do not have most of the items they keep on displaying in bar menu. in cocktails they only offer you mojito, bloody mary, tom collins and screwdriver. and among the appertifs and liquer section we were only given the option to have tequila. i mean what is the need of keeping such long menus if you are unable to provide them. thirdly their uality is detoriating. the first time i went i had konji crispy chicken which was really good however this sunday it tasted bitter and tasteless. i know my review has no effect on their customer base and on them. but please do take a little care. most of the other big restaurants in the city are providing way better service than you. and being at a prime location like park street we really expect better behaviour and customer treatment from you. and i forgot to mention the fact that you even cut off customers names from waiting lists without even bothering to call out their names.

One of the oldest restaurants in Kolkata that still manages to hold its charm and sophisticated ambiance. The crowd is good and is a mixed one. We a group of 6 went on thursday, even if it was a weekday the restaurant was jam packed. Its better if you reach by 7:30pm on weekdays to grab a table else you need to wait. Now about the food, we have all chinese dishes and it just suited our taste buds rightly. Every dish had its own distinctive taste and was mouthwatering. The quantity is good so plan before you order as you might just end us wasting. Good food,dim light, lovely crowd and ambience what else would one ask for 😊

A gang of seven, we walked into Bar-B-Q around 7:30 last friday evening, and man! The place was jam packed. After a waiting time of around 10 minutes, we were allotted our table. As we settled down, it was time to order the lip smacking cuisine. While one amongst us was a vegetarian, the rest were hardcore non-vegetarians, and we asked for some suggestions regarding the menu. We finally ended up ordering red pepper prawns, chilli garlic pepper chicken, fish tikka kebab and tandoori paneer tikka for starters. The starters were all good, except for the prawns which seemed a bit undercooked. Especially the fish tikka and the paneer were to die for. Then it was time for the main course. We ordered devils chicken, prawns in hot garlic sauce, szechuan fish, chicken hakka noodles, egg fried rice, chicken burnt ginger capsicum fried rice, fish masala, paneer butter masala and vegetable pulao. Again, the prawns were undercooked and a let down factor. However, the rest of the food, especially the Indian items were pretty good. We ended the meal with tutti fruttis for everyone. One large enjoyable meal. The ambiance was nice, though it gets a bit too noisy at times and the only way to speak to the person at the other end of your table is to shout. Wasn't much of a problem for us though. Overall a good experience. Would love to go back there.

Great food, more than sufficient quantity (a single plate of rice shall make 2 decent foodies full) and nice ambiance. The only con was the number of children flocking to the place with their family. This made the place a little loud and us a bit uncomfortable in having drinks. We visited the place during lunch hours, so I guess can't complain much about the demographics of the crowd. Overall an amazing place to gulp down delicious food with a glass or two of beer.

Not my first time at this prestigious place, although my first review. Be it Chinese or Indian, Bar B Q never ceases to amaze you. They had special Dumplings on their menu. We ordered the assorted one and each dumping was a gift from heaven. A must try for anyone doing there. They have both veg and non veg options. Their service, ambience and quality of food is at par excellent. I must admit that it is one of the oldest restros in Kolkata which has managed to keep it's service and food impeccable.

Another stalwart in Park Street. Very difficult to get a seat on weekends because of the crowd. Seats become realtively available around 4 pm. It is again another premium restaurant with nice cutlery and wooden decor. I liked their service every time I went there. Now coming to food, i have always loved their fish items. Good quality fish always. I was a little disappointed with their chicken drumstick though. I have usually believed that drumsticks mean large chicken legs while chicken lollypops are the smaller versions of the same, with little chicken hanging on top of the bone. The drumsticks served at Barbq was more like lollypops. (See pic below) Otherwise Barbq is actually known for its quantity.

Well it's was a pretty cool experience .As the place was a bit crowded we had to wait for a while though within a few minutes they managed a table for two of us.This place offers a nice ambiance though it was lil noisy bcoz of the crowd. I liked the decoration too with low light. 
Coming to the food probably it was the best part of it. 
Kung pao chicken and bar_b_q special noodles is definitely recommended. But the i'm not pleased with the service. They took a pretty long time for the order and i had to ask the waiter for a few things. This thing disappointed me a lil bit. Otherwise staffs are sober and with good hospitality.

It was a meet after a long 5 years with my ex colleagues and we are searching for a place which was a bit private and we can have our own happy time. This place proved to be exactly what we have thought for. We were given a secluded place inside which we all are very thankful to the manager. The service was very quick. The foods are very delicious. The fish dish has an excellent aroma to it, The cashew nut chicken has an excellent blend of nuts and gravy which simply melted in the mouth. The side dishes consisting of ginger with masala was really exotic and it tasted quite refresing. Keep it up guys.

Great food lovely ambience, been her earlier and last night with family, really enjoyed the meal experience, however one suggestion is, your waiting procedure when the restaurant being packed can be streamlined...service of Souren Panja was very hospitable

visited the place on poila boisak for lunch. the place was jam packed had to wait for 20 mins to get our table.  ordered barb q special rice with pork and devils chicken. the quatity is good for two people . coming to the taste . loed the fried rice which contained chicken prawns egg pork mushrooms , 3 types of bell peppers and some other veggies . no such special thing as the name suggests.  prices have slightly increased from what is given here . but the rice tasted awsome. unlike it the chicken laked flavours . shredded pieces of chicken was served in a light red coloured gravy which wasnt spicy . i dont know why the name is devils chicken . service could have been faster although giving a 4 for the ambiance  and the rice .  may come bake for a second visit to try there indian cuisines .

Located well in park street..! This huge within budget restaurant offers good food with perfect ambience making ur dinner outing an ideal one... place is fit for all groups.. couple dates or family or celebration..!  the rush / queues on the weekends might piss u off but then it's worth waiting.. a well behaved staff add to the positives !  DO CARRY UR AGE PROOF IN CASE U R DRINKING ( the authority might ask for it. ) 

In short... GO FOR IT if u r looking for a PERFECT EVENING WITH FAMILY !

I Went there for lunch during the lunch break of office and I came back craving for more, though I was full. So, I went back there once again.
During first visit we ordered chilli garlic noodles, fried rice and chicken gravy. Huge portions make it value for money food and the food is absolutely delicious. 
In my next visit I ordered fish fingers and fried prawns. I was surprised by fish fingers as I had never seen such big fish fingers and quantity was good too. Prawns were good but fish fingers were amazing. 
The ambiance of the place is really nice and service makes it a great place!

Visited this place on a Sunday afternoon after hearing about it from a lot of people. I was astonished to see the size of this restaurant and it was completely packed. Ordered mixed rice and paneer chilly. This is surely one of the finest Chinese restaurants I have eaten at. The food here is delicious and also not so expensive.A must visit on park street if your are in Kolkata.

A very old and legendary restaurant in park street that has fed generations after generation of calcuttans and still continues to cater to the ever-changing taste buds of the ever-youthful "city of joy" with unparalled zeal and dedication.
This restaurant has 2wings which are interconnected one is the Barbque which serves north-indian and on the other side is flavours of china which serves chinese.
As you climb up the flight of stairs u reach the restaurant which is very spacious and has been decorated like an old vintage apartment with dim lights and a constant hub-bub lingers in this place throughout the evening as it is filled with people,from families coming for dinner,couples on dates to heart-broken romeos and friends meeting up for a drink this place with open arms embraces all its customers . Very well behaved and friendly staff and obliging waiters add to its usp.
I usually drop by this place to satiate my pork-craving and sip on whiskey while having a deep conversation with my soul-buddy (our favorite)
My ordering consists of a few constants:-
1.Sliced chilli double fried pork (for me its like finding gold. The best pork i have had till date and goes excellent with my whiskey.)
2. Chicken spring roll-  Quite nicely made,crunchy and a bit bland so that it doesnt blunt my tongue to the heavenly taste of pork as well as compensate for my lipid needs while having an alcoholic binge.😅
A must visit place for anyone who frequents park street. The pricing is moderate and the food portions are quite generous (a plate will easily suffice 2 people).
A very close place to my heart and highly recommended so that this place gets the opportunity to serve u as well and endear itself to you

This restaurant has seen many changes, be it ambience or staff but something never changes. The waiting period on a saturday night in the staircase of this famous joint is still the same as I saw it 20yrs back. I had my first American Chopsuey in this place and i just loved it. Red pepper chicken, dry chilli chicken were something I craved for in those days. It has loosen its charm a little with so many chinese options around town but still it has a special corner in the heart or shall i say in the tastebuds.

Heard that it's one of the best on park Street but I completely disagree, was quite disappointed 
To start with the service is really slow, we ordered for:

Chilli garlic pepper chicken - this was probably the only thing I liked from whatever I ordered 
Fried chicken wings- one can get much better chicken wings anywhere else 
Drums of heaven - was just about average 
Chilli garlic Noodles - again just about average 
Chilli garlic Potato - highly disappointing

I went there for my birthday treat expecting a lot of my money to be spent.
But dude..... I never thought one of the legendary restaurants in kolkata can be that pocket friendly.
We had chilli garlic pepper chicken as starter.
One panfried chicken chowmein.
One barbeque special fried rice.
And a chinese chopsuey.
As the side dish we had devils chicken and schezuan chilli pork.
We were four people.
But the quantities were so awesome that we had to try to get the chinese chopsuey eaten.
We loved the food.
I am absolutely in love with the panfried chowmein thing.
And the pork oh my god...
My mouth is still relishing the taste.
For sweet dishes we had vanilla with chocolate sauce and hot chocolate fudge.
And the waiters were helpful... Quite.

Nice ambience.@
And all of this much food costed us only 2187 bucks.

i would definitely go back again sometime.
:) :)
No wonder this is one of the best restaurants in town.

I am not very great fan of Chinese food however just for a change tried Chinese and I must say I was quite good ... I ate non veg which included so many types of meat like chicken ,pork and prawn and these were my main attractions.... However I would say the best part is that they provide great quantity which is the best best thing fr the consumer as they like to watch full bowls.... However please don't go to eat north Indian , one of my friend tried dal makhani and nan , the dal was not good at all but the bread was good .... Good service and very formal ambience...

We visited this place on a Wednesday. We reached early so that we can get a table as there is always a mad rush for a table. 
It was however a pathetic experience from the start till the end. The worst service that I experienced anywhere in a long time ( even at BarBQ where service is generally ok types).

We were 8 people and asked 2 tables to b joined. We asked the server to join 2 tables but the way he was joining wud have been difficult for people to enter. We requested him to pull the table the other way and he started pulling chairs and table heavily as if what big thing has been told to him..

We ordered soup and starters... Starter arrived before the soup  did. We had ordered crispy chilly babycorn ( a dish i have loved in this place over the years) and it was kind of blank. Then the soup arrived Veg Manchow.. But the fried  noodles were missing.. We had to request for that and it came after 5 mins and the quantity was in a small bowl for two soups ( the lowest qty I have Eva seen).

Main course arrived and we asked the person for bowls and to my Utter surprise the server tells me that their is a SHORTAGE OF BOWLS as our table has already used bowls for sauces, chutneys and Onions. He cannot provide me one.. when we were amazed and asked for bowls, he picked up a couple of bowls from our table and told us he will get them washed... 

The place used to be amazing and good food. but this time around the food was below average and the service was way below anything.. we went for a good time but ended up having a nightmare.

Coming to park street means a must to eat in a few places one of them is Bar-B-Q, exactly how you would expect it to be the normal wait to get a table as it is always full then a polite staff getting you seated 
from the menu I had Chicken manchow soup 🍜 which was full of flavour then I had the basic chicken fried rice 🍚 and chicken manchurian well the food was exactly how they have always been from the starting,proper spices,perfect taste.They have a very friendly staff to.  In short definitely worth visiting.

So basically it is a very well known place in park street. I have visited a thousand times but never wrote a feedback because i never felt like it needed one-everyone knows it's awesum! But what made me write today is coz i visited the restaurant recently and experimented the chelo kebabs. I was completely surprised with its taste. The kebabs were amazing! The portion was more than enough to have a happy and full tummy. 

The .5 reduction is because the plate lacked salad, else its a complete meal.

Visited here last afternoon for lunch. What a lovely place it is. You can get here pure flavour of china from the decoration to foods. Low lights with some melodies musics always playing back ground, stuffs are very polite and always suggest you the best dishes for what you want. So,you can blindly trust of their choices. The taste of food is awesome, food quantity is more than enough on your expectation, price is reasonable and love the environment. 

Want to visit here again and try different dishes. Always suggest my friends/family members to go there if they want pure Chinese food with proper Chinese environment. 

Thanks a lot BarBQ for made my Friday noon.

Went there with high hopes after a whole bunch of my friends recommended it, but unfortunately was seriously disappointed with the taste of the food that was served. Portions were good and the staff was courteous. Ordered chilly potato which was so bad that couldn't even finish half of it. Saw the chilli garlic rice marked as red in the menu card and hence ordered it thinking it to be a non veg item but surprisingly it came as a veg item. The devil's chicken was somewhat better compared to this other ones in terms of taste. Hopefully will come back to try some different dishes next time.

And i can say this sauce is the best thing ever... overall this place has a good ambience.. the staff was understanding and I'd recommend this place if you would like to have Chinese cuisines

The good ol' restaurant of the time since I actually started exploring eating joints with self-earned money. Not too hifi in terms of interiors and vibes, but the food they serve are too good. I have been a fan of their non-veg kebab platter ever since. Have not explored the cocktail collection yet but they do serve bacardi and carlesberg in decent prices. The service is amazing - from server to manager, all of them will always welcome you with smiling faces. No doubt this old school place is still a full house on weekends. So do visit with enough time on weekends as you may have to wait to be seated.

Bar BQ has been a legendary eatery of Park Street, where Bengalis flocked for Chinese cravings in the 1990s and early 2000s, however, the times seem to have come to a standstill for Bar BQ ever since, as there has been no innovation in the menu.
With modern Chinese places such as Yauatcha, The Wall, Mainland China etc, in the city, the contemporary, cosmopolitan, Kolkata dweller has no reason to go to Bar BQ, where food choices still remain confined to Kung Pao, Hunan Chicken and Chilly Chicken and a few of its varieties. The ambience is no such of a stunner too and the prices remain at par, with their much more sophisticated competitions.
There are other issues too. The restaurant closes for orders after 3pm and remains so till 6pm, the time when a lot of people go out to eateries for lunch/brunch. On our last visit, we landed at Bar BQ at 3pm, when the waiters blatantly refused to get us seats and take our order, after a lot of coaxing, they agreed, but as expected there weren't many dishes available. We finally ordered mixed fried rice, noodles and Yunnan Chicken. They didn't have any desserts to serve. We ordered Bloody Mary, LIIT and cosmopolitan for drinks. The drinks were well made. But there could be no refills. The food tasted ordinary like home cooked Chinese. There was no attention paid to garnish or serve it esthetically. The worst part? The plates were stinking of raw fish/eggs, which means they don't wash the plates well. After asking they replaced the plates, but the stink persisted. The bill nevertheless came to 1676. The waiters were still shamelessly hankering for tips.

Went on some days back with a friend on her insist as Chinese her favourite, now coming to the ambiance, went up it's little dark but overall nice. Ordered Mandarin fish, may be some kind of sea fish,  1 chicken dish and Noodles. The portion size was humengous I mean we both couldn't finish off that much but the taste was up to the mark. Pocket pinch 1k for both of us. Mind it - the waiters may expect tip.

BarBQ is relatively a cheaper place in park st. Area to enjoy good chinese food, compared to others. Food is excellent , both in taste & quantity for eg. One plate of mixed rice can be serverd to 3 people easily. This place is always overcrowded so its very difficult to get a seat even in weekday evenings. Service is NOT quick at all. Ambience is good.

This place gets a 3 because of the poor service on that Thursday night. The place was packed with people. We were given a place to sit within 5 minutes. But the service that followed was quite bad. We were served wrong drinks to begin with. The food however tasted well (we picked the Chinese menu options) , but took too much of a waiting time and follow ups.

Situated right in the busy and happening street of park Street where all the famous restuarants align, flurrys, Peter cat, barbeque nation and more. We decided to try this restuarant suddenly as all the others were full on Holi.
Service - Good. Gives enough attention as this place was overflowing with patrons on that busy Holi day.
Food - Must try ( chilli garlic chicken peri peri) - boneless pieces of chicken cooked with garlic and loads of spices. It was juicy and throughly enjoyed this starter. We also tried chilli chicken drumsticks ( nothing special - found it to be a bit undercooked too), chicken tandoori ( very good) and lastly chelo kebab. 2 pieces of mutton, chicken kebabs with capsicum, tomato and freshly cooked rice with a poached egg on top with butter. chelo kebab was equally good however there was something amiss with the mutton kebab.
Overall - quite good restuarant. Ambience is perfect. Enjoyed throughly. This joint specializes in Chinese and it did. Would definitely visit again to try more items.

If you're in for Chinese, don't forget to try the Konjee Crispy Chicken along with Barbq special Chowmein or Barbq Special FriedRice. Kunga pao Chicken and Schezwan Chilli Pork is also a must have at Barbq.

impressive decor , nice staff as well as the ambiance makes up for the not- so-lip smacking- food. I tried the pork Manchurian and the caramel custard . Pork was soft and juicy , not overcooked (which most restaurants end up doing). overall a nice place to have a date night or even family dinner.

It was my first visit after hearing about this renowned restaurant for a long time. Located just opposite Flurys on Park Street, it is very easy to spot the restaurant. The ambience was quite nice, calm and quite. The decor is classic with comfortable seating arrangements.

Now coming to the food..I had heard a lot of good things about their Chinese dishes and we were not disappointed. We ordered Red Pepper fish and Drums of Heaven for starters. Both were excellent in taste. In mains, we chose Chicken fried rice and Devil's Chicken. The quantity of chicken fried rice is more than enough for 2, maybe even 3 people. It was well-prepared too. The sauce of Devil's chicken was a little under seasoned but the meat was soft. For dessert, we went for Caramel Custard and Hot Chocolate fudge. Both the dishes were delicious. However the desserts are just enough for one. The service was efficient and the staff was very courteous. All in all, it was a great meal and I would definitely visit again.

Checked for a late lunch on sunday.. It was packed up, finally after waiting 2minutes, we got a place to sit.
Needless to say, the decor and ambience is really good, best for a family dinner. Service and food was good too.
The kebabs were soft and had a distinctive flavor. Had Kung pao fish, loved it. But i somehow didn't like the rice noodles. 
Overall, an okay experience. Would surely visit again.

Went on Saturday at around 1:45 pm.....Wat Seperates this from the other nearby places is perhaps the size.... As soon as we Went upstairs the person asked whether we wud be having North indian or Chinese.... On hearing Chinese he escorted us to the section of Chinese..... We decided to go for chilli garlic pepper chicken in starter....We had that with a beer and a 60ml of vat wich came anyways with chanachur(chakna)as a freebee....In the food part we asked for mixed fried rice and the person aaked us wud we like to go with pork...As it didn't say in the menu the ingredients of it....Very thoughtful I must say....And a mixed chowmein.....The quantity was huge for both of them....The chowmein had ample veggies as well and pieces of chicken wantong as well....And they were crunchy as well as soft (the noodles)in the main course we had sweet and sour fish (my friend seemed to Have enjoyed that thoroughly though I didn't like it much for it's overdominance of sweetness.... Liked the kungpao chicken alot.... Both again had lot of quantity....The entire dishes sufficed for 3gluttons like us.....The bill aling with drinks came to 2300.... Must visit for every food lover

Nothing to be excited about authentic Chinese taste. Mediocre food I would say. Ambience was good. I visited on Valentine's day, with my friends and the waiter actually wished us in the end. That was pretty good. Both the chili garlic pepper chicken and the chicken fried rice were okayish. Summing up the quantity and the taste, food is a bit overpriced here. Even a common cocktail like cosmopolitan was not available. The lime soda tasted a bit weird and it even turned bitter by the end of the meal. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend to try out.

If you're looking for Authentic Chinese, this is the place to be. Located right at Park Street and very very famous here, one should definitely try Bar-B-Q. Great ambience, exceptionally delicious food and very well mannered staff. Best part here, you get full bottles of beer unlike just the pints. We ordered the special Bar-B-Q chicken which was amazing. Perfect blend of soya as well as barbeque sauce and also the perfect thing to much on to while ordering drinks. For main course, we had Fish in chilli soya sauce and Prawn hakka noodles. The noodles were full of prawns and the fish was too tasty. Loved this place, on my favorite list from now on.

BarBQ has always been of my favourite restaurant. A place which serves quality food at reasonable price.
I've had Chinese everytime that I've visited here.
My favourite starters are Chicken Fried Wantons, Drums of Heaven (which also tastes heavenly) and Red Pepper Chicken (it's tad bit spicy).
I like their BarBQ Special Chowmein and their Mixed Fried Rice is also good. 
For side dishes Hunan Chicken and Kung Pao Chicken is worth tasting.
To sum up, this is a great restaurant with great ambience and extremely kind and well mannered waiters. This place will never let you down. Do visit BarBQ, at Park Street.

BarBQ is one of the first restaurants that comes to any Calcuttans mind when you talk about North Indian! They have built this brand over the years by constantly serving quality food and catering to the masses by maintaining their prices. 

Keep going back for their Paneer tikka, dal makhani and the aloo do piyaza!

Arguably the best place in Kolkata if food is the only thing you are concerned about because the food quality is unmatchable. However, due to the kind of rush this place witnesses, the service quality as well as the behaviour of the waiting staff has reduced considerably. Still a must visit place if you havent already.

Well, what can i say about this place that hasn’t been already said earlier? 😜 its one of a kind place.

Have visited it whenever i wanted to eat good chowmein. Have visited it when guests came out of town n i wanted them to taste best ok Kolkata. Have visited it with a group of friends having varied tastes ranging from ind to chinese. Have visited it on those days when i just want to go out n have good food without worrying if the food will turn out to be good.. In short, i don't really need a reason to visit this place! Just go there n find it for yourself!! You'll Love it!

The veg hakka noodles, devil's choice, babycorn, spicy american corn, kebab platter, naan, kulcha, paneer... Everything just tastes delicious over here.

Just sit under the low lights, relax in the comfy seats, listen to people talking around animatedly n enjoy the food.

This was on my wishlist for quite a while..and yesterday was the day when I finally made it .A decent restaurant with good food food service ...well should have done a little justice to the name adding some real barbique dishes..which weren't there...but making both the menus for Chinese and Indian was a good job...and food was pretty good too.The good part of the restaurant was that it had decent dining areas for bar and restaurant both..which is good enough to handle more crowd...the decor was pretty decent as well..and the servers were doing a good job as well..hence making it a decent dining experience all together .

One of the best places in Park Street in Kolkata which never disappoints. On a warm winter afternoon we had a wonderful time over some Chinese food and lots of conversations with friends. I missed the starters but the Hakka Chowmein, the Sweet & Sour Fish, Schezwan Chilly Chicken more than made up for the same.  When the chowmein tastes wonderful without any accompaniment, you know it has been prepared to perfection. I liked the chicken better than the sweet and sour gravy since it had the spicy zing that I was looking for.
 The surprise was the chocolate eclairs served with a scoop of icecream. Strips of chocolate, batter fried and served with ice cream. One bite into the eclair and the soft gooey chocolate oozed out. Do try this out if you drop into Barbq

Always in awe of the Chinese section! The quintessential Park Street charm is not experienced at too many other places.. The delightful ambience and the wonderful architecture is indeed a treat for the customers. The layout is commendable and the lighting too. Coming to the food, Chicken with cashewnuts and Hunan chicken are my favourites.Lovely assortment of deserts. Unfortunately I do not quite have a sweet tooth. The classic vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce is what I stick to. totally recommended if you want a memorable experience!

The service in the place is abysmal. The servers are rude and seem to be in a hurry all the the time. The plates are stained and the napkins are dirty. The beverages are ordinary at best. The food was mostly good though, especially the fried prawns. The garlic fish was really sweet and had too much tomato which ruined the taste of everything else.

I had heard quite a lot about the ambience and yes, the rumors are true. The ambience here is excellent. We were 12 in person and reaching at 9PM inside the restaurant we came across a big queue. So the first thing I would recommend is table reservation with family or with date.
We finally had our seats by 10.30PM but the wait was a worth. The ambience was tantalizing. By then our hunger and reached its peak. We ordered a whole lot of items. Starting with Veg Mushroom and Chicken Wanton Soup. They were quite good. In starters we went for Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Chicken Tikka Kebab and Murg Kalimirch Kebab. They were good but I would prefer not a standout. 
Moving to the glutton's paradise, the main course. We went for Tandoori Roti, Cheese Nan, Garlic Nan, Lachha Paratha and Chicken Biryani, helping ourselves with Chicken Bharta, Chicken Dopiaza, Chicken Reshmi Masala and Chicken Tikka Masala. After this lot we ordered for the top recommended dishes Kung Pao Chicken, Devils Chicken and Szechuan Chilli Pork. To the disappointment Devils Chicken was not spicy at all, though the pork was good. We decided not to go further for any desserts. As we finished the table was cleared but finger bowl were not provided and we had to settle for tissues. The management must regret this fault.
Amidst this feast we also had some drinks and one has to admit that they have some fine reserves of scotch. Starting with 3 beer Haywards 5000, Kingfisher Premium and Tuborg Strong. Then some of us had hard drinks Honey Bee, Vat-69, 100 Pipers and Black Dog. The bill was hefty too. 
They don't mention but the price in menu are exclusive of tax.

In a nutshell the experience was good and I am looking forward for a visit again.

I prefer Chinese so always vote for panfried noodles, Kung pao chicken,panfried fish mixed Fried rice,schzwan chicken and others. Last not the least end up with Darshan and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.💝💝💝💝

Park street is a restaurant hub for Kolkata and this place deserves special mention.It is quite easy to locate.The place is huge and it is always packed up.

They serve both chinese and north indian cuisine.We ordered

Chinese Cuisine :

▪Chicken Hakka Noodles - Tastes good enough.

▪Barbq Special Fried Rice - One of my favourite dishes.Recommended.

▪ Chilli Pork - This was good enough too.

Indian Cuisine :

▪ Mutton Galauti Kebab - Loved this dish.Highly recommended!!

▪ Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala - Again a good dish.

▪ Tandoori Roti - It was a bit overcooked,still it is not worth a complaint.

▪Chicken Latmekai - This is not mentioned in the menu but it is really amazing.Definitely a must try.

Mocktails :

▪ Pineapple Blossom - Loved it !

The service was really good.The quantity of the food was more than enough for the 4 of us.

Had a great time 😘😘

I had some chinese food and a pint of beer. The food was good and the price was reasonable. The next time i went there we had the north indian dishes. We were 2 people and we had no idea about the quantity of food and it could serve 4 easily. We ended up wasting some. But overall the experience was good and the ambience was classy. Would recommend a visit.

One of the best restoras in town surely. Interior decor is beautiful, spacious and consists of three sections. I dined at the Chinese section and the overall experience turned out to be amazing. The food is great here. Best thing about the food here is the quantity. You can easily share one plate of rice among 2 people. Also one place of chicken can be shared by 2/3 people easily. I loved the dish Kungpao chicken. Also schezwan chicken wasn't bad either. The ambience is perfect for dining with your family or friends. Need to visit it again and try out the other sections.

They have a huge sitting capacity but this place is always over crowded, so you might have to wait for good 15 minutes before you can get a table for yourself, if you have not booked in advance. You might find the place a little noisy because of too many people. The ambience is good with courteous service staff. The quantity is good and reasonably priced. They serve a variety of mocktails, cocktails and hard drinks with Chinese and North Indian cuisine. I have visited this place number of times with friends, family and on a couple date and it suits all. Their Chinese dishes are simply amazing. I personally love chilli garlic noodles, manchurian, chelo kebab, chilli babycorn, dahi kebab and virgin pinacolada. North Indian food is good too. 

P.S. - I am a vegetarian but my husband loved their non-vegetarian food too. Recommended for both veg and non-veg.

BarBQ still stands as one of my favorite go-to Chinese restaurants despite tough competition from the newer restaurants. After being there for about a thousand times, I returned to BarBQ after 3 yrs of deprivation of Kolkata Chinese Food. 
Even on a weeknight, the place was packed and we had to wait for 15 minutes. 
My first disappointment was the lack of a high chair for my baby. Dining with a wiggling baby in arms is not the most fun experience, any parent will know. 
Service and staff have been and still is good. 
The food disappointed me a little. We had Konji Crispy Chicken, Szechuan Chicken and Hot Garlic Hakka noddles. While the chicken dishes were fine, the noodles was not at par. Over the years the quality may have come down a couple notches. 
Having said that, BarBQ is still a place a Chinese food lover should visit when in Park Street Area. It is a classic and will remain so in the hearts of old fans.

Tried Indian food recently and I felt that their desi variety is as good , if not better , as the new-age mughali/desi restaurants in South Kolkata . This place doesn't have the ambience or the customer service , but go to BBQ for the food  !!

This place is always over crowded although they have a large sitting capacity, so make sure you make your booking in advance. Their ambience is good and their service is great. Ordered indian cuisine and that taste amazing.

Do your bookings in advance.. although there is a large seating capacity but the place is generally crowded.. service was good .. the staff were also polite... decent ambiance.. reasonably priced...

the quantity of the food is huge.. so order accordingly.. we had chilly garlic noodles, Hakka noodles, manchurian, fresh lime soda, spring rolls, crispy chilly potato etc .. everything was too good in Chinese... But the taste of the Indian food was just average...
In desserts, we had taken tutti fruity which was yummy!! 
Overall I found it as a good Chinese outlet!!

Situated in Park Street, one of the posh areas of Kolkata, this outlet is too good in terms of everything - ambience, food, hospitality. 
The quantity of food items per plate is sufficient for 2 people. We went in a group of 9.
For starters, we had #Chicken_wings and #Crispy_chilli_chicken_boneless. In the main course, we had #Veg_hakka_chowmein, #Pan_fried_veg_noodles, #Chilli_chicken_boneless and many others. In the dessert section, we all had #Vanilla_icecream_with_hot_chocolate_sauce.
For all foodies out there, go there and treat yourselves.

To get a different experience, went completely veg this time. Although I won't deny, I was skeptical! So we went to Flavours of China which is one of the sections of BarBQ serving Chinese. First thing, making a reservation is recommended here. This place is very easily locatable. We ordered crispy baby corn chili followed by manchow soup. For the main course we had Devil's Spice and Green Thai curry along with Chili noodles and Burnt ginger capsicum rice. Another thing, the quantity per serving is also more here so order judiciously else you would end up skipping the dessert and even parcel the remaining stuffs. Anyways, it was a good experience altogether.

Ambience- Good
Food-Good
Service-Good

Tried booking a table for a biggish group of young people and was told 'No reservations on weekend. First come. First served.' I called once more to be doubly sure. Same answer. Once there, restaurant staff claimed big groups need to make a reservation first. And they have the temerity to be in the hospitality business.

Bar b q has been a personal favourite of mine since years. I visited yesterday with my family and sad to say I was really disappointed. First of all the hospitality lacked somewhere. Although it was early dinner and there wasn't much customer rush the servers were much reluctant to serve. It almost took 10 minutes for them to provide us the menu cards that too the Chinese menu card only. On asking we were given the tandoor items menu card.
Coming to the food. We ordered murgh kalimirch kebab, crispy fried chilly chicken, veg rice noodles, veg fried rice,kung pao chicken, prawn in hot garlic sauce and sweet lime soda. I must say food quality has much deteriorated since my last visit. The starters were good but the main course failed to satisfy me. Rice noodles seemed to be much dry with plenty of carrots and cabbage. Prawn dish was something which I disliked the most. They were huge balls of cornflour with small piece of prawn in it.
Coming to the cleanliness the napkins provided to us( although not present in table which I think should have been) were untidy and seemed to be used.  I could have rated much low but just the love for this place stopped me from doing so. Places like this should always try to keep up with their standards.

You will love this fine family dine in restaurant for the mouth watering taste. Be it Mughlai or be it Chinese they will make it exactly the way your taste bud will want. Service was good and it's reasonable and pocket friendly as well. The only thing I din like was the liquor menu. Well the menu was good but then they didn't have almost half of the things mentioned in it. Let's not talk about the booze but even simple mocktails were not present either. I ordered three from the menu all three were unavailable. So I planned to order beer. Well in beer also they have some patent brands. So I just felt that liquor menu was unnecessary.

Went there today at around 7 in the evening. Was lucky to get a table pronto. Ordered chicken sui mai, conjee crispy chicken, drums of heaven and chicken Hakka noodles. Portions were very generous and would suffice a family of 3. Taste is very very good with each dish having a distinct flavour. I was especially blown away by the sui mai. It was amazing. But  it was not part of the regular menu. The bill came around 1200 with taxes. They do not levy service charge. Overall it was a very good experience. I would definitely visit again. 

P.S. - To the management, kindly add lamb items to the menu.

Look no further than BarBQ situated just opposite to Flurys and it is a multistoreyed restaurant with the lower basement of the premise primary being a bar. The upper part of it is pretty decent and the long fans will remind you of old Kolkata. I've had loads of items off their menu and none of them disappointed me which is a hard thing to achieve knowing my fuss about food.

Of what I've tried, I've always liked. 

The food here is as authentic as it promises to be. The portions are good and filling.

On 31st I have enjoyed lunch at BarBQ with my friend to celebrate my birthday. When we have reached there was a huge crowd in the waiting zone and we thought we have to wait for minimum 1.5hour to have table. But surprisingly it was only 15-20minutes that we have to wait. Because the area the restaurant covered is truly very large. We have ordered #ChickenSheekKabeb at first..it was really delicious. Thereafter #PaneerPulao & #ChickenButterMasala with #Sprite was also good. But in case of Pulao there was some Biriyani's masala addded with, that smells and tastes a little bit odd in order to pulao. But overall it was good. 
At the end #JohnnieWalkerRedLabel with #Coke made the day extremely fantastic...It was totally a good experience at BarBQ...the foods, attenders, prices of all items are quite pocket friendly... it would be good if the distances between the tables would be much more so that it seemed less crowdy and possible to be privacy maintained.

Visited this place on christmas eve, fortunately  we got a table after waiting for just 5 mins.
The ambience is freaking awesum.
The service is also very  swift and the waiters are very polite.
The alcohol prices are slightly lower compared to other places in the area.
We ordered deep fried jumbo prawns. The prawns were fresh and quite large but lacked spices or flavors.
Next we had drums of heaven. It was soft,succulent and the spices were well balanced. Also I didn't know that this place served chinese.
Next we ordered malai chicken and tandoori chicken. The malai chicken simply blew us away. 
Finally my opinion  is if you visit this place just order the different kinds of chicken kebabs. Thats it!

We went there on new years eve and luckily got a table without prior reservation! Ordered long island ice tea, Chicken wonton soup, pan fried mixed meat noodles and sweet and sour pork. The food is really delicious. Both the quantity and quality is very good. Tbe noodles have plenty of meat and veggies. 

There are few scopes of improvement though. Sauces and condiments are not provided in the table unless asked ( barring salt ,pepper and freshly made red  chilli sauce). After the meal, at the time of billing, no mouth freshener or toothpick was provided. One can expect that from a restaurant of this stature.

But the taste of the food will make you forget everything.

After loads of photoshoots on the day of Christmas it was quite obvious on our part that the rats were loitering here and there in our tummy. So we thought to check in this outlet. Well I really liked the ambience but unfortunately cz f being of devoid of a whole lot of a concrete group we were sent downstairs for enjoying our meal whose ambience was not so happening according to me. Now getting to the revw straight all I wanna say is I loved the food, the liquor and the friendly behaviour of the staff as well. But yes the quantity of the food was real less as expected. But the taste was lipsmacking. Liked it and wish to visit once again.

Terrible experience. Sequence of events: 

1. School friends(6 of us) with empty stomachs and sufficiently full wallets reach Bar B Q, Park Street around 6:30 PM.

2. We go upstairs, and are asked to wait till 7. We ask for the menu card, and decide what to order.

3. At 7, we are told, in a not-so-decent manner, to go downstairs, as we were all-boys(thereby, by default assumption, trouble makers).

4. Fine then, we go downstairs, asked to wait outside again as someone was having "one last peg" inside.

5. The "last peg" never really ended. An employee(for lack of a better word), harshly told us, "Bahar thehriye, let our guests finish." We were literally sent out hungry! 

Drunken brats over would-be responsible citizens of the nation. Well done Bar-B-Q!

Keep judging people by appearances and the dress they wear. If I return to this overpriced supercilious shithole of yours, I'll return as your owner! 
Staff - Super shit!
Ambience - sucks, reeks of drunken stink!
Food - Do you feel like eating here after all this?

One of the busiest restaurants in the city of joy, this place has become  a people's favourite throughout the years.
We headed to the restaurant for a lunch a few days after Christmas, and had to wait in a queue. This was rather confusing , as no one really seemed interested in helping us find a table . Also they do not have a waiting lounge, so people wee standing right next to diners, which was uncomfortable for both. 

We were soon given a table . The menu is short yet balanced with some great Chinese starters, main course  and desserts.

We ordered the chili garlic chicken, red pepper fish, chicken noodles and kung pao chicken. We didn't have to wait too long. The starters were tasty and the quantity served made as full even before the main course. The chowmein was rather bland. But the kung pao chicken made up for the lack in flavour . 
Overall it was a good experience , except for the staff who rather seemed disinterested.

Visited BarBQ on 27th dec at afternoon. First of all as we got seated the waiter didnt come to clear the table. Had to ask one of them after about 10 mins. Then time for d menu card.. again.. we had to ask. Neways.. the head waiter came to take the order. After ordering d food I asked if beer is available . The guy looked at me for sometime.. then asked me "Govt Id hai?" 
Me- "I have to search my wallet" 
(as I was searching my wallet)
Him- " Ek beer de dunga . Dusra nahi milega" 
( I had asked for one only not two)
Me- "ek hi chahiye. Mujhe abhi mil nahi rahi hain main kuch der baad aapko dikha dunga"
Him- "Mil nahi raha ya jeb se nikal nahi raha?"
Me- " I will definately show it to you."
He leaves.
After sometime I searched my mailbox and got a scanned copy of my passport.
Called him n showed him. 
Me- "Jeb se nikal nahi raha hai aisa baat nahi hai "
Him- "Whatsapp se aa gaya!?? "
Sees it n leaves.
This arrogant way of speech of d waiter just put me on shock. Is this the effect of some kinda heritage they hold? The modern days restaurant waiters like bbq nation, chowman , santas fantasea , grid, are so damn courteous and polite. And look at these idiots... 
There cud have been 100 other ways by which he cud hav asked me of this .. was really shocked by d behaviour.. food was good.. other waiters behaviour was good though they seemed to be in much hurry. No deserts were available except tuti fruti.. no beers were available except tuborg.. this is their standard and they call it heritage . Wont ever visit again. When I will spend d same i will definately visit some new restaurants where i'll get both good food as well as hospitality.

We visited there today (27 dec 2016) at around 1.30. We ordered King prawn in hot garlic sauce as side dish. First of all they served food quite late which is very unusual. When they served food we found the prawns were not at all king prawns. Bcoz I ordered the same dish on Friday, 23 December 2016 & I knew what king prawns sizes are & how many pieces king prawns they usually serve as thats our staple dish of BBQ for years!

Well, when they served, its no way king prawns & the colour too was different. When asked, Mr Krishna (who took the order) replied -- no ma'am this is king prawn. I explained him I visited 4 days ago and had the same food and size was really king and no colour of the gravy was reddish, not yellowish. Then One manager type person came up to our table and said -- Ma'am actually king prawns are not available not & thats the reason we served medium prawns and not 6 but 8 in piece.

Now its time for me to ask - then why are you charging king prawns price when its not king prawns and you should have informed me when you took the order or even after that. 

I had to pay king prawns price (Rs 415 in the menu card, they charged 420/- in the bill though) and what we had was normal medium prawns (Rs 315/-). 

Paying Rs 100 is not a factor but what a famous restaurant like Bar B Q did is nothing but -- CHEATING! 

I could have directly talked to the manager but Writing on Zomato or on FB (pics show the difference) is more effective. Atleast people would know before they order - what they order and what they are served.

Thank you...

For most people in Kolkata, this is a regular eating out spot. A bunch of us friends went there on Christmas Eve after walking up and down Park Street (which incidentally was relatively much less crowded) we wanted to have some beer and rest for a while. The staff was not only courteous but the service was great even though we hardly ate anything - it was beer and ice cream! A good memory made.

I went there with my friends on Christmas eve. They have got two places to dine, one the ground level and other one on the first floor. They didn't allow us to have our dinner on the first floor just because we didnt have any girls with us. And the other eating place was really dirty and there was literally food everywhere. Its was pretty illogical of them to have such a rule. I mean its 2016 dude. What kind of shit rule is that.

After waiting for about an hour (as it's Christmas Day), we finally got our seat. Me & my friends were crazily hungry so we wasted no time in deciding the menu. We ordered Crispy Chilli Chicken for starters, which came after another 30mins. Each plate had 12 pieces. Then we ordered 3 plates of Bar BQ special fried rice, Devil's Chicken & HongKong Chicken. All came relatively early. The food quality and quantity was good (value for money). But the staff behavior  was a little less polite, they did'nt bother to change the spoons & forks after starters and just simply took the tissue paper bunch & placed it on another table without asking for permission. They seem to give priority to families and couples.

Pathetic service. Had lunch yesterday. Ordered fresh lime soda along with other dishes. They don't have patience to mix the salt/sugar completely with the liquid that made taste yukk as I gulped it down.

Also, tell your waiters that giving tip is discretionary and they should not force customer for this shamelessly. While leaving one waiter came and whispered they haven't included service charge in bill. First of all it was very much included in bill secondly how the hell it matters to him.

Every item they served, spilled a portion of it in table. Overall, a big disappointment.

I loved this place! The food was delicious, affordable rates, quality and quantity was good too, pleasant ambience and satisfactory service.

Out of the option of Chinese and Indian cuisine, we ordered Chinese.

We were 8 people - 4 vegetarian and 4 non-vegetarian. Below is the food which We vegetarian's ordered:
1. For starters we ordered Chilli baby corn.
2. We ordered fresh sweet lime soda.
3. For the main course it was burnt ginger capsicum rice, vegetable hakka noodles, mixed vegetable mushrooms and corn in soya chilli sauce and bar b q special vegetable.

P.s. I really can't rate the non vegetarian food since I am a vegetarian and didn't have it.

I came here with my family on my Father's birthday and went ahead for Chinese for the night. We ordered Chicken Manchow soup, Drums of Heaven for starters, Pork Manchurian and Veg Chowmein for main course along with salty/sweet lime sodas. The food was very delicious but the Pork Manchurian tasted more of like chicken then pork. And the salty lime soda was too salty for our taste. But overall, it was a nice meal. The ambiance of the place was also very crowded for a Friday night with lots of sitting area. We didn't had to wait for our table, we got it right away. They apparently have two course: Chinese and North Indian I guess. The servers were despite of being very busy to serve so many people, paid attention to our time to time needs and also wanted tips at the end.

BarBQ is one of the default places to visit when Calcuttans urge for a classy ambience and a delicious meal. It's no different for me either. Both the Chinese and Indian dishes are amazing. That said one should be careful whilst ordering as certain dishes are lacking for eg the pan fried noodles, Chinese bhel etc. Those dishes best be avoided. However, the other dishes make up for it, with the babycorn, garlic noodles, Manchurian(Chinese), paneer tikka and black Dal(Indian) being my top choices to order. 
The service varies on the group. If you're a bunch of friends hanging out, the management does neglect you a bit, a family however is treated with hospitality. This discrimination should be changed.

Was in for lunch few days back
This was like my nth visit to this food haven. Just that this time I went almost after a gap of six months. The best attribute about this place is the consistency. 

I ordered:
Crispy Chilli baby corn
Pan fried Noodles
Burnt ginger capsicum fried rice 
Chilli garlic noodles
Tsing hoi potatoes

This place is heaven for noodle lovers. The pan fried noodles and chilli garlic noodles are just unmatchable. So are the soups and starters. This place has never dissapointed. It's where I go when I crave Chinese and I'm unwilling to experiment.

BarBQ the name itself is so heavy and popular among people. It is in the park street area. The place is best known for it's ●Chello Kebab's. The restaurant is good looking with a decent woody look. On my first visit to this place i had the ●Chello kebab. It was wonderful in taste and quality. Yes you can say ●Chello kebab's are best here. The place had a very good impression on my first visit. 
On my second visit, i went there with a close friend. We ordered : ●Mixed Chowmein
                                      &
                       ● Crispy pepper chicken
Now the things that disappointed me is their Service. 
No doubt the food was good. But their management and casuality disappointed me. 
▪ First of all they took a bit long time to serve the food. 
▪ After we are done nobody cared to bring the bill. 
▪ We waited atleast 10 - 15 minutes for the bill to come.
▪ They didn't even cared to give us the tooth pick and after meal spices for digestion. 
Over all it is really a nice restaurant but need to improve their service.

Everything is in place. Its a well known restaurant of town and really there is nothing to say about the food quality. The quantity of  each item was also impressive. We ordered one plate of mixed gravy noodles, one plate of mixed rice and one plate of hunan chicken and crispy chili lamb. All of these were really delicious. We also ordered some drinks and they served it in very pleasant manner. One thing to say just about the delayed delivery. Its a minor issue and probably it happened due to the heavy rush of weekend hours. My experience is overall good. I strongly recommend this restaurant for the people seeking authentic chinese cuisine in city.

Wax eloquent about this establishment and it will still be less in comparison to the standards that it has maintained, the yummilicious food they serve and the memories attached personally.  It is an icon no doubt but not that well known an icon and I wonder why. The Chinese food is worth coming back and back for. The chilli garlic pepper chicken, the schezuan chilli pork, the chicken and pork fried rice....oh man I am hungry once again. I went there after a long hiatus and was wondering why I settle for sub standard chinese around the city. This place should be my be all and end all and I vouch highly for it. Im definitely planning a return soon :)

A lot of memories attached with BarBQ, one of my favourite places. They have a cosy and spacious atmosphere, the people are very responsive and helpful. The food is lovely.
My all time favourite dishes include, Devils Chicken, Hunan Chicken, Golden Fried Prawns and Prawn Fried Rice. Its a good place to dine out with family and friends.

It's among the veteran restaurant in Kolkata, serving for decades. Since then the taste or the decor haven't changed much. Both Bar-B-Q and Flavors of China are under same management and have a common kitchen. Though a multi-cuisine restaurant, I would recommend Chinese. The food taste awesome and the quantity is good enough for two.

Well the legendary restaurant in Kolkata, this review should have come much earlier. When you enter you fell the good vibes and the professionalism of the management, the servers the manager's the supervisors are all top notch, fulls marks for that.
Ambiance is exactly what you expect from a dine dining restaurant.

We ordered veg kabab platter and chilli pepper panner for starters. The panner and broccoli portions was great. Pepper panner was kinda okay, high on spices. Indian main course is very good here, the naans are full in size and properly cooked and it won't become butter naan even if eaten after some time.

Comming to desert tuti fruity is a speciality here and make sure you try it it your next visit.

Maybe one of d best Chinese cuisine in park street. The ambience nd decorations is top of level,time management nd good behavior also . A gala dinner after so many days. We ordered Honey bee, Foster's(pint) nd virgin blue lagoon, nd then barbq special pan fried noodles, Singaporean chicken, Szechwan chilli pork , kung pao chicken with friedrice. All foods r too good nd yummy. Not so crowded in durga puja times bt it's very crowded in winter season.. I went there more than 3 times.

The ambience, the crowd, the food and the staff, all just made BarBQ really worth every dime spent. We opted for Chinese, which was damn delicious. Fish pepper fry was amazing. It had the perfect taste and just melted as soon as you took a bite of it. I would strongly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great Chinese food and a great evening in the Park Street area. Looking forward to come back soon and try more of it.

Some places just have that thing about them which keeps calling you back to them, and well, barbq definitely has that about it. 

From the time they used to give me free balloons to the time I started ordering beers and hopefully till the time I order wine, I have and shall keep frequenting barbq. I'll try to list down a few dishes which have been my favourite over the years: 

Indian Food - Paneer Tikka, Bharwan Aloo, Chicken Tikka Masala, kaali daal, paneer butter masala, chicken tikka, garlic naan and CHEESE NAAN (please, please try it if you haven't yet and let me know in the comments what you thought of it)

Chinese food - fish fingers, chilli chicken, chicken in garlic sauce, mix fried rice/noodles (has pork also! YESSS!!!)

For dessert though their tutti fruity is the most famous, you can even go for the chocolate mousse. 

Exceptional service and amazing managers

I went for a lunch with my friend and it was my 1st visit. The ambience is the 1st thing that you will notice which is really beautiful. It was a bit crowded though, still it didn't effect much. Coming to the food, we ordered fish fingers, chilli garlic fried rice and hunan chicken. For drinks my friend ordered a beer and I ordered a mocktail named Cinderella. Fish fingers were so good..crispy outside and soft fish inside; it is served with mayonnaise. The rice and chicken dishes were also really good. The quantity of the food was more than enough for two people I must say. This place is highly recommended pls do visit once. :)

Flavours of China make up for one of my nostalgic places. Since the school days till date into my legal profession, I have always liked their Chinese food. It is simple, subtle and de glamorous but it is still classy and regal in its own way. Large portions, quality food and of course the signature chimney soup that have created so many memories with friends just for the mere reason it does not get finished even at the end of the meal. A beautiful place to have a dinner with your gang!

Its an old famous place located in Park Street and you are bound to relish some good chinese food once you are here. 

It was friends meet and we decided this venue as all of us have some fetish and craze over chinese cuisine. Its generally crowded most of the time but we were lucky that we didnt have to anticipate much to get our places.

The place is quite spacious and copacetic. There are sofas and broad wooden chairs laid all over. The ambience is comfortable and gratifying with some decorations done with balloons and artificial saplings and flowers.

We had chicken manchow soup, chilli garlic chicken and red pepper fish for starters. The food was really well prepared and tasty. An adequate proportion is served which would easily suffice 3 people. The palatable dishes will lure you to order more and enjoy its authentic flavours.
For the mains we had burnt garlic fried rice and hunan chicken. The rice was zestful but the hunan chicken was on the sweeter side. However you will appreciate  the items that will be served for its delicacy.

You should definitely visit this place if you love chinese cuisine and unravel the taste by experiencing some real delectable dishes.

The kebabs were really good. I had the dahi, chicken reshmi and the veg seekh. Hot and sour soup was good and not too spicy. The ambience was not very great as it was very dim and u could barely see anything. Veg mushroom soup was nice. The chilli garlic noodles were very good(very spicy too)! The quantities are very large so beware before ordering. Also the veg manchurian was amazing.

I have countless memories here. The first time I went here was for my birthday treat with friends and though I had little doubts about their service, it turned out to be better than what I had anticipated.There is a room inside for bigger groups. A picture has been attached.The menu is a mix of Chinese cuisine and North Indian platters, sure to fill you right up. Another Park Street oldie, this is a popular haunt for office-goers, especially those who like their Chinese food. The Indian menu is rather sparse, but the items are good, especially the Chelo Kebabs. So, if youre craving a spicy Tom Yum Soup or a plate of Mixed Chowmein, then walk right in. Good food,affordable rates,pleasant ambience and great service was all it took us to swear by Bar-B-Q !!!

Standing tall at a prime location, park street, the  quality of food in this restaurant is degrading day by day. The restaurant is spacious and the ambiance is also good, but the food isn't satisfactory. I've been here on a number of occasions and have tried  the noodles, kung pao chicken and hunan chicken. There is nothing extraordinary about the food.

Prices are also good beacuse they provide good quantity for a single bowl or for a single plate.  I always prefer taking my guests to this restaurant for an lunch or dinner.  For chinese food i will give Bar-B-Q a 5 Star.

My friends and I went there on Panchami for lunch. We expected to have a huge crowd, but surprisingly we got plenty of vacant seats.
The interior had a calming effect on us after the much hoolabaloo of pandal hopping in the crowd. The restaurant personnel were friendly.

Coming to the food, we ordered for Masala Kulcha, Chicken Bharta, Chicken Butter Masala, Noodles and fried rice (the last 2 were ordered by friends, so not sure about which one).The food quality was great. I liked their Masala Kulcha; it totally justified the higher price than other regular places. Other items were satisfying too.

However, there was a small bad experience at the time of leaving. A waiter asked for tips and was constantly nagging for it, saying its the Pujas and to give more tips. We had given a small amount and explained that we were students and it was not possible for us to pay lump sum amounts for tips.

I would give this restaurant a 4.0 rating, but am lowering the rating due to the constant nagging for tips. There's no point asking for such tips when we are already paying a Service tax for their service.

Apart from that, i will say its a good restaurant on Park Street.

I have been there few days back. it's a very popular joint in the park street area consists of three dining area, ambience was good.  we have to stand in a queue for some time to get a table. we have to  face some problem because we've decided to sit in the Chinese section, but after waiting for sometime we changed our decision and asked for another section is available or not. but they disappoint us. there is no chance for changing it.

we ordered red pepper chicken, red pepper fish, mixed rice, kung pao chicken. food was very scrumptious and was value for money.

next I'm coming to the staff. their staff's behaviour over the tips issue is very poor. They directly ask for it. It seems that they are only serving for tips. this behaviour is not expected from the staffs of the restaurant like Bar-B-Q.

over all enjoyed their food very much and we're very busy to eat, so that we've forgotten to take any picture..

Have always been extremely fond of this place since my college days. The "park street" vibe, the just perfect ambience is too hard to resist. The food has always been awesome, well, not anymore it seems. Visited the place on 14th oct '16, and the food was ordered, as usual with high expectations, only to be shocked to see how low the quality has become. The pan fried noodles was overdone with soya sauce and could find any trace of the noodles been fried. The mixed fried rice seemed to be soaked in oil.
As we were approaching 3.00pm, which probably is the time when their kitchen closes, all the staffs seemed to be in too much hurry to see the back of us.
All I can say is that i went in expecting to refresh my experience at this place, and now i will think twice before stepping again.
Wishing them all the best for the future, and hope they set things right in the future.

Awesome place to have lunch/dinner
Ambience: Is good though always crowded.But a very cozy place to be. The service here is good and caring
The Food:
The Food here is provided at an apt amount at a reasonable price. Good place to go for dinner/lunch when you are low on cash/money.
They make quite nice fried rice  and are known for their
1. Hunan Chicken: Nice and less spicy
2. Devil's Chicken: Bit spicer and hot
- Among the starter Drums of heaven is nice. 
- American Chop suey: They serve is enough for 1 person.
Better not to try the indian dishes here as it might disappoint you.
- Garlic Chicken: Is also nice but not one of my favorites
Location: It's very easy to locate and very hard to miss and it is advisable to reserve if you are planning to go there during the holidays.
Note: It is one of the oldest restaurant in PARK STREET area and has been a part of many of my memories, but sadly it has not upgraded it's array of dishes with time.. So it now serves the common Chinese dishes at a reasonable price and good quality & quantity.

Went there on panchami... Ordered for red pepper chicken and pepper garlic chicken as starters,  for main course we had ordered chicken reshmi butter masala and tandoori roti..

The Red Pepper Chicken was really Lipsmacking... It had perfect flavours and seasoning..  This was the best dish among everything we had ordered.

The Pepper Garlic Chicken we ordered was also good but itbwas way too salty.. Which ruined the taste of the dish..

The gravy of the Chicken reshmi butter masla was good but the chicken used in the preparation didn't seem quite fresh... It was very average in taste..

Now coming to the tandoori rotis... They were hard like really very hard... Paying Rs.45+ taxes for such kind of a tandoori roti was very disappointing..  Even the roadside dhabas make better rotis than them...

Now the entire experience was ruined by the staff behaviour at the end over a tipping issue... It seemed like they will only serve you well if you tip them..such a type of behaviour is not expected from a restaurant like Bar-b-q... 

My rating is only based on the food.. If i had to rate it otherwise,  i would have rated it 0..

The ambiance is just so amazing, the food was great and so the hospitality of the staffs who attended us. I would say it is one of the best place in Kolkata to dine with family or friends. The food and drinks are also fairly priced. So if you want to spend a great evening this is the place you should be in.

This is one of the oldest in town and also in the heart throb of the city, park street. Bar-b-Q serves decent chinese and indian food. 
quantity is also fair enough and not very much high on the pocket. Ambience is good. 
I had visited with my bunch of friends were we tried their kabab platter, chelo kabab, hunan chicken , golden fried prawns and their chilli garlic fried rice.

Overall a very satisfying experience. This never gets old so visit is a must.

Does BarBQ really need a review? 
Well. We went on a Saturday night and got a table for two in 10 minutes thanks to the managers in the middle section who were super nice to us :D We ordered a portion of American Corn Pepper Salt which is eternally amazing! We also had the black channa which was quite tasty too. 
Mains were the classic Chilli Garlic noodles and Devils choice both amazingly made. We got great service as well considering the rush. BarBQ never disappoints.

This place needs no introduction, and is located a few metres away from Oly pub, and is  diagonally opposite au bon pain, park Street. The staircase leading to the first floor was teeming with people , All waiting for their turn, during peak dinner hours on Ashtami and Nabami. The wait fortunately was not long, and we got a seat after roughly 15 mins . The décor looks cosy , with warm lighting and a comfy ambiance. The staff here are excellent, providing us with amazingly attentive service even during the rush hours of pujo! The food here is equally good , and value for money . The pan fried mixed noodles with pork was more than enough for two , and had chunky pieces of chicken, pork and vegetables, and tasted great. The schezuan pork tasted amazing too , with chunky pieces of pork cooked to perfection, and went well with the noodles. The mixed fried rice tasted very light , yet filling . The pork Manchurian had more gravy than the schezuan pork , and paired well with the rice . The alcohol is served separately by the bartender , and you can check the temperature of the beer , whether it is to your liking or not. The crowd consisted mostly of family members having a good time out during pujo . Overall had an awesome experience and would love to visit this place again!

The biryani is amazing and any curry or side dish that one takes is mild yet tasty, free of oil and unnecessary spices. The batter fried chocolate is a unique dessert available here. The place is vast. Gets a queue mostly but a place is assured, and food is always uncompromised.

Not as well as the name is. The food was not at all tasty. even the food were served after more than 30 minutes. We were feeling really offended from the very first time.
We ordered-
1. Drums of heaven: This was the only good thing that we could eat.it was crispy, crunchy; served with capsicum, onion, garlic. The quantity of garlic was a bit extra and this made the dish fabulous.
2. Pork Hakka chowmien - the noodles was very salty, it was like  street food. Sometimes the 
Street food is better than it. The pork in the chowmein wasn't fully boiled. Not edible for any human being, we couldn't finish it all.

3. Sliced chilli pork - this dish looked very beautiful, not to eat.  Pork pieces were not boiled here too.

After reading this review, if you wanna waste your money you can go there. The place is very well decorated.You will be served high quantity foods, but don't expect the high quality. Very disappointed as it is a legendary restaurant and the expectation was high.

BarBQ was always there in my bucket list. On Saptami,2016 I decided to give my pending birthday treat here. We were a group of four friends. Before getting a table we had to list down our names as it was the peak hour of the day. The staffs were very spontaneous and cooperative. We ordered BarBQ Special Fried Rice( without pork), Devils Chicken, Chicken Malai Kebabs & Chicken Biriyani. The service is pretty decent. The food was lip smacking and sumptuous. The dishes were more than enough in quantity to serve the four of us. Our Saptami got sorted. Keep up the good work BarBQ.

This place has always been my favourite, but having come down from Pune - the place with literally no good Chinese , I am literally bowled this time ! The best part - Couldn't complain about one single thing.
Ordered :
Chicken sweet corn soup
Golden fried prawns
Crispy chicken
Mixed Hakka Noodles
Mixed fried rice
Fish Manchurian (and I'm a Bengali who doesn't eat fish for a change ! But Barbq made me !)
The food was just top notch , Chinese at its best !

If you are like me who can live on Chinese food, this is the place to be :-)
Barbq just made leaving Calcutta harder ! Keep up the good work guys \m/

The food quality is excellent as always. Both the Chinese and Indian section,their quality and quantity justifies their price. 
Staffs were also friendly but I'll cut points as a few of their captains and senior staffs are quiet a bit snobbish and proud, who are not quiet professional and not approachable.

Last day went there for lunch with my friends. We had to wait for 45 minutes due to the pujo rush but that was totally worth it. The ambience and the staff everything was very good. 
We ordered Dried chilli chicken for the starters and for the main course we had vegetable pan fried noodles 🍜, schezwan chilli chicken 🍗 
Both of them were delicious 😋 
For  the drinks we had screwdriver in cocktail 🍸 and blossoms and fruit punch in mocktails. 
Will surely visit it soon again.

Last month on an evening we decided to visit the so called famous resteurant of Park Street, BarBQ ..with my friends..
Phew! Had we thought once again before taken such decision..One of the worst dining experience I had ever.
We asked Chimney soup, which is nothing but Vegetables and pork pieces thrown into warm water.They demanded that soup is for 4 persons, while the amount given was sufficient for no more than 2 persons at most.Then we ordered Chicken Szechwan Noodles and Devils chicken..Devils chicken is only thing we can eat..now the noodles..which is so much salty that we thought it was prepared by sea water 😞 .
And last but not the least, the staffs are adamant that the preparations are all ok,there is no problem with those.
So my kind advice to everyone, If you have any likings for your heard earned money and wanna at least good dining experience,never ever dare to visit such a horrible place called BarBQ on Park Street..A totally wasted evening for us..

This place is a Park Street institution, and it serves up to its fame. Chinese cuisine here is delectable, especially the lamb dishes. The ambiance is quite good, and the staff are well versed. However, the old, damp feel and the flickering lights did not exactly make us smile. But overall, proper value-for-money and a good experience.

Well, lunch on panchami had to be something special. Hence, return to this favourite place.
Always top marks for hygiene, ambience and service. Ordered the vegetable rice noodles. With shredded chicken and green pepper. Took 20-25mins to arrive. Quantity good, enough for two. Quality is one of best in this town. Staff was well mannered, courteous as usual. But the one serving us has serious body odour issues!
Rest all went well. Will always recommend.

My review is based on my last visit. We have grown up going to this place at least once a month. But it's deteriorated. A lot! The food doesn't taste the same, in fact no where near. For us Chinese food used to mean BarBQ, however now there are better places. I wish they improve their quality to come back. Most of us who continue to visit do so because of the legend it carries.

This was my umpteenth visit but unlike other fabulous times, I was disappointed tonight. The famous crispy chilly baby corn was nowhere close to what this restaurant serves. It was rubbery and difficult to chew. On reporting, however, we were politely offered an alternative dish (crispy chilly potato). The second disappointment came when we got our pan fried veg noodles. Minimal quantity and not at par with its usual standard. The chilly garlic noodles was however the only plus for us. I do hope to go back though, for this has been just one sad incident out of multiple good ones.

The term 'legendary' is an understatement when it comes to describing this restaurant. I have to admit my review is going to be extremely biased because this restaurant is our families 'go to' place when we craved for some good Chinese food. It has always pulled in crowds at every possible time of the day and week. Service is prompt and the managers here take it upon themselves to make you feel welcome and comfortable. We got a comfortable table next to one of the bay windows which overlooked the famous park street. I have literally tried most of their items on the menu but I'll be reviewing ones I ordered today:

Fried prawns-
Small pieces of prawns in a corn flour batter. More like prawn pakoras. Perfectly golden brown and crunchy. There was a slight creaminess in each bite. These were served with hot garlic sauce. The sauce could have been spicier.

Having had a long day at work and no food in our tummies, we decided not to waste anymore time and move straight to the mains.

Mixed hakka chowmein-
Noodles tossed with veggies and lots of meat and seafood. Wished for more chicken instead of pork.

Hunan chicken-
Shredded chicken in a thick schezwan sauce. Very tomato-ey. Spicy. But I found it hard to distinguish the texture of the chicken and the onions. Felt like the onions were undercooked. 

We ended our meal with caramel custard. I wasn't at all happy with the presentation though. The custard had disintegrated and was all over the plate. But tasted good. 

Do not come here expecting too much though. Come to barbq for some cheap, decent, pocket friendly, extremely indianised ( hey, we like it like that right?) Chinese food and to get the feel of dining in the heart of Park street.

I have been here countless number of times and never bothered to add a review because BarBQ had always meant the same to me - good food,good prices,good staff and a homely ambience. 
Yesterday was my birthday,and we decided to land up here after seeing that all restaurants were full. BarBQ too was full and teeming with people. We were given a table upstairs. My disappointment was about the food served. It was terrible and more of a shock to see the quality being so degraded after the last time I came here. 
I wouldn't sympathise because it's a restaurant's job to serve it's customers quality food,no matter how crowded it is. We ordered a pepper paneer and baby corn was starters. The paneer was okayish but then,I didn't like it much. The baby corn was pathetic. It was so hard and hardly cooked. We left all of it. 
The chilli garlic noodles was okayish and the vegetable coins in schezwan sauce very thick and tasteless. It wasn't spicy at all. 
The cocktails were okay. That was the only saving grace in the entire meal especially when we were charged 1852 for it. 
A legendary restaurant like BarBQ doing this to its loyal customers is a shock.   There are many eateries around, people. Do try others before coming here.
  Also,avoid this place during the pujas if the management thinks it can't handle huge crowds because the customers won't tolerate bad food.

One of my all time favourite places for a sumptuous meal! Landed here last evening right from office to enjoy a wonderful dinner. And needless to say, enjoyed every bit of it! Tried their chinese chopsuey with mandarin fish and pork manchurian for company...And oh boy! It tasted just so delicious. Though missed out on their fish fingers this time, will surely visit the joint again and try it out!! Overall, great arrangements, superb hospitality and beautiful decor. Added to that the dim lighting just sets the mood right :)
Bar B Q is a place which I keep visiting again and again for the quality it serves. A big thumbs up to you guys! :)

Having a great ambience, but not a great food at all. Chinese food has always been kolkata's comfort zone, but this place is suddenly running reverse. The service is very prompt that adds a point. Coming to the food, the rice and chowmein both lack the intense. Especially the chowmein is full of raw onions. Coming to their favourite dish- schezwan chilli pork- doesn't disappoint but had better preparations at other joints. The desserts are disaster- never have here. They write something and provide something. Overall update is needed asap for this joint. Competition is high folks.

Yesterday we had a small family get together. My brother in law who is from California visited Kolkata this week and we wanted to take him to a place where we can spend some quality time and enjoy a good meal. Well BarBq is one of my favourite restaurants in Park Street. I enjoy the meal and the ambience everytime I visit there. For the starters let us start with the" pan fried chilly fish", the taste was awesome. Well cooked. The fish pieces melted inside my mouth. Next comes the "mixed fried rice" and the "hunan chicken" as the main course and side dish. The fried rice was hit with my taste buds but, the side dish, i felt was just not upto the mark. I expected the "Hunan" to be a good complement to the rice, but unfortunately it was not.

We ordered the pan fried fish again to continue the good run with our taste buds. Had a great afternoon with my family.

After a tiring hot humid morning, I and my friends turned up to one of the famous food joints in the Park Street Area - Bar-B-Q for lunch. Turns out, the restaurant was almost packed but luckily we got seats then and there. The restaurant had a
sophisticated environment and the staffs were all very cooperative. We went over the menu for over a half an hour as there were a lot of items which sounded amazing in its name itself. We started off with the Chicken Szechuan Noodles along with
a side dish of Chicken and Prawn Spring Onions. Everything tasted undoubtedly heavenly but it was not sufficient for our stomachs. Subsequently, we ordered ourselves the Vegetable Pan Fried Noodles and Sliced Chilli Pork. Not a vegetarian fan, 
so did not like the pan fried noodles much. I ended up with just having the noodles and dumping the other veggies to my vegetable loving friend. The sliced chilli pork was just the cherry to the cake. It was equally spicey and tasty. A good lunch I would say with everything into consideration.

One of my favourites when it comes to fine dining. A very happening restaurant at Park Street , with Vintage interiors, well mannered staff, great food , well differentiated Indian and Chinese menus and drinks to choose from. A good option to pick for lunch or dinner party, or business as well. But a table reservation is recommended if your visit is a planned one. Else do be prepared for a long wait which can extend from 15 min to 45 min.

One of the best restaurants I've ever been in. The food is exquisite,the service is top notch and the atmosphere is mesmerising. Food served here is fresh and provided before time. It is a great place for family dinners or a brunch with some friends. If you are looking for some delicious continental and chinese food, BarBQ is where you should go people. The price is also reasonable.

BarBQ is quite an old restaurant in Park Street. It's been actually a lot of times I've visted this place since childhood. The ambience is pretty good, well suited for fine dining. Interiors are nothing over the top but nonetheless sober. Food is quite decent. I really like the Chinese Salad and American Corn Pepper Salt over here.

Hopped in there yesterday. The ambience is quite good. The crispy fried wings that came with their tomato ketchup was just too good. I liked the devils chicken as well. One of the best chinese that I've had recently. Well they dont charge you too much either. Special mention:: an A+ for the behaviour of the staff.

This place is one of the finest restaurants which serve Chinese and Indian cuisines. I went for the Chinese cuisine and was satisfied. Me and my girlfriend ordered fried chili baby corn for starters, the outer layering was a bit tough but the taste was on point. Later we had pan fried chicken noodles with double fried pork. Both the noodles and the pork were cooked to perfection, with a signature smoky flavour. The pork was tender and not over cooked.
We also had pina coladas and the flavour scored a perfect 10 here too. 
The ambience is awesome as well. The staff is well mannered and guides you about the dishes throughout.

Have been here many years back but this time it was a birthday treat so excited to write the review. As it was Sunday and we knew that it's going to be crowded so we took our entry by 7.30 for an early dinner and to avoid the queue. We got our seat in the top floor by the corner.
Started with a chilled beer - Fosters and ordered for Red pepper Fish.
It took half an hour for the starter to come. So by the time we carried on our beer with the snacks provided by them. When asked about the status of our order the reply came same from all the staffs serving that area was- it is a Chinese dish and so it takes time. And I was like what the hell... Anyway at a time I felt like cancelling the order and leave the place but atlast it came.
No doubt the Red pepper fish was awesome to taste. Very well cooked. Tender spicy fish pieces. Good in amount. But they need to check with their service as well. 
Later ordered for American choupsey. It came within 10 minutes. As usual the dish itself is sweet but I felt the sweetness a lil bit more. Anyway the crispy noodles with chicken pieces  and prawns topped by the tangy sauce made it a yummy choupsey. 
The table gave us continue trouble. The waiter tried to fixed it but can't. Anyhow it was a good experience from the aspect of food. And the ambience was always good.

I had ordered for pineapple blossom, veg platter, pan fried noodles and garlic chicken. Except for garlic chicken, the rest were as delicious as usual. Garlic chicken was a bit too sweet, though the manager had mentioned this while I was ordering. All in all, this place is a paradise for food lovers.

Affordable and mouth watering Chinese and Indian cuisine are the forte of BarBQ. It is a great place to go out on a date as one can have their privacy intact with huge seating space. It is divided into Indian and Chinese cuisine respectively which is a great idea. Chicken wanton and chicken sweet corn soup is delicious. Mixed Hakka noodles paired with kung pao is savoury.

One of the heritage trios - this one has two separate sections for Indian cuisine and Chinese cuisine. I satisfy my cravings for Indian food from this place. Their Lat-mi-Kai is great as a starter - juicy, tender and flavorsome. For main course Chicken tikka masala and butter naan beats every other delicacies. The chicken is soft tender juicy and flavorsome. Chelo kebab from Persian cuisine is really good. Overall a comfort place for Kolkata.

The hospitality at this place is amazing. The staff is very courteous and friendly. We had ordered kung pao chicken which was delicious. Along with that we had orderded fried rice and pan fried noodles. All the preparations were rich in flavours and extremely tasty. Complete value for money as the quality and quantity both are mind blowing. Definitely a must visit for everyone. :)

Horrible experience! This is more about zomato than bbq..  I have been a very old user of zomato but it seems they are hell bent on ruining their name. I placed an online order with them and they served me  chicken fried rice instead of veg. And then they have the nerve to tell me that it's mentioned on the menu that it's a veg item. For God's sake, what are the green dots for? Moreover their support team was being very cheeky. I fail to understand how can they have such poor service. Just not expected from zomato.

One will not find a single day where you can walk-in and get a table straight away. Considering the popularity and variety of dishes in menu this restaurant is always at limelight. One may need to wait to get a table however need not to wait for long due to speedy service and large number of tables available.
In starters we had Chili Garlic Pepper Chicken, crispy spicy chunky boneless chicken pieces simply ignite your taste buds. A perfect companion with chilled beer.
In main course, we ordered Bar B Q Special Fried Rice and Mixed Chowmein. At side dishes we had presence of Devils Chicken and Szechuan Chili Pork. Fried Rice was fantabulous with huge presence of meat pieces like chicken, prawn, pork, etc. Mixed Chowmein is hakka style preparation but would recommend Bar B Q Special Chowmein in steamy gravy sauce. Do note if you are thinking about parcel then go for hakka chowmein as gravy wont taste good once reheated. Devils Chicken was good but Szechuan Chili Pork is better. The experience was not complete without Tutti Frutti in dessert.
Table service was slow to our expectation, servers mixed the parcel with other table. There was a discrepancy in the billing too. Please do double check in similar situations.

If zomato would have provided a lower rating than 5. I would have given this place that rating.
My friends reached this place before me and they were seated downstairs when I went to join them they said girls are not allowed downstairs so we agreed to go up but they said we have to settle the bill for starters there only we agreed to that too.
After going up when we asked for a repeat of drinks the waiter rudely asked for some i.d we said why do you need an I.d for the second order he refused to answer us as rudely as possible ao we called for the Manager.
Manager arrived and said we can ask for I.d from anyone suspicious we said that it's okay bit he should have asked it before serving the first drink we are also hoteliers and we are aware of rules he said its shame we are being hoteliers not aware of rules and he started proving his invalid points through extreme rudeness. He even said he doesn't care he is spoiling our evening and challenged us that he does not care.
We told him we will finish our drinks and we will leave him started insulting us . We were all of legal age of drinking and he kept on arguing with us. It was terrible he spoiled our whole evening it was an important day for us. Worst part is they started mocking us . None of them had name tags so I don't know the names.
But i am insulted and I need a bloody explanation.
I would never come back or recommend this place to anyone ever.
How can such reputed place in Kolkata appoint such a maniac manager. I am feeling pity for that place . I would suggest a counselling session for there staff.

If you are looking for authentic Chinese food go for the Chinese section else go to the North Indian section. The ambiance is really good, dim light, the way their tables are set everything makes the place look very classy. The service is really good and fast. Once one of the dish in our order was little burnt, we complained about it and they got it replaced instantly without asking any further questions.
The golden fried king prawn is just too tasty. The crispy chilly baby corn is also recommended for starters. All in all the food is really tasty here and is pocket friendly too, specially taking into consideration the other restaurants in that specific area. We always plan to explore other restaurants in Park Street however every single time we end up in this place. Perfect for a family lunch or dinner. The serve alcohol too which is an add on. If you are in Kolkata make sure you visit this place.

I was very disappointed with the kind of service the stewards offered. They should learn some politeness before serving the customers. First of all we had to ask for the sauce dish over and over again. Secondly they didn't even bother to ask about the reviews. An age old name in restaurant business does not mean that you can through away your etiquette and be rude. Really disappointed with the service. NOT ACCEPTED.

Disclaimer: The place is very dimly lit, so my pictures don't do justice to the food or the ambience.

Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Ambience: 4/5

Located just 3 minutes away from Park Street Metro, one of the best things about BarBQ is that it is humongous and although it is filled with people, they always manage to find space for more.

Apart from the size, the efficiency of the staff here is another big asset of BarBQ. The speed at which they push out their dishes(popular or otherwise) is unmatched. The service is prompt and quick without being overbearing.

As far as the ambience is concerned, the place is very dimly lit but the interiors are magnificent.

Finally coming to the food, every single item on their menu is damn tasty and you can blindly order anything. They have perfected each dish over the years and it is amazing how they have managed to consistently keep pushing out dishes of the same quality over such a long time. Kudos!

A pleasant place for dining out for Chinese cuisine. Located on the legendary Park Street, they have a separate dining place for Chinese and for North Indian and Continental cuisines. Like all other outlets of Park Street, they are a bit snobbish when it comes to letting all gents dine, however the food warrants above everything.

I wanted to give “0” but sadly there is no option. I didn’t get a chance to taste the food but got the taste of the rudeness of the floor managers.  We were a big group and wanted have a dinner in BarBQ. Not only the floor managers were rude but they wasted our time by asking us to check in each of the sections for availability. We could easily see vacant seats but for some reason they were holding on to those by saying these are reserved. It’s surprising because when we called up they said we don’t take reservations on weekends and it will be on a “first come first serve basis”.  

I would personally weigh food and service equally for a restaurant. Kolkata has many good eateries and I would rather choose any one but BarBQ in future.

Love you BarBQ... So so so many memories from childhood with parents to adulthood with fiance and friends, and not even one is tampered... Food to service to ambience, they have it all!
Went with my mother once again today and this time I will remember to write a review for sure!

Food : 4.5/5 - 
Starters : Today we ordered Chicken Wonton Soup (so authentic and soothing); Drums of Heaven (heavenlyyyyy)... other that theese two, "Pan Fried Chili Fish" in their starters needs a Big special mention, had it previously numerous times and it'll make you happy to the core...
Mains : We had Pan Fried Chicken Noodles and Schezwan Chili Pork in Mains... they were beautifully done. And trust me, other than these, we have tried their almost all of their Chicken and Fish main courses numerous times and all of them are 5 star <3 (Personally I prefer their Rice over noodles...) 

Dessert :: 0.5 deduction just because I felt the "Caramel Custard" was a bit too sweet but that's probably because I am not a dessert person, still I feel some fresh fruits would be a welcome addition to cut that sweetness; my mother liked it though). I suggest, for dessert (as we ALWAYS do) take a Tutty-Fruity and you are in heaven!

Ambience - 5/5
Service 5/5 (The sweet welcome and attentive service, always!)
Price 5/5
Quantity : 5/5

Thank you BarBQ, for existing <3

The food is as beautiful as the restaurant itself is...
Starting from food, behaviour, ambience.....everything was very good.
I gave 1 star less just because the a/c in there was very chilling....it is very uncomfortable if it gets that cold inside. The foods were getting cold too.
Apart from that, everything was good.

One of my all time favorite place in Park Street. The location is good. Just 2 min walk from Park Street Metro. The food they serve is delicious and of huge quantity. One Rice or Noodles can serve three people if you are not extremely hungry. So its economic too. And its same for the side dishes, they come in good quality and quantity.
I love the Chinese dishes they make. Those are really good. Specially the pork dishes. This place has got everything you can ask for, on a friends hangout or dining with family. They have got huge interior three big halls I guess and its ambiance is good.
The restaurant has a huge capacity but still goes houseful in weekends, so if you are visiting on a weekend, be ready to spend some time standing in que.
But BarBQ is a fantastic place in budget. I keep visiting this place once in a month or two mostly for friends hangout.

The place where we frequented just made sure we DON'T GO BACK AGAIN. The behaviour of the staff was one of extremely mistrust. They crossed the line when they refused to accept that my friend was already 21 and was allowed to order a hard drink, and literally cross checked her Voter ID for signs of possible forgery. They also barred two of our group to get a hard drink as they "believed" they weren't of age. Furthermore, we were wrongly accused of sneaking the two a drink, despite them setting the restrictions. All of us were responsible adults who didn't need the excess stress on a simple thing as getting a drink of our choice. The one place which we preferred for it's ambience, cordial behaviour and quality has let us down miserably. We used to recommend this place even few days ago, now we will have to THINK TWICE ABOUT IT.

Being one of the best restaurants in park Street area it lacked that essence which a popular restaurant should have. I ordered Chinese and the food was not Upto the mark. It was very much below standard and could have been much much better. The restaurant staff using abusive language in front of the customers and that too the middle of the premises. Seemed I was dining at a cheap bar.

Went there on the afternoon of the independence day . Happiest we became when we didn't have to wait as it seems almost customary to wait to get placed in any of the reputed restaurants of park street. The restaurant is too spacious with a decent ambiance perfect for family eatouts .
Coming to food, we ordered
KONJEE CRISPY CHICKEN- it was too good. A little sweet and spicy, its taste going to charm your taste buds for sure. Must try.
BARBQ SPECIAL FRIED RICE- it had sufficient proportions of chicken, prawn, pork. It was fine too
CHILLI PORK- I had high expectations from this preparation but unfortunately it turned me down. The pork was quite chewy and the taste was okayish.
The staffs were friendly and guide you through the menu.
It was a moderate experience from my side.

Don't waste your hard earned money and time. Today I went to this 3rd class restaurant and the overall experience was so disappointing. The food is the worst u can find in kolkata. I ordered 4 starters and all of them were bad and the main courses were worst of the lot. From biriyani to indian chicken dishes every thing was bad. I wonder how some people have rated this restaurant so highly.

I have been to this place multiple times and as mostly if them with office colleagues hence didn't thought that way to put a review...
But never mind now is the time...
Visited again last saturday with family and as usual the food lived up to our expectations...
We from beginning thought of having starters only and all of them were served really fast,hot and mouth lickering...
Had Pan Fried Chilli Fish which was the best of the lot...Followed by Drums of Heaven,  Mutton Sheekh kebab , Dry Chilli Fish and Fried Chicken Wontons...
And all the starters went superbly well with Sula Wine and Carlsberg...
The Walnut Brownie with Vanilla Ice creme and the Tuti Fruti was the perfect ender...
Only disappointment was that they don't serve Chelo for dinner...
The ambience looked different and may be they have done some renovations and interiors...

Who doesn't love BarBQ??
I have been to this place several times over the last few months and I've always been fed well and treated well .. 
Good food , quick service and polite waiters . 
The portion is big compared to other restaurants of the same league.. I love their Chinese particularly !! 
Red pepper chicken and Devils chicken are a gastronomical delight .. 
The drinks are also fairly priced not over the top expensive .. 
You will easily manage to get a table if it's before 8pm but Just remember to book a table in advance if you are planning to go there after 8pm because the waiting could be long ( Mondays through Sunday).
For 1500INR, you can have a very satisfying and delicious meal ( for two , incl alcohol)

This was meant to be a visit to BarBQ to relive memories and assert upon myself that this is one of the best and exclusive restaurants of Kolkata. That too, with one of my best friends from my work life. What do I get after almost 5 years since my last visit? An ordinary restaurant with lacklustre food, tacky service and dim lighting that blew all my enthusiasm away. It's now another restaurant caught in a time warp, refusing to reinvent itself. No complaints about the prices, they commensurate the quality of the food. The Chicken Kaalimirch Kabab and the Galawti Kabab for the starters were acceptable, but the Mutton Roghanjosh and Yellow Dal Tadka were streetside Dhaba type. There are plenty of other restaurants that serve better food than BarBQ. Cost for a couple - approx Rs. 2,500.

Definitely the most affordable restaurant at park street among the high-end and semi-high-end places available in this coveted area.
The ambience is wonderful and so is the food but I will be very honest that I am being a little partial and giving Bar BQ a little extra in this review because it is a place which is extremely close to my heart for a few personal reasons but if you even visit this place as a neutral then you will never be disappointed.

"I feel like having Chinese tonight. Where do we go?" And the answer is as simple as the question. It's BarBQ. It's like a family tradition. Chinese is equivalent to BarBQ now! And the reason is cause IT IS AMAZING. 
1. It's a very reasonably priced restaurant. 
2. The ambiance is very nice. 
3. The staff behaviour is good. 
4. And finally, the food. Their food is the perfect Chinese for the Indian palette. Their mixed Fried Rice is so perfect every other fried rice will feel like uncooked lame dishes next to it. Their other dishes are very good too. But I really cannot emphasise on how good the Fried Rice is. 
5. Quantity is SUMPTUOUS. We were three people and we just could not complete a plate of fried rice, a plate of Cantonese noodles, a plate of Kung Pao Chicken and a plate of Drums of heaven. 

It's a great budget friendly restaurant, especially of you consider the location. I'd say that if you're in Kolkata and you like Chinese you simple MUST go to BarBQ Park Street!

Happens to be the only place in my knowledge, where you get 2 pieces of chicken when you order for a full plate tandoori. A couple of items on the menu tastes absolute junk. The name of the dish and the ingredients mentioned on the card falsely elevate your appetite and expectation for a great gorging experience, only to be let down by an absolutely dull tasting food. The service too is slow. Also, my veg fried rice came topped with a fried rubber band. 

If there is anything worth a rating in this restaurant, it has to be its spread. Take a whole classroom of people without any prior booking, and you will still be very cozily accommodated. If BarBQ had managed to flare their business so far, which I believe they do have, it solely has to be because of its prominent location - right at the heart of Park Street and nothing else. 

Not visiting again.

I love the interior. The space is huuuuge. I went there in peak times with 15 of my classmates and they had room. they are never full because of the gigantic three dining halls and one private room for 18 folks . The service is not upto the mark though. You 'll find a lag in their response. 

Coming to the food...

We ordered rice noodles with a red gravy sauce and garlic chicken. We also ordered a lamb in red sauce and pan fried noodles. Both were good. However I enjoyed eating the rice noodles more then the pan fried. The lamb and chicken were both tastey and slightly sweet. We also ordered sundae ice creams which were really good. It has a grand ambience. Definitely a place you should visit. The overall experience is great. Apart from the tardy service the rest is pleasant and pleasing. 

Rate: 7.5/10

Recently my friend was leaving for USA, so we decided to throw a small gathering in his honor at BarBQ, Park Street. 

We ordered Barbeque chicken for starter. The sauce they use is slightly sweetish, and the flavour you get is really nice. Then for the main course we ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Hunan Chicken and Hong Kong Chicken. The quantity of fried rice will surprise you. It's really a lot. As well as the quality, which is really good. I personally liked the Hunan Chicken better than the Hong Kong Chicken. Hunan was, again really good. 

Overall, Quality: 4.5/5
Quantity: 5/5
Value for money: 5/5
Ambience: 4/5
Time taken to serve: Moderately quick (10-15 mins)

Definitely recommend and I am surely going back there, soon.

BarBQ is one of my most favourite Chinese restaurants from a long time, been here a couple of times...every time the staff behavior and hospitality was warm and friendly. 😊

To begin with, it's quite easy to locate, and also just a little mention, their watchmen is also very welcoming...and just to overview their decor and ambience shortly I would say it's elegant with those round tables, comfy sofas and pretty dim lights.

With such a wide array of Chinese side-dishes first time it was lil hard for me to decide something on my own, so by their staffs suggestion I went for Drums of Heaven in starters, Mandarin Fish and Button mushrooms in chilli soya sauce with Bar B Q special chowmein in main course.
Drums of heaven is that kinda dish that any how you make it ultimately its gonna taste good..but with touch of BarBQ chef it became heavenly though! Absolutely savoury. Button mushrooms were quite succulent and juicy yet totally cooked and it was spicy and tangy with chili soya sauce. Whereas Mandarin fish was of kinda less spicy preparation, I guess they used Basa in that, naturally fish pieces were quite tender. Special chowmein was a mixed chowmein which had generous amount of prawns, chicken, pork... I just loved their entire preparation...
Although not to skip the dessert... I opted for hot chocolate fudge...it came along in a long glass..chocolate cake dripped in hot chocolate syrups tangled in chocolate ice-cream with a little caramelization over the top...plenty of dry fruits were there in it. It tasted far better than it looked, every nibble of that bonbon tasted so luscious that it's hard to forget.

Well, on other occasions I have tried their kung-pao chicken which is my favorite preparation... I loved it purely.

BarBQ doesn't compromise over portions which really made me happy and thus I'll have the urge of coming back for more n more!

Great staffs, great delicacies, great dining experience...well what more a foodie can ask for!

Being a luxury dining place it's a tad bit costly which I again feel is quite reasonable.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 🎩

Its an awesome place for Chinese Food though some may not like it as it not authentic one. Chinese Salad crispy baby corn and fried Wantons are some of the very good starters not to be missed. For soups you can go for TaluMein and Wanton Soup apart from the regular Sweet Corn. For Main dishes try their Chilli Garlic noodles and Ginger burnt Fried Rice. Dont miss out the Veggies with Cashewnut and Almonds.  Over all an excellant Food place. Only negative is you dont get table without waiting :)

The food is very tasty and you will feel to order more jus because the taste is amazing. This doesn't mean the quantity is any less. 

And the best part is that no matter you are in park street, you will not be spending any extraordinarily here to enjoy your food and drink. The drinks are priced competitively. 

I have tried both Indian and Chinese cuisine here and tried at least 4 to 5 different dishes during my visit with friends and family and have always found it to the mark (the quality, standard, quantity and taste of food)

Very nice ambience. Service is prompt. Ordered for red pepper prawn and crispy chili chicken as starters. Portions are good and so is the taste. The sauces on the table are really good.
For main course we took chili garlic chicken noodles and barbq special fried rice. With chicken in garlic sauce. The noodles and rice were really good. But the chicken in garlic sauce had a bit of more soya sauce in it.. the fresh lime soda was decent.
The quantity is really good.
And the bill came to 1554 all inclusive. So pretty decent.

I went to have North Indian cuisine here with my husband, although it has a great Chinese menu too. We ordered Galouti Kebabs for starters and they actually melted in mouth, the preparation was delicious. Though apprehensive about ordering Biriyani here, we ordered it anyway as we had a severe biriyani craving that day. To our surprise the Biriyani was great. So was the courteous service and other items we ordered for main course. Real value for money! Little cramped and crowded, on weekends especially, reserve in advance or be there early to get a table.

Situated at the heart of Park Street, BarBQ had always been a favorite place since childhood. But the last visit disappointed me to some extent. The food wasn't up to our expectations. Service was also slow. There were no tissues, and only after asking thrice we could get them. We had ordered prawn Hakka noodles, pork fried rice, drums of heaven and chicken and prawn spring onion. The noodles was fine, but the side dishes weren't that good.
The ambience made up for it though. Overall it was not too bad.

The place was really full so we had to wait for half an hour. Ths crispy chilly chicken was good. But the kung pao fish was too good and so was the caramel custard. But some of the staff were very impolite. Though I am 22 they asked for my ID, and they did not accept my college ID and I did not have any government ID card with me...and hence no drinks for me!! So my suggestion to all 21+ people who look young compared to theid age...do carry your govt approved id cards as else they wont allow you any drinks!

This restaurant is covering almost one third part of the food-boulevard; Park street ! This eatery is really a big space. A multi-cuisine restaurant mainly eminent for their Chinese and North Indian cuisines served at reasonable price, without making any compromise with the quality of food and overall ambiance of the restaurant. They don't take any prior table reservation on weekends and at any time of the day, you'll have to stand in a queue to get a table there. However, the delicious food worth the every minute of waiting.

The oldest place in park street and never will you experience empty place in there. Went for dinner with my brothers .. had to wait since its always full packed. For starter we ordered chicken malai kebab and fish peshwari kebab ..to my experience fish over powered chicken it was yum and moist and easily melted in your mouth... anyone who likes fish do order you will love it.. main course consisted of rogan josh,chicken reshmi butter masala and tandoori roti..i would say it was average with usual taste and lastly we ordered for dessert chocolate souffle and hot brownie with vanilla ice cream..so overall experience was good.. would surely visit for fish😀😀

Good food, good people, good ambience. A little costly, but it's worth it. Oh, we had ordered drums of heaven for starters and that was a little cold.

They have two sections! Indian as well as Chinese. Both are good and equally get footfall. After Peter cat, mocambo this is the one who gets most guest. Food is awesome and reasonable too.. ambiance could have been improved but I like their round table.

A very good place for Chinese cuisine. The place is really crowded on holidays and weekend evening so book your tables if u don't wanna wait. Went their on my friend's birthday party, food was delicious. So was service. Price is pocket friendly considering the location. Special mention - chilli prawns.

Lovely place. Family dinners here would be great. The Chinese menu in this place is the speciality over here.
The ambience and service could be improved though, and some staff members may insult or misbehave with you as well.

BarBQ, one of the biggies of park street needs no introduction . Serving Chinese and mughlai dishes to the park street visitors for years now.   Still, after the entry of so many restaurants and a wide variety of cuisines none of the restaurants of park street has lost its shine . Even , in a Monday evening BarBQ is jam-packed with visitors eager to have a whole hearted meal . If you ask why , the answer lies in the age old tradition of every restaurant that should maintain. Serve good food and maintain a proper ambience . No matter how old you are or how many competitors you face you never compromise with the quality . And then again if you are located in a place like park street , you task gets easier . So today when we decided to hop in for a dinner , we had one thing in our mind, and that is to be overwhelmed by simplicity yet with grace . And as usual BarBQ did just that . 

° Location :- situated right at the heart of park street . Everyone already knows, but still if you are not one them , get down at the park street metro station. Cross the lane, Walk straight past park hotel , trincas, moulin rouge and in about 2 mins you'll reach this restaurant on your left among the array of other biggies of park street .

° Ambience & Service :- BarBQ boasts one the best ambience in the city . It has a huge floor space and a capacity and the seating will make you feel like a 5 star ambience . I mean this is why you come to park street . The dim lights, the pleasant seating , it will make you feel at home . The service is absolutely top class.  These people are seasoned and some of them have been here for years . You will feel at ease ordering something as they will guide you to the best of their will .

° Food :-  As I was mentioning in the beginning . The right way to vent off competitors is to be consistent and classy . And when it comes to food, especially Chinese BarBQ takes things a little more seriously in terms of both quantity and quality.  We had the following very recently :- 

---------------------------------------------------------------
STARTERS
---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Chicken sweet corn soup ( 4 / 5 ) :- The best of the lot . The mixture of chicken pieces and sweet corn blends so perfectly that your appetite will immediately have a boost. Served fiery hot , this will get you going.

2. Fried prawns ( 4 / 5 ) :- 8 pieces of prawn balls . They are crispy fried and is buttery inside with the crunchy , juicy prawn in the middle.  If you are looking for an ideal prawn starter , this will be perfect for you . Was really happy with the size of the prawn .

3. Pan fried chilli fish ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- Stunning dish.  There are a lot of restaurants serving this particular dish across the city, but you have to be really good to beat this dish here . Once again 8 pieces of fresh pan fried basa . They will literally melt in your mouth . It's absolutely the right kind of spicy because of a hell of chilli flakes . This dish would brighten your evening. 

----------------------------------------------------------------MAIN COURSE
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Mixed Fried Rice ( 5 / 5 ) :- A 5 star rating is the least I could give . I mean this is the best fried rice I have ever had . Firstly the quantity is huge , enough for 3 people easily.  Secondly , it had a huge quantity of chicken , egg and prawns . I have never had such huge prawns in a fried rice before . They also add pork but unfortunately my friend didn't want them. Trust me, donot miss the fried rice as you will not require any side dish, it is that damn tasty .

2. Devils chicken ( 3 / 5 ) :- Although , thus dish was mentioned in zomato to be a big hit , this was the only dish that did not impress us. Mainly because it was plain and bland . The orange gravy lacked punch . Being a Chinese dish it was not spicy enough . If you are looking for a very very light item, this maybe the dish for you otherwise don't order . Go for the lamb items rather . 

----------------------------------------------------------------
DESERT
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Darshan with ice cream ( 4.5 / 5 ) :- Yummy , can't write in words as to how delicious they were . Please do not forget to order this dish.  The quantity is once again huge and enough for 4 people . This is the best desert you can have here . Served hot , these tiny pieces of delight will put a smile on your face .

----------------------------------------------------------------

Following are the points to take away :- 

1. Family dining at its best.
2. Excellent Chinese .
3. World class but simple and classy .
4. Mixed fried rice is out of the world .
5. Professional service .


If you sum up the above points , it is evident that this is the kind of restaurant where you take your family for a classy evening with a nice ambience and quality food.  There are no exceptions to these and I am sure BarBQ will continue to do that for some time now .

Heard a lot about this restaurant..well a lot..went there in a monday evening..with three of my juniors..as we went upward..the man standing there was looking at us like we were from some other planet..i asked whether we have to wait or not..he just told that every table is filled...the way he was telling those words was in a very adamant and arrogant..never expected such words from someone in a restaurant..
Somehow we went down there..we saw everyone having alcohol there..anyways we orderd one chicken coriander soup..one crispy chilli baby corn..one special fried rice,special noodles,kung pao chicken,shezwan chilli pork and devils chicken..devil chicken and mixed chowmin was good..rest of the food were below average..we all felt the same..the staffs were not courteous at all..expected better hospitality from such a famous and well known restaurant..

Ambience and their attitude was good.

The food was good also, we had
- Chicken drumsticks
- Fish with oysters sauce
- Kung pao chicken
- Darshan

All of them was testy, but I have to make a special mention for Chicken Drumsticks and Darshan. Chicken Drumsticks were crispy outside and juicy incide. Darshan was totally a different kind of dessert, just loved it.

This place. Oh, my! 

We were three of us on a Friday night, couldn't find any table in the main area, we were asked if we'd be comfortable to head down to the basement for the only gents section, we gladly accepted the offer. The place was decent, a little loud because of the all men party, however it was very much acceptable. 

The staff down there, might not be as good as the ones operating in the main area though were courteous enough. We ordered a bloody Mary& 4 calender elephants, along with red pepper mushroom & cripsy chili baby Corn. The mushrooms were okay ish, size was@ deplorable but the chilli preparation made up for it, the baby Corn had a crispy coating but couldn't find too much flavour. In the main courses we ordered, a veg pan fried noodles, a mixed fried rice & three treasure vegetable. The pan fried noodles were nice, lots of veggies and the portion was generous. The fried rice, fantastic. The three treasure vegetable had broccoli, mushrooms and born along with Bell peppers and cabbages in a tangy & barbecue sauce, decent to the taste buds. Overall a very satisfying experience as one expects from the old and probably one the best eateries in park Street!

The food was not upto the mark. The taste of Indian dish like Chicken reshmi butter masala was horrible. It tasted way different and lacked authenticity. The food of many low priced restaurants are way better. And yes of course the service... not expected from a park street renowned restaurant.  The waiters are absolutely bogus, highly unprofessional and only interested in the tips you give.
I would never recommend this restaurant  to anyone

Have been going to BarBQ from our childhood. Have so many beautiful memories there. Food has been always delicious. Went there after ages but was sad to find detoriation in the food quality. Ordered my favourite lemon coriander soup....which was so bland and tasteless. Palak paneer was also tasting raw. Somehow did not feel ...like BarBQ food😕. We ordered a 3-4 snacks but only the Chickn latmeikai and freshlime were good. Really hope it was just a bad Chefs'Day!

Contrary to the name of this grub house, this place serves some excellent Chinese food. Not very sure about their Indian spread, but if your taste buds prefer oriental tastes, this place would be a great idea.
Particularly, the wantons and the pork hakka noodles and the chilly garlic noodles (quite spicy indeed) were clear winners. The kung pao chicken was a tad bit ordinary in comparison to the rest of the dishes. However, the chicken in hot garlic sauce was excellent, retaining it's conventional taste.
The ambience too, is lovely and the staffs are extremely hospitable. And being in Park Street, this place should any day be an easy pick for some satisfactory food.

Too many people. This place is in the middle of the bustling Park Street area and boasts of the best of both Indian and Chinese menus. We ordered Tomato Soups which were pretty good. The Reshmi Mutton Kebabs I ordered were well done too. The prices a tad bit on the higher side but the taste compensates for it. There was a crowd waiting till the tables, waiting for the ones eating to finish. This was a bit of a turn off. All in all, a must visit if you are in Kolkata.

Nice food, decent price, lovely ambience. 
Sometimes the people serving the food are in hurry, I don't know why, they came and ask continuously after every ten minutes if you need something else or to give the order. It's very nagging. 
Otherwise it's a nice restaurant. 
Enjoy, cheers!

Had an awesome time with my friends at BarBQ today. It was one of my friend's birthday treat. When we declared our wish of celebrating her birthday to the manager he promptly gave us a nice and comfortable corner and even arranged for us to cut the cake which we bought from flurys. The ambience was simple and friendly. The food was great too. As we were 11 in the group we tried a variety of dishes from both Indian and Chinese menus. I would highly recommend the Mandarin fish, the melt-in-mouth consistency was hard to resist. Others we liked were the American chopseuy, fish methi chaman. The cocktails we ordered were the well known screw driver and tom Collin which were okay. The only thing we didn't like was the biriyani, but the the lack of pompousness in the décor or lack of that punch in some of the dishes or drink is completely made up by the awesome hospitality by everyone from the host to the waiters. For those who have never been to BarBQ, the quantity they serve  is huge. A bowl of noodles is enough for three people( and I have a quite big stomach for good food). The service is again worthy of an applause, it's Swift and neat. Overall an wonderful experience. Just the appropriate place to have dinner with a big group be it family or friends.

This place is GOOD. Lots of Chinese joints around the city, so chances are this one won't particularly blow your mind. But even so, you could do a lot worse than BarBQ. The portions are more than generous, the food is delicious. The menu is nothing spectacular. The decor is appealing. And did I mention the food is delicious!? The manchow soup, the fried rice with red chicken curry. The fried wontons weren't all too amazing. All in all, this place is definitely worth your time!

The staffs are extremely well mannered and they always look forward to serve u the best dishes if u dont know what u exactly want . Not too costly worth the money.

I have visited BarBQ innumerable of times but never really remembered to write a review.
My entire college life was filled with BarBQ lunches and Flurys dessert ;)

Whenever I am in Park Street, a sudden crave to eat in BarBQ sets in. Everytime I never fail to order their Manchow soup which is delicious. But this time I did not.

It was 3 of us. We ordered chicken fried rice, chicken chilli garlic noodles and devil's chicken.
CHICKEN FRIED RICE was very well prepared. Each grain had the smell of the chicken broth and the quantity was superb. 3 persons can feed on one bowl of friedrice.
CHILLI GARLIC NOODLES was a bit dry. The amount of oil was deficient, most probably. But the smoky flavour along with the chilli garlic taste. Quantity as usual was too much. 3 persons can easily be fed by one bowl of noodles.
DEVIL'S CHICKEN was ok types. I expected a lot from this dish. I deducted 0.5 from my rating only due to the flaws in the chicken and noodles. Salt was very less and the level of spicyness was also very low in the chicken dish.
Bill was 800/-

Overall it was a good lunch. And I am happy that I remembered to write a review this time.

after reading so many positive reviews i decided to visit the place, but it was a great disappointment. we went to upstairs and when we wanted to sit in a four seater table  the waiters forced us to sit in a two seater table which was not in a good condition although the four seater table was still vacant. on the very next moment they offered the same four seater table to two ladies though the two seater tables were still vacant. then we ordered 2 glass drinks but they served 1 glass, after telling them they told us that  we had told only one glass. then they served us one green salad which we didn't order. after few minute one of the waiter rushed to our table that whether we had ordered that green salad or not. as we told no he didn't even bother to beg for apology. next coming to fod we had ordered fish tikka which just cannot be considered at all a fish tikka and in the platter there was only five pieces which i've never seen before in any restaurant. in main course we ordered schezwan pork and burnt ginger capsicum fried rice where we didn't find any ginger in the rice. but to be honest the tests of the foods were good. 
the overall experience was pathetic, i've never visited such an unprofessional restaurant ever before. the waiters and the service was pathetic. shall not suggest any one to visit the place.

Went to this place a couple of days back with my friends. We sat in the Chinese section. 
Well no doubt once again BarBQ made my day as their fooding yet again showed it's class.
Fooding was simply great so was it's soup. Well the only thing which was absolutely a disaster was the pan fried noodles and exotic veg. Both of them were simply tasteless and it seemed as if the vegetables were just put in boiling water, cooked and then served to us.
Rest, the chilli garlic noodles, baby born, crispy chilli mushroom, spring rolls and manchow soup were great.
Overall, would surely have given a full 5 star rating had the latter 2 been good enough.

The ambience of the place is unbelievable, situated at park street, a very well decorated and well maintained restaurant. You go into this place and you get the vibes of a star rated restaurant! Everything is tip-top. I thought the menu needed an update, but there were many items you can try from. We ordered kabali nun (for 120 rs a piece avoid it), garlic nun(highly recommend), plain tandoori roti, Devil's Chicken(good) Schezwan Chilli Pork (good) and hot chocolate fudge (okayish). Compared to the atmisphere and the declaration and everything else the food was a bit(only a little bit)let down. But you have to keep in mind compared to other restaurants prices are much lower and their quality is also top notch. 
Will certainly visit again to try out some other stuff on the menu. With little more effort on the food I think this has the potential to become one of the best restaurants in the park street area

Well, if you are in love with chinese, you will definitely fall in love with this restaurant too... According to me, they provide best chinese at best price in town... I've been here 3-4 times to have chinese to my heart's content... the hot garlic fish is something I'll visit this place again and again... the fish is so soft that it literally melts in your mouth... the desert is also pretty good... I would've given it more than 5* if possible... I don't know in "Bar b q" what do b and q stand for, but for me, it is undoubtedly the abbreviation of "Best Quality"...

I m a big fan of Chinese food.. explored a lot of chinese restro bt it was on my wish list for a long time.. got an opportunity this Wednesday to visit this giant.. upon entering we found that its possess a big siting capacity while outside one cannot understand... waiters were very humbled & welcoming ..sited quited nicely beside a window.. everything was quite fine ..
Now coming to food we ordered chicken wings & fish finger as starter.. both items were fabulous..and the quantity was very good they serve 8 big pieces in 1 plate.. amazing..
So after eating those starters we were feeling quite full so didn't ordered main course rather we tried golden fried prawn ..and its quite outstanding..one of the best golden fired prawn I ever had..so yummy..so juicy..
Would visit there very soon..5 stars from my side..keep it up..thank u.. @monisha

Pocket friendly, cozy, good service and excellent service : this place is like a dream cone true for every foodie. Located at the prominent Park Street Area, BarBQ has a smashing reputation and it's totally justified. It never disappoints me, and if you are a first timer, DO NOT miss out on their Chinese dishes, especially the Kung Pao Chicken. Worth every penny, that!

This place never fails to delight me. One of the best places in Kolkata to have a friends/family dinner, also one of the best places in Kolkata to have Chinese. 
What I truly love about this place is it's pocket friendly menu despite the grandeur and elegant setting of the place. One of the biggest restaurants in Kolkata in terms of dining space. 
Coming to food. The quality is sumptuous and the quantity is really more than satisfying. 
I'd recommend people to try the Red pepper chicken, Drums of heaven and Kung Pao chicken with a choice of Bar B Q special fried rice/noodles. 
The staff are very welcoming and cordial. Overall it's a very comfy place.

Went there one afternoon. This was entirely a sudden plan. The first impression was that the place was very spacious. And the day being a Saturday was packed. But we managed to get a seat. The booze options are not very good. Expected to have more options but had to settle with antiquity. The food is very tasty and they provide them in ample quantity. The chelo kebabs were very good. The biryani also satisfied the lunch hunger well. Altogether a very good experience. The ambiance added to the fun.

Amidst scores of new 'Barbq' or similar names restaurants, here's to the original. My favorite for almost a decade, pocket friendly, gastronomically delightful. This place just feels like home. Synonymous to Park Street and city of Kolkata at large, this place is a must try. Now there was a time when I would only go there for their Chinese. But gradually as I started experimenting with their North Indian cuisine, I fell in love. The paneer, the butter masalas, the chana.. Everything. 

But there's just one big concern , growing day by day. Could the management do something about the seating arrangement. I mean nowadays the seats of two separate tables are so close to each other that one diner can literally smell what the other diner is having.

A true Legend in all sense!
The quality, quantity, ambiance and service has not deteriorated an inch since my childhood days.

Walk into the huge restaurant situated between McD and Olypub with vast seating area available, yet you will find it difficult to get a seat during dining hours. Its that popular! The interiors give you the rich feeling of Park Strt. No issues there. Only the dim lighting (not good for the selfieholics).

I have been here on numerous occasions since my schooldays but this review is based on my college gang farewell dinner on monday. We were 12 ppl and arrived around 7pm. A bit early so that we could get seats easily and so we did. On a personal front I favour Mughlai cuisine from typical mughlai restaurants, so I usually order Chinese here and recommend others to do so.

The order comprised of Crispy chilli pepper chicken, crispy baby corn and a veg spinach kebab for starters. The chicken was crispy peppery and tangy, a real good appetiser. Babycorn was crisp and flavourful as it should be. The kebab though lacked some spice and the ketchup wasn't just enough with it.

For main course I only had the non veg items which comprised of  Hunan chicken, Chicken in Hot garlic sauce, Chicken bharta, Schezuan fried rice and Mixed rice(sans pork). Hunan was shredded chicken in a sweet flavoured sauce went well with the spicy schezuan  rice. The Hot garlic sauce-an old favourite- be it with fish or chicken(8 pcs) is the best amongst chinese main course. The mixed rice turned out to be the favourite amongst the masses with ample prawn egg and chicken in it. The waiter was surprised when he heard we wanted Chicken bharta to go with chinese  fare. We do it that way 😛. It was decent nonetheless. There were lots of Veg dishes also ordered, mostly indian, which i didn't bother look at as i was busy finishing mine.

The servers were always on their toes for our constant requests. Food took a little time to arrive though. The quantity of food is just great when you consider the prices. Three portions of rice were enough for 7 hungry souls. The bill came to around Rs. 450per person. The price though a little on the up, is justified. The overall experience is worth many visits.

Other recommendations: Golden fried prawns, Chicken hot and sour soup, Fish in Hot garlic sauce.

This place has deteriorated over time. I remember coming here with parents and experiencing superb service and great food. However, the last time I visited for the birthday dinner of a friend, the experience was the other way round. We were seated in the Chinese section as the mixed section was over crowded already. Most of the food items were good nothing extraordinary. The waiter suggested a pork dish in gravy, did not like it. The pieces of pork were too fatty and that too was batter fried and dipped in a semi sweet gravy. Never had a pork preparation this weird in my entire life. The service was SUPER SLOW. It is disheartening to see that a renowned restaurant has come down to this level of service and food

From Park Street crossing towards Park circus leaving Park hotel behind a bit ahead beside CCD & McDonald's on your left is BarBQ. 2 floors above the ground huge area with different sections for Chinese, Indian dishes and Continental. A door after door opens to a new section. Each time you feel it finished you will find another door for another section. A small alley with 2-3 seater small tables with street view on your left and giant section with bar on the right. We sat on the first section and ordered Chinese. Chilli Garlic noodles. Tsing Hoi chicken, garlic pepper chicken. Due to some hurry we directly went for the main course. Food is good. Properly cooked, flavors are good and kept raw. The amalgamation of different Chinese herbs was something I had after a long time. With these hot preparations we had chilled sweet lime soda. Felt heavenly. Prices are quite reasonable for such a big bar cum dining on one of the poshest area in town. Must visit place for food lovers. I wish to go next time with some free time in hand so that I can explore some more delicacies of this place.

The food is always extra special at Bar-B-Q. Love their veg Chilly Flaked Noodles, The nav ratan curry and baigon bharta, the nans and the pulaos. In non veg, loved and was mesmerised by the Non Veg kebab platter. Its bespoke but it used to be even better 2-3 yrs ago. The ambience, the behaviour and the looks every thing is above average and retains a certain old world charm. My friend and I  went in after an exhaustive week of partying and setted down with Mojitos and Mutton Biriyani and Non Veg kebab platter. All in all it was ok. The taste has however gone down a little but hope that the management will look into it. The cocktails were refreshing and light. Mojitos and Jim Collins. The chefs are the ppl who keep the ship sailing.

One of my favorite restaurants in the Park Street hub! Amazing place and ambience.
If you want a place to serve you sumptuous food at the right price, come here. Regular prices offering you a quantity like no other!

You might wanna open with a light starter( Lat-me-kai chicken ~ amazing dish❤)
If you are more into fish and seafood, you can have that as well. Then you might wanna try Prawn-ka-seong. A spicy treat of king prawns.

Then you can experiment with the menu, or straightaway go to main course. Now my all time favorite is PAN FRIED GRAVY NOODLES (MIXED MEAT). I really can't describe it so simply. It is one tasty dish which quickly fills me up and I say to myself, "I know I'm full,but if I stop eating this I'm going to regret it."😁
Has the whole package of chicken, prawn, mushroom and all the veggies. Amazing flavors!
Side it up with either pan fried fish or smoked lamb. Or go for the classic Kung pao chicken. Or Hunan chicken.

You can dig the seafood too, with the Fish Mandarin. Amazing combination of juicy fish with shredded chicken and minced veggies in wine! These should complement your main course well, be it rice or noodles😊

Finish off the amazing meal with some hot brownies. Lingers long 😉

P.S: I'll not recommend the Crispy chicken in chilli and honey. Cause it was a bit too sweet for my taste. Kind of like darsan. 😶😮

The staff is amazing and cooperative. They guide you well. And you might have to wait for your table a bit, the place usually remains packed. But worth the wait😉😃

Impeccable
There are very few places I have been to, which are as magnetic as this. The food here is what one would call "evergreen". It is a haven for north Indians in the city of Joy. I have been here more than half a dozen times and have tried the non veg- Chicken Reshmi, the chicken tikka butter masala and the kadai chicken. In the veg, I have tasted the paneer and Dal Makhani (absolutely hevanly). What is common between the dishes is that you will always end up lip smacking them. It has separate seating if you have a female along. It has a pleasant ambience especially the one upstairs. Haven't tried the Chinese yet but the spread is lavish.

The chilli garlic noodles, exotic vegetables in hunan sauce , and fried rice was perfect for the main course.

But all positive I'm sure! And if you still wouldn't believe ask the people who are always standing in line ALL THE TIME.

Shoutout to the dahi kababs, the pan fried noodles, the chilli pork and most other things a blind man could point at on the menu.

One of Calcuttas older restaurants, Bar-b-q is the bigger and stronger brother of most other restaurants here! Its one of the few places that has stood the test of time and unlike other Old timey restaurants, it has simultaneously grown with the tastes of people. I have been here on multiple occasions however, I have not tried the Indian here. The Chinese food here is so good you rarely want to wade out of that comfort zone!! In my opinion  3 must haves here would be 
1. Pan Fried Noodles
2.Fish in red wine sauce
3. Baby corn
Secondly, the ambience of the place is very good! The dim lights, good music and comfortable seating makes you want to stay on a little bit longer after youre done. There is a spot here right by the window with a 6 seater table that I just adore, especially at night!! 

The only drawback I would say would be the fact that no matter what day of the week it is you are bound to find yourself waiting in a long line starting from outside the restaurant and advancing right up the stairs to its eating area. However once youve eaten there you wouldnt mind that terribly.

Amongst perfect competition for eateries on Park Street is BarBQ and the Members of the UNION went to try out this place. we also had one of the members from NY USA. As usual this place had waiting on a working day given the hype around the food !!!

It is one of the finest Chinese and North Indian restaurant on the strip called "Park Street"

Ambience is cool and noisy as its a family restaurant. 

Food: Coming from Mumbai i found the prices in this restaurant to be steal. Chicken dishes ordered were rock star. Veg Fried rice and American Chopsuey was perfectly cooked. Our guest from NY relished the Indian Chinese and kept eating spicy stuff with her red wine. She love it. We must have ordered 6 starters and all were fantastic with Chinese sauces.

The staff was courteous and friendly, they will ask for id proof though when you order alcohol so don't even try ordering if you're under 21 :P

This place is another reason why you should come back to park Street again and again. You can totally come here for those first dates. A little suave place with a lot of heritage and class which still would go easy on the pocket. I generally prefer the Indian cuisine most of the times coz I am one of those guys who love Indian. I order some of the signature dishes like fish kebabs reshmi kebabs biriyani or roti with some gravy dish.. I don't need to sell this place to you right ... so stop reading and enjoy your meal ... CHEERS 

PS Don't forget the drink (hard or soft however you like it)

For the main course I went for Veg Chelo Kabab and I can bet it was as good as the one in Peter Cat if not better..they even had a Vegetable curry with the chelo kabab which was an addition from the Peter Cat Version..For the Non-Vegs what I infered from my friends reactions that the non-Veg food was also up to the mark..all in all a nice option to hang out with friends if you have time in your hand..

Didn't get Budwiser Magnum so had to settle for a chilled bottle of Tuborg :) Ordered mutton galouti kebab which I thought tasted really really nice, can be compared to Aminabad's Tunde Kababi which I have tasted too. The sweet and sour pork was tasty too. Overall I really liked the food and service was also good. Really happy with BarBQ.Will be visiting soon!! :)

Indeed a value for money restaurant.
No other restaurant on this street serves this amount of food at this rate and quality.
But-
1) taste needs improvement. It is not about food only but value of it that people flock to you.
2) waiters need to be a bit more courteous
This is ideal for large gatherings, but not the first choice for a quiet dinner.

The quantity was surprisingly good as 2 ppl including me barely managed to finish it. 

The food was excellent as usual at this joint. It never disappoints. 
Perhaps my families favourite chinese restaurant not located in tangra, kolkata.

Well, this is such a restaurant which will be included in culinary history of kolkata. One of the best and perhaps will be forever heritage restaurant property of the city. If you visit this city and miss out on BarBQ then you are missing the joy within. 
I gave my birthday treat in this restaurant. And visited it umpteen times before. Food is excellent both chinese and indian ( chinese more). Cocktails option should be increased though. There are only few classic cocktails in beverage menu. Last time had crispy chicken as starter, chilli fish too. Fish  was melt in mouth texture and chicken was soft. The mixed fried rice was enough to suffice 3 of us in main course. We also had gravy noodles, and a chicken side dish ( forgot the name). The food made us full and the pleasant ambience and behaviour of restaurant managers made us happy. The overall day went really good with this happy ending. Heritage has really been maintained well, kudos to management and kitchen team.

Bar-B-Q- is “THE” is the first name that pops into my mind, when considering hogging at park street. There no doubt as to why, this place always has a waiting line. The food speaks for itself. Whether it be birthdays or anniversaries, or for that matter nothing at all, there is seldom a chance that Bar-B-Q is a second choice. Love this place and I keep returning for more. 
The best picks out of the menu, here, are- chilli garlic pepper chicken, chicken in garlic sauce, devil’s chicken, red pepper chicken/fish, Chilli and mandarin fish, golden fried prawns and many more. 
The whole environment of the eatery is inviting. The old Calcutta charm does make me long to go back again, sit on one of those round tables by the windows on a rainy afternoon and enjoy my meal.

My favorite chinese placce of all times 
My patent orders are-
● Crispy Chilli Babycorn
● American Chopsuey
● Hakka Noodles
● Breezer- cranberry flavour
● Darsan sweet dish
Bbq is one place every kolkatian should visit. Its neat, classy, reasonable, quality is awesome. And the quantity they give is totally worth every penny spent.
Please do do try the "Darsan" there. Its the beat chinese dessert ive had.
And "American Chopsuey" cannot be missed at all. Best side dish. I love the crispy noodles they give with the chopsuey.

Park street, the major go to place in Kolkata for fine dining, parties and booze houses this place called BarBQ. It is located before McD on the same side. Thou it looks like a small place from the outside, the seating area is huge. It can easily accommodate 200plus ppl I guess. They have a Chinese and an Indian section with more stress on the former. Iv been here a couple of times, always with a group of 5 or more. 
The ambience is gud with round wooden tables , dim lighting, sofas and a high ceiling . It's an ideal place for casual/semi formal dinners with large groups. 
There was a decent variety of items for ordering. The food was tasty. Last time we ordered drinks and cocktails. Which were decent too. 
Pros:
1. Large seating space
2. Good ambience
3. Tasty food
4. Great service and gud suggestions by the manager
Cons:
1. Bit too noisy
2. Difficult to get seats in weekends
3. The chef needs to get some items sorted out. Simple items like mixed chow were messed up.

Rightly this place features among legendary restaurants in Kolkata. Barbq won't disappoint you ever. The same kind of amazing food they are serving from donkeys years. Every time I step in to this  restaurant, I know I will get good food, quick and courteous service and at the same time it won't pinch my pocket much. Bar B Q for me in park Street is not luxury, it's more of a necessity...!!! 4 out of 5...!!

Pretty decent Chinese at reasonable pricing. The décor and atmosphere will get you right in the mood. The seating is divided into sections as per the choice of cuisine. Situated right in the centre of hubbub, the restaurant is a regular for college-goers like us. Open bar just adds to the happiness you will share here. Good service too.

The very first time to this place! Ordered only the starters from crispy chilli to the American Corn, could honestly say that this was the worst food served ever.   All of the food was cold and not at all a service that once expects from any Chinese food outlet!!
More so on the end while paying for the bill, the waiter had the audacity to yet state that tips have to be paid additional to bill.. Having travelled across the globe, I must say this is the most disgusting service that have received from any waiter!! 
Will definitely never ever visit this place again!! Not at all expected from all the high reviews that had received!

Have been visiting this place from a long time. Love their ambience, love their preparations, well behaved staff. Have tried their both Chinese n North Indian cuisine n they excel in both. They have three different dining sections, one for Chinese, one for North Indian n the other one for mixed. A pocket friendly family restaurant which maintains its quality n the charm of old Kolkata legendary restaurants. Recommended.

Old kolkata charm , heritage and great food that's what one can say about this place. Three of us went there for a quick lunch from office. We ordered 2 American chopsuey and a Chilli Pork the quantity is enough to feed 4 people. The food was delicious , the waiters were polite , overall a very good experience. So if you are visiting Kolkata this is a must visit place for Chinese lovers. They also serve INDIAN dishes.

This should be added in the list of 'Must Visit' places of Kolkata. Epic. 7 days a week and at lunch and dinner it is always full. Brilliant food. Full marks to their consistently despite the amount of clients they handle each time. I would just like their staff/waiters to be a little more friendly. The pride is very visible in their body language and the way they talk to you.

All this left a bitter taste on the experience.

The worst experience of my life!! I still regret my decision to take my mom out for dinner to this place on mother's day. We reached a bit late but never imagined such awful service. Firstly, the waiter didn't give me time to check the menu and order for food, whereas a guy sitting right opposite to my table was served another repeat of drinks even after the bar closure timings. Secondly, the rice had chunks of salt as if the cook forgot to mix it well. Thirdly, the waiter who served the starters didn't know how to divide 10 pcs of chicken among 5 ppl, so the distribution was uneven.Fourth, the chicken was horrible, something very below than the standard set by the eatery. This happens to be the place where i first treated my parents with my 1st salary when Zomato didn't even exist . I am impressed about the fact the your service has degraded to such an extent. A promise made to myself, I WILL NEVER WALK INTO YOUR RESTAURANT AGAIN IN MY LIFE !!!!!

Located in the heart of Park Street.
One of the oldest places in town for a spectacular meal.

Ambience and Decor - Rich, Classy and Aristocratic. Old Chinese themed. Would not say good for a Romantic meal as this place is always crowded. 

Food - The first place in town where i introduced myself to authentic Chinese soup in the Chimney Soup. For starters, Chinese Salad, Crispy Fried Chilli Chicken, Konjee Crispy Chicken, Chicken Spring Rolls are going to put your taste buds for a run.
The Hakka noodles are not the best in town but pretty decent and value for money. American Chopsuey is a favourite out here (Prawns are default in it. mention it if you dont want). To beat this is the Burnt Ginger Capsicum Fried Rice.
Along with it Kung Pao Chicken and Tsing Hoi Chicken are great accompaniments.
For the veggies, Chilli Potato and Pak Choi would suffice.

I am not much of a sea food guy so no reviews regarding the sea food.

Service - 90% of the time absolutely great. But during the peak hours, the service dips a tinge. Which makes me give it a 4.0 rating.

. It's a real legendary restaurant in all sense. A place where u will never be alone and have to wait fr sometime to grab a seat especially on weekends. The pricing and the food quality combined are the factors behind the rush. The Began Bahar and Chinese Salads are my personal favorite.... Always a place to be when u have not be there fr sometime 😃

I have been visiting this restaurant from my childhood days. Nowadays due to all new upcoming food joints I do not get an opportunity to visit it often but nevertheless it is a favourite moderately priced joint in parkstreet. I have tried their Chinese cuisine mostly and not the north indian one don't know why I haven't. The starters that I have tried are chicken wanton, pepper chicken, prawn golden fry etc. In soup the chicken wanton soup, sweet corn soup etc. The usual main course I ordered was chicken fried rice, noodles manchurian chicken etc. I do not like the dessert option  nevertheless I have tried the toffee walnut ice cream. I never had any complaint regarding their food. Good service, good quantity and quality of food also tasty but that cannot be said when there is a long queue. At rush hours the management is not done in a proper manner at all and that is when frustration builds up. Still it is one of the safe option as they are more or less consistent with their food and one will be satisfied after their experience.

One of the elite restaurants on the Park Street stretch a.k.a the foodies' paradise, is probably a very standard restaurant with respect to taste and the quality. See the thing is there are many food joint in Kolkata who are coming up with some beautiful dishes, these day. So, basically the point is, BarBQ is a very good and classy restaurant and it is highly recommend, but honestly there is nothing that puts it on a special pedestal.

The service is good and on being asked about their speciality they seemed well informed.

Been there to this legendary place quite a few times..a la carte options are delicious.we liked the Chinese variety better than the Indian dishes.but it's biased on individual taste buds..so you might want to try both:-) devil's chicken and Hunan chicken are a special mention. Go for them only if you are spicy at heart ;-) the name Hunan indicates spices from Hunan province...bar be que chicken  was remarkable among starters..crispy konjee lamb served as a good snackers..
Ambience is breathtaking.. U might want to take your best buddies,family or the other half to take to this legendary place.

One of the best Chinese restaurants in town.  Their mixed meat pan fried noodles is just outstanding. I can't resist myself from ordering one whenever I visit this place. Their fried rice is also very good especially the chilli garlic fried and bar b q spcl fried rice. Among the side dishes I usually order spicy devils chicken ,king prawns in hot garlic sauce or lamb in black bean sauce. The quantity of food they serve is enough for 2 persons. And one their biggest plus point is that they maintain their quality of food pretty well even during the festive times... Whether its durga puja Christmas or new year. The prices are affordable and their service is very good. PS:If you are a true lover of Chinese you can't miss BarBQ

One of the legendary places in kolkata. 

This restaurant has nostalgic memories of many people.
They serve superb food. The price is pretty competetive. 

If you have not been to barbq, you are missing something. Go and try!!! Must if you are a foodie!!!

Good food, great ambiance, the waiting for your turn is like a tradition in kolkata especially for these great restaurants, huge place, around 450 covers, with compartments of Indian and oriental cuisine, for all age group, with some very interesting things to try, even the most common fried rice by BarBQ will make u go rolling. Must try...!!

Its a very good experience. Ambiance is great. We ordered Chinese food. Rice was very good. Side dish was also good in test but we did not enjoy much as we like spicy one. We ordered the non spicy one to try something different. All together its a good place to go.

This place has never failed to make me happy. The food is good. Though we had to wait for over 30 mins for a table but once seated the service was quick and the food great as usual. Their quantity also deserves a special mention. We had ordered for two portions of pan fried noodles for 4 adults and a chicken schezwan and even after eating to our hearts' and stomachs' content we were left with food which would suffice one more adult. 
the only thing that disappointed me during last night's visit was one of the staff's behaviour towards a guest seated on the other table. I understand that it is difficult for you to handle the rush at times, but being in the hospitality business you cannot treat to any of your guests as if they are some herd of cattle. Very very disappointing.

One of the most famous eateries in Kolkata. Competing with fine dining restaurants in the Park Street area, this place holds its ground with great food. 
The first thing is that it has a huge dining area. However, due to its popularity, one needs to often wait for their turn. The place is broadly divided into two sections as per cuisine, Chinese and Indian. Food is of very good quality, and service is fairly prompt once you're seated. They also serve alcohol. 
Would recommend for family dinners or birthday treats, as it is one of the few places which has seating arrangements for large groups. A two thumbs up from me.

Lovely Chicken garlic fry starter, fried rice and few Kingfishers a perfect lunch on a warm and humid day in Kolkata. Pricing is on a higher side but the quantity is good enough for 2. Ambience is nice. Been here 3 to 4 times, only once had a bad experience and it was due to seating arrangement. Overall good place will visit again

I went to BarBQ with lot of expectations on 22-April-2016 with family. Though the ambience was nice, however food was not so good. I can say it is average. This place is mainly for office people or college goer. I ordered rice noodles, prawns as well as chicken. Personally I will not recommend this restaurant when you expect awesome food.

One such legendary restaurants in the heart of city, Park Street! Nothing much to talk about. Quality is up to the mark. Ambience really good. Service is also quite decent. Drinks cost just a bit higher compared to other restaurants  in the rest of the town, but that's something usual in all the spots in Park Street. Overall the place is quite impressive. So if u still had not been to this place, it's time to pay a visit...

Went with some of my friends after a hectic exam. I was impressed with the arrangements and totally loved the separation thing they have in between. We were a group of 7 very hungry people. As being a hardcore chicken lover i ordered Haka Chicken and Chilli Garlic Pepper chicken for startars, which were delicious tho I just got 2 pieces to eat.
Then we ordered Hong Kong Chicken and Kung pao chicken with Paneer pulao.
And trust me all the exam stress was gone.
Coming on the price factor it is very much affordable. The staff members are polite and attentive to their tables.I would totally recommend this place to my friends.

The first restaurant I visited in Kolkata and what a start! The ambiance was excellent. If you're lucky enough to get place by the window, you can immerse yourself into some retro Hollywood type environment with slow jazz playing inside your mind. Food we ordered was just too good. The portions offered were quite generous. A total value for money, I would say. Even if we were full, we still craved for something more. The waiters and managers were very professionals and pleasing. A great place for your weekend dinner with friends or family. Only con: You have to wait in a long long queue. So, first book and then roam around the Park street and come back in time. :)

The famous restaurants "Barbq",  Oh my god, it's really pathetic experience. Nither I liked there food as well as service. 

We had,  chili garlic noodles,  chili chiken and ice cream,  when we placed the oder that time I told to that staff k don't make it spicy,  but the altimet utilisation is a big 0.  

After 30 min foods was came,  yaa, if you go for quality and quantity then it's sufficient,  but for me,  it's worst,  chili garlic noodles,  oh my goodness its too much spicy and tasteless too. When I ask the staff k why you make this too much spicy,  he shows me attitude,  whatever,  bill amount was 1370 bucks with tax.

Reaching this city just in time for dinner and staying in park street area, this place ended up becoming our first stop! This place is pretty low lit and always has customers waiting in the lobby during the dinner section (as told by the staff). We were taken to the PDR section which is deep inside the restaurant on a higher level zone.
The order consisted of Garlic Pepper Chicken, Green & Red Pepper Chicken, Mixed Hakka Noodles and Pan fried Chilly Fish.
The service is good and the staff was very helpful with the ordering process. The Pan fried chilly fish was the highlight for the meal and the other dishes were wonderful too.
If you like Chinese, then this place is a must visit!

Ps: Pics do the talking! :)

Situated right on the Park Street. The staff was courteous and well behaved to begin with. There are three sections for different cuisines and you can sit in any of them if you go in non crowded hours that is weekday mornings and afternoons. The decor is amazing. That might be the best part of the place. There is a minimal menu which is good for people like me who go pre decided about their order. We had two Hakka Noodles Mix, one Mix Fried Rice and two Chicken Sides with Ice Cream for later. The service was prompt and quick and we hardly for time to bother about the same. Price is a bit on the steep side if compared with other Chinese outlets but keeping in mind the location and pretty much everything else you would not mind. Food was good, staff behaviour was better, ambience was the best. 
Tip_Leave a tip.
PS_Don't order more than what you eat at home.

Another Calcutta famous. This particularly is a family favourite. We have been going to BarBQ for more than 10 years and this place has not changed. It still serves the amazing chinese food i crave for whenever I come to Kolkata. 

I and my dad went there for an early lunch and the place was empty, only a couple of tables were occupied. The host escorted us to our table.

Service
The waiter was quick enough to serve us water and menu cards. We did take alot of time to decide our order and it was surprising they didnt disturb us the whole time. Even after we ordered the food was served quickly with no unnecessary delay.

Food

Pan Fried noodles: 3/5
Also known as the gravy noodles, these are plain boiled noodles topped with thick chicken gravy and lots of vegetables. Honestly the quality of gravy noodles has gone down. The noodles were totally bland, the gravy had unnecessary amount of vegetable. Overall the dish was just fine.

Chicken Fried Rice: 4.5/5
I am a bit partial towards restaurants when they serve very good fried rice and BarBQ is one of them. The rice they served us were amazing, flavourful and good enough that they could be eaten alone without any gravy.

Lat me kai: 4..5/5 (recommended)
Baiscally crispy chilli chicken topped with sauteed onions and chillies. And yes this dish was amazing. The chicken was crispy and the onions just added to the dish's presentation and profile.

BarBQ is a place of good food, amazing drinks, relaxed atmosphere and overall to have a good time.
I recommended going there with lots of time take some drinks, order starters and chill.

The Chinese food here is great. One can always try the pork dishes because they never disappoint.

Every single dish in the menu is flavorful and exotic. It is slightly high priced but worth every penny. The servings are adequate and they use proper authentic ingredients. Starting from soups to desserts, it was a lovely experience.

Oh! I love their Chinese! They serve Indian too but have never tried it.. For starters, I like the konjee crispy lamb/ chicken and lat me kai... For main course, their Pan Fried Noodles is the thing to have.. it is exceptionally good with abundance of meat and veggies.. Hunan chicken and lamb in black bean sauce are my favourite options for sides. And finally, toffee walnut with ice cream would be the perfect way to end a meal.. The place is huge but on certain occasions getting a table can be really difficult.. if you are a group of boys, they might accommodate you in the bar section but girls are not allowed there ( may be for safety reasons, well, okkaaayyyy).. The ambience of the restaurant is very nice. The tables by the window give a very lively view of the hustle and bustle of Park Street.. Overall, it is a great place to dine in with family and friends!

A Saturday night , cousin and me decided to order in from Barbq . At one time i frequented this place . We ordered one portion of each dish . Quanity and quality was more than sufficient After a long time i had food from this place . I must say the chinese tasted the same . Hunger is the delivery system they use . The noodles and chinese greens i simply loved . The manchurian sauce was unbeatable . The corn fried were nice and crisp . The soup was clear and full of chunky veges . I must say compared to NCR the places in kolkatta are stilll cheap . I loved the sauces that they sent .

I would normally not have written a review but I had to warn potential customers of my experience at Bar-B-Q on 22nd April 2016. My disastrous experience is as follows:

1. We went there in the evening to the restaurant (1st floor) and took seats in the Chinese section. The place was icy cold and all of us were shivering. When we complained to the duty manager, he rudely replied that it is centrally air-conditioned and nothing can be done. When we asked to change seats, he said that the other seats are colder (!)

2. Very poor service...we were without a menu card for about 10 minutes and finally had to ask for 2 menu cards. Our drinks came without straws and we had to ask for extra straws. Nothing was provided.

3. The place was very dimly lit. It looked more like a seedy bar than one of Park Street's iconic restaurants. We had to strain to read the menu cards even from close range.

4. The starters and the main courses were decent, with the biggest USP being the food quantity. Prices are decent compared to the quantity served.

5. When our meal was finished, I paid by debit card. The waiter serving our table used a swipe machine which did not work. Then he again asked for another machine which also didn't work. However this time the entire bill amount got deducted from my account even though no payment had been made. The waiter then said that the transaction was invalid, the payment server was down and the payment had to be made by cash. We had to collect the cash among ourselves and make the payment.

6. After all this, the waiter told me twice that service tax is not included in the bill. I directly told him that we had not received any service and he was not entitled to any tips. I have never seen such a renowned restaurant badgering guests for tips.

This place is a DUMP!!! If you want to go there, go there at your own risk or pack the food and take it home. I am never going back to Bar-B-Q again.

BarBQ is there on Park Street since ages, when there were only a handful of Chinese restaurants in the city. Now there are many and some of them are really really good. Restaurants like 'Mainland China', 'Marco Polo in China' and 'Chowman' are decidedly better than BarBQ in terms of decor, service and variety in the menu. Still it's impossible to beat the old horse in terms of sheer gastronomical delight!
Their menu has not changed much over the years. We almost developed a habit of ordering either the non veg Chimney soup or the Fried Chicken Wanton as starters, then going straight for the Cantonese mixed noodles, with Garlic or Kung Pao chicken, and obviously the heavenly roasted chilli pork! We also save a little apetite for their Tutti Frooti. BarBQ never ever disappointed us! Their food has this certain wholesomeness about it, which makes you happy! :)

We went here on a Saturday afternoon at about 2:30 pm after a shopping spree at new market . We were seated immediately since we were just a couple of folks . We chose to order Chinese started in form of chicken wanton (fried ) the taste of which was ok .Then we ordered chilli garlic noodles along with a chicken side dish .The generous quantity of the noodles and the chicken was good enough to satiate our hunger .we ordered some soft drinks also which arrived very fast . We were in and out in 40 mins .The waiters were courteous and also helped us guide our radio cab to the location so that we could go home easily .Value for money /Quick service/good variety of food/courteous staff - keep it up BarBQ

Life is so full of memories. While some last for about some days some linger long,even to the extent of life. This place holds such a long lasting but fresh memory in my heart. I am writing this thing exactly after 1.5 month from the day i visited this classic resto with my friends

BarBQ needs no introduction as such. It is one of the superlative places in the heart of the city offering both chinese and mughlai cuisines.

Location -- the location of barBQ is super easy to find. Take the road of olypub. Same foot. A lil later though. A mere 10 mins walk from park st metro if u move like the blue whale.

Ambiance -- this place is one of the few restos in the city which is both spacious as well as congested. Spacious because it has two big size portions , one for chinese and the other mughlai. Congested cz its ever full and busy. The ground floor has a stair case with a man witth a smiling face cordially welcoming u which leads u to the first floor where u can dine in. We tried chinese so we were made to seat at one corner of the chinese portion.

Staffs -- the staffs very warmly welcome u. And they treat u well. This is what u expect from such a big resto and u get exactly that. No over the top behaviour or rudeness. Polite and dignified .. well mannered will be the apt word.

Food -- we had basically 4 dishes. One soup, one chicken starters, one noodles and one pork side.

Now the prob arises. First lemme clear the soup was very well made. Though i just had only one spoon from my friend it was friendly to my taste buds.

Now the starters part. I think it was the best amongst all. It was crisp, spicy and yummy. The starters stood out for me. I basically loved every bit of it.

Noodles that we ordered was mixed noodles. It had pork. Now i had no idea what pork will do to me. Though it was nt my first time with it, i felt a sudden discomfort after having a few spoons of the noodles. To add to the condition, the side dish was also of pork. Whoa!! Frankly i am not blaming the resto, otherwise i wouldnt have given a 4 rating. I am allergetic to some foods. So it can be that it reacted in a bad way. I was feeling terrible so we just paid the bill and went out. As far as the two dishes are concerned, they were well cooked. The pork was soft and juicy. The noodles had a very typical taste. But I can say i have tasted better noodles than this.

Another thing which i would love to mention is the quantity. Though the pricing can seem a lil bit expensive for students and unemployed but trust me guys, one plate is enough for 2 to 3 persons if u eat a medium quantity.

Lastly, i would love to revisit and have some more flavours of this place except pork. Totally recommended !!

Very few restaurants manage to serve  super Chinese and Indian food under the same roof, BarBQ manages to do the job to perfection. You'll never feel let down at BarBQ

The best thing about BarBQ is that it is one of the better restaurants in Kolkata which are affordable as well. Located in Park Street, BarBQ has a decent ambiance and quick service. The only issue that I have faced here is in terms of early reservation of seats (one time we were absolutely denied reservation and had to go elsewhere, but again it was a Sunday). 

I have tried the Chinese food in BarBQ, namely the fried rice, tofu and chicken dishes, and I must say, I was quite impressed. It is Indian-Chinese of course, but it is well-cooked. From what I hear, the Indian food here is equally tasty. Do check this one out!

BarBQ had always been on my places to go to list. I always found it really interesting (don't remember why!). So one fine day my grandmother decided to take me to those place with one of my aunts. I must say the food was really good! We had ordered Chinese food and my aunt wanted something mughlai type. As far as I remember, whatever she had was similar to the Chelo Kebab of Peter Cat. That dish tasted quite awesome. We all loved it. The Chinese many was also quite intricate. The one dish I still remember (it's been 2 years but I still do!) is the Fish in mandarin sauce. It was brilliant. Loves the cooking of the fish and the sauce had wonderful flavours. The place is quite popular and it rightfully deserves all the popularity. There ambience is almost quite nice. A bit dim, but soothing nonetheless. 
I strongly recommend this place to all who haven't tried this place out yet. You are really missing on something!

A nice ambience and sitting place. Kung pao chicken is a must try. We ordered barbeque special mixed chowmin and Singapore chicken also. Cost is also ok, not too high. Staffs are friendly, but they take too long to serve. Overall, a good experience.

Here is an account of the heart warming events you might get to witness if you visit this place:
1) Average food, I'd rate it 3.
2) Cutlery is cheap, not really worth the exquisite rating this restaurant has on Zomato.
3) The waiters think of themselves as Gods, they serve and talk to you as if they are doing a favour to you.
4) If you are there with family, you're treated like a human. If not, you're treated like a slave. (I've had both experiences)
5) The level of dissatisfaction that you feel once you pay the bill and exit the place is just priceless.

Thank you BarBQ.

Park Street is a paradise for foodies and staying here is a bliss.! And one of the oldest continuing restaurants that ensures this place stays a paradise is BarBQ. The food, service, history and pricing all combine to make BarBQ a legend in itself. Can go to this place umpteen number of times and it will never disappoint you. The North Indian is amazing. So is the Chinese. The mocktails are good as well and when all this comes at a price of under ₹300-350 per person, nothing like it. If you stay in Kolkata, there is very little possibility that you haven't hit this place yet but in case you haven't, you need to hit it right now. There's no better place that justifies value for money more than BarBQ

Location-Just beside the mcdonalds,park street crossing
This place which is a common and most favourite hangout for most north indian cuisine lover has an average  interiors and a two storey sitting area which remains full most of the time.This place has got excellent north indian and chinese food at a very reasonable price.

Service-The service at this place is quite fast and reliable.The staff is also very cooperative as they help you to choose the right dish.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is too noisy as it remains full most of the time and the interiors are just like old time restaurant.


Food-They serve both northindian and chinese cuisine.But i prefer their north indian food over chinese and i believe thats the best they serve.We have almost tried all their dishes(vegetarian) after so many visit and the most recommendable are-

1:Kebab platter
2:Malai kofta
3:Yellow dal tadka
4:Hot chocolate fudge
5:hakka noodles
5:manchurian



Food-4.5/5
Service-4.5/5
Ambiance-3.5/5

Would recommend to visit there☺️☺️

Went for a lunch with my friend. Nice place I found with a good ambience. Order for sweet corn spicy soup, which was little disappointed me. Soup was extra thick as in consistency. More or less it was look like a sauce. Then we order for burn garlic rice and Prawn and chicken with spring onion. And also ordered for a chicken starter. I found good flavour and taste. Most importantly I found service staff was extremely good.

Old World Charm: Check
Same old Taste: Check
Precision in Service : Check
Warmth and Acceptance: Missing

Well the restaurant has been nothing short of a synonym for Park Street with many parties, festivals and other landmarks and achievements of one's life celebrated here. As mentioned above the food, the ambiance and service remains impeccable. But sadly the regard for a fan, a foodie is almost non existant. As is the history with majority of legendary restaurants, which initially served warmth and love on a plate BarBQ has become one that serves just dishes, more like a corporate restaurant. An absolutely no nonsense purely business place. 

Went there after years with a bunch of friends and was a little surprised and sad too with the vibe of the place. The signature dishes were good enough but nothing that would send the taste buds in a tizzy and warrant a come back.
Well one does have to pay a price to become famous and BarBQ is no different. Thankfully the price was humility and not the quality of food.

Have been going to Bar-BQ since the beginning of time.. My latest visit has been a major disappointment.. Starting with the order person being a 'know it all smartass'.. we ordered a Fish dish which was too salty, The Pork fry tasted like we were having an old ragged shoe... The cocktails had 99% mixer and hardly any alcohol... Ordered a beer never got the beer to reach our table... The waiters didn't bother serving the dish on our plates...All signs of an old time famous joint in decline mode,  due to apathy of the management...

I guess many people underrate it as it shares the same name with another popular dining place, but it is good. Try to ask for a table on the first floor. Nice crowd and good lighting although music was missing. But spacious sitting arrangement. Main course had options and the quantity served was also good. We ordered soups and then Chicken Dopiaza. Enjoyed dinner with beer. Must visit in park street

The food Bar B Q has no more charm in it. Along with the service the food is deteriorating every time I visit the place.
Probably today would be a last visit with the poor quality of food. Had Chinese where the rice was bland and no taste at all, the devils chicken cannot be commented more than the word pathetic. Though the chelo kabab was good enough to be eaten. Have also left a feedback at the restaurant but don know how much will it make a difference to them due to the brand name and locality where it is placed.

One of the best chinese restaurants you will come across in Park street. 
This being an obvious well known place, waiting in a queue for your turn is a pretty common thing. 
We too had to wait for about 15 minutes. The staff were friendly. But again the service was quick.
We took Drums of Heaven for starters along with coke. I've had better drumsticks at Tangra honestly.
None the less, for main course we took Hakka Chowmein, Chicken Fried Rice and Kung Pao Chicken. Each item mentioned were amazing. Simply amazing!! The quantity was enough for the 3 of us and so was the price. All these for a bill of Rs1200 including taxes. 
Definitely Recommended.

Went here on a Saturday. The place looks great but we wanted a bit more personal space and we went upstairs. Went straight for the main course. Ordered chicken gravy chowmein and devil's chicken. Food arrived in 10 minutes. The chowmein was different from places in south kolkata Chinese places like hatari and had a lot of veggies. Both the dishes were great.. Bill for two was Rs 530 and tips were extra. Quantity was more than sufficient for two people. Would love to visit again.

I've been to BarBQ  innumerable times and whenever I dine here I feel happy. This is a happening place ,always buzzing with the sound of chattering diners. But of late I've noticed a somewhat downward spiral here,both in terms of their food as well as with their service. But I still love the place and this time too when I dined there I was happy. The soups we tried out were all great....veg Wonton soup,Lemon coriander and manchow. Their Hakka noodles too conformed to their standards. We tried out something slightly different... Green Thai Curry... and it was great.  Other times I've had other items too and all generally conform to a certain standard. But service needs to buck up....

Good Food but really under staffed, long wait time to get in and long wait again to have the food on the table and also the seating area gets crowded. Thats the reason why i marked them down.

Food was good. We had tuborg , carlsberg , budweiser beer. It was served chilled. Along with this we ordered crispy fried lamb and crispy chilly chicken. Lamb was great , chicken was kind of fine ; nothing special. In main course we had mixed gravy noodles and one hakka chicken noodles. It was enough for four persons. Golden prawns and schezwan chicken was also part of main course. Prawns are not good at all. We had a pineapple juice which is above average. Overall foods were served hot and quickly.

Park Street is stocked with varieties of restaurants and BarBQ definitely falls under the popular ones. It's a few minutes walk from Park Street McDonald's.

Known for it's excellent quality food, BarBQ never fails to impress. Their food is off the chart! If you're looking for a good  Chinese restaurant, you MUST try this. Their noodles are excellently made. And so are their sides.

First timers must try their:
Hunan Chicken: Thick sauce, with little vegetable and generous dose of soya sauce. Popular choice if you want to try anything besides your mainstream Chilli Chicken.

Kung Pao Chicken: saucy pieces of chicken with chunks of cashew nuts and heavy undertone of peanut butter.

Among noodles, their haka range is pretty good. BarBQ does not limit its food to just Chinese cuisine. They feature popular range of kebab, naan and curry too!

However, the service here is very slow. Restaurant is more or less well maintained. One of the best places to go to if you want to have good Chinese food in Kolkata.

So, there are restaurants and restaurants who serve Chinese food, and there is the Pork fried rice of this place. And it is, in one word, unputdownable. The joint is always overcrowded and extremely noisy. Guests have zero privacy, everyone knows everyone, and you bump into some group of people or the other all the time who may know you, but despite all, the food quality is unquestionably fabulous. And the prices, and unbelievable! Complete value for money, for sure!

While the food and ambience is decent, the service was not at all up to the mark. We had to tell them twice about beverages, and one of the accompanying friends ordered a Carlsberg (small one), and he got a large one instead since the small one wasn't available, without the staff even bothering to ask him whether to do that or not.

We had to go outside several times to escape this freezer even though we had alcohol. We ordered sliced chilli pork dry 2 plates the quality and quantity is very bad it looked like 1 plate, i questioned but they confirmed it was 2 plates. We had Pork Hakka chowmein, mixed fried rice, chicken manchurian and sweet and sour fish which was decent enough to fulfill our hunger.
Overall the whole journey of our’s from Sector V to Parkstreet was in vein.

What's better than cold noodles and bland, chewy chilli pork ? A group of old ladies shouting out random numbers (read playing bingo) while you're trying to get the ordeal over with. Don't get me wrong, the kababs we had for starters were lip-smacking. However the food was simply not up to the mark I had been promised. If you're going to Park Street for lunch I think you can have a better deal somewhere else.

This is one of the best places for a casual dinner. I went with two other college batch mates and have to say that the experience was really nice. I ordered chicken hot and sour soup and my friends ordered Budweiser. The soup was hot and spicy, just the way I like it. Even the two chicken main course dishes were worth it. The garlic Nan was well prepared. Would love to come again.

As of yesterday, was really happy with BarBQ and was keen to visit every time.
But post yesterday, I'd just not want to go there ever .

They served chilled crispy chilly babycorn to our surprise, luckily when we made the gentleman who was serving us aware of the same he agreed on changing it but we went ahead cancelled our order as by then our main course had already arrived.

Behaviour of the staff came as a shocker to us who asked us to move and wait for another table after we were made to sit but we ofcourse retaliated and refused to move.

Not expected out of BarBQ ..!!!

Won't recommend any1.

But I was not satisfied with this place .I had ordered noodles which was half rotten.manchurian was OK. There were two of us.so we did not order much.the main thing which I want to highlight is that their waiters are very rude.they don't bother to take order.they don't serve you properly.they are ill mannered.i did not like this place.will not visit this place.

We wanted to relive some vintage Calcutta heritage and went to park st for a family dinner and ended up selecting BarBQ. I was at BarBQ after possibly a decade..... and not living in Calcutta brings its fair share of nostalgia too.

Right from the wooden stairs upto the high ceilings, everything reminded me of the Calcutta of yore.

I know that some of the park st restaurants are not at their best to all men groups but we were family so we were treated fairly well. BarBQ is one of those that seems to have an unending capacity!!! The family section on the upper floor was at about 90% capacity on a Monday!! (The lower floor meant for all men groups was shabby compared to the upper floor - at best a railway station canteen!! This kind of arrangement is common between other restaurants like mocambo too though.)

I'm sure their food has been reviewed exhaustively after 1.8k+ reviews. I may not have something entirely new but the fish in chilli oyster sauce was close to perfect.

Definitely without any doubt One of the Legendary Restaurant in Kolkata..

If one wana have Chinese then this is the place for them..... Even North Indian here is good ..

Being a vegetarian have tried most of the Veg dishes here and for any occasion if wana go out for lunch or dinner then this is our option most of the time.....

One can try   Various Soups- Sweet corn, Manchaw, Hot n Sour,...  Starters - Wonton, Crispy Chilly Baby corn, Spring Roll, American Corn,...  Main Course - Hakka chow,Gravy Chow, Fried Rice, Coin in Sauce (Manchurian), Chilly Potato.. etc.... N not to end your meal without Tutty Fruity...
 In North Indian Dal Makhani n Paneer Butter Masala are yummy....

Service is really quick and quantity wise also not comparable with any other place....

Must visit Restaurant of Kolkata.... Simply Amazing and Delicious.......

A great place for family mon to Thursday, baby corn, chilly chicken, soup all are great in taste, Fri to sun is rush time and the captains and servers are hardly bothered and sometimes rude too, not a place to be visited in all guys gang specially on weekends, food quality is very good and is iconic place...

Went there today for a friend's birthday dinner. The dining area is huge. Getting straightway to food and service. The waiters were very courteous with a smile on their faces. Here I must mention that I was overwhelmed by the chaotic environment around.....I myself love a quiet dinner. The lighting was also very dim but the decor had a very rustic charm to it. Coming to food we ordered tandoori paratha , nan, a veg item the name of which I forgot, mixed raita, Mutton korma, Veg fried rice, Devils chicken, chilli pork. Now this is where I think the restaurant lost out... On its main thing the food. Sure the quality and quantity were great but none of the dishes had that lip smacking taste. Maybe we didn't order anything from their specialities. But to me the food was bland and nothing worth remembering. The service was a 4/5. The cost for the above food and 4 small whisky was 2575 INR. Would love to visit another time to be proven wrong. For me today was nothing legendary about the legend.

There's a reason Bar B Q is listed as one of the classic restaurants in Kolkata - their food has been consistently up to the mark over all these years. The interiors, and just the way the place smells reminds one of the time when Parkstreet used to be the only and hence the most happening place in the city. The Chimney Soup and Crispy Konjee Lamb here are my favourites.

One of my all time favourite food joint..cant remember the endless number of times I have visited this place..The food quality is very good.Even the quantity they give needs to be mentioned specially..its too much.At any point of time the place is always very crowded and it will be a rare instance that you dont have to wait to get a place..I have tasted many of their dishes but red pepper chicken is one of my favourite.The indian food available here is also good.This place is good value for money.

Have been eating at BarBQ for so many years and yet their food defies all expectations every time. I dont think I can ever remember a meal there which was not absolutely perfect. Had gone with friends a few days ago and ordered the usual fried prawns, dry chili chicken, noodles with gravy and a fried rice and the food was outstanding - both in quality as well as quantity. By the way, their USP is their quantity - no other restaurant in park street or, for that matter, Kolkata, can give you this kind of value for money.
And as for their decor and service - it was, as always, fantastic.

If you are a pork lover, BarBQ in park street is the place to be. We tried to test it during Christmas, but had to back broken hearted. But this time, we tested the signature Schezwan chilli pork . Not only the quality is lip smacking, the quantity is ample.The rustic and calming ambiance only adds to the effect. Definitely the best Chinese restaurant in Park Street.

When in doubt, leave it to the Kothari's. Doesn't matter which restaurant you choose, chances are you will come out smiling. Same is the case with Bar-B-Q. 
Go any day of the year, excluding festive days, you will not be disappointed. Be it the flavours of China or the Indians counterpart, the food is exquisite and the service men well knowledged. The rustic and calming ambiance only adds to the effect. 
Only wish was, if the management would pay a little more attention to the food during the rush hours and as always bon appetite...

I can never get enough of this place. I always love coming back to place. Well, if its Chinese then its BAR-B-Q.
The Mixed Pan Fried Noodles is good but the Mixed Hakka Noodles is delicious and so is their garlic chicken. For desserts don't forget to try their Caramel Custard, its probably the best.

So on one of the weekdays went out to this place with a friend. The ambience gives you an old world feel. The seating arrangement is spacious, music not so loud and the fellow eaters civil and not boisterous.

Now for the food. We ended up ordering the sweet corn chicken soup. A generous portion considering we had customized it to one-by-two. The soup had just the right texture with no over sweetness which most restaurants dish out. The golden fried prawns had the right crunchiness and was a welcome to the taste buds specially since I have been assaulted with thick bland batter at two different places earlier.

The mix fried rice was filled with shrimps and chicken, we had left the request to not add pork. The quantity was enough to feed for hungry souls. Restaurants in Delhi should learn a thing or two about maintaining quantity without compromising on quality. The pepper chicken was succulent and had the right amount of seduction to allure my gastronomical senses 

Having said this, I must warn you that the staff is rude and a certain amount of aggression would come in handy. What's even more irritating is the way the person waiting your table psychologically behaves like a mendicant or perhaps even worse than that while presenting your cheque.
It wouldn't hurt the management to train is staff to be more polite and drop the mendicant act.
A good place to visit if you shrug off rudeness.

I've been to bar b q before and wanted my bf to taste some really nice Chinese dish but being a veggie n the paneer lover he is he went ahead and ordered for Indian - paneer butter masala n naan with raita.. Honestly.. It didn't taste that good at all.. Even he admitted .. But the Chinese dishes were delicious.. I guess I ordered for Chilli pork with mixed fried rice.. The pork was particularly awesome. They can cook the veg dishes with a bit more care..

Located on the busy Park Street, I decided to try this restaurant after having it recommended by my hosts in Kolkata. A table reservation here is a must as, even though it has an amazingly large number of tables available, this place never seemed to close the waiting list. I have never seen so much crowd at a restaurant and therefore, highly recommended to book a table before coming here. 

The ambiance is average as the place is jam packed with tables at a chairs distance, very dim lighting and waiters running all over the place. 

Food is like a fast food joint. Nothing out of the ordinary. One can try the Indian or oriental cuisines here. We tried the Oriental menu and ordered manchow soup (2.5/5) and talu mein soup (1.5/5). For starters we tried the paneer chilli (1.5/5), crispy chilli mushroom and baby corn (3/5). The paneer wasn't soft. It was slightly on the chewy rubbery side. The talu mein soup had excess lime. Crispy chilli mushroom baby corn was well prepared with good seasoning. We also tried the sheik kebab from the Indian menu which was better than the Oriental starters (3.5/5).

In the main course, we called for the burnt garlic capsicum fried rice (3/5) and mixed vegetables with cashew nuts (3/5). Both dishes had a large serving size which was enough for 5 people. Taste wise it tasted good. We called for green tea but it hadn't come for over 20 minutes and so we cancelled it in the end. 

Slow service, too much noise and ordinary food, may not have me come back to this place again. 

Food (3/5)
Ambience (1.5/5)
Cost (1.5/5)
Overall (2/5)

A place of mixed feelings and experience over the course of its inception. I have seen this place serve great food, to organise fun small scale private parties to equally some devastating public handling when its gets crowded - mainly during festive seasons. 

This restuarent provides huge number of dishes spread out over Oriental and Indian cuisines. I personally favour the Indian cuisine as its suits their preparations. Oriental dishes just tastes the same with minute differences here and there that need no special mention. 

Restuarent floor is pretty cramped - obvious reason being situated at such a prime location and selling dishes at competitive price. 

I keep it simple when i order food from here:

Chicken Reshmi Kebab, 
Chicken Sheek kebab tastes original. 
In main course you can opt for Mutton gosht, chicken dopiyaza and the bharta. These all goes well with their Naan or lachha paratha which are incredibly soft to taste. 

All in all through this place may promise to offer a lot, but once you visit this place and see what they offer you may share an opinion just I did!!!

Yesterday went to one of my favourite Indo-Chinese restaurant " Flavours of China" for lunch along with my wife who is a diehard fan, for starters we ordered for PAN fried chicken dumpling (it was cooked well with moderate spice level garnished with sesame seeds, tasted good with the red chilli paste they serve) stir fried exotic vegetables( it looked really bland)Thou we didn't enjoy the exotic vegetables, as it wasn't well done, to replace it we ordered for corn pepper salt( with good amount of green chilly) which was awesome!!

For main course we ordered for tsing hoi potato (loaded with cashew nuts, the taste is bit towards the sweeter side for those Who enjoy the taste) with egg fried rice (surprisingly the egg was made well and didn't look pale).

The portion they serve was more than sufficient for two people, infact with the amount they serve atleast four people can dine !!

Over all i would rate this place 5/5 ... The service was impeccable and the quality of food was excellent...!! This is one place where I love coming again and again, you can't get bored with the food!!

Love the Chinese and can die for their absolutely fat free lip smacking chilly pork !! Although they have a separate section for Indian cuisine (never tried out) !! Located at Park Street , a stone throw away distance from the park hotel would surprise you with its demand throughout the year that you can easily understand by flicking through the waiting area outside the restaurant almost every time you visit the place ... Well mannered staffs.. Specialised chefs.. No time lag b/w the order & delivery.. Mouth watering food... Lovely cozy ambience..Reasonable pricing in fact very reasonable considering the popularity of the brand and location its situated in.. Must try outs are chilly pork, cocktails, bbq special mixed noodles and fried rice, double fried pork, tandoori tiger prawns and walnut chocolate truffles!!

I went to BarBQ for lunch with my 6 guests in a weekday. As I thought, the position is central park street, just few steps from The Park. They have stairs, so difficult for elderly people. The interior is decent. The food is good in quality and quantity. I loved their chicken with mushroom and Schezwan chili chicken . But if you are into spicy food, I think you will be disappointed with BBQ special vegetables. The price is quite decent, but cannot say the same about service. We sat in a corner, it was very difficult to call them every time we needed something. No-one specifically attended the table and argued within each other about who will attend. I ordered a veg rice which came almost half an hour after everything was finished. Otherwise, I enjoyed the food.

BarBQ was on my list of restaurants for a long time but whenever i wanted to visit there it was always cancelled due to some reason. But yesterday after shopping at Esplanade when me and my sister were ravenously hungry we decided to visit this place.
On our arrival the manager graciously showed us to our seats. We got a seat at the highest floor. The place was well lit and clean and fully packed.
For strarters we ordered chicken drumsticks and fried chicken wings and sweet lime soda. The starters arrived within 15 mins,being ravenously hungry we started eating.The chicken drumstick was with a little gravy sauted with onions and capsicum. On giving a bite we were surprised to fine that the chicken inside was marinated too and juicy. The fried chicken wings was normal chicken fry and there were 8 pieces in a plate.
For main course we ordered chicken fried rice and devil's chicken. The food arrived and what shocked me was the huge quantity of food they provide in a single plate.We both couldnt finish it and had to take it back home.The fried rice tasted quite delicious and devil's chicken was also tasty along with the vegetables. The food was extremely light and didnt make you feel heavy.
Overall it was a quite a good experience and i am looking forward to visit this place again since we couldnt get to try desserts since we were already full.

I dropped by after college with a friend for a couple of drinks on a rainy afternoon. They have an extremely tiny cocktail menu, well just three and we went for all that there was - Screwdriver, Tom Collins, Gimlet. Upon our apparent dismay, we were offered Bacardi Pinacolada as well. Of these, the Gimlet was very well made. We weren't too hungry so we just ordered for a Bar-B-Q Special Chow Gravy which tasted really nice and the quantity was sufficiently good.
It was all just about nice until the man serving us stated "Ma'am,we don't charge taxes on service,so.." during payment of the bill. I rechecked the bill which had absolutely charged a "Service Tax" along with the VAT and other taxes. My point is, even if they don't, you don't expect such compulsive coercing for tips from a renowned restaurant like Bar-B-Q, especially when you see two college girls! Condemnable.

I've been eating at BarBQ since I was 13 years old and have never been disappointment in all these years - they have maintained their standards of taste ( 18 years and counting for me). If you want "Indianised Chinese" in Calcutta , this is the place to go!

Let me start with the worst part so that I can end up with the good part.
THE WORST PART is the service, the way customers are treated and the way tge food is served. Me along with my partner in crime had this cravings for some Chinese, so we dropped by this place. When we asked for some water, they spilled and served it on the table rather than giving it in the glass. When the food was ordered, the reluctance to serve it properly was very much visible. Every time they came to our table they spilled food on it and they didn't forget to spill it on our clothes also.
We went on a week day in the afternoon, it was quite empty but the waiters were in constant hurry doing nothing.
When a couple sitting beside us had asked for a fork or a knife, they came up with an answer that it's locked inside the cupboard and the keys are not there.
It seemed that the waiters were agitated or maybe the management is not attending to their worker's needs, hence such kind of service.

Now coming to 
THE BEST PART is the food, it's quality, the amount of food and the blissful satisfaction after having it.
We had ordered for a hakka chicken noodle, schezuan chicken and a starter, I don't remember the name because they had already pisd me off with their "what ever it is" attitude.
Anyways, we were so hungry that we planned to order two hakkas because none of us wanted to share our plate, but when it was served, it was a big bowl full of noodles, and it tasted awesome.
The food was well cooked and had flavours in it. The cravings for chinese got more intensified after having this food.
Should definitely visit this place, ONLY FOR THE FOOD. 



BarBQ I hope next visit will not be as bitter as this one regarding the service.

It is a pain for me for writing such a scathing review about this place. But I cannot help it, especially after what me and my friends faced here. First of all, to be treated with respect, you should have a female in your group as they treat stag groups worse than the Brits treated Indians. If there is no females, and even if all are teetotallers, they will send you to a shabby mezzanine floor where you have to eat with a bunch of drunk belligerents. Secondly, you have to wait for eternity to place your order. Then during billing the staffs will demand a good tip with a coercing attitude. What was once of my favourite restaurants, BarBQ will top as the places not to go. I was humiliated in front of my  non Kolkata friends, who amassed a bitter view of the non hospitality of the hospitable city of Joy. BarBQ is eternally ticked off from my bucket list. Not at all recommended.

First visit - Kept waiting for 40 minutes or more but still no seats available. Had to leave.
Second visit - No Seats available again.
(Though we could see the other people coming in and taking their seats. We were a group of 10 and they couldn't arrange places. So it was an absolute disappointment)
Thus I never wanted to visit but since my better half wanted to have Chinese there, we went there on a special day. (That added 0.5 to the rating, thank him :P)
Had Hakka Noodles, Kung Pao Chicken, Crispy Chilli Babycorn, Prawns and Fresh lime soda (sweet).
*Fresh lime soda must be served in proper glass mugs. It looked bad the way they had served.
*Crispy Chilli Babycorn was fried more than it's required and did not have the crispness, it must have !
Prawns were okayish.
*Kung Pao Chicken was good.
The dishes should be made more attractive and served properly.

The ambience was satisfactory and the staffs were not up to the mark.

Needs a proper check on the entire thing.

Bar-B-Q stands among the popular restaurants of park street, with great food & fine ambiance. I have been to this restaurant several times & it has never dissappointed me. With strict quality control it is one of my favourite restaurants.

The only thing it needs to work upon is the service. The table attendants are not attentive & one has to wait for them to pay attention towards your table. One of the section has better interiors than the other two.

The rich #DalBukhara & #VegBegumBahar taste delicious. The #ButterNaan should be your choice if you love the buttery taste.

Reliable Chinese and Indian food at affordable prices. Food at barbq needs to introduction to a Calcuttan. Its been around and popular forever now. I have not been disappointed by the food over numerous visits in the last numerous years. But during my last few visits, the service has been shabby. From delays in getting food to putting ingredients in dishes after a specific request not to. These have not happened once with me but a few times in the last few months. Agreed, the food is still lip smacking, but sad to see the service quality go down as its one of "go to" places in town.

A very popular choice for most Calcuttans! And why shouldn't it be. The food rarely fails to impress. 
The restaurant is divided in two sections- on one side u get Chinese and on the other u get India. I have tried both the sections and was quite satisfied at the end of the day. 
P.S. If u have ordered Chelo kebab....don't expect it to be as good as that of Peter Cat.

There are always people waiting for a table even though there are so many tables to be served in this restaurant. The great service results in fast turnover for the restaurant.

went here for two times,one in DURGA PUJA ,another in birthday of my friend.This is  really a high class,sophisticated dining out.This is also good for a date,the atmosphere can make you feel superb.On my first visit,I chose Chinese like bbq special noodles,the famous "DEVILS CHICKEN" and one starter.The foods are enough for two people and tastes very good-really this is "FLAVORS OF CHINA"-true said.
On my 2nd visit,We chose Indian like mutton Biryani,butter chicken and one Chinese starter...as it is famous for this,so we can't resist.The Biryani is awesome and the gravy of butter chicken is just mouthwatering.
Cost is really favorable respect to other dining out.If you want a classy date you can choose this.

Had the worst experience today. There was a huge rush on account of Valentines Day and we were asked to reserve our names so that they can provide seats in frst come first serve basis but it turned out out that they followed no particular order. We had to wait almost 3 hours (7-10pm) until we got fed up and left. The manager who looks after the north Indian section has a very casual attitude towards his customers. I'll never recommend this to my frnds or family and will never visit this place again.

The grand daddy of kolkata restaurants, bar-b-que is always a delight to visit... It's uncanny how long the waiting queue becomes on the weekends, not that a patron would mind standing patiently to be shown to his table... 

Food quality is good, though not what it used to be earlier.

Chinese staples include chilly garlic noodles, chilly potatoes, three treasure veggies etc but what I really like most is the Chinese noodle salad...

Indian food quality is not what it used to be, however the kebabs are still yumm.. Paneer butter masala is my all time favorite and is yet to fail me.

All said and done, the charm of going to bar-b-que remains evergreen.

On a personal note I feel if it's chinese then it's bar-b-q. The quantity of food provided along with the quality is just too damn high. Unless you are a glut you won't be able to finish of their food completely. It's a must try place and its location in the heart of Park Street makes it quite a popular place. The staff is very courteous and is attentive to detail.

Went today for lunch with my two senior colleagues..situated opposite flurys in park street...seating organisation is huge, interior and deco simple but soothing,ambience was buzzing...we ordered crispy chilli chicken,chello kabab, bar b q special fried rice & gravy chowmein,devil's chicken and schezwan chilli pork...i must say all the items were superbly delicious and more than enough in amount... In the end refreshment with sweet lime soda..cost is a bit on higher side but thats can be neglected looking at taste and quantity
Service was good and prompt..

Being the most hyped and crowded eatery, I expected it to be more. The first turn down of this place was the poor service. We were waiting at the table for quite a long time before a waiter came to take our order. This can be attributed to the huge crowd and the imminent mismanagement on their part.

The food was excellent and delicious, which were served in extremely generous quantities. Both Indian and Chinese dishes were equally good and their taste was unique to the cuisine. Price of the dishes were reasonable and exactly as given on the menu at zomato.

The ambience is different in different sections of the restaurant. While some sections needs improvement, others are just fine.

Overall, this is a great restaurant for foodies seeking for gastronomical pleasure but not the best location for a date as it lacks the soothing ambience.

Extremely good food at really affordable prices- thats how i can define this place. Bar-B-Q as the name suggests their kababs are just heavenly... simply melts in mouth... not only mughlai cuisine their Chinese preparations are also very good. Actually I often get confused what to order... service is also up to the mark....despite being mostly over crowded the ambiance is fantastic... very Kolkata like... only one thing i like to mention is that their cocktails are bit on the ordinary side compared to other places of same genera.

Park street is a place in Kolkata with a speciality of a huge spread out of restaurants ,bars, clubs , lounges as well as other entertainment and feasting options.
One among the top restaurants located there is definetly BAR-B-Q which is a top notch restaurant offering some lovely classy ambiance and great hospitality once you enter here .
Most of the times you will come across a constant noise in the next table frequently by some group of office goers or a group of ladies straight coming after a Kittie party if not then there are groups of friends turning up and not bothering about the people in the other table then you know you have come to the right place and you have to not take that too serious and start placing your order .
Well for me when I had visited this place I had come the first time with my fellow colleagues and as it was lunch time so we decided to go in for some starters which was Crispy chilli babycorn and Drumsticks , now the baby corn was made very nice with the right crispyness and at the same time soft enough to munch it fine and coming to the drumsticks it was pretty decent nothing that great however good.

Coming to the main course we had ordered 2 bowls of mixed fried rice , 2 bowls of mixed chowmein ,2 plates of chilli chicken and 1 place of another chicken dish which was prepared and enriched with honey which I am unable to recollect the name ,nevertheless coming to the taste of all the above listed dishes I would say the mixed rice tasted good , the chowmein tasted better , the chilli chicken was super and the last dish made with honey and chicken was the best which really made me crave more for but somehow I managed to end my cravings with some desserts once I stepped out of Bar - B -Q .
The bottom line is that this place is worth a visit no doubt on that and its rates are somewhere floating with the current scene of restos which should actually be considered for the kind of class it has .

Whether it is Christmas season or durgapuja season or simple sunday evening you must wait in a queue becos of their good serving, well reception, environment and cost effectiveness . The atmosphere or ambiance is quite pretty (More than average). They have almost 500 seating capability. Even if you can get entry inside without any queue you are lucky man... :-)

We had chilli garlic pepper chicken, dry chilli chicken, red pepper fish, hunan chicken, chicken in garlic sauce, mixed chowmein and mixed fried rice! The food quality was obviously good! I didn't like the hunan chicken though.. It was a little too sweet for me! Overall it was highly satisfying!

When it came to food we only had to settle with starters for which we ordered one Chicken and one Babycorn. Good in quantity but could have been better in quality.

The tofu that melts in the mouth, the noodles that three hungry souls can comfortably share, and the perfect view of a winter afternoon park at if you're lucky to get the window tables.

This is one of those places that I go solely for the purpose of nostalgia. It gets a nod in the areas of food taste and quickness but the staff are good - just not as good as the food. 

We however stopped visiting the place because we have found out that several other restaurants have opened up which are slightly better in terms of taste or service. However, no matter what happens, this place will always be a classic.

This is a great place to be in. Probably the best in Park Street. The food, ambience, service and price are all bang on! They serve liquor on premises which is an add-on for many who would want to have a few drinks. Their decor and the dim lights are a delight and so is their food. Price wise the restaurant isn't very pricey. The menu rates may look inflated but their meal portions justify the price. Vegetarians visiting this place must try American corn in the appetizers section and Chilly Garlic noodles with Devil's choice (gravy dish) in the main course section.

I've gone to this place for as long as I can remember. This legendary place on Park Street is a definite visit for all Calcuttans!

Ambiance (3.5/5) : Set on the first floor of an old building, wooden floors, old style interiors, even though its a little cramped, make it the classy place it is!

Service (2/5) : The waiters here hardly pay attention to you, they have no idea what makes the dish they're serving. They take their own sweet time to serve you and at times are very rude. The service isnt efficient and the waiters shamelessly ask you for a tip in the end!

Food (4/5) : The food is all that makes the place what it is. My patent order is a Dal Bukhari, Chana Masala, Aloo Dum. With these I either take a Vegetable Pulao or a Butter Naan and Masala Kulcha. The food here and in the Flavours of China counterpart is really really good. The food isnt very heavy and perfect for a group of 4. The rotis are very soft and usually well cooked. The dal is a must when youre ordering North Indian. It has a very distinct and classic flavour. The aloo is very good too, so is the chana. The pulao with the dal is a treat! I usually take some Chinese starters and soups to accompany the food. The Crispy Chilly Babycorn and Manchow Soup are really good, with flavours which are Indianised according to whim of the chef, but suit our palette nonetheless. Alcohol here is fairly priced. 

Vfm (4/5) : Right on Park Street, this place is a must visit. Food is good, so is the quanitity and price is fair enough. This place suits any ocassion!

One of the older restaurants of Park Street, Bar-b-q represents the pinnacle of Calcutta Chinese. It has maintained its high standards over the years and the prices are still very reasonable. The spring rolls, the fish dishes and mixed Hakka noodles are must trys. Only the service could improve a bit but I guess that is another characteristic of the city.

If a restaurant could portray the attitude of Kolkata as a city, Bar-B-Q would be one of the top 10 to achieve this title.

Why do I say so?

Well, the waiting time for a table goes really long (just like doing a job in Kolkata takes that much of a long time), the interiors although pretty looks cramped (just like the lanes of Kolkata), the waiters are laid back and getting their attention might be a tedious task (just like every official in Kolkata) and on the top of that they can’t even tell the characteristics of the dish when asked, the food is FANTASTIC and priced reasonably well (one of Kolkata's charm.)

And as a dessert, the waiter shamelessly asks you for a tip.

Coming to the food, ordered Pork Noodles, Chicken Noodles, Tsing Hoi Chicken and Sliced Chili Pork.

Every item had a really great flavor, especially the Chili Pork, I'm in love with that dish and that'll bring me back to Bar-B-Q again and again.

Quality food, moderate pricing and typical Kolkatan attitude, that’s what makes Bar-B-Q one of the legendary restaurants to go to.

If i was to go just with food and price I would have rated it higher but what makes me give a 4 is simply the fact that the people serving were inefficient yo say the least. Since the main section was full we were asked to go into  the section on the ground floor. After waiting for a considerable time we were provided with glasses and when asked to provide eater they just seemed to neglect it. The person who came in to rake the order first was rude,to say the least. 
Now coming to the main part,food
We started with crispy and red pepper chicken along with sweet corn soup. The crispy chicken was really good.
We ordered bar b q special rice and noodles which were good but the mixed noodles did not have pork although they said it will. The pork and the chicken sides were good and I personally like the chicken better.
Overall a very good place to eat and very reasonable price and good quantity. Just hope they pay a bit of attention on their staff.

I've always held a very high opinion of this place, and I still do. I've always been in the first floor whenever I came before, however on New Year's eve we were in the ground floor, and was fairly disappointed by the service. No doubt the food was still of same quality (which is amazing) but the ambience wasn't up to the mark, with lights dropping as if there's a voltage fluctuation and the waiter who served was quite annoying. In fact he played the main role in my disappointment, with a bit of an I-am-the-boss attitude and late responses.

The only place where you'll probably have to put in a request to try & REDUCE the quantity a bit and the staff takes extreme pride in mocking people that you couldn't even finish the portion served! 😋

Well a restro that truly matches the spirit of the city - Chilled out & laid back at all times! The staff would walk past you many a times & all your efforts to get the waiter's (who feels he is nothing short of a rockstar! 😎) attention are in vain.

Nevertheless, this place still has some amazing food served in portions that helps you empathize with a Python after he's had his meal. But don't think for a moment that with this quantity, the quality is affected in anyway! Brilliant taste & well cooked food coupled with the hustle bustle of numerous foodies of Kolkata! 🙏

Overall Recommendation : The service though is a little disheartening, but the British flavour of the place & the lovely atmosphere of a mixed crowd makes it one of the most promising restaurants in the city! Would surely love to visit again! 👏

Bon Appétit!

Both the restaurant and the bar are excellent. They have a very pleasant and soothing atmosphere. Quality of service was excellent too. I had been there on the new year eve and they had a very large crowd both inside the restaurant as well as outside waiting to be seated. Even after that they managed both the crowd with ease and the behaviour of their staffs was really charming. Above all the price is very reasonable without any loss of quality and quantity of the foods.. The drinks are not overpriced too.. I think this is going to be one of my favourite hangout place. We had one bottle of Sula Cabernet Shiraz red wine, 3 bottles of Budweiser premium and chicken chowmein....

Went here last night or should I say last year :p Waited in the queue for like 45 minutes and got to sit in the worst section of the restaurant. We had ordered golden fried prawn ,prawn hubei ,singing chicken ,ginger burnt capsicum fried rice ,hakka rice noodles and a beer. When the food finally arrived and after we took our first bites ,it was magic. The taste ,the crispness of prawn were perfect. I didn't liked the rice and noodles personally. Prawn hubei was okay and singing chicken was very soft and with all the ingredients nicely cooked. Last we ordered desserts, the quantity was enough. You should definitely give it a try if you end up in park street for dinner.

Good Food + Good Ambience + Hep Crowd = Bar-B-Q! Located in Park Street.. Serves Authentic Chinese.. Great North Indian too.. Going to this place is in my to do list.. If i am in Calcutta i have to visit BarBQ.. Just like we pay homage to temples.. And i love the Chinese cuisine.. Non pareil.. 
The Ambience is Urbanised.. Feels like i am being seated in a proper Chinese restaurant just like in the movie The forbidden Kingdom! The cutlery has that chinese touch too.. The papermats are designed according to your birth year and what that means in Chinese Zodiac signs!
I have my favourite order memorised .. So i really dont need to look at the menu ;)
Always order Crispy Chilli Babycorn.. Burnt Garlic Noodles, Vegetarian Manchurian and American Chopsuey! Everything is finger licking goood.. Oh and there should be special mention of the Surprise Sauce.. I can literally lick/drink the whole bowl.. And keep asking for more..:))
The Service is good.. The staff are very etiquetted.. Despite a full house they manage the show really well.. And one is always greeted with hellos/ Good affernoons and evenings for that matter! Kudos to the entire team for running it so successfully .
Lastly i would say its great value for money.. Myst must try this place.. Its my favourite place and it never fails to Surprise you..(Pun Intended;))
Please let me know your views on this.. Thanks!

One of the famous place which serves  both Chinese and Indian at it's best is None other than Bar-B-Q. Whether it's a family dinner or lunch, or birthday treats or anniversary treats, the one place that comes to mind is nothing but Bar-B-Q. With it's excellent ambience and prompt service along with the delicious food it serves, Bar-B-Q is definitely my favourite.

I had heard wonderful things about Bar-B-Q and was glad to have a chance to visit. As a recent lover of Chinese cuisine, I was looking forward to the meal. We came from another place and could not do full justice but whatever we had was lovely. The manchow soup was hot and comforting. The thai red curry and rice were both delicious and reintroduced me to the joys of aromatic food. I packed the leftovers for home and was surprised that it was as tasty the next day. 
Along with the standard Chinese elements like the calendar and fringe lanterns, there were unique touches (the archways for one). Given its posh interiors, the prices are reasonable. 
I am definitely going back for more.

Nice place, good food. Serves Indian and Chinese. Good part about this place is it serves healthy proportions and has a in house bar.  It would have been a rating of 4 had it been just for food but . . . 

One problem that I have faced here is that youngsters and group of men are generally not entertained in the seating area upstairs and directed towards the bar. It should be considered by the management that people don't always like sitting at the bar.

Deciding to eat out my Christmas Eve lunch and treat my cousin from Mumbai to some Kolkata famous Chinese, I decided on the ever so famous Bar-B-Q. Well I do not believe one would need directions to this place, just saying Park Street should suffice, but just in case, then head towards Mirza Ghalaib Street from J.L. Nehru road and you would find it on your left.

This is one beautiful place to dine in, the place speaks aristocracy the moment you step onto the stairs leading to the dining room on the first floor. The wooden balustrade, the homely wooden seating, the majestic windows facing the Park Street, the huge dining room and the suited stewards, all of this makes you feel good just being there. The place has a large seating capacity with a small mezzanine seating arrangement at one corner. I personally would have preferred sitting by the windows, but we were seated on the row next to the one closest to it.

Coming to the food, it was a very good lunch is all I can say. We chose, crispy fried chilli chicken and chicken lemon chilli dumpling along with sweet corn chicken soup and chicken manchow soup for the starters. The fried chicken was so good that we helped ourselves with another portion at the end of the meal. It was cooked well with the right crispiness and not too stiff. The wantons were stuffed full with the chicken having a subtle lime and chilli flavour and a soggy, slimy outer cover. The soup (manchow for me) was tasty, with the small diced vegetables and crispies adding a grainy taste to your palate.

The main course was chicken hakka chowmein with kung pao chicken. The hakka chowmein was served in large quantity and had ample shredded chicken and well flavoured. The kung pao hicken was chicken cooked in a mild soy gravy with stir fried bell peppers. It had a good taste to it. For desserts, we shared a glass of hot chocolate fudge which was brownie with chocolate ice cream and hot chocolate sauce and well the ingredients speak on their own for its taste.

The food was served hot with ample dips and accompanying sauces. It being a festive day, the ambiance was a bit chirpy and it added to the festive mood. The service had its own pros and cons, and while initially it was quick, it gradually slowed down. Hygiene and cleanliness were well maintained. Prices are moderate and reasonable.

It was as I said, a very good dining experience and the food along with the ambiance won full marks. The service could be brushed up a bit, but this being a old restaurant, it brings its own haughtiness. But still if you feel Chinese, you can drop in anytime, it can make up your day.

Happy eating!!!

Bar-B-Q brings out warm memories from the past each time I visit. I started my journey with Bar-B-Q from 1999. At that time, I was really a novice trainee in the office and had a team dinner. But after that, the the journey is still going on, and each time it keep on pleasing me. 

I like the Chinese section here. The warm welcome I have each time, is the signature of their hospitality. I forgot when is the last time I took a look at the menu card. For years, I have been taking my chair, and then starts conversation with the staff about my wish. Sometime, I wish for something mild, sometimes spicy. very spicy etc. Each time I have around 5 to 10 minutes of discussion to the person taking the order. Till date, I never seen anybody being annoyed for taking me time that long. That's why, whenever I think of dine out, the first name comes to my mind is Bar-B-Q.

They have a god gifted bar tender. Believe me, that fellow has magical hands and makes one of the best cocktails in the city. My favorite one is the Long Island Iced Tea. Along with this gentleman, I usually take double fried chilly pork and pan fried fish. Both are exotic dishes. Pork is perfectly cooked, a spicy dry crispy item with lots of strong flavor. While pan fried fish is amazingly juicy and soft inside and crispy outside, with a mild taste. 

Check out for their pork dishes. One of the best in the city. I usually go for pork, and sometime prawn and fish. Take any fish item, you can feel the freshness of the fish. I usually do not go for chicken here. Only exception during very hot summer, while I like to have chilled beer and paper fried chicken. 

Take my advice, whenever you are giving food order, always ask for is there any special items outside the menu card. There are. Always.

It's Christmas and it definitely demands a mandatory outing at Park Street. And what is the point of visiting Park Street without a great meal at one of the restaurants over there! So this time my Christmas conquest has been Bar-B-Q. Though I have visited the place many times before, this is the first time I am writing reviews for it. Well well well in my humble opinion this is one of the best places to have  Chinese food. Judging by both quantity and quality this place do surpass many other joints known for their Chinese cuisine. I had red pepper prawns, konjee crispy chicken, Mixed Cantonese noodles, Bar-B-Q special fried rice and Hunan chicken. I just loved the konjee crispy chicken! Other dishes were also really good. The service is a bit slow but one taste of the food will make you forget everything.

Well the Bar B Q, one of the most heritage restaurants Kolkata have ever had and that too in the park street area. I have heard about this place from a lot of people, family as well as friends. At last I visited this place on 26th December 2015. I feel extremely disappointed to have had its food and to be there. I can only say that the restaurant is un necessarily hyped. The food is bad, the service is bad, the managers over there are bad. They only cater most to the people who tip them with an amount equal to Rs 500-1000. They give only 1 pair of salt and pepper to a group of 9 people. The ambience didn't touch me as well, its too gloomy to be happy. We waited there for 2.5 hours just to get the delicious flavors of Bar B Q but it turned out to be a waste of money and time as well. So I would suggest that if you are thinking of investing here, then please don't because there are ample restaurants who serves better food than this place at the same price or may even at a lower price.

Ah well! The fav bar b q ...really avoid this place after finding a centipede in my chinese food. Being a pure veg i dont think i ordered them to add insects to my food. It was my all time favourite since 10 years until they decided to compromise the quality. Well, it still serves awesome food but the whole turn off happend when there wasnt any response when i complained of the food having a dead centipede. They point blank said we will change it.. Yet..it still is a food haven for people cos of its affordable pricing snd sumptuous food. It is so dimlit that i am sure people can't find any flaws in their food.

Visited this joint yesterday, we were a group of 9 people. It was a crazy rush. We waited for around 2 hrs before we got a chance to sit down and eat. Service was quick, dishes were tasty, ambience had a British-era feel to it. I would recommend this place if you are mood to try something royal and true to the legacy of Kolkatas park street. There is no reservation right now until end of the year.

Have been going to this place for many years now ie: from childhood days, though the place is still crowded, but sadly the quality and taste is nowhere near what it used to be. We had ordered for Chicken coriander soup which was just ok and passable, the noodles and chilli chicken ordered was very very ordinary. Basically, you can't go wrong with traditional and basic items like Hakka noodles and Chilli chicken. Felt quite disappointed and of course service is also very slow and laid back.

The place is nice, airy and located near The Park. We ordered Murg Kalimirch Kabab which was succulent and delicious along with Mixed Hakka Noodles and Chilli Pork. The noodles were kind of cold. The pork had some chewy pieces and a bit too much sauce. The taste was good, nothing extraordinary. I would have given quite a favourable review of this place if it had not been for the ambience.
A group of 15 ladies seemed to be playing bingo or some other game behind us. Basically one of them were shouting out random numbers continuously. It's quite ridiculous that such behaviour is put up by such a classy restaurant. There is no music and too much chatter all around. Frankly I dont think this is the place where you can enjoy a quiet lunch and conversation with someone. I would have given a 4 but due to the ambience i will stick with 3.

Located near The Park hotel.. this place serves some really delicious Chinese food. The kung pao fish and mix fried rice was simply awesome. Service is good. You can understand the quality by looking at the crowd.. it was like any other day but the two storey restaurant was crowded..infact it was almost full.. ambiance is therefore ok as the restaurant generally remains crowded.. neither we can blame people as the food is just sumptuous.. overall a great experience.

Good restaurant with decent food and vibrant environment. Young crowd fills up the place. They serve both tandoori and indo-chinese. Tried both, reasonably good quality, however with the length of the queue upfront the night before, I was expecting to be overwhlemed; which I wasn't. Of all the orders liked Chilli chicken (starter) the most. Very little options on fish items. Too many chicken based items in the menu. Will I go again? Sure. But there are too many similar restaurants in Calcutta these days, I didn't find this one stood out taller from others.

On my recent visit to Bar-B-Q I thought of trying the Indian dishes,from this legendary eatery,as I have already tried their chinese food and I am a fan of it. As every one knows this place always stays packed up but we were arranged a seat within 10mins.The ambiance is  quite calm considering its location in the heart of park street.
Now coming to the food,for starters we had...chicken malai kebab along with antiquity blue the kebabs were extremely juicy and were perfect with the drink.

Next for the main course we had mutton biriyani,Chicken Butter masala,paneer pulao and mutton rogan josh...the mutton biriyani was good(improvement can be done) but the chicken butter masala was excellent it was very very creamy...next the paneer pulao was decent enough and the mutton rogan josh was very good if not excellent.

Lastly for dessert we had our all time favourite tutti frutti ice cream which was simply awesome.

The uncultured Stuart's and captains do not know how to behave specially with women. Just because the restaurant was crowded in a Sunday afternoon they just spoke to customers the way they wanted.
My family and I were told to go to the different halls and find a place ourself.
When we we just walking through and finding a place, the captain just came and told us to move from there and stand somewhere else as that was a service area apparently with a lady present with us he did not think twice before talking in a uncultured manner .
I would prefer giving this uncultured restaurant a negative rating.

This is the place I've frequented like nth time. The barbq, a legend in the restaurant circle of Kolkata in the truest sense of the term , never ever disappointed me. Frankly, I've never felt the need for reviewing it; but then it won't be a justice if I don't say some words about this legend.
I've mostly tried their Indian cuisines and on some rare occasions I've tried their Chinese. It is one of the few reasons that I started to like the Chinese fare with passage of time.
Few days before, my gang of friends & I went for a drink and lunch affair.
We were a group of 5 ppl, surprisingly, we got ourselves seated immediately even at the peak time of 1.30 pm on a Sunday!!
The decor is reminiscent of the age old charm of park Street. The vibrance of the fellow foodies and the cling clang of the cutleries is something which always sets the mood for a lipsmacking lunch.
Anyways, we ordered our respective poisons, and chilli fired pork, chicken mandarin dumpling(I think) and panfried fish as our starters.
The drinks got served along with the standard cheese ling bowls, immediately. It was soon followed by a smoking hot plate of chilli pork and 2 plates of chicken dumplings.
The chilli pork was a classic, perfectly smoked n cooked pork meat slices, was yummy. It wasn't chewy or didn't contain extra fat. 
The dumpling was nice. It was subtly fried and stuffed with good amount of chicken. The red sauce was a bit bland but the pudina containing chutney was nice.
Then our plate of pan fried fish followed in. Thick cubes of fish panfried subtly in a tangy sauce , was nice. The fish was so soft that it melted in our mouth. Won't say it was the best panfried fish dish I've tasted, but then it was good.
We decided to order a plate of lamb starter, though not in the menu, the waiter said they could arrange a plate of crispy lamb for us. It was served with another round of our drinks .
It's a shredded dish and the 1st nibble on a single shred of it was a disaster. It had some terrible smell to it. We complained to the waiter and they immediately changed the dish with chilli pork (our choice).
Then for a different starter dish, we ordered the fish finger. Oh boy, it was pure genius. 8 pieces of fish finger in the dish, each and every finger was a bundle of joy. With each bite the fish melted in our mouth, it was so soft and juicy. The coating was minimal. The best fish finger I've tasted till date, I can remember.
For main course we ordered a plate of mixed chow, mixed fried rice and chilli garlic rice (chicken) with a plate of kung pao and Hunan chicken on the sides.
Another goof up (though rare) by the management was they made the chilli garlic rice without chicken, we returned the dish n they cancelled the order as per our request.
Anyhow, I had the rice, it had huge pieces of prawn, sufficient amount of chicken and excess amount of egg in it. The quantity was okay for me and another guy. Taste wise it was great. 
The kungpao chicken I felt was a bit bland. Hunan chicken, a shredded dish, they confirmed to be spicy, wasn't spicy though. But it tasted awesome.
This was the review of my last affair with barbq. Overall it was a mixed day with some sheer brilliance and unusual goof ups. But what was best was the attention/service of the waiters and the smile with which they served the food.
Also, I must say the indian food is awesome as well, especially the kebabs and chicken butter masala. I'd definitely wanna have naan and chicken butter masala from here than any other dhaba, any day!!

First time I am reviewing a place without even eating there. I had been to Bar-B-Q multiple times last year when I was in the city. I came back to this place after a long time when I was in Kolkata. Unfortunately I came at the peak hours in the evening, and the managers taking reservations were extremely rude. I asked the waiting time,  they couldn't comment. I was asked to go and check myself if there are seats available which did not make sense to me at all. When I came back and asked the the manager on what I should do, I was spoken to very rudely. I embarrassed myself in front of a couple of my colleagues to whom I had told a lot of good things about Bar-B-Q. Never going there again.

Situated just opposite Park Street Flurys Bar-B-Q offers both Indian and Chinese cuisine though the variety in chinese is much more than Indian and they are mainly famous for chinese. The ambience is very good and adorable. staffs are very courteous.this is a good option for friends outing or reunion too. Price is reasonable and quantity is really good...if you order for two it will be enough for three. also try their dumplings...they are awesome.

I LOVE BAR-B-Q!

It's one restaurant which has never, ever disappointed me. Right from the Chinese zodiac printed mats to the perfectly made food, it'll always have a special place in my heart. I had my first date here with my partner, more than 6 years ago and since then it has been a happy place for us. 

The food here is stellar, if you like Chinese, you'll love Bar-B-Q. For starters, the red pepper chicken, the red pepper fish and the pan fried chilly fish are highly recommended. My personal favourite is the pan fried chilly fish. The fish fingers are very, very good as well. The portions are big, ideal for two people to share. 

For the main course, we usually have the mixed fried rice (and on rare occasions, the hakka noodles) along with dragon chicken (spicy and very flavourful), chicken with mixed vegetables (mild and super comforting, pairs very well with garlic fried rice), hunan chicken or kung pao chicken. 

Their ice cream with lychees is also very nice, though we never end up with room for dessert usually. 

I must say I can never give the beer with Cheezlings a miss, each time I come here. One of my favourite places in Calcutta, for sure. :)

Another old Kolkata gem.
I went to the Chinese section of the restaurant. GOOD FOOD!!
They have this soup called "Chimney" soup. See photo for reference. Subtle nutritious  soup with veggies n chicken. Meant for 4, however, 6 can easily satiate with this.

A very old restaurant which used to serve only Indian dishes . They now serve Chinese too. Decided to try it. 

Had the mixed Hakka noodles and chilly pork. Both dishes tasted great and complemented each other . 

A satisfying experience at lunch.

Can't think where to go. Not in a mood to experiment. Want good, no, great food, bar b q it is. Worth the wait for a table then start with the chilli garlic pepper chicken & red pepper fish. Wash down with Tuborg premium beer. A chicken wanton soup (if you r into soups) or simply dive into burnt ginger and capsicum fried rice and sliced chilli pork. Always follow with darsan and vanilla ice cream.
Believe me when I say, the memories of that meal will linger long after the food has been digested.
2. 05 Nov 2016 Try the chicken dumpling wrapped in bak choi, pan fried chili fish for starters.
Pan fried mixed chow and sliced schewzan chilli pork. Wash it down with chilled Fosters Beer.

Wow..went here on saturday night with my office colleagues(all men). We were rudely told by the management that the dining hall is for "family" only and sent us to a bar filled with drunk stags even after repeated assurances that we wont be drinking in the family section.

Coming from a city like Mumbai, where the restaurants welcome their patrons with open arms and courtesy, the behaviour of the management is pretty apalling and spoils the image which I have for Kolkata as a tourist.

What I would suggest is that instead of just chucking us out, they could have placed restrictions on the alcohol we consumed or placing the condition that they wont serve alcohol at all which we would have readily agreed to. 

Ended up leaving without having dinner.

Food is too tasty.
Service : 3.5/5
Ambience : 2.5/5 very noisy
Food : 5/5
One minus point is no bookings on weekends. 
Once I waited 1.5 hours for a table.

What's not to like? This is a sure fire tried and "tasted" place whenever we're in the mood for North Indian cuisine. Right from the stuffed tandoori aloo(potatoes), paneer(cottage cheese chunks) tikka (char grilled chunks) to the garlic naan and their signature Begum Bahar and the other assorted vegetables, everything was spot on. And it was a Tuesday evening but they had people waiting despite the 3 huge dining halls! Wow!

We had spicy chicken as starters, mixed chowmen (hakka) and schezwan chicken as the main course. We were two, and could hardly finish the things on table. So for quantity a huge thumbs up. Now talking about quality, I would say it's average, the crispy chicken had a very distinct flavor which I loved. But I can't say the same for both the main course. They didn't have any extra appeal. The place is generally crowded and noisy, but again that is the part of it ambience. Must for vintage visits, otherwise people can afford to slip the place.

At it's peak, you would have to wait for a table at Bar-B-Q for lunch on a weekday. Think about that for a moment. Bar-B-Q is no tiny boutique restaurant which can seat only 20-30 people at a time. It can accommodate, and this is an estimate, close to 150 people at any point in time. Maybe more, I don't know.  But, the point is that in a minimum 150-seater restaurant you have to wait at least twenty minutes to find a table for lunch. 

If you just do the numbers, they will tell you that at one point, a majority of the people in Kolkata wanted to only spend their money in Bar-B-Q. And why wouldn't they? With a robust Indian and Chinese menu and quality that has been consistent for so many decades, it is like going to that friend's house where you know you will come out laughing and it doesn't matter if you are veg or non-veg because you know you will have a good time.

I have cousins and friends who no longer go to Bar-B-Q because that is where their parents took them every fortnight for a meal. They would order the same thing and be very satisfied.

I still go to Bar-B-Q and order the same thing. I start with a Chicken Seekh Kebab, which is the best Chicken Seekh Kebab I've had in my life. There have been times where my father has had a drink or two and has craved the Chicken Seekh Kebab and I would make a quick run to Bar-B-Q and get those succulent, flavorful pieces of Seekh for my father but mostly for myself. 

Then I have a Chicken Lemon Coriander Soup. See, what I did there. I ordered an Indian and a Chinese starter together and you can do that in Bar-B-Q. Then I either order a Panfried Noodles with a Chilli Pork or a Reshmi Butter Masala with Rotis depending on my mood after the starters.

The best thing about Bar-B-Q is how affordable it is to this day. You can have a meal in less than 500 rupees per person in the center of Park Street and leave satisfied. Also, because it is such a big place, you never have to wait more than 20 minutes.

With the food revolution picking up in Urban India, new restaurants have popped up all over the city and have won the hearts of many but Bar-B-Q is an old guard that can compete with any new kid on the block. I wish the restaurant eternal success and hope that the next generation of Kolkatans give it the respect it deserves and don't fall for fancy decors and yuppy menus.

At the heart of park street, is the legendary restaurant, Bar-B-Q. The locations and a perfect word of mouth has lead to the constant flow of people to this place. The restaurant management is fast and very efficient. Flawless quality. They serve Indian and Chinese cuisine, both the kitchen operate separately.

Bar-B-Q is one of my favourite restaurants in Kolkata. This restaurant is on Park Street, one of the busiest place of Kolkata. This restaurant is quite popular for its Chinese & North Indian food. I had been to this restaurant a couple of times. This time I visited with my family during lunch hours. Car parking you have to manage on your own. The ambience of the restaurant is a classic one!

We started with Vegetable Manchow Soup & Vegetable Sweet Corn Soup. Both the soup was good, although I liked Vegetable Manchow Soup more than Sweet Corn Soup. In the Starters we had ordered Crispy Chilly Baby Corn & Vegetable Manchurian Dry. Crispy Chilly Baby Corn was crispy, tangy & yummy! Vegetable Manchurian Dry was also good with the adequate flavours of vegetables & spices.

In the Main Course we had ordered Potato in Hot Garlic Sauce, Burnt Ginger Capsicum Fried Rice & Vegetable Hakka Chowmein from their Chinese menu. Additionally we had ordered Paneer Butter Masala, Chana Masala & Garlic Naan from their North Indian menu as few of my family members wanted to have North Indian food. In the beverages we had ordered Orange & Pineapple Blossom. 

Burnt Ginger Capsicum Fried Rice did not meet my expectation, the flavour of Ginger was missing! Vegetable Chowmein was really good & delicious! The vegetables Carrot, Onion, Capsicum etc. were adequately cut & properly mixed with Noodles & spices. Potato in Hot Garlic Sauce was good although not spicy but going well with Burnt Ginger Capsicum Fried Rice.

I had also tasted their Chana Masala, Paneer Butter Masala & Garlic Naan. All the items were good, especially Garlic Naan & Chana Masala. In all my visits to Bar-B-Q I have always had Chinese food only. Next time I would definitely try their North Indian food.

The staff was courteous & service was quick although the restaurant was full! Considering the taste & service the price is reasonable!

I don't know why location gets a plus point coz parking is such a task to get here but none the less one place you can go anytime to find it buzzing with chitter chatter from other tables.. Ambience needs an upgrade. Used to love the Chinese here but now I only land up gorging on indian food.. The daal and pindi chana is simply sinful...butter paneer too.. Only place where I land up eating my entire bread rather than half and land up over eating coz I just can't get enough ! Yummy

Will have to add a few more words as zomato doesn't allow reviews below 140 characters.  So, yes they are good and a nice place to dine. With the number of people turning out here the ambience becomes a bit cacophonic (not a word. I know)

One of the most hyped restaurant in the city.. but is it really worth the buzz?? Lets dig onto my experience.!!
It was weekend afternoon and 8 of us walked in the locale friendly place... we were alloted a round table . Happy!!
We asked for the drinks menu.. which was very confidently given.. as we started to order we were told to avail most of the best drinks in the card we should have enteted into Flavours of China..which is another restaurant with big gate and merges with Bar B Q upstairs.. 😮😮😮
After few requests mojito and screwdrivers were served.. both were good...
STARTERS: really good... red pepper fish..was the best... crispy chilli baby corn was yummy and the chicken was well cooked

MAIN COURSE: Mixed haka which was average.kung pao chicken was okey.. and devils chicken was pretty good with unique taste..

SERVICE; Theres a room for a lot of improvement.. waiters need to be more open and courteous with the customers. With the springing up of new eateries in the city... The service provided is way beyond expectation in many places..Here is where most of the well known old eateries lag behind!

Last week for lunch. Since it was a weekday seats were easily available. Service here is quick but the waiters dont hear you well. We wanted soup before any starters but they served everything together. So if you want to give them instructions say that twice. Ambience is just fine. Their extremely hot sauce on table is great. Its a must try!! Also try their Red Pepper Fish in the starter section. And the prawns in their rice. U can call em lobsters. ;)

Very good Chinese and Indian dishes shine at this Park street staple.  The chicken seekh kabobs are out of this world, scented with spices and fragrant with flavor. The pan fries Shanghai chicken dumplings were also lovely, gently flavored and beautifully cooked, crisp at the bottom but still soft at the top. 

As a main course we got the highly ubiquitous butter chicken, which was not my favorite, which is not to say it wasn't well done, but its sweetness and creamy texture lacked the savoury finish I enjoy in a butter chicken, although my companion gobbled it up with glee. Oh well, thats what we get for getting something so basic.

The service was excellent and the ambiance lovely if not modern, which is fine, sometimes you want charm more than chrome.

I visited one of the Kolkata 's old favourites with my wife for lunch. We reached just before the afternoon rush and were quickly seated. The waiter was helpful in suggesting the dishes to try and the starters came fairly quickly. For vegetarians i suggest do try the dahi ke kabab which is served with a interesting curd dip. The fish tikka was great too! Paneer pasanda was nicely prepared and the naans were soft.

Location : Park Street. Time : 6 : 30. No of heads : 2.

Heading in for an early dinner, we decided to choose Bar-B-Q, featured in the 'legendary resteraunts ' in zomato as our go to.

Been here on multiple occasions, I keep going back there for the great Chinese food they serve and the nice, easy and rich dining experience they provide. So here is what you need to know :

Location : Located in the heart of the city, Park street, it is easily accessible from all areas of kolkata and can be easily pinpointed.

AMBIENCE : its a three storyed resto cum bar. The place is huge with a seating capacity of 150 to 200 by my estimates. The ground floor has a bar area which serves alcohol at a little cheaper rates. The second floor and magazine area are for pure dining. The paintings on the wall and dim golden lights mix up well with the wooden furnishing and red interiors. Needless to say, the entire area is carpeted.

Food : Excellent Chinese food. We ordered crispy chilli babycorn, hakka noodles and veg manchurian. As rightly pointed out by my friend, they serve the best baby corn in town. Crispy, chilli and the corn was found to be neither undercooked or over cooked.

SERVICE and STAFF: Fast and efficient. Although they were pestering a bit in contrary to my previous experiences here.

POCKET PINCH : 700 for 2. Not heavy on the pocket if you are looking for a dinner place in Park street with such good overalls.

Heads up : The resteraunt is really busy during lunch and dinner hours. Reservations are not taken and you might have to wait for some time to get a table if you go there at peak hours.

This is one of the best restaurants in Kolkata, at least for Chinese food (never had North Indian food here so can't comment). The ambience is just excellent! I'd give 5 stars to quality, quantity, ambience and pricing. And the location is park street, the prime location for restaurants! I've loved my visits to this place and continue to look for opportunities to go there again and again! This is also one of the biggest restaurants in Kolkata in terms of area.

The All seasons VFM.
Have frequented this place for the last 20 years or so.
No trip to Kolkata is complete without a visit to this place.
Its amazing that they have been able to make the place look almost the same for the past so many years.
Its a huge restaurant if you consider all the sections of Chinese, Indian.
However, its still always buzzing.
From the Veg Manchow soup, to Crispy corn, Veg crispy babycorn to the Noodles, rice and the Special Manchurian, take a pick and most are good.

Now settled in Mumbai, the reason why the rating is 4 and not higher is because the Service part can get better. They know that people will throng to the place, the service can get better, maybe Mumbai has raised my expectations, buy in VFM category, its for all seasons

There are always some places in every city which have been a part of the cultural fabric of the city by the sheer number of years they've been operational. Bar b q is one of them. Located in what is essentially the food hub of the city right in front of the iconic flury's bakery, it does live up to its hype. Composed of three dining areas, North Indian, Chinese and a mixed section it offers quality food in a wonderful ambience.

We've been coming here for years and thus reviewing individual dishes would not be feasible but regardless of what dish you point out on the menu there is a high probability you'll like it. That said the Chinese salad and the Tandoori aaloo on the Chinese and Indian menu respectively are good choices to begin your meal with.

The service has deteriorated with time which regulars would be able to discern and the lighting seems ever so dim for the evening meal but these are small annoyances worth bearing for what comes on your plate.

Bar b q. One of the most finest restaurants that one can find in Kolkata at one one the most affordable rates. Everything about this place is just amazing. The food is heavenly. The staffs are at their best behaviour and their service forces you to make sure you visit the restaurant again. It is one of the most popular restaurants . The food. The ambience. The location. The service. Everything about this place is just perfect.
If you're a food lover and would really like to have a quality meal at one of the best locations of the city. It is just the place you need to be. It's been 14 years since I've been going to that place. And trust me people I've never been disappointed.

This one has been a favourite for a LONG, long time. Out of the many dishes I've tried, the Chilli garlic chicken, Szechuan chilli pork, crispy chilli baby corn, the mixed Hakka noodles are my favourite. I've tried some of the naans and dal makhani and soups, and they're quite mouth-watering too. If you've not been there yet, go ASAP.

Perhaps the most underrated restro in the joint, it will never disappoint you.One can never have a bad food day here. The place is well maintained,spacious and offers an exceptionally warm hospitality and a decent list of eatables. The items too are moderately price and the service is pretty prompt. The Chimney Soup is a must try and so are the Heavenly Drums.

This review is for home take away hence only about food. No reflections on service or ambiance.

We had :-
Dal Makhni
Malai Kofta
Paneer tikka
Butter naan
Dhai kabab 
Chinese salad


Dal makhni and Malai kofta were alright. Can't complain however nothing exciting either

Paneer tikka want very different from the rest.
Breads on the other hand were delicious. Very soft, delicious and fresh.

Highlight of the day was dahi kabab n Chinese salad.. No less than splendid is how I would describe it.
I would return to this place simple for these two if not anything else. It's a must try.

I ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Mixed fried rice & Tutti Frutti (Large). One Mixed fried rice is sufficient for 2 people, Kung Pao Chicken was spicy and good.
Must try: Tutti Frutti ice cream. Its loaded with fruits, strawberry syrup & a cherry on the top...
Overall a good experience. Love to visit this place again :-)

If names of some restaurants are obvious with Kolkata city then Bar-B-Q is surely one of them and a prominent one.
Any day of the year...the restaurant is always busy. So no matter how busy you are, you need to wait at least for ten minutes till a table is allocated to you. Don't worry this gets compensated by warm and friendly managers who do their best to give you a table and then speed and quantity of food is wallah.
Liquor is reasonably priced. I am teetotaller though ...LOL. Pick any item from Indian or Chinese menu....and each item is good or well made but never bad.
I have so many fond memories of this place. My last order was of seafood soup, red peeper prawns and green peas mushroom curry. I left happy and fat :)
Right place to dine with good number of people without paying through your nose, ears or eyes.

Its the usual dish...i order wen ever I go there....the chicken hakka chowmein is also good...and the american chopsy..is worth a mention... It was one of my...fav...place to celebrate frnds b'days...during my clg days...The Ambiance in the restaurant part is good..and one can hav a fun time with..friends here...The QUANTITY is quite hearty...here...a plat..of mixed fried rice is enough.. For an average two person..Only thing I DIDN'T LIKE here is during the..Rush hours...they send you...to the bar at the ground floor...even if u don't drink...and i simply... Don't like going to its bar...so..whenever this..happens..I go.to some other near by restaurant...ANOTHER... DOWNSIDE I felt is all these years hav passed by i haven't seen... Much change in the dishes they hav to offer...hope they..INCREASE THE CHOICE OF DISHES someday..as i really like to go there again ..as this place being quite nostalgic to me.....

An age old restaurant but still serving decent food. We were seated at the ground floor area. 
The intention was to have some Chinese food (Indian styled).
We ordered for drums of heaven. They were decent. No doubt.
The gravy styled noodles was perfect. The hunan chicken was spicy and good. The fried rice was decent as well. The USP being the quantity. Humongous.
Staff is courteous and helpful. Prices are economical for the taste and quantity.

Very Very Disappointing. First of all in a restaurant kind of place they treat stag males as dogs and nothing better. They have made a secured enclosure for male members who are not accompanied by any female member and or are alone and the difference in the ambiance of both is of a slum and a bungalow. When I went, I took a seat and started to wait for my friend upon which a Old age fat male steward/Captain came upto me and started questioning what made u sit in family section when u r alone. I went for the first time there and it was puja time so it was crowded. Rather than being polite and asking to wait the the seperate male enclosure what they have made he literally shouted at me and asked me to get up and leave as if I am a servant. Everyone sitting near by were looking at me as if I committed some crime and It made me feel so embarrass.  I requested him that I am waiting for someone and plz allow me to wait. He was like I no no go down. I again requested him but he denied. Then When I went down, I requested for warm water which they denied to serve saying there is huge rush and they cant serve warm water as it is out of menu. Then they served papad which was not at all hot and felt as if it has been roasted hours back. I ordered for Paneer Butter Masala which was also very very cold and I had such a horrible experience that I had to leave the table and get up.

Location: Beside McDonalds Park street area, opposite of Flurys. 
Ambience: Inspite of the huge rush during the durga pujas, we somehow managed to get a seat in this restaurant. The ambience is pretty nice and the place is very big. There are 3 sections inside the restaurant for sit n dine, which are well decorated and presented. The North Indian section gives you a really nice view of the outside. However, since the place is really huge, it looks a bit crowded.
Starters: Ordered the crispy chilli baby corn and Fried chilli chicken. The food doesn't bring cabaret to your senses but is well prepared. I loved the crispy chilli baby corn
Main Course: Ordered pork Chowmein(gravy) and Fried Rice along with Schezwan Chicken. The Chowmein seemed a bit bland. Required a tad bit of seasoning. But the fried rice was well prepared.

If you are looking out to spend some quality time without burning a hole in your pocket then this is where you should be. A quality ambiance at a friendly budget. Our order included chicken biryani and chicken tandoori kebab (pardon I forgot the exact name)..but whats in a name as long as it tastes great! The biryani tasted average. Nevertheless I would like to return to this place as nowhere else I can find such superb ambiance affordable to even the 'student' class!

Being one of our favourite restaurants for the past several years, went to dine today the 22nd of October, 2015 at about 5:15 P.M. on our way home after a long day of Pandal Hopping. Had a peculiar and unpleasant experience this time. On entering through the smaller gate of the restaurant marked "Flavours of China", we were guided upstairs to the family hall only to be informed after reaching upstairs that they were closing and would reopen on 7:00P.M. One of the staffs redirected us to the other section of the restaurant which was supposed to remain open throughout. But on reaching the said section which was adjacent to the former and with the larger entrance, we were told by the security on duty there that they were closing too and would reopen at 7:00 P.M. Being utterly surprised and confused, as I asked this man about the reason for such miscommunication, he told us very rudely that he didnt care what the staff of the other section of the same hotel told us and was not answerable to me in any way. Then he immediately became preoccupied with bowing and wishing some of the departing customers (for obvious reasons). Such lack of courtesy and mismanagement at the very welcome section of such a big and reputed establishment is not only very hurting but also for the first time I felt that there should be some provisions for giving negative ratings in this popular forum under such circumstances. Anyways we had spent a beautiful evening at a much more cordial and hospitable Tung Fong just a stone's throw away from this place.

All the managers are very polite,friendly and they always greet you with a smile on their face. The food is no doubt great both quantity and quality wise. And yes this is an ideal place for both vegeterians and non vegiterians. If nothings on your mind where to go for a dinner or lunch this is a place you can head for without a second thought.

This place guarantees you full satisfaction no matter what you order..  Food,  Service and Ambience.. All are too good and it's a place loved by all in Kolkata.  
Must visit.

Had chilly fish egg fried rice and chilli paneer. Both egg fried and chilli fish were awesome. Chilli fish will receive special brownie points Staffs were very coordial and ambience was good. But the chilli paneer was a disaster too much garlic destroying the aroma of the dish. Overall a satisfactory experience. Would rate it 3.9 out of 5.

Went there on Saturday around 7 pm. The food was average nothing to write home about. Would have given it a 3 or 3.5 if it hadn't been for the service. The classics of kolkata like moulin rouge mocambo peter cat etc are successful even today inspite of the new restaurants popping up with more extravagant menus every other day for one simple reason. That even though they might have nothing new or exotic to offer in terms of dishes. Their service retains the old world charm. The personal touch. But bar bq has none of that. When we entered the restaurant was relatively empty with only 3/4 tables occupied. 7 waiters plus managers were standing at the entrance and suggested we go upstairs as there were only two of us. Fine. Not an issue. But no one came to escort us to the table. We went up and down twice hunting for a table in the huge restaurant. Finally found a table. The waiter had no idea which cocktails were available. Nor was he aware of the composition of the drinks on the menu. Finally after all that drama. We ordered one veg chilli garlic noodles. Corn gravy. And crispy konji chicken. Along with cosmopolitans after the waiter had gone back and forth deciding on its availability. The noodles were ok. Nothing special. The crispy konji chicken was quite good. The forn though was awful. It tasted like a rajma gone wrong. The drinks were too syrupy and weak to be palatable. All in all between the arrogant managers. Clueless waiter and the average food. It was a pathetic affair. Not an experience i would like to recommend to anyone. Park street has plenty of old classic restaurants with better food and much better service. Please go there if you're in the mood for dining at a classic this puja with

We waited for an hour, we were asked to wait for an hour. A table for 5 wasn't available even after the drunks came out, one by one.
When we approached, we were asked to wait for another hour as only one table of 3 people was available.
People entered and exited, but we never got the call to come in or sit was available. I was astounded, I still am.
I hoped for some good food tonight.
I will be going again, but I am disappointed.

It's one of the best chinese restaurant in kolkata.they are having indian cuisines also. The rate is pretty decent and the behavior of the waiters are very homely.only one bad point is they dont allow Boy's/Men's group to sit with others. They have seperate areas for them.

Spacious,comfortable and warm ambience.The decoration of the restuarant radiates an oriental feeling.The staff and service is good.We ordered pork manchurian,veg fried rice and mandarin fish.The pork manchurian was spot on,it satiated our taste buds to the T.The veg fried rice was good though nothing special.The mandarin fish spoilt it all; the fish was so salty,the Winchesters used it to exorcise a demon.They seriously need to check the amount of salt they put in their dishes.So apart from the mandarin fish,everything else was good.Recommended!

Though the place doesn't need any introduction, what surprised me was the prices for such an uptown posh little restaurant. Everything was spot on with the place. the waiters were prompt and helpful, food arrived at a brisk pace, the decor was very nice so was the food. Having ordered the typical Indian chinese dishes we did not expect to be blown away but the taste was really very good and did not leave us wanting. The fried rice was good with a lot of chicken chunks, the szechuan chilli pork was really nice and so was the hunan chicken. We had also ordered the kung pao chicken but I did not have a taste of that and had left it for my friends to devour. The drums of heaven were good too. All in all, a somwhat posh dining experience with good food at a surprising affordable price range.

Located in one of the most happening areas in kolkata- park street. I have never found this place "not crowded"..and this statement is based on the numerous dining experiences i have had there. This place never disappoints me, be it the service, the ambiance, the behavior of the staff, the quality of food.
I prefer to have north Indian whenever i visit this restaurant. Love the dal Bukhara they serve, paneer makhani and the subz jhalfarezi...you shouldn't give a miss to their starters either, paneer tikka, crispy chilly baby corn, and almost everything they have on their menu. I highly recommend this place to everyone. A must try place. 
Overall:
Food: 4.5
Ambiance: 4
Service: 4
Value for money: 4
Hygiene: 4

Never seen this place go empty. Pretty spacious for a restaurant that is always crowded. Luckily we didn't have to ever wait for our table.
The food here is very tasty with good quantity. Never were we disappointed in whatever food  have ordered so far.
The only problem that we have always faced here is their service quality. The food takes a lot of time to get prepared and even when we want to pack our leftovers it takes 15-20mins for the work to be done!
My personal favourite is- Pan fried fish , Chicken with cashernuts/almonds, Kung pao chicken, Bar-B-Q special fried rice
Pricing is always done decently, overall good value for money.
Would always like to come back and dine here :)

Had an extremely disappointing experience with barbq. Went there 2 days back for lunch. On asking the person in charge for a place for two, he asked me where the other person was. On telling him that my friend was on his way, he said that he apparently could not let me have a table until the other person reached, reason being we would be 'blocking, the table. This response of theirs was very arrogant and disrespectful. I hope the management looks into the behaviour of such senior staff, so that they don't humiliate any customer again.

I visited the place with one friend of mine for dinner. The place has two separate entries, one for the Chinese restaurant and the other one for indian food. Although both restaurants are linked inside and it doesn't make any difference from where you enter and where you sit. (I thought this was worth mentioning) 

The service is good and you are well attended. Actually I felt we were 'over-attended' infact, a bit bothering but still can't really complain. 

Food is good, that's it.  Nothing much special that i felt about the food which i can say. Its tasty enough that i have no reason to either excessively praise or criticise it. I loved the ambience for a normal mid priced dine in restaurant.

It was very late but we were craving for Chinese. .we were park street bound checked Tung Fong it was closed. Walked down and found Flavours of China open. The restaurant was full so we were seated at Barbeque. The restaurant was humming with the Saturday night bustle. We ordered Chicken Manchow soup, chicken sweet corn soup followed by appetizers Red pepper fish and Fried Chilli chicken.  Soups were heavenly with exact flavours bursting in the mouth. Red pepper fish was a bit spicy but super tasty. The Fried Chilli chicken was the best appetizer when you crave Chinese flavour. Mains hubby chose to have Indian.  Settled for a Mutton Dopiaza and a Butter Naan. We wanted to keep it simple so a Mixed fried rice without pork and King Prawn in Devil's Sauce less spicy was our take. Mutton Dopiaza had tender boneless meat succulent sized with an exoticly spiced Indian gravy. He said it was breathtakingly flavoursome. Fried rice was super aromatic , flavourful and had big coin sized prawns. The King Prawn in Devil's Sauce stole the show. Fleshy , fresh , big finger sized prawns tossed in a spicy mouthwatering sauce. Simply enigmatic.  Staff was very courteous,  cordial even on this late busy night. Highly recommended if you wish to get those Old Kolkata days experience, where quality and price went hand in hand. Would definitely visit again n again. Truly 'Legendary '!!!

Visited this place on a hunch for a quick drink during noon.. and truth be told.. only cos the other "good" places known to me on Park street were all having long ques outside.

So walked into this... and lemme say that we were extremely lucky to get a table here.. cos the place was fullllll. All age groups... a kids gang, college guys n gals, middle aged office goers and senior citizens... thronged this place.

We ordered for beer and crispy veg rolls. Though the order serving took lot of time.. bt the wait was worth it. The dish was awesome. Wanting to try more.. we ordered for crystal veg dimsums... again the dis turned out to be somethng that we hadnt tasted earlier. Awesome. Too bad that we didnt have time to grab a proper lunch. My rating for food... 4.5/5.

Ambience was reminiscent of old time resturants... large windows, old wooden look... all were sooo charming. My rating... 4/5

Service.. a bit slow. My rating... 3.5/5

Overall... 4/5. Would definately visit this place again.

Visited on last Wednesday. It is one of the legendary restaurant in Kolkata. Nice ambiance, dark environment with soft lights, place for perfect dinner. The officials are very cordial and efficient. We got to seat on the top floor, bit of hanging floor kind. They have separate menus for Chinese and Indian/Mughal dishes.  We opted for Chinese as it is well known for Chinese cuisine. We ordered Chili Garlic Pepper Chicken and Red Pepper Fish in starters along with Sweet Lime Soda and Pineapple juice. The starters were served within 10 mins, both of the dishes were good in quantity and  taste. In main course we ordered Mixed Fried Rice, Sliced Chili Pork. The rice was not that great but the chili pork was the real deal, again both of the dishes were huge in quantity. They also have alcohols. So over all nice place for  dinner/any celebration and definitely  value for money.

Apart from the dim sums nothing was good .. Hakka noodles had no salt no flavour and the noodles seemed stale .. Chilli potato was no good either .. American chopsuey was so so so sweet that we had to return it .. I guess would never like to back to this place again !

A big plus for Bar-B-Q is the aura of this place - vintage interiors, dim lights and the perfect music that supplements the food. Love it.
An upscale place with luxurious, spacious ambience, the restaurant has 3 separate sections for different (groups of) customers.
Service is homely - polite like it should be.
Food is not bad - delicious if you are a Chinese cuisine fan. One reason why I'd visit here is the wide range and variety on their menu card.
Crowd is okay. Gets better in the evenings.

We went to this place on the 27th of September, it was a Sunday and we feared there wouldn't be any seats available but to our surprise, tables were arranged as soon as we made the query and we were escorted to our tables. 

The services offered by the waiters are very good. Bar-B-Q's waiters are more caretakers and less waiters, yes they are that good. 

The insides of the restaurant is very pretty. Smooth floors with squeaky comfortable couches, sectioned potions for different cuisines, the entire theme is governed by a dark brownish/reddish tinge lightly soaked under a mellow yellow light, which looks all the more welcoming. Ambiance wise this is one of the best places I have been to.

Food: We tried the Chello Kebab, Kebab platter, Kung pow chicken and two bowls of fried rice and some low-alcoholic drinks to drown the food. What left me amazed was the quantity of the main course dishes. The kebabs don't come in many numbers but they compensate with perfect taste and smoky flavour, one of the best I have had in the city. Two bowls of fried rice and one bowl of chicken were more than enough to quiet down the rumbling stomach. After eating you would just sit there and think how good the food was because it is a that good. 

Would I visit this place again? Absolutely yes.

Chinese and Bar-B-Q are synonymous. My favourite place since childhood. The bunch of balloons tied on the staircase still excite me. The food never changes. Its the highlight of an evening in parkstreet. The staff is extremely cordial and warm. Fit for all occassions from birthday parties for kids to kitty parties for the women. the spinach cheese rolls leave my mouth watering. The portions are generous and the bill is justified. it is crowded at all times for I recommend you leave a little early on the weekends.

Indian or Chinese, whatever you order is fabulous. Very difficult to get a place on the weekends. Weekdays are no less, you do have to wait, but it is what you have to be prepared for if you want to visit this place. 

Cons: 
1) Parking in the area is a tough job
2) Waiting Time

Food: There is a reason Bar-B-Q is so well known! It is because their food is impeccable! I have been here multiple times and returned home with a happy belly, every single time!
Cost: It is 'Legendary', so the cost is a bit on the higher side, but keeping in mind the quantity and the quality, we are not complaining :D

Overall, this place has never disappointed!

The restaurant is basically a chinese food wonder, but they also serve north Indian food and drinks. The chinese preparations are very good. The price is reasonable. For food and price I would have given it 5 on 5, but service is a bit slow and tad. But highly recommended.

Anytime you visit this place- its full! You have to wait! If it's Chinese or north Indian- nobody had any complaint! The restaurant had build its name in such a manner that people don't even mind waiting! If anyone in Kolkata hasn't visited this Park Street restaurant- buck up! The chilli garlic noodles and chilli potato are a must try! From north Indian- the paneer butter is waaow!

One of the most popular eateries of Park Street, this place is a must visit for all foodiss, especially if you are not from Cal. Have literally grown up eating there. Very well-maintained and clean.. Its pretty crowded on weekends and even on weekdays post 8.30. Have tried almost all their popular Chinese dishes, favourite being Crispy Konjee Lamb, Chicken, Crispy Chilly Babycorn, Veg Manchurian, Pan Fried Fish, Pan Fried Noodles, Chicken in hot garlic,Chilly Pork etc. Indian dishes are equally lip smacking, specially their Keema Naan, Garlic Naan alongwith Chicken Tikka Masala, Mutton Roganjosh etc. Prices are standard keeping in mind the location and ambience. Sharing few pics only from my last visit.

I would gjve 5 points to Bar-B-Q if it served as tasty food when crowded as it does usually.
It has a decent ambience and the staff is very attentive.  
U get the best Chinese food here and specially the Chinese chopsuey is simply amazing. You may not like drums of heaven as the sauce is not properly done.  Indian food as well is tasty. Quantity is too good. 
It is my all time favourite but try to avoid on weekends or holidays because the taste of food isn't the same on such days.

Old time favourite, from a time when Chinese in its pure, traditional form was hardly considered "fine-dining", and the How Huas and Fung Fas and Tung Nams and Shanghais of Old Chinabazar, Free School Street and Christopher Road would give Park Street a serious run for their money. Excellent range, from Chimney Soup [still served on a smoldering bed of coals]to the finely braised Fish and Seafood in Wine Sauce.Price on the higher-middle range. Trained captains and service personnel. Good "platter-to-plate", though could improve a little as regards the Silver:order  à la russe if you want to savour the food warm, a standing suggestion for Chinese in Kolkata [which favours  à la française for all cuisines, thus compromising freshness]. The bak-choi based dishes and meifoon are truly recommended. Pork a little less spicy could be an add-on, but who are we to complain? Excellent old-world decor, with a lot of space done up in style reminiscent of the old Ferazzini and Sky Room. A pleasure, if you could afford to wait a little, at times [though not the Beggar's Row experience forever reminiscent of Peter Cat]. Kudos to Shivji and Baba, for those who know what we are talking about.

If I have to make a list of my 5 favorite restaurants in Kolkata, It will be really difficult for me to leave out Bar-B-Q.

This place has been a long time favorite for me. So much so that I took her out to this place on our first date.

The location could not be beat! It is in the middle of everything, and yet you sit at a quiet and elegant place. The place oozes elegance. The decor and the bow tie servers would make it feel more expensive than it really is.

Few things can go wrong there. I had great food there, every single time. The price is very reasonable. The service is quick. The choices are plenty. Moreover, unlike a lot of other 'heritage' places, the food quality has not gone Southwards here.

So, where did that last 1/2-star go? The drinks. During my last few visits I thought the drinks are a little diluted.

Taste was great and to my liking. The price might feel a bit high but it compensates for the great food. A great experience for me. Will visit again.

The food served here is delicious undoubtedly. It has always been a favourite. But the last time i visited here(around 2 months back) we ordered veg manchow soup and were served some chicken soup instead. (The waiter was strictly told that everything should be vegetarian.) That was highly disappointing and i haven't visited the place since.

I see a lot of negative reviews about bar-b-que, however what ever people may say this restaurant is legendary. It is full every day of the week , even during lunch in weekdays there is waiting. The waiting is not too long as the guest turnover is fast. The food is delicious and the service is fast. Even though the lighting is dim and it is noisy, that is the feel of this restaurant. Their crispy chilli babycorn, drums of heaven, Chinese salad, American corn, dumplings, tsing hoi chicken, Devils chicken, general Tao chicken, Hakka noodles, veg Manchurian, seasonal garden vegetables, etc. are delicious. Their North Indian is also great but I usually have the Chinese. So don't pay to much attention to the negative reviews and definitely go to bar-b-que to eat at kolkata's legendary restaurant

Went to BAR-B-Q Restaurant after a long gap. This used to be our frequent den during our college days way back in 70's for a good and substantial Chinese meal in the Park Street area( there were hardly any options those days apart from few) and this was definitely the best. What I noticed this time that although they are trying to maintain the same standard, the quality of servers or bearers along with the stewards have literally taken a nose dive. We were amazed to see at the end of our meal the whole bunch of bearers ogling to see how much tip we would leave behind for them. As a matter of fact, the main person who served us was standing right next to us to see how much cash we dish out( since we paid by plastic) and he didn't budge till we placed the "baksheesh " in that leather folder of there's. Absolutely disgusting behaviour.. Even the steward were unhelpful and were reluctant to talk or help with their suggestions and was st
anding throughout with a glum face. How I miss their old timers Steven and Peter and even that elderly gentleman who were always there to welcome you at the top of the staircase. It is time that the owner, the younger Kothari takes note of this. For reference, our bill number was 14111 dated September 10, 2015.

My order was Chinese cuisine, some dry chilli fish & chicken, fried dumplings & fried rice & prawn Hakka noodles with kumfao chicken & hot garlic fish. Quantity is pretty good. Food is authentic indo Chinese as kolkatians prefer. Dumplings were not made to perfection I would say. Serving time is quick & service is good as well. It's a place for indian & Chinese cuisine only.

If you are looking for a traditional restaurant for a family eating out in Kolkata, then you have come to the right place. Bar-B-Q is a restaurant where you can find good reception, accommodation and commitment. We went there with my family for a lunch. We had Chinese cuisine. The amount was more than enough. Quality was good. If you want to know whether I would recommend Bar-B-Q..yes..I would.

Hey everyone, I have been going to bar b q since the past 10 yrs and my parents used to go there almost every weekend. It was our favourite, serving the finest quality food at decent prices. However, very sadly the food quality and service has deteriorated drastically. Yesterday I had the worst experience at bar b q!! The fried rice, rice noodles, crispy chilly baby corn was tasteless and not at all close to the earlier standards. This was still tolerable. However the heights were reached when one of the manager misbehaved when we asked him to change the drinks which were tasteless. He spoke so rudely as if he is talking to some random person on road! His name was Steven (not the old one, some one new with a similar name) !! Had no sense of talking whatsoever. I feel disheartened to see this state of bar b q as going to bar b q was a ritual and we have so many memories attached to it! The last thing you want to be is ill behaved with, in a restaurant. I took a vow that I would never go to bar b q again !

Bar-B-Q is one of those restaurants in Park Street (and in Kolkata) which provide a royal ambiance to food lovers. With time, it has earned a name of its own. The staffs are cordial and sometimes help in suggesting food that one should try out. 

I had visited this restaurant during Christmas along with my friends. We had ordered 2 bottles of Chilled Beer, Hot and sour Soup, Chicken Fried Rice and Kung Pao Chicken. Since, it was 25th of December, there was a huge rush from almost 6 in the evening, and probably it was this reason that the starters (Soup) arrived a bit late. However, it was delicious and was worth the wait. The Chicken fried rice and Kung Pao Chicken were served appropriately without any delay. To sum it up, this place provides quality food in good quantity at a reasonable price.

This was the first restaurant I visited after coming to Kolkata, and I must say till date haven't find a substitute to it . Be it ambience, hospitality, servicing , cost, taste, quality, quantity .. Bar-b-q Park Street beats all with distinction. Our favourite is crispy chilli baby corn , kung pao chicken devil's chicken , garlic noodles and devil's chicken . In Indian , one can try Dal Bhukhari and Chingri Malai Curry .A must visit and fav adda of Kolkatans . You have to wait for atleast 30 mins on Festivals , weekend , Christmas , New year.

With swanky restaurants coming up every day with their ever creative themes some of the older cousins still maintain their content over form principle. And Bar-B-Q is no doubt one of them. Visited the Park Street outlet for an early lunch today and was not disappointed at all. The sweet corn chicken soup had more chicken than sweet corn, and the chicken sui mai was also good, but the starter that really shone bright was the crispy chilli baby corn. Wonderfully crispy and the tossing sauce was just right. The pan fried basa fish had generous portions with crisp exterior and succulent inside. And the only other place that does a better Cantonese noodle in Kolkata is the respected Eau Chew. Overall a very satisfying meal at a very reasonable price. Keep up the good work guys.

This is not a really good place to go. Firstly, the lighting is horrible. You cannot properly see what you're eating. The food also is not something to tell about. The service is also a bit slow. Waiters are in a hurry, and during my first visit there, one waiter fell head over heels with some empty plates he was carrying. I am not at all satisfied with this restaurant.

One of the best restaurants in kolkata offering brilliant food , service , ambience.
Normally I go for Chinese but Indian is excellent too.
Ordered Devils Chicken , Hong Kong Chicken , Mixed Fried Rice & Mixed Chow. Portion is too much enough to feed two people easily.
Everything tasted brilliant.
Lastly ordered for Ice Cream which was delightful.

One of the most Iconic restaurants in Park Street area of Kolkata. This place is always buzzing with energy and the aroma of excellent food. One visit to this iconic restaurant and you are straight away transferred to a different era (probably the charming and classy Kolkata of 80's). Excellent staff. Excellent service. They are probably the best as far as chinese food is concerned. Even their North Indian stuff is equally good. Even after been an iconic restaurant they don't charge a bomb for their food items and the portions are quite good.  A must visit if you happen to be in kolkata and i can guarantee that you will keep coming back to this place.

It's like the go to place in Calcutta. Quite famous even outside Calcutta! The Chinese Bhel is delicious, so is the Dahi Kebab. Always full even on weekdays. Almost all foodies in Calcutta must have been at this place several times. Sometimes you get the feeling of Same Old Same Old because they desperately need a makeover both in terms of decor and their menu.

I've visited this restaurant numerous times. Be it Girlfriends' birthday parties or meeting up with your close friends for a lunch in the park Street area, this has always been the restaurant of choice  because they serve you quality food without affecting your wallet too much. The place for the Chinese cuisine lovers. Easy to locate, serves more than 40+people at a time, spacious and just the perfect atmosphere to have a lunch with your girl, if you know what I mean. The last time I visited the place with a friend of mine, we decided to order chicken fried wantons for starters, bar-b-q special chow and Hunan chicken in the main course and hot chocolate fudge for the girl. The food came after fifteen minutes or so  and as always the food was exceptional along with the service. No negative things to mention and will visit this place again.

I think it's fairly priced compared to the helpings.. Most of the time we had to waste food or pack the rest for home. Love the starters here and service is also courteous.

Just recently been there with my friends for dinner.. nice place to be with family...  very easy to locate as it's on the busy streets of Park street.
Good ambience, Good service, staff quick to response (don't know if it was because of the closing time or not as we had gone there at about 11pm.)
The food was in good quantity and was sufficient for 4 of us. Our order turned out to be adequate. The only thing that turned out to be very disappointing was the cocktail we ordered, there was negligible to no alcohol in our drink, but coz we were tired and didn't want to spoil our mood.. We stopped after the first drink. I guess drinks are not worth the money... It was just waste.
Overall had an average experience here.

Honestly, I wouldn't know what the bad review fuss is all about. For the price, it's one of the best in Park Street. Yes, it does get overcrowded and yes, sometimes the service is off handed, but otherwise, I feel it lives up to it's name. I've been there numerous times and the food is standard (pretty good, in fact). Almost every item on the menu does not disappoint. 
It's a nice place for a weekend dinner, provided you book your table earlier or go a bit earlier than the typical lunch/dinner crowd!

Every Time I have been here, the experience has been better than my last. I had referred this place to my mother for a reunion with her school friends. Guess what!! When the manager got to know this, he gave them a 10% discount for choosing this place for the occasion and he ensured that it was a wonderful lunch and a memorable reunion.

Situated in the main area of Park Street, BAR-B-Q can be easily located. When we enter the restaurant we can always be sure of being greeted by happy faces. Finding a table might look difficult but they always have a place in their restaurant. The air is filled with laughter and sweet smell of the Chinese as well as North Indian food. I have always loved the Chinese here. A great place to catch up and celebrate birthdays. My first time here was on my birthday and it was totally worth it. For starters order Singaporean Chicken, Crispy Chilly Baby corn,and Red pepper Chicken. Singaporean Chicken is so good that you would want to order it again and again. For main course vegetable hakka noodles, veg manchurian, szechuan chilli pork, mixed fried rice, devil's chicken, and kung pao chicken are my favorites. They all have a taste which no other place has been able to replace till now. You are never dissatisfied with their quantity they provide. It can easily suffice 3 people. If you are in Kolkata, you have to visit this place once not only for it's food but it is a tradition.

bar-b-q is a very hearty indian-chinese restraurant. the restraurant is spread out and spacious. The manager is a friendly man, so are the servers. 

I have tried the crispy konjee chicken which is excellent.  the rice and noodles ( whichever u order) are pretty good and standard and consistent in taste. 

all in all, this is a quintessential indian chinese restraurant - with all food slightly greasy, spicy and rich gravies. the place serves alcohol at good price - so a very nice place to hang out with friends.

You dont need to plan n turn up here,make a sudden plan n come here to have really cheap food with booze.The bill always gives you a shock of happiness :)

Coming to my bad experience,as i am a big tym foodie and have visited most of the good places in kolkata i have never faced such RUDE & UNCORDIAL BEHAVIOUR FROM THE STAFF,this had upset me a lot and would not like to visit this place again.I did not face this on my previous two visits here.But I guess may be it was a bad day from their side and took their anguish on me :D

I hope the management looks into my review

Visited this place for the 1st time...and was really impressed with this duplex restaurant.....loved their interiors...it automatically transports you to a different worldWith it's old world charm,it is a must visit restaurant if you are in park street
Coming to food,we went after sunset,so ate only starters...
We had spicy pepper chicken which tasted good but should be avoided if you can't stand spicy food...
Next we had fish fingers,which were crumb fried but that batter was soft unlike in most restaurants...the quality of the fish was good and fresh...their sauces also need a special mention as you get a variety of them starting from chilli sauce to sweet and spicy sauce......drinks are also reasonably priced compared to other restaurants in park street

I picked up food for my family which included their mixed hakka noodles,mixed fried rice and kung pao chicken.
Both the noodles and the rice were huge in quantity,took us two days to finish....it tasted good
Kung Pao chicken was the clear winner for me...

Another one of those hidden gems/ legendary restaurant in the famous for being famous Park Street area. 

A very attractive entrance leads you upstairs to where the restaurant actually is 

My favorite picks have got to be their Kung Pao Chicken, Schezuan Pork and best way to compete a meal is with some Toffee Walnuts with Ice cream.

This place is for lovers of Chinese Food! North Indian has not got a lot of options here. In the veg main course there's hardly ten options. Non veg has got a lot of options. This place has a real classy feel. All the waiters are very gentle which adds to the total experience. Baby corn is the best starter here. Wontons aren't bad either. Located centrally in Park Street, this place is really accessible. Please don't visit this place on weekends otherwise you will have to wait in the queue for a long time. This place isn't that expensive either. A very nice experience with friends or family!

Very sad that this heritage restaurant is not only selling bad quality food, but also into malpractice. 

Sunday afternoon I had gone there with a friend of mine for lunch, rather late lunch, around 5:30pm. Hence we kept it simple. Chicken Hakka Chowmein & Prawn Schwann. 
Firstly the Chowmein was cold , secondly the Prawn (my personal favourite) was cold as well. On top of that the prawn was spongy and it had no freshness. Nevertheless considering the fact that it was an odd hour to have lunch we politely packed the food after eating a bit. 
Now it's the fun part! On asking for the bill, the person concerned told me whether I would b paying in cash or card. On hearing that the bill would be paid in card the person exclaimed that if I pay in cash then I don't have to pay tax and the bill would b around 600 and if not then it would b 800 with tax. I gave him a grin and asked for the swiping machine. The bill was around 600 + and the best part is, the bill was of Chowmein and golden fried prawn. I paid the bill and left. 

Just a thought: the person who is serving and the one who is taking the order are both involved. I guess on hearing about the cash bill and lesser amount, customers who choose the cash mode are not understanding that the entire amount s going to them. 
Thanks !

Visited yesterday with family. Decided to go for the Indian menu instead of the regular oriental. The oriental food here is something to vouch for both in terms of quality and quantity.The indian food however does not live for it's name.Ordered peshavari macchi,gaulati kebab,Chicken reshmi tikka masala.and butter naan. The fish was bland with no hint of any spice.Gaulati was edible. The chicken tasted as something cooked in a common gravy and someone please teach them how to make naan and the quantity of butter into it.c'mon now..had I been diet conscious would have gone for the plain one. Stick with the oriental. Avoid Indian!😐

I visit Kolkata for hardly 10 days in a year and usually make it a point to dine at BBQ as it was my childhood favourite.. This place "was" my favourite and Im not visiting this place again anytime soon.. Iv had better experiences here in the past.. but this was a complete disaster..

I went to this place on a Thursday evening.. and reached early to get myself a table.. Unfortunately... these guys only let people sit on a table of four when all 4 have reached and I was kept waiting outside the restaurant even though half the restaurant was empty.. Stupid way to have a quick turnaround.. We finally got a table at the bar on the ground floor. (So don't ever think of hosting any kind of party here)

We ordered their Chinese starters including babycorn, chinese salad, dimsums and american corn all of which were horrible.. and certainly far below BBQ standards. Fortunately the north Indian mains including black daal, panner and aloo were delicious. 

Coming to the service.. The steward here was by far the most horrible steward I have ever seen in any restaurant.. Let aside having a smile on his face, his expressions made us feel like a burden at a place where we are paying for our meal... He took our order as if he's obliging us by doing so.. On the whole... the staff here behaves as if they own the place and don't need to show their guests any courtesy or respect. (Inference: Don't ever bring your guest here)

I really wanna give them a higher rating but I simply can't.. Id have given them a 1  for the overall experience but il give them a plus 1 for having good north indian chefs.

After hearing so much praise and reading such great reviews about this place, I finally got to visit this place yesterday with a couple of colleagues. Had alcohol, Golden Fried Prawn and Konjee Crispy Chicken. Food was excellent. Need to go a few more times and try out other main courses to have a better idea. But its too expensive for my liking. Alcohol specially is extremely expensive. One Thumps Up costs ₹80/-. That's too much!!! 

Ambience : 4/5
Service: 4/5
Food: 4/5
Quantity: 3/5
Value For Money: 2.5/5
Overall:3.5/5 

Will go definitely visit again and try out other dishes but will avoid alcohol and cold drinks because of their dumb prices.

A famous family restaurant in the city of joy where i have been visiting since my school days. It serves best chinese food especially their veg hakka noodles and in indian  food the best dal makhni you must have ever had in your life. The ambiance is  fine and the place is usually packed all the time especially weekends as its the best place for value of money and they don't book your table so whenever we visit there on weekends , we need to keep extra hour or so for waiting time.

One rice bowl and a chicken dish are enough in quantity for two people . A variety of drinks are available. So it's the best place at park street if you are planning  for both eating and drinking.

A lunch for two is what me and my girlfriend went for and we were all smiles at the end of it. The ambience is definitely good. As for food we ordered mixed fried rice which we loved, especially the pork in it was so well cooked. Hunan chicken was very soft and good to taste. The quantity, I would say is more than enough for two. Prices are cheaper than what we expected. Waiters and stuffs are very polite and gentle. Only negative found - we ordered sweet fresh lime soda which tasted very ordinary and didn't live up to the mark regards to food quality. On a whole, definitely worth a visit.

I went there with a friend today, the reception was warm as usual. Coming to the food, we had ordered a Mixed meat haka chowmein and Hunan chicken. Initially, our order was messed up but when we informed them, they changed it. Both the chowmein and chicken were perfectly cooked and served. The quantity served was good enough for two.For drinks we had ordered Screwdriver. The presentation was good but, seemed like they forgot to add the vodka. Overall, it lived up to its name.

I literally grew up eating chinese in bar bq. For me when i was young chinese meant bar bq..now a lot of chinese reataurants have opened up in kolkata..but very few serve good chinese food like barbq. Few days back i wnt here with my family. The atmosphere was great. For starters we tried a chickn dish which was spicy but delicious. A fish and anothr chickn dish..now ver to the main course..believe me this place serves on the best hakka noodle in kolkata according to me..i was so full i didnt try the desert..9/10 for everythng. No point stating that i will return again because obviously i will..hands down one my favourite places in kolkata to eat

If you are a Chinese fan than look no further than here. If you reach late then often you will have to wait for long to get a table. I love the dim light, service, ambiance and more importantly food given that I am not a Chinese food fan. Servings is always in good quantity and we always end up getting the leftovers packed.

I recently visited the place and loved BarBQ in terms of ambience and amazing service. Both the vegetarian and non-vegetarian food was very well-cooked and the mocktails just added the cherry on the top.  
We had ordered schezwan noodles and chilli potato in veg and were happy with the taste, though Schezwan noodles were slightly more spicy than usual. The staff was friendly enough to provide the replacement of noodles without any questions, even though we finished half, when we informed them. The Veg Hakka Noodles which was then served, were so perfectly made, thin noodles with no trace of extra oil, perfect blend of spice and veggies. 
All in all, a must go and value for money! If you are going on a weekend, you may wanna call in advance.

Located in the posh area of Park Street, Bar-B-Q is one of the legendary restaurants in Kolkata and has been serving luscious food on our every visit.

Its Crispy Chilly Baby corn is yum and best across town. Shahi Paneer and Daal Makhani were also delicious along with the assortment of breads. 

For the price charged the restaurant serves all possible varieties of food and very good quality. The hospitality is equally good. A piece of advice, make sure you have a prior booking on weekends or else be prepared for waiting queue enough to piss you off.

Me and my family gone to bar b q with one of my friends family in first week of July, we seat at table which is left from the entrance and it was corner round table. we order 1 beer and 2 Smirnoff vodka , one Pepsi and 1 fresh lime soda. the starters we are ordering it was one mushroom perpetration, one  penfriend chill fish and one chicken seekh kebab. mushroom was came so fast, pan-fried chili fish  also came so 2 starters was came before drinks, drinks came after 20 min. of ordering, so the drinks came and its came with out ice bucket,so the person gone for ice after that the drinks was served. we order another starters that is Konjee crispy lamb, it was came before the chicken seekh kebab, when we asked the manager why its taking so much time he replay the dish taking this much time. we also order main course that is Indian at the end we order. brownie which was not available. if i have to give separate rating my rating will be--- 

1. food---- 1
2. service-- .5
3. ambiance-- 1
ONE THING I LIKE TO INFORM YOU THAT THIS PLACE RUNS ONLY FOR NAME AND THE PLACE.

One of the best restaurants to have reasonably priced yet tasty Chinese food in all over Park Street. (I may be rushing to a conclusion here but so far this has to be it, given the price tag that comes along with a particular item)

My personal favorite remains the Schezuan Chicken Chowmein along with a serving of Devil's Chicken. The gravy when mixed with the noodles adds to the zesty flavor and despite the fact that both the dishes are considerably spicy, the combination in no way amplifies a particular taste but ends up complimenting each other.

You can also try the Hunan Chicken here. It is strips of chicken dipped in a preparation of herbs-peppered gravy. The chicken is cooked pretty well and you will surely enjoy your supper here, be it any time of your choosing.

Non - veg starter's 1.) golden prawn 
                                 2.) Crispy fried chili chicken
         3.)  Chicken wanton 
______________________________
 Main course is best for wings .
Singapore  chicken 
Konjee chicken 
Manchurian chicken 
Hong Kong chicken . 
Pork is not so good but sounds  tasty . that we ordered in pork is scezwan pork only 
We ordered in noodles  3 hakka chowmein and scezwan fried rice .

I know lots of people might not agree with this review but there might be a silent minority who do.Bar B Q,supposedly one of the legendary restaurants in Park Street,serving both Indian and Chinese,one of the big three which includes Peter Cat and Mocambo.

*30 minutes waiting time upstairs after being asked to wait ' a little while'.
*Ambience of a horror movie ,it is so dark ,than a fine dining restaurant.
*Little or no guidance in menu selection by the waiters and stewards who rampantly violate waiting order or disorder based on people they might know or who reward them more.
*Chimney soup which tasted like boiled water with lots of boiled stuff in it.
*Chilli fish starter claimed to be kolkata bhetki but taste wise definitely not so
*Double fried Pork which was probably fried five times it was so tough.
*Chilli Chicken was nothing better than what you get in roadside stalls
*Chicken fried rice was well chicken fried rice.

A forgettable experience.Which makes me ask a question?Can it be so that a majority of people are swayed by hype and past glory than maybe actual taste and quality of products,ambience be damned,even queue up an hour staring at diners in the corridor?

This is one of my favourite places for Chinese. I come here very often and have tried most of their dishes. The soups, starters, noodles, rice and side dishes...all are made with great care and expertise. Bar-B-Q has never given me a reason to complain quality wise although I do feel that their cocktails can be better. It's a popular restaurant for young people and adults alike...be it a family gathering or a date. The fact that it is one of the most pocket friendly Chinese eatouts in the area doesn't hurt either. A firm favourite, personally.

most of the restaurants in the park street area are too expensive for college goers and people like us who want a sumptuous bang for our buck... which is why it feels so special when Bar-B-Q hits you in your face. apparently looks extremely expensive and out of our reach cause the waiters are dressed better than you, however, over the years, i have found it to be one of the most cost effective places to dine if you are in a group of minimum 4. the food is great, the ambience better and its actually a good place to run into celebrities. a foodie's delight...

Let me apologise at the onset of this review. I am a sucker for this place. If ever asked which restaurant to serve me for my last supper its gotta be this one. Of course that would not take away anything from the others lining Park Street but sans Bar B Q, Kolkata would have been poorer. Surely. The Chinese on the menu is near perfect. Singapore Chicken being an exceptional wonderment. Try the soups on show. My fave being the traditional Chicken Sweet Corn. The mixed fried rice and chow mein are specialities which should never be missed. But if you feel Chinese is not your cuisine, gorge on the Indian stuff which is  equally fascinating. Try out Tandoor items and the sumptuous kebabs. The tawa vegetable with masala roti is a combination worth trying. Bar B Q is not just about food. Its about the culture embedded in the exercise of having food. The ambience and the service simply enhance it. So this weekend give it a visit and if you are lucky you might even find a table. Eat on the finest gourmet. Let the foodie in you celebrate.

Instead of being one of the renowned establishments they failed to appeal to our taste buds. I must mention the aesthetics of the interior is warm and comfortable and the service is average. The food was a disappointment. We ordered something as simple as egg fried rice which numbed our tongues with excess salt and kung pao chicken which tasted very flat. Unhappy.

It was my first time here with family. We came to Bar-B-Q as Peter Cat had a long waiting and boy it was brilliant!!! 
Wantons and prawn fry just stood out among starters. When we left, we were still relishing the Chicken Hakka chowmein....just on the mark!!! Just mouth watering. We also had Vegetable sweet corn soup, chilli garlic pepper chicken and fish finger along with 2 drinks. Dessert was a chocolate soufflé. Everything we ordered was good. The ambiance and service was good. Easy on pockets too as all this under 4k. Even though they have huge space, still the tables are little congested. But can't really blame them here :-) Would love to go back for the Chowmein again :)

This Restaurant needs no introduction. Every popular in Kolkata. The service and food both are decently good. The ambience is also decent enough. I have tried both North Indian and Chinese over here. You can never go wrong when you are at Bar-B-Q or Flavors of Chinese food. No matter how many times I have food here, it's never enough. My personal favorite food are mainly Red Pepper Chicken, Devils Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, Szechuan Chili Chicken, Mandarin Fish, Garlic Pepper Chicken, King Prawns in Hot Garlic Sauce, Burnt Ginger Capsicum Fried Rice. Lastly the food and fine ambiance together provide ample justification for the slightly steep prices, and I would love to come back to try out the North Indian dishes as well. Highly recommended.

You can never go wrong when you are at Bar-B-Q or Flavours of China. This restaurant has been a favourite since childhood and I often drop in whenever I'm looking for a decent Chinese. Items to order include coriander soup, sweet corn soup, pan fried chilli fish, lat mei kai, sesame chilli chicken, bar-b-a chicken. The main course is always mixed fried rice it burnt garlic rice and pan fried noodles or chilli garlic noodles. Have that with the mandarin fish (this has minced chicken as well) and you may just have a new favourite. Desert is mostly darsaan or if ordered prior, the amazing darsaan cake. 
Oh, and how can I forget the veg pulao and murgh makhni/butter chicken that I always carry out!!

I've been to this restaurant twice, once fir chinese and again for Indian. And Bar-B-Q did not disappoint me. Chinese ar Bar-B-Q has a league of its own. The food is amazing. We went for a friend's birthday treat so lots of chinese dishes were ordered, so basically i don't remember the dishes we ordered but whatever it was, our taste buds had a party. Then next we went for indian food when i wqs craving for dal makhani and chicken tikka masala. Dal makhani was just out if the world. Try it out guys, you won't be disappointed.

Of all the Chinese restaurants, Bar B Q remains my most favourite place. Have been going there since my childhood. Spent much memorable time there.
The restaurant is huge but such is its popularity that it always remain crowded. Courteous staff. Food excellent. I especially love their burnt ginger soup. Out of the world. I also love their prawn items. I have never had Indian food there, so cannot comment upon it, but Hunan chicken is an excellent melt in the mouth dish. Shall remain its patron

Visited after a gap of approximately 3 months and must say the food quality has gone down substantially off late. Even a simple dish like spring roll was half cooked and we called for replacement. 

It was a similar experience 3 months back but that time we thought it was an aberration but now it is confirmed for me. Not coming back for sure.

We ordered multiple starters, main courses and desserts. The chicken items and rice also tasted well. The price seems to be a little higher than the patent Chinese restaurants in Kolkata, but its worthy off. The location of the restaurant is also proper. Overall a beautiful place to be in and spend a good time.

After hearing so much on social network I went to Bar-B-Q (Park Street) and was so disappointed. 
Very ill mannered staffs. They imagine themselves like running "Park Hotel", but actually serving like footpath stalls. Foods were not that bad honestly but that could have been overcome by the presentation and behavior, in which they were very poor. Infact, the waiter was well behaved rather than the staff in suit.

This place never upset me. Unlike previous time this time we ordered for a indian food. In one word each and every items were excellent. Daal makhni is a must try item. Though few people are aware of it but the daal makhni is really creamy and delicious. Jeera rice and naan were tasty and perfectly cooked. Chicken reshmi butter masala and chicken tikka masala were delicious. Though famous for chinese but indian section is a hidden gem. Very polite and courteous staff. 5 on 5 for value for money. From prior experience I can say that chinese starter specially chili garlic chicken is tasty even more than drums of heaven.  Quantity of all main course items are very good. I have full faith in terms of taste ( in context of Chinese section) . This is one of the favourite place that comforts me like anything.  So I will be coming back soon :)

Recommend to reserve a table if you are planning a visit on the weekend. Minimum waiting time is at least 30-45 minutes, which can get pretty irritating for a rambling stomach. Food was good. Try out Chilli paneer in black sauce. Ambience is woody and nice but too much crowd spoils the effect. Personally I think they should restrict the entries beyond a limit.

Great location. Good food at an affordable price. Compared to the other legendary restaurants in and around Park Street, this is more of affordability compared to their quality of food. It's very very suitable for a big family gathering or you can even take your girlfriend out on your first date without money being much of an hindrance!
The staff are very polite and patient. The decor and the food is also quite impressive.
In short, a pretty decent place but not legendary. Park Street has set the standards so high!!

This is your go to restaurant if you are treating a large group of people and don't want to burn the bank without compromising on quality. The food here isn't going to stimulate your taste buds, it is just average. Neither too shabby, nor anything extraordinary. However in saying that, I must add that I find the Devil's Chicken here to be more appealing than the rest of the items on the menu. I have always found the food to be fresh since it is more or less always bustling with people. If one is not too fond of queues, then they should avoid this place on weekends and Fridays. Hope I could help. Happy dining.

Bar-B-Q......this restaurant caught my eye on day one in Kolkata, I was on my way to Mocambo with my friends, huge crowd waiting  outside the restaurant just to get in, despite of other Chinese restaurants being in the same locality. It was decided that this place need to be visited next.
You can never ask a better location than this.
I was here for lunch with my friend.
The ambience was very classic old style, and the service staff was also very polite and humble.
The size of the restaurant was really huge and it takes real experience to run such a large operation.
I  ordered for Szechuan chilli pork, konjee crispy chicken with garlic fried rice .... And food was excellent and what made the difference was the warmth of the service personnel.
Anyone who visits Kolkata should visit this legendary restaurant.

One of the best places for oriental cuisine at the busy park street area , and is sure to serve you with the some of the  best Kolkata style Chinese recipes.Portions are huge so be sure to order carefully lest you may end up carrying a 'doggy' pack more than you may  be able to handle. Priced reasonably ,the ambience, courteous staff, decor, and taste all sum up to deserve nothing less than a 4. I plan to visit them again soon.

The ambiance is classic with an old-school feel to it. The place is usually a full house with people and their voices very prominent. but then that just adds to the charm of this place.
Serves good Chinese as well as Indian and has a good collection of liquor.

For the review of this restaurant, I will share a story... I was in 2nd year of my college when I and my partner went randomly into this restaurant. Park street area, so our wallets were vexed, still we thought of doing something "Toofani" (yeah, Toofani was something as lame as that :P). We ordered one mixed fried rice and one Chicken Manchurian which we were about to share. The décor was French and they took care of every little details of the settings of the restaurant, vintage chairs and wooden staircases adorning it. 10 minutes later, we were served 1 big bowl full of fried rice and a gravy boat overwhelming with the chicken gravy. The quantity was magnanimous for two persons. Our hearts skipped beats. We thought, for sure, that the waiter had misheard us and has doubled our orders. Because even if that happened, the quantity was justifiable. Quality - Best Chinese I had till that date, and I am very picky about Chinese. We stuffed ourselves full of the food, and counted of every penny we had, as we had the economy of only one serving. I even thought of dashing to the nearest cash dispenser. Moment of truth, the bill arrived. Voilà! Single serving it was!!! We were amazed, simply. Days have passed since, and I have been here several times, never getting an opportunity to regret the decision, quality and quantity wise. I have heard negative views on many occasions, but never have I been disappointed. So, *drums rolling*, I will be happy to give it a 5 star. Don't complain. :P

The staffs could be more cordial that is my only suggestion as they look very gloomy and not at all customer friendly otherwise a sure shot place to hog..

Ambiance is like a busy famous restaurant... Not a quiet place in rush hours which you will find most of the time.. All in all they are one of the finest food station in the city.. Recommended :)

We decided to drop by this place for lunch after our exams..there were 6 of us...
The ambience is wonderful...interior is well done...it's just the kind of place one would love to visit again and again...
We ordered 2 mixed fries rice,1 kung pao chicken, 2 veg Hakka chow and one veg munchurian...the portions were generous and enough to fill our empty and extremely hungry stomach...needless to say each and every item tasted awesome
The bill amounted to 1.2k which is quite reasonable I guess..considering the quantity and quality they serve..

Being an avid Chinese food eater this place could not be missed. The food is great, the ambience is decent. A prefect place to dine with friends or family. The only problem but a major one is their lack of ability to serve quickly. The food ordered takes decades to come and once you want to order more you've to wait another century.

Went there today with my family for my birthday lunch. One of the best place I have ever been to. The staff are so well mannered and the best part apart from the food is their hospitality. They really know how to treat their customers. The interior was very classy and very much to my liking. 
Now about the food. We ordered sezwan chilli pork and chicken malai kebab for starters then for main course we had tandoori roti, butter tandoori naan, cheese naan, chicken makhani and chicken do pyaza. After this we had fresh lime soda sweet/salted. After all this the bill amount came about 1600 which in no way can I say was over priced or anything. Rather after the quality and quantity of food we had I felt this amount was absolutely justified. This place made my day. Will visit again soon.

A nice place to dine at Park Street amidst all other restaurants! The first thing should be noted is that if you are planning to visit on weekends,  better to reserve a table on your name else you're in for a long wait! Coming to the gourmet,  the place is a bar cum restaurant,  so those looking for alcohol and great food, this is the place to be! The food is very nice. Do try their Szechuan Chilli pork, it will leave you licking your fingers! The cost is very well adjusted compared to the quality of foid they provide. Although can't say the same about their alcohol menu, the price is a lot higher compared to normal bars! Still, would recommend all for a visit! Happy dining!

Well bar-b-q is a place where I would like to visit for its chinese food. Place Is well spacious.  Service is satisfactory. Price I wont say cheap but yes value for u money place. Quality n quantity of d food they serve is worth enough for d price u pay. Cant comment much about its bar section didnt go ;-) . Food for two people would cost u around 600 approx. All in all if I m in park street to hv a dinner I would surely keep it as 1 of my top priorities.

If you're looking for Indian Chinese, then this is one of the places to be at. My trip to Kolkata started off pretty well owing to this restaurant.

You usually don't have much to talk about when you go to gobble up Indian chinese food. You just eat!! At least in Kolkata, to fill your tummy you stick to the basics.

Kept it simple-Mixed noodles, Schezwan pork, Chilly pork. 
Not much to choose from the pork dishes. Loved every bit of all the three. Quantity enough and more for the two of us. Delicious enough to remember Park Street by. No half cooked or overcooked stuff.

Drinks-standard menu with standard prices.
Service good. Waiters courteous enough to explain and suggest your meal.
Ambience fascinating.
Pricing standard.

Typical Kolkata Chinese fever!!

This place is located in one of the oldest and most happening street in the city of Joy - Kolkata, Park Street. To be honest we were not up for this place at first but later when we couldn't get into Peter Cat because it was already full we entered here. The place is well lit, but you'd not see much decoration on the walls. The food is impressive. They maintain quality and hygiene which i liked. The waiters though are not much attentive. And i dunno if this happened with everyone at this place but i noticed that the tables at which they served alcohol, they served the food fast too while the tables which had normal dining orders got the least priority from the waiters. We had ordered some basic Spring Rolls for starters, which were undoubtedly the best I've ever had but they took ages to serve it. If you are visiting this place, Spring Rolls are recommended. 😊

One of the most famous restraunt in park street and my favourite too..the typical north indian food or the chinese food both are awesome cooked and serves in large quantities.Prices are reasonable and ambience is like candle light dinner..low dim lights ..the only negative part is the crowd and its noise.

They serve non-veg and veg both and the menu covers vast varieties of food for both kinds of foodies and they serve liquor also.A must place to visit if you are in park street area lookin for good food and within your budget..

Bar B Q is one of my most frequented restaurants... It offers good food in just a bit more than the reasonable price. I would not say categorically that it dint let me down ever. Recently i have been a bit disappointed on two occasions. I would recommend avoiding fish items here in.  Fish in hot garlic sauce and sweet & sour prawns were really below average. Chicken with cashewnuts and almonds were so-so. On the contrary... Boneless chilli chicken, chicken manchurian, szechuan chilli chicken were palatable. Desserts (tutti frutti, chocolate souffle) are good . And this is where i was introduced for the first time to Crispy chilli baby corn. It is really good and i would not want anyone to miss it. :) To the restaurant stuff, my suggestion would be to work on those shortcomings...

Bar B Q is on my list whenever I am in Kolkata. The ambience is appealing, food is very good and service is close to PATHETIC. Being a vegetarian, the choices are limited but still good enough. The Monchow and Hot and Sour Soup, baby corn starters are a MUST. Manchuria is average. In fried rice you must try Burnt ginger fried rice, noodles nothing great though. Location is posh! The management should really work on the service. The waiters are slow from taking the order to getting the bill! Raised my hand 4-5 times to call the manager, he saw me everytime and just walked away! It might not be your role to take orders or something but when a customer is calling, you need to attend him. The staff is really untrained, lazy and incompetent. They even go on to say, Sir aaj crowd bahut hai isliye service slow hai. You are supposed to be prepared to operate at peak periods. I never talk about service in my reviews as one can have a bad experience once in a while and I dont mind waiting am extra 5 minutes, but Bar B Q staff is one of the worst I have ever seen. My 3.5 is solely for food, location, cost and ambience. For staff its a big 0.

We ordered chiken hakka chow and devil's chicken. The hakka chow was dry with very little chicken in it . And it tasted bland Devil's chicken as they said "was the spiciest" was awfull and didn't like the taste .rather i didnot find any spice their . Though The ambience was good . But the food was not upto the standard . Waste of money !!!! @namrata dutta @sukanya roy

Though the place was crowded and we had to wait in the long queue, but trust me its totally worth the wait everytime you visit this place. The food as always was excellent along with that we should give a special mention to the outstanding service though it was heavily filled and a little chaotic.

(which is quite a few times!) In fact, I love this place so much that I have introduced my parents, my boyfriend and my university friends to this place. And none have spoken ill about here. Lunch, dinner or just snacks, just go for it and you will not regret making this choice. It may be too much to say, but I think that this is the best restaurant in Park Street.

Bar b q is one of those rare restaurants that excels in both Chinese and Indian cuisines. The kebabs just melt in your mouth. You just tend to get lost in the flavours of soft Chinese food. The darsaan with ice cream desert is the best dish to end your super good meal. Very good when visiting in big groups.

What I loved - 
They are specialised is Chinese items.
Very much pocket friendly.
Cocktails are perfectly composed.
Huge space inside , nice seating arrangements.
Food was delivered very fast although it was house full.
There are few people in this restaurant who are working here for very long time. They are very interactive with guests.

If I had to find out flaws - 
Tables for two are very small.
Mughlai/punjabi dishes are not as delicious as Chinese dishes are.

1. Sediments in water, after repeated requests , the waiter took away a glass but didn't bother to replace it with another glass. When we showed it to the waiter before we left, they were saying it must be the gravy, another said, its becoz of the jug they use for water!
2. Food- starters- pepper chilli chicken and sliced chilli pork tasted the same. Main course- waiters forgot about serving our table, so i guess when we asked when is our food coming after 20 minutes or so, looking at other tables being served who have come after us - they came up with food that was quite cold. The fried rice barbq spl which was kind of okay, the garlic fish was not hot enough and may be that's why the gravy had got so thick. the kung pao chicken served was not kung pao, when we told the waiter that kung pao chicken usually has nuts, this dish doesn't have any and we think it's not what we ordered, he just took the dish away, and returned in a minute with the dish with nuts in it, but didn't bother to do anything to the dish otherwise. The only saving grace was the pan fried noodles. Overall a very very disappointing experience.

Never tried the Indian dishes here but for chinese nothing was dissapointing.
Only thing it lacked was the ability to handle guests the first time I went here I had to leave because I had some issues that the Waiter couldn't handle well.The other times it wasn't that bad.

Be careful during the weekends and peak hours make sure you are early otherwise its too packed. Also be careful while ordering your meals specially your main course because there quantity is really alot. Good ambience with very good food.

Service was nice and when its comes to taste it was delicious 😋 felt like proper Chinese.... But the quantity was much more than what is required... We ordered only one serve for each item but except the starter we couldn't finish our main course.... Except the quantity of the food our experience was good and we would like to come to bar-b-q again...

Last Saturday we visited Bar B Q for lunch. The floor is huge and nicely decorated, the place had a fine old world charm which cannot be explained in words !For starter we ordered Drums of heaven, Golden Fried king prawn and chilly garlic pepper chicken. The portions were enough for six people .DOH was very succulent and juicy, having 6 pieces in a plate. Golden Fried Prawn was simple out of world !! A must try. I expected the Chilly Garlic Pepper chicken to be very spicy but to our surprise it had a mild taste. For the child in the group we ordered fish in white sauce and mixed hakka noodles. I managed to have a bite of fish in white sauce and it was soft and succulent and simply melted in mouth, though the taste was bland. In main course we went for Hunan Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken and mixed fried rice. I liked Kung Pao more than Hunan chicken. One plate of fried rice will be sufficient for two adults. The cost of the meal was around Rs.3,200 bucks only, so the eatery is pocket friendly also ! A must visit place for those visiting Kolkata, to feel the old world charm coupled with yummy delicacies !!!

A restaurant right up there with its neighbours on park street. This place has 2 cuisines - Indian and Chinese. Although i have had the Indian cuisine very few times i would bet my money on the Dal Makhani which is a treat to the senses. The Chinese cuisine which i most often prefer at this place is outstanding. The usual noodles, rice noodles and fried rice are sumptuous but do try out the Kung Pao Chicken and the Devil's chicken for a gastronomic extravaganza! Bon Apetit!

Be it Indian or Chinese, this place never disappoints. Service is fast, ambience is excellent and staff is well trained. Absolutely no need of recommending any dish here as anything and everything you try will be scrumptious..be it the kebobs, the naans, the dal makhanis, the paneer butter masalas, the chicken bhartas or the mutton dopiazas.
The chinese at Flavours of China (sister restaurant of Bar-b-q) is equally delectable. Quantity is more than sufficient for 2 people and the bill won't burn a whole in your pocket. A must visit restaurant if you are in the Park Street area.
PS: the only dish you might want to avoid here is the chelo kebab..its not even close to the one you get at Peter Cat.

Visited the place on a Saturday afternoon and it was very much crowded. Went for the Chinese section and the first disappointment was they said, drums of heaven will not be available. Ordered chicken wings which were pretty average. Though the main course was very nice with mixed fried rice and sweet and sour prawn. Both of the dishes are good. No special deserts available, ordered ice cream which was ok. If I visit again, will try the Indian section.

Bar-B-Q one of the finest dining in kolkata. Wether it's Chinese or North Indian is at It's best taste. I went for lunch and dinner many a times as I reviewed before also but this was time for Chinese not North Indian. From Crispy Chilli Baby corn to Fried rice everything was super delicious. We ordered Hakkah Chowmein, Munchurian, Fried Rice, Crispy Chilli BabyCorn and Spring Roll. Bar-B-Que is a place where quality and taste matter not quantity. Few Pictures are attached as you can see the best taste of the place.

As a child I used to visit this place with my parents thus felt a little nostalgic. We went for Chinese. We ordered Hakka noodles chicken fried rice Szechuan fish and kung pao chicken. The noodles and fish was very delicious. The rice was not good and the chicken was very mediocre. The portion is good. We enjoyed our visit but we expected a little more from this place.

If you'r having mood off, or some cold war type of thing with your partner or if you and your friends are sad because you are leaving your friends, then just come in this restaurant. Because you can speak and laugh loudly and openly and no one is going to care about it in the midst of that much noise there. :P ha.ha.ha You will always find this place crowdy a noisy. Lots lots and lots of people are always there. And this crowd is the proof of its good service and good food. Though there is lots of noise there always, but I always enjoy this place whenever I go there.
The Chinese and Indian both type of food is really very good and they give the main dishes like rice or noodles really in a huge quantity. The quality is obviously unquestionable. Besides these, you'll have a flavour of heritage here because of it's decor, it's ambience and it's service.
If u'r planning to have dinner outside with your family, I would like to recommend this place.

After reading the rave reviews in Zomato, I thought of giving this place a try! And its worth it. I went for the much adored nutty kung paao chicken, succulent devil's chicken and colourful bar-b-q special fried rice. The quantity was more than enough for 2 people. As for the the taste, I was blown away and I have had such great Chinese after a long long time. It was light,luscious, toothsome. The waiters are very friendly and come up with nice suggestions. The ambience is romantic and elegant. The price is cheap considering the quantity and quality. . I was a bit disappointed with the dessert though as I planned to have the chocolate soufflé which they couldn't serve. Then I asked for ice cream with brownie as an alternative and they said that its not available! That's not expected from such a sprawling restaurant, but then i choose to overlook that. Barring this, the experience was splendid! Highly recommended.

Visited there 2 days ago.It's another heritage restaurant in Park Street area.After entering into the restaurant one can feel the old Calcutta Charm.It has bar section & family section,we prefer the family section.The ambiance and decor is really awesome,just loved it.Now come to their food in starter we took Chicken Dumplings and chicken fried wanton,they are perfect for starter! In main course chicken hakka chowmin is moderate but kung pao chicken is delicious.Overall satisfying!

I've been there like about 20 times and if I start with a list of the goodies on the menu then I'm pretty sure I'm gonna lack time. So in short, this place has got items of which most have become popular favourites. The ambience is very diversified and comfortable- to go with family or friends or even the special one. 
If you're in Kolkata, this is one place that you must visit. It'll totally be worth it. Take my word for that.

I have been to this place since my high school, once they served arguably best Chinese food in the city, but over the time, I feel, they have succumbed in their own fame. As the heavy wooden cabinets are losing their polish with the time, the tastes of the foods are becoming ordinary at a faster pace. Limited options in their offerings, refusal towards the changing needs and tastes of customers, server attitude - I feel every single details needs to be precisely taken care of and now. Or else, now-a-days there are a lot of competitors in the city who all are there to build fame and name for themselves, and they won’t mind hurting the heritage.

Bar-B-Q is located park street area near Peter Cat. The most famous restaurant in the heart of he Kolkata. Bar-B-Q is one of the finest restaurants at Park st.Here The Chinese dishes are mouth watering. we have tried all most every dish out here, fav being Devils chicken, Hunan chicken , pan fried noodles, pan fried fish, hot garlic prawn, prawn balls 
.I have been going to this restaurant since my early childhood, with my parents and just like Peter Cat they have maintained their style. Bar B Que is certainly one of my favourite all time Chinese restaurants, I definitely would recommend the Chinese food. The portions they serve were amazing quantity. It's very pocket friendly and excellent tasty food......... Highly recommended

Quality and quantity at its best in very well known Park Street area. It has two sections, bar section and family section. We being a friends group took the bar section. Here waiters are a bit busy serving drinks rather than serving food timely. Drinks services were upto the mark. However we ordered chilli garlic pepper chicken in starter which was awesome. Also had naan, fried rice with hunan chicken, devils chicken and chilli chicken among which hunan chicken was the best. Enjoyed the evening more than the foods due to the ambience and long uninterrupted adda.

This is one of the very famous restaurants at Park Street, whose reputation precedes its name but honestly, over the years the fare has gone bad. There is not much to talk about its ambience, with its flowered windows and wooden staircase, this is a pretty place which serves very average food. With such prices, one can easily get way better food in Calcutta. Anyway, whenever I have been to this place, I have tried to order different kinds of dishes like- Drums of heaven, various kinds of fried rice, noodles, etc. but I have never really been very satisfied by the fare. The food was always either too dry or too oily for me. But on a brighter side, the quantity they give is really huge, which can easily fill up a couple of individuals with large-sized appetite. I wouldn’t go back to this place anymore because the Chinese scene in Calcutta has changed with the advent of high-end Gourmet places serving authentic Chinese fare at decent prices.

One of the best restaurants I've been to.
The ambience is best for a perfect dining experience. Chinese is good, so is Indian and Tandoori.
Can accommodate a huge number of diners.
The prices are reasonable, the service is quick and the waiters are suggestive.
Alcohol is served in both the family section and the hideout (bar).
Looking forward to dine here again soon. ⌒.⌒

Needs no introduction, a hot favourite of Calcuttans for decades. My third visit here was especially memorable since my sister had come to visit me in Calcutta for the first time. A glass of Antiquity Blue along with the Fried Chicken Wantons conjured up a fabulous mood. The BBQ Special Chowmein with Devil's Chicken was good too. The Sab Kham Wanton soup, which I had had on previous visits, is recomended for people who order soup. The food and crowd has always been great. So has been the service. Absolutely excellent. My dear sister too, seemed tremendously impressed. And thats when you know its good!! :-)

Before reading this review one must know that I am a bit biased as Bar-B-Q happens to be one of my favourite places in Kolkata. It has become our family tradition to have lunch from here at least one day during the pujas. I would personally recommend you to try Chinese as they excel in that but even Indian dishes are worth spending money on. My personal favourites are mixed gravy noodles and garlic paneer. My family members also enjoy their hakka noodles, chelo kebab and paranthas. I can assure you that this place will never disappoint you, be it with their ambience, their servicing or their food.

Ambience of old world rustic appearance n fine dining has wt made me fall for this place. Food is awesome Lk the best ever whether its the Chinese or the Indian fare. Still most recommended are kung pao chicken,devil chicken,wantons n in desserts chocolate fudge. Just go in and hv a great time.

I've been to Bar-B-Q about 3-4 times, and I absolutely love their Chinese. The burnt ginger fried rice, pork preparations, kung pao chicken, pan fried fish are delicious. I have a huge sweet tooth so I've tried many of their desserts too - which are very good, especially the hot chocolate fudge. The service is great, ambiance is pretty good and it's in a very prominent part of Park Street (just opposite Flury's). It offers great quality food at perfectly affordable prices. All in all, a restaurant every Calcuttan should visit atleast once.

It is one of the best places to dine in Park Street. I have been there many times. It's Chinese dishes are to die for. It serves tandoori dishes too but Chinese is its speciality. Be it fried rice or garlic chicken, it has an unique flavour which you can't find in any other places 
Definitely a must visit if you are in the Park Street area for lunch or dinner

This is one of the oldest, most popular and still most crowded restaurants in Calcutta. The quality of the food has always been amazing if not getting better with time and the waiters are at their best. Add to that the rustic interiors of the place which give you that old world feel and you have Bar-B-Q, my favourite restaurant here. This place is a must visit for me each time I come to the city. Both the Indian as well as the Chinese food is as good as each other and warrants two trips to the restaurant at the very least. The only hassle here is getting a table as no matter when you end up there the place is always full and you'll always have to wait a bit. But that hardly matters as the food is totally worth it! 

MUST TRY : 

• Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken (Spicy and YUM)
• Pan Fried Fish (I'm not particularly fond of fish but I just couldn't resist this) 
• Chicken Dumplings in Peking Sauce
• Chicken Dumplings in Lemon Butter Sauce
• Devil's Chicken (Gravy)
• Fish in White Wine Sauce (Gravy)

• Non-veg Kabab Platter (An excellent sampler of the wide variety of kababs on offer) 
• Paneer Makhani (Cashew and Cream based Gravy and my favourite!)

First of all, nice ambiance. Food, in general, is great. I will recommend the Murg Kalimirch Kabab. It is very unique in taste. But don't order the chicken dopyaza. It is so full of vegetables that you can hardly find any chicken there. The vat and service tax on the liquor is pretty high.

After a visit with my cousins to the nearby Park Street cemetery, we needed a place to satisfy our massive appetites. We zoomed into one of the highly acclaimed restaurants of Park Street, Bar-B-Q. Although it was my second visit (the first one being during Christmas '14), the one of the staff happened to remember me. A good feeling.

★ LOCATION : Bang opposite Flurys, just beside the CCD outlet. I love their entrance.

★ FOOD : I have been overwhelmed with their food on both my visits. From the starters, we tried the Red Pepper Chicken and Chicken Fried Wontons. Both were awesome, my personal preference being the former - soft chicken pieces in wonderfully balanced spice. Awestruck.

From the main course, we had Special Chicken Fried Rice and Chicken Chilly Garlic Rice teamed up with Children in Oyster Sauce and Kung Pao Chicken. The Kung Pao chicken was DELICIOUS. No wonder it is listed as a must-try dish of Bar-B-Q. :D
The quantity (per plate) was easily enough for two. The chocolate souffle which was taken as a dessert seemed pricey for its quantity, but tasted heavenly.

★ AMBIANCE : The ambiance of a fine dining place like this can never disappoint. The huge dining area has been divided into two sections which appear like mirror images of each other, which are lit by warm lights and beautiful hanging lamps.

★ SERVICE : The quick service and amazingly polite staff pull me to Bar-B-Q every time I visit Park Street.

In a nutshell, the food and fine ambiance together provide ample justification to the slightly steep prices, and I would love to come back to try out the North Indian fare as well.

Bar-B-Q happily sits in my list of favorite restaurants. :)

I and T landed here a few weeks back for lunch. The restaurant was not crowded & there were many empty tables available. After getting seated, we straightaway ordered Chicken Hakka Noodles and Tsing Hoi Chicken as the side dish. Food was served within 10 minutes. The noodles were great as usual. The Tsing Hoi Chicken felt a bit sweet which was not that much to our liking, but I guess we cant blame the chef for it, coz while ordering, we had asked them to make it less spicy. But after tasting the dish, we realised that this dish needs to be a bit spicy to balance the sweetness of it. Nevertheless, we used the red chilli paste (dont know the exact name) condiment that is kept on the tables and after adding that a little bit, the dish tasted good and we were happy with it. Service was great and the charm of the place always adds up to one's dining experience.. After about an hour, we left with happy tummies and happy pockets :)

Nothing much to say about this famous eatery in Central Kolkata.
I liked every dish that I have tried here starting from India to Chinese. But yes of course this restaurant specializes in Chinese cuisine. Other than the food the staff at this venue is very co-operative and will guide you through the best dish of your choice. The ambiance again makes you all the more hungry. The amount of food they serve is more than enough and is a lot as compared to the costs. 
Once you visit this place, you would want to go back there over and over again.
It is my all time favourite hangout with friends or family.

The ambience is really good especially supplemented by various aspects of the Chinese culture. The lights are just perfect to accentuate the tangy sublimity of Chinese food. We had The chicken rice and mixed fried rice and mixed chowmein which were all quite good and had that special aroma of freshness . As side dishes we liked the pork and the Garlic pepper chicken especially , The schezwan chicken was as usual and the unique combination of condiments in the Devil's chicken was not bad to try out. The desserts were quite the usual. The service was not quite satisfactory, however.

One of the worst restaurant in recent times in Park Street area. I wish they could bring back the cook they had may be 10 years ago, and also the people who serve the food and take orders are as pathetic as the food. 
Bar-B-Q is among one of those restaurants which clicks with the old Calcutta charm and park street but now its a complete mess. still people dine and try to love all that they have to offer.
I would give it another try in coming months and I am sure my opinion would not change completely, however I would not stick to my feedback and would give it a fresh thought. 
I started having Chinese in 
Bar-B-Q with my parents back in 1985/86 and at that time till 2001 it was one of my favourite place. I loved everything they had to offer then.

Very reasonable and it is a perfect place for celebrating any occasion if you are going in a large group. The chinese dishes are better than the indian ones.

Bar-B-Q is one such place one cannot go wrong with. I love the ambiance here, the food undoubtedly but what I absolutely love about this place is their staff; very polite, helpful, beaming smile on their faces while they serve you food. If I can't decide on where to go, I end up being here. The price is very reasonable compared to the amount of food they serve. My favourite has to be Devil chicken and kung pao chicken. The place is perfect if you want to have good Chinese food and spend some quality time with your friends.

I have visited this place numerous times (at least 5-6 times in the last year itself!), and the experience just keeps getting better and better. My every visit has involved Chinese cuisine of this restaurant and its so good I have never switched over to the Indian Cuisine. Right from the Starters to the main course, the mesmerizing chinese dishes keeps you wanting more and more. The Deserts are again superb, especially the Hot Chocolate Fudge.
The average age of the staff would be well over 30. Hence, with age comes the experience to give the perfect ambience and service. The interiors are of British Lineage.
Finally, if you are at Park Street, then this is the place not to be missed!

This is one of those few restaurants in Kolkata which needs no introducion..Bar-B-Q has been at the zenith of Kolkata Cullinary Map for many decades and still continue to do so..Needless to say this has been a family favourite and from personal experience of visiting this place countless times I have seen they actually serve both Indian and Chinese fares with equal precision and highest standards,something I have found only in a few other restaurants in Kolkata..They have a stag section in ground floor which actually serves alcohol at quite a reasonable rate..The seating arrangement in first Floor is literally HUGE!! It has 3 separate dining rooms..The servers are extremely polite and informative..Coming to food though it is known to many for its sumptous chinese spread I would prefer the Indian here and opt for Chinese at Flavours of China which belongs to same management..Some of my favourite and Highly Recommended items are:
Chicken Kalimirch Kebab: Just love it..flavours of black pepper beautifully incorporated..
Fish Peshawari Kebab: Another hugely popular dish..quality of fish is too good..
Mutton Galouti kebab: May not be known to many..but they do serve a delectable variety of this one too..
Mutton Saag. Chicken Makhani and Chocolate Souffle are also passionately recommended from my side..From the Chinese fare almost all the items are equally good,still you can opt for Devils Chicken and Sliced Chilli Pork to go with Bar-B-Q special Noodles..The portions are sufficient for two people..even at times when we are loaded with starters a single plate of noodles seemed sufficient for even 3 diners..Overall cost will be Rs.1000/- for 2..
Food: 5/5
Pricing: 4/5
Service: 4.5/5
Ambiance: 4.5/5

There are lot of nice things to mention about this restaurant. Firstly, its location in the very posh Park Street immediately puts it on the luxury dining list. Secondly, it's ambience is commendable, though the lighting might seem too low. Thirdly, the quantity of food is more than sufficient for the price. And last, but perhaps the most important, the price is reasonable for a Park Street restaurant. If you are looking for a place to eat out with your family or a date, this might be the place for you. 
I would highly recommend the Lat Me Kai chicken as an appetizer and the golden fried prawns as a side dish. Avoid the lamb if you don't like shredded meat. The sweet and sour pork is also a good and safe option for a side dish. The alcohol would seem a bit expensive because of the extra tax they levy. This is the best Chinese family restaurant in that part of town. Make sure you have a reservation if you don't want to wait!

'BAR-B-Q' is one of the popular restaurant at Park street area.Last year we went there with my friends during Durga Puja times.The ambience of this restaurant was good,they have two sections one is bar section & other is Family section.We sat on the family section.We ordered here Crispy Fried Chilli Chicken,Red pepper chicken & Drums of Heaven as a starters.In main course we have ordered here Chilli Garlic Fried Rice,Chicken Fried Rice,Chicken Chowmein with Kung Pao Chicken.Atlast we have tasted here Chocolate Souffle,Tutti Frutti & Vanilla Ice Cream with hot chocolate sauce.All items are tasty.Price was medium high.Waiters are polite.On weekend day if you go there so reserve your seat before,because many customers are in the weekend day.It is one of the oldest restaurant at Park street area.

It's a very nice place. The tables aren't very small like most Chinese restaurants. The black mushroom and chicken dish is really nice. I celebrated my birthday here and I really had a good time. The staff faculty is really polite and try to help you. The only thing I find weird is that once they see you're done eating they try to shoo you off. They simply do not want to let you stay or click pictures or sit for a while. Maybe that's because they have waiting guests but it's kinda insolent.

Bar B Q has been dominating Kolkata Food Circuit for decades. Located in the prime area of Park Street, just besides The Park Hotel, bar b q doesn't need any introduction. Be it birthday parties, family get togethers or just hanging out with friends or cousins Bar B Q has always been a favourite spot. 
The food is brilliant and has been consistent through out the years. 
The non veg kebab platter, jeera rice, yellow butter dal fry, chicken bharta and garlic nun are the only dishes I ever order and never ever get disappointed. This is my set menu out here and I don't even try to order anything else. 
Each and every dish is perfect! Once or twice I have tried their tuitti fruity ice cream but it's nothing great and can be skipped! Service is fast compared to the amount of people the staff has to serve. Price wise more than okay, much cheaper than most of the so called high end places which are cropping up in the name of good food! 
Now what I don't like about this place : The decor, very dark, it has remained like this for an eternity, the tables are also quite crammed and doesn't give you the sense of space, it's always as if someone is eavesdropping on your conversations or just giving odd looks, since they serve rather cheap alcohol once in while you get to meet some rather unruly crowd which can make you uncomfortable and lastly IT'S JUST TOO NOISY at times. Generally when I visit a restaurant I like to talk to the people with whom I am sharing a meal, screaming kids, running here and there and supremely loud chattering group of people these are the kind of crowd you get to meet once you are here, which personally diminishes my dining experience a bit. 
But food wise I have no complaints! It's just more than okay!

Value for money.I would definitly say this.Don't frown after seeing the menu card.Just order and wait(Service is  slow if its crowded).You will be happy after seeing the quantity and happier to taste the food.Pan fried noodles and golden fried king prawn are highly recommended.Kung Pao chicken is also very good but extra spicy.Take care of it while placing order.

I went there on a 31st night.. thus it was very much crowded.. decor and seating is OK.. Though its 31st , how could one take 40 mins to serve soup and then another 20min to serve starter. When our main course have arrived, by the time we were so hungry that couldn't say how was is in taste. Overall nice Chinese, but there is nothing special you would have missed if you never go to this place..

Bar-B-Q; Its one of the crowded restaurant at park street I am sure, coz whenever I dropped in here, I always had to wait. Well take this as a good point!!!
Dishes are extremely well cooked, quantity is more than enough for two. But as far as taste is concerned, I personally do not like the taste and ambience much as it is way too dark. Staff courtesy is what that makes up for the draw backs. 
Overall nothing great or new here. Can give it a try, but if you wanna go for some special occasions, then this not the right place to be. 

Thank you

Crispy chilli baby corn
King fried prawns
Konjee crispy chicken
Chilli garlic noodles
Devils chicken / Devils veg
Three mushroom curry
For Indian , do try the non veg and veg platter , the shrimp kebab and mutton seekh kebab is really really good. In the main course , garlic naan, paneer butter masala , chicken/aloo so pyaza and black dal is too good. You will love this place once you go there. It's amazing !

It is one of those restaurants in Kolkata, which needs no review. Legendary for its age old tradition of serving good food to the Calcuttans. We went there after the historical rally of 'Hok Kolorob' on 20th September. And after getting drenched like a crow in the rains, the food actually saved us. They have two options- Chinese and Indian. But we only had the option for savouring their Indian Delights. And to be exact, all the dishes were really good. Mutton Sheekh Kebab, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Peas Pulao and Chicken Butter Masala is what we had. And all of them were really good. It is highly recommended for you to visit this eatery. Even I wish to come here again and try out their Chinese delicacies. That's it. Happy Dining! :)

My friends and I decided to check out an esteemed restro in Park Street And Bar-B-Q was an excellent option. There were thirteen of us and we preferred Chinese over Indian. Amidst the general lunchtime rush in restaurants in park street, we acquired seats for ourselves within five minutes. We skipped starters, but ordered some variety in the main course: Chinese chop suey, schezwan chicken chowmein and chilly garlic fried rice. 
The chop suey was delicious and all the little pieces of shrimp, chicken and pork were really well cooked. The chowmein and fried rice had an eclectic mix of flavours and typical Mandarin spices, and perfectly blended with the chop suey. Then we ordered Veg Manchurian, Kung Pau Chicken and Devil's Chicken, the second being a bit spicy. They were really very considerate with the proportions and the gravy was so good that we found ourselves ordering one more plate. 
However, I found the service a bit poor. Moreover, the waiters weren't available at the table and had to be literally asked everytime to serve the food on the plate. Nevertheless, we had a really nice time with the perfect ambience and endless conversations over food. Overall, a very enjoyable hangout with friends especially since the place also serves liquor.

I came to Kolkata for a wedding..had a day to spare..I heard that Kolkata serves one of the best Chinese food in India..2 or 3 of my friends suggested me to try Bar B Q..so there I was. Location perfect, ambience good, food awesome, staff was very courteous and helpful and service was quick and with that I mean real quick. The place was overcrowded (we went on a sunday maybe that's why the crowd), you would have to wait for good 30 mins for a table. The only drawback was that all the people who were waiting were standing inside the restaurant and were making it very noisy for the already seated diners to enjoy their food. Maybe that's only reason for me to rate you guys a 3.5 otherwise you deserve nothing less than a 4.

A legendary Calcutta resturant.... With its unique tables (in fact our dining table has been made in the same rotating style), well dressed waiters and the old man hosting us as usual. 
The food is Chinese and you will have references to this place in books, theatres etc. Alcohol is available but you go there for the great Chinese food.. Try the konjee crispy chicken... The chicken fried rice..
Usually all the dishes are great... I remember the days when one had to wait for hours to get a table in this resturant.... Even now on weekends it's pure luck to get a table... Otherwise a great waiting game starts...

This is another glam-goddy legendary resturant at park street. And they provide fine dining and quality food at reasnable price. Other than these what keeps me going here is their specious sitting arrangements. Specially on the festive or holidays when all the resturants have long ques this have the capacity to accomodate you easily. Even if you stand in a que that's for a very puny time. 
Now the food. They serve both north indian and chinese. During my last visit we orderd crispy chilly babycorn, BBQ special nonveg mixed noodles, devils chicken.
The crispy chilly babycorn is my altime favourite, and whenever we visit this its a must order for me. The amount of crisp and spice is perfectly balanced. The noodles was really good. And devils chicken wast also okay. Quantity wise hese three dishes enough for two person. And it cost only arournd 800 bucks.
Not to mention about the ambience and service. Because Bar B Q is quiet famous for these two. And they maintain their quality like a boss.

If u want to have good and authentic Indian food in park street area which will not drive u to bankruptcy like Veda then Bar-B-Q is the place to b. It has amazing kebabs and their dal makhani and garlic nan is simply the best. One should try their non veg kebab platter and keema mator and garlic nan, yellow dal and jeera rice. Recently I tried their mutton biriyani and I was totally blown away. The rice was flavorful and aromatic and the mutton was melting in my mouth.

And wait till you ask for the bill because that'll make you love this place even more :) There are very few places that can offer you such quality food at that price, VFM is just an understatement. Nothing much to be said about its location, its located right at the heart of park street.

Bar-B Q is one of the finest quality bar come restaurant among some generation near park street area. Now one can spend the evening with his or her nearest and dearest one in here as it has an ideal place for dining. Now the menu contains various kinds of kababs, and some other dishes also. So, you gonna have a question on your mind that why I highlighted the kababs only because it is the best of here. I went with my friend and order 3 plates of kababs including of 2 plates of kali mirch murg and a reshmi kabab. The chowmin(bar-b q special we ordered) was fantastic. And the environment you have too good. So m giving it a 4 star, 2 for the kababs, 1 for the  decorative arts and rest for being pocket friendly..

So this is one of the legendary restaurants at Park street whose ambience holds that of the old English style which was quite impressive. We had Johnny walker red scotch among the drinks and chicken fried wanton and chicken biryani are the ones that we had on our plates. Wantons tasted quite yum and biryani was fine. I would like to suggest to include their service charges in the bill itself since it looks or rather sounds awkward when a waiter comes and asks for a tip from you in such a well rated legendary restaurant.

Bar-b-q is one of those places where you can have the best prepared Chinese dishes without a big hole in your pocket. Every time I look for Chinese and if I am near Park Street, I know where to go. I usually order Hot and Sour Soup, Golden Fried Prawns, Drums of Heaven, Dry Chilli Chicken, Schezwan Chow and Devil's Chicken. Every dish is perfectly cooked and will fill you up with its sumptuous taste without much cost! Amazing ^_^

Another of the old park street glam glitz restaurant... Have been to this place a ample number of times, and every time it has not only treated me better with its service and food but the ambiance seems better every time. Though it is a little taxing over the wallet, but definitely worth the money with the ambiance and food it serves. Alcohol is decently priced. Also, make sure if you are visiting the place over a weekend, make a reservation, as the place is mostly filled in as it is highly popular amidst avid food lovers. Definitely a place to visit in Kolkata if you are foodie and love to try new places. Happy Munchin :)

One of the first few restaurants in Park street that I had stepped in as a kid. Went after a while to check what it is like now. Had Indian cuisine primarily flairs of kebab with Masala Roti. tried Fish Peshawari kebab, Murg Kalimirch kebab and Tandoori Prawn. Washed it off with Gin and Tonic. Kebabs were succulent and to my liking. I found the place to be crowded with a serpentine queue through the stairs and out of the entrance.. True to its name that ends with a Q... :)  Its a test of patience before you test and taste their culinary

Great quality chinese food and a great hangout place for crowd of all age groups.

This is one of the best resturants in park street if you want to have authentic chinese food. Dont know about their Indian food as they are quite pricy so never bothered to order them. Large dining area but still it remains crowded during peak hours. 

 Coming to the food, their chinese food is too good! Both quality and quantity. 1 plate is enough for two. However quantity of the staters is less. Their pork items are one of the best in kolkata. I really like their hunan and schezwan preparations of rice, noodles and chicken. 

 Now coming to the negatives, if you are going there in a group of boyes only, then during peak hours they will allow you entry only in the stag section in ground floor. Waiting time will be very long. One other big negative is that the waiters are most of the time unattentive, you have to call for them multiple times before they respond. They wont attend you much the whole time but the moment you ask for bill they will start attending you and ask for tip. Points deducted for this. Overall a good joint for hangouts and authentic chinese food.

Quite a legendary place, Bar-B-Q is an ages old restaurant located in Park Street, just opposite to Flurys. Bar-B-Q is mostly known for its Chinese servings but also includes some North Indian preparations in the menu too. The place enjoys descent amount of footfall and is one of the best restaurants to eat in Park Street area. It is more or less crowded on weekends and festive occasions but waiting times are not so bad because of its rather large seating arrangements.

Talking about the food, we asked for Chinese menu as it looked far more convincing than the Indian menu. We took Prawn Pepper Salt and Chicken Wonton Fry for starters. We also ordered Fresh Lime Soda as refreshment. Both the dishes were served very quickly, tastes were delicious especially the Chicken Wonton Fry as it is a dish that not many restaurants prepare properly.

Moving further to the main course, we ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Garlic Pepper Chicken and Fish in Celery Wine. These main course were served in about 20 minutes or so. The Chicken Fried Rice was very awesome, very properly cooked and tasted perfect. It had good amount of chicken pieces and really enjoyed it with soy sauce. Garlic Pepper Chicken was recommended by the waiter in place of another dish we choose and must appreciate his, it turned out to be quite good. The gravy kind of tasted like oyster sauce but overall bought good taste to the dish. Fish in Celery Wine was the best in the house. Fish used were extremely soft and tender, the fish pieces just melts into mouth and the gravy was too good to have.

Pricing was very descent, in fact quite budget friendly considering prices of fine dine restaurants nowadays. The bill came to around Rs.1500 if we exclude the drinks. Quantity was overwhelming, two fried rice was more than enough for four persons and one plate each of other dishes were sufficient for a family.

Service was pretty good, the staff really helped us in getting the best table even though it was reserved. The manager kept roaming around doing his routine quality checks and waiter was really helpful in assisting us choose our order. Food was served in descent amount of times, however main course serving time could improve. Billing process was smooth and was very fast.

Ambiance of the restaurant is quite good. The place has not gone much renovations from old days and is much like I saw it four years back. They still use the same furniture, same style of decoration with Chinese calligraphy on walls and same upholstery. The seating arrangement is in a scattered manner as they have laid out the seating space in multiple areas, the biggest one is in the center. Getting a table of your choice is a bit difficult though.

Lastly, I would say its a good place to enjoy some Chinese food with family on a weekend. If you are in the Park Street area, it is not a bad choice at all. However do remember that you could be standing in long lines if you don't visit this place in a good time. They do take reservations, so using reservation feature is recommended on weekends.

This is in reference to my Take Away order number 100 for bill dated 18th April 2015., 

1) The chilly garlic pepper chicken for starters was extra salty -/ not worth speaking about!! The rest of it was nice!! 

2) coming to main course --- 
a) the Hot Garlic Chicken was Sweet Garlic Chicken!! Hated it!! As sweet as candy.. 
B) the Devil's Chicken was flat!! Horrible!! Had to use the Hot Garlic Chicken to mix with it to eat!!

Overall a very poor experience!! Not expected out of you guys!!

Devil's chicken is just too good. The chinese dishes are not overcooked yet really tasty. Even the plane chicken soup tasted so well. American chopseuy is a must try. We further decided to try on some Indian recipes and ordered Paneer Pasanda and it was just too good. One of the best panner dishes in town. We even packed bar b q special noodles for home and it was really well done. The staff is really sweet and fast. Service and ambience can't just get any better. I don't need to say anything about the food. You just need to go there and you will know. In my opinion one of the best places to offer authentic chinese dishes.

One of my favourite restaurants in town. Have been visiting this restaurant since my college days. Have spent quite a few birthdays of my life, here, so this place makes me nostalgic, every time I visit it. This is one of those legendary restaurants in Kolkata which will never grow old. Love the food here. Would rate this as the most 'value-for-money' restaurant in Park street, with Peter Cat coming a close second. The well-mannered and courteous staff, the classy ambience, the rockingly delicious food, the affordable range of good liquor, and the old-world charm of a typical Park Street restaurant....all go into the making of the magic called BBQ. I will never grow tired of this place. Menu must-haves according to me : Chicken with cashew nuts, Red pepper chicken, Veg Navratan.

I love their Singing Chicken and Pan fried noodles. There is consistency in taste and portiin size is very good. Moderately priced.  A good place for meals with family. And yes they are always full during weekends....they also have a Bar which has all good brands available. Due to the location its often a choice to dine there.

Bar-B-Q is a lively and wonderful place. I have visited this place numerous times with my sister and family. As soon as one enters the woodwork all over the place gives you a warm and cozy feeling. The staff is gracious and makes good recommendations and really make you feel special. They have a lot of variety of Chinese food along with continental dishes. The portion served is plentiful and the taste will leave you well satisfied. I love their Red Pepper chicken,Chicken Fried Wanton among starters. Their Hunan Chicken is also delicious. The Bar-B-Q Special Chowmein is really good. They serve amazing Chocolate Souffle and this is a must try among the desert they have to offer. I am literally in love with this place as it scores well both on the food and the ambiance.

Located in the heart of Park Street, this is truly a quintessential restaurant which has managed to maintain its quality over the years! The oft used aphorism "old is gold" fits aptly for this joint. It is one of the oldest eateries in Park Street and is definitely regarded as one of the trailblazers. The moment you enter this place, you are greeted by a flash of the royal bygone era of the city of joy. From the chirpy ambiance to the retro decor, everything around you takes you to a nostalgic and imperial trip.
Incidentally couple of days back, I happened to visit this place twice in a row.
My first time was on Mahavir Jayanti when fatigued and famished, five of us were hopping around Park Street looking for some place to fill our tummies and soak our throats. But most of the joints were shut down owing to the auspicious eve. With hardly any option to choose from we decided to barge into this place and man it was far from a compromise. We ordered fish finger and red pepper fish for starters which was served in no time at all. Not sure which fish they served but unlike all the restaurants in Pune this was definitely not Basa. The taste of the succulent pieces of fish finger is still afresh on my tastebuds. Even the red pepper fish was so very juicy and melted in the mouth like tiny pieces of joy.
For main course we had bar bq special fried rice and hot garlic chicken and chilli chicken for sides. I was awed by the quantity they offer not to forget about the awesome quality and decent price.
So impressed was I with this supper that I decided to treat my family for a luncheon at this place the very next day. This time I realised that there is an Indian side to this place, but we preferred to have Chinese.
There were seven of us and we shared a little of pretty much everything on the menu. Had the much hyped chello kabab for the very first time and realised that the idea of Buttered Veg/Non veg combo meals @Eatsome emanated from this Mediterranean delicacy. The prawn rice noodle, bar-b-q chicken wings, kung fa chicken etc. everything was quite palatable.
For all the foodies out there this place is a must visit.

When I lived in cal I used to visit this place way too often and loved it! Recently I went back after almost 3 years and the charm of this place is still the same. However the quality of food has unfortunately come down. Every item that we ordered somehow didn't match up to what it was like before. 
The waiters seemed somewhat disinterested. I guess they were just tired. Slightly disappointed since it used to be my favorite restaurant in park street. 
Hopefully it will get back to it old amazing self.

The name of the restaurant doesn't match the food it serves. You'll find a lot of Chinese dishes along with other continental ones. The service is slow but it is completely overshadowed by the courteous nature of the waiters and an elegant and  soothing ambiance. Coming down to the most prominent parameter that is the taste.

I accompanied by my family went to dine at Bar-B-Q at 8-40 pm . The doorman welcomed and we entered to face a bouncer like flabby looked person with a note book. I inquired whether four sits were available and he roared:'Indian or Chinese?' I replied 'Chinese'. He again roared,'go inside to register your name'. Hence I went inside and faced  a blunt who couldn't answer the approximate time, how long we had to wait. Unfortunately, we had to return without dinner. What a worst management in a legendary restaurant!!!

If you are in park street and confused as to where you want to dine, you can safely enter this place. Its one of the legends of the area. Dont expect great service coz that is always a let down. Apart from that the ambience is old school, reasonably priced, great quantity and delicious food. On my recent visit we really gorged on starters. Garlic and pepper chicken, fish fingers ( served with tartar sauce), chicken tikka, golden fried king prawn, konjee krispy lamb. Everything was delicious barring the lamb. Didnt order too much for mains coz we were stuffed. Ended up ordering chicken reshmi masala with nan and chilly chicken and mix rice. No problems with the mains. Rounded off with brownie with ice cream ( brownie was soft and warm topped with vanilla ice cream) . As always walked out very satisfied.  

P:s the place has reasonably priced drinks ( although prices have been recently hiked by approximately 15%)

Bar-b-q when I think of it brings in a lot of childhood memories. As a whole, it is impossible to count how many times I have been there. However, in recent past, I went there twice or thrice. Though I personally do not really like the concept of fusing more than one cuisine under the same roof as I believe it can never do a justification to either of the cuisines, this place somehow rise as an exception to my belief. They serve both Indian and Chinese. For the Indian, there is no question of non-authenticity and for the Chinese, I would say it serves a very much Indianised form of it. While sitting in the restaurant, the aroma of these two different cuisines keep struggling for existence but the quality of food in either of the cuisines is definitely one of the bests in the city. For the Chinese, I would say, unlike the common restaurants serving typical Indian Chinese, they know how corn flour should be used ensuring it does not claim its individual existence over the pieces of proteins or the gravies. Ambience, service and courtesy is very traditional and sophisticated.
Bar-b-q has been an integral part of the history of evolution of restaurants in Kolkata and I am sure they will carry on with the same aristocracy in future days.

Best for family or friends hangout.  Cheap but so tasty food and yes its worthy.  Best place for Lunch and dinner with a big family.  Pocket pinch -  400/- for couples will be much more than enough if u don't take any kinda drinks.  Awesome place for hangout.  Must visit.

Not much to say except that its a must go for anyone visiting Kolkata. Part of the legacy of Park Street restaurants, Bar-b-q serves some of the best Indian as well as Chinese food in the city. Reservation recommended for weekends or if you're a large group.

Delicious nd mouth watering dishes with a good quantity is wht they offers.
Whenever i visit here one item dat i compulsorily order s mixed panfried gravy noodles. No whre in kolkata i find this item so tasty. 
U dnt hve to wait long fr grabbing a seat bt yes if u do come on spcl days u ll hve to nd trust me its worth waiting here. 
Had very good experiences whenevr i visited this place.
Will b visiting more .
Thank you.

Been here on a friend's birthday. No doubt the place is nicely decorated with very well trained staffs. 
Coming to the food, one must always try their pork dishes they are all deliciously cooked. Hakka noodles and chicken chilly were normal,nothing extraordinary. I felt the pricing was a little pinch in the pocket providing the food felt ordinary to my taste buds.
The service was fast,they were nice enough to quickly set up the cake and even sang the happy song with us. 
3.5 stars for me!

Each dish was well cooked and flavoured well.For main course we ordered sliced chilly pork , chicken in garlic sauce along with veg fried rice and bar b q special chowmein just as the starters almost all dishes was pleasing to our taste buds however the garlic sauce could have been a little spicer.
The have limited non - alcoholic drinks and the waiter serving left us in the midst to answer a phone call without handing over the responsibility to someone else :(. Hence, I rate them 4.

An all time favourite! This place has prices that won't pinch your pocket even a bit when u have experienced the taste, quality and quantity of its servings. Very friendly staff. It is not the place for u if u want to have a quiet candle light dinner with your partner. The heavy footfall makes this place too busy (and a bit cacophonous too); u might have to even wait in a queue for a table to be available. All in all, a good eatery.

Kolkata is a place where people come for many reasons, its rich culture, heritage, social activities, festivals, and who can forget its love for food. Kolkata is worldly known for its food of all kinds from street foods such as its very own chaats, jhal muri, vel puri to age old traditional dishes preserved by our ladies. And also the contributions of its restaurants, bars, various food centers to serve authentic food is only simply amplifying the overall experience for the city dwellers and also those who come from various corners of the world just to taste the city of joy. One of such place is Bar-B-Q which is ravishing when it comes to its marvelous food. The menu is full with whopping items starting from starters like Chinese salad, crispy chilli baby corn, vegetable spring roles, hakka chicken etc to desserts like vanilla ice cream, chocolate soufflé, fruit salad, tutti frutti, chocolate ice cream etc. Sometimes I order only one item sometimes a plate of couple of items, depends on various occasions. But every time I go there I get fully satisfied. I love chicken and they have various chicken items so I prefer chicken prawn spring onions or chicken in garlic sauce or chicken with mushrooms and vegetables. Mandarin fish is another item which I like most. Vegetable fried rice or prawn fried rice is also my favorite that too with chicken bharta.

Bar-B-Q is located park street area near Oasis. The most famous restaurant in the heart of he Kolkata. Bar-B-Q is one of the finest restaurants at Park st.Here The Chinese dishes are mouth watering. we have tried chicken Szechuan Chow-min, Chicken Hakka Chow-min , Kung Pao Chicken , Pineapple Blossoms and deep sea Mock tails. chow-mins are so good in taste and mock-tails are so refresh mental  but i don't like their Kung pao chicken.
Overall great experience.
The ambiance of this restaurant is average, services are also too slow but the staffs are very polite and well mannered

Bar-B-Q though it also serves Indian is still one of the best destination for Chinese. Conveniently located on Park Street, the ambience is good and staff is courteous.

I visited this restaurant again for lunch on 30 December. There was huge rush and as we were a large group we sat in the hideout area on 1st floor. The items we ordered were schezwan chicken, chilli potato, pan fried chilli fish and fried wonton in starters which were the best dishes of the day. In main course we ordered mixed Hakka noodles and fried rice with Devil's chicken, Kung Pao chicken, chilli paneer which were a bit on the bland side and disappointed us. The staff were not helpful and had a rude attitude.

I have been going to Bar-B-Q since more than a decade and it has never disappointed me. Be it Chinese or Indian, they have the best of both. I am a fan of their Chinese starters, especially the Crispy Chili Baby Corn and the Chinese Salad. Though I am a vegetarian, my friends who have non-veg love this place equally. The service is fast and the entire place is very well managed. Undoubtedly, my favorite place in Calcutta.

Paradise for Chinese food lovers, I love their crispy chicken in honey sauce, and their pan fried mixed noodles. Other dishes are equally good. The quantity of food they serve is more than sufficient and extremely pocket friendly as well. Even though the place is always crowded( reservation recommended) the waiters are always very friendly and helpful, they will recommend you the best dish as per your taste. Don't expect a great ambiance, the place is congested. I like the way it is decorated, and moderately lit. Must try.

Now this place is amazing. This is by far the best Chinese restaurant ever. This place introduced me to Pan fried noodles and that has literally made my taste buds apathetic towards any other type of  noodles. 
The staff is amazing, they will always help you out and be attentive to all your needs. like, My friend wanted chopsticks and they apparently were running short of them, but yet they got her chopsticks in about 5 minutes. The service is wonderful. Although there is always a queue, yet apart from festive days the waiting time is very less. The place also has serves indian. And i have heard that it is also very good, although i keep on revisiting this place for the chinese and the bloody mary. 
All said,
 Staff and service - 5;
 decor - 4; 
ambience - 4.5;
food - 5.

I personally recommend the chilli garlic pepper chicken for those who can handle their spice and yes the bar-b-q special pan fried noodles.

If there's one place in Kolkata which serves you exquisite indian and oriental cuisine, if there is one place where everyone is cordial to you and values you, if theres one place where i have left my phone and was called to fetch it back, this is it!
BarBQ is a place where i go to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, special occasions and random days! Their food leaves a lingering experience and speaks of authenticity. The quantity served is fairly good as compared by some of the new @joints which provide you with morsels in the name of originality! A portion of roasted chilly pork and beer will make your day anyday! Prices are well balanced inspite of this place being at the heart of Park Street!

Indian and Chinese is their speciality and you would find it to be of top shelf quality. The bills might make you swell a bit but that's it. A bit...

Bar-B-Q is one of the finest restaurants at Park st. A very eminent place which has been here for ages. Bar-B-Q always remains packed with customers & during the pujas getting chaired at Bar-B-Q at the first go is of rare occurrence. A well furnished & well lighted place, Bar-B-Q can accomodate large groups. Earlier when I was a school girl I used to find the staff very friendly and engaging but on a sad note, there has been a severe change in the behaviour of the staff. They are not willing to help you with anything, they are in a rush to get you do with your dining fast & they are terribly rude at times. But when it comes to food this place has never disappointed me. I absolutely love the soups here. My other favourites include the chilli garlic pepper chicken, drums of heaven, crispy chilli baby corn, chicken fried rice, chicken szechuan chowmein, chicken hot garlic sauce,  chopsuey....the list is endless. But when it comes to desserts they have limited choices so I am not very fond of their dessert section. They charge you pretty good and it is an expensive place. Give it a shot when you are at Park st. because some places are worth giving a shot and Bar-B-Q is one such place. Bon apetit. :)

What else can be said for this joint??? It is undoubtedly the BEST place for CHINESE in KOLKATA.
I went with two of my friends for my birthday treat. We had odered DRUMS OF HEAVEN, MIXED HAKKA NOODLES, MIXED CHOPSUEY, HONEY CHICKEN and HOT CHOCOLATE FUDGE.

DRUMS OF HEAVEN was mindblowing in terms of taste. There were three types of sauce available in the table. Red one was spicy but tasty too.

CHOPSUEY and CHOWMEIN were full of eggs, shrimps,chicken and pork chunks. Quantity was apt for two people. It was probably the best hakka chowmein in kolkata. I can visit thousand more times for hakka noodles only.

In HONEY CHICKEN, chicken pieces were actually shredded. It was unusual in taste.

My friends actually wanted to try the dessert item. So we ordered hot chocolate fudge. But it was awful. It was neither hot nor fudge.
Taste and quantity wise food items. deserve 4 out of 5.

As it is a 5 star restaurant staffs, decor, ambience deserves 5 out of 5.

Overall bill was around 1000 after applying taxes. We were happy and full.

A restaurant where ambience and the legacy had taken over me more than food. The service was very cordial, but I found the food good, but not extra-ordinary.

One of the best restaurants in central Kolkata. Justifies the saying' old is gold'   be it from Hakka noodles to sahi paneer, everything is made as per the orders and served quickly. Fast service. Make sure you make a reservation in week days if you want to enjoy the food because the place is packed up most of the times.

Not up to the mark, as I expected. I ordered kebab platter, chicken biriyani, pinapple raita and fresh lime soda.
Kebabs are ok ok, Chicken in biriyani is boneless and tasteless also. Only Raita is tasty.
I would not wish to be there in future

I have been to the flavors or China section, and truth be told, it totally changed my idea about chinese cuisine. This is so totally different from the usual stale all-so-same chinatown restros.
Being a parkstreet restaurant, the ambience and decor is top of line. But at the same time the prices are reasonable.
American chopsuey and barbq special pan fried noodles are truly a foodie's delight. I have never seen so much wellcooked meat and veggies in a single noodle dish. And the quantity is sufficient for two
In starters we had lat-me-kai chicken and Singaporean chicken dish. Good enough
I had a delightful food experience!

Von-ton was alluring (one of my fav ) which i had for the first tym 
Chilly garlic noodles were extreme spicy but for spicy people it was tasty
Fried rice was indeed toothsome 
Manchurian yummy yummy luscious ☺️
The quantity for everything was huge and the presentation of it was really nice ..!!

Bar-B-Q is one of The Best Chinese restaurant in Kolkata..

Started going there with my parents when i was in class 5 or 6, now i have job and visit the place with my fiancee...Still i'm a big fan of Bar-b-q...

Ambiance: Well it has a kind of an old calcuttan vibe with yellow dimmed lights , comfortable sitting for many.... 

Food: It's absolutely delicious, and for a spicy food lover like me it's nothing less than heaven..... Even though i know that they do serve Indian food also but i personally never had Indian food here apart from Chinese.... And the Chinese dishes that they make are just Wow....
I really feel like licking my finger here only.... not at kfc...
Some of my favorites are:
Starters: Red pepper chicken, red pepper fish,  chili garlic pepper chicken, drums of heaven....
Main course: Chicken in hot garlic sauce, szechuan chili chiken, hunan chicken, devils chicken & garlic pepper chiken...
Mandarin fish, chili fish, garlic fish, fish in hot garlic sauce...
Chicken szechuan chowmien, Chili garlic noodles( all time favorite ), Chili garlic fried rice, burnt ginger capsicum fried rice, mixed fried rice etc...
Never had desert over here as every time i'm more than stuffed to have even a glass of water... As the quantity of a single dish is enough for two... and after having more than 3 4 dishes i just can't have anything else...

Service: it's very fast i never had to wait for more than 10 mins... the waiters are helpful though they seemed o drool over a girl wearing crop top... which is very typical in park street... so they shouldn't behave in such a manner...
The place is a must visit for all the food lovers in kolkata... and for me ill just keep on visiting this place as much as i can and gorge on delicious Chinese food...

"Singapore Chicken" ~ just awesome ~ crispy , juicy , spicy . Hunan Chicken also tasted good with Szechwan Chowmein (a bit spicy) . We also had Vegetable Manchurian & chicken fried rice . 

Quality , Quantity & Value for money goes hand-in-hand !

The most famous restaurant in the heart of he city and why not it maintains taste and quality and even quantity.
I have tried all items on the menu card all taste just fabulous except poke or lamb which i have never tried.
Now attendents are good well dressed,both indian and chinese food served is good but slightly costly.
Well the only well recognised chinese restaurant in the prime location serves really awesome food.
My ratings is 4 because of 1 reasons which is the menu card has less items more variety in main course is needed it just serves basic items.
i have hardly seen any change in the menu cards as far as additions of new dishes is concern but thats a different thing rates keeps on changing.
Well food fan difinately to go and keep on trying its food till you have eaten all the dishes on the menu card won't take much time though 
Highly recommended.

Serves Indian and Chinese. A place known for its huge quantity and a standard quality of food. I have only tried out the chinese section of the menu. So, my recommendations would be burnt capsicum fried rice, devil's chicken, hunan chicken. The fish preprations are as good as the chicken. Look out for the quantity. Its a real big treat for oneself. Going there with friends and family is the best idea.:-)

Each and every Calcuttan swears by this name... It's an all time favourite among each and every generation. Doesn't need any introduction.. Probably d most famous and well known restaurant in Kolkata. If u want Chinese at an affordable price, great quality,taste,  quantity and with a great ambience ur destination should b Bar-b-q. Mughlai is also available but I would suggest stick to Chinese, it's not that it's bad...but there r limited options to choose from. Must b there if u haven't yet.

The best part is that Bar-B-Q is not partial to any particular cuisine. Be it Indian or Chinese the food quality is undoubtedly one of the best you will have. The ambiance is just awesome and the customer service is just too good. The Chinese as I said is great but go for the Mughlai dishes you would be up for a treat then. And when spending the dough is concerned I will say that I have spent more  but not worthy.

Been kolkata few months back to my relative's place. Had awesome puchka and everything from the famous kolkata street.
One day they decided to go to their favorite place, I was exited.
The restaurant is on the famous Park Street, on the first floor, when i went up it was all crowded. Everyone wanted to get in. We were in a queue. I wanted to know what is o special about this place. After 15-20 Min. of wait we got our table.

Ambiance : 
Proper dim yellow lights, little crowded, Large area for sitting.. AND high class crowd..yeeeyy nice ;)

Service:
Fast and attentive.

Food : 
 I have given 4.5 to Bar-B-Q just because of its fish fingers. I have been to many places not in kolkata but many part of India. Till Now the best fish fingers I ever had. So crispy from above and juicy from inside. Whether its bay of Bengal or the restaurant, I don't know but the fish is out of the world. No smell and Boss you definitely want to visit again.!!Rest some chicken gravy, veg (didn't remember the name), all are good in taste but fish is outstanding.

Highly Recommend !!!!

Bar B Q.. went there with some friends.. the food is in good quantity at cheap price.. staff is always in hurry to the point of being rude but it's just the amount of rush these guys have to handle.. place opens up at 7 and by 8 it was full.. by my palate, don't take starters, jump to much tastier main course.. and reservation is very important if allowed, otherwise go early..

Visited this legendary restaurant after quite a few years on the eve of Durga Puja last year. Located at the foodies' paradise, Park Street, it never fails to attract people from across the city. Amid a heap of people striving to find their table, I and my girlfriend were extremely lucky to leapfrog a huge crowd and find a table for two, for lunch. Although we didn't like the loud and obnoxious atmosphere around us, we were impressed by the hospitality. We ordered Kung Pao Chicken and Devil's Chicken to accompany Hakka Noodles. Service was quick and fine amid a huge crowd. We ordered two pints of beer to conclude a decent lunch on a dull day. Ambience was nice. All in all, a pretty good experience.

Descent restaurant at Park Street which provides both Indian and Chinese food.
I have been at this place multiple times and tasted dishes like lamb manchurian, pork fried rice etc. Indian delights like mutton rogan josh , chicken bharta are also quite good except for the biriyani which is very ordinary and not upto the mark. You can have a nice set of drinks as well with the food. The price is reasonable given the location of restaurant is an awesome place itself.

Bar-B-Q..... Previously in my childhood days this restro was one of my favourites. But im very sorry to say that the last 2-3 times I've been there, it serves disappointment more than food. The service, the quality of food degraded to a whole new extent. My visit to this restaurant ended the day when the staff misbehaved with my mother, as she caught a waiter mixing two dishes of leftover rice from other table and serving it in ours. Anyone looking forward to dining in this restaurant may consider a new choice as i would definitely not recommend. Nothing more to say.

With 906 reviews and counting (this one should be the 907th one), this restaurant is easily one of the legendary restaurants that Kolkata has to offer, that too conveniently located at Park Street. Of course I have visited this restaurant uncountable times and I was surprised myself that I have not added a review yet! 

On the very first day of 2015, I was supposed to go out with few of my friends and as usual I was asked to decide where. Now the company I had for that very day was not the kind who likes to experiment with food and are traditionalists when it comes to eating out. So I had to make sure that the food is top class and there is option for both Indian and Chinese. 

I thought of playing it safe by choosing Bar B Q at Park Street as it is renowned and even if they do not deliver the best on New Years day, its quite expected as quality does take a hit on festive occasions. But I was wrong and was pleasantly surprised with the experience on that very day. 

We were a group of 7 of us including 2 kids. Upon entering the place around 2 we were told that waiting time would be 45 minutes which was expected given the rush at that point in time. It took exactly 45-50 minutes and we were seated near the bar. 

We started with Chicken tandoori, Fish Fingers, Chicken tikka kebab and chicken malai kebab and few drinks. The orders arrived at the table reasonably fast as it was fully packed. The tandoori was soft and succulent, the tikka kebab was average but the malai kebab was pretty good. The most impressive out of the appetizers were the fish fingers. Absolutely fresh and piping hot fish (pure bhetki) fingers were served to us. We liked it so much that we asked for a repeat. 

In main course we ordered chicken reshmi butter masala, chicken bharta, prawn masala and paneer butter masala. The prawn masala was the best of the lot and the prawn size was pretty decent. I liked the chicken bharta too along with tandori rotis. 

We really enjoyed our meal and since we were not expecting much, it turned out to be a very good experience. They also serve absolutely hot plates which earns them half a point extra.

Only thing that I did not like is that they charge 27% tax on alcohol which was not there before (or may be i did not notice it before) which makes the alcoholic drinks pretty costly. Otherwise I was really happy with the entire experience. Should be back again :)

This place still reels under the British Raj with an air of arrogance privy to the Angrez! It's a huge place with a warm ambience but not necessarily the warmest servers. But one needs to befriend them for the warmth to be oozing out... Once the ice is broken... We tuck into the chicken spring roll & chilly chicken. The menu is quite basic with not too many frills. For mains we order some garlic chicken & fried rice which are pretty basic... For one of the best oriental restaurants in Kolkata it's pretty average... But one must yet try it as part of the culinary experience there!

Went there on the last Sunday of the last year with my family for dinner. There is no dearth of fine dining restaurants when one is at park street yet we chose Bar-b-q owing to some amazing reviews on zomato.

The entrance is hardly noticeable. But once you step in the simple yet elegant decor welcomes you courteously. The stairs will guide u to the main restro upstairs. We obviously opted for Chinese and thus were seated on the balcony section( its kinda mezzanine floor).
Coming to food we had ordered pepper fish and crispy chilli baby corn as starters. I was so hungry I did not even care to catch a pic of the dish. The main course consisted of Chinese chopsuey, burnt garlic fried rice with capsicum, Szechwan chicken noodles and the famous kung pao chicken. We wanted to order another dish of fish as well but the waiter informed us that the we wont b able to finish everything. N quantities were literally huge. So much so that we had to pack the remnants of the Szechwan noodles. Fried rice was really good and went well with kung pao chicken. Szechwan noodles was perfect. Just the way we bengalis love chinese dishes in a desi style. The chinese chopsuey was disastrous. It had too much of vegetables n it and tasted like a stew. I dont know if its their fault or not as i have never had chinese chopsuey b4. By the end of the meal I was too filled up. I wanted some dessert but my tummy warned me n I quit sadly.
Overall a perfect place for dining out with family. Great service,great ambiance and awsum food at even greater price. We only had to pay something like 1500 bucks. Its one of the few places in park street where u'll b able to dine without burning a hole in your pocket.

Went to this place yesterday with friends.  My previous rating was 4.2 for this place but this time can only give 3.5. Main reason is service. The person who takes orders wasn't interested in taking orders; the servers seemed lost and lacked conviction.  The tables were also not organised; finding salt n pepper required more effort than getting the food. The food quality hasn't changed much but the taste now lacks the old Bar-b-q punch. The location still intrigues everyone nd so does the decor. If they take care of the service, this place still has the best Chinese in the city.

This is one of the most trademark Chinese restaurants in Park Street. Yesterday i went there with two of my friends at 2 o clock in the noon. Only a few of the tables were occupied but as expected, it soon started filling. The supervisors there quite efficiently outnumbered the waiters at the first place. It was very generous of them as they took deep interest in making their customers get settled in their seats. The decor is nothing fancy but the seats are very comfortable. Their high ceilings reminded me of the high school old London cafes
Since we had to eat veg for that day, we ordered crispy chilli babycorn as starters. For main course, we zeroed on veg fried rice, babycorn manchurian and stir fried vegetables in schezwan sauce. It was very grateful of the waiter to say that 2 portions of rice would be enough for us instead of 3. The starter was crispy and crunchy in the right balance and it was exactly what we expected of bar-b-q. They served us a sort of some hot garlic sauce which tasted like HEAVEN...!!!!The rice was hot and fresh. The manchurian was lip-smacking but the vegetables was too bland for comfort. It did not looked nor tasted like it was made in schezwan sauce. It really got us some serious puking sensations. They should stop making such dishes which are not true to their name. Its like promising biriyani and serving boiled rice.
Apart from the last memory, everything went well. The waiter stood by our table constantly to collect his tip. We paid 30 but the feeling of displeasure was quite evident from his expressions which made me put 3.5 instead of a 4.

I have been coming to Bar-b-q since I was a child. I prefer Bar-b-q for its quality, quantity and pocket friendliness.  Both the chinese and indian are equally delicious.  My favourites are Chelo Kabab, Non veg Kabab Platter, Cheese Nan, Chicken Kalimirch Kabab, Bar-b-q Special Chowmein etc  to name a few.

However there is one thing I must mention on weekends try to reach here by 12.30 to get a table with ease otherwise you might have to wait for about 20 to 25

Bar B Q is one of those restaurants which has been present for a long long time.This restaurant arguably serves the best Chinese in Park Street.The restaurant is huge,but it is never empty.You might have to wait a while if you don't have prior reservation.The decor is simple and nice.I ordered the Krispy Konjee Lamb and Lat ma kai chicken,but unfortunately the lamb was not available.The quantity is very good,and one plate of food is enough for 2 persons.The Lat ma kai chicken was exceptional.However I feel the service can be improved a little bit!Looking to visit again soon and try out their other signature dishes!

Amidst the huge crowd of the 31st Dec (2014) night, my bro-in-law took us here for the dinner. The kebabs and tandoors didn't appeal me. But yes, the chicken side dishes were new and nice! Good stock of drinks and beverages. Okay to good kinda decor and good service. I don't wanna be much judgmental because one shouldn't expect better on the last night of the year, keeping in mind the wallet factor.

Being at the heart of Park Street and at one of the prime location Bar-B-Q attracts many eyes at once and it should because it one of the best multi cuisine restaurant available. 
The ambience is cool and once you enter this place you really feel good. Good variety food and drinks are available but the price is a bit heavy on your pocket, but you'll feel that every penny well spent once you get out of this place. 
Can try out Crispy fried chilly chicken and konjee chicken.

This place is full of nostalgia. From the first time eating out with friends in Park Street to the first time have a drink, Bar B Q reminds me of so many fond memories with my near and dear ones. Even though there is nothing to mention about the ambience, but the quality of food and the service of the staffs have always been at premium to the price paid. The restaurant at such a prominent location in Park Street is really worth for money. One would never leave this place disappointed.
Try out their Chilly Garlic Pepper Chicken and Crispy Chilly chicken for starters and chicken with mushrooms and vegetables for main course.
Will visit again and again.

Great place to hang out with. Family and friends gathering in such a place would be brilliant. Lastly they provide good and fast service. The waiters are well mannered and cooperative.

Am a frequenter at Bar-B-Q...And even after 5 years,it remains as one of my favourite eateries in Kolkata.Crispy Chili baby corn is fabulous,so is the tutti frutti.Sliced chili pork and Prawn in garlic sauce are good.but Chili fish and Chicken in cashewnuts/almonds need improvements.Amount served in Chowmin and fried rice are acceptable-2 plates being enough for 3 moderate foodies.There is ample space and good sitting arrangements here for birthday celebrations and treats.Finally, the vintage atmosphere and interesting decor(the zodiac charts are worth reading) here adds to the delicious aroma of the preparations served.

One of the legendary places of Kolkata. Conveniently located in Park street it serves one of the best Chinese In Kolkata.

I especially love the Manchow Soup here. The Manchurian is also great.

I had North India food there the last time i was in Kolkata and did not enjoy it much. The Koftas, dal and kulchas were passable. 

I would recommend it only for the Chinese.

Cost For 2: Rs. 700 approx

If you are in Kolkata, and you want to have amazing Chinese (of course, the Indian version), head straight to Park Street, and get a table at Bar-B-Q. Now, that's a little difficult, getting a table. So go their with some time on your hand. Food is great, and ambience is spectacular.

Bar-B-Q is located in one of the prime vistas of The "City of Joy".Its interiors is beautifully architectured.The restaurant is very spacious and could accomodate diners in multiples of hundred but still you have to wait a lot patiently especially on sundays unless you have made a reservation.If you wish to enjoy with your group with full fervour then you should not opt for the hall with a lot of hullabaloo but for the small hall with a staircase on the second floor.

Coming to the food,i would like to reiterate what others say and that is this is one of the finest restaurants in Kolkata for chinese food.A veggie should go for  starters like crispy chilly babycorn,crispy chilly potatoes and vegetable fried wanton.For the main course,a vegetarian should go for veg hakka noodles,veg manchurian and could try chilly garlic rice.The chilly potatoes is not round potatoes as usual but is in the form of elongated strips of fried chilly potato.Vegetable fried wanton is also worth a try.These are deep fried momo pouches which can suit everyone's tastebuds as it is not spicy.Coming to the main course i would say that the veg hakka chow is one of the most luscious chowmein i have ever tasted and same goes for the huge-sized manchurians.Even the chilli garlic rice can be tried by everyone as it is not so spicy as its name usually suggests.It could be coupled with the mix sauce or the manchurian to have a good taste.You will need a pinch of salt and pepper if you are having it plain , to give it a proper taste.

Coming to the service,i would say that the service is fast but the steward delays a lot in coming to the table.He has to be called many a times to take down the order.The waiters are quite punctual and alert and come to the help whenever  they are called in and are well-mannered and neatly dressed.

My ratings are as follows:
Food-5/5
Service-4/5
Ambience-4/5
Value for money-5/5

For me the average rating of 4.3 is an understatement... 
Been to this place 100s of times since my school and college days.... The best Indian and Chinese food in town. No questions about that.

Ambience is vintage/classy but sometimes the service can be slightly hurried... 
Anytime of the day and any day of the week you will find some amount of waiting time... But the food always makes that wait worthwhile... 
Every visit to the city is incomplete without a meal at Bar-B-Q.

THE best Chinese in town. For me It'll always be Bar-b-q over Mainland China and its various lookalikes. Bar-b-q's Pan Fried Noodles is a must try. What enhances the experience is the buzz that engulfs the room! Such a happy vibe! Many will complain about the waiting time but trust me, it is much lesser than its fellow Park Street restaurants. Another plus is its huge seating area which adds to its perpetual festive feel. :)

Good food ,excellent ambience and service. The food is very good and easily among the best places to Dine out in kolkata. The place is located in the prime area of the city and is well maintained. Standard of food is very high as well as the quality. The only thing I found on the downside was the quantity or value for money. Certainly one doesn't except huge amounts like that served at Hatari,but then again when BBQ charges more ,one expects a good amount of food.
Overall a wonderful place to have food, would highly recommend this place to my friends.

OLD IS GOLD...

This is one of the oldest restaurants in Park Street. Wooden stairs, Plush interiors, Warm service,  wonderful food makes it a Wonderful restaurant... Perfect is one word to describe this restaurant. We ordered-

1. Pan Fried Chilli Fish- Succulent pieces of fish tossed in gravy on dry style.
2. Chicken Lat Mat Kai- Perfect pieces of chicken coated and fried. It seems to be a signature item here.
3. Double Fried Pork- An okay item.
4. Mixed Fried Rice- Simply wow... Handsome quantity of Pork, Chicken, Prawn and Egg.
5. Pan Fried Mixed Chowmein (Gravy Chowmein)- Good one. With handsome quantity of Pork, Chicken, Prawn and Egg.
6. Hunan Chicken- Another wow item. Low on spices and high on taste.
7. Thai Chicken- Spicy pieces of chicken tossed in red gravy in dry style. Another good item.

The quantity is good and 1 plate serves more than 2 persons. We were 6 people and the above food costed Rs 3600 which included 1 plate extra Mixed Fried Rice (3 Mixed Fried Rice and 1Chowmein lead extra 1.5 plate). Hence-

Food quality- 4.5/5
Value for money- 5/5
Service- 4/5.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.. !!!

I gave my last birthday treat to my friends here in march before the holi time. BAR-B-Q is situated right in middle of the park street. The ambiance is good. Food is very well, can claim as one of the best in city. I would suggest to prefer Chinese. 
But what descends my rating from a potential 4.5 to this is their disgusting service. They even quarreled with us for tips!! 
As it might not happen with you, you can enjoy a perfect dinner here with your family or friends with no regret after eating..:)

It is one of the must-visit restaurants of the Park Street area.

Food: Very delicious. It has ample options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians and include many interesting items like Tofu and Pakchoi. Quantity is sufficient. Noodle and rice items can be easily shared by 2. I rate it 4/5.

Ambience: It's huge and classy. The staff wears prim uniforms and the walls sport unique antique decors. Seats are comfortable and music is pleasant. I rate it 4/5.

Service: In rush hours speed is a bit low but that is compensated by the extremely cordial staff always trying to make you comfortable. I rate it 4/5.

Price: Costly but worth it.

Overall, I give it 4/5.

Went here yesterday with my best friends. The spacious, well decorated sitting areas are divided into a bar and two or probably more family dining areas. The soft lights and comfortable chairs and couches adds to the delight that touches you the moment you enter the place.

Food : The main concern for foodies like us. This restaurant serves absolutely awesome Chinese cuisine. We ordered bbq special fried rice,bbq special Hakka noodles, devil's chicken and kungpao chicken for the main course. Quantity served is sufficient for two people with good appetite. I specially loved the noodles... It was very tasty! Devil's chicken is comparatively a less spicy dish and I preferred the Kunkel kungpao chicken more. 

For dessert, we ordered chocolate soufflé. This was the first time I tried soufflé. I found it a little overpriced. 140 bucks for a tiny glass of chocolate mousse was not worth it. 

Nevertheless a good experience. :)

Okay some of the Chinese stuff is more Ludhianvi than Chinese, and the service like all other restaurants on Park street leave a lot to be desired for, but by and large this remains the better places to eat on Park street. Reasonably priced, decent grub and great location in the middle of the city!

Went here yesterday with a dear friend. Sadly she is a vegetarian and I had to take to that for a day. But, Barbq is an amazing choice for veggies out there (specially those who are into mushrooms). 
We had ordered crispy fried mushrooms and their special mushroom dim sums for starters along with fresh lime sodas.  The fried mushrooms were a delight and I would prefer them over baby corn any day. The dim sums had a very thin, translucent coating and the insides were filled with mushrooms and green onions, so soft it melted into our mouths. It came with a couple of dips, one, the traditional spicy one and the other a watery, olive oil mixed with greens. Both went well with the serving.
Next for our main course, we had ordered their Hakka noodles and Barbq special exotic veggies with oodles of mushrooms, tofu and other veggies. Tofu is not my thing though. I separated them out and enjoyed the other vegetables. The gravy was spot on with the right concentration. Went well with the noodles. 
We had a lot of both left and got them both packed for home.

It was a hearty dinner as always. Barbq is delightful.
But, I wonder if they could do something about the crowd gathered around the staircase, maybe make a waiting room of sorts downstairs if possible. It does affect the dining environment (and not in the good way, specially when you  have heads preening into what you are having for dinner!)

I love coming to this place. :)

A landmark restaurant in one of the busiest streets of the city. Bar-B-Q has been a regular spot for us. The place serves decent food both indian as well as chinese. The service is prompt and despite the continuous rush on all hours each day of the week, you wouldn't find one staff member who does not greet you woth a smile.

Having said that, what takes away from the place is its ambience.  However,  the restaurant does not have much role in it. It is mainly the guests there who add on to or take away from the ambience. Being relatively pocket friendly,  the place attracts all kinds of guests.

All in all a fair experience.  I would visit this place once in a while whrn I want to revisit my younger days spent in the city when not too many places had cropped up on each road.

Visited the place on 3rd of Dec '14. Quite spacious and comfortable seating arrangements,lovely decor! Polite staffs and quick service is a definite mention :) Coming to the food.. Good taste and quantity. Ordered Golden fried king prawns for starters ...I loved it simply :) the bar closed too soon ..so a bit unlucky there :/ Next the soup,lung fung.. Nice and thick ..followed by mixed fried rice...huge quantity for two pax! Pork with mushrooms & vegetables was prepared nicely..soft,great aroma and flavours! 
All this and not too high priced.. Lunch went well! Hope to visit again!  :)

Went there for the first time today, and I was very impressed! Their staff are great, the ambience is lovely, and most importantly, the food is just awesome. 

First, the decor. It gave me a very nostalgic feeling. It's very indian-retro style, like all the restaurants I would visit as a child, and it's not dark and stuffy like Peter Cat. The ambience is very nice. The staff were very courteous and served our food promptly. 

Going on to the main item, the food. Wow, great flavours, not just the average indian-chinese food you get everywhere. I can see why it's considered "Legendary". The Bar-B-Q special fried rice was perfectly done, with generous portions of chicken, prawn and mushrooms. The szechwan chili pork was too spicy for me, but my friend didn't seem to mind it. The flavours were great, I just found the spice overbearing. We also ordered devil's chicken, and it was just yum. It had the perfect amount of tanginess and the chicken was cooked perfectly.

Value for money is good here, since the portions they serve are quite big for the price. Two of us couldn't finish one fried rice, had to pack up half of it. Also the booze is averagely priced, nothing to complain about. 

All in all, great experience! Would definitely recommend to anyone.

Very few eateries in Kolkata offer better Value for Money than Bar-B-Q. The amount of food that they serve for the amount you pay, is just outstanding. Portions are enormous.I remember going here with a couple of friends with a very tight budget. At the end of our meal we had to pack about 30% of the food! The food itself is well above average, both the Chinese and the Indian variants.

The only thing the restaurant lacks, if anything at all, is proper ambience. The waiters aren't all too friendly, but that is open to debate. The culinary expertise balance the scale, if not tipping it in their favour.

4.5 for the excellent food, for the excellent pricing! Been here more than once, and I am sure to revisit every now and then. :)

Thanks for reading, and pardon me for any grammatical mistakes I may have made.

One more review won't add much to the goodwill of the restaurant :D
Have been here some 25-30 times, if not more. My family restaurant :D Since I prefer Chinese while my parents love Indian, somehow whenever we go out for dinner, we end up here, because there is hardly any other restaurant that serves the best of the two cuisines. (Flavours of China and Bar-B-Q) They serve the best fish fingers in the city. The soups, the fish items, especially fish in hot garlic sauce, chilly fish in wine, the pan fried chilly fish,kung pao fish, the chicken preparations, the garlic pepper chicken, chicken drumsticks, the shredded lamb preparations, the Konjee Crispy Pork, the noodles (Special mention foe the chilly garlic noodles), the rice preparations (Especially the Burnt ginger Capsicum rice)... Everything is swoonworthy! ♥ Comin to the Indian dishes, my parents swear by their Chicken Bharta, Mutton Roganjosh n Dal Makhani. And, since every time I visited, I ended up ordering the Brownie in hot chocolate sauce, I can't really say how good their other desserts are!
Ps- The only item I have ever disliked here is their chicken coriander soup which was unpleasantly bland.
Pps- I wish Flavours of China, like Bar-B-Q, was opened durin the evenings as well, since I hate giving their Pan fried chilly fish and Chocolate Brownie a miss when I visit during those hours!
Ppps- As a Bar-B-Q veteran, my advice will be to try the fish dishes rather than the chicken ones, coz even if other eateries manage to come up with good chicken-pork-Lamb dishes, the fish items here are unparallelled. :)
(And trust me, coming from a person who is not at all into fish, this is something huge :D )

It's always been one of the very favourite restaurant to enjoy lunch or dinner along the famous streets of Park Street in Kolkata. I have been to this place innumerable times and it has always been a very good experience with a delicious variety of food each time. The decor is very old world with a mix of modern charm that makes me very nostalgic. It's a great place to enjoy the company of your family and friends with excellent food that will make you visit the place again and again...

Have heard about this place from lots of people so finally we reached there yesterday. 
On the plates there were Bar-B-Q special fried rice and shredded chicken with green pepper and 330ml Carlsberg. The foods were truly delicious; perfectly cooked. 
Now coming to their services, there was always a smile on the face of the service boy from the start to the end. There was never a sign of annoyance in his face despite of calling him frequently.
For the food and the service I would give full 5 stars.
But coming to the ambience of the place, the place to too large and hence is very noisy. Sitting at your place you can clearly listen what the person sitting at the table beside you is talking about. It is not a place to spend calm, quite and private moments. So I deducted 1 star.

Bar b q is one of the oldest and a well known restaurant of calcutta! I have been a really active customer of this restaurant but it has been really disappointing in my last few visits! In my last visit the service was really poor plus I was served two non veg dishes and the rest of my order was also wrong! And today I planned to get the food home delivered so wen I called on the number given in just dial they didn't respond to me properly and gave me one after the numbers to call on claiming that they were 'busy'. They expect me to believe that they were busy at 6.00pm 
Finally when someone called Haider who is a cashier was free to talk he told me that He doesn't  have time to answer my questions  and to please  call later!
Just because it's a well known restaurant that doesn't  mean they will be having so much attitude! Pls learn customer management for future sustainability. An establishment as this is just not running because of good food and affordable pricing it would run only when customers feel welcomed after coming ! I really hope they  bring about  a change .

Been ages since I ate here...and every other time I came here in the last few years, we never got a place to sit and I am not one of them to wait endlessly to eat :)But this time I got a seat and had a guest with me and it was nice to bring back memories of old. I had forgotten that the portions are HUGE and so ended up with a doggy bag...never mind!Loved their Chinese. I have had different types of food all over the world and this restaurant certainly ticks the boxes in terms of value for money. Surely a place where one should go with their families! One of the things I always remember about Calcutta is the GREAT FOOD one can get here and Bar- B - Q is one name I will always remember!

Situated in park street,most foodies in kolkata have heard about this place and most have even been here. They say that this place has been of british origins. British or not,i truly loved being here with family. The decor,ambience,service,food each and everything was up to the mark,not from any aspect was i disappointed. They maintain the decor of any old aged restaurant with huge ceiling fans on top though they provide the facility of an ac during the summer days. Good ambience,not themed but still i felt it was upto the mark. About the food..i tried shredded lamb here which was really very delicious. The lamb meat itself being buttery,the spices and the great cooking  added to its incredible taste and odour. Fried rice was also very good. One plate is easily enough for two people with good appetite. The service was also great. With everything,i felt this place really needed a good rating from me!

Being Chinese myself I couldn't understand the appeal of BBQ and its sister restaurant Flavours. Now my opinion of them have changed slightly. I guess it's kinda like Indian restaurants abroad; kinda almost like the real thing so close enough! I think the appeal of this place is its affordability and portions. Definitely a family restaurant.

One-stop place for a quick, cheap n yummy Indian Chinese food. An old favourite for all Calcuttans. I remembr this place bein d first choice for all clg group treats. For vegetarians, their American corn pepper salt, Chinese salad, Crispy chilli baby corn is a MUST TRY. Besides that the American Chopsuey for maincourse! The Indian food is tasty too.

However, the ambience is a little on the dull side. Even then the place is always buzzing and has long queue even on Weekdays, kitty parties n clg groups durin lunch tym, families mostly during dinner time. Dropping in early before 8 or aftr 10.30 pm is recommended. Do not turn up at this place during peak time when you are starving!!

The first things that strikes you about this place is the huge amount of space that it occupies right in the center of town - Park Street!!! This is an iconic restaurant which has managed to maintain its quality over the years.

Good things first ...

Excellent Indian and Chinese food. They have a detailed menu with very good offerings to suit the palate. The quality is quite good. The service is laidback and tends to be pretty slow when the place is full. Preferably choose a seat in the main dining area since the other seating areas tend to be serviced less promptly.

Coming to the food - there are no two ways about this - the food is just yum! Be it the variety of Indian fare or the Chinese, it is a five star menu all the way. Try the crispy fried king prawns. My all time favourite. The portions are quite decent though you would need to order carefully in case you are a large group. Ensure that you order on time, since you will end of waiting for the food to arrive, esp. if the place is crowded.

For the deserts, the Tutti Frutti icecream is an all time favorite here. Go for it. For chocolate lovers, there's the chocolate brownie with ice cream. For the Chinese lovers, there's Dar Saan - which are fried noodles dipped with honey and served with Vanilla ice cream. This restaurant is a must visit if you are in Kolkata - you can never go wrong!

I look forward to going back there because I just cannot get the Devil's chicken and crispy lamb out of my head....

After a tiring day my friends and I dined over here on a thursday evening.  The place was quiet since it was not a time for dinner nor lunch,though its always crowdy otherwise. When I walked in I found the interiors simple and the atmosphere was pleasant the very 1st time I went their with my parents before many years.  The location is at the heart of the city,everyone is well known by the area park street and as this was a legendary one,it remains so,they didn't compromise with the quality nor quantity.  It has some cool and funky artwork.  They open for lunch, dinner...  We ordered red pepper fish and red pepper with garlic chicken as the starters,though I'm not so fond of fishes but recently I've started prefering fish over chicken specially from the chinese cuisine.for the main course we had chilli garlic fried and burnt ginger capsicum rice with chicken in hot garlic sauce and mandarin fish... I enjoyed everything we ordered. The food was scrumptuos,juicy and the ingrdients were well mixed. The presentation was really nice and helped to open my mind up to what I was about to enjoy.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to this one of the famous eatries in my city.  I would return and try some other things on the menu.  For the dishes  I had, I thought the prices were reasonable.  Experience was well worth it and priced well in comparison to other CHINESE places.  Cool and cozy, Bar-b-q delivered a great experience for my senses!

We started with soup - chicken coriander and veg manchow. The starters were the best part of the meal - chicken , mushroom and fish! For main course we had rice , noodles , Chilli fish and cottage cheese. The cottage cheese was more like tofu - so not very soft/ fresh. Jasmine tea went well with food. Will visit again for the spicy Chinese starters.

Went there on Saturday for lunch. We were 4 people in together, all regulars here and all have the same view. Let me tell you that the quality and taste has drastically gone down. The main course veg items like Malai Kofta and Dal Makhani were pathetic tastewise. The starter was just ok. The don't even bother to refill the onion bowl and leftovers of previous customer stays kept. he treatment by the stewards is such as if they are doing you a favour by providing you a table. Better options are available in Park Street, will not recommend....

Bar-b-que is not  really a place to go gaga about. It offers nothing but good food in a reasonable price. The ambiance is good enough but yes a bit over crowded it becomes when too many people hogs in  at the same time. Bar-b-que special chowmein, sliced chilli pork, kung pao chicken, sea food soup would be somethineg good to have at this eatery. Over all it's fine to be there just for the hunger's call.

Located at Park Street this restaurant is a must go for every foodie out there. The ambiance inside the restaurant is very good and clean. The first floor is ideal if you go there with you family members and the ground floor is where you can hang in with your friends. All the items in the menu are pretty awesome. Though my personal favorite is the sweet and sour pork in which the addition of pineapple makes it a masterpiece. The chicken, pork and other side dishes are equally tasty. The rice and noodles are also very delicious. The quantity served is more than adequate. The prices are also decent and worth the dishes they serve. So if you haven't yet visited this restaurant, buzz in there this weekend and taste the delicious dishes.

The proverb "old is gold" fits perfect for this joint. It is one of the oldest restaurants in parkstreet and is definitely regarded as one of the pioneers. The moment you enter from the entrance gate to the wooden stairs covered with squiky clean and lavish carpet will remind you of the royal bygone era of the city of joy. From the ambience to the decor it takes you to a nostalgic and imperial trip. I have been to this restaurant sereral times and till date i have never been dissapointed. According to my experience they serve the maximum amount of portion among most of the posh restaurant in the area. So if you are calorie conscious person and skeptical about the amount of portion you eat, a friendly advice just order a single plate of a respective dish and share with your companion. Now coming back to its specialities, if you have a typical pallette and loves to indulge your tastebuds with the spicy and tangy savories then these place is the best bait for you. The "daal makhani", "red pepper chicken", "masala bhetki" etc; are sure to take your breathe away and you will keep craving for more. Bar-b-q is among those place who never compromise with qualities, they still serve with the same amount of gratitude and grace as they used to in the distant past. So inorder to pamper yourself in utmost quality cuisines ranging from north indian to our fellow neighbour China, there is no other place as legendary as Bar-b-q.

For sure the most over rated restaurant in kolkata.

The taste is as ordinary as any road side rest. ( indian Chinese both )

The worst is the table arrangement, they are so closely placed, you sometimes get confused with whom u came to the rest. 

The waiters are not friendly they have a typical attitude what i have seen in old rest.

Waiter serving your table will only help rest seem to ignore you.

Kolkata is a place wit so many awesome options, i fail to understand the reason of this place being so over crowded all the time

The food is OKAY. But there's a very rude old waiter who misbehaves with guests. He jokingly passes very rude remarks and expects us to take him lightly. Insulted my colleague when we went there. I'm never going back to that place again, and I've been telling all my friends never to go there. The food is not that good to overlook such behavior.

The single eatery in park street where the entire Kolkata breaks in invariably on all of their ocassions. Off late, can't remember of any speciality and probably that is their speciality. ...they make all. If you go more than twice, you will realise that it's a factory where due to overload , restauranting doesn't remain an art any more...fill it, shut it and get moving

The Place is Standing tall since ages and is unbeatable in terms of food quality and service. Still one of the most favourite restaurant in Kolkata to visit. For any newbie a must try. This place is so famous that always to get a table ull have to wait 15-30 mins for Dinner at any day of the week.

The place is excellent when it comes to Chinese food... love to have Chinese food here with friends and families.. others cuisines are also good..
Though the atmosphere gets quite loud when its full house.. which is quite regular.. but the service is good and fast.. 
The rates are reasonable.. ideal for a large group of people visiting...

Great place to go to with your family and friends. Good ambience and service. They boast a wide selection of Indian, Nawabi and Chinese dishes. The desert segment is a bit limited though. The food quality is quite good considering the price. Will like to return here again and again.

Bar B Q happens to be my aunt's favourite Chinese restaurant after Waldorf closed down, and I have been with the family and colleagues many a times to this place.Bar B Q was and is one of the best places to have Chinese cuisine in Calcutta and in the country. Their menu may lack variety but all your regular Indian chinese items will be there and all of them are prepared in the most authentic way. The standard of cooking has been maintained over a long period of time. The ambience is good and the place is packed through the weekdays and the weekends. This is a must go for Chinese cuisine when in Calcutta, for sure.

this place used to be very nice and warm but lately the staff or the manager seemed very unfriendly and incapable of what they were supposed to doing. chicken coriander soup was  quite nice and supple... i love their konjee crispy chicken. ordering it is mandatory whenever i go there. love their fish in hot garlic sauce, hakka noddles, burnt ginger fried rice. pan fried noodles were not good as it was suppposed to be. thai chicken was not so pleasant either. moreover the serving staff seemed to be very novice at their job and created quite a mess on the table, which should not be a case when we are taking about a posh restaurant like bar-b-q. love their pina colada, fresh n cooling.  tried their cinderella which was not so good to taste it was quite bitter. chocolate brownie is nice. but the management should look after their staff or else they may lose goodwill.

This place has upped its standards over the years and I must say the crowd that it has every day, only adds leverage to that fact. Located at the heart of park street, Bar-B-Q is one of the most cost effective places to go to. This place is simple amazing in the quality of food and the ambience it provides. Chinese food here stands out compared to others. Overall I would suggest this place that you should go to with your friends or family and try some very good chinese food.

Bar-B-Q 

Kolkata, Park street area’s restaurant Bar-B-Q delicacies are simply tempting. Though the restaurant is a bit crowded, people have to wait in the cues. This proves people’s craze for the food served by the restaurant. But the moment you get the desired platter of yummy delicacies you just forget the long plight due to wait. Last time when I was in the restaurant I enjoyed thoroughly both food and the ambience. It was perfect for a family dine on weekends. For starters I ordered Chinese salad with crispy baby corn. Then comes soup, we preferred chicken coriander soup. Mixed fried rice is my favourite, with that I had chilli fish, chilli prawn and chicken in garlic sauce. All these flavours mingled with each other very well. For my little nieces and nephews I ordered mixed chowmein which they loved. It was a full meal with lots of ‘adda’. Lastly, I had chocolate sauce and diet coke. Though elders preferred Chinese tea as it was drizzling little, perfect occasion for having tea.

Beautiful ambience, delicious food and awesome service! That's Bar-B-Q.....!! Have been to this place four times and I wasn't disappointed even once. Out of all the Chinese cuisines I have experienced till date, Bar-B-Q's has to be the best! If you are a fan of Chinese cuisine just give this a try, I bet you'll have the best time of your life! It's Kung Pao chicken is one of a kind.. Another thing I HAVE to mention is that the quantity they provide is more than enough to satisfy two stomachs!

By the way they accept all kinds of "Meal passes" ;)

Its that good. 
Superb taste.
Huge quantity.
Very reasonable. 
There is nothing more that a foodie could ask for. It has a variety of options for both veg and non-veg, which is quite rare. There always tends to be more non veg options. 
The service is quick, but you might have to wait to get a table because they are always at their busiest. :)

The ambiance is great with dim light and wooden furniture which you get to see only at legendary places, old days types.. My first pork meal was here n I cant think of a better place henceforth. The food was really awesome, specially the quantity they provide as comparison to the price,  I bet no other restruant of that range comes at par with Barbq..

Their american chopsuey is the best i have had in Kolkata. Indian kababs are mouthwatering. Nice ambience. Make sure u are aware of the one way scheme of park street before u go. They are amongst the couple of restaurants in Kolkata who do not take reservations via phone. But trust me guys nd gals the wait is completely worth it

It is not very expensive either. It's a great place to go to if you want to have good food. The ambience is great. Very dimly lit. The staff is very helpful and sweet. If it is a holiday or any other day too, keep in mind that you may have to wait because it is always crowded.

The behaviour of the staff is genuinely good, regardless of the rush. The food is definitely good, especially the pork is much much better than I have had it anywhere else. Any one of the pork dishes is a must have for someone about to visit this place..... In the end, this place deserves to be in the top 5. But still there is always chance for improvement.....

Otherwise their food, ambience, service-all is at top level. Price is also at par with other restos in Park Street. So at any day for a Chinese dinner I have my faith on them.

this was my 2nd visit,  went 1st time about 2 years ago on puja, and i was really impressed that time with their food.
so,we entered this restaurant with really high expectation this time also, it was ostomi puja of 2014, luckily we don't need to wait for long.  

coming to food , we were three people , ordered one chicken hakka chowmin, (rs 165) one chicken fried rice, (rs-165) one hakka chicken for starter (rs- 249) , one hot garlic chicken ( rs- 249).

quantity wise all are very good, no matter how big foody you are,  two main dish could be easily shared  by 3 people ,

now quality, i love their chowmin and hot garlic chicken, it was really good, chowmin has enough amount of chicken , and side dish was perfect, goes well with chow. hakka chicken was ok kind of, did't like that much,, may be  we choose wrong dish,,but but buttt rice was not boiled properly, not seasoned properly, very salty , not expected at all from restaurant like BAR B Q ,

pricing- total cost 979 for three of us .. 
 
may be i expect too much from this high class park st restaurant .. or may be it was due to puja rush , somehow a little disappointed, but will visit again . :)

Bar b q requires no review for kolkatans. But for the benefit of guests to our city, heres a short review about this restraunt. The place is always (lunch or dinner, weekdays or weekends) bustling with people and the energy in the air gives a certain boost to your appetite. With plenty of options for veggies and otherwise, all itmes are good to eat.  For starters, crispy chilly babycorn, chinese bhel and tandoori paneer are benchmark dishes whose quality and taste is forever consistent. Dal makhani deserves a special mention in the main course. The chinese dishes are equally delightful to have. The quantity and quality of the dishes at the current prices makes this place a must visit with friends or family. Do take into your stride the slightly uncourteous stewards who try their level best to seat a long list of waiting people. Happy dining.

Our guys gang went there at around 7.30 pm but we were denied seats although the restaurant was empty. Then we were asked to take our seats in the lower region which was a drinking paradise, but we were in no mood to drink!! The place had no decor as such and much shabby from the top.
We ordered food, plenty of food. The waiter almost begged us to take some drinks but we declined. The quantity and taste was very good. We had ordered five plates of BBQ spcl chow n four plates of pork. There were 8 of us and we were full.
All this came at 2222.
We were disappointed as we were denied seats in the upper floor and treated poorly. But loved the food.
I would love to visit the place again only for their food.

This is an institution of a restaurant,yes. The chinese is impeccably suited to the indian taste buds and has a somewhat magisterial yet affable ambience. Nevertheless.

I had dinner or lunch at many restaurants of Park street except Bar-b-q. That's why we choose this place as our next visit after deciding not to go Peter Cat.
It was a saturday and the queue was long. We entered around the evening time.
the order was north Indian. We loved the dal makhani, fish tikka, dahi ke kabab.
the ambience was dark but cosy.
the food tastes perfect and cooked in the proper way.
the price is just compared to other restaurants around the area.
the staffs are well-versed. you can trust them for any recommendations.
the service time is 30 minutes minimum.
 Overall a place for friends and family.

I had heard about Bar-B-Q many a times, and was looking for an oppurtunity to pay a visit. And recently, that wish did come true, when I along with my college mates, decided to have our lunch there. It is situated near McDonalds, Park Street. 
The main point of attraction right from the point of entrance, for me personally was the ambience. Of all the places, I have been till now, it probably had the best ambience. Also as it was raining heavily outside, the set up was perfect for a wonderful meal.
We decided to order Chinese. In our group around 9 people, only 2 of us were non-vegetarians. 
So we decided to order a common starter which was crispy fried babycorn.
For me, it was a complete let down, although many of my friends did like it. Crispy fried babycorn is supposed to be crispy, as the name says. But unfortunately, it was everything except that.
For the main course, we had Chilli Garlic Noodles, Szechwan Noodles, Devils Chicken, and Baby Corn Manchurian.
Chilli garlic noodles is something you can't go wrong with. But they did. A thumbs down for it. But the Szechwan, on the other hand, was really good, and we did order a second helping.
The babycorn manchurian was good as was evident from the satisfied faces of my friends. 
They messed up a bit with the Devil's chicken by serving us Devil's Choice, which apparently is the vegetarian option. But they were quick to realise, and did change the dish. However, that gave us an oppurtunity to taste the vegetarian dish as well, and it wasn't upto the mark. Even though I wont be able to pin point, something certainly was wrong with that dish.
Finally, when we were served Devil's Chicken, which looked really good, we just wanted to dig in. 
Devil's Chicken was good, but not devilish. It is supposed to be spicy and hot, but well it was not. Again that's my personal taste.
We were billed around Rs.2000, which is very decent, considering the fact that its located in Park Street, which has an image of hosting costly eateries.
Overall, it was a pleasant experience.

Heard a lot about this restaurant so finally I went their with some of my friends this pujo to try out some of their delicacies. For starters we ordered hakka chicken ,fried wontons and fish fingers. We also had their non veg chimney soup .And for the mains we ordered pork chowmein , burnt ginger capsicum fried rice and for side gravy dishes we had sweet and sour pork and Mandarin fish.All the items were very good but I personally loved the pork dish. We ended our meal with caramel custard and lycee with ice cream.

It is DIFFERENT

Have eaten in many restaurants in Kolkata, but Bar B Q stands out for its good ambiance, better service and best food. Nowhere I have seen the staff to be as friendly and knowledgeable about food per se. Whenever I go to this place with family and friends alike, there will be certain items fixed in the order. Chicken Fried Rice, Chilli Chicken, Fish Fingers may sound cliche to all but the taste wont, trust me.  The restaurant is legendary and a integral part of the culinary experience one gets in the city. There might be may places that serve better, tasty food than this restaurant but when it comes to the overall experience of eating out, this place is hard to beat.

I went to bar b q on a Wednesday night with my brother and what we experienced was quite a shock. I had a reservation, and on reaching (on time) I asked for a table. The trainee manager or whoever the hell he was told me, and I quote : "do u have a lady with you?" . I said no and his reply was something I still can't digest, "then it will be difficult to place u". Lmao! I called for the senior manager and reported the same and left. It's good to be packed all the time but the staff should behave themselves and not act as if they don't care shit about guests. Highly unprofessional.

Well, undoubtedly it's quite popular among the entire Park Street chain of restraunts but wat makes it stand out is it's more affordable nd pocket friendly than its competitors in d same area. The positives of this place are 1) the food is upto the mark, though not the best available in Park Street. 2) they serve in good quantities. 2 plates of Schezwan fried rice was enuf for 3 of us. 3) it's located at one of d better places of Kolkata. Cons: 1) the place is dark nd very poorly lit. Wen we went there during d last New Year Eve, we cudnt evn differentiate between d prawn n chicken in d rice. 2) the ambience is also comparatively less preferable dan its competitors in d same area. It maybe due to d low light, I maybe wrong. 3) the service cud have been a notch better though not poor. But it deserves a visit and it's quite ideal for family Dinners.

Located in the heart of Park Street, Bar-B-que has been one of the most visited restaurants on Park Street and is undoubtedly the best Chinese restaurant in Kolkata. 
What i like most about this restaurant is that its divided into 3 sections, Indian, Chinese and Bar.
The Chinese section is the place to be-- don't bother with the others. Food is very good, but not great. Good kabobs and Chinese dishes. Service is non-existant...but hey shrug it off this is India. Btw they only have one big table, so not the best choice for big groups. Their Red Chilli Fish and Garlic Pepper Fry Chicken are sumptuous and delicious. The quality of food is very good and pricing is just above average. But it's worth every penny.

P.S. Try the konjee chicken, but ask 'em to make it a lill less hard/crispy.  Chili pork is nice n tender. Chicken noodle soup is good, should be a lill less salty.

Our go-to place for get-togethers and meetings, Bar-b-q has that homely feel to it.. Whatever the occasion, promotions, birthdays, new years, it so happens, that we rarely judge the place by the quality of its food..
Whatever the item, noodles, fried rice, chicken, fish, it all tastes good.. With so much enjoyment, food almost becomes secondary to us.. But however, do try Chinese and try to avoid Indian.. Naans and side dishes are good, but avoid Briyanis, they are horrible..
But, Bar-b-q, on the first floor, will always be in my heart for all the good times we had there..

This a place I frequently visit. Located at a great location and offering delicious food at an reasonable price. Its a huge restaurant with too many blocks.

One speciality of this restaurant is that they have separate kitchens for veg and non veg food. Many people don't know about this and so its an ideal place for pure vegetarian people also.

We ordered malai kofta, naan, mix veg, chelo kabaab as starter, and one gravy noodles.

Chinese take time but indian food came fast. Nicely done, well cooked and well presented. Very good amount of proportion. The vegetables were crisp and juicy.

Its a must visit place if you happen to be in park street area. Its better to be there on weekdays else long waiting can make your stomach full with frustrations.

Absolutely love this place. The ambience. The staff. The decor. The food. Been here with friends a couple of times.
The ambience and decor: Like the sitting arrangements. Especially the round 6-seater tables in the middle. Overall calm and nice.
The staff: Friendly. Eager to help out with the dishes in case of confusion. On the first visit, they treated us like little kids (mind you, we are graduates) which i found a bit clingy. Then onwards they were friendly and chatty.
The food: Cheap enough and YUMMM!
In my last visit, we were a group of 4 girls. Ordered starter, main course and aerated drinks. Pocket pinch 1250INR.
We ordered:
Chicken Clear Soup: Light. A bit less on salt. But nice.
Fresh Lime Soda & Coke: Lime soda was not too sweet, neither too salty. Perfect!
Chicken Rice Noodles: Light. With lots of chopped veggies.  Just as how it should be.
Chicken Schezwan Hakka Noodles: SIMPLY LOVED THIS DISH! Though schezwan, it didnt make my cry out of spicyness. I wanna order this everytime maybe!
Kung Pao Chicken: Medium spicy. Crunchy. Tastes good.
Overall experience very good. Would like to recommend this place to everyone. Cheerie!

Went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and the place was half full. It was neat and I liked the decorations. Now let me come to the food, one word it was delicious! All the items starting from the starters till desert, I really enjoyed all the Chinese dishes and to be honest it was better than many other Chinese restaurant.
Now coming to why I gave 4/5 instead of enjoying the food is the behavior of the staff. Don't get me wrong it was good but they were constantly arguing among themselves near the table related to serving or an extra menu card etc. That is kind of annoying when you are trying to enjoy such an awesome meal. I hope the restaurant takes a notice of that. Otherwise it was a good experience and I hope to visit it again soon.

This review is of personal experience. Bar-B-Q fans, kindly don’t read henceforth.

First thing first: “Chicken chelo kebab in Bar-b-q is better than peter cat”. How come??? I wonder. Why would anyone think of even comparing or maybe the cook was not in proper mood to prepare chelo kebab that day. 

“THE” best Chinese restaurant … mmmmm…. Naaahhhhh. I guess.

**********************

I went to this restaurant with three of my friends and really enjoyed the time and service but what’s the Bar-b-q’s contribution in that, let’s see.


Order was:
Chinese salad – nice. In one of the reviews it was must try. I guess other starters would serve your taste buds better than this item. 
Fried Prawns –Mashed prawn coated with corn flower is fried in shape of small balls. Taste was ok.

Red Pepper Mushroom – it was fried more than it’s required. But it was good after dipped in sauce. (Recommended)
.
Devil’s Chicken (ohh please… over hyped), Chicken Hakka Noodles (recommended), Mopu tofu (you can try) and “The” Chelo kebab … (the only Indian item we ordered for obvious reasons: P). “Omelet” was left abundantly beside two less grilled chicken kebabs sticks on proper amount of rice and less butter.  

 Now small things: yeah, being one of the oldest restaurants, it has reputation. So, if waiters don’t look at the purse while a customer gives you tip that would be more acceptable.
I think, Achieving and Maintaining quality performance are two separate things. may be place for hangout and have a drink but not for special occasions. Cheerio….

In the heart of park street beside Olypub stands Bar-B-Q. Not to confuse with Barbeque Nation of Salt lake. A school friend of mine took me to lunch at this restaurant for the first time. Along with the food, we had beer. Had chicken wings in the starters and in main course, we had prawn fried rice and schezwan chicken. All the dishes were too good, so were the waiters and the decors. Would love to pay a visit to this place with my family later. Highly recommended for Chinese food lovers...

Dis is my favourite place in park street.inspite of being placed amongst all the posh resturants,i find it quite pocket friendly.specially because of the large quantity served in a plate.(1 bowl of noodles/rice etc is quite large for 2people.)these contain ample amount of chiken/prawns etc as u order.
U can find crowd of differnt age groups here(just like we get to see in coffee house).
I personally prefer the chinese dishes here. The chiken with cashew and almonds is worth to die for.i dont knw why i fell a strong craving for the condiments on their table.:p

This place has an aura or something to it which calls you back. Its my fist dates place & thats also 1 reason to be nostalgic about this place. I could have given 5 out of 5 with my eyes closed if it wasn't for last time we went there!
 
Me n my wife went there & saw 2 seating areas near window were vacant (usually they are full) those are our fav seats, so we were thrilled to see them empty. But.. the waiter denied us those, he said they were booked, we requested/begged/bribed him but all in vain. We went that place for 15 years man!!  Then to our surprise he gave those seat to 3 ppl who arrived after 10 mins of us, till then we were convincing the damn waiter. We asked the waiter if they had reserved? he said no, but these seats are for 3-4 ppl only. Isn't that a slap on ones face? after a while the waiter seemed to get into a fight with us! really!!

Now my message to management (if only they'll bother): Restaurant is hospitality business  sirji, this isn't a place were you'll make a point by not giving a empty seat to 2 ppl by saying this is for 3, this is a business were you'll make a point when you serve with a smile & honor the request of a guest if you could. I know you'll not feel anything if you loose a few clients, but surely if this goes on.. a day will come when the footfall will make you realize there is something wrong.. n believe me it'll b too late till then. Thanks but no thanks for ruining my fav place!

They have a lot of offerings in Chinese as well as indian. Food was simply awesome. Authentic Chinese flavour. Too good. Very rarely found such perfect combination of good food along with good ambience. Ambience was very good. They have such large sitting arrangements. Perfect place to spend a quality evening with your friends and family. Very soon planing for a family get together there

Nothing to say about the food, it’s really great qualitatively and quantitatively. The food is worth the money spent. The drinks are quite cheap too and the waiters are very prompt in their service. On weekends, it’s hard to find a seat here, but one can surely wait a bit for such delightful experience.

Its worth spending bucks here. Spring roll,  crispy chill babycorn and American corn pepper salt are the best starters for the vegetarians.

Located amidst the busy Park Street, this place totally stands out for its great food (especially Chinese).
Ambience 4/5. It's crowded most of the time. I don't think prior bookings are necessary but on weekends, yes maybe.
I went there with a friend for the first time and have loved the place ever since.

On out first visit we had:
Fried Chicken Wantons for starters.
For the main course we ordered for: Chilli Garlic Noodles, Schezwan fish and Chilli Chicken.
And Fresh Lime Soda.
For dessert we ordered: Hot Chocolate Fudge.

It was great. The wantons were really crispy. We couldn't get enough of them! 😍 The fish was fresh and it melted in our mouths. The noodles were sumptuous. The Chilli Chicken was flavoured to the utmost in the chilli gravy. We were only 2 people and it was a lot of food for us.
The dessert was okayish. (maybe because we were too full after all that food 😂)

On another visit, we ordered the same Chilli Garlic Noodles. But idk I personally felt the flavours were a bit off compared to the first time we had them. 

But it was totally made up with the starter- PRAWN KA SEONG. It's a must try! So yummy! *Recommended*

We ordered the Devil's Chicken (as it was on the recommended list on Zomato). It was a bit too plain. It was supposed to be spicy but it wasn't.

The noodles was very teasty comparing the rice and the side dishes were ok. Overall a good experience.

Was thoroughly disappointed when visited Bar-B-Q for lunch today. I wanted a quick meal , so ordered a plate of chicken drumsticks for starter, one veg fried rice and one portion of plain and simple chili chicken . While I was having the starter , suddenly the waiter came and moved my side plate to place the dinner plate , I was surprised, could he not see I was still finishing my starters? I understand that the place was crowded but did not expect this from a place like this. The portion size of the fried rice and chicken was good. Was extremely disappointed with the taste of the veg fried rice though, my local roadside food stall whips up a better fried rice than this. Chicken was good though. Do not want to visit this place in near future.. u may give it a try but be prepared for the rude ness of the waiting staff.

Growing up, as a kid, Bar-b-q used to be one of my favorite restaurants, back in the late 90s/early 00s. Since I no longer live in Kolkata, I tend to eat at the place once in very 3-4 years. 
After a recent visit, I feel that the quality of the food has severely degraded. The meat is mostly boiled + thrown into a gravy before serving, the taste of quite of few dishes does not have any flavor other than spice or sour and the ambience + service reeks of a don't care attitude. Overall, I am sorry to say that the glory days of barbq are well past us. I am writing this review with a hope the management at the joint would read it and respond to it with a positive mindset.

Looking for get togethers, birthday treats, catching up on lunch? This place is the one to go. A very very popular joint for Chinese and Indian cuisine (more for the chinese as Calcuttans love chinese food more than Indian), Bar-B_Q is right across the corner in Park Street. Probably one of the most sought after joints there. Spacious (HUGEEE), well lit, good ambience, good food! Thats sums up Bar B Q for you. They have good portions of serving, so one portion of any dish(mains) can be shared amongst three people. They serve liquor too and theior tandoori items are also as delicious as their chinese items.

I have nothing bad to say about this place. Infact, I don't remember having a bad meal here, ever.

I have been there a couple of times now. If you look at the map and try to figure out this place then its a bit difficult for you. The easiest way to find this is exactly the next gate beside the McDonald in park street. Its a very small entrance so you may not notice this at all.

The decor and ambiance of the of the restaurant is really nice a bit cramped sitting arrangements. 

The chinese menu looks great. Of the non veg soups I had almost tried all of the them and none of them have disappointed me so far. Loved the wanton soup specially. On the starters I had tried the red pepper chicken, drums of chicken.

Main course, the noodles are really nice, if you are looking to have the rice items they are equally good. A small tip: if you suddenly change your mind from going chinese to muglai ask them for the north indian menu card and you will be still serves with the north indian dishes which are equally good.

Food is tasty, ambience well maintained, royal outlook, but the waiters behave badly sometimes, especially when they realise that this customer wont pay a heavy Tip. Is that a hotel management strategy? Whatever it is, food is delicious and a nice place to hang out with friends and family because the quantity of food they give is good. Built in the heart of park street, makes it a happening place for officials and college students.

One of the busiest  place in park street .  Foods are good not excellent . Chineese  menu section is better than the indian section . Kebabs are average . They have got a separate family restaurant and a bar . Service is prompt , food portions r quite large . Personally I dont prefer their family restaurant , its just ok . But if u just want to booze at some decent corner with just few friends then it may be a good place for that . Personally I do visit their bar quite often with friends  . So its for me just a regular boozing place , nothing more than that . I would never recommend this place for a date or to celebrate some occasion like b'day or anniversary  .
Costs approx 1800 to 2000 for two .

An evening with friends from Bangalore and we all decided to have some Chinese food.
Searching for a good place on park steeet ??
Thought of giving Bar-B-Q a try..

This place have a great fan following, so better get reservations on weekend.

Place is good, resto on 1st floor is huge..
But usually full. 
Food is good, portion size is pretty decent.
One can't be unsatisfied at that place.

Pricing is okayish keeping in mind the location and type of restaurant.
Only problem is hospitality..
Its not that great..

An advice: please work on hospitality. It will take you miles.

This is a place to visit for Chinese staples. I could visit the place again and again for their Chimney soup. Especially in winter months this soup is a soul warmer. Apart from that chicken drumsticks, hakka noodles and chili fish or chicken are worth a try. The space is sprawling, and as such when some other places in the vicinity have long waiting list, this is a place that can quickly seat you.

The place is fairly nice in terms of food and service. The first floor seating could accommodate our group of 20 people which i think is great! The Chinese food items were great apart from their speciality dishes. The choices of shakes and mocktails isn't that impressive, and the ambience of the place could definitely do with some improvements.

Bar-B-Q is one of those rare multicuisine places who carry out both the cuisines with equal panache. 
The Chinese fare seems to be more popular and I don't differ. It is good. The portions are good enough to share. The The chicken salt and pepper, wantons, drums of heaven, the pan fried fish are delecteble startes. I always like cantoneese noodles and it is wickedly good here. My only complaint is regarding their pork mains. Most items are gravy and they seem to coat the pork slices in some sort of batter which is weird.
If you are not trying their indian dishes then you are missing out for sure. They have separate seating area for you if you want to have indian. The kebabs are out of this world!! It's a work of art!! The chicken reshmi kebab is my favourite. It so delicately spiced and will just melt in your mouth. The gravies are good too and I hve to say veg dishes taste better than the non veg ones which is something. 
The ambience reminds me of the old gentlemens club that you read in books. Wood stairs and wood flooring. Fake windows. Wooden banisters. Large woodframed glass windows. Add to that super courteous stuff who makes you feel really special. Once a fried of mine had the sudden whim of eating his Chinese with chopstick and the manager actually got him a pair although my guess is they did not have one ready. 
About 4-5 years back on a visit I noticed that they had chicken chelo kebab on their menu and I ordered one. It was mindblowing!! About 10times better than Peter Cat which is something!! The seekh was super juicy and the skewered kebab was much more generous. I wonder if they still serve that. Will have to find out soon.

We planned to attend the buffet at Tung Fong,But after missing out for being late decided to come here and later that turned out to be a great decision.

We had Chicken Malai Kebab as starter.It was really awesome.
Then we had Bar-B-Q Special Chowmein along with Sliced Chilli Pork. Both the items were great,specially the noodles was one of the best hakka i had till date.
And all this while fresh lime soda was our constant companion.
Overall we had a great meal and unfortunately we were too full for dessert.
Next time we would not miss the dessert for sure.

One of the oldest restrau in Kolkata.. and undoubtedly have been legendary. The staff is highly cooperative. The food is a delight. Ambiance cannot be judged as there's a lot of hustle bustle as it is more than full most of the time. To get a table 15-20 mins waiting is normal on any day. Reservation facility is not allowed. The Devil's Choice here is the best in the city and also the unique sauce available here called the *surprise sauce*. The place gets a thumps up for food specially chinese. Besides the place is reasonably priced, very rare to this location and the quantity served. A must visit!

The one place which almost every Calcuttan thinks about as soon as you mention Chinese is BarBQ. Probably one of the oldest restaurants around and located right in the middle of Park Street. They serve some of the best food out there, service is fast and there is not much of a waiting line even at rush hour, unless you visit during the weekend.

There is only one gripe and because of this I have lowered my rating, its the lighting of the restaurant, it is dimly lit and that is a big problem. Another major issue is that I have had to swat away a couple of roaches from the table, that is something that does leave a lot to be imagined about the hygiene of the restaurant.

Prices are pretty economical if you consider you are eating at Park Street, a dinner for two can easily be done in Rs 600 (without any drinks). A lot of great memories are linked with this restaurant and I still do visit it even if I can't often read the menu due to the lighting.

Whether you went there 20 years ago or you went yesterday, you wouldn't have felt the difference. It's the same light on pocket exquisite food which everyone wants to savour. I never get a table sadly unless I go there at 7pm and you get parking on Park Street. Chinese/Indian both are unparalleled.

You know what take your time to order and eat, else you will find food on your table before the menu has also been removed. Rotation and turnover is what they believe in. 

They have some bonding with balloons, they have been there since time immemorial.

Perhaps many people will disagree, but for me, BARBQ serves a better Chelo Kebab than Peter Cat.
Go ahead shoot me. But this is my honest opinion.
Okay, stubbornness aside, perhaps barbq may even surpass the (over-hyped) Mainland China chain when it comes to AUTHENTIC chinese food. 
Barbq is not a place where I'd like to go and chill. Its a place which I keep visiting, mostly with my parents, when I am in mood for REAL GOOD FOOD.
The service is great. Indian food is good too. But its the Chelo that simply wins me over every single time.

One of the oldest yet popular and running strong with head held high is Bar-B-Q in Park Street. Never Have I been disappointed at this joint. A family favorite I must add. Their Restaurant is huge in term of space, divided in three parts one one floor and few other family dining places in the ground floor(never visited there). Be sure to sit in the first chamber for Chinese , the middle one for Indian and the last one if space is already filled up in the first two! ( by first i mean the chamber whose door and staircase is closer to oly pub). Now, my favorite is the Chinese they serve their, but i had Indian once and it was equally appreciable. All their non-veg soups are tried and tasted by me and i certify all to be wholesome and excellent to taste!Their Bar-b-q special Noodles (pan fried) is great! Even their Cantonese styled mixed noodles is good. My sister is die-heart fan of their American Chopsuey!Kung Pao and Devil's chicken is an all time favorite! Chicken in the regular machurians and hot garlics and chilli sauces are also good.Without a second doubt, you can indulge in the fish and prawn items here, they are not only hygenic and fresh but yummy to taste. The sweet and sour fish and king prawns in any sauce is my choice!Sliced chili pork is the only i ordered from their menu (pork items) and it was well-done.I visited this place with my friends for drinks and starters too and they didn't complaint about the price either before or after the you-know-state!!A recommendation from my end, if you are still to go....

Situated at a very convenient  location at the heart of Calcutta, this place is worth hanging out both with your best friends and with your family. 
The ambiance is family-like (1st Floor) and flawlessly suited for chilling with your buddies (Ground Floor). The staffs here possess an amicable nature and shall render you an equally pleasant service. 
Coming to the quality of the dishes served, the best of the lot are the pork dishes. The pineapple, one of the ingredients of the "Sweet & Sour Pork", not only enriches the flavour of the said dish, but also elevates it to a new height. The rice dishes are as equally savoury as the chowmein dishes. The big size of the bowls, in which the dishes are served, speaks a volume about the quantity. 
Overall, the place is neat and clean (or maybe more than that, which I find a bit difficult to delineate with my limited English vocab)  to stop by and tickle your taste buds alongwith your family/buddies.

Located just a little bit down Park Street from the metro station. Extremely spacious, strong AC, a huge variety of foods available. One of the best crispy chilly baby corn and chicken tandoori I've had. Cost is just a tad bit on the expensive side though. We joked about the guy in charge there because he sort of resembled Vladimir Putin. :P

Edit: went for a second time, tried their special fried rice and chicken manchurian, and tutti frooti alongside the all time favourite crispy chilli babycorn. Waiters are responsive and helpful and basically everything tastes good and I can say many dishes are quite value for money as well compared to most high end restaurants. Though we had to wait for around 20 mins before we got a seat in the afternoon on a saturday.

Went for the third time on Saptami this year, got a table within a 5 minutes and I was DELIGHTED to be returning to BBQ again and again.

A good place which is overstaffed with greedy people. ... just a no for from me. .

If you want to have some authentic Chinese in upmarket streets of Kolkata, there's nothing like it. The best part, you also have North Indian food section (allowing you a combined seating) which lets you go along with those who like to have either of them. 

You get good options for hard drinks and mocktails. The place is really comfortable and has the right piece of interior to keep you amused. Hospitality is quite okay. The only thing you wouldn't like is the queues which can make you wait for long - and all that with good smell of food all over the ambiance. Hard to resist!

been here during the most busiest day in kolkata, it was durga navami and been here with my friends.. it was a long wait for seats but finally was greeted well and placed in a nice place... looking at the menu it was not pocket friendly for a 1st year student, but when the food came on to our table it was worth paying... the quantity and quality was balanced within that price tag.. the option of serving alcohol is good but being a 20 year old  i was surprised for not being asked for any age proof moreover my girlfriend who was 17 at that time was served alcohol without any hesitation.... keeping aside the alcohol serving part the place gives a nice ambiance with the park street's street light coming from outside and making you realize the buzz of the city.. the food is awesome and the service is average... overall a must visit place with family and friends

This is one place which I had always skipped, not really sure why. Perhaps because the menu did not seem to offer any thing out of the book(I do have a fetish for the exotic, but that's a different story, maybe some other time). Perhaps because when I went past this place the exterior did not really seem enticing. 
Five days back, I decided to give this long skipped yet widely appreciated place a visit for reasons obvious. Why, of course, my birthday treat! 
The decor of the place was pleasing.  Seating arrangements comfortable. 
We ordered : 
1. Drums of heaven 
2. Crispy chilly mushroom 
3. Prawn Rice Noodles 
4. Maoshi Chicken 
5. Schezwan Chicken 
6. Vegetable Manchurian 
7. Tsing hoi Chicken 
The food was good. Tasty. In large amounts. The trio of things you want if you are giving a treat to a big number of hungry people after an exhausting day of college. 

The only draw back I suppose was the serving, wherein we were served all the food at once. That's something, which I suppose could have been better handled. Apart from that it was a great day.

Ambience: 4/5, nicely done up decor, simple and elegant. 
Service: 5/5, have visited the place so many times, the staff is very friendly and attentive.
Food: 4.5/5, the food each time is exactly the same... maintains standard. Veg and non-veg are equally good. Some of the dishes worth trying are chicken lollipop, chinese salad. The restaurant is either running in full capacity or there is waiting irrespective of the day or time. This says a lot about the place and the food it offers. The restaurant seems to be working like a machine, serving the order never takes much time and food will taste the same as you remember from the last time, each time.  Everytime I am in the city this is on the wishlist again and again! Apart from the chinese, this restaurant is worth a visit even for the North Indian Food.
Value for Money: 5/5 serving a great food at below expectation prices!

Park Street being a foodie's perfect destination has BBQ located just in the heart of it. It is standing tall in all the eat outs at PS. The decor is just lovely in retro style, its spacious, and you would have no problem in breathing, even when it is housefull. This one is immensely spacious. I love the seat by the side of the big window where you can view the busy Park Street and enjoy your meal.
Now coming to the meal, I have tried both their chinese and indian, they are satisfying, in no way extraordinary, but yes definitely well acceptable.
I would not say the price is pocket friendly, but looking at the ambience they offer, I don't mind paying for it reasonably once in a while.

Whenever I am thinking to go park Street and have a lunch or dinner, the first restaurant comes in my mind is BAR-B-Q...I had been there for numerous times.. the positive points of this restaurant is food available throughout the day, ambience is pretty good, reception is best in its class, it's so cheap that it can even beat your local restaurants.... the food is delicious and comes in a huge bowl.. It's really tough to finish it off even for two.. and final thing whenever you visit this place please not try to experiment of taking Indian dishes..

Some places stand testimonies to time, to cultures and to good memories over the years.
One such place has always been Bar-B-Q. The food,  the cosy decor, and the prices are all reasons Calcutta simply cannot have enough of this place. 
Booked to the brim every single night, it simply never fails to surprise a connoisseur or a first timer alike.

A platform for the biggest celebrations to the most frequent get-together, Park Street owes a lot of its celebrated charm to this joint.

In a melee of legendary restaurants lined up in this stretch of the town, Bar-b-q makes its presence felt by serving up delectable Chinese and Indian platter over the years.  One can not just anticipate the ample dining space it provides by gauging this eatery from outside.
After a courteous welcome, one will definitely find this place to be oozing in elitism.  The constant buzz, the aroma of food, the graceful interior all add into that. Coming into the food platter, it at the same time fabulous and well suited for your tummy. 
Although they offer both north Indian and Chinese variety, but we tried Chinese only. The Bar-b-q special fried rice with eclectic mix of prawn, chicken, mushroom, pork and lots of vegetables was a treat to our taste buds. Add on to the brilliant preparation of  Kung Pao Chicken. The quantity was sufficient enough for two of us. Prompt service and amicable staff behavior added on to our delight. 

For a nice Sunday lunch or for a sumptuous dinner , if you want to take the Chinese Sojourn, this old grand eatery at the heart of park street, is worth visiting many a times.

This place is located in one of the most prime area of kolkata its also called the food hub of kolkata Park Street...this place doesnt need any kind off of introduction since years its growing popularity says it all...the quality of the food is average and is overhyped they serve since chinese starters main coarse is dicy depending upon your luck that day going to this place on weekends is a big no no as there is no place to stand also the minimum waiting will be over an hour the place gets very noisy at night on all days being very difficult to hear the person you are going with to dine you litreally have to shout to listen to the next person 
overall its a decent place to go and have food as the food is decent and the pocket pinch is not that high

Bar-B-Q located at the heart of Park Street. It is a bar cum restaurant.
So it has a great location. The ambiance is great- dim light, nice decoration but this place is always buzzing with crowd. You have to wait for some time before getting a space. Waiters are well trained. Behavior is great. You ask them also to suggest for you. Mainly, it is known for its Chinese dishes. My favorite is pork preparation.

Cost- for 2 people 900/- approx (without liquor)

Bar-B-Q is probably one of the oldest restaurants in Park Street and like a fine wine, it has only gotten better with age. It serves both North Indian and Chinese cuisines, and I paid them a visit last week with a bunch friends, and as always, I wasn't disappointed. 

It is a custom to wait for a table at Bar-B-Q, but that day we were lucky and didn't have to wait too long, even though it was a weekend. I've always loved the ambience  there, and has been the same since I can remember. 

Coming to the food, we ordered the Red Pepper Babycorn and the Vegetable Spring Rolls, which were very good. My friends ordered Drums of Heaven and absolutely loved it. They serve a 'Surprise Sauce' along with the starters (sometimes you have ask for it), which a tangy sauce, slightly but not overtly sweet, and complements the food very well).

 Next, we ordered Vegetable Fried Rice, Vegetable Manchurian, Chilli Garlic Noodles and Babycorn and Mushroom in Hot Garlic Sauce. The food was excellent, except the Chilli Garlic Noodles had too much chilli. Now, I know that Chilli garlic Noodles are supposed to be spicy, but this particular one was so spicy that I couldn't taste the garlic, or even the noodles. The servers immediately offered to replace that, which was thoughtful of them. 

For dessert, we had the old favorite- Dar Saan, which is a Korean speciality. It had crisp, flat honey noodles, garnished with sesame and almond slivers, and was served with ice cream. 

The best part about Bar-B-Q are their portions, which are so huge, that you physically struggle to finish them, but mentally you're still craving for more. The prices are easy on the pocket!

So, overall, I would rate the place, under the following heads as:

AMBIENCE: 4.5/5
FOOD:4.5/5
SERVICE: 5/5
VALUE FOR MONEY: 5/5

Keep it up Bar-B-Q!!  :)

I've been going to Bar-B-Q for years and years and i've never had a disapointing meal, ever. I prefer going there for Chinese food but their Indian is really delicious too. Their chicken with cashews, lemon chicken and golden fried prawns are soooo good. I love the ambience too. It's got that old, colonial vibe. I highly recommend this restaurant.

Heard a lot of this restaurant from many people. Visited it with a couple friends and had a lovely meal. Thankfully we were in before the crowd started pouring in.

The food was average and service was slow (it was a full house). The price of food was decent but alcohol was costly.

Each dishes were enough for two people and food was less spicy and gets digested quickly.

Third time in BBQ and I loved it. I was there for lunch with a friend and the experience was well above our expectations. Although BBQ is located right in the middle of the busy Park Street, the atmosphere inside is quiet and quaint, broken only by the clinking of the glasses and plates. 
We ordered Fried Chicken Wantons, Shezwan Chicken, Garlic Fish, Chilli Garlic Noodles and Chocolate Fudge Cake. 
The service is prompt, and within ten minutes, we were served with the Wantons. Crispy outside, with soft chicken inside it was absolutely amazing with the perfect sauce. The portions were good too, around 15 pieces of wantons. 
Next came the Noodles, Fish and Chicken. The Noodles were perfectly seasoned, the Fish soft and the chicken served in a perfect sauce. There was enough left over to pack. 
The chocolate fudge cake, came in a glass topped with nuts and chocolate sauce. The taste was good enough. We had also ordered Fresh Lime Soda and the total bill was quite reasonable. 
The service was warm and prompt, the servers asking us about our food, and asking us to check the temperature of the mineral water. 
The only drawback seemed to be the napkins, which seemed old and not washed well. However, the food and the service more than quite made up for it. 
Looking forward to visiting Bar B Que again.

Its okay to give them a 4.5 given the prompt service they offer and the food to die for. Bit over-priced, but the location is un-complain-able. They are awesome in preparing any pork dishes, its actually here that i found my love for pork. Great deal of servicing and actually the manager will see out to your needs.

Going there was a sudden decision and it is good to say that we made the right call.

For starters we had the red pepper chicken and it was good enough. For the main course we made a special order for cheese garlic nun along with some north indian chicken gravy dish. The cheese garlic nun was the star of the day and tasted yum and i will suggest everyone to try it once.

Bar-B-Q is one of those places which has been there like ever, when eating out in Kolkata meant being in Park Street. And somehow these places have a charm of their own. Dimly lit, huge hall, comfortable chairs, classy decor, courteous service and reliable quality of food.

Barb-B-Q serves both Chinese and North Indian cuisine but in different parts of the restaurant. And you can visit any one of them and expect no unpleasant surprises.

I have been there couple of times and have tried both the cuisines. The Kebabs are great, soft with subtle taste. My personal favorite would be the Hariyali Kebab. I love their Dal Makhani, which is just perfect.

Last time I went, we had Chinese. We ordered Tom Yum soup, which was fine, but the Chicken Drums of Heaven, were from heaven. And also, as we were 7, they served 7 pieces instead of 6 in a plate, in the same price, which was so nice of them. In the main course, I loved the Singaporean Rice Noodles and please try the Fish in Wine Sauce - its fabulous.

It was our annual reunion and we took 3 hours to complete our lunch, but they were extremely courteous and didn't once rush us, even though the place was really crowded.

Being a Chinese food lover i can say that this place never disappoints me . I have never tried the indian food so cant comment on it .
Veg fried rice ,chilli paneer and the kulcha and naan are really nice . The quality and quantity are more than enough for two people plus its not heavy on your pocket . 
The ambience is good nothing extra ordinary but its noisy at times . 
I will give it 5 because the food is the best part of bbq . :)

Bar B Q is one of the famous restaurant in Park Street. I visited this one a few days back with a special friend of mine. I was blown away by the ambience .The decor is trendy and suitable . The staffs were very cordial and suggestive. We started with the Drums of Heaven which was truly remarkable. Its was crispy and delicious . For the main course,we decided to go with Devil’s Chicken and Mixed Fried Rice ( without pork, coz I don’t like it). The rice was filled with prawns, chicken and mushrooms, and was immensely  tasty. Devil’s chicken is a spicy dish and also quiet popular. The pieces of chicken were so soft and the gravy was just perfectly cooked . The quantity of food was appropriate and the price is also very reasonable. It really serves one of the best Chinese food in Kolkata.

I first got the idea of Bar-B-Q when I passed my ICSE and was taken for a treat there. The food was excellent the first time but the platform for a review was unknown to me. Finally, when I got the opportunity to and revived the good food memory and the ambiance. Recently, few months back, me and my beau decided to have dinner and we narrowed our choice down to Bar-B-Q. In the heart of the Park Street, Bar-B-Q is a a very welcoming restaurant with a pretty formal ambiance. We went there and ordered Fried Rice and Black Fungus Chicken. The food arrived hot and we dived into it with hungry written all over our stomach. The black fungus mushroom had an extraordinary taste and blended with the chicken and the gravy, BEAUTIFULLY. The combination of the fried rice and the chicken was brilliant and we both enjoyed the food and glanced contented smiles. The quantity was perfect and upto the brim but not overwhelming. I was, however, in mood for some dessert and asked the waiter for Caramel Custard which was written in the menu itself. However I got negation for an answer and he offered me for ice-cream. I was reluctant to switch Caramel custard for an ice cream, hence I couldn't quench my yearning for a dessert at the end of a perfect meal. However, the main dinner was of fulfillment and I could go out of the restaurant in happiness. Oh and the pocket pinch was not at all a pinch. Rather it was a little negligible pin-prick considering the ambiance and the location. 

I would definitely come back for the mushroom. However, the availability for the Caramel custard would increase the visit more often.

The Bar-B-Q located in the heart of Park Street, this restaurant is a heaven for the Chinese food lovers and every food lover must checkout this restaurant,though they serve north indian food also but i always choose to prefer their chinese cuisine.
Before coming to the food i must say they have great interior and a awesome staff, who always guides you if you need any kind of help like finding tables or choosing the menus. They never feel irritated if you keep on asking them for suggestions for foods guidance or any other stuff. They are very well mannered and gives you a warm feeling. Undoubtedly the service is great in Bar-B-Q.
As i tried all of their food i will specially recommend some of the great Bar-B-Q dishes which are Mopu Topu,kung pao chicken, mixed hakka chowmin ( Must try ), chicken with cashew nuts/almonds,chicken manchurian and very important their fresh lime soda ( Do try )
You will get the best quality of chinese food at a very decent price. They charge just perfect and never over charge like many other renowned restaurant in kolkata.
For me Bar- B -Q is a splendid restaurant and always be in my top list.

This restaurant is old, old fashioned and huge. The interiors are of 'British Amol'.  Victorian, as said by many people. But, i feel that the interior is neither shabby nor shiny. Comprised of four sections, the all-in-one section, the Chinese section, Indian one and a Hideout section, this place has enormous seating capacity.
Went last Saturday after a long time. The soft, thick carpets on the staircase and floor revoked my childhood memories. Nothing has changed that much.

The floor managers managed a four sitter table for couple of us on the first floor of the main section. But an odd smell immediately turned us down. The place wasn't smelling fresh.
However, we changed our seats and ordered our food. The waiters guided us nicely and were very cordial.
Now, the first thing we ordered was Chicken Fried Wonton. The Wontons were crispy and very very tasty. But they didn't provide any sauce or ketch-up with it. Neither that was on table.
The second one was Cantonese rice noodles. We found that one a bit undercooked. But, taste was decent enough. And quantity was sufficient for 2.

Kung Pao chicken was the side dish we chose. It was damn good in taste. Decently sized enough number of chicken pieces with generous cashew nuts. Gravy was tasty too. One thing we disliked was that, there we got almost 6-7 dry chilly. It was like 'kebab mein haddi'.

As we were only two, we could not try variety of dishes. So, we decided to move to deserts.
I ordered Chocolate Soufflé and she ordered Vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. Now, in ice cream there were 2 scoops of vanilla with chocolate sauce miserly added. But the chocolate soufflé was an eye candy with few chocolate flakes garnished in the top. My friend liked it so much that she instantly snatched it from me and gave me her ice cream (Well, women are always privileged in such cases). The ice cream was so so. But, the soufflé was yummmyyyy!!!! Lightly cooled soufflé- just the perfect amount of sweetness, smooooth in taste, lightly baked and heart-filling (yess, she is so kind hearted that she allowed me to have 2 spoonful  ;-) and I was overwhelmed with it's taste.) For the desert lovers, it is a must try.
Now the bill was a stunner... All this only @1000!!!

Hmmm... I guess I will visit again on next Saturday!!!!

I went to this place last saturday and immensely loved the place.

What a Restaurant!!..I could have stood there and taken in the ambience for a few minutes.It was completely full and yet we got a seat.

The service was top notch,as we were explained about all the items and even the delivery time it will take.

We ordered,fried chicken wings,Special bar b q chowmein and devils chicken.

The quantity was awesome.the quality was great.

Recommended.

Location: Park Street. 

This is a place where I have been so many times! 
Serves great food. Have tried both Chinese and Indian cuisines out here and both are absolutely amazing. 
But yes, with little yet major flaws. 

Being to the point, 
Chinese: 

Veg Hakka noodles 
Perfectly tossed and cooked with the veggies being juicy. 

Veg Manchurian 
The dumplings were delicious and the gravy tasted great. 

Veg American Chopsuey 
Crispy noodles with the perfectly made sauce (actually not recalling what it's called, sorry). 
Super Yummy. 

Chilli Garlic Noodles 
Perfect. Simply perfect. 


Indian: 

Dal Makhani 
Low on salt, but great to taste when salt levels are perfected. 

Paneer Butter Masala 
Delectable. 
Recommended. 

Chana Masala 
Perfectly cooked. Has been given some soaking time. Happy. 
Recommended. 

Butter Naan 
Soft and brushed with the right amount of butter. 
Great. 

Tandoori Roti 
Sad. Wasn't made to choice, and was so crisp that it felt as if eating papad. 
:-( 

Now, 
Talking about the hygiene, 
Until the last two visits it felt top notch. 
But, sorry to say have encountered this problem couple of times now and hence forced to make an impression of low hygienic levels. 

Came across these in the last two visits: 
-The plates were dirty. 
- Cutlery wasn't changed while tables were cleaned. Used ones were kept. 
-Glasses weren't properly cleaned. Lip marks could be seen. Yuck! 

Disgusted regarding this issue. 
Things were taken care of after bringing into the notice of the manager. 

But I suppose these things should be taken care of inside the kitchen. 
Does this mean the kitchen hygiene levels are too low? 
Wish to check the kitchen hygiene levels one day! 

Staff was well-informed yet laid back and grumpy. 

Pricing was slight towards the high.

Just coz the Fooding is great and has clean past records, this place is rated Four. 

Overall a Mixed experience. 
Wishing to see things back to normal and cleaner out here.

Park Street boasts of some of the greatest restaurants in Kolkata. More than anything the restaurants here being legendary give you a very retro and vintage sort of feeling. And this is what I like best about eating out at Park Street. 

Bar-B-Q is one amongst them. It has 2 sections: Indian & Chinese. I am yet to try Indian so I can only comment on the Chinese Food. 

Upon entry a flight of stairs will take you to the main sitting area. And wow!! What an ambience! Perfect lighting, nice decor and comfortable sitting arrangements make your dining an awesome experience.

We had been there on one of my friend's birthday...30th January, 2014. I tried Chilly Garlic Noodles and Singing Chicken. The latter is a sizzler and tastes simply delicious. The portions served are more than sufficient. One bowl of rice / noodle can serve 2.5 - even 3 people sumptuously. Even the starters or main course side dishes come in ample quantity. The dishes are very reasonably priced compared to any other decent restaurants in its genre. All in all great value for money. 

Nice ambience, soothing lights and great food...all are sure to make your dining experience at Bar-B-Q to return for more.

The best and the finest place to have dinner. It's place where two cuisine is available -
Chinese
North Indian 
Both are it's best. Trust me..!! I don't think I need to review about this restaurant as almost every Calcuttan's one of the favouraite place. Whenever u go to this place whether it is weekday or weekends this place is always busy.
Ambience ???? service???? and when it comes to food it is EXCELLENT..!!
North Indian almost everything is good whether it is dal makhani or aloo do pyaja... And in Chinese I love there AMERiCAN cOrN PePPEr SALt  plus CHiLLi GARlic NooDLEs it is a must try..!!

Went there few years back when i was in college. A bit crowded but the good seating arrangement helps the place look orderly, ambience is good. Serving time is decent. I remember that we ordered a plate of mixed fried rice (without pork) and mushroom turkey curry (not sure if it is still a part of their menu). Taste was heavenly and quantity was enough for two. One should really go and try it out once.

Impeccable is the term to describe the experience.
Be it indian or chinese, both cuisines r made to perfection. So much so that the taste buds now define the taste of items as prepapred at Bbq. Benchmark is so high with lot of expectations on every visit, still the legendry restaurant meets it successfully every time. More than 15 yrs of continous visits and still the craving n longing persits as the taste of food lingers in the mouth always.

This restaurant reminds you of the old Park Street days when it was the best food street of Kolkata. The old British architecture and decor welcomes you in this not so new restaurant. Dont expect something extraordinary in its decor but soak in its ambience. If you are looking for a quiet cosy dinner, then this one is not for you. The cacaphpony of the people and the simple straight sitting arrangements add to its age old charm. Known for its chinese preparations, you can enjoy a variety of chinese dishes while enjoying a drink or a two. After its acquisition of Tandoor, an Indian restaurant beside it, Bar-B-Q now serves both Indian and chinese food. Still the chinese dishes remain its USP. The soups are delicious to say the least. You can try the Red pepper chicken as well as the Fried prawns from the starter menu. From the main course, pan fried noodles is a bit different. So if you are game for a "hatke" dish you can try it. All the side dishes are good enough and you can order any depending on your palate. But one word of caution, the quantity they serve is huge, I mean just huge. One plate of noodles is sufficient for 2 people and a side dish is good enough for 3. So select wisely and enjoy the food!!

I went there for Sunday Brunch. As usual it was crowded. We ordered Indian. Started with Murg Kalimirch Kabab which was good. Then comes the main course, we had ordered Dal Makhani, Veg Jalfrazi and Veg Pulav. The veg Jalfrazi looked and tasted like boiled vegetables given at the hospital. Please add a little more spices to it. 
Ambience rate 4/5.

I went there today with a bunch of friends to celebrate a Bday party, and frankly i was disheartened by the experience. We ordered both Chinese and Indian food, and were utterly let down by Chinese fare. The Fried Rice was too oily and Fish Hot Garlic was a bit too overcooked. Surprisingly the Indian cuisines tasted really good.  Anyways hoping for a better experience the next time i visit there.

Last wednesday, on my birthday me and my friend decided to visit the well known and much talked restaurant for the first time. It is situated near the park street metro, opposite flurys. The dining area is on the first floor. It was lunch time and the llace was crowded but we got a table for two instantly. We received warm welcome from the people out there. We ordered 
1. Pan fried chilly fish as starter
2. Mixed fried rice
3. One pork item
All the three items were delicious, and quite good in quantity as well. The fried rice had generous amount of chicken, prawn, mushroom in it. 
But the drawback was that they did not have all of the desserts available except tutty fruity and ice creams. We had to order one large tutty fruity and it was avarage in quality. 
The decor was nice, but the ambience was quite loud. It was hard for us to talk in our normal voice.
 Overall a nice experience. And the budget, although a bit on the higher side, is quite acceptable considering the quality of food

One of my favourite place in Park Street, though I tasted chinese food there that is why i can only tell about the chinese dishes. The starters as well as main couse dishes all are very delicious. The crispy chilli baby corn, the Bar-B-Q Special Vegetable Soup, Singapore Chicken, American Chopsuey and Bar-B-Q special chowmein, these are what i liked the most.
Hope to taste all the dishes soon.

Another visit to one of my favourite places in Park Street! This time for a friend not originally from the city and wanted to savour the Park Street legends. 

It was a weekday evening, yet we could only get tables in the corner of the bar section, almost in the cellar (!) , but we didn't mind! Food was great, as always. The fish fingers are probably the best in town. Kebabs and lamb entrées were perfect. The chilli garlic noodles and the classical chicken main courses were just right, as always. Prices are reasonable. However, the pan fried noodles were not up to the mark and so was the barman who gave us stern looks for being too rowdy! Seriously?! I'll take my friend to Oly next time if we are focusing on having a drink. But nice experience overall.

When you're looking at value for money, quality of food, ambience, and behavior of restaurant staff all together, you're probably in need for a sumptuous meal at Bar-B-Q. This is one restaurant which will make you happy even on your worst days. Its pathetic to not find this elite restaurant as the No. 1 restaurant on Zomato. I'll suggest you to treat yourself to a Chinese dinner or lunch comprising of Pan Fried Fish as starter, Chicken Hakka Chow mein and Chilli Chicken or Chilli Pork. This remains the evergreen combination that I prefer at Bar-B-Q.

I can not give less than 5 stars as the ambience & the food was wonderful. The friendly behavior of the waiters were also very commendable. Loved it. "Lat me kai", which is actually the trademark dish is very good. Everyone should try that. The mixed gravy noodles was splendid. The restaurant is not pricey also. Value for money. The fish item that we ordered had a unique taste. But the fish was some kind of unknown sea fish. The fish was very soft. But it was definitely not Betki. So don't experiment with the fish if u have some problems with unknown sea food. But overall the experience was splendid. So Will definitely recommend this family restaurant. Cheers !!!! :-)

This restaurant is a delight for any chinese cuisine lover. One of the best restaurants to go whether with friends or family. Special must-haves include chinese bhel and crispy chilly babycorn. No one whether in calcutta or mumbai or bangalore or hyderabad can prepare these as good as this place!! The place is huge with numerous tables and yet you may find yourself waitin for a few minutes on an evening weekend!

My second time in Cal and staying close to Park Street. Didn't want to go to Mocambo, Peter Cat etc.. as I'd tried them out last time. Bar B Q is pretty famous too and I was in the mood for Chinese. After reading a few good reviews (and hoping for Punjabi style Chinese) in I went... 


--------------------------------
Ambiance
--------------------------------
Various floors. On the weekend, the upper ground floor and first floor are reserved for family only. The ground floor is if you're a group of friends/single.  The first floor is the one with the decent decor. Ambient lighting, wooden beams and a few Chinese paintings on the wall. Crazily jam packed! But not in a get-me-out-of-here sort of way but more of a damn-this-place-does-well sort of way. 

--------------------------------
Food
--------------------------------
I tried the Schezwan Chilly Chicken (which is my yardstick for judging Chinese Restaurants) and Veg Fried Rice. The chicken was great and I absolutely loved the fried rice. Something about the taste of those grains which only a few restaurants manage. So flavorful! 

I went again the next day for lunch and this time ordered Stir-fried Chicken Noodles. The chicken and the mushrooms in the dish were great but the actual noodles were a bit too thick and oily for my liking. However, I would have to say the quality of the food is great and the dinner meal is still fresh in my mind. I was expecting Punjabi style chinese, not the authentic stuff, and I got it. Good stuff! 

--------------------------------
Service
--------------------------------
Great service. First night I went it was really crowded. The manager helped me find a place and got the food pretty quick though he'd told me it would take time due to the rush. Courteous waiters who insist on serving the food :). 

--------------------------------
Cost
--------------------------------
For the location, ambiance and the food, a definite 5/5 here!


--------------------------------
Would I go again?
--------------------------------
I went 2 days straight so will not be going again on this trip:) but a definite go-to-place on my next Kolkata visit. Highly recommended.

Really disappointed with this reputed place which used to b one of my most favourite restaurants in the park st. Area. We ordered the Bar-b-Q special chowmein as I had heard n read a lot about this one wholesome dish that the place serves. What we got instead were 2 plain mixed Hakka chowmin!! They didn't once tell us that d dish wasn't available, they simply denied it by saying that both the dishes are the same. Yes, they charged the rate of the plain chowmin n the service was nice as well. But if u don't find what u wanted, half of the impression fades away! Be careful before u order anything n cross check it twice.

I find Bar-B-Q spacious and interior is quite descent as well, Along with well behaved waiters. Other than these few things there is one thing that outshines all that is there food!!!! Quality and Quantity both are overwhelming. I might sound a bit biased about this place but this is genuinely what i feel. And last but not the least dis place doesn't hurt your pocket much as well ;)

We dined here for a late lunch near closing time of the restuarant to close for lunch, nevertheless the waiters never frowned and we took our time to choose the menu.

I love this place for its decors, built into an old calcutta building with high raised roof and huge windows overlooking the Park street and dim lighting.Its one of the best place to have a cozy dinner with your loved one.

We went in for some chineese and some traditional indian cuisine, their chilly mushrooms are outstanding.

This one truly deserves a 5 star but for a glitch somewhere. had ordered the Chilly Mushroom to start with followed by a chinese serving of Schezuan Chowmin and Chilli Paneer. The mushrooms were the tastiest I have had till today.Crunchy on the outside and soft and saucy inside, it felt great tasting them and gulping a lot of them down.In between I ordered a scotch for me and it was disheartening to find I was served one with a small fly in it.Anyway the staff was courteaous to acknowledge and get it changed.The chilli paneer that followed was even better and it feels great to have good paneer after a long time from a veggie's perspective!! The serving of chowmin and paneer was more than enough for two and I left this restaurant with a great tate bud tickling and stomach filling experience. A must visit for all food lovers in Kolkata!!!!

Thinking of treating yourself with delicious food, located in the heartthrob of Kolkata -Park street..  They serve the best versions of  Chinese, Indian and Tandoori.One of the very old Calcutta restaurants that have fed generations and generations of Calcuttans, Bar-B-Q is a name regarded as being on of the best in the family of Kolkata restaurants. A family restaurant, the noisy decibels of its customers can be quite annoying but it also speaks volumes of their popularity. You visit any day and anytime, u you will be welcomed with a waiting of at least 20-30 min. Scrumptious food with classy ambiance at a reasonable price, no wonder this place is always so packed and most important there is no short comings in the service despite the huge footfall through out the day... The Steward was helpful enough in choosing our menu. Especially the managers came and make sure that everyone is satisfied with the food and service. I am hard-core non vegetarian, so i am nt sure about the veg section but for nov-veg one can treat themselves starting with  red pepper chicken (dry appetizer), Kung pao chicken (less spicy side dish), devils chicken (spicy brown side dish), Bar-b-Q special fried rice(prawn, chicken, pork) and Bar-b-Q special gravy chow min (prawn, chicken, pork). One may also try the Shezwan chicken(spicy dish), chilly chicken. Cost for two comes around 900-1000.

Without any doubt this is the best Chinese restaurant in Kolkata!! Whenever I visit kolkata I make sure I visit bar-b-q. The seating area is so big but you will always have to wait for your seat, so it's better if you book your table in advance. The crowd out there is good.
Being vegetarian I had little choices compared to the non vegetarians, but every dish from that, tastes really good.
I love crispy chilly baby corn and Hakka noodles here.
The North Indian food is equally good here.
Located in park street you might think that it must be quite expensive, but it's easy on pocket.
It's a must visit place for everyone in Kolkata and also the ones who visit kolkata.

I must say that out of 9-10 restaurants I saw in Kolkata during my visit, this has been the best of all. Ambience was perfect. Food was extremely good. Especially Chinese, simply awesome. And the best thing was that the quantity was far more than what you generally get at other premium restaurants where you pay 500-600 bucks for a spoonful of food. Service was great. Value for money was good. Its a perfect place for almost any occasion. I could find no flaws with it. Keep it up.

You might have to wait a little to get a place on weekends but its definitely worth it! It doesn't look very big from outside but its very spacious inside and pretty good to hang out with your group with some delicious food!

One of the best restaurants in the city!! If you go there on a holiday or weekends, expect a waiting time of minimum 30 minutes! But surely, your patience will pay off.. The delicious food (whether north Indian or Chinese) will set-off the boredom of waiting!! Highly recommended.. Have been there many times..

Iv been coming here since I was a toddler. So its more than 2 decades and its almost like home.Yesterday we suddenly decided to have dinner and this was the automatic choice. BELIEVE ME ..we, a family of 3 ordered a soup (1 in 2)....a fresh lime soda, 1 mixed fried rice and 1 hunan chicken...it cost us only Rs 705 inclusive of taxes...can it  get cheaper than this...I can assure u this place doesn't compromise on quality and quantity. ..and above all a splendid atmosphere,  great interiors. ..and an apt location..what r u waiting for??

There are many good restaurants in kolkata for Chinese cuisine. I find Bar-B-Q one of the best resturants to have a luxury dine. The location of this restro is also very good. According to me you find real good quality chinese food and it will surely satisfy your taste buds. Starting from starters drinks till desert, you find each and everything at its best quality and quantity. The ambience is just perfect. I would always prefer this place for good lunch or dinner. :)

A went here a few weeks ago for my sister's birthday and it was my first time here.I have been to their flavours of china  outlet next door a couple of times but i felt the decor here was much better.The ambiance was really good. The food and the quantity was good and much better than some other  comparable restaurants in the vicinity.We ordered Chinese mainly.The man chow soup was great.The quantity exceeded our expectations and we had to parcel an extra plate of fried rice.Only weak point was the waiter's over eagerness to clear the plates and hovering near the table.

Well this is quite an old and one of my favourites. The chinese is way too good, and also i can say the same for the north Indian cuisine. Their ambience is something which i remember whenever i think about parkstreet. Great to have such a restaurant in park street. Its not even heavy on our pockets. Love the way the they have kept in simple and elegant.

I can never forget the Chinese i have eaten here. Had been to Calcutta on a holiday with parents and had heard of this place. So decided to go there for lunch.
I was taken away by the food, ambiance, the service. 
had tried the crispy chilly babycorn for starters and it was imply amazing. For main course we ordered for American Chopsuey and some rice. they had a very good and also was very fresh and light.
I am a big fan of Chinese and a big fan of this place. I am sure to go dere again on my next visit to Calcutta.

Now what can I say about this restaurant!!  Any appreciation would be less for this awesome place!! I have been here thrice and i won't mind visiting this place 30 times hence.. This is the perfect place to celebrate, say it anniversaries, say it birthdays or 'a date' with "that someone special" . It will always give you a wonderful feeling as soon as you step in here.
        Firstly, let me speak about the ambiance , the restaurant is dimly lit and is decorated with wonderful furniture and comfortable seats. They provide Chinease calender as mats which I always find quite unique. There is the specific place in the restaurant where you can celebrate any of your special occasion but of-course you need to book that arena previously. 
       Secondly, the awesome staff out there always guides you if you need any kind of help for, say, to find table or choosing menus. They never feel irritated if you keep on asking them for suggestions for choosing the food or any other kind of stuffs. They are very well mannered and gives you a warm feeling. 
       Thirdly,  The most important and the best part of this restaurant is their FOOD.. Fresh lime soda is a must here.I have tasted many of their dishes like, Chicken in hot garlic sauce, Kung Pao Chicken, Chicken with Cashew nuts/Almonds , Chicken Manchurian , Szechuan Chilli Chicken and that's complete my quota for Chicken at Bar-B-Q. Mopo Tofu, baby corn in hot garlic sauce and Chilly Potato in the veg items. Apart from that I have also tasted mixed hakka Chowmein, Mixed fried rice (both without porks as we have instructed) and Veg Fried rice. Their service for  liquors is very fast. 
 Now, my recommendations are all the above dishes which I have mentioned ( :P can't select one)  but Mopu Tofu, Kung Pao Chicken , Chicken with almond/cashew-nuts and mixed hakka chowmein is a must. I have never tasted a better Chicken hakka chowmein in the city than bar-b-q.
Located in the heart of park street,this restaurant is a heaven for Chinease food lovers and every food lover must checkout this restaurant. My mother normally prefers takeaways and does't like to dine in often but when I suggest Bar-b-q for dinner She is the first one to raise her hand to have dinner here!! And the thing I forgot to mention is the price . You will get the best quality Chinease food at a very decent price , they charge perfect and never overcharge like many other renowned restaurants in Kolkata. Bar-b-q is a splendid restaurant and this will always top my list.

The first restaurant from the fabled park street which I visited. Too crowded and to get a table for two take up about 20 to 30 mins but when the food arrives you forget everything and dive into the food. We ordered a plate of haka noodles and Manchurian along with crispy chilli babycorn for starters. This was sufficient to feed two people with decent appetite completely.
We also ordered wine and out of adventurous ideas we selected a pint of Indian wine.
Trust me the combination was really really bad and I couldn't enjoy a bit about the wine.
But all of the disappointment was taken away by the tasty food and really had a good time.

Last evening me and five of my friends visited Bar-B-Q restaurant.. Its my first visit to this age-old,heritage reso-pub of park street, its been in my wish list for very long time but could not make time or the proper occasion to visit it.. My  father  used to go there with my grandfather in childhood days and even in his college days and i heard lots of great things about this restaurant so i was planning a special occasion to visit it, yesterday evening me and 5 of my school mates went there for a special occasion to celebrate but our experience was not good at all.. I was very much disappointed with my experience in this heritage restaurant.. I am not saying that its a bad restaurant, its one of the best according to many people but my personal experience was poor and im just narrating my own experience here..we went there at 7 pm ,we went straight to the first floor , though there were some vacant tables present but the floor manager told us that unless we have a lady with us they can't give us table in the main dining area, we have to sit in the ground floor in the stag section, this type of discrimination is present in Tangra restaurants i know but never faced this type of situation in any other park street restaurants like trincas, peter cat, moulin rouge etc.. thus we entered the ground floor stag section and it was cramped, filthy and doesn't have the same ambiance of the first floor main dining area.. we were given a table for 6 people in the last and smallest room where there is no television, so couldnot watch the IPL match whereas the waiters were all busy watching the match on the other room of the ground floor..  after some time they gave us menu card and without asking anything they gave us 2 dirty bottles filled with normal water and didnot have the courtesy to pour the water in the glasses, when we told that we want packaged drinking water the waiter was trying to convince us that its also filtered water and many people drink this, i had to shout to him to stop this nonsense and bring 2 bottles of packaged   drinking water, he brought 2 bottles after long time.. we had to shout to them again to take the order, all were busy watching cricket on the other room.. we ordered both indian and chinese items, among chinese we ordered mixed fried rice, szechuan chilli chicken, devils chicken, mandarin fish and from indian ordered garlic naan, chicken tikka masala , chicken bharta.. food arrived quickly.. now comes to food- mixed fried rice was extremely average, its comparable with local street chinese, nothing to comment, small chinese joints of our locality make better fried rice than this.. szechuan chilli chkn, devils chicken and mandarin fish all the three items had almost same type of gravy, same colour, same taste, same ingredients, same consistency.. whats the point of giving different names when you serve items with same taste and smell.. in most of the chinese restaurants they give either 6 or 8 big pieces of chicken or fish but here they serve 10-12 small pieces in a plate, i always prefer small number of big pieces than large number of small bits & pieces!! all the 3 gravy items were almost same as if a common gravy is prepared in large scale and then meat, fish or prawns added and mixed afterwards. i didnot like the chinese for which barbq is famous for.. now comes to indian food, garlic nan didnot have any flavour or aroma of garlic but still it was ok but cheese naan was bad, chicken tikka masala was very good and bharta was average. though the quality of the food was below average but one can't complain about the quantity and price.. quantity was huge and price was very cheap, total bill for 6 of us came around 2000, rs-2007 to be exact.. the waiter was not helpful, he knows nothing about the items , didnot serve the food also, we had to serve by ourselves as its extremely irritating to shout everytime when we needed anything and we didnot had the interest to shout again to tell him to serve, we helped ourselves but the waiter shamelessly stood besides the table after giving the bill to take his tips..I will give zero to the ambiance of the stag section , its not a fine dining restaurant, everything is crude here, food is average,  but the price doesn't pinch the pocket.. After all the bad experiences i am happy that now i have visited one of the most talked about Heritage restaurants of kolkata , its all about heritage and tradition , now  i can proudly say that i have been to BAR-B-Q..

The fried noodles were horrible. Chicken starters were ok. Overall a good cheap place for hanging out. But the place is not that great for the standard Indian fare.
The second time we went to this place we moved to a higher and larger floor which seemed like a proper restaurant with a high ceiling and two sections Chinese and Indian. If you are friendly with the waiters they may even serve you the Indian fare in the Chinese section. This time the food was much better as was the company.

A recent visit to arguably the most popular Chinese restaurant at Park Street, left me strangely asking for more. We were a large group, Park Street-bound on a Public Holiday for good Chinese food. It  was quite early, given our intentions were to dine. When we reached around 7:30, there was already a long line formed of people like us waiting to get inside and dine. 

Anyhow, we got seats in a jiffy (given the long line, outside), and doubled over the menu in concentration.  a few of us ordered chilled Carlsberg to go with the crisp of the starters. We decided on Crispy Chili Baby Corn, Drums of Heaven and Chili Garlic Pepper Chicken as starters. Commendable choices, yes, which they took too long to prepare and serve. The Baby Corn came the earliest, though I was already a bottle of beer down, by then. Then came the Drums of Heaven and Chili Garlic Pepper Chicken. All three of the starters tasted good enough to me, though the portions for Drums of Heaven seemed to me too less for anyone to properly relish the dish (add to this the fact that I was already on my third bottle of Carlsberg) . 

We ordered a few soups, as we we had decided we would while we were walking through Park Street in the heat. Chicken Sweet Corn Asparagus soup,  Chicken Coriander Soup and Bar-B-Q Special soup. The soups weren't particularly interesting, not something I would wish to go back for.

Next, for the main course we ordered Bar-B-Q Special chowmein and Mixed Fried Rice along with Hunan chicken, Konjee crispy Lamb, King Prawns in Devil's Sauce, Cantonese Prawns and Szechuan Chili Chicken. This again took quite some time to prepare and serve. The rice arrived first, nicely done and hot, though not too impressive for me. The Hunan Chicken was light and bland to my taste, though made with fresh ingredients, in  want of a heavier hand at seasoning. The King Prawns were nice and soft, fresh from the water and sweet to taste, just like it should be, easily the best item we had in the course of the evening. The Cantonese Prawns too were not too spicy, was succulent and filling. The Szechuan Chicken was average, nothing one would remember about it. The Konjee Crispy Lamb, the only dish I chose this evening, took far too long to get prepared. When it arrived, we were already in the process of getting the order cancelled since we were quite full already and it was taking too long. The dish was a sad disappointment. Not that it taste too bad, it didn't. It was fine. Just not what I expecting, I guess. It was so..plain, I think. I was really hoping for the Konjee Crispy Lamb one gets to eat at Mainland China. What we had to fill ourselves with instead was lots and lots of shredded capsicum and onion and very little lamb. Neither the quality nor the quantity satisfied my appetite. 

We had overate so much that there was no way we could have gulped down desserts. Even though I was really willing to have the Vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce, I decided to skip it, judging how bloated I felt. We had Fresh Lime soda and a few soft drinks to ease down the path before asking for the bill.


The ambiance of Bar-B-Q was homely and gently bustling as always, with families over tables chatting boisterously. Also, for the most part. their portions are generous and each plate easily feeds 2-3 people, thus making this place one of the more reasonable of the restaurants at Park Street. That given, come and visit this place only when you have a lot of time and if you are ready to overlook certain glitched in the preparation of certain dishes in favour of a moderately-satisfying dining experience without burning crater-like holes in your pockets.

Ok. so i was hoping i would not write a review about this place!I mean i could go on and on and on.After careful selection of words im however going to proceed.So, Bar-b-q, a restaurant serving chinese  has been my go to place for delicicous food always.I have celebrated almost all my birthdays(well almost all) here and this place never disappoints.
LOCATION: In the heart of parkstreet,same street as kwality and mc donalds.Who dosent know where this place is located!Cabbies often say," madam aapko park street me barbq se kitni door jaana hai" imagine!
INTERIORS: The restaurant is dimly lit and very spacious.The seatings include wonderful chairs,very comfortable.The very popular chinese crockery adorn the table when served,oh and im not to miss the chinese calender,a sheet which serves up as the plate mat.
FOOD: Here i go, my favourites include, crispy chilli babycorn( its one of their specialities and i have to order 1 of these always),american corn pepper salt,,hakka paneer,crispy chilli mushroom for entree,their spicy veg sweet corn soup which has such a great balance of sweet and spice!For main course must haves include their chili garlic noodles,cantonese style veg noodles and the pan fried noodles.Best accompaniments(veg) include,manchurian gold coins which are so soft that theymelt in your mouth,potato in hot garlic sauce which is again a staple for me when i come here.Also worth mention are the dumplings in hot garlic sauce. 
For dessert be sure not to miss lychee with icecream and toffee walnut with icecream.The caramel custard here is also good.
Great food, great ambience,great service!#ilovethisplace

How consistent (ly good) can be any place.   BBQ Kolkata stands número uno. I make sure to visit to this institution every time I visit Cal.  There is something magical about this place ... You leave so contended  and happy.   Why does the beer tastes so satisfying here !! 
The captain Steve is the Colonel Sanders for BBQ. 
My fav menu ... Chilled beer .. Chilly king prawns, red pepper chicken, Chinese salad, American corn pepper salt. The soups are awesome , I prefer the lemon coriander. 
Main course ... Mixed Cantonese noodles, devils chicken with pan fried fish. 

Desserts .. Bet u don't have space for them !!

One of the very old Calcutta restaurants that have fed generations and generations of Calcuttans, Bar-B-Q is a brand. A family restaurant,the raucous of its customers can be quite annoying but it also speaks volumes of their popularity. 
taste ambiance and everything...great food...brilliant taste ..id suggest Chinese here !
affordable to students and also perfect for occasional outings !
the tiny bar below is rather a bit dingy though !

Bar-B-Q is a restaurant which is extremely close to my heart with many memories from my job treat to my girlfriend's birthday celebration and it is only fair and polite to write this review for them. I have been here several times and never have they failed to impress. The waiters are extremely well-mannered and will make you feel welcome from the moment you enter the place. The decor is splendid and the service is fast and polite. Both food quality as well as quantity is superlative. My favourites here are the Bar-B-Q special fried rice with sliced chilly pork. This combination is extremely delectable and is enough for 2 people. The prices are again more than reasonable and you will not be left with a hole in your pocket.

It great to be at the Bar-B-Q always. the old English style decor clubbed with amazing food makes it one hell of a good joint. The lamb recipes are one of the best you get in town.
Though not many try Chello Kebabs outside Peter Cat when in Park Street, I did so at Bar-B-Q, and was pleasantly surprised to find my taste buds liking it better to that PC offers.
Love this place for its food and Good times.

Park Street is a heaven for Kolkata foodies and Bar-B-Q is a glorious part of it. I've a weakness for restaurants with soft and dim lights, that's the first best thing I noticed about this place. The people who work here are extra nice and know how to behave with their customers. Most of them looked old and experienced. The guy who served us was polite, fast, and caring. We even asked him to take a photo of us from our mobile and he not only agreed, but after clicking it was caring enough to ask us whether the photo was nice or he will have to take a new one. It's little things like these that matter!

Quality of the food was very good. We were wondering about the amount of the fried rice and they suggested to go for one bowl, that will be enough for three. Order the Kung Pao Fish from The Bay of Bengal section. It was delicious and worth remembering. The best thing? This place is inexpensive beyond your imagination. 3 of us had full meals in just 750+ rupees. I've heard that this place was affordable and classy, but had no idea that it would turn out to be so good. I'm going to visit this place again and recommend it to all.

Bar-B-Q  --- A lot appears in the name .. A place where passion meets perfection. A place which often makes us nostalgic..In fact it is one of the old Kolkata restaurants that have fed generations and generations of Calcuttans, Bar-B-Q is a name related deeply to the hearts of people of Calcutta.. Standing in the very 'food street' of Calcutta ,this place is still unbeatable in terms of consistency..Being a family restaurant, the noisy decibels of its customers can be quite annoying but it also speaks volumes of their popularity.. Me, being one of those Calcuttans ,have been visiting this place since my childhood and this had remained a hot favorite for various special occasions of my life...The serve one of the best versions of Indian Chinese Food in the city and have been doing so for years ... Recently I got an opportunity to visit this place on my friend's birthday..

Ambiance : The ambiance is too noisy..At whatever time in a day you visit here, you will find it crowdy..The interiors are well decorated .But what i like the most is the nostalgic illumination and the continuous buzz that comes from gossip of huge amount of people feeding there..The restaurant is divided into two sections - Chinese and Indian. 


Service : We were welcomed and greeted by the manager as always and he managed to help us find a table.. After taking our menu they implied us to have some hard drinks and cocktails.. The Steward was helpful enough in choosing our menu.. They provide prompt and excellent service with no negligence at all. It is one of the few places in town which never failed to live up to the expectations even after handling such a big crowd of people. They (especially the manager) also continuously took part in knowing whether we were satisfied with the food or not.. To conclude they provide fantastic efficient service with smile..

Food : We ordered the following : -
    (i)Crispy Chilly Baby Corn
    (ii)Red pepper Chicken
    (iii)Chicken Manchow Soup
    (iv)Vegetable Mushroom Soup
    (v)Devil's Chicken
    (vi)Mandarin Fish
    (vii)Bar-B-Q Special Fried Rice
    (viii)Mixed Fried Rice
    (ix)Tutti fruti
    (x)Cocktails - Bloody Mary

As usual they never compromise with quantity and the food they provide is always of high quality.. Because of this reason I love to visit this place..

To describe the above dishes (for a group of 3)in nutshell :

The starters crispy baby corn and pepper chicken were perfectly enjoyed with the hot and tasty soup.. We, a group of hungry boys consumed these in not time.. Crispy chilly Baby Corn was great which was a good mixture of crisp and chilly and we found out that we were craving for more..Both the soups tasted good and healthy...
Devil's Chicken was spicy yet tasty .The dish had fair enough pieces..Mandarin fish was the star of the show ..The gravy along with the material complimented perfectly with the rice.. Nevertheless ,all of their chinese dishes are good...Bar-B-Q special fried rice had all sorts of veges,egg,chicken and even prawns, which is a must try.. Though we couldn't find much difference between this and mixed fried rice, but both were perfectly cooked and sauteed.. Two rice is enough for 3 adults and sometimes even more...All the foods were fresh and we enjoyed till our tummies were completely full.. After a healthy meal ,I preferred to have a cocktail and ordered Bloody Mary whereas my friends went for the desserts..They had no complaints about tutti fruti and I was satisfied with the bloody mary..

Overall , yet another  pleasant experience ... A place where u can completely dine with the chinese cuisine .. Each of us finished being a binge..A huge amount of people u get to see here , the reason is their affordable pricing unlike some other places in Park Street..Will come again as i like dining at Bar-B-Q... :-)

Value for money : Yes , U get what u pay for.. They take good care of both the quantity and quality of food.
Well Recommended !!!!

This is my favourite favourite restaurant. Whether its lunch, a little snack or dinner, Bar-B-Q always remains a hot favourite. The interiors are great and the service is brilliant. The quantity of food they give, is overwhelming. A regular fried rice is good for at least 3 people. With the perfect ambience and great tasting food, this is the place where i would love to come back over and over again.

Bar B Q goes back decades.Moulin Rouge next door with Delilah crooning  and Oasis where the tinkling of glasses and popping of sodas and beerr never stopped. Always a popular "CHINEEEEE..." place which the kids loved as also the young "daters" tucked away in a quiet  dark corner.
The Chinese very edible and not like the delhi Punjabi Chineee!  . The haka noodles,sweet sour prawns,Chop suey wit fried eggand KRISPY Noodles are popular and tasty.The pork Charsu was well made . The soups,chicken corn,wonton noodle were quite filling and tasty.
Overall BBQ has maintained its standard  as also its old menu !!! A place for tytpical old Calcutta Chinese fare and well worth it.

Being a foodie i love this place and their chinese..juz opposite to the flury's at park street stands bar-b-q..i have been there many a times and love the ambience and quality food served here...

I went there recently for a friend's bday treat..i am a lover of chinese and enjoy it at any time ...we had the starters as chicken wings ..which has adequate quantity and was very tasty...coming to the main course both mixed fried rice and chicken hakka noodles were there with manchurian chicken,schezwan chicken,sweet n sour chicken and garlic chicken....each side dish tastes awesomeee ..loved the main course a lot...the added flavours of china makes their dishes more special and delicious..

In the desert we had chocolate ice cream...which was beautifully decorated with wafers..loved their preparations and attitude of the servers..well maintained and cordial they were...
I loved this place and dunno how many more times would be going there again.. best chinese in town..highly recommended..though its name itself is enough!!!:)

On the busy street of Park Street this is a decades old restuarant with old and classic ambience. We went there for dinner on Tuesday eve and occupancy rate was quite decent. Initially they told us to take seats in their upper floor which was like an attic and bit suffocating, so we decided to take seats in their main dining area. Seating was comfortable and cooling in the area was also effective. We ordered cauliflower manchurian, chilli garlic fried rice and fresh lime. Fried rice was feel cooked and cauliflower manchurian was also decent ( caveat: you ought to love cauliflower for dis otherwise order mixed veg manchurian). The quantity was sufficient for 3-4 people if you order one starter along with that.  Fresh lime was not well prepared as there was no fizz left in the soda. We shelled out INR 532 in total. One thing I will like to mention that service was quite slow. They took around 20 minutes to serve our order. Still on food quality basis I will recommend this place.

As soon as we sat  we ordered chilli garlic pepper chkn, chinese chopsuey, konjee crispy chkn, screwdriver nd a hot choclate fudge. Out of all chilli garlic pepper chkn was the best.fabulous taste.konjee crispy chkn was hot nd sweet..liked it too.screwdriver nd hot choclate fudge was nice but i must say the chinese chopsuey was a setback.there were lumps of chkn.mae be the dish z like that..whateva i didnt like it.one thing i must say they were kind of hurrying.i didnt finish the starter when dey served the main course!!. But all over the experince was good. I would give 4/5. Foodies this is a  place u should visit..u will like it...

I went to this BAR B Q for lunch along with my wife and 2 years old Son, we placed order for chelo kabab, the person who took the order was great. 

While we were waiting for our order to be served, my son was enjoying in the hotel with some baloons and also he was screaming sometimes though we tried to stop him but he is an infant and I am sure you all will agree to this except one of the captains who came and advised to ask my son to be quite as the rest of the guest are getting disturbed..I asked him if the 2 year infant can understand that this is a BARBQ restro, or if he knows what is his limitations or may be the captain was asking me to scold my son. My question to him was if we are grown up and was making ciaos out there then I would have admitted that yes he was correct but he cannot come and tell the little one to keep quite which I took as offended and I and my wife walked out of restro. I must say the captain was very rude and hence I will never ever recommend anyone to bring there child along to this place rather go to mainland china or singri were the staffs are very friendly.   
I also should add that once we came out we went to Park hotel and had a great time , friendly staff and also very good service though had to pay on the higher side. 

The bottom line to all foodies is if you are planning to dine with your lill one this is not the right place untll you have such kind of staffs.

Suggested by a friend, went there for my birthday lunch along with two of my friends. The place though grandiloquent in style and essence, made for a very pleasant and congenial ambiance.  The place was calm, gentle and the lights were easy, which is what I like and probably a very decisive considerations for me while judging the ambiance.

Now, coming to the food we ordered Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken for starters and for the main course we had Bar-B-Q Special Fried Rice, Mixed Chow mien, Chilli Chicken Boneless and Sweet & Sour Prawns. I must say the Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken was an amazing prep. and leaves you craving for more. The first bite of it just complemented the mood of my day, like it just doubled my happiness and in a jiffy they were all gone. 

After a while came our main course. The fried rice and the chilli chicken were good and well, and the mixed chow mien was very delicious, savory and whatever you call it. However, the Sweet & Sour Prawns was a bit of a dampener. Tasted like it was bedraggled in a sweet tomato ketchup, hence it was excessive on the sweeter side. The quantity of the servings were pretty magnanimous though, we managed to cross the line finally. It was a wonderful meal and an eve well spent that left us fully satisfied.

Any foodie from this city will talk of nostalgia when you mention BAR B Q.Umpteen visits there since childhood and one of my favorite places to dine.
This time went after a long time at least seven months after.The ambiance is as before.The warm plates ....all okay.But  what was lacking is the service and food quality..The captains hardly listen to you rather are busy chatting in a group.We were quite late for lunch. We had chinese. .They have lost the old flavour. .Its total Indianised now may be because of public demand.The red pepper fish was too hot. It had no peppers but red dry  chilies. The.The soup was cold.  The main dishes as usual but quality has fallen taste wise.
And the worst part. Everything was served too fast not giving us the time to breath.Why? Let us enjoy our drink and starter then you ask and serve.But that politeness is gone.Let more people flock there and me be happy with the new ones like Mainland China and Red Hot Chili Peppers.

I'm here today with a rather sad review for this place, coz of one particular dish. I'm a regular here and rather love it, usually.

Red Pepper Chicken. Avoid. Chicken pieces are not fried well. You'll get that boiled chicken smell in your mouth. Unusually high amount of fried garlic, scallions and chillies..which do nothing to the dish. 

Simply not good and  not at all satisfactory. 

Take note, please.

Bar- B-q is amongst the finest restaurants the eastern metropolis of Kolkata boasts of, no questions raised. Everything about the eatery exudes style, class and unmatched finesse. I have been there many a time & seldom have I come back with a feeling of bitterness. The area is expansive with multiple tiers and separate sections, each of which are tastefully done up& appreciably soothing to the senses. 
I rightfully expect the Indian section at the restaurant to be at par with the high standards set by the Chinese section (Flavours of China, for the uninitiated) , but unfortunately, that isn't the case. Neither is the Indian menu here that elaborate as you only have a handful of options to choose from (when compared with the Chinese menu), nor does the quality of the finished product in the Indian section match up to that of the Chinese counterpart.
I was particularly disappointed with the Mutton Rogan Josh I had here a few months back. I was expecting something extraordinarily good, given the monstrous reputation of the restaurant& the inviting connotations of a spicy mutton dish. But I was massively let down by the bland curry & 'hard- as- bricks' mutton pieces, which added up to no more than 3. I definitely expected more from a dish that is pretty much regularly ordered by customers& is priced handsomely. The chicken dish wasn't too impressive either. Order kababs and tikkas to satiate your North Indian cravings here& you won't be disgruntled.
However, Bar- B- Que can't go wrong with Chinese. Order anything in Chinese skin here which is worth the money in your pocket& you would have full value for your money. The starters, the main course dishes& the variety on offer is from the top drawer& can rival the biggest players in the game anywhere across the country. The quantities are sufficient, the prices are affordable& the ambiance is unquestionable. 
There are however a few other things I have disliked about the place in recent times. They do not allow you to sit in the main upper tier if you are a group of only male members& shift you to a somewhat awkward section beneath the staircase, citing 'family comfort' reasons. I found that disgusting because neither were we going to booze (as we all happened to be teetotalers) , nor were we obnoxious enough to be a nuisance to the 'family customers'. 
Also, off late I have found out that the waiters almost 'demand' a tip, though the overall bill inflates massively when the service tax, service charge& the VAT are included. I chose not to pay the tip on the last occasion& they passed ludicrous comments, loud enough to piss you off. This isn't expected from a restaurant of the aura& stature of Bar- b-q.
I would still go with 4 for Bar- b- q because I still harbor a lot of fondness for the restaurant. If you haven't yet visited Bar- b-q for a classic fine- dining experience yet, well, I seriously don't know what you are waiting for!

After having waited for months we finally got ourselves seated here.
The most disappointing thing about this place is its way of handling customers waiting outside and specially an all boys gang.
Finally one fine day I got myself a seat here and the food sort of made up for all the anger that I was seething with for having not gotten a seat earlier.
The service was nice and prompt.There are some managers who are very nice and courteous and others who need to be taught as to how to handle the customers better.

It used to one of the places I could trust for a really good Indian food. I used to recommend it to people saying they are definitely one of the best when it comes to Indian food. But, now they food is horrible, not only does it taste awful but they serve stake food. 
The last time I was there, they served me stale fish and the food managed to upset my friend's stomach. Really disappointed, don't think I'm ever going back there. 
Points have only been given for the ambience.

Bar-B-Q is an institution on Park Street. It was on my list of must-visits for a very long time, and I finally got a chance in December 2013. It is a sprawling restaurant, spread over two floors. While the first floor is huge, catering to large crowds, the upper section, which is smaller and quieter, is ideal for a nice laid-back lunch of Chinese favourites. We ordered the Bar-B-Q special chowmein, Red Pepper Fish and a lamb dish. The portions are very generous, and the taste is a mix of light and spicy. the prices too, are light on the pocket! 
I really enjoyed eating at Bar-B-Q and I will definitely go back there to try some of their other stuff.

Been here many times. This restaurant in Park Street is quite famous all over Kolkata. Located just beside MacD and opposite Flurys, its a 5 minute walk from the Park Street crossing. 

Ambience of the place is quite good. It has a separate section - Flavours of China located just beside it. This place gets crowded in the late evenings and weekends and thus prior reservations should be done. Otherwise, one can find a long queue outside the place.

The alcoholic drinks are quite reasonable here. Food items are a tad expensive i feel, especially the starters. Also, during the peak hours, it takes a long time to serve the orders. I didn't like the customer service too much as on one occassion, the waiter was rude to us. Food tastes good and also the quantity is good.

A longtime favourite and hangout place for me... This place has been associated with too many memories and celebrations for me to not be nostalgic about it.

Nostalgia aside, there is a reason for it- The food, and the unbelievable prices they come at! Located bang in the middle of park street with so many  (in)/famous joints around it, BBQ has managed to hold onto its clientele and entice some new ones over the years. The place itself is beautifully furnished with the vintage dark wood fittings and tables. I have always found the place to be neat and clean, irrespective of how many people have trampled in and out throughout the day!

There is a nice variety of Chinese food to pick from and pork lovers, take heart, plenty for you to choose from. There is a decent number of duck and lamb dishes to choose from as well, which makes my hungry tummy very happy :) 

The best thing about this place is that though the waiters are old timers, they are very happy to be there and happy to change things in food as well as drinks as per your specifications. 

It serves liquor and at affordable rates too! The bartender makes a killer Bloody Mary, a recco from me.. Cant say the same about the Margarita. 

Visit with friends and/or family over the weekends for a lazy lunch, be a little early so that you can grab the tables by the windows.. Makes for a very pretty setting!

I couldnot stop myself from giving it a 5star. Its not about the food only,its about the budget friendly awesom food in an area like parkstreet. If you are a fisholic like me, try 'fish with mushroom and vegetables ' there .. Also love the barbq special rice.
My recent visit has changed my opinion very much. We tried (1)crispy chilli baby corn: spicy n crispy and moderately tasty (2)veg noodles and tsing hoi chicken: both were really tasty.
(3) schezuan rice and hot n garlic fish: My all time favourite rice and fish arrived at the last. With high expectations I had my first bite and it was a serious disaster.
The rice was hard and not well cooked .(maybe it was not fresh). We asked for a replacement and the next rice dish was even worse.
The fish item really had no taste. It was the worst thing I have ever had there.

Bar-B-Q is one of the food trinity of Park Street, besides Mocambo and Peter Cat. The restaurant is par excellence be it in food, quantity or price. Their Indian and Chinese fare are equally appetizing. On most days and certainly on weekends, it is overcrowded. But seating is decent and spacious, service- timely and the food and ambiance, just perfect to while away idyllic time with friends or family, indulging over some great food. A must visit for all food lovers. I specially love their Chinese, it is just right in every way. The Indian is worth a mention too. Nothing on the menu will leave you disappointed.

The best thing i like about bar-b-q is the quantity!! It is Infact more than enough!! 
Though i haven't been there too many times,, i loved their spicy chicken wings. Its finger lickin good. The rice and noodles are pretty good though i usually prefer the rice. It has a large amount of filling and is irresistible :-D.  Among the side dishes i loved the manchurian pork.

Bar-b-q is authentic chinese:-)

Bar-B-Q is one of the most talked about eateries among Park street. Be it price, be it taste, be it service, Bar-B-Q topped almost in all sections.
  
 Location:  First come first, it is in the side where Mc.Donalds restes and opposite of Flury's. Floavors of china is one of the section of main BBQ. 
 
 Section: It has mainly two sections, Chinese and Indian. When you enter you can found a large hall with good interior and spaced out tables. Left section dedicated for Chinese and right for indian or mixed. When full you can opt for Flavors of china.
 
 Red color is the main theme here but balanced with some mute colors. Decor is at par, not cramped at least.
 
 
 Ambiance: On weekend or after 8 on weekdays too, you will find long queue in the staircase. Sometimes it is calm, sometimes it is noisy depends on the crowd. But all in all a family one.
 
 Food: Most of the items here good depends upon you're luck. Mixed rice to Chilli Chkn. most ordinary items can be mind-blowing here. But Special Bar-B-Q dishes are always good. In the startes Drums of heaven, Crispy Conjy Chkn, Dry Chilli chkn really good. Kung pao chkn, Tsong hoi chkn are very good in the gravy section. Almost all Noodles and rice dishes are good. Portion is ample. Indian section is also good. You can try Tikka butter masala, Chello kebab, and other kebabs too.

 Price: It is not over-priced. It is rightly priced I can say.

 BBQ, you must try, if you are on park street and want good food in a reasonable price.

i paid yet another visit and same i loved the food again. it was a reunion with besties and what other better place to choose than BAR-B-Q.bar-b-q special fried rice just mesmerizes me with it's rich flavor and the fried pork addition to the rice is just awesome.i strongly recommend people this one on every single visit :) because i am already in love with it. this time though i tried a different starter red chilli prawns , it was just too tasty to resist.very soft, chewy, so fresh and the entire plating is complete appetizer .so was the side dish i chose along with bar-b-q special fried rice , kung fu chicken- soft chicken chunks with thick gravy , delicious , rich chinese flavor .this visit yet again paid off , ofcourse not to forget the hospitality of the inmates and service top class

this place is a family dining perfect destination ,also if u feel u have guests coming from outstation want to take them to a good place i strongly recommend. Affordable and good quality food no wonder is a strong combination, BAR-B-Q has it all. i made a last visit on may1, 2013 on my papa's birthday ,it was indeed a good time we all spend together. Though it remains crowded most of the time , take time and leave. happy dining to all!!

This place is still unbeatable in terms of consistency in my opinion. The serve one of the best versions of Indian  Chinese Food in the city and have been doing so for years !  I was down with a sore throat so was in a soupy mood and hence we headed there Veg Man-chow Soup , Chicken Wanton Soup and  American Corn Pepper Salt followed and made for a perfect meal. 
The Veg Man-chow soup was excellent as per my co-diner and I can honestly say that the Chicken Wanton Soup was absolutely perfect .... I loved it ! The American Corn was Crisp and flavorful and she ended her meal with the Tutti Frutti. 
The Mixed Fried Rice or Hakka Noodle , American Chopsuey , Sliced Pork , Chilly Chicken , Veg Manchurian , Chinese Salad and Red Pepper Prawns are also very good. This place is highly recommended both for its flavors and for its pricing. Please note that it tends to be very crowded at peak hours and you may have to wait for a bit for a table.

----- 02 Jul, 2013 -----

Bar-B-Que is one of my all time favourite eating places but somehow most of the time when I go end up ordering from the  Chinese Section. After ages I ate an Indian meal there as the friends I had gone with wanted to eat indian food that day. We had a delicious meal as usual. Mutton Saag , Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala , Channa Masala , Paneer Butter Masala combined with a combination of breads - Kabuli Naan, Butter Naan and the Garlic Naan. Ended with the Tutti Frutti.
NOTE TO SELF - Eat the Indian food more often - Yummy Stuff !!

----- 07 Aug, 2012 -----

This place on Park Street, is the holy trinity of eating for me, along with Mocambo and Peter Cat! 
Simply love the Chinese food. The American Chop suey, Chicken Wantons and Sliced Pork are must haves. The rest of the Chinese dishes are worth trying as well. 
I dont ever remember having a bad meal here. 
The Indian too is excellent. Love the Kabuli Naan, Kali Dal, Dry Channa Masala and Panner Butter Masala.  The Chicken Bharta and Reshmi Kebab are excellent as well. 
The affordable pricing is an added bonus.

Went to this place quite a few days back and had a pretty good experience. The food is great and the price is also decent. I has a great lazy ambiance which is perfect for a quiet lunch out. 
The only hing that bothered me was the service. Having been to the other restaurants around it, I feel the waiter and managers could be more amicable and quick in terms of delivery of the order.

Bar-B-Q, a big name for chinese food in Park st area. I have been there couple of times with my wife. Its a two-storied place, with the family section upstairs. Well decorated, well maintained place with good quality chairs & tables. We ordered chicken noodles soup, chicken fried rice & garlic pepper chicken. The waiter received our order within minutes, and it was served also within 10mins. Food quality was excellent. Soup was excellently prepared, as were the rice & main courses. The most striking thing is the amount of food they offer. Its just too much, even for two of us. Almost half of the rice was left along with some chicken. We asked the waiter whether it was possible to pack rest of the food, to which he readily agreed. No excess charges were billed for packing. Overall thoroughly enjoyable experiences....

In my opinion: 
Food quality - 5/5
Decor/Ambience - 4.5/5
Staff attitude/behavior - 4.5/5
Value for money - 5/5

Overall - Excellent!!

Bar- B-Q. A restaurant well known among Calcuttans. Renowned for its great chinese food. I first went to Bar B Q with my family and family friends when I was still in school. I had a nice experience that time.
I went to Bar B Q with my boyfriend on 26th of January, 2014. It was about 1 pm when we entered. We went upstairs, and a waiter guided us to a table for two.
I like the decor of the place. Seating is comfortable. But lighting could have been a little more brighter.
We ordered crispy chilli baby corn, chinese chopsuey, and chilli garlic pepper chicken(at the waiter's recommendation).
The items were served pretty fast. I somehow felt that the waiters seemed to be in a hurry. Anyway, the baby corn preparation arrived first. It was pretty delicious, although I personally found it a little too salty for my taste.
Not long after we finished the baby corn, the chopsuey and the chicken arrived. The chopsuey complemented well with the garlic chicken. Both the items were prepared well. Now I got a little adventurous and requested the waiter for chopsticks. :P He was quite surprised, but he gave them anyway. It was kind of fun, tackling the chopsuey and chicken with the chopsticks. :D
The bill turned out to be rs 687. We gave rs 700. The waiter took the sleeve containing the bill and money, gave a grumpy look, and went away. A few minutes later, he arrived with the balance amount. We did not leave a tip due to the VAT and service tax charged. The waiter took the sleeve, opened it, and then threw the sleeve at our table, demanding for tips. A little shocked, I left a ten rupee note and left the place.
A dining experience which was so good, was ultimately let down by the rudeness and high handedness of the waiters. I obviously did not like the way they blatantly asked for tips.
Ignoring the rude behaviour of the servers, Bar B Q is a nice place to dine out with your near and dear ones. :)
I would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Calcutta for the first time. :)

If you are a Chinese food lover and your taste buds are tingling For some authentic Chinese flavors, this is a must visit place for you.
I went there to celebrate one of my friends birthday. We took a cake with us. We gave the cake to them and asked them to bring it in a plate, but for this simple procedure we had to wait for 15 minutes.
A little disappointed with the service time we ordered for Bar-b-q special fried rice and some chicken side dish, but to our amazement order was served within 15 minutes.
Once the food touched our tongues, we were too carried away to judge anything else. That is the quality of Bar-b-q.
If you are planning for a treat at Park Street, just blindly go to Bar-b-q. Your friends will praise you and it wouldn't even be heavy on your pockets.
Keep up the good work of satisfying Chinese food lovers like this only Bar-b-q.

Bar-b-q revisited !!
Well this is not my first review for bar-b-q over here in zomato. I have been to this place several times and ofcourse I will continue getting into it. Last Saturday I opted this place for a weekend lunch with my girlfriend. Unlike the other visits I went upstairs and selected a descent place for us. But unfortunately that particular area of the restaurant was suddenly being occupied by a gang of ladies which made my friend disappointed(I was not though :P). Whatever, we were hungry and we had to eat and so we ordered the simplest and most common  items on earth. Fried rice and chilli chicken ! It came after a few while and this is what I like about bar-b-q that they don’t make you wait for a long when you are starving. No new words for the quality and it’s large quantity of food.
But I need to say a few things I observed last day. There should be different place for different type of visitors. Like, a couple having lunch just beside a birthday party is something odd. It does not look good when some college guys hop by some senior person too. They have plenty of space within the restaurant which should be valued. 
Well I am bound to say a little about the quality of chilli chicken. It was not the bar-b-q chilli chicken I used to have always. Is the quality decreasing ?? I hope I’m wrong because very few places in park street are in my list and I don’t want to shorten it. 
Anyways, keeping these points aside, I love this place when I’m with my friends. Bar-b-q did never let me down.


----- 30 Oct, 2012 -----

I am a frequent goer at bar-b-q of park street. This place is both good for hanging out with friends and munching with family. The food quality and ambiance are also good. The main attracting feature of this restaurant is that the price of alcohol is very cheap in comparison with any other restaurants located at park street.

Bar-B-Q is perhaps the only reasonably pocket friendly place in Park street,. I go there often to try the Chicken in Black Mushroom and Corn and my favorite Pan fried noodles there!! i think that's there best. Also, the Lat Me kai chicken is delicious!! Devil's chicken is good too if you like chili flakes on your food. :)

Though being an out and out foodie, didnt visit this restro much..Last puja visited for some quick snack..This Christmas, especially reading such  positive comments, 6 of us planned to visit.. Yes.. It was a very wrong decision indeed..!! I can understand a restro in Park Street will b packed up in Christmas.. Still we were patient and happy 2 wait in a queue..When we got a seat, six of us were offered a table that would actuallly accomodate 4.. We were still OK.. Now started the mishap.. We ordered some Indian starters(kebabs) and Chinese main course, nothing unusual..We were hungry.. Kebab was served in time and taste was decent..The person who took our order suddenly disappeared.. we kept on calling the waiters to remind them about our order...Everytime received assurance that it will b served soon.. We waited for almost an hour..By that time a new batch of customers came,finished their food and went away..Bt we kept on waiting..We went and talked wid manager finally.. He jst answered it needs 10 mins.Again we waited for 20 mins.. I went to manager and cancelled our order..He didnt even bother 2 say a simple SORRY after the harassment.. Ppl workin over there seriously needs to know how to behave..Undertrained staffs I must say...I will suggest not to acccommodate so many ppl wen u cant serve them properly...Will never visit this place and recommend others not to visit during festivals..Later that day, we opted for Mocambo..Yes, it was well crowded..We again waited in a queue... Bt yes,management was awesome...

For the first time i was left in UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT. 

When we were served plates, half of them were dirty and it was really disappointing that no one was coming on the table to take orders. We had to literally call people to take orders. 

I had visited bar b q today with few of my friends on my friends birthday party (not the flavours of china part) and had ordered the following:-

1) Hakka chicken - which was chicken totally dipped in corn flour and served with green onions and red hot chilli's. It was not as the Hakka chicken i expected and failed to live up to my standards. Don't go for it as a starter. Its not worth the penny. 
2) Veg dahi kebab - which was fine. However, they forgot to give us the chutney along with it. 
3) Paneer tikka- Which was served to us hot. However, the waiter was serving as if he is drunk. 
4) Chana Masala- They served us fine but the chutney was served after like 15 minutes when half of the dish had already finished. 
5) Baby corn was a signature. However, no innovations till now. 

For the first time, when i wanted to order mocktails. I saw barbq lacked in mocktails. There were total of just THREE mocktails out of which i had ordered somewhat a khus with a lemonade. Believe me, i was served in a normal glass with soda and masala on top. This is how a class restaurant serves you a mocktail for which we had to pay a bomb somewhat like 140 bucks? It was an utter disgusting situation. 

The service was absolutely disgusting. The staff who was serving us seemed to be drunk and even served us the same used up spoon which was like DISGUSTING. I have never expected in my wildest dreams that barbq would be so bad with us. I would always prefer to visit the Flavours of China part and not barbq at all. They failed to serve us with a smiling face FIRST TIME. However, i really did not enjoy the ambience much too of barbq this time. However, flavours of China has a much better ambience.

As a customer, i wanted to take my revenge. I added chutney to the hot lemonade water for washing hand and even the glasses along with some soya sauce and lemon and left the place. They had seen how disgusted i was and how ashamed i wanted them to feel. 

Disgusting. Unexpected. Utter Shock.



----- 05 Oct, 2013 -----

Bar-B-Q - I don't think I need to describe its location whatsoever because this place in itself is a GEM. You go at whatever time in a day here, you will always find it crowdy providing prompt and excellent service with no negligence AT ALL. It is one of the places in town which has not had service problems or failed to live up to customers expectations even after handling such a big crowd of people. It can be referred as a fantabulous place for all types of groups- be it a family get together, friends get together or old people meet. This is only possible because of the reasonable prices at which they provide us with food allowing everyone to afford it. Not just that, a lot of foreign visitors and tourist also visits this place. Discussing the pros and cons hereby under :-

Pros:-
1) Caters to a large number of tables.
2) Service is always uniform and quick.
3) Food is delicious and served hot with proper quality standards maintained. 
4) Serves Indian and Chinese cuisines at its best. 
5) First class ambience. 

Cons:-
1) No innovations in dishes taking place. 

Last time I went I.e. approximately 1 day back I had decided to try vegetarian food so ordered Schezwan fried rice with baby corn manchurian. The rice was definitely good but I did not like the baby corn because it was very tender and lacked crisp and it seemed like crispy baby corn just fried with the sauce and served. It costed 442 approximately for two of us. However,  I expected something better from Bar-b-q with regards to baby corn.  

Overall, awesome as always. :)



----- 25 Jun, 2013 -----

I again had visited barbq today. And today I thought of trying something different. I ordered dal Bukhara, a mix vegetable and chicken Reshmi butter masala wd tandoori rotis. 

As usual, the food was good even though its famous for Chinese. 

The only con I noticed today was when I used the cloth napkin or rather opened it it was dirty. I never saw thing before in any restaurant. 

Neways mismanagement can always happen. 

Btw overall experience was awesome. :) 



----- 01 Jun, 2013 -----

Excellent food with proper service at decent prices with great ambience. Both the Chinese and Indian food are at perfect quality. For boozing, it's cheaper than other restaurants in park street. For non veg Chinese lovers , one must try burnt garlic/ginger fried rice with Kung Pao chicken. Awesome place to dine out with family.

Walked in at the eve of first weekend of new year. The environment was a mix of Jhinkoo and Classy.
The chemistry with the Stuarts, Bar tenders was at per.

We discovered some nice Crispy Chicken and Sweet Babycorn and Non veg Chimney Soup there.

Will be again there  to try the other items in the menu. I will Suggest this place for Hangout with friends and Family. As they have separated the environments very well.

Before you read ahead let me tell you, I love BAR-B-Q food.

Heading - - - The only time I did not tip at BAR-B-Q

There was a time service too was important with the food being served at BAR-B-Q,this I feel to an extent has changed. This realization set in in the recent visit I had with my girlfriend to this iconic restaurant, which is synonymous with the iconic street it is on.

It was a chilly Saturday and we were undecided , whether to go for Indian or Chinese. A wise friend once said, when in confusion BAR-B-Q is the place. So we went and thankfully didn't have to wait before we got a table to ourselves. And thus began the worst 32 mins experience at BAR-B-Q (yes we kept the time for how long I can stay there).

The food without doubt was great. Chinese salad, soups, crispy chilly babycorn... the only sad part was, it was cold and somehow an AC duct was near to our table. At first I thought, with all the fat I have and the winter wear, I'll survive the cold and AC went. But it soon became unbearable to sit at this ill-fated 3 seater table in the mid section of this restaurant.

I genuinely requested the waiters to change our table to some other table which was available, to this the waiter serving us an the floor manager at that time said "If you do not want this table you can leave and go else where, people are already waiting". After this our order took an eternity to reach our table, maybe I pissed them off by my unusual demand to lower the AC down a bit. Our requests to lower the AC went unanswered, until we had no option to eat our starters and leave midway.. 

Felt like this place had become into an assembly line restaurant.. you come, order, you eat... where has your service gone? because last time I checked, the customer/eater's comfort was really important.

But again, the food is always great. Just falling short of service though.. buckle up guys... :)

Barbeque is a classic case of amazing Indian food + amazing chinese food + Too many people waiting to eat there. the fact that so many people crowd around the place to get a table should itself be reason enough to go try out the restaurant. Yes it is a fine dining place and yes I love the food every time I go there. I particularly enjoy the garlic chicken, the pepper chicken and the chicken hakka noodles. However, the North Indian food should also be tried in this place. butter naan with chicken butter masala is a marvel. It is impossible to comprehend how the chefs manage to roll out such tasty dishes while serving hundereds of people every hour. I am a big lover of this place and always make it a point to visit it once in a while!

Very organized service. Staff is very well trained. Dont miss dry chilli sliced pork. Just out of the world. However, chilli babycorn is more of fried babycorn. Meifoon is great. But wish they would have removed the prawn elementary canals as they are not good for health. Shereaded lamb gravy was too small in size. They might consider providing some bigger chunks. Overall, v good experience and lively ambience.

Some restaurants are above reviews - this is certainly one of them!

This is part and parcel of the culture and heritage of Kolkata. I think,in Bengali culinary terms, after Misti Doi, Rosogulla and Bhetki Maach, if there's anything that would come close in terms of hype and hoopla, this would be it!
Located in a superb spot bang on Park Street, this place  has superb connectivity . The access to the actual restaurant space is via a wooden staricase which might not be the most comfortable option for people with leg problems, but thats about the only thing that one can deduct half a star from the rating ! 

The ambience is delightful and charming and can easily make one feel at ease with the classiness of it all. The service is exemplary - waiters from all over India should come here for a refresher course and learn how to be respectful, polite and informative whilst managing a raging crowd of 500 with 300 people waiting to rush inside!

Coming to the main aspect - this restaurant serves the best Indian and Chinese food in the city. Their Sweet and Sour Chicken gravy is worth traveling 3000 kms for ! I have done it so I can very well claim it! All the regular items and all the not so common place ones are all extraordinary and delicious and are to be devoured to be savored! 

All in all , I think that a generic review works best for this place since I cannot recount all the wonderful meals that I have had here since it will not even do adequate justice to my second favourite restaurant in the whole world! ( My favourite is right across the road BTW )

Okay the first question which would come to a persons mind is even though I will appreciate the plate, but the period of waiting  and often the behaviour i repeat often by the attendants is a little disrespectful. 

Now, the review goes as usual. The cuisine is flawless. And the value for money is quite reasonable. But for upper-Middle class people like myself and students such place are a bit luxurious. Saying that i would say it might be affordable.

I visited here for the first time with my parents and we were really treated well. The person who waited upon us was really good and he managed to help us with the menu realizing it was our first time. Kudos to them.

Second time I went along with my Girlfriend and ordered a starter of Kebabs, a normal Indian main Course and finished of with a Ice-cream. The Ice-cream appealed to my better half quite well. I am no judge of Ice-creams. But the person who served us was least interested in knowing what is to be done. Though we dined in the wee hours of opening but still I feel we were invisible to him. 

Still a go ahead. So for people like myself, Indian middle class.. the place is 'affordable often'. Because money does matter. :)

For me n my family good food with great ambience have always meant bar b q . Love both Chinese as well as the Indian cuisine served by them but its primarily the Chinese that makes them special ... The known faces of some of the staff with their ready to help attitude welcoming the guests make me go down memory lane .... Any guest visiting Kolkata must visit this place if they care for good food ... And all of this in spite of increasing competition over the years ... Kudos to the team ....

********* Update from 15 May 2014
My wife wanted lunch here, and so walked in a very hot Thursday afternoon. Got ourselves a window seat. Nice service. The steward was very attentive and polite and the server too was at par.
Lovely Fresh Lime Soda, though the soda was a bit flat. The Crispy Fried Chilli Chicken was passable. The onion in it had a stale smell. I expected a dry chilli chicken and it was not. Was closer to their Lat me Kai. The American Chopsuey was substantial, and though too sweet, quite filling. The prawns were not de-veined though. Ended with Tutti Frutti... always a pleasure.
Some cutlery was dirty. The starter was Rs 225 and the Mixed Chopsuey Rs 155. Made no sense as the starter portion wasn't anything terribly huge.
A good meal though :)

-------------------------------------- 
 
Walked in on a early Monday afternoon. Lots of space and we got our desired table adjoining the large glass windows facing Park Street. The service for one was almost impeccable. The person who took our orders and looked after us was courteous, efficient and helpful.

Started off with Chicken Sweet Corn Soup and Chicken Coriander soup. The sweet corn was the best I have had in a long time, and I suddenly did not miss the coriander which I just tasted. After my sweet corn it tasted almost foul! As per the server's suggestion we tried the chicken fried wantons. Nice! They were crisp, yet soft. Almost melt in your mouth. My daughter loved them. The Chinese tea was a bit cold.

Main course consisted of a Szechuan chicken (nicely done, spicy yet tasty) for my wife, and a double fried pork for me. The pork was nice, but a bit on the sweeter side. I should have asked for a chilli pork I realised. They did not have that on the menu so I didn't even ask. But it was still nice. We had that with chicken pan fried noodles. Light, tasty and not too oily! We were full halfway through our meal and packed the rest. It was almost sufficient for dinner for the two of us.

A nice pleasant no trouble experience. Just how it should be. And with a bill of about 1,500, it was not as expensive as some other places tend to get.

Bar-B-Q...  always dependable. Always recommended. Never had a terrible experience here. The place for safe Chinese food.

Old world Park Street charm is written all over BarBQ. Two words for this restaurant - amazing place! Enter the restaurant and one will have to walk up an old and creaky staircase (people having knee trouble may find it a difficult though). Be prepared to wait on weekends especially in the evenings. But once you are in you are in for a treat. I have been to place many a times and have returned a satisfied and stuffed up to the throat human being. The last time I went there was in a large group of about 8 to 10 people and all of us thoroughly enjoyed the food and of course each others company. We started off with chicken wings and crispy chilli baby corn. The chicken was good but the baby corn was just out of the world. Then we went for a few plates of sliced chilli pork. That too was in a league of its own. The colour of the dish is what draws on in before anything else. It really looks pretty and colourful with different kinds of sliced bell-peppers. There is no doubt that it looks good but what's important is that it tastes even better. Moving on to the main course we went for the BarBQ special fried rice and the mixed fried rice both of which were quite decent and tasteful but the pork sweet and sour, prawns in hot garlic sauce and kung pao chicken were all really really good and we were forced to re order them all despite the quantity being more than generous. By the time we were done all of us were finding it difficult to move. I was quite eager to try the caramel custard but there was not a millimeter of space left in my tummy. There's always a next time. The servicing is pretty much acceptable and courteous. At least most of the people I have met have been courteous, only on a couple of occasions I might have encountered high handedness on behalf of the staff much like Mocambo, but that really doesn't matter as it might have been 1 out of ten times. The decor I absolutely love. The old world charm and the dimly lit atmosphere and the seating arrangement on the loft where and moderately tall person would find it difficult to stand upright all have a charm of their own. There's no way one can miss BarBQ when it comes to dining out in and around Park Street.

I visited bar b q on the 12th of December and I have visited this place many a times before. I always had had a good experience but today it was horrible. The glasses in which water was served was dirty and unhygienic. The sevice was terrible. The food quality has a also deteriorated. I am very unhappy with the kind of experience I had today. The waiters were very inattentive. We waited for about 20 minutes for the bill(20714). I would be happy to visit some other place but before going to bar b q I will have to think twice

I went to Bar B Q last month for the first time to attend an anniversary dinner of my boyfriends sister and I loved it! We ordered starters at first and the mouth watering "Crispy Chilli Baby Corn", "King Prawn Pepper Salt" and "Drums of Heaven" is still glued to my tongue! For the main course I had "Chicken Rice Noodles", "Kung Pao Chicken" and "Shredded Lamb"! All the dishes were cooked in the best possible way and I had no complaints with any of them! The huge space of the Restaurant adds to the refined taste of the cuisines available here and Bar B Q is a hit for me! I would love to visit this place again in the near future and would recommend this to all who love eat Chinese!

Well, my first encounter with this place happened quiet recently actually. It was a friend's birthday and being in a mood for Chinese, the three of us headed for Bar-b-q. The place is impossible to miss and stands proud among the restaurants in Park Street. We were seated at the 'Flavours of China' section. The place exudes an old world charm. A place where you instantly feel good.....grand but not imposing. :)

Coming to the food.....We ordered the Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken for starters. It arrived in a while...and was a superb preparation. It does exactly what an appetizer is supposed to.....keep you craving for more ! Next we moved on to the main course. We had ordered:  Bar-b-q Special Fried Rice, Mixed Chowmine, Chilli Chicken Boneless and Sweet & Sour Prawns. And believe me, the quantities of the dishes were a lot ! We had to literally struggle to finish it....but yes, it was one delicious struggle ! :)

The Fried Rice tasted good, filled with plenty of prawn and chicken....and made a great combination with the Chilli Chicken. But the Mixed Chowmine was way better and  honestly yummy ! The one disappointment was the Prawn preparation....It was just too sweet. The gravy tasted more like very sweet tomato ketchup ! But the Prawn balls itself were well made....and overall, it turned out to be a very good meal. In the end, we were full and satisfied. Looking forward to my next visit already.....Well deserved 4 stars from me. :)

The only cons that was notified there, that it is too crowdy. Now if you think in the other way,its not a cons because it signifies loads of foodies coming to enjoy their food..

Tips:-  Go with a gang of friends or with family. Never with couple..

The floor space is enormous! There's separate Indian and Chinese sections, plus there's seating in ground and mezzanine floors. Food quality is average, no specialties as such. Staff count is less. Food takes around 20 minutes to be served. All in all  you will have a pretty average time out when you are here.

Exceptional food at good pricing,  the menu has stayed the same for quite a while,  Chinese classics and Indian specialties. The kebabs are a must try,  the Indian breads are really tasty and the Chicken Bharta is awesome. 

The quantity of food is a lot for Chinese dishes. The food may be heavy and enriched with buttery goodness but its not spicy,  which is good.

Bar-B-Q is like my second home. I have been going to this restaurant since childhood and I must say I have not gotten over it. I love the food, the ambiance, the balloons (special mention) and almost everything about it. The price is reasonable unlike other expensive restaurants in park street! Golden fried prawn and chicken fried rice is my favourite. Its an ideal place for family gatherings and friends too. Basically its a place for everyone. The only problem with it is its over crowded all the time and especially on the festive seasons. But thats not something to blame. A place like that is ought to be crowded.

Bar-B-Q has been a favorite of mine since forever. I love the ambiance and the food is consistent. 
I definitely prefer their Chinese menu over the Indian. I wish they stuck to being a Chinese restaurant rather than introduce an Indian section. Lately, that has been a turn off for me - I prefer my favorite restaurants to stick to what they do best.
I love most everything from their food menu and from drinks, I can not remember a time when I had anything other than their Bloody Mary.

A teenage favorite place. My first ever date was planned here. They are located at the heart of the city, Park Street. and as teenagers lots of birthday treats used to be planned here. My parents used to love the place. In fact is is sometimes impossible to get a place to eat here on weekends causing huge queues and long waiting hours . 

The staff here is polite and remembers the regulars well. They have a well stocked bar and the service is prompt and quick. 

The Chinese food is nice especially the crispy chili baby corn and the conjee crispy mushroom . I have never really had any bad experience here ever and they have always made good food and served us well.

Bar-b-q has etched many wonderful memories and thankfully has never dissapointed me YET.
The ambience is very pleasant, the spacious couches and the dim lights all set up a very nice mood. I always opt for beer when I am dining here.

I really like their chinese preparations over the indian and yes I always order chinese :P

The staff I must admit are very attentive and extremely courteous. The somehow prefer BBQ over Flavours of China. 
The rice/noodles of either mixed, or chicken and with that a side of chicken sweet n sour, garlic chicken or just plain chilli chicken sided with a beer would just make my day. It still does and I am hoping it always will.

BBQ specializes in every dish that they make. I also love their pork noddles. The pan fried one. Really tasty. I usually prefer gravy gravy noodles and BBQ has always lived up to my expectations :)

Will be back for more.
Till then, happy eating guys.
Cheers! :)

Bar B Q is one of those restaurants that will put a smile on your face every time you utter the name or make a plan to have a meal with friends and family. I have been visiting this place for the last couple of years (at least once every 2 weeks) and I have never seen a single day where the seats and tables are empty. Whether it's lunch, post-lunch or any time of the day, Bar B Q is always full and happening.

The family restaurant cum bar is situated on the first floor whereas there is a bar for bachelors on the ground floor as well. I generally stick to the ground floor area since I visit Bar B Q with my friends. The food is very tasty and resists anyone to order more. The drinks are priced reasonably allowing you to have an extra peg or two without thinking twice.

One weird thing I noticed about the ground floor is that after 7.30PM they actually dim the lights. Well, let's just say it allows you to get in the mood of drinking even more. There is a stairwell on the ground floor section that allows you to access a few tables situated on top. I woudn't recommend you to sit there though (because of the AC blower situated directly below your head).

The top floor restaurant is divided into two section (Chinese & Indian) but on busy nights they serve both everywhere. I love the buzz, the collaborative noise of chatter all around which makes you feel more hungry. The service is excellent and the waiters actually make you feel special. If you are a little regular or you are starting to be a regular then you will be pampered even more.

Bar B Q is one of those restaurants that completes the aura of Park Street. I suggest you visit this place (if you haven't already) and I think you will have a tasty contemporary restaurant experience.

This one is my favourite amongst all the other restaurants in Park Street. 
Please don't mind if i'm biassed, but Bar-B-Q is special.

One of the best places that serve chinese, it is a wonder lust.
The ambience is like any other fine dine restaurant, efficient lighting, helpful waiters and managers, to say the least.
It is huge, so this is one place you can bank on finding a place if you are looking to have dinner on a Sunday night with your family. 
Carefully assisted by the waiters, we sat comfortably in a coushioned chair with the AC air making for a perfect temperature. The menu card arrived, and it had a fare of both Indian and Chinese dishes in it, we went for Chinese and ordered Pan Fried Chilli Fish,  Burnt Ginger and Capsicum Rice, Shredded Lamb and King Prawns in hot garlic sauce. 

The fish arrived in 7 mins, the fillet fish was big, full of meat. The burned pieces of garlic on top in a rich fiery sauce! The moment I took a bite, off the fish.. it instantaneously melted inside my mouth! It was surreal. a perfect start to a perfect date with perfect food.
Next up, the rice. The burnt ginger had a spicy flavour in the rice with shredded capsicum providing relief. A perfect balance of flavours, and yummy. the quantity i must mention is more than enough for two! 
Lastly the Lamb and the Prawns. Starting with the lamb, the gravy was sinful. So rich and had the right balance of flavours that it made me lick my finger.  It wasn't very spicy, a bit sweet actually. It with the rice, made you beg for more, but i was almost full. Had to keep space for the prawns, Chingri as we bengalis call it, arrived shortly. 
The Prawns were huge, bigger than those served elsewhere but to my surprise soft and juicy. Juicy prawns are the most sinful things for a foodie, and here i was gulping down as many as I could, such bliss!
One of the best places to have food, in the city. And as we sometimes say, Bar-B-Q mein nahi khaya, ttoh kya kiya?

Went there on Sashti evening at around 7 for dinner. We had to wait for half an hour for our table. For starters we ordered drums of heaven. It stated heaven to us as we were all hungry souls. Then for the main course, mixed hakka noddles, mixed fried rice and garlic chicken. Everything tasted perfect. The quantity was more than enough for us four girls. We even had to parcel the noddles as half of the quantity was left. 
Bar-b-q has always been a treat for foodies like. Will be going back again and again.

Park street remains kolkata’s foremost dining district - "food street" as we call it with bunch of restaurants & pubs, its been a recreation zone for kolkatans right from the british era. Bar b q - one of the park street oldies, figures at the top of the list of every food-lover of the town, the reason being simple: good food coupled with good prices brings ready popularity. 

This extra-large restaurant can now seat 250 plus guests at any point of time. Despite this, on weekends and holidays there is a huge waiting queue here, there’s little one can do to ensure a table on time.

Interiors and ambience - gives a feeling about the heritage and culture of our city. The interiors give the old victorian look, but ambience is dominated by bengali chitter chatter. Divided into various sections, but irrespective of where you sit ; be assured of mouthwatering food! Of the decor, I love their wooden round tables with chinese horroscopes embossed on them, & oh yes , the red cushioned chairs . Mmmm…I badly love round tables for group dining! The only drawback of the place is that it can get  bit too noisy at times(Focus on the food and the noise will die down automatically!) .

The restaurant has gifted the food lovers with an exhaustive menu list that includes  Chinese and Indian. Though boasting off mainly with their chineese ,as the Indian menu is rather sparse, but the items are good enough, especially the Chelo Kebabs.  Don’t miss the “Bar” in the restaurant’s name - It has a purpose. That’s what draws the huge population who love their meals to be washed down with some strong liquid. From beer to rum and everything in between, you’d find it here. They also make cocktails, & very cost-effective ones at that.

There are many fond memories i have, of Bar B Q , but the current one was of pure bliss – our cousins meet 
 (5 girls we were) ,  from their chinese listings we chose - 
-drums of heaven & chilli garlic pepper chicken as starters
-barbq special fried rice , chicken fried rice , chicken schezuan chowmein
-with hunan chicken , kung pao chicken , sweet & sour prawns in the maincourse
-3 cocktails - screwdriver , tom kollins , bloody mary  ; cranberry & orange breezer
a long list for 5 girls -  me being the only voracious eater among them.we had to pack almost one-third of the delivered food.
okay, now for the food,the  chilli garlic pepper chicken was the show stopper.drums of heaven followed behind it with 8 pieces in each plate.the right amount of crunchiness with the proper punch of spices captivated our taste buds. the rice dishes here are must tries as well, heaving in quantity with chunky  meats (chicken, pork, prawn as well) and sliced  chinese veggies,with no compromise with the quality of rice, fluffy & flavoury - made us so happy :D both the plates of fried rice tasted similar and actually much better than the schezuan  noodles. the sides - the hunan chicken with shredded chicken in sweetish tangy gravy , kung pao chicken with cubes of chicken and cashew nuts in brown mid spicy gravy , and lastly the sweet & sour prawns were  etheral - the best prawn chinese preparation i had so far. recommendations for their chinese menu - is the heavy booklet itself . everything  mentioned there  is simply iconic! even the cocktails were just the perfect blends.

i deducted the .5 as sevice this time was bit laid back , but good enough. But park street heritage bar b q being  a reputed family restaurant on the food map of Kolkata because of their consistent food, quick service and incredible pricing , it deseves a whole 5. So, if you're craving a spicy Tom Yum Soup or a plate of Mixed fried rice, then walk right in ;)

p.s. my resuest to zomato is to upgrade the menu card, as prices recently are minorly raised (by 10 -20 bucks every dish)

Bar-B-Q is an experience which takes you to the vintage times when clubs organized dinner parties under one roof with people other than contemplating on the food, enjoyed the entourage all together..buzzing all around!! The food here is like...a connoisseur's delight! A gourmet's satisfaction!! Chinese..Indian..everything seems so perfect..with hospitality always at your reach..overall outstanding

I have been going to this restaurant since my early childhood, with my parents and just like Peter Cat they have maintained their style. Bar B Que is certainly one of my favourite all time Chinese restaurants, I definitely would recommend the Chinese food. Today after a very long time we decided to visit Bar B Que. We went there to celebrate the birthday of Soumitra Kumar Sahoo, one of my colleague alongwith our friend Vidyasagar Das. We ordered ‘Malai Chicken Kebab’ as starter and for main course I ordered ‘Prawn in Hot Garlic Sauce’ & ‘Bar B Que Special Fried Rice’, Sahoo and Vidyasagar ordered ‘Mutton Biryani’. The food was not as good as it was when the last time I visited. The quality of food and service might have deteriorated a bit after all these years that only the regular goers would agree with but the place is nevertheless worth going. The portions they serve were amazing quantity but honestly, I feel that the food is overrated. Still if you have never been there I would suggest just go there. It is an amazing family restaurant so drop in once if you haven't already.

I have been to this place quite a several amount of times and what I can say is it is always a great experience here!!
Its a damn big place to accommodate numerous people at a single time. Outwardly appearance of this place is quite good but the moment you step in you get a fully furnished restaurant going through busy hours probably every single time you visit the place.
The first experience as you get there are two guards greeting you with so much of a barbie smile on their faces, always!
You ask for a table and you may be asked to wait for at max 10 mins and there you are, inside the restaurant with great interiors, great staff with a friendly attitude, ambiance is great but sometimes it may get real noisy and none would like it.
Now the main part(the best part eventually), the food:-
In the taste challenge it stands up quite firm as well as the quantity challenge as per the pricing
Chinese dishes out here are just WOLLAH but regarding the North Indian food, well i have tasted better at some places
We started with Chicken Fried Wantons and Golden fried King Prawns- they were just great, starting from the seasoning to everything just balanced to tastes every bite
Our main course comprised of Bar-B-Q special Noodles and  Hunan Chicken- simply no words for the hunan chicken it was just perfectly spiced nor much nor less
and the dinner ended with a large gulp of tutti-frutti and just as always it was great
overall i always love being here weather with family or with girl-friend or with friends, every time the experience is just pleasant to look forward to be here once more...

Bar-B-Q is an extremely overrated destination. Dim lighting, unfriendly staff and mediocre food does not lend it a desirable quality. But their prawn specials at least partially redeems it.

Bar-B-Q is another great destination at Park Street for some great North Indian Food. One could be easily misled by its location into believing that the mouth watering dishes would come at a great price. In fact it serves these fabulous delicacies at quite affordable prices. We'd ordered Biriyani, Mutton Rogan Josh for the main course, and a non-veg platter (can't remember which :P ) for starters. The food was simply awesome to be exact. The Biriyani had just the right amount of spices and was not at all oily, just as I preferred. The Rogan Josh was to die for, with finely flavoured mutton, cooked and tenderised to exactly the right degree, again, just as I preferred. The Non-Veg Platter does not deserve much mention, though, as it is usually similar to what other competent restaurants have to offer. For desserts, we had ordered Chocolate Souffle, (and just in time, as those were the last two that they had!!), which simply transported us to food-heaven. Overall, these are my ratings:
Taste : 4.0
Quality : 4.5
Ambience : 4.0
Value for money : 4.0

Visited them for the first time at 12:30 AM. Happy to find that they were still open at midnight on Dussehra eve. Ambience was good. Gotta bit depressed when they told its a dry day. The food wasnt that impressive especially the Mughlai cuisine. The Qababs were good but the Biriyani wasnt.
Got a mixed experience :-| Visited them for the very first time tonight. The ambience was good. Somehow, got depressed when I was that its a dry day. Hospitality and Time taken to serve the food was impressive especially at 12:30 AM. Unfortunately, the quality of the Mughlai cuisine turned me off.... Shall try them once again especially during the non-festive season.

D puja's has made them curtail the menu to the shortest possible even though sum things were not available.. D commonest item paneer n if a restaur says its nt availble sounds lil odd... Otherwise it was a good dinner.. Amazing quantity , a dish is for 5-6 serves.. Baby corn was reallly disappointing.. I thot it could be tossed vid lil gravy rather than being too dry... I was searching 4 exotic vegies in pan fried noodles with schzewan... D staff's were reallly annoyed I guess all cuz they didn get the puja off !!!! Overall nice experience ...

It is the best restaurant you can visit if you are really very hungry and don't want to spend much money. It serves  both Indian and Chinese cuisine and both are pretty delicious. Even though I prefer Chinese over Indian food here. I went there with 3 of my friends and we ordered many dishes with soft drink and our bill only came to Rs 879  and we had to pack some of the dishes as we couldn't finish. Chilli garlic noodles and crispy chilli babycorn are one of the finest dishes here.

I dined yesterday at Bar-B -Que after a year almost. I remember  coming for our  Sunday lunch with my Dad when i was a kid and i always used to start with a reshmi chicken kebab. But then since i loved continental i always use to opt for that as then Bar-B-Que use to serve Continental...and i had the best Lobster Thumberborg in my life one fine Christmas Eve. 
   Coming back to the present , my best friend had two German guests with her and she wanted them to have Indian and so Bar-B-Que we chose as in Park street BBQ is the place one thinks first when it comes to Indian. 
    What caught eye of our German friends where the english garden windows adorned on the royal red wall.....the decor was " CALM" yet "Lively.. and every sitting arrangement is to meet every guests comfort to the par.
    We ordered Chicken Malai Kebabs as Starters and they where the best Chicken Malai Kebabs one could have. Main Course was:
Dal Bukhari which is a Pseudoname for Dal Makhani, Saag Paneer again a Pseudo for Palak Paneer, Fish Masala, Tandoori roti, Masala Kulcha and Tandoori Naan.

Now here i would tell you unlike other restraunts in Kolkata Tnadoori Roti and Naan Both Came with butter painted on them in abundance which was an instant ranker for me.
 The poignant white creamy cubes of paneer in a lustrous green spinash curry was a delight to watch and to have. The Fish Masal came with 4 huge pieces of ffresh bekti tandoored then submerged in a perfect spicy indian masaledar curry where every ingredient mingled up and concocted a gastranomical delight for its beholder (eater). The Dal Bukhari was just right but i have had better Renderation of this dish. 
We where transported to the tents of arab merchants while we allowed our tongues to indulge and savour every bit of the tastes these dishes emitted.

The bill was 1386 and that was cherry on the cake.

There are some places that you associate your childhood with and Bar-B-Q is one such place for me. This was the restaurant that my grad parents brought me to whenever i came to Kolkata to stay with them. I learnt what chinese food tasted like from this place. 
And now that i live in Kolkata myself this is my favourite place for a meal. The Chilli Garlic Noodles that they serve here are the best in the world. I have still to taste a better version of this dish.  The crispy chilli babycorn and the chinese salad have been all time favourites. This place in my opinion serves the best version of Indianized Chinese food, flavouful, spicy and absolutely a treat for the taste buds.

The Indian food that they serve here is also very good. The dal makhani is one of the best in the city.

Inspite of being a huge restaurant which seats more than a hundred at once, I have never found a table as soon as i went there. I have always had to wait for a table and that in my opinion is review enough for this restaurant.

Happened to visit this joint for a dine-in on a Saturday afternoon after a long hiatus.The first thing that got me dumbfounded was the crowd.After the long festive season in the city i was expecting a lean period and mostly empty joint.How i was mistaken!!!We entered the joint sharp at 1:15PM and it was almost full.Being just the two of us we were banished to some far-away corner on the top-most floor.Service was prompt.We ordered mutton galauti kebab and red pepper fish to was down our favourite poison-vodka.The mutton dish comprised of succulent lamb chops made of minced meat.It was awesome and delectable.The typical melt in your mouth kebabs.The red pepper fish was pan fried fish sauteed in spring onion,capsicum and green chillies.It was good but slightly hot for my liking.In the main course we opted for plain naan and chicken reshmi butter masala.The chicken dish was yum and comprised of cubes of chicken reshmi kebab cooked in a light yellow gravy.The dish was slightly sweet and not spicy at all.Quite fine i say.The naan as expected was soft,flaky and fluffy.Just right!!!
The mood spoiler was lack of munch-ons being served with the drinks.On being prodded they served us cheeselings.On asking for salted peanuts/chanachur the staff  came up with the lame excuse that it is served in the men's section only.Similarly they forgot to serve chinese sauce along with the fish starter dish.Prices are reasonable by Park Street standards.

This joint happens to be one of the most voted joints at Park Street on this site.And why not? There might not be a single Kolkatan who happens to be a foodie and not been to Bar-B-Q.This restaurant has been serving delectable cuisine for ages and their quality is still top notch.I happened to visit this place after ages.On this occasion i availed for take-away and ordered Indian dishes.Firstly the tandoori chicken was absolutely brilliant. Pieces of chicken were juicy,succulent and cooked in tandoor to perfection.However  a price tag of Rs 190/- for 2 pieces is on the higher side by Bar-B-Q standards i must say.The mutton keema and vegetable jhalfrezie was delectable and outstanding.In fact i had no idea that a simple veg dish could be that tasty. After all being a bong i have an obvious bias and preference towards non-veg dishes :) The masala kulcha and the butter naan were fluffy and soft as it should be.Heavenly indeed !!!! 
Please make it a point to visit this joint if you  haven't already. Trust me you will not be disappointed.

A Classic Restaurant which is in line with the most elite restaurants in Kolkata 'Bar-B-Q'
Situated in Park Street (Beside McDonald's), A Posh & Busy Location, once you enter the restaurant, you leave the hustle-bustle of the busy traffic & over filled side-walks.
Bar-b-q, serves Indian & Chinese cuisine, both are really something special, personally i have been going to this restaurant for over 10 years & am still excited about the taste of the place.
The service is Gold, along with bar drinks, whoose cocktails I would recommend.
A Monthly Visit To This Restaurant Is A Real Must People.

I have been there few times since my college days and during most of my holiday destinations to kolkata, my sweet hometown .Even my wife is a great fan of this restaurant . Truely speaking the location is fantastic and ambience is nice . 
             If you manage to get a table beside the window, you can get a nice view of park street in night.
Talking about the food, these people know one job really well . That is cooking chineese food catering slightly to indian tastebud ( more so towards bengalee). That does not mean that the food is not authentic chineese . It is .
        Their tandoori items also need a real mention, as they look very attractive and very mouth watering as well.
Price is slightly on the higher bracket, but considering the location and quality, i dont think it is going to be a big issue .
       Service is good but waiting time is unavoidable . so booking in good time is always recommended .
Enjoy .

This place is very crowded on sundays and holidays. I remember wating for 1.5 hours on an sunday evening.
Quaility, quaintity and taste is excellent and this the reason why this place is so crowded.

For starters both kebabs and chinese are good. Darsaan is their best selling dessert. It remains quite crowded though during evening but i'm sure you wouldnt mind it much. Try it out once and i'm sure you'd want to visit it again .

Bar-B-Q is everything you can expect from a great restaurant. Be it the service, the ambiance or the food, Bar-B-Q stands apart in all respects.

As soon as we (me & my girlfriend) went there, we were greeted warmly and led to a table. The ambiance was smooth and easy on the eyes. Clearly, this place looks fabulous at evening.

Now let's come to the food. We ordered A Chelo Kebab, A chicken Rice Noodles and a Konjee Crispy Chicken. Although they seemed under-stuffed, the service was prompt.

The Chelo kebabs were delicious. Although the chicken kebabs seemed slightly overcooked from the outside, the inside was tender and juicy just as anyone would expect. The Mutton steak kebabs were like nothing I have ever eaten before and were absolutely out of the world. As of today, I am sure that Bar-B-Q serves THE BEST Chelo Kebabs in Kolkata.

The rice noodles were equally great. Just the right amount of spice and oil, not much not less. And the quantity was huge, more than sufficient for any normal person and even for most of the over-eaters too, I guess.

The crispy chickens were a bit disappointment though. They seemed over spicy to me, although my girlfriend loved them too.

And while leaving, every waiter we encountered, not just the one who served us, thanked us for going there, which I have never seen in any restaurant I have ever been to before.

Over all, a very nice experience. Bar-B-Q proved it's worth as a place where the food is worth every last penny and more.

One of the best places in Kolkata to visit with family, friends or that special person.

Being in Kolkata i have never got a chance 2 visit here but finally i got my debut visit at Bar-b-q 2day. So lets discuss about decor, foods & service.

Decor & ambiance : Good but space between the tables were not good enough. Tables were very close to each other. So it seems very annoying when u hear some1's gossip from another table. & this place is a quite noisy. So in my opinion i give this place 4 decor & ambiance -->> 3 out of 5

Foods: Lovely!! The food they serve is amazing and honestly it gets difficult for even 2 people to finish it off.. & Quality is 2 good.. I've tried Tsing Hoi Chicken & Chicken Rice Noodles. Both were good. & Prices are reasonable also but in the case of hard drinks or cocktails u might get slightly disappointed because those are costly. So in food section I give 4 out of 5.

Service: The waiters are at their best when it comes to service.  & the service was little slow but the food made up for everything. I give 3.5 out of 5.

So finally I can give this restaurant a rating of 4 out of 5.

While i am writing this review i could see a rating of 4.0 on the top right corner of my screen based on 870 votes. Now that means something isn't it ???

For me, its a second home. The place has been serving calcutta since forever and yes i want to use "calcutta" not "kolkata" for bar-b-q. One of the most loved restaurants of every calcuttan living anywhere around the world. I know of so many people who do not stay here but whenever they come to the city, their first dining outside home would be bar-b-q. 

I would not talk much about food since in my view bar-b-q is not all about food but things beyond food which no other restaurant in the city could match. The restaurant is huge and divided into two sections. There is another third section by the name of flavors of china. There is a bar section in the ground floor as well. Managers are the same "young" people whom i have been seeing since my childhood. The decor has not changed much and is simple, elegant. The chinese astrology printed table mats is still a joy to read even after so many years. 

As for food, chinese is not completely authentic but very much to the liking of indian taste buds. Wonton soup is amazing alongside their crispy babycorn or a chinese salad. Red pepper paneer is my favorite starter from their whole menu be it indian or chinese. Many people have not tried this starter from their menu but i could guarantee that if you could try it once, you would be ordering it very frequently. Pan fried noodles is great. Potato and corn in hot garlic is what i order generally generally alongside my garlic fried rice.

Indian food is great too. The kebabs are nice. Paneer butter masala and kali dal alongwith the crispy butter naan can really make one go complete gaga over the food. Tutti fruity or a darsaan are the deserts ordered generally if we are not going to hobby center from here.

I think its vintage and same could be understood from the fact that inspite of being a huge place and having so many restaurants nearby, its always full during lunch/ dinner hours be it anyday of the week. So i would suggest one to reach the place at 12.30/ 7 p.m. when one could get a seat easily and enjoy the meal. Am going tomorrow for sure !!

Bar-B-Q - the restaurant located in a posh locality at the junction of Park Street, Kolkata. It could truly continue to maintain the quality of food and service .It has been the mostly chosen restaurant by folks for our corporate dinners at Park street. 

Yesterday was another day at Bar-B-Q that was certainly not good and at least myself and people I know wont visit ever again. Entering from the Bar-B-Q side gate around 7:30 PM the first hall was quite empty but one of the restaurant manager told that its family place so wont allow us to sit. Advised us to go to the next hall , at last we sat in the Chinese section , they told food is same accross restaurant whatever cuisine you order .

While ordering the food here, the waiter is suggesting always the chinese starters/main courses . Though we ordered one Kali mirch Kebab apart from the Chinese starters i.e. Sesame Chilli Chicken , Lat me Kai Chicken etc . I couldn't get the same taste from the Kebab as it was before i.e. tender and juicy .Than Went for the main course in North Indian and ordered Mutton Do Pyaza,Chicken Bharta and Butter Naan . 
Review comments :
a.Mutton Do Pyaza - 3 Tiny Pieces of Muttons(Soyabean Chunks) with Loads of Onion/capcicums
b.Chicken Bharta - Rich tasteless gravy with no minced chicken rather fiber chicken and loads of Oil

Still they have full seats and people waiting to dine outside . Good food that is why people come to this place or the name it has gained for serving and delighting people .I doubt the North indian Chef has changed or has forgoten preparing north indian food i.e. gravy/kebabs/kulcha etc . Asking the waiter he says confidently that food comes from the same kitchen. 

Coming to the bill part the table manager took more than  30 mins to get us the bill after repeititive requests .

Even I took a parcel of Chicken do Pyaza and masala Kulcha , which was terrible/horrendous as per my better half and she was asking is it really from Bar-B-Q in park Street???

Suggestion  : Folks roam around Zomato , there are plenty of restaurants around who serve good food  and  value for money .Making a name is no big deal , but maintaining the quality is quite a task!

One of my colleagues brought us here this Saturday ............... the cheerful ambiance was the first great thing I felt, a bit too noisy at times though .............. the service staff were really professional and up to the task ...............we ordered for the Chinese favorites like the Chimney Soup, Red Garlic Pepper Chicken, Drums of Heaven for the Starters along with Beer ...............and Special Fried Rice, Chicken Gravy Noodles, Pan Fried Chilly Fish, and HongKong Chicken for the main course and rounded up the meal with Darsaan .........each of the dishes were wonderfully prepared and the Red Garlic Pepper Chicken and the Dry Chilly Fish were just superb ! ............ would love to come back here time and again ............

Today we celebrated ma's bday over luncheon. Chinese her favourite cuisine and bbcue one of her fab restaurants.

The joint didn't disappoint. On the contrary, it was a great experience unlike the usual. The place was empty! Any kolkatan would know its absolutely unheard of to find this place empty at 2pm. Ganesh chaturthi the culprit, worked very well for us.

Starters - fried prawns , drums if heaven.
Juices, fresh lime sodas, beer. 
Cantonese mixed chow
Mixed fried rice
Prawns in garlic sauce
Red pepper garlic chicken

Tasty as always
Good portions ( had to take away most of the rice n chicken )

1900 bucks for 4 people!! Always easy on the pocket. 

No points for guessing why one has to Always wait for a table at this eatery

I prefer the Chinese food here to the North Indian, it is simply awesome, the sizzlers are top of the class and the quantity, quality, everything is the best.
The waiters are extremely good, courteous and helpful.

Have been to this place  with friends and family many time and every time this place raises my expectations every time. One of my favourites. The ambience is good. Comfortable seats. Waiters are polite. Lot of options in Indian and Chinese. Fast service. Located at a prime location in Park Street. 
Ordered noodles and asked for chopsticks. The waiter helped us in using the chop sticks. During christmas, valentines day and other occasions the place is decorated beautifully. During the pujas its difficult to find a table there impromptu. Nevertheless, this place is always worth the wait.

Bar-B-Q has been part of all my celebrations of life..big , small or insignificant...I love Bar-B-Q and love going back to this place. I have tried chinese in a lot of places in and out of Kolkata but have not really found a place which comes a close second to this chinese haunt. Also its a favourite and one-stop destination for a quick lunch.

Few restaurants in this city serve good quality Oriental cuisine at a less-pricey budget and Bar-B-Q is definitely among the top of them. I had been there at too many occasions; last time was a few months back. Neither the quality of food or that of their service strikes a low note ever. We tried Crispy Chilly Mushroom and Chicken Wanton soup for the starter and had Hunan Chicken, Kung Pao Fish and Mixed Hakka noodles for the main course. The general quality of food is always fantastic though, given their broad range of customers, they might now start to consider upgrading a few items like Mapo Tofu and the age-old Hongkong chicken - these items deserve a better variety. A little variation in the beverage section will help too, the cocktails have surely dated. But in totality, the Oriental section of this restaurant is a perfect choice for anyone wishing for a a fabulous Chinese food-experience.

Great place and amazing food. The place runs like a well oiled machine and the staff is prompt, polite and efficient. 
It is a bit noisy and that can either add to the ambience or be bothersome depending on your point of view.
I have been there on christmas day and the crowd was unbelievable. Even under those circumstances, they managed to find us a place and even accomodate our request for a change of table. Definitely recommended if you dont mind the inevitable wait before a table frees up.

BAR-B-Q. A once a month visit is a must to this place. Absolutely incredible chinese food, excellent value for money considering the location. Kind of a heritage in Kolkata's fooding culture. Service is really quick. Not a great Indian food section though and i would suggest to do away with the indian section and extend it with the chinese section to accommodate more (read unlucky) foodies especially during festivals and holidays. All in all a great place to visit..!!

Its comparable to none other in town!  Not even Pan Asia at itc or chinoiserie at the taj can match it's food quality, service and goes without saying the price!

Bar B q is certainly one of my favourite all time chinese restaurants, i definitely would recommend the chinese food, since there is so much of variety in there chinese. The indian section is not that hot. The service is real quick and when i say quick means real quick. Considering the fact that we ordered kung fung prawns and the szechaun chicken and lemon fish, mixed chowmein, meinfoon, and chicken fried rice, it was brought to us in flat 22 minutes as per my watch, and that is fast by any standards. The food was really yummy. It just took me and friends seconds to hog the food up.

good old bar-b-q is one of the traditional places of park street. smart n huge place always buzzing with a lot of people. i liked their chicken drumsticks along with the oyster sauce. the mixed fried rice with pork went well with the chicken in hot garlic sauce. but i love their noodles. we ended with chocolate fudge which was yummy. bt i think they should opt for those small glass bowls instead of the elongated glasses to serve the fudge.

Its difficult to imagine Park Street without Bar-B-Q as its quite the establishment. Its a large, buzzing restaurant, perfect for families, and I've attended quite a few of those here. The service is efficient and decent enough, but one can spend some time waiting. The decor is pleasant but a bit dated. The food itself is a very likeable Punjabi-Chinese hybrid, and although far from authentic, it does taste good. The starters are brilliant, as is the Manchurian. At its price point, the place is excellent value for money as well.

This is the best place for dining when the gang is huge. Great food in great amount actually!! I went with 7 friends for a treat, and I was really surprised to see how Bar-B-Q is sooo pocket-friendly!! I had estimated to spend double actually after seeing the elegant decor inside :P

However, the food was great..we ordered Baby corn and chicken starters, noodles, fried rice, chicken side dish and at last desserts. The best was Kung-pao chicken and Hong-kong chicken. Among desserts, Tutti frutti and Hot chocolate fudge was to die for!!

The servicing was slow, because of which two of my friends missed the desserts as they had to leave early. Apart from that, this is definitely the place to visit again with friends and family!!! :)

Before coming to the food, lets talk about the adjacent factors, as, everyone must have known by now that there can be no complaints regarding food at this place. I didn't mean that I have few complaints, just wanted to add up the pros. Its a huge, huge restaurant, which will not let you stand in a queue and kill your precious weekend hours. Then, hospitality. You enter, and you will find someone or the other guiding you till you get seated. Ambiance, window side, hall room, upstairs in AC, options available. No doubt they have utilized the space in the best possible manner.  And even though its so huge, I have never found it deserted, the kitchen never gets rest.

The crispy chilly chicken, my favorite. This is the must dish whenever I go there. Apart from that, I have tried almost all the available dishes. The Chinese items are better than the Indian in comparison, however, that's a personal opinion. But even the Indian dishes are worthy. Cost for the meal is healthy to pocket, it will never give you a gulp. It has a attached bar counter, but still, family has their own cozy space. 

Situated on park street, it competes with few of the other finest restaurants in town. But I remember how many times I have visited the rest, but not this one.

I Have been going here since forever. Being close to my house this was the to go place on park street for chinese / indian. Have always loved the food here. The Chinese salad and the veg fried wantons have been my favorite. However the last time I went with a friend , we ordered vegetarian fried rice and while eating it found chicken in our rice. We were disgusted and although he did replace the dish , a mistake like this is unacceptable. It was a crowded evening -YES! But it still does not justify this kind of mistake. 
Haven't gone there since the incident.

One of the most popular restaurants in Park Street. They serve Indian as well as Chinese quite well. The cost for 2 is not that much high as mentioned in the Zomato page (unless you are trying out many items). Went there several times with family and friends. Still love the place and its food. Main drawback is on weekends you have wait outside to get a table, though that's common case for almost all the popular restaurants in Park Street.

consistent quality..overflowing customers ensures fresh delectable fare everytime.

I being a veggie...frequent this place since my school days and could swear by its chinese starters and indian main course . American corn pepper salt..Chinese bhel and babycorns are favourite. .tsing hoi potatoes wid corn and cashewnuts with chilly garlic noodles are full of flavours and mouthwatering. 
for indian the standard paneer tikka with malai kofta and tandoori shall never disappoint.

all in all it gives a club feel overflowing with abundace of cheer and memories. .a must go after every few months for  me..quite pocket friendly so a good place to throw treat for any special occasion.

This has always been my 'go-to' place. Maybe no review will actually do justice to the type of food served here. Order whatever you want, and they will not mess it up. Food is very good here. Even time taken to serve on a jam packed Saturday Evening is very fast. Cordial staff and a very cozy interior makes it really comfortable! It might be a tad to loud, but i think that's how it is when you put a lot of Kolkata people in a large room with food. No doubts, that it is completely full of life.

Coming to food,  drum of heaven, crispy fried chili chicken and anything in prawns in really good! Singapore Chicken, konjeee crispy chicken and devils chicken are really a must try.  Have tried out their Indian set as well. The naan they make are standard! Nothing to crave about. The rogan josh and the dhania murg are something that can be enjoyed thoroughly. Really tasty and must be tried!

Tooty Frooti, Darsan cake and hot chocolate fudge are really good and a perfect end to an amazing dine out!
Enjoy.

Cheers!

I have simply lost the count of how many times I have visited this veteran restaurant, which can be considered one of the most prime addresses in Kolkata. It is centrally located and the interiors of this place are old, but can be counted as one of the best still. Its charm and glory will never die, no matter how fast the world paces towards the modernity.

I love both the Indian and the Chinese section of the restaurant and both the section serves, what can be called the authentic food for their respective cuisines and astonishingly, at the most affordable prices. For me, the best time to visit the place is during afternoons, when there is a potentially lesser crowd as during peak hours, especially on weekends, you will have to stand in the long queues for a long time to find a table and the environment can be really noisy. The quality of food and service might have deteriorated a bit after all these years, that only the regular goers would agree with but the place is nevertheless worth going. 

If you have heard the quote - when in doubt, choose black. Then in terms of the restaurants, when in doubt, choose Bar-b-q. 

In terms of ambience, food quality, service or prices, it is never going to disappoint you. I always have a great time visiting this place and I am never going to feel saturated, though the frequency has lessened due to so many new restaurants coming up. 

Special tip - Try their american corn chili pepper, crispy chili baby corn and dal makhani. It is the benchmark I have set when I visit any other place and order the same thing. (Never found better)

Out for a brunch with girlfriends we stopped at Bar-B-Q last Friday. And was I surprised?  Yes. 
Welcomed by the polite staff with a smile, was the winner and they surely did take the phrase "First impression is the last impression" seriously. The wooden decor within had its own old world charm, and the dining area is quite spacious and tastefully set up keeping the theme in mind.
Upon surfing the menu the dishes sounded really delicious, and left us clueless and thus our host staff was at rescue. He recommended Bar-B-Q Special Chow Mein, Mixed Chow Mein and Kung Pao chicken. The service was quick on a weekday afternoon (surprisingly). Each of the dishes stood out as a winner. The Kung Pao chicken was something which would take me back there quite often. The portions in one serving can suffice two people easily. And trust me it has potential to give China Town a run for its money. Well, haven't tried out the north Indian section, but would definitely try it in near future. And who ever says its pocket pinching is certainly a miser. :p
My ratings:
Food: 4.5 out of 5
Ambience: 3 out of 5
Staff: 4.5 out of 5
I would love to go there again and again.

EXTREMELY friendly service , super ambiance........
  NB:try not to drink too much there cause the drinks are too costly

The restaurant is as famous as maybe Victoria is, giving the oh so famous china town a run for their money. 
What works the most for this place is its location. Situated in the heart of the city, with ample offices and colleges around, this place is always crowded and while managing the crowd gets little difficult, the waiters at BBQ masters this art. 
The waiters are at their best when it comes to service. 


The portions they serve is amazing and honestly it gets difficult for even 2 people to finish it off.. Specially if their appetite is small like mine :P

The ambiance is quiet good and spacious- which is a plus again.


Coming to the food, I've tried almost all their veg dishes. From wonton to baby corn to soups to noodles to rice to devil's choice to well, you get it.. & honestly, I feel that the food is overrated. 
Yes, it ain't bad- no not at all. Far from it. But, it isn't as good as it is said to be. 

However, it's easy on pocket and the portions are huge ( literally) , so if you've not visited the place yet then please visit it the very next time you're in park street- or well going there simply for eating is harmless as well :D

Bar-B-Q is one of my favourite restaurants in Park street. It offers great quality food in Indian and Chinese cuisine. 

Pros:
1. Ambience is quite good with wooden interiors. It is one of the most spacious restaurants in Park Street.

2. Servings are plentiful and quality of food is really good. Chinese cuisine is much better than Indian cuisine.

3.Prices are more or less reasonable.

4.Service is really good and fast.

Bar-B-Q is one of such restaurants which wont disappoint you. Just remember to have your reservations in advance to avoid queues.

Another popular restaurant in Park street,Bar-B-Q has the distinct advantage of being a little more spacious than other popular restaurants in the area.This is the reason why you wont have to wait outside as long as you have to in some other places.
The quality of the food is good.The ambience is nice.The prices are also more or less reasonable.The service is okay.But if you visit the place at a time when the waiters change their shift,then they will make you hurry up.Once I had the unpleasant experience of being handed the bill even before I had finished my food.
The down side is that they offer only Indian and Chinese cuisine.So if you want to try something different then this is not the place to be.

When one Park Street and craving Chinese food while enjoying the nice ambiance this place is definitely a winner. With its wooden interiors , polite servers and tasty food this place is definitely worth a try. While I have heard many complain about its Chinese fare being too light or being overpriced I have personally never felt that the place is either overpriced or that the taste doesn't satisfy the taste buds. I like their Chinese fare which is on the light side and they have this amazing homemade sauce which lends quite a bite to one's dining experience. The menu does not have an item which stands out of the way or is a signature dish but on an over all basis the food served from their Chinese section is quite tasty. I have personally never eaten from their Indian section so I have no opinions about their Indian fare. I must mention one experience of mine where I had gone all alone to indulge in some soup and take some food back home. The charming old host was extremely courteous and asked me about my experience when I was leaving. This old world charm is definitely something which needs appreciation.

Bar-B-Q has been a family favourite for quite some time!! There is always a crowd waiting patiently (or rather impatiently!) waiting for their turn to revel in the gastronomical delight which awaits them at this wonderful place. 
We enjoy both the chinese as well as the indian fare. People would scoff if i were to say that the chicken spring roll was the best i have eaten till date (and i have been eating spring rolls of all shapes and sizes since childhood). Potions are humongous and we always end up taking some home. the fare is better than most restaurants at Tangra (Kolkata's very on china town)
Buzzing with customers with super efficient hosts and waiters, the place is a must visit and. It's old charm mixed with awesome food. An irresistible combination!

A few months back me and my friends chose this place for an all girls brunch date. When we arrived at around 12 noon, the place was more or less empty but it was totally filled up two hours later. We seated ourselves in the outer section which was pretty huge with a nice 
decor, comfy seats and polite staff. Our order comprised of-
1. Chicken sweet corn soup
2. Drums of heaven
3. Chicken fried rice
4. Chicken Szechuan chowmein
5. Baby corn in hot garlic sauce
6. Chicken with mushroom and vegetables
7. Hunan chicken

All of the above dishes were simply delectable! There was a red sauce served with the soup 
which complemented the soup perfectly. The baby corn was the spiciest and totally yummy. 
Hunan chicken was the sweetest dish but it was equally tasty. Along with quality, the 
quantity was good too. At the end of a fulfilling meal, the bill was something around 1500 
for 6, which is pretty affordable!
Overall, the Chinese section is really worth trying out at least once. I'm looking forward to 
try out their North Indian section :)

All time favourite! Just try it out without batting an eyelid. Most calcuttans would have already tried this place atleast once if not much more! On my last visit had tried out chinese.. was great fun trying out the noodles with chopsticks.. portions are good and service is pretty efficient! Now you know why this place has the longest waiting lines outside it in all of Park Street on Sundays!

This place is proof that Chinatown maybe be all 'Made in China', but foodwise, the real deal's closer home at Park Street! The noodles, ohhmygawd!, are to die for, and starter to main-course it's a foodie's delight. However the desert menu could do with some more authentic sweetstuff, a la the paradisical Mainland China! This and Waldorf toughly compete, and I daresay, Bar-B-Q, rocks my taste higher, most of the time!

Situated in the heart of the city, easy to go, other than weekend it is quite silent, pressure are comparatively low.
Foods are amazing whether it is starter or main course.
It is mainly Chinese cuisine but have the great combination of Soup, Rice, Chicken, Vegetables etc.
Taste is very good with many varieties.
Other than that you can drink here with this quite pleasant place.
Serving is good, prompt, waiters are cooperative and polite, comfortable to dine out.
We have ordered A combination of Rice, Chicken, Vegetable and Wine(Pint). 
A good experience We gathered...

at Bar B Que i had the most horrible experience.. first of all the place was so noisy that i could talk to my girlfriend. The Air condtion was really chilling i had told the the fat steward if he could turn down the ac a bit, he was really rude to me and i just did not like it. The waiter that took the order mixed up the order completely and i told him that this was not my order he apologise and then after some time brought the order that i asked for, therefore the service is lousy. The mgt literally chase you out of the restaurant once you more or less through with your meals and that is pethetic. The food was also quiet lousy and the price is just to high not worth the salt. 

overall the atmospher was poor to me... i just feel that this restro is overated.

One of my favourite restaurants in Park Street. The prices are very reasonable, the servings are plentiful and the food itself is great. Its a multicuisine restaurant, so eat whatever you like, you won't be disappointed. The waiters are a friendly lot. Keep in mind that the place remains full almost all the time. Make reservations if you're planning to go in a huge group. As its a crowded place, you may wan't to stay away if you want to enjoy a quiet dinner with a loved one- the place is loud.

One of my favourites that never fails to meet my  expectations. I usually go on weekdays for lunch because then you are sure of a table. The bbq special noodles (with gravy) and bbq special fried rice are favorites. Portions are fantastic. Recently I took a vegetarian colleague (from Delhi) and he loved the food. I never eat veg Chinese so I wouldn't know! But he did complain about the musty smell the source of which is the old carpets. Can you do anything about it? So I can keep taking my out of town guests and am sure they won't complain.

At the risk of blasphemy, let me make it clear right at the outset that Bar-B-Q / Flavours of China is an institution in itself. It does not behove me to belittle an institution, but let me be clear that it does disappoint, especially considering the hype. Yes, the portions of Chinese food are huge and prices are reasonable, but the food quality isn't that great. The Konjee crispy lamb i tried was rubbery and chowdery, the noodles were overly bland, a side-effect of using vegetables which have been chopped hours earlier, or perhaps the previous day. Also, the lemon fish was just too sweet. I didn't find a balance of flavour. Assembly line cooking is obvious in such a popular establishment, but the pitfall of this approach is that quality can be inconsistent. 
Also, I have tried the Indian food, and would not recommend it to anyone. If you're in the mood for Indian food, then walk a few doors down to Kwality. The naan I ordered at Bar-B-Q was very leathery and chewy, and the butter chicken tasted like somebody in the kitchen has ITC's pre-packed foods which you just microwave and feed to patrons. Awful!

Been there so many times, i can call it one of my fav restaurant, well untill yesterday. Wanted to have some sliced chilli pork and pan fried mixed meat last evening so went there. We were about to take our seat when one of the managers yelled in the most unpleasent tone that the seat is reserved. We were shocked. Is that the way they are supposed to behave? He should have politly told us the same thing, instead he yelled. i haven't seen such unpolished behaviour at any other top notch restaurants. As far as food is concerned i will visit this place again, but they should focus on being well mannered, well behaved and well spoken before it's too late.

This place was among few of our favorite family restaurant. Chinese food is really good and so is there indian food.good ambience. If your are planning to visit this place during weekend then better go their during early hours or else you have to wait in a really long queue. Also during those long queue the service becomes so slow and the food isn't that tasty.I once happened to go their at 8 pm on Sunday and was waiting for an hour to get a table,moreover no waiter took our order till another half n hour.we ordered for mutton rogan josh instead they served us mutton curry(it didn't even taste good), the tandoori rotis were burnt..from starters to end course the food was tasteless....the waiter and manager were so busy that they didn't listen to our complains.

so going there during rush hours can be a huge mistake. we indeed have started less visiting this place due to this sour experience ,we avoid it completely during weekends.
Disappointing.

I am in Kolkata from the last 3 years and Bar-B-Q, Park Street was one of the first restaurants I have been to. A must visit for its Chinese cuisine but the Indian food tastes good too.
Perfect combo of food quality and quantity v/s price charged. With soothing ambiance, polite staff and good service, it deserves 4/5 points. 

Suggest to reserve your table on weekends/festive seasons or you will probably end up waiting for long. However, I personally feel that the taste's degraded.

The prime reason why I love this place is because of the par excellent food they serve here. Go mainly for the Chinese cuisine, which tastes so much better than the Indian food (not that the latter is bad, but I found the former much better). The baby corn and other veg Chinese starters are mind blowing and the main course is equally amazing. 

However, one tip: along with Chinese food, do not have any cold drink such as lemonade or coke etc. instead, call for a jasmine tea which best complements and digests the Chinese food!

Also, do make prior reservations on weekends and dinners.

Bar-b-q is a place that most Calcuttans have been visiting for generations. It's a wonder that they have kept up their standard of food and service for so long. Food is legendary in it's quality, quantity & taste. The place does not fare much in themed ambiance, but has a very homely cozy feeling about it. I love the Chinese fare, and so far have managed to skip the Indian dishes. The bar is well stocked. The hosts and the waiters are ever so pleasing and once you go there you are bound to return whenever you are in the vicinity.

The hospitality of the waiters is something questionable. They run the place because of their food- ad Arrogance might have resulted in the Change of the Attitude of te waiters.

Overall- This is the best place for Chinese Cuisine  in Kolkata..!

The chinese food is better than the Indian food.I loved he burnt ginger fried rice,it goes beautifully with the pork Manchurian.Also,the starters are excellent.
Service is good,and the place is always jam-packed with people.
However,my advice is to not experiment a lot.I tried a fruit salad and they basically gave me pineapple and cherry pieces in an ice-cream cup.It was a disaster.

One of my favourite restaurant where you can dine out occasionally. They have one of the largest seating capacities. Their food quantity is quite huge in amount, so that's to be taken into account when placing the order. Well do try only the chinese section. The Indian is not that great. Do try: Devils' chicken, BBQ special chowmin(gravy), chily sliced pork, Wanton/thai soup. Its certainly a favourite place for giving treats to friends. Well alcohol is quite costly here. The only thing that felt bad to me is that during weekends dinner time, you have to sit downstairs in their men's bar section if you have all gents, even when you are not planning to order a drink or getting drunk!! The atmosphere at downstairs is not nice though.

One heck of a good place. In the best part of the city - Park Street with huge interiors, one is left to wonder why the place is jam packed - no matter whether its weekend or weekday..lunch or dinner. The food is absolutely amazing. Haven't tried Indian, but the Chinese is way too good. I have tried Red Pepper Fish, Golden Fried Prawns and Crispy Fried Chicken in starters - and they are simply wow. For main course, I haven't experimented much over my last 2 visits. Stuck to noodles and good old Chilli Chicken. The service sizes are so huge that invariably its a fight to finish even though the food is so good.

As far as price goes, it doesn't hurt your pocket..at all! Go for it, your tummy would indeed be very happy at the end of it :)

A place that lives up to its quality standards and is a value for Money..! The quantity of food is pretty good and so are the prices..:)
Most of my friends have thrown a birthday party here atleast once and so have I..! I always prefer to have the chinese out here because I know its gonna be mouth watering.
Amazing Hakka Noodles, Veg Manchurian, Chinese Bhel and Burnt Garlic Fried rice ...! 
The ambience is good and the service is A grade..! It has got a wooden decor and hence the earthy touch as well..!

I think of Bar-B-Q when my friends want a Park Street treat at a "proper restaurant" (bhalo jaygae khawa toh!) and when I don't want to end up paying bucketloads to satisfy them. Here are the points where this place scores:
The prices, like I said, are cheaper than the other Park Street restaurants that provide the same ambience or level of service. Also, the amounts of food are very generous per plate.
There's a Chinese part and an Indian part, and food is really good in either one of these sections.
There's a whole lot of seating area, so although the place is filled with lots of groups, you wouldn't have to wait in line outside.
The service is fast, efficient and polite.
Finally, it's fun to read the random Chinese zodiac horoscopes on the food mats.
Ergo, a gala time had by all.

It's one of those places in Kolkata to have still retained that old world charm. The restaurant managers are polite and well groomed and they always cater to any individual needs you may have. Food is good in quality and portion sizes are larger than average. And it's very reasonably priced. It can be the perfect setting for your office meeting with colleagues or a romantic date with that special someone. I love Bar-B-Q.

We were a group of four and ordered Mutton biryani, butter naan, tandoori chicken and dhania murg. The food was delicious and its not a very expensive place to eat out, considering its location and ambience. Definitely a place that i will keep on returning.

Being old is not always a curse - knowing Bar-B-Q for over 25 years makes me believe this even more . I feel quite elated and happy that I proud that Park Street still has a iconic establishment like Bar B Q . I have been going to this restaurant since my early childhood , with my parents and just like Peter Cat they have maintained their style . Undoubtedly they have made some upgrades with the times , but whenever i go there i still feel as if I am in a time capsule - and the maître d' or the gateman all are from a different time . 

Menu wise - i don't know for sure what i should recommend , most items i have liked one time or the other . They do have a Chinese section as well as a Indian / Tandoori section . I can tell you from a age old experience - both sections remain equally filled up all the time . If you have never been there I would suggest just go there . It is an amazing family restaurant . 

Price : Definitely within your reach . As mentioned , with Alcohol , you can have a bill of within 800 INR , unless you are voracious couple . 

Service : I love their treatment . Yes, sometimes they are unable to do anything just because of the amazing rush . But they have waiters and managers who can recommend you food depending on your type of visit . 

Toilets : Good and clean . 

Parking : Well , you are in Park Street ... so its up to you. It's not reserved but there is ample space . 

Ambiance / Crowd : Very fine . Yes, you might face a few families bringing kids who might be screaming / running around the place , but then you might also be one of those families yourself . 

In conclusion : I love this place and i believe so will you .

Right in the heart of Park Street lies this nice place that serves really good chinese food. The fact that it is always buzzing with a people is proof enough of its popularity. The chinese starters in particular are to die for - Red Pepper Chicken or Crispy Fried Chilli Chicken.
Do try the prawns. They make wonderful preparations in prawn. Whether it is golden fried prawns for starters or prawns cooked in sauce of your choice ( I recommend chilli soya), the flavors and spices just explode in your mouth.

This is one of my main must visit food stops in Kolkata. It is one of the best Chinese joints in the area.

Since I have always eaten in their Chinese section, I can only talk about that part. However, the quality of the service and the ambience are the same in the Indian and Chinese sections.

Bar-B-Q is always full. There is a large crowd that waits outside every day. Even on a weekday, tables are full or booked by 7:30 p.m., which is very early for dinner (by Calcutta standards). Still, if one manages to get in, it is worth the advance booking/early arrival.

There is a good range of starters available. While the Fish Fingers and Crispy Fried Baby Corn are good, taking a main-course dish like Sliced Chilli Pork and asking them to serve it dry is a very good idea.

The noodle and rice dishes available are all good. The quantities are also very large, so even large groups can make do with a low number of dishes. The Vegetarian Pan Fried Noodles and the American Chop Suey are personal favourites. The restaurant serves chicken, fish and pork items, apart from vegetarian side dishes.

The prices are very reasonable - it probably serves the cheapest Chinese food on Park Street. That is another reason for the large crowds. The service is average, though, and when the restaurant fills up, it tends to slow down. To their credit, they manage multiple orders from the same table (at different points in time) well. They also have a large variety of tables to fit different-sized groups. There is a raised platform at two ends of the restaurant to accommodate large groups, and these can be used to host parties (sit-down, though) for up to twenty people. Overall, a good restaurant to go to, both in terms of food quality and price.

This is one of our family's favorites.But by this I only mean the"Flavors of China"section.We weren't earlier aware that this has 3 separate kitchens and if you do not gt a seat in the flavors section and need to sit in Bar b q you will not get the same quality of food nor ambience.Bar b q section was so chilled that we asked for blankets ;-) ! But worst part was even after complaining the captain and waiters were indifferent.Later we realised it wasnt only us who faced such problems!
Anyway, the flavors of china section is totally different
It's always crowded at dinner time with wait timings going to more than an hour in the weekends.Service could do with more courtesy, but it's fast so we do not mind.
Food is excellent if you order the regular well known fare.For starters, lat me kai, prawn pepper salt, pan fried chilli fish are excellent.In the mains we love pan fried noodles, konjee crispy lamb.Tutty fruity for desserts also comes in dainty little portions.Prices come to around 500 per head if you include all courses (without alcohol).

This is one of the better Indian-Chinese restaurants of Calcutta. Once you get inside, you don't feel you are in Calcutta anymore. The view from the restaurant is pretty nice. Old Victorian era buildings and Park Street is all you see from your table, which makes you feel you are somewhere outside this city. Spread across a huge area, this is one roomy restaurant. 

The food in one word is excellent. Hunan Chicken was may favorite side dish, that I had with mixed rice noodles. One plate of rice noodles is enough for two average eaters. The waiters are surprisingly elegant and the ambiance is stately. A must visit for all Indian-Chinese food-buffs.

Food:  4.5/5
Ambiance:  4.5/5

Location and Description: Its in the Central Attraction Point of Kolkata Park Street... A place renowned for its Food and specially for its services. U will find Lots of people here where Indian or foreigner... All are Food Lovers.

Ambience and Staff: Sitting Arrangement is very good... Lots of Tables and divided into section about what u wanna eat, Indian or Chinese. Staff here are very polite and well behaved and serves very fast.

Food: Coming to the Food they provide so its AWWWWSSSUUMMMMM here....We took Chicken and prawn Kababs which were Excellent and fried really well... Coming to the Main Course so we had Biriyani which was very good as expected with good quantity, Mix Rice Followed by Chilly chicken and Prawn Chilly which was too in good quantity and very worth eating. The chilly taste was full of flavours, Gravy was thick. Rice contained all the ingredients with Egg,Chicken, prawn all over the rice ... We loved it so much that we decided to take the Fish also... Taste is always satisfying here 9/10. The Fry, marinating and roast was perfect. Each and every bite is worth your penny.

QNQ and Prices: The quality of the food is always remarkable and the quantity is very good, can be served to two people very easily.  Price are not a big factor.. according to the food quality and quantity.

Conclusion: This place has been always a better option at Park street. We were all Satisfied for the money we spent.... They really maintain the name of Bar B Q.. You get value for Your money here.

Note: The Review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

OMG,seriously this was my reaction after seeing the 3 halls of restaurants,though I have visited numerous restaurants in the city. The restaurant is awesome and offers numerous food option to its customer. Well the decor is really nice,the floor has a wooden finish,decorations is nice,after all these it leaves a nice effect on the customers.              Now, coming to the food,it is one of the best people will get in the city. The halls are divided according to selected cuisines-Chinese,Indian and mixed. The service is prompt and really nice.....Well anything you order is nice.Though the Indian food is better as you will get better Chinese food in the area. Must haves are Dhania Murgh,Acchari Paneer,Any Kebab and in Chinese  are Tsing Hoi Chicken,Mandarin Fish,KingPrawns in DEVIL'S sauce and more...tey out some of the desserts it's also nice....but when ever you are in Park Street no one can beat Flury's in terms of desserts..... Well be here it's quite a nice place to gulpppp :-)

I have been going to this place since 36 years now(I'm almost 40).The owners have kept the old world charm alive,as the place still feels straight out of the early 60's.

What can I say,this place is an institution and although they serve excellent North Indian cuisine as well,it's their lip smacking Chinese fare that draws me and my friends at least once a month if not more.

BAR-B-Q has nothing to do with barbeque. Don't know why this name came up. 

One of the good restaurants on the better side of the scale at Park Street. Outside China Town of Kolkata, it probably have the largest no. of covers (people to eat simultaneously).

The Indian food is foolproof than the chinese. Better, I should say, one can identify the Indian cuisine whereas sometimes certain chinese dishes are confusing, more of a melange of sauces.

Wish to take someone to a restaurant with a upscale feeling but cheap pocket pinch, BAR-B-Q is the place to be. Nothing outstanding, at the same time one would not hate it.

BBQ has always been one of those regular haunts for me and my family - no matter what time it is or what the occasion maybe, It has the perfect combination of old school charm with new age rates. 
The food hasn't changed in years and after the blast at Mcdonalds, BBQ was the only other restaurant affected on Park street and yet, they've come back strong. 
My grandfather was close friends with the Kothari family and you can sense the legacy in the building itself, the simple Chinese horoscope place mats (which we all love reading again and again) make the evening fun and the food itself is just plain yummy.
Don't expect traditional Chinese food though, the flavours are all changed to adhere to a desi palate. But that's exactly what we love and come back for - the crispy baby corn, Hakka noodles and boneless chilly chicken gravy are staples at our table. Don't miss the gravy chowmein and chilli pork - its finger licking good. 
As for the Indian section, I'm not in love as much as I am with the Chinese food. Id rather go to Amber for my fill of perfect Indian / Mughlai food. 
Don't miss this restaurant if you're visiting Calcutta, it's in the heart of the city in park street and is one of the few venues that can boast of a pretty scenic view of the entire Park street stretch. It's highly affordable so I suggest taking a big bunch of friends and sitting at the round tables.
Packed on the weekends so do call and make a reservation!

One can try very good quality Chinese food here with variety of dishes.  Price for quantity is pretty reasonable.  Ambiance is good, quality of crowd is also good.  You need to book a table otherwise waiting period can taste your patience.

2. Food quality - Not at par with it's neighbor. The menu has not refresh in a while. The quality is ordinary

3. Serivce - It's horrible now. I once asked for sauce, waiter said what will you do with it. That was the last time I was there.

Could not help reviewing Bar B Q even though I have reviewed it before but this is to tell you'll more than just the one line review last time around. Superb Location - Check, Good Ambiance - Check, Lighting - Check, Crowd - Check, Delicious Food - Check. It secures a five on five. Its my favourite rest by many a mile as it scores on all parameters.
I like the Chinese section and the Indian section equally. Its a sprawling space across which BarBQ and Flavours of China is spread. The seating is very comfortable. The ambiance is classy. The stewards are attentive and serve with a smile.
Now coming to the food, the Hakka Noodles and the Veg Manchurian is just superb. The Indian fare including Begum Bahar is outstanding. Paneer Butter Masala is just awesome and the Garlic Naan is yummy. Sinful is the word. Babycorn and Russian Salad is also good. Among desserts, Tutty Frutty is good. Everything I have had at BarBQ has been good and I have never had a bad meal here.
Nothing less than 5 stars from me for BarBQ.

I prefer their Indian section over the Chinese one, even though ... fate or something... I have eaten the Chinese here more than the Indian.

I have a thing for their Dopiaza, which I like eating with a naan or two, if I am terribly hungry. A fan of their Indian section for quite some time, I recently tried out their Paneer Pasanda and the lovely Saag Mutton, and felt that they were quite good too. 

The only complaint I have is possibly the service, which is quite slow at times, even when the place is half-full.

We(my family and me) simply love this place and soo i guess does the entire city!!when it comes to good Chinese at a nice price range it's always bar b q!!i guess it is one of the most famous and most loved restaurant in the city!it is known for its starters such as baby corns and chinese salad!!the chilli garlic noodles and the manchow soup of this place are my favourite!!it also has indian cuisine which is equally good!they have a variety of items on their menu be it starters, maincourse, breads, side dishes, desserts or drink they rule it all!!(it is i guess the only restaurant which is full even on weekdays at dinner!!!!!)

good quality delicious food with an excellent ambience in the perfect location of the city, Park Street, at an affordable price is what makes bar b q so popular amongst all age groups! 
 the staff too is very good and provides excellent service!Bar b q easily gets a 5 out of 5 undoubtedly!!

Never miss the lip-smacking Chinese dishes at Bar-B-Q when you are at Park Street, Kolkata and are looking for a good restaurant to dine at. Bar-B-Q has everything that a person looks for when he sets his foot inside a restaurant - good ambience, delicious food, excellent service and pocket-friendly rates of food items.  Bar-B-Q has seating arrangements for many people, but at times (during occasions or festivals); you have to stand in a long queue, waiting for your turn. But, this is common problem with all good restaurants. Crowd flocks to places that offer mouthwatering cuisines at reasonable rates. 
I got a chance to dine at Bar-B-Q with my cousin who had just dropped in Kolkata on her way to Singapore.  As she was going to stay with us for a few days, I thought it was the perfect time to take her to Bar- B-Q.  Bar-B-Q has a fantastic ambience.  You get a feel of dining in a cozy Chinese cottage with food bowls arranged on your table. You will surely like its romantic atmosphere caused by its dimly-lit chandeliers. 
On entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a friendly waiter who showed us our table and provided us a menu card. Although Bar-B-Q offers many popular Tandoori and Mughlai dishes, we decided to opt for Chinese. Within half-an hour food bowls, filled with steaming sweet and sour chicken, chili chicken, Schezwan chicken chowmein and mixed chowmein arrived at our table. The aroma and the color of these delicacies were enough to tantalize our taste buds and we started gorging on our food. 
We wrapped up our dinner with Bar-B-Q's yummy chocolate souffle and hot chocolate fudge. With delicious food, superb ambience, excellent service and reasonable costs, Bar-B-Q is one restaurant that I'll visit again and again.

A decent multicuisine.
Ambience: The place (combining both the Indian and the Chinese segments) is mammoth (but I'll still feel blessed if I didn't have to wait in a que on a weekend night!) and boasts a very colonial atmosphere. Perfect for group outings and get-togethers!
Service: Well, nothing to brag about in this segment but I'm not dissing them either. I'd say their service is regular.
Food: Somehow I've always ended up eating Chinese here, which, is good and the serving is generous. Particular mention is the Chimney soup. And from what I gather, the Indian is not bad either.
Recommendation: A visit to this heritage eatery and once you've got there you can try the Chimney soup. :)

BarbQ has been a Kolkata favourite for years, and they have amazingly maintained the standards of service, quality, and taste right through. Chinese food is usually most popular here, and almost all dishes are full value in terms of taste and quantity. My favourites include the Crispy Chilly Babycorn/Mushroom and the Chilly Garlic Noodles. 

The Indian food here is quite underrated, but is very good in reality. The Dal Makhani is top notch and so are the breads. 

The quantity of food in every dish at BarbQ makes it very good value for money, especially if you go in groups of 4-5 or more. But yes, be prepared for bouts of sleepiness after eating there!

Well we've been to BarBQ so often that there is barely a dish on the menu I have not had. You can never go wrong with this place, whether you want to eat their Chinese fare or the staple Indian/Mughlai cuisine. Service may be dodgy at times but the quality, consistent quantity and prices more than make up for it. Try anything on the menu, you will like it. Avoid on weekend evenings - the queues are LOOOONG.

The first time  I went was with a group of 15 people. The service was good. The atmosphere was excellent. quite spacious. I tried pork which tasted very moist and rich. The other were rice,chicken and almost every one of those interesting names we found on the menu. it was awesome .

Its an ideal family restaurant and good to go with friends.Different type of food at cheap rate. Go there now if you havent!!

Ummm my mouth waters thinking about the food at Bar-B-Q. Its yummy-licious to say the least. One of the oldest restaurants in the city, the place is huge and offers great Chinese and North Indian food. However, I prefer sticking to Chinese every time I visit the place. The prawns - I think all the preparations - starters, main course - all are excellent. That with a nice serving of spicy noodles can make your meal absolutely delectable. The chicken dishes in the starters are very good too. The service of the restaurant is old-time but they customize dishes according to your palette. Parking is a challenge anyway for the whole of Park Street. Once that is taken care of, taking a stroll in Park Street preceded by a meal at Bar-B-Q...can definitely be termed as a 'great outing'.

Having tried the Chinese dishes of Bar-B-Q, I must say it is exceptionally good, but in no way is it the best restaurant in the city as suggested by a lot of people. The dishes are authentic in their taste, but I have had better Chinese food in other places of the city.

Would recommend the other South-East Asian dishes available here!

This is one of the most popular places in park street always full in dinner times have been going there for last more then a decade and never had any serious issues. Looks and have same feeling for may be many decades, has two sections Indian and Chinese but you can order anything in any section. We have tried both and food is definitively above average, service is very fast and most of the staff is same all this times. I will personally recommend Chinese section as it scores more. Drinks are decently priced but can be cheaper in many places. Recommended - Drums of Heaven, Chilly Garlic Noodles, Chilly Fish.

I'm sure everybody in calcutta has eaten at Bar B Q.

This place is so famous that i wonder if there is anyone in this city who doesnt know about it.

Be it the Chinese or the India, both are really good, service is prompt and food tastes the same every time.

Do not make the mistake of going there on a public holiday or weekends for lunch or dinner you will have to wait for hours.

Have always come here atleast once every month and shall continue to do so. :-)

to tell the truth may be I was expecting a lot from the restaurant. The food according to me was mediocre ie neither too good nor too bad. Everything I tried was identical to the other lower-mid budget restaurants. Service is awesome so is the quantity.But once again I think, considering the taste of food, this restaurant is a bit overpriced.

I feel its one of the very fine restaurants of ParkStreet. I simply love the food here. The page is really big. The aura is nice and dimly lighted. They cook great chinese. Both the quality and quantity of the food is good. Its usualy crowded on holidays or weekends so you can find the service a bit slow. But the tastes will surely let u wait. The chinese starters are nice and especialy i liked chilli pork and sweet and sour chicken. Simly loved the flavours. The prices are also very apt. However its a bit crowdy bt although a place for friends and families.

Bar-B-Q.....I went there and soaked in the glory of gala food festival for my gratified soul. From the entry to exit along with course of having lunch and discussion.....was all a brisk and soothing  experience. You will get a majestic welcome from the group of people....who will steer you to the  separate sitting arrangements for either of Chinese and Indian food. The place is well maintained with comfortable dining arrangement for a varied number of people. Although you may feel that the adjoining tables are a bit close to each other, superimposing on each others privacy. I had Drums of Heaven, Mixed Fried Rice, Devil Chicken and Manchurian Fish. To my utter amazement, all of the dishes were heavenly tasty and nurtured with experienced hands. The food quantity is more than you can judge by its price. The waiters are pleasing and the ambiance is complementing of its value. It reminds me of Glenary's..Altogether, a great feeling of goodness blows in mind whenever I think of this place.

This a fairly big place,in terms of area...Large rooms,peppered with tables in a packed yet uncluttered manner..and why not? Both the days i visited this place for lunch,it seemed packed to capacity. The menu is good..alcoholic beverages seem a bit on the higher priced end (Afterall Oly Pub is almost next door,and would be a cheaper watering hole)..but the ambience is a big plus...a very refined atmosphere indeed...the cocktails are good as well. The starters are lipsmacking,but the portion sizes are a bit on the lesser side.Main courses are all pretty good,but nothing unforgettable..The staff were well mannered and professional...lives up to the Park Street Reputation of being a chic and refined as well as happening corner of Kolkata..overall..a 4 out of 5 in my book.

Went with my better-half and parents for lunch in the last week of November. Food is good. However, you have to be careful of some items. For example we ordered Ginger-garlic chicken along with many other items, and surprisingly the ginger-garlic chicken was sweet to taste. I have had ginger-garlic chicken at many place and I myself loves to try new dishes at my home, so I know that the ginger-garlic chicken was too sweet and tasted more like sweet and sour chicken. I believe the reason for the same to be more of tomato puree and less of vinegar and soya sauce while preparing the dish. Anyways, rest of the items were good. However, a big thumbs down to the service, the guys are really slow and half of the people around were actually shouting like "we are waiting for 1 hour when it will be served", etc. Ours was served in about 45 mins time, which I feel is a bit too long. as I mentioned ours was lunch, so if its more crowded at dinner time, I wonder how long they will take. Also, if you are not able to finish off all and ask something to be packed be very beware. If you don't remember to ask for the item they will not remind you that you have asked something to be packed. This is what exactly happened with us. Although I understand that its our duty to remember what we have asked for packaging, however, they should also remind us if I am forgetting something. I found this very unprofessional and like a cheap road-side dhaba. Anyways, If I have to rate on the food, it would be - 3 out of 5 and service would be 1 out of 5. Thanks - Ritam

Bigg! That's the first word that comes to your mind when you step in this restaurant! Tables placed all over a huge place, it's got a nice decor and ambiance to have a dinner! Its one of the old favorites of the city, and though the taste and quality have detoriated ever so slightly, its still a great place to eat at! Service is swift.. And when you are served, the first thing you notice is the quantity! A single plate is enough to feed two.. The starters are very good here.. Try drums of heaven, its heavenly! And yes, Swear by Chinese when you enter this place, coz every time I ordered mughlai, it flopped! Especially the Biryani.. It tastes different, and is too dry! But overall, a very nice place..

This definitely is one of my favorite restaurants in the town. This place serves very good Indian as well as Chinese food. I like the Indian food here however I love the Chinese food they serve. This place serves one of the best Cantonese noodles of the city. The chimney soup is also awesome. The ambiance is excellent. The staff is very well behaved. Liquor cost is on higher side, but the food is not very costly considering the quality. A dinner ( starter,main & side) with couple of drinks would cost around Rs.1000 for two. I would highly recommend this place. If you are in Park street you should definitely try this place.

Service was average as had to repeat the orders quite a number of times. The basic requirement "tissue papers" were not present on each chair(Didn't expect that to happen).
Food quality was good. Overall a happy 2 hour lunch with a good crowd around would make you always feel pleasing.

The dishes are too good; absolutely awesome. I went there with my family quite a number of times, & not even for the slightest of moments on any day did they disappoint me, whether that be with the atmosphere cum cordiality of the waiters or the food. The food quality cum quantity is superb. My favorite one is Crispy Chilli Babycorn & Vegetable Hakka Noodles.
A definite place to visit if you have not yet.

I have come many times to Bar-B-Q and always go home satisfied. The ambiance of the restaurant always been great and the food is good (although not great). Service is slow, however, the staff's attention to customer's need is excellent. The front of the house will priorities those people with children, something that thoroughly impresses me. 

One should know that the Chinese food here is not authentic. Rather it has been bent to meet Indian palette. Also the spacing between each tables are notoriously small. Because of these small flaws, Im giving it 3/5.

An "ALL TIME FAVOURITE" restaurant for anybody living in Kolkata. Whether Indian or Chinese the food always make you walk out of the restaurant happy and satisfied. It is economical, delicious, filling, and surely a memorable experience. The restaurant may get noisy at times but the food just over powers that interfering factor. Chilli garlic noodles, devils chicken, hunan chicken, fried wantons, and the list just does not end. An assurance of very very good chinese food in the city. Whenever i think of a chinese joint, Bar-b-q strikes my mind first and i guess it happens to many more people too.

THE ONLY THING WHICH NEEDS SPECIAL MENTION IS THAT FROM OUR LAST THREE VISITS THE FOOD SERVED WAS NOT HOT ALTOUGH THEY AGAIN RECOOKED THE FOOD AFTER COMPLAINING BUT THIS THING SHOULD NOT HAPPEN IN SUCH A RENOWNED RESTAURANT.
THE PRICES ARE ALSO REASONABLE. BUT THE ACTUAL PRICES ARE HIGHER THAN THAT SHOWN HERE

The place is divided into sections. This I believe is a crowd puller in Park St., and the place also is not bad. When we left the place after finishing our diiner, we found people waiting impatiently as the place was full, to grab their seats, and have dinner at Bar-B-Q. The ambiance and the stuff are both well fitted for a restaurant in Park St. The food they serve is of good amount, but they lack tender pieces of chicken or prawn in their noodles and rice. The price is pocket friendly. If you're in Park St, and looking for a pocket friendly, quality Chinese dinner then you can always count on Bar-B-Q, rather it is one of the best restaurants in Park St. area. Though they've got Indian food as well, I never got to taste them, cause I felt that this place is more about Chinese food than Indian.

went to this place today and awesome is the word.located at the heart of park street,one can enjoy a generous meal at a very reasonable price.had chicken tandoori,mixed fried rice(which is more than enough for two people),the talu mein soup which is a speciality of this place and kung pao chicken(considered as a portion and we got about 12-14 pieces of boneless chicken). the drinks are also priced reasonably...from breezers at 135 bucks,cocktails at 140 bucks and mocktails at 90 bucks,vodka/rum/gin around 70-120 bucks for 30ml and beer starting from 100 bucks (650ml).the place is quite big with comfortable sofas as well as normal chairs.the service offered by the staff is also good.the indian items are priced a bit higher than the chinese items.overall experience was pretty good.coming back again.
personal ratings:
food: 4.5/5
ambience: 3.5/5

price : 4.5/5

This is a review for Flavors of China, the Chinese restaurant 0f Bar-b-Q and not Bar-B-Q per se.

Location: Park Street . Cant miss it. the entrance is after Bar-B-Q

Been going here for over a decade now. First things first, there is no such thing as AUTHENTIC chinese in Kolkata. Even high priced outlets such as Mainland China, Pan Asian at Sonar etc have all Indianised their food to suit our palates. And oh the stuff you get at Tangra joints?. Ask a true blue Chinese from China and they will be shocked at what is being dished out as Chinese fare!. A heads up- REAL chinese food does not use Ajinomoto or MSG.

Back to Flavors of china-- Its a fast paced, mass produced and efficiently run joint specialising in Indian flavored Chinese. Good place to go if you are looking for Indian chinese.

The two key dishes that top are Devils Chicken (very hot!) and the veg hakka noodles ( the textural elements of the vegetables and the quality of the noodles are very, very good).

Try this joint out once. You may or may not like it!. As for me.. the place has grown on me and i go there almost once a month.

People love this place, people hate this place, but one thing can be said with surety about this evergreen restaurant which  located in center of restaurant district (read: park street), the owner of  this place has got LUCK better than most people do in their 7 lives combined! 

Its always full... weekdays lunch/supper/dinner time. 
weekends:- let me put it this way... people of every age are willing to wait for as long as it as takes to get a table in this restaurant. 

Great food. NOISY place. Chinese selections are old-school classics! Indian food is yummy as well.

It was the first time that we got a pay cheque and after roaming around aimlesslessly around Park St for around half an hour we decided to try out Flavors Of China at Bar-B-Q.
The first thing that strikes you abou this place is how beautifully they have done up their interiors..had we been a huge group,even then we would have been cosy there..
Secondly,they have separate menu cards for food and drinks..but its advisable not to go for drinks here( especially if you have Oly Pub within walking radius :p) for the very simple reason that they are over priced.
Now coming to the food,the chinese here is delectable both in quality and quantity :D a bowl of fried rice would be hard to finish unless ur born wid a huge appetite like mine. We also had shredded chicken in chli garlic sauce which was mildly spicy as our side dish..it was a good choice..Washed all of it with the trusty Thums Up (a Glass of which btw costs 65 RS here..Ouch!)..So much for payday joys :D

A good place to go for a Lunch or Dinner. Reasonable. Moreover , the Ambience is Good. But in the weekends , the place becomes slightly clumsy/crowded. from the menu.... devil's chicken and chicken n hot garlic sauce was good....along with golden fried prawns. barbeque rice and chowmein was also gd....and one more thing..... the quantity is very gd....so kp it n mind b4 ordering..... i found that 1 maindish is enuf fr 2.....!!! from the indian... i only had d masala kulcha nd chicken bharta...both wer gd....!!!

the starters are fantastic specially drums of heaven and devil's chicken but somehow i felt in my only visit that the quality of the main course is not worth the price they charge. strongly recommend not to go for a specific cuisine rather mix and match indian and chinese to have a better experience.

The place serves delicious chinese cuisines. The Hakka noddles is a must try.  The quality for the food is well maintained.

Another beast in the taste is the American Chopsuey. The service is decent but bad in peak hours. And the ambiance is really nice.

Make sure you reserve your place otherwise be ready to wait for hours in the queue especially in the evening hours. The place is in high demand on Friday, Saturday and Sunday where no reservation is allowed, so beware!

The verdict:-
Food/Taste - 4/5
Service - 3.5/5
Value for Money - 3.5/5
Ambiance - 4/5

Taste worth the wait!

The establishment has 2 entrances..one going up to Bar B Q and the other going unto Flavours of China. I really enjoy the food here. However today its more about the overall dining experience not just the food. No fault of Bar B Q but dining at Park Street can be a logistical nightmare. Once you've figured out the direction of traffic you red to find a place to park. Once you've found a place to park you'll have to stand in a queue for about 30 mins. Once you've finished your meal and come back to the car, you'll have to argue with an errant parking attendant out to fleece you.

Times have changed and like many restaurants on Park Street bar B Q has the advantage of being on the most popular street in the city. If I were to shift the restaurant to a south cal I have my doubts about its survival. Its time it adapted to a new age and era of hospitality.

great ambience ....  simply  great  ambience , go there for the ambience & the food  ..... but do not drink over  there ,  drinks  are extremely costly A Peg of jack daniels  will cost you  Rs  600 /  60 Ml peg , a  peg  of  Director's special will cost you Rs 170 / 60 ml peg  , whereas a  750 ml bottle of director's  special  will cost  you Rs 550  , which means the retail price of  director's  special  per  60 ml  peg  is around  Rs 50 / 60 ml peg  , which means again  that bar-b q is charging you more than 3 times  ( 3 X  )  the  original  price ....  but coming to food .... the food  is great out there  ,  the quantity is  sumptuous  &  the  quality is  excellent ...  try  out  " Flavours Of CHINA " in Bar-B -q , a really good deal  , plus the amazing  ambience  .... the ambience  here is  mindblowing  ,  but a  note of caution  , try to go there  Before 6.50 Pm  otherwise you will find it difficult to get a seat , also a  NO GO  ZONE for STAGs  , it is mainly for couples & family

Nice ambience, good food, a bit crowded, which may be a problem for most of the park street restaurants at peak hours... The service was friendly. Great value for money.

And the menu uploaded here in Zomato is old (from 2009), cost for two now is around 750 Rs. without alcohol.

Just today again went to bar-b-q.once again i was forced to fall in love with this place..today we planned to mix up chinease and Indian. We ordered Murg kalimirch kebab,mutton seekh kebab,drums of heaven ,chicken hot and sour soup and chicken won ton soup. the mutton seekh kebab was even softer than my coushion,i just loved it. feeling like going tomorrow again.

then in the main course i ordered chelo kebab,i liked this quite more than a famous restaurant. And we also ordered pea pulao,mutton rogunjush mixed hakka noodles. All the foods were just too good we ended up by licking our fingers. and the preice was quite cheap. and no complain about stuff and ambiance.It was always top class.

food was very nice...quantity and quality both are acceptable..this place has lots of memories attached with me..n the best thing i like about them is they are so consistent...

the place is good, in your budget also. we three went there for dinner and was charged near about a thousand; though we over-ordered (realized after the food was served). the quantity of the food served was huge. a dish is enough for two. we had to waste half of the food as we were too full. the quality is also good, the prawn-preparations were tasty. over-all a nice place.  :)

My girlfriend took me to this place on my birthday. It was the first time I had been to Bar-B-Q. It was two years back and I still remember the experience. Their pan fried veg noodles is absolutely delicious as are the other items. The staff is very polite and as prompt as possible. I have been to that place a lot of times and except once, I have never been dissatisfied. I love this place so much that I took my parents when they visited Kolkata.

This is very Indianised chinese...
they just put a lot of red chilly powder in their food to make it spicy... this will make ur stomach and mouth burn...
the service is decent and so is the place...
it has a nice feel to it...
they price their food appropriately and the portions are sufficient...
Chinese food could become more authentic though

This is one place thats always crowded , therefore if you are planning to drop down make sure you have a reservation. Yum food(reasonable price)..Drums of chicken, chilly prawns, hunan chicken is a must try. This is one of my fav place when it comes to chinese and above all located in park street so after a quick dinner you also can explore other options. Every time am in kolkata i make it a point to visit this place.

Service too is good although at one instance we were served stale food but the waiter immediately changed and replaced the order. 
Over all a happy tummy!!

Good destination for Chinese and Indian food. I have tried Chinese here on my Kolkata trip. The food was good. I ate only Veg dishes. But i have heard that Non-Veg is much more popular.  If you are a vegetarian then do try Crispy fried Baby Corn. Ambiance is nice and staff is very courteous. Rates are moderate. Overall a good food joint for enjoying Chinese delicacies and enjoying some quality time.

Ok, I would'v given 4.5 rating if I could'v got a proper table. I din't even bother to visit this place during the Durga puja's here in Kolkata for the extreme rush & unpleasant quality. Wanted to try the Indian food this time so went for the Chelo kabab (just to see the difference between Petercat), Butter Chicken, Butter Naan & Lime Cordial. I don't drink but had to settle in the ground floor beside the bar for all the 1st floor was packed. The food wasn't disappointing. The Non Veg Chelo Kabab was good but the Butter Chicken & Naan was worthy of pats on the chef's   back. The ambiance was nice, Pocket pinch for these items were Rs.700 which was not too much according to taste & placement of the restaurant. Will surely be visiting again.

The food has been top quality over the years. Both chinese and indian are great to taste. I got to talk to the owner in one of the flights and I asked him the secret behind the consistency,he said well we have the same chef:) I'm sure it must have been hard for him to keep him tied. Now that the puja is around,all you kolkata visitors do give it a try you would come out satisfied.

The major thing is Chinese (though always preferred the tangra chinese), But a hot favorite with the office crowd for celebrations.

Someone had wrangled a deal to take own bottle & sit on the first floor, Chinese, for the pure indian, some paneer, chicken kababs (do not know if they cook it or get it from outside:)) Also remember to count the dishes and soft drinks or likely to be over charged.

All in all a place, but not something where I would go willingly.

The crispy konjee chicken and rice noodles are amazing n so's the chili pork but the staff can try to be a little more attentive towards what the customer is wanting... at least remember what was ordered and serve the same food... but yea, other nice.the delicious food makes up for the lack in service.

Guys beware. Book Bar B-Q, Kolkata in advance and pay full amount at your own risk. The managers at Bar B-Q, think they have every right to mistreat a person. I had one of the worst experiences of my life, today. My sister had lovingly booked a dinner for me and my wife on our first anniversary. One Mr. peter, who by his own admission is the God of Bar b q, treated us as if we had come uninvited. I had politely asked him to shift my seat to a different table to which his curt reply was that I have to take that table only and no other table can be allocated to me. When I argued that its illogical, his reply was that either I take that or leave. All this while even though I was talking politely, he was hell bent on making me leave the place without having my dinner. I said that I wanted another table and I am willing to wait. His first reaction was that then I have to wait for 45 mins.  When I agreed , he told me that there are few other tables upstairs and I can go there. When I reached upstairs I was informed that this place is not for family. I still had my dinner since I was in noo mood to spoil my first anniversary.
The experience had left me shaken about the quality of service offered in Bar b q. I would really like to narrate my tell to the owners of Bar b q (if there is any1 beyond Mr. Peter) and appreciate if anyone can lead me to him.
