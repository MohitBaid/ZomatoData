We tried their cakes at the bidhannagar mela 2017. The plum cake is rich and tasty and moist. The milk cake is smooth as well. The marble cake looks good and rltastes good as well. I liked the orange cake best because it had a light hint of orange flavour and nothing very strong. The prices at the counter were reasonable as well.
