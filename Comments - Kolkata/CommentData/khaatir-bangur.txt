Amazing food. In love with the veg fried rice and the chicken drumstick :)
Want to try more of the items on the menu. Hence not giving full ratings.

Ordered drums of heaven, veg pulao and chicken bharta on Saturday 11/11/17. Drums of heaven was awesome but the pulao and chicken bharta I didn't like. Chicken bharta was bland and pulao contained so big chunks of veggies and no salt.

We took food from here this afternoon..
Ordered chicken patiala, mixed fried rice and schezwan chicken... The chicken patiala is egg wrapped chicken..the gravy was a bit bland but Huge in quantity just at 200bucks.
The mixed fried rice can serve more than 2people and schezwan chicken was the best.
All these for 515 bucks.

I ordered 2 Fish fry, 1 Veg pulao and 1 dish of Chicken do pyaza. Veg pulao and Chicken dish tasted awesome, but the fish  fry  was too small in its size and in taste also. Moreover fish fry was overcharged. The quality and quantity of fish fry should be improved. Otherwise everything is more  or less oküëç

Khaatir is a basically take away joint, and also serves via Swiggy home delivery system. However they are quite fast to make the food. In true sense they sell a good number of rolls most of the time. They have a handful of Indo-Chinese dishes to offer. 

Well I am rating it 3.5 out of 5, the reason is the taste they bring into the plate. That's above standard in most of the cases.

We had our order of a plate each of chicken drumstick, chicken fried rice, and Manchurian chicken home delivered. Quantity wise the food was sufficient to be shared by 2 people. The drumsticks were delicious and had a flavour much different from other restaurants. 
The fried rice was full of meat and corn. It tasted very nice. Manchurian was a bit disappointing. The size of the chicken pieces were smaller than usual and the gravy base was on a sweeter side. 

Although our delivery was highly delayed due to some problem with the kitchen, the lip smacking drumstick and fried rice made up for the delay..

Tried their "Vegetable Pulao", "Patiala Chicken" & "Chicken Hot-n-sour Soup". Every item tasted average to me. The pulao and patiala chicken were over sweetened. However, the patiala chicken looks great. It have two different colors of gravy, red & white, though both tasted same to me. The soup lacks the charm of two opposite sense of tastes, it was a bit watery too

I have tasted better food in this price range from other local restaurants. In my opinion they have to improve their food. Overall, it was not a satisfactory experience.

Drumsticks was very nice, yummy and tasty.

Mix chow Was good too. Though overspicy made with black pepper. Completely avoidable though.

Gravy chilli chicken was very standard. Neither too great nor too shabby.

Price is also OK.

Celebrated my birthday dinner by ordering food from Khaatir since I was too lazy to go out. For starters, we had Chicken Schezwan Wings, Chicken Drumsticks and Chicken Lollipop. The drumsricks were tasty. Rest two were okayish. Coming to the main course, we had Chicken biryani which came with the mandatory potato and an egg. The potato, unfortunately wasn't boiled well. But the chicken piece was huge and soft. Along with that, we had Chicken Meethi Malaikari and Hyderabadi Chicken. The hyderabadi one was great. Overall, the food is good. Cheaper than places like Aminia or Arslan. They don't have any desserts though. Wish they some firnee.

I had ordered in from this place today as I was at home and didn't feel like going out. I had ordered from Zomato  itself and I am very thankful that they took the pains of delivering the food even after ordering at 10:30 at night. 
I had ordered the Mutton Biryani and am quite impressed by the quantity and quality. 

The Mutton piece is really nice and big and the Biriyani itself tasted great. Thanks again Khaatir, you really lived up to your name and did utmost Khaatir to this hungry guy at 11 at night. 

Looking forward to eating at Khaatir again. Xüòäüòäüòäüòäüòä

 They make the chicken egg roll with the chicken kebabs capsicum,fresh sauteed onion,green chilli etc! It was quite good to taste a well stuffed roll after a long time,in my country and specially my own city, 
I'll give it a try again sometime,as they've many more such dishes to get explored!!!

A pocket friendly and economical outlet when it comes to having delectable dishes both in the chinese and indian section.This newly opened outlet is located near dumdum park.I ordered mix chowmein,schezwan chicken wings ,2 plates of biriyani and patiala chicken
Mix chowmein had lots of shredded chicken,prawns and eggs in it.The taste was fine,it was not at all oily and it had subtle flavours .Quantity was enough for two people.
Chicken wings were the best,they had the perfect crunchiness and properly coated with schezwan sauce .A plate contains 8 pieces of chicken.
Coming to the biriyani,it had one big leg piece of chicken,one egg and one piece of potato.Taste was great ,again it was also not at all oily and flavours were perfect to mesmerize your taste buds .
Chicken patiala-The combination of white and red gravy it is. This dish is so interesting ,it had small pieces of chicken covered with a layer of omlette and the white gravy is a bit on the sweeter side .
And it is so reasonable, all these for rs 690 only.And the quantity of each item was more than enough.
So i would suggest everyone to give it a try.Kudos to your team.

The Owners are Well Educated & very hospitable.
The Chinese Snacks are yummy & seemingly healthy. Also The Moghlai dishes are mouth watering, Patiala Chicken+ Laccha Paratha is a must try.Overall, Very Good Food Quality.
If you are looking for Star category food at reasonable price.. Try Khaatir.

I had KHAATIR delivered BULK ORDERS for my PARTIES, my Guests are SUPER IMPRESSED !!
