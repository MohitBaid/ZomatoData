Everything in this place apart from its name is bad. This place is as shady as one can be. Its basically a singing bar and is visited by people you would not like to have for company. And they prevent you from taking pictures even if its yours. Avoid this place at all costs.

Situated at a very prominent location of ajoynagar on EM Byepass. The place is next to Haji Ali take away counter. The first floor is a singing bar with a very shady crowd. 2nd floor has a better and silent option for 4 tables. The Food is decent.

I would suggest girls not to even think of this place as an option because of the recent incident which we faced.
The dingy, smelly stairways lead you to second floor sitting area of this restaurant which doesn't serve any kind of beer except kingfisher! And even the food menu they have, doesn't have all items at a given time except for a handful.
There is no decor/ambiance, it is visited by very cheap crowd of people which won't suite any girl belonging from good family. Even for guys i would suggest the nearby and the only affordable bar at this locality, that is gossip. Prices are almost similar that of both, so choose wisely guys!

Haha! Small bar cum restaurant just few metres away from Ajay nagar! Name sounds a perfect destination for bong couple but the story is completely different. Not to take out your girl for sure or you might end up having a brk up! This is low class bar cum restaurant only recommended for anyone who just wanna get high without caring about food or ambiance

What a unique name for a restaurant. So, if you are waiting for someone to come and visit you, you need to make sure the person (read : the customer) likes your food and ambience. Recommended for 'chammakÂ challo' public. :D

I thought studying engineering was the biggest mistake I've ever made in my life before walking into this bar. One word, sleazy! Ridiculous performers were singing there shady meaningless songs off the tune. I even saw a person giving away 1000 rupees to a singer with the intention of doing something indecent! Don't, I repeat don't ever go there! Place HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED!

The moment you step inside, the whole ambiance will make you feel uncomfortable. It's shady and puny. There are 2 service floors, the first one, where the music is too loud and terrible and the 3rd where the waiter would watch t.v. while serving food or watch your female companion. The cheap booze which attracts very shady and ill mannered takes away its only positive. On top of that, the place seems seedy. Avoid if possible.

i truly agree with the above reviews... this bar sucks.. i was unaware of it's ambiance but all my effort searching for a good pub gone in vain as soon as i entered... the worst part is the  sound inside was killing and the singers were sub standard.. lack of space and quality and services.. a zero to this bar...

Tumi Asbe Bole - This bar borrows it's name from a famous song of Anjan Dutta but barely lives up to it. It's a song bar & the singers can barely sing. The bar is not at all spacious & they will not shy away from that fact & volume is at its pick. Nothing to write much as we had literally ran away after the singer started her 2nd song. Overall Verdict: Visit Not Recommended
