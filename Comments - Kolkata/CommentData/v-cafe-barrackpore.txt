Good restaurant if finding something on the cheaper end. Interior is really dark. Doesn't serve regular water which was really awkward. Food quantity and taste is good

Mahi hara bhara and jalpari biriyani are the two must try items here. Never fails to delight the taste buds. As far as quantity is concerned price is on the high side though.

Once a good place is now sadly a dreary restaurant with okayish food and ill behaved uninformed staff. Orders arrive pathetically late. Hariali kabab was good. Mixed fried rice and chilli chicken- nothing too great. And anyone who serves that less ice cream- no I cannot love you.

Horrible experience !
 THE MOST UNCULTURED RESTAURANT IN TODAY’S MARKET PLACE . Guys if you have been to barrackpore .. I suggest never visit this place since manager and waiters behave as if you have come to there place and having food without paying any money . THE PARK, DADA BOUDI HOTEL,WESTWIND,SPICEGARDEN,AMINIA are far better than V CAFE  IN BARRACKPORE

Never go to this place if you have already been to some good cafe's before. Coz you would suddenly notice a bunch of uncultured waiters nd managers will start showing their true colours. The cafe was almost running out of people when we entered. As soon as we finished our food,  their most important concern was when we would leave it.  Nd their actions were horrible. No cafe nd restaurants turn off fans where are you still sitting, nd no managers just come thrice just to ask,  if we are done or not.  Then they would take everything away one by one,  even glasses filled with water also which i was about to drink,  just as you were finished with your food.  I would suggest frst learn how to behave with customers,  nd moreover food in my home are better cooked.  Rating should be in minus.

The ambience and decor is good.The food is a little bit overpriced but the quality won't let you complain about anything at all. Behavior and serving time is really amazing. The bar on the other hand has a narrow range of availability.

I used to go to V-Cafe often, until it became a bar. Now, they serve hard alcoholic drinks as well, and the food quality has fallen. Even street food tastes better than what was served here. Today, on 30/9/2017, I went to V-Cafe and saw that there was a special Puja menu-card. I ordered Tengri kebabs and Fish finger for starters. They took the order, and after a while, a waiter returned to inform us that Fish fingers weren't available. I'd noticed them serving Fish fries to all the other customers, and this waiter started insisting that we order the Fish fry as well. With no other option, I conceded.
The Chilli chicken in the main course tasted so bad that it was virtually inedible. It had a few lumps of white meat dunked in sauce. This sort of "food" is fine for intoxicated customers who can barely understand what they're eating.

I never ate this kind of worst quality of food in any restaurant..the food was not fresh and the main thing service is not up to the mark.... So considering all of these things, i suggest not to visit the restaurant... I ordered kadai chicken, butter tanduri roti and chicken biriyani.. and all the item were not hot...this is not like aminia, hayat , dada boudi resturant in Barrackpore

Worst food being served. Have you ever eaten a sweet garlic schicken? The meat wasn't tenderised. The quality of the food was very poor. In every aspect the condition of the hotel seems a disaster . Should close the restaurant instead. The manager said due to puja rush food quality was like this . Do hell with the puja days there are other restaurants as well serving the same food with a better quality. Being a CHEF  I request people never to visit this place again

I like the ambience too but the price is a little on the higher side as compared to the other restaurant s in barrackpore.

The first thing that a service provider should always have is the behavior of the employees. only after then comes the quality of service. It pains to say that V-Cafe gave me the worst experience in terms of staff. I went there with my friend for some good time. We left with a sad mood. One of the staffs talked in a rude manner after we had dined. I have no idea why he did so as everything was pretty chill before that. I felt especially bad that he talked rudely to my friend who is one of the nicest persons. My recommendation: AVOID THIS PLACE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET INSULTED WITHOUT ANY REASON.

I am sorry to say this but had a very bad experience with this restaurant. The biriyani costs ₹250 but its the worst ever biriyani one can have. both in taste and  quality. And the waiters also dont listen to the needs of the customers. They serve at their own will. I had this experience when I asked them to serve biriyani. Never have I seen gravy in biriyani, the worst ever, and I asked them not to serve the gravy part, they turned a deaf ear to us. The kababs are also very bad in quality. When we asked them to give a mocktail.. they made us wait for 30 mins for that and we had to pursue them repeatedly, then they served us. The Muhghlai food section is utterly pathetic so is the service.

2 years back came to Barackpur for an exam & had dinner with family at this restaurant located exactly opposite to Barackpur Railway Station. The restaurant is an average one.

They served some snacks firstly as we had our seats & came with 2 big handi pots filled with their v cafe special biriyani & murg biriyani almost 20 long minutes after ordering. Food wasn't very special but was OK. Quantity was enough for three of us.I think in that special biriyani they staffed almost everything they had!!! There were fried prawns,big chunks of mutton,chicken boiled eggs with egg omlet on top.

 It was good but these kind of all in one 'special' biriyani is not my personal favourite. So an average experience.

Its just that i previously went a lot many times i was highly satisfied but not satisfied yesterday , heard there is a change in cook.

I was a bit surprised to see a very meagre rating for the restaurant, as from what I have felt from all the surrounding restaurants (keeping the legendary competition in mind), this is the best place to have food if you are in Barrackpore and dont want biriyani. The ambiance is very good with a good quality of service. The staff are well behaved and food is delivered to the table quickly enough. Now lets come to the food. I have tasted a variety of chicken kebabs here and to be honest, all of them tasted very good. The main thing about a kebab, the softness of the meat, is well taken care of here. The hyderabadi biriyani itself was good enough. The kadhai chicken as well is cooked very well. Yes the quantity is not that great, but from all I've tasted the food is pretty good and definitely worth a visit.

Once was a favorite spot of barrackporians to dine,Now a total different scenario.
The food lacks it's zing in quality and quantity.
Flavors are blunt when you opt for Chinese.
Only the Indian dishes are mediocre in taste. The decor is pretty basic.. they never renovated it also from last ten years. 
Price is on a higher side..in my last visit I was disappointed with their food and the staffs behavior (too rude).

Conclusion - Location wise it's a hit spot, easily can pull up the business with better food presentation and quality.Even I feel if they serves good, price won't be a matter for concern.
Just for the old times I'm giving 3 points to V Cafe.

Located just outside the raikway station at Barrackpore, this is a very popular restaurant with a separate bar section, providing a good variety as option at reasonable price. Ambience is good and is common with youngsters as well as families.

Being a resident of barrackpore, I visit this place often. Its one of the costliest restaurants in barrackpore. Easy to locate, right infront of railway station.
Only high end drinks are given in restaurant area. They recently opened a separate bar. Mocktails are a must try. Ambience is good and so is staff behaviour. If u don't mind to spend, go for it.
But, u can get the same food at much cheaper rate in the vicinity.

Been there several times... one of our most favourite hangouts. The food quality is simply outstanding, given the location it is situated in.  The ambience is not something worth going crazy about... but it is decent with some not-so-loud music playing at your back.
Coming to the food part, I don't know why some of my fellow Zomatians rated it so low, I personally felt it to be good enough for revisits. The VCafe Special Biriyani is brilliantly cooked in Hyderabadi style served with 2 pieces tender mutton and 2 pieces jumbo prawn as well. The quantity is perfect for two. Rogini Murgh is also a dish worth mentioning. But my all time personal favourite in which no other restaurant could win over VCafe is their Golden Fried Prawn. Absolute bliss to the taste buds. *_* I recommend this to all. Lastly, the staffs are courteous and prompt. :-) 4.5 up for VCafe.

This is a good restaurant in barrackpore. But yes extremely overpriced in terms of quality. The place is quite small. The waiters are busy mostly so the service isn't that good.
Now the food quality is good but taste isn't something that lingers. For some dishes its really good and for the others its not. The most interesting point is the same dish might be very tasty today but when you visit the next time that same dish might be tasteless. Thus there is no consistency as well. So will not rate it good, since at lesser price you can get better food in barrackpore.

A perfect place to hang out with friends as well as to go out with family. Situated in the heart of Barrackpore this restaurant rocks. Good food, good hospitality and good ambiance makes this the best among all in Barrackpore. Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, Chicken Tandoori, Chicken steamed Momos, Chicken Tikka Kebab, Paneer Tikka, Mutton Biriyani and Hakka Noodles are my personal favorites in this restaurant and I would advise all of you to try once. The roasted papad which they serve as welcome dish to every guest is a commendable gesture. Although the service is not prompt however the soothing ambiance with music and papad makes your wait interesing. :)

The good gateman of this restaurant would always wish you Good Morning or Good night or Thankyou.  I have been in this restaurant like a thousand times and sat in every corner. The Biriyani is not so finger licking. The vegetarian dishes aren't so good either. The Mutton dishes have a quite delicious tangy flavour which is not quite same as any other restaurant.  Dal Makhani is okayish. It is however, A proper place for family dinner.

They play a certain music which is not soothing to every ear. The service is excellent. One should try the Lime Soda. Its almost equivalent to Virgin Mojito from KFC! 
Compared to other restaurants, this place is a bit too pricey. For the past ten years, they have changed the prices atleast 20 times.

I still remember, I was in my 2nd year when they opened it. We just talk about its coffee but never dared to visit it due to the fear of costlier foods. But visited it while in my college itself and never missed the chance to be there. This place served so many times as a meeting point for my clients and have some quality time with good drinks and Awadhi Biryani(the cuisine which I like most here). They serve finger licking foods and that too in pocket friendly prices.

We, the people of Barrackpore, have so limited choices if we want to dine out, that even the sub standard ones make good business here for ages. One such example is this V-Cafe. When it was started, around 12 years ago, it was a nice place. But, over the years, the condition has deteriorated rapidly. I went with my friends here, last Friday, for dinner. The food was not good. Too much of turmeric in chicken lemon coriander soup.Chicken tikka masala was sweet in taste.the only saving grace was the chicken bharta. The waiters were rude and not well-informed. They misled us into believing that the chicken tikka masala dish will have small 4 pcs of boneless chicken, so we ordered accordingly, but when it arrived, we found 4 enormous chicken pcs. Also, when we complained to one of the waiter , that we are waiting for the main dish for around 45mins, he didn't have the basic manner to apologize. Instead, he blamed us for not ordering the main course along with the starters. The +0.5 is for the cozy ambience, which still remains the same. It's better to look for other options than going and wasting your time, money and patience here.

Being a Barrackpurian, i have been to this place couple of times(as i didn't have any choice) and to say the least, everytime the food was disappointing. I think they provide the same gravy for any dish you order, say, chicken or mutton and the chicken and mutton pieces are too hard to eat. Ambience and service is good. Price is not appropriate according to the quality of food they provide. Never ever order mocktails here by seeing the interesting names. It will only effect your stomach and for sure you will suffer from indigestion. Overall, i would say , a very overhyped and overrated restaurant .

This restaurant, since its inception, has been serving up mouth-watering dishes in a classy way for a reasonable price. I really don't understand why people have given it such bad ratings, but I really think that it is one gem of a restaurant. And my personal favourite is the V-Cafe special Biriyani (Rs.350+taxes). It has two pieces of perfectly cooked mutton, a fair amount of steaming basmati rice and 2 large sized prawns, and the whole dish takes your taste buds to a joy ride that your soul shall never forget. So if you visit northern part of the city, do drop by. I'm sure you'd be pleased.

v.cafe, is one of the leading restaurant in barrackpore, at least people believe so, few days back just had a terrible experience of it.
well the food is pretty good compare to barrackpore, & the price too. being a hospitality fellow what makes me irritate was grumpy face & arrogant behaviour of an executive. it was by mistake wrong food had reach to our table, & he started shouting on service guy in front of us, that again  kept us on waiting for long. after that he never  care to come & assist us for  any  further, was feeling uncomfortable +  uneasy  too,  failed to understand, for what  actually we are paying high ? is that only food? then it should not be that high.

not going to visit the place in future, being an executive he must learn some courtesy, & above all how to get communicate to a guest.

the ambience was good with dim lights but the location of our table wasn't good...
first we were served with the makhmali kebabs the name n the dish were completely different it was generally the chicken reshmi kebabs... the pieces were good but the could have been more soft and juicy.. then we were served with nun and mutton do piyaza the nun was good and the mutton also m not a mutton fan i just tasted the gravy which actually tasted good.....
then we were served with kashmiri pulao and kadhai chicken... both these dishes were horrible
the kashmiri pulao i jst never had something so bad and the taste was very bad.. then the chicken i told the waited for less gravy but he told it does not contain much but when served it had a thick bowl full gravy and and it neither tasted good..
we were very disappointed with the food quality of this resturant.. but people here doesnt have any option then this...

V-Cafe,  was once the pride of Barrackpore. It helped the people to explore a muti cuisine standard without going to Kolkata. This is just opposite Barrackpore Railway Station, hence easily accessible and attracts visitors.It was popular family dine out. I am one of the visitors  from its initial days. In early days, they  really worked hard to establish themselves. There food quality was above average and innovative. But  after receiving the bar license it started  loosing the popularity. Rather being a family dine out it has become a hang out place. Rather than choosing chinese cuisine which just revolve around chilli chicken full of garlic and fried rice its better to opt for Indian cuisine they are quiet good on that field.I have personally tried  chicken lollipop and man chow soup which was good enough. Their Indian main course are above average. Qua- e- avadh  biriyani is also good  but the mixture of spices was not done properly.One can visit here for having passing by lunch or early evening dinner.

This is situated bang opposite Barrackpore railway station. The locational advantage brings in customers. As far as the food is concerned , they have no special or signature dish. The food is average and i do not find any dish mention able. The price is almost like any  good restaurants at Kolkata which is  high for this place. I feel the space is bit cramped and having a eating joint at the basement is not very safe so far as the fire safety is concerned.

When asked about the availability of the beer the waiter told us only 2 varieties are available whereas on menu card there were almost 6-7 variety. I was quite disappointing. With it we ordered dry chilli chicken. Nothing special about the food. Quite average one. This place has deteriorated over ages.

The biggest problem in barrackpore is that there are no decent food joints unlike kolkata where you get restaurants at galore and most of them serve good quality of food. U have eaten in this restaurant in two occasions and both of these times i was really disappointed with the food, i ordered chinese food and basic stuff chinese chowmein and garlic chicken, firstly i would say that pieces of chicken were too huge and should be cut into smaller pieces. Next thing is that the restaurant should understand that quite a lot of time there may be a single customer that may come to the restaurant and would like to  have a meal at the restaurant but when they order the food the quantity for one person is just too much and most of the time we land up parceling the food, which i find is quite ridiculous and most of the time the food goes to waste, since the restaurant is actually catering to two heads and not one person. The chowmein certainly lack the taste of chowmein. The cabbage should not be served in the chowmein as the chowmein would get bad fast,

the best of the barrackpore has become the worst part of it. its all detoriating and in no time it will become a pety fl on shop. i dont know why it writes multicuisine,its more of a horrible cuisine of tacky chinese n yucky indian food. 
i remember a time back in 2003 when me and one of my friend used to go there and eat chicken butter massalla and tandori roti. the bill used to be hrdly 110 rs. 
but believe me the taste was so fantastic. the chunks of chicken were so soft, the massalla was tasty and even the tandor roti s used to remain soft for so long in that chilled ac.
yes, it was a name 10 years back. the staffs were so polite,so courteous. everything was so good about them. they used to prepare the best fresh lime soda in town.
but ,alas they opted for a bar license and everything went down. the family disappeared, the couples disappeared, the name went down. It became a place for drunkards.
though now the separated the bar and the restaurant,but still that name V-cafe is history.

Used to our favorite haunting ground when we were in school. Still a favorite with school friends when we get to get hold of each other once a while, given that we are scattered in different parts of the country now. We used to find the food great back in early 2000s. But honestly, the food is pedestrian to say the least. Chinese/Indian - whatever you may order, neither tastes great. The service size isn't great either. There isn't too much competition, hence it still continues to draw in a lot of people. Also, this is bang opposite Barrackpore Railway Station, hence easily accessible.

However, as far as food is considered, nahh...not worth it.

Nothing extra ordinary to mention about this place.. Decent food served everytime I visit this place, except for one instance when my Crispy Chilli Babycorn somehow tasty too saucy.. But otherwise no complains.. They occupy two floors of the building opposite Barrackpore station. The upper floor serves alcohol as well, and the basement does not (atleast that's what we were told).. Also the establishment on the upper floor is very cramped and feels suffocating after a few minutes.. Worth a 3..

V-Cafe, which was once the pride of the area is detoriating day by day. 

The restaurant, just opposite the barrackpore railway station, is an easily accessible place. The prices are low and the food quality is good. All of these points add to its successful run.

But, the quantity of the food is a bit less. The food tastes just okay and some preparations like the paneer chilli or the lemon chicken are a complete let-down.

The restaurant is averagely decorated but the staff behaviour is really bad. The service is delayed and also,their attitude is not worth mentioning.

Only recommended for quick bite-ups.

located just opposite to the barrackpore station, it is an easily accessible place. known to all who stay in and around bkp, the indian cuisine that they serve is no doubt very tasty. the malai kofta was very soft along with the butter nun. the chicken butter masala was very yummy especially the gravy.....worth a visit every once in a while. but the price hurts when you have a plan to watch a movie in jayanti cinemas just nearby since the total pocket pinch goes higher.

This place is close to barrakpore station.This place might not be very well decorated or have fancy spoons or knives but their food is quite good according to their price.The prices are quite reasonable and food is up to the standard.
I must say to try their daal makhni and chicken varta,these dishes are just awesome. Rotis and rice dishes are also good.

Still there are many ways how the service can be improved,because the time i visited their manager was not a very nice person,as i was served burnt naan and I talked to them about it,he did not give a hid to it,rather kept arguing.But at a place like barrakpore its a good one.

I am regular at this joint for more than 3 years now , this is the best restaurant of the Barrackpore sub-division. Succulent Jumbo Prawns, tender Roasted Chicken are part of their multifarious menu. Impressive cellar , courteous staff makes every visit a pleasant experience. Keep up the great work.
