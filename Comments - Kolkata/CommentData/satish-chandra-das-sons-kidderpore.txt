"Satish Chandra Das & Son's" a.k.a "Satish Moira" is one such sweet shop in calcutta which promises to carry on the legacy of sweetness and happiness by not only updating itself with the trend of flavours but also by application of traditional techniques with a twist of modern art.
The characteristic feature of Satish Moira is how they concentrate on their BASE i.e the CHANA itself and the whole process is about revolving around the basic with modifications according to the trend,thus creating variety.

One such trendsetter of the MISHTI FESTIVAL at City Center 2,Kolkata was The GST Sandesh where GST stands for Great Sweet Taste.Indulgence upon GST means mix of flavours, Strawberry & vanilla and how beatifully the two flavours are enriched is all about the GST sandesh and it's success story.
"GsT" the name itself is a market winner, hat's off to the owners for such amazing formulation of marketing strategy.

Other than GST(sandesh,not tax) the chocolate mishti,Tequila Malai and Nikutty were among the list of favourites.

Thank you "Satish chandra das & sons" for bringing a smile to our faces and rejuvenating our sweet tooth.

Satish Chandra Das oopularly known as Satish Moira offers Sandesh in a innovative way .
The visit to the recently held Mishti Festival  at CC2 has left me with an awestruck experience of the shop's sweets.
The newly introduced GST (Great Sweet Taste) sandesh has already been a hit amongst the people which is basically a thick layer of chana with different flavours injected into it.
I had GST sandesh, tequila malai,khirpully etc.

Satish Chandra Das & Sons but we know it as 'Satish Moira' offers heavenly desserts or Sandesh what we call it.
Recently visited the Mishti Fest at CC2. It was an awesome experience to try most of sweets from the stall. It was awesome.

The new Sandesh which was presented us was Great Sandesh Taste namesd as GST is three layering sandesh, a mixture of vanila and strawberry flavours. It is made of very soft Chana.

Yes better known as Satish Moira. The shop is serving in the city of “Mishti” for about more than 97 years. It being established since 1920 and knocking at the door to complete it’s century mark. Located at Khidderpore.

Visited the sweet festival – Sweets Of Bengal on occasion of the 8th Anniversary of City Centre 2 Mall, Rajarhat by AmbujaNeotia in association with t2 where Satish Moira put up a stall for sweets.

The best part that attracted me is the GST Sandesh. Myself being from a commerce background I found it very interesting. The basic thing is that they had gone with the trend, as GST is very much in trend these days. Eye Catchy…!!

I had GST Sandesh, Tequila malai, Khirpully, Chocolate Cream Sandesh, Rassomalai Cup, Keshor Malai Batty, Fruity Jelly Sandesh etc.

They say that you can take a Bengali away from Bengal, but you cannot diminish his affection for sweets. There’s an unspoken and an unbreakable bond between a Bengali and his penchant for sweets; be it a festival or any gathering sweets form an integral part of the arrangement. On the auspicious festival of Janmashtami, team Panchphoron was invited for a sweet tasting event at Satish Chandra Das and Sons. most famously known as Satish Moira.  A more detailed address of the shop is listed below.

How much Sweet is too much Sweet, you might ask. In Kolkata, the answer is: There’s no such thing!. The city of joy is famous for a lot of things, landmarks and achievements but the one which stands out in Kidderpore area is Satish Chandra Das & Sons sweet shop.It is a small but one of the best and the finest sweet shops in town, yes comparatively it is slightly out of the main city area but it is definitely worth every penny.

Janmashtami, is an annual celebration of the birth of the Hindu deity Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu.  Celebrated on the eighth day (Ashtami) of the Krishna Paksha (dark fortnight) of the month of ‘Bhadra’ (August–September) in the Hindu calendar,  across the length and breadth of India, by people following Hinduism. In fact, it is an important day for Hindus. The celebration goes on for two days. The merrymaking reaches its peak at midnight stroke,  when Aaarti is performed and Bhajans are sung to praise the Lord and making a big feast for Him. Just as we would cook some delicious dishes for our loved one’s birthday, it is also nice to go out of your way to cook some special dishes for Krishna on  the occasion of his birth. There are special dishes cooked to mark the occasion and preparing sumptuous dishes for the occasion is considered to be the most  vital part if the overall celebration Like … Taler Bora Naru Payesh and Many Other. Palm is the main ingredient of all the sweets. On this occasion Satish-Moira/ Satish Chandra Das and Sons, N-3, Fatepur, Garden Reach, Near Bandha Battala, Kidderpore, presenting various kind of sweets made of palm 😊 . I was invited there as a member of paachforon 😊 The sweets they served us are… 😊

In Bengali there is a very famous saying “Baro mashe tero parban”. This means that we Beangalis observe so many festivals through out the year. Janmashtami, is an annual Hindu festival that celebrates the birth of Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu .  On this prosperous occasion of Janmashtami , Satish Chandra Das & Sons – Satish Moira are presenting us with a brand new range of lovely sweets. Bengalis are very, very fond of sweets. A Bong meal without misti stands incomplete! After every meal,  a Bong essentially debates about the sweets they were served. Satish Chandra Das & Sons – Satish Moira The name stands true to its age old authenticity and royalty.  Sweet-lovers should visit this sweet shop for the authentic Bong sweets experience .  Presently they have their shop located in N-3, Fatepur, Garden Reach, Near Bandha Battala, Kidderpore. This sweet shop is there for years and has become a legend in Kolkata. I have been here many times and on various occasions.  Recently we got an invitation, and I with my fellow foodies attended it. The sweets were exclusively for this celebration and most of the sweets we made out of palm and others were the traditional ones and some new and unique ones too.  So here we start with

Summer time is mango time, specially for bongs, and milk made sweets are inseparable part of bong heritage. When mango blends with milk made sweets it brings heavenly delight and I am honestly greatful to "Satish Chandra Das & Sons" for introducing my taste buds to such a pleasant and joyful experience.

Every year when the chill is in the air, we get to experience this awesome ‘Nolen gur’ festival in the twin City Centre Malls (Saltlake and Newtown) in Kolkata. At this festival several renowned sweet makers from Kolkata and suburbs participate and set up temporary food stalls in the open Kund area where people can come, see, taste and buy the delicacies which can only be termed as ‘heavenly’. These delectable sweets are very close to every Bengali’s heart, and things get even more special when these sweets are prepared with fresh seasonal magical jaggery, or rather the ‘gur’. I simply can’t resist the sight of khejur gur, patali gur or joynagar er moya! Every year I visit this Nolen gur festival, and try out some sweets from almost every stall at the venue. But this year it was even more special since I was representing Panchphoron here and we were invited to be a part of this festival by Mr. Arup Kr. Das, the owner of legendary sweet shop Satish Chandra Das & Sons, also locally known as Satish Moira.

Add a sweet touch to the celebrations on this auspicious occassion of Ganesh Chaturthi with special sweetmeats from nearly a hundred year old Satish Chandra Das & Sons - Satish Moira's renowned shop.
Choose from a variety of Laddoos, modak, barfi which are being specially prepared apart from the regular favorites like khirpuli, chocolate monohora, strawberry rose etc. Not only the regular sized laddoos, you can also choose from the mega sized ones weighing between 500gms to 2kgs which the elephant god will surely love.
Priced moderately these sweetmeats are surely going to brighten up your celebrations!

Auspicious Janmashtami Special Sweet Bonanza at Satish Moira..!

The legacy of this city Is mostly defined by the historical structures, the century old trams, and the age-old fast food centers and sweet shops. One such shop would be Satish Chandra Das & Sons. Located far off at Garden Reach, close to Khidderpore, stands tall almost a century old sweet shop. Having served the erstwhile Governor Generals, popular freedom fighters and eminent personalities, their legacy still goes strong with the reputation and popularity they have garnered all these years. Reaching this place is a bit difficult, but once you do, I can assure you, you would be awed and taken aback. The best option would be to take a Ola and Uber, and put up the destination as Satish Chandra Das & Sons (Not Grandson, although it is located at 1 minute walking distance from the parent shop).

My first visit here, was on an invitation to try some of their Mango Special Sweets. Well, I would be writing a different piece for that one. This one would focus on my recent visit to cover their Taal or Palm Sweets, made on the holy and pious occasion of Janmastami. An yearly festival, to celebrate the birth of Lord Krishna, this is one festival, which is celebrated throughout the entire country with the same zeal and enthusiasm. Taal or Palm, which happened to be one of the popular food item of Lord Krishna, is cooked with respect, devotion and dedication. Satish Chandra Das & Sons, aka Satish Moira, came forward with their own preparations of Pam Sweets or other Palm Savories to make the work of devotees easy.

The items included many items. Let me touch down on a few of them. Taal er Payesh, Taal’er Bora, Tulsi Malai, Taal’er Sandesh, Taal’er Malai,Narkel Naru, Khir’er Naru, Gopal Noni, Krishna Laddu, Rosh Bora… and many others. Each of the items was prepared with love, care and much devotion towards the God Krishna. The ingredients used were of high class and impressed all of us. My favorite being the Narkel Nadu. Reminded me of my childhood, when I used to crave to my Mother to make me some Nadus. The Tulsi Malai was yet another fine portion of sweet. The Krishna Laddu was full of flavors, the Taal’er bora yet another trip to memory lane.

The festival will run till tomorrow and so will be the availability of this special sweets. So, if you were looking to pamper yourself with some fine Palm Sweets on behest of this auspicious festival, run along today. If not for anything else, the price tag against these fine quality products will make your journey and enthusiasm worthwhile.
