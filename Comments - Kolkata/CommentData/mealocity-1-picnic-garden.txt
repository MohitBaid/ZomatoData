Restaurant failed to deliver my order within stipulated timelines,  called me after 1 hour to ask the address.  The delivery boy said,  Thoda to late hota hi hai,  Kya hai usme.. All I can say to restaurants like this is Bhai mat le order.  Stay in the comforts of your four walls.

Pathetic service..... Food was supposed to be delivered by 12:13am.... Its 12:53 am now.... The food has been dispatched just 5 min back.... According to the restaurant they have 3 delivery bikes of which one is broken.... They were aware that they will not be able to deliver the food on time however they neither informed about their situation or the delay that was upon us..... Both of us (sisters) the only reason we decided to order today as we were both very tired to cook.... My sister returned home after 9 pm from work and i came home at 11 pm.....preparing and cooking would take a lot of time and we wanted to wat early and sleep early hence we ordered and here we are still waiting for the food.... Delay in delivery of food is never appreciated saying so during the day it still can be managed as we still can arrange for alternates but at this our of night all we can do is crave for the food holding our hunger
Update again.... Its 1:28 am we are still waiting for the food.... Which is, biriyani by the way and we are expecting it to be served cold which again means loss of health..... Wow..... Spoke to the owner Ravi Prakash who was supposed to call us by now hasn't called.... His restaurant worker called and said apka khana raaste pe gir gaya.... Apne gandha review jo diya.... 
Im adding 2.5 points more only because of the guy Rahul and the owner Ravi who just delivered the order at 2:03am and ensured that we dont go hungry tonight.... And the fact that they acted upon our concern as soon as they could....

The restaurant is very keen on actually honouring the special request made to them, which is something worth praise. The portions need to be worked upon, could be more generous. Biryani was nice but it lacked the salty flavour that lingers on the tongue after eating biryani, and that too needs a little attention.

Ordered food at 12:56am.. So the Delivery was made just within 45mins from placing my order. Food Quality was awsum for this price.Ordered Chicken Rezala but they rang me up & said Rezala was not available. So i had to change my order but they dod not charge me the extra amount even when i changed my order to a higher priced item which was Chicken Butter Masalla. Quantity was sufficient for an adult. 4pieces of chicken not jumbo size but moderate size with sufficient amount of gravy! Chicken was soft & tender & very tasty packed properly in a box. Tandoor Roti was a bit small in size but very soft & hot of awaum taste & good quality wraped in aluminium foil. The delivery guy of this resturant was very polite & friendly. Dont know why most of the people gave 1star review! Its completely value for money! 100% Recomended. Will order again from this resturant. ^_^

The quality is really very good chicken butter masala was really very tender and tasty and the tandoor roti was also very soft. The price is quite reasonable and the quantity is also good. They even gave some discounts at the delivery spot and i would recommend this place to everyone but speacilly for midnight hungers! Thank you Mealocity! 🖒

Mealocity is a great joint for ever-hungry-night-owls like me!!! Rates are pretty cheap and food quality and quantity is even better....you are sure to have a completely worth it purchase each time you place an order! I ordered their chicken biryani and chicken chaap combo (just Rs.120 the entire combo!) And it was a great deal.
Their pasta was so-so since they aren't authentically Italian that way...but things to order include any North Indian or Chinese food out of their menu! Also since I am subscribed to zomato treats I get free gulab jamuns (2 pieces) each time I order from this restaurant. 
If you ever need to customise your food just give them a call after you place your order, they do a great job that way!

Would have given in negative if possible
Gave my order at 12. They said would be delivered at 1.
Asked Zomato at 1.20, and then they said that they'll deliver within 15 mins. Waited till 1.45 and then again they said the same thing to the zomato executive, that we'll deliver within 15 minutes. Again waited till 2.30, at which point they didn't even pick up the phone when the executive called them up. I waited till 3,then asked zomato that I'd be unable to accept the order. They were kind enough to give me a full refund, but I needn't have worried. The delivery boy never even showed up.
Based on other reviews, this is a common practice of the restaurant.

Service-They don't deliver on time as well as they are very late(in my case it was 30min furthermore late than the given time).Also they didn't received my calls many time.

Quality- taste is good but not fresh(they said hot and tasty meal but it is just opposite).

Note - Always check your order on delivery what you ordered and what you received(missing items).

Had been observing this shop in my locality for a while. Looking at the shop expected a decent meal for the price. 
(A lot of 5/5 reviews by the owners/workers of the shop here you can judge them having only 1 review, which has pumped the rating a bit) 

Service(3/10): Careless attitude. Doesn't care about how long a customer waits. They got an order via phone, they said 20mins but they were like, "Koi baat nahi, thoda late de denge". 

Chicken Biryani(3/10): Poor quantity! The size of the chicken is as smaller than a Rs 3 samosa. Dry but cooked properly. Quantity of rice is below average. Quality is okay. (Considering their food they are not anyway better than roadside Rs 65-70 Biryani. They compromise quantity and taste. 

Chicken Chaap(3/10): 3 points to the well cooked piece. Size again, is a meagre for the price. Gravy is low to average at taste. 👎 You get bigger and better at roadside shops

Atrocious service. No sense of urgency. Extremely unprofessional. Happened both the times I ordered. Kept calling them and finally had to go and get the food. And they could not even give what I had paid for.

Worst delivery and only lying every time you call them.  They don't care at all what time it is. Had to wait for them for more than one hour even after the delivery time given by zomato. Then even zomato is not able to contact them to cancel the order.

Worst experience of online food order. I have ordered on 1:19am. The delivery time is after 45 mins. They could not even deliver by 2:30am. And the worst thing is they won't inform you for that. I had to cancel my order because it will cross 3 am to deliver the food.

Pathetic Service. Was expecting the delivery around 3:25 PM. Called them up around 3:35. "Sir, delivering in next 10 minutes. Food is out for delivery". However, nothing got delivered even around 3:45 PM. Called them up again and this time the reply was "Sir we don't have item X, can I replace it by item Y ?"
You don't expect this question after waiting for an hour. I had a guest waiting and it was a big embarrassment for me. I had to cancel the order. 
I would be the last person to order from this outlet ever.

The delivery took well over 2 hours when they are only 10 minutes away from the location. Also charged Rs 20 extra delivery fee which wasn't included in Zomato's bill.

I ordered my lunch from here. A simple menu. But the order arrived after 2 hours. By that time my lunch hour was over. The order didn't arrive at the given address, I had to leave office to get the order from outside. They were urging me for cash while the payment was already done online. They made me stand and wait while they called the restaurant to confirm online payment.

Been here few days back... Order kabab and Biryani...!! Mutton pasanda kabab was tasty man...!! Their plus point is being pocket friendly and negative point sitting arrangement but provide the service on time impressed me the most... I must visit for all & you will decide for yourself regarding to make next visit or not..!! Consider the food then it is definitely a must try....!!!!

Tried the chicken mughlai and barbeque chicken from here. Didn't expect much from this new outlet. But must say, the taste is really good.. specially the barbeque chicken was exquisite.. service was more than decent. Looking forward to trying out some more dishes here. Worth giving a try!
