Had noticed this tiny joint situated inside Quest quite a few times but never really gave it a try. One fine day after a shopping spree, I was craving for some light snack when i decided to check this place out. 

They have quite a few flavours which makes them stand out from the other popcorn places in the city. They let you taste all the flavours too which is great.

After making quite a fuss on which flavour to pick, i chose to opt for the cream and onion one. The packaging was really cute to be honest quite inexpensive. However, I wish the quality was a little more soft and fluffy. Overall its a decent choice if you are bored of homemade popcorns and the ones we get at movie theatres.

Excellent service and very courteous staffs. Delicious flavours and you can first taste all varieties before choosing one. 0.5 star reserved for still more flavours! Recommended for all people who love popcorn and want to try some exciting flavours.

Ordered the Nacho Mexican and Cheddar Cheese popcorn via Swiggy. Tasted different and really yum. Would love to try out other flavours as well.
