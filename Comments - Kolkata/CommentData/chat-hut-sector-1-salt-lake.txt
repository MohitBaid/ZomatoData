This place is located at Salt Lake Swimming pool area and I like gorging on its Bhel Muri and Papri Chat! The best part is that you can order for a delivery too!

A roadside outlet at Salt lake Swimming pool area is a treasure for chaat lovers like me.

Love their dahi fuchka, bhelpuri, paprichaat, dhoklas and samosa chaats . Tasty and mouth watering taste of chaats makes my evening a hit in a less expensive way.

Service is fast and hygienic . Ambience is  pretty crowded.

Swimming Pool got a makeover sometime back and these pretty kiosks came up. One such kiosk is this chat house. They serve awesome papri chat n muri. They price might be on the higher side but they use fresh vegetables.

It's 'The Place' for Chaat Lovers..!! Located near Salt Lake Swimming Pool, Chaat Park is a great place to visit in the evening to try their mouthwatering junkies!! A wide variety of street food like Puchka, Papdi Chaat, Bhel, Momos, Pav Bhaaji, Gola, Sikanji etc will sure excite your taste buds. Great place to chill when you're in for some tasty junk food...!! Sure deserves a 5..!! :)

PS: The best Papdi Chaat I find in town!

Being in the Swimming Pool area of Salt Lake, the food court looked inviting. Street food in Kolkata is awesome, but usually the outlets are shabby. Here the shops are housed in neat kiosks set out on the median of the road, with common seating in the middle. The place is quite organised; each kiosk is for different items. Also, the shops and surroundings are clean.
Our choice was Papri Chaat, served by Chaat Hut. Notwithstanding the good ambience, the serving was a great disappointment. This variety of Papri Chaat consisted of papris with dollops of mashed potato, topped with small amount of crushed dhokla, covered with onion, sprinkled with green chilli chutney and khatta-meetha (possibly imly and jaggery) chutney and finally sprinked with sev.
Altogether a new interpretation of Papri Chaat, sans Bhallas and Dahi! Also at Rs. 50/- per plate, served on the street median, quite expensive.
No reason to recommend.

The famous chaat place in swimming pool salt Lake, being walking distance from my place in salt Lake, I happen to visit this place often. It's always crowded and they share common seats with other kiosks,so be prepared to stand and ear. Their samosa chaat and bhel puri are nice, puchkas are decent too. Quick service and pretty hygienic :)

Although am not a huge fan of chaats, but I keep coming to this place mostly for their Phuchkas and Samosas. Swimming Pool as such was considered to be the Park Street of Salt Lake, and this place still upholds the tradition. Flocked by youngsters, with some being couples, and the rest being enthusiastic foodies, this is one place which always sees people walking in due to the quality of the food they serve.

The Samosas are tasty and equally good are the Phuchkas. You could also try their Samosa Chaats and Dhokla as well. Tea is again something these guys are very good at. All in all, an affordable place to drop by in case you want to keep your evening snacks light and less expensive.

I have been to this place many times- papri chat and bhel Puri is worth trying - chat hut has kept the bhel Puri very simple that is what I like - chutney is good the couthet is neat and clean
