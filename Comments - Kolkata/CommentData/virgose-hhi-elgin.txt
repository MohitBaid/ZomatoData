Food quality is good and Service is equally good. Though the dal makhni quality is not the same anymore but it's still ok. Starter's are far better compared to the main course.

The luxurious ambience and the different cuisine speciality hhi never fails to amaze me.
I ordered one delicious corn veg soup and some mouth watering desserts hot gulab jamun, fresh fruit cake and vanilla ice cream.
The taste of the cakes will speak of the classy quality, you can get no cakes of this taste in normal bakery shops. The homemade jamun and the vanilla ice cream was simple and good.

This a decent place for a weekend office gang outing. Do tip the staff if you are looking for a good service. For example we were served complementary jaggery rasgullas last winter. An alcohol included bash for my 5 member team was approx 13K. Ambiance is average.

Walk straight from Haldirams, Exide and you are right there ! 
Hotel Hindustan International - Sounds great ? Well, it does ! 
Virgose sounds even greater. Looks brighter. Serves better. :D

Ambience is much wow and seating arrangements is even more wow.
They have a separate smoking zone which is appreciable.
Had great food and the music that is being played sets you on the party mood. Could not sit back longer and danced to the tunes. Had a great time  !

Wanna visit again :*

Good ambience, fine finger food although lil cramped for soace but good music (House and Edm lovers will like it) makes up for that. Good for a evening chilling out. 
Courteous staff. 
On the pricier side but then the location profile matters. Of course there are better alternatives but a visit here wont leave u disappointed. Might even surprise u with a good evening.

It was just ok in terms of ambience and food. Nothing great to comment on. Considering the price expectation does go up on the food. My suggestion enjoy the drinks and move to oh Calcutta for the food.

This was definitely not my first visit to this lounge bar... Last day, I along with few colleges of mine hopped into this place. Starting with the ambience it was brilliant, awesome selection of songs, purple lighting super cozy couches. We took our seat and immediate the waiter came is for assistance with the menu, drinks had a colossal option. We ordered ciroc vodka shots and opted for dry chilli chicken and reshmi kebab for the starters. Well we didn't juggle with our choice of drink because we were extremely satiesed  with the offering. The shots were perfectly presented. With a dash of lime cordial, mint crush and ice, well frankly speaking this was customised by us. And we loved the blend. Coming to the starters the dry chilli chicken was a kick start for the eve. It was fine cooked, crispy and flavourful from outside and juicy from inside, this would give you a flavour burst, just as you take a bite..  An absolute delicacy. The reshmi kebab was the hero of the eve, served with julinned onion and indianised mint sauce, they were succulent and extremely soft from inside and was delicately flavoured and smoky from outside. 

We took several rounds of the drink and gradually fell for this place. The lighting can take to far away and the songs were perfect for the mood set. The bar tenders were active as well as interactive. The orders were served quickly and finally coming down to the service it was really prompt. To conclude we are planning our next visit ................. What about you !!!!

We were running late so decided to stop by Virgose for a quick bite and to quench the thirst. The place was deserted when we arrived. Service was very inattentive. Everytime we wanted something we had to catch hold of a waiter who were busy chatting amongst themselves.

Their Menu has a wide selection but not all items are available. With our beverages we ordered a few snacks.

The Double Fried Mushrooms, Murgh Malai Tikka and Golden Fried Prawns were all exquisite. So no complaints about the food. It's a nice place, would love to go when there's a bit of a crowd again and the service is better.

I have rated this place 4/5 only for the quality of food & beverages. Service would rate around 2/5.

There are two disc available in HHI. Virgose and Underground. I visited them both in a day. Space area, service quality (bartender) of Virgose is much better than Underground. 3 private cabins are also available so that you can spend some special time with your special ones.

One of the worst experience!!

Got the cockroach in the food. They didn't even seem to accept the horrendous mistake. I am sure their kitchen would be filthy. Food was distasteful. I will suggest you to avoid this place.

Only plus that I will give is the ambience.

This is definitely one of my favourite places to party. I have been there once or twice with big gangs. The ambiance is just appropriate for partying - nice music, small but smart dance floor, sober lighting, good food and good drinks. A complete package for a friday evening to wash out all the week's brainstorming on profit, loss, success, failure, grief and joy. Food is of good quality and taste. Starters are better than the main course. Cocktails and mocktails are well prepared. As a whole, great place. Starts with cheers, ends with cheers!

This place is super awesome. Everything about this place is to my liking. One of the best lounges I've ever been to. They serve good beer, good food. The starters were tasty and cooked in a near perfect way. I loved the place. Will surely go again and try some other dishes.
Reservation Recommended, we were in trouble because of this, but the manger was kind and arranged a sofa for the 4 of us.

HHI is a luxurious hotel close to my office, located near Minto Park on AJC Bose Road and at every turn, you discover a new face of this multi-faceted hotel. Virgose is the exclusive lounge-bar within HHI. It combines gracious service, global gourmet delights and premium drinks. Virgose is a pleasant venue to relax and unwind with international music and live performances. Today we went there in evening to enjoy a liquid and snack diet. Ambience was pretty enjoyable with blue & purple lights and very comfortable sitting arrangement. We finally decided to have some brewed drinks and snacks. Our ‘Beers’ arrived with ‘Cheeselings’, ‘Cruidete’s with Chef’s Special Dip’, ‘Nachos with Spicy Salsa’, ‘Peanuts’ and ‘Cheese Straws’ as table condiments. For starters we opted for ‘Paneer Tikka’, ‘Chilly Baby Corn’, ‘Chilly Fish’ and ‘Chilly Chicken Hakka’. Light music and chilled beer side by side mouthwatering hot starters made a perfect ambience for boozing. Food was nice and our attendant was very caring, time to time he checked and made our food stay warm. Nachos with Spicy Salsa & Cheese Straws with Creamy Dip went well with our drinks. Chilly Baby Corn tastes average; Chilly Fish had nice flavour’s and spice but nothing extraordinary, in fact just above average. Chilly Chicken Hakka was nice and enjoyable, chicken pieces used were fresh and soft definitely tantalize taste buds of famished diners. Our evening ends with lots of fun, I definitely recommend this place.

A place to unwind and force you on a journey away from reality should essentially, in my opinion, have two things-comfortable seating and soft soothing lighting. Virgose has one of the essentials and lack the other. The lighting is mellow and enough to induce a calming down effect on the heart and the mind-in fact it even induces a sort of romanticism to be propelled to the forefront of one's thoughts! However, the seating is woefully u comfortable and doesn't allow one to reach out for one's glass and rest one's aching back,  simultaneously. The cabana style seating has plush sofas but makes it difficult for one to stretch one's legs. Besides, if there's a group of people who intend to indulge in some slightly more than serious banter, then the seating in these cabanas coupled with an over enthusiastic DJ would make such a task very challenging!  

The place failed to offer me my choice of rum, a fact that took me by surprise considering it's quite popular brand of poison for those inclined.  The food, veg platter of kebabs that we ordered,  was quite succulent and tasty. The fish however did not taste as fresh. 

The enthusiasm and eagerness of the staff notwithstanding, I wouldn't consider this as my preferred place for an evening.

Located in the heart of the city. HHI virgose is a nice lounge. Recently went for a IPL match this weekend. Went with the group on Offer .

The service was immaculate. We were assigned a dedicated waiter at our table only. He served us everything at our will and the express service impressed me a lot. I felt really happy with the premium service we were offered. ( which we never expect when redeeming and offer ). 
Started of with the drinks and few starters. Paneer was very hard. And another started of some potato was also bad. Just made up the evening with nachos and drinks. Food quality was really bad. They need to improve with the food to impress , rather than the service.

the place is just about ok... we went for a private party and though the DJ was belting out a good no. of tracks it is the bar that let me down... i wanted a bottle of sparkling water which they were out off... and then a friend wanted orangina which they were out of too... being a big hotel and a huge name they should make sure that these grounds are covered.... i asked the manager if he could get the same from another bar in the hotel to no avail.... the bartender was nice and did tricks and made our drinks up to the mark.... all in all the place is good but there are places for improvement here and there...
