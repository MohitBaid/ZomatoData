Tried Chicken pulao, Chicken biryani & non veg mini combo today.Chicken pulao and biryani both were superb. There is a reason they are listed in the bestselling dishes of this restaurant. In non veg mini combo you get a lot of items at a very cheap price - dal, butter naan, sabji, butter chicken... and all of them are very tasty. So this plate or any other combo (thali) are very much budget friendly and two-three people can easily dine in with just one combo dish. And dont order plain naan from here instead order butter naan because butter naan here is as good as pathetic plain naan is. Thank you...

Chicken biryani here is particularly awesome. The taste will lingers for many days. Ordered food online and it came just in time, you can even call them and adjust your timing to suit your needs. Chicken kabab was also very good but naan was a letdown could be better (too hard). Overall very good experience.

Ordered lunch today from this place. Food ordered was mini veg combo and chola bhatura.. chola was too much salty and onion served with it chabged to black.. Bhatura was however okay. 

Regarding veg combo, naan was like iron papad which cannot be chew at all. Mix veg sabji served with was smelling and we found that it has already been spoiled. Rice, i dont know how it was made.. it was green in color and seems uncooked. We were really disappointed.. Bad luck.. money wasted.

The stuffing for aloo paratha was distinctly South Indian. The kebabs were burnt and a little dry. The dal fry was good and so was the gajar ka halwa. Delivery took a little longer than expected.

Not up to the mark at all. We have ordered Chicken kabab, Jeera rice and butter chicken. Chicken kabab was not tendered at all. actually the kabab is very much disgusting by its taste. jeera rice was not ok. butter chicken is just ok. that's all. The stalf is nice.
