Perfect place for a date or a group hangouts. Service was average for us. Number of the waiters are low and it so happened that a lot of times we called them, they just passed us by telling me to wait. That was little annoying.
Other than that it's a very cute place and just because my love for cupcakes are huge so I would love to visit again.

The cafe was almost full. However there was only one person in the kitchen who was serving  both as a cook and attendant. 15 minutes after ordering food when I realised that it will not be served any soon, I decided to leave after cancelling the order. The joint is not equipped to handle crowd and one should be ready for inordinate delays in service.

A quaint cafe near Golpark.  It's a pretty spot for a chat over coffee or that long awaited date with your bae. The chocolate milkshake and cafe latte are my usual orders. But I've tried it all,  from cold sandwiches to their Christmas turkey platter.

This was a very popular cafe in southern Avenue.  Interior of this place was too cute &  girly.  Cupcakes are the main attraction of this place.  Taste was too good & wonderfully decorated at topping. We ordered cupcakes,  sandwich &  hot chocolate.  Probably they provide the best hot chocolate in the city.  The one &  only disadvantage is that the quantity is not sufficient  but it's a treat to the eyes.

A nice cozy home like place. A perfect place to spend time and have super delicious desserts on a winter evening! This place had been on my list for many days and finally have been there. We had ordered a cranberry and white chocolate scones that was absolutely to die for. It was melt-in-mouth dessert which was a bliss! Also ordered a lemongrass infusion which was soothing and had a pleasant taste of lemongrass. The place is beautifully decorated and the staff very friendly and helpful. I would definitely visit it again! Happy Eating!

Years back, when the first time I had visited here, it was because of the intriguing cute kettle decor to be honest. Even now it's still that cute cozy place who's pretty decor changes from time-to-time. It's a Cafe that any sweet tooth would die for !
Starting from those tiny cupcakes to Caramel Custards and hot chocolate.. the marshmellows to lemon cheese and the ever beautiful and cute garnishing over the cakes would not let you resist but lure you to dig in and let them melt in your pallet !!
You would also like the pasta dishes and coffees, am sure.
Go on and let your sweet-tooth-self melt in joy, all season round !

I went there, with lots of expectations. But, unfortunately I wasn't satisfied at all. We took two different types of sundaes - Brownie Choco and Coffee Caramel. They, were so bitter to taste, that I was almost about to vomit. The ingredients weren't on point. And it was basically tasteless.

Anyway, the ambience is really cute and adorable. This is the only thing, were my heart melted, but their sundaes, couldn't melt my mouth. :)

Really, disappointed.

This must be the millionth time I'm coming here. Cupcakes are more or less as good as usual. I've always very highly recommended this place, and since I no longer live in the city, it holds a special place in my heart. But this is a classic example of a place riding on its reputation and having gone to shit. Had to ask them literally 5 times to clean the damn table. The service is condescending, rude and incompetent. They refused to fix my drink (after having taken 20 odd minutes to make it) and just stared blankly and repeated what I said back to me. Had to send back an Americano - after having asked for no sugar it tasted basically like syrup. The administration really needs to step in and take care of this.

It's going to give you a warm feeling inside that will make you nostalgic. Try the ginger bread cookies and the brownies. The scones are scrumptious.

This cafe has been creating a buzz for quite a lot of time. I joined the bandwagon a little late. The first thing that I loved about this place was the decor. The hand painted walls with the bird motifs spoke of subtlety and spot on aesthetics. Coming to the food, we decided to give the cupcakes, the most in vogue items of this outlet a miss and instead tried out a few other items. The ham and cheese sandwich showed what minimalism in food is all about. Then the spinach omelette was okay, so was the sausage roll. We washed our evening snacks down with a cup of hot chocolate. And it was bliss! I'm gonna return to this place just for this tiny cup of hot chocolate that reminds me of all things good and happy.

Perfect Ambience for a date...or a group hangout.Small chairs,has a washroom.
Service was average for us two,the others at adjacent tables from us however, kept complaining.Number of waiters are low and it so happened that a lot of times we called, they passed us by,telling us to wait while waiting on others,first.That was a little annoying.

Chicken cheese balls were served quite scalding inside,burnt my tongue.Crispy outside and each one too big to fit into mouth.It should have been smaller and more in number.
4/5

The creamy chicken puff tart was tasty inside,crispy outside.Bite-sized delight.Tiny portion, expensive for its size, wasn't creamy.Was not dry,however.
3.5/5

The coffee was decent, brown sugar packs were served alongside and I had to dumb both of it in.If you like your coffee to be really sweet,then that's going to be a problem.I don't know if they provide more sugar pouches if asked for. 
4/5

The hot chocolate was perfect.Just yum,not too liquidy, not too sweet, just perfect.5/5

Chicken derby tasted okay, but was problematic for its Uber crispy crust and non-supple inside ,to dig into.Decent snack for two person of small appetite.
Overpriced for its portion and taste. 3/5

The caramel custard was amazing.We shared it and it tasted of coffee and caramel...the portion was enough for one.Points deducted only for the portion,the taste,texture presentation was flawless. 4.5/5

We ordered the Mini cupcakes to see what the hype was all about.They're not mini, they're super tiny, IM talking toy-sized.Absolutely cute-looking, but if you're a foodie like we were,it's going to disappoint you as they come up.
And the frosting tasted nice,the marshmallow one being better than the cream cheese one.Creamcheese one was too sweet.
Priced at rs.50 each and overhearing that the flavours we picked weren't even the best ones they offer, we were further disappointed.When you're pricing a toy-sized cupcake at rs.50, you serve it perfect or exceptional and it was neither.
2.5/5


Will only revisit if they increase their portions and upgrade their claim-to-fame cupcakes.

Mrs. Magpie the place you want to be during the festive season for the beautiful cupcakes and hot chocolates. The outlet was in line with the festive feels and we ordered:
1) Hot chocolate: The perfect hot chocolate. I can literally have that any time of the day. It is perfect to every bit! It is what I would call as bae.
2) Custard: it was perfectly balanced and the portion size was perfect! It was amazing to end the day with it

The USP of the cafe is its Scones & Cupcakes.Here is an brief of what we tried : -

1)Cranberry White Chocolate Scones(Christmas Special) - Great.Must Try(4/5)
2)Hot Chocolate - Very Good(4/5)
3)Marshmallow Cupcake - Nice(3/5)
4)Salt & Sweet Cupcake - Nice(3/5)
5)Chill Cheese Puff - Okay(2/5)
6)Vegetarian Platter in Sliders - Good(3/5)
7)Spaghetti Arabiata Pasta - I liked it.Ask for extra flakes(4/5)
8)Corissant Sandwich(Christmas Special) - Good Sandwich(3/5)
9)Vanilla Caramel Custard - Okayish(2/5)

The items in the Vegetarian section are bit less.Need to add more.The cup in which they are giving the hot chocolate need to be changed.I Find it old fashioned.Some spicy items can also be added apart from the sea of sweetness :p

Merry Christmas!
Went to this pretty place on the Christmas day....this quite famous place is located near a narrow street.

Ambience (4/5): looks like a Lady's pretty room, adorable furnishings, cute pleasant ambience.

Food :: really good.
1. Mini frosted --
i. After 8ish (4/5) - really delicious.
ii. Marshmallow (4.5/5) : my favorite mini frosted here... really good to eat, and very balanced taste.
2. Hot chocolate (3/5) : it's rather like a molten dark chocolate, okayish , not bad.
3. Spaghetti with meat balls (4.5/5) : it's quite delicious. The flavour of this & the mixture of spices is real awesome. And the meatballs are very tasty & of good consistency. I really liked it.
4. Grilled fish with sliced potatoes (4/5) : extraordinary taste .... really awesome. But it was a bit more salted, otherwise it would have been 5 out of 5.
The grilled battered fish was filling all my taste buds, giving satiety...and the vegetables underneath were very good also. Potato was blend of tender & brisk... really good.

Service (3/5): service was pretty slow... I guess they are not accustomed to handle so much crowd of Christmas day.

Cost : well, quite reasonable.
A good spot to visit for light lunch, breakfast and to fill the tummy of dessert...

The cutest decor I have ever seen, hand down. Can keep going back for the decor alone.
Been to this restaurant two times,
1. Sweet and salty cupcake- tried quite many variations of cupcakes. But my favourite remains the sweet and salty cupcake. Belgian chocolate on the frosting, if you are a chocolate lover like me, then this cupcake is a must try!
2. Earl grey tea- has got to be one of the best tea I have ever tasted. It's taste was so refreshing, I loved it.
3. Hot chocolate- I had heard so much about it from my friends that I had to try it. Was a bit disappointed though. The hot chocolate was too thick for my taste. Can't say that I enjoyed it.
4. Coffee caramel custard- yummy, and very rich. That is essentially a good thing, but a bit too rich for my taste. I'm not much of a dessert person I guess.
I went for dessert both times, and planning in visiting again, this time to try the savory items.
Can't help but mention the decor and the ambiance of the place again. A big thumbs up.

The cafe is very simply decorated and by no means over done.
The hot chocolate here is very good. I have been here a few times and most recently my friends and I ordered walnut brownie, a chocolate chip tea cake, and two of their cupcakes. The cakes and coffee were good.
I personally find the cafe over priced even though the cupcakes are good. The portions are very small and not worth the price.

The Cranberry white Chocolate scones were warm and soft. The only thing that didn't go down well with us was the traditional Mac N Cheese. There was hardly any cheese in there and it smelled funny. Otherwise rest was delicious.

Tucked in a lane of southern avenue , this cute little cafe literally stole my heart. Interiors, ambience, environment everything is too cute and girly. With those pink walls cute small chairs just like we use to read in fairytales this place is awesome.
Now coming to the main attraction of this place ,the "cupcakes", rather the miniature cupcakes are too pricy I feel. I mean when I spent 50 bucks on that tiny cake,( it's oviously very tasty and very nicely made) , I was awestruck when it arrived.
Next comes the hot chocolate and I must say OH MY GOD. The best hot chocolate in the city. I have never had such an amazing thick hot chocolate elsewhere. I could literally lick and wipe the cup clean üòù
We also took chicken capsicum sandwich which was nicely made.
Then we took cafe latte which I found the worst of all. It was also served with a hot chocolate chip tea cake which was quite tasty.
I will definitely visit this place again for the sake of hot chocolate üòç

Tucked away in southern avenue residential area, this cute drool-worthy place serves probably the best cupcakes and hot chocolate in town.

Ambiance wise, it's all about small compact tables, pink quirky decors, comfortable seating arrangement with the best cupcakes one can find while in kolkata.

The service was prompt. We ordered cupcakes, brownies with ice-cream and hot chocolates and all of them were worth the money spent. Small cupcakes may seem a bit small for its pricing but they were worth it, each of them were made using different menu-mentioned ingredients unlike most of the cupcake joints who'd just change the frosting for the menus' sake. The marshmallow one was the best of the lot.
The hot-chocolate, well, the best I ever had, served hot and thick. Again portioned small for the pennies spent but worth every single one.
The brownie with ice-cream was good too but we should've bunked it for another variant of cup-cake I think ?

This place attracts youths and college goers from the local area in prime hours but for a quaint afternoon over insta-worthy cupcakes and books, this is your place.

Also, the pancakes and crepes are wonderfully made. Though the size of the pancakes are smaller than other places. But they do taste good.

Magpie is one of the cafes which suits all the age groups. The first thing that catches your attention in the cafe, is their interiors. Overall it looks super pretty and appealing to its visitors. Coming to the food , they have a compact menu which is the good part. I tried their cupcakes, the combo of coffee and tea cake and the walnut brownie. The combo offer is great and I will recommend people to try it to. The only complain I have is that their small cupcakes are super tiny.

We had the Chicken Pesto Spaghetti(instead of penne pasta) and Chilli cheese puff. The pasta was good and the pesto was creamy as well. But the chicken pieces were mostly at the bottom of the pot, so I first felt that there weren't enough pieces and later had too many of them at the end. The puff wasn't that good and just passed the mark.

A very cute little soft colourful cafe in southern avenue. Its a place where you can go with your family, friends and partnerss too.üòä
A place where you can sit and talk for hours surrounded by a composed environment..
This place has a sitting arrangement for 20-25 people.. and serves you with amazing light and healthy snacks and beverages to munch..
One most important thing which is very attractive here is the wide variety of cute little cupcakes they serve which you can eat and very approapriate foe gifting..You can also buy birthday cakes from here the same is available here..üòãüéÇ
I ordered for the following:
1) Grilled chicken pizza.
2) Chicken sliders( 3 mini burger+French Fries+starwberry cooler)
3) 4 cup cakes small.
4) 1 cappucino
5) 1 oreo milk shake.
And it costed me Rs. 1061/-( including tax) and served three people approapriately.
Quantity and Quality is good as per the price..üëç

Today I have gone there. the decor and interior of the cafe is so so.¬†
The staffs are very efficient and friendly.
Coming to food, that was really something worth going there. it was really mouth watering along with a very impressive decoration.¬†
I had sweet and salty cupcake, club sandwich, vanilla caramel custard and pancakes. It costs me 600/- as per my suggestion, one should really go there to indulge the cravings of delicious cakes and deserts.

This place is very close to my heart as it was frequently visited by me and my friends who left the town. I have tried all their cupcakes and the one that stood out is Marshmallow. The Darjeeling tea which they serve tastes very good. And I always order for the choco chip tea cake which is my favourite. (Ask them to heat the tea cake) I love the seating here and you can try the savouries too. I have had one or two and they were pretty good. The black currant scone and the coffee is also very  good. I will make future visits and would want to have breakfast which is expensive.

Everyone already knows what a great place Magpie is except for those who complain about the size of their cupcakes (they‚Äôre small but heavy and worth it, people). But this review is especially to all about their in-house sorbet. So after lunch we walked into Magpie for desserts and while my friends got simple warm croissants which came within 10 minutes with butter, honey and a wonderful jam, I as usual got the more complicated thing - a plum sorbet. I was sceptical because you don‚Äôt really get sorbets here but in 20 long minutes they produced for me the perfect fresh authentic sorbet they could have possible come up with. The pulp of the fresh plums food will be felt and yet the ice was just how a sorbet should be, not how a popsicle is or how a gola is either. The colour was natural and beautiful and they have it in a couple of other flavours that I cannot wait to try.

Dropped in for a quick evening tea.
The cuteness of this place surpasses words altogether üòã . A bell at the door,quaint chairs, beautiful wall art,and food that's so pretty that you'd hate to eat itüòÇ
The staff are very cordial,and service is fast. 
We ordered their cupcakes- nutty praline, berry blast, marshmallow chocolate, strawberry cream cheese: all delicious! Their Assam and Darjeeling tea pots are served with  gingerbread cookies. 
Loved this place!

In one word - Awesome!

After few failed plans, we finally arrived at Mrs. Magpie and she welcomes you with the sound of  "jingle bells" at the doorstep. the ambiance is very cozy and the interior is very fancy and alluring. We ordered Nutty Praline, Sweet 'N' Salty, Cream Chicken Tart, Javaccino, Marshmallow and Peanut butter cupcakes. All were so tasty, and I will always suggest to visit the place at least once and have a delicious breakfast there. Surely, will be back soon!

I simply adore this place!!! We went there for a breakfast party with family on a Sunday morning. We ordered garden omlet, spinach omlet, salty cupcake, butter cream cupcake, cappuccinos, breakfast combo. The quality of the breakfast menu is amazing and we loved it. Will be back again. I'm also a regular here in terms of swiggy. I order from here whenever I'm in a mood for cupcakes.

A lot of imagination has gone into the decor of this caf√©, starting from the tinkling bell at the door to the bird decals on the wall, making this the  perfect cosy nook to tuck into for some dessert, coffee and conversation. 
We ordered caramel coffee, Americano and grilled chicken and mushroom sandwich. The drinks were perfectly made and the sandwich tasted good enough for it's price. But the show-stealers of the evening were definitely the cupcakes. We chose mini marshmallow, and mini Irish coffee. The last one is a bite-sized slice of heaven.

A small cozy place with a cute and sweet interior decor.The place smells of cakes, coffee and all sweet things with pink and orange walls beautifully designed with photo frames, birds and butterflies. The tables and chairs are short and sweet enhancing the effect. The place has a collection of excellent frosted cakes that are treat for the eyes.¬† ¬†The cupcakes here are the best thing possible both large frosted and mini frosted. We had visited during the pujas when they had a puja special menu. We ordered Choco cookie shake, Cinnamon apple cake, Cherry and Cream cheese as well as the puja special delicacy. Choco Malai was a unique blend of rosogollas in chocolate sauce which tasted like heaven. Surely coming back for more.

This place has been on my wish list since a long time,  located in the bylanes a bit difficult to find if you are not known to that area like me. It's a small, cosy cute cafe with everything so pretty and delicate. The decor, the ambeince everything is on point so is the taste of the food. I guess I had the best hot chocolate there and the cupcakes are too pretty to eat. The only issue I had was the proportion of the food. It's wasn't exactly what you pay for. Otherwise it's amazing and I will be going again and again for that hot chocolate. ;)

This is a cute place to meet for coffee. The place offers pizzas and delicious cupcakes. We went there on 25th October and the experience was so-so. 

We ordered a couple of cupcakes, among which were marshmallow, peanut butter, and sweet and salty. The cupcakes were spot on, except the marshmallow, which I didn't like because it has a crusty sugary coating which is too sweet at first bite. 

We also ordered cafe mochas, which was surprisingly lacking the chocolatey taste that Mocha comes with. Upon asking if this was indeed not a mixup and they didn't serve us Lattes, we were assured that it was a Mocha. Again, not quite the Mocha taste. 

We also ordered a Meat Lovers thin crust pizza. The pizza flavour was good, however it was dry. 

Would I like to go again? Maybe. Their cupcakes are quite nice.

Have been to this place last Sunday and what I discovered is that it looks like a doll house..pink walls and rainbow doors with a bell.. wooden tables with cute chairs.. trust me kids sure like this place... it's the warmth of the place that makes it so special may be...now coming to the food..we ordered chilly cheese puffs and chicken sausage rolls.. which were pretty average in taste as compared to the price.. I think they should also improve on the quantity of the things served...coz you are paying a lot for a thing that just vanishes in the month...but yes it's definitely a treat to the eyes..

I have been coming here with cousins and friends for breakfast/evening snacks since it's inception. The decor is super cute with pink stuffs all around. Love how they have kept minimalistic furnitures, bright monotoned wallpapers with cute stickers! Although this review is late in coming, still I would like to zero in on some of my favourites. The hot chocolates, the coffees and the teeny meeny cute little cupcakes are dreamlike. Overall this place gives you all the good vibes that one can for!

Keep visiting!

I thought it was unjust not to visit the famous Mrs Magpie, when I stay so close to the place. Average, is what I would rate Mrs Magpie to be. The ambiance is slightly messy, the decoration looks immature and the service is just average.¬†

The menu looked full of surprises. The variety looked awesome.¬† I was eager to order but confused at the same time.¬† Somehow the items looked very similar. I ordered whatever food would do justice to the place and my review. I ordered a Farmers omelette, A lemon cheese cupcake, a Chicken sausage roll and a Chicken pie. The Omelette did not have enough cheese, though the menu claimed. It had onions and other items just like a usual home cooked omelette. Its wasn't impressive to me. It was accompanied by under cooked grilled tomato and disappointing¬† white bread. Slight changes like a choice of bread, and a properly cooked tomato could have raised their rating. The cupcake was delicious yet small in size. The Chicken sausage roll felt oily and the Chicken pie could have been better. The crust of the pie had raised my expectation, but the filling was too flat and turned me down.

Lastly, they played nice songs!

Named after the black billed magpie, this eatery is perched in Lake Terrace near Vivekananda Park. The moment you step in, it seems to be straight out of a fairy tale. Famous for its cupcakes, its a paradise for the ones with sweet tooth and if you are not a sweet lover, you are sure to change your mind after one bite of their mini cupcakes. I have had breakfast, lunch and evening tea with chicken nibbles like sausages and nuggets. Amongst others, fish and chips is one of my personal favourites.

I've visited the place quite a few times, it's good. The ambience of the place is quite different and striking. The food offered here is excellent, it's not that expensive either. Some of the staff are attentive, some are not, sometimes you have to call out for them to act, even for providing water once you get in. I'd like to point out that once we found a strand of hair in our pasta, which is quite careless and unprofessional , though they did not charge for it which was expected from them.

1. Spaghetti Arrabiata - This was delicious, it was well cooked and was plenty in quantity. Nothing to complain here.
2. Spaghetti Carbonara - This wasn't bad, but it wasn't that great either, it tasted a bit off but quantity wasn't any issue here either. This was the dish we found hair in. I'd like to ask the management to make sure this is not a recurring incident.
3. Grilled Chicken Pizza - The bread was thin but not flimsy , it was baked well, and tasted absolutely stunning, the sizes of each slice was that of a medium sized pizza.
4. Chocolate Shake - This tasted great ! Though it felt as in the quantity was a bit less compared to what you'd get elsewhere.
5. Choco-cookie Shake - I'd say this tasted better than the regular Chocolate Shake. It was crunchy, an add-on I always like. But quanity was a bit less here too.
6. Chocolate Affogato - Small yet delicious , this delight is something I'd always choose to visit this place for.

In short, this is a nice place with good food at good prices but it has it's flaws at others areas such as staff competence. But definitely, this place is worth a try for the former.

Right now I'm sitting here while writing this review.

Cold coffee: a bit thin but tasted very nice!!
Mushroom quiche: disappointing!! It was very much dry.
White sauce spaghetti: nicely balanced.
French fries: quality is good but not the quantity.
Pancakes: it was completely dry and crumbly .

But the rating is just because of the service standard.
We two were sitting here for almost 45min but no one served water. When I asked for water , the server gave 1 glass of water for 2 people üòÇ
Not only this, they served the spaghetti but no plates were given! They must have thought that we would have it direct from the bowl.!!!!!!
First and last visit for sure!!

The chicken sliders aka tiny burgers are perfect. Of course, their signature miniscule cupcakes are a draw too. The original staff were excellent, but the current service could be better.

Located inside the lanes of southern Avenue,it is a bit hard to locate given the fact that their hoarding is negligible. I visited this cafe on a Saturday evening.The place was fairly crowded.
Ambience: I love the ambiance,its so quirky and fun with hand painted wall decors.

Food: we ordered cappuccino and mini frosted cupcakes in 4 variants.i Cannot stress enough over how adorable the cupcakes were and equally delicious.
It was treat to both eyes and stomach.

Service: service is average

One must visit this cafe to try out their cupcakes

This little cafe opened its doors few years back. Had heard abt it and went to visit it back then around Christmas time. I was floored, it was like entering a chapter of Alice in Wonderland. It was truly one of its kind. Bright cheery beautiful decor, matching furniture and even cutlery. It had been designed in painstaking detail. Even the washroom is carefully designed. 
Everything here is bite sized, the food is good. But what I love the most is the hot chocolate, which is best ordered in the mini size since its really thick and rich. The cupcakes are to die for it looks beautiful, cute and all things synonymous and taste heavenly, really moist with a creamy centre filling. These are some of the best cup cakes I have had. They didn't have much choices on the menu until very recently when they added pizzas and pastas. 
I would recommend this place, if you want a quiet evening with lots of conversation, however its a bit on the pricier side.

Located near keyatala, this nice little cafe offers you a cozy, comfy and a soothing ambience, where you can spend a nice evening with few friends or your loved ones.
Ambience wise: 4/5

Known for their different varieties of cupcakes, they won't disappoint you. But the mini cupcakes are priced at 45/- which i felt is a bit overpriced.

Other than that have tried:-
1. Orange punch: 3/5. nothing much to complain, and also nothing much to brag about too.

2. Cafe latte: 2.5/5

3. Hot chocolate: 4/5. This one here has really won my heart. Try it, you won't be disappointed. Regretted for not having ordered the large one.

Over and all. Nice place. Would like to visit again shortly.

For a long time, I have longed to visit this place, at last I went today and I am mesmerized. Yumm... It's the only word that I can think now to describe Mrs. Magpie. Whatever I heard from my friends, is true. A bite of that lovely cupcake made of Belgium chocolate was heavenly. We ordered one cinnamon roll, one spaghetti meatball, one chicken capsicum sandwich, one javaccino chocolate temptation and one iced cafe mocha. It's so easy on pocket.
The decor reminded me of the miniature dollhouse that I had played with when I was a kid. And the staff are so well behaved.
I recommend the place to all my friends and waiting to visit Mrs. Magpie sometime soon again!

A total disaster of a place...How does it have such high ratings is completely extraordinary...Anyways lets talk about it cons first ...pros r very less....

This place is famous for its cupcakes...to be honest i had small pieces of cakes which r much more tasty than this..i don't mind the price (2 much for its  standards)or quantity(lets not talk about that)...but i really expected something very tasty...but found a ok ok cupcake..we tried the nutty one and a marsh mallow
Ordered 2 mini hot chocolate...i don't know what they were thinking...they were going to serve it with the bbq pizza we had ordered...who has hot choclate with pizza???? The hot choclate was just ok ok.. according to its price ...not something great
Now comes the pizza...y do u serve pizza when u don't know to make one... Simply pathetic...felt like throwing up.. no taste nothing simply horrible
Theres only one pro...the decor is nice .nd the service is good..the foood is just pathetic...this will be the 1st nd last visit to this place..felt really cheated

It is a very pretty, sweet, warm and cozy place. I just loved the ambience. Not much spacious though. We ordered a Chicken Platter(slider), Chocolate Milk Shake and Chocoberry cupcake. The platter contains 3 mini burgers and potato chips, by saying mini burgers they literally mean it, don't expect it to be a good diet for 3 people. It is very good in taste and contains fresh tomatoes as well. The Chocolate Milk Shake is delicious and is a must try. The Chocoberry cupcake is also very yummy and I guess all their cupcakes are yummy. One should try anyone of them according to their favourite flavour. Everything was excellent but I deducted a point because we had to ask for water for 4 times and finally got it when asked for the 5th time. Still I am looking forward to visit again because I loved their food and would like to try their other items especially Pasta.

This place is so pretty . The decor and wall art add to the beauty of the place . Mrs magpie has been in my wish list since long and I visited this place twice ; once with my friends and once alone . The cupcakes are just amazing . My personal favourite is sweet & salty and Irish coffee cupcakes . Rest variants are equally good . The pocket pinch is also okayish in comparison to the quantity served . The staffs are well mannered and quick in their service . Overall , a nice experience .

This place is one of my favourite place to hangout. I have been there many times. Their cupcakes made me fall in love. Recently I have tried brownie with ice cream and the hot soft brownie just melts in the mouth with ice cream. Apart from that their sandwiches savouries are served fresh and hot.

I've been here before and had a wonderful time hence brought a friend from out of town,  but had the crappiest experience today when I came for a pot of tea!

Came with our kids n ordered only 3 things of which one was a pot of tea and the other was ice cream, none of which needs any cooking or prep! It still took your extremely rude and arrogant staff more than 25 mins to serve us while they promptly served tables which came after us , we finally lost our patience and walked out!

It's just sad that you have such an incompetent team handling busy hours !

A customer who has no plans to come back to you! :(

Had a long wish to visit this place, finally happened day before yesterday.Went with my cousin and we tried their non veg assorted platter from the sicilian food festival menu.Barring the mushroom arancini which i personally found a bit bland, all other items were tasty, clubbed with simplicity.We also ordered spaghetti arabbiata which was too good to slurp.

After a long Hectic Day we went to this cafe. I heard a lot about ths cafe and was really eager to visit here. The interior decoration was simple but cute. We ordered cappuccino and chocolate loaf. They cakes tasted good. The complaint regarding this place is....it is too much overpriced. I mean how can you set Rs70 price for a mini cupcake? And talking about the service, it was horrible. We had 3 waiters coming and taking the same order from us. Moreover we didn't get response from them when we called them up for several times. I don't think I'll visit here again. It's an over hyped place.

Mrs Magpie an over Hyped Outlet. Service is pathetic with one person taking the Order and serving it too. We had Ordered Vegetarian Club, Potato Wedges, Green Tea, Cappuccino and Croissant, Not to forget 4 different Mini Cupcakes.

Coming to the Vegetarian Club. It was on of the most horrible Sandwich I have ever had and didn't look or seem like a club sandwich. Firstly there isn't a choice of bread. Was told by the waiting Staff they don't do white Bread. It was utter waste and rate it 1.5

Potato Wedges served in a small glass and that too I guess 7 - 8 pieces. What a rip off. Even my son who is 6 yrs realized the Quantity was so less, went on to say the waiting Staff that " Uncle you have served so much of fries that it will take me ages" Again this was not up to the mark and perfection. 1.5

Green tea served was to strong. But never the less was piping hot till the end. 3.5

Cappuccino was just fine.3.5

Yes cup cakes were good I guess the only stuff we enjoyed. 4.5.

Not a place to visit for me again.

Caught up with an old friend at this warmly lit, cozy place. The visit was much awaited and was welcomed with an equally enticing experience. The decor totally makes the deal for you. You can also find very cute gift items if you are finding something to soothe a foodie. Coming to the food, I could just have two items. Brownie sundae: totally scrumptious, though creamy and filling, the price is reasonable too. Hot chocolate: a little pricey for the quantity, but totally worth it. Thik and deeply flavoured with the best quality cocoa, it's a must try for gourmet chocolate lovers. Looking forward to try their breakfast menu

This place is one of the cutest place I have visited! Starting from those little yet delicious cakes and muffins, to the chocolate milkshake and orange punch drink and to the creamy chicken pasta and spaghetti, everything was high on taste value.
Quantity is a bit less but it's okay! The taste covers up for that quantity issue.
Other than that, it is all good and yummy good!
To the whole team and chef of this place, kudos to you guys! üòç

This quaint little shop on southern avenue serves to die for hot chocolate. The hot chocolate seems like chocolate has been simply melted and poured into a cup. It has the right consistency in short in ticks all the boxes. I also had the chicken quiche which was pretty good with the cheese oozing out.

With a little outdoor seating, it'd be your ideal right-out-of-Paris cafe üôà

Needless to mention, cupcakes steal the show - all the time! Mushy mushy and red velvet cream cheese being my personal favourites üôàüñ§

To start with Mrs. Magpie is ohh soooo cute ..with all those pink interiors & pretty little things all around! We ordered-
Mushroom and olive penne pesto
Nutty praline cupcake
Cafe latte
Javaccino chocolate temptation
The mushroom was tasty & creamy.
The coffee was GOOD (Coffee can never be bad no?) ‚ù§
The cupcakes were bit too small to satisfy all those cravings of people having sweet tooth like me & especially when they tasted so yummmm..
P.S- Visit this place with spare time in your hand because you don't get to enter without having to wait a bit for a table!
Happy eating üòä

Literally an abode for chocolate lovers like me.
A great place to hang out with your dates/loved ones.
A bit over priced and might not be a daily go to place.
We had ordered mushi mushi, hot chocolate, and chocolate platter.
Mushi mushi and hot chocolate was as good as i expected, but was a bit disappointed with the chocolate platter.
Polite staff.
Great wall decors and playlist.
A must visit.

It was a long time desire to visit this place. And finally got my chance. It's one of the best and well known place for desserts in Kolkata. The pink d√®cor is marvellous and is very catchy. Very courteous service people as well, they suggested as some desserts along with thier special cheesecakes, which went really well. The prices are relatively low if we take account the quality of food and service. Keep up this awesome work, Magpie peeps. Mrs. Magpie will remain the best.

Went there for cupcakes and also has spaghetti meatballs
The cupcake we had was nutty prelim(i may have spelt the wrong name) 
It was very very good
The spaghetti meatball,took long time to be served, but it was tasty
The service is a bit late, but the staff is nice
If you want to just relax,have some cupcakes and talk with your friends or someone special,this is the place

I had high expectations but this place has absolutely nothing to meet it's high reviews. Starting from the location,to the food quality everything is pathetic. Whatever we ordered was unavailable be it pizza or cup cakes or shakes. The chicken derby which we finally ordered as it was fortunately available was terrible, too crispy and very hard. Now coming to the location, very interior, as if for the locals neither is it close from gariahat nor from southern avenue. I am shocked to see people giving such incorrect and inaccurate high ratings for such a Cafe.

3.staff said they cannot do anything for the ppl who talked too loud and nearly made others deaf.
4.seating arrangement wear a cluster.

Yesterday it was raining heavily and it was that perfect weather to have some nice hot chocolate.I have heard a lot about Mrs Magpie and it was bookmarked for a long time in Zomato so while returning home alone I suddenly thought that "why not explore this beautiful place?",and I went there.The place is not that difficult to find and the ambience is to die for.The beautiful weather added to the charm‚ù§Ô∏è
Now coming to the food,I had a cup of hot chocolate and I can vouch on this that I have never eaten something so magical in my life‚ù§Ô∏è_‚ù§Ô∏èIt was so thick and creamy that I can't even :3üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è If someone offers me then I can have that hot chocolate everyday :3
Now coming to cupcakes,I ordered a nutty praline,lemony white chocolate and cream n cheese and the nutty praline is without a doubt the best.The cream n cheese is also good but I found it a bit too sweet and the lemony white one had a very subtle flavour so the flavour was a bit confusing one.
For savoury I ordered a chicken sausage roll and damn it was good‚ù§Ô∏è
I also took some cupcakes back homeüòÅ‚ù§Ô∏è
All over the place is beautiful and worth a visit and I love eating alone so the place is really good for people who love spending some time alone.

Went on a morning for breakfast. Ordered a couple of things, what stood out was their Farmer's omelette which literally had ham and cheese oozing out of them. Their croissant is served with homemade jam. The raisin scones are my favourite. And when they serve you, it almost feels like you're in a Parisian caf√© and everything is just fine.

A wish made long ago came true when I finally visited this place. This is not a place to have a festive gala eatout with your family or a place to enjoy booze with a gang of friends, but a small, cute, comfy cafe to enjoy a small meal and chat with your bestie over a small cupcake or pattie, and that is what I love! You can sit and do some work on your laptop here too, because the ambience is so calm and pacifying! It has small tables with seats for two to a few(five or six even, don't remember). The place is adorned with not-so-bright, not-so-dim lights and the colourful glass windows just add to the "cool Mediterranean morn" atmosphere.

Now about the food! They are famous for their cupcakes, but you can also try out their sandwiches, sauages, crepes, pizza or pasta (if you want lunch), omelettes, tea, coffee or hot chocolate-this cafe has a huge list.
What we tried-
1. Chicken Sausage Roll (only Rs. 35)
2. Ham and Cheese Quiche(Rs. 75)
3. 2 cupcakes of Rs.45 each(names not in memory, but tastes are)

This only cost us Rs.200 plus tax. We had a great breakfast at an affordable price, and gala time under the pretty lights. Only disadvantage is the long distance you have got to walk from the main road to reach here! Nevertheless, this is the best cafe I have ever been to!

Mrs Magpie is like a fairytale cafe. The ambience of this place exports you to some tea part of Alice in wonderland. Cute is the suitable signature adjective fr this place. Everything starting from the cups and the saucers to the chairs there is some kind of innocence. It is perfect of a date in the evening or you can gang out with your kids room. I love the food here especially the coffee.

On a rainy day we decided to go on a date to this cozy little place tucked in southern avenue near lake girls school. As we all know they are famous for there cupcakes, we decided to order nutty praline, cherry n cream cheese , peanut butter , marshmallow and lemon meringue. Along with these we ordered hot chocolate mini and iced cafe mocha. The cupcakes were excellent specially the peanut butter and lemon meringue.  The hot chocolate was perfectly done. Definitely recommended. :)

One of the best caf√© in kolkata, in terms of food quality, I must say.
Beautiful painted walls and soothing ambience. It's located in Gariahat... Just 4-5 mins walking distance from the main road.
Don't forget to taste their special dishes which includes bacon wrapped chicken sandwich and chicken tart.
Though along with the sandwich I went for other 3 distinct dishes- grilled chicken with cheddar, cheese scone and a cup of hot chocolate.
The taste of the hot chocolate is the one which I will never forget. It was heavenly. Specially when it's raining and cold outside, you ought to taste it man!
It costed us Rs 710. So make your calculations before you order :p

Well this is my second visit to this place and after trying out nearly everything they had to offer. I'm really disappointed. The decor was simply brilliant. Servers were courtesious. Cupcakes, Cappucino and Hot Chocolate was good. But the rest of the food was simply not upto the mark. Thin crust pizza is something which I really don't like. Grilled Chicken Pizza. Chicken Cheese Balls was smaller in size. The chicken derby was highly disappointing. This was my second visit and my last to this place. I'd come back for the cupcakes though. It's very disappointing.

A small joint located in Southern Avenue, Mrs.Magpie is one of those rare places where you'll end up feeling just really happy !! The decor reminded me of my childhood days,when everything bright and colourful attracted me,even the furniture.Delightful ambience,nice place for chilling with friends and calming your soul.Well-behaved staff.But,it's a tad bit small.

Now coming to the food.. We ordered the following - 

1)Chicken Penne Pasta - The presentation was fine & the taste was really good.Served along with a rust bread, the quantity did seem a bit less though but it was truly delicious.{7/10}

2)Chicken Platter(Slider) - Three mini burgers which were sensational for the taste buds served with chips ended up being a really nice choice.But yet again, it was slightly overpriced for the quantity.{8/10}

3)Grilled Chicken & Cheddar Sandwich - Was decent, filled with omlette & salami,served with chips,but the quantity was way too less.{6/10}

4)Hot Chocolate(large) - And this was by far, the best thing that I had there..Absolutely correct thickness,really chocolaty and the awesome feeling it gave when in the mouth.Muah !! But again,pretty less volume compared to the price but this is still worth it !! A MUST TRY !! {9/10}

5)Large Frost(Marsh Mellow) cupcakes - When in Mrs.Magpie, cupcakes really don't need to be reviewed. They are probably the best in Kolkata and this was no exception.Delicious and there was strawberry jelly sauce stuffed inside it which worked wonders !! SHOULD NOT MISS OUT ON CUPCAKES I would say.{10/10}

Overall,a nice place to hang out for a casual evening. :)

Was meeting a old friend...so we were 3 people here and ordered 2 Darjeeling tea one orange crush and a cheese sandwich and a roast chicken sandwich.. the sandwich were of medium size and so quantity was not great but the Darjeeling tea was awesome. I would have rated it 4+ but didn't coz of there service which is too slow and one person was serving there who had pathetic English accent which was very unlike the theme of the restaurant. There were cool people around but the waiter took time in delivering and when we wanted bill he spoke rudely to wait which startled me I have been to Bangalore and now back to Kolkata gave me a shocker. I have been to cloakroom earlier they were really nice group but mixed feeling here

Mrs Magpie! A well known cafe at Southern Ave, famous for their bakery mainly cupcakes but talking from my experience I have had better cup cakes. When it comes to their savouries menu they are really mediocre. Yes all the foods served are well decorated but nothing when compared to their taste. Only thing I liked is the brownies.¬†
Cafe is packed most of the time the decor is kinda OK too. But the tables and the chairs look like they were rented from different locations, all have different shape and design. People always looking to grab a few table over others because some of them aren't that comfortable to sit.
Talking about the time they serve quick and well behaved waiters.

We had been planning to visit Mrs Magpie for a long time but couldn't make it together for some reason or the other. Last day our college exams got over and we visited this pretty place.
I have always loved this place for it's cute decor. It looks like a page from the fairy tales with colorful walls and printed butterflies on them, tiny chairs and a lot more. You get to hear a *ting* of the bell attached to the door everytime someone opens it.
Their famous cupcakes look equally adorable. They have a huge variety of cupcakes. We ordered Peanut butter, Mushi Mushi, Chocolate gur and Cherry & cheese cup cakes from the mini frosted section. I loved the Cherry & cheese cup cake while my friends voted for the Peanut butter one. From the savouries we ordered the Chicken pot pie which I would recommend, the Shepherd's pie had a strong taste of cinnamon which was not that great but the Chicken Derby tasted good. We settled for Chocolate milk shake and Iced cafe mocha for beverages. The milk shake was sweet and nice to taste and the cafe mocha was fair. We lastly ordered a large frosted Nutty Praline which was our common favorite.
The bill comes in a colorful box which has a spotted lady beetle on top. üòÑ
The staff was attentive and polite.
Overall, it is a nice place to catch up for a little chat over those cupcakes. üòä

Great LOOKING cupcakes. Very nice ambience, suitable for small parties for people with a sweet tooth. The taste and consistency of the cakes could have been a bit better (I have had better). Helpful staff. Did not like their policy of packing of minimum 4 cupcakes though. I wanted only 2 but had to buy 4.

Located in southern avenue it is one of the cutest cafes in kolkata. If you have sudden desert cravings then this is the perfect place to calm your soul and heart. This place is small yet cozy. It is cutely decorated with small chairs and tables. Beautifully decorated in pastel colours, colourful chairs, walls decorated with butterflies, birds or floral patterns all adds upto a page straight out of any fairy tale. Coming to the food well it was ok but cupcakes are too good. As i said this is a perfect place for desserts.

Mrs. Magpie( Southern Avenue)is a small space with a lot of character. When you enter, the first thing you see facing you is a case full of cupcakes and good stuffs. Upon my visit, a case full of cute little cupcakes and pastries stared back at my hungry face.¬†
As I mentioned, the second I saw the cupcakes, I knew they would be mine. We ordered One Chocoberry, One Mini Marzipan(marshmallow), One After Eight along with a Mini Frosted(Mushi Mushi). When the cupcakes are made fresh and the flavors change frequently, they can run out of some of them pretty quickly. All of them were fantastic, but my unequivocal favorite right now is the Mini Frosted Mushi Mushi. A simple ginger like flavour for a simple person, I guess. What else can I say?
A sweet and smooth frosting as you taste the top part of the little good thing and a sweet flavor explosion as you bite into the soft, thicker base. These are among the best I‚Äôve ever had and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a sweet treat that isn‚Äôt heavy at all.

This place seems like a scene out of Alice in Wonderland or a Wes Anderson film. How cute and colourful can a place be? The answer is Mrs.Magpie. Not a doubt about that. Colourful chairs, walls decorated with butterflies, birds or floral patterns-- all adds upto a page straightout of Cinderella or any such fairytale. Located in a bylane close to the Azad Hind Dhaba on Purna Das Road, which by the way has turned into a food street of sorts with all the exciting names on the Kolkata food joints. For e.g. Cloakroom is in the opposite lane. Rather than going off again on how cute this place is, I'd now blabber on the again oh-so-very-cute cupcakes with even more cute designs. The little marzipan characters adorn the counter and you wouldn't want it to be eaten because they are too damn cute. We had a number of cupcakes, wanted to order all but again, how much does a college-goer's pocket carry? I particularly liked the Lemon White Chocolate and the Cherry n Cream Cheese. We ordered for Chicken Sausage Roll, Mushroom Roll and Ham and Cheese Quiche which were all nice. Only the Quiche felt a bit less tasty. My friend ordered for Raspberry Yoghurt Pot which was a bit disappointing coz we felt that the Chocolate layer doesn't go at all with neither Raspberry nor the Yoghurt. A must for those who likes cakes, sweets and all things cute! :P

Where do I even start?
I absolutely love this place.
The place looks like something out of an Enid Blyton book. I love the cute decor and cozy seating arrangements, with an equally cute bathroom too!
Coming to their food, my favorites are -
1. Frosted marshmallow cupcakes. The perfect blend of cute and sweet.
2. Hot chocolate. Tastes heavenly.
3. Green apple sorbet. Fresh and yum.
4. Caramel custard. Scrumptious.
Another plus is that their takeaway cupcakes come in the most adorable packaging!
The food is on the costlier side for college students like myself, but so worth it for people with a sweet tooth, again like myself.

Small place.. beautifully decorated in pastel colours.. typical for a afternoon or evening tea meets.. we went there late evening.. after dinner.. for some dessert.. the place was pretty crowded.. there was a beautiful comfortable couch where we sat down.. we ordered 3 cupcakes namely cherry and cream cheese, chocoberry and marshmallow.. cherry cream and cheese was really good.. it had a layer of jam inside the cake and the sour cream tasted really well with it.. choco berry had the usual chocolate taste.. and marshmallow was normal chocolate cake with a marshmallow on top.. it was on the costlier side .. not sure if am going to visit again..

Mrs. Magpie is synonymous to the-ultimate-sinful-cupcakes. The popularity that this brand carries is not much of a wonder given the taste and prettiness they serve on the plates. The outlet itself resembles a part of a snowy pretty little dream.

Located in Southern Avenue it has become a centre of attraction for dessert lovers in the area and around the city of Joy.

In our latest visit we had ordered hot chocolate, pesto penne, chicken cheese balls, chicken sliders, coffee caramel custard, orange punch, watermelon juice and some lovely cupcakes named marshmallow, after 8ish, sweetnsalty and choco berry. 

Hot chocolate was thick and creamy just how it's supposed to be, the pasta rightly flavoured with course pesto sauce, the sliders were mini burgers which looked too adorable. The chicken cheese balls were tender with goey cheese in the centre. The caramel custard here came with a flavour of coffee which intensified the taste. The drinks went perfectly fine with these all. Coming to the cupcakes, they floored us with the sheen they bring along and taste wise they were crunchy , yummy, saltish, sweetish and every ounce of taste you'd expect to boggle your taste buds .

The place is very well known for its cupcakes which are really very good, but other than that it did not impress me much. We ordered the gur chocolate cupcake, a very odd combination apparently but together they work wonders. The sweetness of the jaggery and chocolate together was not overpowering but was balanced out well. We tried savouries like chicken pot pie and grilled chicken sandwich with cheddar.The potpie was good,could do with a bit of seasoning.The sandwich was bland. Service was a bit slow,but it is understandable given the rush of the place.

The cupcakes here are DELICIOUS. but expensive. A small cupcake costs Rs45 and is approximately 2 bites in size. The buttercream icing is yummy. The caramel chocolate cupcakes were tastier than the chocolate hazelnut cupcake. 
The pizza was also good, but oily. In my opinion, the place is overpriced.

Mrs Magpie is not a restaurant or bakery ,it is rather an emotion.I love the feeling of the cupcakes that ¬†burst out in different flavours and amaze you every-time you try a new one whether its with nolen gur or lemon ,they always come up with new insides for their cup cakes.The sandwiches are filling and wholesome and Darjeeling tea is all authentic and the gulab jamun flavoured ice cream should never be missed

Though I'm don't have a sweet tooth, last year during Christmas eve I was passing by this shop, and decided to bring home something for my family. 
The place was full with people of all ages. We managed to get a seat and wanted to try out some of their stuff from the menu then. Ordered 2 pots of tea, one was of Peppermint and the other one was Earl Grey along with some Gingerbread-man cookies. Both these flavors were new to us and something different too. Also tried some of their dainty cupcakes. 
Having tea was indeed a great way to enjoy that evening, and before leaving we got packed a box of marzipans which were larger than the cupcakes - just the perfect size I was looking for!! 2 of them had a liquid toffee center (just like a jolbhora sandesh lol) and the other 2 had a praline flavor (the green ones in my uploaded picture) and they were the best!! 
Pricing was on the higher side because of their standards but the experience was worthwhile.

Mrs. Magpies is one of the quintessential bakeries in South Kolkata. Extremely well decorated and true to its name. All the desserts here look delicate and cute. My favourite is their "nutty praline" , "sweet n salty" and "cherries n cream" cupcakes .

The nutty praline has a salted caramel filled centre, with praline buttercream cream and toffee peanuts .

The sweet n salty cupcake also has a salted caramel filled centre and is topped with a dense chocolate ganache like cream.

The cherries n cream is filled with a cherry filling as the name suggests and is topped with a mix of cherry filling and vanilla buttercream.

I didn't like their "cinnamon and apple" , "lemony white chocolate" and "mushi mushi" cupcakes. The "marshmallow" cupcake is neither too good , nor that bad either , a one time eat.

Apart from the cupcakes I've also tried their " vanilla-nutmeg caramel custard " and "cookies and cream". I found the caramel custard a bit too eggy for my taste .
The cookies and cream , which is a dessert in a cup has a chocolate cake layer at the bottom and a velvety soft , caramel tasting buttercream on top ,drizzled with more caramel sauce.

A must try is their "Hot Chocolate". I think they use Hershey's chocolate for making it and it tastes phenomenal.

The USP of this place is the cute marzipan decorations on the cupcakes . I don't like the taste of their marzipan that much , however the level of artistry used to make decorations the way they do is praiseworthy. I visited the outlet yesterday night an hour before closing time and was shocked to find that they only had cookies , marzipanimals and brownies for sale. All the cupcakes were sold out. So if you're looking to satisfy a late night craving it's a better option to look for other nearby bakeries that are still open which might have cakes for sale. Other than that , this outlet doesn't have any glitches as far as I see it .

The price is slightly on the higher end but it is worth spending for satisfying cupcake cravings once in a while.

Will definitely keep visiting to try more of what I like and some of what I haven't tried as yet ! :)

Easy to reach once you're at Rashbehari Avenue, this quaint and well decorated place serves the best hot chocolate in the world. Period. 
The cup cakes are good but I felt they are over hyped.  Although, I'd have to say that i really loved their marshmallow and sweet and salty cupcakes. 
We also ordered their chicken sausage roll which was nice but could have been better seasoned, and chicken quiche which was good. 
I found the scones lacking flavor and drier than I would like. 
The prices are just a bit on the higher side given the portion. 
The service was nice. Can't stop loving their hot chocolate. 
Ambience: 8/10
Food: 7/10
Service: 7/10
Value for money : 7/10
But 4 only for the hot chocolate.

Mrs Magpie has been a wonderful experience to us.

It was a Saturday morning. We were looking for a proper cute and lively place to spend a lovely morning till noon while watching a movie on our laptop. We just suddenly decided to go to Mrs. Magpie since we've always wanted to go this place after it got renovated. And voila! We reached this cute restaurant in just a few minutes like magic. (This place is magical)

The waiter gave us the breakfast menu as soon as we sat down at our favourite corner of the cafe. We ordered one Lemony White Chocolate cupcake and one Cinnamon Apple cupcake (both of which are really cute and tiny cupcakes) along with two cups of their famous Hot Chocolate. We simply loved their cupcakes and I am can't even begin to describe how wonderful and warm the Hot Chocolate was. The Hot Chocolate was a pure chocolate affair and as chocolate fanatics we have fallen in love with it.

For a morning snack we had one large Frosted Sweet and Salty Cupcake which had a cute candy mushroom placed nicely on top of it. I'm in love with the cute decorations these cupcakes at Mrs. Magpie have. <3

Finally for brunch we ordered the Chicken platter which has three cute-sized (made-up word!) burgers with semi-spicy chicken pieces and veggies inside. It is very wholesome. Also we ordered the Ham and Cheese Quiche which my friend thoroughly enjoyed but it wasn't my favourite thing to eat as I'm not a big fan of the ham. But yes the Quiche is amazing as my friend gave it 4.5 stars out of 5. For a drink we had the Orange punch which was really good as well.

The d√©cor is so pretty with its pastel coloured walls and cute black birds painted over those walls. I am in love with all the photo frames cause they are so aesthetic and looks so vintage and I love that look in particular.

The waiters are so friendly and helpful. One of them have helped us choose our food items so thank you for that. We were wished Good morning as we entered the cafe in the morning and we were waved goodbye with a wide smile and thank you from the waiters, so I must give props to them for being so nice to us. That's some great training right there.

P.S My friend loved the quite atmosphere in the early mornings at Mrs. Magpie so he's planning to go and sit in a quite corner and pen down poems and stories 'cause the interior and the food and people really have made Mrs. Magpie a perfect little place that inspires the heart and the soul. :-)

We went to Mrs. Magpie for a relaxed coffee on a weekday evening. The small coffee shop looks like a tea party scene from an Enid Blyton book. 

We ordered for a macchiato and a hot chocolate. 
The drinks tasted fine but the cups were dirty and sticky. The hot chocolate is like hot chocolate sauce with barely any milk, so it's a win for the chocolate lovers. They bought a pot of brown sugar. The sugar had become a large lump and even on turning the pot upside down, nothing fell out. They bought no spoons with it. Neither with the coffee or the hot chocolate. 

We ordered for a garden omelette. The omelette tasted good. But I couldn't find any bell peppers as mentioned in the menu. Again, the cutlery was dirty. A big turn off. We asked for ketchup which came in a pot with no serving spoon. 

It was full even on a weekday. It's a place for adda for many people. So if you go at the wrong time you might be stuck just waiting for a table. 

Service was decent. But I wouldn't say I am keen to revisit it as basic hygiene and serving etiquette is extremely important for me.

This cafe is located just 5 mins walking from Lake Girls School in Southern Avenue. Visited today with my friends and was highly disappointed with the food. The decor was fancy and pretty but the food out here is overpriced compared to the quantity. We had ordered potato wedges hot chocolate and chocolate milkshake. There were just 5 pieces of potatoes which costed 115 bucks. The hot chocolate was just pure thick chocolate in a cup. The size of the burgers cupcakes are so tiny that if you take 2 bites its all over. This is one cafe where you will get food in micro sizes which are overpriced. Will never recommend to anybody.üòà

Oh and, the hot chocolate here is amazing (It really is).

This cafe has one of the cutest decor ever with it's cherry blossom wallpapers.
I've lost count of how many times I've visited this place just for the Cherry and cream cupcake.
I'm not a chocolate lover so Marmy vanilla cupcake and Lemony white chocolate are probably my second favourites.
I've tried Sandwiches here, ice cream, Sliders (veg, chicken and meat)
The Scones here are marvellous; do try them. The cheese scones, blueberry scones are just lovely.
The Ham n Cheese quiche is my favourite in the savory dishes. There food and quaint ambience attracts me again and again. It's an ideal place for an afternoon tea or a coffee with your bae or friends.
A must visit at least once.
Missing out on the 5.0 rating is the over priced items on the menu.. but it's worth it.

If you have sudden dessert cravings,Mrs. Magpie is the best place to calm you heart and soul.Located in Southern Avenue,this place is small yet cozy.It is cutely decorated with small chairs and tables.The best part is that when you open the door,a bell chimes - this gives a perfect country house feeling ‚ù§.In one word, the ambience stole our heart.

Coming to the food,as I said,a perfect place to soothe your dessert cravings . We ordered -

‚àö Peanut Butter Cupcake : The cupcakes of this place is amazing.We wanted to try all but finally decided to have these three ‚ù§. This one tasted awesome.

‚àö After 8'ish Cupcake : I did not like this one personally,the chocolate had mint in it which is not something I like.

‚àö Cinnamon Apple Cupcake : This was the best among the three.It was too good ‚ù§

P.S. : All the cupcakes looked marvellous and delicious. Kudos to the presentation of all the cupcakes üëçüëç

‚àö Grilled Chicken and Cheddar Sandwich : The sandwich fillings were good but it was over grilled.Did not like that part much.

‚àö Chicken Platter : This had three small burgers which tasted really good.The bread was soft and the fillings were perfect to make you fall in love with them.

‚àö Hot Chocolate : Mrs. Magpie serves the best hot chocolate in town !! That is all what I have to say to express my feelings ‚ù§ . Highly recommended.

‚àö Vanilla Nutmeg Caramel Custard : We were doubtful before ordering this one.But now we realise, thank god we ordered this.It was just delicious and awesome.It was the best among all that we tried.Highly recommended again !! ‚ù§

The service was great and we had a great time there.

Hoping to visit this place more often in future ‚ù§

You, Kolkata and an early morning flight results in craving of a luxury breakfast. Once you come out from the airport and hop inside a cab, the destination calls for that one beautiful name ‚Äì ‚ÄúMrs. Magpie‚Äù. It is slightly located on the inner lanes but once you reach there‚Ä¶What are you thinking?
                                                                ...

Food was average. Service was slow. Billing was not done well. Pesto didn't have enough salt. Interior was good but too much noise inside by kids running around.

I've always loved Mrs.Magpie because it's the cutest caf√© ever and the cupcakes were the best at one time. However recently, the quality has diminished to an extent as the cupcakes are dry and the icing isn't as great as it once was.
The ambience is nice though slightly loud. The cafe itself is very well decorated and it's a nice place to hang out. 
Definitely order the hot chocolate if you're a chocolate lover because it's sinful and rich and hits all the right spots. The chicken sliders are great too.
However, the cafe rests on its claim to have the best cupcakes, which in all honesty need a little improvement.

Yes it is exactly like the reviews and pictures describe the place. Small, snug and cozy, with nice ambience. The food here tastes good and is not overpriced, but there's another problem with the food. The portions are very very very tiny. We ordered a lot of stuff and the shepherd's pie was smaller than the size of my fist,  the sliders were so small you can actually finish them in one big bite. Yes everything tasted wow, but you really don't like taste that vanishes after a second right? Almost everything here can be finished in a bite or two. So 3.5 for everything, and 1.5 deducted for such wee portions.

Who wouldn't be allured by the charm of pink and white wallpaper and enchanting cupcakes of every conceivable flavour? That's the reason i coaxed my family to visit this cafe, which i had heard so much about...but what might have been an experience to cherish turned out to be nothing short of a nightmare...the service staff were far from polite, the food far from fresh...so far from fresh, that i writhed and suffered with a bout of food poisoning post my visit there...i was extremely unwell and needless to say, excruciatingly disappointed.

Bad food coupled with bad behaviour that kind of sums up our experience at this presumptuous cafe - the chicken slider mini burgers that were served to us tasted stale and the salami inside seemed to be the culprit - this led to all of us who ate the sliders fall sick - even the after eight miniscule cupcakes were! far from being fresh - when this was pointed out to the staff they brushed away our feedback in a brusque manner let alone offer fresh replacements
Our advice would to stay away from this eatery given our sordid experience there

The Best Cafe of Kolkata and the only one which can match the top cafes of Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru.
Situated in a quaint street of southern avenue, there's a French like feel to the place.
Great for coffee and cupcakes.

This place reminds me of my childhood tea parties one with my favourite toys thanks to the small table , chairs 
And the pink wall with small butterflies . The 1st would that comes to mind is "oooo so cute " when one enters this small cake shop . 
It offers a wide range of cupcakes in both regular and mini sizes . 
We tried 
Chocolate milkshake: 3 (it disappointed me as I was expecting something wow from them)
Caramel coffee custard: 5 ( probably the best custard I ever had. It's was a perfect blend of coffee and caramel)
Chocolate hazelnut cupcake: 4 (nutty and creamy)
Chocolate and mint flavoured cupcake (can't remember the exact name) : 4.5
[Loved the combo of Mint and chocolate] 
Service was very good and fast

It was a much awaited catch up with one of my old friend and we are searching for a calm cafe to sit and have a long awaited chat. This restaurant perfectly suited our needs. The walls are simply and beautifully adorned with pictures, the seating arrangements are done with perfection. I fell in love with the small cupcakes. The cold coffee was quite normal. I would suggest to please consider on the promptness of customer request because we actually waited for long even for a glass of water. Cheers and carry on with the good work.

Aaah! This place. It's been two years I have been in Kolkata but I didn't find a place to replace this beautiful place. Though the location is hard to find for one who is new to Kolkata, but you will be shocked to see the crowd in this place. This place can make your evenings go perfect. I have tried their Cupcakes and the most favourite ones are marshmallow cupcake and cherry and cheese cream cupcake. Oh! I can't end this review without mentioning their thick hot chocolate. It's so so good. You can try their coffee also.. It's worth it. Prices are reasonable as the quality of the foods are superb. The other items on the menu(I have tried quite a few) are okish.. But you won't regret, trust me. This place is a tiny cute place and is definitely worth a try.

Direction: It's in southern Avenue .. get off at Basanti Devi college and walk straight down the lane turn second left and there you are...

Ambience : Noisey.. but homely feeling..

Food: I tried tea and my mom tried coffee.Its good and pocket friendly too .. 

Service: very dissatisfied disappointed with the service.. I waited for about half an hour till they took my order.. Inspite of going to the counter and telling them to take my order thrice.. 
There is this boy Raju Mondal who helped me to take my order and I want to thank him.. I had such a bad headache and went for a coffee .. after this long wait when I finally got my tea I was having a massive headache and it had to be taken care of with a medicine... If I would have had the tea in time I could have had avoid the medicine...

Location: Located at one of bylanes of gariahat, at Purna Das Road. We took a direct cab using Zomato Uber. 
From outside it seemed to be a little toy store to my friend .
Inside, it's pretty pink and blue, straight out of fairy tale. The small chairs tables and the light decor gives a much easy breezy and laid back feel.
Service: we tried cold coffee , that was good nothing exceptional to mention. The chicken cheese balls are ordinary,a bit bland for my taste. The cup cakes are good. We tried mushi mushi and nutty praline. But I have had better ones at more reasonable prices.
As it was a Saturday evening all the tables were full with people waiting outside. As a result, The service was little slow. We had to ask for water twice before we were served with 2 glasses of water. 
Overall: good. Can visit once again for the savouries and hot chocolate.

Hii. 
I brought my boyfriend here cause I heard this place is the best for hot chocolate in kolkata. 
So after a lot of Google mapping i managed to find the place. The place looks like a sweet doll house, everything was so neat, colorful , pretty and cute. The door has a bell, which rings the moment someone gets it. üôÉ
So coming to the food. 
We ordered üç∞ lemon meringue and nutty praline among the cupcakes. Both were very cute and yummy 
Next we ordered pesto chicken and Shepherd's pie. 
They were yummy too, the sandwich was unique anf filling. 
Now coming to the üç´‚òï hot chocolate... it was mind blowing... both me nd he kept wanting for more. The hot chocolate is actually melted bitter sweet chocolate in the perfect consistency. I loved it. 
This place is a must go for girls, and chocolate lovers. 
And also this place this place is so pocket friendly, that I could manage to give my bf, a treat!! üç¨

This cafe is located in Southern Avenue. The first thing which came to my mind entering this outlet was cute...yeah with pink interior heightened by lights. Theres a display by the door showcasing their cupcakes and cookies. To give it an authentic look in line with their theme that of countryside English old Cottage styled cafes, you would find they have made doors and windows with colours peeling off. Rusted iron tables and chairs which accentuate the theme.

Now coming to the food we went on a Saturday late afternoon and ordered¬†

Chicken Club Sandwich
Roast Chicken Sandwich
Latte
Cappuccino¬†

Nothing to highlight exclusively..all was ok stuff. I would definitely go back for their cup cakes, brownies and add to this review

I had heard so much about the hot chocolate here that I had to give it a try! 

Probably because of my very high expectations from the place I was a bit disappointed with the hot chocolate. Even though it tasted really good, it seemed to be made of simply liquid chocolate and had an odd texture. Plus the price for that small cup of hot chocolate seemed a bit on the higher side. 

Will have to go back again to try their super collection of cup cakes!

The ambience and decor is quite unique. Though a little under staff but the food will make up for it. 
The salt lake outlet is best if you are taking your toddler along, they have a small play area for toddlers.
The value for money quotient is high. Great place to hangout with friends.

Ms Magpie was quite a place when it started - the food and decor were wholly delightful...but I guess many food joints go south bound in quality soon after the popularity is established :-( Same, here.

The recent experience wasnt' great. The quantity of chicken in the cold sandwich had shrunk considerably and the bread could be more soft and moist. ¬†
The Shepherd's pie was a disappointment with lot of gravy inside and very little minced meat. It was almost a mashed potato pie, steeply priced.
I ordered for a couple of peanut butter cookies with tea (which was good) and was told they can only be sold by weight and cannot be served with tea. I would expect better consideration.¬†
The nice Victorian, cast iron bench has vanished from the pavement in front replaced by plastic chairs and that's pretty bad!
The roasted sandwich was good ...and that one with the tea saved the experience from being a total spoiler!

Nicely decorated , though the pink color annoys me but still i loved it.
We ¬†only had desserts, ¬†Cupcakes( nutty praline and marshmallow) and ice cream(cappuccino).¬†

Continuing my tryst with happy places, I ended up here on a winter morning post breakfast at another nearby outlet. Well, despite the fact that we sampled nothing out from the breakfast menu, this place left me content in terms of ambiance and experience. It's a cozy little place with a lot of colour. There are colours everywhere. Right from the cutlery stand on the tables to the panes of the window. There are small trinkets here and there that may catch your attention. It is a place that would just lift up your mood. And if one wishes for a bright start to the day, Mrs. Magpie would live up to the expectations hopefully. We tried a sampling of the 'oh! so famous' cupcakes here along with a cup of cappuccino and the brownie. The brownie we liked so much that it begged a reorder. The cup cakes were good and the coffee did justice to itself. Am sure to visit here again to try the other savories and options. It's a wonderful place for a small meet-up, cozy private conversations or maybe just to spend some time with yourself and some good small eats for company. Looking forward to the next visit.

Happy eating!!!

I had a "chicken and cheese sandwich", which tasted absolutely FANTASTIC! :) However I didn't taste cheddar anywhere, despite it saying so. This place is also quite expensive - it was 177 for this sandwich (2 small pieces), while KFC I think gives a whole *meal* for approx 200!! Just saying.
Anyway, I was just wondering - it would be so cool for this place to have another outlet which would be big enough to have live music, standup comedy etc etc. - you know? Another cafe, which has recently opened, and several more all round the city are doing that, so I thought it would be a good idea for THIS one... it's always full whenever I pass it, maybe the idea for¬† another, BIG outlet could be sold to an investor? :)

I liked the sweet and salty cupcake. It was indeed very unique but that's the only nice thing I have to say about this place.
For vegitarians, this place has very less to offer. I literally had to choose between a sandwich or a burger. And what's with the miniature versions anyway ? The burger was served cold and dry. 
The waiters aren't trained enough. 
I feel it's an over hyped place and doesn't live up to it. I wouldn't consider going back.

This quaint little English cottage style cafe reminded me of the fairy tale Hansel and Gretel... With its warm and homely decor, it welcomed us with small ting of the bell at the entrance on a wintry afternoon. It was Christmas time so the cakes and desserts were all themed. The cupcake parlour looked like a dessert paradise. We took The Lemon Cream, Nutty praline, Peanut butter and After8ish cupcakes... I loved all four of them, the frosting was smooth, creamy and rich, and the filling inside the cupcake was amazing. The cupcakes were little bundles of joy. We also ordered the Hot Chocolate and Ham and Chicken Quiche. I felt that the hot chocolate was too sweet as I prefer the bitter dark hot chocolate but the quiche was good. I just felt the portions are less compared to the price charged but apart from that I really enjoyed myself and would love to come back again for more delicious cupcakes. I had packed the lemon tea cake and cream cheese brownie both the cakes were flavorful. The lemon tea cake was a small packet of lemony goodness while the brownie was rich and the filling of cream cheese inside felt like the marriage between a cheese cake and a brownie... thank you Mrs. Magpie for such a wonderful winter afternoon memory which shall always be cherished...

However the place is a bit pricey.

A friend suggested Mrs. Magpie for a quick evening snack and I was completely awed by this place. Beautiful Barbie house type interiors reminds you of childhood days. Everything is pink and perfect. They mostly serve bakes and deserts but are most famous for creative cupcakes both in terms of taste and decoration. We had ordered for vegetarian platter, hot chocolate, nutty praline, lemony white chocolate, after 8‚Äôish, chicken mushroom puff. Food was good and staff is very friendly and courteous. They answered all our queries patiently. I guess children will love this place too!

Hands down, one of the best places I've been to for a while in Cal. The food is decadent, the ambience is quirky and happy and I adore the d√©cor. The exposed lighting, the old rustic metal chairs, the beautiful kettles, everything was brilliant for me. I started off with a few savoury bites of the Chicken and Mushroom Sandwich and the Chicken Platter, both of which were awesome, brilliantly seasoned and not overdone. Solid, great food. Then we moved on to the cupcakes and have a various assortment of those. I highly recommend the Nutty Praline, After 8ish, and Peanut Butter. The Hot Chocolate is out of this world and to die for and the Chocolate Brownie Sundae is just the thing you need to end off on a high note. Simply loved it. Brilliant. Can't wait to go back.  Mrs. Magpie was such an amazing experience, a total symphony of great food and brilliant vibes and it didn't disappoint when it ended with a crescendo.

My favourite place to catch up with friends over a hot cuppa. This pretty cafe is famed for its hot chocolate. It is undoubtedly the best hot chocolate I have ever tasted. I am also a big fan of their quiches, especially the ham and cheese quiche. Beatiful ambience and friendly staff. Reasonable prices. Must visit!

Its a nice place to have some fresh hot chocolate in a cold winter day, which rarely happens here in Kolkata, very well decorated makes the place look kinds cute. The food is okay, unless you want to have pastries and cup cakes. Nothing extraordinary as recommended by few of my friends.

The glass walls, the vibrant decor and the perfectly frosted and decorated cup cakes. Walking in here feels like walking into a fairy tale dream. The ambiance is absolutely fantastic and rich in colors and the beautiful cupcakes is definitely a mood lifter. They also have the option of mini frosted cupcakes that allows you to taste multiple flavors instead of hogging on to just one. Among the wide range of flavors they offer Lemony White Chocolate, Cherry and Cream Cheese and Nutty Praline definitely stands out. They also have sandwiches and sliders although i believe the potion size is pretty small and tastes pretty ordinary. One more thing that you can try from their menu is their coffee caramel custard which tastes pretty good. Well behaved hospitable staff with good service. Will recommend.

Magpie has always been one of my favorites. It is located in purna das road. Decoration and ambience of this place is very impressive. They serve good quality tea. Be it Darjeeling tea or first flush. The hot chocolate is amazing......cupcakes,cakes are heavenly in Mrs.Magpie...my fav. is chocolate caramel cupcake...!!! Had chicken sandwiches and cheese items too which are good one.
Prices are undoubtedly reasonable....keep it up...!!!!

After visiting the Salt Lake outlet of Mrs. Magpie, I could not resist visiting their Southern Avenue outlet located in the parallel lane of Purna Das Road close to Vivekanda Park.

The menu, I mean the cup cakes were almost the sane in both of their outlets. However, this outlet was smaller in comparison to the Salt Lake one. I ordered one Nutty Praline, Mushi Mushi and marshmallow. I have been a fan of Mrs. Magpie's creativity. The cupcakes were so amazingly cute, its difficult to eat these masterpieces. The nutty praline was amazing, the frosting was buttery and creamy. The marshmallow was good as well, especially the fondant honey on the top of it. Mushi mushi was averageish.

This place is highly recommended for having some amazing creative desserts.

Yet again, a place I've never been, although I've had their cupcakes at various festivals. The cupcakes are delightful, both with respect to aesthetics and taste, one cannot deny that. The Nutty Praline is quite the best, with the lovely nutty cream on top of the chocolate sponge and caramel in the centre. There is however no denying that the prices are extravagant, the tiny cupcakes can be inhaled - they are that small and each costs about 55 rupees. It's worth it if you're willing to dish out a lot.

Out of 4 points points 3 will go for its decoration. Their cute, colorful yet clasy interior will make anyone feel good. Their effort was visible and appreciable to make every corner of the restaurant different and beautiful. The hand painted cutlery mug, the bill box, the bell in the door even the beautiful washroom door everything will draw your attention. This place is little hard to locate if you are not following Google maps. 

We ordered Darjeeling tea, capuchino, chicken and Cheddar cheese sandwich and a chocolate cupcake. The food wasn't magnificent but was satisfactory. I loved the Caramel filled chocolate cupcake. 
Pricewise I felt it was totally justified. Just go there if you want to spend some good times your loved ones.

Perfect in one word. Although not spacious enough but pretty nicely decorated with tiny chairs to make comfortable on. Their signature food is cupcakes hence the theme is doll house. 
Staffs are good and heeding at both place counter and table. I went there with my hubby and had Cappuccino, Darjeeling tea as to start with and followed by Marshmallow Cupcake, Salt n sweet cupcakes, Lemony wht cupcake. Everything tested heavenly yummy üòã‚ù§Ô∏è
Marshmallow melts into mouth and the lemon flavour at every bite on Lemony wht cupcake makes your mind happy.
I found it pocket friendly and worth the visit üòä
They count SRV Tax 6.00% and Vat 14.50% on bill.
Recommend u al. Try it today!

Slightly awkwardly located in southern avenue, I finally got a chance to hop into this much talked about cafe-bakery in town. It was one of those chilly winter evenings when all I could really think of was a cup of hot Darjeeling tea.
Upon reaching the spot, I made myself comfortable near the counter. I ordered what I came for. I quickly grabbed the menu only to find myself thoroughly confused with the names of the cupcakes, sandwiches and savouries. My eyes caught the colouful cupcake counter, I didn't give it much thought and ordered the nutty praline right away. My friend ordered his sandwich. I was still in awe of that cupcake sight and wondered if I had made the best choice after all. ;)
Next, the interior is very English like and cheerfully lit up.
My tea arrived soon after which the sandwich and mini praline followed. The tea was Darjeeling. The sandwich served with light potato chips was lipsmacking and the presentation was delightful. About the cupcake. What can you probably expect from such a mini cupcake? Not much right? But it was actually far from what I expected. It was so juicy and succulent. It had a really rich inside filling which made it so rich in taste. YUMMY. I loved it!! I also picked up a pack of rich butter cookies which are equally amazing!!! I'm going back again for more cupcakes. :)

Cute place, true. Vibrant, festive¬†ambience, and spacious.
Items ordered involve Baked Fish Pie, Chicken Pot Pie and a Ham&Mushroom Puff, Chicken Platter(Sliders), Hot Chocolate, and Mini Frosted cupcakes of Marshmallow, Nutty Praline and Peanut Butter

The pies were delicious but too inadequate even for one person. The puff was small and the filling very less and lacked any taste whatsoever.

The mini cupcakes were really tiny, and lacked any distinct flavour as such though they looked absolutely stunning and picture perfect.

The hot chocolate tasted like good company in solitude.

In one word the place is worth visiting for. Specially if you have sweet tooth just rush to this place. The Cupcakes after soo adorable that you would never want to cut them and pop in your mouth rather keep them preserved. The prices are on the higher side but trust me it's worth paying for. We went there for birthday treat. We ordered one large hot chocolate which was ok but too sweet for my taste buds, my friend ordered expresso double shot coffee which was too much strong. Coming to cupcakes we ordered  one mini marzipan, one mushi mushi, one marizipianimal, one nutty praline  undoubtedly they looked so cute and tasted great and we ordered one club sandwich which was superb yum. Next time am gonna visit again for sure.

This place is the epitomy of cute. As soon as you enter the place you feel happy as you smell the coffee being brewed and somethig bakingh, the walls are painted a warm salmon pink color which just lights up the place and the little cherry twine wallpaper just add to the decor. It's an ideal date place because it's pretty cheap. The cupcakes were really good. The nutty praline especially it had a crrammy centrr in the cake also which was a nice surprise. And the hazelnuts on the cream was an added bonus.

What a cute place! Let me begin by saying that I just loved Mrs. Magpie so much that when I visit Kolkata again, I'm surely going back. From the decor to the staff to the menu, everything is just, one word, so nice.

So, classic ambiance. You'll love spending time there; go with a friend or your love. The staff is soft-spoken and very helpful. Keep it up.

Food, wow, just wow. From coffee and tea to finger sandwiches, scones, and cupcakes, everything is heavenly. And yes, totally worth the price.

I really wish that a Mrs. Magpie outlet opens in Mumbai soon. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

Went there on a Chritsmas eve, so understandably the cafe got crowded pretty soon. Outside bench is cute but then it can get boring there as the cafe is located on a very quite place.¬† Interiors and overall ambience is nice but there are clear signs that the place need an upgrade specially the central sofa. I was not happy with the service and the food. Ordered something close to chicken sandwich (not-grilled), it came with few chips which I am sure was cooked in the lowest quality of oil. They should provide better quality chips or else just skip it. Didn't try any cupcakes, and coffee was just normal. Not very pricey as well.

The place is very pretty. But everything is a tad bit pretentious. I visited this evening, it was too noisy and didn't live up to the hype.

And the waiters too were a little dismissive, simply because we didn't order all that much.

Amazingly cute little place with a surprisingly large number of people crowded inside (not to mention the people waiting outside for a seat). The cupcakes tasted amazing (albeit they were a tad bit small, I could have eaten them in one bite). The chocolate milkshake was sublime, and the Coffee Caramel sundae was simply divine! The bill did bite our pocket at 500 rupees, but the time spent there was worth it.

This outlet of Mrs. Magpie is located near keyatala in Lake Terrace road.The store is very creatively decorated and It's always bustling with youngsters.They cared for every little detail. Even the mugs containing the forks and knives were properly decorated.Their specialty is the variety of cup cakes and muffins which not only look good but taste good as well.
We tried 3 cup cakes( nutty praline and sweet & salty) and 2 cappuccino.Both the dishes were delicious.The staffs were friendly and suggestive, which we liked very much.
You will definitely be a happy soul once you are here.

A quaint little place straight out of a fairytale (Reminds me of the candy house in Hansel and Gretel) which has gained great popularity. The doll-house furniture, the cutlery and crockery, the staff who are always courteous albeit slightly frazzled by the ever persistent crowd, is just lovely for a rendezvous with friends over cups of tea and sinful cupcakes. My all time favourite is the Sweet and Salty chocolate cupcake. The chocolate caramel cupcake is another treat to the taste buds. Beverages are well blended and of good quantity. The savoury items are standard. The Shepard's Pie is brilliant. The high tea buffet is great because of the unlimited cupcakes but the savoury items could be a tad dry. The bite size pizza and puffs weren't too great.
All in all, a great place for the sweet-toothed.

The decorations put up for Christmas made it all the more amazing. Really felt as if it was snowing outside and we were in this warm cozy cafe having a gala time, revelling in the Christmas period. Made me really dreamy. Coming to the cupcakes....yes they were heavenly. The look of each was so so cute and the taste was so so good.We tried out other stuff also like sandwiches etc. Food is very good. The service is very quick and efficient, very well mannered staff.

The place is much like what a dessert parlour should be. It screams warmth and happiness mingled with the smell of cakes and cream. The decor is fun, the service staff friendly and an exciting spread albeit not huge in number. I ordered as many as six cupcakes and the ones worth mentioning are Cherry 'n' Cream Cheese, Lemony White Chocolate and Marshmallow. Mushy Mushy is good too but those three are the winners. The hot chocolate is thick and delicious, the cold coffee is decent and the Snickers ice cream is fun. The only disappointment was that some cupcakes seemed a bit dry but the frosting was amazing. Overall I can conclude that I wish to go back..... many times more....

I went their with my family and loved the mini cupcakes and tasted the cherry n cream cheese, marshal marshmallow and lemony white chocolate. We also ordered the chicken pot pie. It was good. Also ordered the chicken sliders which was 3 mini burgers with some chips and sauce. Among the sweet things we ordered the raspberry granola pot and we loved it the most. Every item was mouth watering and a delight for people with sweet tooth.

Went to Mrs. Magpie this Friday.This place is very creatively decorated. If you are a dessert lover then this is the place to go. They offer the best cupcakes in town. Do try their mini cupcakes Mushi Mushi, Nutty praline, Marshmallow. The best out of this would have to be Nutty praline-the best combination of sweet and salty. But the cupcakes are really overpriced. We also tried out Hot chocolate and coffe carmel custard.
Service was good enough. Has been a great place to hangout with friends.
Would definitely revisit!

According to me it was a very nice place to make your sister, girlfriend , or any woman happy. Food is okay ,but for the cup cakes and pastries ,they are decorated in a very nice way . I would reccomend to teens and very young people(girls and kids especially). It is not a family restaurant just go there for snacks .It has a kind of a early teen girl's or a girl child's bedroom environment. Group of boys or any boy may not enjoy it alone( with due respect to everyone , please dont get offended this is just for suggestion purpose and what I felt). But I would surely suggest every woman in town to have a visit there and revive their childhood.

Okay so in order satisfy the greed for dessert after every meal we tried to curb down the lust for the cravings by giving a try to this place. Already this place was being in the hype from a long time so worth a try.
Located in the diversified cuisine hub of Purna Das Road of Southern Avenue, anyone can use google map to locate it. The interior & ambience is fantastic, giving you a feeling a true bakery outlet. The array of cupcakes, sandwiches, puffs, & many more are displayed at the front. We went for:
Sweet n salty marzipan, Frosted Marshmallow cupcakes, Frosted mushi mushi cupcakes, coffee caramel custard & hot chocolate.
One can't find any cons for dessert but my personal favourites were the marzipan & the marshmallow cupcakes.
Pocket pinch for two will be around 350, if u can limit your cravings.
P.S. They serve you with books and magazines too for reading.

By tracking GPS navigation... Avoiding bylanes... Looking here n there.... And voila! D patisserie is here! On occasion of my lil sister's bday, i dropped in here for some change of cakes. And was totally in awe of how CUTE is this place!! Beautiful decor, warm lights n well furnished.... Loved d ambience. Coming to the main excuse dats food. Though i wanted a bday cake medium size... But d cupcakes got me distracted. I took an assorted pack of 6 cupcakes nd a large one. Even if d cakes priced a bit high, but oh my wen i tasted them, yummy n price was apt for d flavours. Every single cupcake burst with unique flavours, d stuffing n frosting along wd the fluffy cake. Thanks for making her bday special. Keep up and hope to come back soon.

GREAT AMBIANCE ! I must say the ambiance was really attractive and beautiful. It was a cute little cafe with cute little stuff. I was eager to eat those cupcakes at first but when I took the first bite of it , It felt like extreme sugar coated something. But then again Loved the honeybee cupcake. Chicken Tart was really good all its cheese and mayo thing with it. Loved the sandwiches and coffee :) .¬†

The ambiance was really great. It was designed like some cafe situated abroad . for example: It has a¬†bell,¬†in the door, whoever comes it just rings up,.The chairs are too cute. All the Staff¬†are really polite and well mannered !

Such a sweet classic english decor. If the decor is nice, it will definitely boost up your cravings. But the food is not that great what you expect. The food doesn't match the high expectations. The cupcakes are okayish. Only the cookies, which I bought just as a gift item, loved them. Not a second visit place for me.

I first experienced this cute-as-a-button place when its first opened years ago and wowed my friends by sending them boxes of cup-cakes from there for Diwali, when cup-cakes were still to become the buzz word they now are.¬†

Since then, keep going back and their evolution in their food items is truly impressive.¬†
Try their omelettes, they are a meal by themselves and made in the true French meal style.¬†
I love their unusual puffs - a favourite being the aubergine puff (which is now sadly discontinued) and their ham savouries.¬†

But the signature item is their Hot Chocolate - creamy, dark, thick (as you need to lick than just sip) and served in delicate bone china - it is as good as the best in Europe and I can only rate the Godiva Hot Chocolate experience to be better than this. If you haven't tried it - you don't know what you are missing.¬†

Service remains excellent. Prices are not cheap but are matched by quality, presentation and innovation.¬†
Only negative is its size, very few tables and given the quality of food would love to have them expand as a full eatery.

Looking like a cute little doll house this is the place if you crave cup cakes. Located in southern avenue the place is not easily found but when you do manage to find it prepare to be amazed by its cute ambiance.¬†

This place serves a variety of cupcakes of all shape and sizes and all are different in taste. :)¬†
We ordered the veg coronation sandwich, ¬†ham and cheese sandwich, two milkshakes (Chocolate and strawberry) ¬†and One Mushi Mushi cupcake and one sweet and salty cupcake. The cupcakes were splendid as well as the milkshakes. The sandwiches were a little small and delicately made for my taste but still was very tasty.¬†

Overall rating... if you have a sweet tooth... visit here to be amazed. ..... Happy Eating ... :)

Mrs.Magpie is definitely one of the best cafes in town. Right from the entry point, the vibrant yet classy wall of its will surely allure you. Its nice decor and youthful ambience always gives a generous vibe. Coming to the most important part, the coffee, the little bites especially the bakery part is the USP of this place. Chicken pot pie, Ham, Chicken Quiche and Coffee caramel custard are few of my favorites from this cafe.

A little joint in the quiet lanes of southern avenue catering sumptuous cakes, pastries, cupcakes, brownies and also some savoury titbits. Rumour had it that they are good, and I bet they are.
The interior is colorful and cute just like the faces on their cupcakes. I had the apricot yogurt with raspberry reduction which was set in a glass jar and tasted divine. The hot chocolate, chocochip nutty cookies were both made to perfection. There was a choco drink with hazelnut topping which was just about ok while the fish pie, as small as it was, was dry and crumbly. The attenders were courteous and helped in explaining the menu quite nicely. The overall experience was good but could have been better.

This is definitely not the first tym I am visiting Mrs. Magpie,but yesterdays experience was horrible!!!the service was extremely slow,and most of all the person attending us was extremely misbehaving!!!!!! The new introductory priced menu was served for me and a iced lemon tea was  supposed to be served for my husband.it didn't cum fr long thus he was tasting from my portion and not the unlimited serving.suddenly a person came and stop him to have the cookie as it is not supposed to be shared.i cud not make him understand that we are not sharing, he was tasting from me as his portion was not served!!!

Not expected of this dignified place!!!

This cafe is very close to my house in Kolkata. The major attention to this cafe is their Vintage decor. Looks like you have entered a fable of Hansel & Gretel :-)
Food: Menu is elaborate. Food is Ok, nothing major. Average taste. Their Darjeeling Tea is the best so far I had in Kolkata
Service: Quite slow, cannot manage if the crowd gets a little thicker.
Pocket Pinch: Expensive compared to the quality and quantity of the food.
Revisit: Maybe

Want to know, how a doll house looks Like? Then, definitely  visit this place. Pink decor with small table chairs will make you want to relive your childhood. Coming to food, I have tasted alot of stuff on the menu, because  im an ardent fan of this place since 2014. Probably, cupcake was brought in the map of interest by this place. I have tried brownie to the coffee. But, any day scones, fish pot pie with leeks  and ham quiche is my favourite. And mushy mushy cupcake is always on my list, every time I go! 

If you want to have an intellectual or just a casual catch up, with coffee. This is your place!

I opened the doors to this place and i entered a house which i usually saw in fairy tales. Such were interiors with pink walls, Victorian furniture and a strong smell of cakes freshly brewed coffee. 
The array of cupcakes i ordered were too picturesque to be devoured. My partner got into snapping them from many different angles. Each n every cake is like a mantelpiece, and well, delicious too. The coffee was nice, the coffee caramel custard was mmmm.... And well cheap enough. 
Go go, take your girl there! She will thank you forever!

On saptami, went along with my mum and sis. First made our customary visit to my personal favorite - wise owl. Since they were shut down for the entire duration of pujos, decided to visit this place.

We went for the traditional English breakfast. Try as hard as I may not to compare this place with wise owl,i fail miserably as I draw comparisons. Mrs. Magpie had its own distinctive taste but the quantity is really less and also the prices are a tad more expensive.

The ambience is brighter and the seating very comfortable. An absolute delight!

So we went for their low tea buffet at the Keyatala outlet, and found it quite disappointing to be honest. Even though this place has received some very good reviews but personally speaking it was a complete let down. The quantities being served were dismal, didn't  even qualify as finger - food and tasted pretty average. It was like, they would give us a quarter-plate with tiny bits of food, two or three portions at best for each of us, and as you ask them to repeat this, they would take another 20 minutes or more to bring us another plate of that. Neither me nor my friends are gluttons but even for us the food was meagre, as in you wouldn't even serve such quantities at a 3-year old's birthday party. Tastewise, the savoury items were just okay, the non-veg sandwich was basically dry and bland, and we ended up liking the deviled eggs only. 
By that time we realized this was not like a regular buffet spread and this is how it's going to work and it really did irk us. So then we asked them to serve us the mini-cupcakes and we were to choose among three variants, which was supposed to be an "assorted" collection. I liked their nutty praline cupcake and the the other one tasted way too sugary. So when I asked one of the staff to serve us two more cupcakes he answered they didn't have any more of those left.  I was shocked at his response and somewhat miffed so I questioned their "unlimited" clause. That was when they probably sensed trouble and few more cupcakes magically appeared from their kitchen (even though apparently a minute ago they ran out of those.) 
Overall, it's just an overpriced place with a fancy decor and the low tea buffet arrangement was basically a let down. √Ä la carte would've probably suited us better. If the buffet was meant to be a red carpet of sorts for customers to taste their 'delectable' fare and therefore keep coming back, it is a poor poor choice. The green tea was good, and the deviled eggs as I mentioned already but that's not what you expect from a place with rave reviews. 
P.S. If you like confectionery and are ready to splurge a bit, then please go back to our good ol' Flurys or even a French Loaf. This place was an utter disappointment.

Opposite Gariahaat Spencer's a road goes towards Purna Das Road. Leave Crystal Chopsticks on ur left go straight a crossing comes with Azad Hind Dhaba on ur right keep moving straight another crossing comes go left a bit ahead on ur left is Mrs Magpie. Bakery cum Cafe like many other in Kolkata but there is a difference and that's the theme they have used for their shop. Wonderful well thought decor. Based on the ground floor of a flat. Small Cosy chairs and sofas. Looks like Alice in Wonderland and it's mad hatters place. Mainly known for cute colorful cupcakes and snacks like puff and sandwiches. So we checked d menu thoroughly and decided on 2 cupcakes nutty praline peanut butter. Then for smthing on salty side we ordered sliders thr r 4 types veg chicken Mutton and mixed these r 3 mini size burgers with above fillings. They only had Mutton tht time so we ordered. Cappuccino along with this. First came cup cake rather than cup these r small soda bottle cap cakes. Tiny but tasty. Specially for d design and flavourful topping. Both were good. But priced between 40-60 bit high fr these. Then came large cups of cappuccino. It was tasty and reasonable price and came 3 small burgers. Tasty but due to mayo flavour may be tasted bit stale. Along with coffee they give complimentary apple cinnamon cracker which is good in taste. May be this is to promote the cracker. All these costs Rs 400+ wth taxes. Service was ok. Guys were new over there every time we asked about something he was going to the main counter asked them came back and was telling us. All in all nice place to have some snacks and coffee if u got some extra bucks at d end of d month.

Somehow I had never visited this quite renowned eatery till now. Something or the other always seemed to crop up. So went in wuth lot of expectations and today and boy was it fulfiiled. To cut short cupcakes are to die for. Add to that prompt service and excellent behaviour from the staff. Reasonably priced. This place is a must go for dessert lovers. Just one suggestion would be to increase the sitting arrangement. A lot of place seems to be wasted and there was an unnecessary queue outside. But then again that might tamper woth the decor of the place.

This place was on my wish list for quite long. Incredible d√©cor and ambience is too good this place feels like some French patisserie . I had ordered for deluxe marzipan, lemon meringue, Marshmallow , apple cinnamon, earl grey tea and hot chocolate (it was too dense and heavy). I loved the cupcakes , the best part is that they have them in smaller sizes that gives you chance to taste as many as you want . staff was friendly and courteous. Service was quite efficient although this place was full. I had an awesome experience here and I would love to repeat it .

I remember when this place opened. It was pretty, and upmarket, and elegant, and a pleasure to look at. It has changed since then, but so has the surrounding area. I suppose it's just the way Calcutta is - an endless spiral of decay. It amazes me how slums and brick tenements spring up everywhere in this city. Mrs. Magpie is no longer upmarket and elegant, but it is still pleasant. While some things have changed, the hot chocolate hasn't. Served in cute China cups, this beverage is fit for the gods. Dense, thick, bitter sweet, it is what I imagine ambrosia would taste like. I did smell some hammy cheesy sandwichy goodness, but honestly I was too busy trying to lick the dredges of my beverage from the cup. The peppermint tea is very good too, as vouched for by a friend. If you like chocolate, then Mrs. Magpie's hot chocolate is unmissable. The service is expectedly iffy, the VAT of 20.5% ironically high. But that hot chocolate makes everything better. Try it.

The store looks super cute and smells delicious!!
The place is very cozy, warm and just what you need to cheer yourself up.
Please do try the sweet and salty if you are a chocoholic and a cupcake lover... Do try nutty praline... Try ham and cheese quiche, shepherd's pie, club sandwich among the savouries...
If u happen to visit on a rainy day or a winter afternoon, try the sinful hot chocolate followed by peppermint tea to wash it all down...

Updates from visit 2:

Cherry and Creme Cheese cupcake. Just close your eyes and order it. Put a spoonful and prepare to die... The icing is simply superb. You have missed something unless you have tried this.

This outlet of Mrs. Magpie is near keyatala. 1st time I  tried Mrs. Magpie. We ordered chicken club sandwich, chicken ham quiche and brownie. All were yummy. Quality is unbeatable. Staffs were also good. But the one thing for which I am deducting .5 is just because it's overpriced. I mean those tiny cupcakes were of 50-80 rs. Are you serious? Mrs. Magpie, you are in kolkata and we pay in INR nt in dollar/euro/pound. üòÇüòÇüòÇ

This place is very pink and flowery, but that is how you'd expect a patisserie to be. They have cute hi tea's in the menu, complete with a Charlie of sandwiches, cupcakes, scones, chocolates, cookies and tea/ coffee. It is the kind of place where you'd meet up with your girlfriends over tea. Must visit at least once.

Good food with awesome ambiance. The main thing I loved about Mrs. Magpie was the decoration of the place. They cared for every little detail. Even the mugs containing the forks and knives were properly decorated. Coming to the food part, the food was good, if not great. We had one omelette with ham and gruyere cheese and then we had the afternoon tea, which had scones, cup cakes, finger sandwiches, chocolates, tea etc. The staffs were friendly and suggestive, which we liked very much. Time well spent. A must visit for a lazy afternoon treat.

Keeping my mind off those cute cupcakes which you'll feel absolutely guilty about to eat, the caramel custard is the best thing in here. When I have my lunch or dinner outside, I make it a point not to buy an ice-cream, but to pamper myself with this amazing vanilla caramel custard.

Well one of my friend threw her little farewell treat here. At first we had to wait for around half an hour to get a table as it was weekend and we're three people.

Now talking about the place, it's was pretty good,
the ambience and the service, but what I think the quantity of the food was less and price a bit high.
But anyway we didn't have much, But the hot chocolate was damn good. One should try!

I am quite impressed by this small quiet cake shop cum bakery located off southern avenue! Kolkata lacks good bakeries where u can sit & spent some nice time talking over tea. We tried their marshmallow & mushi mushi cupcakes both being just right in the level of sweetness & softness! We also liked the Shepard pie & coffee caramel custard. Their cold coffee as well as their cappuccino is less costly than those in the coffee chains whereas equally good in taste, if not better. We realised we have to come back to try out more after having the complimentary apple cinnamon cookie which came with the cappuccino. Special mention of the amazing custard‚ò∫

Mrs magpie is a small little cake shop in the southern avenue. It is a extremely pretty and cosy place.  The decor is very upscale and comfortable. The place has a limited seating space and is mostly full of people.  The service is a bit slow  though. The cupcakes are amazing here. They are not very sweet put has the perfect balance and richness. They are even very attractive to the eye. The strawberry milkshake is tasty as well. Has the perfect flavour of the crushed strawberry. The price is a little on the higher side this place surely shouldn't be missed .:)

Today it was my second visit to Mrs. Magpie with one of my best friends. Today we took a long walk and tried two different restaurants during the journey. This was the second one.
Well , my first visit to Mrs magpie was for a birthday cake and the experience did not live up to my expectations. I found the price to be unreasonably high for the tiny birthday cake with a very ordinary taste. 
However, this second visit has been proved to be an eye-opener for me. This is a place to try cupcakes and marzipans. The mini cupcakes are tiny pieces of magic which melt in your mouth and melt your heart right away. We tried one cupcake with lemony white chocolate frosting and one nutty praline marzipan. Both of them tasted heavenly. We had also ordered a cup of cold coffee which had the perfect aroma and the perfect balance of sweetness and bitterness in it. The cold coffee tasted way better than that in any other famous coffee shop in the city. We also tried mushroom quiche which was good.
Then I bought a box of cupcakes with four different types of mini cupcakes and marzipans in it. I didn't like the mushi mushi one. It had a strong ginger flavour in the chocolate frosting. Although innovative.
The decoration is like that of a magical house in a fairy land. The staffs are courteous.
The only thing they should provide is a description of each of the cupcakes in their menu.

It was Christmas eve, and I with my family suddenly entered as we were passing by the outlet. 
The decoration was classy and elegant as well innovative and creative,  the foremost thing which attracted our sight. It was all Christmas decoration, and made me nostalgic as they remind me of my childhood cartoon network days... n my favourite character "pengu" was also there as decoration model. 
Now, quality of food was undoubtedly good..and I loved the 'mutton goulash'. Cup cakes were yummy too.
Service is good with a homely ambience.

Most tables were full by the time we walked into the caf√© , so we had to settle for the sofa with the low table. First things first, I feel that the the French caf√©  inspired interiors were carried too far in a way which compromises the basics: comfortable seating, good flow and pleasant service. The sofa was too narrow, and the bolsters they had at the back made seating impossible, so we had to shift to the metal chairs which were too low in the back and in general not catered towards comfortable seating.  The serving staff was not discourteous, but could definitely have been nicer. 

Our order comprised two teas: an Earl Grey and a Peppermint, two liqueur mini-cupcakes: Bailey's and Cointreau, and a Vegetable Coronation sandwich. We later ordered a Darjeeling tea. The Peppermint tea was delicious, the Earl Grey was decent, and the cupcakes were crumbly and had too little of the liqueur filling, but was on the whole of a good quality. The sandwich had an interesting taste combination but the bread that had been used for it was shockingly cheap. I understand that it is a cold sandwich, but care should have taken to ensure that the bread is chosen properly.¬†

Our overall experience was not very comfortable (because of the seating and the service), and while the food was decent, we had to agree with the common gripe against this establishment of serving small portions, which in itself wouldn't have been a problem if the quality could be maintained throughout. Coming to the things we liked: the thoughtful tea service which comprised a clear glass teapot, large ceramic cups with saucers, a bowl of sugar cubes and a complimentary cookie with a hint of ginger and adorable sugar frosting. Secondly, the jazzy playlist on that particular evening was pretty much perfect.  My final verdict: it's a good place which could be even better if certain changes can be made pertaining to how its patrons are allowed to interact with the space, which can become a little alienating and uncomfortable if care is not taken.

This place is right out of the movies. It's a colourful little place with wonderful decorations. The service was really good. The menu was diverse so we ordered the combos on their suggestion and we didn't regret it at all. The sandwiches were delicious and so were the cupcakes. Not much of a sweet tooth but a tried the Scones and the cookies, and they were really good. The coffee and the Assam tea were good as well if not the best that I have had. Went there for a special occassion since it's far away from my place, but will definitely like to return for those sandwiches and cupcakes.

We were a group of 5 and 1 of us ordered a buffet and the others took individual items. 

1) After taking the buffet we were told that half the items weren't available & they refused to fill up the cupcake tray with all the variety of items telling my friend first finish the varieties that are there then we will give you the others (didn't care a bit when my friend told them he didn't want those varieties but the others on the menu)
2) The others ordered quiches and cupcakes from the display which took them over 20 mins to bring from the shelves to the table. We had to keep going to them& literally beg for food.
3) My salmon sandwich took more than 45 mins to arrive. 1 item in the buffet smelt of raw turmeric so my friend asked my sister to smell it. And the manager came running to our table lecturing us that buffet food isn't meant to be shared. Forget the fact that we ordered food besides the buffet worth 1400 & no 1 was interested to have the tiny pieces of buffet food.
It was rude and uncalled for after keeping us waiting for  so long for our food. They didn't bother to serve my friend who took the buffet after 1 serving. Next serving came after 1 hour. By then he just wanted to leave.
If you want to keep a buffet either keep ur items on a table or serve ur customer at reasonable intervals. Overall a horrible experience even though the food was good. Have never faced this in Magpie before. Ruined the evening for all of us.

Due to its super-expensive nature, I've only been there 4 or 5 times since they've opened. However, the recent news of their low tea buffet compelled me to pay another visit yesterday. You can find the low tea buffet menu on their Facebook page. So, won't go into its detail. Pretty reasonably priced, we ordered two low tea buffets with a cup of coffee each. The coffee was refreshing and couldn't have been a better opener. Among the savories, my favorites were the puff (I think they've coined it as vol au vent), sandwich and the pizzette. Among the sconces, blueberry takes the cake (okay that's a PJ). The tea cakes were nice too, but these are must, and you should repeat them. Oh, and the cupcakes vanish from the table sooner than they appear, so you better fill your plates with as many as you can! Just kidding, apart from the usual chocolate ones (there was one chocolate mint too, and I didn't particularly like it), you can have the lemon cupcakes too. I mean I really liked it. Hoping to catch up again soon before their introductory price spikes up due to the heavy demand!

Went to Mrs Magpie on a Tuesday morning. The place is not so spacious, but the dec√≥r is really cute. We ordered, Irish coffee cupcakes, espresso and creamy cheesepuffs and chicken sliders. The cupcakes looked very cute with a tiny marzipan bumble bee smiling and sitting on top of the ganache, but,they were really really mini and were not fresh or  moist. The creamy cheese puff also were ok ok-ish. The espresso was really strong and it wasn't even filled half the cup in which it was served. But the chicken sliders were yummy! The platter had 3 pieces of mini  chicken sliders with crispy  potato chips. Overall the experience was ookkaay.. and i felt the price is a bit high compared to the quantity of food provided, but i wouldn't mind going back again and trying other stuffs!

                I went to Mrs Magpie this afternoon for  a Sunday low tea. In one word, the experience was DIVINE. I've been a regular at the bakery for a while, but the new low tea buffet has taken it to the next level. Especially delicious were the carbonara pizzette, the creamy chicken tartine and chicken and corn quichette. Not to mention unlimited cupcakes and coffee! The staff was super welcoming, generous and helpful. I can genuinely say that it was one of the best dining experiences ever! It truly made my weekend and I would definitely recommend it to all!

Mrs Magpie will give you the feel of a kid entering a dream room the moment you walk in.So many brownie points for the decor. Guys think it's a bit too 'girly' but personally I simply love it. It's super cute and has a pink palette.

Do try their mini cupcakes frosted or marzipan. They are delectable. I personally love the nutty praline, sweet and salty and cherry and cream.
Also LOVE THEIR HOT CHOCOLATE. 
They have a dish called non veg sliders in their menu it's delicious. 
Also the staff is extremely cordial. You will definitely be a happy soul once you are here.

Mrs. Magpie, a quaint little store on Keyatala road, has become a huge favourite of mine in recent times simply because of it's cupcakes. These cute edibles are bound to catch your attention and are tasty too. My favorites are sweet and salty, Bailey's 55, peanut butter, lemony meringue, marshmallow and cherry & cream. Last winter the Choco gur cupcake had also been a nice innovation. The cookies in different shapes and colors, breads, teacakes and a lot more are there on the offer  apart from omelettes, tarts, sandwiches etc. I have tried their broccoli tart and the shepherd's pie and wasn't disappointed. You could drop in here once just to enjoy some delightful snacks and cakes at the well-detailed store and feel at home in the old-world ambience.

In the world of food, " All that looks good/cute not necessarily tastes good". Mrs Magpie is classic example of this. Not at all impressed by their cup cakes. The cup cake bases are not soft/fresh/spongy. They were simply below average. Though the coffee there was quite nice. Also bought their berry filled shortbread which was not comparable to the actual shortbread.

Fan of the cupcakes at Magpie's bistro at Kasba, my maiden visit to the Southern Avenue one left me a tad unhappy - the marshmallow cupcake was dry and crumblish, while the peanut butter one was better but again not as moist as the ones I have had earlier from here.

Fortunately the apple cinnamon cupcake redeemed itself - the apple cinnamon frosting was quite nice and had tiny pieces of fresh chunks of apple slices. The cup cake was moist and nice to munch through.

Hopefully, Magpie would look a bit into being more consistent with their offerings.

This quaint place is absolutely a treat when it comes to satisfying your sweet tooth. Out of the wide array of cupcakes we opted for Nutty Praline, Mushi Mushi, Cherry n' Cream Cheese and the Lemony White Chocolate. The best out of these would have to be the Nutty Praline - the perfect combination of sweet and salty.
We also tried out the Rustic Chicken Sandwich and the Chicken Pot Pie from savoury options and the rich and decadent Hot Chocolate that left the taste buds wanting more.
Would definitely revisit.

I will say that it's an average place with equally average food. The price is on the lower side, but the taste is nothing in comparison to the hype around the place. We tried a mojito mocktail which tasted like grass stew. The mini burgers were okaish. The cupcakes are the stars of the menu, and perhaps the only overwhelming thing about the place.

The food here doesnt only taste awesome but they look super pretty too. Whether you want to spent some alone time or sit quietly with a book or meet up with family and friends, it is the perfect place. We ordered four types of mini cupcakes - irish coffee, marshmallow, cinnamon apple and cherry and cream cheese aling with cheesecake icecream. Needless to say all were yum!!

With a warm and welcoming decor,this is one of the cutest cafe I have been to!
Hot chocolate,savouries,scones,cupcakes-all are delicious and come at a pocket friendly price. The space is limited though and so a short waiting period can be expected before one can get inside.
Cream & cheese cupcake,hot chocolate,chicken & mushroom quiche, cheese scones are top picks according to me.
Take away cupcakes or assorted cookies are recommended as gift items for any dessert lover.
I'll be re-visiting for their breakfast items soon!

We ordered lemon iced tea,cappuccinos,cheese scones,veg coronation and rustic chicken sandwiches,and chicken and cheddar puffs. I also packed cupcakes to go-after 8-ish,marshmallow,lemon meringue with pumpkin seed bread. All the items were just perfect for a light evening snack.
I spent a lovely evening there and hope to drop by again soon.

First visit to Mrs. Magpie and I found things to be real pretentious. The hot chocolate, the cupcakes and the ice creams that we ordered (all things sweet) were highly delectable, no doubt. But the "non-sweet" items on the menu were complete letdowns. It was pretty evident that most of them are getting served microwave heated. And although the light pink decor immediately lifts up your mood, the seating arrangements need to be made a lot more comfortable.

If I ever come back to this joint, I'll do it just for the cupcakes and hot chocolate... that's it!

I have been to Mrs. Magpie numerous times even though I find the walls a little too babyish in their pinkness! Iv been here with friends and with parents. It's tries to fall into a 'classy cafe' bracket but unfortunately there are better versions out there across the country. The food is decent, a tad bit overpriced I believe, but there cupcakes are delightful to look at. I do not have a sweet tooth hence have tried the cupcakes only once, but found them prettier to the eyes than it was tasty to the palate. 
They make fairly decent drinks minus the peppermint tea which I found the  nauseating. Maybe that was just me and not the recipe, I wil never know. 
Overall, an okay place to hang out for evening tea for a bit(e) of old worldly scones and cupcakes and the feels..

I have been to Mrs. Magpie numerous times even though I find the walls a little too babyish in their pinkness! Iv been here with friends and with parents. It's tries to fall into a 'classy cafe' bracket but unfortunately there are better versions out there across the country. The food is decent, a tad bit overpriced I believe, but there cupcakes are delightful to look at. I do not have a sweet tooth hence have tried the cupcakes only once, but found them prettier to the eyes than it was tasty to the palate. 
They make fairly decent drinks minus the peppermint tea which I found the  nauseating. Maybe that was just me and not the recipe, I wil never know. 
Overall, an okay place to hang out for evening tea for a bit(e) of old worldly scones and cupcakes and the feels..

Worth every penny you spend, ofcourse if you are an ardent sweet tooth. If you arent..they have pies and other savories for your delight and finally amazing beverages to sooth your appitite..equally praise worth! 
Apart from that the pastel shades..the seraphic decor..it is inevitable to touch a girly syphophant's heart, reminiscent to mine!

A very cute and beautiful place I should rather say. The cupcakes are very tasty and nicely designed. As a small cafe it is very nicely decorated. The cupcakes realty caught my attention. I visit this place often to taste those cute looking and tasty cupcakes, my personal favourite is the cupcake called Irish coffee.

LOCATION:¬†

Situated on Keyatala lane which runs parallel to Purna Das Road. Use the GPS to get there if you are not familiar with the area as its not easy to find.

OVERVIEW & INTERIORS:

Mrs. Magpie is a one of a kind tea house. Yes, I think I have used the term "tea house" in my reviews for the first time. From the outside it looks smart and chic and from the inside it looks like a doll house and yes I mean every word of what I write quite literally. Laugh all you like but go there and I bet you will be thinking on similar lines. Its pink and orange with white vintage chairs and smells of cookies and tea. Everything has a childish artistic tone to it which is not available at any other place in Kolkata. This is a major reason as why I have scored them 4.0.

WINE & DINE:

We ordered for Veg. Cream Puff, Pesto Chicken Sandwich, Chocolate Pudding and a takeaway of Chocolate Pinwheels.

The Veg. Cream Puff could have been so much more. I thought it lacked in flavors not due to the ingredients which were used, but due to the ingredients which were not used. A herb or a dash of pepper could have done wonders to the same.

The Pesto Chicken Sandwich was was also decent. I liked the bread a lot although the pesto could have done with a but more punch.

The Chocolate pudding was good and honestly its something that everyone loves once its on the table.

The Star of the show were the Chocolate Pin Wheels though. I opened the bag at night while watching the new season of 24 and by the time the first episode ended, I had gobbled them all. They were great. Perfectly shaped and sized and with a great balance of Vanilla and Coco.

Service was good enough.

FEEDBACK FOR IMPROVEMENT:

The savory items could do better.

VERDICT:

Go there for the feel more than the place. Your experience if only based on food will be average but if you like to sit in a unique environment and enjoy a cup of tea with a sandwich and a cup cake, you'll love it !

A sweet little place for bakery items. Great ambience. A little bit pricey. Taste of some of the items can be made better. There are other brander bakeries in the city with better tasty items at a more economical price point.

If you are craving for cupcakes, you have to stop at Mrs Magpie. Thats what we always do when we gorge on them or pack a few for home :) . The liquor filled ones are awesome. Love their Chocolate cupcakes. It has a nice and cosy English tearoom feel. Perfect for an outing with friends over tea and cakes. The easiest way to reach is go straight with Vivekanada Park on your left and turn right at the end of the park. It will be on your left.

This place is basically a doll house. After our amazing experience at their Kasba branch, I decided that I'm going to celebrate my birthday over at their Southern Avenue branch. Typically I celebrate my birthday at my hometown every year, but last year it was mid-week and we decided to do something different, and this place is more than just perfect to do something different.
It was a Wednesday afternoon but we had to a little before we got our seats.
We ordered a medium sized cake ( we were 4 people, 1 doesn't touch anything sweet) and Chicken pot pies. We were provided with a cute little candle and a knife, how cute is that?! ¬†I would ¬†also like to mention here that because of my weird obsession with head gears, my boy friend gifted me this gorgeous Tiara for my birthday and my sister and my boy friend both requested me to wear it while cutting the cake! Awkward!!! However, this place looked like it's straight out of a fairy tale where wearing a Tiara while cutting the cake doesn't feel that weird at all. Honestly speaking, no amount of requesting and begging would have had me convinced to wear a Tiara in Public if it wasn't for this place.¬†
The food was excellent, just as their Kashba branch, and yes, we finished the whole cake!

This is the cutest coffee shop ever. I happened upon it quite randomly; it came up on Google's "coffee shops near me" search. Warm and cozy interiors, coffee and baked goods.

One thing is strange - they wouldn't give me ice for my water. The server explained that they do have ice, but it is for iced tea, not water. I offered to pay for the ice but he just smiled apologetically.

So I didn't get any ice.

I'll give the owners the benefit of the doubt - this is likely not a policy of theirs - but how curious that their staff should default to refusal.

Mrs. Magpie is a cute little place. Excellent decor. Only problem is you will find it tough to get a seat here. The place remains crowded almost always.

We liked most of their cupcakes. Not a big fan of their sandwiches though. The cheesecake icecream was excellent. 

If you are packing something for home, check the items twice. They messed up our order.

It's a very cute and cosy place certainly. I felt that it was more of a boutique cafe than a place to actually have food. The prices are truly high as are most designer things. The salted chocolate cupcake was really good . The salt just adds that extra zing and brings out the taste of the chocolate making it that much more of a comfort food for chocolate lovers. Pastry lovers will certainly enjoy it. The Easter time decorations are very photogenic and it just might be worth a one time visit.

Mrs. Magpie is very near to Golpark. The place is famous for their yummy pastries. They serve beautiful cakes,cookies,pastries and snacks and breakfast. The decoration is very impressive and cute. There are many decorative items made by pastry. Even their water bottles will catch your attention. The pastries are really good and their design is adorable. Price is fair. Staffs are very polite. Try out this place to give yourself a sweet treat and to have a good time with your friends.

What can I say about this place? It is definitely one of my favorite cafes in the city. Having been to both the outlets more than once, I am now writing this review.
The ambience is always wow. The decor is adorable and the vibrant colors of this place is so inviting. This is a perfect place for high tea in the city. 
Coming to the food, I have had-
Cupcakes- I have tried almost everything. Their cupcakes look just as good as they taste. Infact, given a choice I'd devour a whole can of their white chocolate and lemon cupcake frosting without feeling any guilt. 
Sandwiches- Both the sandwiches I have had here have been delicious and crunchy. Chicken Club Sandwiches being my fav one among sandwiches.
Shepherd's pie- Perfectly cooked pastry with a delicious filling. I'd like it to be a bit larger if i am being nitpickey.
Puddings- Coffee Caramel Custard is as wonderful as it sounds. Chocolate pudding was even better. Personally not being a fan of pudding itself, it means these puddings were simply wow if i had to praise them that much.
The Minty Mojito here was a letdown cause it was extremely bland and didn't taste very different from water itself. Lemon Iced tea was great for refreshment, though.
However, my fav item on their menu is the Cheesecake ice cream. It is absolutely delicious and creamy and one of the best ice creams i have ever had.

Definitely gonna go back here in the future.

The place is so neatly designed and gives a total seraphic look. I simply love going to this diminutive doll house sorta parlour. 
Their Hot chocolate and frosted cupcakes being the best. 
According to ur taste buds,u can select cupcakes. They have mint flavour,caramel based,nutty based,etc.
I love their garnishing as well which makes it look all the more tempting and appetising. 
Perfect place to enjoy the scrumptious desserts.

Beautiful, cosy and quaint. Mrs. Magpie is the perfect place to hang out with your girlfriends on a Sunday evening. The cream tea gives you hot Darjeeling tea with tasty scones to go with. 
But the best thing about them are the cupcakes. They do it like no other. The different flavors and the gum candy shapes on top are a win-win every time.

However, too much pink in your surrounding gets unbearably sweet and the only reason I prefer the Magpie Bistro, Kasba one over this. None the less, it is up for the good times always.

We were tired of walking and wanted to have ice cream... had no plans of coming to this place
But .... just as we walking from sarovar towards gariyahat ... this nice little place caught our attention
Looks like a barbie house ... or rather a scene from Alice in Wonderland!
So pretty n well lit!
We ordered for coffee caramel sundae, a chocolate sundae, a rich chocolate ice cream ... and they were all so tasty. The coffee caramel sundae just stole my heart...
My friends took cookies n cupcakes home, while I left the cake shop with the desire to visit again... fir their breakfast , their ice creams n off course their cup cakes.

It's been too long that I wanted to check out this place, and was never getting enough time. Finally S and I decided to pay a visit to this much talked about eating hub, famous for their cupcakes.
We stepped in and were taken aback with the overloaded cuteness all around.
From the wall decor to the bill bowl which came at the end of the evening, everything was full of colours and was amazingly cute. The decor can be well imagined taken out of Hansel and Gretel's wicked witche's candy house, or a imaginary cute version of Mr. Wonka's factory. Everything cute was edible and mushy :D
We sat at the table nearest to the cupcake window, and I pretty much went crazy clicking pics of the mini treasures.
(Am I saying cute too many times? I guess I am :D)
We ordered basically everything off the rack from the non veg savory section, one at a time. They took quite a lot of time to give us each little dish, which makes me think that it were kept on the show stall half-baked, and they were freshly baking the whole thing and serving us, unlike other places which just warm the food up.
We ordered the baked fish pie, Shepherd's pie, muyton gouloush, and ham and cheese quiche, exactly in that order. the perks of having small helpings of each dish is that you get to taste quite a lot of the menu, as well not have too much o a pocket pinch, yet be happily full.
The baked fish pie was layered in three, fish at the bottom, potato above, topped with cheese and it was indeed yummy.
The Shepherd's pie was finished in one mouth full by S and I, and it was lovely, with just te right amount of mashed potato above the pie.
Next we came to the best dish of the day, the mutton ghoulish, which had a very Indian 'dalchini' flavour and was amazing :D
It was our favourite and much recommended.
Next, S happily dug into the ham and cheese quiche, and S said it was nice and creamy and filling.
We parted from the place with a box of mini cupcakes, lemon and white chocolate, apple cinnamon, nutty praline and mango and cheese cupcake.

Definitely a must visit for those who have a sweet tooth. We ordered Irish coffee cupcakes, marshmallows and coffee. But somehow I wasn't satisfied with the cupcakes. Moreover when you have heard so much about those pretty cupcakes, you would really walk in with some expectations. Certainly didn't meet my expectations on my first visit. Service was okay. Ambience was good, rather fancy.

¬†Also if you wanna have some snacks, that CHICKEN PLATTER which actually 3 small BABY BURGERS are there to tease your taste buds to reorder another one, and thats my friends called DAYLIGHT ROBBERY!!! (IN GOOD WAY).¬†

So if you went there and thought of trying and tasting, keeping your budget intact... You Silly friends!! Don't worry experience will teach you the lesson.

Wrapped up with Cheesecake ice-cream.
Among others the Hot chocolate , Shepherds Pie & coffee caramel custard are hugely popular.

One of the prettiest bakeries I've ever been to, this place calls for a visit every time you're in or around Southern Avenue. The quantish doorbell with the warmth of its tinkle, welcomes you into a fairy land of your dreams. The interiors - in pink, the chairs, tables, even the salt and pepper shakers - nothing plausibly seems to be a part of this world.
The cute little cupcakes are almost impossible to devour. They make you stop, stare, and think twice before popping such a piece of beauty into your mouth.
On practical considerations, one might find the place slightly overpriced. However, for the amount of indulgence it provides to your senses, perhaps it won't be much of a harm to spend that much.

Well, the exteriors and interiors are quite elaborate. Located in the heart of Hindusthan Park, at a walking distance from wise owl; this bakery has definitely won the heart of many.

I had few variety of cup cakes and a smoothie here. The smoothie was too sweet, the cup cakes were okish. I have heard great things about this place(especially cup cakes) from many, so maybe my expectations were too high. Hoping next time will be better. Cheers team Mrs. Magpie!

So this quaint little bakery marks my debut on Zomato!! I have been putting off writing reviews for the longest time due to my sheer laziness but this place deserves it.¬†

Located in Keyatala, it's quite easy to find (Google maps o the rescue :P). The first thing that struck me when I entered the place was how cute is it! Pretty pink walls, the smell of freshly baked cookies and bread and a cheerful assemblage of people. I went straight ahead for the dessert section and was delighted to see mini cupcakes that are perfect if you want to try a little of everything! We started off with the following cupcakes:
1)Nutty Praline
2)Cinnamon Apple
3) Mushy mushy and¬†
4)Cherry and cream cheese

I loved the almond praline as it tasted so so good and the cupcakes overall are a delight, with their cream cheese that melts in the mouth and the muffin that has a really subtle taste with different fillings inside. Amazing stuff. In addition, we had ordered some cold coffee, tea and light snacks like the veg quiche and the chicken puff/tart. Nicely baked.¬†
I also loved the overall ambience the place boasts of, wonderful presentation of the dishes and a very friendly staff. This will definitely be on my list, whenever I am in town. Great work guys :)

This not ao known location is one of the cafe that i can visit everytime one asks me. The location escapes me and i follow the google map so sorry on that. On entering the place you will be greeted inside a british themed cafe. The seating arrangments to the decor is just terrific and i mean terrific. Coming to the orders..you should try the tea..any variety will do and ofcourse the scones. These little things are just terrific. Made hot and served with butter and jam they are a must each. You can try the sorbets. Its kind of ice cream made without milk. So over and over again my point remain you should try this place if you are an ardent cafe visiter. Visot it and do let me know. Cheers. 
P.S will post the pics later..

It's a cute little place on a quite lane off southern avenue. A bit difficult to locate but as you reach, a wonderful window display welcomes you(pic attached) The decor is straight out of a story book, like a doll house dressed in pinks and peaches with cheery blossom adorning the walls. 
The cupcakes are 'the' speciality here and are a real treat for the children and the child in you. The variety is impressive - lemon, chocolate, gur, after 8ish or peanut butter, they have it all. The designs are cute and too real. You won't have the heart to eat them. 

In the savouries section, an aubergine tart was a real surprise. Flavoured with olives it was just the right accompaniment with my afternoon Darjeeling tea. The ginger cookie served with the tea was not overtly sweet and went well with the sugar less Darjeeling.  The cheese and harm slice and the chicken capsicum sandwich servedwith some chips were made well. I followed it up with another cup of tea. 

They have a tea time selection which comes with a pot of tea, choice of tiny cupcakes and some savouries. Next time when you intend to have some great tea with loads of conversation do drop into Mrs Magpie

The review of this bakery can be summed up in a single simple sentence- AN OVERPRICED SHIT OF A BAKERY. Their cupcakes and interior decor might look fancy but once you dig your teeth into those cakes/cupcakes you would want to rather donate your money to the poor than wasting it on Mrs. Whatever pie that is. The only thing good about this place is their fairytale decor but cafes and bakeries are opened to provide good food you know!

It's a very innovative place . The items are also intersecting. Sandwiches there okay types , the beverages are good and the cupcakes , tarts are good enough. Maybe from food point of view not the best  but obviously with such a lovely ambience and good company it's a good evening visit .

The d√©cor and the cakes add sweetness to your life. Everyday busy schedule can be shirked off being to this place atleast once a week. 
The cakes look delicately cute.

Mrs. Magpie is difficult to locate if one is not familiar with by lanes there. Google map is useful though. Its a small place but ambience is lively and lovely. The cupcakes are tasty and some are designed really cutely. There is a teddy or a butterfly or some animal. Its an attraction.point for the kids. Their packaging is also good. The food items are also nice here. Its little steep given the size of cupcakes that they r famous for....but taste wise worth it.

Can this place get any cuter?  
From decor to cup cakes everything is cutie cute about this place. 
Well coming to the order, we ordered one cheese cup cake and OMG it was so small and cute you just feel like taking it home with you and put you on the bed to sleep. 
Anyway. They tasted okayish. 
We also ordered cheesecake ice cream that was okayish too.

Located in the lanes of Southern Avenue this place is really a dessert heaven of sorts. You feel so warm and nice as you enter the place. The seating is decent and staff are polite.

We had a variety of their mini cupcakes and the one i really loved was nutty praline. After having so many cupcakes i needed something savoury so i ordered for their chicken quiche which was decent.

The boll was around 500 and is pretty decent for the order we placed. 

I have already revisited this place and you should too visit it if you havent.

The cappuccino is worth a try, the minty mohito is ok , but the cup of hot chocolate is sinfully delicious. The sandwiches are also good. Do try their chocolate brownie and the cute little cupcakes . They might seem a little exorbitant but worth trying. Good place with pretty decor to hangout with your friends or go for a date . :)

Mrs Magpie, a name that is pretty well known in the circuit. But today‚Äôs incident stands as a example of what transpires when success and fame get into your head.

We went there for a late breakfast today. The cafe at that moment just had two tables including ours. We placed an order for a grilled chicken salad, a continental breakfast and a cappuccino. 

After about 35 minutes, the continental breakfast arrived. The juice was missing. What surprises me is that the croissant, cinnamon roll are pre baked, hence, why did it take so much time? 

The first time ever I realised that 1 cappuccino takes 45 minutes to be dispensed from the machine. 

The fun was in watching the server, who was utterly dumbfounded, confusing orders between the two tables, when we sent it back, the lady in charge was reprimanding him for not knowing his work (it was audible!).

Then I ordered a cupcake for my friend because the salad was almost an hour late. When we asked about the sweet lime juice, they had forgotten about it and the lady in charge was heard shouting at the chef that please make a sweet lime juice.

Then came the salad, looking like a culinary disgrace, wilted rocket leaves, stale chicken, when we enquirer about the dressing, because it was not tasting right and my friend started feeling unwell after having a spoonful. The chef ran back to check the dressing. Mind you, the chef doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs cooking! He could be heard calling someone up and asking about the dressing he put in the salad. How startling is that! He told us that he is new and the chef is absent and he is the only one in charge, he doesn‚Äôt what much about the ingredients. 

We returned the salad, paid the cheque and left. My friend is unwell after consuming the salad and has nausea.

The owner should understand one thing, if you‚Äôre being appreciated, you need to hold that expectation and exceed it. Just because you‚Äôre an established brand does not give you the authority to make customers have such an unpalatable experience where the chef doesn‚Äôt even know the ingredients (to say the least), by the way, the cheque took 15 minutes too. The other table had already left because they were served a wrong order.

My favourite place for cupcakes and decoration on cupcakes are amazing. I love the look and feel of the place you feel you are lost in your childhood days. Oh and the place gives you such nice nostalgic feel that you are bound to love this place. I gift those cupcakes to my close friends and believe me it will leave them in aweeee! Only drawback too overpriced for the quantity served.

Located in the beautiful lanes of South Calcutta, in Southern Avenue, the first look from the outside will make you feel that you have landed in some countryside cafe in Europe. Was hearing about this place from a lot of people. We went there looking just for desserts. It was a pleasant surprise to find out that a lot of quick bites and beverages were available as well. We had two apple cinamon cup cake and coffee cup cake along with cheesecake ice cream. The ice cream was a let down, but the cupcakes were in a league of their own. I had also expected to find a lot of varieties of pastries, but that wasn't available. So if you are on the lookout for pastries, this is not place to be but if you want some gorgeous cupcakes, look no where else.

Went with 3 friends. Pretty bad service. Had to ask them three times before they finally got us water after 15 minutes. My friends had to ask for ketchup at least 5 times since the quantity given was so less. Not sure whether they were trying to save money on ketchup since most things on the menu were over priced. Lastly, they forgot to get my order. Would recommend them to start using pen and paper to note down orders since the server's are definitely not the brightest of the lot. Cupcakes were overhyped. The homemade ice-cream was pretty bad.

Mr's Magpie's Hot Chocolate has surely won many hearts, including mine. As much as I would like to rave about the delicious cupcakes and the fairy tale decor, this bakery cannot indulge the hearty eaters with it's minute servings of its stellar dishes. Still, this is one bakery that surely cannot be ignored simply because of the variety of its baked marvels. We tried the Hazel-Nutty Praline, the ChocoBerry and the Mango N Cheese Cream Cupcake - the last one being a new addition to Mr's Magpie's menu. All the cupcakes lived up to their names and much more. The Mutton Quiche was good and so was the¬† Chicken Ratatouille Tart, though quantity was less. The Chocolate shake was quite ordinary, nowhere close to the Hot Chocolate that I started my review with.

We were entered at 8:07pm. Nice decorate, Don't need to mention about their cupcakes,milkshake. I heard that their cupcakes are TOO GOOD, when I tasted it, it's never disappointed me or didn't broke my expectation. Nice place want to visit again, everyone said it's quite expensive but I mostly recomended that it's not expensive,it's reasonable.

Really pretty place. I visited during Christmas, and everything about the decor was so perfect. The ambiance was good and the service was also good but.. I GOT SOME FAKE CURRENCY NOTES AS CHANGE! Thought of coming back and complaining but doubted if it was them or some customer who had given it to them. But then the three ten rupee notes looked like brand new and there was not a single wrinkle on them, as if, they have just been taken out of a bundle. One note could be a mistake, but not three notes.

About their food.. I basically went there for the sweet bite. I loved their hot chocolate. It was dark, thick and smooth.. exactly the way I prefer! It was probably molten Bournville (I figured that later and tried making one at home and voila!). Their cupcakes look very pretty but are too overpriced. I loved the Frosted Cherry 'n' Cream cheese. The Marzipan marshmallow and nutty praline cupcakes were also good. The Raspberry Yogurt with Apricots was okay. The green apple ice cream was good but way too over priced. I didn't like their Vanilla Nutmeg Custard at all, had it to leave it out.

Their interiors are akin to retro styled English caf√©s they mention in books.. 'Beautiful' is too small a word to describe.¬†The cupcakes are cute. Got to try out a 'Rocky Road Brownie', which tasted amazing.. Dry and gooey at parts, it melts in your mouth.¬†

Rates are quite high, I'd say. While the food is tiny. Not worth the money, if you're hungry and want to calm your tummy down. Otherwise, worth a visit.

Ah! Cute little thing this coffee shop is. Nicely decorated and prim. Looks like something out of an Enid Blyton book. But sadly that is where it ends. Nice place if you want to pay good amount of money for small portions of food. Cupcakes look good but doesn't taste that good. The only saving grace is their hot chocolate and caramel custard which I believe is one of the best in the city.

There is more to this place than what meets the eye. The beautiful bench flanking a quiet street, in the quieter part of town, this place is an assault on your senses through more than just your taste buds. With the mild aroma of pastry baking, and display of what this place has to offer, you're immediately in the mood to just dive in. Their savoury food includes the classic pies and Quiches. But their servings are generous yet manages to keep you waiting more. Their sandwiches are moderate but desserts are definitely something to look froward to. Their liquor infused cupcakes packs a mild punch, and marzipan ones are really just pretty to look at. The d√©cor is subtle and frankly beautiful. For a casual evening tea to discuss the happening of the State or a sudden walking-in with your date; this place will accommodate your eccentricities.

Well I had heard rave reviews about this place but found it pretty overrated and overpriced. The cupcakes are cute and beautiful here but they are too small considering their size. The nutty praline marzipan was good. The best thing was the hot chocolate which us surely the best in entire kolkata..extremely chocolatey! Must try this one here at least.  The interiors and presentation get full marks.
We also had gingerbread cookies which were nice.

Well the visit was long due and the expectation was too high. Cute cafe type decor, nothing extraordinary. The cupcakes look amazing. Only 1 "mushy mushy" cupcake was available and the taste was nothing great. The other 3 varieties that we ordered tasted okay. The almond bun almost broke teeth. Tea was okay. The only thing that we liked was the sable cookie.

I was surprised to see that the cupcakes, cookies,etc were not marked with green/red dots. How on earth would somebody understand which of them were egg less! Anyway, on asking which of the cookies were egg less, I got to know that only 1 variety (choco chip cookies) was egg less. Pretty disappointing!¬†

Heard that their hot chocolate is great. Will try that next time. If at all I visit the place again.

Visited the place after a very long time, with same amount of expectation like before; but unfortunately didn't get to eat their special cupcakes due to some unavoidable circumstances which fine. But then the food i ended up to was really below the line of expection. There has been a remarkable drop in both quality and quantity ONLY ;).... So overall bad experience...

Value for money? No.
I'm not one of those persons who spends a lot of money on cupcakes and cookies and cute little stuffs which don't satiate my hunger pangs. After dinner, as dessert- justified.

But dinner comprising all these?not my cuppa.

Quality is good no doubt. Taste is also good but nothing extraordinary. Their mockatils- predominantly tastes of soft drinks. The cup cakes are way smaller than u can possibly imagine. I like their gur and chocolate cup cake. It is tiny as well. Ham quiche was good.

Quantity very very less. You get a lot of lip smacking dinner options in southern Avenue. I'd suggest have your dinner in one of those eateries and then come down here to have desserts. Otherwise you wont be able to appreciate the cutesy girly stuff going on here (with hunger kicking inside ur belly).

Last year on my birthday my boyfriend and I decided to pay a visit to this place since we were in the area and this place was on my wishlist for quite sometime. After a really tiring walk when we finally entered the place it seemed like we were transported into some fairy land. The decor of this place is marvelous. Starting from the jingling of the bell to notify about the arriving customer to the doll house that is set up inside the cafe, the cute little furniture, the colourful glass water bottles everything seems magical. Now coming to the food, we ordered cupcakes, chocolate pudding, a cold coffee and a chocolate milkshake. I must mention here that it was really difficult to choose from a variety of alluring cupcakes. Each of the cupcakes were delicious. What I liked most was that the icing of one of the cupcakes had a hint of peppermint. The chocolate milkshake was to die for but I did not quite the chocolate pudding. After we were done with the food they presented the bill in a very cute looking soft-toy container. We also bought a packet of iced cookies which were yet again absolutely delicious. Personally, I loved the place and I found it affordable too.

Funnily enough, my mother was the first person to introduce me to this place, long back, about a year ago, when it had not become a household name. My second encounter with Mrs. Magpie was at a food stall, where Mrs. Magpie were offering their tiny little cupcakes. A few days ago, my mother had brought home a handful of their cupcakes on my insistence. And now, I went back to the place after almost a year.

Decor:
The place scores high in this category. It has a lovely European feel to it with all the tainted glass, and beautiful wallpapers, and old English lamps adorning the place. Judging from the reviews, the pink paint may put off a few people, but with a good company, you can surely overlook it. You even have a blackboard with the Menu written on it, and even though the place is quite small, the tables and low-back chairs are neatly laid out, with some decorations here and there. The ambiance is soothing and apt for catching up with people over beverages and small tit-bits, unless you have a chattering group laughing too loudly (I was pretty pissed off on my last visit by a group of ladies).

Offerings:
Their cupcakes are now the talk of the town. The frostings are extremely innovative and "super cute" and the wide range of varieties offered add to their popularity. I have tried almost all of their cupcakes and would add a word or two on each:

1. Nutty Praline: This one is a chocolate cup cake with¬†shea butter icing and hazel nuts embedded in it, and a nutty paste that fills your mouth on a big bite. One of my favourites.

2. Cinnamon Apple: It has a vanilla base with a unique taste to it and feels a little spongy.

3. After Eight: This one has a chocolate base with chocolate frosting that has a mint flavour to it. 

4. Cointreau Liquer: This one is a pure chocolatey delight, with the subtle taste of alcohol.

5. Cherry 'n' Cream Cheese: This one tastes of pure cheese, and since am not particularly a cheese-lover, I am personally not very fond of it. It comes on a vanilla base, although the raspberry filling inside is a sweet surprise.

6. Marshmallow: This one looks super adorable, and it will pain you to have a dig into it. It is a little salty, which is typical of Marshmallows, but then again, it's beautiful.

7. Sweet 'n' Salty: This comes on a chocolate base, and is one of the most loved. However, I found it too sweet to my taste.

8. Peanut Butter: This comes on a chocolate base, and smells and tastes of pure and soft peanut butter curling up to tease your taste buds.

9. Marmy Vanilla: It has a vanilla base with vanilla frosting, and mango jam(I guess) filled inside. 

10. Lemony White Chocolate: This one tastes of lemon (naturally) and has a little lime paste inside the vanilla base. The sweet and sour mix is good, if not great.

The Marzipans, I feel are too sweet, and take away the real flavour of the cupcakes. So, I am not a big fan of those. But anybody wanting to dive into thickened sugar may have a dig at those.

Among the beverages, the Hot Chocolate stands out for the goodness of pure, molten, thick chocolate that you can sip alongside some snacks. Rarely have I seen a place offering Hot Chocolate in the real sense of the term, and not some Milo or Complan drink.

Among the other things offered, I have tried their Coffee Caramel Custard, Shepherd's Pie and Mutton Quiche. 

Coffee Caramel Custard: It is like the usual served, though caramel never fails to delight me. Since I had it as a take-away, and judging by the preference of this item among Zomato users, I might as well try it out again on my next visit.

Mutton Quiche: The size of the Quiche is small compared to the price. Otherwise, it is fluffy, and filled up with small mutton pieces, but it's forgettable.

Shepherd's Pie: This one too is pretty small compared to the price. And I didn't like it at all. Neither the taste of the mashed potatoes nor the beef stayed with me.

Overall, the prices are on the higher side compared to the size of the dishes. But then again, they don't charge an enormous amount of tax. If you're willing to have a quality time with your better half, or your girlfriends, this place is for you. As for me, am going back there again and again just for getting that 'Awww' feeling everytime they dish out a cupcake.

This is a place with a difference. The ambience, menu, taste and the people are a class apart. I ordered cold coffee, a brownie and a vanilla caramel custard ., each item tasted better that what is there in the national chains.. I fell in love with the place., so much of thought has gone into the decore. There was an aroma of fresh baking which rekindled the taste buds.. Only uneasiness was due to the pink colour which men are not used to. But we men must accept the female colours after all the girls don't feel awkward when they go to typical resturants and cafes in masculine decore. I strongly recommend this cafe to all those who are in love..

They serve the best hot chocolate I've ever tasted. Rich, thick and chocolaty, it's the perfect medicine to nurse yourself back to health.
The savouries are mediocre. The cupcakes are usually pretty tasty, but I've been served not so moist cupcakes once or twice.

It was rather a humorous reason why we went to this place. Being a dry day we had to satiate our inner spirits and bingo liquor cupckaes to the saviour and to be savoured. I am not much a fairytale fan but the interior was spick and span. Cupcakes are good though not out of the world.

We were attracted by the bright facade and the nice little waiting bench. On entering our feeling was 'fairy tale meets reality'. The amazing decor, the mix of traditional and modern furniture, artistic chairs,ceramic cake stands, cherry blossom wall papers made our day. The name refers to a group of birds, magpie, which are said to have the habit of collecting bright and nice things. On seeing the cute little cup cakes one can understand why the name is perfect for this place.
This time we tasted only the cup cakes which were amazing, particularly the cinnamon apple and nutty preline. We also had minty mojito which was OK. Will definitely visit it again.
Negetive points that I should mention are that the service is slow and pocket pinch is bit high.

Mrs Magpie is a beautiful little cafe which resembles a doll house! Everything is petite and perfect. I really love the decor! everything about the place is very charming and colourful. Right from the bell at the door to the tiny chairs to the colourful bottles, everything is pretty amazing. It is bound to lift your spirits.
The food is also very nice. All the dishes are of a high quality and the prices are not too high. I have tried the mutton quiche, ham and cheese quiche, Shepherds pie, club sandwich, chicken coronation sandwich and the chicken pot pie. And also a lot of their pretty little cupcakes. All the dishes are great. I won't say they're the best you're going to have but they're certainly the best if you're trying it all at one place. What I mean is that you're will surely find a better quiche somewhere else but then the same place mostly does not have the sandwiches of that high a quality. Or you are bound to get better sandwiches elsewhere (few places, not all) but then they may not offer pies. I hope you get the idea I am trying to share. Mrs Magpie is special because everything on the menu (atleast what I tried) is of a very good quality and has amazing flavours. Each dish could score well above 80 out of hundred but very few would cross 90.
Oh but yes, the salmon sandwich was a bit disappointing and also the coronation sandwich was less tasty compared to others (would score in 70).
The cupcakes though are splendid! Simply amazing. Loved all of them! They were all light and fluffy and the decorations were of top notch quality!
This place is definitely a must try for all. You are definitely going to leave with a smile (and perhaps lots of photos too!)

Despite the obvious cuteness, there's a genuine sense of warmth in this place and this is what makes it a winner. Since it's off the main road that makes it a generally quiet - perfect if you want to sit and work (the wi-fi is usually good). Must-haves, in no particular order: Ham and Cheese Quiche, Hot Chocolate, Salted Caramel Cupcake, and the range of Cheese Omelettes.

This is a cute Tea house and wide variety of cupcakes and assorted sandwiches. Loved the wide assortment of cakes/pastries - each one was delicious. Also tried the coffee caramel pudding and would go back many more times just for that. The spread is large along with Tea- very pleasant environment. The hot chocolate is really amazing though heavy. The cupcakes are fascinating and most of the combinations work really well. They also have a wide selection of cookies to carry home. Definitely worth a visit.

Chicken Ratatouille Tart, Mutton empanada are amongst those savouries which I never tried before, Mrs. Magpie offers European cuisine (mostly) and she just nailed it :) I tried Cream Tea awww... all the pictures I took for my own Blog "WhenWeEat" but as they are quite alluring and I have no qualms in uploading them here. I would love to visit every year Mrs. Magpie, you're an awesom host :D Enjoy Europe :D

Liked the decor and the cleanliness. However, the quantities are quite small. Their Omelettes were outstanding in taste, as was their bread. But their mojito, and their sliders were quite ordinary. Their quiche was good but pathetically small for the price they charged. A word of praise for their service - it was really good despite the amount of time taken for service.

Mrs. Magpie was disappointing. It's a packed, crowded confectionary shop that definitely doesn't have enough space or seats for it's customers. You come by this place a little late, you're damned outside the caf√© on a bench for half an hour.

I don't see what is the big fuss about the food here. The cupcakes that we ordered tasted like cough syrup. Their beverages are still okay. Nothing special.

Mrs. Magpie is pretty and decorated with overly famine accents. It almost looks like a doll house. Service here is a tad bit slow, and honestly so are the waiters. These are harsh words, but I'm only writing them down because the staff there did our bill wrong.

Mrs. Magpie has a wide assortment of cupcakes among other delicacies which is their main attraction. This small pretty eatery charges a high premium so don't be surprised if a visit may burn a hole in your pockets. But having said that the food is so delicious that every bite you take will be an 'aha!' moment. We had ordered Mini Marzipan 'After Eight' and 'Marshmallow' cupcakes. The topping on the After Eight tasted a bit like toothpaste so I didn't like that but the Marshmellow just won over my taste buds. Their Shepard Pie was smaller than I had expected. Also a few layers were missing which are supposed to be present in a traditional Shepard Pie but they tasted good nonetheless. Their 'Baked Fish Pie' was sensational. We were spellbound by this preparation. 
So, if you are looking to have a sumptuous meal within a budget, this is not the place you should be looking for but if you want to excite your taste buds, you have found the perfect cafe. 
Staffs are very cordial and they also help you to order the food.
One cannot possibly have any complaints about the ambience of the place. The decors, interiors and seatimg arrangements are so pretty that I will make you fall in love with the place. 
Food: 4/5
Ambience: 5/5
Service: 5/5
There are very few tables so if you are going there in the evening, you might have to wait for a few minutes.
Pretty place with delicious delicacies! Will be back for sure. :)

The sweet name of the place reveals a lot about it. A sweet place serving cupcakes to the sweet tooths. Mrs. Magpie has got everything that a quintessential girl like . A nicely decor with everything almost pink in color, very nice looking cupcakes and soothing ambience. Undoubtedly the cupcakes tasted nice but is overpriced. A typical 'girlie' place (Alhough I hate stereotyping things). This place is over hyped and overpriced and you can gulp a pie in just two bites. You surely come here once but this definitely is not an adda place or a coffee shop where you can laze around. 

Experience cupcakes and coffee in a classy place.

Not trying to be sexist, but this more of a place for girlish hangouts and their fun times rather than some extraordinary food paradise! They are more famous for their cupcakes, but unfortunately for me, cupcakes do not interest me much and I do not find reason in paying such huge amounts for small minuscule structures which wouldn't even fill the appetite of a mice!¬†

Speaking of the location, just take the lane opopsite to Basanti Devi College, walk past Indthalia and Azad Hind. Open up your Google map and you shouldn't have any problem locating this place. The ambiance is cute and vibrant, the walls looks good, and the sitting arrangement is decent. Infront of you would be tiny little cupcakes and some minute sized patty. They do have an elaborate menu, but all of them would cater to small eateries. I decided to go for Chicken Pot Pie and a Strawberry Shake for dine-in. The Pot Pie appeared to be an exact replica of Chicken Parcel served by Kathleen. The Shake was decent, but the glass became empty faster than I could blink my eyes. The quantity served was pretty less.

For take-away, I decided to go for Ham and Chicken Quiche and Shepherd's pie! The Quiche was delectable, probably the only stuff justifying its price. The pie was average. Nothing extraordinary.¬†

In a nutshell, this place is just an upgraded version of Cookie Jar/Cakes. Although, I wouldn't dissuade anyone from trying this out. Perhaps, one day, someone could convince me to really like what's going on here!

Designed like a cutesy Parisian cafe it has the girly charm working for it. The husband has refused to walk into it so a good place to catch up with your girly girl gang . love the tiny cake stands they serve their combo cup cakes in.  Everything is high on design even the cupcakes though taste wise isn't particularly innovative. Way too much marzipan. Try the cake pops in the shape of animals. Excellent as back presents on kiddy birthday parties.

I wonder why I haven't ever rated this place! 
The best place for amazing cupcakes, coffee, hot chocolates and sandwiches
This cozy, cute cafe resides in the sleepy neighborhood of southern avenue ( near keytalla road)

The decor is worth mentioning, with a burst of chociestest pastels, cute motifs, floral interiors, rugged tables, taking you inside a story book :)

I have in my many visits tried the cupcakes( nutty praline, red velvet, marshmellow), the hot chocolate (divine and the best) 
The sandwiches are amazing! Worth mentioning are the veg club( recommended), the sliders and mushroom on toast.
The cheese snones are delicious too!

A must visit place for all!

Visited Mrs. Magpie recently. It's a quaint little cafe in Southern avenue, a sort of a dreamy place for girls to meet up and spend hours lost in conversations. I, however went with my  partner-in-crime, for a lazy weekday breakfast. We ordered a chicken salad sandwich, an omelette with bell peppers and mushrooms and two glasses of fresh watermelon juice.
To start with, they take an immense amount of time (20-25 mins) to serve the food which gets pardoned as soon as the food arrives. The food my friend is another story, the sandwich was fantastic. The chicken and salad was fresh and the brown bread had just the right amount of softness. The omelette, well call me biased but it's one of the best I have tried in this city. It really was something. The smell, the gooey factor everything still makes my mouth water as I think about it. 
Well, the only sad part was the watermelon juice. I was lucky enough to get the sweet juice but my poor husband landed up getting a completely tasteless glass of juice. Funny thing... But my only request to the people at Mrs. Magpie is please do work out these little kinks in your services and you could very well be the best little breakfast place in this part of town :)

We came here for Mrs Magpie afternoon tea one Friday afternoon. The caf√© was full so we had to wait outside for 15mins. There aren't many tables so be prepared to wait. The mini cupcakes were very rich and tasty, each with their own unique, creative flavour. The cream and jam condiments made up for the dry scones ( served warm which was a nice touch) and the coronation chicken sandwiches were nice. A pot of Darjeeling tea complimented the afternoon tea as well as an assortment of biscuits. The highlight for me was the lemon loaf- amazing! We also had a chicken and cheddar toastie, served with lightly salted crisps, a lovely touch. The cafe itself is cute and quaint and the presentation of the food was exceptional. Afternoon tea is perfect for a sweet tooth and enough for 2, perfect for a girly catch up or date with your other half.

A beautiful place to visit. One of the best cafes I have ever visited. I believe they have the best cup cakes. I just could not get over the large frosted nutty pralines!! People residing near Hindusthan park must visit this place. Highly recommended.

This is going to be my first ever long review for any cafe or restaurant. Well, I'm trying my best to explain as much detailed as I can in this review.
Location : I went there taking the help of google maps. It's not too far from Golpark crossing or even Vivekananda Park.

Decoration : The shop is always beautifully dressed in sweet pinkish colour, like a garment wear. Once you look at it from outside, even if you were not to get inside YOU WILL. Kids will be very much attracted towards the shop because of it's looks. There is a bench outside the shop which can be used for waiting or any other purpose. The staffs or the security guard do not object to it. Once you enter the shop you will notice it isn't too big, but very cute in nature. Wall decorations and sitting arrangements will cheer you up. A soothing place in one word.

Food : The food was really really really good. I went there 3 times but had taken away 2 times. First time I went there and I had Chicken Pot Pie which was good. It wasn't spicy, honestly speaking you don't get anything SPICY there. They serve maximum cakes and cookies which are obviously sweet to taste and less number of fast food. Along with the pot pie, I also ordered for Marshmallow cupcake which didn't really suit my taste buds. This mini cupcakes cost 40 rupees, but this particular one was not worth having according to me. This time I also ordered for one Sweet and Salty cupcake which was good enough. People who like the mixture of sugar and salt will love it. If you don't know the flavour then give it a try! Second time I went there to buy some Caramel and Nutty cupcakes for my friend who said those were very good to taste. The third time I went there I took some small cake loafs for midnight hunger! Those were the best I guess. Oh yes, the loafs were chocolate flavoured.
This place maybe a little costly but it's good. I hope my first ever long and detailed review could clear everything out to the readers. :)

Located near Hindustan park and southern avenue. This is a place with superb ambience. One of those perfect places to catch up with your old friends. But why would anyone pay 100‚Çπ for a small amount of pot pie or quiche which is not even extremely delicious? The foods are not at par with the price. But the atmosphere makes up for it to some extent

I guess there is nothing much to write home about this place as a lot have been written already.  It is a 'cute' place offering savouries and the signature cupcakes. The hot chocolate is worth mentioning along with their 'salmon sandwich' though they do not have a proper kitchen hence the choices would be limited. The servers are polite but lacks communication skill and one serious bummer is that they do not have any working wifi ' inspite of boasting a 'free wifi' which is rather disgusting as one needs to access official stuff while sipping something. I would urge them to address this issue first. Perhaps the menu needs an upgrade as well. Thank you for having me...

We went there at evening, location of the outlet is not great, hard to find but thanks to google map we found it. Coming to deco and ambiance, both were very good. Ordered a cupcake, strawberry shake, caramel coffee custard and rustic Chicken Sandwich. Taste were superb and service was too fast. Really enjoyed mrs. Magpie.

Will visit again definitely.

After a leisure afternoon stroll by the lake when we found ourselves hungry again... We decided to go to Mrs. Magpie... Mrs. Magpie is located at Lake Terrace Road, Southern Avenue(15 minutes walk from Lake). But in afternoon this place becomes very crowded... Thus we had to wait for 10-15 minutes to get a table!
The decor is attractive ... the wall paintings, the cookie shelf and design of the tables all increase the attraction...
We ordered
2 Cupcakes - Cointreau Liqueur and
Marsmallow Marzipan.
Assorted Non Veg Slider(Platter)
Baked Fish Pie
Minty Mojito

Cupcakes were lip smacking... specially the chocolaty ones...
In non veg platter there were 2 mini Mutton Burgers, 1 mini Chicken Burger and chips... taste of the burgers was really good...
Fish Pie was the best I had there... it was a thick creamy pie with baked fish...
Minty Mojito was ok and had a refreshing taste in it...
The service was also good... Overall a perfect place for gossiping with friends with scrumptious foods...
#A Must try for its cute cupcakes and pies...

A cute little place with pink walls and tiny tables is any little girl's dream tea party venue. Mrs Magpie is just that. The interior is adorable, right out of a dream sequence. Coming to the food, I love the shepherd's pie here along with the cold coffee. The mini cupcakes are a delight to see as well as eat. :p not a dining place per say but one should go there to chill with friends in a cozy place with tea and munchies for company.

Food :Cupcakes were good, especially cinnamon apple and sweet n salt caramel ones. Pineapple up side down was soft and light, but i missed sugar in it. Veg platter had 3 burgers. though it was good, they were quite small. Darjeeling tea would be my choice.Ambience: nice, gave me a feeling of a small french cafe.Service: they were quick and polite.

It's not the easiest to locate but definitely impossible to miss! Decked in pink, Mrs. Magpie is a cute cafe popular for its cupcakes. We had a Grilled Chicken and Cheddar Sandwich (‚Çπ150) with extra bacon. It was simple, served with a lovely relish. The bacon was cooked to perfection, soft at the centre, crunchy on the edges. The Lemon Iced Tea (‚Çπ65) was decent. Coming to the cupcakes, we tried a variety, only one stuck out for me: the Sweet N Salty (‚Çπ45 for mini). They looked adorable.

Okay! So I visited this amazing little cafe with my aunt yesterday! This cafe is located in lake terrace road extension.. the direction is a little tricky though... but in short I loved the cafe..
The interior was amazingly cute and pink.. we ordered two cups of cafe latte..
One cup was completely cold though. . But when I told them to warm it up they agreed without making a fuss.. well, the cup cakes were a yum.. we ordered a chocolate one and the nutty praline cupcake. Then we tried the ham and cheese quiche and the shepherd's pie which were delicious too...
So in short this is a very cozy and cool cafe in lake terrace with amazing food..

All I have to say is, people who have had hot chocolate in the name of hot chocolate from al the places in Calcutta probably drank mylo or cocoa milk.... If you ever happen to visit Mrs. magpie, try out their hot chocolate to believe what I am trying say... They make the best... It's thick and its actually chocolate... And ofcourse their cup cakes... It's very tasty... The decor of the place is very good too, very girlie though...service is good...music is good...i'v got no complains about this place....

Love their cupcakes to the t. They taste as good as they look. They were one of the first ones to popularize dainty little cupcakes so popular in Kolkata.
However, their sandwiches are small, dry and sad. Other savoury options, like the quiche, are good but almost bite-sized.
Also, their coffee caramel custard is the ultimate comfort food. And their display window is straight out of a fantasy movie.

Mrs. Magpie is one of my favourite cafes in Kolkata. A quaint little place, it has a cute and cosy decor, and is perfect for those days when you wish to catch up with your friends over cups of coffee and cupcakes. The place has a laid-back yet cheerful ambience, and the interiors are sure to lift up your mood.

Over my many visits, I have had quite a few items here, and they are mostly delicious. Their frosted cupcakes are really good, and their frosted Nutty Praline is a cupcake made in heaven. The touch of salt brought by the salty caramel inside is what makes this cupcake the delight it is. Their Hot Chocolate is hands down the best in town. Unlike other places where I usually find the hot chocolate tasting like a cup of milo, Mrs. Magpie's version is a cup full of sinful thick and dark chocolate, which tastes even better on a winter evening. The coffee they serve is good too, and their Chicken Pot Pie is another favourite of mine. The savouries they serve are majorly tit-bits that go really well with tea/coffee and loads of conversations.

My most recent visit with T was on 23rd December, 2015, and we had gone especially to try out their Christmas Special Afternoon Tea. Since I am not a tea person, we asked the waiters whether they could change the tea to coffee, which they happily did. The Christmas Special Afternoon *Coffee* thus contained slices of Date and Walnut Cake, Stollen and Cointreau Chocolate Mincemeat Cake, 2 Cranberry White Chocolate Scones with butter and jam on the side, 2x2 finger sandwiches with the two options of Turkey with Cranberry Chutney and Roast Mutton with Mint Chutney in the non-vegetarian version, and two cups of Cappuccino (the original tea version has a big pot of Darjeeling/Assam/Green tea instead of coffee). All the items were good, with our favourites being the Stollen and the Scones. The cafe was also very beautifully decorated for Christmas, with the display window being one of its major attractions.

All their prices are inclusive of VAT. They just charge a Service Tax of 5.6%, which makes it pocket friendly as well.

Mrs. Magpie is a really special place for me, especially because it is our usual go-to place whenever T and I have major things to talk and discuss about, and the lure of deliciously baked goodies does help the cause too ;) :)

P.S. - I love the bottles they use to serve water :)

Dropped by on a Sunday evening. Had to wait for 10 minutes. But the wait was worth it. Ordered the Mutton Goulash, some quiches, brownies and coffee. At first glance, I felt that the quantity would not be enough to suffice. But after belting through half of the food, we were already full. Everything we ordered was fresh and delicious. The ambiance is chic and I would recommend this place to anyone looking for options for a date in South Kolkata.

This place is too small ..the chairs are too small like it's designed only for children. The service is pathetic I tot it was self service when I came in. The waiter refused me two slices of bread . He said he cannot give me two slices of bread . The breakfast meal we ordered the egg  wasn't up 2 my standard. The toast was hard like rock. Maybe m in a bad mood or maybe I just was refused two slices of bread . Will never recommend anyone to come to this place ever. I've been to many places for breakfast and this is the worst place ever.

What better way to spend a wintery evening rather than desserts and some more desserts. For people with a sweet tooth, make sure this moves up your list of cafes lined up for next visit. As the name suggests, land up in Mrs. Magpie to spoil yourself with unconventional savouries and yummy cupcakes. The place looks all cute and girlie with cupcake miniatures and baby pink walls , but there is a lot more to it. Also if my companion

Probably the best in the business of cupcakes in town as I had a super good experience when I visited this very colourful and wonderful ambience place to sip on some nice mocha coffee and for the sweet indulgence I had taken three varieties of cupcakes among which one was hazelnut which I remember very well among all the other ones , now coming to snacking I had ordered a nice mutton sandwich which just blew my head away with its fillings and taste accompanied with some wafers , and to end it all I have to say my visit to Mrs magpie was Indeed a worth to cherish .

The decor (for the outlet on Lake Terrace Road) works in its favor - very well put together and demands that the patrons indulge. We had the Hazelnut(ty) Praline, Marshmallow-n-chocolate cupcakes; the lemon meringue and the mutton quiche. The mini cupcakes were lovely and the lemon curd was spot-on. The mutton quiche, though presented warm, lacked body and flavor. That was the only downside to an otherwise lovely afternoon stroll down Southern Avenue.

The restaurant is essentially an enclosed box and keeping the entire HVAC system switched off when the restaurant is full is really not advised. I wonder why the management instructs the staff to do such a thing. Too many people breathing into an enclosed system with no air circulation makes for a very stuffy situation. The other bit which requires attention is that the staff need to be aware of the situation at the table - requiring to ask for bill, following up on the order etc is really irksome.

My best friend and I walked down from our place to Mrs Magpie on new year's eve. This restaurant had been on my wishlist since quite some time due to the reviews it had received on zomato... And trust me I wasn't disappointed!
We ordered for two small cupcakes.. Peanut butter and Cointreau. While one was full of thick and creamy peanut butter the other was chocolaty with a hint of liquor in it. Both were 'Yum'!!! My only complain.. The 'small' size is actually so 'small' that the cakes disappear even before you say 'c'! ;-). The grilled sandwiches were good and so was the coffee. 
The place had a Christmassy feel to it and yes the renowned 'Pink interiors' definitely adds on to the charm! 
A wonderful experience ... Would love to visit again!

Tiny little bakery tucked into a corner in Southern Avenue. The decorations and arrangements catch your eye as soon as you enter, with pink walls and cute furniture. The ambience is also very pleasant, like that of European bakeries seen in movies, with soft jazz or blues playing in the background. The staff is warm and well mannered. 
Finally coming to the food. The menu is extensive for a bakery. And all the items are finger licking good. We ordered hot chocolate, ham and cheese quiche, chicken n cheese puff, and two beautiful little cupcakes, mushi mushi and cream cheese and cherry, which were almost too pretty to eat. The hot chocolate was the highlight for me. It was the best hot chocolate I've had till date. 
Thumbs up to the staff and management. Looking forward to visit again.

I visited this place today.

Located in Southern Avenue, you need to follow zomato location in order to find the place.
Its a small patisserie type outlet.
We had to wait quite sometime for getting seated.

Inside there are cute tables, some nice girly decor and a counter displaying the cakes and stuff.

We ordered- cherry and cheese cream cupcake and cinnamon apple cupcake. The sizes of the cupcakes are pitiful. I mean, you just nibble at it and its finished. Both tasted good though.
We ordered a cafe mocha, a darjeeling tea and a chicken platter which had 3 mini burgers with some potato chips. Burgers were okay. Nothing very delicious.
My major complaint- the slow service. I realised why people need to wait outside for long. Thats because people dont serve the guests inside on time. We waited for 10 minutes for the menu. The tea and coffee took 20 minutes to arrive. And we actually followed up for getting the bill.
People wont have to wait outside if the wait staff get more hands on and prompt.
Bdw, there was an accident too. All of a sudden a light bulb above another table gave out smoke and burst into glass pieces on the guests seated below.
Overall experience- not so good
Shall i go there again? Mostly no.

Mrs. Magpie, located in the posh area of Southern Avenue, is one of the best place to hangout with friends and spend hours gossiping over coffee. It was few days ago when on a fine evening, I along with my friends visited this place to spend some time together. The things we ordered here were Baked Fish Pie, Hot Chocolate, Chicken 'n' Cheddar Puff, Walnut Brownie and one of it's famous cupcake Mini Froasted 40 all of which tasted good. Although the Hot Chocolate was quite regular with no extra or new flavours. What took my heart were the cupcakes for which this place is famous for. Overall, i'll give it 4 stars.

Okay that's it I'm in love. Mrs. Magpie is never not cute. Since my last visit they have added some more cupcakes to the menu (well they aren't technically on the menu yet, you have to go to counter to see the new additions) and they are pretty awesome.
We had cinnamon apple, lemon meringue, lemony white chocolate, marshmallow, mushimushi, irish coffee and chocolate gur cupcakes. These were followed by hot chocolates, a shepherd's pie, a chicken 'n' cheddar puff and a chicken pot pie.
It is almost impossible to eat the cupcakes because of the cuteness overload, but we got around to it.
My two favourites were the Irish coffee and the chocolate gur, which are two of the newly introduced flavours. The Irish coffee has a very strong coffee flavoured topping as well as coffee core at the bottom, the chocolate gur has, as the name suggests, a nolengur topping. The lemon meringue tasted like a lemon tart (how else would it taste?) and the marshmallow's marshmallow topping was deliciously soft and gooey. And of course mushimushi has to be a dark chocolate lover's delight.
The hot chocolate drinks need no description. They were as perfect as ever.
Out of the three savouries the chicken pot pie was probably the best choice.
I wish I could come back over and over again. Please open a cute little branch somewhere near Salt Lake! Annesha Mandal Bratin Maity Arunabho Som

Brownies. Marshmallows. Cookies. Cakes. Pastries. So much love and sugar. Mrs Magpie knows how and what Makes any sweet lover droll. Even non sweet lovers like me. When I checked the menu I was thinking how can someone have so much sweet and sugar. Too much goodness. But after trying the Marshmallows and walnut brownies, all i knew was that I am going to come back for more to this place. The ambience? Well looks like movie kinda bakery shop. And the cakes on display. Voil√†! We also had Cappuccino and Darjeeling Tea. You can check the pictures yourself.
Going to come back here for more and more of those tasty sugar devils. And going to recommend it to anyone I meet.

The place has a great decor and ambience. The desserts are not that great. When we had checked in, there was nothing for vegetarians, and the staff was rude. Won't go a second time.

The cutest and most delicious cupcakes ever! Also the d√©cor is adorable! It's a tad bit difficult to get a table during winter festivities but they have this cute little bench and pretty lights outside that do make up for it! Also I love the little baskets in which they give the bill! It's perfect for a nice date!

One of my most favourite hangout places in the city. Beautifully decorated soothing ambience you get here in this small outlet. Awesome cakes they make, try absolutely anything here and you'll feel satisfied. No wonder it has become the favourite cafe for so many people in such short time. This place is a must visit.

Well this is the first time I have rated a place as a perfect 5! And this place completely deserves it. This is a must visit for all those whose sweet tooth is very active. I would have struggled to find this place if the GPS navigation had stopped for some reason.
I started with the variety of cup cakes on offer. All of which was simply amazing. Then it was the puff that just melts in your mouth. And how can I not mention the Hot Chocolate! Yummy! Reasonably priced. This place is a must visit!!

Mrs Magpie is the place to be for satisfying your sweet tooth... Speciality: Delicious Cupcakes
Found this cute little place near golpark crossing.. It's one of those places which truly define the word "Bakery".. First thing that strikes you is the decor inside, it's bright pink and lovable. It was a delight to dig into some delicious cupcakes combined with engaging sandwiches.. Nutty praline cupcake turned out to be our favorite..

You love Christmas, cakes, but not the park street crowd?
Then Mrs. Magpie is the perfect corner for you to hangout with your friends and family on Christmas.
On the Christmas eve I went there with a friend and I really loved the pastel pink decor and all the glittery christmasy feeling. It was really warm inside.
I am yet to try their varieties of cupcakes and sweet things.
I had just an espresso and a rich chocolate regular (couldn't decide what cake to have).
I was bit reluctant to visit the place as the place is what you can call a little girl's dream bedroom, but everything has its first time.
Will be visiting soon to have some of their delicacies.

I've always been attracted to this quaint little place in Southern Avenue and so one day, I gave in to this desire of mine to actually enter this wonderland. I along with four of my friends went for a little snack to this place a few days back.
The d√©cor is extremely pretty! Right from the entrance door, to the furnitures inside, the cakes on display and even the bathroom door is beautiful! This is for the photoholics out there - this place is extremely camera-friendly!¬†Now coming to the food - we ordered Chicken 'n Cheddar Puff, Shepherd's Pie, Ham 'n Cheese Quiche, Chicken Slider, Coffee Caramel Custard and Marshmallow Mini Marzipan Cupcake!
Chicken 'n Cheddar Puff : Good to eat, however the puff was more than the chicken. But that's how puffs work in most cases, I guess.

Shepherd's Pie : We were shocked to see its size to be honest, we were expecting some thing a little bigger. Anyway, it tasted good, can't complain.

Ham 'n Cheese Quiche : This was again, a small sliver, but tasted really really good! The ham 'n cheese complemented each other really well.

Chicken Slider : We were at first confused as to what it exactly is, then we were told it's a collection of small burgers. The dish consisted of 3 small burgers with potato chips on the side. The burgers were your regular chicken burgers, only smaller in size. Kind of cute, actually.

Coffee Caramel Custard : This was absolutely delicious! The star of the platter - undoubtedly! The coffee and caramel made the custard so savoury, I could have had 10 plates, easily!¬†

Marshmallow Mini Marzipan Cupcake : If I'm in Mrs. Magpie, I'd obviously have to order cupcakes! I'm not really a fan of cupcakes, but THEY LOOKED SO FREAKING CUTE! I actually ordered one because I wanted a picture of how cute they are. Ultra small in size, they look super adorable! Taste wise, nothing special, but for this tiny beauty, the looks steal the show.

All in all, a beautiful, photogenic place to hang out. A little over priced and the quantity is less. But you'll click some amazing pictures! If you're a custard lover, do not forget to try the Coffee Caramel Custard!

Visited Mrs. Magpie with a lot of expectations and my God, did they live up to it and how? The ambience is nice, cozy and gives a warm feeling. The service is responsive and fast. Coming to the food, they were surely pocket sized powerhouses. The coffee caramel custard was soft,  tender, melt in your mouth with a little hint of creme brulee' texture. The triple choc brownie was nothing extraordinary yet delicate. The nutty praline cupcake was a miniature bomb exploding in your mouth and the chicken n cheese cheddar s/w with coleslaw was simple yet elegant. The cappucino was spot on and better than the coffee served up in other places. However, the show stopper was the sheperds pie. The pint sized English extravaganza loaded with mutton was an absolute lipsmacker. The dough was baked well,  and the hint of oregano made us go for more. All in all,  one of the best bistroesque cafes in Calcutta. With

Very glad to see someone re-introducing the concept of afternoon tea in modern day Kolkata. Anybody who is looking for bite sized portions in the form of 'chai-nashta' preferably in the morning or the evening should be delighted to visit this place. Absolutely love the attention to detail both in terms of food and decor. Even though the cupcakes are amazing do try some finger sandwiches along with your cup of Darjeeling the next time you go.

Visited this place on Wednesday...After a long walk and waiting line we got in. This place is just adorable and cute to the power infinity. The pink n peach decor and little chairs will take you back to ur childhood days. A nice place to hangout for a girl time or girl get together. I had the cherry & cream cheese cupcake which was absolutely delicious to melt in mouth. Fresh and the sweetness was moderate in the cupcake so I enjoyed it a lot. It was really a different taste from other bakeries. Cafe latte was nothing exceptional but the way it was served or@rh garnished was pleasurable. Plus they give u brown sugar to add to it unlike other places where normal sugar is used (plus point as it is a healthy approach). Jaydip who gave us the servic was really good as well.

A very sweet place to have a chit chat and have some very delicious cakes. But. For having the chit chat i was made to stand 1 hour. Thats where my whole excitement ended. Not much big space. And even teo people occupy the space of atleast 8 people. Price is okayish. I would rather say over priced. Dont know why is it in romantic choices of zomato. Cause it should be student hangout. As its overpopulated. Anyways. Food quality and ambience is good.

So after lunch. I came here because I saw so many good reviews about magpie.
But let me tell you all.
Mrs magpie is a not at all good when it comes to bakery.
The place is so cosy.
Not a good environment. 
And not a nice seating too.
I didn't enjoy at all.
Ordered  5 different cupcakes
And it was so horrible.
A total waste of money.
Marshmallow was quite better than rest of the cupcakes.
I would reckon not to go to this place.
Its  a total waste.

Creative and Innovative--yes that's how I would like to describe this place..this quaint little joint located close to keyatala road near Golpark has been doing wonder with deserts and cakes and have taken us back on a nostalgia ride to our childhood.. Looking at their cupcakes and pastries it seemed to be a fine work of art,like a painter using his brush to capture the imagination..Its not just about what you eat but how you present and how feel that equally matters when you visit this cafe.. Coming to the ambience this place is not that big, but what readily catches your eyes as soon as enter is the assortment of colors..Its like visiting a ToyLand..From the cakes in display in the windows to the bright decor, the colorful bottles in which water is served to the little box in which the bill comes, just one word to describe this place-CUTE..The servers are also quite helpful and well behaved as well..Service is prompt and efficient..Coming to the food this place has carved a name of its own through its wide and innovative array of Cupcakes..Though their savouries and other deserts are equally delectable it is their cupcakes which earned their USP..Since we went on a lazy evening decided to try out only their cupcakes and deserts..We ordered:
Baileys and Mushi Mushi Cup Cakes: They even exceeded my expectations..the cakes were fresh, soft and flavourful..loved the frosting and the essence of butter..beautifully presented as well..
Coffee Caramel Custard: Easily one of the best versions I have tasted in Kolkata..it was balanced in flavours..not overly sweet and the sauce based on coffee flavour was so smooth and silky..loved the texture..Passionately Recommended..
Raspberry Yogurt with Apricot: Quite tastefull..the yogurt was thick and creamy, sweetness balanced with slightly acidic flavour making it a delightful dish..Also loved the presentation in a cute glass jar with the sweet jelly on top..
Overall this is one such place which will make your dull day happy..there isn't anything extravagant about this place but you will get that warmth and joy which will bring you back here again and again..Overall our total cheque comes to just Rs.240/- for all these stuffs..Not at all a costly affair..
Food: 4/5
Price: 4.5/5
Service: 4/5
Ambiance: 4/5

i chanced upon this place upon my friends recommendation, and it turned out to be one of the best confectionery in Kolkata i have ever tasted. Its seems like the decor of the place has been greatly inspired by Mad Hatters Tea Party and was also cozy. the cupcakes was lined up for everyone's display and looked quite tempting. I had accompanied my parents to this place and had to make subtle choices.we ordered chicken pot pie, coronation chicken and pesto chicken sandwich , cappuccino, espresso and mini hot chocolate (beverages). ¬†chicken pot pie was perfectly cooked and coronation chicken was quite light and tasty. pesto chicken was also good and went well with the cappuccino. Mini hot chocolate was worth drooling for and it made me forget all the calorie consumption it contains, we followed our appetite with mini cupcakes like marmy vanilla and lemony white. the cupcakes were light, compact and ¬†perfectly presented . Overall, this place is good and also offers takeaway. service was good also.@

Went for some snacks and coffee today in the morning. The decor was cosy with impressions that the owner must have seen lots of foreign shops as that has been reflected by the board where dishes of the day are maintained. The food is quite tasty, but the size or quantity is quite less. So this is a pricey place but with tasty, quality food. Cost for some snacks and coffee for 2 persons was around Rs 620.00 inclusive of taxes. Attaching a few pictures of the food :-)

Seriously apart from the decor i dint find anything good about this place. Overpriced and undertaste are the two words that qualify to describe the food at this place. Although the last one is made up word :P . I wonder how this place has got so high rating. Well now i can say this place is overrated

After months of planning , I finally got a chance to visit this place.
At the very entrance, the decor gave off an aura of cuteness, which only magnified when we were seated. The interiors are painted in shades of mainly pink and orange, and the cushions on the sofas have bright, printed covers. There are low chairs to sit on, the windows are colourful and the bottles of water are disguised as bright and sparkly bottles of liquor. In short, the atmosphere is very romantic and is basically a bigger version of our favourite Wendy house from childhood.
Finally, the food - we checked the menu, and liking the sound of everything in it, we ordered a huge variety of things, much more than our group of three could actually manage :)
The cupcakes were very pretty, and caught our eyes at once. We weren't disappointed, for they tasted just as good as they looked. We ordered nutty praline, after eight (chocolate and mint), peanut butter, and sweet and salty chocolate cupcakes. We also ordered blackcurrant scones, which were served with helpings of jam and butter.
Next arrived the sandwiches. We ordered salmon finger, chicken club, and roasted mutton sandwiches. The salmon ones were really good, but we didn't like the excessively cheesy chicken club sandwiches ; as for the roasted mutton ones, we felt they were a tad too dry.
Among the savouries section, we ordered a chicken pot pie, mutton quiche, baked fish pie , mutton goulash, and ham and cheese quiche. All of these were good, but special mention must be given to the baked fish pie and the mutton goulash. The goulash - a kind of a lasagna, which is made with cooked pieces of mutton and baked with a lot of cheese- stole the show. We asked for an extra helping of chips to complement the food, and they complied, not once but twice.
To wash all this down, we ordered cafe mocha, Darjeeling tea, and cold coffee, and the beverages were accompanied by a tiny cookie from the house.
Finally we packed a loaf of focaccia bread and some cheese garlic rusks to take home. After all of this we had to shell out a total of only rs 1908 ( including taxes).
To sign off, I would recommend this cute and cozy haunt to all the foodies out there, for apart from the excellent food, the beautiful and adorable ambience is enough to keep one cheerful.

Cupcakes! Wiki may have a definition (or a full page on that), to really taste what a cupcake actually is, Mrs. Magpie is the right destination. The taste of cherry-cream cheese and the lemon white choc cupcake is lingering in my mouth as if a sweet dream tucked inside a deep-sleep. The decor, staffs (their warmness) is worth a mentioned. One who has designed this place is well acquainted with Europe and it's back-alley type coffee shops and has done justice to the name. A fairy tale like ambiance with superb confectionery, coffee and hot chocolate. Well done owners.

The cupcakes are both delicious and pretty, but are a bit heated up for the wallet! The size doesn't do that much justice to the price though. But that's a small thing. Negligible, if you are in a sweet mood. However, I feel the packing system could b better. You can either take a box of 6 small, or 9. None in between. Not even a big and small cupcake combination! That's a turn off. Else all is sweet in the little princess house.

To start with the ambiance and the decor of the insides of the place are bullseye because that is what you expect when you enter a shop named Mrs. Magpie. The reason for which I have rated the place average is mainly based on my experience with orders that I had made. The delicacies were not something to rave about but some of the snacks where appetizing to the palate. I will not fuss about the prices but proportionally I feel it is a tad to the expensive side. Overall a decent experience but there is room for improvement.

On reading so many pretty & positive reviews here, I decided yesterday to make my first visit to Mrs. Magpie. & I must say was disappointed. On placing my order at the counter of Hot chocolate mini, I sat at a table. A waiter at the counter asked me whether I had got a table, I told him yes, pointing at a vacant table. After a few minutes of me sitting at the vacant table, another waiter walked up to me to inform that the table was occupied & that the middle aged male occupants had stepped out for a smoke & that I should wait as there are others before me who were waiting outside. I walked up to the counter & told the two waiters there that I should have been told that the table was occupied or that I should wait out. They repeated the same thing that there were others waiting ahead of me. I cancelled my order & left the place.
I understand that Mrs Magpie has become very popular, that's why I went there for the first time, but would request the Management, to ensure that the waiters are well informed of which is a vacant table & which is still occupied -¬† not to depend on the gate - man who incidentally informed them, that the table is still occupied. Because as a customer I felt very small in front of other patrons, on being told that I should wait out as the table was occupied. Not happy at all.

Sometimes people have a bias against good-looking food. They'd like to believe that the pretty little cupcake can't possibly have it all. It can't be pretty, and original, and delicious. But at Mrs. Magpie it is.

The best one can say about a restaurant or any place really, is simply that they had a memorable time there. The ambiance at Mrs. Magpie is not so much about the pretty pink walls with the colourful window panes and the bright little seats and quirky, themed decorations in the display window and glass cabinets as it is about the light-hearted conversation giddy in anticipation of a little cup of hot chocolate or that peanut butter cupcake with the tiny bee on it, that they facilitate.
I've only ever been to Mrs. Magpie in a good mood and only ever left happier, and well fed.  Of course you may think happiness is overrated and so are cupcakes. Visit this cafe nonetheless. 

All of their cupcakes are nice. The Apple Brandy and Lemony White Chocolate especially so. I also liked the Nutty Praline and the Chocolate Hazelnut ones. It's really about personal preference when it comes to picking a cupcake. There are ones with flavours of marshmallows, cinnamon, apples and cherries as well as the usually nutty and chocolate based ones. Pick the Baileys cupcake if you want to cheat a little. 

The cupcakes, if you ask me, are reasonably priced. Their afternoon tea platters are a good bargain depending on how many people you are ordering for. The only drawback being that they serve their scones with the tea, which happen to be rather unremarkable.

I don't really care much for the little biscuits they serve either but the sandwiches are really well made. The chicken salad sandwich is served cold and feels refreshingly light. The mutton sandwiches are both sweet and savoury and the only time I had one, the bread was extra crunchy and really crisp. The pesto chicken sandwich too is worth a try. It's also heartening to see that they do have quite a few vegetarian options. I quite liked the egg onion parsley sandwich. The quiches are not bad either, but I wouldn't recommend the fish pie. 

The hot chocolate is the stuff of daydreams. It's just as thick, gooey and not-very-sweet as it should be. I only wish they'd pop a few marshmallows in it. 

For those that think the cupcake trend is dead but custards are forever, the coffee caramel custard is a must-try. It's just as good as it sounds.

Service is prompt and the staff friendly. It is evident that everything is made and served with care and skill.

OK I kno that at first glance, the tiny cupcakes for 40 bucks might seem like too much of an expense. I thought so myself. But the taste of it all.....it's really worth it. Be it the marshmallow one, the apple cinnamon, the one with white chocolate and lemon, or the nutty prauline, its just rich taste of good food. Period. And having them once in a while doesnt quite burn a whole in my pocket either. These tiny mouthfuls of sweet sugary heaven can make any heart meal complete (I kinda can't go without something sweet at the end of my meals :P )

This place was in my wishlist for such a long time. Atlast went there and it was soooo nice as I came here to meet my school friends after long time. We were 5 in number. The location is neat. It's near Hindustan Park straight in the lane opposite to azad Hind dhaba and after that the lane opposite to cloak room. Now the decor. Obvious it's soooo soooo cute and nice. The decor gives a fairy tale feeling with cakes decorated at sides. It's hard to control as the cupcakes looks soo delicious. And ofcourse loads of pies and marzipans. As we were 5 in number we ordered various types of cupcakes like nutty praline , after 8ish,  Marym  vanilla. All were very yummy. The after 8ish had a minty taste while the nutty praline was chocolaty. Then we had chocolate milk shakes and at last we ordered the shepherds pie and chicken pot pie. Both were soooo yummy. All over a very nice place for desserts , snacks and the yummy cupcakes .Would like to visit this place again for their other cupcakes . A must visit for dessert lovers.

A romantic date with your partner or gossiping with your besties..This is the best cafe in town for that! The cute dollhouse like decor lightens up even gloomiest of moods.We ordered 2 mini hot chocolate and 2 types of mini cupcakes (2 of each-Baileys 55 and marshmallow).

Hot chocolate-All the hype about it is completely true! Thick dark smooth molten chocolate..sinful pleasure at its best!

Baileys 55 cupcake- Perfect marriage of chocolate and liquor! The cupcake was moist & soft.It was the best cupcake I've ever tasted.

Chocolate marshmallow cupcake-It was moist and soft too. .and had a perfect balance of sweetness in it.

Looking forward to trying out this place a lot more times in future to pamper my sweet tooth! :)

This place is just the coziest and happiest bakery i have ever been to! The minute i set foot in here i absolutely melted. Sure, it was a little too pink for my taste but the tables and the chairs and the little bottles and the tantalizing smell of cakes blew me away. As my brother and i sat down for our Rakhi indulgence we were attended at once by a very friendly guy who made pointed out all the chocolate cakes and their separate fillings to satisfy our cravings. We asked for two mini chocolate cupcakes, two each of praline and peanut butter regular cupcakes, a chicken pot-pie and a ham and cheese quiche. Little did we know that the cupcakes were too heavy to finish! Nevertheless, they were absolutely beautiful. Every cupcake was moist and baked to perfection and the various kinds of fillings of peanut butter and strawberry jam and chocolate ganache were absolutely wonderful. Neither too sweet, nor too bland. The chicken pot pie was good enough but the ham quiche was a little too cinnamon-y for my taste, which led me to realise that maybe one should stick to cupcakes when visiting here.
Anyway, the cupcakes here are excellent. I have no complaints about the size of the mini cupcakes at all, they are absolutely perfect, but maybe a little pricey. Just a little, mind you. I am now looking for opportunities to visit again!

I personally don't like the interior.. It's too doll house type.. May be its intentional.

Statutory warning: This post is strictly for the people with sweet tooth. Frankly, I've heard of this place (good things of course), but couldn't somehow manage to go there- not very sure- why. But, this time I was invited there for their new puja menu launch and this is my experience on this place. 

How to go and when to go:-

Now, finding this place can be a little tricky one, as this one is tucked in a small and cozy corner in south Calcutta. We entered southern avenue from golpark and took the 2nd right hand lane. The first crossing one our left (instructed by the local chai-wallah) took us to this place- on our right. PFA Google location

Its open from breakfast till late evening and on all days. 

The ambience is cute, very cute - full of pick everywhere and personal touches can be found everywhere- the menu card, wall paint, window decoration, almost everywhere. Now, from the menu card, it seemed that their core strength is marzipan and decorative bakery. Off course, a good number of savory items can be found there. The items are slightly overpriced, but if we compare it with the quality of material they use, it seemed okay.The chocolate is pure belgian- for example. The menu can be found here . ¬†
We were busy clicking pictures. Now who wouldn't - considering you get the below items for shoot. 

We tasted their cafe Mocha, which was nice and chocolaty with their cookie platter. Both were fine.¬†

The next item for tasting was their cake of the day- it was a nicely done chocolate cake- full with exquisite belgian chocolate, but not layered. The top icing was brilliantly done as per the bengali puja theme. ¬†

The cakes were extremely heavy and for the good reasons (loads of belgian chocolate stuffing and priced at 675/- a piece). We were full and couldn't take these sweets any more and hence took a leave. ¬†

Final verdict:

A must go for sweet tooth persons and you should be prepared to pay a premium price for premium product. Hence be prepared and enjoy. 

Bon Apetite !!!

The ambience is just like you have landed it some fairy tale..starting from the tables and the decorations and all.. I tried all the minicup cakes. I loved the sweet and salty cupcake and all the rest. The mutton pie wasnt good it had many bones so ordering that was a bad choice.. But its a must visit and pretty romantic place..

The best part about this cute, little joint is it's lip smacking, bite-size snacks, one can enjoying with a cup(s) of tea. My friends and I were much inclined towards trying their "Savouries" section eventhough we are aware of their reputation for mini cupcakes. We started with Chicken 'n Cheddar, Salmon, Mutton, Pesto Chicken (not in the picture), and my two favourites from my last visit, Shepherd's Pie and Mutton Quiche, and polised them down with Minty Mojito and Cold Coffee. I'll give a 10 star to the Salmon Sandwich and a seven to the ambience. Staffs and their service were impressive.

Great place for a quick yet tasty bite. Love their cupcakes, puddings and the marzipans. Very very tasty. It's a small but beautifully decorated colourful place which can bring you up to speed on a gloomy day or when you are feeling low. Gets really really crowded at times and you will have to wait but the wait is worth it.

A place full of cupcakes. Could you ask for more?
The place is extremely well decorated, the reason why the young crowd loves flocking there. It looks like one of those pretty little bakeries we see in the movies.

Although it might be a bit difficult to locate (nobody in that area seems to know about this place) , but use Google Maps and you are good to go!

The choco-mint flavored cupcakes are my absolute favorite, followed by their Hot chocolate and their liquor infused cupcakes (something for the adults ;) ) and the Nutty cupcakes!!

You are surely gonna go back to Mrs Magpie for a box full of their baked goods :D

Downside? Sometimes the cupcakes tend to get a bit hard and yes; it is a tad bit over-priced too!!

Cute little place tucked away in one corner. It was a bit difficult to find at first..basically trying out this place was my friend's idea. Altough i was apprehensive at first thinking that it would b one pink girly place but i was surprised. I kinda liked mrs.magpie.

We had hot chocolate..those array of mini cupcakes , the walnut brownie and lastly a qu√≠ch√©( basically pastry stuffed with vegetables and mutton)..

Price isnt that high..i foubd it quite resonable..hadn't had the chance to visit again aftr that but will definitely do.

With trending cafes emerging all around..mrs magpie is a bit different..the preety and pinkiysh decor with nice ambience and a laid back atmosphere.. the service is quick.. it is what one can define as a "cute" place.. the serving plates as well as the assortment of knives,spoons and forks are trendy.
Coming to the food, we ordered for an expresso, 3 large frosted cupcakes and a chicken pot pie..
Expresso is a clear winner..it is made just the way it should be..
The chicken pot pie was okayish.. the crust ws thin and crisp..but the filling disappointed me..gravy lyk filling with hardly any hint of chicken..a creamy gooey liquid wch tasted alryt but with little amount of veggies and chicken scattered here and there..really disappointed!!!
The peanut butter and the cherry and cream frosted cup cakes were good but the aftr 8ish cupcake was horrible and nearly inedible.. strong and pungent flavour of mint destroyed the taste !!
I wud recommend the sandwiches..they look good and taste delicious!

A feel good day has to end with Mrs. Magpie. We were a bunch of 5 people all set after a tiring day for peppy evening at this pretty cafe. Much has been told about the cute decor however I sincerely feel they need to pay a little more attention to the weathered seats and cushion covers. 
Fantastic location, spacious outlet and some awesome food, the combination naturally makes the cafe stand apart from its competitors.
Now coming to the food, we ordered a lot. Am a declared fan of their grilled Chicken and Cheddar Sandwich. I tried the Curried Egg Sandwich recommended by a friend and it was mind blowing. The Chicken Capcicum Sandwich was decent. The non-veg Coronation was unusual. Cheesy, salty chicken with a hint of sweet Cranberry compote. Quite an innovation I must say.
I always found their cupcakes to be just about okay.I had my usual Cherry cream while my friends chose a jamboree including the marshmallow, after 8ish, Bailey Cream. One of them went for the Lemon Petit Pastry and said that she was happy with it.
The one thing that would always keep me going back to this dainty, little cafe that successfully instills a colonial hangover is the Hot Chocolate. They serve a cup of thick, smooth, dark, molten chocolate with the right kick of sugar and sheer bliss by the name of it.

A petit, pretty looking cafe in Purna Das Road where the hot chocolate, the lemony white cupcake, the cherry n' cream cheese cupcake, the mushi mushi, the cinnamon apple cupcake and the coffee creme caramel.. really worth trying. 

I also like their Chicken salad sandwich and Pesto Chicken Sandwich. The lemon sorbet is a little on the sweeter side (no, maybe a lot! :p ). They make a mean quiche too. I do think their scones are nothing to write home about though.

Also, they make the best hot chocolate!

We were lucky enough to get a table here during the peak Saturday evening hours. The staff is warm and cordial and the store is set up perfectly to give feel of a side Cafe in US.
The place is small but very well organized by round tables and designed chairs. The wall I must say attracts one's attention due to its decorations..
The cupcakes are my favorite.. We had cherry 'n' cream cheese cupcake and peanut butter cupcake.. So when we decided to have something sweet this Cafe popped in my head. Good things always come in small packages :-D

They are too small, cute, colorful. Big ones is also there. But one thing i expected more from this place. Specialy cup cakes were perfect  for photography, time pass not for  solid food to eat. Cup cakes are too cute but taste wise expected more. Sandwiches and milk shakes were good enough.. All over it was a good place for hangout and photography..

I WAS ON A DIET, till I steped into Mrs.Magpie! 
I had clearly decided that it would only be my book and a kettle of Earl grey tea, till my eyes met with the sight of those cupcakes, and i fell in love. If there is anything sweeter than this, it love my friend. Mrs.Magpie is a real life doll's house, with pretty pink walls and a mysterious fragnance which is simply beautiful! A bench outside the place specially made to seat the people waiting to eat inside and a bell attached to the main door,catching the attention of the waiters who welcome you with a "Hello ma'am!". This place is very 'cute' if i¬† may call it, in every aspect! Seriously, CUTE is the adjective you can use to describe EVERYTHING here, starting from the the wallpaper, to the colourful wooden doors, and even to the the salt cellar,which is in the shape of a bird!
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I never eat so much at any other place than i do at Mrs.Magpie. Their cupcakes are a treat to the eye as well as to your taste buds. Moreover, they are affordable and prices at a rate of Rs.40 and Rs.90! The USP of this cute little place is the adorable marzipan art work placed on top of the food-smiling bees, colourful flowers, ladybugs, etc. This attracts many and looks equally appealing. Apart from the Cupcakes, there are other specialities this place has aswell, like thier Mushroom Quiche and their cold coffee. However, there are only a few specialities which are not sweet-and i guess that is one tiny drawback this doll house has. Their grilled Veg Mediterranian sandwich is one dish which is very bland,and is simply boring vegetables put together with some bread-it could use some flavouring, mayo or some sauces! Being a vegetarian, i could not try the non-vegetarian dishes, but my friends did tell me that the shepheards pie was a delight to eat along with the mutton sandwich. Even some omlettes were nice, they had a good size, and were filling. If you wish to just have a snack and some tea, The Earl Grey/Darjeeling tea are good, along with a Creamy veg puff! AND, they have BRILLIANT COLD COFFEE, for all those coffee addicts.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† So, to sum it all up Mrs.Magpie is a nice Hansel and Gretel's cottage place, which serves lovely desserts and will greatly satisfy those with a sweet tooth, but might not be the favourite of those suffering from diabetes! they also have a unique less embarrassing way of paying up--in their little money box, in which they give you the bill in and you put the money! i just wished that they had a wider scope of more filling, non-sweet dishes and could maybe include some other desserts too like, Cheese cakes, Macaroons and Blueberry pies! Apart from such avoidable flaws, the place is delightful. Its decor is honestly, very girly and may not be the favourite of too many men,¬† but the friendly and warm service makes up for it. The washoom is quite tiny, but is clean. I'm glad to have a snacks joint where you will find people from all age groups-starting from little children drooling over the cupckes, to couples holding hands-sharing an ice cram and finally to a kitty party of widowed bengali women enjoying some gossip over tea. i hope this place sticks around every time i have a break up, or when I am pregnant-because honestly, this is a guilty sweet escape!
Best wishes to the entire team of Mrs.Magpie! :)
p.s- i did notice those tiles on the broundary wall of the tree! Decorators, WELL DONE! :D

Come Sunday mornings , almost every now and then , I feel myself being drawn to this place . It's like a guilty pleasure kind of thing . Possibly there are more similar places , but Mrs. Magpie is quite near to where I live and being adjacent to Gariahat , RashBehari many a times I do turn up there - for breakfast meets, Noon and afternoon Tea and once even around 9 o clock . But yes, it's not a large place so on a busy weekend evening , you may have to stand in que .¬†
The cupcakes are really good - i usually chose among the Small Frosted or Liquer , but you can go for the Large Frosted or Large Marzipan , which is slightly costly . If you are visiting after noon in a group, you can surely try The Magpie Special Afternoon Tea , which comes with a range of sandwiches , cupcakes , loaf cake, biscuits, chocolates, scones and also a pot of tea, which we exchanged for a coffee .
I have had the Shepherds pie which was a little small in size , but then this is not a place for having Lunch . I also have had the milkshakes and they are pretty good too.¬†
As regards the ambience , it is quite well decorated and themed and mostly have regulars i guess .

I visited this very widely publicised Confectioner yesterday, for the first time. Overall, a disappointing experience. The decor & ambience are very cool, upwardly mobile, very European cafe type-- all that is good. But, the pastries & savouries are too small in size & insufficient quantity. Is it because they are trying to price point , affordable? But, a place like this will only attract high- end customers, who will not be unwilling to shell out that extra amount for good quality. A Rs 40/- pastry is so small that it finishes in just one bite. Same with the Sheperd's Pie @ 75/-. But, must say that the quality is great. That's  why I repent the strange pricing & size.

I have been hearing abt this place quite sometime now in social media newspaper and others .. So one fine Sunday evening decided to step in to this cafe... As per the appearance of the cafe is very cute in one word... And behaviour of the people there is delightful .. 
If I have to rate them by the decor and presentation a 4 stars or may be 4.5 stars..
Coming on to the food.. The quality and taste is nice.. But some how I felt the size is too small in some cases.. Like the small cupcakes are too small .. May be that size factor can be increased a bit....I would say they very good with eye candy but quality and taste is good which can be improved more...Anyway all in all a good place to hangout and have good time...

Ufffff...one of the cutest place I have visited..
Not only in terms of the decor of the place but also the cupcakes....
We ordered for sandwich, tea & cupcake. I liked them so much that I ordered some cupcakes for my sister's bday also.
Oh one more thing if you are looking for some designer cupcakes of whatever size they can surely make it on oreder. So check in there sometime for evening snacks.

This is the more popular outlet of Mrs magpie's , and is located on the lane opposite golpark ramkrishma mission institute of language studies . The shop is situated in the middle of a quiet residential locality , and is popular with the cafe crowd . The space inside is small , so we had to wait outside on the colorful bench for an empty table for alomost half an hour. Food here seems to be of lesser importance as the menu seemed limited for people looking for a brunch . The focus of attention here are the cupcakes , which are cute , colorful, and come in a variety of flavors . However , do not order the mini cup cakes as they practically resemble the mock food from the interiors of a doll house , that is , they are too tiny for human consumption !! Though they taste as good and yummy as the  large cupcakes , which have fillings inside the cake as well ! The coleslaw sandwich was average and the hot chocolate mini was a sweet delight , and not for people without a sweet tooth , as it is dense and heavily sweet. The omelette tasted bland , the tea was served in the cutest tea pot ever ! Don't visit this place if you are super hungry , but when you could just sit down with a tiny something and chat for long hours with friends . And oh , the place makes for great pictures with all the wall paintings and quirky little frames on the walls , as well as the classic cake shop look with pink paint and frilly decor .

A pretty pink cafe. Beautiful cake-artworks n english breakfast menus. The ambience is pleasing. The cakes were definitely not the typical pastries that we come across in regular cake store or cafes....so thumbs up for the change variety and more attention to confectionary details...however they can be better with a little more effort and broader spectrum of cake designs and creativity....

This place does not need an introduction, not anymore. The charming decor of this cafe in Keyatala Road and its sumptuous food speak for themselves. I visited this cafe after nearly a year after I was last there and nothing much had changed. I expected a menu upgrade but I guess since they have opened up a bistro elsewhere, this can be overlooked. The food tasted excellent, the cupcakes ever so delicious. I packed some cupcakes as takeaway and as the staff had assured me, the packing was well done such that the creamy toppings were not squished, thankfully! Hope to see menu upgrades soon, otherwise the place is just as fine.

A cute little place...with a doll's house like charm...it takes one back to ones childhood. Love their cup cakes and my favourite is after eight. Their afternoon tea combo is okay. I'm not a big fan of their scones.At times the place becomes too crowded and one has to wait on the bench outside.
Sorry to say that a recent visit was a bad experience there. The food was good, as usual their cup cakes are excellent. The after eight and sweet n salty cup cakes were delicious. They have now introduced pizzas and the Margherita we had was good. The hot chocolate here is basically melted chocolate with very little milk or water. So all Chocolate lovers feel satisfied.But the service was just too bad, negligent and uncaring staff. Two of them were just running helter skelter showing how busy they were!!! When we were seated they didn't bother to serve water and didn't come to take the order either. We had to call two three times before they deigned to take the order.  Ok. We understand that pizza takes long and we were ok with that. But even to get our bill they kept us waiting for ages!!!Too slow.

Everything about this place oozes cuteness, from the colourful bench outside the place to the cute wall paintings. The cupcakes are the USP. Anyone who has been a fan of After 8 chocolates have to try the After 8-ish cupcake.   But i wish the service was commendable too. Thats where it takes a downhill.

As you walk through the door of this cafe, setting the little bell on the door to a faint ring, you enter another dimension of cuteness. Yes, this little cafe on the Lake Terrace road called Mrs. Magpie's redefines cuteness. Everything starting from the wallpapers, the chairs to the showcases scream cuteness.¬†

Reality check!

The menu is ¬†impressive. Appearance of the food you are served is even more so.
BUT....
The food is not what I'd call delectable. The cupcakes ooze cuteness and are sure to soothe your optic nerves but won't make your taste buds happy.¬†
Also, the ham and jalapeno omelette that I had was too salty with no trace of either ham or jalapeno in it. Basically, you get a plain omelette with nanoparticles of ham and jalapeno that do nothing to enhance the taste of the omelette, at the cost of Rs. 225.
Of the savouries, we had the Shepherd's pie and Chicken-cheddar puff. I must say the shepherd's pie is a must try while the chicken-cheddar puff was so bland that I'd never again think of having it on my plate.

Another thing that I'd like to comment on is the food quantity. The "mini cupcakes" are not actually mini. They are "micro" portions. Everything on the menu that has a "mini" prefixed to it should actually be read "micro". I mean I've had "mini" cupcakes elsewhere and they certainly were way larger than the ones served here. And given the quantity they provide, I think the prices are a tad bit on the higher side.

Overall, Mrs. Magpie's is a visual delight, selfie-holic's paradise, your taste bud's plight and your wallet's fright.

Since the rating of any restaurant should be primarily based on the food they serve, it's quality and quantity, so as of now, I can't rate Mrs. Magpie's any higher than a 3 (even though I badly wanted to rate them higher because of the cute decor). Hoping to have tastier goodies on my next visit so that I can rate them higher.

Nice cute place. And amazing choice of little cupcakes , I prefer the small ones. Apart from that u might not get everything on their menu. They go like sir let me see if we have that and come back and disappoint u. Sandwiches are nice but wish I could get the one I wanted and not the one they had . chairs are not very comfortable either . I think it's important coz u need to be comfortable where u r sitting or u will just leave early

This place has always been close to my heart, courtesy the cupcakes and the uber chique decor! But of late, Mrs. Magpie has been a bit of a disappointment! Most of the savouries off it's menu isn't available post 8 pm and the much hyped club sandwich loses it's taste a bit with every passing visit!
But hey! Don't judge me if you still catch me sitting here on a random evening! The pastel walls, the country wallpapers, the riot of quirks and hues and the pretty cupcakes can still put all my mood swings at bay!

The place has its charm especially the bench outside.It gives the patisserie a relaxed British feel.

The products are a little unusual and the quirkiness adds to their appeal.

Ham quiches,pastries whose name I forgot and tea.

Ok,  first up the sizes of the cupcakes could not get any smaller.  
We had the afternoon tea platter and it was okay. 
The nutty praline and the other cupcake with the lemon cream(sorry, I don't remember the name) was really good.  
But the cake itself wasn't really nice but the creams on the cupcake was just amazing. 
Scones were undercooked, the teas was beautiful,  chocolates were nice but the cookies and biscuits were average.

The first time I ever visited was on Christmas day a few years back, right after it opened, and I have gone back many times.  Most people rave about the cupcakes here, but although there are a couple I order every time, like the sweet and salty and the lemon, I think the other food here are worth a mention. From my very first visit I adore the raisin scones, with their dollops of cream and butter and jam on the side, delicious quiches and the biscotti and cookies they serve with hot beverages. The pretty china teacups, the cherry-blossom patterned wallpaper and the quaint and colourful furniture combined lend a feel of an English tearoom straight out of an Enid Blyton book. Add to that the lovely marzipan creations and tiny centrepieces and you have the perfect place to get away to for a few hours.

I have visited soo many times but never gave the review god knows why. But now I am so here it goes.
I absolutely love this place and everything they serve and I do mean everything.  I have tried most of the items they have. The sliders are juicy, the cup cakes are moist, perfectly balanced. Not overly sweet. All the flavours are soo good. I feel like having all of them. The    hot chocolate is perfectly made and the best is that they don't add any milk to it. It is thick and smooth and finger licking. If I could I would lick the cup there only.
I can go on and on about the place but in short a must visit for everyone who appreciate good food. :')
And continue the good service and food you serve Sohini :-)

Most of us with a sweet tooth are intimately familiar with this place. For the novices, if you are feeling under the weather and want some TLC then head over to Mrs. Magpie's. The decor is bound to cheer you up; it is a place where birds and rainbows and unicorns and fairy tales seem totally in context. Mrs. Magpie's is known for its hot chocolate Which is indeed the thickest in the city! And of course their cupcakes! They look too pretty too eat but once you dig in you will want to keep going. Not enough is said about its savoury spread. I loved the ham and cheese quiche and the shepherd's pie. They were loaded with cheese, the meat was tender and the crust crisp. All this in a pocket friendly price. Head over now!

The first time I went there was last year after reading so much about it. A cute little place with small seating arrangement. It was like going back to the play school days. I was in luck ( though at that time I did not realise it) that there was less crowd and I could 
manage a seat. After having read so much about their cup cakes, I tried them. They were ok, not something to rave about, but not bad either. Then I tried hot chocolate. It was excellent. I went home happy.
This year I again went there in the company of a friend. This time, too, God was with us and we got a seat. My friend was frankly surprised at the place and complimented me for finding out such a sweet little place in a sleepy lane. We ordered Tea course with Darjeeling tea. The tea was golden in colour and lovely . The accompanied finger sandwiches were a delight. I could not have enough of them. The cup cakes were also nice. My friend went away satisfied and we promised to return again with other friends.
Last time, I took my mother there. Alas, there was no seat to spare. I couldn't be lucky the third time. Young people sat at the table and chattered on idly and caring little for the time passing by. The staff asked me to wait for ten minutes. I could have waited had I been alone, but with mother, it was not possible. The uncaring guests looked at us balefully and continued chattering despite their plates being empty. The staff could not, understandably, ask them to leave. Disappointed, I turned back, hoping that someday, I shall be able to give this lovely experience to my mother who loves tea. But don't know when.

Its good. Its pricey. Somehow I could not find a credible reason to charge us so much for cup-cakes. You may get a glimpse of Tolly stars in here but I would rather pay for good food. I visited the place with my fianc√© and our sisters. We had sandwiches, 3-4 types of cupcakes and tea. All was well. Nothing to justify the hype.

A good 45 minute wait signaled Mrs. Magpie's popularity! Once in, I was overwhelmed by the cute and painstakingly detailed decor, with a dollhouse theme. It is unlike anything I have seen in a restaurant and it is beautiful :) We quickly got to the menus and ordered a veg quiche and sliders. They arrived, sized according to the dollhouse theme :-| Portions are tiny here (everything we had was a maximum of 3 bites) and while I get that concept for desserts, with savory and mains, I feel customers are getting ripped off. With that out of the way, the food is pretty great. Both were delicious, the quiche especially was exquisite (crumbly, aromatic, flavorsome). The grilled chicken sandwich was so-so. The mini cupcakes which I thought were their specialty were frankly, disappointing, at least the lemony vanilla and after 8ish were. However, our sweet and satisfying ending came from the coffee and caramel pudding, which was outstanding. I could travel 20 km just for that, or a bigger portion of that :P

Phew! what a craze among youngsters about Mrs. Magpie. A tourist attraction for foreigners and international students. Colourful cupcakes is the first point of attraction between ages of 8 to 80 years. Ambiance has resemblance of fairy tale movie set.

Ordered various cupcakes like After 8ish, Marshmallow, Lemony White Chocolate, Sweet n Salty, Nutty Praline, Baileys 55, Cinnamon Apple, Cointreau 55 and Peanut Butter. Had cuppa of Assam Tea served in a pot with complimentary ginger biscuits.

Staff was so courteous and obedient. Give honest try to speak in English. Bill was INR 485 but experience was priceless.

I have visited this place about 2-3 times for cupcake take-outs and every bit of my experience with the place have been awesome !

It's a tad difficult to find if you are not good with maps (like me), but it's all for good because it makes the place quiet and perfect to be the little dollop of fairytale that it aims to be.

You find the shop, push through the door, a very cute bell rings somewhere, you're immediately surrounded by the sweet and warm smell of baking and voila ! you're inside a fairytale !

I love their cupcakes, especially the Sweet 'n' Salty, Marshmallow and After Eight.
The sweet-n-salty has this heavenly, gooey chocolate frosting with a perfectly salty caramel filling. 
The marshmallow cupcake is topped with the best marshmallow I have ever had and it's raspberry jam filling is such a happy surprise !
After eight, with just the right hint of mint in it, is pretty cool too.

Oh, and the marzipan decorations ! Cutecutecutecutecutecuteee. @_@ and so much delicious to eat 'em too !

Another great thing, their service folks. I love places where they have service people who smiles and talks and make you feel welcome instead of being mechanically 'polite'. This is one of those places.

I totally look forward to visit Mrs. Magpie and instead of getting take-aways, just sit there, spend some time and taste their savory items sometimes very soon. :)

An evening out with friends? This is the place you're looking for then. Hidden in the lane opposite to azad hind dhaba(near golpark) , this place is just perfect to relax , chat and also to satiate your taste buds. To begin with a pot of earl grey tea (there are other choices too) with the complimentary cookie or scones is just perfect. Then ofcourse the cupcakes , awesome is the word for them. Also other cakes and various other pastries are there. I'd recommend shepherd's pie. If you are a fan of caramel custard then please try coffee caramel custard here. They serve probably the best one in the city. The interior is too one of a kind. All the items in display are unique in itself.

Had been wishing to go here for as long as I can remember. The baby cupcakes were fresh and delicious. The ham and chicken quiche with dollops of cheese on it was yum too. The ambience is nice and calm and looks like a room in a dolls house. The best part was however the club sandwich. The prices are on a little steeper side and so I'm deducting a point. Good service.

The cake was beyond expectations! I have literally never had a chocolate cake this good and it was very different. I had ordered a chocolate theme cake for my best frn's b'day. The theme was very sweet and whatever I had imagined, it was exactly like that. Actually, far better than that. The cover was green which wasn't very good to taste but it can be neglected 'cuz of the highlighting taste of the chocolate inside. And the place looked very sweeeeet. Small and cozy. But, I had a lot of difficulty searching for it. The staff was very friendly and cooperative. But, make sure u carry a good sum while entering this place. It's expensive. But, worth going. Will definitely go to try the cupcakes and other items.

I visited Mrs Magpie with a friend, when there was a lot of hype going on about the place.

LOCATION: In a quiet lane of Southern Avenue. Google Map helped me locate the place. I chose the lane opposite Anjali Jewellers, and walked straight on the road for nearly 10 minutes to reach the cafe.

AMBIANCE: At first glance, it looked out of place. :P Well, because it was a neat, tiny, flamboyant cafe in the middle of a Kolkata lane. It has a decorated bench on the outside which adds to its charm. As we got inside through the door, a little bell attached to the door, rang, and that was quite pleasing. The interior was beautifully done, and was really 'cute'.

FOOD: We went there specially for the cupcakes, and while choosing, we were spoilt for choice. They had so many of beautiful cupcakes, and it was a visual delight to watch them all in the shelf window. We ordered 6 cupcakes and Hot Chocolate. As said earlier, the cupcakes are beautiful, but as soon as I tasted them, I was disappointed. While the frostings were good, the cupcakes were dry from the inside. They lacked the moistness, and didn't taste as good as they looked. Next we had ordered sandwiches- Pesto Chicken and Coronation Chicken. They tasted good enough and we really liked those.

CONCLUSION: The food ranged from poor to just-good. I expected a lot more from Mrs Magpie. The prices are okay. You can definitely visit this cafe once.

The 1st thing I love this cosy place is its decor. The ambiance is really nice and the Staffs are also very helpful.
I love cupcakes over there especially, the cupcakes covered with marzipan... They are very delicious. We also loved the birthday cake ordered for my husband which was chocolate cake with salted caramel filling covered and decorated with marzipan.
Mrs. Magpie also offers quite a number savoury dishes. One can try their evening tea platter as well.

Saturday morning my kid wanted to have some cup cakes and for me this was the best opportunity to go to Mrs Magpie. Located near the second last crossing of Lake the ambiance of this place awesome, cute. Wooden floors, lively pink colors anyone will love it and very courteous staff

I ordered an English breakfast along with the coffee. The breakfast had baked mushrooms and beans 2 fried eggs and 4 pieces of sausage. All of them were nice. Actually nothing special, how can we judge a place depending on 2 fried eggs which would taste the same in all place and toast which will also taste the same anywhere. ¬†So I decided to go for some cup cakes and which off course is the specialty of this place.¬†

I ordered large frosted After Eight, Sweet and salty and Marshmallow and here comes my shocking experience. Ever had a colored colgate toothpaste with a cupcake? That's exactly what it tasted to me after having that cute blue topping cupcake. I tried the normal tea time cup cake which was okayish.

I truly didnot have the guts to try any more of them, but will update all of you each time I have a cup cake.

My verdict: This place is expensive, a breakfast costs around five hundred bucks which I guess you can get anywhere at a much cheaper price with the items given on the breakfast and would taste same everywhere around the world toast, baked beans, fired eggs..

For cupcakes, I am not going to have it for the second time at least. Visit this place once if you want to enjoy a cute place with your one over a cup of coffee.

The cafe is at a stone's throw from the humdrum of gariahat, yet in a quiet lane off it..so location-wise it's at a great spot. It was on my wishlist for a long time. I was a little apprehensive about how the cupcakes would be since I neither like too much cream nor too sugary frostings..but all my doubts were put to rest one bite through my first mini cupcake here. Nutty praline was not available, so I had settled for a sweet 'n' salty. It was too good. The only problem is that the cakes look so dainty and cute that it almost seems like an act of cruelty to eat them up! The chicken sliders though are not one of their strong points it seemed. Must mention the lovely teapots and the nice tea made with actual tea leaves and not some damned teabag! All along this cafe remained full of patrons flowing in and out. Decor wise it is pretty and doll house like! But the magazines looked a bit out of place with the setting.

Never go to this place, the upholstery is all soiled and dirty. The food is nothing great. We ordered for a strawberry shake but got extttrrraaa sugary vanilla shake which was pink in colour. I mean c'mon there is a difference between strawberry shake and vanilla shake.

Have ordered practically everything on the menu during several visits. But an all time favourite is the sweet and salty cupcake. Ginger bread cookies, walnut brownie with cream cheese and shortbread cookies
Taste-4/5 freshly baked , crispy on the outside and soft on the inside
Quality-4/5
Quantity-4/5
Ambience-5/5

My trip to Mrs.Magpie was planned suddenly on a rainy Saturday afternoon of July, with my three close friends from campus.
To mention, this was my second visit after a year later and so I had some idea in my head.
Location - Check Zomato maps.
Ambience - The place screams pink. The interiors are cozy and the furniture matches their decor. The wall papers are beautiful. In the shelves they have model of fondant cakes one can look at.
Food - We ordered a variety of cupcakes..Nutty Praline - amazing. Mish Mush - good . Marshmallow - really great. Bailey's- disappointment. Sweet and Salty -my absolutel favourite. Overall loved the cupcakes, even though they were tiny sized, but Sweet And Salty and Nutty Praline was the highlight.
Savouries -
Shepherd's Pie - It was unbelievablly tiny and not that good tasting for Rs75/pc.
Chicken Pot Pie - Was cooked to perfection. The crust of the pie was wonderful so was the filling.
Non-Veg Club Sandwich served with potato wafers. Simple but tasty. And quite filling.
But overall savouries were meh. Like a distraction from the extra sweetness.

Service - They charged for food we did not order. But immediately changed and apologized. The service was slow, but workable.

Pocket Pinch - On the higher side for the quantity.

Verdict - Will come back again for the cupcakes. Pretty much that. But, would not recommend if you are counting your calories.

Finally Sayantani di took me here and gave me a treat. She ordered all the mini frosts. Winner for me was definitely the cherry n cheese then the nut praline, the peanut butter and mushy mushy and yes the lemon and white choc.  Sayantani di had two apple n cinammon cupcake so its good too. And the mojito is not good, neither the orange punch, but if you are a tropicana or real juice fan you csn try it as these are made of those drinks.
The service... well they won't bother you with anything, one can call it unprofessional or unattentive but too me it was good because we got a long time to chat.

One of the top-notch cafes in the city! The food is a-grade, delectable, scrumptious and the ambience is straight out of a storybook. Gets a little overcrowded on weekends. But the wait is worth it!
What I love: Cafe Mocha, Darjeeling Tea, Chicken pot Pie, Omelette variants, Shepherd's Pie. The cute itsy-bitsy Marzipans and Frosted Cupcakes are probably the best in this part of the world.

Cup Cake escapade that is how I think of this visit to Mrs. Magpie. We tried almost every small sized cup cakes on the display case... And it helped that we sat near it!!! ;) 
From the Bailey to the Contrieu, from the After 8ish , to the Cherry Cream, the Apple Cinnamon, the Marshmallow, Lemon Meringue, we sampled the bite sized cake slices too... The Trio, a Lemon cake with crackling tempered white chocolate, the Raspberry Square.... And another delectable delicacy whose name I don't remember....
Washed down with a pot of Aromatic Darjeeling tea and some Savoury peanut cookies .... For that optimum degree of saltiness when the sweetness became too overpowering....
As for the cupcakes... All of them were a mouthful of paradise... Sinful and irresistible... Moist and baked to perfection, the topping creams were fresh and tasty.... And the fondant decorations adorable.... 
Can't wait to return to sample the few remaining cupcakes on the shelves...
PS I must add here that the savoury eatables on the menu are also amazing... Having sampled almost everything I recommend the Coronation Sandwich, the Non veg Club sandwich and the Croque Monsieur... Amazing!!! :)

My rating is solely based on one particular thing which , to me is the best in the world ---  the nutty praline cupcakes..to begin with the cream on top..nicely coated with a pinch of sugar and nuts with a caramelish essence,that is one heavenly delight and it hit the spot rightaway..then the cake...nice and soft..then the caramel filling inside which can never be found anywhere else..
Well another thing i ordered was ham and cheese quiche --which was equally good in taste but a bit too pricey for its size..had a great time here..and dont stop making such good cupcakes

Mrs magpie the name is very interesting so as their cupcakes . Had liqueur filled cup cakes . And felt that it is worth that I am living and I may have chance to eat it many more times. Zest  of Belgium chocolate and hint of Baileys made it so desirable, that you only want to close your eyes and feel it in your mouth. Though we also had chocolate mousse and vanilla cinnamon pudding but they are mere good side characters.  Certainly The main protagonist is one and only liquor cup cake.‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

Superb. Awesome cupcakes of different flavors and shapes. Amazing garnishes on the cupcakes and tastes awesome. U would like to have all of them. Apart from cupcakes the sandwich and patties are also good but very small in size. Coffee tastes normal. The ambience is very nice. Specially girls will like more..with pink splash and well decorated. Loved the place. The main attraction are the cupcakes.

It is a very nice place. Very nice ambience. It is a bit over priced though. Some of the cup cakes are really good. Nutty praline can be tried if someone likes coffee flavour. The frozen cup cakes are also very nice. They have one which is called sweet and salty, this one has a great chocolate layer.

After seeing the reviews about this place I am very excited to go there but when I arrived, I have to wait for more than 20mins. The place is to small with little number of sits. The ambiance is nice. The staffs are polite. Then come to food we ordered 2 cakes( nutty praline and lemony white chocolate), mutton quiche, one cold beverage(orange punch) and a dessert (triple chocolate brownie). The cakes was awesome. But mutton quiche is a disaster it smells like raw meat. But the dessert and the cold beverage was nice. And over all it is a nice place for hangout.

Mrs Magpie is a Doll House based in Southern Avenue, especially if your into too much pink.. then this is the most apt place! The coffee is a better option to go for than the tea, accompanied with the cute cupcakes and cookie baskets. Caramel custard has been my favorite here so far. However the place could do with some more space and seats as one may need to wait during the evening hours especially on weekends. Otherwise Mrs Magpie s a charming place to enjoy the best cupcakes in town!!

Have been frequenting this place with some friend or the other since last year. ¬†

Perfect for an evening adda over cupcakes,scones and light snacks. Nutty Praline happens to be my favourite among the cupcakes.The "Afternoon Tea" combo with scones,cupcakes,sandwiches and tea is quite filling(if you are planning to meet an old friend and and have a long conversation).
The place is very very pretty,like its cupcakes.
The to-go place for "cupcakes and conversations",for me.

Recently went there for breakfast.¬†
The quiche : the filling good,the crust was not as good.
The hot chocolate was like velvet,smooth and pleasing as a friend says.
The chicken platter,though it tasted good,was disappointing because it was nothing to do with its name. Quantity was very less as well.
They seriously needs to do something about the quantity of the items!

Had visited this place late at night so many of the things on their menu weren't available. Those going there for the first time may find the place hard to locate.
This is a very cute little place. The ambience is perfect.
We tried three-four types of cupcakes . Out of these ,sweet and salty and nutty praline were nice. However after 8ish and the lemon were okay, nothing great.
Although their products are very attractive, but the taste failed to impress us. I also feel some of their products are a bit over priced compared to the taste.
However I would like to give this place another try as I would like to try some more things from their menu.

Went there on a bright sunny morning. The decor is surely something, that one wouldn't usually find in a city like Calcutta. I ordered a Bailey's Cupcake and Cafe Latte. The cupcake was a bit dry, on the inside. But the frosting was worth the money. The coffee was okayish. Nothing too great there. All in all, the pretty place is surely worth visiting.

All the compliments  regarding food and ambience apart, this restaurant has won over me for it's commitment. Recently my friend and I pressed them over a cake delivery  (name of A. Biswas) at a very short notice that also had to be transported by train. The fact that the employees took it upon themselves to not only ensure it's quality but also the fact that it stays intact was mesmerising. Thanks a ton to Prashant and others for making a kid's b'day special, far away from Calcutta.

Oh, I could keep returning at least twice or thrice a week for perhaps the finest pint-sized snack that I have discovered here - their Chicken & Cheddar Puff, which at its best is all of 3.5-4 inches in length, but packed with the freshest chicken and cheddar paste that I have ever tasted!

The beauty about this wondrous puff is that they have mastered the fine art of baking it absolutely fresh at the outlet. Which explains it's flaky fresh turnout, each time, every time!

More on their other delicious offerings in separate posts, but one request: When you have such a great thing going, please don't ever change a thing about it!

As a kid have you ever wondered how will it feel like to be invited to Mad Hatter's tea party? to sip tea and crack jokes upon cookies while cup cakes dance to the tune of your chit-chat. Then Mrs.Magpie is your dream wish fulfillment.¬†
I discovered this little haven of all things bright and ¬†beautiful back in my college days and since then it has been one of my favorite go to place on days when i feel amazing and also on the not so amazing days.¬†
you will be welcomed by a tinkling bell in the entrance and suddenly without experiencing the fall into the rabbit's burrow you will enter the wonderland. the amazing bread display where during Christmas you can certainly have a date with gingerbread man, the amazing cupcakes they offer and you can just sit by the display and drool over the oh so delicious cupcakes while sipping on a hot chocolate on a shivering winter afternoon. Even the most serious and uptight guy friends can also shed their annoying snob attitude once you throw them into this little wonderland.¬†
I wont go into the details of the flavors of the cupcakes that i have tasted because it would simply add up to what has already been said. But one thing is for sure, every time you order a cupcake and try to eat it, you will face more dilemma that Hamlet ever did, "to eat or not to eat" as each one is a piece of art and you feel like a murderer. ¬†Their servings of bite sized sliders and sandwiches are pretty good too. ¬†I don't know what took me so long to review this place. Visiting Mrs. Magpie is a different experience all together. Just stop reading reviews and go and make your visit.¬†
Disclaimer: those on strict diet, you have no idea what you guys are missing on.¬†
See. Eat. Repeat. Calories be damned!! :D

A sudden wish for a quick bite at Mrs Magpie - a place where I planned to go for months. We had to wait for around 15 minutes to get a table for 6. The outlet is a bit small but very cosy and presents a homely atmosphere. We ordered a lot of things at one go, where, undoubtedly, Chicken Salad sandwich stands out. We ordered every variant of cup cakes available just to try them out. The ones with a difference are Lemony white chocolate, Marshmellow and chocolate hazzlenut 
I just loved the decors and cutleries, the attires and attitude of house staffs, the ambiance and feel inside the outlet. Counting my days to visit this one again.

What do call a cup of hot chocolate thick enough to melt in your mouth. Bliss. Or a chicken slider, boisterous and avant, delicious nonetheless. The Shepherd's Pie, a legendary mix of past and innovation. Mrs. Magpie, with its quaint British/Irish countryside cafe inners, is a delight to be. The price at times might just seem to be a bit prohibitive. Otherwise, a perfect getaway for the weekend.

One of the best places in South Kolkata to have an evening snack or two along with those wonderful shakes..It is located near vivekananda park in southern avenue. The place is always bustling with energy and vibrant with enthusiasm of the young crowd. Its has a feel good factor associated with it and most of the delicacies on the menu like cakes,sandwhiches,quiches,puffs,etc are a novelty...the various shakes are also utterly delicious. Its a bit costly I must say but considering its prime location,the decent name it has made for itself and the assortment of delicacies on the menu, the prices seems justified..overall a great experience!!

Heard of Mrs. Magpie a lot from friends and fellow Zomato foodies so decided to give it a shot on my week lend food hopping. The placed was closed for orders though as it was late but take away was open. 
It is a really fancy bakery where there is a bell when you open the door. Excellent decoration inside as if you are inside a cake house. Though the items were limited they looked excellent. After viewing an array of options my friend Sibasish Banerjee and me decided to have cupcakes. He took a Marshmallow with chocolate, whereas i opted for a lemon chocolate frosting. The cupcakes were really amazing and left a sweet taste in the mouth craving for more. Will visit again definitely and update the review. As of now for the cupcakes and the decor 4/5.

Its a lovely place! This place has such an English feel to it, a combination of class, cuteness, and luxury. Pink flowery wallpapers, antique rack, with the cakes u generally see on TLC!! Glass table has easter eggs beneath! Wide variety of cupcakes, beautifully decorated! Its a perfect place for kids, who would b just thrilled with everything over there. I found my must have over there on my first visit, 'cream tea' - this has Darjeeling freshly brewed tea pot, 2 freshly baked scones, served with butter, clotted cream, Strawberry marmalade, and a cookie! Its definitely a go again n again kinda place :)

Went to this place yesterday. Very well decorated, the colour combination and the interior has quite a bit of European if not English flavour. Very vibrant and spacious.¬†

You will be greeted by very friendly and welcoming staff. They are very attentive and are very quick. Most importantly they are always smiling.

¬†The interior is really interesting and beautiful. Nothing fancy yet quite unique. They cutlery is placed in a tiny iron bucket on each table. Water is served in an old fashioned coloured glass bottle fitted with a lead with metal catcher.¬†

The cupcakes are really nice. The best thing is you can have small portions and try different flavours. I ordered an ice cream, its called the masala chai. Its tastes as what it says. Very very interesting and highly recommended. I used to love scones but its very difficult to find good ones in Kolkata.¬†But now I am so happy to find such good scones here.¬†

Recommended for all dessert lovers. Especially go for the different varieties of mini cupcakes.

Pocket pinch --- really depends on how much you can control yourself but I don't think its a pricy place at all.

Definitely coming back and would like to try their afternoon tea spread one day for sure.

A bit over-hyped. The restaurant has a quaint girly get up and is a nice place to sit and chat with your friends. The staff is polite and very friendly. Though they are a little uninformed when asked for suggestions. The food variety is plenty...the deserts are few by the number of savoury dishes. The former tastes good but extremely low in portions. The cupcakes were really nice. I liked the range of toppings on them too. But the other deserts and sweets were pretty much ranging from average to worse! Two dishes turned out to be awful were the chocolate tart and the caramel mousse... The tart was floury and too liquid like. The mousse was runny as well. However, the thing that won my heart is the humility of the staff who asked our suggestions for improvement and omitted the price of the tart.  The things are low in quantity and high priced, but have good staff and pretty tasty food as well.

The interior of this place is very cute just like a little bakery cartoon shops. But it's a very small place hence doesn't have proper seating arrangements. There are less staff working hence you need to wait for long. The muffins aren't that great.the desserts are just pretty average. I would just end up saying that it didn't cope with my expectations.

I will give all the ratings to this place only because of its such a thoughtful name, wonderful interior, beautiful cutlers, and the bessstt cup cakes I ever had. But the outlet near Gariahat needs a lot more co-ordination among its stuffs. And behavior of few stuffs needs to be changed. Probably that is why I changes my place from Gariahat to Kashba. Yes, price is bit high, but again, once in a couple of months for those out of the world cup cakes is worth it. Happy. !

Located at southern avenue near cloakroom cafe and codfather after lake girls school. Ambience is good. As soon as you steps in, the bell rings and you enters the fairyland. Sitting arrangements are nice with fairytale motif. Small chairs and cosy sofas. Guys are friendly and attentive and they serves you water in 'Witch' s Potion Bottle' lol.. Must try omlette, hot chocolate and nutella cupcakes. Apart from that cappuchino and platters are good. Budget friendly and also worthy of spending sometime with your buddies or with your special some one. Looking forward to visit again. :)

The first thing that comes to mind when you visit this place is cute! Its a quaint little place located in the new foodie's haven - Southern Avenue. The place is a bit cramped but you don't mind as you are instantly teleported to your childhood once you step in. 
           The waiters were very helpful as to suggesting what to have so we settled for 2 espressos and 2 sandwiches. The chicken club sandwich is a must-try as it hit just the right spots. The espressos were perfectly brewed. As the cafe is famous for its cupcakes, we ended the meal with a cinnamon apple cupcake which was the highlight of the evening. I devoured the cupcake with childish glee. 

Hoping to try out the other items some time soon!

This is probably the cutest place one can ever go to. Hidden in the adorable corners of the residential Southern Avenue, Mrs. Magpie is a fun outlet of class and comfort. You get the feeling you're attending a little girls tea party with all her stuffed toys, With the cute tea sets and the delicious cup cakes. I had the after eight cup cake and the Earl Grey tea. The cup cake was good and had the exact taste of after eight. The other cupcakes and cakes look brilliant and have a good finish. Its a good place to go to read a book and have some tea or coffee. It has a fun kiddish theme infused with some French cafe influences considering the light french music.

Was a lovely experience. It was my younger kid's birthday and she had a ball. The place gives you the feeling of being transported into an English small town cafeteria. Was expecting to bump into Ms. Marple any minute. Only dampener is the location. But you know what, you've got to earn a sampler of Mrs. Magpie

And finally I made it to this place(Not a perfect time to drop in, especially when the outlet is preparing itself to pack up for the day) .Mrs magpie transposes you to the sugar house of your dreams; it makes you feel like Alice,with its tiny chairs and tables.  And even tinier spoons and saucers. The decor is commendable and accurate! Coming to the food, Mrs magpie is probably the best place for sweet lovers of the city! Here was our menu and verdict for each:
1. Tiny frosted cupcakes:amazing collection.8-ish and cream and cheese were the best!
2.raspberry yoghurt with apricot:yet another bang on dessert and the tiny Lil pot !oh so cute!
3.bacon and chicken sandwich: great balance of taste and texture
   Meat platter:soggy burgers nd a turn off
4.chicken pot pie: definitely one of the things I l order the next time too !
Shepherds pie :nor the best in town, the smell was a Lil harsh on the nostrils.
5. Chocolate pudding: absolute no-no. The smell and taste of uncooked cooking oil would repel you(no wonder we couldn't finish it)
6. Cold coffee and cappuccino: above average..and well blended
  Hot chocolate:less of hot chocolate, more of a cup of melted dark chocolate

Mrs Magpie is surely there on my list for future visits. The cupcakes and the cuteness of the place is adorable!
Cheerios! :D

Cute is the word for this place,though it has a difficult location.
But the moment you enter inside, your olfactory centres will feel delighted.
The interiors are well placed and adequately spaced, and I loved those tiny creatures they make out of fondant as well as the baby muffins.
However, its little on the expensive side, but its alright to treat yourselves once in a while without really caring about the money!

Only drawback would be its location, otherwise I had an awesome evening here. One must try to taste all the offerings, especially the hot chocolate pudding along with rich chocolate icecream & the baked fish pie..

Afternoon tea after shopping expedition or just meeting friends to catch up on gossip, Mrs Magpie is a just the right place for you.  They have an extensive menu of sandwiches and light snacks, although some items may not be listed.  I love their mini cupcakes that one can eat without feeling guilty about diet or lack of exercise.  It is not an expensive place (about Rs 300/person) and it gets crowded during evening hours. Service is nice and the staff is generally friendly.

The only negative part is seating that is eye catching, but not comfortable.

Ms. Magpie has become a sort of sensation among the younger generation of foodies in Calcutta. A petite caf√© located near southern avenue, it is the perfect place to go for afternoon tea with friends. The place boast many delicious savories from the quiche and shepherds pie to the chicken cheddar puff. The scones here are also very good when served piping hot. The coffees and teas here are pretty good though nothing exceptional, but the small biscuit accompanying the drink is delicious. Of the cupcakes, the lemony white, baileys and connisteur are good but I am not a fan of the after 8-ish.
The place is always jam-packed after 5:30 so it's best to go a little after 5. The staff is always kind. The only complaint I have with them is that they don't know the order to serve food in. Cupcakes should always served last and the drinks should accompany the scones... Not be served afterwards. 
Other than that, the place is a wonderful eat and an absolute MUST for any foodie

‚ÄòAlice in wonderland‚Äô, ‚Äòa doll‚Äôs house‚Äô, ‚Äòfairy tale‚Äô, ‚Äòdainty‚Äô and ‚Äòpretty‚Äô are some of the words that have now been made synonymous with the not-so-new-anymore caf√© named ‚ÄúMrs. Magpie‚Äù. Also, one can hardly spot a review that does not encompass at least one fancy adjective to emphasize on just how ‚Äòcute‚Äô the place and its offerings are.

Visiting this place for the first time however, I expected to feel nothing less like what Hansel and Gretel must have felt on witnessing a cottage made of gingerbread in that ill-fated forest. The initial reaction was quite good with the cherry blossoms wallpaper, an array of pastel shades that covered every inch of the d√©cor while painted thermocol eggs kept under the glass of the table tops fascinated us to no end. My tour was going really well right until I proceeded to take a seat in one of the sofas. The cushion covers were so dirty and full of stains that even the colorful prints on them couldn‚Äôt hide the grime. They were also not very comfortable to sit on. Brushing that jarring thought aside and hoping to focus more on the food, we decided on what we wanted to eat and placed our orders.

Our orders comprised of a Chicken Salad sandwich, a platter of Chicken Sliders, a Cappuccino, a single shot Espresso, and an After 8-ish, MushiMushi and Baileys liqueur cupcakes. The server who came to take our order was well-mannered but was a bit too soft spoken to be audible in the hullabaloo expected of a caf√© on a busy Saturday evening.

My first verdict regarding the mini cupcakes would honestly be: they are not at all worth the 40 bucks being shelled out for them. They were TINY, bite-sized and tasted quite ordinary except for the flavored cream on top. After-8, a product of Nestle, are mint chocolates which never fails to remind me of the taste of toothpaste on chocolate (the idea itself is repelling). The cupcake had just that; a swirl of the minty chocolate cream with a honey bee on top.Going by the reviews, this one was supposed to have dark chocolate on it. Anyway, I should‚Äôve known by the name what was in store for me. While personally, I may be biased against mint mixed chocolates but any fan of those should definitely try this out. The MushiMushi had plain sweet chocolate on it but the Baileys cupcake was the best of the three, with its bitter, liqueur filled dark chocolate cream.

Moving on to the food, the salad sandwich was served cold and had a nice filling of chicken, mayo and Chinese cabbages. The sliders tasted the best, with its flavorsome patty and cheese which left me wishing for their bigger sized counterparts. The dishes were served with a helping of potato chips but there wasn‚Äôt a dip or a sauce accompanying it, which I felt was a letdown. The coffee was absolutely fine and was served with a minuscule cinnamon and almond rusk cookie.

Before coming out, we bought a couple of chocolate loaves, priced at 20 rupees each. They were soft, buttery, and were filled with bits of nuts and chocolate chips and tasted completely delicious! Now if only those somewhat pretentious cupcakes were as good.
On a recent visit, I had the Ham and Cheese Quiche and Coffee Caramel Custard. Both were extremely well made. The quiche had a thin but firm pastry crust with a generous filling of ham bits and cheese and the custard was soft with a fine balance of the sweetness from caramel and bitterness from coffee.

The best cup-cakes, to say the least, amazing ham-quiche, onion-parsley sandwich and mutton sandwich; but the hot chocolate trumps everything. It is a rich, smooth, thick journey of deligght, ecstasy and bliss, only to want even more!

Apart from the food, one must visit this cozy corner just for the ambiance and decor!

The Mrs magpie cafe is colourful, vibrant and cozy. The cafe is beautifully decorated with marzipan animals and cakes as decorations. We had cold coffee, vanilla shake and chocolate shake for drinks, ham and cheese quiche, ham and mushroom puff and  chicken and cheddar puff for savouries and sweet and salty, marshmallow, nutty praline, mushi mushi, after eight and peanut butter for cupcakes. All were delicious. It's a fun place to go with friends and family. They have something for all age groups. I defiantly recommend it.

Mrs. Magpie is a cute little patisserie and caf√® with chic indoors and a fairy tale kind of ambience.Definitely the brainchild of a female!If you are around Southern Avenue or Vivekananda Park,you should come here once.The majority of the guests are teenage couples or college goers who finds this place quite enchanting owing to their current state of mind!Hahaha!
The service here is prompt as expected from any other fast running caf√® with cover for 15-20 people maximum.The cutlery & crockery is too cute to be true and the entire place feels like a long lost sister of Theobroma,Mumbai.
Coming to the food,whenever I come I order for their cupcakes which are the best in Calcutta.We don't have so many good cupcake places here and this one is damn impressive.Their Shepherd's Pie is really good and is baked in small tarts!You should try their Darjeeling or Earl Grey too.I love the ginger biscotti!Some of the best cupcakes are-Marshmallow,Bailey's,Nutty Praline,Cointreau,Marzipan,After 8 and Apple Cinnamon.
A caf√® where  you will feel comfortable chatting with your loved ones and sipping a cup of coffee or taking a bite of cute cupcakes!

The one thing that makes me go back to Mrs. Magpie is their out of the world hot chocolate. Apart from that, they have some lip smacking sandwiches and other items to go along with it. The interiors are very sweet and bright with those beautiful walls, a perfect place for kids. All I can say is, after a hard day's work, an hour or so spent at Mrs. Magpie lifts my spirit and I leave happy and satisfied.

I had heard a lot of good things about this place so I went there with my wife today. I got inside and quite liked the bright ambience which goes well with the name. I had to wait for a while to get a table. We had ordered for a mushroom quiche, cup cakes and cappuccinos.  The quiche was not bad, the cup cakes were a little sweeter than what we would have liked it to be and the cappuccinos which took quite some time to come were cold.  Over all I found the place to be over hyped and average.

Ah hah! This is my most favourite coffee shop in the city. I am very much emotionally attached to this place. I love the ambience, decoration and every possible thing in earth about this restaurant. I have come here for innumerable number of times. Their cute cupcakes, super delicious cakes attract me again and again. I love their cherry and cream, marshmallow, mango and cream (which you get only during the summer) and lemon vanilla flavours in the cupcakes. They make very cute marzipan figures which I often use during my baking. On the other hand, they offer a good range of all day breakfast, their tea and coffee ranges a wide variety too. I miss their shorter spread of breakfast which has stopped now. I also love the ham and cheese quiche and their chocolate pudding. Once we had ordered a cake for my sister's anniversary. That was so cute, tasty and wonderful. I love Mrs. Magpie. I will come here again and again and forever. If you haven't been here yet, just go. Happy Dining! :)

The cutest cafe that I have visited in my 20+ years in Kolkata. The place is famous for cupcakes. You will get a wide variety of cupcakes with colourfully decorated edible toppings and jellylike fillings in the cupcakes. I visited this place after being recommended by a friend and I was in awe of the place. The interiors are beautifully decorated and gave me a home-like feeling. We had ordered 5 flavours of cupcakes, Lemon iced tea, cold coffee and coronation chicken sandwich. Needless to say, the food was superb. The lip-smacking cupcakes will make me visit the cafe over and over again. Even the sandwich had a lovely flavour and taste. The amount of the dishes were enough for an individual. You can happily visit this place without much penny in your pocket. Anytime recommended for cupcake lovers.

Went there in the first week after it opened its doors. Overwhelming experience. I showed off the impressive cute ambience and soulful cupcakes with pride to my friends from other cities. After multiple visits and waiting in queues for a table at the always overcrowded Mrs. Magpie, I have to admit that the place is taking its admirers for granted. One has to wait for a good time for someone to take the orders only to realise that most of the items on the menu are unavailable or off the shelf (even in the peak hours). Alarm bells for the place if they don't want to lose out on their admirers!

This place according to me is like those chocolate and cake houses I used to read about in my childhood fairy tales. Hats off to the management for the decor of this place. It is simply brilliant. The pink walls,the little wall hangings,the cute little plants on the tables and the multicoloured sofas together gives this place a very joyful look and appearance. The same view goes for their food too. I have almost tried most of their cupcakes,thanks to my other foodie friend

Had a lovely meal the other day comprising of hot chocolate, scones, cupcakes and sandwiches. Was filled to the brim. The overall ambience is fine but the seating arrangement needs improvement. The people managing this place are thoroughly confused about a lot of things but mainly the manner in which they would cater to and accommodate all their guests which leads to chaos very often. I had no problem sharing my table with a couple who had been waiting for too long but there were many others waiting cluelessly. I give it 3.5/5

Well Mrs Magpie has been on my wishlist for like forever! But I never actually got around visiting the place because 1) I thought I would be way over my student budget and 2) I couldnt locate the exact place where it was. Well I  finally got the guts to try the place out and looked it up on my gps, and what can I say...IT IS THE BEST!
The decor of the place is somewhat like the dream doll house of a 6year old but it can makes adults (even men), fall in love with it. The pretty flowery wallpapers, the soft fairytale lighting and the cute chairs and tables all add up to a perfect cute cafe atmosphere. 
Now the food. They offer cupcakes , finger sandwiches, scones, coffee , tea and a variety of veg n non veg savouries along with other stuff. The cupcakes are really very delicately made and delicious! So are the sandwiches. Also I think its very very pocket friendly when you are hanging out with a group of friends. And even a place girls would love to go on dates. The coffee there is yum and less pricey compared to our stereotypical ccd's. The cupcakes are in a variety of flavoured frosting which will leave you wanting more. 
The staff is friendly and polite. 
I can bet once you go there, you will want to visit again really soon. <3

This is the perfect place if you are in search for a lovely venue for all those long adda sessions and loud gossips or a nice date, which also serves you some really delicious cuisine along with excellent beverages ! The decor is really CUTE I must say, with Disney like decorations even though the walls are pink ! :P I went with a friend for some mid semester relaxation and we started with their cold coffee which was truly appetizing. Then we tried out some of their cupcakes, for which Mrs Magpie is best known; namely the Sweet n Salty Chocolate, the Marshmellow n Chocolate, the Marmy Vanilla and the Cherry and Cream cupcakes, all of which were so CUTE that I didn't feel like ruining them; and they were equally tasty and savoring, which just melted in my mouth; just wish they weren't so tiny! You can sit and chat for as long as you want. The service is extremely fast and satisfying. We are definitely going back again to gorge some other items from the menu and some more cupcakes ! ¬†Pictures coming shortly !

Being a huge dessert fanatic, it would be hard not to like Mrs. Magpie. Its a quaint little place bearing great resemblance to tea parties mentioned in Enid Blyton's books. Even the kettles they serve the tea in is absolutely vintage. The cupcakes are tiny, but very taste. A few personal favorites are marshmallow, nutty praline, cherry n cream cheese, chocolate hazelnuts. The cupcakes are the main attraction, but other confectionaries are equally tasty.
They also make elaborate birthday cakes and deliver it to the house if asked. The cakes are very pretty and perfect for children's birthday parties.
Be sure to like marzipan, as all their sweet dishes are incomplete without it.

A latest addition: since winter is here and there are few who don't like hot chocolate, Mrs.Magpie hot chocolate is one of the best, gooey, chocolatey substance my tongue has ever tasted! And it gets served in a such a pretty cup!

A cosy garden-style cafe, minus the actual garden, Mrs. Magpie draws customers for its high tea offerings. The Lemon Ice Tea is a refreshing drink although, the milkshakes are pretty good as well. The little cupcakes are a must-have. I specially like the After 8-ish and Baileys mini cupcakes. Their chocolate mousse was very good but on yesterday's visit I found that they have discontinued it. If you're comfortable in a pink room that looks like a doll house, give this place a go.

The outlook of Mrs. Magpie is that of a quaint English caf√©. Some of the dishes on the menu aren't available at times and that does put you off. Anyway, If you've got a sweet tooth, then have the Marzipan cupcake, Cream cheese cupcake and Marshmallow cupcake. They're amazing! Among savouries you could try out the shepherd's pie. The lemon ice tea and choco shake are good beverages. Overall a good experience. Cheers!

Points for decor only...! "Cuteness"is at its best..! Cupcakes we get here are cute to look at but tastes nothing so great...! Savouries were ok...! Two things they need to improve is the "menu card" and the small bucket in which  spoons and forks were kept.. the pages of menu were clipped on a small board and suprisingly the pages were torn, second comes the small bucket, it was so light n spoons n forks were too heavy for it that it kept falling in each tables..!  Just an ok experience...

Too old for the fairy tales??!!! I don't think so... Visit this place and immediately get transported to the good old charm of the classic fairy tale like decor... The glass dispensers are very pretty... Once you get over the pretty decor that's when you start gorging on the excellent food that they have to offer. The cupcakes together with their various flavoured icing are a real treat. However they just might want to improve on the quantity that they serve. The mini cupcakes are just tooo mini and before you could start enjoying the flavor it's already finished. But overall it's a must visit for all the food lovers out there.

a very cute place.....it reminds you of your favourite bedtime tales ;)cup cakes couldn't be any cuter
they offer varieties...............and nutty praline is the best, in my opinion.
though my bestie would say apple-cinnamon is the best ;)taste and better have your own opinions.

yes, if you consider the proportions and the prices, then these come as overpriced.

but, one can surely drop in there once in a while :)

p.s. their "cup of hot chocolate" is to die for......it is a must everytime i visit

This one gets a tick on all fronts from mouthwatering food to efficient service and lovely setting. The mini cupcakes were delicious, with a special
Mention for the Sweet/salty chocolate one and the marshmallow cupcake. The fruit shortbread biscuits are the perfect accompaniment with tea as was the almond cake. Even the free cookie served with tea was spot on. The apple
Cinnamon cupcake was a bit on the dry side. They have a huge range of cupcakes and food so will definitely be back here to plough through more of the menu!

Tucked in a corner near Vivekananda park, Mrs. Magpie is by far the cutest place I have ever been to. From the moment one enters to the sound of the door bell, to the simple minimalistic yet classy decor of the Victorian era. This place seems to come out of a children's playbook. A for Ambience. A+ for food. The only negative is that the waiting staff are not very trained. But it isn't a deal breaker. Make it a point to try their shepherd's pie and the chocolate pudding.

Simply loved it. Everything is so cute and tidy over there! Though I must say the cup cakes are extremely small compared to the price, I would also like to add it didn't matter much since the whole thing pleased me more than enough. Chicken slider is awesome (I really didn't expect it to be that good) ! They also have a great collection of fabulous sandwiches. Staff there is extremely well-behaved and helpful. I am definitely going back to taste their other items and to be pampered again. ;)

A true patisserie and a cafe....a cafe that changed the way we looked at cafes. Whenever we think of cafes all that we can visualize are the typical American cafes...specifically the ones that u find in Manhattan....very big, extremely efficient and outlets that sell ok coffees. But Mrs. Magpie is a quant, cute cafe with an old world charm. Where everything is happy and pink. The whole cafe is very dainty, very girly and happy. the waiters are extremely friendly.
I chose a salmon sandwich, a ham and cheese quiche and a biiig mug of their signature hot chocolate.
The salmon in the sandwich was a very good and if I remember correctly the bread had some  white-ish cheese spread smeared on top of it. However the bread wasn't abs fresh. It was a little crumbly. The ham and cheese quiche was spot on with a considerable amount of ham and cheese in the pastry casing and grilled in the oven. There is nothing to say about the hot chocolate. Its a thick gooey mug of goodness. Sinful to the core but what the heck ;) I am not that find of cupcakes so I didn't go for it. 
The next time I need some sugar ruxh , I know where to head to for sure ;)

Yet again a contemporary bakery in the land of authenticity.
What a revolution brought in by the cupcakes! Though went here for a proper lunch and not just desserts. This place was packed and crowded to it maximum capacity. The staff is majorly inefficient and incapable of handling a crowd. A few are also unaware of the dishes on the menu. 
Coming to the food, the veg and chicken pot pie were really yummy. The sandwiches fresh and tasted very homely. The strawberry milkshake was amazing and refreshing. The iced tea need a lot of improvement. The cupcakes are the main attraction here but for someone like me I prefer the thing to taste better than it looks. The cupcakes looked yummy but weren't up to the mark taste wise. They need to broaden the flavours too. 
The cupcakes at rouge are so much better than the ones here!

Okay. So yesterday my friends and I decided to drop in to this place.
The ambience gives you  that typical fairytale feeling. 
Coming to the food, we ordered 5 cupcakes (mushy mushy, sweet and salty, after 8'ish , marshmallow and baileys ) the cupcakes were a sinful treat. Looked beautiful and tasted heavenly.
Then we ordered for hot chocolate - it was judt perfect. 
Then comes ham and cheese quiche - the top layer was a bit too hard but overall tasted nice.
Then shepherd's pie where i found only molecules of chicken. Was a bad option
 Then comes pesto chicken sandwich which none of us liked.
And finally -pot pie which was okaish.
Overall, it was a good experience. 
Cupcakes are the showstopper .:)

Mrs. Magpie is one coffee shop with one of the cutest interiors. With a lovely, cheerful ambience this place has to offer some great coffee and delicious cupcakes... And my favourite is the Chocolate Hazelnut... I personally feel the price is a tad high but who doesn't want to taste those cute looking delicious cupcakes?? However, one thing to mention, my worst experience was when I ordered Chicken and Mayo Sandwiches. The quality was not at all good, the price was too much and you can hardly feel that you ate them at all.

Mrs. Magpie gives the look of a quaint English caf√©. They serve savouries and sweet delicacies. The marshmallow cupcake, marshmallow marzipan and cherry cream and cheese cupcake are a must have. Among the savouries try the shepherd's pie. Ice tea and cold coffee among beverages are a good choice. Good place to visit with a few friends. Have fun!

Very well baked must say. The cup cakes taste heavenly. But their looks are even better with sweet little flower motifs... Absolutely to fall in love with. Would like to come back with some more time in hand.

One of the cutest places you will ever find, Mrs Magpie is a small, cozy cafe located in a lane in Golpark. The interiors seem straight out of a Disney princess movie, with all the pink and the adorable wall accessories.¬†Keeping up with the overall ambiance, water was served to us in corked colored bottles.¬†The cupcakes....! There were two of us, and Maha, my partner in crime in almost all my food (mis)adventures ordered a a marmy vanilla cupcake while I chose the ¬†lemony white chocolate one. The cupcakes were delectable. They looked so charming that it almost felt like a sin to bite them let alone devour them. But that's exactly what we did, and, god it tasted good.¬†We also had a vanilla milkshake (yes, yes I know, as she pointed out, this is something babies drink) and a cold coffee. And club sandwiches. Which were good, if slightly overstuffed (now that can be a good thing for many, but I love my food slightly on the lighter side). ¬†Continuing the quirk, the bill was served in a handmade box, and it is this very, almost childlike glee that you feel after coming out, makes Mrs Magpie stand out from the ever increasing crowd of cafes in Kolkata.

I love Mrs.Magpie. The interior is so cute and girly. 
The cupcakes are adorable here. It's a nice place to just chill out and have some fresh iced tea. The prices are on the lower side as well. The only complaint I have is that the   place is too small, hence it's always crowded and people are always waiting outside for a seat. That's pretty annoying and can sometimes make you want to leave. Apart from that, the place is really good.

The Darjeeling tea is easily best in the price range (in fact might well be the best, in Kolkata Cafe scene), the coffee, above average and lightest on the pocket in this class of cafe.... The stuff, wonderfully friendly and polite, never an unsavory moment! All thumbs up!

Decor: Well decorated, loved the glass bottles in which they served water n d bell which hangs at the door.
Staff: Polite n friendly.
Ambience: Good crowd, a great place to take your date as well as family gatherings.
Food: We had the shepherd's pie and caramel custard. The pie was kind of tiny but tasted great.
The custard was a sheer delight with the caramel sauce having a good consistency n balance. The texture was perfect. 
Good, authentic, pocket friendly food..
A big thumbs up from me and eager to visit again!! :)

I have been here only once, on the Maha Ashtamee afternoon during last Durga Puja. The moment I entered, the ambience took me to some western country where these types of outlets are very common. Executives are quite helpful and well behaved. Menu has definitely a new smell. Lots if various snacks and sandwiches. Interesting offerings of dessert. Fine quality and taste. Costly but worth. Service was slightly late but I liked what they served. No much rush in such a nice place surprised me. Probably most of the people in the city are not aware of its existence. But once people know about it, I believe they need to increase their accommodation; the most part of the floor is a free walk area! I would like to visit again and again.

Lately it seems like a regular practice at mrs magpie that u will not get anything which is there on their menu ! So I have a simple question ... Why give a menu to the customers if nothing is available ???? 
Just because  u have opened a new branch ( mrs magpie bristo ) doesn't mean the service at the original place for which the name became a brand will get neglected and loose customers.

Certainly the cutest cake shop I have ever visited. This was in my wish list for such a long time. A place which is very near to my home but never managed to visit. Anyways I visited this place and am quite happy.
This place will give you a "feel good" vibe as soon as you enter the place. Wonderfully decorated, from chairs n tables to each cutlery, everything was super cute.
Coming to the food quality , food quality is really nice but the quantity of the mini cup cakes are " too mini " in size. They could have made them a bit bigger in size.
The staffs are well trained and behaved.
Things tried are marmy vanilla,cherry and cream cheese, chocolate hazlenut, cinamon apple, lemon chocolate, nutty praline, cold coffee and strawberry milk shake.
I look forward to try the rest items soon.
Ambiance - 5/5

Location : 570, Lake Terrace Road Extension , ( very nice location but lil inside not road side)
Services style: was awsm no comments in that
Service time: its took vry much time (around 30mint) just for a sandwich & 2 cups tea.
Parking : available
Food : value for money.
Stuff behaviour : nice n trained


Kolkata does not have many nice cafes and probably that's the reason Mrs. Magpie stands out. Indeed nice ambience and dcor. This place is cute , full of variety of cupcakes normal hangout place like ccd or bristo but lil different n unique at kolkata.
However, it seemed to be a busy place and was a bit noisy. There was only one table left when we went but b4 us some1 took that place n we had to wait around 15 mints. Aftr 15mint we got place to sit but there were people standing next to ours to be seated, which was very uncomfortable and then there were more people waiting outside.

The tart was just about ok. Serving style of coffee n tea was really unique, not like normal xyz cafe. (This thing actually impressed me n my partner ) We did not try the cakes, but they looked nice. Had 1 peanut butter cup cake which is nice but expected more by its looks.
You cn Give it a try as it does offer something new and different, but keep your expectations low. Wen i visited restroom was out of order & thats pissd me off. may b its our bad luck that we came on wrong day. ?but i think thay should fix that soon, as there was no washroom near by.
Nway its worth it, to give one try if u hav enough time in ur hand. (? no buddy knws u might get lucky n cn use fixd restroom ??)

Well there is no shortage of places where one can relish foods like moghlai, Chinese or Mexican items, but few places which serve sweet yummy grandmas‚Äô cakes, pastries, sandwiches, cookies etc. These are the items which will take us back to the school days when mouthful of sweet cookies make the whole day lighter and better. Not only toddlers, young children but also grownups gorge these deserts as they say sweets de stress you. Now the question is that where you will find the same loving touch with great food as you used to receive from your grandmas in the good old days. And the answer is Mrs. Magpie. Cupcakes are my favourites among many of their offerings. There are mushi mushi, apple brandy, nutty praline, chocolate hazelnut; on sandwiches are veg coronation, chicken salad sandwich, chicken club sandwich, mutton sandwich etc. Sometimes I prefer their special afternoon tea such as which is relaxing. Desserts are my weakness too so I love to try out chocolate pudding, cream cheese brownie, walnut brownie, vanilla custard, coffee caramel custard. Tea has always been my weakness so whenever I am there I order different types of teas such as Darjeeling tea, Assam tea, green tea etc.

Located at the posh area of Southern Avenue, the moment you enter the cafe, the aroma of fine confectionery entices to further explore those cute looking sweet delicacies that are displayed right before you. Though its a small place, the tables are arranged in such a way that would not make one feel congested. The cafe is very beautifully decorated, pink is the dominant colour, the whole look is very pretty with floral painted pillars and colorful glass window panes, pink sofas and white iron chairs with again pink cushions. Tastefully lit up as well.¬†
¬† I tried their triple chocolate brownie, a sweet dish I'm very fussy about, and only Flurys had been able to please me with their's before Mrs. Magpie. Now I find Mrs. Magpie far better. Loved their cup cakes as well, tried out egg, onion and parsley sandwich, which didn't cater much to my taste. It's a nice place for a quick bite especially if your craving for some sweet little bites after a tiresome day. Trust me their sweet dishes are drool worthy. Also liked the hospitality of the staff. Moderately priced, this cafe is a must try.

I like this place more for its environment and decor and less for its food. Yes, the cupcakes are good but there are hardly any variety. Would love to see more varieties of them in the near future. I don't like the scones here since half of the times they aren't warm enough. And also they can do a lot of work on their quiche and ratatouille. The staff s really friendly and helpful and the the hot chocolate scores quite high on my lust list. The finger sandwiches are really good even though here as well I would like to see some variety, possibly various choices of breads maybe?¬†The chocolate milkshake I tried was quite good here and frothy enough for my liking. I love this place and all the times I have come here, but I would be a happier soul if there were more varieties on the menu :)

I KNOW ONE THING FOR SURE. WHENEVER I'VE ENTERED THIS PLACE ALL I'VE DONE IS ADORRRRREEEDDDD IT. THE MAIN DOORS OF MAGPIES BRINGS OUT THE BABY IN ME. COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT CALCUTTA HAS SUCH A CUTE ENGLISH FAIRY TALE TYPES CAFES AND BAKERY JOINTS. THE MOST CUTEST OF ALL EVER. AS N WHEN YOU'LL ENTER MAGPIES, THE STORY OF HANSEL AND GRETEL WILL STRIKE YOUR MEMORY CHORDS. DO TRY THE AFTER EIGHT AND MARSHMALLOWS CUPCAKES THERE AND EVEN THE ALMOND BROWNIES.

Ambience is too god. A small place but very cozy owing to the cute decor. Theme based caf√©, if i may call it. The sandwiched were satisfactory. The cupcakes looked promising but weren't very great. That was pretty disappointing. They don't keep pastries. That would probably boost up footfall. So would some english breakfast on the menu.

I have been in here with my friend last month but the ambience out there is kind of girly and pink ( ah my eyes it hurts) the location of this place is kind of awkward. This place just looks like a doll house (not recommend for guys). Now lets talk about food well I had a spinach and feta puff well it was average but the portions were kind of miniature. And my friend has a cappuccino and a marshmallow muffin or something like that ( I didn't remember its name) but nevermind my overall experienceof this place is okay.

After reading so many reviews about Mrs. Magpie & from the hype that it created, I finally decided to give a visit to this place. Although, I have already come in contact with them when I purchased Cup Cakes from them in a food promotional event this January known as "Khaibar Pass". I had a huge huge expectation from them after going through the reviews & seeing the pictures over the internet, but sorry to say I was highly dissapointed.¬† I`ll state out the reasons one by one :-
1. The entrance is nice whereby a bell rings when one enters. But other than that, I didn`t find any special interior decoration that will blow me out. Yes, its kinda cute, but nothing special. This may not be a huge factor while giving it a rating, but I thought of mentioning it here. Moreover there is a serious space crunch.
2. The worst part of my experience is this point. I went there with my wife on 28/02/2015. We kept on sitting till 5 mins before a waiter came to clean our table & attend us. During our entire stay, we were not offered water at all. This was a very bad gesture. Its the minimum that even a road side stall also offers.
3. We ordered Hot Chocolate, Coffee Caramel Pudding & Chicken n Cheddar Puff. since the last item wasn`t available, we opted for Chicken n Mushroom with Cheese Puff. Best point first, the Pudding was marvelous & full marks to its taste. Now coming to the other two items, the Hot Chocolate was very thin according to me. I have consumed much thicker Hot Chocolate from other stores. Though the Puff wasn`t bad in taste, but the stuffing inside was so little that we hardly felt it on our tongue. 
4. Next we decided to take some parcels with us. We ordered all the different varieties of Cup Cakes available on that day, some Marzipans, Assorted Cookies & Cheese Scones. Out of all the Cup Cakes only Marshmallow Cup Cakes were excellent. I didn`t like any of the other varieties.¬† The amount of stuffing & taste variation is by far much better in other bakeries, though I won`t mention their names here. Previously I purchased only the Marshmallow Cup Cakes from the food promotional event mentioned earlier, that`s why I thought of visiting the place. The Marzipans tasted exactly like a Cashew Sweet available in any sweet shop. What I want to mean is that there is no point of putting so many bucks for getting the same taste as that of a sweet available in half of its price. The scones were very dry & had very little taste of Cheese.

But yes, still I`ll like to state that the designs on their cakes are mind blowing & fabulous.¬† The reasons I am giving it 2.5 ratings are their cute designs, Pudding & Marshmallow Cup Cakes.

So many people wrote so many positive points on them, I donno why I was unable to find most of them myself.¬† May be on that day, something went wrong, & as a result I couldn`t agree on the taste of most of the items. But Point No. 2 can`t be made excuse of at any cost.

Very very good food....
But a bit over priced...
The cupcakes r awesome...
And the salmon sandwich,Cantonese sandwiches r far from just better...but not the best...
To conclude a good place to hangarnd but not so often...

Today I visited the place and believe me the quality has deteriorated like anything. Even the speciality that is the hot Chocolate was just pathetic. Seriously this much drop in quality is not expected.

Well its not what i was expecting it is ? So m not so sure what to write.. but i can say its a big taste in small package. I think the quantity is way too less and kind of didnt satisfy the hungry stomach.. they can have a provision for the taste savoury heart and also the hungry stomach.. can work a bit more on the menu

So I've been frequenting Mrs. Magpie quite often. An implied rating of 4/5 is what I've closely maintained. However, the other day, we entered and got a place to sit. Now begins the fun. The Table - Dirty (Check!), No one to be called to have it cleaned (Check!) ; the best part - along comes what some may call a trainee asking us to step out ! Apparently there were people waiting for their turn and I'm thinking that was something which is usually implied ! There was no one at the door to apprise us of the simple fact that there was a line ! (Back to the table), we demanded to talk to the manager and the latter, instead of taking this on himself, reiterated we wait outside (Naturally we didn't !)....The words "Hospitality'' and ''etiquette'' should almost rhyme (or so i thought), but i saw no semblance of it here. I can simply go on but i think im just about done wasting my words here ! I'd rate nothing short of a negative on whatever for the humiliation brought onto us (particularly in a societal format !!) .....Deplorable !!!

Tiny place, with beautiful decor. It gives out a fairy tale vibe. The cupcakes are amazing, especially after-8ish and peanut butter. I also love the marzipan, which is soft and sweet and melts in your mouth. The marzipan cupcakes are simply delicious, especially when you bite in and the gooey centre flows out. Although a little pricey, the amazing taste makes up for it. The servers are really helpful too.

I heard about this place so much that I made it a point to drop in the next time I visited Calcutta. I went with another of my foodie friend who assured me that all the hype was justified. The first thing that will attract your attention is the overdose of pink everywhere which somehow adds ample cuteness to this place. Otherwise, there is a nice "English Cafe" feel all over. Come with friends, take your time, enjoy your coffee with tasty little cupcakes. My favourite item here is the scone which I'd say is a must try. The sandwiches are are also quite good. And you get all of these without hurting your pocket. Highly recommended.

The only thing that comes to your mind wheb you visit this place is "awww". Its a cute and small place with the tiniest portions of cakes, pasteries and coffee cups. You would almost miss the place walking past it if not for the tiny bench outside mostly occupied by couples waiting for a seat inside. All in all a treat for your eyes and tongue.

I went to this place after hearing so much about it and I wasn't disappointed. Tucked away in the by lanes of an old residential road in south Calcutta. This place reminded me of old tea garden bungalows! We ordered tea and an array of cupcakes which were so pretty that I didn't want to touch them. Divine cupcakes... Every single one of them, especially the peanut butter and sweet and salted one. The savory items could have been better and there's tremendous scope for their service. All on all I loved it and will visit again soon.

This is a review only of the cup cakes as I have never been to the place or eaten any of the savouries. My daughter has always brought me the cup cakes back from work. They are the most amazing cup cakes I've ever had and believe me I've had cup cakes at  MAGNOLIA in New York...so I know what I'm talking about. Most cup cakes are dry, with a disgusting butter cream squiggle or squirt on top that makes you gag. But why am I going on about 'most cup cakes'?? Mrs. Magpie where were you all my life?? Each cup cake is a work of art. There is a marzipan topped one which has a thick coating of marzipan base and marzipan flowers, toadstools and leaves, then there is a peanut butter one, a salty caramel, a mint chocolate, a ginger cream, a lemon cream and many, many more. The cakes are soft, gooey, cream and jam filled and then on top there is the very generous topping. Delicious and delectable! So much effort goes into each piece! Has to be seen to be believed! I salute the baker and the designer.

This review was long due for Mrs Magpie. I stay in Gurgaon but was celebrating my parent's 25th anniversary in Kolkata. Seeing the ratings of Mrs Magpie I decided to order the cake for the event from Mrs. Magpie. I had pre-decided on a cake design so contacted them with the same. The staff there coordinated very well on the phone giving me suggestions about which flavours to choose, how to replicate it, and also online payment option provided by them was a great way to ease up all my tensions on the bakery front.
They delivered the cake on time to the required venue of the party and the cake was an exact replica of the photo that I had sent them. Everyone enjoyed the cake and were amazed by its design. Thank you Mrs. Magpie for making the day special for us.

Very nice and cute interior. Food quality-can't complain about their cupcakes. Cupcakes are too cute to eat. This was my second visit as most of the time I find the place full. Quantity of food is less compared to price. The mini cupcakes are bite size. Sandwiches are also small in size. Last time I had Shepherd's pie which was tasty but again price wise too small. Loved the cookies served with cappuccino. But didn't like their pizza. Ordered pepperoni pizza, it was a thin crust one but something was lacking. Found it little hard & dry. Other than that everything was just great.

Quaint & winsome - the first impression.
The awesome world of cupcakes is quietly tucked away in the bylanes of Southern Avenue.
Directions - Take the lane exactly opposite Basanti Devi College, walk straight, take the second left lane and there you are! Its at most a 3 minute walk from the main road.
It was the afternoon of Saraswati Puja and we (me & my college buds) decided on exploring this cute caf√©. I opened the door to this place and jingled my way in (literally; a jingle bell rests atop the door that greets customers with its jingling) to join my friends. Quickly, we got down to business and finalised on a Veg Quiche (pronounce as: qui-ssh), Triple Chocolate Brownie, Cream Cheese Brownie and Veg Pot Pie. Within minutes our orders were delivered. The look was sophisticated, tasting delicious. I was served a scoop of chocolate ice-cream which was equally commendable. If you're not a connoisseur with cupcakes and its likes, same as me, go for anything chocolate or cheese, always works. Next round, we ordered two chocolate hazelnuts and something (I'm pretty bad with names). Delivery was quick. The cupcake was so cute that I almost pitied myself for having to eat it. Cupcakes are their speciality items so its a must try.
Pocket Pinch: 625(includes Rs.25 service tax) for 4 people.
'Been there. Done that' tip: Never go for small. Their version of small = mini.

I love this place! The cupcakes are to die for (to a novice I'd recommend after eight and sweet and salty). The Bailey's cupcake is excellent for a rare treat. I'm also personally fond of the coronation sandwiches..though the English breakfast is a bit too heavy for a single person! The ambience and feel are on-point. If only the prices were more pocket friendly, I'd be recommending this little cosy nook to all students and youngsters!

Kolkata had been devoid of cafe culture for a long time! I have always found it difficult to locate a decent place (obviously except CCD!! been there like a million times! ¬†) to hang out, have a chat along with some quality savories by side !! Good to see its changing now a days!! ¬†Nice little hang out places are popping up here n there! And Ms Magpie is surely in the apex of those places!¬†

Situated in Lake Terrace Road, (u need to take a left from Purna Das Road just before WISE OWL if you are coming from Goalpark side) this cute little cafe is just the perfect place to spent time with your special one or just to hang out with friends! Marvelously decorated, with courteous staffs serving amazing delicacies this place gives you a feeling of those French Cafes situated in the streets of Paris you see in movies. The cute little cupcakes placed for display surely adds to the beauty and ethnicity of the ambiance!¬†
We ordered - Grilled chicken club sandwich, one cup cake with a cute teddy on top , one Americano and one Darjeeling tea! The Grilled chicken sandwich was marvelous with chunks of chicken, tomato, cheese, egg beautifully layered to perfection! The cupcake looked like a piece of art! Cute little choco-teddy sitting on the top staring at us! :) .. left a bit bad while cutting through its head :P ..... The muffin was heavy with choco-mint flavor! I had the tea! Served in a kettle along with a cookie! nice touch!! Amazing flavor of true Darjeeling leaves ¬†along with its signature aroma! Refreshing! The Americano was good too!¬†

Dunno when time flew by chitchatting, laughing, enjoying the tidbits, surrounded by a decent crowd and aroma of flavored tea, strong coffees and savories !
Do give a visit to this place to enjoy a pleasant evening with your special one or friends! Sometimes you may have to wait, as being a well known but relatively small place, it remains a bit crowded!¬†

This cute little cafe in southern avenue seems to be right out of a fairytale. The pretty as a picture decor have been well planned out right down to the very last detail. And the food.... I could go on and on. Mrs.Magpie maybe famous for its desserts, but I found the sandwiches and other titbits equally good. We ordered chicken pot pie, grilled chicken and cheddar sandwich( to which we added extra bacon). The sandwich was extraordinary. As for desserts, we had cream cheese brownie with rich chocolate and creamy vanilla. The name says it all. It was like having a slice of heaven. And the coffee caramel custard and vanilla nutmeg custard deserve special mention (Mrs. Magpie truly does excel in its delectable desserts). Also i couldn't resist ordering cupcakes. They looked so adorable. I plan on coming back here over and over again.

If you wanna visit one place that is made out of utmost love and passion, this is the one. 10/10 for the cleanliness. Every little thing from the napkins to the wallpaper are well thought and put together. Very cute decor and the ambiance compliments the food served here.
I had a choco chip tea cake, hazelnut cupcake, apple and cinnamon cupcake and my favorite the sweet and salty cupcake. It was all lip smacking.
The presentation was also good, though I wished that the service was a bit warm and welcoming like the rest of the place

If you can‚Äôt resist cravings for sweets, here is a perfect place to approach. The offerings of Mrs. Magpie are simply tempting; peanut butter, apple brandy, chocolate hazelnut, chicken salad sandwich, coffee caramel custard to name few. Also when my little nephew and nieces come I often take them to this place as they love to eat there, and needless to say this place has probably everything of their desire. Though I am not a very sweet loving person, but when it comes to Mrs. Magpie I make an exception. I like their lemony white chocolate, marshmallow, cream tea, cupcakes and many more. With that I also prefer their veg sandwiches, chicken club sandwiches, pasta chicken sandwiches. Their chocolate pudding, cream cheese brownie, walnut brownie, coffee caramel custard is sheer bliss. Sometimes I order their egg onion parsley, mutton sandwich, veg tart to get introduced with something more and new. And not only the food but their look is also quite tempting, they have kept the appearance of the food items in mind surely. The fun exciting d√©cor on the food will make you more cheerful. Lastly a tea devotee like me truly relishes their green and Darjeeling tea.

Never came across such a behavior from the servers of any joint before. Pathetic behavior. Not at all customer oriented place. They think customer is only and always at fault and is wrong and they are perfect.

a visit was due for long since i have been listening nice words about this small joint. so, when our friends asked to join them over the evening tea, i didn't miss the opportunity.

location is off southern avenue or purna das road. if you are coming from golpark, take purna das road, take the left just opposite to 13 parbon restaurant and then take the first right and mrs magpie will welcome you on your right. parking is easy (and free) just in front of the restaurant.

we visited on a sunday evening, it was full. decor is simple but very elegant. seating style is perfect for chatting with friends, but the tables are very close to each other due to small space.

i ordered cafe latte and ham-cheese quiche. it took them 10mins to deliver those to our table. latte was served with brown sugar, amount of the latte was good. the quiche was nice too with soft ham and almost molten cheese on top of it. my friends ordered some cup cakes and they informed those were nice too.

this was a brief encounter with mrs magpie but i promise to visit soon again for another evening over another cup of latte. till then, bye bye..

The visage of the place is quite quaint....similar to the cookie house we had heard of in stories when we were kids.
Placed in a slightly secluded neighbourhood, this place provides a rather enjoyable ambiance away from the humdrum of the busy roads.
The menu is quite aptly modified to suit the store's presentation.
We ordered a Mrs.Magpie Afternoon tea special. This offered to us the variety of edibles available and yet to be on the edges of economical squander. I specially liked the Chicken Salad Sandwich & though the cupcakes(so tiny and adorable) were a bit too sweet for my taste, my friend seemed to relish it.
So overall it was a pleasing experience, perfect for lazy afternoon brunches.

I am in love with this place and have been visiting it from the time this place actually opened. I love everything about it: cute door, soothing pink decor, the decorations everywhere, their food, the bottles in which they serve water, the bell that rings when you exit and i even like the washroom which is so cute ( okay i actually sound a bit obsessive). I have tried all the cupcakes and apart from few i like all the flavours but the last time i went i wanted to try snickeree but it was not available. The sandwich, quiche, tart, brownie, coffee, tea etc are all really nice. The place is very small and so often you have to wait for a long time to get a seat. I would like to try out their other items and would definitely go on visiting it. I would like if there was another outlet closer to my place.

CUTE is the first word which comes to your mind when you think of Mrs Magpie. Right from the cupcakes to the decor, every single thing can be described with that single word, cute!! The cupcakes are beautifully decorated, so are the big ones. The servers are very polite, the ambiance is fab. So far as food quality is concerned, I find it to be just okay, nothing extraordinary except for the Hot chocolate (which is SINFUL :P). Price is a bit on the higher side, but then again, not too high.
I wish to go back for the Hot chocolate and would also like to taste some pies and quiche.

Mrs Magpie has been on my wish list for over 3 months. Finally went there yesterday with two of my best pals.

As we entered the ambiance immediately reminded me of fairy tale land,all decked up in shades of pink and white. The colored bottles of water,the seating arrangements and even the door of the washroom everything about this place was sooo cute. The waiters are courteous and helpful.

Once we were seated we could not decide what to order as all the cupcakes on display looked tempting. Finally with much debate and discussion over which one will be more tasty we ended up ordering 3 mini cup cakes. One marshmallow, one after 8ish and one strawberry and choco. But the showstopper was the days special cake that we ordered. I was literally feeling sorry for having to cut it. However it was delicious or should I say chocolicious. Then we had the famous hot chocolate. "The mini one comes in small coffee cups" this being the recommendation of the waiter we ventured into ordering 3 regular hot chocolates. They came in unexpectedly huge quantity. The molten chocolate with a hint of bitterness tasted heavenly. But I would recommend the mini ones if u plan of having anything else. Otherwise u will b too filled up.
The bill came in a cute box. Pricing is pretty reasonable. My friend even opted for a take away which consisted of mushi mushi,nutty praline and another one the name of which I don't remember.

All together a wonderful place to spend time with friends as well as your special one. Will b revisiting. Would have given a 5 but .5 deducted for that offbeat location.

Normally, 'cute' is not the first adjective I associate any place with. But Mrs. Magpie commands such a description and rightly so.
Cosy and homely, this place is perfect for a quiet evening out. The coffee n bakery products are great. You might feel the price doesn't justify the quantity entirely... But given a special someone at the opposite end, ur most likely not to notice it at all. ;)

When I came down to Kolkata for my friend's wedding, I sure did have "Having cupcakes at Mrs. Magpie" on my list. So when we were looking for a place to order a wedding cake for the bride and the groom, Mrs. Magpie was obviously on our list. Before we reached Mrs. Magpie we checked out quite a few other places. But NONE could give us what we were looking for. Some of the oldest and well established places in Kolkata turned us down. At last we headed to Mrs. Magpie. And we were pleasantly surprised. 

Their staff were amazing and accommodating when it came to discussing our order. We had a long discussion on what kind of cake we wanted and tried quite a few design combinations and finally suggested a custom design. 

The entire process of understanding our requirements, asking all the right questions, and up till the delivery was an amazing experience. No words can be said when it came to the flavor, texture and the presentation. It was just as we expected and more.

Also, I must say, the quiche hit the spot ;) As well as the Bailey's cupcake :)

AND. Sourav:¬† I must say a huge "thank you" to you. You have been really accommodating and the Mrs. Magpie experience wouldn't have been as good as it was without your extra awesomeness. Right from helping us out initially up to the end, it was a beautiful experience thanks to you!

First things first. Finding this place is a bit tough. The streets around all look similar but as soon as you reach there, you know youve made the correct decision. The cupcakes were delicious esp the signature sweet and salty chocolate cupcake. The got chocolate was a little to thick- guess you can ask them to change it. The ham and chese quiche was delightful. Perfect for a 5pm rendezvous.

Tucked in a little lane off Purna Das Road, Mrs. Magpie is difficult to find. Yet most evenings you would have to wait outside for a while to get a table. And once you are in you realize the reason for it's popularity.

The d√©cor is whacky, refreshing, something out of a Enid Blyton book. Complete with coloured water bottles and little figures on their cupcakes.

They are cake people. They make the cutest cupcakes and lovely decorated cakes. Decorations are done using marzipan, which is more eatable than icing sugar. I am not a sweet-toothed person, but I like having a bite of their cupcakes from my friend's plate. They are very good.

I mostly order their sandwiches, which are delicate and delicious. I love their coffee, it's just right. And do try their scones (I love the cheese ones), they are a treat with a cuppa.

Mrs Magpie is my go to place when I am down, when I need a pocket friendly place to hangout, when I want a quick bite. Its a place for a nosh in the evening, painted in pretty pink and decorated like petite english caf√©. Late evenings it is usually very crowded and you will be lucky to get a seat on weekends. It is famous for its mini cupcakes but I'll gladly say there is more to it than that.
Once you end up in the right lane look for a pretty pink silled window with inviting indoor cafe. Their colourfull bottles, pretty saltshaker, buttoned cusions and marzipan works add to the pretty ambience. Though I feel it misses cosy curtains, I can hardly complain.
Coming to food - among all their mini and regular sized cupcakes my personal favourites are Lemon and White Chocolate and Bailey's. I recommend their Hot Chocolate which is absolutely heavenly. The strawberry Milkshake is also among my favourites. Their Lemon Iced tea and Darjeeling hot tea are great and healthy. For nick-nacks do try their range of sliders and sandwiches. If you are fond of subtle flavours try their ham and Cheese Quiche which i personally find slightly bland.
Mrs Magpie is a pleasant hangout place and it has never let me down. Do visit and Enjoy :)

The one word that comes to my mind when I think of Mrs.Magpie is "Cute".Everything about this lovely little cafe tucked away in one of the quiet lanes of Southern Avenue is cute.

I have been to this place multiple times and I cannot imagine how I could forget reviewing it.This place is beautifully decorated and has a wonderful happy feel to it.

The menu is not overtly extensive yet very tasteful.All the preparations are beautifully presented and a special mention about their cup cakes which are delightful.I am not that fond of cup cakes myself but the ones here are extremely good.The marshmallow,peanut butter and nutty praline cup cake are my personal picks.The Hot Chocolate here is the most stunningly sinful hot chocolate I have ever had.It is an absolute treat.Among the others,the Ham and Cheese Quiche is one of the must haves here.It is brilliant.I also like their Coronation Club Sandwich(with added bacon) and Shepherds pie.The Croque monsieur was one item here that I found rather disappointing.I liked the kick of the mustard in it but I felt it was way too salty and overpriced.

The staff are friendly and helpful.The prices are pretty reasonable.The quantity of some of the preparations is an issue if you are looking for a filling meal.But then the prices are such that it allows you try two or three different preparations.

All in all Mrs.Magpie is a wonderful place to enjoy an evening with friends over various kinds of awesome food.

If you want to show off.. And want to visit a girly place.. Where people are busy showing themselves as high class.. Please visit.. 
Being an expert baker they should stop being pretentious.. If you want a 2 pound cake please don't go there.. As they can only manage 3 pounds or more. 
Their fondant was good to taste and not overtly sweet.. However they complicate everything for example.. My cup cake had fondant, marshmallow, blueberry filling, chocolate bread with mint..which is just too much for a humble cup cake.

After hearing a lot,like seriously a "lot" about this much hyped up place,I finally decided to pay it a visit. It was a little hard to locate as I had difficulty in figuring out the ample by-lanes. So after an exhausting walk for what seemed like an eternity,finally when this place came into view it seemed like I was magically transported elsewhere. Eveything about this place is magical. From the jingling of the bell on the main door to announce a customer's arrival to the awesome doll-house like white furnishings to the aroma of chocolate and cookies,this place simply got me hooked at first look :).
We ordered four cupcakes [which was a very difficult decision as all of them looked so beautiful! They also had a small selection of liquor cupcakes which I would definitely try the next time], chicken-mayo sandwich,Assam tea,blueberry scones and some other stuff I cannot recall. Everything was served in really cute looking cutleries. Even the water bottles were shaped like champagne bottles which made me swoon. The scones were delicious. The tea was good. The sandwich was okay-ish. After we were done gorging on our food and called out for the cheque,they gave us the bill in this really cute soft-toy container. But the irritating part which pissed me off was that we were getting real late and they couldnt provide us with 60rupees change. We had to wait for fifteen minutes for them to finally give up and pay us our due. But its a place worth going to and would love to revisit soon.

I used to walk past this pretty little cafe on the way to my Spanish classes to see the change in the cakes on the window. They were real showpieces.
¬†Firstly , its a sweet looking place with a colorful bench outside (for people to wait I guess) ¬†and a warm looking place inside.
Inside the place looks very delicate with little things ,pink cushions and small bright chairs and colourful bottles and a counter full of yummy cuppy cakes.I loved the bell on the door, ringing when someone entered.
I was really happy to see that the people who served the food were really polite and smiling.
We ordered mini cupcakes ( chocolate hazelnut and sweet and salty) , hot chocolates and walnut brownie.
The cupcakes were amazing (the dense yet not quite heavy kind) and so were the toppings. You might feel the prices are a bit too high for such small things but trust me the heavenly taste is good enough in small quantities. I would suggest the sweet and salty cupcake for the balance between the two was really wonderful.
The hot chocolate was heavy , chocolaty and had a nutty flavour which I liked. The walnut brownie looked dry but was nicely chewy and chocolaty inside.
Do visit , the pocket pinch is quite worth the 'little pleasures'.

Wanted to come to this place ever since I began reviewing on zomato & finally its my 50th review here. I came here looking for the cupcakes, which I guess is what they are famous for... They have all the miniature versions of everything .. I tried the Shepherd's Pie & the Ratatouille and they tasted decent, if not something extravagant..The interiors are pretty, the staff is courteous & gentle.. This is not the kind of place to storm in with a famished appetite.. otherwise you would end up searching a negative point on the review scale... I would like to think what this place offers is a really sweet environment so that you can spend some sweet & lovely time together & food would just be a good way to complement the time spent & the worthiness of this place... I didn't come here with my special one though.... but I loved my moment here... all I am saying is that you must appreciate the beautiful, silly, pretty things in life like this place is... This review must seem confusing & poetic to most... hence I would suggest everyone to try this place out.

A visual treat indeed. Well it is more like SRK. You can love it, hate it but you can't ignore it. You will have to visit this place more than once. Well cupcake culture has dawned in Kolkata with Mrs Magpie's advent.¬†
If you have been to the better cupcake joints outside Kolkata then please don't spoil your love for the food delicacy by visiting Magpie. For Kolkata people, we don't have any other option yet.
There authentic Cupcake is Marzipan. Well it is of superb quality but too sweet to be appreciated. And a small piece of advice for anyone planning to visit this place, please don't go for anything other than a cupcake. Their snacks taste pathetic. :(¬†
But if you are planning to propose your girl-friend, there can't be a better place. ;)

The first time I visited Mrs. Magpie was on a pleasant winter evening. And I ordered the "Afternoon Tea for two" that serves an assortment of four mini cupcakes, four scones, eight finger sandwiches and a pot of tea. It cost us less than 500 rupees. I was "aww"-ing from the second i step into the place. Its very cute , you feel like you are in a fairytale world, my 9 year old sister agrees. :)This place has very less tax, which is another reason I love it. :P
If you are looking for something filling, then this is not the place. But this is perfect for a quick bite when you aren't too hungry but would like to grab a bite with friends.I personally love the nutty praline and the marshmallow cupcakes. The cheese scones are amazing!In all, I really liked Mrs.Magpie. :D

Will start with the ambience...quite like a fairy tale place...a tiny bell rings as you open the door...then you are greeted with frilled interiors!!!! instantly you feel very nice..then you get nice little cupcakes which look good and taste awesome and reasonably priced! ! Cold coffee was awesome just like coffee lovers like me would like...perfect..and the pastries are also very tasty and needless to say looks quite good!! .......Quite a good place in Kolkata to hang out and uplift your mood!!

Remember that movie, which all your friends went ga-ga over, which you just couldn't wait to watch. And which then turned out to be a major disappointment. Well, in a nutshell, that was Mrs. Magpie for me. 

I went there a couple of years back (yes, with a lot of expectations). The sweet treats on offer were a sight for the eyes, and the ambiance gave one a homely feeling. But, alas ! The tongue did not concur with what the eye indicated. And I left Mrs. Magpie utterly let-down.

PS: I do feel like it was a bad day for the missus. A second visit might well be on the cards.

smitten by the fairy-tale decor and good reviews from fellow foodies, we 4 friends entered MRS.MAGPIE on 24th march 2014.

we received an apparently warm welcome and felt at ease.

now comes the twist.¬†

while my friends ordered for the strawberry milkshake, i ordered the ICED LEMON TEA. the waiter suggested very courteously that their Orange drink would be more refreshing. I happily went by the suggestion and replaced my order.

my friends got their order in 15 minutes but that was just the beginning of my eternal wait. after waiting for half an hour I went to the counter and asked for by order. One waiter requested me to wait for 5 more minutes as my drink was "being prepared" for it was delayed due to some problem in their juice maker.

i waited for half an hour more and finally reaching the limit of my patience I went to the counter and demanded my drink. they blatantly said they had not received any order as such. i charged the waiter who had suggested me the drink. he kept quiet.¬†

we paid the bill and came out of the place while the people over the counter kept on gossiping. never in my life did i have such a horrible experience. i was made to change my order and then i was told i have not ordered anything after keeping me waiting for an hour. and not one word of apology did i hear from them.¬†

after such a terrible experience i am never going back their again.

The moment I pop my head inside through the glass door, I find myself in a fairy land..
As if all the goodness in the world have decided to join n celebrate here, in Mrs. Magpie..
For people of every age..8 to 80..this IS the place to be..
Cupcakes that half fill ur stomach with their looks, that melt in your mouth..cupcakes that are an opera of tastes..unveiling themselves carefully one after another..
Sorbets that make u happy at the heart..
Coffee that brews memory and make ur lips curl in the beautiful-est of the smiles..
What not to like about this place..
It brings u down ur childhood memory lane..makes u believe in love even if u r d hardcore type..makes u feel goodness..

Stands out from other bakeries/cafes in the city in terms of ambience and decor with a high cuteness quotient. The meticulously crafted cupcakes are one of the finest in the city. The scones, savouries and sandwiches are also commendable and a must-try. Overall awesome food, pleasant ambience, friendly co-operative staff, good quality and all this with not much strain on the pocket. Worth multiple visits!

I visited this adorable little cafe on the day of Mahalaya 2014 with a friend. Located away from the hustle and bustle of the Gariahat crossing, it wasn't too hard to find when I followed the Zomato map.
Now when someone tells you that that the inside of this place is PINK, PINK, and nothing but PINK, you tend to get a little cynical. But I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by how DAINTY this place is. I definitely felt like I didn't belong here!
Coming to the food, we ordered: Frosted mini cupcakes (After 8'ish, Marshmallow, Lemony white chocolate and Cherry cream cheese), cold coffee, chocolate milk shake, and Shepherd's Pie. If I said that the cupcakes were TO DIE FOR, it would still be an understatement. Each one was like a mini orgasm in my mouth. I literally cannot choose one over the other. They cost a bit more than what is given in the Zomato menu, however. The drinks were light and tasted good. I liked the cold coffee better because the shake was a bit too sweet. Now, the sweetness of everything CAN tend to overwhelm you, so ordering something savoury is recommended. The Shepherd's Pie came to our rescue. What a treat for the taste buds. The pretty purple bottle that they served water in was a nice touch.
Our bill came in a cute little basket, and was around Rs. 600. Needless to say, we were pretty pleased. Our server was very nice and helpful, and happily clicked a picture for us on the seat outside the cafe.
Thoroughly impressed. Can't wait to go back!

You eye the brightly lit place and step in excitedly with the bell clinking as the door is pushed. A world like Alice in Wonderland, or a fairytale studio i suppose. Very warm and happy place with friendly service. Mrs. Magpie is well known for cupcakes for sure, but my absolute favorites are : egg finger sandwich, chicken mayo sandwich, scones which are a little dry but tastes good, DARJEELING TEA, which is absolutely to die for and they serve it to you in beautiful english pots. One can try the English evening high tea where they provide cupcakes, scones, tea andb finger sandwiches together. Apart from that one MUST TRY the amazing ice creams which though pricey, tastes unique! And you can never miss the vanilla creme caramel in any waaay. Mrs. Magpie is my personal fav since it carries me to 70s English land through a small door.

Am in love with this cafe :) It's a hidden gem... Even during Ashtami we could get places to seat without waiting too much. Their frosted mini cupcakes are a treat for both your tastebuds as well as your eyes :D Love their cheese scones which come with strawberry preserve and white butter. Try the Darjeeling tea also which come with ginger bread biscuits. Their prices are quite reasonable. Will love to visit again :)

Have heard so much about the place me and my sister thought it is worth a try. We went in on a durga puja evening specifically on dashami evening. There was a que quite big. It was nice to see people sitting around and talking so happily to each other. The ambience was very nice. The staff was very humble and well behaved. Saw a few celebs there as well it was an atmosphere over all.

We orders a few cupcakes and coffee. The cupcakes were not nice enough for the money. Although they looked delicious but the taste was kind off uncooked and sloppy. It was not at all worth the money. It is overpriced and overrated. I was very disappointed as I am a loyal zomato follower and I trust zomato scores. This was an exception in a negative boat.

I went to Mrs magpie with friends and the first thing you notice is it's pink interior and striking oestrogenic ambience. It's the perfect place for dates when everything is going wrong and you have to make it up somehow, this is the place you want her to be. We had Darjeeling tea to begin with along side cup cakes and mini loaf followed by nutty crackles and every single item was yummy. Overall the experience was refreshing.

Subho bijaya to all my zomato friends.

Happy eating and keep reviewing :)

Its a good place for having snacks. All the cup cakes were delicious. They also have a lot of variant of coffee.
But there are two problems of it,firstly its not on the main road hence its quite difficult to locate,not easily connected to the main road. Secondly packaging quality should be improved. I took the cupcakes but within 15 minutes all were damaged.
Otherwise 1 thumb up.

A quaint cafe & their small cupcakes are to die for (at least comparing with the ones you get in kolkata). Although a bit expensive but you won't feel bad in spending the money as their quality is very good. And they also cater to your demands of baking a designed cake for any occasion. just contact their store manager and he will guide you nicely.

We ordered 4 types of cupcakes , darjeeling tea , mutton quiche , mutton slider and  chocolate pudding. The cupcakes are cute and they give a decorated cookie with tea . Food is too good and the chocolate pudding is also yummy.  Thinking of making it my afternoon destination :)

Visited after a long time and I was really surprised abt how the quality of food has gone down from the last time I visited the mini muffins that are also been my favourite were hard as allmost as stones,  ii mean muffins are supposed to be soft, really did not expect this from a place Wich is so elite I still would give a great rating for the ambience as it's like a fairy land kind of feelings but the quality is majorly dropped of the most popular food at Mrs magpie I would say on my previous experience that I would have gone to Mrs magpie regularly as coz of the yummlious muffins but sadly now it's not the same hope this can be taken care of.......  And yes they also need to have sum more choices if not in the afternoon tea menu atleast in the choice of tea, it will be nice if people git more options of tea in there set menu of the afternoon tea.....

Well I had a very good and a very bad experience. I shall start with the good experiences first.

It's a very cute little coffee shop with 30 seater approx. With fairytale doll house decor. The electric mix of contemporary n traditional furnitures and the peach n bright fuchsia icing to everything sets the mood. I haven't seen such coffee shops in Kolkata atleast. The cupcakes n the mini cupcakes which they serve looks very cute and so colorful that you won't feel like having them. But there are not much variety of dishes you can order. In savouries I had tried chicken Ratatouille tart, chicken n cheddar puff, mutton quiche which was absolutely yummy.

Now on to the bad experiences. I also tried the afternoon tea which comes with 4 assorted mini cupcakes, 4 scones, 8 finger sandwich and a pot of Darjeeling Tea. The problem with this dish is that they only serve you Darjeeling tea with this and you cannot choose anything else. C'mon if someone doesn't like Darjeeling tea and wants to have Assam tea or Earl gray then? That means u don't get to order this dish? How stupid is that. The mini cupcakes I had ordered were not fresh at all. They looked very cute n colorful as I had mentioned earlier but when I had them it was hard as rock. Cupcakes are suppose to be SOFT. Moreover I am a big fan of scones (all kinds) but to my surprise the scones I had in mrs magpie makes me think if scones are used as an alternative of stones to throw at others. It was very hard n very dry. Even the jam n the butter didn't help. Disappointed again !!

I wouldn't say it's very cheap it does pinches your pocket.

Bon App√©tit !!!

When I visited this place it was raining outside. We were partially drenched in rain. So went in and ordered some coffee and some cupcakes. The coffee is one of the best coffees that I have had in Kolkata. We ordered the small cupcakes big once were to big for us. Never the less they were tasty. The decor and ambiance is nice. It has a Doll House type of feel in my opinion. This place could easily be a little girls favorite place to visit. Looking forward to my next visit again. But one small draw back. The seats are limited. You might have to wait a little.

FAIRY TALE INTERIOR!!
The restaurant is in a residential away from the busy streets of the gariahat flyover. The interior had a pinkish hue and decor had country side vibe. Although they had only 7-8 tables they had 4-5 attendants to serve.
We tried VANILLA MILKSHAKE and COLD COFFEE. I tasted the best CHOCOLATE PUDDING I have ever had. I tried BAILEY'S CUPCAKE which had an apple flavoured topping.
I will definitely go there again to get the beautiful cakes on the display.

The bright fuschia and peach decor will win your heart as soon as you step inside. The chalkboard menu, the cherry-blossom wallpaper, the doll's house decor makes you feel you have landed in a fairyland!  The ambience is so nice! 

The small and medium sized cup-cakes with cute little icings are sure to make you fall in love with them. The sorbets  are adorable too! The place offers you an array of delicious tarts too, which i am yet to taste.

There is innovation in every corner (from the glass-topped table decorated with edible dices to the cute container for the bill, from the little white waiting bench to the ringing-bell at the door).

You just can't help going back to the place again and again :)

Being a non-alcoholic , non-caffeine-o-holic , non fizz-o-holic ¬†I have a great love for chocolate drinks and shakes. Every new place i go if i find a chocolate drink i go for it . So me and my partner somewhat developed a good sense for chocolates drinks.¬†

Brags apart and lets come down to business.¬†

When we first went to mrs.magpie a year back the hot chocolate was really amazingingly thick and delicious and we simply fell in love with the hot chocolate. On our next visit after 3-4 months we found the hot chocolate to be less thicker but again delicious [ yes we try other food too and we find them very average and scorn at the marzipanned mini "cap" cakes , no pun intended ]¬†

So when ever we pass from there or feel like having a hot chocolate we find the consistency is getting thinner and the taste is changing we are " LOSING LOVE "

So now what remains is Mrs.Magpie"used to"make amazing hot chocolates ¬†[ deep sighs ]

An owl made up of flour and dough...chocolate chips and candy...the spider-man waiting to leap on the next wall...Winnie the pooh sitting and smiling at u from a cupcake...imagine a world of Disney as beautiful as the movies...and as tasty as it can be...all in a quiet neighborhood in our very own Kolkata...Yes Mrs Magpie has all that...went there today in the afternoon to soak up the memories of childhood heroes and fantasy...ornately decorated interiors right out of any Disney movie set or a fairy tale being told during bed time...there is beauty, innocence and fantasy in every aspect of Mrs Magpie...right from the style of coloured bottles of drinking water to the presentation of cheque inside a circular box with a colourful beetle resting on its lid...wonderful.

Now the food...the menu has all the things which we may have wished in our childhood...my 3.5 yrs old son just had a gala time...he was spoilt for choice...a lollypop shaped like a "Angry Bird" or a "Babe", spider-man on a cupcake or baby roses or colourful mushroom...finally "Angry Bird" and baby roses did the trick along with vanilla milk shake

We ordered a Grilled Club Sandwich and Cafe Mocha for us and tried a bit of that cupcake to satisfy that sweet tooth...and all of them were good...We just loved it!!!

Hope to come in near future and try the Afternoon tea for two or Mrs. Magpie's Special Afternoon Tea.

Mrs Magpie , 
The one who loves to collect.   

Pink decor , floral walls and pretty furnitures and scented cookies , Ah pure fairy tale feels.   

Politeness is there among the staffs.
Tables are beautifully maintained with colorful bottles for water and little flower vase . 

And now the food, 

First visit -
April - 12 - 2014

Tried cold chicken sandwich, Mini cupcakes and kitkat shake.
The sandwich was served with chips and was light and tasty ,
The shake,was equally good .
Peanut butter and redvelvet cheese cupcake was exactly how i wanted.


Second visit -
October-2-2014
Tried their Cappuccino, assorted cupcakes, lamb quiche and chicken baked sandwich.
Lamb quiche was nothing too good,
Cappuccino was too strong and not upto the mark.
The lemon and marshmallow cupcakes turned off my mood,
Where peanut butter saved my taste bud.
The bill came  in a beautiful little box with only service tax.
I love magpie and gonna visit again very soon.

This is my favorite coffee shop. Those who stay near Gariahat or Hindustan Park sure knows what a little gem this place is. If you have a sweet tooth and want to have cute cupcakes in a variety of flavours, this is your only destination. 
The cafe looks good with solid colors and tastefully done interiors. The large windows and the ambience give you the feeling that this coffee shop has been taken out right of a fairytale. 
The evening tea for two, which comes around 450 INR is a g is choice and can easily feed 3 people. The cupcakes and the scenes are delicious and the slider sandwiches (4 in total) can be chosen from a variety of veg offerings. Sadly they have increased the prices of most non-veg sandwiches and you may have difficulty getting your choice of sandwich. 
The non - veg club is another favorite of mine. But for me, the icing on the cake has to be the caramel custard. At 55INR, its mouth-watering and reminiscent of the caramel custard that my mother used to make when I was young. I have also tried the chocolate pudding and is sinfully delicious. 
They have introduced flavoured ice-cream and they are very creamy. However, I have tried the cheesecake flavour and the ginger flavour. The cheesecake was a bit of a disappointment, as I could rarely find any hint of cheese flavour. The ginger ice cream had a subtle hint of ginger and boy I loved it.

Mrs magpie is a place which would remind u of some old childhood dreamland.. it‚Äôs a cozy n warm place which would remind u of some old English restaurant. The d√©cor is simple yet classy with pink floral walls n elegant wooden tables . speaking of food‚Ä¶ u would like to taste everything on display.. the cup cakes r a feast to both eyes n mouth‚Ä¶ we ordered walnut brownie, triple choco brownie , cherry n cream mini frosted cupcake , hazel nutty praline cup cakes and all were imply awesome‚Ä¶. Followed by pesto chicken sandwich and non veg club sandwich which were really yummy‚Ä¶ the quantity or the size of the sandwiches though small but r delicious n wouldn‚Äôt disappoint u.. I would really encourage the cake lovers to visit ths place‚Ä¶..

Its was my birthday when i decided to visit Mrs. Magpie. Heard a lot of times from my friends n was excited. The ambiance is just "awwww" with pink cute decor n white chairs n tables to sit. The moment you enter you feel like you have come to a dream fairy land. Then me n friend ordered "afternoon tea for two" which includes two sandwiches, four mini cupcakes, four scones, two cup of tea. N trust me it was so much that you will feel u ll die eating but u can't waste them as well cz they are very tasty. So all those girls who want to do girly talks with their girlfriends trust me this place is just appropriate. So just go n spend an awesome time with those yummy mini cupcakes

I have had a mixed experience here. The savories are nice. Tea is nice. The ginger biscuit with the tea is the BEST. But now.... the problems I faced.¬†
¬† ¬†I ordered from the specials which are on the chalk board. Got myself a cup of mousse. They gave me a nice looking chocolate cup with white mousse on top. It did look quite fancy. As I went on to eat it. All I could taste was banana. The white mousse on top was unlike any mousse I have ever had, it was very dense had a texture similar to thick rice pudding...and to make it worse it tasted like bananas. The bottom of the cup also had some sort of banana pulp which looked....lets just say unappetizing. Now the problem is not the banana. I just want to know what I am ordering. If i want mousse. I want mousse, not banana. If there is banana.....the waiter should have told us so.
¬†I then tried the mango ice-cream the waiter so graciously suggested. I shouldn't have. The ice cream...again, really bad. It was like chunks of mangoes here and there, hard and chewy....the fibers getting caught in the teeth. It tasted like a really bad frozen mango shake. I had two spoonfuls and that was enough. I couldn't eat it anymore.¬†
The only reason I go back here is the chicken pot pie. The place is nice, but I want to know what I order and not be surprised.

Beautiful usage of the entire space. The ambience is quite good. The cupcakes are good,  however items like shepherd's pie could have been slightly bigger. And it's better to update the menu because a lot of cupcakes and other items aren't available anymore. Otherwise the place and it's decor deserves kudos.

Essentially a cup cake lovers' paradise the cafe also offers a variety in terms of the various snacks that one can have here. We generally order their grilled chicken sandwiches and the quiches...Its a must try for anyone who has a sweet tooth and is a great place for adda with one's family and friends alike.

Word abour Mrs. Magpie has spread like wildfire and we went there expecting a lot. Ponits noted,

1. be prepared to wait minimum 30 to 40 minutes even on a weekday evening(or they should just add more tables)
2. Cute decor with pretty birds and flowers strewn over the place
3. mouth watering and ""salivate- at -one -look" cupcakes.
4. not happy with the sandwiches though, expected the portion size to be a little more.
5. ¬†best pot pies you find in Kolkata
6. not happy with the scones..

Well I have to admit, I find just the name of this place very charming. Mrs. Magpie, like a lovely old English lady who knows her tea and scones! 
It's a small place brightly yet tastefully done up and the food is definitely a treat for the eyes. Where price is concerned I found the cupcakes a bit over priced but everything else is well worth it. 
We ordered the afternoon tea so that was 4 mini cupcakes,  4 scones, 2 sandwiches and a pot of tea. Loved the presentation... gives you the colonial English touch with a fash of modern. 
The cupcakes were tasty no doubt and I enjoyed the scones. Sandwiches were standard. I preferred the egg over the chicken.

Alice in the Wonderland and Mrs Magpie would hold a striking similarity between themselves. Both would take you to being a kid and both would make you giggle and take you to a la-la land. The decor of Mrs Magpie makes you happy and would drag you into the typical UK 90's cake shops with kids yearning for some cup cakes or doughnut. Mrs Magpie would force you in with the delicious aroma of cake, cream cheese, butter and actual cheese. You have a very sugary decor all over and one of the best portion is the colored bottles that they would provide you water in. It definitely makes you all giddy and makes you go through color treatment!Me and my two other closest of close friends landed up and had a massive sugar attack. We ordered coffee caramel custard, triple choc brownie and two mini cupcakes that include a cherry creamcheese frosting and a marshmallow frosting along with some green tea.¬†The cupcakes melted in our mouth and there was a blast of jam while we dug into the middle of the cake. We both finished our round of food and decided to create a nuisance by shouting and laughing at the top of our voices. As soon as we were out of the sugary goodness, we decided to mellow down the sugar high with the help of something savory. Hence we ordered in espresso and cheese and ham quiche. The quiche tasted absolutely fantastic with a very soft pastry. Also for the fact the filling was also melting in your mouth and as your mouth undergoes a cheesy makeover, bits and pieces of ham entice all over your mouth, again.Overall, Mrs Magpie was a beautiful adventure, we didn't find Alice there for sure, but we sure made our own Alice with sugar and ate it up too!It would be fantastic to try other delicacies again there too!

Mrs. Magpie has been a popular joint from the day it opened doors and I doubt I can shed new light on the place. It is every bit as cosy, pretty and nursery-rhyme esque as it looks. They have a yellow bird salt shaker for crying out loud!

- Recommend their sweet and salty cupcake, peanut butter cupcake, sable cookies and hot choc if having a bad day and/or feeling indulgent. .
- Love their pesto chicken and smoked salmon sandwiches. Ask for mustard on the side(they serve dijon), you will not be sorry.
- Their coronation chicken sandwich has become more capsicum than chicken lately so don't go there.
- The special high tea for two is worth it and deceptively filling. Wish they gave a bigger pot of tea though.


I am told their ice cream and shakes are really great but am yet to know for sure.¬†
Advise them to play better music. The place begs a bit of fun hollywood classics.
That is all.

My friend loves this place and took me there. It is very pink inside and the menu is for the classic British afternoon tea. There was a queue and I think there always is one as it's popular and smallish. Anyway I had cupcakes hot chocolate and sandwiches. I won't say which ones cuz all seemed nice and most if the menu is worth a try.. only if I could take that much sugar in one sitting. All good, a nice place for when you are in the mood for a little sweet.

Mrs. Magpie is my favourite place to visit with my girlies on a lazy afternoon. :)

First off, the decoration is just too cute. It's like a little piece of fairytale.

I am a cupcake enthusiast, so wherever there's good cupcake, I am present there. 

Mrs. Magpie's iconic strawberry shake and the brownie wins my heart everytime. And everytime I come out from this place with a glee. 

To sum it up, I'd rate Mrs. Magpie a perfect 10 for being the little fantasy world right midst the hustle bustle of the city.

On my way to my bestie's house I spotted this long tym back n finally decided to make a move. Since we were hungry we decided to have lunch since we skipped it, but den again it was 5 30 pm we decided on this cafeteria.  Its such a lady like caf√©.  So beautifully etched.. the coloured belgium glasses.. the paper flowers.. the lights.. everything I m in love with. Started off with an Americano coffee n a walnut brownie. The walnut brownie here is one of its kind. Then we went on to the mutton empanadas n chicken rajajeuille. small though tasty enough to fill ur soul.then the bombarding dish was the sampler plate. I craved for more n more. A must try. Wanna go back all over again just to retaste the sampler .. wanna try the croquemonsieur, the cupcakes n the tart.

It's quite refreshing to find such a place out here in Kolkata. It's a small bakery with a very cute decor - a perfect place to hang out with a small circle. It could be a bit tricky to locate it, or get a table instantly, but the stuffs that you get there makes up for it. I specially like the offerings that they have in the "Afternoon tea for 2', although I never really tried it and rather went for the individual stuffs!

A great place for people with a sweet tooth!

I am quite a frequent customer of mrs. magpue and love the place. so I decided to take my best friend thr aa she has recently relocated from Australia.  we were meeting after years so thought of Mra. Magpie as tge ambiance is just perfect . we reached thw place and saw there were no seats. on asking the steward he said we would have to wait dor 5 mins or so and we were tols to wait outside , they would call us.   I noticed a couple walking into mrs. magpie. I am suee they were told the same. so we sat in the bench and started talking. it was past 10 mins so I went in to enquire and was surprised to see the couple were given a table and while we were waiting.  I immediately told thw Steward but he aaid people do not listen.  but he should have made an effort. . This experience was not expected .as a reputed brand I think its a matter of professionalism which was lacking..

This place is one of the most cutest bakery I have seen in the city. A little hard to find but is very close to Golpark.
No matter how virile you are, you will get a involuntary "Aww" when you enter this place, right from the tiny bell on the door to the pink decor to the cute toys to the small tables to the wonderful water bottle on them, it all combines to give a impression that this is a bakery right out of fairy tales.
The stars of the show are of course the cup cakes! They are tiny, soft, and absolutely the creative best when it comes to the frosting. priced at just Rs 35/- you can try almost all the specials of the day to be just amazed at the flavours and softness of these tiny devils. There's tea as well to accompany which I personally found to be OK. But the highlights here are the desserts and I can't take anything away from them, they are just exquisite. Rest assured you will go out with smiles on the face and blush on the cheeks.

I will recommend this place as a must try in the city as it is unique in all sense : Ambience and Desserts.

This place is a bit lovely, isn't it? So terribly refreshing to see a cafe in this city that pays attention to their decor AND food. I was delighted by the twee pink pastelly-ness the first time I went to Mrs Magpie but when I went back, it was for the cupcakes. They have some seriously good cupcakes here. No, really. These cupcakes are incredible. I've eaten a fair few of them in the past month, and I still don't have a photo because they are that good. You don't stop to Instagram these cupcakes, you cram them in your mouth hole at the swiftest possible speed. 

And oh, the homemade ice cream is pretty good too.

Mrs Magpie, Kolkata
Mrs Magpie for deserts and bakery is as Hansel and Gretal as one can get! Very fairy tale like the epitome of a Girlie joint that has an air of a British tea and cupcake shop! This is located in Southern Avenue in Kolkata amidst the hedges, lakes, greenery and mush! 
At the first sight the typical MCP in me squirmed revolt! To be seen inside such would demean my pride ! Never the less i marched in pretending to be nonchalant and a metrosexual. The decor was straight out of Alice in Wonderland with pastel colours of emulsion Pink, pink wallpaper with strawberry and rose, white wrought iron furniture straight out of the dolls tea party! 
So this is the newest entry in Tea Etiquette , cake, Dessert and bakery with a tinge of mush, marigolds and frosted marzipan and it served Cupcakes, Magpie Special Afternoon Tea, Sweet things, Savouries, Sliders, ribbon sandwiches, Coffee, Cakes, Tea, Scones, Hot and Cold Beverages, cookies, quiches etc.
I tagged along with the wife out of sheer curiosity and the wish to Review the concept! 
We ordered a Veg Quiche at Rs.65/-, Regular Marzipan at Rs.105/- , Mutton Quiche at Rs.75/- and Cheese scones right out of the Enid Blyton books at Rs65/-  with one Earl Grey Tea at Rs.65/- per cup and a cup of Darjeeling Tea at Rs.45/- per cup.
The Tea was more than a ceremony, it was invigorating, heavenly and flavorful whilst the confectionary were all fit for the royalty tea party. 

Ambience ‚Äì 10/10 (warm, spacious, Bright and clean)

Menu ‚Äì 8/10 Excellent English Dessert/confectionary  

Taste ‚Äì 9/10 (Veg Quiche was revolting) 

Customer Service ‚Äì 6/10 Good (a tad bit snooty and feminine imposition) 

Value for Money ‚Äì 8/10 good

Recommend ‚Äì  Excellent place for Girlie gossip and not the place males! Ladies go for it !!!

Here is what happens when you have visited too many overrated pretentious new cafes at every other street corner, you automatically have very low expectations when visiting the next new cafe with beautiful decor .                                                        Ah but I was completely in the wrong to judge this cafe before I went in. To be fair the decor outside is well 'pretty as a picture' with a lovely bench for people who might have to wait their turn to be seated. Once inside the cafe the pretty in pink decor did win me over.  I went on to order the Darjeeling tea after confirming with the server that it is freshly brewed without using tea bags. I chose a large nutty praline cupcake with the regular frosting since marzipan is not something I particularly enjoy.  Well what can I say about the only place in Calcutta which makes a gorgeous proper butter-cream frosting. Yes this is the only place where the butter-cream is soft , smells buttery and is perfect. The cupcakes might have been a little too dense for my taste but the butter cake was really the icing of the cake in this case.  I must say that if you crave prim and proper butter cream this is your place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                Without spending too many words on their polite service I shall directly go on to recommend the dishes which I found worth mentioning in my subsequent visits .  Their roast mutton sandwich is truly a delicious sandwich where the thinly sliced roast mutton is simply scrumptious.  Their chicken pie has a perfect crust. What disappointed me from their selection of savoury is the ham n cheese quiche which has a soggy crust due to the crust being way too thin. This crust might give the quiche a neat look but to be fair I would rather have a rustic quiche with a buttery flaky crust.                                                                          Their chocolate ice-cream is one of the best you can get in this city but sadly I did not find the  scoop of cheesecake ice-cream palatable , it lacked that essential creaminess which comes from the use of good cream-cheese or any other cheese and had a overly sour taste but then when a cafe serves 95% excellent food I would hardly care about a few dishes which does not personally appeal to me. I highly recommend this place to lovers, friends and even those solo birds such as myself.

MRS MAGPIE  is probably the reason kolkatans had their first brush with cute‚Äôn‚Äôyummy cupcakes, scones and finger sandwiches . By now most of us has already been to this place countless number of times each time trying out another cutie with some amazing toppings ‚Ä¶ with some divine tea in that carafe . Recently they have also introduced some quick-bite savoury items ‚Ä¶ I loved their MUTTON QUICHE and BAKED EGG!  To add to your delight they also have this yummy homemade icecreams with unusual falvours like ginger and masala chai‚Ä¶..   COCONUT  & GINGER being my favourite ! IF you are at awe of the cuteness quotient of this place and confused which cupcake to order ‚Ä¶.. just go for that NUTTY PRALINE .. it can never go wrong ‚Ä¶ AFTER 8 ISH  is a good option for the minty-toothed . The service is good and the pocket pinch is well worth it . Weekends could be a bit trying as there is huge rush . Be it a friend‚Äôs birthday, a hearty gossip with your bestie , a round table conference cum adda with your gang , the doe eyed first date s or just someone for that sugar rush ‚Ä¶. Hop in and enjoy !  needless to say I will continue visiting the place !

It was a little difficult go find as its tucked in the unknowns lanes of south kolkata. I wanted to guve ut a try as facebook was flooded with its reviews and "have been places" of many friends..
Pretty much matched my expectations,,The cupcakes were delicious... neither too sweet nor less sweet. Just baked perfectly!
Not much options of coffee.. jus d regular hot & cold coffee.. though well prepared.
Kolkata has come up wid a lot of new cafes, restaurants and sweet eateries... and I'm loving it.

The interior is very girl-y and very cute, i somehow felt delighted to visit this place. The first day I tried their mini cupcakes in hazelnut and praline flavour and it was oh-so-cute! I mean even to one of my friend the size was an issue but i was simply in my own fairy tale world with the cup cakes. Then the shephard's pie was tasty enough. The next time i went i took two cupcakes as usual (this time praline and lime white) and my friend ordered a Darjeeling tea that was served in a beautiful kettle, which even he praised along with a personalised cookie which he did not get to have (read i stole it). 
Did i mention that one day i was so craving for those cupcakes that my sister had to bring a take-away and the take away box was custom made for cupcakes. 
I would visit again soon with or without "that" friend! :P

Cute and cozy, with an inviting pallete of colors, Mrs. Magpie is a treat to the eyes to begin with. But it's sad that they do not have much variety when it comes to vegetarian delights. The cupcakes are lovely to look at- but you can simply finish them off in a bite! The chocolate milkshake wasn't chocolaty enough. The strawberry milkshake had less syrup in it. And not much variety for the herbivores. The staff is courteous and friendly, though. This basically sums it all up.

I finally made it to Mrs. magpie with soo many doubts in my head.. and lots of excitement !!! I was very confident about my order, i had mugged everything up from zomato beforehand ...! ;)
i went for --- *SPECIAL AFTERNOON TEA * ( comprising of 4 mini cupcakes ( u can choose them), assorted biscuits, 2 chocolates, 2 tea cakes, 4 scones (any of your choice) with butter and jam , tea pot (of your choice) , loads of sandwiches of 2 types (any of your choice)....

my verdict ------
1 ) Best cupcakes ever had, even way better than flurys. sooooo moist cupcakes... the toppings on top are sooo tasty , rich and delicious ! they are simply mind blowing..! the mini cupcakes are not sooo mini also as exaggerated (completely my opinion) plz dont fight over this now! i got -- 9-ish , strawberry cupcake, chocolate praline, something that tasted sweet and salty .. all of them were mind boggling !! i went completely MAD !! #foodgasm !! my fav is the strawberry flavour .. my god !!

2) sandwiches were soooo many of them, they were good and not tiny at all , had trouble finishing them up ... but so less choices to choose from.. we had to choose any sandwich less than or equal to 125! I cannot exactly count how many pieces of them were served ... plenty and uncountable !!

3) biscuits and cookies... well nice... :)

4) tea cakes-- i have never had such moist , delicious tea cakes any where in my life..!

5) scones --- it was well made. let me tell you what scones actually tasted like acc. to me. it was something like "patties cum cookies " i will have them when offered with the tea package.. but not something i would invest money on...! yes to be honest though i dont want to complain ... it was a lil dry.. but maybe its supposed to be like that .. and you are provided with plenty of jam and butter for the same reason..!

6) tea-- i dont have much knowledge about tea, but my fiancee exclaimed that the tea was the best that he liked... ! he said it was heavenly. i too liked the smell of the tea :)

7) one of the chocolates he ate and said it was brilliant..my chocolate was soooo yummmmm... heart shaped with strawberry filling yeaahh!!

I went to this bakery after reading all the reviews of zomato -------- i expected that it will be good only lookwise.... not taste wise ... but to be honest it turned out just the opposite for me... i liked the taste even better than its appearance...

I could not enjoy the view of the place completely , Nor could appreciate the beauty of this place. the reason is that the place was totally filled up... and the crowd was quite a snobbish one, passing remarks about my childish nature and the way i was clicking pics and also my over excitement bothered them ;) i didnt give a damn, but my fiancee "angry young man" kept on scolding me for my over excitement, thus i could not explore the place to its fullest due to the glares of people and the scoldings from him!!

next time i visit this place i will try to avoid the rush hours to avoid the crowd and then explore its beauty ! i have clicked numerous pics !! see them please !

not costly if you go for the package ... special tea package -- costed me 626 inclusive of service tax.# service tax extra. not inclusive of the bill. thats okay ! not a big deal... ! dinner in any average restaurant costs 1200 plus.. after such a huge tea party , i have no space left in my tummy to have dinner...!

We were thinking of desserts and coffee, so ended up in this new place.
We dint find much options in coffee in the Menu. 
We ordered Cupcakes and coffee. Nutty Paraline and sweet & salty cupcakes were too good. It was not too sweet. there were NO extreme flavors or sweetening. Really nice cupcake. Hope they can carry on the consistency.

Pocket Pinch - Is expensive. for a coffee and 2 cupcake, 500.

My friends say-"Mrs Magpie is a place right out of fairytales". How true! Its one of the 'prettiest' restaurants I have been too. This place is aesthetically very pleasing with great interiors. All in all a great ambience. Speaking of food, its quiet standard and delicious. They have a large variety of cupcakes and I need to accept that I love them all. There's some real daring experiment they do with those flavours. The staff and service is great too. This place definitely gives you a 'cute' experience. Perfect place to catch up with your girlfriends for some great food and gossip :)

Location: Lake Terrace Road, Near Southern Avenue. 

This place had been on my list for quite sometime now, and finally, I made it till here. 
The decor out here is simply so soothing to the eyes and seems to be quite cute with its pink interiors. :-P 

Talking about the order, 

- Veg Quiche
It was quite nicely prepared and tasted really good. 

- Veg Pot Pie 
The Pie was perfectly baked with fresh veggies tossed in white sauce, tasted good. 

- Hot Chocolate 
Aah! This was a treat to my taste buds. :-P 
For a chocolate lover like me, A cup of just melted chocolate felt heavenly! 

Cupcakes: 

- Sweet & Salty 
Tasted great! Along with the perfect blend of chocolate and caramel flavors it had the right balance of sweetness as well as saltiness. 
Recommended. 

- Apple n' Brandy 
Apple Compote with a slight hint of brandy. 
Tasted good!
(DISCONTINUED)

- Baileys
Delicious liquor-flavored chocolate cupcake. Rum tasted Yum.
Recommended.

- Nutty Praline
Sweet praline butter with coarsely chopped nuts  topped on a chocolate cupcake. Smooth. But, I preferred Baileys over this.

- After Eight
Tasted exactly the same as the chocolate by the same name. Delicious minty filling inside the chocolate cupcake. 
Highly recommended for mint lovers. Others should give it a try. 

The STAFF was really polite and guided through the menu well.
The SERVICE was quick. 
PRICES are slightly inclined towards the high, but, the offerings are worth the pinch. 

Overall a Great experience. :-)
- A revisit remains due. Wish to try the remaining next time.

This place is beautiful. Period. 
However since I do not have a sweet tooth I do not really enjoy much of what this place has to offer. 
However , despite that I'm pretty much able to gobble down their yum muffins & cookies. 
The teas are especially nice. However I do not really like their cupcakes. 
The customized cakes are also beautiful and tasty .

A definite must try if you like the english style cafes that don Kolkata city. The sandwiches are good, the queches are better. Didnt like the scones much but the muffins are a must try. You would love the ambience, soft pink with everything very calm and soothing. The cold coffee is good. The first time I went there was there 1st anniversary and they gave a complimentary pastry to all guests donning the cafe. You would love it, so surely do try

The perfect place to chit chat with girlfriends or as in my case - hangout with mum. Everything around draws you in. The cupcakes were heavenly by cupcakes standards! Drinks were welcome. Definitely a place I'd like to come back to :)

One word..Cute. With a capital C. So its very much likely to be your girlfriend or daughter's fav spot the moment you take her there.Well, not being anymore gender biased even i would like to say that i liked the "English" appearance of the small eatery on the Lake Terrace Road. Chic wooden entrance and seats with cute colours and motifs inside this place sure earns brownie points for ambiance. Coming to the food, we ordered the following cupcakes-
1.Sweet and Salty- Nice little chocolate cupcake with a dollop of Caramel on the top.
2.Marshmallow- This cupcake has a lovely presentation with a snowman made of marshmallow sitting on the cupcake,tastewise a bit on the sweeter side
3.Hazelnut Praline/Nutty Praline- Best of the lot or maybe i am such a hazelnut fan. :P

But they didnt had the mini cups the day we visited, hence I had a sandwich which was tasty but nothing extraordinary, normal stuff that you may get in every CCD or Baristas but at a relatively lesser cost. Service is good, the waiters are quite hospitable and take time to explain you incase you have any problem understanding the names of types. Price..may seem like a bit on the steeper side but considering they definitely makes Kolkata's one of the best cupcakes you should want to try it once.

One of my favourite places to hang out with my friends. I have been here like 10-15 times. Magpie makes the best cupcakes in Kolkata!

The ambience is really nice with pretty furniture and playful pink wall paint... Each table has really cute bucket full of cutleries (mini spoons,forks and knives) and printed napkins :)
The place generally gets full by 6pm. Ideal for all age groups. 

As I have already mentioned, the cupcakes are delicious. I have tried all the flavours. Sweet and salty, praline and after eightish are my favourites! Coffee caramel custard is also really nice. 
I have tried their sandwiches, lemon iced tea, cold & hot coffee, chocolate milkshake, scones, sliders...( almost all their items ;p)
Sliders are mini burgers. The burger loaf was a lil crispy and tasted really nice. The only thing I didn't like was the scones....it was too dry and not that tasty.  But that isn't going to stop me from visiting this place again... :)
I would keep going back to this lil joint called Mrs. Magpie for the love of cupcakes !!! <3

i ordered the afternoon tea for 2 , the scones where good not the best, slightly dry but still enjoyable , the mini cupcakes where the same, overall i enjoyed my  experience  :-)

i went back 1week later and the scones where hard and dry and the quantity of butter/jam/cream is extremely less.
the mini cupcakes were not good either , loved the darjeeling tea though .

Well always being enticed by new places and having the hunger for exploring new cafe's in the city. I just quenched my thirst when I visited Mrs. Magpie for the first time. What a ravishing ambience! A world of colourful and flavourful magpies :) I was delighted much by the Cappuccino! Then Pesto chicken sandwich was one of the delicious sandwich I ever had! And last but certainly not the least was the Cheese and Ham Quiche! Totally engrossed into the bite.  Reasonable price and a MUST VISIT surely!

A place right out of a fairy tale. Strawberry, mauves and yellows all over giving the interiors a cheerful & bright look. The cupcakes are too die for. The evening tea combo with cucumber sandwiches, scones, cupcakes and darjeeling tea is reasonably priced and good for 3 people. The shepherds pie is delicious and so is the pot pie. 

Ideal place to sit with a book and while away some time while having some of the savouries and then packing some mini cupcakes back home.

After hearing all praises about this 'cute' place from everyone, I visited it today. I won't say I had the best of experience here, food wise!

When we entered, this place looked like a small and cute British bakery with retro English numbers playing very mildly at the background and very PINK. A man appeared very soon to take our orders. I asked if they had ice cream and he nodded and gave me a separate menu card which had ice cream options.

Coming to the food, I did NOT like the brownie that was served here. I am a big fan of brownie and I like them soft. The brownie that was served here was a little too crusty and hard. It had a slight bitter tinge to it as well. A ordered cold coffee and he was pleased with it. We had initially also ordered one Banana yoghurt and a rich chocolate ice cream. The server came after a few minutes and said Banana yoghurt is not available so we had to change the order to snickers. The ice creams were "home made" and were pretty decent. However, the proportions were VERY VERY small and I would want more than a scoop of ice cream for what they charge. Disappointing. 

Coming to the cup cakes which are so much talked about, I HAVE to agree that they are cute. I did not taste because N declared very sternly that they just look good and taste pretty basic. No comments on them therefore.

One thing that I must mention here is that they have beautiful bottles here that are used for serving water. I know that this does not even qualify in a review but I was a really impressed when the moment I finished my brownie, one man appeared with a very pretty red bottle and glasses :)

A 10 on 10 to the servers because they are extremely humble and polite. We chit chatted for quite a while and finally asked the server to bring the bill as he was in no mood to disturb us. The prices are inclusive of taxes minus the service charge. Although I was pretty disappointed with the place and the food, you could try it if you like things cute and sweet.

I didn't know that this cafe joint is so near to my home. Me and my friends were roaming around after watching a movie suddenly we discovered this. I have heard a lot about it and decided to visit as soon as we located it. It has a very cute decor which goes very well with its name. We ordered hot chocolate, cafe mocha, chicken ratatouille, cupcake and cold coffee.. Food quality is good.. I loved cupcake and hot chocolate.. Price is on the higher side.. Service is good.

This is the cutest cafe I have ever visited in my life. Very beautifully decorated place with excellent ambiance. Everything here right from the decorations in the cafe to food are treat to eyes, hats off to the delicately crafted masterpieces. I order different things whenever I come here for pilgrimage and till now Apple Tarte Tatin, Salmon sandwich, Ham 'n' Cheese quiche are my favourites. I will like if they improve the shakes and introduce more varieties in the beverage section.
Tips- Bring your girlfriends to score high as this is a very girly kind of place.

Very cute, very quaint, albeit a touch too small to accomodate all of its growing number of visitors. The tea is always wonderful and brewed perfectly, and the scones and the quiche are delicious, but the sandwiches are a mixed bag. The cupcakes and marzipans look brilliant and colourful, but do not taste exceptional. If not the best, Mrs. Magpie is certainly one of the better cafes around.

Finally Mrs. Magpie is added to my list. Seriously a cute decor all pink theme. Little ancient add ons make this place really classy. It reminds of British bistros.
Fresh baking smell welcomes you. It was all together a different experience. I went with my boyfriend. He being a veg guy its kinda difficult finding veg food. But here we had various options with lower price. First we ordered ginger ice cream and black forest scones with cold coffee. They placed the scones with butter cheese and jam. Scones had generous amount of black forest in it. Tasted heavenly. Coffee was quite ordinary. Then we had assorted cup cake platter and one with marshmallow with it and chicken meat loaf. Everything was fresh to look. But frosting melted completely. And the worst part of all I found a small piece of hard white rock. Highly disappointed from a renowned place like this. They should have been more attentive. After spending 1200 rupees we don't expect pieces of rocks in our food.

Mrs. Magpie has a place in our list for long and yesterday  we went back there. The cute decor gives a strong impression of a girl's playroom as we see in movies.. not sure what picture it paints for the men. 
Coming to the food - we ordered one large hot chocolate, one baked fish pie and one ginger ice cream.
The hot chocolate is good..just how we wanted it.
The baked fish pie was just average, nothing special.
The ginger ice cream was our interest-of-the-day.. this unique and new flavor pleased us..not too strong or overpowering, though lacked the creaminess.
Though taste-wise we were not disappointed, what bothers us every time we visit Mrs Magpie ( and we do end up there once in a while ) is the quantity they serve and the price they charge for it. One might argue that "the quality speaks" and i agree to that.. but if you have seen the small ( read : bottle cap-size ) cupcakes, would the cuteness plead to you when u eat it.. i wonder. I have never seen anywhere that one large hot chocolate ( or in fact, anything ) costs exactly twice the price of two small ( and it was off the menu, so we could not verify the printing price ). The fish pie could barely suffice for one person with a healthy appetite. And the "large" scoop of ice cream was only a regular scoop and i'm afraid to imagine what they would serve for the "small".
They mention "Rs 450 for two" as their cost in the Zomato listing.. but it is going to cost a lot more to fill your tummy and your heart, if you intend to feed yourself anything apart from the cuteness-quotient. 
I do appreciate their theme and decor and the colored bottles in which they serve water on the table, but the bottom-line for me is always the food.. and what disheartens me is the price-quantity ratio. If i had my way, i would end up spending a thousand over here.. and then there would always be a question : is it worth spending so much for tea and cupcakes?
So, i would be back there, but i have limited my visits and it is a disappointment every time i visit, i fail to get the craftsmanship that is so talked about.

I had read about the opening of this confectionery in the newspaper and had wanted to visit it ever since. It‚Äôs a quaint place with a certain picturesque quality to it. The interiors are decorated with exquisite figurines‚Ä¶I‚Äôm guessing they are actually fancy confectioneries. The look reminded me of pages from a fairy-tale book, while the ambience can easily match that of any international caf√©. The flip side is the location‚Ä¶we had to actually ask quite a few people before we could spot the place. The management would do good to put a few pointers for those approaching from Southern Avenue and Hindustan Park/Rashbehari Avenue. 
Moving to the cakes & bakes, we ordered red-velvet cupcakes, blackcurrant scones and sandwiches. They were just about ok‚Ä¶..to be honest, I didn't find them delectable enough. It seemed that there was greater emphasis on the d√©cor than the food.

Mutton sandwich was not up to the mark but their chicken finger sandwiches have always been yummy. Perfect pricing for students like us. When it comes to Mrs Magpie, I am sure people would actually want to indulge themselves.

This was my first experience at a patisserie. And my oh my, wasn't it a good one. From sweet Grandma feminine decor,to Marzipan figures all around. The food is unbelievable. From the cherry and Green apple sorbet, to the Afternoon tea combo, it is a delight. The Scones were just,unbelievably delicious,with a gorgeous salty sweet undertone, The finger sandwiches are flavor bombs to the tongue, and The cupcakes were basically, Heaven on a plate.. the generous servings of Darjeeling tea(available in Assam and green,too) helped drown it all. Don't let the food fool you. you will end up panting for breath,halfway through it. And at 600,which narrows down to a mere 150 per head, Magpie offers an insane value for money. 

All in all, Mrs. Magpie is a like a candystore for candy addicts.Or for us, A haven for us Baker's. This should be in,the list of places to visit,for foodies landing their way in Kolkata, or those who are already blessed enough to live here....

Mrs. Magpie is situated on the Lake Terrace Road, Kolkata. It‚Äôs actually a nice treat to your eyes if you visit over there, colourful decoration and nice ambiance caught my heart from the very beginning. I have had their several items starting from savoury to their bakery.  Now coming to the details of the each food.
Green Tea was perfect.  The Cointreau was sinful. The German tea cake was awesome, in one word. Apart from that, we also had their newly introduced items like veg pot pie, chicken pot pie, fish pot pie, chocolate and fruit cake, each and every dish was well prepared. Someone may not like the smell of fish pot pie, but if you are a seafood lover, you may like it too. I would love to revisit this place over and over again.

Food items are so tempting that you like to try everything. 

Taste is also really nice but can be compared to other Cake shops in and around kolkata.

Then the nightmare, the pocket pinch will hurt like hell.

So, food lovers carry a butt load of money to enjoy its offerings.

One of the best places in the hustling city of Kolkata. So peaceful that you can hear the bells ringing every time a guest enters the place.
Lovely decor using some awesome crockery, was just in awe of the teapots. 
Anyone from England would instantly feel at home - perfect scones and cream team. Amazing baked potpie and a really amazing hot chocolate.
I would surely take all my English friends to the place and I'm sure they would corroborate what I say.

A place to surely spend some romantic, lovely evenings.

Ok, so Calcutta did not know designer cakes as it does today, before Mrs Magpie happened. Marzipan-lined, finely sculpted masterpieces entered the city's foodscape only recently and how! Take a look at this Batman-themed cake, and you will know. This uniquely conceived piece is actually a tiny one-pound wonder, a soft dark chocolate sponge base, with a blue icing to mark the theme. Gotham city etched in Marzipan and a cute little Batman sitting atop it. Do not miss out on the fine detailing. Awesome is just an understatement. It tasted yum too.
The staff is wonderfully cooperative, they accept online payments too, and deliveries are bang on time. So this is a new high for foodies who prefer to do it in style!

Everything about Mrs Magpie is cute, pretty, beautiful that could get any person awestruck by exhibiting an extra-ordinary level of craftsmanship and skill especially with their cakes.

Located in Lake terrace Road, its a small place with quite a few chairs n small sofa seats by the walls. The decor is very white and pinkish giving it a feminine feel but the colourful atmosphere adds to the mood and lets me unwind over some snacks, shakes and cupcakes. The chairs aren't very comfortable though. The ambience is really nice and relaxed. The staff are very polite and warm. The service is pretty fast too.

The small cafe serves up some savouries, tea coffeee n shakes and lots n lots of cakes, cupcakes, chocolates. Some details of the items i have tried is as follows:

Puffs n sandwich - Spinach n fets cheese puff was pretty tiny for a 30 bucks but an absolute delight, would prefer a bigger one at 50 bucks though. Mediterranean Roasted veg sandwich had various vegetables filled inside toasted foccaccia bread with some potato chips by the side which was pretty decent but not so much to my liking

Veg Loaf - This was my favorite wherein they had put mashed vegetable n mushroom patty inside toasted whole wheat bread served alongside some potato salad. The preparation sounds simple but the taste was extra-ordinary and is highly recommended. Priced at 225 i felt it to be a bit steep but item is worth it.

Veg Pot pie - A very well presented veg pie, pretty well baked. The veggies inside in white sauce seemed very bland to me with too much of broccoli to love it.

Scones - I was recommended  cheese scones by senior foodie Rukshana Kapadia who is in completely love with it but somehow it dint appeal much to me since i felt it was too salty which she explained was due to the variety of cheese being used but everyone on the table loved it.

Quiche - The veg quiche was very well made and one of the best i have had in recent times.

Cold coffee - There is just one cold coffee, iced tea n couple of shakes on the menu to drink apart from hot teas, coffees. I tried the cold coffee. The staff tried their best to customise it to my liking n satisfy all my tantrums associated with it but i dint like it at all. It was very basic n ordinary. Other foodies ordered the strawberry milkshake that looked tempting and i want to try it the next time but i would strongly suggest them to add a few options in this area.

Chocolate and fruit cake - We were offered a sample of these two cakes that they would be soon adding to their menu. The basic chocolate cake was a bit too dry and i dint like it much as such but it could be nice alongside a classic cappuccino or a latte. The fruit cake was much better though and had lovely flavours.

German Tea Cake- It is a speciality of theirs and a result of very tedious process. Not matter how much i try i cant explain it any way closer to as explained below by RK in her review and everyone was crazy about it but i dint like it. It looked lovely but was bit too hard n dry and i just failed to like it though dont know a single person who tried it and dint love it like crazy.

Frozen Cup cakes - now this is their strength and each and every cup cake looked a masterpiece in itself. Every cupcake looked so lovely that I dint feel like disturbing its shape but equally couldnt resist my temptation to have it inspite of me not being much of a cupcake fan. I tried their sweet n salty, hazelnut cream, berry n cream ones. The first was a mix of chocolate n caramel flavours and was the best of 3. The hazelnut cream was decent but i felt the flavour of hazelnut was not adequate. The berry n cream was nice.

Hot Chocolate - This was a shocker. It was a cup of pretty much molten chocolate with as much as zero dilution. Once it arrived, everyone couldnt stop talking about it for 5 mins. If you love melted chocolate, it is no less than a heaven for you but am not so much a chocolate person alas !!!

Overall i feel its a lovely place but the seats are a problem for me though dint find anyone else complaining. The options in savouries are limited, moreso for vegetarians. The options to drink anything cold is limited which doesn't work for me especially without a satisfactory cold coffee. The cup cakes are an absolute delight if you are a cupcake person. So this is a heaven for anyone who loves cupcakes, marzipans but otherwise, it would be a treat only for your eyes and taste buds would be left wanting !!!

Straight from the world of Barbie and Alice in wonderland, this place is Oh! So pretty! With its floral wallpaper and yellow lighting the decor is beautiful and elegant. As it is said all good things come in small packages, this place serves amazing cupcakes and mini cupcakes amongst various other savouries. A must visit for cupcake lovers.

They don't make cakes... they sculpt masterpieces. The place is a conglomeration of all wave-lengths in the visible optical range.... in other words, you get to see every possible color on the myriad cakes and pastries. The designs are awesome, and the skill with which they accomplish in making those designs is absolutely impressive. Their designs reminded me of the multiplexed designer cakes that are made in Las Vegas, albeit this is at a smaller scale. 

I liked the idea of how they show you their diverse cake designs when you get there to place an order: they have a repository of pictures of cake designs on an iPad. Just scroll and choose (would love it if they introduce online design selection and purchase)....

Tried out their Broccoli-Mushroom-Pepper Tart, Chicken Ratatouille, Mutton Empanadas and Ham 'n' Cheese Quiche.... OUTSTANDING, AWESOME, DELICIOUS.

This one's sure giving Flury's (another favorite of mine) some major competition. 

Go... Savour....

Yes, the decor is very dreamy, cute and has a very happy-happy feel to it. Been here thrice and I never could really understand when people rate the cupcakes as 'outstanding', 'yummy' etc etc. For me its quite average but yes, a child will definitely find it quite appealing and I believe, they can really work more on the taste factor.

Dear Food bloggers ! 

To start with , let me tell you the first thing i noticed about this place --- the bell right over my head when i enter the place . Not to forget the squeaky sound of the entrance door ( to the designer-- what were you thinking ? ) 
Now lets just talk about the food . I ordered for a scone -- please don't judge me for saying this but i have never had one . Now i regret it ! So we ordered for a scone and some ice tea . The ice tea tasted a lot like 'Nestea' which is rather weird considering i payed twice the amount ! The scone was mushy , sticky and tasted like a blob of poorly cooked four. I don't know about you but i am definitely not trying any scones ! 
Then we went on to order for this assorted tart platter - one called a ratatouille of chicken and the other one being some mushroom one . The chicken one was not even close to a ratatouille  ! Plus why would anyone think if making a tart out of ratatouille ? It is supposed to be more of a casserole dish of fresh veggies . However. The tart tasted nothing more than some curried chicken . Lastly we ordered for the famous cupcakes . I meant they do look very cute and it is correct when people say that "you eat with your eyes " . However , i found them very average . My experience tells me that most confectionaries often face a challenge to make the food taste as good as it looks . However , very few confectionaries have been able to resolve this notion . 
So to all my friends , let me tell you one thing , if you want to just chill with your casual mates and have some coffee , you may go here but I for one can say that Mrs Magpie has failed to keep my attention . 

Feel free to drop in your comments ! Till then , Happy Eating :)

This without a doubt is the cutest place in town. Brilliant cup cakes and sandwiches are nice.  I love the Assam tea. If you want to have a quiet evening chat its a perfect place. They have the best cake designs and when you see their cakes you would be fine to shell out those extra pennies. This places keeps me happy.

"All things cute and beautiful" is what Mrs. Magpie looks, oops, feels like. The place is absolutely "Oh! So pretty", with its floral wallpapers, teeny tiny cupcakes, bright yellow lighting , the tiny bell which rings everytime someone walks in or out of that pretty door. The place is an instant mood-uplifter. Like a fairy house, distanced from the noise of the city. Even the cupcakes, scones, pies and tarts look "so cute", "awwww" , "pretty"!! I've tried almost every thing that's on the menu...really good. The best, though, is the cup of hot chocolate. Heavenly!!!

To start with, in general I am not very fond of cakes, desserts, sweets, etc IF not they are just mind blowing and outstanding! And yes, I liked the cakes Mrs.Magpie had to offer! Starting from cup cakes and going up to five pound cakes I have tried it all here! In short - you guys are here to stay and show the way to many more such cafes. Price is on a bit higher side but that will never stop you from growing. Here's my son's 1st birthday cake home-delivered from Mrs.Magpie... and it was just awesome!

This place will definately enchant you. The decor is 'oh so pretty' and food is delicious. I drop in every chance I get. The cupcakes are to die for, my favourites being cherry and cream and nutty praline. The sandwiches are soft and delectable. Perfect place to go on a date or to catch up with your friends over a big cup of hot chocolate. .

I had this place on my wishlist for quite a time now..... so finally gave it a visit yesterday.

The decor.... is very pinkish nd soothing....and it feels like a different ambience all together.... After browsing the menu , we ordered A veg quiche, A Lemon Ice tea , A cappucino and a mediterranean sandwhich.... everything was served as quick as possible..... with the apt amount of salt nd sugar
. The Veg Quiche was amazing and so was the cappucino. the sandwhich however wasnt so tasty to my buds.... the ice tea was fine....
We skipped ordering the cupcakes....but next tym we will give a try....

The staff was very polite...nd gentle

Overall : This place is a must visit during 4-8 pm

Finally I had the chance to grace Kolkata's newest 'elite' cafeteria! And I would have to agree that the first thing that you will notice is the decor. Cozy and vibrant are the two words that I can think of and yes not in the least cramped. I am a savoury person. The very helpful manger suggested non-veg club sandwich with bacon which was a revelation by all means. The lemon Iced Tea helped me wash off the nauseating March heat. The other items that we had ordered were Frosted marshmallow cupcake, assorted cheese scones which were served with a very tasty strawberry jam and butter and cold coffee. These items were pretty okay as well. Overall, it is a nice cafe with very amiable staff and good food.

Give it a go!

On the first day of the new year, ready to explore a new diner and looking for something ‚Äòhatke‚Äô (different), we were in front of this girl‚Äôs college, setting out for our next adventure. Located on the corner of a quiet alley, the bakery stands out for its fairytale-ish decor. Adorned in the shades of bittersweet orange and baker miller pink against an azure backdrop, the whole set-up had an enchanted aura. Going inside is like stepping into a mythical land. The interiors were bespangled with adorable bells and cupcake shaped baubles. A small Christmas tree was resting on each table reminding us that the celebrations are not over yet. A lot more can be said about the interiors, like the almirah full of little elves, snowman and santa figurines. The showcase with magazines, showpieces and baskets/bowls full of buns and biscuits.

First we started with the main attraction of the bakery, the mini cup cakes. Each cup cake has its own variety and decor. Green Chilli (co-author of this blog) had the Apple ‚Äòn Brandy mini frosted cupcake and I opted for the tempting Nutty Praline along with the savouries: Chicken Ratatouille Tart and Mutton Empanadas. Then we went ahead with the Cream Tea and concluded our meal with a plate of sandwich for each and another as a parcel for our journey back home (yes, we overcompensate everything with food) . We have decoded all the dishes for you in the Our Platter section. 

OUR PLATTER:

We had two Mini Cupcakes:

1. Apple n‚Äô Brandy Cupcake: A tiny cake with thick and soft cream icing and apple caramel inside combined with the light flavour of apple cider and brandy. This cup cake is available only in miniature size. We liked the nice texture and unusual flavour of Apple n‚Äô Brandy mini cup cake. Apple cider and brandy gives a nice twist to the sweetness.

2. Hazel Nutty Praline: A chocolate cup cake with shea butter icing and embedded hazel nut. This is available in both the standard size and mini size. In the ocean of cup cakes, Hazel Nutty Praline will definitely catch your attention. Apart from looking extremely cute, it is a complete delight for the sweet tooth. The yummy nuts and rich chocolate was an amazing start to the meal.

Under Savories we had the following:

1. Mutton Empanadas: Empanada is a Portuguese stuffed baked or fried dish. This dish was basically smashed mutton filling in a crust with a hint of Indian spices. The crust was soft and brittle. Flavour of cheese in the crust and stuffed mutton complimented each other. This mildly spicy and salty snack will gel well with your evening tea.

2. Chicken Ratatouille Tart: Tart is a snack. This tart was basically a crusty pastry base with chicken topping made up with tossed chicken bits, bell peppers, potato and onion. The name was so dear to us (uhm..Ratatouille, the movie) that we couldn‚Äôt resist ourselves from ordering the dish. This is a light snack for your evening gossip and we will rate it as ‚Äònot bad‚Äô. However, please remember that this is nothing like the traditional ratatouille ni√ßoise.

Under Drinks, we had the following: 

1. Cream Tea: Darjeeling Tea served in a glass pot with one plate of scones (two scones), one tiny cup of sweet red jam for the scones, one tiny cup of sugar cubes and two tiny cups of solid flower shaped cream. The cream tea was somewhat Devonshire styled. Although, it was meant for only one person but the quantity was good enough to make it one-by-two. We were enamored by the presentation. We liked the flavour of the tea as well as the creams. The jam had a nice kick and seemed to have been made with a lot of care to bring out that perfect balance. However, too much baking powder spoiled those scones.

We went ahead and tried the following Sandwiches with the tea:

1. Non-Veg Club sandwich with Bacon: Grilled brown bread crust, egg poach, shredded chicken, mayonnaise, tomato and of course a slice of bacon. It was served with sauce and salted, crispy potato chips. The bakery serves ham too, but unfortunately that day it wasn‚Äôt available. For bacon freaks it is a treat. A thumbs up to the guys for quantity since Green Chilli was so full with only half the plate that she had to get the rest of it packed. The potato chips were light (may be because they were baked, instead of being fried), crispy, non-oily, in short just the way we like :D

2. Pesto Chicken Sandwich: The sandwich was in ciabatta bread which is an Italian white bread with grilled chicken, tomato slice and pesto sauce (that had prominent hint of  basil and garlic) served with crispy potato chips. Red Chilli had the Pesto Chicken Sandwich. A light sandwich with hint of spices. The chicken was shredded and well cooked. Flavour of pesto sauce complimented the grilled chicken. Between the Club Sandwich and Pesto Chicken, we‚Äôll choose Pesto Chicken.

3. Coronation Chicken Sandwich: Finger shaped white bread sandwich in coleslaw, chicken and mozzarella served with potato chips and tomato sauce. We took it in a parcel and happily continued our eat slash walk. You can surely consider this sandwich for your brunch. It is light, soft and tasty.

THE RESTAURANT

The staffs were polite and happy to provide their suggestions in placing the order although all of them were not equally informed about the menu. Besides, while we were eating, a waiter started sweeping the floor nearby. Moreover, cushion covers seemed a bit grotty. Other than these though, the experience was an absolute delight. 

In terms of presentation, they absolutely nailed it! The cup cakes and savouries were served on neat white trays. The tea came in this beautiful glass teapot. Even the bottle of water had cute patterns imprinted on it. Moreover, what we absolutely loved was the little toy-like woollen cylinder in which they served us the bill. Right from the set-up to the service, everything reinforces the fairy-tale phenomenon executed with perfection .

Overall it was a different and refreshing experience. We suggest you pay a visit to Mrs Magpie, ideally for a Sunday Brunch with a date ;)

Well ....Mrs.Magpie is Cindrella's Land , a place to whoooo you with their sweet offerings . I visited the place a number of times with my friends and I was delighted every time I paid a visit . The sweet pink decor makes you feel you afre in a doll house...so its a great place to take the kids tooo !!!!

Every time I visit there .... the sinful HOT CHOCOLATE is on the list !!! It tastes heaven to the taste buds...and the texture is thick and Chocolaticious !!! Their Cappuccino is also good ... with a thick frothy texture !!  The Ham and Cheese quiche is also a must have .. !! The stuffing is great and better than the other places I have tried it !!! And for the sandwich section ... I always go for their chicken Club sandwich !! Their scones are pretty good too ... I ordered the Blackcurrent scone and it was served with jam , cream and Butter (BRITISH..isnt it ?) ..!!

As for the pretty cupcakes.....they have a variety of offerings . The cupcakes come in two sizes ...but I would recommend to always go for the bigger one ... as the smaller ones are bite sized !! The ones I like the most are Sweet n Salty,with a pinch of salt bag inside the cupcake,the Marshmallow and the after 8-ish . Although ,the other ones are good tooo !!

So....all foodies ....this is a must visit place !! Giving it a 4.5 :)

When you walk into Mrs. Magpie the first thing that instantly strikes you is the d√©cor which will remind of your priceless childhood days with Enid Blyton books being your companion. The picture postcard perfect Barbie fairy tropia d√©cor punctuated by cute as button cupcakes and piping hot savouries is what I recommend to a teenager‚Äôs first B-day treat to friends or to de-stress after your exams. Anytime and everytime Mrs. Magpie will steal your heart and will leave you craving for more. I tried the mini cupcakes- Sweet and salty and marshmallow. Not only was it tasted like you could gulp down few more but what caught my fancy was the topping of ladybird and honeybee! Yummy and cuteness, so now you know where to head for your li‚Äôl tea party with your gang of girls or mixed company..:)

In my last few days in Kolkata, i am on a mission to eat out at the best places in Kolkata. I was refered by a friend to visit Mrs. Magpie. Unable to resist my temptation for cupcakes, I along with my friends visited this "Strawberry - Cheese - Marzipan - Cake" looking shop. I couldn't hold my excitement looking at the platter of colourful, innovative and beautiful cup-cakes. We ordered for 8 different flavours of cupcakes and I must say none failed to surprise us.

Addition to the sinfully delicious cupcakes, a Chicken Ham Club sandwich and a glass of cold coffee was ordered. Absolutely ingenious!!!! The sandwiches were big and generously stuffed with cheese, egg, chicken and bacon. The bacon was so crisply perfect and the taste of it completely in place. All of us absolutely loved the sandwiches with the chips.

The ambiance was as beautiful as the cupcakes. As a special request, they had given us 2 Mini cupcakes - One with Baileys and the other with Cointreau liquor!!! We couldn't thank them more for the wonderful delight.

Well, Mrs. Magpie.... I am surely gonna miss you and you are going in the "To- do" list of mine whenever I visit the city of joy!!!

Lately been trying the regular frosted cupcakes out here. Head there post dinner & takeway for a sweet nimble in the car.

The cinnamon n apple -  cherry cream cheese, both are a delight. 

Wish they would stay open past 11pm. Most restaurants in the zone, take last orders @ 2230 hrs, so why would a confectionery shut before. I am certain, they are missing out on, post dinner business.

Tucked away in a lane just off the lakes in South Cal, Mrs. Magpie is every little Enid Blyton reader's dream cafe. While the food isn't specifically British, you do get your hot scones with butter, and a large, steaming pot of tea. I am not a fan of scones in general, because they are so, um, buttery, but then the quality of scones available here is very good.

There are a variety of cupcakes available, and all are characterised by their moistness, freshness, and can be really dense. We play it safe by ordering the mini cupcakes. They are tiny, but the density of the cake, and the dollop of flavoured, creamy topping more than makes up for the size. I shall not recommend any particular cupcake; although future visitors must be warned that Mrs. Magpie has taken off the Toffee Coffee cupcakes off the menu, at least for now. :(

I haven't had too many savouries here. I did try the Afternoon Tea for Two. At almost Rs. 500, it is a tad over priced, but the sheer volume of food in it easily serves three. The sandwiches in this combination were excellent: the freshness of the bread and the moistness of the filling were beautiful. The scones were really warm, stuffed with sultanas, and served with delicate little curls of butter. There were four mini cupcakes, with the signature marzipan figure (my almond cupcake had a cutesy little Piglet, from the Winnie-the-Pooh series that I loved), and the tea came with tiny little ginger-flavoured biscuits.

I tried a ham-and-mushroom puff, and a shepherd's pie. The ham and mushroom puff wasn't worth the expectation: I hardly could find any ham or mushroom, and neither was it flavoured well. The puff was flaky, crisp, and everything that a puff should look like.

And finally I must describe the Shepherd's Pie. These are small pies, slightly larger than an average cupcake, golden-brown in colour and as well-shaped as a pie in a picture-book. I took a small bite, and for the next ten minutes, I was completely immersed in the experience. The minced meat inside was the softest, creamiest, juiciest meat I have ever tasted, and it came with its own set of mild flavours, with the creaminess and flavour of cheese always there, and yet never overpowering the taste of the meat. If Zomato allowed us to rank specific food items, I'd rank the Shepherd's Pie an 8/10. I take away 2 because it could be bigger, or lesser priced. 

The ambience of Mrs. Magpie is unique in its pinkness and charm, the aroma of freshly baked goods and the tinkle when the door opens, and the little wonderland of cake decor that sparkles inside the glass window.

All in all, a must-visit, and must-eat!

Needless to say, one of the best newer caf√©s this city has had. And I, not being a cupcake lover as such, will definitely recommend their cupcakes! Very happy vibes with the decor et al. Tad slow on the service but maybe they can work on it!

From outside the shop seemed like a strawberry cake,  as soon as I entered I fell in love with the decor. It us just like a fairytale land. It was a first time experience and thanks to Zomato. 
Actually I went there to order the anniversary cake. The person whom I ordered told me to wait for some time and the decor just attracted me to see every corner. I was spellbound!  Oh my God! It seemed as if I landed into the land of dreams! :)
I had also bought mini cupcakes which was so small and cute little thing to eat. I took four of them.  Among which the best was "sweet n salty chocolate", followed by "apple brandy", "peanut butter" and lastly the "after 8 ish". Each were priced Rs.35/-

I wish all of them were less in calories so that I could have more and more..... !!!

I am dying to go again and eagerly waiting to have a look on that anniversary cake!

I was so into the food and beverages that I simple forgot to click. To an extent, did not bother to distract myself from the pick-bite-slurp-go nom nom.

Four of us after a nice, long session of intellectual smoking stimulation :P felt quite hungry and walked our way to Mrs Magpie. Our orders - Shepherd's pie, Ham and cheese quiche, two bacon and chicken club sandwiches, strawberry shake, regular hot chocolate, cappuccino, a lemony cupcake. 
The ham and cheese quiche was impeccable. Sufficiently stuffed with cheese and ham, the quiche was perfectly baked. I basically did not even crave for ketchup with it. It was simple, did not create explosions of anything else but cheese and ham on the tongue and satisfied me. The shepherd's pie was again impressive but a tad too tiny! :( You just can't have something that small and be soulfully happy! The sandwiches were big and generously stuffed with cheese, egg, chicken and bacon. The bacon was so crisply perfect and the taste of it completely in place. All of us absolutely loved the sandwiches with the chips. The best part probably being it wasn't too fancy or fancy at all. The strawberry shake was definitely the best shake I have ever had. Four of us sipped it to the zenith in flat two minutes. It simply just vanished down our oesophagus.  The cappuccino was good but nothing to gaga about. The lemony cupcake was nice, nothing extraordinary though. I enjoyed the lemon aftertaste from the cupcake.

What HAS TO BE THE SHOWSTOPPER OF THE DAY is the HOT CHOCOLATE. The waiter while taking down the order described it as thick European hot chocolate. My expectations rose, I waited with patience. The cup arrived. I sipped. I died for a split few seconds and came back reinvigorated to life. The hot chocolate is insane. It is crazy. It is more than an aphrodisiac. My friend called it a cup of mouthgasm. It is smooth, thick, a perfect hot chocolate drink that leaves chocolate stains on the lips, cheek, saucer. Every time I sipped it, I wanted it to be freezing cold, hold a hot cup of it and stare into the oblivion expecting nothing out of life. Fantasy.

All I can think and dream about now is the hot chocolate. God, grow me cocoa in my garden!

What is there not to love about this place ? A quick visit to  'Alice in Wonderland' and being invited to the Mad Hatter's Tea Party. That is my feeling every time we visit Mrs Magpie and order their Special Afternoon Tea for two. Its a lot for two people actually. But what i love the most, here are the Ham and Cheese Quiche and the Mushroom Quiche. Cant have enough of these. Also the rich chocolate, cheesecake and masala chai ice cream. Absolutely ingenious! But then what steals the show is definitely the Cup Cakes. Tiny and  uniquely decorated, each one is surprise burst of flavor in the mouth. My all time favorite is the Nutty Praline and Cream and Cherry. I wish they introduced some cheese-cakes in the menu.  

I would say the ambiance of the place is amazing. But there is a serious space crunch. With it becoming popular day by day, and people flocking in to taste the cupcakes and sharpening their skills with the DSLR [ some times it makes me wonder which one is more important] I am guessing that they should think of some way to increase the sitting area. 

As it stands this little pink den is definitely a 10 on 10 experience for me.

The cup cakes are OKAY but its the ambiance which makes the experience worth while.
The decor is out of a disney fairy tale. If you mood is gloomy and depressed, then just sitting in the cafe and having a cup cake will cheer up your day.

The first thing that strikes you about this place is the decor. Although a bit girly, it makes you feel as if you are in a little girl's doll house. There is pink all over the place. The seating arrangement too is a little girl's fantasy tea party seating arrangement. Then comes the food. The food although not great value for money is still quite good. My personal favourite is the salmon sandwich. Also the pesto chicken with ciabatta is petty good too. Oh and the cheddar puff too. The marzioan cupcakes are the show stealer. The apple praline, brandy and toffee coffee were nice as well. They had sold out all the after 8ish ones which I wanted to try really badly. But at least I have one more reason to go back now. Only thing to complain about is the value for money otherwise a great place.

I have been to Mrs. Magpie a couple of time since it's walking distance from my place and because of referrals from friends. I have had Cheddar Puff, Mutton Empanadas, Ham N Cheese Quiche and quite a few of the cupcakes and marzipans.

The Ham n Cheese Quiche is the best quiche I have probably ever had in India - clearly the recipe is the same as what one gets in Europe. The rest of the stuff were quite average including the cupcakes and marzipans. When I say average, it is not that the quality is average, it is just that the quantity is so abysmally small, that the taste has disappeared even before you have kind of begun. Every single item (whether confectionery or savoury) is piddly in size but the prices are quite fantabulous for the quantity served. There are quite a few type of sandwiches as well (don't think they feature in the menu) but havn't tried them out.

The best part about the store is it's ambience - the place will be a children's delight. But the shop is not on the main road, unless you know you will need to search for it a little. The name is very thoughtful. Also, whether the cutlery or the cups and saucers or the chairs and tables, all have been purchased clearly with a lot of thought - you are likely to feel that you are in a shop in Europe rather than in India.

This review is dedicated to the new Marzipan cupcakes. I went there for tea recently , and ended up ordering four mini cupcakes because OHMYGOD they were so cute!!!! Initially, there was a wait, which my friend and I spent by taking photographs outside the cafe. As soon as a table emptied up, the server called us in. We ordered one of each - Nolen gur cupcake, nutty chocolate praline marzipan cupcake (because it had a pig head on top), after eight cupcake (marzipan) and sweet and salty cupcake (salted caramel Yo!). The nolen gur cupcake frosting tasted like Nolen gur flavored soft chewing gum. However, all three marzipan cupcakes were very good. We also ordered a ham and cheese quiche (buttery, flaky pastry, smooth, silky egg, and a lot of chopped ham), ham and mushroom puff (mostly forgettable), Darjeeling tea, raisin scones (nice), and latte (again, very good).  They initially made a mistake and brought me tea, but quickly rectified and got coffee. The server was very nice and he was right on the money when he talked about fresh quiches. They don't serve sugarfree with their coffee, which, btw, I support, for Mrs. Magpie is a place where you should truly leave the fear of calories behind. Our bill was just under 500/- for the mini-carnage.

----- 30 Nov, 2013 -----

Okay, so I went to Mrs. Magpie on a day I was not feeling too good, but here is my take on it, as I saw.

1. The scones. Fresh. Tasty. Gorgeous. and the strawberry jam, cream and butter were just perfect.

2. The decor is very nicely done. 

3. The Chicken Sandwich was really nice. Tasty and very well-made. 

I would have to say, a good place to be. However, my partner and I both agreed that the cupcakes could have been better. That was slightly too dry for my taste.

This cafe is frequented by my friends from South Calcutta and I have been here once. I found it to be quite alright. I had ordered green tea and I liked the flavour very much. I had also ordered a chicken patty which was alright. My friend ordered a cupcake. I had a small bite and I found it to be okay. Overall, I would say the feel was a bit too prim, proper and doll-house-like for me but then Im sure that this is the decor a lot of people like. y friends sure did. I like decors with darker overtones!

I would suggest you go and hang out in case you want to have a nice time at a cafe and do not like the excess professional look of CCD!

Mrs Magpie and Cupcakes! I have been hearing about this for such a long time from people and looking at the wonderful reviews in Zomato, I could not stop myself from visiting this place along with my friend. Locating the place was not much of a problem. When we reached, it was full but luckily there were chairs kept outside and we did not mind waiting over there. It is all decked up for Christmas. A total visual treat. The decoration sets the mood in for Christmas. I loved the entrance door with a nice bell hanging.

Coming to the menu, I already knew what to order. Chocolate Milk Shake, Nutty Praline and Marshmallow cupcakes, and one chicken slider. The Chocolate Milk shake came in a huge glass, it was so frothy and smooth. I absolutely loved the quantity and the taste. I loved the nutty praline cupcake more than the marshmallow. The latter was just too sweet for me. The chicken sliders were pretty good, served with chips. The waiters were courteous and the service was really good. I loved the presentation.

I visit this place regularly as it's very close to my workplace. Apart from the delicious liquor cupcakes, tarts and  quiches, the black coffee has become my poison. It's just perfect, just the way I like it. A great place to sit and relax.

This place is pretty as a picture and is like a scene out of a British Novel :) (And very PINK. :p I don't usually love the color pink but for this little place I don't mind it. ) When you step in , you are first reminded that you have stepped into this pretty as a picture Patisserie :) Now, let's come to the Cupcakes shall we ?
 The tiny bite sized cupcakes are the talk of the town ! I always abhorred the concept of tiny bite sized pieces of anything unless they are chocolates, I mean food needs to be fulfilling right ? :P The cupcakes are made by Cupcake God/ Goddess. Absolutely. Soft, Moist , and incredibly flavorful. I have tried all the flavors and I cannot fault anyone though nutty praline is my personal favorite and the marsh mellow too ! 
The Milkshake, oh so frothy and light, perfect accompaniment. 
The Savories are also top notch. The Sandwiches are melt in your mouth served with a side of crispy potato chips. The bacon sandwich is  a meat lover's delight. The chicken sandwich is light and not overpowering. 
Now, I am going to mention THE STAR OF THE SHOW. - MASALA CHAI ICE-CREAM .
This is my favorite Ice cream after chocolate of course ! I know some will think it's ridiculous and I might have a twisted palate but THIS IS AN AMAZING INVENTION. Genius. So those of you who dare ? Try it. Please do. :) 
Mrs. Magpie is the Cupcake destination.

From the food to the decor, everything is eye-candy. Bite sized eatables - perfect to keep the conversation going! Great Darjeeling tea that is served in a beautiful glass tea-pot. The miniloafs and teacakes taste amazing and go great with the tea. For those with a sweet tooth, there is an array of cupcakes.

A little fantasy world on Southern Avenue....it looks like its straight out of a childrens' story book....so colourful and so pretty. It was suggested by a friend, the price is a little high in comparison to the quantity, but the cupcakes were heavenly, specially loved the after 8 cupcake. Its a lovely place to visit once in a while when you want to get away from the cliche cafes.

Update of 24 May 2014. My wife and daughter came along. Enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. Apart from the friendly welcome, the food always lifts our mood. The Coronation Chicken sandwich was delicious as always. The Meatloaf Sandwich was not as great maybe, a tad too salty and overpriced. The potato salad along with it was very classy! The Chicken Hotpot was fairly well cone, as was the Ham and Cheese Quiche. My wife was very pleased with her Darjeeling Tea and I enjoyed my Cafe Americano. I was longing for the Cheesecake Icecream which we both had. 
--------------------------------------------------------

Update of 01 May 2014. A visit with foodie friends. Tried some of the new stuff. The Croquet Monsieur was interesting, but I thought the white sauce (rather cream cheese) was a bit too floury, Was over salty too. A dash of sweet perhaps would have made it interesting, but then again perhaps not considering it had mustard flavouring. The Cold coffee was strong and well made. The cheesecake icecream was awesome. Do try it out folks. Its made completely with natural ingredients and flavouring.
---------------------------------------------------------

A revisit to this popular place turned out to be more pleasant than previous visits. My wife and I had dropped in one November evening, happy to get a place to sit. Decided to go easy and just order the regular Afternoon Tea for Two. The Darjeeling tea was just right... well served, making all of 2.5 cups! Came served with a small gingerbread man biscuit. Lovely and crisp. Must buy some to take home next time. The finger sandwiches served as part of the package tasted great even though the bread wasn't exactly soft. We had the coleslaw (possibly made with purple cabbage) which had a nice mustardy zing and their chicken sandwich, always tasty They also have the option of an egg sandwich. Two whole sandwiches are served, cut up into four slices each, making it a total of eight slices. With that we got four sultana scones (no options here) that went well with the butter and preserves served with it. Finally, we got to try four of the smaller cupcakes from the collection. Tried the (I think) Swet & Salty and the After 8'ish, the latter one nicely pepperminty, without being overbearing. All in all a warm delightlful experience, one I would recommend. Service is always quick and friendly. ----- 12 Oct, 2013 ----- My wife had been wanting to drop in for a while, so we did today, Asthami 2013. We called up to find out where it was located but the phone went unanswered. Thankfully the gentleman called back, but was unable to give precise directions. After asking around for the Dhaba, we finally found the place. Nice clean set up, airiness around it, unlike other cramped spaces. There is a decent variety of food on offer, best part being that it is not the run of the mill chicken patties and its ilk. Order-taking was efficient. Service was pleasantly quick. I had asked for a bacon and cheese club sandwich, which I was not too pleased with. I think the bread was too salty. Also, a pineapple in a club sandwich is a must! You need that wet sweetness :) The coffee was acceptable. The bit of cupcake I tried was very interesting. I must admit it is the first time for me. The one I tasted had strawberry mixed into the cake itself. Nice! The brownie was tasty. A nice touch is that the coffees and the teas are accompanied by a small cookie. It feels large-hearted! The crockery used is simple and elegant. I loved the large water tumblers. An annoyance was the fly buzzing around me! The place is done up cheerily. Not all of it match, but who cares! A surprise was the bill. removing the sandwich, it meant a couple of coffees, a green tea, a brownie and two small cupcakes were for around Rs 350. Very reasonable indeed.

I'd heard so much about this place from my friends and had been wanting ro come here from quite sometime and I finally managed to do so yesterday evening. I was completely mesmerised by the way the place is done up! It was reminiscent of Hansel and gratel with so many goodies inside a small picturesque hut. Even the tables and chairs are so much like ones described in children's bedtime stories which I would enjoy in those good old days.

Each thing is so creatively done be it the menu in slate or the old style windows covered up smartly.Although tables look small but for a coffe place its good enough. Bottles to serve regular water and small sized platter for serving have all been done keeping table size in mind.So no time would one feel too cramped up.

SInce my friend had been here before I left to her to order the eateries. Strawberry shake I'd asked for was too sweet but then on telling them they made it to suit my palate. Sandwich which we'd ordered was really good. Bread was soft and the filling was very fresh.

Although the place was full considering weekend also,it had a peaceful environment.We old friends were meeting after quite sometime and it was a perfect place to catch up.Also the waiter wasn't dancing over our heads for further order or with bill unlike other cafe.In fact,we had to call for the bill and it came to us as a shocker. For all we had ordered including all kibds of taxes it was mere 179! I thought they had left some item from billing by mistake.To compensate for the low billing i decided to take some goodies home too!

All in all it was a fairytale experience I would say and surely would love to come here again and again for a break from the big bad world!

A very bad first experience and will not go back.
I wanted to order mutton quiche. I was told "the bacon sandwich is awesome" so I changed my order to a " bacon sandwich". What I was served was a club sandwich with bacon, chicken and egg. When I called the waiter and pointed out that I was never told it was a club sandwich, and I dont eat egg, he said he will "take out the eggs". I said I dont want the chicken either, he said he will change it. Minutes later I was served the same sandwich with the eggs and parts of the chicken out. thre were microscopic bits of bacon left, breads were soggy, it still smelt of egg. I gathered the scanty bacon bits from all the slices and ate one of the four slices. I absolutely saw nothing "awesome" about the sandwich, and about the way it was handled !!! And this pathetic thing for 285/- !!!!!!!
We were also told that the cupcakes are good. We asked for a plain one. The waiter insisted we try the Diwali special chocolate one. We said we would prefer a plain one. The waiter insisted on the chocolate one saying its special for Diwali and its not too chocolaty. We again said - no thank you, plain one please. He obliged, went away with the order, came back again and said the chocolate one is mildly chocolaty and he is getting one. Disgusted, we said okay fine. It was so damn bad, a bite and we left it. If waiters are not qualified enuf to suggest order, they might as well keep their mouths shut. 
The cute decor wont be enuf dear owner......

I had been hearing and reading about Mrs Magpie ever since I landed in Kolkata in May, and had made my mind up to be severely judgemental about it, being the dessert fanatic I am. Well, the ratings would prove that my visit didn't really prove to be futile for Magpie's best interests. I intend to be back soon and as frequently as possible. The cupcakes are truly bitesize. However, that means you can try out as many flavours as you want. And, they do taste really good. The savouries, too, are dainty and I did savour the mutton empanada and the broccoli, mushroom and pepper tart. A lot. It's not just that they are good to taste: savouries in a patisserie serve the purpose of coffee in a perfume shop; they cleanse your palate and don't let the sweetness overpower. The only complaints I found with Mrs Magpie were the fact that their choices of cupcakes were limited and the space a bit cramped. The second problem, I reckon, can be solved as it opens up branches throughout the city (and maybe in England, too, so it's closer home for me). *Hint, hint!* As for the choices, I would be really happy if they bring out newer ones. However, the fact remains that they put in their best for all the choices they have...
The best surprise was when they presented us a complimentary box with two of their cupcakes: only massive versions. :)

This is undoubtedly one of my favorite places to chill out in .... like I always say its my "happy place ". Mrs Sohini Behrens the genius behind Mrs Magpie is like a Pastry Wizard .... she casts a spell on you with her fantastic products and innovations. Her genius at Marzipan work is among the best in the country and her Bespoke Cakes that are my staple for every occasion and function in my family and are super hits .... absolute block busters. I try to stop by every few days for my Magpie fix .... and I always leave with a smile. I missed out on her Valentine goodies this year as I was out of town but I made up for it yesterday when I got to sample her Easter Goodies. She changes her shop window every now and then and its usually seasonal and always thematic ... like an overgrown kid I wait for every new one with unabashed glee. This one was super cute as well and I have attached pictures. 
Last evening we sampled some new additions. The fantastic Croque Monsieur  which she describes as  " a slightly trimmer version of the decadent french style grilled ham and cheese sandwich " lovely stuff and loved the little tickle the mustard gives your taste buds .... its basically a crisp toasted slice of bread on which mustard and a thick slice of ham is placed ... a cheese sauce is poured over and its baked.... rustic flavor at its very best... we loved it. A gorgeous Chicken Pot Pie that I found decidedly "English" in flavor and presentation which was lovely and simple and a perfect little snack to go with your evening "cuppa". Warm Hot Cross Buns which I adored and want more of !!! We packed her fantastic Ham & Cheese Quiche  ( the best in town in my opinion ) , Mini-Shepherds Pies and a Vegetable Quiche to carry home with us all of which were excellent. 
Now lets come to the sweet stuff .... we ordered a mini-banoffee pie which was presented in a dark chocolate espresso cup which was lovely. They have a chocolate mousse version as well that I had sampled on an earlier occasion and loved. The German Tree Cake is something I have never had .... this is inspired from a special German celebration cake known as Baumkuchen. It is referred to as the king of cakes as baking this treat is an extremely time consuming process. The cake is baked in several layers, each one baked separately.Theirs is baked with apricot jam and covered with chocolate. This is there only for the Easter Menu and certainly something I will head back for. Lastly we had a Easter Special Cake .... they are shaped like eggs and the one I choose was made into a yellow chick ... the best part if you cut it open the inside is an egg made with layers of Marzipan, Cake and a Raspberry Jelly. 
Her famed high - teas , finger sandwiches and other regulars items are always very good but we had no space for those yesterday alas ... will have to go back quickly for more ;-)

Mrs Magpie has just introduced her Puja Specials along with all their other regular yummy treats ! I simply loved the Sliders which are three mini burgers of chicken or mutton layered with caramelised onion, cheese and tomato which were really nice. They have also introduced a special Puja Mini Cupcake which is a delightful combo of caramel, kheer and Sohanpapri which is delicious. Also not to be missed the very smooth and tasty gulab jam Icecream . This place should be a must visit for all the pandas hopping foodies !

I have been frequenting Mrs.Magpie regularly since its opening and I have to give kudos to the owner Sohini and her team. Not only has she succeeded in maintaining the quality and taste of her delicious cupcakes but she has constantly innovated and added to her repertoire with fantastic additions to the menu. Her shop window displays are an absolute delight and thrill you with their perfection and attention to detail time and again (pictures below). Her marzipan work is flawless and undoubtedly the best in the city both in terms of taste and look. The Ham and Cheese Quiche and the Roasted Mutton Focaccia Sandwich are my personal favourites and I highly recommend them to one and all. Recently she has added ice-creams and sorbets and I really enjoyed both the Plum and Pineapple Flavours of the sorbets. Delicious and not too many places in the city serve sorbet, they are available in two sizes of servings. The club-sandwich with a chicken and bacon filling that has been recently added is also excellent and last time I went the staff was kind enough to make me sample a Mutton Pizza which had delicious flavours and was soon to be added to the menu. I would also like to make a special mention for the made to order cakes for special occasions .... designs are personalised and you can choose to have them made in the flavour of your favourite cupcake if you desire .... Mrs.Magpie also provided cupcakes and a wedding cake for a friends wedding and did a superb job. 
This has become one of my favourite places to visit in the city and I look forward to my next fix of their divine sweet and salty cupcake soon !!!!

----- 10 Dec, 2012 -----

I have been wanting to go pay this delightful Cafe a visit for a while and finally got to make it yesterday : ). It was a wonderful experience just walking into it .... bright , beautiful and transports you instantly to a wonderful warm place that makes the child in you come alive.... the displays are fantastic and the produce the yummiest of its kind ........ I am absolutely in love with the Sweet n Salty Cupcake and I kid you not when I say its probably one of the best cupcakes I have eaten anywhere !!We also tried the Lemon Surprise and the Double Strawberry Cupcakes which were wonderful ! Their marzipan work is an art that they have honed to perfection and I was tempted enough to buy an adorable little Piglet that looked so cute that I did not feel like eating it (though I am glad I did because it was super yummy ! ).I highly recomend this place to every foodie and also those who need to order birthday cakes for adults and kids or parties and festive occasions.  Cant wait to come back and try the afternoon tea for two ... Fantastic work guys !!! Just what Kolkata needed !

I was told by a friend about this place near southern avenue and the very day i took my fiance there for an evening tea. The decor is just like the ones we read in british children's illustrated story books. We orderd English tea a Cappacino chicken finger sandwiches, ham and cheese quiche and one after eight cupcake and two marzepine cupcakes. The cupcakes where moist , tasted heavenly. Tea which was served was twining so it was not something we where expecting as we dont generally get served packet tea bags when we order tea as it is very convinient. The sandwich was soggy. And the price was exuberant.

now this is what i call a cafe rather THE CAFE..It‚Äôs not a place that you see and enter. It‚Äôs a place that you see, stop, stare, and then enter. Mrs Magpie, the newest kid on the cake-cafe block and what a gala entry it had made... There are stained glass windows, there are antique pieces and there is a dokra door chime. Birds and butterfly motifs fly on the walls. Japanese cherry blossom wallpaper meets vintage meets micro dots and stripes..the window pane showcases a birdhouse-dollhouse kinda effect and there are other various residents such as beetles etc...what i loved most apart form the food and the warmth is when you ask for water..the waiters serve you a bottle(cutely designed) and pitchers for free of cost which is a very rare scenario in any other cafe in kolkata where you need to buy a small bottle for a heavenly price..cupcakes are yummy..they both look and taste great..quiches and sandwiches are lip-smacking...Chicken Ratatouille Tart, Chicken and Cheddar Puff, and Broccoli Mushroom ‚Äô‚Äô Pepper Tart..just name it and you have got it perfectly made for you with the right amount of expertise and adequate proportion of love..i am overjoyed..all food lovers must visit this wonderland..my request..please go..

After going through all the reviews, I decided to give this place a try. GoogleMaps helped a lot in giving us directions through a couple of little roads along Southern Avenue. Upon entering the sweet little place, its fairytale ambience and the chime of the bell at the door ushered happiness already. We started by ordering two little cupcakes, but the ended up gorging on quite a few of them, thanks to the superb look and the equally awesome taste! The chocolate shake served in the little cup is to die for. Prices might be on the higher side, but no other place can give an experience as blissful as Mrs.Magpie. A must try!

The thing about Mrs. magpie is that for the time you are here you will surely be in one of your fairy tales! You can go back to being a child and dig into all those cute¬† and tasty food!
¬†it's like an enchanted chocolate house, 
the  food including the cupcakes are fab ,but a little overpriced keeping in mind the quantity!

It would have been better if the area was bigger as most of the times now , since it is well known now, it is crowded and you have to sit down on the bench outside which is cute too , but the wait is not :D

I loved it, would go again and again and again

This is a quaint little caf√©, with its d√©cor straight out of children story books i.e. delicate and beautiful. The location is kind of secluded, and if you are not a local of that area, then it will be kind of difficult for you to reach the venue at one go. I am well aware of quite a few food enthusiasts (both teen and adults) who upon reading good reviews of this place, set out to enjoy the delicacies, but returned back because they were unable to locate it! The management can look into this matter i.e. prepare the staff with the right technique to answer the location related phone queries.

Cupcakes are a revelation here and also pretty fresh and tasty. They are available in two sizes. The small ones are really cute and are available in very attractive and innovative icings. We also tried cold finger sandwiches, but they were not at all soft. Maybe because neither were they prepared impromptu, nor were they covered in wrap-ons.

Overall, the experience here is nice and relaxing. Artistic people will definitely like it, specially the writers. This is one caf√© (maybe the only one in Kolkata) which gives you the relaxing and creative vibes required to pen down your thoughts amidst relishing the caf√© savouries.

A small little pink shop right next to my house. i was seeing it for a couple of days before i thought of going in. and boy! was i in for a treat. from sandwiches to cupcakes to tea to coffee. they are perfectionists who have the best tea time snacks to offer. 

my only problem was that everything was so top notch other than the waiter and the cashier who knew way to less for their own comfort. 

a must visit and everything in the shop feels like was made minutes back just for you. and the homely feeling you get there is worth something to check out.

on the other hand i do wish they served some more items in vegetarian but hopefully keeping their quality and taste in place

It was just yesterday that I wrote a hefty review praising the shop called Cakes, and how I had grown to love it over the years. Little did I know that I would almost have to eat my words when I discovered this joint called Mrs. Magpie, near Lake Girls School, Gariahat. Much has been said about the interiors, the decorations, the and the overall layout of the place, but I believe a picture says a million words, and so, have submitted numerous photos with this review for the better judgment of future patrons.

Firstly, I would like to rectify a few fellow reviewers, who said this place is not accessible via GPS. Punch in ‚ÄúMrs. Magpie, Lake Terrace Road‚Äù in Google Maps, and it will lead to straight to the front door of the caf√© (atleast that‚Äôs what I did to test the GPS theory). It was a pleasant surprise to find the place full even though it was a Sunday evening and it had been raining torrentially since morning. Not for a single instant did I find any table empty, the steady flow of customers was omnipresent. 

We were just two people, and  we ordered Assam tea, Americano coffee, the Cookie platter, Grilled Chicken sandwiches, and the Ham n Cheese Quiche (Check photos). All the orders arrived within 10 minutes, impressive for such a rush hour. Tea was served in a pot, with sugar cubes and milk separate, coffee was accompanied by brown sugar. The cookies were tasty, each retaining their individual flavor, and neither of them overpowering. My favourite was the white one, which I believe was the almond cookie. The ham and cheese quiche was tasty too, the pie cooked perfectly. But the portions served was too small. When you spend Rs. 75 on a quiche, you expect the slice to be bigger than just three bites. No complaints about the sandwiches, they were easily the best sandwiches I have had in a long while. Three triangles of bread, stuffed with eggs, chicken and tomatoes, grilled to utter crispiness, was a match made in heaven. The hero of our meal was easily the sandwiches. 

Before leaving, we decided to try one of their famous ‚Äúmini‚Äù cupcakes. Truly, the cupcakes are really small. One could finish one cupcake easily in one bite. Yes, larger sizes are available, but then they again cost around Rs 75 per piece, and I reckon most people wouldn‚Äôt wish to spend such an amount on a mere cupcake. Anyway, since I am a chocoholic, I opted for the After 8‚Äô ish cupcake. And after one bite, I wished I hadn‚Äôt ordered it at all. The cake was really dry, and crumbled apart into a heap. The topping was supposed to be mint chocolate. However , the mint flavor completely overpowered any smell, taste or trace of the chocolate. It was like eating a deep brown ball of intensely flavoured mint. My friend remarked that it was as if we had swallowed a tube of Colgate toothpaste. I totally agreed. 

Cupcakes aside, the place is worth a visit for some snacks, with tea or coffee. It surely is popular, but the cupcakes are way over-rated. I recommend the sandwiches to all and will be visiting again for another bite.

PS- The bill for two came to Rs 540, a tad expensive, thus making it a place one would visit occasionally.

PPS- Mrs. Magpie also makes birthday cakes, but one has to order at least three days in advance.

Went there after hearing a lot about it. The decor is cute, though it was spolied by a tiktiki that seemed to arrive from nowhere. It was handled well by the staff. The cupcakes were good, but perhaps a tad too sweet (yes, I know, cupcakes are supposed to be sweet). The sandwiches were OK - not outstanding. The peanut butter cupcake was excellent. My wife liked the hot chocolate. The latte was good. Overall a pleasant experience. But way too much sugar.

I confess; I visited Mrs. Magpie because of ridiculously high Zomato rating and an group of awfully persistent friends. I was really looking forward to becoming a convert and gushing about this cozy little place. But after spending well over Rs. 500, I have to say, it's more hype than happening.

The tinkle of the bell on the door, the charming decor (pink walls, floral wallpaper- the whole deal)- it definitely looked like something Lewis Caroll would have written about. In fact, the low chair and tables you sort of have to hunch over reminded me distinctly of Alice in Wonderland. Another source of curiosity were the tableaus on the table along the windows- we kept arguing if they were real cakes (and I hope they weren't, I wonder who would buy or eat a cake left out in the open like that).

Anyway, coming to the food, we ordered three cupcakes- Nutty Praline, Toffee Coffee, Lemon Surprise- milkshakes, hot chocolate and an assorted cookie platter. First surprise of the array were the cupcakes. The Lemon surprise had a funny taste that I didn't particularly like, the toffee praline had a cloying, almost-oily topping, the Nutty Praline was more like chocolate icing with nuts in it that a rich praline. All the cupcakes were sort of crumbly, far from the moist, soft texture I want in my cupcakes. I agree, they were really pretty, but I could have never imagined that cupcakes can come in such tiny sizes. The bottom was honestly just a little bigger than a coin. The flavours were not nearly good enough to justify the price. Second surprise: the milkshakes came in little cups. Yes, I agree the whole Alice in Wonderland feels great, but when the scaling down creeps into food, you have lost me. I simply cannot accept a cold beverage in a teacup. The cookie platter had a handful cookies, but I was disappointed that there was no thumbprint cookie and they looked pretty bland too. The nutty tasting cookie was good to eat with the hot chocolate. The hot chocolate is strictly for those who intensely love chocolate, for others it may taste too rich. It's more of a dessert sauce than a beverage actually. We ended with the rich chocolate ice-cream; it was indeed very rich and the highlight of the spread. 

I cannot help but feel like the food here has acquired a Veblen good status and reaps the 'it's-pricey-therefore-it's-good' effect. As I judge my ratings solely on food, the decor, despite being, great, is ultimately irrelevant and I have to rate Mrs. Magpie 3.0.

The first word that comes to the mind when you enter the place is "Pretty". Right from the decor to the cup cakes everything is so pretty.Just like a page from fairytale.You would actually feel like taking those colorful cup cakes home and use them as decor.They are super cute.At first I didnot feel like eating them.
Kept staring and admiring and took a couple of pics.Once i took a bite it just melted.Yummy!! Best cup cakes ever had.

Other than cup cakes other dishes are good.

Service is good.I felt the prices are bit on the higher side.But would love to re--visit for the cup cakes .
Overall this place is a must visit once.

PS:Take your girl friends along ,guys might get a bit left out in the pink and pretty environment.

Cheers to team Mrs Magpie for the superb innovation.

Cons:  Too noisy since its a small place and one noisy person can make the atmosphere noisy, too costly for the average taste

I came across Mrs. Magpie on Zomato just the other day after a long search for a nice cafe in the city serving the quintessential 'cafe delectables' in an appropriate cafe atmosphere and hence I visited the place with my friend without any further delay. The place has a fairy tale decor where everything from the pillars to the walls to the doors have been done up in soothing pastel colours.  Even the window panes are made up of tinted glasses. Neatly arranged small round tables with small wrought iron chairs add on to the cosy atmosphere inside the cafe. In a nutshell the cafe interiors recreate a fairy tale like set-up quite successfully. My idea of a a perfect European cafe is where the menu is all scribbled across a blackboard and I was overjoyed to see the same in Mrs. Magpie. 

Their cupcake assortments are extremely tempting. The variety of cup-cakes that the place provide are both pleasing to the eyes and also to the taste buds. My personal favourite is definitely the 'sweet-salty' one and also the 'marshmallow' cup-cake. The cakes are so soft and the icing on the top so buttery that it is difficult to be happy with just one. And the size of the cup-cakes are just a bite large so one can easily dare to taste all of them in the menu if selection becomes a difficulty. I also liked their coffee-caramel custard. It had the right balance of the coffee bean and burnt caramel flavour and it melts the moment you put it into your mouth. I did not quite like their marzipan cupcakes maybe because I am not a huge fan of the sugary decorations  but must say that the marzipan designs are quite intricate and flawlessly done. They are surely going to be a big hit among the kids.

I had a grilled bacon and chicken club sandwich which was served with chips. It was really tasty and also it can be easily shared among two people. I loved their ham and cheese quiche which was very light and fluffy with the saltiness of the cheese not being overpowering at all. I however felt that they should increase the number of savoury items in the menu.It would be really nice to see more of pot pies and savoury tarts in the menu. Also may be 2-3 different kinds of soups with bread rolls would  be a nice add-on for the winters. The place is very reasonable as well. 

Overall this place deserves great appreciation for smart thinking and an absolute meticulous execution both on the food as well as the decor front. Its a great place to be on a lazy saturday-sunday afternoon with a group of close friends or just with a good book. Good company-a sip of their coffee-and a bite into their cupcakes....aaah!! life is so good :)

Mrs.Magpie is a nice cozy little corner.It has sweet little cupcakes, finger foods and wide choices of beverages. 
I especially enjoy their creamy frothy hot cappachino (which is no longer available half of the time )  and their triple decker brownie adds brownie points to that! 
It's a nice place to sit and chat with friends. Their ham & cheese quiche also needs a special mention. 
Now the flip side is the place is too small and cannot accomodate more than 10-15 people at a time,  the staff though really earnest in their approach lacks a bit of professional and swift attitude. But I have no complaints about them because a slow staff is any day better than rude, ,obnoxious ones!
I would suggest Mrs.Magpie to reinvent their menu instead of just concentrating on cupcakes ! they should pay more attention to their menu which just needs a face lift! 
All in all a nice place which can be definitely better.
Also these days half of the things are not available, whatever is written in the menu is just a typed paper, the waiter rather recites the menu! 

Please start paying attention, only because people are coming here and it has become a comparatively well known place don't start taking customers for granted

Went there a few days back just to check the place out. It is totally not worth it. We ordered the ham & cheese quiche, which tasted funny and oddly like mutton, which my friend doesn't like and had to leave it after a few mouthfuls. The scones we ordered were pretty unimpressive, it tasted edible with the strawberry jam. Everything was cold. After looking through their menu I had thought of going back there again. But, after tasting the food I don't think I am.
October 30, 2014
So, went back there after more than a year and felt like I needed to change the rating from a mere 2 to 3.5. I am not here to gush about the place, but I did have a much better experience this time. For a change the waiters knew what they were serving us, they were very courteous and attentive. I got treated to the afternoon tea yesterday. I liked the egg mayo finger sandwiches enough to gobble down 3 on a full stomach. Loved the Darjeeling tea (I have my tea sugarless) and the tiny cookie that came with it(it was so full of flavour than I wished they were bigger than a coin size). The scones were actually warm this time, the butter (though still shaped pretty) was soft enough to be spread on the scones. Anyway preferred the scones with the cream and jam.¬† The chicken sandwiches were nice, but I preferred the slight sweetness in the egg one. The cupcakes looked very pretty, but here again I was disappointed. Only liked one of the flavours they served us - nutty praline. But I think we spent a good 2 hours sipping our tea and chatting at the corner table by the window. There was a lot of rush but, we weren't hurried by the waiters to empty our spot. All in all this was a way better experience than before.

Honestly speaking, the quality is not at all good, compared to the price. The shop only got a huge popularity somehow,  that's the only reason for the craze..
i heard about the place from my friends and went there to have my ultimate disappointment.
We ordered cupcakes, we asked the waiter to give their best 5 coz we were unable to choose. When it was served, it looked the cutest. once i had the marshmallow cupcake,  the cake was soo dry and falling into pieces. there are no normal sized cupcakes, only the small ones, which a person can put inside the mouth in one go. utter disappointment.

then was the sandwich.. it was nice though.. just an usual kind..

last was the hot chocolate! it was not a hot chocolate like costa coffee that i expected. it was the hot chocolate that is usually poured over the brownies, hot chocolate ice cream..

so the evening was a complete disappointment for me with a loss of 600 bucks..

MRS. MAGPIE!!! How do I describe it? straight out of Enid Blyton's books to add magic to cafe scene in Kolkata.. I am hooked to it since my first visit!!! First let us come to the service:- very prompt team and doing a good job at that. Very receptive to feedbacks too. Just wanted to share one such experience.. while chatting up with my best buddy, my tea had gone cold. So I requested them to microwave it for 30 secs. 2 mins later a smal pot arrives with freshly made tea.. Keep up the good work guys! Food:- the cupcakes are bite size which allows one  to try one than one flavour. The one with the marzipans are really dreamy.. the savouries are equally good too - Chicken Cheddar Puff, Ham & Cheese Quiche being top favourite. The raisin & cheese buns are hot picks with my family... Kolkata was in want of a tea room situation like this for a long time and finally there's an answer  to it..

a very english tea shop that has an overtone of pink. this is the 1st impression you will have when you step in or as my friend would thr tea party she ever dreamed of. the decor is very refreshing and the cakes look yummy. the place specialises in marzipan cakes and which I would say is the biggest usp. never a big fan of such I tried one cup cake and I had to say it shattered my idea about marzipan which not at all sugary and teeth numbing but had an amazing smoked flavour that left a beautiful aftertaste. but the main aim of our going there was to get a cake for our friends birthday so as tp try something different from cookie jar cakes or flurys. being totally lost about what to order the owner and baker Sohini came to our rescue patiently helping choose the right one. as she single handedly bakes the cake so we had to place the order 24 hrs early. but I had to say the cake tasted as good as it looked. one recommendation bring a lady friend along and see her light up.

Important - dont go without your female partner. She will love it, and you will love it too, as she is loving it. its pink shaded interior and sofa and small chairs will catch your eyes first. if you have a toddler at home, they will love it. it was very noisy while we were there. that helped us, as our daughter was also shouting with excitement and nobody gave 'that' look back at us as everyone was busy chatting. i loved the place, but not giving 5, as the food was not GREAT. its a small place, possibly can accommodate max 25/30 people..be prepared to wait outside for a while if you choose the peak hour. also take the directions from your friend - its in a small lane, finding which is quite difficult even with GPS. they should plan to put some direction boards on Purna Das road.

i visited this place last march to give my four years old niece a little b'day treat.. for her i ordered a sweet and salty chocolate cake and for me an assorted cookie platter(since i'm a big or btr to say biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiig fan of cookies)and strawberry  milkshake..believe me i cake and cookies were heaven-made.
 
about decor??ooh it's very very nice..not only decors but sitting arrangements, everything everything about this place is mind blowing..a very good place  better to say best place for children...even my little niece  who is generally a very timid girl was jumping around the place..the place was actually full of children and they without even knowing each other were happily playing togather
 

a must visit for all who wants to give the little members of their family  a really  memorable party

caution- not a place for people who  expects  calm (almost meditative) atmosphere in cafes..however a  dream place for every adults who starves  to take a holiday from their endless adulthood and is eager to fly back to those golden days when returning from school  u used to rush into ur grand mom's room to  check if she is safely there or a sly Woolf!!!!???????!!!!!!!!!!

'Ideally this is jus a bakery shop".. this is what i kept saying my friends who wanted me to check this place out..i actually wouldn't wanna spend money on buying cakes..

Anyways i did drop into this place..last week..as i had some work in vivekananda park...To start off,, the place was way girly to me..with Pink and pink all around..it seemed like a cute wonderland were only i found pretty faces except Alice.. 

Coming to the "real thing"...the food is awesome..buy any thing..and the way the cupcakes are presented to you..it breaks your heart to actually take a bite and ruin the whole thing...tastes awesome..

I had just one negative thing..thats the location..its way inwards..i had ta talk to 10 different people.. open my GPS thrice to actually locate this place.. 

Would definitely come here..but of course with my cousin who m sure would love to be a part of this world..:P

The first thing you'd notice here is the interiors,so pretty! All pink and decked up like a dollhouse.The food and the service is good,especially the mini cupcakes.
We had the salmon sandwich,the apple and brandy cupcake and green tea all of which were great,though a bit more filling would be appreciated in the sandwich,seeing as the price is on the higher side.Overall a good place,definitely recommend it. :)

This place looks like Elma's Cafe in Delhi, which is one of the reasons I love it so much. Although their food isn't really that great in terms of how it tastes, their hot chocolate is to die for. I don't think I've ever had hot chocolate that tastes this good. Their cupcakes are adorable to look at, most of them covered with marzipan as opposed to the traditional buttercream icing. If you've never eaten a cupcake in your life, you will like Mrs. Magpie. If you're like me, a cupcake enthusiast, the cupcakes here will not taste as good as you expected them to.

This is the best bakery in town in terms of ambience and presentation. I was reminded of the Hansel & Gratel fairy tale where you could see cakes and wonderful delights all around the place and feel like eating up everything. In fact this place caught my attention mainly for its ambience. As you enter,the bell on the door welcomes you with a tiny tinkle. All the tables are provided with the menu card and a tea pot shapdd vase which i particularly liked. This place is expensive and as i was low on money,a salmon sandwich and two mini cup cakes is all we could order. the cup cakes were bite size but very very good. I had salmon here for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it! The sandwich was served with chips. The bill was presented in a beautiful box. Expect for the high cost,which all the bakeries around share in common,this was a perfect experience!

Ambience: Done up in candy colours, this place will appeal to kids for sure. Someone described this place as "Mad Hatter's tea party" in a previous review... that is exactly what my friend said after seeing this place. After sitting here for half an hour or so we all were a little dazed and feeling like characters out of Lewis Carroll's universe.

Food: we wanted no desserts, which is a pity since this place has beautiful looking cup cakes that everyone is singing paeans about. We ordered chicken sandwiches, a strawberry milkshake and ice tea. The sandwiches were of the same shape and size as candy wafers, 4 on a plate, tasted pretty lame; mayonnaise, capsicum and shredded chicken filling doesn't make a great sandwich; and cost 120 Rs per plate! The strawberry milkshake tasted good but was sugary sweet and was impossible to finish as I started feeling nauseous from all the sugar. The ice tea was also too sweet to be good.

I will probably want to go to this place one more time to taste their cup cakes, but I will prefer a takeout. Once again, this place will work great with kids, from the decor to the extreme sweetness of the products, sure to give you a sugar rush to last you a whole day.

Update: cupcakes are very good but burn a hole in your pocket. My 5 year old niece loved the decor but didn't care about the cakes

One day driving through this lane in South Kolkata we found this amazing shop, and we have been going there ever since.

The food is amazing to say the least and especially their cup cakes, they are out of this world. The decorations on the cakes are beautiful. I have been to many places across the world and this shop can stand tall against all of them.

I also ordered a cake for my sister's birthday and the service was excellent. The manager emailed me pictures of the cake's design and I paid online through NEFT and when we had the cake on my sister's birthday it was just beautiful in the literal sense.

The shop, its service, the ambiance, and the decor is so artistically done that we are really big fans of this shop now and we visit it as many a times as possible.

Quite a nice little cafe to be in. First the decor, it's quite HATKE! Though the excess use of pink is little feminine but i think that's what they are trying to show! My girlfriend loved the decor very much though.

The staffs are quite helpful. Magpie is certainly a cafe, but unlike CCD and barista it don't specialise in making coffees and shakes. Rather their high point lies in making beautiful confectionaries.

Well cupcakes are their specialities. at 35/- they are quite cheap, though not well enough in size. Their decorations are pretty good. We tried 3 different cupcakes, all were good, but i liked apple n brandy one more! Do try Ham and cheese quiche, its great.

So overall, a nice little place, in a nice neighborhood, where you can spend the evening while enjoy the beautiful dishes and decors!

Situated in a cosy bylane in south kolkata, this place is straight out of the story books we read when we were young. Decorated tastefully and innovatively, this place gave south kolkata the one thing which has been missing for ages, a place for high tea. Delicious cupcakes, buns, scones and beverages make the perfect place for an informal "adda" on a hot summer afternoon or a rain-washed evening. 
The place is always full, so one might have to wait for a few minutes before you get a seat. Service is okayish, but the waiters are soft spoken and helpful. Though they can definitely improve their sandwiches, their cupcakes and other savouries make it one place worth visiting more than once.
Cheers!!

Probably one of the most regular visitors of this straight-out-of-an-Enid-Blyton-book cafe tucked away in a relatively quiet street, their sweet and salty cupcakes with a mini hot chocolate are simply nothing like you've ever tasted before. If you're in the mood for something savory, their ham and cheese quiche is mind-boggling. From the staff's hospitality to the lovely decor, one can't help but not go back there.

I have ordered two customized cakes in the past for special occasions and if you're willing to be generous then the cakes they will come with will simply leave you speechless. The precision, the quality, the very taste is like no other. 

A perfect place to add a little colour to your day and indulge yourself, Mrs. Magpie really is blessing to this city.

We ordered a 3 pound chocolate cake for a surprise birthday celebration over the phone. The manager suggested a beautiful marzipan topped cake with wild flowers and bugs. Sent a picture too and because of the urgency made an exception to reach it to us the next noon. The design was so new and the idea so fresh. The chocolate cake was moist without being creamy.

The moment you enter Mrs. Magpie, you might very well feel like Snow White might be sitting on the next table with her Prince Charming....And why not!!! The decor represents the setting of a dream fairy tale!!!! PRETTY is the order of the day over here-from the decor, to the menu, to the delicate line of cupcakes on display....
The pricing will make you happy but that usually lasts till the servings come, the cupcakes and savories priced around 35-45 bucks are mostly bite sized.... Decent sized cupcakes cost around 110...That's a bit too much...... But they offer some combos like the afternoon Tea combo for 2 which is quite reasonable (400 bucks)....
Needless to mention, The food is simply delectable..... In the savories, do try the Chicken Ratatouille tart..... N the apple brandy cupcake.... Phenomenal!!!
If not for anything, the place is a must visit just for its decor!!!!

The location, decor and ambiance of this place can easily pass off as the Mad Hatter's tea party.  A place as this was needed in Kolkata. Though a tad over priced (I felt so), the cupcakes are indeed to die for. Those pieces of little heaven can leave you craving for the whole lit cabinet of cupcakes and savories. 
The sandwiches are also equally amazing! Tender and very inviting. You will want to bite it the moment you see it. Coming back to the cupcakes, they are very very soft! I start drooling now as i think of them again! The variety is good. You will also enjoy the window side seat,(not much of a view) but if you are the kind who enjoys watching the occasional car pass by the serene roads.
Overall an amazing experience.
P.s. Do not succumb to the temptation of ordering 'one of each cupcake'.
Cheers

I ordered a cake from Mrs Magpie for my parents' party at Lake club. I do not stay in Kolkata and would be arriving at Kolkata just before the party ( too late to place the order after   reaching  Kolkata). So I called up the number and was walked through the  whole process by a very friendly Mr Saurav . He helped me with the pricing , the design of the cake , the online initial payment . He also gave me a good estimate of the quantity required based on the number of guests. 
      The day before the party when I took my kids to Mrs Magpie - Mr Saurav even said that he would deliver the cake to the venue free of charge.   
     We loved the ambience of the Cafe and the Ham quiche was a hit with my kids.

Overall a VERY pleasant experience....

the whole magazine section is damn good -vogue.. aaahhhhhh it killed me haha. 
anyway back to the cupcakes. after 8'ish is out of the world. also the toffee coffee cup cakes. scones are also very fresh . so mrs.magpie you are a lovely place to hangout. much much better than rouge.

As a child I think every girl wishes for a life size doll house with pretty stained glass windows and quaint little tables with litte pink chairs and tiny colorful couches. Well, if you were that child this cafe is a dream come true. It is an explosion of pink and cuteness. Yes, they serve cupcakes which are pretty good in taste but a wee bit too tiny for any person above the age of five. The regular cupcakes are a bit better in size and price. The quiche and sandwhiches are worth a try. Overall a nice place but a bit over rated.

The must haves on the menu are the hot chocolate, strawberry milkshake the their fresh fruit tart. The hot chocolate here is like none other. Its not your usual chocolate power mixed with milk. It literally melted chocolate which u try to savour till the last drop. Its the best hot chocolate in town. Try the mini cupcakes, they are like mini drops of heaven, specially the strawbrry crush which has strawberry jam in the middle. YUMM...

Mrs Magpie has undoubtedly been the pioneer in introducing the concept of cupcakes to Kolkata. Places like Toujour and now Mad Over Donuts have had cupcakes for a while but none of those have been in Kolkata. I'm glad that that these people came up with this kind of an idea. Priced at Rs 35, these little cupcakes are not just works of art but also make one of the most tasty and visually appealing presents today.

If you've been to fairy castle in Disney land, you would know what Mrs. Magpie looks like. Even if you are just walking past, the exterior of the shop will make you want to visit. The pink ribbons, hearts, little birdie all of it is so welcoming and warm. On entering, you see the pink- orange decor, japanese cherry blossom wallpapers, stained glass windows, dokra door chimes. What is most appealing is the sight of cupcakes. Bite sized and regular ones, in flavours like chocolate, marshmallow, peanut butter and lemon! The place creates a cosy atmosphere for coffee, cupcakes and a lazy afternoon with your bestie.  I love the coffee - toffee, mutton quiche, coffees, and almost all their tiny muffins!

The concept of afternoon tea for two is lovely and innovative. It includes fruit cakes, finger sandwiches and buns for approx Rs 600 for two. This place is an overdose of pink and that might just make your boyfriend faint. Along with the overall feminine appeal this little cafe celebrates the passion for baking and decor. Here, fairy tales come alive making every women feel like a princess. 

Overall Rating - 4.5
Pocket pinch for two - Rs 400/-

I visit Mrs Magpie about twice a week, sometimes more.

Their prices are very reasonable, but more importantly their cupcakes and pastries are amazingly delicious the decor is gorgeous and the staff is always friendly, helpful and attentive.

There are many quirky flavoured cupcakes and quiches which go great with your very own teapot of tea while dining in the cafe. I can't resist and even order extra to take home.

I have also ordered a personalised birthday cake and cupcakes, my idea was difficult, but the cakes were  out of this world, the end product exceeded my expectations by far! I couldn't thank them enough :)

I will continue to visit Mrs Magpie again and again, I also recommend it to all my friends and they love it too!

My mood was lifted instantly. We ordered for different flavor of cupcakes, sandwiches and milk chocolate. The cupcakes were too small in size but tasted like stars ! Yummylicious food and the most amazing way of presentation ever. The cherry on the cake is the service. They make you feel as if its your own restaurant even if you just order one cupcake. Must visit ! :)

Mrs. Magpie is an excellent place to visit for those who want to control the amount of food they eat. The bite-sized desserts served here are very good, and customers are able to enjoy them without worrying about over-eating. Mrs.Magpie also serves a range of full-sized cupcakes and savoury items, most of which are quite good.

The layout and ambience of the place is very good. The walls have interesting designs on them and the tables and chairs are well designed. The lights seemed to be a little too bright, though. The cakes on display throughout the shop add to the character of the place. Small things, like the bottles and glasses used to serve water, help in ensuring that the customer appreciates the service. I am particularly glad that this shop does not imitate a number of restaurants in Calcutta (a number, sadly, that is growing) where drinking water has to be bought.

The bite-sized cupcakes, savoury tarts and quiches are what makes the restaurant stand out. Varieties like the Sweet and Salty Cupcake or the Apple Brandy Cupcake are particularly good. The small scones on offer, which are accompanied by applesauce, butter and cream, make for a very filling snack. The tea and coffee served here is also of good quality - I recommend the Americano in particular. The service is good and the waiters polite. Billing is also quick, even when the place is crowded.

There are also a number of cakes on offer that look mouth-watering, but are very expensive (by Calcutta standards). A reduction in prices might allow more people to buy them.

Overall, a very good place to spend an evening with friends, and one that one would want to visit regularly.

If you are a foodie then this fairy tale joint is a must visit. Ambience is beautiful in line with the name! Service is courteous and the food is simply awesome. The cup cakes (there are a lot of varieties to choose from) are simply lip smacking. We tried After 8s and Peanut butter ones. The Ratatouille tarts and Ham &  Cheese quiches are must tries. Prices are absolutely reasonable given the quality of food and the ambience. Please put this in your list at once!

Love this for its classy feel,starting from the decor on the muffins to the salt pot on the table or their way of providig the cheque.Nice food though I found the prices a bit steep for the quantities.The snacks are priced between 30-90 or sandwiches r around 90-120.There was a nice tea for 550 for 2 with a delwctable spread though I couldnt try it since we werent that hungry.But overall pretty dainty and food is of a good quality.Their ham and cheese quiche was had a strong flavor of mace the last time but today it wasnt there so it tasted better.Had called for a strawberry milkshake but they said they could serve only chocolate or vanilla so I asked for chocolate.Was a bit too sweet for me but tasted nice.
For the overall experience I think it's a good change.

It comes straight out of the story books. I wouldn't be surprised if I suddenly see an Enid Blyton character walking in sitting down and ordering for a pot of tea and cute cupcakes with marshmellows or tarts or pudding. I was mesmerized by the decor, so mesmerized that the decor itself added volumes of taste to the slightly overpriced sandwiches. They have paid close attention to minute details. You have to see it to believe it. But the cupcakes and little bread loaves( mini bread loaf shaped muffins) were soft and melt in your mouth. The chicken tarts and quiche were awesome as well. I also had my first tyrst with scones in Calcutta and needless to say, I wasn't at all disappointed! However the place was a little difficult to find and when I paid the bill, I did feel a slight pinch in my pocket. But it was definitely worth the experience. Mrs. Magpie is the nice little tea shop you go to for a chit-chat with you friend, the atmosphere is nice, you don't just walk in for a quick bite. Despite being a new place it has an old world charm that will charm you no end.

Best Cake shop in the city by far. The cupcakes are reasonably priced, and so are the tons of other stuff available. The Hot Chocolate is the best you'll ever have, and the Milkshakes aren't too far off either. And the custom cakes are made to perfection, and they'll make you practically anything you want. And the attention to detail is meticulous, both in their food and in the shop itself. The shop transports you to one of those Enid Blyton-esque shops which we all have in our fantasies. Go, you will not regret it :D

Its very rare when you do a sin and love it.This is the only way to describe  this wonderful place.Me a dialysis patient and my friend Monolina a diabetic both foodies tasted almost everything they had today and it was pure bliss.The presentation,ambiance, tableware,crockery ,service even the crowd.......all a one.And food. We had  the ham n cheese quiche,all the different cupcakes,scones,smoked salmon sandwich ,tea, shake n coffee.And I think I'm missing some more items.Everything was awesome.Even the complimentary gingerbread was great.The best bakery in town.Cookie Jar and La Patisserie watch out. All in all a total five for them.Believe me they really deserve this rating.Just a question.Why there were no men except me???

The slate board menu for scones, the beautiful glass bottles, the napkin holders to the beautiful handmade bill holders... everything at Magpie's is queer and awesome!

I've eaten at so many restaurants that nowadays i squirm at the thought of chilli chicken-chowmein / biriyani-tandoor places! And so I loved the fact that when i was served a set of four delicious smelling buns with cheese, butter and  a speckled raspberry sauce (probably) on the side, I had to look up on Google as to how to eat a scone !! The effort was worth it! The scones were lovely! So was the Pesto Chicken with Ciabatta bread. The flavour of the sandwich is very delicate, but its a bit too buttery for my taste. The cupcakes are the star here...especially the sweet-n-salty ones. Haven't tasted anything like them before! 

I hope to go back soon enough to try out the rest of the menu...and to stare some more at the beautiful cakes in the glass chamber at the center! A unique place indeed!

Few places in Calcutta where one feels one has entered Cinderella's house.....its a complete fairy tale experience. i had walked in on a nice cold chilly wintery evening and the sheer warmth of this place adds colour one's life. their chicken sandwiches are finger licking good, scones fresh and irresistable and cupcakes and cookies nice. The only tinge on improvement is their service and a bit of smile on the waiters faces. Else its amust try out place for people of all age groups.

This place is straight out of a little girls picture book. Such a cute pink place. Everything is tastefully done and with a good eye indeed..Small things that've been displayed are just so pretty...Coming to the muffins, I had an assortment of 4 and they were all lovely, mainly not drop dead sweet which is great coz everything in kolkata has an extra doze of sugar..this place had its sugar checked!! The seating is may b a lil un comfy as the backrest is wrought iron and no cushion and the magazines are outdated!! I was alone and enjoyed my tea and cupcakes to the core. Mr. Rajesh on the counter was warm and hospitable...I am coming back sooooon...Loved this picture perfect place :D

crossed grub club in golpark n take the first lane toward lake n walk straight for abt 5-7minutes n u vl get this cute little place n with the tinkering of the little bell me n my partner entered this disneyland type decorated cafe called Mrs Magpie................. 

We ordered the afternoon tea for two...
1) Darjeeling tee came in a transparent tea pot n its greattt n it was accompanied bt little milk jug n sugar cube n yes u have the option of sugarfree toooooo

2) The cup cakes were verry good but too small.. 1inch bigger size wud have looked decent

3) The scones were fresh n buttery bt somehow it didnt went well with my tastebud

4)The chicken sandwiches were not upto the mark as the filling was bland.. I agree there are people who dont like much spicy food but they were bland for my tastebud...

5) Staff was friendly

6) The washroom is again a pluspoint n the door is amazingly cute

So its basically a refreshing touch for me in Kolkata n looking forward to it..

PS: My recomendation is that have the tea and the cupcakes as its the highlight of this cafe

Must visit for great tea and cupcakes. The scones are also good. Afternoon Tea combo is a great addition to the menu. Price is fair. The ambiance is pretty good as well as the decor. They have successfully carried out the 'pink' theme. This place is a great initiative and one of a kind in Kolkata. The cupcakes are brilliant ! Very delicately decorated and a great confluence of flavors. There are a variety of them to chose from. The gingerbread needs a special mention and it is recommended to have them with your fine Darjeeling Tea. Overall its a nice place to hangout. 
They deserve a 4.5 out of 5  !

Love the concept. The Salmon sandwich is super, order it only if you like your salmon smoked. The pastries are interesting. The coffee is ordinary. As a place, I would prefer it any day to any of the CCDs. The prices are a bit over-the-top.

Now hardly you come across a joint where the old and the young can chill with the same vigor, as you entire this lovely place, the first thing that hits you is its chic and classy decor. From the colors of the wall,to the wallpaper,the lighting...all in all its totally so English. The ambiance has been kept classy with its music and warm lighting. Coming to the food, a food is as good as the way its served and they do it style be it the crockery or the bill tucked in a lovely gift box. 

The service is excellent and most importantly the hospitality towards the customer is excellent. 

In matter of food, the quality rocks to the hilt, a variety of excellent delicacies to choose from which quench the taste-buds and pricing is extremely affordable especially for the youth brigade. 

BIGTIME THUMBS UP...

Ambience: Very pink, very floral and very fresh! kind of reminds me of another cupcake paradise The Rouge. I love the attention that Mrs.Magpie (!) paid to every little detail in this cute cafe to keep the ambience cheerful and gay (happy! :P)
Service: A cafe is generally a laid back place, so service doesn't really matter unless they serve you the wrong stuff or takes far too long in doing so. But I found the Mrs.Magpie staff generally efficient and cordial.
Food: A bit fancy and expensive, yes. But I must say the cupcakes are top-notch! And that is what you expect from a Le Cordon Bleu trained pastry chef! Mrs.Magpie also bakes the most delicious looking cakes for private parties (check their Facebook page!).
Recommendation: Try everything if you don't mind the crater in your pocket that it'll leave behind! :D

The first thing u notice about this place is a decor, its awesome 2 begin with.
From a bell at the entrance to d walls and the chairs. Everything is very cute and very well done, it gives a totally international feel to it. I couldn't have imagined such a place somewhere in Kolkata a few years back.
The food is nice, cupcakes are there specialities and I love them. Very tasty.
I have been to this place twice, they had a Double Strawberry Cupcake which I found really amazing but for some reason they have discontinued it :(. Nutty Praline was the best of the present lot. Finger sandwiches and scones are also very nice. Very tasty.
The presentation should get 10/10
A nice place to hang out. Location is a bit difficult 2 find initially. Will surely visit again.

The Decor of the Place is really classy and very eye catching. The staff is very good and polite. I ordered a Caffe Latte which was exactly on the warm side so I had to order another one. Second there were strands of hair in the sandwich i ordered and in the cupcakes. Though the same was pointed out to the waiter and he was sorry about it and changed the cupcake. Overall the experience was good

One of the cutest hangout spots in town for sure!! Everything about this place reminds one of an adorable Play house.The service is quick and the quality of food is excellent.Visited this place with a friend and tried out the "Afternoon Tea for Two" personalized combo.Experimented with different cupcakes-Marshmallow,After 8'ish,Apple n Brandy,Strawberry n cream..followed by scones, finger sandwiches and darjeeling tea. It was filling and we left the place with happy tummies.Definitely worth a try.

Mrs. Magpie's is all the rage on the Facebook Kolkata circle right now. With instagrams of cute little cupcakes and quaint table settings appearing on everyone's news feed. I was in the city recently and met a friend for evening tea at this place. A delightful surprise nestled away in the residential alleys of Southern Avenue, this is the sort of place that the city needs.

The decor is bright and colourful. A mishmash of chintz and English aspirations and summer hues. While evenings are probably peak timings, I assume the place sees decent crowds on most days. People were waiting for place or opting for takeaways wile we were there. The service consequently is sort of strained. We wanted milk with our tea and had to remind three different servers multiple number of times before we could get it.

Mrs Magpie's cupcakes are definitely the USP here. The mini ones are adorable, to say the least. They don't taste exceptional, but they are on the better side of good. Especially the strawberry & cream ones, and the ones with the ladybird on the marshmallow. They should perhaps introduce some more flavours along the lines of red velvet and coffee. Cupcakes come in platter as well, so there are good combos on offer.

A word about the savoury. I liked the Finger Sandwiches. We ordered the salmon ones and they were quite tasty. Tea is the usual kind, I wanted the Assam Tea, which they unfortunately didn't have, so had to go with the Darjeeling.  The cakes looked promising as well. I'd surely order one for any close friend's birthday.

Definitely a value for money place. Totally recommended.

I have grown up reading about all those beautiful little coffee time experiences in Enid Blyton's books. Where you get those scones, cupcakes, quiche and sandwiches, and Mrs. Magpie took me back to those days. The decor is beautiful, it is like a small exhibition hall, where you can go the little nooks and cranies and check out their beautiful wall designs, cupcakes and cakes. I had heard a lot about the place and had finally visited it on my birthday, in the first week of January and since then have visited the shop almost ten times in the past one month with friends and families. The moment one steps and the smile that appears on their face, makes the effort completely worth it. The cupcakes are to die for and so are the other food items. However, the ice tea was a disappointment especially in comparison to the Strawberry and Chocolate shake. The marzipan cupcakes look adorable and trust me you will not think twice before gobbling it up the beautiful figures on the top. The sandwich portions may be a little small as compared to other tea joints, but they are delicious.

The price isn't very high, so it is a favourite of students as well.

Thanks Mrs. Magpie for presenting us Calcuttans with such a great place to sit down and have a blast. :)

This quaint little place off southern avenue was on my wishlist since a long time. But it disappointed me in a big way. The 'famed' cupcakes are just ordinary. And overpriced, they are. The tiny 'mini' cupcakes cost Rs. 35/- each. They are so small that you won't even be able to get the taste properly before you finish them in a mouthful. Same with the scones. I wish they'd either reduce the prices or make them bigger.

The place is well-decorated. It reminds me of cozy little parlours in Enid Blyton stories where you can catch up with friends. But they tend to get crowded in the evenings and people queue up outside. I would also suggest that they train the staffs better as they couldn't answer simple queries like what ingredients are used.

I still applaud the owner for bringing the trend of cupcakes and scones to Kolkata appetite. This bakery has immense potential.

Mrs. Magpie though located slightly in the interior of Vivekananda Park comes across as a super cute place resembling a Doll House. The place is done up tastefully in pink colour and the decor starting from the wallpaper to the bench outside is perfectly placed. I visited the place on January 11 2013 and was very impressed. The finger food was good and the presentation of each item was awesome. They have a wide range of cupcakes in various flavours but the Nolen Gur cupcake needs to improve a lot. Overall a good experience and I am surely visiting the place again :)

Today was my first visit to Mrs. Magpie, and the place delighted me so much that I have finally decided to write my first review on Zomato. I had heard quite a lot about this place, but couldn't find the time to visit earlier. The shop was quite crowded, and not without reason. The interiors were nothing short of  a doll's house-quaint tables and chairs and cabinets displaying the most beautiful cakes. That, along with the menu replete with cupcakes and scones made me feel like I had been transported to the world of Enid Blyton's fairy tales. I had five cupcakes-two Sweet n' Salty, and one each of the Marshmallow, After 8'ish, and Hazelnutty Praline. And believe me when I say that I cannot choose among them as to which one was the best-they were all delicious. The mini animals on top of the cupcakes were a treat to the eyes as well as to the taste buds. We finished it with a chocolate milkshake which was quite delicious as well. The staff was nice and friendly, the decor was beautiful, and the experience was magical. Will surely visit it again,and next time will try out the scones. A full 5 from me. For whoever bothers to read this review,please visit this lovely gem of a place. You wont regret it.

Mrs. Magpie is a really nice place if you are looking for a place to hang out! Very nicely decorated and furnished it gives a pleasant ambiance to its visitors! They have mini cupcakes and regular cupcakes with marzipan! The mini cupcakes are especially good! you can try all but my personal favorite is the Lemon Surprise mini cupcake! Tea comes in very pretty teapot! Their sandwiches are good too! The chocolate shake is average, but mini Strawberry shake is yum. Their takeaway boxes are awesomely cute!
 Plus you can hangout for hours and they won't budge you off! :) A little difficult to locate but once you are there you are in for a TREAT! :)

This place deserves every bit of praise! If on is willing to look over the fact that the decor is much like the insides of the delectable cupcakes that this place serves, the place is a must visit (Some might take a liking to the decor as well, if they like the colour pink). 

Though getting to the place proved be a bit tricky, the food and the free wi-fi made up for it. A perfect place to catch up on all that relaxed reading time that you didn't quite get down to during   the week, over a cup of gooey Hot Chocolate, and After-8 mini Cupcakes. The savory stuff is worth a try as well. 

It is a risky visit, if you prefer avoiding people (oh them wretched aunties!) in your parents' social circles (who appeared to be the primary clientele of this place, rendering the place to be a bit noisy at times). 

But then the quality of the desserts, is the trump card, and is a "must-not-miss" for people waiting on satisfying their sweet-tooth.

Visited this lovely place just recently. I was surprised by its ambience. Ambience is very cute and you get tea,desserts and bakery here. My favourite was the sweet and salty cupcake,toffee coffee and chicken sandwich. Food presentation was great and service is quick. Once i had also ordered a cake which was very beautifully decorated. Staffs are amiable and the green tea was a good try. I would suggest you all tot taste their Strawberries and cream which was yummy and i was especially captivated by its interior decor. Must visit. I would rate 4.0 for 'MRS MAGPIE'

The decor is the best in any such outlet in Calcutta - I visited this place on X-mas day with my daughter and we both just fell in love with this place!! Its so warm and fairytale like.. the mini cup cakes and the marzipan are not just fabulous to look at but super yummy!! The sticky gingerbread is unbelievably good - have not had a better gingerbread in Calcutta so far! You got to visit this place to believe.. I loved the small little arrows showing its direction - it took us a while to find the place though, till my 8 year old daughter noticed the arrows on some trees.. the staff is friendly too .. the only let down was that the place was full and we had to satisfy ourselves with a take-away.. looking forward to a visit again soon when we can savour the delicacies.. Thank you for the lovely experience!

Hello to the world that transports you to that phase where pretty cupcakes were made for magic, candy colours bedazzled, and you dreamt of having tea with pixies and fairies right out of an Enid Blyton or Mary Poppinish situation.

The British tiered version of tea -replete with cupcakes, scones, shortbread/gingerbread, paper-thin sandwiches, is redefining how we have tea now, in our matter-of fact-ly ways in the very stereotypical cafe.

Yes, Mrs.Magpie is refreshing and how! even the door leading to the bathroom is so pretty that you will end up ordering a mini-cup cake too many.

However, the novel concept of Mrs.Magpie will have to be bolstered with a better quality of food and a larger range of options, I was quite upset with the quiche as it was way too salty as well as with the hot chocolate! 

Though some may really like the hot chocolate as its quite literally 'HOT' melted 'CHOCOLATE' served to you in an albeit really cute cup ....its not my cup of tea, i would much rather prefer a flavor dark/smooth etc to my hot chocolate.

I like the cup cakes though.

Will try the Nolengurer cupcake next time 

It's also a great place for a photo shoot with the girls, bring out the retro frocks, hairbands, pretty things and Click away-- the waiters are so used to it, that they clear chairs for you to pose and sometimes add cute ducks and trees to your frame! 


PS: Couldn't help spotting a few blatant resemblances with Cafe Rouge on AJC, Bose Road.

To begin with, this place came to us like a surprise... I am not sure how i shud describe my experience here... 

Lets begin with the Plus-es first
- Bang On Decor: tastefully done up.. reminds me of an old English movie.... or maybe a doll house tea party.. brilliant decor, very tastefully done 
-wonderful staff, very warm and very welcoming 
-food presentation, 10/10 
-we ordered green tea, and i must say, the best green tea i hav ever had, super fragrant
-one of the best scones i have eaten in the country, only better ones i hav had are abroad

the shortcomings, 
-difficult to find
-cup cakes were too crumbly ( but not bad to taste.. just crumbly) 
- didn't like the sandwiches ( we had a chicken and a salmon) too much bread.. too little filling. (again this is just a suggestion.. i like my sandwiches loaded.. ) 


i shud be seen here again soon.... for the scones ... and the tea...





I think this was my 7th or 8th visit and I must say that the Cup cakes were much better today and the have added a variety in their sandwiches as well .... 

The iced to was spot on too .... We loved the german tea cake and the scones were brilliant as always .... 

thus I am increasing my rating to 4.5  

a few suggestions: 

There should be a some more ice cream based desserts and maybe a mousse or a souffle ... 
a few flavors in the iced tea would be appreciated as well ...

i have been wanting to visit the place with my sister for a very long time, a sunday evening with mom gone out of station makes us splurge a little :) so we both got ready to satisfy our sweet tooth , and though it was evening ordered the afternoon tea for two- a very economic choice when you see the delicacies being offered , we went for peanut butter and banana, sweet and salty, cotton candy and marshmallow and raspberry surprise out of the seven mini cupcakes up for selection..my favourite would be cotton candy, which maybe a bit too sweet for some people , while i found it absolutely amazing and my sister loved the marshmallow and raspberry surprise. the detail given to decorations is unbelievable. those sweet treats along with four yummy butter scones and 8 finger sandwiches followed by almost two cups of tea per person...was way more than filling in itself, but the beautiful large cupcakes with marzipan cream were tempting enough to buy, so we packed some off for later anyhoo :) now about the decor, as soon as you see the doll house in the display you get that warm and gooey feeling, on entering the walls are colored pink and the place resembles a small fantasy land.. i love the decor and the fact that it is situated at a place which is relatively empty ... the concept is very fresh and it is yet not over commercialised so i can safely say that it is my favourite

It was a lazy afternoon, I was missing the 'cream-tea' yes that is what we get in Britain which is traditional but enjoyable.  I stepped in to this place unknowingly... to my delight the colonial past of Kolkata comes alive which I thought was gone with the steady advent of 'Bhel culture' ...

My wishes to the owner for trying something different and have to say your selection of offerings were fascinating.

It reminds me of a famous cafe in East Yorkshire called ' The Potting Shade Cafe in Hull '

cheers !

What a place!!! Just as you step inside Mrs. Magpie, you just see, stare and start loving the place. Pink on walls, Cherry blossom wallpaper, Chairs, Lights you will start loving everything. And wait till the time you realise that you are in a doll house the yummy Mini Cupcakes will draw your attention. Mind it they will not only draw your attention but being so delicious and yummy that you would love to taste each of them. They come in six flavours Lemon Surprise, Sweet "n" Salty Chocolate, Peanut Butter "n" Banana, Double Stawbewrry, Candilicious and Marshmallow "n" chocolate and are priced at Rs. 35 each. 
If you are a Chocolate lover then you must try Sweet "n" Salty Chocolate. 
Coffee and Tea lovers would love this place. Starting from Green tea, Darjeeling tea, Cappuccino, Espresso, Americano and Cafe latte the place has every regular hot coffee and tea present, but nothing in cold beverages.

Very quaint, cute, and quirky .. one of its kind in whole of Kolkata... The Stained glass door, the doll house style display the fairy lights the Pink on the walls and the white iron furniture , a chest here and lounge there all of it makes you feel like you have walked into a Patisserie in Paris..
Cup cakes are yumm the designs and the detailing makes you feel as if you rather preserve them than have them...
The sweet and salt chocolate is a surprise and a steal...Bring a book and sit and spend hours with a cup of tea... though a more extensive range of tea is desired.. hopefully the owners will take a note...
Savories are just of the right size and taste my favourite- the Broccoli and mushroom pepper tart and the chicken ratatouille tart .. slowly looking forward to more varieties specially with sandwiches etc....
Situated off the main street of Vivekananda Park in a quiet leafy lane of the slowly growing Cafe Neighborhood of Kolkata, this cafe/patisserie is going to be the new hangout for me and my friends for sure...
Hope few outdoor seating arrangements are made to add to the Smokers delight or just for the sake of enjoying the Nip in the air of the limited winter months in Kol ..
P.S.- The Cake making skills of the Lady owner ( Sohini B) seems quite up there waiting to be explored... so I am yet to dig into the Bigger Cakes and order some for the upcoming festive season... till then I am sure Kolkatans will take up this new place with open arms.
