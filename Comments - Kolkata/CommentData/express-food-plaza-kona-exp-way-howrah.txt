Superb place!!
Food is delicious.
Service is prompt.
Super courteous staffs.
Best part is that it’s the most hygienic place you’ll get beside highway. Unlike other dhabas.
Also pocket pinch is really reasonable.

When on road trips to Digha, mandarmoni and the like or just a food and drive outing on weekends the only option that came in mind was Shere Punjab at Kolaghat. However the service there has come down steeply and the waiting is a big turn off. So thought of trying this place. Excellent ambience, superb food and proper hygiene things missing else where. A must visit again and again and definately my substitute for Shere Punjab hence forth......!!!!!!!!

Went here after a long drive for dinner. The place is well decorated and the food is also good but can be better. We had limesoda, mocktails, murgh malai tikka, chicken Kali mirch tikka(was very bad), butter and garlic naan and masala kulcha, icecream and rasmalai. The drawback I find of this place is the washrooms, they are very dirty. A place located on highway should atleast have a clean washroom since many travellers returning/going might need it.

Express Food Plaza is the most well decorated place near Kolaghat. One of the best places for your lay by during your drive. 

Have your food, take some rest and resume your journey again. 

The staff and their behaviour has to change. It has to be good. It’s very poor.

Situated next to the famous Sher-e-Punjab this joint is also a very good option. They have ample parking space, nice multi cuisine restaurant, clean washrooms(which is much needed when you are traveling for a long distance) and a small park for kids to play. The interior decor is nice. Food is reasonably priced and service is very prompt. The butter naan was really good, so was the dal makhani and the chicken sweet corn soup. They also have plenty of dessert and mocktail option. Nice restaurant for both family and friend.

This place is a good option to have some good food while you're out on a long drive. I visited this place with my friends on Panchami night. It was more or less empty at that time. The interiors look good and is quite spacious. 

We could only order from the North Indian section as Chinese and South Indian were not available. The cold Coffee tasted amazing, with a beautiful balance of flavours. The chole bhatura had two large bhaturas with a bowl of spicy chickpea curry. It tasted good as well. The Aloo Paratha was good enough in size with a thick filling of mashed potato, which was very spicy. The curd that was served with it seemed stale, which we had to discard. 

Overall, it was a satisfying experience and would love to come here again.

Located just beside the highway....this place looks simply outstanding with it's commendable view and sprawling lawns....awesome for taking pictures.Well sadly the truth is...one expects good food from beautiful restaurants even more!And this place simply doesn't do justice to their food.We ordered chicken afghani,mixed hakka noodles,mixed fried rice,crispy fish in garlic sauce,kung pao chicken,sweet lime soda and fresh lime soda,soft drinks and packaged water.The bill was Rs.2100. Totally not worth it. We even complained the rice smelled and tasted stale.The prawns too didn't taste right.The service was very slow.I would surely avoid this place the next time.
