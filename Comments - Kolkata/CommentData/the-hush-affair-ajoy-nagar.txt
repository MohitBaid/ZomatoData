This place is the newest addition to the modest number of eateries near Ajaynagar. Albeit the location is a bit odd but I am sure once this place becomes popular that would not be an issue.

I was invited over for the inauguration of this place along with my fellow foodies of Panchphoron for a food tasting session. So here's what this cafe is serving-

Mocktails
‚Ä¢Blue lagoon
‚Ä¢Chocolate shake

Food
‚Ä¢Chicken Tikka kebab
‚Ä¢ Chicken malai kebab
‚Ä¢Paneer kebab
‚Ä¢Chicken Biryani
‚Ä¢Pasta in white sauce
‚Ä¢Pizza
‚Ä¢Fried rice

Food was okayish in terms of both taste and quality. I personally felt that a lot more can be done to the Biryani if wishes to compete with the already eshtablished big brands in the area.However the main USP of this place is that inspite being a cafe it serves a lot many dishes unlike other cafes. They also do have special offers on Pasta and Pizzas for the upcoming New year and Christmas celebrations. A nice place to hang out or spend some quality time with family in a not-so-party mood to ring in the new year. The best thing about this place is it claims is that they serve mutton Haleem throughout the year. Now that's really something to look forward to.

Thanks to the team of Hush Affair for hosting us and special thanks to
