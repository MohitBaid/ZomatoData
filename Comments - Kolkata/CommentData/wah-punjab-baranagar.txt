Quite decent place. At a reasonable price they serve dishes with average sort of taste. Some of the veg items I tasted here were quite nice.

(Home Delivery) Bad food quality, Worse Packaging (Pulao rice was spilled all over in carry bag), DAL makhni was sour in taste, Tandori Roti was burnet (chef was concentrating more on indvsaus match it seems) Considering Food quality not at all pocket friendly. Pics say lot about a kind of nightmare I had with food (do check). Puja/Weekend ended on a very bad note. Possibly the first & last order from Wah Punjab! NOT RECOMMENDED!!

The amount of masala and gravy used in each of their dishes is extremely high, and it disintegrates the essence of that particular dish. Pav bhaaji is bland and extremely sour. Need  to work a lot on their dishes. EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM.

First I want to say that Zomato has given wrong information here, they do have seating facility both Air conditioned and Non-air conditioned. This is a very simple dhaba style veg restaurant of Dunlop. Food is okayish. Their Chole Batura and Pav Bhaji is worth mentioning. All other items are good for casual meal.

We opted for homedelivery n ordered,paneer tikka butter masla,aloo paratha,n paneer pulao...
Good food,good packaging..
Though in the paneer pulao , paneer is to hardly find..but it was a light preparation indeed.
And in the paneer tikka butter masala , there were only two pieces of paneer..and again it was a perfect blend of spices.
Aloo paratha was pretty good. Not an extra drop of oil was there.
Overall a decent choice for vegetarians.

'Chhole bhature' is a good choice from menu of them..
N Chinese section (though veg) , is like homemade Chinese,not too oily,not too spicy..

When it was newly opened it was d best resturant in that area, but now its d worst. In recent days its d worst place for food lovers. Every item is ordinary or below average. I ordered mix vegetable nd believe me it was d worst mix vegetable i ever had in any restro.

I've been and ordered from this place quite a number of times. My overall experience is fine. The north indian menu is tastes better than other cuisines. Last time, I ordered crispy chilli baby corn which I found to be very salty. The North Indian food is really really good and cheap.

Out and out north indian veg restaurant and the only one in dunlop area. Chinese items they tried are among the blunders, but the north indian items are pretty good. Dal Makhni, Paneer butter masala, Paneer Kofta, Jalebis are among my favorites from here. But they should also keep an option of pure jain cuisine (without onion and garlic).

This is the only good Vegetarian restaurant you will find in this area. It has more of a dhaba feel than a restaurant. It is quite pocket friendly. The upper floor is a bit too cozy. My friends and I ordered a plate of Kadhai Paneer, Dal Tadka and assorted breads. They serve generous quantities of food and the service is quite fast. The food was delicious. The paneer was soft and the masala were blended well. However, the Garlic naan was a little too salty. As a student, I guess I will keep coming whenever the food at the hostel mess gets a little too unbearable.

Like any other highway or trunk road, always there are a good number of eating places lined up on either side of the road, and on a similar note, the ever bustling BT Road is not an exception. So if you are at Dunlop, and looking for a nice and descent place for a quick but comfortable lunch, a walk in at "Wah Punjab" will not disappoint you. 
The AC section upstairs is obviously preferable during a scorchy afternoon time, and the difference of prices in the menu card for the AC & Non AC segments, is very marginal.

Food is nice, fresh and tasty, and do not make you feel heavy or too full even after a full course meal. Service too is good and pocket pinch is absolutely reasonable.

A neat, nice and descent place to walk in for a quick lunch, or to grab a bite on the go.

Great place to have pure veg food. This place is near donlup bridge and very small outlet. You can not see from outside there is also a proper sitting arrangement and ac restaurant. 
I have been there 3-4 times but first time going to review. 
On my last visit, we ordered Tandoori paneer tikka, garlic naan, paneer kulcha, mushroom butter masala and lassi. Food was yum and very tasty and also served hot. 
In my earlier visit I had tried paneer butter masala, kadhai paneer, naan, roti, tadka and other items can not recollect the name. 
I think North Indian items are great here, price is reasonable and pocket friendly. Ambiance is okay. 
Overall I like this place and will go again recommended for foodies.

The other main course dishes like Naan,Kulcha,Butter Paneer and Koftas are delicious. The takeaway quantities are also satisfying. A cozy place !

I visit this restaurant quite often and this is the only place in the baranagar region where u can get choice of good parathas- aloo paratha ,gobhi paratha,muli paratha etc.
Masala kulcha ,varieties of dal, chhole bhature are also quite good and we cn get them in reasonable price.
Jalebi there is too good.
But the quality of food is deteriorating day by day. Hope they maintain the quality as it was in beginning.
