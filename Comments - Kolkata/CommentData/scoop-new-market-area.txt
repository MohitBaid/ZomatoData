Very good decor and equally bland food ,slow service.
I ordered a chicken pasta in cheesy creamy sauce.it came with 2 PC's of garlic bread.the 240 rs spent on pasta was not worth it.maybe one should have only ice creams and shakes here.will try those if I visit again.

This place has delivered perfectly every single time I have been here. The desserts are impeccable. ‚ù§‚ù§ They are delivered exactly the same they advertise. They give a chocolate spoon with black coffee. ‚ù§‚ù§ They gave a cookie with my caramel popcorn shake and it was so buttery ‚ù§‚ù§ I must say that the chefs are very much talented. The staff is very comfortable to talk to. There are aesthetic elements. Would visit again and definitely would suggest others to go ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

Staffs are rude, they don't know table manners.

I am seriusly in love with the restroüòá . Not just for food bt also the added wowness of the shop.
Walking and aching our legs through shop lined lanes of the new market area , we suddenly bumped into this restro .
It was all about a hungry soul who need to satiate.üòÇ
Firstly I must appriciate the staffs ,service and the decor ... its a 10 on 10‚ù§.
Staffs were very cordial and patient and the deco was so much cute and chicüòç.
Comming to food , the restro gives a myriad variety of eateries . Though we tried out less itms , i liked it .
We ordered mango chicken and noodles it was 4/5 on taste , tomato basil pasta with pesto sauce was also too good 4.5/5 , only black forest milk shake disappointed a bit , it was a bit flat in taste also the cake and cream given was not fresh but compared to the less cost of the itm as compared to other restro its ok .
Looking forward to go there again üòä.

This is my fav place for sizzlers. Non veg sizzler(Fish) is the one I love. Other dishes are also very good. One thing I liked here is they serve bowl combos which are sufficient for one. Only thing that disappointed is that they dont have waiting area and staff is bit slow. Otherwise it was a nice experience.

A really spacious seating with decent music and helpful staffs...heard a lot about it so finally dropped in for some food here:
Took a chkn salad with mayo dressing that turned out so superb..and a combo of biriyani and chilli chicken which was no less... succulent 4pieces of chilli chkn with the gravy and the biriyani rice with half an egg and potato for 210 was too good!
Pricing is pretty reasonable and quantity and quality are heart filling totally üíØ.

We were at New Market to shop and before hitting home decided to have dinner and after scouting the place ended at this place. After consulting our server we ordered chicken tikka and aunty lucy's fish fry. The serving time was very long despite the place not being full. We had to remind them a few times. The food though was very awesome. We needed some chutney and even for that we had to call them several times. They need to improve on this aspect. I have already asked my friends to visit this place. The bill was Rs 530 including mineral water.

Went there after a bout of christmas shopping. The place was crowded. The ambiance was sort of cute with pink lights, pink menu etc. Its situated in the New Empire building. I ordered grilled fish and cheesy white pasta. The fish was a disappointment... it was so small and did not feel grilled. The veggies ( cauliflower and broccoli) too undercooked. It came with 2 mickey mouse shaped breads. The pasta was tasty and was accompanied by garlic bread. The dessert was yummy.

"Chicken sizzler"
This is a regular chicken sizzler which you can enjoy after shopping in new market .Scope has the best location in new market  . Taste is very good .Chicken is soft and tender with crunchy and variety of fresh veggies .I loved that beautiful spicy rice with the gravy which became more delicious by mixing the juicy yolk of the fried egg.
Yah i am like this :)

This is not at all a place to have some good foods! Had been there with one of my friends and we were not happy with the foods they served. We ordered Grilled Chicken which was worst in taste and served cold. The chicken was not even grilled. We also ordered Chilly Garlic Basil Prawn Thai Style which was not so good as well.¬†

Most importantly, the service was poor too. The staff there were not paying attention to the guests. We had to wait for more than 15 minutes to pay the bill. I will not recommended anyone to visit this outlet.

In an area like New Market, where there are so many restaurants for dining in, Scoop is one of the best restaurants for mouth-watering Ice-creams.  A legendary outlet recognized for their Ice-creams. Have tried their sizzlers too, but the dish is very bland and prepared differently. A very lively and brightly lit place with good seating arrangements. Would love to recommend their 'As you like it' ice-cream. One can select up to 3-5 scoops of their favourite ice-creams, with a choice of fresh fruits, dry fruits and flavoured sauces. Absolutely amazing ice creams are found here, especially when one can customize their own ice-cream. A must visit for ice-cream lovers.

Scoop is a really underrated restaurant located in the heart of Esplanade in the New Empire building. Scoop is generally famous for their signature ice-cream sundays. But they also serve some pretty good food. They have a wide array of menu starting from continental to chinese to north Indian to South Indian. So you get a wide variety of choices. Try it out its really nice and inexpensive as well.

I've been to this place quite some time back. My friends and I got tired of shopping in New Market area and decided to drop in here. It is located at the New Empire building, right beside KFC, Domino's and Wow Momo. 

The ambience is nice. They have a good bunch of staffs who suggest you their special dishes and ice cream options. We ordered Cheese Masala Dosa and Chicken Kima Dosa. It was the first time that I had chicken dosa and I must admit that it was an excellent experience. The dosa was soooo very tasty. We also ordered Pehla Nasha from their dessert range. It had one scoop of vanilla ice-cream, one scoop of chocolate ice-cream along with a black forest pastry decorated with chocolate chips, coconut and a cherry. It was simply amazing in taste. Do try this one when you visit them.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: Rs. 500 for two

"0" for their service as no one bothers to care and ask you if we need anything throughout your stay, not even water unless you call them 2 or 3 times. Good food but over priced as the quantity served is not so sufficient. One of our orders had murg tikka makhni which was served with just 4 small size chicken pcs with gravy.

It's been quite some time since I visited this place(sorry to say, the pic isn't from the last time we went there). This is a nice place to opt for when you decide to splurge for some occasion but since I didn't taste their actual food, I can't really vouch for it. Over a span of several dates and birthdays, I've dropped in this place. The ambiance isn't too quaint but serene enough to enjoy a romantic date and also chic enough to crowd in the seats and spend the time with a group of people.

I've had their Cold Cafe Frappe, As You Like It, Pehla Nasha, some other cold coffee variants and 'scoop' offerings! Nothing is above average but the place is ideal over a scoop or two to scrape every other minute while you catch up with friends.

If you're famished, you can find better places in the vicinity but if it's to spend time with someone and you're near this place, don't give a second thought.

Located in the New Market area, this place is famous for their ice creams and deserts and for the right reasons.
While my visit there with my friend I ordered the Dark Temptation. A mix of chocolate and vanilla ice cream with brownie on the top can never taste bad. And the additional wafers are always appreciated. The brownie just melts into your mouth giving a hint of dark chocolate right before you dive in for the ice creams. I really enjoyed it and would definitely order this again sometime.

My friend had a Big Boy shake and it's one of those shakes that are presented so beautifully that you almost hesitate to destroy it by putting it in your mouth. But once you do it tastes absolutely amazing. While I had only a bit from my friend for tasting, I could tell by the way he was eating it that it was an enjoyable experience. 

The staffs were good and the ambience is also okay and nothing to complain on that front. 
So overall I really enjoyed my time here and would like to go back again sometime and recommend others to visit as well.

Scoop is famous for serving ice creams at a pocket pinch rate and for the lovely decor. This place is located on the ground floor of new empire building, beside KFC. This place is very close to my heart cause I went on my first date with my fiance. We ordered 'Tik Tok Murgh' which is spicy preparation of chicken. It contains 3 medium size@ pieces of chicken and ordered 'Pahela Nasha' which contains 1scoop of valina ice cream and one scoop of chocolate ice cream with black forest cake along with nuts and cherry on the top..

The interior is nice. But when it comes to food, it really disappointed me. The average serving  size is very less, but it will definitely please your eyes with a catchy presentation. Taste wise also the the food was average. But if you are searching for an ice-cream corner in new market area you can visit this place.

The place has definitely revived both in terms of customer traction and food quality with prompt service. A gentle visit with a few try of the dishes turned out to be pretty enthralling and a nip in the taste bud. Do give a visit next time you are at new market

Can't count the number of times I have visited this place owing to its location in New Market. Mostly crowded, the place is pretty loud for my choice. Average interiors. The butter masala dosa is good in taste and quantity. The biryani combo is a disaster though at the price. Special mixed fried rice was one dish I particularly liked  paired with chicken hot garlic. The mutton dopiaza and butter naan are nothing to go gaga over. And as for desert, I ordered a one called Love and Disaster- the love was so in disguise that all we saw was the disaster. Courteous but extremely late service from the staff.
At the prices charged, the service is surely wanting.
The only saving grace of the place is the Rosa which is value for money.

I loved this small parlor near new market area.It's really a good place with lots of combos and ice creams. I went there with my friends during pujo.Even at that time the quality served is good.We tried Chicken keema Dosa which is astounding great dosa I ever eaten.It became my instant favorite. Along with that I tasted chola batura which is good also.The combos I tasted were fried rice and chilli chicken. Its also pretty okay.But I feel the amount is quite less at that price. Servicing of the combos order required nearly one hour which is pretty irritating.Anyways,it's a good cozy place to satisfy your appetite.Don't think much and taste at least one dosa :) You'll love it!! *_*

Everything is overpriced. The food is not that good. Some of them come free with hair too. And when they change that item with a freshly made one i don't know how that same item turns out smaller in size. My friend had ordered a chicken keema dosa which contained a strand of hair. On complaining they changed the dosa but somehow it turned out smaller in size. Not like he had consumed a big chunk of the initial order too. Moreover the keema was filled with ground bones. Maybe that comes complimentary too.
We had also ordered French fries with cheese and chicken. The same problem with the chicken. I don't know where they get their chicken keema from. But maybe the management doesn't know that bone free chicken keema is readily available in the market. In fact that is the only sort of chicken keema found unless you shove a whole chicken into a mixer grinder and grind it. The fries were half burnt and the cheese....we had to dig up the cheese buried inside the dish.
The only dish worth mentioning was the Aglio Olio. A bit oily but it is prepared with olive oil so not unhealthy entirely. The pasta was perfectly boiled and al dente. The dish was well seasoned too.
I'm sure everyone who has visited New Market has seen this place at least once therefore i did not bother writing about the location. However the staff is quite friendly here and helpful although half of the time they are missing.

I ordered Jap chicken which is my most favourite dish of all the time. With it I went for chicken ala cheese creamy. For sweet tooth I went for blackforest shake. It was yum. I would love to visit this place again and again.

Went to have some refreshment here but the waiters and the atmosphere made us even more tired. The service was the worst, no one came to take our orders for about 15 mins until we called someone. We ordered some drinks and ice cream which were cool and refreshing. But many items on the menu weren't available, this being another reason for the low rating! The restaurant is almost always crowded isn't somewhere you would want to go if you want to eat in peace.

Visited this place almost near to their closing hours after a long walk from sealdah to esplanade. The place was pretty empty. Ordered an Ice cream float and a Pehla Nasha ice cream. The float was delivered wrong and upon informing they changed it promptly. The Pehla nasha ice cream stole our hearts the moment it arrived. Both the looks and taste of the ice cream was good. 
The ambience of this age old shop has also improved a lot after they revamped it. Particularly the numerous mirrors and the cute cat watches add a special zing to the place. Cash and card accepted. Nice place to visit when in the esplanade area...

Located in the heart of New Market, this is one of the restaurants which is busy n filled all round the year. It has got a wide range of cuisine and menu to choose from which makes it a great public attraction. The interiors are decorated with pretty pinks n lights, perfect for kids. Visited on a Saturday afternoon and had to wait for 10mins before we got our table. Ordered a few dishes. The first being fish in garlic butter sauce, which was served with mashed potatoes and very cute garlic bread. The next up was the mutton thali, with mutton curry, tandoori roti and raita. The quantity of this particular dish was disappointing. Next up was the kebab platter which was reshmi kebabs and herb rice, both of which lacked salt to my taste. The last dish of the day was lamb sizzler, which was a clear winner among the rest. The meat pieces were well cooked, soft n succulent, served with a portion of herb rice. The rice and the gravy complemented each other. Then we tried their shakes, strawberry and dark forest shake to be precise. The dark forest shake had crumbs of cake  in it, both of which was served with whipped cream n cookies. Would visit again to try cuisines maybe.

It was on the occasion of Durga puja night that me and my wife chose to go to a less crowded restaurant to try out continental cuisine.... we ordered fish finger...it was served with crispy chips n mustard sauce..pretty good to start on with..in addition to that we took fresh lime soda..besides this we ordered fried chicken in Thai chilli basil sauce-utterly disappointing that was over fried and it was sooo salty that we could not had more than one each...on complaining ,the waiter suggested to take it as parcel instead of replacing it. Next came the main course which comprised of grilled fish in butter garlic sauce,mixed veggie n lemon rice- the same problem persisted ...we cald upon the waiter and told him strait that even the latter dish was also too salty to eat..the waiter instead of solving the problem..started making arguments that it was not possible that both the dishes could have the same problem...it spoilt our puja night... probably would never visit again...very disappointing indeed!!

We ordered-
Mutton roganjosh
Kashmiri pullao
Tandoori roti

Average food. Outstandingly slow service.
Only thing I liked about Scoop was the elaborate use of the color pink in their decor!

I will probably not visit Scoop again.
Well no..I may..to give the desserts a try!

I love the way they serve the icecreams.. The service is really poor.. Very disorganized staff.. They spontaneously serve 3-4 tables and they forget your order...you have to remind some other attendant about your order and then wait some more... And sometimes you blink and your order is there... They need to work on training their staff in proper co-ordination to avoid delay and confusion..

Scoop is located in New market. Interiors are decent with an attractive ambience. Price too seemed reasonable. Went there with a friend few months back and we decided to have continental. We had grilled chicken , stuffed chicken and a puppy love for dessert. The grilled chicken came with mashed potatoes, the stuffed chicken had some boiled vegetables on the side along with some sauce. Both were tasty. Coming to the dessert we had puppy love which was okayish . Overall it was a nice experience going there.

Coming here for quite a few years now. Attractive ambience. Good music. Mostly remains‚Äã crowded. There are variety of items to choose from. The sundaes are really good. Try the jap chicken. It's yummy. Affordable place to visit after puja shopping.

Over all this place is nice and good for dinning out with your friends and family.
And as per the festive season you will get scoop special kind of stuffs ,and food is also nice.
But it might be expensive for students.

Scoop is a mandatory visit for me, when I choose New market as my shopping hub for Puja and other occasions. This place is not that big and spacious,but I like the ambience. It's always a bit over-crowded,but that's okay. The staff are polite and helpful. The food catalogue has a nice range...smoothies, mocktails to sizzlers and Chinese delicacies and various snacks. The food is extremely delicious. And your treat to your stomach can never end without the final scoop of icecream ‚ò∫

This is a great place at the heart of New market.. well the ambience was something attractive.. A multi cuisine restaraunt having Italian, Chinese, South Indian,  Burgers and North indian. The drinks were served in a very special way, something extraordinary. Noodles and manchurian was good.. dhosa we took was also good.
Overall this is a place I will love to visit whenever I am in new market.

The best thing about this place is it is very spacious, which explains the fact that it's almost always full because of it's location of course. Anyway, after some tiresome shopping it was indeed a lovely treat to visit this place. 3.5 because of the management which I believe could have been better. Now food, we had so cheesy pizza regular, it was cheesy and unlike many other normal places the crust was soft and nice. Vanilla float which was good. I had float for the first time and liked it. Kit kat shake really really lovely.. This place is also a must visit.

Visited this popular kitschily decked restaurant in the afternoon after a shopping spree at New Market. Interior is decorated with a riot of colors, bird cage, owl on a tree branch, paper dragonflies from ceiling, watering can sprouting flowers, pictures etc.
We had the Love & Disaster, which came in a boat-shaped glass dish on a dainty doily and adorned with a pretty paper umbrella. The dessert item consisted of three ball-shaped scoops of Blind Love ice cream, drizzled with chocolate sauce and garnished with two chocolate wafers, cashew nuts and topped with a red cherry. It tasted well, enough for two people to indulge in some sweet affair.
For lunch and exquisite-looking desserts and shakes a good choice in the area.

Going to new market before pujas, is a must for everyone. And hence this place remains crowded and full almost always. 

It's a huge area, with decent interiors. The menu is pretty much. You can order whatver your heart desires. The variety is a lot. 
We weren't much hungry, so just ordered a soft drink and Dark temptation sundae. 
The sundae was made of ice cream scoops, and brownies and nuts. Tastes pretty normal. Nothing special.
Service is a bit slow.
They took almost 30-40 mins to get us the ice cream.

It was one of my favourite places, until today. The justification of 4* is that this place has always made me happy in the past. There was a Mango festival going on when I happened to visit Scoop the last time and the two dishes that I ordered were absolutely amazing. With the same expectation I visited today, but alas! I was let down. The place is always too crowded but today even the staff was too busy.

We ordered the following:

Tik Tok Murg: Plain chicken tikka on the mint sauce.

The Majesty: A regular chicken biryani.

Puppy Love: It was as expected and nothing extraordinary. Scoops of ice-cream with whipped cream and gems.

Divine Chocolate: It was supposed to be a best seller but unfortunately the last was just too ordinary. There was nothing divine about the chocolate cake and even the dish was not very clean.

Overall it's a good place but today it was not the Scoop I always admired.

Terrible experince.Went there and ordered Thali Style around 8:30 pm. After about 5 minutes, I ordered Half Tandoori Murg. They served the tandoori Murg around 9 pm. It was way below standard. The chicken, the raita everything was bland.
From here on, began my mind-numbingly long and tedious wait for the main course. During the course of nearly another half an hour, I sat and starved and was border-line ignored by the waiting staff during my repeated enquiries about the remainder of my order.  At around 9:30, I was forced to call the waiter and ask for my  bill on what I have consumed as it was getting late. The waiter checked and informed me that they had not even registered my order of Thali Style, let alone convey it to the kitchen! 
This has to be a new mile-stone in poor quality of service. Thanks a lot Scoop for ruining my evening and wasting an hour of my life.

It's been in my bucket list for so long.

Ambience~ Pleasant. Loved the lightings, music and decors. As it is located in Esplanade area, so the place remains crowded most of the time. The best part is that they keep girl staffs too. 

We ordered for~
1. Oreo Cookie Milkshake : Well, to me, it was not upto the mark. It tastes awkward like someone just mixed a lot of sugar in the water. 
2. Black Forest Milkshake : Heavenly! Way to my heart literally. It tastes sooo good. A must try.

Service could be slow at times.

Today visited this restaurant for lunch in New market area after a tiring shopping. It was around 2.30 pm and the place was almost full. The dining area was quite big with nice decorations. Our today's food journey includes,
* Starter : Chicken Nuggets
* Main Course : Biriyani with Chilly Chicken Combo
* Drinks : Pepsi
The service was quite fast. The food arrived altogether in a few minutes. Firstly the Chicken Nuggets tasted as usual good. 8 PCs of Nuggets were served with chips. Biriyani and chilli chicken combo also tasted decent. Biriyani was just simple and chilli chicken was good. 6 PCs of chicken was served in the combo. Quantity was more than enough for feeding single person. Only one thing that I didn't like at all they served the biriyani and chilli chicken together in a bowl, so that the gravy was all mixed up with the rice. It would be better if they serve the biriyani and the chilli chicken separately. Otherwise the foods were pretty good. Prices were on higher side. They also charged 18% GST on the total amount. Our bill for two persons was 791 RS. You can give it a try once.

Sitting inside a what looks like a colourful assortment of jellybeans, this restaurant destroyed our lunch quite efficiently. We ordered:

1. Tik Tok Murg (festive special) - 2‚≠êÔ∏è
[Nothing special about this variant of kebab, 3 pcs in a small bowl with a slice of lemon. Guess the only thing special about this was that the pieces were actually on top of the green dip. So, even if you didn't want to have the dip, tough luck my friend]

2. Grilled prawn (in garlic butter sauce, bread rolls & veggies) - 1‚≠êÔ∏è
[Starting with getting us the wrong order (rice instead of bread rolls), being casually unapologetic about it, and the frozen prawn being dry and tough AF, this dish was a dismal failure]

3. As You Like It (classic sundae) - 2‚≠êÔ∏è
[They served the 3 scoops of ice cream along with the prawns. So, eventually by the time we had finished the prawn and planning to move to the dessert, it was already about 70% molten]

Amazingly understaffed, I personally had to go up to the counter to ask for the welcoming glasses of water. The food came in either at distant interval, or, as in the case of the dessert, not following any logical order.

A definite 1‚≠êÔ∏è for this place, keep it up üëçüèΩ

This cafe cum dessert parlour is located in the busy streets of New Market area. It's crowded almost all the time due to the location. Whenever I go for shopping at Esplanade I manage to drop in here. The desserts here are to die for. I order Banana split, Moon rocker which gives 3 scoops of butterscotch and one scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocochips, chocolate sauce and nuts. The mocktails are also nice here. You can get a whole variety of cuisines from Vada pav to Chinese and Mughlai. I ordered Crispy chili babycorn and chicken cutlets. I have also had Puri and bhatora. The food is very tasty and the portions are huge. But this place is a little pricey but the food is worth it anyway. The ambience is very colorful and vibrant. It's spacious and won't take much time to get a table. The service is prompt. If you haven't yet visited this place, this recommendation is for you.

Being a popular joint it was very crowded. But I managed to find a place there. I chose crispy chilly babycorn and masala Pepsi.
Masala Pepsi arrived first. The best masala drink I have tasted in recent years. Babycorn was too crispy.

Price was pocket friendly. I must mention that girls are the assets of the joint. I must mention Sangita and Sanju. Very hard working, both of them. Shall visit again.

‚óè Good Place to hangout.
‚óè Good Food, not in quantity.
‚óè Not so Pocket Friendly.
‚óè Staff Behaviour : Good

Been there a lot of times, one of the childhood's favourite place, one can choose any thing from fries to burgers to shakes to icecreams to pasta to chinese dishes. A wide collection of options of foods and desserts! 

Specially the apple shaped chairs near the doors are my favourite from childhood days.

Food Ordered and tasted here:

Grilled Chicken + Smashed Potatoes with Butter Garlic Sauce : Chicken Pieces were not up to the mark but properly cooked. SMASHED POTATOES was very dry, not good. The Butter Garlic Sauce was good enough to save the dish.

Mississippi Mud: Though the name suggests something huge like Mississippi but alas, it will only disaappoint you because it is nothing but a scoop of chocolate icecream. Expected more, got very little.

Scoop is a restaurant situated in near New Market area beside Domino's. The interior decor of this restaurant is really very nice and the seating arrangements and the background music is good. The restaurant serves amazing sundaes and ice-creams and shakes along with main course foods.

Now coming to the food. We have ordered for-

1) Jap Chicken and Noodles combo ( It was good in taste. Nothing extra ordinary and the proportion of food is good for one)

2) Barbeque Chicken Sandwich ( I personally did not like this sandwich. The Barbeque sauce was so runny and the chicken pieces were a bit smelly, chewy and felt like they were stale)

3) Cr√©m√© brulee flavoured ice cream( I loved the way they presented that one scoop of ice-cream in a small tea cup and a chocolate wafer stick. The ice cream was good)

4) First Love ( It was also an ice cream scoop and tasted of caramel and chocolate with small pieces of nuts. I liked this one also)

5) Kit kat shake ( Lovely presentation. I am sorry to say but this was so bad in taste. I felt like I was having some bitter chocolate flavoured water. I doubt whether there was any milk in that milkshake and the only good thing about this is the presentation and those two little small pieces of kitkat)

Service is slow and staffs are courteous but unprofessional in behaviour. We have to ask for water several times as they don't serve water unless you ask them too. Food quality and taste nothing much worth mentioning. Ice-creams are the only good things here. Hope to visit there someday to grab a scoop of some good ice cream.

The food is great. The service is very good. One needs to wait a bit but I can safely say that the food is veery FRESH. We ordered:

Sweet baby corn
Chicken Hakka noodles
Masala Pepsi
Chocolate ice cream

Have to say each item was prepared very well without being too much spicy or blunt. The Hakka noodles stands out amongst the lot. Very smooth and fresh noodles and vegetables with chicken and egg. What I liked most was soy sauce was subtly used in the noodles. Many restaurants uses too much soya sauce which kills the taste overall. The sweet and spicy corn was excellently cooked with a tangy taste. The masala Pepsi was just pespi and JAL jeera but went well overall with the food. A special mention about the ambience..someone did a good job with this. Many thanks

May the best place to grab a munch at New market.

Ambiance of this place is colourful and pretty appealing.

Whenever you feel hungry while shopping at the heart of the city you can hopped into this place.

They serve quite a huge range of food.

We went there in the Evening
Ordered
CHICKEN Jungle Sandwich - this is pretty awesome.
3 layer of bread grilled with ample stuffing of CHICKEN, meyo, vegis and poached egg.taste awesome . Worth every bit of your penny u spent.

Cold coffee with Vanilla Ice cream : this was average not served the way we expected,it was ok.

Service was promt and good.

So If you are craving for snacks while you are at New Market then this is the place...

This place is famous for their ice cream sundae you can try those if you want.

I had always passed by this restaurant but never had a chance to go inside. I did a few days ago, and was really happy with my experience. Food is very good in terms of quality and quantity. Excellent staff. Very professional. Only complaint I have is that the eatery offers free wi-fi, but when I asked about the password, the waiter said he will tell me in a while. It seemed he was going to consult somebody. Weirdly, he never returned with the password.
As for ambience, it's too colorful for my taste. I would like to go there again to try their huge food and drinks menu.

The staffs were good and the food better. 
The fusions and milkshakes are the most exciting things to order and enjoy. 
Waiting for another chance to visit with my gf.

Quite a find. A multi cuisine restaurant with Chinese, Italian, South Indian, North India, and Burgers and finger food. One of the highlights is the multitude of variety of dosas available. I had a Mutton keema dosa, which was good. Good, not great. The keema was way too dry and brittle to be scooped up properly in every bite of the dosa. To top it, the refusal to add a layer of omelette to the dosa came across as surprising. "Our SAP wont allow it, no matter the price" is something you dont get to hear everyday in a hospitality location. The desserts were great though, especially the Mango Lassi and the three flavour ice cream sundae. Loved it.

Scoops has been in my bucket list since long . They are well known for the varieties of milkshake they offer . Visited the joint on one Sunday evening . The interior is quite vibrant and catchy . But ordering was time consuming since the staffs were quite busy . I  ordered for BlackForest milkshake along with chicken cheese burger . The shake was extremely sweet but fulfilling and the chicken cheese burger is just overrated üòè

This is place mainly famous for its amazing ice cream and shakes.. located at the ground floor of New empire cinema adjacent to KFC... 

Other than ice creams I really like their chicken kima dosa which is a bit different then the usual dosa.. it gives a twist to this authentic South Indian dish which is kind of cool.. 
service can be a bit slow when the place is crowded..

Shopping is a tiring task and there's no place to go better than Scoop when hunger strikes amidst all the bargaining at New Market! The place is as colourful as possible and you'll never find it empty (at least I never did!). They nearly serve everything! From pizza to biriyani. So whatever you want to have, they will definitely have it in their menucard. 

I'm a fan of their milkshakes and desserts. The kitkat shake looks lovely but doesn't taste as great as it looks. The burnt onion with chicken curry combo is good and the quantity is more than sufficient for a single person. I've tried their chicken bharta which tastes great but the quantity is not enough for two people. 

To sum up, this place has always been my go-to place whenever I go for shopping at new market. Drop in to quench your thirst or end your hunger with your shopping bags!!

This is the best place to eat out after shopping at New Market. I wonder how I had missed this one earlier despite being a regular in that area.

Location- Beside KFC, Opposite Shreeram Arcade

Interior-
Very well decorated, with colourful lights. Pleasing ambience. We were lucky enough to visit this place when the ground floor was full due to the Eid Rush at New Market, and were taken upstairs. The first floor is an even more calm place, with light-lined glass walls, so that you can see the outside clearly.

Food-
the Continental Cuisine is great here. A huge menu. We ordered:
1. Royal Treat Pizza (regular): The size was decent enough and the pizza was so soft and tender, laden with cheese. Even the sides were mellow, which you don't get at Dominos. The Pizza was served on a wooden utensil.
2. Stuffed Chicken: This was a pure delight. Stuffed with great fillings and served with mashed potatoes and vegetables, it is great to serev two as a side dish.
3.Pehla Nasha: We were just planning to try a dessert and this one's name was attracting us a lot. It is a creamy pastry with milky cream on top and two dollops of yummy ice cream on both sides. What came as a huge but pleasant SURPRISE was that the dessert was served alongside a sparkler candle which sparkled for just a few minutes( fortunately).

Facilities- Free Wifi

Scoops is an all time favorite, located at the heart of New Market. We come here often to grab a quick bite or kill some time. Everything ranging from the food to the ambiance to the service, is praiseworthy. The place is quite spacious and can accommodate a lot of people on a busy day. The staff is polite and quick at what they do, haven't faced any rude or indecent behaviour till date. The menu has a lot to choose from and the food is worth every penny spent. We ordered a Chocolate Milkshake, Cold Coffee, Chilli Babycorn, Creamy Baked Fish and Grilled Chicken with Mashed Potatoes. These were good choices on our part and we enjoyed our food throughout. Standard bill for two people - 1k approximately. Looking forward to come here again very soon.

Food quality- about the food quality I must have to say quality with quantity good and fresh food I almost visit here by every week so I've tasted almost every food the provides all are just awesome at reasonable price tag, but my dear friends if you are looking for biryani then you'll be dissatisfied because this biryani is not similar to regular biryanis which are served in the most of biryani hubs

Ice cream - the most charming and the marvels the main course that makes scoop is there ice cream
the ice creams of scoop attracts me every in single week to come here in scoop in this area scoop is the king of all,  good quality with best teste

Price- if you have between  2000 and you want to give your friends a good treat then rush here!!  high 
quality with cheap rate the main fact is they will never ask you for service tax!!

This is a cute place in the heart of new market (esplanade) Kolkata . This place offers a wide range of shakes,  Icecream and good food.  This place is expensive in comparison to its decor and service.  Those coming here... Must try "phela nasha " Icecream as its divine. Oreo shake too here is really yummy.

This place has changed a lot from what it was in my childhood days. It had a good array of items in their menu which i was fond of. Now the standard gas dropped a lot, some serving people are confused about everything and lack basic etiquettes, coming back to their food, it is not as it used to be but is neither bad. It still serves sone good milkshakes. Juices taste  simply like the readymade ones. Quantity is less than expected.

It was my first visit in scoop. The restaurant is located just opposite the seeram arcade. It is one of the best place to hangout after having all the shopping and enjoy a peaceful time.The decoration was very colourful and the staffs were very friendly with us but the service is too slow.
Coming to the food.....this place is the Paradise for dessert lovers.We ordered 1.Strawberry Cheesecake milkshake and 2.Blackforest Milkshake ....both of them were delicious. The milkshakes were served in mason jars topped with whipped cream and a cherry. The strawberry cheesecake milkshake was beyond my expectations..... I really received the essence of strawberry and the chunks of cream cheese. The blackforest milkshake was very chocolatey.
3. Arctic king : It was their signature milkshake. It was topped with two big donuts dressed up with fresh cream, chocolate and gems. The shake was made with caremal and badam. It was so yummy
Lastly I would say that this place is simply a diamond in rough.

We sneeked off to Scoop for a quick lunch sometime back. The interiors are quite funky, with colorful decor and interesting pictures and quotes on the walls. The menu is also very innovatively designed with cool names and a mix and match of delicacies. 
We ordered chhola bhatura, uttapam, chicken ala king, naan, mutton korma and milkshakes( oreo and butterscotch). The uttapam was yummy. It was very well made, soft and tender. The chhola bhatura was great too. Two huge bhaturas with ample quantities of spicy chhole and pickle made us all very full but then the chicken ala king came and that was amazing too. It was creamy and delicious. The rice and the chicken blended very well together.
Now comes the bad news. The mutton korma was BAD! It wasn't cooked properly, the mutton was hard and the spices hadn't blended together at all. Similarly, the milkshakes tasted pretty mild. The oreo one was just biscuity and the butterscotch one too bland. The service is rather slow and they take at least an hour to bring all the food to the table. But it is pocket friendly. To sum it up, a quick snack at a reasonable price is what this place stands for.

We went there yesterday for a revisit. But what disappointed me is their treatment of the customers. First of all, it took them 10 minutes just to give us the menu card and then after asking the waitress for 5-6 times to take the orders, we had to wait. Then we were informed that it will take longer than average to serve it.. even when we agreed to that, our orders were not taken.. me and my girlfriend are pretty sure that we aren't going to revisit soon.

I visit this restaurant whenever I go to esplanade, one of the oldest and fine decor restaurant with good ambience..so expectations are obviously more... good luck..hopefully your quality of food will be maintained everytime we make a visit..

Scoop is a hidden gem among the hustle bustle of New Market. Known to most college goers, this place has variety of things to offer. Starting from milkshakes to oriental to south indian to pastas pizzas sizlers and what not.
Stays packed most of the time, and because of this mad rush sometimes orders get delayed. Moving on to the food, on my first visit I had a black forest milkshake and spicy garlic noodles. My friends had kitty mat milkshake and oreo milkshake. The milkshake was too good and at the bottom of the jar, there was a piece of cake soaked in chocolate sauce!
Their beverages are really worth a try.
Next, the noodles were okay, nothing great. The chilli was a bit on the higher side which killed the taste of it. Even the quantity was an issue.
Hence, if you'relooking for a place to grab a refreshment or a quick bite whilst shopping at new Market, Scoop might do you justice.

I have been to this restaurant many times after shopping in new market. They make really nice dosas and their Chinese is also worth mentioning. But thats all normal nothing so extra ordinary to make a mark in your mind. The rates are high compared to the portions served. The desert here are good. The mocktails are really pathetic. The worst part of this restaurant is the staff. One literally has to find who's taking orders and stand and call the person in charge. Zero courtesy levels and god knows what's the hurry they always have while taking orders. We used to go there earlier but had stopped due to several bad experiences. Recently visited this restaurant with my mother and daughter and I find nothing had changed. Would suggest everyone to avoid it.

Dissapointment largely from this iconic standing of long time. Service, food quantity failed the great decor and ambience. Waiting time is too much and there is no synchronization. Ordered food just appears randomly and not together. Ordered a bowl meal of noddles and famed zap chicken. Although tasting awesome quantity was really moderate, very same for keema naan, which was this long bread on which a few kebab pieces were placed. Pretty pricey for a combo. Then the continental dishes were grilled chicken and stuffed chicken. The grilled chicked was served with mashed potatoes and the stuffed chicken was more of cutlets with veggies and a sauce. Cancelled an order of ice cream due to waiting time but the micktails named pink me served at the beginning was great. 
What got to me was they have a staff running around to get you places which are mostly not ur preffered seats due to the crowd, the service staff is ridiculously slow and unorganized. No one waiter is assigned to a table and its all higgledy piggledy everywhere.
Much much better service is expected from such a busy, profitable joint at prime location. A little bit more portion at that pricing is also solicited

We have been here many times. The taste and quality of their food never dissapointed us. Their varieties of grilled chicken, chicken sizzlers and baked fish are extremely delicious and cooked to perfection. Kebabs are good but not extraordinary. What makes them special is their vast collection of sundaes and sweet treats with their extraordinary presentations and fancy names. Each one tastes heavenly. The only drawback is that they take too long to serve the food.

This rating is solely based on the sundae icecream which we had after waiting for almost a decade. Scoop, no doubt is the most busy restaurant of New market area but the service quality is not at par with the hustle-bustle.
Today I went with my friends to have a quick refreshments at my favorite ice cream place, but the irony was as much as qsr setup they have in decor and seating arrangement, the service is equally sluggish and disappointing. I ordered for birthday cake milkshake, boss lady-mix pink sauce pasta and three scoops of make your own sundae. We were asked to wait for 15 to 20 min for our order, we received milkshake after around 30 min and the pasta took 15 more minutes after that. And we lost track of time waiting for our sundae and the bill. I paid the bill via Paytm and they made us wait 10 to 15 mins after that just to check their Paytm balance, according to them which they did not receive. Finally they took my contact number and picture of my SMS from Paytm and released us. This was heights of wasting a consumers time and taking the test of patience.
Never ever going back there for food! I could get better food and better service in the same area at that cost.

After roaming around new market on a  hot may day, we finally came across a restuarant with had Ac!! Nothing really made me happy or satisfied about this ice cream parlour/ Chinese/indo/snacks bar restuarant.  The menu is great. Has varieties of different food to savor your taste buds.  But the quality and quantity sucked. Ordered chicken noodles,  hot and spicy chicken,  two virgin mojitos.  Both the main course was ordinary.  virgin mojitos came in those Mason jars. The thing that was the most irritating was the Service. 10 mins into the restuarant and we had to wait for a waitress to serve us water. Moreover even during ordering food, searching for a waitress had become a hassle. For dessert we ordered cotton candy scoop.  Ice cream came already half melted. Give this restuarant a pass.

Ambience-Was really good with beautiful songs and background music and dim lights making the place a perfect hideout from the hustling and burstling of city life. One bad thing is that there were lots of houseflies hovering over our food and tables.

Service-was not upto the mark because they never paid attension to our tables or any tables and were showing how busy they were

Food-average food with lots of ill points. First the cottage cheese sandwich with bbq sauce was pathetic with less amounts of sauce and the bread was really soft and overcooked at places. Then came the french fries whick lagged their signature of crispyness and again a total failure. Then we ordered the desert which was pehla nasha named by the management with no sorts of nasha in it. It was a simple blackforest pastry with two scoops of ice cream over a dirty plate. Yes u read it right the serving plate was dirty and looked like they are using it for a long time. Please look in the pics for the yellow marks in the serving plates which was totally a bad impression for this place.

Overall the place is a disaster with only great music but no proper maintainence of crockery and ill service and below average food quality. Definately will never visit again

It was my first visit over there in scoop.
Yes it is a good place for chilling out with friends. The food is good but it can be slight better.

I ordered for cold coffee which was not up to the mark as per my taste.
Bbq chicken cottage cheese sandwich served with french fries and chicken nuggets, sandwich was little sweet in taste and it was good. But the french fries was not crispy.
I was excited for the dessert item and I ordered their house special dessert pahela nasha (interesting name). Black Forest pastry with 2 scoop of ice cream. The dessert was good but not as it's name.

The main thing which I found that the serving plate was not clean.

Overall the place was oküëç

After a long day, entered into Scoop...AC was chilled inside, whereas outside world were getting scorched by deadly sun.. I was hungry,hence needed a good lunch..Ordered a continental lunch "chump champ" - grilled chicken,mushroom pepper sauce, veggies, bread roll..Later I also had Tutti Frutti Ice cream..Food was good, didn't let me down.. price was reasonable if you consider the place, but service was awful..Before finishing my meal(without my dessert)my bill came, nobody bothered to ask me whether I needed anything more..One person brought the meal, one person brought the initial bill, then the same person brought ice cream for me, another person brought the final bill..So confusing...If you are not bother about service or feeling embarrassed, then this might be an ideal place to hang around..

This quick bite spot is one of the best of its kind in Esplanade area in many ways. The ambience is good, with perfect decor for couples and love birds, although the backdrop music is not the best. Food is delicious and wholesome, besides being reasonably priced. Don't go by the name - this restaurant offers much, much more than ice creams or desserts. Service is good.
Most shoppers in this area who don't know about this beautiful restaurant here tend to miss this one amidst other more popular food joints nearby.

Visited this place some six to seven times because it's kinda go to place for folks whenever they visit new market for shopping . But we didn't used to like the place. The staff was very rude and unprofessional and foods were kind of bland. However the last visit surprised us . The staff seem polite , cordial and waaaay more professional and the food yummy . so congratulations to The scoop for their new improvements .Hope you will keep it up.

Visited with my mom. We were not really looking for a full dinner. So we just ordered one scoop each each of a cheesecake ice cream and a strawberry flavour. The ice cream was great and my mom thoroughly enjoyed it. I ordered crispy chili babycorn and they were perfectly crispy although it seemed to have an extra amount of vinegar. 
Food is reasonably priced but they charged us 10bucks for a flimsy container which felt absurd.

New market hopping is incomplete without visiting scoop. The interior and ambience is quite good. The staffs are courteous though the service is little slow and the price is bit high. Their blazing garlic noodles and zap chicken is a good combination to try. Paradise found sundae is simple yet tasty. But what I like the most are their milkshakes. Birthday cake milkshake is awesome. Kitty Kat is nice but can be less sweet I guess.

What to say. Was really hungry. Went on to have some good food. Tried building a good ambience. But loud Bollywood music in front of my ears wasn't pleasant at all. Waited for 15 long minutes for a glass of water, and another 5 minutes for the staff to @take the order. Aam panna was good. Meatballs pasta should better be named as ketchup pasta with nuggets. Ordered some kind of chicken steak, the veggies were fresh, the dip was too bad, and so was the chicken. Tasteless, not even salted and marinated properly. Surely, wont recommend to anyone.

I have been here twice and my experience has always been awesome. This place is located opposite Sreeram Arcade and the place is always crowded with people no matter when you drop in. So I visited this place yesterday it was my birthday so I was in  Scoop for my Birthday lunch. So I ordered A combo meal in which they had A Medium size Pizza, 4 pieces of garlic bread with cheese and 2 tumblr of coke and ordered a bowl meal Biriyani with Chilli Chicken. The pizza was delicious and the biriyani was okay and the chicken tasted good as well. On in all the food was good. The place is really ideal for chilling with friends because the place is decorated beautifully, with good music and with a refreshing atmosphere. The best part was that we got a discount of 10% because it was Tuesday and I was there with 2 of my girl friends so it was basically a Ladies special discount which was really cool. I'm in love with this place an hope to visit it again.

This place... Couldn't even keep a count on the number of times I have been here.. The crowd mostly consists of shoppers from new market.. The variety of food it provides makes it stand out from the rest of the restaurants nearby.. Starting from dosas to sandwich to desserts to noodles n then sizzlers tried most of the menu.. Special mention of mango panacotta (which I guess was seasonal) was worth it..

When you are hell tired after having a shopping spree at New Market,you can go to Scoop,a multicuisine restaurant where you can get anything and everything from sandwich,burger,pizza ; noodles,fried rice,manchurian to polao,biryani,vada,dhosa.

We ordered chicken a la king,vegetable polao and chicken butter masala,garlic nun and kadhai paneer.We had to wait for quite a long time.And my creative friend made that time productive by decorating the plates with sauce.well you all can see that in the pictures below. :)

I was so hungry,and that chicken a la king felt like heaven in the mouth.But then,when I've almost finished half of my plate,I saw a hair in it. The server was called and she brought another guy with her.And the guy said that they were extremely sorry for the hair fiasco.They took the old plate and brought me a new plate.This time I was a little sceptic about the food.But,thankfully,there was no hair. :P But the dish tasted yummy.The smell of cheese did increase my appetite.

The vegetable polao was good.I will definitely recommend this to others.Chicken butter masala was alright.

Kadhai paneer was good.Garlic nun was okayish,not as good as expected.

The desert looked great but I found nothing except a dollop of whipped cream and a liquidy substance.

All in all,the experience was good.The staffs were courteous.

Well The Moment You enter the place ,the colorful dim lights welcome you and the staff member offers you with greetings and menu.They are quick with service and modest enough to inform if the order will take time. We tried Chicken Sizzler And Moon Rocker along with chicken cheese sandwich .Food is good and the music they play is soothing.The only turn off thing was they insist you for the bill if you are done with your order as to accomodate waiting crowd.Staff are concerned about feedback and thats good. Overall it was a nice visit . For a good interior and elaborated menu you can opt for this place.

The most attractive thing about this restraunt is it's Pink decor and catchy taglines and names of dishes. The interior, which is almost completely pink, makes one feel really good. And if you are a girl, then they will make sure that they do treat you the best way with all the special discounts and taglines. 
Well, the food is good both quantity and quality wise. They serve tasty food in surplus quantity within acceptable budget. 
You will find, female attendants dressed in pink, doing their best for you. Our table's attendant was Ms. Sangita, a really sweet and attentive lady who was simply one call away. She served the food with perfection and made sure everything was accurate. 

Overall, this is a nice place to hang out with friends and getting your sweet tooth satisfied.

We enjoyed delicious food. They have a large choice of different foods. We ordered chicken tikka and chicken tandoori butter masala with garlic cheese naan, which was a dream. The atmosphere was really nice. The decoration is very coulorful, music is good. The service (our waitress was Sanju) is also very friendly and helpful. The only negative things we recognized are the temperature in the restaurant. It was to cold for us. And the other thing is that our waitress urged us too much to write this review.

Been to Scoop after so many years with a friend.  The service was quite good. Especially Sanju's. She was quite warming and friendly. We ordered chicken lollipop which was very great. But the french fries were not as expected. Then we ordered oye lucky ice cream.. Though it was quite a treat to the eyes but apart from the different Scoop of ice cream flavours the layer of cakes was not so good... Rather it was quite dry.so if they serve that layer with some whipped cream it will taste better. Thank You Sanju for such a good service.

Though many other new restaurants has opened in this area in recent years, this place hasn't lost its charm & glamour a bit. Quality & taste of the food and very well behaved staffs are the main factors which helped them to retain their fame. I would like to mention Ms. Sangeeta Kundu & Ms. Ruma Das specially for their special attention & professional attitude. Wish team scoop all the very best.. Keep going guys.. :-)

Scoop does not needs an introduction in a different way. It is a place where you will find everything to eat be it Indian, Chinese, Continental or Mughlai. Since when I was introduced to Scoop by one of my friends, I always tried their chicken keema dosa, which is out of the box & obviously tasty. I never thought of trying anything else. But recently I went their with my friend & tried their continental part of menu & I must say they almost excel in that also. CHUMP CHAMP CHICKEN GRILL, a treat to your taste buds, creamy, succulent chicken in that extremely yummilicious sauce with sauted vegetables & buns. Ending with the dessert, LEE LING BROWNIE WITH PEANUT BUTTER, one of its kind of dessert, treat for your eyes & tongue, both.

Scoop is always talk of the town ; favourite place for me too also but my few days before visit made me very annoyed about the
 food..regarding service its moderate & the last thing which i feel the worst is about a lady who continuously provoked me for good comments against her & i noticed her she was approaching each table for gd reviews in her name so my question is its s very bad practise.& its very embracing i.@ can still remember her name .,sangita..I also notice sangita droping water on da tsble while pouring into da glass so i want tu tell her before expecting good comments she should do da gd sevice..Management should kick her outr for betterment of da company.

We ordered a pizza combo and it was mouth savoring.  The flavour was very authentic and cheesy enough.  A must have if you are a foodie.  Garlic bread in the combo was a delicious delight as it had the balanced flavours of garlic and cheese.  The combo is also great for your pocket as it is reasonable enough. Our attendant Sangita was very polite and was very warm and charming, so all together it was a great experience.  A favorite destination from now on for me.

You make good food, the decor and ambience is fab but one thing rather a problem, you make extremely oily food. I ordered yesterday paper plain masala dosa and cheese dosa. Dosa should be made in less or no oil but what i got was my fingers stained badly in oil, and due to oil i could not finish the tempting food. The chutneys were fab but dosa too oily.

Very colourful interiors....Once you step into the restaurant you are bombarded with bright colours from all sides. It adds to the informal and peppy atmosphere. The service staff are good, our server was Sangita and she went about her work smilingly and pleasantly. She even gave her suggestions about which icecream to have but in a gentle and mild manner, not overly aggressive but gently persuasive. Waiting time after the order was given was also moderate. Had paneer tikka and it was good, soft and succulent paneer pieces with tandoori masala and cooked well in tandoor with slightly charred edges giving it a smoky flavour. The pudina dip which accompanied it was tangy and tasty. The onions salad too added to the taste. The icecream, new one, strawberry cheesecake was excellent. 
But I feel that this place is somewhat overpriced. 
Otherwise good place.

Deco and ambience is superb especially  da elegant hieght. you  can feel a soothing effect of a classical resto of global cuisine. Management are highly appreciated including lovely staff. Overall food is excellent. Fried chicken Thai style and grilled fish in lemon butter sauce is awesome. More a hostess named by sanju has taken a especial care. Her attitude, simplicity, way of communication is the best which me and my family and friends admired. If it happens to everyone (guest) thanI can say she is an asset to an organization. Thanx a lot to all team scoop.

Both the ambience and food are good especially the behaviour of the staff Miss Sangita is too good. Here different types of food is available. Everytime we came here we discover different type of foods.Yet we didn't try all the food but its menu force us to come here everytime to taste is new culinary .

Last week went there with my friends.. First of all I like the ambience of this place.. This place was nicely decorated which I like the most.. We ordered 1. Spicy chilli garlic noodles with jap chicken, 2. Basil noodles thai style with prawn hot garlic and 3. Chocolate chips ice cream .. Personally I didn't like the taste of spicy chilli garlic noodles but basil noodles was much better than that ( but it was not fab) .. Quantity of food was not at all good.. Just because I love everything related to chocolate that's why I liked their ice cream.. It is a pocket friendly place.. This place is mainly famous for their desserts, cakes etc.. It is located at Esplanade so anyone can go there after shopping.. I am not going to recommend it..

The place is called Scoop , where they have picked a scoop of every colour and theme possible on earth and made a sundae. I don't understand the true essence of the place. You get mixed vibes from the place. 
The quantity has reduced, the taste is not worth mentioning. Average food at affordable prices. If you like blaring music and jazzed up decor and happen to be at New market then you can try this joint.

It's really sad that such an iconic restaurant has gone below any standard ,if there was an option of lesser than one would have given that (so unfortunate) ,well my review us solely based on the service staff and to sum extent the ambience , the staff has no idea about the menu, wen asked a staff what baked dishes they have he started telling me about kebabs ,what we did not order comes to our table and a min later the staff comes and says " sorry sir iska billing hogaya tha " ,then to worsen things the so called grill chicken I ordered comes and it's absolutely cold n the mash potato was stale . The music is so loud what u say to the staff and what the staff hears god only knows , the quality of food is pathetic ,think only the ice-creams a reason to go to that place , wen I asked for the manager the captain turns up saying to tell him n he will convey it to the manager ,really dumb I must say . Funny thing was I was so surprised when I saw people coming after us are eating finishing and leaving did not know a grilled chicken takes over an hr to make and a steak takes allmost the same .... All I wish n hope they realise where they are lacking ,sad to see such and iconic restaurant turn into like this ........

The initial razzmatazz (from pics....) gave me hope, but, the umpteen no of "not available" answers from the staff on enquiring about the menu got me back to my criticism mode....
Coming down to brasstacks, two cold coffees, a masala pepsi and a fried chicken later, I was poorer by ‚Çπ617, just about ok....
Quality....truth be said, nothing to write home about, the chicken smelled stale and the oil tasted old and used....
Being in new empire cinema complex, it's always a nice and nostalgic feel, this place ruins it for me....if theirs a crowd, it seems that is purely because it's NEW MARKET....

If you are shopping at New Market throughout the day and you are tired and hungry, Scoop is the place to go. I've been here twice and even though the place is crowded and the service isn't quite fast, the food and desserts will completely satiate your hunger.
Ordered a cheese dosa, which was overloaded with cheese. 4/5. The KitKat shake is really delicious. What I really loved was this ice cream by the name As You Like It. It has 5 different flavored scoops, real fruits and wafers as toppings and is amazing. A must try.

We went to scoop to satisfy our sweet tooth cravings. The restaurant was nicely decorated because valentine's week was going on. We ordered As You Like it Sundae and we chose one scoop each of tutti fruti, butterscotch and kesar pista.. The ice cream was awesome.. We also ordered Heart Throb which contain red velvet cake with cream and 2 scoop of two in one ice cream and a cookie.It was so nicely decorated but I personally feel that the cake was bit hard but other than that every thing was just fine.

I've been to this place a lot of times. The service is usually slow but the food is good and affordable. They have launched a new item, Creamy Baked Fish. On the whole, it's a nice dish. A thick fillet of fish well baked and topped with mozzarella cheese. It's served with roasted broccolis, potatoes and onions. A dash of lime in the potatoes would have made a world of difference. The palate became a little boring at times. I would like to make a special mention of Ms. Sanju Singh who was extremely courteous and went out of her way to make the visit memorable unlike my past experiences at the restaurant. I also tried the blackforest milkshake. It was not extraordinary,but  it was good.

Located in one of the busiest place of Kolkata and I tried Keema Dosa there as one of my friend suggested. It was good and my accompany tried tango which was nice as well. But service needs to be rejuvenated to get back the glory.

The New Market Area, the shopping hub has always been crowded with the fashion lovers. But, the place is quite popular among the foodies too and if you‚Äôre one among them, Scoop can be your pick. This is a perfect place to relish multiple cuisine; from South Indian to Chinese; from North Indian to Italian. Besides, a wide range of luscious desserts is there to be selected from. 

Last time, I went there to get some quality time with my dear buddies and had Chicken Sizzler, Chicken Salad and BB Chicken Burger. The Chicken Sizzler was a must have preparation that you would like to relish again and again. The salad was a perfect blend of lettuce and onion along with chicken tikka. Quite naturally, the taste of the dish was ravishing and state-of-the-art too. In addition, the burger, which was simply yummy, deserves complete appreciation. The grilled chicken was perfectly mixed with the mouth-watering BBQ sauce and the delicious cheddar cheese. The flavor and daintiness offered by the melted cheese totally mesmerized me.

Overrated place in the middle of a hustling market area, staff is lazy and sloggy! 
Ambience is too loud and congested. The music add bitterness to the ambience. 
Coming to the food, we had Chole Bhatore and Tango. As per the waitress, Tango would contain coriander rice and kebab. However it had butter rice. The size of the kebabs was good, but they could have been more soft. Tango as a whole is a very dry dish as they did not serve any chutney with the kebabs.

Whenever I go to Newmarket, after finishing our necessary marketing I always prefer Scoop for quick bite, evening snacks or dinner when needed.It is situated just below New Empire cinema hall. Not so decorated but always occupied by customer for availability of quality food in reasonable price. Today in the evening we have tried fried fish and chicken(with cheese and egg) club sandwich as recommended by attending lady Ms Sanju Singh, it was awesome in one word....üëç

In spite of being the heaven for the ice cream lovers the Scoop of New Market also performs a prominent duty of keeping the taste-buds of everyone happy by serving delicious dishes. The place is a bit crowded, but all the waiting will actually come out to be beneficial after having a bite of their unique cuisine. Our last week‚Äôs visit to this awesome place actually became fruitful due to the variety of dishes served in the outlet. 

The ambiance of the food parlor was absolutely brilliant and the nice background  music of the place goes perfectly well with their marvelous food items. The dishes we decided to try consisted of chicken sizzler, chicken salad and BBQ chicken burger. The freshness of the lettuce and onions could easily be felt with every bite of the Chicken Salad we had. The pieces of the chicken used in making the salad were quite big. The BBQ Chicken Burgers we ordered were also very delicious. The chicken used in making the burger was perfectly grilled and the BBQ sauce, paprika, and cheddar cheese used in the burger made the dish more delicious. The Chicken Sizzler was also a mention worthy dish. 

The affordable price along with the wide range of food items are enough for the people to pick the outlet as a cool hangout place with their pals.

Been here so many times.... Don't even rememer how many times.... But the saddest part is they don't treat their regular customers nicely I guess.... Yesterday I went to scoop with my boyfriend for dinner after office.... In the beginning everything was fine but after ordering tikka kabaab they made us wait for almost 45mins.... We kept on calling the service boys and girls but nobody answered.... The waitress who took our order (Sangeeta) is the most ill-manered girl with full of attitude who doesn't know to behave with their customers.... I kept on asking her that what is the status of the food ordered she didn't even bother to answer instead went to other waiters and kept on commenting by pointing finger at us.... The captain of the waiters (Sankho) kept on saving and hiding her faults from the manager when I was leaving the table without even touching the kabaabs.... Very Very Very disappointed with the service this time especially from Sangeeta and Sankho.... Scoop team should take an action for their misbehavior.... But there are also some good waiters like Sanju, Ram, Asif and etc.... A BIG THUMBS DOWN FOR SANGEETA AND SANKHO üñì
And they are charging really high nowdays which really unacceptable.... First of all you give that discounts like post on fb get a discount, mondays wear pink get a discount, tuesday wear that get a discount, and so on and even after the discount they charge you vat tax, service tax and makes the bill same or a bit @higher which is same to the bill before discount.... I know you are running a business but don't fool people like this because we come enjoy food and ambience so we pay.... That doesn't mean that you will fool us this way.... Really disappointed with their service.... Otherwise they have great food and awesome ambience.... I like visiting there almost everyday.....

Whenever I go to citimart I always visit scoop restaurant for filling as da food & service of da staff is excellent & uptu da Mark , even in rush time stone remains unturned but dis time a bitter experience which I felt from a lady sangita who provokes me for a Gd review in her name.A staff can't force for review in her personal purposes.Management should strict on dis concerned matter.

I like yr restaurant's decoration n behavior of staffs ,  specially Sanju Singh.  Background music is also good. Lightings are perfect.  I ate panfried chicken momo,  coffee and chicken lolipop.  I like flavor and texture of pan freid momo but didn't like chicken lolipop.  It's coating was hard enough n should have served with chuttney to enhance its taste.  üòä this was my 2nd visit here.  Will like to again enjoy food here. Very good gril sweet sanju

food was good
ordered paneer dosa and miss roshani noodles. both tasted good and Sangita was in service who was prompt and smart. The ambiance was nice as well. But the service was not at all good.

it was cheeky Friday which was supposed to give us a coupon or discount upon asking. But we didn't get it despite asking about what's cheeku Friday. Moreover, the waitress came for 3 times to make sure that I have written a review or not. This should not be the practice of almost forcing to write a review.

Second visit here. Quite crowded, expected when you're bang in the middle of New Market. Known for its desserts but didn't try any.

Ordered the chicken cheese burger. OK. Served not with French fries but with the home made potato chips. The burger could have done with a bit more molten cheese, since the patty was dry. But it was tasty, and gets you full.

Chicken nuggets were really good. Soft, succulent. Fish fingers were disappointing. This is one dish I have everywhere I go, and this was too dry. Also, they don't serve it with tartar sauce, so another drawback that. Only reason I'm rating it 3.5 instead of 4.

Wanted to come here after seeing so many people posting photos of the deserts they had here.
But, honestly I found the place not very recommendable especially for vegans.
They cook the veg food in the same oil and utensils as they cook non veg (asked the waiter)
And the desert seemed too overpriced.

Try their Paneer Dosa. It's an all time favourite of mine.
I love this place since forever and i'm sure any Kolkata shopper frequenting New Market would agree with this. 
Their sizzlers are a must-try! 
I've tried their desserts twice and i've been a little disappointed both times, but i guess that was just bad luck.

The visit to SCOOP was the result of a very sudden planning. Standing amidst new market we surfed zomato for a nearby place to have our lunch.. And scoop unexpectedly happened to us and more unexpectedly left us awe-stricken with what it had to offer. 
The first thing which hit us and for which the restaurant stands out is the ambience.. Just awesome. There is something very innocent, soothing and refreshing about the ambience. The interiors are very beautifully decorated with thermocol art. There is pinkish hue in the interiors created by the lights renders the place a childish attitude. The awesome music also adds to the beauty of this place. 
Next coming to food they have a pretty interesting menu card at least the new anglo indian section to be precise. They have added  a lot of innovative continental dishes in this new section. We ordered - 
UNCLE DENZIL MUTTON STEAK (from the new anglo indian potluck menu) - slightly gravy mutton steak served with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The mutton was soft and juicy. Tasted awesome. Even the mashed potato was tasty. 
INDONESIAN CHILLY NOODLES WITH CHICKEN SATAY (from the old menu) -  noodles served with 4 pieces of kabab-like fried chicken. Very innovatively delicious. 
FROZEN COCO- SCOOP is famous for their desserts. And this item does justice to their fame. This is also one of their new additions and most importantly comes at a very cheap rate. Consists of layers of cream with  a cherry on top with ice cold coco beneath. A perfect happy ending to an awesome meal.
Now regarding the pocket pinch,  I found SCOOP to be very much pocket friendly. The portions they serve is for one person and not adequate for sharing. But still considering the quality it is way more reasonable than other joints in the city and that too being located in the heart of kolkata. More importantly they DO NOT CHARGE THE EXTRA SERVICE CHARGE. That is a relief for sure. 
Once i learnt that  often the greatest pleasures comes in the most unexpected ways. Scoop just set a perfect example for that!! 
Bon apetit

This restaurant is great as an ice-cream parlour. The Chinese items are very tasty. Also, the restaurant comes up with innovative bowl meals and platter. The price is a bit high if quantity is considered. The ambience is really great with coloured. 
Much like the decor of the place with fleecy pink clouds on the ceiling this place is sure to send a sweet tooth to cloud 9.  It‚Äôs a multi cuisine restaurant and has huge variety of foods to offer. Be it Chinese, north Indian, south Indian or continental snacks. The menu has so much to offer that it took us a while to decide what to have exactly. 
Nice place to hang out with friends in Esplanade.

This place is nice for a hagout with your friends. The ambiance and the d√©cor is quirky and cool. Coming to the food, we ordered chicken fried rice, chicken noodles, garlic chicken and chicken club sandwich. They gave vegetarian fried rice first but after a lot of arguments they changed it. Food was good, but not worth the price, i mean you can get better food at a better price elsewhere.

First visited this place few days back with my friends at that time the food seemed okay. But my second experience with this place went very bad.. The food were just horrible quantity of salt in chicken keema dhosa was just too much told them about this as we were unable to finish that but they didn't give a damn to our complaint.. If on a festive evening they serve this kind of food then I don't know how they handle their customers in a regular basis. Very bad experience.

If there were ratings in negative then it would have been easier..
Went with my friends few days back ...the food taste is simply average..the waitress stand iddle..and had to call multiple times for a glass of water also..and the one word they know..is thora time lagega..for the order it's ok..but for the bill they took 20 minutes.
Is this some kind of joke they do with customers..
Moreover they don't listen to what we order.atge waitress missed out orders and we had to wait for another 20 mins ..then the desserts ..north star and fluffy simple tasted like chocolate flavoured HORLICKs..if you really wana taste it ..your wish
. When asked to serve I guess they didn't like it at all..when asked not to serve more on my plate she kept on adding...like was she crazy??
It's not like you ppl have less staffs but the ppl stand ...sluggish behavior is not at all accepted honestly.
Scoop has been my favourite..but over this experience the expectation has gone down the drains 
The management please do the needful..so that the image doesn't drop further for other foodies.

We ordered "chef spcl sizzler with saffron rice" , issues we faced
1. Quantity was too less.
2. Taste was not good at all
3. They gave pav instead of rice
4. In bill they charged for saffron rice .

After that we ordered 2 main couse, raita and breads
Issues faced
1. Taste was not good 
2. Service wss poor, no waiter was available. 
3. Staff was too less to serve all the tables. All waiters were in hurry. Were not taking orders properly nor were serving food properly. 

Food is not much costly but not worth a penny. It wasted our money , good mood.

The ice-cream parlour in new market area. 

Been here many times. 
These people gave us a real place of enjoyment way before other coffee shops. 

Scoop is synonymous to elegance attitude and an era.

I visited here from chandigarh and tried idli vada and steam idli for the very first time which was very delicious. This is first time when I visit scoop where the preparation and the service is very good. I visit here with my friend and he also tried onion uttamam and Masala Idly which was also really it was very mind b lowing. For a nice preparation and a delicious taste we visited scope 3 times. 

The service given by Sangeeta mam was also very gud .thnx she understand that what type of food we want to have and really she serve as same we want.  Thnx to her also.. excellent  service given by her.

It's a  popular food joint in the bustling New Market area. The interior is quiet spacious and cozy. Though it's known for the delicious scoop of Ice Creams they serve but their pizza is also good. Tooty Fruity & As you Like It scoops are quiet delectable with a very good presentation. Service is prompt and free wi-fi is an added bounty! One can comfortably spend time on munching wide variety of food.

Visited this place earlier and it was quite okay but this time my experience was really bad. I had ordered chicken steak and chicken sizzler. The taste was almost same except for the fact that sizzler was served in the way it should be that is in a sizzler plate. The rice served with sizzler tasted bad. Moreover the steak was really cold.I literally felt like running away without paying the bill !

A very bad experience !! I have been here before and it was pretty good. Today i went after a very long time and i ordered for fresh lime soda cold drink which was not cold and it was like im drinking water it didnt even tasted like im drinking cold drink. Then we ordered for Chicken Lolipop pathetic it was. It was not cooked properly from inside it had chicken blood and the last order was a combo of BBQ Chicken Sandwich & French Fries. The sandwich was cold. Had few bites and then i left the sandwich. French fries was cold as if it was made earlier then we asked them to change the fries and gaves us another one was was badly oily. A realy bad experience !! üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéIts better to have Street Foods outside its far better than the foods available here !!

Highly over hyped place. Prices are high and dishes are not that good when consider in the price. In chicken sizzler for 310 you get rice that it equivalent to amount to chutney/shambar you get in Idli/Dosa. Ice-creams are good. Place is surely overhyped. Then had to go to Royal for dinner.

Right in the heart of New Market, it is easily accessible by Metro Railway.
We order Very-cheesy chicken Pizza, Cold Coffee with Ice Cream and Masa Dosa.
The pizza was very cheese and the cold coffee was delicious. I absolutely loved it!
The Dosas were crispy and the Sambar was very tasty
The pocket pinch is affordable .
The service is good too.

We went there in between peak hours, but glad that we didn't have wait, we entered and got our seat. We ordered a Big Boy Shake which the waiter told will take sometime to serve and a Chicken Club Sandwich. The ambience was very lively and very good. Around after 25mins the Big Boy Shake was served, it looked so good, so great, but the taste was just better than average compared to its looks. The cream and chocolate spreaded over the was good but the shake could have tasted a bit better. We spent more time in clicking photos of the Shake. The Sandwich was good especially the layer of the cheese and egg made it taste very good. Their service was very good and up to the mark.

Very bad experience. Worst presentation....they literally served fish finger worth 195bucks in an aluminium cup that people generally use in their bathrooms. And the waiter informed us that despite of complains the manger did not pay any heed and never bothered to change that. In fact it is the waiter who advised me to write in zomato. Moreover the food tastes below average but priced much higher.

I haven't been here for quite some time and lot of things must have changed, but my review is based on previous experiences & memories made at this place, specially when I was a college student. I have always loved their chicken Sizzler and the Go as You Like was my favourite dessert item.
A very vibrant place , well located and with a huge seating capacity, is a very good option to make your tummy happy after the all the tiring shopping at New Market.

I used to visit Scoop since the time it was only an Ice-cream parlour.
This is the place from where I learnt to have ice cream so lavishly. Got introduced to sundaes.
Shopping in New Market has drastically decreased since 2010 and so has our visit.
Never had the chance to come back after it turned to a multicuisine restaurant. Hope to give it a visit someday.

Been to this place many a number of times. There ice creams are delicious! And they come in big jars instead of cones. The sundaes might seem overpriced at first, but one dig into the sundae and ypu will realise its worth it. The main course dishes are okay, reasonably priced but their ice creams are the speciality.

Scoop is famous for its indulging sundaes.
I have visited scoop only for them. They never fail to delight me. 
The sundaes are moderately priced. 
If you ask about the other items, scoop offers indian, chinese, mughlai, italian cuisines. I guess too much for a single restaurant. The main course items are in my opinion overpriced.

This nicely decorated place is located opposite of Sreeram Arcade and just beside the New Empire.
They have a tons of different items on their menu from Indian to Chinese to continental and Italian and what not and also there are varieties of desserts and shakes.The ambiance at this place is quite noisy but the interiors which is mostly in pink colored theme is impressive.

We Ordered : Mixed Grill Sizzler with rice and Big Boy Shake.

WE had to wait about 15 minutes for our Sizzler to come.But,it was worth waiting for the
dish.It consisted 1 piece of fish,1 piece of Mutton And and a large chunk of Grilled Chicken,served with rice and a Sunny side up egg.It was really delicious and a must try dish for all.
THEN it was the time for the shake.It came with 2-3 scoops Vanilla and 1 scoop of chocolate ice cream served in a dark chocolate layered glass jar with full of cream and a Brownie on top.Also 
it was decorated with 3 pieces of ferrero rocher and colorful Gems and a cherry on top.
The shake was insane and wonderful.

We had to pay Rs-716/- for these two dish and yes they did charge additional taxes.
¬†
The staffs were friendly but sometimes they were slow and didn't pay attention to the client.
I will visit again because of the food, which was good and also for the desserts.........

Though the place is legendary and a major landmark, I sincerely feel Scoop needs to pull the socks up for it's own good. A restaurant with ample space and quirky decor (though personally I do not like the colorful plastic seating arrangements), you can hangout here with friends for hours. ¬†Please note, due to it's super awesome location, most of the time you will find this place to be over crowded.

Food is good. Portion is good. Price is reasonable. Service okayish.¬†

P.S. The hygiene factor needs a check.

A visit to Scoop is must if I am in the area. The fleecy pink ceiling and bright colourful decors would instantly brighten up your mood! The staff service is excellent - everyone is so cordial and helpful. Scoop is known for its dessert assortments. The As You Like It is great! Three of us were finding it difficult to finish. I have tried their pop chicken (good one), super duper thin crust (tasty and crunchy), creamy cheese sauce pasta (yummy), special mixed noodles (quite good), hot garlic chicken (hot!), a couple of their milkshakes and divine chocolate. I was never disappointed.

Much like the decor of the place with fleecy pink clouds on the ceiling this place is sure to send a sweet tooth to cloud 9. The decor - 5/5 , the milieu 5/5, the food 10/5. Food is par excellence here. We ordered milkshakes; each flavour was mouthwatering and extremely filling later we ordered French fries, a non masal dosa and a cardimum tea. The tea needs a special mention not only for its splendid taste but also for the salty savories that came along with it. This dreamy place becomes all the more better with the service that it offers. The service providers are extremely warm and enthusiastic. A special mention to Sanju Singh. She is a sweet heart and this review is also a shout out for her. I hope she gets to read it. A place worth going back and quite rightly placed under the legendary section of Zomato.

SHOPPERS' STOP!

When our legs ache of walking in the congested streets of Eaplanade, our hands pain of carrying heavy shopping bags and our eyes are tired of window shopping, we drop in to this colourful to look at food through a coloured glass. The pasta dishes, the steaks and the sizzlers to be happily concluded with abundant ice cream in different flavours - has always been our set plan and we have never been disappointed whether in the matter of price or proportion or service. This place gives some space and time to its eaters and is always a happy relief to the tired shoppers.

I've often passed by this place,  since it's situated at the heart of a bustling new market area. I believe the interiors have recently been re-done. It looks more like a flashy,  fancy joint for kids with all the vibrant colours. Huge menu,  though I'm not sure if everything is available. When I visited,  sandwiches were unavailable. We ordered penne in tangy tomato sauce and a plate of fish and chips. The food tastes good,  without any doubt. However the saddest part of the whole experience has been the staff. I hate to say this,  especially when I see how the serving staff is normally overworked in restaurants. But this was a cold treatment on a whole new level. Within a min. of occupying our table,  a guy comes to us for order. Like,  seriously? Then he asks us if we wanted a regular or bottled water. Upon asking for a regular one,  he gives an extremely weird smile (as if almost saying : bah! Regular weirdos,  can't afford a thing). Please note,  it's not just me, my friend felt the same as well. Then within,  3 mins. Another person comes for order and we hadn't even gone through have the menu. After this we really had to crane out necks out and call someone to place an order. Apparently,  the staff wasn't even aware if the  sandwiches are grilled or not. All in all,  we got a bill of Rs. 480 approx. I'd certainly not wish to go back to such a cold treatment. I could've rated lower,  but I really appreciate the chef's work. I wish the management reads this review and makes some improvements.

Had heard a lot about this place so decided to try out with my mum. I must say it boasts of a cream location in New Market... 

We stepped in at abt 12:30 in d afternoon and was surprised dat they weren't ready for d order though d shop is supposed to cater to order by 12noon. This scored negative from meüò£

We picked up from d bowl meal section and ordered veg fried rice with chilly fish.... I was very disappointed by d fried rice... Real bad taste (possibly one of those bad days)but then chilly fish tasted gud...
Quantity wise I would say its filling..

Had ordered a coke float which was gud.

I would hav given d store a 3 but then I was shocked that they do not hav proper washrooms... This is appalling... Not at all expected from such .a renowned restaurant... They directed to a common washroom somewhere on d first floor in a shabby nook which is not at all maintained. I hope they do something regarding d washrooms.

Besides d washroom issue I feel they place is quite gud..and moderately priced...

The cappuccino is served with a chocolate spoon..aaahhh awesome! I dont usually click pictures here, but have got a few for the first time. Do try the pizzas pastas and the sizzlers.

They have a tonne of different items on their menu from Indian to Chinese to continental and Italian and what not and also there are varieties of desserts and shakes to curb ones sweet tooth. The ambience over there is nice and clean and it is nicely decorated, what I like the most are the glasses in which they serve water and their little jars for serving cold drinks or shakes. I recommend to visit this place at least once.

Situated near new market area in between city mart and new empire cinema in humayun lane. First let me tell you what the best part it - Sweet female waitress in pink outfit. Okay move on now to D√©cor it was like big ice cream parlour. Girless and beautiful. Ambience was amazing. Hospitality was really nice. Friendly and helpful staff. Reasonable price on comparison with taste, quality and quantity. Quick service and ravishing presentation. Today I tried their Pehla Nasha which was black Forrest pastry with two scoop of blind love ice cream comes with sparcals. Delicious in taste and ravishing in looks. Must try place. Totally loved it. Personal favorite. Recommended to all Ice cream and pasta lovers.

Visited the place today.
Great ambience and the staff are really good. Well mannered and greeted with etiquette.
The food speciality ranking according to me is..
Must have: ice creams, mega shakes, sundaes
2nd best thing is the continental food. Grilled and fried fish was awesome. 3rd comes in the ranking is chinese. 4th is selective north indian dishes.
Taste of food is good.
Had fun, would visit again.

One of the best place to hang out in this area - always over crowded, hard to grab a seat at one corner. among the food items - the foot long inch meat keema dosa is amazing, which always draws my attention to visit this eatery at an affordable price.

This is beside barista in the newmarket area of Kolkata,esplanade. We four friends stepped into this heritage restaurant mainly to have ice creams. And we were absolutely amazed by the varieties and the quality they delivered. Very nice. 
I would suggest people to order dark temptation, paradise found and pehla nasha. We had also order pepsi with ice cream. All these four were fantastic. The amount they serve is enough and go with the price! Thumbs up for scoop!Go on.

Sorry yo say but this place was one of my fav at aone time and now its so bad . I ordered chicjen nuggets fr the starter and ut turned iut to be smely and was having a bitter taste. We said it to the waiter they took it and said u can order anything else . Then we orderd fush finger whuch was ok . Fr the main course we ordered kashmiri pulao and chicken makhani . Both if them were just horrible . The chashew nuts were burnt and it tasted blunt . There were fruits like papaya ehich was totaly raw in the rice . The chicjen smelled rotten . I complained the asst manager suman . He is another one . Didnt helped us just say sorry and said oiiii billl layo is table ka . Shame shame . Not a way to hold up a businesss .

I went to Scoop a month back. Thanks to Zomato,  who supplied me with a food coupon from this place. And thanks again, as it was a wonderful experience. The place is no doubt cramped up, with large crowd and mixed cacophony of conversations and cutlery. We managed a 2 seater, and ordered for fish fingers followed by a chicken steak and a grilled fish. We also had a mocktail and one ice cream. The quality of fish was absolutely superb, and the preparation did justice to its quality. The ingredients were fresh and retained the right amount of juice in spite of being well cooked. The attendants were very courteous and there was nothing to complain about their hospitality. A minor glitch was that the starter came after the main courses, but the taste more than made up for it. I would definitely consider revisiting this place again.

Scoop.. a famous handout restaurant!
Location -esplanade
Ambeince was good.. followed by loud music 
Staff service was slow.. had to call them thrice to take order.. and the order took quite some time to arrive 
Ordered cold coffee , mix chowmein and chilly chicken .. and asked them to make chilly chkn spicy
Cold coffee was ok.. not nice
Mix Chowmein didn't had quantity to be eaten by 2 ppl.. and chilly chkn was not hot and not spicy at all.. this type of food.. for a good bill of 600 wasn't worth..

Firstly, it's a place from kolkatan dessert legend. Secondly, this is where you go to chill out - literally and metaphorically. This is the ultimate hang out with friends,the more the merrier. Thirdly, there is a wide range of cuisine to choose from - sumptuous sizzlers to sassy south Indian.
My personal favourite is the famous slurpy Cantonese mixed noodles and fish. Their pizzas will put the current international brands to shame with the sizeable portions, generous toppings and fulfilling mouthfuls of cheese. North Indian dishes are great too. Momos are yummy. Every item is palate pleasing.
The place is spacious and the decor is unobnoxiously funky, done up by the proprietress . The setting is inviting for a mega gossip session with friends and family. The place is surprisingly affordable as well, even though it is a part of kolkata's hospitality history. Kids to grannies - there is something for everyone. A spiderman positioned outside on an English park bench has been the photo companion of numerous visitors from India and abroad.
The place has always been a dessert haunt so I am not writing much about the desserts. Remember, it is one of the first sundae-serving parlours in kolkata. So go and scoop some definitely after a hearty meal. This is not a place to visit in a hurry. It is a place to relax and enjoy, gossip and eat.

Tried their woktossed egg and chicken noodles with a crispy chicken( sorry forgot the name). Service was good and behaviour of the staff very good. The food was good, i wont say outstanding but again, i would like to visit again and than be judgemental about the food. May try..you will love it

Location-New market area,Kolkata.

Have crave for freak shakes or icecream fusions?Then scoop is the place to satisfy your desire.Scoop is one of the oldest and legendary restaurant of Kolkata.Few years back it was only known for its sundaes but now this place is like an all rounder cricketer which is also famous for its shakes and food.You will usually find this place crowded and during pujas  you have to wait in cue to reserve a seat in this restaurant.It has two outlets in the city and serves Italian,Chinese,North Indian,Continental and South Indian cuisines.And during festive season they always have a special menu along with regular menu.

Service-The service at this place was extremely fast and reliable.The staff is too cooperative and helpful.Inspite of such a heavy crowd they served us the whole order in 10-12 minutes which was quite impressive.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is quite noisy but the interiors which is mostly in pink colored theme is impressive.It also has a two floored huge seating capicity.

Food-The food at this place is fingerlicking.And only one question was constantly striking our mind and it was"How so cheap?."This place also serves a huge variety in food and now during pujas in their special menu they are serving freak shakes which is served by extremely limited restaurant in kolkata.We had-
1:Masala idly
2:Big mama
3:Chola bhatura 
4:Veg seekh kebab

All the item were great in taste but the presentation of "BIG MAMA"just blew our mind.

Food-4.5/5
Service-5/5
Ambiance-4/5

A visit to this place is highly recommended especially if you are a dessert lover.üòÉüòÉ

Scoop is a pocket friendly restaurant and quality food is served. The ambience of the restaurant is good but not great because its always occupied and located on the busy roads of esplanade. I ordered chef's special veg sizzler. The platter had bread, veggies, paneer, pineapple ,etc. It was nice and tasty. Oreo milkshake was very good. The presentation was nice. My overall experience with this restaurant is good as many times i have visited. During peak time like eid or Durga puja you might have to wait to get a seat.

Been here twice, a good place to relax and chat over. We tried mixed Hakka noodles, chicken machurian, chicken nuggets, cheese masala dhosa, Oreo ice cream and many based on which I am writing my review.
Ambience: 8/10
Quality : 7/10
Service: 6/10
Quantity : 5/10
Price : 4/10
I didn't like their cheese dosa with bitter taste, Oreo ice cream was pricey in comparison to its taste though the dressing was good. The staff serve you late and no where to be seen after being served. Rest of the items tasted good but the quantity of the side dishes are very less with tiny chicken pieces.

The ambience is very sober inside. The service on a busy day was fast even when the waiter told us that it would take longer than usual. The chicken steak, chicken tikka kebab and the chicken sizzler are all really delicious and are a must try. If you have a sweet tooth you can also try out their cakes and ice creams.

Well, how to start this uniquely special review!! Am just so excited. First of all, a big THANK YOU to team Zomato, you people define awesomeness. It was around June and I was busy preparing for my final semester examination. I distinctly remember the day -  I was thoroughly bored and was waiting for something exciting to happen. My phone beeped as I received a notification from Gmail. To my utter surprise the mail was from Zomato! I was asked to give my personal address and phone number. In return they promised to give me a nice surprise! My day was made and I began to anticipate as to what's on store for me! The very next day I received a letter just to find a voucher inside it. Zomato offered me a free meal in Scoop which I needed to avail before 15th September. That was my butterflies in the stomach moment! ;) 

On the very last day that is on 15th September I went to Scoop. Its located on the ground floor of the New empire building at New market, opposite to Wow Momo and Dominos. Blame my superbly hectic schedule for the delay. Initially, I was a bit jittery for I had never ever gone to dine alone. As instructed, I called the restaurant up and confirmed reservation. I was there within 10 minutes of making the call and was greeted by a lady with a very warm smile. Within minutes a young guy approached me with a large menu card and I was literally starving. I ordered JAP CHICKEN, SPAGHETTI WITH MEATBALLS, DARK TEMPTATION AND PEPSI. 

JAP CHICKEN- 8 small pieces of succulent boneless chicken in a unique sauce. The dish was very spicy but not hot! Just the way I like it. 

SPAGHETTI WITH MEATBALLS - this dish was pretty disappointing. While the quantity was impressive the taste was not! It was way too tangy and failed to impress my taste buds. Blame dollops of tomato ketchup for the same. Meatballs were small but spicy. Likeable. This dish needs improvement, but.

DARK TEMPTATION - Ah! This one was a clear winner. Heard a lot about their ice creams and trust me I will go back again exclusively for this. It was a unique concoction of Vanilla ice cream, Chocolate ice cream, chocolate sauce and almond. An absolute delight for all ice cream lovers. I took my own sweet time to relish this delicacy and boy! I was just so content. 

SERVICE - Staffs are amazing and courteous. They are pretty attentive and responsive, which is a bonus! They are also very well trained and are experts in managing crowds. 

OVERALL EXPERIENCE -  Good. Totally Recommended. Oh! I loved the ambience. A tiny fairy land in the heart of an ever busy Esplanade!

When you are in New Market for Pujo marketing, then Scoop is the best place to satisfy your appetite. Hence after successful shopping me and my friends hopped in and ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Manchurian and a Chicken Club Sandwich.
What I really like about this place is their preparations tastes different and to mention not delicious, and they offer a wide range of cuisine - from Chinese, North Indian, South Indian to Continental. Even the quantity is appreciative, I was unable to finish the club sandwich alone. Asked them to parcel it, though they took a charge of 10 Rs, but the parcel box was very cute. The only problem is the talkative crowd and loud music or else a perfect joint for "pet pujo".

It was one pathetic experience. After a tiring day at New market, we were hungry as hell. So wanted to check out this place. 
Overcrowded, loud music. It's so loud that you have to shout to talk to one another. Pathetic service. Over smart and ill mannered staffs. 
Food was good, although a little overpriced. The chicken of club sandwich was giving out a little bit of smell.

Scoop is slowly turning out to be one of my favourite places to eat. It's almost always crowded, so one might have to wait for a while to get a seat. Thankfully, that hasn't happened to me yet (fingers crossed).
The staff is courteous, and service is fast. They offer a wide range of food. My favourites include cream of mushroom soup and spaghetti with meat balls. I also loved their chicken sizzler! Chicken and cheese sandwich was a little dry and also a little expensive for a sandwich! Their quantity is limited - manages to be just about enough for one person.
Decor is pretty cool and hep! I really like their pink lights :)

Scoop is a must visit Restaurant in New Market Area..I have visited there several time during my childhood when I went to New Market with my parents during puja shopping‚Ä¶.I was mainly a good dining place for those people who went New Market for shopping, but after their renovation u can consider it as a dating place also‚Ä¶
Location : It is very easy to find in New Market, located into the bottom floor of New Empire building just beside of WOW! Momo and KFC.
Decoration : After their renovation they added very much Pink in their shop..Very well decorated, big space, clean and no question left for the hygiene level, red colored light is set on roof and the restaurant easily can hold an capacity of 50 people..
Management : Very responsive and very polite too‚Ä¶They help customer to choose the right dish according to their taste.
Food : Well, Scoop serves a large amount of dish of different cuisine. From the South Indian dish to Italian, Mexican they serves all kinda food.They has a huge dish containing menu book which is really makes us difficult to choose what to eat. But after seeing some reviews and guidance on Zomato, we all the following item‚Ä¶..
Creamy Cheese Sauce Pasta (Non veg and Penne) : Well I am not a fan of pasta and all cheesy things, but still I become a fan of there Pasta. In one word it was just mind blowing. Full cheesy and can feel the perfection of the dish, each time you take a spoonful of pasta. The pasta melts into my mouth every time you take a bite. Very much recommended here. You can also try the pasta in Spaghetti variation also.
Spicy Chilly Garlic Noodles with Jap Chicken : In the main course, we ordered this one and it was really a Bulls eye for us. The dish was served in a bowl which looks great. Thin and well fried noodles with 4 mid sized chicken pieces are there in the dish. The noodles was mixed with sufficient amount of well chopped veggies. Chicken pieces were well cooked. The gravy in which the chicken pieces are served was rich spicy but not too hot, which is a really noticeable point. The quantity is sufficient for one persons, overall must try main course here.
Puppy Love : Scoop was and is famous for its legendary ice-cream. When I come early, I had tried Tutty Frutty. So this time want to try something different and ordered this one. Served with two scoop of Strawberry and one scoop of vanilla and cream on top. Gems are putted into the cream, which is really an eye catching. It tastes good but not as good like the Tutty Frutty that I tried last time. Overall good.

In conclusion, it is very obvious noticeable that Scoop has upgrade its quality in huge amount after its renovation. A must try destination at New Market area. Every item is affordable and they have a huge variety of food, All items they served are really made of love and you can surely feel it. Thanks to Zomato for the meal voucher they send to my friend

Restaurant is big with ample seating space with pink theme but the restaurant is very noisy due to its crowd and the loud music which they keep on playing its dam irritating.. 

They had a huge variety in their menu, try to avoid there Sizzlers I tried their chef special veg sizzler which was horrible the vegetable in sizzler was half boiled n no taste & messy 

Prices are on higher side when compared with the food quality.

Went there with my sister..the customer service was disappointing..have to tell three different waiters to clean the table as the first two did not show up..they cleaned the table wet..both of us had ordered chicken steak. It was a disaster too..I do not know why they call it a steak..had chicken steaks before too and it is my favourite dish..tried it from scoop and was a complete shock..its a simple chicken with curry all over the platter..the boiled veggies were not even boiled and was just raw and wet by the curry..the chicken was separated from the curry and tasted like just boiled chicken..long story short, my first visit to scoop wih the chicken streak was a disaster. After ordering and also while waiting for the change after making the payment, we were asked almost by 4 or 5 waiters what are we waiting for..mismanagement.

Just had lunch here coz a friend wanted to come so ,i  dont usually come here bcz i didn't liked the 1st tym I was here,i had pasta and burgers which were very avg.
So coming to this time we're very hungry,so we ordered mutton biriani and ckn tikka masala and an cheese ckn sandwich combo. The biriani was oky the mutton pieces were big but could have been more softer,the quantity of the rice was very low for the price they charge,wtf is a half of and egg doing in biriani,cant you Even give a full one?
Then the ckn tikka masala which was tasty a bit tangy but was good it had four chicken pieces everywhere they give six in plate.

The ckn cheese sandwich was a disaster for its price so bad it was ,they gave some fries with it which were okaay,and the coke was with out any fizz and tasted bland like water have been mixed in it..i saw the place was full today,i don't know how other items are but i not going back there soon ..they should do basic taste checks on the food.

Thanks to the voucher given by Zomato, I got to know about this place. The interiors are mostly pink, with a friendly and caring staff and good food. We ordered a pizza, chola bhatura, veg burger and the chilli garlic noodles with jap chicken. Everything was good. The pizza was thin and simple, with juicy slices of tomatoes and jalapenos. The burger was okay, and the fries they were served with were really crispy. The chola bhatura had a few mistakes. Though the bhatura was perfectly ballooned up and was thick like how it's supposed to be, the chola lacked the necessary spices and was suspended in a lot of oil. But overall it didn't taste so bad. Coming to the chilli garlic noodles and jap chicken, the chicken had an unusual flavour and tasted good. It was cooked perfectly too. The noodles were nice and spicy , so they brought the whole dish together and they were the highlight of the day. For desserts we had this dessert called the puppy love where there were three scoops of ice cream ; vanilla, strawberry and chocolate with sauces and whipped cream. It was really good. I had always thought of Scoop as a dessert parlour and it is true that it should be treated as one. It is a reasonable place and had good food. Definitely going here again.

One of the earliest memories I have of this restaurant is the extremely delicious pan fried momos they used to serve here. I went back recently but was heavily disappointed. The momos were limp and had none of the taste i craved so badly. We also ordered egg fried rice, murgh korma, butter naan and pink affair. It is with a heavy heart that i have realised the food has come to resemble that from a normal wayside restaurant.

Nice place to hang out with friends and loved ones, good out of the box decore and 1 of the oldest places in Newmarket area. But it has nicely adjusted with time.My favorite here is Chicken Lolypop and various ice cream it has to offer. Triple sunday and Banana splits r one off my favorites.. And its better not to hav chicken sticks because mom's chicken stew is much better. The behavior of the staff is really good and makes one feel real homely here...

A sudden craving for ice-cream while passing near by. Such an amazing experience with mesmerizing decor. Ordered kitkat milk shake and paradise found. The shake was served with whipped cream nd a kitkat, a cherry at the top. Presentation is superb, tastes also good. Nd paradise found has two scoops of vanila ice cream nd one scoop of chocolate icecream along with some nuts nd almonds to add the crunch. 
Tax sums upto 20.5% somewhat. Its a nice joint. Loved it.

One fine morning, I rose to an email from Zomato asking me to send my postal address for a gift. Though, it was not my birthday, I was too greedy for a gift and hence gave them the same. After a span of four days, I received a gift coupon for Scoop and that is the time, I made it on my bucket list to visit. However, the actual visit came after many months and well it was worthy.
I called up my best buddy to accompany me and also click few pics of the same to which he happily agreed being a photo bluff. We reached the eatery around seven in the evening and was greeted by a sweet lady who directed us to get seated. Just as we got chatting on what to order, a guy came with plenty of menus in hand and hence was standing in for us to order. We asked him to wait as our order choice would take some time.
Spending some time reading the menu, we ordered for a combo of BBQ Cottage Cheese Sandwich, Chicken Nuggets, French Fries and a Pepsi. The guy took our order and got it delivered in about 10 minutes. While being eagerly seated for food, I observed that the music was rather loud. However, the staff‚Äôs courtesy was one to look after as they are truly gem. Upon arrival the meal was less in quantity than expected. The BBQ was kinda okay but starting from nuggets to drinks all were minimal in quantity and shooed off really fast. To fill in our stomachs we ordered for Indonesian Smoked Noodles which did not taste any good in my mouth. Dejected at it, I ordered for three kinds of ice creams which they took a little while to prepare but it is worth it.
The Creme Brulee with Choco Chips gave nice flavour to one‚Äôs mouth so as the Mango Paluda with Ice Cream. However, the real amazement lies with the Pehla Nasha which contains two scoops of ice creams and a branch of Black Forest Cake. It also have had a firework attached to it which can be lit if anyone wished to. Forgetting our meal, we drooled upon the desert which tasted really good. Thus, we happily concluded our meal and to the itching question as to why the desert section was placed on the first page of the menu.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) Of course you can pay them a visit and be sure to try the desserts.

Qs) Why have I rated them 4.5 stars?
Ans) Normally, in situations like this I offer to rate 4 stars, but, solely the staffs hospitality and warmness made to add up half a star.

Visited this joint a few days ago after having a tiring day roaming in the streets of esplanade.Ambience was good,decor was decent but waiters need to be more attentive.Coming to the food as we had to have something veg we ordered the paneer hot hot pizza and a smoothie.The pizza was not that good and it was not at all spicy(despite it was mentioned too spicy in the menu). Prices are¬† on higher side when compared with the food quality.

Been there quite a few times, love the ambience.
Good is yumm, but according to the price the quantity is very very low. 
I bet a soup cannot be divided to 1/2.
The food quality and tastes are great.
But they should increase their quantity so that atleast one person can have their preferable amount enough!

Scoop is pretty awesome , amazing place to turn your tastebuds active with food and deserts...

Starting with the ambience, it has nice arrangements for couples as well as family.

Decoration and presentation of food is what is appreciable.... 

Really loved this place, the ice cream and the milk shake. 

The ice cream had good amount of nuts and almonds and chocolate sauce, that increased its sweetness and crunchiness. 

The milk shake had good amount of cream over it.

Scoop is a good place to hang out with lots of shopping. One day tried Dhosa which was very good and another day took Chole Bhature which was also good but enough for a single person üòÅ I will recommend this place surely.

Review on 19/02/2017 - We already visited this place at least for 7 times or more. Today ordered the Chicken Kima Dhosa, just awesome and v-day special desserts (check pic. attached).

Scoop is situated at the New Empire cinema hall. Entering the resturant I found the atmoshpere pretty cool and colourful. They had a huge variety in their menu,they serve many kinds of food and some are very unconventional specially the deserts. Food is good and quantity is good as well but they are a little overpriced.Try their Grilled Fish,it tasted really well. Staffs are polite but the service is a bit slow.

recently my taste for south Indian dishes have increased, and hence we ordered steamed idly and masala dosa which was pure bliss after a whole day of shopping near esplanade.
it is situated in new market area, nice ambiance with cheerful music.
it was completely full when we reached there.
being at the center of attraction beside new empire cinema, it always pulls the crowd.
the food is good. service should have been a little faster, but its okay as it was really crowded.
would like to visit it some other time for trying the other dishes!

Have a sweet tooth and in dire need of biting into a pretty looking, icy, creamy dish to beat the heat this summer? Look no further. Scoop is the place where you ought to be. Location: a few minutes walk from Esplanade Metro Station. Scoop is located at the heart of New Market, or if specifically asked New Empire Building. In other and simpler words, take a left from KFC. You‚Äôd find Scoop to your right.

‚ÄúOne of the best options for food around the area.‚Äù

I consider myself a regular client here. Being foreigner I have a very particular taste in the food, not easy to please in this city. The Scoop manage to always deliver delicious food, well prepared and the service is friendly with a really fun ambient. They should improve the cleanliness a little bit, specially in the tables close to the second gate, on the wall side, as little cockroaches were found on my last visit. The staff is friendly but sometimes they are slow and not pay attention to the client, we have to beg for their attention sometimes, plus their system for tables available is a bit off sometimes. Overall I will always go again because the food is good and the price is fair.

Though a bit costly the flavour was indeed worth the price. What more I found was that it not only served ice cream but solid food as well! Perfect lunch could be done here. Booking a table won't be that bad as the place remains crowded for most of the time!

Scoop Eat n Run is undoubtedly my favorite place and I go there very frequently. It's more like my kind of place.

Ambient : Nothing fancy about the place it's very simple and crafted beautifully keeping youths in mind. Pink color plays the major role here and even staffs dress color is pink may be it's owner's favorite color. :p Nonetheless you will like this place cos it's nice. Plenty of place to sit however I am yet to try out the seating arrangements upstairs which I believe was operational earlier but not anymore.

Staffs : The great thing about this place is the friendly staffs who always welcomes you with a smile and since I am very frequent I know some of them quite well now. Sanju, Sangita and Suman this 3 in particular are the most friendliest guys over here and they make you like this place even more with their commendable service.

Menu with a twist : Menu is huge and you get plenty of items from sandwich to biryani all available here. And one biggest plus point of this place is the experiment they do with new dishes which are more like seasonal special menu which changes every 3 months and I love that alot.

Pricing : Well pricing is decent and nothing to complain about. On a average for me everytime I go with my girlfriend the bill is around 400-700 which according to me is very reasonable as you get to eat alot too.

My favorite : Pop Chicken is a must try and you simply cannot miss that. Then Penne Arabiata Pasta with red sauce and chicken. French fries here great too but now my girlfriend won't let me eat that :( and like that there's plenty of good dishes which you gotta try yourself.

I highly recommend this place to everyone and their Special seasonal menu is a must try. Currently it's mango season so do try out their Mango Glory, Mango Firni, Aam Candy and Eggs-quse-me if you get.

Themed restaurant in the middle of new market. The crowd and hustle bustle at this place makes the environment electric. 
A long time favourite of mine, the tag line suits this place perfect- Eat and run.
The ambience is very nice and the place is really tastefully decorated with nice lights. I have a little problem with the music though.
Food here is decent and will taste good most of the times. Fish fingers are really nice and so are their special fishme and chicken wings. The chicken steak was not really as good but overall this place does serve you some lip smacking food.
Pricing is under budget and shall not burn a hole in your pocket.
Next time? Definitely.

Well after visiting this place a couple of times all i can say that this place has lived up to my expectations. With its extensive customer friendly services and wallet friendly prices it has been able to grab the attention of the potential shopaholics in the new market area and esplanade . Some combo ,continental dishes and some icecream such as oreo shake mango delight will make your tummy happy nd satisfied
The ambience is good 
keep it up Scoop New Empire

Pretty looking place located at New Market, this is one those places you go after shopping around in the busy shopping destination. The ambiance is really nice which draws the crowd predominantly. The service however could be much better. Among the food...I've tried the cold coffee with ice cream, pasta, Jap chicken and chilli garlic noodles. The food is quite good if only it would arrive at the table within a formidable time. That apart this place has been one of the most happening places for the youth for quite sometime and continues to be the same. üòä

A very good place to be when you're too hungry after shopping your wallets off,  at New Market. The free Wifi is an added plus point. The desserts are really good,  but the main course is quite expensive compared to the quantity they serve. Service and ambience is great.

I was on my first date with a pretty young lady and I was really thoughtful of the day. Scoop was really caring to the needs! It had a fantastic ambience. The food was mouthful for both of us! The best thing was an ice-cream "Pehela Nasha" (Suits the name üòâ); it made our day jubilant!
Thanks Scoop!

A good multi cuisine restaurant. First noticeable thing is the ambiance and the attractive colour pellet.  Most of the residents as well as visitors to the city of joy visit new market and a majority of them find this place. The food here is decent. I specially like the sizzler offerings. I have tried the biriyani and some Chinese as well, which are decent. The desserts however are excellent. One can come here only for the variety of ice creams and desserts. The staff are polite. The price is also acceptable. Al together, anyone visiting new market, this is one of the better places to have food there

Had gone to New Market for some work. Was lunch time, so saw this restaurant. Dropped by to check it out. As the pictures suggest, very attractive interiors! Was given a seat immediately! Everything was going alright as of now. Water was served in stainless steel glass, which I liked. 

Had ordered ‚Ä¢ Tango ( special dish ) consisting of tandoor chicken and dhaniya rice ! 

                      ‚Ä¢ Veg rice with chilly fish !

Asked for Lassi, but was informed by Mr. Suman that it's no more available. Fine, understandable.

Now, it was over 20 minutes, none of the food items was on the table. So I asked Mr. Shounak - the young man serving us, about the food. He was on the way and from the other end another female staff was bringing my food. She kept the food on the table, since there were already cutlery on the table, I took the extra ones in my hand to give it back. The lady almost snatched it from my hands. Wow ! Suddenly I looked around to make me realise that I am not sitting in a road side dhaba, but was surprised to feel the reality with the behaviour of this female staff. 

The rice was bloody cold and the chicken had lost its softness and was cold too ! Informed Mr. Shounak about this, to my surprise even he said the same thing which I was thinking, the cold tasteless dhaniya rice was heated in microwave and served. It was on special today. To the COOK ( and not chef ) - LEAVE THE JOB IF You CANT COOK, BUT DONT SERVE COLD MICROWAVED FOOD. Bloody hell. Was surprised with the audacity. 

Now, till now my partner didn't receive her food, and my food was getting colder since I was waiting for her food to come, so that we can have lunch together. 

To the waiters - Please get your basics straight. It's important to have the meal on the table at the same time when people are eating together, and not wait for another 10 minutes for the other dish to land on the table. Job of a waiter is not to just pick up food and dump it on the table, it's all about looking after the guests who come to your restaurant to have a good meal, and pay the price for it. 

Please go to a good place and dine, you will understand the difference between your service and theirs !

Iv visited Scoop many times since childhood, but yesterday was my first visit in the last couple of years... The decor is still the same, colourful and vibrant. What immediately caught my eye was the revamped menu.. The menu card was attractive as were the dishes being displayed on the wall-mounted display boards.. Moreover they had a very innovative offer going on - special discounts for each day of the week - provided u wore black&white clothes or u had an elderly/kid in your group etc... Really really impressive...  A particular lampshade also caught my eye with the handle being made of inverted cups and kettles...
 Our group consisted of quite a few vegetarians, and so we ordered a motley of dishes - the best of both worlds.. Among veg, we ordered  
Spaghetti in Tomato Basil sauce and Veg Au Gratin - both were yummmy... The Chef's Veg Special Sizzler looked delectable but wasnt suited for my non-veg 'steak-y' palate..  I ordered a Penne in Cheese Spinach Sauce, Dry Chilli Chicken and Chicken Cheese Sandwich - all were tasty.... Despite being full, we also ordered 3 milkshakes as they looked absolutely mouthwatering in their picture in the menu - Oreo Cookie, Black Forest, Kitkat.... Unfortunately, apart from the Black forest one, (which had generous amounts of blended pastry crumbs) the others were a tad too dilute..
The bill was around 2.3 k..  
Scoop is one of those old joints which still remains a favourite among us Kolkattans.. overall a good place to hang out with friends over snacks.. and a welcome break from the new age pricey hookah/sports/lounge cafes... This one is just a Cafe !!! And a great 1 !!

I was there yesterday with my wife .In my college life I was a regular visitor here. So thought to visit this place after approx 5 year. But I must say I am disappointed. Staffs are not cordial. In face I must say they are very arrogant and unnecessarily arguing with customer. A family just sitting before us ordered something and just 5 minutes later they said to change it to other dish , the waiter ( white dressed lady , I think she is leading the team) was very rough to talk to them.She said " for you we have cancelled other's order , you have no right to cancel it" she then asked her fellow waiter why this kind of people comes here , hey cancel the order.What the hell !!! the lady is very arrogant. Now it turns for my table , we ordered our items and then asked for normal water .But during serving the order she started to serve cold mineral water.I reminded her that I said normal water. She started arguing . I said calmly to do as per my order.To my utter surprise they did not serve the water. NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE .IT WILL JUST SPOIL THE MOOD.

Today i went there in the afternoon for the first time and was quite satisfied and happy.The ambience is good, hygienic and well decorated with vast seating area. Service was good and fast.We tried super thin crust pizza,steamed chicken momos, meatball spaghetti,grilled fish, chicken a la king.The pizza was sumptous in taste with crunchy and perfect thin crust, with momos we had a hot and sweet chili sauce which just was a burst of flavour on tongue, meatball spaghetti had great flavours in meatballs and grilled fish and steak were the standouts.But the grilled fish to me although had great flavours but the serve was too little and not at all value of money,the lemon rice with it had a strange tasteAll in all great flavours,value for money,definitely worth a try !!!

Thanks to zomato for providing me this amazing voucher which I used to take my mother out for lunch at scoop. The restaurant is well decorated & the is really nice always wearing a smile.
We ordered a chicken keema dhosa, one continental dish containing lots of chicken in white sauce with butter rice & parsley. They were served withing 20mins and the quantity was more than enough for one person. The quality & taste were good too. For dessert we ordered one tutty fruity & one 'Love & Disaster' (cool name by the way). The desserts are totally out of this world, I simply relished every bite of it. Will visit again soon.

This age old restaurant has been around for i don't know how long, I used to visit this place with my parents when I was a kid‚Äì we would mostly eat their sizzlers and ice cream sundaes. And boy their sizzlers were good, if my memory serves me right. 

Recently visited the place after what I believe is a millennium, to be welcomed at a whole new and different version of scoop from what i can remember. 
Enough of the nostalgia, let's jump to business. 
Food. I would say i was happy with it, with whatever i ordered but nit something that would draw me back to the place. Ordered the classic‚Äì chicken sizzler, which I'd say is an above average steaked sizzler, the sauce is rather subtle and nice, though i expected the sizzler to sizzle for a while I don't remember hearing it sizzle as it arrived at the table. 
Apart from that we ordered some crispy chicken pepper which were pretty good and the drinks that accompanied our food were decent.

What I'd really recommend this place for is the staff‚Äì one of the most well behaved and friendly restaurant staff I've come across in my recent visits to restaurants in general. They even offered a complimentary piece of cake which wasn't on the menu, and was currently being experimented‚Äì as in the ingredients and how it ought to be made. And to be honest, the cake was indeed really good. 
And if you're the kind of person who likes to be on the phone whilst eating sumptuous food, this place offers free Wi-Fi, so a brownie point for that! 

Overall I'd say the place hasn't retained it's 90's charm with the all new jazzy colourful decor but they certainly have a good team and decent food to keep you interested. I think I'd visit them for the ice creams again. Cheers!

Worthless! They are only carrying their past glory with them. Only thing that you may try is their ice cream. Very poor service. You have to remind the staff 2 or 3 times regurding your order. Moreover, the item which is being display in their tv screen or in the menu card, may not available. And after all this you have to wait for long time.

I am writing on Zomato for a long now. Being an expertise I don't know how I missed this beautiful place at New Market. Well Zomato noticed that & gave a surprise treat by providing me a voucher of One of The Legendary Desert Parlour of Kolkata, Yes its Scoop.

First of all, I want to thank Zomato from my bottom of heart for giving all the food lovers such an opportunity to share their experiences in a decent way that not just help other foodies also creats its own world & community.

This message is for all the new beginner foodies on Zomato. Zomato has the most largest database of Restaurants in the World. That is because of all the foodies like us posting photos, menus, reviews & sharing our experiences with them. 

Well all of this things not just making their database strong day by day, now it also has became a hobby in our life. Zomato respects all of this efforts silently & they doesn't hesitate to love you back for all your efforts. And here's the proof, My dinner in Scoop was provided by Zomato.

Now lets talk about the restaurant. Scoop is quite popular between college goers young stars and love birds. Why not it should be, they provide some excellent numbers of desert options while they offer a beautiful dining too.

Location : Scoop is located on the ground floor of New Empire Building at New Market. Its just between  KFC and Domino's. This building is quite famous hence the restaurant is quite easy to find.

Decorations : Like all the other reviews says this one is a pink world. But I would like to call it a colorful world. Scoop is very very well decorated with funky colors that just punches your eyes & not only that those colors matches with their colorful deserts on your table. Colourful walls, Colourful chair tables, Wall posters, Led display panels showing their special menu items, Led strip lights everywhere, all of this not just creates a funky theme, it also makes a Romantic ambience. Scoop's ambience is perfect if you are thinking about to take your girl out for a romantic dinner. Unfortunately no date for me this time :p.

Staffs & Management : There were waiter & waitresses in different dress codes. They were well trained, well behaved & well mannered. From the time we entered into the restaurant to guide us through the menu they helped us really well in every angle. After placing the order they took a very short time to serve us. They have also done a pro degree on garnishing foods & that was totally seen in every item they served us. After a dish or two they even asked for our feedback about the food was good or not. They pleased us very very well. Excellent Service, A big point goes for them.

Foods : Scoop covers a large number of cuisines from  Italian, Chinese, South Indian, North Indian, Deserts & of course Ice Cream. So their menu card seems like a food dictionary too. Their colourful menu card is so big that a pro foodie can fall in little confusion. After seeing a number of reviews I came to a conclusion what should we order.

Creamy Cheese Sauce Penne Pasta with a combination of Cheese, Butter & Cream : 
The flavour of cheese covered up the place as soon it came to our table. In a single glace I observed that it was made with real perfection & love. It was served really well. The first bite of this just melts into the mouth. The dish tasted extremely cheesy & creamy. Very light spices were used but it holds up the taste really long. In simple words, It was such delicious that words can't explain. Creamy Cheese Sauce Pasta was very much preferable for me & an absolute recommended over here.

Spicy Chilly Garlic Noodles with Jap Chicken :
Wow, to the way it was served in a bowl. It looked like Chinese heaven. Noodles were very thin & very well fried. There was kind of mixed flavour of smoke & tangy sauce in the noodles, that was mixed with nicely sliced vegetables. The best part was yet to come. The chicken pieces tasted like heaven. A juicy cheesy flavor was coming from inside & that just melted into the mouth. The dish was very spicy but fortunately not very hot, just absolute likeable. By the way the quantity was average & there were 4 pieces of chicken in it, that would suite 1 person perfectly. Overall the dish tasted mind blowing & another must have over here.

Puppy Love : Now coming to their legendary ice cream. I was bit confused before ordering, between Eye Candy & Puppy Love. Then I thought Eye Candy is good for groups cause it comes with 5 scoops of ice cream. So I shatteled down with Puppy Love that came with 2 scoops of Strawberry & 1 scoop of vanilla served in a glass with full of cream on top. Oh, did I mentioned that colourful Cadbury Gems & choco chips were on it. Well my expectation for this was gone really high that time. Unfortunately it tasted very very simple. The ice cream felt good & all the common taste of other things that was used to make it were visible. It was perfect for two people to have. However it didn't surprised me with its taste that much. It wasn't bad either but an improvement can be done highly on it.

Pricing : Our bill for 2 with all the above mentioned items were Rs. 635. For me Zomato paid it all, So thanks to Zomato once again. Coming to the pricing segment I think for all the beautiful ambience, excellent service & delicious foods their prices are decently balanced that satisfies your pocket well.

Conclusion : Scoop is a restaurant that has been extracted from the Rainbow. Its a lovely colorful world inside, that is perfect to feel with your loved once over some sweet dishes made by them. Its an absolute recommend place from my side, even I am planing to visit this in near future too.

First of all i must say scoop is quite colourfull resto in new market. Had been there more than once. Have tried chinese food. Mostly i order the chicken cheese pasta which is served in a frying pan which is quite unique. The pasta taste and quantity is good. Also tried some ice cream mocktails over there. The garnish is very beautiful. But one con is that most of the items in the menu is not available. Otherwise ambience and staff behaviour is good.

Scoop brings back many of the childhood memories. Shopping at the New Market was always followed by eating at Scoop. And if it gets to be the Puja Season, you would definitely have to wait for a long time in the queue. Still, it was beautiful. I used to have the creamy pasta and a large sundae of chocolate ice cream with all the toppings and sauces. Haven't been to this place recently. Have plans to visit soon.
---UPDATE---
As planned, executed that way. I had come to Scoop for desserts after a long long time on the day of Eid after a titsy bitsy kinda lunch with my friend

I have been frequenting this place for over a decade. Whenever I accompany my mom to carry out her shopping from New Market it has been a ritual to grab a bite at Scoop. I make it a point to have the Chicken Steak Sizzler every time. The pizzas and burgers are also quite tasty and my mom raves about their masala dosa which is also pretty delicious. It is a place very close to my heart and it is highly recommended if you are looking for a quick bite after a tiring day, holding shopping bags.

It is in new market area near citi mart.  Ambiance is nice and interior is also good.
Service is little bit slow, billing process is also slow. 
I ordered cheeze dosa and it was good in taste,  since that day I was full, could not try other items, but would definitely try soon. Price is reasonable. 
Would recommend if you are in the area and want to spend some time with friends and family.

Have a weet tooth and in dire need of biting into a pretty looking, icy, creamy dish to beat the heat this summer? Look no further. Scoop is the place where you ought to be.

Location: a few minutes walk from Esplanade Metro Station. Scoop is located at the heart of New Market, or if specifically asked New Empire Building. In other and simpler words, take a left from KFC. You'd find Scoop to your right.

Food: Scoop is a wonderland for all the people out there who likes pretty places and pretty desserts. Known for both its decorative and innovative ways of plating sweet stuff, this place is a must go!

Creamy Pasta with Chicken: perfectly cooked penne smothered in delicious white sauce and seasoned delightfully right. I have never had as good as a white sauce pasta as this before. The meat was tender and soft and the cream went well with it. (5/5)

Chicken Steak: pieces of chicken breast accompanied with saut√©ed mushroom smeared in thick sauce. Frankly, there are better chicken steaks out there. The flavours did not pan out for me. The Steak was served with grilled vegetables on the side which included carrots, cauliflower, broccoli and beans, which were a bit too plain. (2.5/5)

Eye Candy: the star among the three course meal has to be Eye Candy. Five scoops of ice creams served in cones with a side of cotton candy. This dessert deserves a round of applause because of its quite unique presentation in a rather limited budget. The menu allows you to pick your favourite ice creams among an unusually large stretch of flavours. Few of the flavours that they features are: Tutty Fruity: a combination of fruits in an ice cream (3.5/5); Chocolate Chips- creamy chocolatey delight with sudden surprises of chocolate chips in bites [con: there are much better chocolate ice creams out there than this] (2.5/5); Strawberry Cheese Cake- strawberry flavoured ice cream with cheese cake [con: cheese cake flavour was missing] (3/5); Cr√®me br√ªl√©e- sweet creamy ice cream with a hint of strawberry (4/5).

Management: this pink, pretty place comes with a team of fast working, courteous staff. Service here is a fast. Cleanliness is spot on. Full marks on the decor. You running a tight budget wouldn't stop you from grabbing a bite here, because the place is very pocket friendly too.

A nice place to spend some good time with some good friends. Food is ok, not of a very high quality.. I was rather disappointed with my chicken sizzler. I guess its alwz safe to order and enjoy ice cream scoops only, in Scoop..
Some cute and pink servings have been newly added in scoop's menu. I loved the presentations of the servings.

Its been many many years, since I had visited them last, so this review of mine is definitely not going to reflect on their current state.

Perhaps, the most popular places in and around Explanade region, Scoop has been an obvious destination for youngsters since the past couple of years, whenever it meant having quality food accompanied with some chit-chat. The first time I had dropped in here was some 12 years back. I loved the ambiance. A bit hard to describe by as I haven't been there in years, but I can easily recollect the bright lightnings and the friendly staffs.

I began to be a regular here after the bar at Lighthouse had shut down. Their Thai Section was shifted to Scoop and I have no shame in admitting, that I was a die-hard fan of their Chicken in Oyster Sauce. One or two common staffs, who were also transfer ed to Scoop, I had absolutely no issues in communicating with them. It was even later, that the Thai Section again got shifted to a brand new restaurant just beside Scoop, which was perhaps known as the 'The Oriental Plaza'.

Apart from the Thai Offerings, I loved their drinks. Good shakes (As I can recollect) was one of my obvious choice to quench the thirst. Their food however was mostly inconsistent. I remember of having visited them sometime int he year 2009 or 2010, and me and my friend were served with two horrible tasting sizzlers. We had to desert out food in the midway, and instead go to Aminia to complete our meal.

Not that I am complaining, perhaps things have changed for good in the past couple of years. May be it hasn't. But Scoop will always remain special to me, for the ¬†sheer memories I have had at this place, with my friends. Hope to find the familar face of the captain from Lighthouse Bar once again. :-)

Scoop,  a perfect place as a ice cream parlour, because they have lots of variety of icecrems,  

I love their truti fruity icecrem and dark passion,  yummy 

About the staff,  I think they need to train them more because service Is very slow. Nice decoration.

Among the hustle bustle of new market lies this restaurant which to doesn't rest in peace!! The restaurant is crowded almost all the time and you have to almost dive to grab a seat! But once you get in u r in for a treat! The menu is the show stopper and has wide range of food ..do give it a try.. Low rating owing to ambience and the songs give u a headache

Whenever I go to New Market I makr it a point to visit this place as I am a huge foodie.I love this place coz it is a multi cuisine restaurant and serves all types of dishes. The prices are reasonable,good service and hospitality and food quality is extraordinary. The thing I like the most is their numerous variety of ice creams...its just yummy...and all ice creams contain fried cashews ,chocolate saue and chocolate stick.The main attraction for me to go there is their mouth watering ice creams and the way they present their dishes is just fabulous..

Well nowadays you have everything in your city right !! The European delicacies, the Mexican , Spanish , more than countable mughlai and Chinese outlets . But amongst all these there lies some very few joints which have its on charm and no matter wherever you go you won't find it anywhere else .

So, you are with your loved one and hopping around new market and suddenly feel hungry "Scoop" should be one of your top destinations . I love the seating arrangements where the tables are located in various nook and corners of the restaurant as a result of which you can always enjoy a cosy time with your beloved . You will get a mix culture of people coming in since it is located at the heart of new market . 

Those arijit Singh and ankit tiwari songs will transform you to a hopelessly romantic type of a mood if you are into that sort of stuff . You won't get into fine dining almost everyday in your curriculum. 

Location :- Very easy to find . Ground floor of New empire of cinema hall.

Food :- Now the most important part , scoop offers a variety of choices starting from sizzlers, fish fry , burgers , sandwiches , milkshakes , coolers ,ice teas and also Chinese and mughlai . You name it and they will serve it .  We although decided to have the following : -

--------------------------------------------------------------
        STARTERS
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Fish Fingers ( 5 / 5 ) :- Although this is pocket pinch restaurant I wondered how can a plate of fish finger cost 194 rupees but I was too hungry and craving for some fingers so I ordered it and it simply won my heart . I have attached the pic so you can clearly see how they are served . Served in a basket which is on a top of wooden plate . And they had added some mayonese and potato chips as add ons . I promise you those were some delightfully tasty fish fingers . There were 8 pieces which we munched upon delightfully .
 
2. Eggs Nest ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- This was more of an experimental try . These are basically poached eggs served as sunny side up upon some deep fried potatoes . The fried potatoes " jhuri alu bhaja " looks like a birds nest and the egg yolk upon in looks absolutely yummy . The only problem with this dish was it was less salty . If you put a little salt on it , trust me these are 2 little pieces of delicious egg bombs .

--------------------------------------------------------------
  MAIN COURSE
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Chicken cheese burger (4 / 5 ) :- With true honesty this was a nice burger . Not over exaggerated the party was yummy and had adequate cheese to make it a super cheesy experience with every bite . To me the burger was a winner .

-------------------------------------------------------------
 DESERTS & COOLERS
-------------------------------------------------------------
 
1. Vanilla milk shake ( 5 / 5 ) :- You can't say you ever had a bad vanilla milk shake because it is one hell of a combo . Served in a quite big proportion it was enough for 2 of us to quench our thirst especially when we were having the burger . 

2. Miss sparkle bunny vanilla ice cream ( 10 / 5 ) :- Yes that's how I will rate this dish . Firstly , the presentation was beautiful . The ice cream was served in a wine glass with plastic flowers beneath it . It was once again on top of a wooden plate . And accompanying it was a toy bunny which on shaking it glowed . It was so childish that we laughed the hell out of it . The ice cream was yummy , vanilla was mixed with coconut and served with bourbon biscuits . I will never forget this dish . It's a bummer that they took away the bunny in the end as it was only for show . But by then, it had already won our hearts .

Service : - The staff is really very attentive and they will help you with everything you need .

 Sometimes you have to adjust urself with the places you are visiting , once again I am stressing this that you won't find a fine dining experience everywhere . But in scoop you will get your wishes fulfilled . Do try their snacks as they are not popular for their main dishes . We had a wonderful time today and whenever I am in new market , scoop will always be in my mind .

I have been a reagular here literally since my childhood. One of its main attractions is its location. Being located in new market one can never find this place empty, be it afternoon or evening. The various desserts and ice cream sundaes are definitely the highlights here. I cant pick any favorites because they are all equally heavenly! The red sauce pasta(chicken) is a dish I have each time I go here. The french fries here are one of the best I have had. All in all this place provides a welcome respite from the heat outside and allows one to gather energy for another round of shopping!

Paid a visit to the once iconic hangout in New Market area after a long gap. Scoop has changed a lot since. The menu now offers Continental, Chinese, South Indian & Mughlai dishes. And of course their signature & yummy Sundaes are there too. They have also come up with innovative ideas of presenting the Sundaes which I liked too much. Really felt nostalgic after visiting.

I've visited this place many times. Their Chinese section couldn't satisfy me. But Italian section was better than Chinese. Staffs are gentle but one of the staffs behaved badly with me. We ordered one more plate kabab after finishing the main course and also ordered for the desert. She served the ice-cream before and when I questioned her she said "you've not mentioned what do you want first kabab or ice-cream." Okay whatever the experience was, their ice-cream was really excellent.

A nice place in the hustle and bustle of new market. You get to choose from a lot of options from south indian, chinese, thai and so on. The ambience is nice and cozy.
------
We ordered the pasta with tomatoes pesto basil... it was really nice but a bit oily. The vegetables could have been a bit more fresh...and the dish could have been a bit light.
The fish sizzler was just too good. The rice was light and fluffy with just enough flavours to pack a punch and the fish was fresh and tangy. The french fries were crispy but the hero of the dish is the mayo dip.
-----
The sundaes and ice creams are to die for. Do give this place a try. The staff was helpful too.
Cheers!

Scoop had become my grandmother's and mine personal favourite for around 6 months I guess. The place is really  pretty and is always full! We used to come here quite often and I must say, they serve some really good food. I have had lots of dishes here. 
Flaming Chilly Prawns were my favourite. Mind you, the batter on the prawns is a bit soggy but I somehow like soggy batters! So Yay!
The Chicken Fried Rice which has egg as well is very very tasty. It's got minimal ingredients but it still tastes great! The Sweet corn soup is disappointing as the balance is missing more often than not. On the other hand the cream of spinach soup is really tasty! 
I had once ordered grilled fish as well, and may I say... Wow! The fish was really amazing! Their south indian food is quite popular but I am not very keen about south indian food, so never tried it. The desserts are also really nice. They aren't nearly the best in the city but they are always pleasing. 
Now the reason this "was" my favourite restaurant is because recently the quality seemed to have dropped and as a result the price that earlier seemed fine to pay suddenly started to pinch. I am saying this on the back of multiple "average" visits of late and not just one day. Besides, any place can have a bad day! Buy here, I am positive there's a quality drop. 
I know the capability of this place very well and I hope to see it improve and reestablish its earlier set high standards! Good Luck! And yes, you must give this restaurant atleast one shot! Happy Dining!!

Environment is good, though it is crowed enough every time :)
Now coming to food.
We tried chicken kima dosa.. It was pretty good.
Newly introduced items egg nest was superb, eggcuse me could hv been btr - it was a bit salty, eggie moo - a little disappointed - it was greatly decorated but very sweet in taste

In drink we had a lassi.. It that was just superb.
Now coming to desert we had - miss saprkle bunny, taste is like normal ice crm but the decoration will give u the birthday celebration flavour, if u r not sure what is it at least go through the photos...

A very good experience... U should try :)

Cost: 1000 for two

Ha ha ha ha!

First,we have to wait for near about 1 hour.
Then we have to wait another 30 mins to get the "menu card".

Dn waited for another 40mins after ordering.

We thought may be they took too care about their food,so the took time too much.

But the taste of food!

I don't wanna write more.

I wanna give you "negative" marks...2 for decoration.

Please try keep fast serving and try to make better dishes!

Price quality is much more than food quality!

The perfect pocket friendly place to have dessert in Kolkata. Located at New market area, just beside KFC and dominos and the new empire cinema hall, it operates in one of the most busy places in Kolkata. Me and my friended visited and ordered French fries with mayo sauce (their speciality), chicken cheese rice, fresh lime soda and cold coffee with ice cream. Each was better than the other and especially the chicken cheese rice turned out to be a real surprise. I will definitely recommend all of you to visit this place. Here's hoping for more surprises on our next visit!

Located in New Market.
The ambience is good and seating arrangements are comfortable.
Went on an evening to taste a scoop of 'Scoop'. Had Sandwich and Cold Coffee.
Sandwich was satisfactory while Cold Coffee left me with disappointment.
(I've a great affinity for Cold Coffee so )
It was so watery and didn't have thick layer of milk. Adding to it, they had put ice cubes which did worse to it.

However after lodging a complaint to the waiter, they changed it. The next time when they served was satisfactory again !
High time they keep a check on this.
But but !! The staffs are courteous.

Hoping to have a nice time on my next visit. :) Cheers !

Looking for a decent place to eat in the hawker infested new market area,this might be an option.Really peppy interiors ,splashed with all sorts of colours and lights.However not so untouched by the chaos and clutter of the place its located in.Every type of food is available here-continental ,Italian,south and north indian,specialising in nothing yet nothing special about anything.
  Decent place if you are in a group and every one prefers different foods and nothing specific,a restaurant to unite all.However Its a good place if you are craving milkshakes and ice creams.Lots of varieties.

Been there quite a few times and every time I had a different experience. But the last time was indeed very terrible and I literally have stopped visiting Scoop! I had gone with my mom and sister in the afternoon and we had ordered Chinese. The staff were not at all willing to help to serve and I had to call thrice for the waiter before I helped myself. The food wasn't up to the standard; the Chicken Sizzler was nice but the Jap Chicken was very oily. Hopefully in the near future if I ever visit Scoop, I hope I don't face such problems.

They offer a wide variety of options including chinese, north Indian dishes, sizzlers and a number of ice creams and drinks. Visited this place a number of times. Tried biryani with chilly chicken combo, dosa, chicken ala king sizzler, kebabs. The quantity is plenty considering the price and the quality is good. The service is fast and the staff are friendly as well. You can also get good discounts in happy hours or by liking their Facebook pages. Overall, 4/5.

Speaking of the food, whatever I've ordered from the vast menu these guys offer, it has been pretty decent. Although, it would've been preferable if the costing was a bit pocket friendly. 
Please do not order the biriyani or the French fries if you do not want an oil overload. Also the French fries do not come with the promised mayo dip always. I ordered the ramen on my last visit and to my woes, not only did it taste like wai wai, it was too salty for the palette. Sandwiches are good. 
The decor is a bit too loud for my taste but it screams youthfulness. Also the staff is pretty friendly, although it would be nicer if they could pay more attention on the tables to see if their guests need anything further or if it's time for billing.
Overall a decent place to hang out with your friends and yes I will be going back to check out what's new.

It's a best youth nd family restro in Kolkata. We'll give 9.1 out of 10. As per our thinking it is a A class restro not only for the food but for the hosting also, and specially our dear frnd @Shankho for taking care of us so heartily. Our fixed item is fried chicken in Thai style specially tossed in sauce only for us. We are just mad about it.
 Stay Unique nd serve better.

Went to this amazing restaurant today at a friend's suggestion. It's a multi cuisine restaurant and has huge variety of foods to offer. Be it Chinese, north Indian, south Indian or continental snacks.
The menu has so much to offer that it took us a while to decide what to have exactly. Finally we zeroed on chicken ala king and mixed platter sizzler. Since both of them were continental dishes we first tried out chicken ala king. Oh my, the creamy cheese and shredded chicken combined with the parsley rice just melts in your mouth. Thoroughly enjoyed having it. The mixed platter sizzler had chicken, fish,prawn, lots of veggies and rice. Very well cooked and full marks for a unique garnishing.
The staff was really very cordial and the ambience was equally good.
Will visit yet again to try out their other cuisines.
Keep up the good work Scoop!!

This outlet of Scoop is situated at ground floor of new empire building in New Market near Esplanade Metro station...
After shopping at Big Bazar ,when our tummies were starving for foods we decided to go to Scoop... Watching the rating 3.2 of Scoop in zomato I didn't have so much expectations from the place...
but after having the lunch ...let me tell you that I don't believe the rating should be so low it should be minimum 4 ...
The Decoration and the Ambience is very much attractive and beautifully organised ... Food was also good ...
They have lots of items from multi cuisine... but the best part about them is the desserts specially the icecreams...
We had
German Potato Salad
Spanish Omlette with Potatoes
Quick Gun Murg Gun Pizza
Sizzler
Pehla Nasha with sparkle
Confused Identity
Hot Dark Chocolate
Now the names of every dishes there were very funny and attractive...
German potato salad was salads and potatoes mixed in mayonnaise and the plate was placed on ice cubes ... it was scrumptious...
Spanish omelette was mix of one thick omelette, two sandwiches, mushrooms and veggies... tastes good...
Pizza was very crunchy and tasty...and sizzler was also spicy and good in taste...
Confused Identity was a cooler of lichi and apple juice with pepsi on top... and was lip smacking...
Hot Dark Chocolate was served as hot liquid chocolate and cream and Marsmellows on top...
Pehla nasha was a dessert with two scoops of icecreams and one pastry cake...but how they served it, was amazing... it's written there Pehla nasha will come with a sparkle and it actually did...they lit up a sparkle cracker beside the dish... And it looked attractive... and  literally drew everyone's attention over the sparkle...
The service was also good... Even now there are some offers running...
Just for liking 2 pages in facebook (Scoop and Spice) we had 10% discount on our bill...
Overall it was a good experience having lunch over there...
#A Must Try for their winter special desserts...

I have been to this place on numerous occasions. Good desserts and ample starters are the main attractions. They whip up themes on Valentine's days!

Food: Its quite tasty but quantity feels less for its price especially for crispy chili baby corn or Greek salad that I had there. The cold coffee frappe was average.

Service: Service was swift but difficult to get attention of the waiters n waitresses, seemed a bit under staffed for the large floor space they enjoy.

Ambiance. Pretty good usually. On weekends its pretty crowded ¬†so it might be difficult to get a seat. But there's lot of space to wait around!

Verdict: I would recommend this place for different types of dosas, starters, and awesome desserts n sizzlers.

The restaurant serves a good combination and variation of Indian, Chinese, English, Ice cream, Desserts. It is situated just in the New Market area, in a narrow lane but the food served was of good quality and the price was ok(though the quantity for some of the food was not too much).
When searching for a hygienic eating destination with a comfortable environment in the new market area, we can definitely visit this place.

Scoop is situated next to citi mart in esplanade and its in the same building of new empire cinema hall which is pretty easy to locate , now let's talk about the food you get here to my surprise this place has a lot of options in terms of ice creams , desserts and foods .
So let's talk about the fast food that I ate it like sandwiches which was accompanied with some wafers which were fresh enough and good on terms of quantity and quality and then after that i decided to try some ice creams so I chose the sundae and it was quite huge to complete but I did enjoy the treatment as it did not take much time for preparation and at the end I was a happy man walking out .

I would like to differ with the rating of 3.2 on Zomato!
The location is fantastic, bang in the middle of new market in the street food (momore, tea junction) alley.
I had visited on 5th Jan. They had a beautiful and very tempting Christmas special menu! U r not hungry if you look at the menu display outside and still don't step in. 
We ordered the Hot Nutella, Hot Pinky, Granz Trotter soup and the lassi.
The hot nutella was delicious ! Too much calories but worth it. The only issue was the Trotter soup had no marrow as promised but chunks of mutton. The taste took me back to the perfect Irish stew. Hence no complains!

Chinese here is good and the waitresses are quite suggestive when it comes to choosing from the menu... cannot say it is a cheap place but nor  is it a pocket pincher... so iv a got very neutral opinion about this place... if u do not wish to have a special experience or some real great expection.. this is the place worth trying!!

Todays destination for lunch was Scoop in New Market area.This is in the same building as the KFC and Dominos.The place is big,so even though quite a few people were there it didn't  feel crowded.The decor is very colourful (a bit too much as per my likings).I had ordered for a plate of Chola-batura and my colleague had asked for some veg platter.The chola tasted okish to me since it lacked salt and since the baturas were VERY BIG i couldn't finish the whole meal.Even my coleague couldn't finish the whole combo she had taken,so quantitywise the food were good.

A place where I go back again and again. Earlier the fav item used to be the ice cream sundae. This is the place where I had my first sizzler at Kolkata. Nowadays my favorite is continental food. We ordered grilled fish, chicken steak, masala idli and Oreo sundae on our last visit. The taste was awesome. The ambiance is very colorful now. One complaint, the portion size has reduced drastically. The grilled fish on rice bed had only one spoon of rice as if for decoration purpose!

I have been here twice and on both occasions I was quite satisfied with the food served. It is located near New Market and even though I have tried only a handful of other restaurants in the area, I think its safe to say that there is no other restaurant nearby that serves as many items, available on the menu, as over here. It has everything from north Indian to Chinese, south Indian to Italian, continental and of course the most important DESSERTS. The last one is their speciality but I will come to it later. The ambience is really good and the restaurant is quite spacious and the staffs who take orders and serve foods, are probably among the best in Kolkata, they are all really young and quite smart and really quick in taking orders and serving up the food, the place is usually full at lunch hours but even at peak hours their service is top notch, but that's not the best thing about scoop, it's their desserts that really makes this place stand out. The last time I visited the place I had fried chicken(which was really delicious and crisp), special mix noodles(which was also pretty good) but the best thing was the sundae that I had ordered, the moonrocker, this thing was out of this world, they offer a wide variety of sundaes and even other regular ice creams, if one is visiting the new market and wants to grab a quick brunch or wants to have some of the best ice creams served any where in Kolkata, then this is the place.

Today we were there around 12-05 pm. The service was not started and they said if we order now, it will take minimum 20 minutes for them to serve the food. We were okay with it. After the served Starters, within 1 minute they served the main course. Obviously our main course got really cold. Lady attendants are very ignorant. Didn't even bother to serve the food to our plates. Why? I mean I pay for the service, but the ignorance are laziness of your lady servers really irritating. "Eat and Run" thing, next time I will go to Scoop, eat my food and just Run, without paying the bill.

One of my fondest memories of ice cream is associated with scoop! Way back then, the decor was a little more sombre with mellow lights. And the tutti frutti was the best. But they have kept pace with changing times and taste and how! 
The decor is vibrant and happy hues dominate with mirrored walls.
Honestly, ice cream is not a novelty. Yet what sets scoop apart is the generous add ons and the presentation. If you are a chocolate fanatic definitely try pehla nasha and puppy love- a thoroughly chocolate bonanza. If you are looking for other flavours, tutti fruity or banana splitz will please you!
Apart from ice creams they serve pretty good french fries and thin crust pizzas!

Two back to back bad experiances. The day before, ordered simple veg sandwich and french fries. Sandwich used stale bread and french fries had no salt. Today went with my sister and ordered pasta and fench fries. This time fresh fries was right but pasta was seriously under cooked. This possibly will be my last visit. I am overlooking the loud obnoxious music and cramped up sitting arrangement.

Situated between City Mart and KFC in new market, this food parlor has opened recently. We suddenly discovered this place. Ambiance is nice and place is large enough. You can get any cuisine from italian to mughlai in here, Also bengali dishes are available. Price is not so cheap. Serving time is average. Quantity is strictly for one people and if you are foodie then I think you need another plate of it.
We ordered pasta cottage cheese sandwich, kitkat shake, hot chocolate. Sandwich and shake were good, hot chocolate was a big let down. It was just a cup of complan health drink.

I visited this placed yesterday for the 2nd time
and realised that its a mistake on my part. If I would have checked my own review , I would have saved myself to the horrible experience I had there. Only good thing is how this place looks. It begins and end there only.
Have to wait for more than 15 mins to get someone to take my order.
Ppl were so busy that they didn't had time for order even when I am asking them to come and take the order.
I ordered cheese masala dosa and chicken club sandwich combo.
In dosa though cheese was visible however there was no taste in the food. Didn't feel like eating and left the food.
Waited for half an hour more after dosa for the sandwich to arrive that too after asking so many times.
Asst manager came n ask if we need anything , when I told him that m waiting for sandwich for such a long time and if the dish is not ready we can cancel it, then he went looking for my dish. French fries was cold and not crisp at all, sandwich was not cut from the middle like we get in other places I.e coffee world.
The plate was so dirty in which the sandwich was served that didn't feel like eating and got it packed which I later handed over to the beggar outside.
We have to ask for tissue paper and wait for 10 mins to get that. While paying the bill when I asked for the container in which I ask the sandwich to be packed people had no clue what I ask for.
ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING PLACE.
If you have money to waste, not expecting good food and have lots of time, then visit this place.
Posting the pic of dirty plate.

1st review.
Went there for the first time, the decor was good. Service and food was not good. It has free WiFi but it never connects. Order a burger the bread was not at all fresh. The person on the counter does not know how use swipe a card, after a few attempts he called someone and ask how to swipe it.

Any liquid drink is good. The food is impressive and tasty. One should try chilly prawns which is really fresh and soft.

The place which describes itself as a dine-n-run place is actually that. Right in the heart of Esplanade area, this place is a good option to grab a bite in between all your shopping or even before/after catching a movie. The food, that we had ordered, Jeera rice and Murg Bharta, was sufficient for two people and tasty too. It's a pity that we could not try out any of the tandoor items as they were unavailable during Durga Pujo. I would love to go back to try more of that and maybe even the Continental fare.

P.S.  We got a 10% discount on the bill amount because we had liked the Facebook page of the restaurant. Cool deal really.

Giving 1 star as that is the least you can give!!
We ordered mixed sizzler and spanish omlet.

Mixed sizzler was the worst possible you can imagine.It had 3 pieces of cold potato, looks like collected from roadside kachuri stall, some dam-aloo gravy, one chicken cutlet, one fish cutlet and one semi boiled chewy mutton chop.Yes, you are reading it right, these were part of sizzler!!!! You need to pay 310 plus taxes for this shit

Spanish omlet was egg fried with potato and onion. No I haven't missed any ingredients!!. It had grilled tomato and butter sauteed mushrooms and 2 slice of buttered bread!!

Had to go to KFC to complete lunch!!

Location: At the Heart of Esplanade, right opposite Sreeram Arcade and between KFC and Domino's pizza.
Ambience: Owing to its location, Scoop is always full!! The lights and the cute frames on the walls add a vibrant charm to the place.
Food: I have had a lot of dishes from their menu, and I havent had anything which wasn't tasty! Their pasta (both white and red saucs) , noodles (chicken and mixed) and biriyani are tasty. But best are the main course chicken dishes and their desserts.

Con: Their only deficiency is their staff. Most of the staff have a 'don't care' attitude and you need to call for 5/6 waiters before one of them comes to attend you. This aspect of the place is very annoying. And I guess the staff need to learn to be polite and promt!

Besides this, a Foodie will surely love Scoop!

It has quite a big menu and you may get confused on what to eat and what not.The best way is to follow your heart and tummy.The food quality is quite good and the staff service is prompt and staffs are well behaved.They have quite a lot of space and the best thing is that you can have a seat beside the window,watch the bustling crowd anx enjoy your food.The one thing that attracts me are the variety of ice creams they serve here.If you have a sweet tooth like me this is one one place you don't wanna miss.The quality of ice creams are great and the quantity served is quite a sumptuous.A nice place to spend a quality family time or fun with friends over food.

I have been to scoop many times before and found it okay. But this time the experience was a little different. On Saturday afternoon I went with my mom after a marathon puja shopping. We had to wait for sometime before we got a table. The food has always been okay but this time found it tastier. But the best part was the service. The staff right from getting us a table to taking orders and serving...everyone was very polite and managed the rush too well. Kudos to the team! Ambiance was very merry and bright! We had dosas and the pudina chutney was really tasty. Good place to check in if your starving after the shopping!

Scoop is a great place to hang out with friends or family. It is a young, hip, zippy and colourful one. The place is located right underneath the New Empire at Esplanade. The menu is variegated. Well ot indeed proffers different South Indian, North Indian, Bengali and Chinese cuisines that we all by and large do come across at several other restaurants. But the TRP of this place lies in its range of desserts and juices. The range is good and they are experimental. Also the facts that the price is cheaper and located around the New Market shopping area, it can be touted a more favourable destination for mostly shoppers. The people intending to have only quick snacks can also head for this place.
P.S The toilet above that is usable for restaurant-goers is not at all good. It's unclean and not even scarcely maintained. Another problem one may encounter is that the restaurant gets really populated by evening so one may have to get one's feet in a queue.

A friend insisted that we try out this place to grab a quick lunch. I really loved the ambiance and the decor of the place. It was full of colors and packed with excited faces and quirky furniture. The french fries with the mayonnaise was crispy and the quantity was much more than I had expected. We also had pop chicken which was crunchy outside, and soft and juicy inside. The chicken as well as the batter was extremely flavorful and the hot sauce complemented it perfectly. I would definitely recommend this even though I felt that compared to the price, the quantity was less. The woktossed veg hakka noodles with the fresh veges, also tasted pretty good. There were lots of staff present but even then we had to call them about three or four times before they attended to us and this happened a couple of times. Their behavior was also pretty cold. They made us wait for a very long time even though people who arrived after us were served promptly. All in all I would love to go there again for the ice cream but I hope the staff are more courteous.

Recently discovered this oasis amidst the busy and packed roads of New Market. The vibramt decorations and colours automatically energises you.

Didn't have that much of time to actually taste everything but the pizza here is absolutely to die for. Its tastes nothing like the dominoes or pizza hut pizza. It definitely is a class apart. We had ordered for the "quick gun murg gun" pizza. And it was simply delicious. 

Waiting to go back and try more of waht they have to order.

A multi cuisine, spacious, colorful restaurant. The first look will make you fall in love with it. However, one should not go by the looks alone. I have been there twice and both the times, I had to wait for a long time for, 
a) The waiter to come and take my order,
b) The waiter to come and give my order.
The staff working there have not been taught the meaning of hospitality as none of the times have I seen them sport a smile on their face. 
The pricing is moderate and the food taste is average as well. 
My suggestion is that you can give this place a miss unless you have a goal of visiting all the places in Kolkata.

Very bright, colorful, spot lights on tables, frames of quotes, great personalities, etc hanging on the wall. In food we had ordered Chicken Club Sandwich which was quickly & freshly served with mayonnaise & chicken stuffing and chips tasted good. In drinks we order Cappuccino and when they served it cookie was the bonus surprise for us. The staffs are very good and friendly. Its a pocket friendly & good place to hangout and chill.

The chicken ala king was tasty. But it was a very small amount. Disappointing. The pasta in meat sauce was same. The chilli chicken was alright. Nothing special. The mixed noodles was good. I found a generous amount of prawns.

Then we were passing by the dominoz and we could see a board showing "free WiFi", we got curious and moved ahead and came to know about the restaurant. Its interior is very good and the food is yummy. I have tried the chicken ala king and grilled fish, believe me its too good. People here are very well behaved, and after eating our stomach full we paid very less unlike other restaurants. Extra 0.5 I'm giving for the super fast WiFi serviceüòú

This place located at the heart of new market is perfect for having a after shopping lunch. I have visited this place a few time now. The sizzlers are a must try. In January I tried the chicken cheese burger for the first time. It was just delicious! So this friday me and my friend decide to go there again. This time the meal was served on a cute dish. Though the place we sat was just beside the counter and a carpenter was busy working, i guess if you have perfect food and a good company nothing else matters. :) And i will go back there again for the burger!

Not even for once have i been served at the right time. Made me wait a minimum for 20mins everytime. Last time i had ordered a combo meal which had grilled sandwiches with french fries. It arrived after half an hour. When i had received the order the dish was already cold.

The table for 2 is really small. the serve water in a steel glass, which is not cool. the waitress dont know how to smile or the minimum gesture. I ordered sizzler there, which was 200rs, and a total waste of money. I had sizzler of other places too, but sizzler of scoop just sucks. the rice looked like it came from some cheap veg biriyani restaurant. They dont had any cheese corn, baby corn or mashroom and so less salade. The masala pepsi was one of the worst masala pepsi I ever had. They serve it in a small glass which actually looks like a small size bottle.. So I would say it was a total waste of money for me...

A very unpleasant experience! I had gone there few weeks back with my family for a lunch. The food was okay type, but the worst part was their service. The waiters seemed very impatient and they were hardly attending us, although it was a weekday and the restaurant was quite empty. We had to ask them thrice to serve us, but nobody paid any heed. So we helped ourselves in the end.
The Manchurian chicken was overdone and the chicken fried rice tasted bland.
I hope they will look into these matters to come up with a better way to serve the customers.

The service is not at all good.. I visited this place twice but my last visit was a horrible experience.. We ordered 4plates of non-veg pastas and was asked to wait..after almost 15minutes later, 1 of the waitress comes and apologies that they made 3plates of non-veg pastas & 1 plate of veg pasta "by mistake"..& she convinced me to accept else their food will be wasted.. I mean who does that?? After that we were kept waiting for about another 20minutes and then we got the ice-cream sundae(puppy love).. Never experienced such a bad service..

visited twice. first on the christmas eve. fabulously decorated, eye catchy, simply unforgettable. had to wait because all the tables were occupied. they made us waiting inside. friendly behaviour.¬†finally we managed to get seated middle of a row. kashmiri pulau, mutton rezzala which i had, are not recommended. i mean if you cook these by yourself at home, it will taste better. ordered spicy chilly chicken because the rezzala felt very ordinary, dull. but had a good time. at least i could control the fire inside my belly :P¬†second visit- new years eve. same experience. ¬†i love their deserts. i heard pizzas taste really good here. i recommend sizzlers, ice creams and chillers.¬†wish to call myself an often visitor of scoop again.photos not taken. ll take next time. ;)

What caught my eye from outside is by its Some Large Decorations .... one of the best in the New MARKET hustle-bustle area... You will find peace here after having Hustle-Bustle journey.... 
The Ambience inside is Just Awesome.... even I liked the hospitality of the Staffs...It's a perfect for dining with Family as well as with Friends.... They will give you perfect place according to the number of members you bring... The Items here I found is within a reasonable amount......

This spot is extremely extraordinary to me in light of the fact that it brings back such a large number of recollections. My didi, my companions used to bring me here in the wake of shopping in new market. The stylistic theme of this spot is exceptionally polished and shading. It will make you say Amazing! 

I ordered for rice and chicken. As regular its alright.  Whenever I come, I always go  for as you like it (sundae), contains bunches of nuts n chocolate sauce. I simply adore it. 

The stuff are okay but always very busy however an excessive amount of occupied, and without a doubt needs a considerable measure of change.

It was a weekend visit......crowded at downstairs, upstairs is quite calm but i would recommend stay at downstairs because of the environment. Now the food....! I dnt know it was our fortune or what...the items cheated on us :). Bar -B Q chicken came with bone! Chicken pieces were wings part...which never go with bar-b-q, as far i know it should contain the chicken breast meat! We went with the expert, (the waitress!! as she claimed that the chocolate cake is awsome), but alas!! Cake was not upto the mark, it was rathr a brownie!...so overall 'below expectation'.

This place is very special to me bcz it brings back lots of childhood memories.My mom used to bring me here after shopping in new market.The decor of this place is too cute.I usually go for as u like it..n make my own choice of sundae.It contains lots of nuts n chocolate sauce.Among the other sundaes I like moon rocker,paradise found n dark temptation.It's a paradise for icecream lovers.

Visited this place today with my bestie today to indulge ourselves with desserts while re-living childhood nostalgia.We went for the usual As u Like it.

Although reasonable but the place is not at all a good option to have lunch or dinner. Very negligent service with bad hospitality. Along with bad food u can feed urself starting from dead flies to hair as the toppings.... Don't dare to try the crispy crunchy lamb its a wastage of money as the dish is burnt while cooking.... When its time to pamper ur taste buds or to pacify ur hunger don't visit this place .... It will spoil ur hunger, health n mood.

Visited last sunday. We ordered paneer Jhalfrezy, egg chilly chicken biryani,naan and tandoori roti. Though the order took some time, The taste of paneer jhalfrezy was good,paneer was fresh. Chilly chicken was very very spicy and gravvy was chilly hot. Egg was not fresh and looked dull. Ambience was ok. Overall a 50-50 experience but costs seems to be on higher side. Will avoid visiting next time.

Firstly the ambience of the place is really nice. Done in pink and the furnitures are simple yet sophisticated. Next comes the service. It was pretty quick.
Now the food.
It was amazing. 
I had non veg penne pasta in red tangy sauce and it popped open my taste buds. Also thebpan fried momos were mouth watering. The taste was really nice. I hope to be back there soon. And try something else. 
I gave it a 4 because compared to the price the quantity should be a bit more. But other than that. It's perfect. Heavenly eat out in the middle of all the hustle and bustle.

Been there at least 10 times in a year. Good food, good service, but sometimes overcrowded specially on holidays. 
Must try : Sizzlers, Grilled Fish (specially with garlic butter ) , Masala Dosa (sounds odd but try the chatney, thats awesome ), and any ice-cream sundee.
Must do : Planning for surprise for your girlfriend in Birthday visit Scoop and ask for Pehla Nasha sundee.

Scoop,located next to New Empire Cinema is a sheer blessing if you have been shopping in New Market and adjoining areas for day long and if you are dead tired and hungry! The vibrant colours and lights  used to beautify the interiors is very refreshing and make the ambience very nice. Choice of food items being plenty, you can choose from Chinese, Continental, Indian Tandoor or South Indian dishes. Yesterday it was a rainy day,and after my day-long shopping escapade with my family, i chose Scoop to chill and satiate our hungry souls. We ordered Masala Dosas, Plain Dosas, Veg Chilly Garlic Noodles and Non Veg Chilly Garlic Noodles. They also serve Chicken Dosas by the way, which I tried long bck..and liked it too. The filling of chicken keema inside the dosa is actually.too much.to finish. Yesterday's food was decent, but the Aloo filling in Masala Dosas was rather less. The Noodles, both Veg and Non Veg were great, however. Spicy, and full.of chicken, my Non Veg Chilly Garlic Noodles were awesome, and I had no reason to complain for what I ordered. The behavior of staff was nice too as they refilled our glasses of water almost instaneously. After paying the bill, also got a discpunt card for my next.visit. :)

This is one of those colourful and pretty places you don't come across often. Located at the Lindsay street in the New Market, this big joint is a treat for the eyes. The beautiful display of colours in their lights and ceilings and pretty chair and tables make Scoop a delightful place. I love scoop and i don't actually remember how many times I paid visit to this eatery. They have a multitude of dishes ranging from Italian to chinese bites as well as desserts which make you go ga ga. I love the pastas from here as well as the chinese dishes. I have never tried south indian from here so cannot recommend. This is a total value for money joint. But if you come here do try the pastas and desserts! They'll make your day. Btw do not forget to click pictures when you come (you'll know why once you visit Scoop). :)

Honestly i have been here only twice eventhough it is in such a great location.however i did not find the food extraordinary or anything above average and the price is a little expensive considering the quality and quantity of the food.i went there again after a year and was sad to see that the place has lost all its beauty and was extremely poorly maintained.moreover they served us stale food!!!and when we complained they reasoned with us that since we had already taken a bite the food wont be replaced!i would never suggest anyone to go to such a place where the people are least bothered about customer service and such rude attendants!

Treating myself at Scoop after an exhausting and rewarding shopping in and around new market area has now become almost a ritual . I somehow find this place to have this unique blend of nostalgia, peppy and delicious ‚Ä¶ well quite a hard combination to find ! ! At my recent visits I tried their egg nest(super cute super yum) ,Mango chicken salsa open sandwich and coffee . Their penny savers are quite a draw for the young crowd too. They also gave me this scoop card that gives you discounts and knick knacks on subsequent visits ‚Ä¶ but I was a bit disappointed as they did not give me the 15% discount on Tuesday to people who were wearing pink‚Ä¶ I accidentally I was in pink ! Well somewhere I know, despite the too pinky interiors , the bores in the false ceiling from where you can more often than not spot the peeping snout of a stuart little I am kind of going to drop by the next time I go ti mew market !

A long day of shopping at New Market invariably has to follow a a sinful indulgence here. This has to be my favorite ice cream parlor in the city. What I love most is the pink decor which will instantly make one feel like a character fro a Disney Fairytale. About the food, they are the most creative when it comes to their Menu. Gajar ka Halwa IceCream! I believe this is the only place which would serve that. Besides, they have customized menu during all seasons ("Sholoaana Baangali" food on "Naba Barsho" included). The sizzlers are a must-try. The best part, it is totally easy on the pocket with something for EVERYONE.

Scoop is primarily known for the Ice Cream of highest order it has been serving for decades now..Today amidst so many bakeries,desert joints this place may have lost its vigour partly but I remember from my childhood days this place was one of the Leading Ice Cream Players in the city..even today I prefer the classical flavours of ice creams served here..If I am not wrong till a point of time they used to serve primarily veg delicacies but nowadays they do serve some pretty tasty non-veg dishes as well.I would recommend to go for their starters and continental dishes.. Coming to the ambiance it is quite spacious and colourful giving it a modern,funky look..The seating arrangements are more like any Global food chains, so nothing classy about it..the service is prompt and servers are well informed it seems.. Coming to the food I never actually had a full course meal here,most of the time it is about some quick nibbles with Milk Shakes or Ice Creams before catching up for a movie at New Empire..I personally adore the Milk Shakes served here,quite refreshing..also I loved the momos the cook,actually quite tasty and filling..I would recommend the BBQ sandwich, the Chicken Pizza,Chicken Sizzler..They also serve some decent enough South Indian dishes..Personally I feel their Chinese spread is decent while their Indian spread is indifferent..Go for the Ice Cream specially,that holds the charm of this place..Do try their special Sundae.

visisted this place with my mom and my sis after a busy shopping day.Seeing the huge crowd we guessed it to be a good one.But we were disappointed.We ordered Biriyani with chilli chiken two masala dosa and aam panna because of the scorching heat outside.¬†
The food was not edible at all.Seems like they have missed most of the ingredients.And not only that they forgot out Aam Panna too.Its only when we reminded them they served us at the end of our meal.
Dont visit .Its better to go Park Street and have decent food rather than wasting money over here.

The first thing to catch up here is for the wifi.. Lol... Sounds weird I know. But after some bagful of shopping when you enter into this restaurant you actually glow up seeing the colorful lights of this place. The music and the ambience is all so well defined.
Apart from this, the prime purpose is to serve your tummy when you check into the menu card, it makes you all the more happy with thr pocket friendly price across the food items.
The quality of the food is good. The quantity is sufficient to suffice your hunger as well. The only improvent required is in the prompt service of the staff.
Please increase the staff count so that you fo not ignore those sitting in the 2nd floor, because yours is one busy outlet especially during the seasonal occasions. :)
Really happy and recommend those you are still waiting to pay a visit. :)

Regular size pizzaüçï isn't available. 2nd. The tomato ketchup is of a very cheap quality. 3rd. The advertised Wi-Fi is never available, half of the staff says it has technical problems, the other half of staff says it's fine but never tell the password.

This place is going down from my list!!
I have been there a lot of times none of my experience was pleasant, but this time they crossed my patience level..
Stale food. Yes, they actually served us stale smelly food. Ordered their new introduced in menu 'pehla nasha' .it came with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and one tiny piece of black forest cake. We took a bite and immediately had to call the waiter.
And to add it up when we requested for a replacement they refused telling us they cant coz we have already had a bite of it. Wtf! This is how you treat your customers? We ordered for our bill and left immediately.
I have been to hell lot of restros all my life, this was by far the worst one. Both service and foodwise. The quantity of evry item is too less and takes too much time to serve.
I am sorry but today what they did was beyond my tolerance, hope others read this review and learn soemthing.

One of my closest friend got placed recently and hence it was treat time. It was a sultry n blisteringly hot Sunday noon. We entered at about 1 O' clock. Four hungry lions.?
We decided to skip starters as there is not much option to choose from. Now this is one area where scoop needs to improve.

Coming to the main course my foodie friend Shubharthi opted for fried fish which came with with boiled veggies, chips and a lip smacking dip. I don't know its name neither do I know what was it made of. All I know is that it tasted amazing. Recommended?Hell yes..
I went for a simple chicken steak. Thankfully the chicken was well cooked and so was the veggies. And it came with bread rolls as i do not prefer rice. Only drawback was that they had sprinkled too much of pepper in the steak. It tasted more like a stew than a steak. Not recommended.
Other two could not decide what to choose so I thought baked pasta would be a good idea but the waitor informed it would take 45mins. We immediately discarded the idea n asked for pizza. Sadly it was not available. So we went for the signature dish chicken ala king and a chicken sizzler. Chicken sizzler contained chicken mutton fish and a poached egg and rice.Quite simple and well prepared. Chicken ala king was a bit disappointing. It contained pitiful amounts of boneless chicken almost lost in the sea of cheese. No complaint about the taste though. However we were not quite satisfied so we ordered a basil noodles with prawn. It was the best main course. The noodles tasted out of the world and me being a die hard Chinese lover could not keep my hands off the plate. The prawns were a little bit undercooked but the amazing taste and flavour made up for it.

For desserts we had Tiramisu and chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream. I had never had Tiramisu before and just loved it. Recommended.
The brownie was disappointing to say the least. It was too dry and had a bitterish taste. Do not go for it even if u see other people trying it.
Overall ambiance is nice and this place is cheap as dirt. Service is a bit slow.

A 3.5 it would have been but the plus .5 for the colorful decor. Its one of those places we Bengali's refer to as "Mon valo Kore dewa jayga".

Not one of those places for having fine dining or going back twice. But a very pocket friendly place for hanging out with friends. Thumbs up Scoop :-)

I actually never expected such a crowded place like Esplanade to have such a lovely place to hangout. I visited the cafe with a bunch of friends on a lazy evening and were delighted to the light rock music being played. They serve a huge range of variety here. Starting from Continental to South Indian cuisine. The cost of the dishes is very moderate and will keep our pockets happy. I had ordered BBQ Burger and was overwhelmed to see the way they presented the dish to me with complementary chips and mayo salad. The very look of the dish quenched my hunger. I was super impressed. The sizzlers offered here are also very delicious. My friends ordered shakes and ice-creams. Even the ice-creams were served to us with lovely garnishing. The staff are extremely friendly here and I would recommend people to visit this place while their shopping sprees in Esplanade area.

I quite love this place for its versatality.

Great Ambience.Its colorful as well as a little dim.
Menu ranges from north indian to chinese to italian.

We ordered chicken pineapple pizza.The chicken pieces felt not fresh.It was my first time trying out a pineapple pizza and I quite liked it.

Like most esplanade restaurants,this one is quite affordable.

Try it.Not bad.

All time favorite joints for icecream.... and you must try their signature item... As you like it.... I can't give comment on their food since I only had icecream there. So my rating is only for the icecream I had there at least 50 times since my college days.

Situated at one of the most busy area of Kolkata.. And it offers a wide variety of foods.. Tried their drinks, and all of them are tasty! They have mazing burgers and sandwiches and are pocket friendly.. Last time tried their chicken steak, which although I found too salty for my taste buds and bit clumsy.. Other than that rest is pretty good.. Quite a nice place..

Now this is a cool place to rest and grab a bite while shopping amidst the great Esplanade crowd and frustration.
Coming to the frustration part - if you're frustrated already ,this place could rejuvenate or annoy you . Depends. The interiors are either great or disastrous -depending on what mood you walk in with.
Food is good and fresh. Overpriced. But honestly -you won't regret.

Been to this place quite a number of times. I don't remember being dissapointed after having the food. Range of options are really good and it is one of the restaurants where they know how to maintain a multi cuisine affair. Portions served are pretty satisfactory and filling.
I have had chicken alfredo pasta, cream of chicken soup, chicken manchow soup, few starters and even masala dosa. All were nicely prepared and good to taste. Even the waitors and waitresses are well behaved and helpful.
The only thing I dislike about this place is the too very colourful interior. The moment you enter Scoop, it's like you are visiting some Disney land or something. Must say all that colour becomes irritating and confusing at times. :/ And yes another thing is they donot have a washroom of their own and if you ask they will redirect you to the washroom of New Empire movie hall which is needless to say P A T H E T I C !
For the food and pocket friendliness of it, it is a place worth visiting.

Went to search for a good restaurant in new market area . had gone to Oberoi but didn't find it good from cost vs quality point of view. we found this good looking restaurant quite nearby. it had a rush and I got the idea that it's a super hit.and no doubt it was. the bengali thali is a must and it was the most attractive  thali .it had all Bengali savouries u  would want .the penny savers were quite good and   The Chinese food was also amazing .the  quenching mango indeed quenched my thirst and The Misti doi was sumptuous .it is a great outing for family and if u re planning to go to the Grand Oberoi  Think twice. This would most probably  be a better option

The service was slightly slow, so that's an area that they can improve on. So after shopping in the bustling streets, you can definitely drop in here and choose from a varied menu!

This was among the few restaurants which I visited during my last visit to Kolkata. It was the night of Ashtami when we entered this place. We ordered Chicken Biriyani. I must mention that the Biriyani tasted wonderful. The interiors were also good. The only complaint towards this joint is that the food can be a little cheaper and it takes a lot of time to come to your table. Otherwise this place is good enough for multiple visits.

What I like about scoop is it's decor. The bright and vibrant colours really give you a happy feeling. From the floor to ceiling you can see efforts made on decoration. It is spacious and I don't think you will face trouble to get table. This multi coloured restaurant has  huge menu. You will find Indian, Chinese, Continental and various desserts. Some combo meals are also there on the list.

By now I'm to believe that they have good aesthetic sense as they also present their food beautifully. But the disappointing part is the quantity. The quantity is very less at times and it varies time to time. So, you can't just order,  rely on them and relax. The service is also very late.

The tandoori chicken was really good but again the side dishes were not up to the mark. I have a mixed feeling regarding scoop. They must update and improve.

The best thing I liked here is the ambiance. It is a melange of colours I tell you. It is spacious, colourful and perfect for a fun hangout place with your friends. I ordered an eggstatic , and two bowl meals. One was a basil flavored Thai noodles with hot garlic prawn, while the other one was spicy hot noodles with Japanese chicken. The eggstatic sandwich was served with fries. The egg was good, it has mushrooms and other goodies. The Japanese chicken was the best, quite akin to KFC's hot and saucy. The spicy noodles tasted good. The Thai noodles were a different taste altogether, the prawns could have been better. The service was prompt, and they were very gracious. Oh and also, the music was amazing.

My friends and family and I, we have been going to this joint for years now. Even before they decided to go all bubblegum pink and lime green. Honestly, i liked the old decor better. But when it comes to food, very few other places in town offer such a large variety at such a reasonable rate. Located at the shoppers hub in town, this is one of the few reputed eateries in the area that one can reach on foot, to take a much deserved break from shopping till they drop and satiate their taste buds. I'm a fan of their sizzlers and steak. Their combos and shakes are also quite good. Overall, a win win place for us when in new market.

Strangely, theres nothing great about this place but i still love going here out of all the places in this locality.

After a tiring shopping spree at new market area you can just go sit ,relax especially if its summers and you need an AC. :P

Well,  be honest i like the food here. Think of any cuisine and you will find it here. Be it Italian, chinese, conti anything...not to forget, you even get chicken khichudi.

One roof for all your cravings and hunger pangs after a hectic schedule at new market. Pasta, momos, desserts everything here is just so satisfying. The cost is absolutely pocket friendly almost like the outlets outside on the same lane with AC as a bonus.

Something worth mentioning after the food is the interior....wonder who was brain behind the colour scheme! Wont describe much...just go & check it out... :)

A nice and cozy restaurant to enjoy your meal after a hectic day of shopping...
I have been to this place long time back n had mostlt tried their chinese dishes...at that time they din't have so many variations in their menu...
Today we dropped in for lunch after doing some shopping...we ordered 2 fresh lime soda,one grilled fish and one fish sizzler...
The sizzler tasted great and so did the grilled fish..generous portions of fish fillet...with the right amount of vegetables...the dishes were a full meal in itself...
I woudn't say the prices are reasonable but they aren't on the high side either...
Worth trying once...

The outside wall attractions were beautiful and highly contradictory to the inner lighting and seating arrangements.
The colors and lights inside were too tacky making the ambience rating as low as 1/5

The food on the other hand.. Disappointed and impressed me both.
Suggested :
South Indian food,
Their chutneys are perfect
And so are their dosa's and uttapam

Not suggested :
Their fruit drinks and all, they are nothing but flavors in water

Chole bhature
The chole were raw and just sauteed last minute with the masala

Sizzler 
Their saffron rice were just orange colored, and there was no taste of saffron in it.

Food rating : 3/5

This place is good spot for hanging out with friends and loved ones. It's quite a relief point for the shoppers in this area. Have verious type of cuisine from Chinese to continental to bengali. Didn't like to discuss about the food because I of the food but just to spend the time. Resturent's penny saver menu is good combination and preety much affordable for college students as it fits their pocket money. The most thing I like about this place is the trendy looking waitresses wearing pink coloured Polo neck tee shirts. It gives it a nice youthfull trendy image of this place.

Nice environment and very good food. But faced a problem few days back, we had ordered for Chicken lollipop which was not cleaned and cooked properly. We had complained and the same was changed. After being changed the pieces were worst than the first time. Anyways it was a bad day for me as well the staff. The Lady manager was kind enough to listen patiently to our complain.

Something new that i discovered last day was PEHLA NASHA.. The way its served that was really eye appealing.

Visited Scoop after a couple of years. A mixed experience. The decor and ambiance was pleasant but service could be better. We were presented with the bill when we asked for the menu a second time to order ice creams. The waitresses were very slow to clear empty plates and bowls and had to ask them repeatedly. We ordered Chicken lolipop which were just about OK. Basil noodle thai style with hot garlic prawn was very good..esp the noodle. Spicy chilly garlic noodle with jap chicken was also good. Chicken fried rice came with very little chicken and was very bland. Schezuan chicken was tasted different but okayish. Left without eating sundae because Pehla Nasha, Paradise Found or Dark temptation all were unavailable. We ordered the first two, waited for several mins and then were informed that they were not available. Then asked for Dark Temptation and faced a similar experience.

In a busy area like New Market, Scoop from outside comes as a delight in terms of their seating arrangements and decor. But Food - Highly NOT Recommended! I with my colleague read the reviews and thought of trying food here since our office is nearby.

We had ordered for Chicken spring roll, Chicken cheese burger, Chicken Steak. All three seemed to be stale. The burger had chicken which was over cooked and it took away my entire teeth strength to chew. Steak was a very pale preparation. Lacked taste.

What was good about food - is the dessert part. We ordered for Pehla Nasha ice cream and Choco mud cake. The ice cream was normal and tasty. The cake was to die for. My 1.5 points go only for the cake. I might go again to the restro to just try their dessert section and specially mud cake.

Our bill was 920 and it was just not worth as the food was very disappointing.

One more thing they need to work on is - order timing, we waited for more than half hour just for our starter to reach us and also the music was just too loud Couldn't hear even what the person sitting opposite to me is saying.

My first time experience in Scoop was definitely not as I had expected!

your quick grab a bite joint in the new market area, which gives you that extra bit of service and quality at no extra cost!

My first visit to this place on midweek off day. I had a few things to buy from new market, and this proved to be the ideal no frills, pocket friendly choice of eatery in area. ¬†

The decor is too pink for my personal liking & looks like a barbie doll house.¬†
The food is reasonably priced and freshly served.

My friend opted for the spaghetti in white sauce/garlic bread/coke from the penny saver options. This, they got completely wrong and came with very little white sauce & a lot of green chillis/ red chilli flakes. Was taken back & the correct dish was dished out after another ten minute wait.¬†

I ate the chicken steak in pepper sauce which came with veggies and 2 bread rolls on the side.¬†

The hostess at the gate was friendly and promptly seated us as per choice. Unexpected in an eatery in this price bracket. The order taker was courteous ¬†as well, and informed us of the wait period of our order.

The place seems to be catering to budget tourists & young couples out on a budget date. Did I mention the couple at the next table ordered biryanis & the portions were enormous - ' beraal o dingiye jete paarbena ', as most bengalis would put it!

They also have screens above most tables, advertising slides of their current promos.

Well again a sudden plan of shopping with my college friend to new market. A weekday afternoon and it was too hot and humid outside. But yes.. Hats off to our indomitable energy. But then, we were too hungry and tired after shopping. We decided to drop in this joint when we noticed it from a distance. We occupied a table for two. The restaurant was quite crowded at that time, also being in a prime location it has to be so. Very nice, colorful interior with multi colored lighting. A large air conditiined space occupied by various types of comfortable designer seating arrangements. Some portraits are hanging from the wall. The pillars having colorful leaf and flower motif was an added attraction. Ambiance average. We ordered double fried lamb wrap, chicken ala king, pepsi. Chicken ala king was awesome and i didn't expect it would be this good here. The wrap was amazing and very spicy and hot. The outer cover was nothing but a roti and served with extra hot tomato sauce dip. And we had to order a dessert to cool ourselves down since pepsi was not enough. We noticed this pehla nasha on the menu. I just loved it. Black forest pastry was served with two scoops of vanilla ice cream with lots of chocolate sauce. It soothed our mouth and relieved us from the hotness. Service was good and price is very pocket friendly.

I have visited Scoop several time and my experience over the years have eld me to believe that Scoop is a very inconsistent place to eat at. The decor is very vibrant and bright with colourful chairs. The ceilings are brightly done and the whole place is a mix of multi-chromatic decorations. They have a huge menu and they usually have moat of it available. They have an Indian section, Chinese, Continental, a range of Ice creams and Sundaes and Desserts. They also have combo meals. 
The food presentation is also very tasteful, however the food is not that good. Sometimes they live up to the expectation and plate up delicious food, the next time you order the quality is not the same. The quantity is also inconsistent and most of the times it is less than it should be. Luckily at times I have received good food whether Chinese or Continental, however most of the times I have been disappointed. Their Sundaes are nice and the Ice creams are nicely flavoured and well presented. I have tries their Creamy white sauce pasta which is moderately good. Crispy fried Pepper Mushrooms are sometimes nice and crisp at the other times soft and tasteless. There has also been an incident where my pasta had a baby cockroach in it. When I pointed it out to them they took it away and didn't charge for the dish. They had a Philadelphia Cheesecake on offer which wasn't really a cheesecake. 
Service is a little clumsy and late. Overall I have had mixed experience with Scoop.

We ordered jst one club chicken sandwich and one large lassi... the lassi was so so but the sandwich was a real disaster! First of all...we ordered chicken sandwich and there was no trace of chicken in it...then we r informed that the chicken is mixed with  mayonese,  making scrambled egg (never had such a bad scrambled egg)the major part of the sandwich! Moreover, the bread quality of the sandwich is so poor that it can hurt Ur mouth while eating! I mean... literally! So b careful...!

A good place amidst the busy New Market area to take some respite from the endless shopping spree, with some cool Sundaes and spicy starters. The ambience is nice, service is about okay but yes, a great place to have some never-ending conversation and while the time eating and watch people ...

Been visiting this place for a long time - the As you like it from the menu is what kept bringing me back but I found out over time that it has quite a decent menu all across as well. I don't think their Chinese is exceptional - but even then it's not too bad.

The ambiance is good and the prices are not too high either. I would recommend this place to anyone.

Scoop it was once famous for its Ice Cream but the thing which disappointed me the most was the common ice creams were served at high rates which can be accessed easily in retail shops but I really like the Vanilla Shake and Chocolate Shakes but even they are now common...At all the place is well maintained ant the Food is also good..!!

Visited the place again. .this time for more than only the Sundaes.
Located in the new market area in a place where most of the food joints are. Its a bright place with the fluorescent colours reigning , find it quite cheerful. This time we went in after a shopping trip . .very hungry. We ordered Jap chicken , a fish+French fries+ Pepsi combo and a sundae -- Pehla Nasha.
The Jap chicken was good . .a little different in taste (in a good way) but was too little in amount or rather size, but loved the sauce.
We had to wait a long time for the fish and chips but if I may say so,it was well worth the wait. In fact it was so good, the thinly crusted but crunchy fish fillets and fries , that we ordered another.
The sundae was as usual a good one with a black forest pastry and scoops of blind love ice cream but the scoops too have shrunk in size. Disappointing !
All in all the food is good but really think that they should improve the service ,try not to make the customers have to remind them again and again of the order. Also the food is a bit overpriced for the amount and the quality.

A nice joint with a quick service....at a great location, the heart of the city. I went with my wife and a friend and we ordered chicken club sandwich, french fries and a regular very cheesy chicken pizza from ¬†the menu...was served in about 6-7 minutes...and almost perfectly made...i wished a little more color and crispness of the breads but taste wise, there is not a bit of disappointment...layered with cheese and fried eggs...mashed chicken and juicy tomatoes and cucumbers...and the portion size was huge...it was a combo snack with french fries and they actually serve french fries comparable with McDonalds...long sleek and crisp cuts of carbohydrates....the only improvement area was the salad that the gave along with it...probably they would call it a coleslaw but i would say its a coleslaw which is 2 days old left outside the freezer...better not to serve that...the cheesy pizza was served over a wooden pizza peel...was nicely baked with right amount of cheese...
overall, i liked the place and would definitely go again if i visit the area and would recommend others...they have a good variety of indian, chinese, south indian and continental menu...the service is prompt....nice music, vibrant colors in the decor and definitely not a dull place...

I have nostalgic memories with this place... I am a regular visitor here since my college days... Hence have gone through the various make overs or the changes that scoop, esplanade, has gone through...once upon a time i had visited this place with my mother...and now that she is no more, i visit this place with family n friends... a lovely warm place to be in..the ambience is very good along with the food quality...earlier it was famous for its desserts ¬†but now it comes with a lot many other options . i am most fond of the continental and the chinese cuisines... Scoop for me is a place of repose...and when people like Jayprakash, Ananta, Suman welcome you it becomes your second home...I am ¬†not exaggerating but earnestly mean it... Jayprakash, Ananta , Suman and the rest have been so warm towards me that they now hold a special place in my heart...Even Miss Tanya, floor manager of scoop, has been very efficient and cordial in carrying out her business... Thank you guys for making me n my family feel so special.

I used to frequent this place when I was dating my husband. We often visited New market area as it is one of our favourite place in Kolkata. I still remember gorging on the icecreams there after catching a show in New empire cinema hall. One of their items I loved was the Grilled fish in lemon butter sauce. It was really good. But on my last visit, I found that the service has gone down and also the quantities also have gone down. Prices are okay but was highly disappointed by our last visit.

Have visited this place quite a lot,because less of family restaurant in New Market area.

Very colorful restaurant - colorful chairs,lights and decor.They serve almost everything, be it south Indian,north Indian,Mughlai,Chinese,Continental and Cold beverages.

But let me tell you,choose the dishes very carefully because most of them taste lack of authenticity.

In my several visits, I have tasted many items.Sometimes¬† Kashmiri Polao,Shahi Korma,sometimes Special Mix Noodles¬† with Chicken side dishes,Sometimes Chicken Sizzler/Chef's Special Veg Sizzler,but most of the times Sundae(Specially Tutti Fruity).

None of them was extra-ordinary in taste,just a typical form of the authentic dishes.

Every items are good in quantity(not in quality).Tutty Fruity is exceptional.

But even after so many negatives, the main plus point is location and item options.

Thus Scoop remain a popular destination in Esplanade area

Amongst all the restruant I have visited yet, this is the one place where I came across all sort of colour known to us used for decor. From outside itself this restro is very eye catchy as you will fell like visiting it at least once. The mix n match of colours inside is being done quite brilliantly, which, I would say, create a perfect environment for a 'Date'. 
As we entered, staff escorted us to the seats and the service they provided was quite good. Talking about food this place serves varieties of food starting from Pizza to Biriyani and it tastes quite good. 
Visited only once n had a great experience with food as well as with the ambiance. Price is also reasonable and I must say its a saviour during the peek shopping hours at esplanede, where u can get good food at a resonable price.

The moment you enter this joint the first thing that strikes your eye is the vibrant sympohony of colors all around. It seems like you have come inside a rainbow surrounded by clouds. The decor of this place is striking and just a eye candy that gives you a soothing sensation. This place is located near the new empire cinema of new market. This was a place which created a food court type environment even before the shopping mall culture came to town. They offer almost everything ranging from salads, pasta, pizzas, chinese dishes, kabab platers, even simple maggi noodles, ice creams, juices, shakes etc. You name it and this scarlet red place has got everything to make your mood. One of the most important point supporting this joint is their reasonable price which could be adjustable to everyone's budget. Hence if you are near by new market area and looking for something rather than typical street foods in a reasonable budget then "scoop" is your destination.

But cant comment about food because we didn't have anything for their as there was a server problem so the Lady over there told us it would take time,they can't make any effort rather than waiting for the connection problem solved from the server itself and as we were in hurry couldn't wait for long... Hope next time when i ll be visiting there they can serve me n change my opinion towards the restaurant... Good Luck ????

This place was our joint during Durga Puja shoppings...i remember all us borthers and sisters used to doll up and after a hectic shopping voyage used to chill over Banan Milk shake and Ice cream sundays...i had my first french fries ¬†there.... Me and my best friend on our first "√ñut of home B'day Party" had the most awsome meal there...and i still remember the cheesy family non veg pizza and milk shakes. Today whenever i come to New Market area Scoop has to be visited and revisited. The staff is cordiall and they go out of the way to make you feel comfortable. I love their Russian salad and they will surely spoil you for options. The burger is too good and the sandwiches are a delight to have. They give fresh lime soda in tall glasses and its a thirst quenching delight.

After a hectic exam me and my pals were dead hungry and decided to give the utmost pleasure to  our stomach at scoop. The interior is large and nicely decorated. We were a pack of 6 people and luckily got one of the tables to sit . After a huge discussion we ordered an  indo ‚Äìchinese mixed menu in the starter section :P It was Fried wantons, chilly garlic basil prawn, Tandoori fish and Tandoori murg followed by diet pepsi . The starters were yummilicious specially the prawns with a zesty touch and the other ones were flavorful too. The Tandoori fish was succulent and immensely spicy. We  literally wanted to lick our fingers but unfortunately we couldn‚Äôt do so. The main course came after a short while & it had Grilled fish, Cantonese noodles (non veg) Flaming chilly prawns, Indonesian shrimp fried rice and spicy chilly chicken. The Cantonese noodles is too healthy with steamed veggies making it very appetizing and even the grilled fish was delectable. I personally found the prawn dishes are above praise worthy, the tastiest prawns I ever had. The fried rice and chilli chicken was also good ,nothing extraordinary but  I found the quantity was little less. The staffs are well behaved and the service too was up to the mark. It is obviously recommendable for  atleast once but  for prawn lovers - twice, thrice or more.

Quite a legendary hotel and more a land-mark in the busy New Market area.
Though it's not been many times I have visited Scoop, but the thing that would keep me dragging towards itself is it's colorful and vibrant decor.
though it lacks in privacy a bit, but the candid interior can compensate that..
The dishes I had/have over there comprises of Dosas, Salads, Burgers and Sandwiches.
Needless to say Scoop will score an outstanding grade for it's deliciously prepared Cheese Dosa, which I never miss whenever I visit this outlet and of course the exotic and mostly important healthy Salads.
The service is prompt and the waiters, though too many in number but friendly and efficient.
However I feel that the chairs and the tables should be more comfortable and cozy and of course a bit more spacious.
Prices are too friendly. 
P.S.- I don't know why I felt that the Scoop Sandwiches are a bit less stuffed and not so soft.

New Market has several good eateries and Scoop is one of them.. During puja shopping time,me and my friend were hungry after shopping so we headed to this place... 
Food-- we ordered Chicken Lolypop and Chicken Biriyani. . We have to wait for 20 minutes.  Food was delicious.  Biriyani was average with two pieces of chicken,1 egg & not too much oily. Lollypop was served with potato chips.  Average type bt nt so good...and the main thing is late service...there is no one to serve water or giving tissue also
Location-- just beside of kfc and Domino's.  It has very colourful decoration. 
As we get place at 1st floor we cant enjoy the decoration of ground floor.  
Overall good place! enjoy foodie.....

But the quantity is too less for two people where as in many places it is quite fine. Even am not satisfied with the taste also. May be the other dishes tastes good but i didnot liked it.

I had been to this restaurant for quite few times and finally its time to put down the experiences on the paper. Quite a lot of them in fact. Among the numerous visits here is my take on this..

The ambiance, colorful comfortable chairs. Has Wi Fi which is indeed great, don't expect to stream movies or songs on youtube but causual surfing is fine. However not the best of the hygienic places, found some flies buzzing around the table, must be a lucky one to enter I believe.

Coming to the food which is the main aspect, some of the items which I had tried Lassi, nothing great about it. Name any sizzler on the menu and I have had all of them, sad Chicken sizzler is my fav but it is not the best which can tickle your taste buds. Pizza is good. Sandwiches OK types. Noodles are too oily.

Next visit not sure when it will be..

I had been visiting Scoop for the past 14 years [since the year 2000], when I got married. Scoop was basically the epicenter of my courtship with my wife Kavita. Everytime I visit Scoop, I get a nostalgic feeling and recollect sweet memories of the past. Recently, I celebrated my kid, Bitan's 12th birthday here, and OMG !!! What a reception it was !!! Led by Tanaya, the entire team was on their toes in ensuring that all of us, my entire family with my parents, felt as if the celebration was being carried out at home. Being a Citibanker, I know how it feels to seal a smile on the customer's face, so I know that for the entire Scoop team, it is always an achievement to satisfy the customer. Be it the ambiance, the price tag, the quality of food, the staff - you can't help but continue to shower them with praises and accolades. Good show guys !! Keep it up !!!
I have attached a couple of pics - one pertaining to the b'day celebration which I spoke about, and the other is a pic clicked at the same spot 8 years back, with Bitan surprised at the size of the Dosa !!
Thanx for everything.
God bless - Biplab

One must try the Sundae called Sweet Love. It's simply amazing. Apart from this everything remains unchanged, as it has been for the past 17 years that I had been visiting the place. Thanx Tanaya n Team !!

Visited this one on the very first day of Durga Puja, and my experience was just horrible, and I literally mean it. First when we entered the restaurant i really liked the ambiance, it was full of vibrant colours and soothing music, we got a table for three of us. Then the main part starts, first we were sitting just unattended for half an hour, even nobody came with a glass of water. Then after calling thrice one lady came to take the order. After placing the order we were chatting and suddenly the lady who took the order came with some plates and spoon and and literally dumped on our table, we were really shocked with this kind of attitude, though all of us were in festive mood we ignored this. Then one guy came with the order and just left the bowls and left, there was no one to at least arrange the plates, whatever we were hungry at that time so helped each other. The food was ok , but I found the quantity a little less according to the price (You can get sufficient amount for 2 people in any restaurant in China Town at lower price). But there were more surprises waiting for us, we asked for water and the same lady who took our order came and she accidentally overfilled "TWO" glasses ( I don't know how it could be possible ), and didn't even apologized for that. Then we noticed something was floating in one of the glasses, we asked the lady to change the glass and she surprisingly asked us what is the thing floating, we took a close look and found some small onion like thing, then she asked how that thing gone in the glass and by her tone it was clearly reflecting that she was trying to mean that if we are responsible for this or not, then by gods grace she replaced the glass. We quickly finished the food and paid the bill and left the place as soon as possible. Truly speaking this place just spoiled our mood for the whole day, and I would never ever recommend any of my friends.

Today I visited The Scoop for the very first time as I am in¬† Kolkata for official travel.
¬†
Found the restaurant good, serving almost all the cuisines I like. As I am from Delhi, was looking for good north Indian food here. 
¬†
The dal I ordered was awesome (better than any other regular restaurant in Delhi), however the roti's were made of maida (all purpose flour), which are supposed to be made of wheat flour. 
¬†
Ordered a greek salad.. which came after I got my main course.. also.. dint expect cucumber to be a part of greek salad..
¬†
But the service was good and the one thing I liked about the place is that the staff was putting in a lot of efforts to attend the customers at the earliest.. (making eye contact n reading the signs) which was absolutely brilliant..
¬†
a regret that I was so full till I completed my meal that I could not try the as your like it ice cream...sundae..
¬†
But overall.. I would love to visit this place again whenever I come to Kolkata..
¬†
Doing a good job guys.. keep it up.

Scoop at New Market is an awesome place to visit after a hectic day of shopping and chill in the air condition. The interior is huge and pretty well decorated. There are both male and female waiters to take the order and serve you. The place also has wifi connection which is even more better if you want to sit there for a long time and chit chat with friends over a cup of coffee and different variety of food available here. Though it is a spcious restaurant yet you will find it full most of the time given its proximity to new market and shreeram arcade located on the opposite. They serve everything from a thali to continental to south indian ¬†to italian and english. They also have a wide variety of desserts and shakes. Overall its a wonderfull place to chilla and experience good food.

After shopping at New Market, me and my friend headed to this place with great hunger!! I was attracted by the decoration of this restaurant.. When we entered the lady said we have to go to First Floor, I was highly disappointed as the first floor has no decoration but we enjoyed the view of the street from window side chair.¬†

FOOD(4/5)->> We were too much hungry so we asked the waiter what will be fast and he said chicken Lolypop. So we ordered Chicken Lolypop and two plates of Chicken Biriyani. Lolypop was served after 10 minute and there was lots of potato chips with chicken lolypops. Lolypop was average. then after 15 minute Biriyani came. I liked the biriyani very much. Two pieces of chicken and plenty amount of Rice was quite enough for a person. Taste was so good. They provided varieties of sauces with your food.

Location & Hospitality->> This restaurant is just beside line of KFC ¬†or Baristaa. Staffs were humble and the place was quite clean. Only thing I didnt like was the waiting time for Food and we have to ask for the water each time.¬†

Lastly, good place, go and try atleast once.

AVOID THIS RESTUARANT, WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE OF KOLKATA.Last week we visited Scoop and ordered Chicken Sizzler and Fries. It was taking more than 30 minutes for them to prepare. In between I thought of using the wash room and asked one waiter as I couldn't see any sign. The waiter was giving me direction to go to upstairs and in between suddenly another waiter mocked to go out of the restaurant and do it on the road. Extremely unprofessional. The food which was served was also not that good. The fries were of black rotten potatoes. So Avoid this restaurant.

I have been wanting to visiting Scoop for quite some time after watching its colorful interiors from KFC. Visited the place last Friday with mum and sister after shopping. We entered the place at around 3 and there were a few empty seats on the ground floor. While we were about to sit, a lady directed us upstairs. We had no idea what a mistake we are making by going upstairs.

We were directed to sit on a table right infront of the door. The AC was either too low or absent upstairs. Not nice. The waitress arrived to take our orders. She had that constant eyebrow lifted expression with so much attitude that it would instantly irritate you. We ordered Chole Bhature and Capsicum Utthapam. She asked if we wanted mineral water with the same rude tone. When I said she could serve serve plain water, man! you should seen the reaction when she just said 'we dont serve plain water'. Well, the restaurant rules can differ and it is alright but atleast be polite. What the hell! So the Queen waitress marched off telling us it would take a minimum of 30 minutes :/

The food arrived at around 3:40. Three friends left from a table beside us after the snooty behavior of the same queen waitress. The chole bhature was good to my relief! My sister was quite pleased with her food till she found a small stone in her food (picture follows). I was not surprised by now. My Capsicum Utthapam was nothing great. It was not bad either.¬†

The worst part was there was a room (store room) right in front. They brought in the food from downstairs and kept it inside that room before serving it to everyone for some reasons. So what is so bad about it? Well, the room had a broomstick and a corner all red with paan stains (picture follows). This room was right opposite to my chair and after one view of it, I could not gulp down my food. I mean how can you keep the food which has paan saliva? Where is the hygiene factor? Yuck!

We also had to ask for tissue papers as they were not provided otherwise. There was a sweet guy who served us food. Finally a relief from the other rude waitress. However, I would never recommend this place to anyone. There are just colorful interiors, just on the ground floor and that is all that I liked here.

So, quite a disappointment we had. And I am never going back again. Period.

We ordered a creamy cheese penne pasta . It tasted really good . Then we had sheekh kebab and fruit and nut icecream. It is one of the best place to have ice cream . This place has a quirky item on their menu - biryani with chilly chicken , hope to try with out on my next visit.

Was in this area after ages...thanks to a bunch of friends who decided to go shopping on Saturday evening. The area was teeming with people as expected and the weather was sultry to say the least. We choose Scoop for some air-conditioning comfort. On entering we were told to wait for 5 minutes near a gate. The lady was sweet and a glance revealed the place was filled with hungry shoppers...some with family and some with their partners!

Got a table by the promised time for the five of us. We wanted to order momo and some chinese snacks (and it was evening time) but the waiter politely told us that Chinese and Indian dishes would take around half an hour to arrive and continental  or south indian was the only option because of the rush. We took his word and ordered a large "Yum Yum Yummy" pizza and "As you like it" Ice cream. The pizza arrived in 15 minutes and was not served on a regular tray but 3 side dishes with three slices each instead. The pizza was not so yummy as it sounded even after we put lots of oregano and chili flakes! The chicken toppings were small and I could not find much vegetables either. As requested, the ice cream was served right after we polished off the pizza. It did live up to scoop's reputation, served in a huge bowl with different flavors like butterscotch, vanilla and chocolate complete with nuts and fruits. It did make up for the pizza disappointment.

A note on the interiors. I noticed the false ceiling in certain parts of the restaurant in a pretty bad shape although the place looks bright with a lot of colours and plastic furniture which gives the place a young feel. The air conditioning was terrible considering the fact that it was full and the weather was extremely sultry outside. And finally, while leaving we saw puke lying on the floor which was unattended to (it seemed for sometime). Yuk!

Yesterday I went to scoop with my friend, after 20min of waiting they came to our table to say "we will be with you shortly". (Then we have to ask for water several times to get that. Their table cleanliness is not up to the mark, service is awful) After waiting a long time we ordered chicken ala king and they serve our food after another 30 min of waiting. The food wasn't good. All over the experience @ scoop is not at all satisfactory. I'm going to scoop for a long time but after tomorrow's experience I'm not gonna advise to any one for scoop (at least until if have other choice).

What do I say about this place... Its one place I always try to go whenever I visit kolkata. Located in esplanade, near the new market area surrounded by many fast food joints and restaurants. But this place stands apart in the crowd. Well atleast when one enters the restaurant. Has a very nice ambience,neat funky decor. And a courteous staff. I have been told that they even given discounts to all-women customers. The place is spacious and houses a modest crowd at any given time. They recommend us to book in advance. Now to the food. Well they have a good variety of cuisines which include indian, Chinese and other oriental dishes. They keep changing their menus from time to time and they also keep special menus for special occasions. I like their smoothies, and among the main course the reshmi chicken, the tandoori variety and pulaos are my favourites. I would recommend anyone living in Kolkata or anyone nearby to try out this place at least once.

The concept of scoop is really modern yet it doesn't come across as a clich√©. The food is undeniably scrumptious and the menu is really pocket friendly. Although I wish it had a bar it doesn't steal  credits from the place of being a really nice hangout place. I hope to visit Kolkata and Scoop soon again. Cheers to the management for putting up a really decent job.

It was a weekday and there was a  reunion of college friends at new market.  The weather was quite hot so we decided to settle down at scoops without wasting much time in travelling. The interiors and ambiance was done up well but could have been slightly better. Our order consisted of

Fresh lime soda
Veg hot n sour soup
Fish finger
French fries
Simply veggi pizza
Crispy chilli babycorn
medu vada

All the items did not taste good. Only the pizza stood out which was crisp , thin and cooked well. They should consider improving their chinese section as it really lags behind. Service was also not prompt. Overall a below average place.

Location: New Market

Gone are those days when one used to go on a shopping round at new market and made it a point to drop by at Scoop for a quick bite or a full-fledged meal. 
Scoop is located right beside the New Empire which was quite famous in the good old days for the screening of English movies that were released here. 
The ambiance out here is quite colourful and as you enter it would simply cheer up up. 
But, sadly this happiness is quite short lived and is taken over by a grumpy face as soon as you seat yourself. Yes, uncomfortable seats.

This place has anyway taken it's shortcut to oblivion with the help of the rude servers, near to average food across all cuisines they have on offer and last but not the least the stench that overshadows the room fresheners they spray! 

This place used to be one of my favorites in those early days but, a recent visit with the most disgusting experience rendered this place to be a strict no-no for me. 

What made the experience bad? 
-A smelly place altogether. 
-Drinking water not being served even after reminders.
-Food portions do not justify the prices. 
-Bill given along with the meal. :\ 
-Rude Staff and too busy doing nothing.
-Instead of accepting that the food wasn't upto the mark, silly excuses are given, out which the excuse that tops the list is "This dish is made like this". I mean, c'mon, we customers aren't fools. 

Good experiences turned bad! :\

One star from me.
+0.5 for all the old times this place made me come back for more.

The colourful modern decor cafe " Scoop "
What to write about scoop,this cafe is around from my school days. Once it was the only known places to hang around with friends.. Located in the new empire building near New market.
The cafe looks very cute.. With a cheerful decoration its a instant mood lifter.
But things have changed now..as u step inside there's a awful smell which is a total turn off. 
The food is average.. I have tried scoop's silzzers,crispy chicken, hakka noodles nothing special..pretty much okay. 
Price is reasonable. 
My favourite was there sundaes with five scoop of icecream...I'm having it from my school days that's the only reason I'll go back there. 
I won't recommend any of there food but to try their sundaes.

A good place to hang out with your friends on a weekend with some of the very good food at offer. Their must try are grilled fish with lemon butter sauce, hawain salad and not to forget their sundaes.  They serve pretty good mocktails as well! Price is quite reasonable and their revamped interior is also quite well. However, a bit noisy place...so maynot be an ideal place if you are looking for a quiet meal. Perfect place to catch some quick snacks whike you are shopping there at new market!!

I have been here quite a few times since my childhood but never retained any information so write a review on it. Finally I went here today after a long time and I was surprised by the way this place has changed. They seem to have revamped the place with a lot of neon lighting and funky decor. They also have free wifi now. The first thing that took me by surprise was the very loud music. Loud enough to irritate you a bit. We were then seater soon and we ordered for a 'Paradise Found' Ice cream and another tutti fruiti along with a Pepsi, a plate of chicken steamed momos and a chilly chicken dry. I disliked their service especially because we werent served water for about 20mins since our arrival. We had asked for it 4 times but in vain. It finally arrived at our table along with the ice creams. The tutti fruiti was great and so was the paradise found, scoop has been popular of its ice cream anyway. Then we got served our main snacks, the momos were good but the chilly chicken was mediocre, could have been better and again we were served the Pepsi when we were almost through our snacks. The total came upto 754, I still dont understand why a glass of pepsi which is Rs.10 (the glass bottle) costs Rs.55 not just here but mostly everywhere. Anyway so the service is quite poor as you can read. Orelse the place is good for a friendly hangout and some munchies in between shopping sprees. Though there are many options to eat oit here but this one is worth a shot. Happy eating.

Full of decorations and full of show-off! But lacks in the main business like hell! Food is rubbish!!
Ordered Mixed Fried Rice but it was so dull..and to add to the misery the prawns were also stale!
Tried to complain..but they said that the prawn is less fried thats why..as if we have never had prawn before.
They offered a complimentary ice-cream which we rejected.. Great prices but worst food!

Scoop has totally lost its charm! The food quality has degraded! We ordered for a cheese masala dosa, a pizza, and a chicken cutlet! None of the above were edible! We actually had to leave everything as it is...! The service girls there are really rude! Scoop is a total no no for me now onwards!

Visited this place during my last visit to Kolkata with some friends.
The ambiance of the place is nice and so with the presentation of the food. But the taste does not do justice to the ambiance and their presentation. Most of the dishes are kind of tasteless and do not excite the taste buds
Ambiance 4.0
Presentation 4.0
Food 2.5
Service 3.5
pocket friendly - Not really according to the food they give. So a 2.0
And hence a 3.2/5 will do justice.
Not really recommended and there are other better options available around this place at lower rates.

This is the most pathetic restaurant I have been to in recent times. Service is worst, as food is also very cheap and oily sans taste. Its really unfortunate to have such a sub standard restaurant in such a location. I have visited Scoop in Salt Lake location, but that branch is not so worst. Management of this food joint should look after the service, specially the female employees and also the food quality.

Ambience and food go hand in hand when reviewing a restaurant. The place is well decorated with pleasant lighting. The seats were just average and the room freshner made me SNEEZE.... :) Food was good. Their sundaes are very eye appealing and delicious. An upselling point for Scoop is their "Go As You Like" sundae, where you can choose your flavours and toppings. Lovely experience at a reasonable rate.

This is a place for those who judge the book by the cover. The only way I am giving this place a 1.5 is because of its vibrant deco, else it deserves a shit. My message to the owner, shoppers in a market area comes to eat in a restro, don expect everybody to be lost in their partners' eyes. If you cant provide good food, then you get such remarks.

scoop from outside it looks like a posh restaurant..... getting inside the ambience was awesome.. i thought i would be a lovely time with my mother.. but when we sat in the place there was a sudden rush of bad odour.. next was the menu god such high price rate!!! but thought the food may be up to mark.. so we ordered a cheese sandwich, pasta, n crispy chilli baby corn... first came chilli baby corn first it was good but as we went through the dish the babycorns seemed to be stale... then came the sandwich it was just two slice of bread with cheese in between.. i thought what is this and it cost 95 rupees without vat ... then came pasta it was the worst pasta i ever had... i think the chef forgot that cheese contains salt so extra salt may not be added.. it was the worst.. i was disappointed with the  food and the price.. this price does not suite the food they serve

The decor is very nice. It's done in neon basically. 
The prices are equivalent to the price of the food served there. Not so great but subtle for a hangout with friends. 
Service is a bit slow and some waitresses are negligent. I went there with my mom and sister. Our bill was around 1035 INR. 
The dark temptation is a MUST try though.

I regularly visit this establishment, whenever I go to watch a movie or for any reason I am there. I like best their Mixed Platter Sizzler, which is awsome.

One thing which I would like to mention and I found a bit odd was that the waitresses should get a bit more professional dress.

The ambience is pretty great, with a lot of open space, colourful lighting and decent sitting arrangements. 
I had ordered cold coffee frappe, a chicken thali, and chicken burger with fries.
The cold coffee was amazing, the chicken thali was enough to calm down the grumbling of an empty stomach. The chicken was good, with tok doi and average peas polao. The burger, or a double sandwich, to be more precise, was delicious, and the fries had very little oil. 
The service was also very good.
I didn't have a lot of items, but all in all, a great experience.

hello friends even if you r very hungry please dont ever go for scoop.its ambiance colours and poshness will probably give u a good outlook of the place but actually its worst. the prices are unnecessarily high which actually makes no sense.,me and my friend went dere and ordered a mixed friedrice but to my great surprise the prawns were hell smelly.when i complained about it they gave me unnecessary stupid reasons to clarify. go to any other place but not scoop. the taste of the rest of the dishes were average.

I tried :
Biryani

fried rice
pasta

This is the first place where fried and crushed onions are used in garnishing biryani although i didn't find the same in my last visit. I also noticed it is not fresh at all.

I visit scoop frequently. But this time I was highly disappointed. We ordered masala kulcha one paneer dish, chicken steak & sweet lime sodas. Though chicken was cooked well & falling apart, but the paneer dish was a set back. They weren't fresh & kulchas were chewy.
On the whole it wasn't quite nice this time. But service was efficient.

Came to know of this place last yr...for last one yr, I wud hv visited this place more than 50 times for the 'chicken sizzler' only. Suddenly on 3rd July 2014, when I had ordered my fav sizzler, I was taken by shock as other than a small chicken piece and an omlet...I cud not see the previously used items. There were no french fries, no baked vegetables. When I asked the floor manager, she retorted that we had ordered some 'sizzling' which is different from a 'sizzler'. On asking the waiter, he said that the platter has changed. I requested for a proper sizzler. I was made to wait for 30 odd minutes when all the waiters had a small meeting and no one bothered to serve our desk. And then had to call a waiter for the bill for the remaining food. Such a bad experience for a regular customer ! Disgusting ! They change platter randomly, but their floor manager is not aware off ! And they expect me to believe that lie ! I rarely comment/rate in Zomato but this one was needed. Customer service sucks in Scoop ! And they give u some random dish and they tell lies about a platter-change. If the platter has changed, why is the customer not informed before the service ? Disgusting ! Wasted my one hour for naut ! I wud hv rated this place negative...had there been an option to...(Mind u..my previous rating was 5 when I had first visited this place). I have seen this place deteriorate over a year ! Time to search for a better sizzler in Kolkata ! I m done with Scoop !

The only thing worth your attention is the spunky interiors! Many seating arrangements are here.There are many waiters,they've also waitress.The quality of the food is good not excellent.We tasted here Paper Masala Dosa,The taste of Dosa is good.Their Ice-Creams are famous.It‚Äôs very noisy too!

So after a long time I was back to Kolkata. And neither for the fish nor the chicken's leg, but for something green ,something veggie. After loving all the Chinese food around , I settled for lunch at Scoop. Straight away I ordered crispy chilli babycorn , my favorite, and also because I wanted to compare it with one of the better ones I had at another restaurant. Had I gone by the reviews here, I would have definitely ordered the usual good ones here, but I settled for a different menu. I ordered Cheese masala Dosa and Onion uttapam as the main course dishes. I was not alone, have a tiny tummy.
Chilly babycorn- Disaster No.1 , It wasn't even properly cooked!!! Some were tender , some hard, some were fresh, some tasted stale, and to add to the woes, the quantity was an awful lot. Not that I would have complained had it been good.
Onion uttapam- Someone forgot to add the salt maybe. Now that's the most embarassing review for a chef ,I guess.Second disaster
Cheese Masala Dosa- Just putting cheese ,masala inside the dosa: that's how they define it here. I have never tried this item. i don't know if the cheese is supposed to stay and taste alongwith the masala or just like the lumps of masala and cheese as it tasted. but whatever it was, this takes the count to disaster no. 3.
Net result: The hangover of my comfort food -Schewan momo I had before this was lost , and huh, I had to write this review

Was far better earlier. Has lost its charm in being more of a restaurant rather than a ice cream bar. Ice cream sundaes were their specialty. But now its worse than earlier. Sizzlers r good still. Rest is average.

Located near the bustling and jostling New Market area Scoop is a pet favourite among the shoppers, window shoppers as well as college students. I will attribute the reason to the variation of cuisine that the place has to its customers. Chinese, Continental and North Indian are some of the fundamental cuisines that go down well with the gourmet as well as the not-so foodie. The combo meals are a great option if one is looking for cost-cutting yet enjoying a meal. But the quality of the food didn‚Äôt go down with me well. The quality of food and the pricing is just done. The only thing you can savour to your delight is the sundaes. If you are tired after a strenuous shopping spree and have a hearty good quality meal in a serene ambience, then it‚Äôs better to safely avoid Scoop. It‚Äôs very noisy too! The only thing worth your attention is the spunky interiors!

Just back home fresh from my first visit at Scoop. The location is fantastic... very easy to find. What hooked my attention when I entered the place was the decor. Simple yet elegant; especially the smart way lighting has been used over here. It gives you a very 'posh' feel.

Ice creams are famous over here... so I stuck to the basics. Ordered a Moon Rocker Sundae (I LOVE butterscotch) and a Cran Cooler Pink Me Chiller. They tasted pretty satisfying, but were quite pricey too.

Final Verdict: The rest of the menu looked tempting & I'm sure you'll find it hard to resist yourself from ordering other items once you're here. So my advice for you is to carry some extra bucks. It definitely looked like one of those places which will turn out to be your favorite hangout zones.

Located in the same building as the more popular Kfc,Barista,Dominos the thing about this particular place that will draw your attention and make you want to give this place a try is its colourful and funky decor.At least it was so in my case.
I visited this place for the first time about 4-5 yrs ago.Back then I used to love their ice creams and sundaes.They were excellent and very decently priced too.The main course items were not as good but decent nonetheless.The menu was also quite varied.
After quite a long time,I visited this place again yesterday thanks to the heavy rain.I was surprised to see that the menu had become even more extensive.It contained alomost everything ranging from North Indian to South Indian to Chinese to Pizzas to Burgers to even Continental items.Since we were not too hungry and it was just the two of us,we ordered a Chicken ala king and  a chocolate shake.The chocolate shake was quite nice.But the chicken ala king was quite a disappointment.It took quite a long time to arrive and when it finally did arrive we were amazed at the quantity.It was pitifully small.The taste was also not the greatest.And to make matters worse,the price was quite high.In fact the prices have had a significant hike and it is higher than the menu on zomato.Unfortunately,I felt that while the prices have gone one way,the quality of the food has gone the other way.
Coming to the ambience,as I mentioned already,it has a uniquely colourful and funky decor.It is may be a bit too colourful.It is the first thing you would notice about the place.They provide seating in chairs which are colourful but not too comfortable.The place is always crowded and there is always a busy feel about the place which for me makes it quite unsuitable for fine dining or a date.Its quite okay though if you visit in a group.The staff are friendly but the service is on the slower side except the desserts and sundaes.
Overall I feel this is a place which has a lot of potential.But at present,if at all I were to make a recommendation about this place I would suggest the sundaes and desserts only.

Ambiance - The lighting is a little too flashy for my taste. Also the staff chatter a lot trying to manage people. One has to wait for a few minutes before getting a seat because the place is almost usually full. The seating is okayish with plastic chairs to sit which are a little uncomfortable.
Food - The food is reasonably priced. A long list of preparations were available in the menu. Ordered a pizza which tasted good and was filling. Will have to visit again to try out more from their menu.

Scoop is located in building that also hosts the new empire amidst that busy new market area. It used to be on the agenda when there weren't many multiplexes and new empire used to showcase the few english movies that would realease here and there weren't any kfc or a dominos nearby. Its got a colorful decor but very okayish. The seats are not so comfortable for me atleast. The staff service is not so great either.

The menu is elaborate and one could get almost anything like north indian, chinese, italian, burgers, sizzlers, ice creams................But i would stick to their ice creams and sundaes alone 2 years back but now even for the ice creams i would go for a cream and fudge counter located just in front of scoop.

The prices are not so reasonable compared to the park street restaurants. The quality of food is very ok for such prices. I find the chinese food pretty average, sizzlers below average. indian food is ok though. The burger is the fat old indianised one which is ok but nothing as compared to one served at cafe corner at similar price. Ice cream sundaes make up for the damage done but not so much to warrant another visit.

This is our best college days hit out. As our college is situated near the new market area we went there often and still now we go there if we go to the new market area. 

Nice decent colorful decor  and very noisy, though it was not an issue ever as we went there as a group. this place offers you with multi cuisine delicacies and very quality sundaes.  very reasonable for a college students. I never suggest any one to search for a privacy outing there. go there if u r in a casual , and party mood. 

waiters are very decent and helpful . service is quick  and one little  secret- they most of the time gives you a bill which is always the amount you estimated in your mind. 

Overall this place is a nice place to hang out with friends. 
I rate this place 3.5 out of 5.

Scoop is the cutest and coziest place I have ever visited to. The food is up to the mark with very helpful staff. They have good variety of food and deserts starting from chinese, Mughlai, continental and Indian. The ambience is cool with some nice glass designs and funky interiors which is attracting.  Mostly you will find this place to packed up and you will hardly find place becuse of its fine location. I have visited this place N number of times and have tried all cusines but there chinese and Indian is the best and the famous ice creams are always awesome. You wil never have to think about the prices because its very low. Love to visit this place again and again.

Scoop....a blistering experience altogether...in the midst of some true cherished moments of desire.It was an afternoon when we visited the place for a quick fill...ordered for a basket of chicken nuggets and mixed chowmein...of course, requesting many time to busy-for-nothing waiters and attendants...the nuggets came with good looking serving and munchy chips thrown into it...but, to my utter surprise..the nuggets were not fresh, not even sauted well before frying...on immediate disposal of this fact, the people of 'Scoop' tried to tell that I never ever tasted nuggets and nuggets do taste like this...although the chowmein was good...the ambiance was delighting with so much colour and lights...but too much noisy like any disco...if at all their behaviour could have been courteous...I would have thought of returning back to the place...

once you are in the humayun place admist the foodstalls,kfc,barista,dominos,the colourful decor from outside is too eye catcatching to draw one here for a try.but once you get seated,the ambience looses much of its charm.they seating is not very comfortable on the plastic seats and sofas like the one we get in kfc which is next to it and is almost always over crowded like a fish market.next coming to the food which is price moderately,they serve multicuisine including indian,chinese,continental,south indian and deserts with nice combo offers.i tasted chicken pizza which was nice.my father is fond of their haka noodles.chinese side dishes ar well made.mostly pastas and lasagna in the menu are unavailable.my friends like the sundae As you like it,which can be shared by 2-3 people and you get 5 scoops of flavours of ur choice with fruits,nuts and choclate sauce.chocolate lovers,do try out their dark temptation ;-)

My experience is not good at scoop. I heard a lot about it from some people. There was no ambiance. It seems same as a small resturant in locals. The waiters were not that great. There behaviour depends on the order. Glasses were not clean and so are the plates. 
Food was not that great and rather I will mark it as below average.

Went here years back and was a regular. Loved their ice creams and I remember having a five scoop ice cream which used to be great. The place did not have an awesome ambience to be honest but then we are talking about atleast 10 years back. To be honest, I have tried most of the ice creams available and they are all very good. The prices are decent too. Looks like now they've refurbished the place. The menu looks as good and ever and I would love to be back soon.

Scoop in New Empire, Kolkata delivers a fantastic ambiance with a beautiful decor. Food is absolutely palatable. Food and Beverage service was very fluent and smooth especially the young lady named Seema Singh  came out very smart and intelligent with a sound knowledge about what she is serving to her guest.

Best of luck & would like to visit again to give pleasure to my palate.

Known to have a wide range of ice-cream, I was quite eager to try it out first hand, but was in for a major disappointment. I have would not be able to comment much about the food there as I wasn't there for long - especially due to the unprofessional behavior of the staff out there. The behavior of the staff depends on how much you have ordered, and since we were just to have ice-creams, we did not get to see the better side of it. They were in a tearing hurry to get us out of there - at one point of time, things went out of hand, and when we threatened to leave, they were absolutely cool with it. The manager did not even show up when we asked to see him/her. Definitely not recommended!

3) The colourful, but not too bright atmosphere, is a turn on. (Makes us feel younger and nostalgic)
4) Staff is good - quite attentive
5) Not so posh. So you can eat and chat with your companion (s) in your own way
6) Perfect location
7) The seating arrangements are fine

Scoop is the perfect choice for anyone who goes to Esplanade area frequently and fancies an affordable tasty meal if he or she feels ravenous about it.

I don't recommend chicken nuggets. Try the light, soft and palatable kebabs there (my personal favourite). You may try the cold nourishments available there too, especially, in summer.

Visited Scoop's on Paila Baishaik(bengali new yr),15th april.enjoyed the cheese dosa and pulao with mutton rogangosh.Their tutti frutti icecream was worth it.But to add to all this was the service of a waiter(JOYPROKASH NARU) who was very obliging and sweet and touched us.A good evening we had .

I had been to Scoop so many times and its service has gone bad to worse...There is one offer which has been going on for a month called pay once eat twice..where u need to show a previous bill to avail the offer for free...well when u go there to eat twice or thrice the waiters and waitress behave  callously as if u r under their charity...even they question u regarding the bills(can it get more worse ).. ' what we had last day ???'...or 'we r d ones who had food last day or not ??? '...suspecting us to be god knows what  !!!..been there on 21st of April I had been a victim of their  insulting behaviour...agitated with their behaviour I have decided that I would never visit this restaurant again in future...disappointed.!!!

After a heavy lunch, we friends wanted to have good ice cream sundaes, so we decided to go to Scoop, situated in the New Market area.This place gave child hood memories. We ordered 4 sundaes, they were all good. The best being the As you like it, which was huge with 5 scoops of different flavoured ice creams and toppings and the Dark Temptation, for all chocolate lovers, a must try. The service was quick and the captain took good care of all of us. 
However, the ambience was too colourful, a little less colours would have made the place look way better.

I had been visiting Scoop since i was in my school and lots have changed over the years. I use to be a regular visitor until last year and would take lunch and diner say five to six time a month but i would regret going in there again. First of all the interior looks like some of the cheap railway station eateries now and the place it too noisy as if seating in a over crowded train. Food was good some time back but now the quality has gone and some time we were served dishes with stale meat which the staff call it too much garnishing or like that...... and i once fell ill due to this. A couple of year back they really had nice stuffs and hospitality but now they have recruited some worthless female stuff who approach you once you step in as if you got into some five star hotel and are at the receiving end of you. The music is too loud and have no environment of privacy and talk. Other than ice cream and snacks you have got nothing to hover around. 
I would never suggest this place to anyone who really wants to enjoy their food as well as the company of their loved ones with good environment as this place has lost its worth over the last year and on.
I feel sad and really miss those good old days of my time with my friends and loved ones enjoying at Scoop.
Stuff and hospitality needs great attention and also the environment.

I went there the other day for Nostalgia's sake and was thoroughly disappointed. The entire place stank of fish... more specifically, fried fish which had gone slightly stale before frying and hence smelled when it was being fried. We sat down and after 10 minutes one female waitress came in and took our order with all the snootiness of the Queen of Sheba. Needless to say, we were not impressed. We ordered a pasta and a fried chicken dish because we were hungry, and the girl told us repeatedly about some stuff or the other, which were more expensive. When we told her firmly we wanted this order, she was quite rude and flounced off. 

After 10 minutes, she got our food in, and my friend was dismayed to see the measly five small pieces of chicken in the plate with 2 cucumber and 1 slice of carrot. For 150/- or so, she did not expect this. On the other hand, the pasta was decently proportioned. 

The bad part came after this - halfway down our meal, the waitress actually put down the bill in front of us. This was clearly bad manners, and we could see that the restaurant still had at least 4 empty tables, and there was no reason for her to be rude. Annoyed, we paid, and marched away. Sorry but I am not coming back here.

The decor is trendy,the waiters polite,the food is good but not excellent. The hot chocolate there tasted like bournvita to me,but the chicken lasagne was delicious! The service isnt too quick,and while other some restaurants hand over the bill while you're eating,here it took them a full 10 minutes to give the bill. I've been eating here since a child,and though the new decor is okay,but the chairs aren't comfortable and I prefer the marble seats they had before!

What can you say about Scoop? The place has been around for ages... It was the "go-to" place for amazing Sundaes... the perfect place to take your kids out for a treat after catching a movie or shopping at New Market... The "As you like it" with 5 scoops of ice-cream of your choice is a definite favourite!

The snacks on offer are quite nice, especially the cheese burgers and chicken gold coin.  My only advice to the owners would be to do something about the interiors... It used to look very classy. Now the less said about the decor, the better. However, for me, it will always be the sundaes that I would go back for.. Granted, the portions have reduced over the years, but they have kept the pricing reasonable.

You go to new market for shopping and you feel like dropping into some place to eat, the place should definitely be scoop. The have a wide variety of items on the menu card- soup for the winters, ice-creams and cold drinks for the summers. They have things for proper lunch, dinner and very cheap too. Drop in at any time you wan and you will definitely get the best to munch on.
One of my friends had told me about scoop and that's why I dropped in. The interiors are too lively, the staff is quite responsive and best of all the food tastes amazing. We had ordered a Veg Club sandwich+coke+french fries combo. The sandwich had the best herbs in it and the perfect mix of all spices. It seemed as if it was tailored for my taste buds. It was the best I ever had.The french fries were amazing- perfect colour, perfect aroma and the perfect crispness. It was quite a cheap deal and we had made the most out of it.
We ended out dine out with deserts- " As you like it". The most expensive on the chart but the best.I would love coming to this place again an again.

New Empire's been around a long time, but Scoop packs quite a punch. The place is very noticeable from the outside, because of it's bright, cheery exteriors and seems to magnetically attract weary shoppers from New Market. 

The ambience is bustling, and fast. With quite a load of tables, this is the quintessential quick fast food joint. The menu has something to fit everyone - whether you're looking for a Continental bite, a long-drawn Indian meal or just a sundae - this place has all of it. The sundaes are extremely good, as are the dosas. Good food at pretty good rates, perfect to refresh oneself after a long hard day. 

The service is also pretty fast, looking at the number of patrons it gets everyday. The final verdict - a great joint to rev up the appetite, if you're tired and in the area.

I used to visit this place quite often with my friends during my school and college days. I still remember the days when New Empire and The Globe used to be the paradise for English movie buffs. The multiplex culture was not significant back then. I would be wrong if I say this place is a delight for culinary senses. This is a pretty ordinary restaurant with average food. It is an ideal place for the students to save the pocket money. The place is very noisy as well. However, unlike few other restaurants in the New Market area, it is comparatively more hygienic. You may want to try out their desserts and mocktails. You won't be disappointed. However, I would not prefer this place for a lunch or dinner if I am in Kolkata for few days. I'd be heading towards Park Street instead !! :)

This place is nothing compared to what it looks from outside. Too colorful, looks like the theme was in place, but while painting they got it all wrong! :P Food is just average, nothing to die for. We ordered one Pene Alfredo and one mixed platter sizzler. Pene alfredo was good, but a tad too cheesy.. Sizzler was just 'bout okay, surely had far better sizzlers elsewhere. Overall, maybe worth a one time visit, solely for the reason that it wont burn a hole in your pocket.

This outlet of scoop may look classy from outside but when you step in you will find it tacky & noisy.
The foods are cheap,they may serve each and every cuisine but the only good thing is ice-cream,nothing else.

the waiters are very average sometimes below average.I have visited this place 3 times and the last time I ordered a chicken hawaiwan salad,while having i was feeling something bad about it either the smell or the too much cheese in it.and the next day I started having stomach infection and food poisoning.and i really repent that i ordered some food,i should have ordered ice cream.

The place is cheap,but the utensils are not very clean.not for family dinner.

It was my first Anniversary. We had a aheavy lunch late afternoon, and was thinking of going sumwhere, Like an Ice cream parlour, For some sundaes... Thought of having Tooti Fruti, & Some shakes & taking chicken steak as a parcel for dinner. The first thing that came in my mind was "The Scoop", because I heard before that they offer Nice Icecreams. Went there but When we placed the order, the first thing we heard was a "SERVICE NO". The waiter immediately said, sorry mam we donot have icecreams today as the ice cream machine is not operating". Then we thought for a while& decided to have a strawberry shake. The second answer was "Mam we dont have Strwaberry Shake available today". Third, Chicken Steak for parcel. The answer was " Mam we dodnot offer parcel". The only thing that came in our mind was,it would be the last ever restaurant that I will be coming back again.The most worst Service ever received. Infact no service at all.

If you are not sure about your cravings, come to Scoop. This place offers you all the cuisines you are aware of. The best part is you won't feel robbed after venturing in the unknown food zone. Surprisingly the south Indian dishes are good here. Also the continental stuffs are also nice. But save the best for the end. The desserts will simply sweep you off your feet. The sundaes, the fruit mixes and the ice creams are just divine. The place is quite colorful and you'll mostly find it crowded. But once you are here, your tastes buds will surely thank you for coming here and allowing the ice creams to melt in your mouth.

Firstly I want to say a few words about its Ambiance. Ambiance is nice. Decoration is very very colorful. Very very attractive.
U can find almost everything here e.g. Chinese, Continental, Indian and desserts.
South Indian food is very good, specially Dosas.
Chinese dishes is okay. But north Indian dishes are best! Chicken preparations are also very tasty. Chilli Chicken is awesome. Tandoori Chicken is nice. Desserts are also very good and yummy. Cold Coffee and Lemon Cold Coffee are nice.
Staffs are okay but the negative part is the service. Service is very slow. We have to wait almost 30mins for delivery. 
Price is reasonable and pocket friendly.
Worth a visit.

Walking and aching our legs through shop lined lanes of the new market area , we suddenly bumped into this restro .

Firstly I must appriciate the staffs ,service and the decor ... its a 10 on 10‚ù§.
Staffs were very cordial and patient and the deco was so much cute and chicüòç.
Comming to food , the restro gives a myriad variety of eateries . Though we tried out less itms , i liked it .
We ordered mango chicken and noodles it was 4/5 on taste , tomato basil pasta with pesto sauce was also too good 4.5/5 , only black forest milk shake disappointed a bit , it was a bit flat in taste also the cake and cream given was not fresh but compared to the less cost of the itm as compared to other restro its ok .
Looking forward to go there again üòä.

After consulting our server we ordered chicken tikka and aunty lucy's fish fry. The serving time was very long despite the place not being full. We had to remind them a few times. The food though was very awesome. We needed some chutney and even for that we had to call them several times. They need to improve on this aspect. I have already asked my friends to visit this place.

Went there after a bout of christmas shopping. The place was crowded. The ambiance was sort of cute with pink lights, pink menu etc. Its situated in the New Empire building. I ordered grilled fish and cheesy white pasta. The fish was a disappointment... it was so small and did not feel grilled. The veggies ( cauliflower and broccoli) too undercooked. It came with 2 mickey mouse shaped breads. The pasta was tasty and was accompanied by garlic bread. The dessert was yummy.

The food is very tasty. They serve really quick so if you want a quick bite this is your destination. Not really a fine dining experience though. It's more of a casual cafe kind of experience. Easy on the pocket.

Place for the sweet tooth. Not only for quick bites it's appropriate for dessert cravings. It's crowded because of it's location but one can definitely try this place for a quick meet and gossip session alongside the treats in their menu.

Nice budget friendly restaurant with good sitting space. However a bit congested and service is slow. Food quality is good but quantity is not that great. Biryani and prawn sizzler are not good. So as the black forest shake. 

My recommendations: grilled chicken, chicken sizzler, fish finger. Fish fry, very cheesy pizza, scoops and fresh lime soda

Been here on last Sunday. I was immensely amazed by the ravishing decor and ambience. It has evoked a feeling of pre Christmas vibe in me as the outlet has been wonderfully decorated for Christmas and this has added more to my happiness. Now coming to the lip-smacking food and desert. I ordered for frozen coco, black forest ,chhole bhature (jumbo sized),Price is reasonable along with tax. Looking forward to visit soon .

"Chicken sizzler"
This is a regular chicken sizzler which you can enjoy after shopping in new market .Scope has the best location in new market  . Taste is very good .Chicken is soft and tender with crunchy and variety of fresh veggies .I loved that beautiful spicy rice with the gravy which became more delicious by mixing the juicy yolk of the fried egg.
Yah i am like this :)

This is not at all a place to have some good foods! Had been there with one of my friends and we were not happy with the foods they served. We ordered Grilled Chicken which was worst in taste and served cold. The chicken was not even grilled. We also ordered Chilly Garlic Basil Prawn Thai Style which was not so good as well.¬†

Most importantly, the service was poor too. The staff there were not paying attention to the guests. We had to wait for more than 15 minutes to pay the bill. I will not recommended anyone to visit this outlet.

In an area like New Market, where there are so many restaurants for dining in, Scoop is one of the best restaurants for mouth-watering Ice-creams.  A legendary outlet recognized for their Ice-creams. Have tried their sizzlers too, but the dish is very bland and prepared differently. A very lively and brightly lit place with good seating arrangements. Would love to recommend their 'As you like it' ice-cream. One can select up to 3-5 scoops of their favourite ice-creams, with a choice of fresh fruits, dry fruits and flavoured sauces. Absolutely amazing ice creams are found here, especially when one can customize their own ice-cream. A must visit for ice-cream lovers.

Scoop is a really underrated restaurant located in the heart of Esplanade in the New Empire building. Scoop is generally famous for their signature ice-cream sundays. But they also serve some pretty good food. They have a wide array of menu starting from continental to chinese to north Indian to South Indian. So you get a wide variety of choices. Try it out its really nice and inexpensive as well.

Sitting arrangements are comfortable. But some care could have been taken on the serving utensils and manners of the staffs. Otherwise its okay to go.

I've been to this place quite some time back. My friends and I got tired of shopping in New Market area and decided to drop in here. It is located at the New Empire building, right beside KFC, Domino's and Wow Momo. 

The ambience is nice. They have a good bunch of staffs who suggest you their special dishes and ice cream options. We ordered Cheese Masala Dosa and Chicken Kima Dosa. It was the first time that I had chicken dosa and I must admit that it was an excellent experience. The dosa was soooo very tasty. We also ordered Pehla Nasha from their dessert range. It had one scoop of vanilla ice-cream, one scoop of chocolate ice-cream along with a black forest pastry decorated with chocolate chips, coconut and a cherry. It was simply amazing in taste. Do try this one when you visit them.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: Rs. 500 for two

"0" for their service as no one bothers to care and ask you if we need anything throughout your stay, not even water unless you call them 2 or 3 times. Good food but over priced as the quantity served is not so sufficient. One of our orders had murg tikka makhni which was served with just 4 small size chicken pcs with gravy.

It's been quite some time since I visited this place(sorry to say, the pic isn't from the last time we went there). This is a nice place to opt for when you decide to splurge for some occasion but since I didn't taste their actual food, I can't really vouch for it. Over a span of several dates and birthdays, I've dropped in this place. The ambiance isn't too quaint but serene enough to enjoy a romantic date and also chic enough to crowd in the seats and spend the time with a group of people.

I've had their Cold Cafe Frappe, As You Like It, Pehla Nasha, some other cold coffee variants and 'scoop' offerings! Nothing is above average but the place is ideal over a scoop or two to scrape every other minute while you catch up with friends.

If you're famished, you can find better places in the vicinity but if it's to spend time with someone and you're near this place, don't give a second thought.

Located in the New Market area, this place is famous for their ice creams and deserts and for the right reasons.
While my visit there with my friend I ordered the Dark Temptation. A mix of chocolate and vanilla ice cream with brownie on the top can never taste bad. And the additional wafers are always appreciated. The brownie just melts into your mouth giving a hint of dark chocolate right before you dive in for the ice creams. I really enjoyed it and would definitely order this again sometime.

My friend had a Big Boy shake and it's one of those shakes that are presented so beautifully that you almost hesitate to destroy it by putting it in your mouth. But once you do it tastes absolutely amazing. While I had only a bit from my friend for tasting, I could tell by the way he was eating it that it was an enjoyable experience. 

The staffs were good and the ambience is also okay and nothing to complain on that front. 
So overall I really enjoyed my time here and would like to go back again sometime and recommend others to visit as well.

Scoop is famous for serving ice creams at a pocket pinch rate and for the lovely decor. This place is located on the ground floor of new empire building, beside KFC. This place is very close to my heart cause I went on my first date with my fiance. We ordered 'Tik Tok Murgh' which is spicy preparation of chicken. It contains 3 medium size@ pieces of chicken and ordered 'Pahela Nasha' which contains 1scoop of valina ice cream and one scoop of chocolate ice cream with black forest cake along with nuts and cherry on the top..

Can't count the number of times I have visited this place owing to its location in New Market. Mostly crowded, the place is pretty loud for my choice. Average interiors. The butter masala dosa is good in taste and quantity. The biryani combo is a disaster though at the price. Special mixed fried rice was one dish I particularly liked  paired with chicken hot garlic. The mutton dopiaza and butter naan are nothing to go gaga over. And as for desert, I ordered a one called Love and Disaster- the love was so in disguise that all we saw was the disaster. Courteous but extremely late service from the staff.
At the prices charged, the service is surely wanting.
The only saving grace of the place is the Rosa which is value for money.

I loved this small parlor near new market area.It's really a good place with lots of combos and ice creams. I went there with my friends during pujo.Even at that time the quality served is good.We tried Chicken keema Dosa which is astounding great dosa I ever eaten.It became my instant favorite. Along with that I tasted chola batura which is good also.The combos I tasted were fried rice and chilli chicken. Its also pretty okay.But I feel the amount is quite less at that price. Servicing of the combos order required nearly one hour which is pretty irritating.Anyways,it's a good cozy place to satisfy your appetite.Don't think much and taste at least one dosa :) You'll love it!! *_*

Everything is overpriced. The food is not that good. Some of them come free with hair too. And when they change that item with a freshly made one i don't know how that same item turns out smaller in size. My friend had ordered a chicken keema dosa which contained a strand of hair. On complaining they changed the dosa but somehow it turned out smaller in size. Not like he had consumed a big chunk of the initial order too. Moreover the keema was filled with ground bones. Maybe that comes complimentary too.
We had also ordered French fries with cheese and chicken. The same problem with the chicken. I don't know where they get their chicken keema from. But maybe the management doesn't know that bone free chicken keema is readily available in the market. In fact that is the only sort of chicken keema found unless you shove a whole chicken into a mixer grinder and grind it. The fries were half burnt and the cheese....we had to dig up the cheese buried inside the dish.
The only dish worth mentioning was the Aglio Olio. A bit oily but it is prepared with olive oil so not unhealthy entirely. The pasta was perfectly boiled and al dente. The dish was well seasoned too.
I'm sure everyone who has visited New Market has seen this place at least once therefore i did not bother writing about the location. However the staff is quite friendly here and helpful although half of the time they are missing.

Went to have some refreshment here but the waiters and the atmosphere made us even more tired. The service was the worst, no one came to take our orders for about 15 mins until we called someone. We ordered some drinks and ice cream which were cool and refreshing. But many items on the menu weren't available, this being another reason for the low rating! The restaurant is almost always crowded isn't somewhere you would want to go if you want to eat in peace.

Visited this place almost near to their closing hours after a long walk from sealdah to esplanade. The place was pretty empty. Ordered an Ice cream float and a Pehla Nasha ice cream. The float was delivered wrong and upon informing they changed it promptly. The Pehla nasha ice cream stole our hearts the moment it arrived. Both the looks and taste of the ice cream was good. 
The ambience of this age old shop has also improved a lot after they revamped it. Particularly the numerous mirrors and the cute cat watches add a special zing to the place. Cash and card accepted. Nice place to visit when in the esplanade area...

Located in the heart of New Market, this is one of the restaurants which is busy n filled all round the year. It has got a wide range of cuisine and menu to choose from which makes it a great public attraction. The interiors are decorated with pretty pinks n lights, perfect for kids. Visited on a Saturday afternoon and had to wait for 10mins before we got our table. Ordered a few dishes. The first being fish in garlic butter sauce, which was served with mashed potatoes and very cute garlic bread. The next up was the mutton thali, with mutton curry, tandoori roti and raita. The quantity of this particular dish was disappointing. Next up was the kebab platter which was reshmi kebabs and herb rice, both of which lacked salt to my taste. The last dish of the day was lamb sizzler, which was a clear winner among the rest. The meat pieces were well cooked, soft n succulent, served with a portion of herb rice. The rice and the gravy complemented each other. Then we tried their shakes, strawberry and dark forest shake to be precise. The dark forest shake had crumbs of cake  in it, both of which was served with whipped cream n cookies. Would visit again to try cuisines maybe.

It was on the occasion of Durga puja night that me and my wife chose to go to a less crowded restaurant to try out continental cuisine.... we ordered fish finger...it was served with crispy chips n mustard sauce..pretty good to start on with..in addition to that we took fresh lime soda..besides this we ordered fried chicken in Thai chilli basil sauce-utterly disappointing that was over fried and it was sooo salty that we could not had more than one each...on complaining ,the waiter suggested to take it as parcel instead of replacing it. Next came the main course which comprised of grilled fish in butter garlic sauce,mixed veggie n lemon rice- the same problem persisted ...we cald upon the waiter and told him strait that even the latter dish was also too salty to eat..the waiter instead of solving the problem..started making arguments that it was not possible that both the dishes could have the same problem...it spoilt our puja night... probably would never visit again...very disappointing indeed!!

I have heard a lot about Scoop from my friends & naturally wanted to visit this place. And I was a little disappointed. No. Quite disappointed.

We ordered-
Mutton roganjosh
Kashmiri pullao
Tandoori roti

Average food. Outstandingly slow service.
Only thing I liked about Scoop was the elaborate use of the color pink in their decor!

I will probably not visit Scoop again.
Well no..I may..to give the desserts a try!
Let's see!

Happy eating üòä

I used to be a regular at this place... The decor looks bright.. But a bit haphazard... Their pan fried momos are my favourite here.. The rest of the food is okayish.. I love the way they serve the icecreams.. The service is really poor.. Very disorganized staff.. They spontaneously serve 3-4 tables and they forget your order...you have to remind some other attendant about your order and then wait some more... And sometimes you blink and your order is there... They need to work on training their staff in proper co-ordination to avoid delay and confusion..

Scoop is located in New market. Interiors are decent with an attractive ambience. Price too seemed reasonable. Went there with a friend few months back and we decided to have continental. We had grilled chicken , stuffed chicken and a puppy love for dessert. The grilled chicken came with mashed potatoes, the stuffed chicken had some boiled vegetables on the side along with some sauce. Both were tasty. Coming to the dessert we had puppy love which was okayish . Overall it was a nice experience going there.

Scoop is a mandatory visit for me, when I choose New market as my shopping hub for Puja and other occasions. This place is not that big and spacious,but I like the ambience. It's always a bit over-crowded,but that's okay. The staff are polite and helpful. The food catalogue has a nice range...smoothies, mocktails to sizzlers and Chinese delicacies and various snacks. The food is extremely delicious. And your treat to your stomach can never end without the final scoop of icecream ‚ò∫

The best thing about this place is it is very spacious, which explains the fact that it's almost always full because of it's location of course. Anyway, after some tiresome shopping it was indeed a lovely treat to visit this place. 3.5 because of the management which I believe could have been better. Now food, we had so cheesy pizza regular, it was cheesy and unlike many other normal places the crust was soft and nice. Vanilla float which was good. I had float for the first time and liked it. Kit kat shake really really lovely.. This place is also a must visit.

Visited this popular kitschily decked restaurant in the afternoon after a shopping spree at New Market. Interior is decorated with a riot of colors, bird cage, owl on a tree branch, paper dragonflies from ceiling, watering can sprouting flowers, pictures etc.
We had the Love & Disaster, which came in a boat-shaped glass dish on a dainty doily and adorned with a pretty paper umbrella. The dessert item consisted of three ball-shaped scoops of Blind Love ice cream, drizzled with chocolate sauce and garnished with two chocolate wafers, cashew nuts and topped with a red cherry. It tasted well, enough for two people to indulge in some sweet affair.
For lunch and exquisite-looking desserts and shakes a good choice in the area.

Going to new market before pujas, is a must for everyone. And hence this place remains crowded and full almost always. 

It's a huge area, with decent interiors. The menu is pretty much. You can order whatver your heart desires. The variety is a lot. 
We weren't much hungry, so just ordered a soft drink and Dark temptation sundae. 
The sundae was made of ice cream scoops, and brownies and nuts. Tastes pretty normal. Nothing special.
Service is a bit slow.
They took almost 30-40 mins to get us the ice cream.

It was one of my favourite places, until today. The justification of 4* is that this place has always made me happy in the past. There was a Mango festival going on when I happened to visit Scoop the last time and the two dishes that I ordered were absolutely amazing. With the same expectation I visited today, but alas! I was let down. The place is always too crowded but today even the staff was too busy.

We ordered the following:

Tik Tok Murg: Plain chicken tikka on the mint sauce.

The Majesty: A regular chicken biryani.

Puppy Love: It was as expected and nothing extraordinary. Scoops of ice-cream with whipped cream and gems.

Divine Chocolate: It was supposed to be a best seller but unfortunately the last was just too ordinary. There was nothing divine about the chocolate cake and even the dish was not very clean.

Overall it's a good place but today it was not the Scoop I always admired.

Terrible experince.Went there and ordered Thali Style around 8:30 pm. After about 5 minutes, I ordered Half Tandoori Murg. They served the tandoori Murg around 9 pm. It was way below standard. The chicken, the raita everything was bland.
From here on, began my mind-numbingly long and tedious wait for the main course. During the course of nearly another half an hour, I sat and starved and was border-line ignored by the waiting staff during my repeated enquiries about the remainder of my order.  At around 9:30, I was forced to call the waiter and ask for my  bill on what I have consumed as it was getting late. The waiter checked and informed me that they had not even registered my order of Thali Style, let alone convey it to the kitchen! 
This has to be a new mile-stone in poor quality of service. Thanks a lot Scoop for ruining my evening and wasting an hour of my life.

Ambience~ Pleasant. Loved the lightings, music and decors. As it is located in Esplanade area, so the place remains crowded most of the time. The best part is that they keep girl staffs too. 

We ordered for~
1. Oreo Cookie Milkshake : Well, to me, it was not upto the mark. It tastes awkward like someone just mixed a lot of sugar in the water. 
2. Black Forest Milkshake : Heavenly! Way to my heart literally. It tastes sooo good. A must try.

Today visited this restaurant for lunch in New market area after a tiring shopping. It was around 2.30 pm and the place was almost full. The dining area was quite big with nice decorations. Our today's food journey includes,
* Starter : Chicken Nuggets
* Main Course : Biriyani with Chilly Chicken Combo
* Drinks : Pepsi
The service was quite fast. The food arrived altogether in a few minutes. Firstly the Chicken Nuggets tasted as usual good. 8 PCs of Nuggets were served with chips. Biriyani and chilli chicken combo also tasted decent. Biriyani was just simple and chilli chicken was good. 6 PCs of chicken was served in the combo. Quantity was more than enough for feeding single person. Only one thing that I didn't like at all they served the biriyani and chilli chicken together in a bowl, so that the gravy was all mixed up with the rice. It would be better if they serve the biriyani and the chilli chicken separately. Otherwise the foods were pretty good. Prices were on higher side. They also charged 18% GST on the total amount. Our bill for two persons was 791 RS. You can give it a try once.

Sitting inside a what looks like a colourful assortment of jellybeans, this restaurant destroyed our lunch quite efficiently. We ordered:

1. Tik Tok Murg (festive special) - 2‚≠êÔ∏è
[Nothing special about this variant of kebab, 3 pcs in a small bowl with a slice of lemon. Guess the only thing special about this was that the pieces were actually on top of the green dip. So, even if you didn't want to have the dip, tough luck my friend]

2. Grilled prawn (in garlic butter sauce, bread rolls & veggies) - 1‚≠êÔ∏è
[Starting with getting us the wrong order (rice instead of bread rolls), being casually unapologetic about it, and the frozen prawn being dry and tough AF, this dish was a dismal failure]

3. As You Like It (classic sundae) - 2‚≠êÔ∏è
[They served the 3 scoops of ice cream along with the prawns. So, eventually by the time we had finished the prawn and planning to move to the dessert, it was already about 70% molten]

Amazingly understaffed, I personally had to go up to the counter to ask for the welcoming glasses of water. The food came in either at distant interval, or, as in the case of the dessert, not following any logical order.

A definite 1‚≠êÔ∏è for this place, keep it up üëçüèΩ

This cafe cum dessert parlour is located in the busy streets of New Market area. It's crowded almost all the time due to the location. Whenever I go for shopping at Esplanade I manage to drop in here. The desserts here are to die for. I order Banana split, Moon rocker which gives 3 scoops of butterscotch and one scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocochips, chocolate sauce and nuts. The mocktails are also nice here. You can get a whole variety of cuisines from Vada pav to Chinese and Mughlai. I ordered Crispy chili babycorn and chicken cutlets. I have also had Puri and bhatora. The food is very tasty and the portions are huge. But this place is a little pricey but the food is worth it anyway. The ambience is very colorful and vibrant. It's spacious and won't take much time to get a table. The service is prompt. If you haven't yet visited this place, this recommendation is for you.

A vast place. You can play football here. Went in for the first time. Great ambience. One plus point - they keep girls as staffs. It is these girls who carry and deliver orders. Wonderful. Being a popular joint it was very crowded. But I managed to find a place there. I chose crispy chilly babycorn and masala Pepsi.
Masala Pepsi arrived first. The best masala drink I have tasted in recent years. Babycorn was too crispy.

Price was pocket friendly. I must mention that girls are the assets of the joint. I must mention Sangita and Sanju. Very hard working, both of them. Shall visit again.

‚óè Good Place to hangout.
‚óè Good Food, not in quantity.
‚óè Not so Pocket Friendly.
‚óè Staff Behaviour : Good

Been there a lot of times, one of the childhood's favourite place, one can choose any thing from fries to burgers to shakes to icecreams to pasta to chinese dishes. A wide collection of options of foods and desserts! 

Specially the apple shaped chairs near the doors are my favourite from childhood days.

Food Ordered and tasted here:

Grilled Chicken + Smashed Potatoes with Butter Garlic Sauce : Chicken Pieces were not up to the mark but properly cooked. SMASHED POTATOES was very dry, not good. The Butter Garlic Sauce was good enough to save the dish.

Mississippi Mud: Though the name suggests something huge like Mississippi but alas, it will only disaappoint you because it is nothing but a scoop of chocolate icecream. Expected more, got very little.

Scoop is a restaurant situated in near New Market area beside Domino's. The interior decor of this restaurant is really very nice and the seating arrangements and the background music is good. The restaurant serves amazing sundaes and ice-creams and shakes along with main course foods.

Now coming to the food. We have ordered for-

1) Jap Chicken and Noodles combo ( It was good in taste. Nothing extra ordinary and the proportion of food is good for one)

2) Barbeque Chicken Sandwich ( I personally did not like this sandwich. The Barbeque sauce was so runny and the chicken pieces were a bit smelly, chewy and felt like they were stale)

3) Cr√©m√© brulee flavoured ice cream( I loved the way they presented that one scoop of ice-cream in a small tea cup and a chocolate wafer stick. The ice cream was good)

4) First Love ( It was also an ice cream scoop and tasted of caramel and chocolate with small pieces of nuts. I liked this one also)

5) Kit kat shake ( Lovely presentation. I am sorry to say but this was so bad in taste. I felt like I was having some bitter chocolate flavoured water. I doubt whether there was any milk in that milkshake and the only good thing about this is the presentation and those two little small pieces of kitkat)

Service is slow and staffs are courteous but unprofessional in behaviour. We have to ask for water several times as they don't serve water unless you ask them too. Food quality and taste nothing much worth mentioning. Ice-creams are the only good things here. Hope to visit there someday to grab a scoop of some good ice cream.

The food is great. The service is very good. One needs to wait a bit but I can safely say that the food is veery FRESH. We ordered:

Sweet baby corn
Chicken Hakka noodles
Masala Pepsi
Chocolate ice cream

Have to say each item was prepared very well without being too much spicy or blunt. The Hakka noodles stands out amongst the lot. Very smooth and fresh noodles and vegetables with chicken and egg. What I liked most was soy sauce was subtly used in the noodles. Many restaurants uses too much soya sauce which kills the taste overall. The sweet and spicy corn was excellently cooked with a tangy taste. The masala Pepsi was just pespi and JAL jeera but went well overall with the food. A special mention about the ambience..someone did a good job with this. Many thanks

The food tastes pretty good, there is also a variety of items to choose from, but the service is bad, I had to sit for around 10 minutes before somebody could come up to take the order, the service staff should also change their behavior, the ambience along with the decorations give a very homely feeling but it's too noisy inside.
Overall it's a ok place for eating out with the family.

May the best place to grab a munch at New market.

Ambiance of this place is colourful and pretty appealing.

Whenever you feel hungry while shopping at the heart of the city you can hopped into this place.

They serve quite a huge range of food.

We went there in the Evening
Ordered
CHICKEN Jungle Sandwich - this is pretty awesome.
3 layer of bread grilled with ample stuffing of CHICKEN, meyo, vegis and poached egg.taste awesome . Worth every bit of your penny u spent.

Cold coffee with Vanilla Ice cream : this was average not served the way we expected,it was ok.

Service was promt and good.

So If you are craving for snacks while you are at New Market then this is the place...

This place is famous for their ice cream sundae you can try those if you want.

I had always passed by this restaurant but never had a chance to go inside. I did a few days ago, and was really happy with my experience. Food is very good in terms of quality and quantity. Excellent staff. Very professional. Only complaint I have is that the eatery offers free wi-fi, but when I asked about the password, the waiter said he will tell me in a while. It seemed he was going to consult somebody. Weirdly, he never returned with the password.
As for ambience, it's too colorful for my taste. I would like to go there again to try their huge food and drinks menu.

Quite a find. A multi cuisine restaurant with Chinese, Italian, South Indian, North India, and Burgers and finger food. One of the highlights is the multitude of variety of dosas available. I had a Mutton keema dosa, which was good. Good, not great. The keema was way too dry and brittle to be scooped up properly in every bite of the dosa. To top it, the refusal to add a layer of omelette to the dosa came across as surprising. "Our SAP wont allow it, no matter the price" is something you dont get to hear everyday in a hospitality location. The desserts were great though, especially the Mango Lassi and the three flavour ice cream sundae. Loved it.

Scoops has been in my bucket list since long . They are well known for the varieties of milkshake they offer . Visited the joint on one Sunday evening . The interior is quite vibrant and catchy . But ordering was time consuming since the staffs were quite busy . I  ordered for BlackForest milkshake along with chicken cheese burger . The shake was extremely sweet but fulfilling and the chicken cheese burger is just overrated üòè

Other than ice creams I really like their chicken kima dosa which is a bit different then the usual dosa.. it gives a twist to this authentic South Indian dish which is kind of cool..

Shopping is a tiring task and there's no place to go better than Scoop when hunger strikes amidst all the bargaining at New Market! The place is as colourful as possible and you'll never find it empty (at least I never did!). They nearly serve everything! From pizza to biriyani. So whatever you want to have, they will definitely have it in their menucard. 

I'm a fan of their milkshakes and desserts. The kitkat shake looks lovely but doesn't taste as great as it looks. The burnt onion with chicken curry combo is good and the quantity is more than sufficient for a single person. I've tried their chicken bharta which tastes great but the quantity is not enough for two people. 

To sum up, this place has always been my go-to place whenever I go for shopping at new market. Drop in to quench your thirst or end your hunger with your shopping bags!!

This is the best place to eat out after shopping at New Market. I wonder how I had missed this one earlier despite being a regular in that area.

Location- Beside KFC, Opposite Shreeram Arcade

Interior-
Very well decorated, with colourful lights. Pleasing ambience. We were lucky enough to visit this place when the ground floor was full due to the Eid Rush at New Market, and were taken upstairs. The first floor is an even more calm place, with light-lined glass walls, so that you can see the outside clearly.

Food-
the Continental Cuisine is great here. A huge menu. We ordered:
1. Royal Treat Pizza (regular): The size was decent enough and the pizza was so soft and tender, laden with cheese. Even the sides were mellow, which you don't get at Dominos. The Pizza was served on a wooden utensil.
2. Stuffed Chicken: This was a pure delight. Stuffed with great fillings and served with mashed potatoes and vegetables, it is great to serev two as a side dish.
3.Pehla Nasha: We were just planning to try a dessert and this one's name was attracting us a lot. It is a creamy pastry with milky cream on top and two dollops of yummy ice cream on both sides. What came as a huge but pleasant SURPRISE was that the dessert was served alongside a sparkler candle which sparkled for just a few minutes( fortunately).

Facilities- Free Wifi

Scoops is an all time favorite, located at the heart of New Market. We come here often to grab a quick bite or kill some time. Everything ranging from the food to the ambiance to the service, is praiseworthy. The place is quite spacious and can accommodate a lot of people on a busy day. The staff is polite and quick at what they do, haven't faced any rude or indecent behaviour till date. The menu has a lot to choose from and the food is worth every penny spent. We ordered a Chocolate Milkshake, Cold Coffee, Chilli Babycorn, Creamy Baked Fish and Grilled Chicken with Mashed Potatoes. These were good choices on our part and we enjoyed our food throughout. Standard bill for two people - 1k approximately. Looking forward to come here again very soon.

Food quality- about the food quality I must have to say quality with quantity good and fresh food I almost visit here by every week so I've tasted almost every food the provides all are just awesome at reasonable price tag, but my dear friends if you are looking for biryani then you'll be dissatisfied because this biryani is not similar to regular biryanis which are served in the most of biryani hubs

Ice cream - the most charming and the marvels the main course that makes scoop is there ice cream
the ice creams of scoop attracts me every in single week to come here in scoop in this area scoop is the king of all,  good quality with best teste

Price- if you have between  2000 and you want to give your friends a good treat then rush here!!  high 
quality with cheap rate the main fact is they will never ask you for service tax!!

This place has changed a lot from what it was in my childhood days. It had a good array of items in their menu which i was fond of. Now the standard gas dropped a lot, some serving people are confused about everything and lack basic etiquettes, coming back to their food, it is not as it used to be but is neither bad. It still serves sone good milkshakes. Juices taste  simply like the readymade ones. Quantity is less than expected.

It was my first visit in scoop. The restaurant is located just opposite the seeram arcade. It is one of the best place to hangout after having all the shopping and enjoy a peaceful time.The decoration was very colourful and the staffs were very friendly with us but the service is too slow.
Coming to the food.....this place is the Paradise for dessert lovers.We ordered 1.Strawberry Cheesecake milkshake and 2.Blackforest Milkshake ....both of them were delicious. The milkshakes were served in mason jars topped with whipped cream and a cherry. The strawberry cheesecake milkshake was beyond my expectations..... I really received the essence of strawberry and the chunks of cream cheese. The blackforest milkshake was very chocolatey.
3. Arctic king : It was their signature milkshake. It was topped with two big donuts dressed up with fresh cream, chocolate and gems. The shake was made with caremal and badam. It was so yummy
Lastly I would say that this place is simply a diamond in rough.

We sneeked off to Scoop for a quick lunch sometime back. The interiors are quite funky, with colorful decor and interesting pictures and quotes on the walls. The menu is also very innovatively designed with cool names and a mix and match of delicacies. 
We ordered chhola bhatura, uttapam, chicken ala king, naan, mutton korma and milkshakes( oreo and butterscotch). The uttapam was yummy. It was very well made, soft and tender. The chhola bhatura was great too. Two huge bhaturas with ample quantities of spicy chhole and pickle made us all very full but then the chicken ala king came and that was amazing too. It was creamy and delicious. The rice and the chicken blended very well together.
Now comes the bad news. The mutton korma was BAD! It wasn't cooked properly, the mutton was hard and the spices hadn't blended together at all. Similarly, the milkshakes tasted pretty mild. The oreo one was just biscuity and the butterscotch one too bland. The service is rather slow and they take at least an hour to bring all the food to the table. But it is pocket friendly. To sum it up, a quick snack at a reasonable price is what this place stands for.

We went there yesterday for a revisit. But what disappointed me is their treatment of the customers. First of all, it took them 10 minutes just to give us the menu card and then after asking the waitress for 5-6 times to take the orders, we had to wait. Then we were informed that it will take longer than average to serve it.. even when we agreed to that, our orders were not taken.. me and my girlfriend are pretty sure that we aren't going to revisit soon.

I visit this restaurant whenever I go to esplanade, one of the oldest and fine decor restaurant with good ambience..so expectations are obviously more... good luck..hopefully your quality of food will be maintained everytime we make a visit..

I went there for lunch today after a couple of years.the decor is definitely better, though the chairs are still the same.but what was most appalling was there was an iron nail in the kashmiri pulao we ordered.they wanted to replace the rice but we were half done by that time.the management offered only a complimentary ice cream and did not apologize or showed any remorse.the food, otherwise, was mediocre.

Scoop is a hidden gem among the hustle bustle of New Market. Known to most college goers, this place has variety of things to offer. Starting from milkshakes to oriental to south indian to pastas pizzas sizlers and what not.
Stays packed most of the time, and because of this mad rush sometimes orders get delayed. Moving on to the food, on my first visit I had a black forest milkshake and spicy garlic noodles. My friends had kitty mat milkshake and oreo milkshake. The milkshake was too good and at the bottom of the jar, there was a piece of cake soaked in chocolate sauce!
Their beverages are really worth a try.
Next, the noodles were okay, nothing great. The chilli was a bit on the higher side which killed the taste of it. Even the quantity was an issue.
Hence, if you'relooking for a place to grab a refreshment or a quick bite whilst shopping at new Market, Scoop might do you justice.

I have been here many a times...and never have been disappointed until today....where they are claiming to serve baskin robbins.....but they are serving easily melted ice frozen baskin robins' icecreams ...they should really not offer baskin robins' icecream if they are unable to give it in the condition like baskin robbins do..!

This place and it's cheese dosa!! The best in town! I often visit this place for their cheese dosa..  The staff and ambience is good and well managed! It's location amidst New Market pulls in a lot of crowd but despite that it is very well organised! This place remains in my list of all time favorite!! 

-a happy customer.  :)

I have been to this restaurant many times after shopping in new market. They make really nice dosas and their Chinese is also worth mentioning. But thats all normal nothing so extra ordinary to make a mark in your mind. The rates are high compared to the portions served. The desert here are good. The mocktails are really pathetic. The worst part of this restaurant is the staff. One literally has to find who's taking orders and stand and call the person in charge. Zero courtesy levels and god knows what's the hurry they always have while taking orders. We used to go there earlier but had stopped due to several bad experiences. Recently visited this restaurant with my mother and daughter and I find nothing had changed. Would suggest everyone to avoid it.

Dissapointment largely from this iconic standing of long time. Service, food quantity failed the great decor and ambience. Waiting time is too much and there is no synchronization. Ordered food just appears randomly and not together. Ordered a bowl meal of noddles and famed zap chicken. Although tasting awesome quantity was really moderate, very same for keema naan, which was this long bread on which a few kebab pieces were placed. Pretty pricey for a combo. Then the continental dishes were grilled chicken and stuffed chicken. The grilled chicked was served with mashed potatoes and the stuffed chicken was more of cutlets with veggies and a sauce. Cancelled an order of ice cream due to waiting time but the micktails named pink me served at the beginning was great. 
What got to me was they have a staff running around to get you places which are mostly not ur preffered seats due to the crowd, the service staff is ridiculously slow and unorganized. No one waiter is assigned to a table and its all higgledy piggledy everywhere.
Much much better service is expected from such a busy, profitable joint at prime location. A little bit more portion at that pricing is also solicited

We have been here many times. The taste and quality of their food never dissapointed us. Their varieties of grilled chicken, chicken sizzlers and baked fish are extremely delicious and cooked to perfection. Kebabs are good but not extraordinary. What makes them special is their vast collection of sundaes and sweet treats with their extraordinary presentations and fancy names. Each one tastes heavenly. The only drawback is that they take too long to serve the food.

This rating is solely based on the sundae icecream which we had after waiting for almost a decade. Scoop, no doubt is the most busy restaurant of New market area but the service quality is not at par with the hustle-bustle.
Today I went with my friends to have a quick refreshments at my favorite ice cream place, but the irony was as much as qsr setup they have in decor and seating arrangement, the service is equally sluggish and disappointing. I ordered for birthday cake milkshake, boss lady-mix pink sauce pasta and three scoops of make your own sundae. We were asked to wait for 15 to 20 min for our order, we received milkshake after around 30 min and the pasta took 15 more minutes after that. And we lost track of time waiting for our sundae and the bill. I paid the bill via Paytm and they made us wait 10 to 15 mins after that just to check their Paytm balance, according to them which they did not receive. Finally they took my contact number and picture of my SMS from Paytm and released us. This was heights of wasting a consumers time and taking the test of patience.
Never ever going back there for food! I could get better food and better service in the same area at that cost.

After roaming around new market on a  hot may day, we finally came across a restuarant with had Ac!! Nothing really made me happy or satisfied about this ice cream parlour/ Chinese/indo/snacks bar restuarant.  The menu is great. Has varieties of different food to savor your taste buds.  But the quality and quantity sucked. Ordered chicken noodles,  hot and spicy chicken,  two virgin mojitos.  Both the main course was ordinary.  virgin mojitos came in those Mason jars. The thing that was the most irritating was the Service. 10 mins into the restuarant and we had to wait for a waitress to serve us water. Moreover even during ordering food, searching for a waitress had become a hassle. For dessert we ordered cotton candy scoop.  Ice cream came already half melted. Give this restuarant a pass.

Ambience-Was really good with beautiful songs and background music and dim lights making the place a perfect hideout from the hustling and burstling of city life. One bad thing is that there were lots of houseflies hovering over our food and tables.

Service-was not upto the mark because they never paid attension to our tables or any tables and were showing how busy they were

Food-average food with lots of ill points. First the cottage cheese sandwich with bbq sauce was pathetic with less amounts of sauce and the bread was really soft and overcooked at places. Then came the french fries whick lagged their signature of crispyness and again a total failure. Then we ordered the desert which was pehla nasha named by the management with no sorts of nasha in it. It was a simple blackforest pastry with two scoops of ice cream over a dirty plate. Yes u read it right the serving plate was dirty and looked like they are using it for a long time. Please look in the pics for the yellow marks in the serving plates which was totally a bad impression for this place.

Overall the place is a disaster with only great music but no proper maintainence of crockery and ill service and below average food quality. Definately will never visit again

It was my first visit over there in scoop.
Yes it is a good place for chilling out with friends. The food is good but it can be slight better.

I ordered for cold coffee which was not up to the mark as per my taste.
Bbq chicken cottage cheese sandwich served with french fries and chicken nuggets, sandwich was little sweet in taste and it was good. But the french fries was not crispy.
I was excited for the dessert item and I ordered their house special dessert pahela nasha (interesting name). Black Forest pastry with 2 scoop of ice cream. The dessert was good but not as it's name.

The main thing which I found that the serving plate was not clean.

Overall the place was oküëç

After a long day, entered into Scoop...AC was chilled inside, whereas outside world were getting scorched by deadly sun.. I was hungry,hence needed a good lunch..Ordered a continental lunch "chump champ" - grilled chicken,mushroom pepper sauce, veggies, bread roll..Later I also had Tutti Frutti Ice cream..Food was good, didn't let me down.. price was reasonable if you consider the place, but service was awful..Before finishing my meal(without my dessert)my bill came, nobody bothered to ask me whether I needed anything more..One person brought the meal, one person brought the initial bill, then the same person brought ice cream for me, another person brought the final bill..So confusing...If you are not bother about service or feeling embarrassed, then this might be an ideal place to hang around..

This quick bite spot is one of the best of its kind in Esplanade area in many ways. The ambience is good, with perfect decor for couples and love birds, although the backdrop music is not the best. Food is delicious and wholesome, besides being reasonably priced. Don't go by the name - this restaurant offers much, much more than ice creams or desserts. Service is good.
Most shoppers in this area who don't know about this beautiful restaurant here tend to miss this one amidst other more popular food joints nearby.

The staff seem polite , cordial and waaaay more professional and the food yummy . so congratulations to The scoop for their new improvements .Hope you will keep it up.

Visited with my mom. We were not really looking for a full dinner. So we just ordered one scoop each each of a cheesecake ice cream and a strawberry flavour. The ice cream was great and my mom thoroughly enjoyed it. I ordered crispy chili babycorn and they were perfectly crispy although it seemed to have an extra amount of vinegar. 
Food is reasonably priced but they charged us 10bucks for a flimsy container which felt absurd.

New market hopping is incomplete without visiting scoop. The interior and ambience is quite good. The staffs are courteous though the service is little slow and the price is bit high. Their blazing garlic noodles and zap chicken is a good combination to try. Paradise found sundae is simple yet tasty. But what I like the most are their milkshakes. Birthday cake milkshake is awesome. Kitty Kat is nice but can be less sweet I guess.

What to say. Was really hungry. Went on to have some good food. Tried building a good ambience. But loud Bollywood music in front of my ears wasn't pleasant at all. Waited for 15 long minutes for a glass of water, and another 5 minutes for the staff to @take the order. Aam panna was good. Meatballs pasta should better be named as ketchup pasta with nuggets. Ordered some kind of chicken steak, the veggies were fresh, the dip was too bad, and so was the chicken. Tasteless, not even salted and marinated properly. Surely, wont recommend to anyone.

I have been here twice and my experience has always been awesome. This place is located opposite Sreeram Arcade and the place is always crowded with people no matter when you drop in. So I visited this place yesterday it was my birthday so I was in  Scoop for my Birthday lunch. So I ordered A combo meal in which they had A Medium size Pizza, 4 pieces of garlic bread with cheese and 2 tumblr of coke and ordered a bowl meal Biriyani with Chilli Chicken. The pizza was delicious and the biriyani was okay and the chicken tasted good as well. On in all the food was good. The place is really ideal for chilling with friends because the place is decorated beautifully, with good music and with a refreshing atmosphere. The best part was that we got a discount of 10% because it was Tuesday and I was there with 2 of my girl friends so it was basically a Ladies special discount which was really cool. I'm in love with this place an hope to visit it again.

The variety of food it provides makes it stand out from the rest of the restaurants nearby.. Starting from dosas to sandwich to desserts to noodles n then sizzlers tried most of the menu.. Special mention of mango panacotta (which I guess was seasonal) was worth it..

When you are hell tired after having a shopping spree at New Market,you can go to Scoop,a multicuisine restaurant where you can get anything and everything from sandwich,burger,pizza ; noodles,fried rice,manchurian to polao,biryani,vada,dhosa.

We ordered chicken a la king,vegetable polao and chicken butter masala,garlic nun and kadhai paneer.We had to wait for quite a long time.And my creative friend made that time productive by decorating the plates with sauce.well you all can see that in the pictures below. :)

I was so hungry,and that chicken a la king felt like heaven in the mouth.But then,when I've almost finished half of my plate,I saw a hair in it. The server was called and she brought another guy with her.And the guy said that they were extremely sorry for the hair fiasco.They took the old plate and brought me a new plate.This time I was a little sceptic about the food.But,thankfully,there was no hair. :P But the dish tasted yummy.The smell of cheese did increase my appetite.

The vegetable polao was good.I will definitely recommend this to others.Chicken butter masala was alright.

Kadhai paneer was good.Garlic nun was okayish,not as good as expected.

The desert looked great but I found nothing except a dollop of whipped cream and a liquidy substance.

All in all,the experience was good.The staffs were courteous.

Scoop offers a variety of sundaes which is really a treat for people looking for innovation in their ice creams. The service was pretty great, the ice creams arriving before the scheduled time and the staff really helpful. The ambience is good if you're planning a casual lunch with friends. All in all a good experience.

Well The Moment You enter the place ,the colorful dim lights welcome you and the staff member offers you with greetings and menu.They are quick with service and modest enough to inform if the order will take time. We tried Chicken Sizzler And Moon Rocker along with chicken cheese sandwich .Food is good and the music they play is soothing.The only turn off thing was they insist you for the bill if you are done with your order as to accomodate waiting crowd.Staff are concerned about feedback and thats good. Overall it was a nice visit . For a good interior and elaborated menu you can opt for this place.

The moment you step inside you will literally get a refreshing, soothing and colorful aspect of life, far from the day to day stress. I always loved their Icecreams, the way they indulge you with the varieties is just drooling. Tutti fruity, paradise found or the way you like it; almost had everything and all are straight from heaven. Waiting for more visits..

The most attractive thing about this restraunt is it's Pink decor and catchy taglines and names of dishes. The interior, which is almost completely pink, makes one feel really good. And if you are a girl, then they will make sure that they do treat you the best way with all the special discounts and taglines. 
Well, the food is good both quantity and quality wise. They serve tasty food in surplus quantity within acceptable budget. 
You will find, female attendants dressed in pink, doing their best for you. Our table's attendant was Ms. Sangita, a really sweet and attentive lady who was simply one call away. She served the food with perfection and made sure everything was accurate. 

Overall, this is a nice place to hang out with friends and getting your sweet tooth satisfied.

The atmosphere was really nice. The decoration is very coulorful, music is good. The service (our waitress was Sanju) is also very friendly and helpful. The only negative things we recognized are the temperature in the restaurant. It was to cold for us. And the other thing is that our waitress urged us too much to write this review.

Been to Scoop after so many years with a friend.  The service was quite good. Especially Sanju's. She was quite warming and friendly. We ordered chicken lollipop which was very great. But the french fries were not as expected. Then we ordered oye lucky ice cream.. Though it was quite a treat to the eyes but apart from the different Scoop of ice cream flavours the layer of cakes was not so good... Rather it was quite dry.so if they serve that layer with some whipped cream it will taste better. Thank You Sanju for such a good service.

Though many other new restaurants has opened in this area in recent years, this place hasn't lost its charm & glamour a bit. Quality & taste of the food and very well behaved staffs are the main factors which helped them to retain their fame. I would like to mention Ms. Sangeeta Kundu & Ms. Ruma Das specially for their special attention & professional attitude. Wish team scoop all the very best.. Keep going guys.. :-)

Scoop does not needs an introduction in a different way. It is a place where you will find everything to eat be it Indian, Chinese, Continental or Mughlai. Since when I was introduced to Scoop by one of my friends, I always tried their chicken keema dosa, which is out of the box & obviously tasty. I never thought of trying anything else. But recently I went their with my friend & tried their continental part of menu & I must say they almost excel in that also. CHUMP CHAMP CHICKEN GRILL, a treat to your taste buds, creamy, succulent chicken in that extremely yummilicious sauce with sauted vegetables & buns. Ending with the dessert, LEE LING BROWNIE WITH PEANUT BUTTER, one of its kind of dessert, treat for your eyes & tongue, both.

 food..regarding service its moderate & the last thing which i feel the worst is about a lady who continuously provoked me for good comments against her & i noticed her she was approaching each table for gd reviews in her name so my question is its s very bad practise.& its very embracing i.@ can still remember her name .,sangita..I also notice sangita droping water on da tsble while pouring into da glass so i want tu tell her before expecting good comments she should do da gd sevice..Management should kick her outr for betterment of da company.

We ordered a pizza combo and it was mouth savoring.  The flavour was very authentic and cheesy enough.  A must have if you are a foodie.  Garlic bread in the combo was a delicious delight as it had the balanced flavours of garlic and cheese.  The combo is also great for your pocket as it is reasonable enough. Our attendant Sangita was very polite and was very warm and charming, so all together it was a great experience.  A favorite destination from now on for me.

You make good food, the decor and ambience is fab but one thing rather a problem, you make extremely oily food. I ordered yesterday paper plain masala dosa and cheese dosa. Dosa should be made in less or no oil but what i got was my fingers stained badly in oil, and due to oil i could not finish the tempting food. The chutneys were fab but dosa too oily.

Very colourful interiors....Once you step into the restaurant you are bombarded with bright colours from all sides. It adds to the informal and peppy atmosphere. The service staff are good, our server was Sangita and she went about her work smilingly and pleasantly. She even gave her suggestions about which icecream to have but in a gentle and mild manner, not overly aggressive but gently persuasive. Waiting time after the order was given was also moderate. Had paneer tikka and it was good, soft and succulent paneer pieces with tandoori masala and cooked well in tandoor with slightly charred edges giving it a smoky flavour. The pudina dip which accompanied it was tangy and tasty. The onions salad too added to the taste. The icecream, new one, strawberry cheesecake was excellent. 
But I feel that this place is somewhat overpriced. 
Otherwise good place.

I was with my family and friends  on scoop near newmarket area last week and I got an. excellent  place for drinks and dine. Deco and ambience is superb especially  da elegant hieght. you  can feel a soothing effect of a classical resto of global cuisine. Management are highly appreciated including lovely staff. Overall food is excellent. Fried chicken Thai style and grilled fish in lemon butter sauce is awesome. More a hostess named by sanju has taken a especial care. Her attitude, simplicity, way of communication is the best which me and my family and friends admired. If it happens to everyone (guest) thanI can say she is an asset to an organization. Thanx a lot to all team scoop.

Last week went there with my friends.. First of all I like the ambience of this place.. This place was nicely decorated which I like the most.. We ordered 1. Spicy chilli garlic noodles with jap chicken, 2. Basil noodles thai style with prawn hot garlic and 3. Chocolate chips ice cream .. Personally I didn't like the taste of spicy chilli garlic noodles but basil noodles was much better than that ( but it was not fab) .. Quantity of food was not at all good.. Just because I love everything related to chocolate that's why I liked their ice cream.. It is a pocket friendly place.. This place is mainly famous for their desserts, cakes etc.. It is located at Esplanade so anyone can go there after shopping.. I am not going to recommend it..

The place is called Scoop , where they have picked a scoop of every colour and theme possible on earth and made a sundae. I don't understand the true essence of the place. You get mixed vibes from the place. 
The quantity has reduced, the taste is not worth mentioning. Average food at affordable prices. If you like blaring music and jazzed up decor and happen to be at New market then you can try this joint.

It's really sad that such an iconic restaurant has gone below any standard ,if there was an option of lesser than one would have given that (so unfortunate) ,well my review us solely based on the service staff and to sum extent the ambience , the staff has no idea about the menu, wen asked a staff what baked dishes they have he started telling me about kebabs ,what we did not order comes to our table and a min later the staff comes and says " sorry sir iska billing hogaya tha " ,then to worsen things the so called grill chicken I ordered comes and it's absolutely cold n the mash potato was stale . The music is so loud what u say to the staff and what the staff hears god only knows , the quality of food is pathetic ,think only the ice-creams a reason to go to that place , wen I asked for the manager the captain turns up saying to tell him n he will convey it to the manager ,really dumb I must say . Funny thing was I was so surprised when I saw people coming after us are eating finishing and leaving did not know a grilled chicken takes over an hr to make and a steak takes allmost the same .... All I wish n hope they realise where they are lacking ,sad to see such and iconic restaurant turn into like this ........

Nice service of sanju Singh.. Had starter lollipop which proceeded with the main course including chicken biryani fried rice and tandoori butter masala and ended the desert with ice creams.. Too nice food

The initial razzmatazz (from pics....) gave me hope, but, the umpteen no of "not available" answers from the staff on enquiring about the menu got me back to my criticism mode....
Coming down to brasstacks, two cold coffees, a masala pepsi and a fried chicken later, I was poorer by ‚Çπ617, just about ok....
Quality....truth be said, nothing to write home about, the chicken smelled stale and the oil tasted old and used....
Being in new empire cinema complex, it's always a nice and nostalgic feel, this place ruins it for me....if theirs a crowd, it seems that is purely because it's NEW MARKET....

If you are shopping at New Market throughout the day and you are tired and hungry, Scoop is the place to go. I've been here twice and even though the place is crowded and the service isn't quite fast, the food and desserts will completely satiate your hunger.
Ordered a cheese dosa, which was overloaded with cheese. 4/5. The KitKat shake is really delicious. What I really loved was this ice cream by the name As You Like It. It has 5 different flavored scoops, real fruits and wafers as toppings and is amazing. A must try.

We went to scoop to satisfy our sweet tooth cravings. The restaurant was nicely decorated because valentine's week was going on. We ordered As You Like it Sundae and we chose one scoop each of tutti fruti, butterscotch and kesar pista.. The ice cream was awesome.. We also ordered Heart Throb which contain red velvet cake with cream and 2 scoop of two in one ice cream and a cookie.It was so nicely decorated but I personally feel that the cake was bit hard but other than that every thing was just fine.

I've been to this place a lot of times. The service is usually slow but the food is good and affordable. They have launched a new item, Creamy Baked Fish. On the whole, it's a nice dish. A thick fillet of fish well baked and topped with mozzarella cheese. It's served with roasted broccolis, potatoes and onions. A dash of lime in the potatoes would have made a world of difference. The palate became a little boring at times. I would like to make a special mention of Ms. Sanju Singh who was extremely courteous and went out of her way to make the visit memorable unlike my past experiences at the restaurant. I also tried the blackforest milkshake. It was not extraordinary,but  it was good.

The New Market Area, the shopping hub has always been crowded with the fashion lovers. But, the place is quite popular among the foodies too and if you‚Äôre one among them, Scoop can be your pick. This is a perfect place to relish multiple cuisine; from South Indian to Chinese; from North Indian to Italian. Besides, a wide range of luscious desserts is there to be selected from. 

Last time, I went there to get some quality time with my dear buddies and had Chicken Sizzler, Chicken Salad and BB Chicken Burger. The Chicken Sizzler was a must have preparation that you would like to relish again and again. The salad was a perfect blend of lettuce and onion along with chicken tikka. Quite naturally, the taste of the dish was ravishing and state-of-the-art too. In addition, the burger, which was simply yummy, deserves complete appreciation. The grilled chicken was perfectly mixed with the mouth-watering BBQ sauce and the delicious cheddar cheese. The flavor and daintiness offered by the melted cheese totally mesmerized me.

Overrated place in the middle of a hustling market area, staff is lazy and sloggy! 
Ambience is too loud and congested. The music add bitterness to the ambience. 
Coming to the food, we had Chole Bhatore and Tango. As per the waitress, Tango would contain coriander rice and kebab. However it had butter rice. The size of the kebabs was good, but they could have been more soft. Tango as a whole is a very dry dish as they did not serve any chutney with the kebabs.

Whenever I go to Newmarket, after finishing our necessary marketing I always prefer Scoop for quick bite, evening snacks or dinner when needed.It is situated just below New Empire cinema hall. Not so decorated but always occupied by customer for availability of quality food in reasonable price. Today in the evening we have tried fried fish and chicken(with cheese and egg) club sandwich as recommended by attending lady Ms Sanju Singh, it was awesome in one word....üëç

In spite of being the heaven for the ice cream lovers the Scoop of New Market also performs a prominent duty of keeping the taste-buds of everyone happy by serving delicious dishes. The place is a bit crowded, but all the waiting will actually come out to be beneficial after having a bite of their unique cuisine. Our last week‚Äôs visit to this awesome place actually became fruitful due to the variety of dishes served in the outlet. 

The ambiance of the food parlor was absolutely brilliant and the nice background  music of the place goes perfectly well with their marvelous food items. The dishes we decided to try consisted of chicken sizzler, chicken salad and BBQ chicken burger. The freshness of the lettuce and onions could easily be felt with every bite of the Chicken Salad we had. The pieces of the chicken used in making the salad were quite big. The BBQ Chicken Burgers we ordered were also very delicious. The chicken used in making the burger was perfectly grilled and the BBQ sauce, paprika, and cheddar cheese used in the burger made the dish more delicious. The Chicken Sizzler was also a mention worthy dish. 

The affordable price along with the wide range of food items are enough for the people to pick the outlet as a cool hangout place with their pals.

Been here so many times.... Don't even rememer how many times.... But the saddest part is they don't treat their regular customers nicely I guess.... Yesterday I went to scoop with my boyfriend for dinner after office.... In the beginning everything was fine but after ordering tikka kabaab they made us wait for almost 45mins.... We kept on calling the service boys and girls but nobody answered.... The waitress who took our order (Sangeeta) is the most ill-manered girl with full of attitude who doesn't know to behave with their customers.... I kept on asking her that what is the status of the food ordered she didn't even bother to answer instead went to other waiters and kept on commenting by pointing finger at us.... The captain of the waiters (Sankho) kept on saving and hiding her faults from the manager when I was leaving the table without even touching the kabaabs.... Very Very Very disappointed with the service this time especially from Sangeeta and Sankho.... Scoop team should take an action for their misbehavior.... But there are also some good waiters like Sanju, Ram, Asif and etc.... A BIG THUMBS DOWN FOR SANGEETA AND SANKHO üñì
And they are charging really high nowdays which really unacceptable.... First of all you give that discounts like post on fb get a discount, mondays wear pink get a discount, tuesday wear that get a discount, and so on and even after the discount they charge you vat tax, service tax and makes the bill same or a bit @higher which is same to the bill before discount.... I know you are running a business but don't fool people like this because we come enjoy food and ambience so we pay.... That doesn't mean that you will fool us this way.... Really disappointed with their service.... Otherwise they have great food and awesome ambience.... I like visiting there almost everyday.....

I love the dishes here. The range of dishes are wide and highly innovative. The service there is awesome and looking forward to go there again. 
#Mr.Sanu's_Ramen_noodles is highly recommended-one of the specials and believe me you won't have a second thought to get that one more.
Scoop=Highly recommend.

food was good
ordered paneer dosa and miss roshani noodles. both tasted good and Sangita was in service who was prompt and smart. The ambiance was nice as well. But the service was not at all good.

it was cheeky Friday which was supposed to give us a coupon or discount upon asking. But we didn't get it despite asking about what's cheeku Friday. Moreover, the waitress came for 3 times to make sure that I have written a review or not. This should not be the practice of almost forcing to write a review.

Second visit here. Quite crowded, expected when you're bang in the middle of New Market. Known for its desserts but didn't try any.

Ordered the chicken cheese burger. OK. Served not with French fries but with the home made potato chips. The burger could have done with a bit more molten cheese, since the patty was dry. But it was tasty, and gets you full.

Chicken nuggets were really good. Soft, succulent. Fish fingers were disappointing. This is one dish I have everywhere I go, and this was too dry. Also, they don't serve it with tartar sauce, so another drawback that. Only reason I'm rating it 3.5 instead of 4.

Wanted to come here after seeing so many people posting photos of the deserts they had here.
But, honestly I found the place not very recommendable especially for vegans.
They cook the veg food in the same oil and utensils as they cook non veg (asked the waiter)
And the desert seemed too overpriced.

Try their Paneer Dosa. It's an all time favourite of mine.
I love this place since forever and i'm sure any Kolkata shopper frequenting New Market would agree with this. 
Their sizzlers are a must-try! 
I've tried their desserts twice and i've been a little disappointed both times, but i guess that was just bad luck.

Visited the place on 1st January as this my second visit the ambience is nice..But i was little disappointed with the food as i got a fly in my kashmiri polau so i replaced it den i got some other insect...yuck...den the manager came in and changed the total cuisine from indian to chinese..And the best thing was they only took the price for mocktail,starter and the main course n desert were sponsored from there end  as they apologized a lot after that..Hence will think for a next visit ..cannot rate more than 3 as for the experience but previous experience was good.

The visit to SCOOP was the result of a very sudden planning. Standing amidst new market we surfed zomato for a nearby place to have our lunch.. And scoop unexpectedly happened to us and more unexpectedly left us awe-stricken with what it had to offer. 
The first thing which hit us and for which the restaurant stands out is the ambience.. Just awesome. There is something very innocent, soothing and refreshing about the ambience. The interiors are very beautifully decorated with thermocol art. There is pinkish hue in the interiors created by the lights renders the place a childish attitude. The awesome music also adds to the beauty of this place. 
Next coming to food they have a pretty interesting menu card at least the new anglo indian section to be precise. They have added  a lot of innovative continental dishes in this new section. We ordered - 
UNCLE DENZIL MUTTON STEAK (from the new anglo indian potluck menu) - slightly gravy mutton steak served with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The mutton was soft and juicy. Tasted awesome. Even the mashed potato was tasty. 
INDONESIAN CHILLY NOODLES WITH CHICKEN SATAY (from the old menu) -  noodles served with 4 pieces of kabab-like fried chicken. Very innovatively delicious. 
FROZEN COCO- SCOOP is famous for their desserts. And this item does justice to their fame. This is also one of their new additions and most importantly comes at a very cheap rate. Consists of layers of cream with  a cherry on top with ice cold coco beneath. A perfect happy ending to an awesome meal.
Now regarding the pocket pinch,  I found SCOOP to be very much pocket friendly. The portions they serve is for one person and not adequate for sharing. But still considering the quality it is way more reasonable than other joints in the city and that too being located in the heart of kolkata. More importantly they DO NOT CHARGE THE EXTRA SERVICE CHARGE. That is a relief for sure. 
Once i learnt that  often the greatest pleasures comes in the most unexpected ways. Scoop just set a perfect example for that!! 
Bon apetit

This restaurant is great as an ice-cream parlour. The Chinese items are very tasty. Also, the restaurant comes up with innovative bowl meals and platter. The price is a bit high if quantity is considered. The ambience is really great with coloured. 
Much like the decor of the place with fleecy pink clouds on the ceiling this place is sure to send a sweet tooth to cloud 9.  It‚Äôs a multi cuisine restaurant and has huge variety of foods to offer. Be it Chinese, north Indian, south Indian or continental snacks. The menu has so much to offer that it took us a while to decide what to have exactly. 
Nice place to hang out with friends in Esplanade.

This place is nice for a hagout with your friends. The ambiance and the d√©cor is quirky and cool. Coming to the food, we ordered chicken fried rice, chicken noodles, garlic chicken and chicken club sandwich. They gave vegetarian fried rice first but after a lot of arguments they changed it. Food was good, but not worth the price, i mean you can get better food at a better price elsewhere.

First visited this place few days back with my friends at that time the food seemed okay. But my second experience with this place went very bad.. The food were just horrible quantity of salt in chicken keema dhosa was just too much told them about this as we were unable to finish that but they didn't give a damn to our complaint.. If on a festive evening they serve this kind of food then I don't know how they handle their customers in a regular basis. Very bad experience.

If there were ratings in negative then it would have been easier..
Went with my friends few days back ...the food taste is simply average..the waitress stand iddle..and had to call multiple times for a glass of water also..and the one word they know..is thora time lagega..for the order it's ok..but for the bill they took 20 minutes.
Is this some kind of joke they do with customers..
Moreover they don't listen to what we order.atge waitress missed out orders and we had to wait for another 20 mins ..then the desserts ..north star and fluffy simple tasted like chocolate flavoured HORLICKs..if you really wana taste it ..your wish
. When asked to serve I guess they didn't like it at all..when asked not to serve more on my plate she kept on adding...like was she crazy??
It's not like you ppl have less staffs but the ppl stand ...sluggish behavior is not at all accepted honestly.
Scoop has been my favourite..but over this experience the expectation has gone down the drains 
The management please do the needful..so that the image doesn't drop further for other foodies.

We ordered "chef spcl sizzler with saffron rice" , issues we faced
1. Quantity was too less.
2. Taste was not good at all
3. They gave pav instead of rice
4. In bill they charged for saffron rice .

After that we ordered 2 main couse, raita and breads
Issues faced
1. Taste was not good 
2. Service wss poor, no waiter was available. 
3. Staff was too less to serve all the tables. All waiters were in hurry. Were not taking orders properly nor were serving food properly. 

Food is not much costly but not worth a penny. It wasted our money , good mood.

This is first time when I visit scoop where the preparation and the service is very good. I visit here with my friend and he also tried onion uttamam and Masala Idly which was also really it was very mind b lowing. For a nice preparation and a delicious taste we visited scope 3 times. 

The service given by Sangeeta mam was also very gud .thnx she understand that what type of food we want to have and really she serve as same we want.  Thnx to her also.. excellent  service given by her.

It's a  popular food joint in the bustling New Market area. The interior is quiet spacious and cozy. Though it's known for the delicious scoop of Ice Creams they serve but their pizza is also good. Tooty Fruity & As you Like It scoops are quiet delectable with a very good presentation. Service is prompt and free wi-fi is an added bounty!

Visited this place earlier and it was quite okay but this time my experience was really bad. I had ordered chicken steak and chicken sizzler. The taste was almost same except for the fact that sizzler was served in the way it should be that is in a sizzler plate. The rice served with sizzler tasted bad. Moreover the steak was really cold.I literally felt like running away without paying the bill !

The sandwich was cold. Had few bites and then i left the sandwich. French fries was cold as if it was made earlier then we asked them to change the fries and gaves us another one was was badly oily.

Highly over hyped place. Prices are high and dishes are not that good when consider in the price. In chicken sizzler for 310 you get rice that it equivalent to amount to chutney/shambar you get in Idli/Dosa. Ice-creams are good. Place is surely overhyped. Then had to go to Royal for dinner.

We order Very-cheesy chicken Pizza, Cold Coffee with Ice Cream and Masa Dosa.
The pizza was very cheese and the cold coffee was delicious. I absolutely loved it!
The Dosas were crispy and the Sambar was very tasty
The pocket pinch is affordable .
The service is good too.

We went there in between peak hours, but glad that we didn't have wait, we entered and got our seat. We ordered a Big Boy Shake which the waiter told will take sometime to serve and a Chicken Club Sandwich. The ambience was very lively and very good. Around after 25mins the Big Boy Shake was served, it looked so good, so great, but the taste was just better than average compared to its looks. The cream and chocolate spreaded over the was good but the shake could have tasted a bit better. We spent more time in clicking photos of the Shake. The Sandwich was good especially the layer of the cheese and egg made it taste very good. Their service was very good and up to the mark.

And the waiter informed us that despite of complains the manger did not pay any heed and never bothered to change that. In fact it is the waiter who advised me to write in zomato. Moreover the food tastes below average but priced much higher.

A very vibrant place , well located and with a huge seating capacity, is a very good option to make your tummy happy after the all the tiring shopping at New Market.

I used to visit Scoop since the time it was only an Ice-cream parlour.
This is the place from where I learnt to have ice cream so lavishly. Got introduced to sundaes.
Shopping in New Market has drastically decreased since 2010 and so has our visit.
Never had the chance to come back after it turned to a multicuisine restaurant. Hope to give it a visit someday.

Been to this place many a number of times. There ice creams are delicious! And they come in big jars instead of cones. The sundaes might seem overpriced at first, but one dig into the sundae and ypu will realise its worth it. The main course dishes are okay, reasonably priced but their ice creams are the speciality.

Scoop is famous for its indulging sundaes.
I have visited scoop only for them. They never fail to delight me. 
The sundaes are moderately priced. 
If you ask about the other items, scoop offers indian, chinese, mughlai, italian cuisines. I guess too much for a single restaurant. The main course items are in my opinion overpriced.

This nicely decorated place is located opposite of Sreeram Arcade and just beside the New Empire.
They have a tons of different items on their menu from Indian to Chinese to continental and Italian and what not and also there are varieties of desserts and shakes.The ambiance at this place is quite noisy but the interiors which is mostly in pink colored theme is impressive.

We Ordered : Mixed Grill Sizzler with rice and Big Boy Shake.

WE had to wait about 15 minutes for our Sizzler to come.But,it was worth waiting for the
dish.It consisted 1 piece of fish,1 piece of Mutton And and a large chunk of Grilled Chicken,served with rice and a Sunny side up egg.It was really delicious and a must try dish for all.
THEN it was the time for the shake.It came with 2-3 scoops Vanilla and 1 scoop of chocolate ice cream served in a dark chocolate layered glass jar with full of cream and a Brownie on top.Also 
it was decorated with 3 pieces of ferrero rocher and colorful Gems and a cherry on top.
The shake was insane and wonderful.

We had to pay Rs-716/- for these two dish and yes they did charge additional taxes.
¬†
The staffs were friendly but sometimes they were slow and didn't pay attention to the client.
I will visit again because of the food, which was good and also for the desserts.........

Though the place is legendary and a major landmark, I sincerely feel Scoop needs to pull the socks up for it's own good. A restaurant with ample space and quirky decor (though personally I do not like the colorful plastic seating arrangements), you can hangout here with friends for hours. ¬†Please note, due to it's super awesome location, most of the time you will find this place to be over crowded.

Food is good. Portion is good. Price is reasonable. Service okayish.¬†

P.S. The hygiene factor needs a check.

A visit to Scoop is must if I am in the area. The fleecy pink ceiling and bright colourful decors would instantly brighten up your mood! The staff service is excellent - everyone is so cordial and helpful. Scoop is known for its dessert assortments. The As You Like It is great! Three of us were finding it difficult to finish. I have tried their pop chicken (good one), super duper thin crust (tasty and crunchy), creamy cheese sauce pasta (yummy), special mixed noodles (quite good), hot garlic chicken (hot!), a couple of their milkshakes and divine chocolate. I was never disappointed.

Much like the decor of the place with fleecy pink clouds on the ceiling this place is sure to send a sweet tooth to cloud 9. The decor - 5/5 , the milieu 5/5, the food 10/5. Food is par excellence here. We ordered milkshakes; each flavour was mouthwatering and extremely filling later we ordered French fries, a non masal dosa and a cardimum tea. The tea needs a special mention not only for its splendid taste but also for the salty savories that came along with it. This dreamy place becomes all the more better with the service that it offers. The service providers are extremely warm and enthusiastic. A special mention to Sanju Singh. She is a sweet heart and this review is also a shout out for her. I hope she gets to read it. A place worth going back and quite rightly placed under the legendary section of Zomato.

SHOPPERS' STOP!

When our legs ache of walking in the congested streets of Eaplanade, our hands pain of carrying heavy shopping bags and our eyes are tired of window shopping, we drop in to this colourful to look at food through a coloured glass. The pasta dishes, the steaks and the sizzlers to be happily concluded with abundant ice cream in different flavours - has always been our set plan and we have never been disappointed whether in the matter of price or proportion or service. This place gives some space and time to its eaters and is always a happy relief to the tired shoppers.

I've often passed by this place,  since it's situated at the heart of a bustling new market area. I believe the interiors have recently been re-done. It looks more like a flashy,  fancy joint for kids with all the vibrant colours. Huge menu,  though I'm not sure if everything is available. When I visited,  sandwiches were unavailable. We ordered penne in tangy tomato sauce and a plate of fish and chips. The food tastes good,  without any doubt. However the saddest part of the whole experience has been the staff. I hate to say this,  especially when I see how the serving staff is normally overworked in restaurants. But this was a cold treatment on a whole new level. Within a min. of occupying our table,  a guy comes to us for order. Like,  seriously? Then he asks us if we wanted a regular or bottled water. Upon asking for a regular one,  he gives an extremely weird smile (as if almost saying : bah! Regular weirdos,  can't afford a thing). Please note,  it's not just me, my friend felt the same as well. Then within,  3 mins. Another person comes for order and we hadn't even gone through have the menu. After this we really had to crane out necks out and call someone to place an order. Apparently,  the staff wasn't even aware if the  sandwiches are grilled or not. All in all,  we got a bill of Rs. 480 approx. I'd certainly not wish to go back to such a cold treatment. I could've rated lower,  but I really appreciate the chef's work. I wish the management reads this review and makes some improvements.

Had heard a lot about this place so decided to try out with my mum. I must say it boasts of a cream location in New Market... 

We stepped in at abt 12:30 in d afternoon and was surprised dat they weren't ready for d order though d shop is supposed to cater to order by 12noon. This scored negative from meüò£

We picked up from d bowl meal section and ordered veg fried rice with chilly fish.... I was very disappointed by d fried rice... Real bad taste (possibly one of those bad days)but then chilly fish tasted gud...
Quantity wise I would say its filling..

Had ordered a coke float which was gud.

I would hav given d store a 3 but then I was shocked that they do not hav proper washrooms... This is appalling... Not at all expected from such .a renowned restaurant... They directed to a common washroom somewhere on d first floor in a shabby nook which is not at all maintained. I hope they do something regarding d washrooms.

Besides d washroom issue I feel they place is quite gud..and moderately priced...

This is a place of nostalgia! Ahh i miss the marble set up they had years before turning it into a peppy restaurant! The as u like it ice cream and the the banana split were my childhood favourites! Yet this place gives a charm to new market. After being dog tired shopping in the area, we usually head to this place. An all time favourite is dhania dhosa, fried idlies and the coffee. The cappuccino is served with a chocolate spoon..aaahhh awesome! I dont usually click pictures here, but have got a few for the first time. Do try the pizzas pastas and the sizzlers. The staff is absolutely warm!

I went there several times on different occasions. The food quality is decent and moderately priced, though the portions they serve could have been a bit better. They have a tonne of different items on their menu from Indian to Chinese to continental and Italian and what not and also there are varieties of desserts and shakes to curb ones sweet tooth. The ambience over there is nice and clean and it is nicely decorated, what I like the most are the glasses in which they serve water and their little jars for serving cold drinks or shakes. I recommend to visit this place at least once.

Situated near new market area in between city mart and new empire cinema in humayun lane. First let me tell you what the best part it - Sweet female waitress in pink outfit. Okay move on now to D√©cor it was like big ice cream parlour. Girless and beautiful. Ambience was amazing. Hospitality was really nice. Friendly and helpful staff. Reasonable price on comparison with taste, quality and quantity. Quick service and ravishing presentation. Today I tried their Pehla Nasha which was black Forrest pastry with two scoop of blind love ice cream comes with sparcals. Delicious in taste and ravishing in looks. Must try place. Totally loved it. Personal favorite. Recommended to all Ice cream and pasta lovers.

2nd best thing is the continental food. Grilled and fried fish was awesome. 3rd comes in the ranking is chinese. 4th is selective north indian dishes.
Taste of food is good.

I would suggest people to order dark temptation, paradise found and pehla nasha. We had also order pepsi with ice cream. All these four were fantastic. The amount they serve is enough and go with the price! Thumbs up for scoop!Go on.

Sorry yo say but this place was one of my fav at aone time and now its so bad . I ordered chicjen nuggets fr the starter and ut turned iut to be smely and was having a bitter taste. We said it to the waiter they took it and said u can order anything else . Then we orderd fush finger whuch was ok . Fr the main course we ordered kashmiri pulao and chicken makhani . Both if them were just horrible . The chashew nuts were burnt and it tasted blunt . There were fruits like papaya ehich was totaly raw in the rice . The chicjen smelled rotten . I complained the asst manager suman . He is another one . Didnt helped us just say sorry and said oiiii billl layo is table ka . Shame shame . Not a way to hold up a businesss .

I went to Scoop a month back. Thanks to Zomato,  who supplied me with a food coupon from this place. And thanks again, as it was a wonderful experience. The place is no doubt cramped up, with large crowd and mixed cacophony of conversations and cutlery. We managed a 2 seater, and ordered for fish fingers followed by a chicken steak and a grilled fish. We also had a mocktail and one ice cream. The quality of fish was absolutely superb, and the preparation did justice to its quality. The ingredients were fresh and retained the right amount of juice in spite of being well cooked. The attendants were very courteous and there was nothing to complain about their hospitality. A minor glitch was that the starter came after the main courses, but the taste more than made up for it. I would definitely consider revisiting this place again.

Firstly, it's a place from kolkatan dessert legend. Secondly, this is where you go to chill out - literally and metaphorically. This is the ultimate hang out with friends,the more the merrier. Thirdly, there is a wide range of cuisine to choose from - sumptuous sizzlers to sassy south Indian.
My personal favourite is the famous slurpy Cantonese mixed noodles and fish. Their pizzas will put the current international brands to shame with the sizeable portions, generous toppings and fulfilling mouthfuls of cheese. North Indian dishes are great too. Momos are yummy. Every item is palate pleasing.
The place is spacious and the decor is unobnoxiously funky, done up by the proprietress . The setting is inviting for a mega gossip session with friends and family. The place is surprisingly affordable as well, even though it is a part of kolkata's hospitality history. Kids to grannies - there is something for everyone. A spiderman positioned outside on an English park bench has been the photo companion of numerous visitors from India and abroad.
The place has always been a dessert haunt so I am not writing much about the desserts. Remember, it is one of the first sundae-serving parlours in kolkata. So go and scoop some definitely after a hearty meal. This is not a place to visit in a hurry. It is a place to relax and enjoy, gossip and eat.

The food was good, i wont say outstanding but again, i would like to visit again and than be judgemental about the food. May try..you will love it

Location-New market area,Kolkata.

Have crave for freak shakes or icecream fusions?Then scoop is the place to satisfy your desire.Scoop is one of the oldest and legendary restaurant of Kolkata.Few years back it was only known for its sundaes but now this place is like an all rounder cricketer which is also famous for its shakes and food.You will usually find this place crowded and during pujas  you have to wait in cue to reserve a seat in this restaurant.It has two outlets in the city and serves Italian,Chinese,North Indian,Continental and South Indian cuisines.And during festive season they always have a special menu along with regular menu.

Service-The service at this place was extremely fast and reliable.The staff is too cooperative and helpful.Inspite of such a heavy crowd they served us the whole order in 10-12 minutes which was quite impressive.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is quite noisy but the interiors which is mostly in pink colored theme is impressive.It also has a two floored huge seating capicity.

Food-The food at this place is fingerlicking.And only one question was constantly striking our mind and it was"How so cheap?."This place also serves a huge variety in food and now during pujas in their special menu they are serving freak shakes which is served by extremely limited restaurant in kolkata.We had-
1:Masala idly
2:Big mama
3:Chola bhatura 
4:Veg seekh kebab

All the item were great in taste but the presentation of "BIG MAMA"just blew our mind.

Food-4.5/5
Service-5/5
Ambiance-4/5

A visit to this place is highly recommended especially if you are a dessert lover.üòÉüòÉ

Scoop is a pocket friendly restaurant and quality food is served. The ambience of the restaurant is good but not great because its always occupied and located on the busy roads of esplanade. I ordered chef's special veg sizzler. The platter had bread, veggies, paneer, pineapple ,etc. It was nice and tasty. Oreo milkshake was very good. The presentation was nice. My overall experience with this restaurant is good as many times i have visited. During peak time like eid or Durga puja you might have to wait to get a seat.

I didn't like their cheese dosa with bitter taste, Oreo ice cream was pricey in comparison to its taste though the dressing was good. The staff serve you late and no where to be seen after being served. Rest of the items tasted good but the quantity of the side dishes are very less with tiny chicken pieces.

The chicken steak, chicken tikka kebab and the chicken sizzler are all really delicious and are a must try. If you have a sweet tooth you can also try out their cakes and ice creams.

Well, how to start this uniquely special review!! Am just so excited. First of all, a big THANK YOU to team Zomato, you people define awesomeness. It was around June and I was busy preparing for my final semester examination. I distinctly remember the day -  I was thoroughly bored and was waiting for something exciting to happen. My phone beeped as I received a notification from Gmail. To my utter surprise the mail was from Zomato! I was asked to give my personal address and phone number. In return they promised to give me a nice surprise! My day was made and I began to anticipate as to what's on store for me! The very next day I received a letter just to find a voucher inside it. Zomato offered me a free meal in Scoop which I needed to avail before 15th September. That was my butterflies in the stomach moment! ;) 

On the very last day that is on 15th September I went to Scoop. Its located on the ground floor of the New empire building at New market, opposite to Wow Momo and Dominos. Blame my superbly hectic schedule for the delay. Initially, I was a bit jittery for I had never ever gone to dine alone. As instructed, I called the restaurant up and confirmed reservation. I was there within 10 minutes of making the call and was greeted by a lady with a very warm smile. Within minutes a young guy approached me with a large menu card and I was literally starving. I ordered JAP CHICKEN, SPAGHETTI WITH MEATBALLS, DARK TEMPTATION AND PEPSI. 

JAP CHICKEN- 8 small pieces of succulent boneless chicken in a unique sauce. The dish was very spicy but not hot! Just the way I like it. 

SPAGHETTI WITH MEATBALLS - this dish was pretty disappointing. While the quantity was impressive the taste was not! It was way too tangy and failed to impress my taste buds. Blame dollops of tomato ketchup for the same. Meatballs were small but spicy. Likeable. This dish needs improvement, but.

DARK TEMPTATION - Ah! This one was a clear winner. Heard a lot about their ice creams and trust me I will go back again exclusively for this. It was a unique concoction of Vanilla ice cream, Chocolate ice cream, chocolate sauce and almond. An absolute delight for all ice cream lovers. I took my own sweet time to relish this delicacy and boy! I was just so content. 

SERVICE - Staffs are amazing and courteous. They are pretty attentive and responsive, which is a bonus! They are also very well trained and are experts in managing crowds. 

OVERALL EXPERIENCE -  Good. Totally Recommended. Oh! I loved the ambience. A tiny fairy land in the heart of an ever busy Esplanade!

When you are in New Market for Pujo marketing, then Scoop is the best place to satisfy your appetite. Hence after successful shopping me and my friends hopped in and ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Manchurian and a Chicken Club Sandwich.
What I really like about this place is their preparations tastes different and to mention not delicious, and they offer a wide range of cuisine - from Chinese, North Indian, South Indian to Continental. Even the quantity is appreciative, I was unable to finish the club sandwich alone. Asked them to parcel it, though they took a charge of 10 Rs, but the parcel box was very cute. The only problem is the talkative crowd and loud music or else a perfect joint for "pet pujo".

It was one pathetic experience. After a tiring day at New market, we were hungry as hell. So wanted to check out this place. 
Overcrowded, loud music. It's so loud that you have to shout to talk to one another. Pathetic service. Over smart and ill mannered staffs. 
Food was good, although a little overpriced. The chicken of club sandwich was giving out a little bit of smell.

Scoop is slowly turning out to be one of my favourite places to eat. It's almost always crowded, so one might have to wait for a while to get a seat. Thankfully, that hasn't happened to me yet (fingers crossed).
The staff is courteous, and service is fast. They offer a wide range of food. My favourites include cream of mushroom soup and spaghetti with meat balls. I also loved their chicken sizzler! Chicken and cheese sandwich was a little dry and also a little expensive for a sandwich! Their quantity is limited - manages to be just about enough for one person.
Decor is pretty cool and hep! I really like their pink lights :)

Scoop is a must visit Restaurant in New Market Area..I have visited there several time during my childhood when I went to New Market with my parents during puja shopping‚Ä¶.I was mainly a good dining place for those people who went New Market for shopping, but after their renovation u can consider it as a dating place also‚Ä¶
Location : It is very easy to find in New Market, located into the bottom floor of New Empire building just beside of WOW! Momo and KFC.
Decoration : After their renovation they added very much Pink in their shop..Very well decorated, big space, clean and no question left for the hygiene level, red colored light is set on roof and the restaurant easily can hold an capacity of 50 people..
Management : Very responsive and very polite too‚Ä¶They help customer to choose the right dish according to their taste.
Food : Well, Scoop serves a large amount of dish of different cuisine. From the South Indian dish to Italian, Mexican they serves all kinda food.They has a huge dish containing menu book which is really makes us difficult to choose what to eat. But after seeing some reviews and guidance on Zomato, we all the following item‚Ä¶..
Creamy Cheese Sauce Pasta (Non veg and Penne) : Well I am not a fan of pasta and all cheesy things, but still I become a fan of there Pasta. In one word it was just mind blowing. Full cheesy and can feel the perfection of the dish, each time you take a spoonful of pasta. The pasta melts into my mouth every time you take a bite. Very much recommended here. You can also try the pasta in Spaghetti variation also.
Spicy Chilly Garlic Noodles with Jap Chicken : In the main course, we ordered this one and it was really a Bulls eye for us. The dish was served in a bowl which looks great. Thin and well fried noodles with 4 mid sized chicken pieces are there in the dish. The noodles was mixed with sufficient amount of well chopped veggies. Chicken pieces were well cooked. The gravy in which the chicken pieces are served was rich spicy but not too hot, which is a really noticeable point. The quantity is sufficient for one persons, overall must try main course here.
Puppy Love : Scoop was and is famous for its legendary ice-cream. When I come early, I had tried Tutty Frutty. So this time want to try something different and ordered this one. Served with two scoop of Strawberry and one scoop of vanilla and cream on top. Gems are putted into the cream, which is really an eye catching. It tastes good but not as good like the Tutty Frutty that I tried last time. Overall good.

In conclusion, it is very obvious noticeable that Scoop has upgrade its quality in huge amount after its renovation. A must try destination at New Market area. Every item is affordable and they have a huge variety of food, All items they served are really made of love and you can surely feel it. Thanks to Zomato for the meal voucher they send to my friend

Restaurant is big with ample seating space with pink theme but the restaurant is very noisy due to its crowd and the loud music which they keep on playing its dam irritating.. 

They had a huge variety in their menu, try to avoid there Sizzlers I tried their chef special veg sizzler which was horrible the vegetable in sizzler was half boiled n no taste & messy 

Prices are on higher side when compared with the food quality.

Went there with my sister..the customer service was disappointing..have to tell three different waiters to clean the table as the first two did not show up..they cleaned the table wet..both of us had ordered chicken steak. It was a disaster too..I do not know why they call it a steak..had chicken steaks before too and it is my favourite dish..tried it from scoop and was a complete shock..its a simple chicken with curry all over the platter..the boiled veggies were not even boiled and was just raw and wet by the curry..the chicken was separated from the curry and tasted like just boiled chicken..long story short, my first visit to scoop wih the chicken streak was a disaster. After ordering and also while waiting for the change after making the payment, we were asked almost by 4 or 5 waiters what are we waiting for..mismanagement.

Worst service...an employee named anjana was very rude to us . We went with family and we left without ordering because of her rudeness. Never go to this place. They do not even have a manager to hear customer's grievances. Worst place ever

Just had lunch here coz a friend wanted to come so ,i  dont usually come here bcz i didn't liked the 1st tym I was here,i had pasta and burgers which were very avg.
So coming to this time we're very hungry,so we ordered mutton biriani and ckn tikka masala and an cheese ckn sandwich combo. The biriani was oky the mutton pieces were big but could have been more softer,the quantity of the rice was very low for the price they charge,wtf is a half of and egg doing in biriani,cant you Even give a full one?
Then the ckn tikka masala which was tasty a bit tangy but was good it had four chicken pieces everywhere they give six in plate.

The ckn cheese sandwich was a disaster for its price so bad it was ,they gave some fries with it which were okaay,and the coke was with out any fizz and tasted bland like water have been mixed in it..i saw the place was full today,i don't know how other items are but i not going back there soon ..they should do basic taste checks on the food.

First of all dont know why price is so high. ¬†Price is no where justified neither in food , in service nor in cleanness .
Either you low your price to local dhaba type restaurants or work hard to match your price.¬†

Visited this place recently....the decor is nice but food is not upto the mark.We had ordered chicken tikka masala, chola  bhatura, cheese dosa. I found a hair in the chicken dish which was very disappointing and the bhatura tasted a little bitter. But one thing i liked  was the cheese dosa which was good.

Thanks to the voucher given by Zomato, I got to know about this place. The interiors are mostly pink, with a friendly and caring staff and good food. We ordered a pizza, chola bhatura, veg burger and the chilli garlic noodles with jap chicken. Everything was good. The pizza was thin and simple, with juicy slices of tomatoes and jalapenos. The burger was okay, and the fries they were served with were really crispy. The chola bhatura had a few mistakes. Though the bhatura was perfectly ballooned up and was thick like how it's supposed to be, the chola lacked the necessary spices and was suspended in a lot of oil. But overall it didn't taste so bad. Coming to the chilli garlic noodles and jap chicken, the chicken had an unusual flavour and tasted good. It was cooked perfectly too. The noodles were nice and spicy , so they brought the whole dish together and they were the highlight of the day. For desserts we had this dessert called the puppy love where there were three scoops of ice cream ; vanilla, strawberry and chocolate with sauces and whipped cream. It was really good. I had always thought of Scoop as a dessert parlour and it is true that it should be treated as one. It is a reasonable place and had good food. Definitely going here again.

One of the earliest memories I have of this restaurant is the extremely delicious pan fried momos they used to serve here. I went back recently but was heavily disappointed. The momos were limp and had none of the taste i craved so badly. We also ordered egg fried rice, murgh korma, butter naan and pink affair. It is with a heavy heart that i have realised the food has come to resemble that from a normal wayside restaurant.

Nice place to hang out with friends and loved ones, good out of the box decore and 1 of the oldest places in Newmarket area. But it has nicely adjusted with time.My favorite here is Chicken Lolypop and various ice cream it has to offer. Triple sunday and Banana splits r one off my favorites.. And its better not to hav chicken sticks because mom's chicken stew is much better. The behavior of the staff is really good and makes one feel real homely here...

A sudden craving for ice-cream while passing near by. Such an amazing experience with mesmerizing decor. Ordered kitkat milk shake and paradise found. The shake was served with whipped cream nd a kitkat, a cherry at the top. Presentation is superb, tastes also good. Nd paradise found has two scoops of vanila ice cream nd one scoop of chocolate icecream along with some nuts nd almonds to add the crunch. 
Tax sums upto 20.5% somewhat. Its a nice joint. Loved it.

One fine morning, I rose to an email from Zomato asking me to send my postal address for a gift. Though, it was not my birthday, I was too greedy for a gift and hence gave them the same. After a span of four days, I received a gift coupon for Scoop and that is the time, I made it on my bucket list to visit. However, the actual visit came after many months and well it was worthy.
I called up my best buddy to accompany me and also click few pics of the same to which he happily agreed being a photo bluff. We reached the eatery around seven in the evening and was greeted by a sweet lady who directed us to get seated. Just as we got chatting on what to order, a guy came with plenty of menus in hand and hence was standing in for us to order. We asked him to wait as our order choice would take some time.
Spending some time reading the menu, we ordered for a combo of BBQ Cottage Cheese Sandwich, Chicken Nuggets, French Fries and a Pepsi. The guy took our order and got it delivered in about 10 minutes. While being eagerly seated for food, I observed that the music was rather loud. However, the staff‚Äôs courtesy was one to look after as they are truly gem. Upon arrival the meal was less in quantity than expected. The BBQ was kinda okay but starting from nuggets to drinks all were minimal in quantity and shooed off really fast. To fill in our stomachs we ordered for Indonesian Smoked Noodles which did not taste any good in my mouth. Dejected at it, I ordered for three kinds of ice creams which they took a little while to prepare but it is worth it.
The Creme Brulee with Choco Chips gave nice flavour to one‚Äôs mouth so as the Mango Paluda with Ice Cream. However, the real amazement lies with the Pehla Nasha which contains two scoops of ice creams and a branch of Black Forest Cake. It also have had a firework attached to it which can be lit if anyone wished to. Forgetting our meal, we drooled upon the desert which tasted really good. Thus, we happily concluded our meal and to the itching question as to why the desert section was placed on the first page of the menu.

Qs) Should you visit it?
Ans) Of course you can pay them a visit and be sure to try the desserts.

Qs) Why have I rated them 4.5 stars?
Ans) Normally, in situations like this I offer to rate 4 stars, but, solely the staffs hospitality and warmness made to add up half a star.

Good is yumm, but according to the price the quantity is very very low.

Starting with the ambience, it has nice arrangements for couples as well as family.

Decoration and presentation of food is what is appreciable.... 

Really loved this place, the ice cream and the milk shake. 

The ice cream had good amount of nuts and almonds and chocolate sauce, that increased its sweetness and crunchiness. 

The milk shake had good amount of cream over it.

Scoop is situated at the New Empire cinema hall. Entering the resturant I found the atmoshpere pretty cool and colourful. They had a huge variety in their menu,they serve many kinds of food and some are very unconventional specially the deserts.

recently my taste for south Indian dishes have increased, and hence we ordered steamed idly and masala dosa which was pure bliss after a whole day of shopping near esplanade.
it is situated in new market area, nice ambiance with cheerful music.
it was completely full when we reached there.
being at the center of attraction beside new empire cinema, it always pulls the crowd.
the food is good. service should have been a little faster, but its okay as it was really crowded.
would like to visit it some other time for trying the other dishes!

Have a sweet tooth and in dire need of biting into a pretty looking, icy, creamy dish to beat the heat this summer? Look no further. Scoop is the place where you ought to be. Location: a few minutes walk from Esplanade Metro Station. Scoop is located at the heart of New Market, or if specifically asked New Empire Building. In other and simpler words, take a left from KFC. You‚Äôd find Scoop to your right.

‚ÄúOne of the best options for food around the area.‚Äù

I consider myself a regular client here. Being foreigner I have a very particular taste in the food, not easy to please in this city. The Scoop manage to always deliver delicious food, well prepared and the service is friendly with a really fun ambient. They should improve the cleanliness a little bit, specially in the tables close to the second gate, on the wall side, as little cockroaches were found on my last visit. The staff is friendly but sometimes they are slow and not pay attention to the client, we have to beg for their attention sometimes, plus their system for tables available is a bit off sometimes. Overall I will always go again because the food is good and the price is fair.

Though a bit costly the flavour was indeed worth the price. What more I found was that it not only served ice cream but solid food as well! Perfect lunch could be done here. Booking a table won't be that bad as the place remains crowded for most of the time!

Scoop Eat n Run is undoubtedly my favorite place and I go there very frequently. It's more like my kind of place.

Ambient : Nothing fancy about the place it's very simple and crafted beautifully keeping youths in mind. Pink color plays the major role here and even staffs dress color is pink may be it's owner's favorite color. :p Nonetheless you will like this place cos it's nice. Plenty of place to sit however I am yet to try out the seating arrangements upstairs which I believe was operational earlier but not anymore.

Staffs : The great thing about this place is the friendly staffs who always welcomes you with a smile and since I am very frequent I know some of them quite well now. Sanju, Sangita and Suman this 3 in particular are the most friendliest guys over here and they make you like this place even more with their commendable service.

Menu with a twist : Menu is huge and you get plenty of items from sandwich to biryani all available here. And one biggest plus point of this place is the experiment they do with new dishes which are more like seasonal special menu which changes every 3 months and I love that alot.

Pricing : Well pricing is decent and nothing to complain about. On a average for me everytime I go with my girlfriend the bill is around 400-700 which according to me is very reasonable as you get to eat alot too.

My favorite : Pop Chicken is a must try and you simply cannot miss that. Then Penne Arabiata Pasta with red sauce and chicken. French fries here great too but now my girlfriend won't let me eat that :( and like that there's plenty of good dishes which you gotta try yourself.

I highly recommend this place to everyone and their Special seasonal menu is a must try. Currently it's mango season so do try out their Mango Glory, Mango Firni, Aam Candy and Eggs-quse-me if you get.

It is served with steamed veggies as accompaniments, and is filling for a person. The tutti frooti is also nice over here. The service and the quality of food can be improved.

Themed restaurant in the middle of new market. The crowd and hustle bustle at this place makes the environment electric. 
A long time favourite of mine, the tag line suits this place perfect- Eat and run.
The ambience is very nice and the place is really tastefully decorated with nice lights. I have a little problem with the music though.
Food here is decent and will taste good most of the times. Fish fingers are really nice and so are their special fishme and chicken wings. The chicken steak was not really as good but overall this place does serve you some lip smacking food.
Pricing is under budget and shall not burn a hole in your pocket.
Next time? Definitely.

Well after visiting this place a couple of times all i can say that this place has lived up to my expectations. With its extensive customer friendly services and wallet friendly prices it has been able to grab the attention of the potential shopaholics in the new market area and esplanade . Some combo ,continental dishes and some icecream such as oreo shake mango delight will make your tummy happy nd satisfied
The ambience is good 
keep it up Scoop New Empire

Pretty looking place located at New Market, this is one those places you go after shopping around in the busy shopping destination. The ambiance is really nice which draws the crowd predominantly. The service however could be much better. Among the food...I've tried the cold coffee with ice cream, pasta, Jap chicken and chilli garlic noodles. The food is quite good if only it would arrive at the table within a formidable time. That apart this place has been one of the most happening places for the youth for quite sometime and continues to be the same. üòä

A good multi cuisine restaurant. First noticeable thing is the ambiance and the attractive colour pellet.  Most of the residents as well as visitors to the city of joy visit new market and a majority of them find this place. The food here is decent. I specially like the sizzler offerings. I have tried the biriyani and some Chinese as well, which are decent. The desserts however are excellent. One can come here only for the variety of ice creams and desserts. The staff are polite. The price is also acceptable. Al together, anyone visiting new market, this is one of the better places to have food there

Had gone to New Market for some work. Was lunch time, so saw this restaurant. Dropped by to check it out. As the pictures suggest, very attractive interiors! Was given a seat immediately! Everything was going alright as of now. Water was served in stainless steel glass, which I liked. 

Had ordered ‚Ä¢ Tango ( special dish ) consisting of tandoor chicken and dhaniya rice ! 

                      ‚Ä¢ Veg rice with chilly fish !

Asked for Lassi, but was informed by Mr. Suman that it's no more available. Fine, understandable.

Now, it was over 20 minutes, none of the food items was on the table. So I asked Mr. Shounak - the young man serving us, about the food. He was on the way and from the other end another female staff was bringing my food. She kept the food on the table, since there were already cutlery on the table, I took the extra ones in my hand to give it back. The lady almost snatched it from my hands. Wow ! Suddenly I looked around to make me realise that I am not sitting in a road side dhaba, but was surprised to feel the reality with the behaviour of this female staff. 

The rice was bloody cold and the chicken had lost its softness and was cold too ! Informed Mr. Shounak about this, to my surprise even he said the same thing which I was thinking, the cold tasteless dhaniya rice was heated in microwave and served. It was on special today. To the COOK ( and not chef ) - LEAVE THE JOB IF You CANT COOK, BUT DONT SERVE COLD MICROWAVED FOOD. Bloody hell. Was surprised with the audacity. 

Now, till now my partner didn't receive her food, and my food was getting colder since I was waiting for her food to come, so that we can have lunch together. 

To the waiters - Please get your basics straight. It's important to have the meal on the table at the same time when people are eating together, and not wait for another 10 minutes for the other dish to land on the table. Job of a waiter is not to just pick up food and dump it on the table, it's all about looking after the guests who come to your restaurant to have a good meal, and pay the price for it. 

Please go to a good place and dine, you will understand the difference between your service and theirs !

Iv visited Scoop many times since childhood, but yesterday was my first visit in the last couple of years... The decor is still the same, colourful and vibrant. What immediately caught my eye was the revamped menu.. The menu card was attractive as were the dishes being displayed on the wall-mounted display boards.. Moreover they had a very innovative offer going on - special discounts for each day of the week - provided u wore black&white clothes or u had an elderly/kid in your group etc... Really really impressive...  A particular lampshade also caught my eye with the handle being made of inverted cups and kettles...
 Our group consisted of quite a few vegetarians, and so we ordered a motley of dishes - the best of both worlds.. Among veg, we ordered  
Spaghetti in Tomato Basil sauce and Veg Au Gratin - both were yummmy... The Chef's Veg Special Sizzler looked delectable but wasnt suited for my non-veg 'steak-y' palate..  I ordered a Penne in Cheese Spinach Sauce, Dry Chilli Chicken and Chicken Cheese Sandwich - all were tasty.... Despite being full, we also ordered 3 milkshakes as they looked absolutely mouthwatering in their picture in the menu - Oreo Cookie, Black Forest, Kitkat.... Unfortunately, apart from the Black forest one, (which had generous amounts of blended pastry crumbs) the others were a tad too dilute..
The bill was around 2.3 k..  
Scoop is one of those old joints which still remains a favourite among us Kolkattans.. overall a good place to hang out with friends over snacks.. and a welcome break from the new age pricey hookah/sports/lounge cafes... This one is just a Cafe !!! And a great 1 !!

I was there yesterday with my wife .In my college life I was a regular visitor here. So thought to visit this place after approx 5 year. But I must say I am disappointed. Staffs are not cordial. In face I must say they are very arrogant and unnecessarily arguing with customer. A family just sitting before us ordered something and just 5 minutes later they said to change it to other dish , the waiter ( white dressed lady , I think she is leading the team) was very rough to talk to them.She said " for you we have cancelled other's order , you have no right to cancel it" she then asked her fellow waiter why this kind of people comes here , hey cancel the order.What the hell !!! the lady is very arrogant. Now it turns for my table , we ordered our items and then asked for normal water .But during serving the order she started to serve cold mineral water.I reminded her that I said normal water. She started arguing . I said calmly to do as per my order.To my utter surprise they did not serve the water. NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE .IT WILL JUST SPOIL THE MOOD.

Today i went there in the afternoon for the first time and was quite satisfied and happy.The ambience is good, hygienic and well decorated with vast seating area. Service was good and fast.We tried super thin crust pizza,steamed chicken momos, meatball spaghetti,grilled fish, chicken a la king.The pizza was sumptous in taste with crunchy and perfect thin crust, with momos we had a hot and sweet chili sauce which just was a burst of flavour on tongue, meatball spaghetti had great flavours in meatballs and grilled fish and steak were the standouts.But the grilled fish to me although had great flavours but the serve was too little and not at all value of money,the lemon rice with it had a strange tasteAll in all great flavours,value for money,definitely worth a try !!!

Thanks to zomato for providing me this amazing voucher which I used to take my mother out for lunch at scoop. The restaurant is well decorated & the is really nice always wearing a smile.
We ordered a chicken keema dhosa, one continental dish containing lots of chicken in white sauce with butter rice & parsley. They were served withing 20mins and the quantity was more than enough for one person. The quality & taste were good too. For dessert we ordered one tutty fruity & one 'Love & Disaster' (cool name by the way). The desserts are totally out of this world, I simply relished every bite of it. Will visit again soon.

This age old restaurant has been around for i don't know how long, I used to visit this place with my parents when I was a kid‚Äì we would mostly eat their sizzlers and ice cream sundaes. And boy their sizzlers were good, if my memory serves me right. 

Recently visited the place after what I believe is a millennium, to be welcomed at a whole new and different version of scoop from what i can remember. 
Enough of the nostalgia, let's jump to business. 
Food. I would say i was happy with it, with whatever i ordered but nit something that would draw me back to the place. Ordered the classic‚Äì chicken sizzler, which I'd say is an above average steaked sizzler, the sauce is rather subtle and nice, though i expected the sizzler to sizzle for a while I don't remember hearing it sizzle as it arrived at the table. 
Apart from that we ordered some crispy chicken pepper which were pretty good and the drinks that accompanied our food were decent.

What I'd really recommend this place for is the staff‚Äì one of the most well behaved and friendly restaurant staff I've come across in my recent visits to restaurants in general. They even offered a complimentary piece of cake which wasn't on the menu, and was currently being experimented‚Äì as in the ingredients and how it ought to be made. And to be honest, the cake was indeed really good. 
And if you're the kind of person who likes to be on the phone whilst eating sumptuous food, this place offers free Wi-Fi, so a brownie point for that! 

Overall I'd say the place hasn't retained it's 90's charm with the all new jazzy colourful decor but they certainly have a good team and decent food to keep you interested. I think I'd visit them for the ice creams again. Cheers!

Worthless! They are only carrying their past glory with them. Only thing that you may try is their ice cream. Very poor service. You have to remind the staff 2 or 3 times regurding your order. Moreover, the item which is being display in their tv screen or in the menu card, may not available. And after all this you have to wait for long time.

I am writing on Zomato for a long now. Being an expertise I don't know how I missed this beautiful place at New Market. Well Zomato noticed that & gave a surprise treat by providing me a voucher of One of The Legendary Desert Parlour of Kolkata, Yes its Scoop.

First of all, I want to thank Zomato from my bottom of heart for giving all the food lovers such an opportunity to share their experiences in a decent way that not just help other foodies also creats its own world & community.

This message is for all the new beginner foodies on Zomato. Zomato has the most largest database of Restaurants in the World. That is because of all the foodies like us posting photos, menus, reviews & sharing our experiences with them. 

Well all of this things not just making their database strong day by day, now it also has became a hobby in our life. Zomato respects all of this efforts silently & they doesn't hesitate to love you back for all your efforts. And here's the proof, My dinner in Scoop was provided by Zomato.

Now lets talk about the restaurant. Scoop is quite popular between college goers young stars and love birds. Why not it should be, they provide some excellent numbers of desert options while they offer a beautiful dining too.

Location : Scoop is located on the ground floor of New Empire Building at New Market. Its just between  KFC and Domino's. This building is quite famous hence the restaurant is quite easy to find.

Decorations : Like all the other reviews says this one is a pink world. But I would like to call it a colorful world. Scoop is very very well decorated with funky colors that just punches your eyes & not only that those colors matches with their colorful deserts on your table. Colourful walls, Colourful chair tables, Wall posters, Led display panels showing their special menu items, Led strip lights everywhere, all of this not just creates a funky theme, it also makes a Romantic ambience. Scoop's ambience is perfect if you are thinking about to take your girl out for a romantic dinner. Unfortunately no date for me this time :p.

Staffs & Management : There were waiter & waitresses in different dress codes. They were well trained, well behaved & well mannered. From the time we entered into the restaurant to guide us through the menu they helped us really well in every angle. After placing the order they took a very short time to serve us. They have also done a pro degree on garnishing foods & that was totally seen in every item they served us. After a dish or two they even asked for our feedback about the food was good or not. They pleased us very very well. Excellent Service, A big point goes for them.

Foods : Scoop covers a large number of cuisines from  Italian, Chinese, South Indian, North Indian, Deserts & of course Ice Cream. So their menu card seems like a food dictionary too. Their colourful menu card is so big that a pro foodie can fall in little confusion. After seeing a number of reviews I came to a conclusion what should we order.

Creamy Cheese Sauce Penne Pasta with a combination of Cheese, Butter & Cream : 
The flavour of cheese covered up the place as soon it came to our table. In a single glace I observed that it was made with real perfection & love. It was served really well. The first bite of this just melts into the mouth. The dish tasted extremely cheesy & creamy. Very light spices were used but it holds up the taste really long. In simple words, It was such delicious that words can't explain. Creamy Cheese Sauce Pasta was very much preferable for me & an absolute recommended over here.

Spicy Chilly Garlic Noodles with Jap Chicken :
Wow, to the way it was served in a bowl. It looked like Chinese heaven. Noodles were very thin & very well fried. There was kind of mixed flavour of smoke & tangy sauce in the noodles, that was mixed with nicely sliced vegetables. The best part was yet to come. The chicken pieces tasted like heaven. A juicy cheesy flavor was coming from inside & that just melted into the mouth. The dish was very spicy but fortunately not very hot, just absolute likeable. By the way the quantity was average & there were 4 pieces of chicken in it, that would suite 1 person perfectly. Overall the dish tasted mind blowing & another must have over here.

Puppy Love : Now coming to their legendary ice cream. I was bit confused before ordering, between Eye Candy & Puppy Love. Then I thought Eye Candy is good for groups cause it comes with 5 scoops of ice cream. So I shatteled down with Puppy Love that came with 2 scoops of Strawberry & 1 scoop of vanilla served in a glass with full of cream on top. Oh, did I mentioned that colourful Cadbury Gems & choco chips were on it. Well my expectation for this was gone really high that time. Unfortunately it tasted very very simple. The ice cream felt good & all the common taste of other things that was used to make it were visible. It was perfect for two people to have. However it didn't surprised me with its taste that much. It wasn't bad either but an improvement can be done highly on it.

Pricing : Our bill for 2 with all the above mentioned items were Rs. 635. For me Zomato paid it all, So thanks to Zomato once again. Coming to the pricing segment I think for all the beautiful ambience, excellent service & delicious foods their prices are decently balanced that satisfies your pocket well.

Conclusion : Scoop is a restaurant that has been extracted from the Rainbow. Its a lovely colorful world inside, that is perfect to feel with your loved once over some sweet dishes made by them. Its an absolute recommend place from my side, even I am planing to visit this in near future too.

First of all i must say scoop is quite colourfull resto in new market. Had been there more than once. Have tried chinese food. Mostly i order the chicken cheese pasta which is served in a frying pan which is quite unique. The pasta taste and quantity is good. Also tried some ice cream mocktails over there. The garnish is very beautiful. But one con is that most of the items in the menu is not available. Otherwise ambience and staff behaviour is good.

Scoop brings back many of the childhood memories. Shopping at the New Market was always followed by eating at Scoop. And if it gets to be the Puja Season, you would definitely have to wait for a long time in the queue. Still, it was beautiful. I used to have the creamy pasta and a large sundae of chocolate ice cream with all the toppings and sauces. Haven't been to this place recently. Have plans to visit soon.
---UPDATE---
As planned, executed that way. I had come to Scoop for desserts after a long long time on the day of Eid after a titsy bitsy kinda lunch with my friend

I have been frequenting this place for over a decade. Whenever I accompany my mom to carry out her shopping from New Market it has been a ritual to grab a bite at Scoop. I make it a point to have the Chicken Steak Sizzler every time. The pizzas and burgers are also quite tasty and my mom raves about their masala dosa which is also pretty delicious. It is a place very close to my heart and it is highly recommended if you are looking for a quick bite after a tiring day, holding shopping bags.

It is in new market area near citi mart.  Ambiance is nice and interior is also good.
Service is little bit slow, billing process is also slow. 
I ordered cheeze dosa and it was good in taste,  since that day I was full, could not try other items, but would definitely try soon. Price is reasonable. 
Would recommend if you are in the area and want to spend some time with friends and family.

Have a weet tooth and in dire need of biting into a pretty looking, icy, creamy dish to beat the heat this summer? Look no further. Scoop is the place where you ought to be.

Location: a few minutes walk from Esplanade Metro Station. Scoop is located at the heart of New Market, or if specifically asked New Empire Building. In other and simpler words, take a left from KFC. You'd find Scoop to your right.

Food: Scoop is a wonderland for all the people out there who likes pretty places and pretty desserts. Known for both its decorative and innovative ways of plating sweet stuff, this place is a must go!

Creamy Pasta with Chicken: perfectly cooked penne smothered in delicious white sauce and seasoned delightfully right. I have never had as good as a white sauce pasta as this before. The meat was tender and soft and the cream went well with it. (5/5)

Chicken Steak: pieces of chicken breast accompanied with saut√©ed mushroom smeared in thick sauce. Frankly, there are better chicken steaks out there. The flavours did not pan out for me. The Steak was served with grilled vegetables on the side which included carrots, cauliflower, broccoli and beans, which were a bit too plain. (2.5/5)

Eye Candy: the star among the three course meal has to be Eye Candy. Five scoops of ice creams served in cones with a side of cotton candy. This dessert deserves a round of applause because of its quite unique presentation in a rather limited budget. The menu allows you to pick your favourite ice creams among an unusually large stretch of flavours. Few of the flavours that they features are: Tutty Fruity: a combination of fruits in an ice cream (3.5/5); Chocolate Chips- creamy chocolatey delight with sudden surprises of chocolate chips in bites [con: there are much better chocolate ice creams out there than this] (2.5/5); Strawberry Cheese Cake- strawberry flavoured ice cream with cheese cake [con: cheese cake flavour was missing] (3/5); Cr√®me br√ªl√©e- sweet creamy ice cream with a hint of strawberry (4/5).

Management: this pink, pretty place comes with a team of fast working, courteous staff. Service here is a fast. Cleanliness is spot on. Full marks on the decor. You running a tight budget wouldn't stop you from grabbing a bite here, because the place is very pocket friendly too.

A nice place to spend some good time with some good friends. Food is ok, not of a very high quality.. I was rather disappointed with my chicken sizzler. I guess its alwz safe to order and enjoy ice cream scoops only, in Scoop..
Some cute and pink servings have been newly added in scoop's menu. I loved the presentations of the servings.

Its been many many years, since I had visited them last, so this review of mine is definitely not going to reflect on their current state.

Perhaps, the most popular places in and around Explanade region, Scoop has been an obvious destination for youngsters since the past couple of years, whenever it meant having quality food accompanied with some chit-chat. The first time I had dropped in here was some 12 years back. I loved the ambiance. A bit hard to describe by as I haven't been there in years, but I can easily recollect the bright lightnings and the friendly staffs.

I began to be a regular here after the bar at Lighthouse had shut down. Their Thai Section was shifted to Scoop and I have no shame in admitting, that I was a die-hard fan of their Chicken in Oyster Sauce. One or two common staffs, who were also transfer ed to Scoop, I had absolutely no issues in communicating with them. It was even later, that the Thai Section again got shifted to a brand new restaurant just beside Scoop, which was perhaps known as the 'The Oriental Plaza'.

Apart from the Thai Offerings, I loved their drinks. Good shakes (As I can recollect) was one of my obvious choice to quench the thirst. Their food however was mostly inconsistent. I remember of having visited them sometime int he year 2009 or 2010, and me and my friend were served with two horrible tasting sizzlers. We had to desert out food in the midway, and instead go to Aminia to complete our meal.

Not that I am complaining, perhaps things have changed for good in the past couple of years. May be it hasn't. But Scoop will always remain special to me, for the ¬†sheer memories I have had at this place, with my friends. Hope to find the familar face of the captain from Lighthouse Bar once again. :-)

Whenever I go to New Market I makr it a point to visit this place as I am a huge foodie.I love this place coz it is a multi cuisine restaurant and serves all types of dishes. The prices are reasonable,good service and hospitality and food quality is extraordinary. The thing I like the most is their numerous variety of ice creams...its just yummy...and all ice creams contain fried cashews ,chocolate saue and chocolate stick.The main attraction for me to go there is their mouth watering ice creams and the way they present their dishes is just fabulous..

Well nowadays you have everything in your city right !! The European delicacies, the Mexican , Spanish , more than countable mughlai and Chinese outlets . But amongst all these there lies some very few joints which have its on charm and no matter wherever you go you won't find it anywhere else .

So, you are with your loved one and hopping around new market and suddenly feel hungry "Scoop" should be one of your top destinations . I love the seating arrangements where the tables are located in various nook and corners of the restaurant as a result of which you can always enjoy a cosy time with your beloved . You will get a mix culture of people coming in since it is located at the heart of new market . 

Those arijit Singh and ankit tiwari songs will transform you to a hopelessly romantic type of a mood if you are into that sort of stuff . You won't get into fine dining almost everyday in your curriculum. 

Location :- Very easy to find . Ground floor of New empire of cinema hall.

Food :- Now the most important part , scoop offers a variety of choices starting from sizzlers, fish fry , burgers , sandwiches , milkshakes , coolers ,ice teas and also Chinese and mughlai . You name it and they will serve it .  We although decided to have the following : -

--------------------------------------------------------------
        STARTERS
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Fish Fingers ( 5 / 5 ) :- Although this is pocket pinch restaurant I wondered how can a plate of fish finger cost 194 rupees but I was too hungry and craving for some fingers so I ordered it and it simply won my heart . I have attached the pic so you can clearly see how they are served . Served in a basket which is on a top of wooden plate . And they had added some mayonese and potato chips as add ons . I promise you those were some delightfully tasty fish fingers . There were 8 pieces which we munched upon delightfully .
 
2. Eggs Nest ( 3.5 / 5 ) :- This was more of an experimental try . These are basically poached eggs served as sunny side up upon some deep fried potatoes . The fried potatoes " jhuri alu bhaja " looks like a birds nest and the egg yolk upon in looks absolutely yummy . The only problem with this dish was it was less salty . If you put a little salt on it , trust me these are 2 little pieces of delicious egg bombs .

--------------------------------------------------------------
  MAIN COURSE
-------------------------------------------------------------

1. Chicken cheese burger (4 / 5 ) :- With true honesty this was a nice burger . Not over exaggerated the party was yummy and had adequate cheese to make it a super cheesy experience with every bite . To me the burger was a winner .

-------------------------------------------------------------
 DESERTS & COOLERS
-------------------------------------------------------------
 
1. Vanilla milk shake ( 5 / 5 ) :- You can't say you ever had a bad vanilla milk shake because it is one hell of a combo . Served in a quite big proportion it was enough for 2 of us to quench our thirst especially when we were having the burger . 

2. Miss sparkle bunny vanilla ice cream ( 10 / 5 ) :- Yes that's how I will rate this dish . Firstly , the presentation was beautiful . The ice cream was served in a wine glass with plastic flowers beneath it . It was once again on top of a wooden plate . And accompanying it was a toy bunny which on shaking it glowed . It was so childish that we laughed the hell out of it . The ice cream was yummy , vanilla was mixed with coconut and served with bourbon biscuits . I will never forget this dish . It's a bummer that they took away the bunny in the end as it was only for show . But by then, it had already won our hearts .

Service : - The staff is really very attentive and they will help you with everything you need .

 Sometimes you have to adjust urself with the places you are visiting , once again I am stressing this that you won't find a fine dining experience everywhere . But in scoop you will get your wishes fulfilled . Do try their snacks as they are not popular for their main dishes . We had a wonderful time today and whenever I am in new market , scoop will always be in my mind .

I have been a reagular here literally since my childhood. One of its main attractions is its location. Being located in new market one can never find this place empty, be it afternoon or evening. The various desserts and ice cream sundaes are definitely the highlights here. I cant pick any favorites because they are all equally heavenly! The red sauce pasta(chicken) is a dish I have each time I go here. The french fries here are one of the best I have had. All in all this place provides a welcome respite from the heat outside and allows one to gather energy for another round of shopping!

Paid a visit to the once iconic hangout in New Market area after a long gap. Scoop has changed a lot since. The menu now offers Continental, Chinese, South Indian & Mughlai dishes. And of course their signature & yummy Sundaes are there too. They have also come up with innovative ideas of presenting the Sundaes which I liked too much. Really felt nostalgic after visiting.

I've visited this place many times. Their Chinese section couldn't satisfy me. But Italian section was better than Chinese. Staffs are gentle but one of the staffs behaved badly with me. We ordered one more plate kabab after finishing the main course and also ordered for the desert. She served the ice-cream before and when I questioned her she said "you've not mentioned what do you want first kabab or ice-cream." Okay whatever the experience was, their ice-cream was really excellent.

------
We ordered the pasta with tomatoes pesto basil... it was really nice but a bit oily. The vegetables could have been a bit more fresh...and the dish could have been a bit light.
The fish sizzler was just too good. The rice was light and fluffy with just enough flavours to pack a punch and the fish was fresh and tangy. The french fries were crispy but the hero of the dish is the mayo dip.
-----
The sundaes and ice creams are to die for. Do give this place a try. The staff was helpful too.
Cheers!

Scoop had become my grandmother's and mine personal favourite for around 6 months I guess. The place is really  pretty and is always full! We used to come here quite often and I must say, they serve some really good food. I have had lots of dishes here. 
Flaming Chilly Prawns were my favourite. Mind you, the batter on the prawns is a bit soggy but I somehow like soggy batters! So Yay!
The Chicken Fried Rice which has egg as well is very very tasty. It's got minimal ingredients but it still tastes great! The Sweet corn soup is disappointing as the balance is missing more often than not. On the other hand the cream of spinach soup is really tasty! 
I had once ordered grilled fish as well, and may I say... Wow! The fish was really amazing! Their south indian food is quite popular but I am not very keen about south indian food, so never tried it. The desserts are also really nice. They aren't nearly the best in the city but they are always pleasing. 
Now the reason this "was" my favourite restaurant is because recently the quality seemed to have dropped and as a result the price that earlier seemed fine to pay suddenly started to pinch. I am saying this on the back of multiple "average" visits of late and not just one day. Besides, any place can have a bad day! Buy here, I am positive there's a quality drop. 
I know the capability of this place very well and I hope to see it improve and reestablish its earlier set high standards! Good Luck! And yes, you must give this restaurant atleast one shot! Happy Dining!!

Environment is good, though it is crowed enough every time :)
Now coming to food.
We tried chicken kima dosa.. It was pretty good.
Newly introduced items egg nest was superb, eggcuse me could hv been btr - it was a bit salty, eggie moo - a little disappointed - it was greatly decorated but very sweet in taste

In drink we had a lassi.. It that was just superb.
Now coming to desert we had - miss saprkle bunny, taste is like normal ice crm but the decoration will give u the birthday celebration flavour, if u r not sure what is it at least go through the photos...

A very good experience... U should try :)

Cost: 1000 for two

Ha ha ha ha!

First,we have to wait for near about 1 hour.
Then we have to wait another 30 mins to get the "menu card".

Dn waited for another 40mins after ordering.

We thought may be they took too care about their food,so the took time too much.

But the taste of food!

I don't wanna write more.

I wanna give you "negative" marks...2 for decoration.

Please try keep fast serving and try to make better dishes!

Price quality is much more than food quality!

The perfect pocket friendly place to have dessert in Kolkata. Located at New market area, just beside KFC and dominos and the new empire cinema hall, it operates in one of the most busy places in Kolkata. Me and my friended visited and ordered French fries with mayo sauce (their speciality), chicken cheese rice, fresh lime soda and cold coffee with ice cream. Each was better than the other and especially the chicken cheese rice turned out to be a real surprise. I will definitely recommend all of you to visit this place. Here's hoping for more surprises on our next visit!

Located in New Market.
The ambience is good and seating arrangements are comfortable.
Went on an evening to taste a scoop of 'Scoop'. Had Sandwich and Cold Coffee.
Sandwich was satisfactory while Cold Coffee left me with disappointment.
(I've a great affinity for Cold Coffee so )
It was so watery and didn't have thick layer of milk. Adding to it, they had put ice cubes which did worse to it.

However after lodging a complaint to the waiter, they changed it. The next time when they served was satisfactory again !
High time they keep a check on this.
But but !! The staffs are courteous.

Hoping to have a nice time on my next visit. :) Cheers !

Looking for a decent place to eat in the hawker infested new market area,this might be an option.Really peppy interiors ,splashed with all sorts of colours and lights.However not so untouched by the chaos and clutter of the place its located in.Every type of food is available here-continental ,Italian,south and north indian,specialising in nothing yet nothing special about anything.
  Decent place if you are in a group and every one prefers different foods and nothing specific,a restaurant to unite all.However Its a good place if you are craving milkshakes and ice creams.Lots of varieties.

Been there quite a few times and every time I had a different experience. But the last time was indeed very terrible and I literally have stopped visiting Scoop! I had gone with my mom and sister in the afternoon and we had ordered Chinese. The staff were not at all willing to help to serve and I had to call thrice for the waiter before I helped myself. The food wasn't up to the standard; the Chicken Sizzler was nice but the Jap Chicken was very oily. Hopefully in the near future if I ever visit Scoop, I hope I don't face such problems.

A nice, pocket friendly place in new market area which makes it popular among the masses. They offer a wide variety of options including chinese, north Indian dishes, sizzlers and a number of ice creams and drinks. Visited this place a number of times. Tried biryani with chilly chicken combo, dosa, chicken ala king sizzler, kebabs. The quantity is plenty considering the price and the quality is good. The service is fast and the staff are friendly as well. You can also get good discounts in happy hours or by liking their Facebook pages. Overall, 4/5.

This place keeps coming up with new menus for different occasions which kind of want to make you go back just to find out what's new. They have pretty cool offers going on also ask of which can be exploited to the customers benefit.
Speaking of the food, whatever I've ordered from the vast menu these guys offer, it has been pretty decent. Although, it would've been preferable if the costing was a bit pocket friendly. 
Please do not order the biriyani or the French fries if you do not want an oil overload. Also the French fries do not come with the promised mayo dip always. I ordered the ramen on my last visit and to my woes, not only did it taste like wai wai, it was too salty for the palette. Sandwiches are good. 
The decor is a bit too loud for my taste but it screams youthfulness. Also the staff is pretty friendly, although it would be nicer if they could pay more attention on the tables to see if their guests need anything further or if it's time for billing.
Overall a decent place to hang out with your friends and yes I will be going back to check out what's new.

It's a best youth nd family restro in Kolkata. We'll give 9.1 out of 10. As per our thinking it is a A class restro not only for the food but for the hosting also, and specially our dear frnd @Shankho for taking care of us so heartily. Our fixed item is fried chicken in Thai style specially tossed in sauce only for us. We are just mad about it.
 Stay Unique nd serve better.

Went to this amazing restaurant today at a friend's suggestion. It's a multi cuisine restaurant and has huge variety of foods to offer. Be it Chinese, north Indian, south Indian or continental snacks.
The menu has so much to offer that it took us a while to decide what to have exactly. Finally we zeroed on chicken ala king and mixed platter sizzler. Since both of them were continental dishes we first tried out chicken ala king. Oh my, the creamy cheese and shredded chicken combined with the parsley rice just melts in your mouth. Thoroughly enjoyed having it. The mixed platter sizzler had chicken, fish,prawn, lots of veggies and rice. Very well cooked and full marks for a unique garnishing.
The staff was really very cordial and the ambience was equally good.
Will visit yet again to try out their other cuisines.
Keep up the good work Scoop!!

This outlet of Scoop is situated at ground floor of new empire building in New Market near Esplanade Metro station...
After shopping at Big Bazar ,when our tummies were starving for foods we decided to go to Scoop... Watching the rating 3.2 of Scoop in zomato I didn't have so much expectations from the place...
but after having the lunch ...let me tell you that I don't believe the rating should be so low it should be minimum 4 ...
The Decoration and the Ambience is very much attractive and beautifully organised ... Food was also good ...
They have lots of items from multi cuisine... but the best part about them is the desserts specially the icecreams...
We had
German Potato Salad
Spanish Omlette with Potatoes
Quick Gun Murg Gun Pizza
Sizzler
Pehla Nasha with sparkle
Confused Identity
Hot Dark Chocolate
Now the names of every dishes there were very funny and attractive...
German potato salad was salads and potatoes mixed in mayonnaise and the plate was placed on ice cubes ... it was scrumptious...
Spanish omelette was mix of one thick omelette, two sandwiches, mushrooms and veggies... tastes good...
Pizza was very crunchy and tasty...and sizzler was also spicy and good in taste...
Confused Identity was a cooler of lichi and apple juice with pepsi on top... and was lip smacking...
Hot Dark Chocolate was served as hot liquid chocolate and cream and Marsmellows on top...
Pehla nasha was a dessert with two scoops of icecreams and one pastry cake...but how they served it, was amazing... it's written there Pehla nasha will come with a sparkle and it actually did...they lit up a sparkle cracker beside the dish... And it looked attractive... and  literally drew everyone's attention over the sparkle...
The service was also good... Even now there are some offers running...
Just for liking 2 pages in facebook (Scoop and Spice) we had 10% discount on our bill...
Overall it was a good experience having lunch over there...
#A Must Try for their winter special desserts...

I have been to this place on numerous occasions. Good desserts and ample starters are the main attractions. They whip up themes on Valentine's days!

Food: Its quite tasty but quantity feels less for its price especially for crispy chili baby corn or Greek salad that I had there. The cold coffee frappe was average.

Service: Service was swift but difficult to get attention of the waiters n waitresses, seemed a bit under staffed for the large floor space they enjoy.

Ambiance. Pretty good usually. On weekends its pretty crowded ¬†so it might be difficult to get a seat. But there's lot of space to wait around!

Verdict: I would recommend this place for different types of dosas, starters, and awesome desserts n sizzlers.

The restaurant serves a good combination and variation of Indian, Chinese, English, Ice cream, Desserts. It is situated just in the New Market area, in a narrow lane but the food served was of good quality and the price was ok(though the quantity for some of the food was not too much).
When searching for a hygienic eating destination with a comfortable environment in the new market area, we can definitely visit this place.

Scoop is situated next to citi mart in esplanade and its in the same building of new empire cinema hall which is pretty easy to locate , now let's talk about the food you get here to my surprise this place has a lot of options in terms of ice creams , desserts and foods .
So let's talk about the fast food that I ate it like sandwiches which was accompanied with some wafers which were fresh enough and good on terms of quantity and quality and then after that i decided to try some ice creams so I chose the sundae and it was quite huge to complete but I did enjoy the treatment as it did not take much time for preparation and at the end I was a happy man walking out .

I would like to differ with the rating of 3.2 on Zomato!
The location is fantastic, bang in the middle of new market in the street food (momore, tea junction) alley.
I had visited on 5th Jan. They had a beautiful and very tempting Christmas special menu! U r not hungry if you look at the menu display outside and still don't step in. 
We ordered the Hot Nutella, Hot Pinky, Granz Trotter soup and the lassi.
The hot nutella was delicious ! Too much calories but worth it. The only issue was the Trotter soup had no marrow as promised but chunks of mutton. The taste took me back to the perfect Irish stew. Hence no complains!

Chinese here is good and the waitresses are quite suggestive when it comes to choosing from the menu... cannot say it is a cheap place but nor  is it a pocket pincher... so iv a got very neutral opinion about this place... if u do not wish to have a special experience or some real great expection.. this is the place worth trying!!

Todays destination for lunch was Scoop in New Market area.This is in the same building as the KFC and Dominos.The place is big,so even though quite a few people were there it didn't  feel crowded.The decor is very colourful (a bit too much as per my likings).I had ordered for a plate of Chola-batura and my colleague had asked for some veg platter.The chola tasted okish to me since it lacked salt and since the baturas were VERY BIG i couldn't finish the whole meal.Even my coleague couldn't finish the whole combo she had taken,so quantitywise the food were good.

A place where I go back again and again. Earlier the fav item used to be the ice cream sundae. This is the place where I had my first sizzler at Kolkata. Nowadays my favorite is continental food. We ordered grilled fish, chicken steak, masala idli and Oreo sundae on our last visit. The taste was awesome. The ambiance is very colorful now. One complaint, the portion size has reduced drastically. The grilled fish on rice bed had only one spoon of rice as if for decoration purpose!

I have been here twice and on both occasions I was quite satisfied with the food served. It is located near New Market and even though I have tried only a handful of other restaurants in the area, I think its safe to say that there is no other restaurant nearby that serves as many items, available on the menu, as over here. It has everything from north Indian to Chinese, south Indian to Italian, continental and of course the most important DESSERTS. The last one is their speciality but I will come to it later. The ambience is really good and the restaurant is quite spacious and the staffs who take orders and serve foods, are probably among the best in Kolkata, they are all really young and quite smart and really quick in taking orders and serving up the food, the place is usually full at lunch hours but even at peak hours their service is top notch, but that's not the best thing about scoop, it's their desserts that really makes this place stand out. The last time I visited the place I had fried chicken(which was really delicious and crisp), special mix noodles(which was also pretty good) but the best thing was the sundae that I had ordered, the moonrocker, this thing was out of this world, they offer a wide variety of sundaes and even other regular ice creams, if one is visiting the new market and wants to grab a quick brunch or wants to have some of the best ice creams served any where in Kolkata, then this is the place.

Today we were there around 12-05 pm. The service was not started and they said if we order now, it will take minimum 20 minutes for them to serve the food. We were okay with it. After the served Starters, within 1 minute they served the main course. Obviously our main course got really cold. Lady attendants are very ignorant. Didn't even bother to serve the food to our plates. Why? I mean I pay for the service, but the ignorance are laziness of your lady servers really irritating. "Eat and Run" thing, next time I will go to Scoop, eat my food and just Run, without paying the bill.

One of my fondest memories of ice cream is associated with scoop! Way back then, the decor was a little more sombre with mellow lights. And the tutti frutti was the best. But they have kept pace with changing times and taste and how! 
The decor is vibrant and happy hues dominate with mirrored walls.
Honestly, ice cream is not a novelty. Yet what sets scoop apart is the generous add ons and the presentation. If you are a chocolate fanatic definitely try pehla nasha and puppy love- a thoroughly chocolate bonanza. If you are looking for other flavours, tutti fruity or banana splitz will please you!
Apart from ice creams they serve pretty good french fries and thin crust pizzas!

Two back to back bad experiances. The day before, ordered simple veg sandwich and french fries. Sandwich used stale bread and french fries had no salt. Today went with my sister and ordered pasta and fench fries. This time fresh fries was right but pasta was seriously under cooked. This possibly will be my last visit. I am overlooking the loud obnoxious music and cramped up sitting arrangement.

Situated between City Mart and KFC in new market, this food parlor has opened recently. We suddenly discovered this place. Ambiance is nice and place is large enough. You can get any cuisine from italian to mughlai in here, Also bengali dishes are available. Price is not so cheap. Serving time is average. Quantity is strictly for one people and if you are foodie then I think you need another plate of it.
We ordered pasta cottage cheese sandwich, kitkat shake, hot chocolate. Sandwich and shake were good, hot chocolate was a big let down. It was just a cup of complan health drink.

I visited this placed yesterday for the 2nd time
and realised that its a mistake on my part. If I would have checked my own review , I would have saved myself to the horrible experience I had there. Only good thing is how this place looks. It begins and end there only.
Have to wait for more than 15 mins to get someone to take my order.
Ppl were so busy that they didn't had time for order even when I am asking them to come and take the order.
I ordered cheese masala dosa and chicken club sandwich combo.
In dosa though cheese was visible however there was no taste in the food. Didn't feel like eating and left the food.
Waited for half an hour more after dosa for the sandwich to arrive that too after asking so many times.
Asst manager came n ask if we need anything , when I told him that m waiting for sandwich for such a long time and if the dish is not ready we can cancel it, then he went looking for my dish. French fries was cold and not crisp at all, sandwich was not cut from the middle like we get in other places I.e coffee world.
The plate was so dirty in which the sandwich was served that didn't feel like eating and got it packed which I later handed over to the beggar outside.
We have to ask for tissue paper and wait for 10 mins to get that. While paying the bill when I asked for the container in which I ask the sandwich to be packed people had no clue what I ask for.
ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING PLACE.
If you have money to waste, not expecting good food and have lots of time, then visit this place.
Posting the pic of dirty plate.

1st review.
Went there for the first time, the decor was good. Service and food was not good. It has free WiFi but it never connects. Order a burger the bread was not at all fresh. The person on the counter does not know how use swipe a card, after a few attempts he called someone and ask how to swipe it.

The place which describes itself as a dine-n-run place is actually that. Right in the heart of Esplanade area, this place is a good option to grab a bite in between all your shopping or even before/after catching a movie. The food, that we had ordered, Jeera rice and Murg Bharta, was sufficient for two people and tasty too. It's a pity that we could not try out any of the tandoor items as they were unavailable during Durga Pujo. I would love to go back to try more of that and maybe even the Continental fare.

P.S.  We got a 10% discount on the bill amount because we had liked the Facebook page of the restaurant. Cool deal really.

Giving 1 star as that is the least you can give!!
We ordered mixed sizzler and spanish omlet.

Mixed sizzler was the worst possible you can imagine.It had 3 pieces of cold potato, looks like collected from roadside kachuri stall, some dam-aloo gravy, one chicken cutlet, one fish cutlet and one semi boiled chewy mutton chop.Yes, you are reading it right, these were part of sizzler!!!! You need to pay 310 plus taxes for this shit

Spanish omlet was egg fried with potato and onion. No I haven't missed any ingredients!!. It had grilled tomato and butter sauteed mushrooms and 2 slice of buttered bread!!

Had to go to KFC to complete lunch!!

Location: At the Heart of Esplanade, right opposite Sreeram Arcade and between KFC and Domino's pizza.
Ambience: Owing to its location, Scoop is always full!! The lights and the cute frames on the walls add a vibrant charm to the place.
Food: I have had a lot of dishes from their menu, and I havent had anything which wasn't tasty! Their pasta (both white and red saucs) , noodles (chicken and mixed) and biriyani are tasty. But best are the main course chicken dishes and their desserts.

Con: Their only deficiency is their staff. Most of the staff have a 'don't care' attitude and you need to call for 5/6 waiters before one of them comes to attend you. This aspect of the place is very annoying. And I guess the staff need to learn to be polite and promt!

Besides this, a Foodie will surely love Scoop!

I have been to scoop many times before and found it okay. But this time the experience was a little different. On Saturday afternoon I went with my mom after a marathon puja shopping. We had to wait for sometime before we got a table. The food has always been okay but this time found it tastier. But the best part was the service. The staff right from getting us a table to taking orders and serving...everyone was very polite and managed the rush too well. Kudos to the team! Ambiance was very merry and bright! We had dosas and the pudina chutney was really tasty. Good place to check in if your starving after the shopping!

Scoop is a great place to hang out with friends or family. It is a young, hip, zippy and colourful one. The place is located right underneath the New Empire at Esplanade. The menu is variegated. Well ot indeed proffers different South Indian, North Indian, Bengali and Chinese cuisines that we all by and large do come across at several other restaurants. But the TRP of this place lies in its range of desserts and juices. The range is good and they are experimental. Also the facts that the price is cheaper and located around the New Market shopping area, it can be touted a more favourable destination for mostly shoppers. The people intending to have only quick snacks can also head for this place.
P.S The toilet above that is usable for restaurant-goers is not at all good. It's unclean and not even scarcely maintained. Another problem one may encounter is that the restaurant gets really populated by evening so one may have to get one's feet in a queue.

A friend insisted that we try out this place to grab a quick lunch. I really loved the ambiance and the decor of the place. It was full of colors and packed with excited faces and quirky furniture. The french fries with the mayonnaise was crispy and the quantity was much more than I had expected. We also had pop chicken which was crunchy outside, and soft and juicy inside. The chicken as well as the batter was extremely flavorful and the hot sauce complemented it perfectly. I would definitely recommend this even though I felt that compared to the price, the quantity was less. The woktossed veg hakka noodles with the fresh veges, also tasted pretty good. There were lots of staff present but even then we had to call them about three or four times before they attended to us and this happened a couple of times. Their behavior was also pretty cold. They made us wait for a very long time even though people who arrived after us were served promptly. All in all I would love to go there again for the ice cream but I hope the staff are more courteous.

Recently discovered this oasis amidst the busy and packed roads of New Market. The vibramt decorations and colours automatically energises you.

Didn't have that much of time to actually taste everything but the pizza here is absolutely to die for. Its tastes nothing like the dominoes or pizza hut pizza. It definitely is a class apart. We had ordered for the "quick gun murg gun" pizza. And it was simply delicious. 

Waiting to go back and try more of waht they have to order.

A multi cuisine, spacious, colorful restaurant. The first look will make you fall in love with it. However, one should not go by the looks alone. I have been there twice and both the times, I had to wait for a long time for, 
a) The waiter to come and take my order,
b) The waiter to come and give my order.
The staff working there have not been taught the meaning of hospitality as none of the times have I seen them sport a smile on their face. 
The pricing is moderate and the food taste is average as well. 
My suggestion is that you can give this place a miss unless you have a goal of visiting all the places in Kolkata.

Very bright, colorful, spot lights on tables, frames of quotes, great personalities, etc hanging on the wall. In food we had ordered Chicken Club Sandwich which was quickly & freshly served with mayonnaise & chicken stuffing and chips tasted good. In drinks we order Cappuccino and when they served it cookie was the bonus surprise for us. The staffs are very good and friendly. Its a pocket friendly & good place to hangout and chill.

Its interior is very good and the food is yummy. I have tried the chicken ala king and grilled fish, believe me its too good.

This place located at the heart of new market is perfect for having a after shopping lunch. I have visited this place a few time now. The sizzlers are a must try. In January I tried the chicken cheese burger for the first time. It was just delicious! So this friday me and my friend decide to go there again. This time the meal was served on a cute dish. Though the place we sat was just beside the counter and a carpenter was busy working, i guess if you have perfect food and a good company nothing else matters. :) And i will go back there again for the burger!

Food quality is ok. The worst service i have received is from scoop. And its not only for the 1st time or the 2nd time or even the 3rd time, its everytime. Not even for once have i been served at the right time. Made me wait a minimum for 20mins everytime. Last time i had ordered a combo meal which had grilled sandwiches with french fries. It arrived after half an hour. When i had received the order the dish was already cold.

The table for 2 is really small. the serve water in a steel glass, which is not cool. the waitress dont know how to smile or the minimum gesture. I ordered sizzler there, which was 200rs, and a total waste of money. I had sizzler of other places too, but sizzler of scoop just sucks. the rice looked like it came from some cheap veg biriyani restaurant. They dont had any cheese corn, baby corn or mashroom and so less salade. The masala pepsi was one of the worst masala pepsi I ever had. They serve it in a small glass which actually looks like a small size bottle.. So I would say it was a total waste of money for me...

A very unpleasant experience! I had gone there few weeks back with my family for a lunch. The food was okay type, but the worst part was their service. The waiters seemed very impatient and they were hardly attending us, although it was a weekday and the restaurant was quite empty. We had to ask them thrice to serve us, but nobody paid any heed. So we helped ourselves in the end.
The Manchurian chicken was overdone and the chicken fried rice tasted bland.
I hope they will look into these matters to come up with a better way to serve the customers.

The service is not at all good.. I visited this place twice but my last visit was a horrible experience.. We ordered 4plates of non-veg pastas and was asked to wait..after almost 15minutes later, 1 of the waitress comes and apologies that they made 3plates of non-veg pastas & 1 plate of veg pasta "by mistake"..& she convinced me to accept else their food will be wasted.. I mean who does that?? After that we were kept waiting for about another 20minutes and then we got the ice-cream sundae(puppy love).. Never experienced such a bad service..

visited twice. first on the christmas eve. fabulously decorated, eye catchy, simply unforgettable. had to wait because all the tables were occupied. they made us waiting inside. friendly behaviour.¬†finally we managed to get seated middle of a row. kashmiri pulau, mutton rezzala which i had, are not recommended. i mean if you cook these by yourself at home, it will taste better. ordered spicy chilly chicken because the rezzala felt very ordinary, dull. but had a good time. at least i could control the fire inside my belly :P¬†second visit- new years eve. same experience. ¬†i love their deserts. i heard pizzas taste really good here. i recommend sizzlers, ice creams and chillers.¬†wish to call myself an often visitor of scoop again.photos not taken. ll take next time. ;)

This spot is extremely extraordinary to me in light of the fact that it brings back such a large number of recollections. My didi, my companions used to bring me here in the wake of shopping in new market. The stylistic theme of this spot is exceptionally polished and shading. It will make you say Amazing! 

I ordered for rice and chicken. As regular its alright.  Whenever I come, I always go  for as you like it (sundae), contains bunches of nuts n chocolate sauce. I simply adore it. 

The stuff are okay but always very busy however an excessive amount of occupied, and without a doubt needs a considerable measure of change.

It was a weekend visit......crowded at downstairs, upstairs is quite calm but i would recommend stay at downstairs because of the environment. Now the food....! I dnt know it was our fortune or what...the items cheated on us :). Bar -B Q chicken came with bone! Chicken pieces were wings part...which never go with bar-b-q, as far i know it should contain the chicken breast meat! We went with the expert, (the waitress!! as she claimed that the chocolate cake is awsome), but alas!! Cake was not upto the mark, it was rathr a brownie!...so overall 'below expectation'.

Although reasonable but the place is not at all a good option to have lunch or dinner. Very negligent service with bad hospitality. Along with bad food u can feed urself starting from dead flies to hair as the toppings.... Don't dare to try the crispy crunchy lamb its a wastage of money as the dish is burnt while cooking.... When its time to pamper ur taste buds or to pacify ur hunger don't visit this place .... It will spoil ur hunger, health n mood.

Visited last sunday. We ordered paneer Jhalfrezy, egg chilly chicken biryani,naan and tandoori roti. Though the order took some time, The taste of paneer jhalfrezy was good,paneer was fresh. Chilly chicken was very very spicy and gravvy was chilly hot. Egg was not fresh and looked dull. Ambience was ok. Overall a 50-50 experience but costs seems to be on higher side. Will avoid visiting next time.

Firstly the ambience of the place is really nice. Done in pink and the furnitures are simple yet sophisticated. Next comes the service. It was pretty quick.
Now the food.
It was amazing. 
I had non veg penne pasta in red tangy sauce and it popped open my taste buds. Also thebpan fried momos were mouth watering. The taste was really nice. I hope to be back there soon. And try something else. 
I gave it a 4 because compared to the price the quantity should be a bit more. But other than that. It's perfect. Heavenly eat out in the middle of all the hustle and bustle.

Been there at least 10 times in a year. Good food, good service, but sometimes overcrowded specially on holidays. 
Must try : Sizzlers, Grilled Fish (specially with garlic butter ) , Masala Dosa (sounds odd but try the chatney, thats awesome ), and any ice-cream sundee.
Must do : Planning for surprise for your girlfriend in Birthday visit Scoop and ask for Pehla Nasha sundee.

Scoop,located next to New Empire Cinema is a sheer blessing if you have been shopping in New Market and adjoining areas for day long and if you are dead tired and hungry! The vibrant colours and lights  used to beautify the interiors is very refreshing and make the ambience very nice. Choice of food items being plenty, you can choose from Chinese, Continental, Indian Tandoor or South Indian dishes. Yesterday it was a rainy day,and after my day-long shopping escapade with my family, i chose Scoop to chill and satiate our hungry souls. We ordered Masala Dosas, Plain Dosas, Veg Chilly Garlic Noodles and Non Veg Chilly Garlic Noodles. They also serve Chicken Dosas by the way, which I tried long bck..and liked it too. The filling of chicken keema inside the dosa is actually.too much.to finish. Yesterday's food was decent, but the Aloo filling in Masala Dosas was rather less. The Noodles, both Veg and Non Veg were great, however. Spicy, and full.of chicken, my Non Veg Chilly Garlic Noodles were awesome, and I had no reason to complain for what I ordered. The behavior of staff was nice too as they refilled our glasses of water almost instaneously. After paying the bill, also got a discpunt card for my next.visit. :)

This is one of those colourful and pretty places you don't come across often. Located at the Lindsay street in the New Market, this big joint is a treat for the eyes. The beautiful display of colours in their lights and ceilings and pretty chair and tables make Scoop a delightful place. I love scoop and i don't actually remember how many times I paid visit to this eatery. They have a multitude of dishes ranging from Italian to chinese bites as well as desserts which make you go ga ga. I love the pastas from here as well as the chinese dishes. I have never tried south indian from here so cannot recommend. This is a total value for money joint. But if you come here do try the pastas and desserts! They'll make your day. Btw do not forget to click pictures when you come (you'll know why once you visit Scoop). :)

Honestly i have been here only twice eventhough it is in such a great location.however i did not find the food extraordinary or anything above average and the price is a little expensive considering the quality and quantity of the food.i went there again after a year and was sad to see that the place has lost all its beauty and was extremely poorly maintained.moreover they served us stale food!!!and when we complained they reasoned with us that since we had already taken a bite the food wont be replaced!i would never suggest anyone to go to such a place where the people are least bothered about customer service and such rude attendants!

Treating myself at Scoop after an exhausting and rewarding shopping in and around new market area has now become almost a ritual . I somehow find this place to have this unique blend of nostalgia, peppy and delicious ‚Ä¶ well quite a hard combination to find ! ! At my recent visits I tried their egg nest(super cute super yum) ,Mango chicken salsa open sandwich and coffee . Their penny savers are quite a draw for the young crowd too. They also gave me this scoop card that gives you discounts and knick knacks on subsequent visits ‚Ä¶ but I was a bit disappointed as they did not give me the 15% discount on Tuesday to people who were wearing pink‚Ä¶ I accidentally I was in pink ! Well somewhere I know, despite the too pinky interiors , the bores in the false ceiling from where you can more often than not spot the peeping snout of a stuart little I am kind of going to drop by the next time I go ti mew market !

A long day of shopping at New Market invariably has to follow a a sinful indulgence here. This has to be my favorite ice cream parlor in the city. What I love most is the pink decor which will instantly make one feel like a character fro a Disney Fairytale. About the food, they are the most creative when it comes to their Menu. Gajar ka Halwa IceCream! I believe this is the only place which would serve that. Besides, they have customized menu during all seasons ("Sholoaana Baangali" food on "Naba Barsho" included). The sizzlers are a must-try. The best part, it is totally easy on the pocket with something for EVERYONE.

Scoop is primarily known for the Ice Cream of highest order it has been serving for decades now..Today amidst so many bakeries,desert joints this place may have lost its vigour partly but I remember from my childhood days this place was one of the Leading Ice Cream Players in the city..even today I prefer the classical flavours of ice creams served here..If I am not wrong till a point of time they used to serve primarily veg delicacies but nowadays they do serve some pretty tasty non-veg dishes as well.I would recommend to go for their starters and continental dishes.. Coming to the ambiance it is quite spacious and colourful giving it a modern,funky look..The seating arrangements are more like any Global food chains, so nothing classy about it..the service is prompt and servers are well informed it seems.. Coming to the food I never actually had a full course meal here,most of the time it is about some quick nibbles with Milk Shakes or Ice Creams before catching up for a movie at New Empire..I personally adore the Milk Shakes served here,quite refreshing..also I loved the momos the cook,actually quite tasty and filling..I would recommend the BBQ sandwich, the Chicken Pizza,Chicken Sizzler..They also serve some decent enough South Indian dishes..Personally I feel their Chinese spread is decent while their Indian spread is indifferent..Go for the Ice Cream specially,that holds the charm of this place..Do try their special Sundae.

visisted this place with my mom and my sis after a busy shopping day.Seeing the huge crowd we guessed it to be a good one.But we were disappointed.We ordered Biriyani with chilli chiken two masala dosa and aam panna because of the scorching heat outside.¬†
The food was not edible at all.Seems like they have missed most of the ingredients.And not only that they forgot out Aam Panna too.Its only when we reminded them they served us at the end of our meal.
Dont visit .Its better to go Park Street and have decent food rather than wasting money over here.

The first thing to catch up here is for the wifi.. Lol... Sounds weird I know. But after some bagful of shopping when you enter into this restaurant you actually glow up seeing the colorful lights of this place. The music and the ambience is all so well defined.
Apart from this, the prime purpose is to serve your tummy when you check into the menu card, it makes you all the more happy with thr pocket friendly price across the food items.
The quality of the food is good. The quantity is sufficient to suffice your hunger as well. The only improvent required is in the prompt service of the staff.
Please increase the staff count so that you fo not ignore those sitting in the 2nd floor, because yours is one busy outlet especially during the seasonal occasions. :)
Really happy and recommend those you are still waiting to pay a visit. :)

Regular size pizzaüçï isn't available. 2nd. The tomato ketchup is of a very cheap quality. 3rd. The advertised Wi-Fi is never available, half of the staff says it has technical problems, the other half of staff says it's fine but never tell the password.

This place is going down from my list!!
I have been there a lot of times none of my experience was pleasant, but this time they crossed my patience level..
Stale food. Yes, they actually served us stale smelly food. Ordered their new introduced in menu 'pehla nasha' .it came with two scoops of vanilla ice cream and one tiny piece of black forest cake. We took a bite and immediately had to call the waiter.
And to add it up when we requested for a replacement they refused telling us they cant coz we have already had a bite of it. Wtf! This is how you treat your customers? We ordered for our bill and left immediately.
I have been to hell lot of restros all my life, this was by far the worst one. Both service and foodwise. The quantity of evry item is too less and takes too much time to serve.
I am sorry but today what they did was beyond my tolerance, hope others read this review and learn soemthing.

Quite a nice place to visit with friends. I visitted here long time back but writing a review now. They make good chicken steak, Pizza, pasta and noodles. I have also tasted some basic ice cream that they serve very nicely decorated. Its a quite place to hang out after a busy shopping period.

One of my closest friend got placed recently and hence it was treat time. It was a sultry n blisteringly hot Sunday noon. We entered at about 1 O' clock. Four hungry lions.?
We decided to skip starters as there is not much option to choose from. Now this is one area where scoop needs to improve.

Coming to the main course my foodie friend Shubharthi opted for fried fish which came with with boiled veggies, chips and a lip smacking dip. I don't know its name neither do I know what was it made of. All I know is that it tasted amazing. Recommended?Hell yes..
I went for a simple chicken steak. Thankfully the chicken was well cooked and so was the veggies. And it came with bread rolls as i do not prefer rice. Only drawback was that they had sprinkled too much of pepper in the steak. It tasted more like a stew than a steak. Not recommended.
Other two could not decide what to choose so I thought baked pasta would be a good idea but the waitor informed it would take 45mins. We immediately discarded the idea n asked for pizza. Sadly it was not available. So we went for the signature dish chicken ala king and a chicken sizzler. Chicken sizzler contained chicken mutton fish and a poached egg and rice.Quite simple and well prepared. Chicken ala king was a bit disappointing. It contained pitiful amounts of boneless chicken almost lost in the sea of cheese. No complaint about the taste though. However we were not quite satisfied so we ordered a basil noodles with prawn. It was the best main course. The noodles tasted out of the world and me being a die hard Chinese lover could not keep my hands off the plate. The prawns were a little bit undercooked but the amazing taste and flavour made up for it.

For desserts we had Tiramisu and chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream. I had never had Tiramisu before and just loved it. Recommended.
The brownie was disappointing to say the least. It was too dry and had a bitterish taste. Do not go for it even if u see other people trying it.
Overall ambiance is nice and this place is cheap as dirt. Service is a bit slow.

A 3.5 it would have been but the plus .5 for the colorful decor. Its one of those places we Bengali's refer to as "Mon valo Kore dewa jayga".

Not one of those places for having fine dining or going back twice. But a very pocket friendly place for hanging out with friends. Thumbs up Scoop :-)

I actually never expected such a crowded place like Esplanade to have such a lovely place to hangout. I visited the cafe with a bunch of friends on a lazy evening and were delighted to the light rock music being played. They serve a huge range of variety here. Starting from Continental to South Indian cuisine. The cost of the dishes is very moderate and will keep our pockets happy. I had ordered BBQ Burger and was overwhelmed to see the way they presented the dish to me with complementary chips and mayo salad. The very look of the dish quenched my hunger. I was super impressed. The sizzlers offered here are also very delicious. My friends ordered shakes and ice-creams. Even the ice-creams were served to us with lovely garnishing. The staff are extremely friendly here and I would recommend people to visit this place while their shopping sprees in Esplanade area.

I quite love this place for its versatality.

Great Ambience.Its colorful as well as a little dim.
Menu ranges from north indian to chinese to italian.

We ordered chicken pineapple pizza.The chicken pieces felt not fresh.It was my first time trying out a pineapple pizza and I quite liked it.

Like most esplanade restaurants,this one is quite affordable.

Try it.Not bad.

All time favorite joints for icecream.... and you must try their signature item... As you like it.... I can't give comment on their food since I only had icecream there. So my rating is only for the icecream I had there at least 50 times since my college days.

Situated at one of the most busy area of Kolkata.. And it offers a wide variety of foods.. Tried their drinks, and all of them are tasty! They have mazing burgers and sandwiches and are pocket friendly.. Last time tried their chicken steak, which although I found too salty for my taste buds and bit clumsy.. Other than that rest is pretty good.. Quite a nice place..

Now this is a cool place to rest and grab a bite while shopping amidst the great Esplanade crowd and frustration.
Coming to the frustration part - if you're frustrated already ,this place could rejuvenate or annoy you . Depends. The interiors are either great or disastrous -depending on what mood you walk in with.
Food is good and fresh. Overpriced. But honestly -you won't regret.

Been to this place quite a number of times. I don't remember being dissapointed after having the food. Range of options are really good and it is one of the restaurants where they know how to maintain a multi cuisine affair. Portions served are pretty satisfactory and filling.
I have had chicken alfredo pasta, cream of chicken soup, chicken manchow soup, few starters and even masala dosa. All were nicely prepared and good to taste. Even the waitors and waitresses are well behaved and helpful.
The only thing I dislike about this place is the too very colourful interior. The moment you enter Scoop, it's like you are visiting some Disney land or something. Must say all that colour becomes irritating and confusing at times. :/ And yes another thing is they donot have a washroom of their own and if you ask they will redirect you to the washroom of New Empire movie hall which is needless to say P A T H E T I C !
For the food and pocket friendliness of it, it is a place worth visiting.

The place used to be nice. Then they made the items costlier, quantity lesser. At times the food isn't half as tasty. The place is nice though. But why can't their food change for the better.

Went to search for a good restaurant in new market area . had gone to Oberoi but didn't find it good from cost vs quality point of view. we found this good looking restaurant quite nearby. it had a rush and I got the idea that it's a super hit.and no doubt it was. the bengali thali is a must and it was the most attractive  thali .it had all Bengali savouries u  would want .the penny savers were quite good and   The Chinese food was also amazing .the  quenching mango indeed quenched my thirst and The Misti doi was sumptuous .it is a great outing for family and if u re planning to go to the Grand Oberoi  Think twice. This would most probably  be a better option

This was among the few restaurants which I visited during my last visit to Kolkata. It was the night of Ashtami when we entered this place. We ordered Chicken Biriyani. I must mention that the Biriyani tasted wonderful. The interiors were also good. The only complaint towards this joint is that the food can be a little cheaper and it takes a lot of time to come to your table. Otherwise this place is good enough for multiple visits.

What I like about scoop is it's decor. The bright and vibrant colours really give you a happy feeling. From the floor to ceiling you can see efforts made on decoration. It is spacious and I don't think you will face trouble to get table. This multi coloured restaurant has  huge menu. You will find Indian, Chinese, Continental and various desserts. Some combo meals are also there on the list.

By now I'm to believe that they have good aesthetic sense as they also present their food beautifully. But the disappointing part is the quantity. The quantity is very less at times and it varies time to time. So, you can't just order,  rely on them and relax. The service is also very late.

The tandoori chicken was really good but again the side dishes were not up to the mark. I have a mixed feeling regarding scoop. They must update and improve.

The best thing I liked here is the ambiance. It is a melange of colours I tell you. It is spacious, colourful and perfect for a fun hangout place with your friends. I ordered an eggstatic , and two bowl meals. One was a basil flavored Thai noodles with hot garlic prawn, while the other one was spicy hot noodles with Japanese chicken. The eggstatic sandwich was served with fries. The egg was good, it has mushrooms and other goodies. The Japanese chicken was the best, quite akin to KFC's hot and saucy. The spicy noodles tasted good. The Thai noodles were a different taste altogether, the prawns could have been better. The service was prompt, and they were very gracious. Oh and also, the music was amazing.

My friends and family and I, we have been going to this joint for years now. Even before they decided to go all bubblegum pink and lime green. Honestly, i liked the old decor better. But when it comes to food, very few other places in town offer such a large variety at such a reasonable rate. Located at the shoppers hub in town, this is one of the few reputed eateries in the area that one can reach on foot, to take a much deserved break from shopping till they drop and satiate their taste buds. I'm a fan of their sizzlers and steak. Their combos and shakes are also quite good. Overall, a win win place for us when in new market.

Strangely, theres nothing great about this place but i still love going here out of all the places in this locality.

After a tiring shopping spree at new market area you can just go sit ,relax especially if its summers and you need an AC. :P

Well,  be honest i like the food here. Think of any cuisine and you will find it here. Be it Italian, chinese, conti anything...not to forget, you even get chicken khichudi.

One roof for all your cravings and hunger pangs after a hectic schedule at new market. Pasta, momos, desserts everything here is just so satisfying. The cost is absolutely pocket friendly almost like the outlets outside on the same lane with AC as a bonus.

Something worth mentioning after the food is the interior....wonder who was brain behind the colour scheme! Wont describe much...just go & check it out... :)

A nice and cozy restaurant to enjoy your meal after a hectic day of shopping...
I have been to this place long time back n had mostlt tried their chinese dishes...at that time they din't have so many variations in their menu...
Today we dropped in for lunch after doing some shopping...we ordered 2 fresh lime soda,one grilled fish and one fish sizzler...
The sizzler tasted great and so did the grilled fish..generous portions of fish fillet...with the right amount of vegetables...the dishes were a full meal in itself...
I woudn't say the prices are reasonable but they aren't on the high side either...
Worth trying once...

The outside wall attractions were beautiful and highly contradictory to the inner lighting and seating arrangements.
The colors and lights inside were too tacky making the ambience rating as low as 1/5

The food on the other hand.. Disappointed and impressed me both.
Suggested :
South Indian food,
Their chutneys are perfect
And so are their dosa's and uttapam

Not suggested :
Their fruit drinks and all, they are nothing but flavors in water

Chole bhature
The chole were raw and just sauteed last minute with the masala

Sizzler 
Their saffron rice were just orange colored, and there was no taste of saffron in it.

Food rating : 3/5

This place is good spot for hanging out with friends and loved ones. It's quite a relief point for the shoppers in this area. Have verious type of cuisine from Chinese to continental to bengali. Didn't like to discuss about the food because I of the food but just to spend the time. Resturent's penny saver menu is good combination and preety much affordable for college students as it fits their pocket money. The most thing I like about this place is the trendy looking waitresses wearing pink coloured Polo neck tee shirts. It gives it a nice youthfull trendy image of this place.

Nice environment and very good food. But faced a problem few days back, we had ordered for Chicken lollipop which was not cleaned and cooked properly. We had complained and the same was changed. After being changed the pieces were worst than the first time. Anyways it was a bad day for me as well the staff. The Lady manager was kind enough to listen patiently to our complain.

Something new that i discovered last day was PEHLA NASHA.. The way its served that was really eye appealing.

Visited Scoop after a couple of years. A mixed experience. The decor and ambiance was pleasant but service could be better. We were presented with the bill when we asked for the menu a second time to order ice creams. The waitresses were very slow to clear empty plates and bowls and had to ask them repeatedly. We ordered Chicken lolipop which were just about OK. Basil noodle thai style with hot garlic prawn was very good..esp the noodle. Spicy chilly garlic noodle with jap chicken was also good. Chicken fried rice came with very little chicken and was very bland. Schezuan chicken was tasted different but okayish. Left without eating sundae because Pehla Nasha, Paradise Found or Dark temptation all were unavailable. We ordered the first two, waited for several mins and then were informed that they were not available. Then asked for Dark Temptation and faced a similar experience.

In a busy area like New Market, Scoop from outside comes as a delight in terms of their seating arrangements and decor. But Food - Highly NOT Recommended! I with my colleague read the reviews and thought of trying food here since our office is nearby.

We had ordered for Chicken spring roll, Chicken cheese burger, Chicken Steak. All three seemed to be stale. The burger had chicken which was over cooked and it took away my entire teeth strength to chew. Steak was a very pale preparation. Lacked taste.

What was good about food - is the dessert part. We ordered for Pehla Nasha ice cream and Choco mud cake. The ice cream was normal and tasty. The cake was to die for. My 1.5 points go only for the cake. I might go again to the restro to just try their dessert section and specially mud cake.

Our bill was 920 and it was just not worth as the food was very disappointing.

One more thing they need to work on is - order timing, we waited for more than half hour just for our starter to reach us and also the music was just too loud Couldn't hear even what the person sitting opposite to me is saying.

My first time experience in Scoop was definitely not as I had expected!

your quick grab a bite joint in the new market area, which gives you that extra bit of service and quality at no extra cost!

My first visit to this place on midweek off day. I had a few things to buy from new market, and this proved to be the ideal no frills, pocket friendly choice of eatery in area. ¬†

The decor is too pink for my personal liking & looks like a barbie doll house.¬†
The food is reasonably priced and freshly served.

My friend opted for the spaghetti in white sauce/garlic bread/coke from the penny saver options. This, they got completely wrong and came with very little white sauce & a lot of green chillis/ red chilli flakes. Was taken back & the correct dish was dished out after another ten minute wait.¬†

I ate the chicken steak in pepper sauce which came with veggies and 2 bread rolls on the side.¬†

The hostess at the gate was friendly and promptly seated us as per choice. Unexpected in an eatery in this price bracket. The order taker was courteous ¬†as well, and informed us of the wait period of our order.

The place seems to be catering to budget tourists & young couples out on a budget date. Did I mention the couple at the next table ordered biryanis & the portions were enormous - ' beraal o dingiye jete paarbena ', as most bengalis would put it!

They also have screens above most tables, advertising slides of their current promos.

Well again a sudden plan of shopping with my college friend to new market. A weekday afternoon and it was too hot and humid outside. But yes.. Hats off to our indomitable energy. But then, we were too hungry and tired after shopping. We decided to drop in this joint when we noticed it from a distance. We occupied a table for two. The restaurant was quite crowded at that time, also being in a prime location it has to be so. Very nice, colorful interior with multi colored lighting. A large air conditiined space occupied by various types of comfortable designer seating arrangements. Some portraits are hanging from the wall. The pillars having colorful leaf and flower motif was an added attraction. Ambiance average. We ordered double fried lamb wrap, chicken ala king, pepsi. Chicken ala king was awesome and i didn't expect it would be this good here. The wrap was amazing and very spicy and hot. The outer cover was nothing but a roti and served with extra hot tomato sauce dip. And we had to order a dessert to cool ourselves down since pepsi was not enough. We noticed this pehla nasha on the menu. I just loved it. Black forest pastry was served with two scoops of vanilla ice cream with lots of chocolate sauce. It soothed our mouth and relieved us from the hotness. Service was good and price is very pocket friendly.

I have visited Scoop several time and my experience over the years have eld me to believe that Scoop is a very inconsistent place to eat at. The decor is very vibrant and bright with colourful chairs. The ceilings are brightly done and the whole place is a mix of multi-chromatic decorations. They have a huge menu and they usually have moat of it available. They have an Indian section, Chinese, Continental, a range of Ice creams and Sundaes and Desserts. They also have combo meals. 
The food presentation is also very tasteful, however the food is not that good. Sometimes they live up to the expectation and plate up delicious food, the next time you order the quality is not the same. The quantity is also inconsistent and most of the times it is less than it should be. Luckily at times I have received good food whether Chinese or Continental, however most of the times I have been disappointed. Their Sundaes are nice and the Ice creams are nicely flavoured and well presented. I have tries their Creamy white sauce pasta which is moderately good. Crispy fried Pepper Mushrooms are sometimes nice and crisp at the other times soft and tasteless. There has also been an incident where my pasta had a baby cockroach in it. When I pointed it out to them they took it away and didn't charge for the dish. They had a Philadelphia Cheesecake on offer which wasn't really a cheesecake. 
Service is a little clumsy and late. Overall I have had mixed experience with Scoop.

We ordered jst one club chicken sandwich and one large lassi... the lassi was so so but the sandwich was a real disaster! First of all...we ordered chicken sandwich and there was no trace of chicken in it...then we r informed that the chicken is mixed with  mayonese,  making scrambled egg (never had such a bad scrambled egg)the major part of the sandwich! Moreover, the bread quality of the sandwich is so poor that it can hurt Ur mouth while eating! I mean... literally! So b careful...!

Visited this place after a really long time and I was happy to see it renovated :) We had ordered Egg Dosa which was very delicious and Idly Vada. The Vada had probably turned sour which was a bit turn off for us and the Pepsi they served was without fizz. Rest the dosa really was delicious. Do try it if you are a egg-lover! ?

One of the famous restaurant in the heart of the city with a password protected wi-fi...
The food is good,though i love the cold coffee they serve in quiet reasonable price..one of the very different food from this joint is,chicken dosa..We r familiar with different types of dosas which belong from the veggies bt n'vg dosa ws really an unique idea..the price are exactly not pocket-friendly bt not that expensive too!!

Recently been there for a quick meal after shopping.. the place is nice with vibrant decors. We ordered chicken prawn fried rice and chicken manchurian.. dishes were very tasty. Though I found the quantity little less.. it was my first visit there nd the first impression scoop left on me is good... I found it to be a nice place for hanging out with friends.. will like to be back here again soon and try those tempting ice cream sundaes.... :-)

The ambiance is good and the prices are not too high either. I would recommend this place to anyone.

Visited the place again. .this time for more than only the Sundaes.
Located in the new market area in a place where most of the food joints are. Its a bright place with the fluorescent colours reigning , find it quite cheerful. This time we went in after a shopping trip . .very hungry. We ordered Jap chicken , a fish+French fries+ Pepsi combo and a sundae -- Pehla Nasha.
The Jap chicken was good . .a little different in taste (in a good way) but was too little in amount or rather size, but loved the sauce.
We had to wait a long time for the fish and chips but if I may say so,it was well worth the wait. In fact it was so good, the thinly crusted but crunchy fish fillets and fries , that we ordered another.
The sundae was as usual a good one with a black forest pastry and scoops of blind love ice cream but the scoops too have shrunk in size. Disappointing !
All in all the food is good but really think that they should improve the service ,try not to make the customers have to remind them again and again of the order. Also the food is a bit overpriced for the amount and the quality.

A nice joint with a quick service....at a great location, the heart of the city. I went with my wife and a friend and we ordered chicken club sandwich, french fries and a regular very cheesy chicken pizza from ¬†the menu...was served in about 6-7 minutes...and almost perfectly made...i wished a little more color and crispness of the breads but taste wise, there is not a bit of disappointment...layered with cheese and fried eggs...mashed chicken and juicy tomatoes and cucumbers...and the portion size was huge...it was a combo snack with french fries and they actually serve french fries comparable with McDonalds...long sleek and crisp cuts of carbohydrates....the only improvement area was the salad that the gave along with it...probably they would call it a coleslaw but i would say its a coleslaw which is 2 days old left outside the freezer...better not to serve that...the cheesy pizza was served over a wooden pizza peel...was nicely baked with right amount of cheese...
overall, i liked the place and would definitely go again if i visit the area and would recommend others...they have a good variety of indian, chinese, south indian and continental menu...the service is prompt....nice music, vibrant colors in the decor and definitely not a dull place...

I have nostalgic memories with this place... I am a regular visitor here since my college days... Hence have gone through the various make overs or the changes that scoop, esplanade, has gone through...once upon a time i had visited this place with my mother...and now that she is no more, i visit this place with family n friends... a lovely warm place to be in..the ambience is very good along with the food quality...earlier it was famous for its desserts ¬†but now it comes with a lot many other options . i am most fond of the continental and the chinese cuisines... Scoop for me is a place of repose...and when people like Jayprakash, Ananta, Suman welcome you it becomes your second home...I am ¬†not exaggerating but earnestly mean it... Jayprakash, Ananta , Suman and the rest have been so warm towards me that they now hold a special place in my heart...Even Miss Tanya, floor manager of scoop, has been very efficient and cordial in carrying out her business... Thank you guys for making me n my family feel so special.

I used to frequent this place when I was dating my husband. We often visited New market area as it is one of our favourite place in Kolkata. I still remember gorging on the icecreams there after catching a show in New empire cinema hall. One of their items I loved was the Grilled fish in lemon butter sauce. It was really good. But on my last visit, I found that the service has gone down and also the quantities also have gone down. Prices are okay but was highly disappointed by our last visit.

Have visited this place quite a lot,because less of family restaurant in New Market area.

Very colorful restaurant - colorful chairs,lights and decor.They serve almost everything, be it south Indian,north Indian,Mughlai,Chinese,Continental and Cold beverages.

But let me tell you,choose the dishes very carefully because most of them taste lack of authenticity.

In my several visits, I have tasted many items.Sometimes¬† Kashmiri Polao,Shahi Korma,sometimes Special Mix Noodles¬† with Chicken side dishes,Sometimes Chicken Sizzler/Chef's Special Veg Sizzler,but most of the times Sundae(Specially Tutti Fruity).

None of them was extra-ordinary in taste,just a typical form of the authentic dishes.

Every items are good in quantity(not in quality).Tutty Fruity is exceptional.

But even after so many negatives, the main plus point is location and item options.

Thus Scoop remain a popular destination in Esplanade area

Amongst all the restruant I have visited yet, this is the one place where I came across all sort of colour known to us used for decor. From outside itself this restro is very eye catchy as you will fell like visiting it at least once. The mix n match of colours inside is being done quite brilliantly, which, I would say, create a perfect environment for a 'Date'. 
As we entered, staff escorted us to the seats and the service they provided was quite good. Talking about food this place serves varieties of food starting from Pizza to Biriyani and it tastes quite good. 
Visited only once n had a great experience with food as well as with the ambiance. Price is also reasonable and I must say its a saviour during the peek shopping hours at esplanede, where u can get good food at a resonable price.

The moment you enter this joint the first thing that strikes your eye is the vibrant sympohony of colors all around. It seems like you have come inside a rainbow surrounded by clouds. The decor of this place is striking and just a eye candy that gives you a soothing sensation. This place is located near the new empire cinema of new market. This was a place which created a food court type environment even before the shopping mall culture came to town. They offer almost everything ranging from salads, pasta, pizzas, chinese dishes, kabab platers, even simple maggi noodles, ice creams, juices, shakes etc. You name it and this scarlet red place has got everything to make your mood. One of the most important point supporting this joint is their reasonable price which could be adjustable to everyone's budget. Hence if you are near by new market area and looking for something rather than typical street foods in a reasonable budget then "scoop" is your destination.

But cant comment about food because we didn't have anything for their as there was a server problem so the Lady over there told us it would take time,they can't make any effort rather than waiting for the connection problem solved from the server itself and as we were in hurry couldn't wait for long... Hope next time when i ll be visiting there they can serve me n change my opinion towards the restaurant... Good Luck ????

This place was our joint during Durga Puja shoppings...i remember all us borthers and sisters used to doll up and after a hectic shopping voyage used to chill over Banan Milk shake and Ice cream sundays...i had my first french fries ¬†there.... Me and my best friend on our first "√ñut of home B'day Party" had the most awsome meal there...and i still remember the cheesy family non veg pizza and milk shakes. Today whenever i come to New Market area Scoop has to be visited and revisited. The staff is cordiall and they go out of the way to make you feel comfortable. I love their Russian salad and they will surely spoil you for options. The burger is too good and the sandwiches are a delight to have. They give fresh lime soda in tall glasses and its a thirst quenching delight.

After a hectic exam me and my pals were dead hungry and decided to give the utmost pleasure to  our stomach at scoop. The interior is large and nicely decorated. We were a pack of 6 people and luckily got one of the tables to sit . After a huge discussion we ordered an  indo ‚Äìchinese mixed menu in the starter section :P It was Fried wantons, chilly garlic basil prawn, Tandoori fish and Tandoori murg followed by diet pepsi . The starters were yummilicious specially the prawns with a zesty touch and the other ones were flavorful too. The Tandoori fish was succulent and immensely spicy. We  literally wanted to lick our fingers but unfortunately we couldn‚Äôt do so. The main course came after a short while & it had Grilled fish, Cantonese noodles (non veg) Flaming chilly prawns, Indonesian shrimp fried rice and spicy chilly chicken. The Cantonese noodles is too healthy with steamed veggies making it very appetizing and even the grilled fish was delectable. I personally found the prawn dishes are above praise worthy, the tastiest prawns I ever had. The fried rice and chilli chicken was also good ,nothing extraordinary but  I found the quantity was little less. The staffs are well behaved and the service too was up to the mark. It is obviously recommendable for  atleast once but  for prawn lovers - twice, thrice or more.

Quite a legendary hotel and more a land-mark in the busy New Market area.
Though it's not been many times I have visited Scoop, but the thing that would keep me dragging towards itself is it's colorful and vibrant decor.
though it lacks in privacy a bit, but the candid interior can compensate that..
The dishes I had/have over there comprises of Dosas, Salads, Burgers and Sandwiches.
Needless to say Scoop will score an outstanding grade for it's deliciously prepared Cheese Dosa, which I never miss whenever I visit this outlet and of course the exotic and mostly important healthy Salads.
The service is prompt and the waiters, though too many in number but friendly and efficient.
However I feel that the chairs and the tables should be more comfortable and cozy and of course a bit more spacious.
Prices are too friendly. 
P.S.- I don't know why I felt that the Scoop Sandwiches are a bit less stuffed and not so soft.

New Market has several good eateries and Scoop is one of them.. During puja shopping time,me and my friend were hungry after shopping so we headed to this place... 
Food-- we ordered Chicken Lolypop and Chicken Biriyani. . We have to wait for 20 minutes.  Food was delicious.  Biriyani was average with two pieces of chicken,1 egg & not too much oily. Lollypop was served with potato chips.  Average type bt nt so good...and the main thing is late service...there is no one to serve water or giving tissue also
Location-- just beside of kfc and Domino's.  It has very colourful decoration. 
As we get place at 1st floor we cant enjoy the decoration of ground floor.  
Overall good place! enjoy foodie.....

Food was okay-ish. But what was best was their free Wifi. The ambience is nice but just too colouful. Sometimes hits you. Nevertheless, a good place to hang out and the thalis here are quite good. Give it a try. :)

I went to this place before also but this time am disappointed. No doubt the decor is good and the place is neat and clean. I had ordered for chicken noodles and chicken manchurian. But the quantity is too less for two people where as in many places it is quite fine. Even am not satisfied with the taste also. May be the other dishes tastes good but i didnot liked it. Even the hospitality is poor.

I had been to this restaurant for quite few times and finally its time to put down the experiences on the paper. Quite a lot of them in fact. Among the numerous visits here is my take on this..

The ambiance, colorful comfortable chairs. Has Wi Fi which is indeed great, don't expect to stream movies or songs on youtube but causual surfing is fine. However not the best of the hygienic places, found some flies buzzing around the table, must be a lucky one to enter I believe.

Coming to the food which is the main aspect, some of the items which I had tried Lassi, nothing great about it. Name any sizzler on the menu and I have had all of them, sad Chicken sizzler is my fav but it is not the best which can tickle your taste buds. Pizza is good. Sandwiches OK types. Noodles are too oily.

Next visit not sure when it will be..

I had been visiting Scoop for the past 14 years [since the year 2000], when I got married. Scoop was basically the epicenter of my courtship with my wife Kavita. Everytime I visit Scoop, I get a nostalgic feeling and recollect sweet memories of the past. Recently, I celebrated my kid, Bitan's 12th birthday here, and OMG !!! What a reception it was !!! Led by Tanaya, the entire team was on their toes in ensuring that all of us, my entire family with my parents, felt as if the celebration was being carried out at home. Being a Citibanker, I know how it feels to seal a smile on the customer's face, so I know that for the entire Scoop team, it is always an achievement to satisfy the customer. Be it the ambiance, the price tag, the quality of food, the staff - you can't help but continue to shower them with praises and accolades. Good show guys !! Keep it up !!!
I have attached a couple of pics - one pertaining to the b'day celebration which I spoke about, and the other is a pic clicked at the same spot 8 years back, with Bitan surprised at the size of the Dosa !!
Thanx for everything.
God bless - Biplab

One must try the Sundae called Sweet Love. It's simply amazing. Apart from this everything remains unchanged, as it has been for the past 17 years that I had been visiting the place. Thanx Tanaya n Team !!

Visited this one on the very first day of Durga Puja, and my experience was just horrible, and I literally mean it. First when we entered the restaurant i really liked the ambiance, it was full of vibrant colours and soothing music, we got a table for three of us. Then the main part starts, first we were sitting just unattended for half an hour, even nobody came with a glass of water. Then after calling thrice one lady came to take the order. After placing the order we were chatting and suddenly the lady who took the order came with some plates and spoon and and literally dumped on our table, we were really shocked with this kind of attitude, though all of us were in festive mood we ignored this. Then one guy came with the order and just left the bowls and left, there was no one to at least arrange the plates, whatever we were hungry at that time so helped each other. The food was ok , but I found the quantity a little less according to the price (You can get sufficient amount for 2 people in any restaurant in China Town at lower price). But there were more surprises waiting for us, we asked for water and the same lady who took our order came and she accidentally overfilled "TWO" glasses ( I don't know how it could be possible ), and didn't even apologized for that. Then we noticed something was floating in one of the glasses, we asked the lady to change the glass and she surprisingly asked us what is the thing floating, we took a close look and found some small onion like thing, then she asked how that thing gone in the glass and by her tone it was clearly reflecting that she was trying to mean that if we are responsible for this or not, then by gods grace she replaced the glass. We quickly finished the food and paid the bill and left the place as soon as possible. Truly speaking this place just spoiled our mood for the whole day, and I would never ever recommend any of my friends.

Today I visited The Scoop for the very first time as I am in¬† Kolkata for official travel.
¬†
Found the restaurant good, serving almost all the cuisines I like. As I am from Delhi, was looking for good north Indian food here. 
¬†
The dal I ordered was awesome (better than any other regular restaurant in Delhi), however the roti's were made of maida (all purpose flour), which are supposed to be made of wheat flour. 
¬†
Ordered a greek salad.. which came after I got my main course.. also.. dint expect cucumber to be a part of greek salad..
¬†
But the service was good and the one thing I liked about the place is that the staff was putting in a lot of efforts to attend the customers at the earliest.. (making eye contact n reading the signs) which was absolutely brilliant..
¬†
a regret that I was so full till I completed my meal that I could not try the as your like it ice cream...sundae..
¬†
But overall.. I would love to visit this place again whenever I come to Kolkata..
¬†
Doing a good job guys.. keep it up.

Scoop at New Market is an awesome place to visit after a hectic day of shopping and chill in the air condition. The interior is huge and pretty well decorated. There are both male and female waiters to take the order and serve you. The place also has wifi connection which is even more better if you want to sit there for a long time and chit chat with friends over a cup of coffee and different variety of food available here. Though it is a spcious restaurant yet you will find it full most of the time given its proximity to new market and shreeram arcade located on the opposite. They serve everything from a thali to continental to south indian ¬†to italian and english. They also have a wide variety of desserts and shakes. Overall its a wonderfull place to chilla and experience good food.

After shopping at New Market, me and my friend headed to this place with great hunger!! I was attracted by the decoration of this restaurant.. When we entered the lady said we have to go to First Floor, I was highly disappointed as the first floor has no decoration but we enjoyed the view of the street from window side chair.¬†

FOOD(4/5)->> We were too much hungry so we asked the waiter what will be fast and he said chicken Lolypop. So we ordered Chicken Lolypop and two plates of Chicken Biriyani. Lolypop was served after 10 minute and there was lots of potato chips with chicken lolypops. Lolypop was average. then after 15 minute Biriyani came. I liked the biriyani very much. Two pieces of chicken and plenty amount of Rice was quite enough for a person. Taste was so good. They provided varieties of sauces with your food.

Location & Hospitality->> This restaurant is just beside line of KFC ¬†or Baristaa. Staffs were humble and the place was quite clean. Only thing I didnt like was the waiting time for Food and we have to ask for the water each time.¬†

Lastly, good place, go and try atleast once.

AVOID THIS RESTUARANT, WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE OF KOLKATA.Last week we visited Scoop and ordered Chicken Sizzler and Fries. It was taking more than 30 minutes for them to prepare. In between I thought of using the wash room and asked one waiter as I couldn't see any sign. The waiter was giving me direction to go to upstairs and in between suddenly another waiter mocked to go out of the restaurant and do it on the road. Extremely unprofessional. The food which was served was also not that good. The fries were of black rotten potatoes. So Avoid this restaurant.

I have been wanting to visiting Scoop for quite some time after watching its colorful interiors from KFC. Visited the place last Friday with mum and sister after shopping. We entered the place at around 3 and there were a few empty seats on the ground floor. While we were about to sit, a lady directed us upstairs. We had no idea what a mistake we are making by going upstairs.

We were directed to sit on a table right infront of the door. The AC was either too low or absent upstairs. Not nice. The waitress arrived to take our orders. She had that constant eyebrow lifted expression with so much attitude that it would instantly irritate you. We ordered Chole Bhature and Capsicum Utthapam. She asked if we wanted mineral water with the same rude tone. When I said she could serve serve plain water, man! you should seen the reaction when she just said 'we dont serve plain water'. Well, the restaurant rules can differ and it is alright but atleast be polite. What the hell! So the Queen waitress marched off telling us it would take a minimum of 30 minutes :/

The food arrived at around 3:40. Three friends left from a table beside us after the snooty behavior of the same queen waitress. The chole bhature was good to my relief! My sister was quite pleased with her food till she found a small stone in her food (picture follows). I was not surprised by now. My Capsicum Utthapam was nothing great. It was not bad either.¬†

The worst part was there was a room (store room) right in front. They brought in the food from downstairs and kept it inside that room before serving it to everyone for some reasons. So what is so bad about it? Well, the room had a broomstick and a corner all red with paan stains (picture follows). This room was right opposite to my chair and after one view of it, I could not gulp down my food. I mean how can you keep the food which has paan saliva? Where is the hygiene factor? Yuck!

We also had to ask for tissue papers as they were not provided otherwise. There was a sweet guy who served us food. Finally a relief from the other rude waitress. However, I would never recommend this place to anyone. There are just colorful interiors, just on the ground floor and that is all that I liked here.

So, quite a disappointment we had. And I am never going back again. Period.

We ordered a creamy cheese penne pasta . It tasted really good . Then we had sheekh kebab and fruit and nut icecream. It is one of the best place to have ice cream . This place has a quirky item on their menu - biryani with chilly chicken , hope to try with out on my next visit.

Was in this area after ages...thanks to a bunch of friends who decided to go shopping on Saturday evening. The area was teeming with people as expected and the weather was sultry to say the least. We choose Scoop for some air-conditioning comfort. On entering we were told to wait for 5 minutes near a gate. The lady was sweet and a glance revealed the place was filled with hungry shoppers...some with family and some with their partners!

Got a table by the promised time for the five of us. We wanted to order momo and some chinese snacks (and it was evening time) but the waiter politely told us that Chinese and Indian dishes would take around half an hour to arrive and continental  or south indian was the only option because of the rush. We took his word and ordered a large "Yum Yum Yummy" pizza and "As you like it" Ice cream. The pizza arrived in 15 minutes and was not served on a regular tray but 3 side dishes with three slices each instead. The pizza was not so yummy as it sounded even after we put lots of oregano and chili flakes! The chicken toppings were small and I could not find much vegetables either. As requested, the ice cream was served right after we polished off the pizza. It did live up to scoop's reputation, served in a huge bowl with different flavors like butterscotch, vanilla and chocolate complete with nuts and fruits. It did make up for the pizza disappointment.

A note on the interiors. I noticed the false ceiling in certain parts of the restaurant in a pretty bad shape although the place looks bright with a lot of colours and plastic furniture which gives the place a young feel. The air conditioning was terrible considering the fact that it was full and the weather was extremely sultry outside. And finally, while leaving we saw puke lying on the floor which was unattended to (it seemed for sometime). Yuk!

Yesterday I went to scoop with my friend, after 20min of waiting they came to our table to say "we will be with you shortly". (Then we have to ask for water several times to get that. Their table cleanliness is not up to the mark, service is awful) After waiting a long time we ordered chicken ala king and they serve our food after another 30 min of waiting. The food wasn't good. All over the experience @ scoop is not at all satisfactory. I'm going to scoop for a long time but after tomorrow's experience I'm not gonna advise to any one for scoop (at least until if have other choice).

What do I say about this place... Its one place I always try to go whenever I visit kolkata. Located in esplanade, near the new market area surrounded by many fast food joints and restaurants. But this place stands apart in the crowd. Well atleast when one enters the restaurant. Has a very nice ambience,neat funky decor. And a courteous staff. I have been told that they even given discounts to all-women customers. The place is spacious and houses a modest crowd at any given time. They recommend us to book in advance. Now to the food. Well they have a good variety of cuisines which include indian, Chinese and other oriental dishes. They keep changing their menus from time to time and they also keep special menus for special occasions. I like their smoothies, and among the main course the reshmi chicken, the tandoori variety and pulaos are my favourites. I would recommend anyone living in Kolkata or anyone nearby to try out this place at least once.

The concept of scoop is really modern yet it doesn't come across as a clich√©. The food is undeniably scrumptious and the menu is really pocket friendly. Although I wish it had a bar it doesn't steal  credits from the place of being a really nice hangout place. I hope to visit Kolkata and Scoop soon again. Cheers to the management for putting up a really decent job.

It was a weekday and there was a  reunion of college friends at new market.  The weather was quite hot so we decided to settle down at scoops without wasting much time in travelling. The interiors and ambiance was done up well but could have been slightly better. Our order consisted of

Fresh lime soda
Veg hot n sour soup
Fish finger
French fries
Simply veggi pizza
Crispy chilli babycorn
medu vada

All the items did not taste good. Only the pizza stood out which was crisp , thin and cooked well. They should consider improving their chinese section as it really lags behind. Service was also not prompt. Overall a below average place.

Location: New Market

Gone are those days when one used to go on a shopping round at new market and made it a point to drop by at Scoop for a quick bite or a full-fledged meal. 
Scoop is located right beside the New Empire which was quite famous in the good old days for the screening of English movies that were released here. 
The ambiance out here is quite colourful and as you enter it would simply cheer up up. 
But, sadly this happiness is quite short lived and is taken over by a grumpy face as soon as you seat yourself. Yes, uncomfortable seats.

This place has anyway taken it's shortcut to oblivion with the help of the rude servers, near to average food across all cuisines they have on offer and last but not the least the stench that overshadows the room fresheners they spray! 

This place used to be one of my favorites in those early days but, a recent visit with the most disgusting experience rendered this place to be a strict no-no for me. 

What made the experience bad? 
-A smelly place altogether. 
-Drinking water not being served even after reminders.
-Food portions do not justify the prices. 
-Bill given along with the meal. :\ 
-Rude Staff and too busy doing nothing.
-Instead of accepting that the food wasn't upto the mark, silly excuses are given, out which the excuse that tops the list is "This dish is made like this". I mean, c'mon, we customers aren't fools. 

Good experiences turned bad! :\

One star from me.
+0.5 for all the old times this place made me come back for more.

Then she ordered Chicken Steak and I ordered Chicken Sizzler.. Both the chicken steak and the sizzler was really good.. Though I would say Mocambo Sizzler is much better.. But the price of this sizzler was quite less.. The ambience is quite good and price was also okay...

The colourful modern decor cafe " Scoop "
What to write about scoop,this cafe is around from my school days. Once it was the only known places to hang around with friends.. Located in the new empire building near New market.
The cafe looks very cute.. With a cheerful decoration its a instant mood lifter.
But things have changed now..as u step inside there's a awful smell which is a total turn off. 
The food is average.. I have tried scoop's silzzers,crispy chicken, hakka noodles nothing special..pretty much okay. 
Price is reasonable. 
My favourite was there sundaes with five scoop of icecream...I'm having it from my school days that's the only reason I'll go back there. 
I won't recommend any of there food but to try their sundaes.

Good place to eat after spending an entire afternoon shopping.  One of the very few places where good food is available along with good ambience.  Prices reasonable & standard. You need to try out various ice cream combinations.

A good place to hang out with your friends on a weekend with some of the very good food at offer. Their must try are grilled fish with lemon butter sauce, hawain salad and not to forget their sundaes.  They serve pretty good mocktails as well! Price is quite reasonable and their revamped interior is also quite well. However, a bit noisy place...so maynot be an ideal place if you are looking for a quiet meal. Perfect place to catch some quick snacks whike you are shopping there at new market!!

I have been here quite a few times since my childhood but never retained any information so write a review on it. Finally I went here today after a long time and I was surprised by the way this place has changed. They seem to have revamped the place with a lot of neon lighting and funky decor. They also have free wifi now. The first thing that took me by surprise was the very loud music. Loud enough to irritate you a bit. We were then seater soon and we ordered for a 'Paradise Found' Ice cream and another tutti fruiti along with a Pepsi, a plate of chicken steamed momos and a chilly chicken dry. I disliked their service especially because we werent served water for about 20mins since our arrival. We had asked for it 4 times but in vain. It finally arrived at our table along with the ice creams. The tutti fruiti was great and so was the paradise found, scoop has been popular of its ice cream anyway. Then we got served our main snacks, the momos were good but the chilly chicken was mediocre, could have been better and again we were served the Pepsi when we were almost through our snacks. The total came upto 754, I still dont understand why a glass of pepsi which is Rs.10 (the glass bottle) costs Rs.55 not just here but mostly everywhere. Anyway so the service is quite poor as you can read. Orelse the place is good for a friendly hangout and some munchies in between shopping sprees. Though there are many options to eat oit here but this one is worth a shot. Happy eating.

Full of decorations and full of show-off! But lacks in the main business like hell! Food is rubbish!!
Ordered Mixed Fried Rice but it was so dull..and to add to the misery the prawns were also stale!
Tried to complain..but they said that the prawn is less fried thats why..as if we have never had prawn before.
They offered a complimentary ice-cream which we rejected.. Great prices but worst food!

Visited this place during my last visit to Kolkata with some friends.
The ambiance of the place is nice and so with the presentation of the food. But the taste does not do justice to the ambiance and their presentation. Most of the dishes are kind of tasteless and do not excite the taste buds
Ambiance 4.0
Presentation 4.0
Food 2.5
Service 3.5
pocket friendly - Not really according to the food they give. So a 2.0
And hence a 3.2/5 will do justice.
Not really recommended and there are other better options available around this place at lower rates.

This is the most pathetic restaurant I have been to in recent times. Service is worst, as food is also very cheap and oily sans taste. Its really unfortunate to have such a sub standard restaurant in such a location. I have visited Scoop in Salt Lake location, but that branch is not so worst. Management of this food joint should look after the service, specially the female employees and also the food quality.

Ambience and food go hand in hand when reviewing a restaurant. The place is well decorated with pleasant lighting. The seats were just average and the room freshner made me SNEEZE.... :) Food was good. Their sundaes are very eye appealing and delicious. An upselling point for Scoop is their "Go As You Like" sundae, where you can choose your flavours and toppings. Lovely experience at a reasonable rate.

This is a place for those who judge the book by the cover. The only way I am giving this place a 1.5 is because of its vibrant deco, else it deserves a shit. My message to the owner, shoppers in a market area comes to eat in a restro, don expect everybody to be lost in their partners' eyes. If you cant provide good food, then you get such remarks.

scoop from outside it looks like a posh restaurant..... getting inside the ambience was awesome.. i thought i would be a lovely time with my mother.. but when we sat in the place there was a sudden rush of bad odour.. next was the menu god such high price rate!!! but thought the food may be up to mark.. so we ordered a cheese sandwich, pasta, n crispy chilli baby corn... first came chilli baby corn first it was good but as we went through the dish the babycorns seemed to be stale... then came the sandwich it was just two slice of bread with cheese in between.. i thought what is this and it cost 95 rupees without vat ... then came pasta it was the worst pasta i ever had... i think the chef forgot that cheese contains salt so extra salt may not be added.. it was the worst.. i was disappointed with the  food and the price.. this price does not suite the food they serve

The decor is very nice. It's done in neon basically. 
The prices are equivalent to the price of the food served there. Not so great but subtle for a hangout with friends. 
Service is a bit slow and some waitresses are negligent. I went there with my mom and sister. Our bill was around 1035 INR. 
The dark temptation is a MUST try though. 
BON APPETIT! =)

I regularly visit this establishment, whenever I go to watch a movie or for any reason I am there. I like best their Mixed Platter Sizzler, which is awsome.

One thing which I would like to mention and I found a bit odd was that the waitresses should get a bit more professional dress.

The ambience is pretty great, with a lot of open space, colourful lighting and decent sitting arrangements. 
I had ordered cold coffee frappe, a chicken thali, and chicken burger with fries.
The cold coffee was amazing, the chicken thali was enough to calm down the grumbling of an empty stomach. The chicken was good, with tok doi and average peas polao. The burger, or a double sandwich, to be more precise, was delicious, and the fries had very little oil. 
The service was also very good.
I didn't have a lot of items, but all in all, a great experience.

I tried :
Biryani

fried rice
pasta

This is the first place where fried and crushed onions are used in garnishing biryani although i didn't find the same in my last visit. I also noticed it is not fresh at all.

I visit scoop frequently. But this time I was highly disappointed. We ordered masala kulcha one paneer dish, chicken steak & sweet lime sodas. Though chicken was cooked well & falling apart, but the paneer dish was a set back. They weren't fresh & kulchas were chewy.
On the whole it wasn't quite nice this time. But service was efficient.

Came to know of this place last yr...for last one yr, I wud hv visited this place more than 50 times for the 'chicken sizzler' only. Suddenly on 3rd July 2014, when I had ordered my fav sizzler, I was taken by shock as other than a small chicken piece and an omlet...I cud not see the previously used items. There were no french fries, no baked vegetables. When I asked the floor manager, she retorted that we had ordered some 'sizzling' which is different from a 'sizzler'. On asking the waiter, he said that the platter has changed. I requested for a proper sizzler. I was made to wait for 30 odd minutes when all the waiters had a small meeting and no one bothered to serve our desk. And then had to call a waiter for the bill for the remaining food. Such a bad experience for a regular customer ! Disgusting ! They change platter randomly, but their floor manager is not aware off ! And they expect me to believe that lie ! I rarely comment/rate in Zomato but this one was needed. Customer service sucks in Scoop ! And they give u some random dish and they tell lies about a platter-change. If the platter has changed, why is the customer not informed before the service ? Disgusting ! Wasted my one hour for naut ! I wud hv rated this place negative...had there been an option to...(Mind u..my previous rating was 5 when I had first visited this place). I have seen this place deteriorate over a year ! Time to search for a better sizzler in Kolkata ! I m done with Scoop !

'Scoop' is the very popular restaurant at New Market area.It is located behind the New Empire Cinema Hall.I went there few years back with my friends.First af all the ambiance of this restaurant is very colorful & too big..It‚Äôs very noisy too! The only thing worth your attention is the spunky interiors! Many seating arrangements are here.There are many waiters,they've also waitress.The quality of the food is good not excellent.We tasted here Paper Masala Dosa,The taste of Dosa is good.Their Ice-Creams are famous.It‚Äôs very noisy too! The only thing worth your attention is the spunky interiors!Service is quick.Price is also reasonable.

So after a long time I was back to Kolkata. And neither for the fish nor the chicken's leg, but for something green ,something veggie. After loving all the Chinese food around , I settled for lunch at Scoop. Straight away I ordered crispy chilli babycorn , my favorite, and also because I wanted to compare it with one of the better ones I had at another restaurant. Had I gone by the reviews here, I would have definitely ordered the usual good ones here, but I settled for a different menu. I ordered Cheese masala Dosa and Onion uttapam as the main course dishes. I was not alone, have a tiny tummy.
Chilly babycorn- Disaster No.1 , It wasn't even properly cooked!!! Some were tender , some hard, some were fresh, some tasted stale, and to add to the woes, the quantity was an awful lot. Not that I would have complained had it been good.
Onion uttapam- Someone forgot to add the salt maybe. Now that's the most embarassing review for a chef ,I guess.Second disaster
Cheese Masala Dosa- Just putting cheese ,masala inside the dosa: that's how they define it here. I have never tried this item. i don't know if the cheese is supposed to stay and taste alongwith the masala or just like the lumps of masala and cheese as it tasted. but whatever it was, this takes the count to disaster no. 3.
Net result: The hangover of my comfort food -Schewan momo I had before this was lost , and huh, I had to write this review

Located near the bustling and jostling New Market area Scoop is a pet favourite among the shoppers, window shoppers as well as college students. I will attribute the reason to the variation of cuisine that the place has to its customers. Chinese, Continental and North Indian are some of the fundamental cuisines that go down well with the gourmet as well as the not-so foodie. The combo meals are a great option if one is looking for cost-cutting yet enjoying a meal. But the quality of the food didn‚Äôt go down with me well. The quality of food and the pricing is just done. The only thing you can savour to your delight is the sundaes. If you are tired after a strenuous shopping spree and have a hearty good quality meal in a serene ambience, then it‚Äôs better to safely avoid Scoop. It‚Äôs very noisy too! The only thing worth your attention is the spunky interiors!

Just back home fresh from my first visit at Scoop. The location is fantastic... very easy to find. What hooked my attention when I entered the place was the decor. Simple yet elegant; especially the smart way lighting has been used over here. It gives you a very 'posh' feel.

Ice creams are famous over here... so I stuck to the basics. Ordered a Moon Rocker Sundae (I LOVE butterscotch) and a Cran Cooler Pink Me Chiller. They tasted pretty satisfying, but were quite pricey too.

Final Verdict: The rest of the menu looked tempting & I'm sure you'll find it hard to resist yourself from ordering other items once you're here. So my advice for you is to carry some extra bucks. It definitely looked like one of those places which will turn out to be your favorite hangout zones.

Located in the same building as the more popular Kfc,Barista,Dominos the thing about this particular place that will draw your attention and make you want to give this place a try is its colourful and funky decor.At least it was so in my case.
I visited this place for the first time about 4-5 yrs ago.Back then I used to love their ice creams and sundaes.They were excellent and very decently priced too.The main course items were not as good but decent nonetheless.The menu was also quite varied.
After quite a long time,I visited this place again yesterday thanks to the heavy rain.I was surprised to see that the menu had become even more extensive.It contained alomost everything ranging from North Indian to South Indian to Chinese to Pizzas to Burgers to even Continental items.Since we were not too hungry and it was just the two of us,we ordered a Chicken ala king and  a chocolate shake.The chocolate shake was quite nice.But the chicken ala king was quite a disappointment.It took quite a long time to arrive and when it finally did arrive we were amazed at the quantity.It was pitifully small.The taste was also not the greatest.And to make matters worse,the price was quite high.In fact the prices have had a significant hike and it is higher than the menu on zomato.Unfortunately,I felt that while the prices have gone one way,the quality of the food has gone the other way.
Coming to the ambience,as I mentioned already,it has a uniquely colourful and funky decor.It is may be a bit too colourful.It is the first thing you would notice about the place.They provide seating in chairs which are colourful but not too comfortable.The place is always crowded and there is always a busy feel about the place which for me makes it quite unsuitable for fine dining or a date.Its quite okay though if you visit in a group.The staff are friendly but the service is on the slower side except the desserts and sundaes.
Overall I feel this is a place which has a lot of potential.But at present,if at all I were to make a recommendation about this place I would suggest the sundaes and desserts only.

Ambiance - The lighting is a little too flashy for my taste. Also the staff chatter a lot trying to manage people. One has to wait for a few minutes before getting a seat because the place is almost usually full. The seating is okayish with plastic chairs to sit which are a little uncomfortable.
Food - The food is reasonably priced. A long list of preparations were available in the menu. Ordered a pizza which tasted good and was filling. Will have to visit again to try out more from their menu.

Scoop is located in building that also hosts the new empire amidst that busy new market area. It used to be on the agenda when there weren't many multiplexes and new empire used to showcase the few english movies that would realease here and there weren't any kfc or a dominos nearby. Its got a colorful decor but very okayish. The seats are not so comfortable for me atleast. The staff service is not so great either.

The menu is elaborate and one could get almost anything like north indian, chinese, italian, burgers, sizzlers, ice creams................But i would stick to their ice creams and sundaes alone 2 years back but now even for the ice creams i would go for a cream and fudge counter located just in front of scoop.

The prices are not so reasonable compared to the park street restaurants. The quality of food is very ok for such prices. I find the chinese food pretty average, sizzlers below average. indian food is ok though. The burger is the fat old indianised one which is ok but nothing as compared to one served at cafe corner at similar price. Ice cream sundaes make up for the damage done but not so much to warrant another visit.

This is our best college days hit out. As our college is situated near the new market area we went there often and still now we go there if we go to the new market area. 

Nice decent colorful decor  and very noisy, though it was not an issue ever as we went there as a group. this place offers you with multi cuisine delicacies and very quality sundaes.  very reasonable for a college students. I never suggest any one to search for a privacy outing there. go there if u r in a casual , and party mood. 

waiters are very decent and helpful . service is quick  and one little  secret- they most of the time gives you a bill which is always the amount you estimated in your mind. 

Overall this place is a nice place to hang out with friends. 
I rate this place 3.5 out of 5.

Scoop is the cutest and coziest place I have ever visited to. The food is up to the mark with very helpful staff. They have good variety of food and deserts starting from chinese, Mughlai, continental and Indian. The ambience is cool with some nice glass designs and funky interiors which is attracting.  Mostly you will find this place to packed up and you will hardly find place becuse of its fine location. I have visited this place N number of times and have tried all cusines but there chinese and Indian is the best and the famous ice creams are always awesome. You wil never have to think about the prices because its very low. Love to visit this place again and again.

I visited Scoop when i went for shopping in new market with friends.We all loved its ambiance.The best part of this place is one does not have to wait for long to get a seat while it takes long time to get a seat in dominoes or KFC .We had ordered club chicken sandwiches , fish fries and soft drinks.The sandwiches were yummy and the fry was average.The staffs are little slow in serving food but that was good for us as we had ample time to chat.The cost was also not very high.Next time , ill try their ice cream.

Scoop....a blistering experience altogether...in the midst of some true cherished moments of desire.It was an afternoon when we visited the place for a quick fill...ordered for a basket of chicken nuggets and mixed chowmein...of course, requesting many time to busy-for-nothing waiters and attendants...the nuggets came with good looking serving and munchy chips thrown into it...but, to my utter surprise..the nuggets were not fresh, not even sauted well before frying...on immediate disposal of this fact, the people of 'Scoop' tried to tell that I never ever tasted nuggets and nuggets do taste like this...although the chowmein was good...the ambiance was delighting with so much colour and lights...but too much noisy like any disco...if at all their behaviour could have been courteous...I would have thought of returning back to the place...

once you are in the humayun place admist the foodstalls,kfc,barista,dominos,the colourful decor from outside is too eye catcatching to draw one here for a try.but once you get seated,the ambience looses much of its charm.they seating is not very comfortable on the plastic seats and sofas like the one we get in kfc which is next to it and is almost always over crowded like a fish market.next coming to the food which is price moderately,they serve multicuisine including indian,chinese,continental,south indian and deserts with nice combo offers.i tasted chicken pizza which was nice.my father is fond of their haka noodles.chinese side dishes ar well made.mostly pastas and lasagna in the menu are unavailable.my friends like the sundae As you like it,which can be shared by 2-3 people and you get 5 scoops of flavours of ur choice with fruits,nuts and choclate sauce.chocolate lovers,do try out their dark temptation ;-)

My experience is not good at scoop. I heard a lot about it from some people. There was no ambiance. It seems same as a small resturant in locals. The waiters were not that great. There behaviour depends on the order. Glasses were not clean and so are the plates. 
Food was not that great and rather I will mark it as below average.

Went here years back and was a regular. Loved their ice creams and I remember having a five scoop ice cream which used to be great. The place did not have an awesome ambience to be honest but then we are talking about atleast 10 years back. To be honest, I have tried most of the ice creams available and they are all very good. The prices are decent too. Looks like now they've refurbished the place. The menu looks as good and ever and I would love to be back soon.

Scoop in New Empire, Kolkata delivers a fantastic ambiance with a beautiful decor. Food is absolutely palatable. Food and Beverage service was very fluent and smooth especially the young lady named Seema Singh  came out very smart and intelligent with a sound knowledge about what she is serving to her guest.

Best of luck & would like to visit again to give pleasure to my palate. 


Thanking you,

Samrat Gupta

Known to have a wide range of ice-cream, I was quite eager to try it out first hand, but was in for a major disappointment. I have would not be able to comment much about the food there as I wasn't there for long - especially due to the unprofessional behavior of the staff out there. The behavior of the staff depends on how much you have ordered, and since we were just to have ice-creams, we did not get to see the better side of it. They were in a tearing hurry to get us out of there - at one point of time, things went out of hand, and when we threatened to leave, they were absolutely cool with it. The manager did not even show up when we asked to see him/her. Definitely not recommended!

I visit this place frequently with friends. Factors that attract us are:

1) Low price
2) Good Taste (We love the crunchy shakes in summer and kebabs are just awesome)
3) The colourful, but not too bright atmosphere, is a turn on. (Makes us feel younger and nostalgic)
4) Staff is good - quite attentive
5) Not so posh. So you can eat and chat with your companion (s) in your own way
6) Perfect location
7) The seating arrangements are fine

Scoop is the perfect choice for anyone who goes to Esplanade area frequently and fancies an affordable tasty meal if he or she feels ravenous about it.

I don't recommend chicken nuggets. Try the light, soft and palatable kebabs there (my personal favourite). You may try the cold nourishments available there too, especially, in summer.

Visited Scoop's on Paila Baishaik(bengali new yr),15th april.enjoyed the cheese dosa and pulao with mutton rogangosh.Their tutti frutti icecream was worth it.But to add to all this was the service of a waiter(JOYPROKASH NARU) who was very obliging and sweet and touched us.A good evening we had .

I had been to Scoop so many times and its service has gone bad to worse...There is one offer which has been going on for a month called pay once eat twice..where u need to show a previous bill to avail the offer for free...well when u go there to eat twice or thrice the waiters and waitress behave  callously as if u r under their charity...even they question u regarding the bills(can it get more worse ).. ' what we had last day ???'...or 'we r d ones who had food last day or not ??? '...suspecting us to be god knows what  !!!..been there on 21st of April I had been a victim of their  insulting behaviour...agitated with their behaviour I have decided that I would never visit this restaurant again in future...disappointed.!!!

After a heavy lunch, we friends wanted to have good ice cream sundaes, so we decided to go to Scoop, situated in the New Market area.This place gave child hood memories. We ordered 4 sundaes, they were all good. The best being the As you like it, which was huge with 5 scoops of different flavoured ice creams and toppings and the Dark Temptation, for all chocolate lovers, a must try. The service was quick and the captain took good care of all of us. 
However, the ambience was too colourful, a little less colours would have made the place look way better.

I had been visiting Scoop since i was in my school and lots have changed over the years. I use to be a regular visitor until last year and would take lunch and diner say five to six time a month but i would regret going in there again. First of all the interior looks like some of the cheap railway station eateries now and the place it too noisy as if seating in a over crowded train. Food was good some time back but now the quality has gone and some time we were served dishes with stale meat which the staff call it too much garnishing or like that...... and i once fell ill due to this. A couple of year back they really had nice stuffs and hospitality but now they have recruited some worthless female stuff who approach you once you step in as if you got into some five star hotel and are at the receiving end of you. The music is too loud and have no environment of privacy and talk. Other than ice cream and snacks you have got nothing to hover around. 
I would never suggest this place to anyone who really wants to enjoy their food as well as the company of their loved ones with good environment as this place has lost its worth over the last year and on.
I feel sad and really miss those good old days of my time with my friends and loved ones enjoying at Scoop.
Stuff and hospitality needs great attention and also the environment.

I went there the other day for Nostalgia's sake and was thoroughly disappointed. The entire place stank of fish... more specifically, fried fish which had gone slightly stale before frying and hence smelled when it was being fried. We sat down and after 10 minutes one female waitress came in and took our order with all the snootiness of the Queen of Sheba. Needless to say, we were not impressed. We ordered a pasta and a fried chicken dish because we were hungry, and the girl told us repeatedly about some stuff or the other, which were more expensive. When we told her firmly we wanted this order, she was quite rude and flounced off. 

After 10 minutes, she got our food in, and my friend was dismayed to see the measly five small pieces of chicken in the plate with 2 cucumber and 1 slice of carrot. For 150/- or so, she did not expect this. On the other hand, the pasta was decently proportioned. 

The bad part came after this - halfway down our meal, the waitress actually put down the bill in front of us. This was clearly bad manners, and we could see that the restaurant still had at least 4 empty tables, and there was no reason for her to be rude. Annoyed, we paid, and marched away. Sorry but I am not coming back here.

The decor is trendy,the waiters polite,the food is good but not excellent. The hot chocolate there tasted like bournvita to me,but the chicken lasagne was delicious! The service isnt too quick,and while other some restaurants hand over the bill while you're eating,here it took them a full 10 minutes to give the bill. I've been eating here since a child,and though the new decor is okay,but the chairs aren't comfortable and I prefer the marble seats they had before!

What can you say about Scoop? The place has been around for ages... It was the "go-to" place for amazing Sundaes... the perfect place to take your kids out for a treat after catching a movie or shopping at New Market... The "As you like it" with 5 scoops of ice-cream of your choice is a definite favourite!

The snacks on offer are quite nice, especially the cheese burgers and chicken gold coin.  My only advice to the owners would be to do something about the interiors... It used to look very classy. Now the less said about the decor, the better. However, for me, it will always be the sundaes that I would go back for.. Granted, the portions have reduced over the years, but they have kept the pricing reasonable.

You go to new market for shopping and you feel like dropping into some place to eat, the place should definitely be scoop. The have a wide variety of items on the menu card- soup for the winters, ice-creams and cold drinks for the summers. They have things for proper lunch, dinner and very cheap too. Drop in at any time you wan and you will definitely get the best to munch on.
One of my friends had told me about scoop and that's why I dropped in. The interiors are too lively, the staff is quite responsive and best of all the food tastes amazing. We had ordered a Veg Club sandwich+coke+french fries combo. The sandwich had the best herbs in it and the perfect mix of all spices. It seemed as if it was tailored for my taste buds. It was the best I ever had.The french fries were amazing- perfect colour, perfect aroma and the perfect crispness. It was quite a cheap deal and we had made the most out of it.
We ended out dine out with deserts- " As you like it". The most expensive on the chart but the best.I would love coming to this place again an again.

New Empire's been around a long time, but Scoop packs quite a punch. The place is very noticeable from the outside, because of it's bright, cheery exteriors and seems to magnetically attract weary shoppers from New Market. 

The ambience is bustling, and fast. With quite a load of tables, this is the quintessential quick fast food joint. The menu has something to fit everyone - whether you're looking for a Continental bite, a long-drawn Indian meal or just a sundae - this place has all of it. The sundaes are extremely good, as are the dosas. Good food at pretty good rates, perfect to refresh oneself after a long hard day. 

The service is also pretty fast, looking at the number of patrons it gets everyday. The final verdict - a great joint to rev up the appetite, if you're tired and in the area.

I used to visit this place quite often with my friends during my school and college days. I still remember the days when New Empire and The Globe used to be the paradise for English movie buffs. The multiplex culture was not significant back then. I would be wrong if I say this place is a delight for culinary senses. This is a pretty ordinary restaurant with average food. It is an ideal place for the students to save the pocket money. The place is very noisy as well. However, unlike few other restaurants in the New Market area, it is comparatively more hygienic. You may want to try out their desserts and mocktails. You won't be disappointed. However, I would not prefer this place for a lunch or dinner if I am in Kolkata for few days. I'd be heading towards Park Street instead !! :)

This place is nothing compared to what it looks from outside. Too colorful, looks like the theme was in place, but while painting they got it all wrong! :P Food is just average, nothing to die for. We ordered one Pene Alfredo and one mixed platter sizzler. Pene alfredo was good, but a tad too cheesy.. Sizzler was just 'bout okay, surely had far better sizzlers elsewhere. Overall, maybe worth a one time visit, solely for the reason that it wont burn a hole in your pocket.

I dont know who worked so hard to spoil the interiors of scoop. However, recently  some renovation work was done, so it has become tolerable. 
Coming to the food, i liked the paper masala dosa. Its long like a tunnel, and quite unique, Also the crispy baby corn was fine. Overall a decent place to be.

This outlet of scoop may look classy from outside but when you step in you will find it tacky & noisy.
The foods are cheap,they may serve each and every cuisine but the only good thing is ice-cream,nothing else.

the waiters are very average sometimes below average.I have visited this place 3 times and the last time I ordered a chicken hawaiwan salad,while having i was feeling something bad about it either the smell or the too much cheese in it.and the next day I started having stomach infection and food poisoning.and i really repent that i ordered some food,i should have ordered ice cream.

The place is cheap,but the utensils are not very clean.not for family dinner.

It was my first Anniversary. We had a aheavy lunch late afternoon, and was thinking of going sumwhere, Like an Ice cream parlour, For some sundaes... Thought of having Tooti Fruti, & Some shakes & taking chicken steak as a parcel for dinner. The first thing that came in my mind was "The Scoop", because I heard before that they offer Nice Icecreams. Went there but When we placed the order, the first thing we heard was a "SERVICE NO". The waiter immediately said, sorry mam we donot have icecreams today as the ice cream machine is not operating". Then we thought for a while& decided to have a strawberry shake. The second answer was "Mam we dont have Strwaberry Shake available today". Third, Chicken Steak for parcel. The answer was " Mam we dodnot offer parcel". The only thing that came in our mind was,it would be the last ever restaurant that I will be coming back again.The most worst Service ever received. Infact no service at all.

If you are not sure about your cravings, come to Scoop. This place offers you all the cuisines you are aware of. The best part is you won't feel robbed after venturing in the unknown food zone. Surprisingly the south Indian dishes are good here. Also the continental stuffs are also nice. But save the best for the end. The desserts will simply sweep you off your feet. The sundaes, the fruit mixes and the ice creams are just divine. The place is quite colorful and you'll mostly find it crowded. But once you are here, your tastes buds will surely thank you for coming here and allowing the ice creams to melt in your mouth.

Firstly I want to say a few words about its Ambiance. Ambiance is nice. Decoration is very very colorful. Very very attractive.
U can find almost everything here e.g. Chinese, Continental, Indian and desserts.
South Indian food is very good, specially Dosas.
Chinese dishes is okay. But north Indian dishes are best! Chicken preparations are also very tasty. Chilli Chicken is awesome. Tandoori Chicken is nice. Desserts are also very good and yummy. Cold Coffee and Lemon Cold Coffee are nice.
Staffs are okay but the negative part is the service. Service is very slow. We have to wait almost 30mins for delivery. 
Price is reasonable and pocket friendly.
Worth a visit.
