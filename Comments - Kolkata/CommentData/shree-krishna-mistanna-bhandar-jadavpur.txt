This place is very close to the 8b bus stand ,beside Bawarchi. Have been here a lot many times. I have tried the radhaballavi alur dum which is quite filling and quite cheap. It costs ₹14 for 2pcs.
I have also tried many sweets and snacks. They are okay as well. The laddoo @ ₹6 tastes nice. The outer covering is a bit hard but inside it's soft. The samosa tastes good. Here the amriti is too crispy and tastes quite well,priced at ₹10. The jalebis are fine too but most of the times aren't available. I didn't like the gulab jamun and dhokla here though. Their dhokla @ ₹7 is very hard and tastes very average.

Visited this place number of times as it is one of the nearby sweet shops from our university. Tried different types of sweets, sandesh, singara and other snacks. All of them are good. I tried their radhaballavi for breakfast and liked that too. So, it is a good one for sweets in the locality.

যথার্থ পুরাতনী বোধ হয় একেই বলে । খাবারের প্রতিটি কণা মমতা দিয়ে তৈরি । এখানে সিঙ্গারা খেয়ে দেখুন , আর অমৃতি । পুরো অমৃত মধুর লাগবে । মিষ্টি দইও খুব ভালো ।

Amazing in terms of their Radha-Ballavi; one of my favorite choice when it comes to Sunday Breakfast. The Amriti is also yummy. They are one of the few sweet shops in Kolkata that serve good quality Chena-Podo. Truly relish that. Overall, good place to visit for the contemporary Bengali sweets.

Good quality sweets, I can't complain about the sweets. The singara and amriti are also very good. The service is nice, and the rates are pretty cheap. Keep up the good work. Thumbs up from my side.

This place is located near Jadavpur 8B bus stand. Though I have had their other sweets too, I am completely in love with their Goja and Kaju Barfi. They are simply heavenly. Their rosogollas are quite good too.

An age old shop, serving heart-craving sweets since a long time now. Located near Jadavpur 8B, they have their own fan following, and hence does pretty well inspite of big heavyshots like Ganguram and Hindustan Sweets. Have tried their Singara and Amriti, and I must say, both of them compliments each other very well. A must visit place, if you want to satiate your hunger, without hurting your pocket.
