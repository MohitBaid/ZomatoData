This place is near my home and often on my way back from office I grab a roll or some other snack from this food joint. I don't have any complaints regarding the rolls, but they are not excellent either, just average. What I really like are the Fish Cutlet and the Fish Fingers. They are really good with the fish fillet thick and tasty. I have tried their Chicken Reshmi Kebab and considering the price I was satisfied. The quality of the momos are way better than the average road-side stalls that stuff the Â dumplings with mostly chopped onions. Here they make large dumplings stuffed with chicken served with a tasty soup. However their Chicken Mughlai was chewy and tough.

One big con is their cleanliness issue. Also they are understaffed and take too much time to serve the orders. Taking out the food is a much better option than eating in the cramped eating area.

I have tried thier rolls so far and does not intend to try anything else from here... The rolls were undercooked and staffing was negligible...

I took kashmiri pulao and chicken kasha for parcel... at my own risk after going across zomato review.. the kashmiri pulao is no where near the original kashmiri pulao.. it is tad sweet and no burnt flavor with rice being hard.. the chicken kasha is too oily and chicken pieces are very hard ... my dinner was a waste that night :(

How terrible it feels if u get a stomach ache right after having food at a restaurant. This thing just happened for me after having crispy chili baby corn and some other food from this place. God please save people from going here.

As this place is a stone throw away from my home i ordered laccha paratha , chicken manchurian , veg noodles and crispy chili baby corn. The thing came after about 1 hour.

But horrendous food it was !! The crispy chili baby corn tasted more like smoked baby corn and my mistake, wait !! It was not baby corn .. It was a normal corn cut into small pieces. One of my fellow zomato friend

Standard fast food joint with average tasting food and cheap prices. For this area in Behala,there was just Biswas as the default fast food destination. Since it has degraded drastically, Akash is definitely a welcome change. There is even a sitting arrangement for 10-12 but it would be best if you take your food home,considering the ambiance.
Had their Chic. Manchurian today which was a tad bit too spicy but okayish in taste and sufficient in quantity for two. Will update on more dishes soon.

Chinese cuisine, biriyani and rolls are decent but mughlai parathas are just horrible here. If you want to try something here just go for rolls or Chinese cuisine.
