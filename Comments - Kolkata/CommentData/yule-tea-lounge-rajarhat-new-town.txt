Sorry to say, but located in a prime location in Eco Park, commanding absurd prices, the food and drink standard does not add up. We ordered Regular Masala tea, Veg Pakoras and Fish Finger. At Rs. 50 a cup, the tea was served reheated out of a microwave!! Absolutely NOT acceptable. The Veg Pakoras, at Rs 120 a plate, was run of the mill. Even my neighborhood shack vendor makes better Veg Pakoras. The Fish Fingers took a whopping 45 minutes to come. While piping hot, the taste wasn't great enough to be memorable. And at Rs 220 a plate, wasn't worth at all. 
Overall, the efficiency and service is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. There were no crowds in the outlet, and nobody was ordering any huge orders. However we ended up spending nearly 90 minutes here and spent nearly 700 bucks for a cup and finger food. NEVER returning here. If you value your money, don't visit here either.

Found this hidden gem inside Eco Park. If you're looking for a calm and peaceful ambience then this the place you must visit. The Treehouse-like wooden cafe has a lovely grandeur to offer. Decorated with tiny lights, this place is offering numerous varity of teas.
They have outdoor sitting as well. We ordered mango iced tea and fresh lime soda as we were already full. The ice tea had mango extract which was a bit sweet. The fresh lime soda was just like any other fresh lime soda.
Will definitely visit again. ðŸ˜„

AMBIANCE :  NICE 

FOOD : AVERAGE 

TEA : SUPERB 

if you want to visit the place to taste some good tea and spend some quality time with your loved ones then the place is nice. They really have a very good collection of tea. I didn't like the food. though I have said Average but it should be below average considering the price . Still I will recommend the place specially on a rainy/ winter evening . You can visit the place to get a feel of small piece of Darjeeling.

Yule Â Tea Lounge is indeed a sweet little corner inside Eco Park. After a long walk we were searching for a cafe and we bumped into this place. Â The food tastes good but the service time was long. Â The ambiance is the best part of it. it has indoor as well as outdoor sitting but the indoor area is smaller. Next time i am definitely trying their Tea.

Very unprofessional attitude. Takes more than an hour to serve a small order of fish and chips. The people serving the food have an attitude that they are serving free food to the people. If asked about  why the food is taking so long, they come up with rude answers like "if you want your food you have to wait". 
Ultimately enquired about the food after 1 hour, they came up with an answer that there has been a miscommunication and the food has been served to some other customer and they are left with no more fish to take that order. 
This is complete unprofessional attitude.

The place looks beautiful n spacious I visited with my wife n 1.5yrs old baby. But had worst experience we ordered Momo n sandwichesâ€‹,while offering Momo to my daughter we found a flies sticking at the back, but the shop owner (a lady) at the counter is extremely rude n arrogant she was just not ready to accept the complain and rather was trying to cover up saying that its not a big deal and can happen. They were unable to manage the issue n told us that they will replace it they made us wait for another 15mins and suddenly she asked what we were waiting for. She was rude and at that point of time we realized she was offering to change the 'one' piece of Momo as it doing some charity. We were stunned to listen this - how pathetic they were with no politeness to accept their fault.

This is nice place in a picturesque setting. Outdoor seating is ideal for winters and evenings of autumn and spring. Otherwise the air conditioned indoor seating is preferable. Fresh lime soda, rajgarh masala tea, French fries and chicken sandwich are good. Quantity and quality of food is good.

My father introduced me to the yule tea lounge. It has a very bohemian and rustic feel to it. It also has a small "darljeeling tea garden".
The place is definitely made for tea lovers unlike me. But I did order a kahwa for myself. We also ordered pasta, momos and corn cheese sandwich.

MINUS:
â€¢The air conditioned seating area is small and little uncomfortable.
â€¢The food still needs a little more brush up in terms of taste.


PLUS:
â€¢A perfect place for friends and couples to hangout. 
â€¢The food tastes is pretty decent.
â€¢The ambience is lovely.

The wood house set up gives an experience like tea estate/forest resort. The ambience was great. Great tasting tea which asked for a repeat. Fish finger and veg pakora were good accompaniments. We spent an hour of family time that was definitely worth. You won't get this experience in coffee day or food court. Come here for the tea and for the experience. Need anything else?

The only thing good about this place is the peace one gets. Restaurant has too many flies to spoil ones experience. Ordered for tuna sandwhich , white sauce pasta , mango ice tea and black current ice tea. Every food item was below average. Not recommended. Simply avoid.

A very well placed cafe inside Ecopark. I loved its location and its set-up. The wooden house effect sets in a different mood altogether. It has both inside and outside seating arrangements. I preferred to sit outside as it was evening, and I was loving the surroundings and the vibes. Had ordered for a cup of Masala Tea for my friend, and Lemon Iced Tea for myself (as that was the only option available) and a plate of Chicken Pakora as an accompaniment. The food and the tea were okayish, nothing extraordinary to be mentioned.

There are lot of scope of improvement. Very limited options available in menu, out of which many are not available there if you order. The staff working there are quite well behaved, but the owner of the cafe is a big disappointment. Rude and areogant behaviour of the owner.

Although I loved the ambience and location, I am very big time dissatisfied with the food and hospitality.

The most rude customer service in town
1."i wont swipe ur debit card please give us cash cause swipping would require wasting unnecessary time".... Swipes the card anyways cause we did not carry cash
2.u have to go down to get the noodles which is served in thin paper plate..we also go a broken palpable plastic fork which was prbbly meant for a kid to go with the noodles
3.u have to carry the heavy food in tht thin paper plate upstairs... Cause they dont know the meaning of the customs of a proper restaurant
4.the noodles did not have any toppings and the plastic fork broke mid way during meal
5.the quality of the representation of the noodles was lower than the street food stalls... Who the hell gives food on paper plates in a big restaurant
6.the main boss or should i call  in charge the salty black guy shouted on a waiter in abusive language infront of the customers creating a foul atmosphere....for us and the others

Please dont try going into this place totally a waste of your money, time and mood... They dont even make a proper bill nor a print out... They just write on a plain piece of paper and had it to you... Customer service like this shouldnt be allowed in our country.

Located near gate no. 3 of Eco Park and there is a "Ghum" toy train station near this Yule tea lounge. It's January, chilling cold outside, perfect weather and I was craving for tea. The interiors are inspired from stylish cottage from British rule. Excellent seating arrangement and the staffs were very friendly. Ordered for Darjeeling tea, Fish fry & French fries. Tea and Fish item tasted amazing. Little bit costly, but worth it and yes they don't add any taxes. Hospitality were very good & will love to come again.

if you are willing to have a flavored special kind of tea and sitting in to the nature. then this this place is definitely for you. it is located inside the Eco park beside the tea garden. apart from tea, we had double chicken salami sandwich and veg pakoda.. both are delicious. we would love to try some pastry from there as they look delicious. it will be good if they offer more food items as the items are very limited.. over all its a very good and decent place.

This place looks incredibly beautiful..brings back my lost memories of the bungalows in the tea gardens of darjeeling of my childhood. Perfect seating place for people for a long time to relax and just enjoy the company of each other in the backdrop of a beautiful setting, it sometimes feel so wonderful as in it feels like the whole universe conspired for that perfect romantic moment to happen. 

It is located just behind the mask garden n gate no.  3 of the eco park. 

There is an inside air conditioned indoor place with a large led TV and the main reception counter. Since primarily they inherit the tea business so there are a lot of varieties of tea which you can taste and even if you like so much then you buy too. 

Since it is primarily a tea lounge, the tea and their variety is not incredible but they taste fantastic. Some of them will just be my benchmark of the tea experience I have anywhere. 

Since there is very limited choice, anyone can expect the quality to be nice. Perfect munching menu. 

The few items I tasted all were nice and rightly cooked. 

The waiting time can be long due to lack of staff but you won't mind that. 

There is no tax. The price in the menu is the final price you pay. Hence very very reasonable. Though compared to other places the pocket pinch is high. 

It's  a must if you're in the area.

Went here one fine evening with my friend, as Yule Tea Lounge was on my bucket list for quite some time.Â 
It is a small cafe, and the setting is to die for! It has both indoor and outdoor seating. Especially, during the dusk, it looks amazingly romantic. This rating is actually skewed more towards the ambiance.
Coming to the food, it really needs improvement, both taste-wise and its availability! Other reviewers would agree with me, and the management should seriously consider this aspect as well. We had chicken lollipop just because dry chilli chicken was not available. The chicken was absolutely not fresh, it was chewy and hard, although the presentation was okay. Next my friend had masala tea and I had white tea. The white tea was good, with subtle flavors and a slight vegetal taste (probably it was due to brewing). It will leave you with no aftertaste unlike more bold flavors in case of green tea. My friend had masala tea which was definitely not good! They should have used liquid milk rather than lyophilized milk powder. Moreover, the milk powder formed tiny lumps and was floating in the cup! What a disappointment! I guess they can go and learn the art of making masala tea from any road side vendor (they make better than you guys n charge just a fraction of what you tag it at)!
Price is definitely on the higher side. I don't mind paying but yes, if the quality is really worth it. Also, the service sucks! You need to be more professional when in hotel and hospitality industry, else you are ruined.
Am I coming back? Ummmmmm.....not sure, guess it is a no! Not much interested actually.

The lounge reminds us of a ever refreshing dose of caffeine. The place is filled with opulent aroma of export quality tea of several varied flavours & make. This place also offers snack time food as well. Overall,yule tea lounge makes us feel like an evening spent in the picturesque hill-station of "GHOOM"

You not only pay here for foods and drinks, you pay here for the ambience, you pay here for the comfort, you pay here for feeling that you are in a english tea bar in a foreign country. Beautiful english scores on background. Loads of varieties of tea all around. Foods are reasonably priced and prepared and served well with decent garnishing. Flavoured fresh lime soda was sooo refreshing that one was not enough. The fish fry was very much edible, served with salad, chips, french fries and kasundi. Both the outdoor and indoor sitting were equally enjoyable. Must visit for sophistication-lovers.

What a tea lounge!!!!

Oh what a warm cozy place!! Have been there recently and was pleasantly surprised to find such a nice cafe to relax.Â 
To get here, one has to enter through Gate Â No.3 of Eco Park and then take a right. This stands opposite to the Ghum station where the Toy train stops as well. What a concept! A little corner of Darjeeling!
The variety of Darjeeling tea found is great and the way it is served is even better. I was there with a friend and we ordered for a cup of Darjeeling Jasmine(Green) tea and the regular Darjeeling tea, for the flavour and the aroma respectively.
And we loved them! The cafe served marie biscuits as complimentary with the tea.
For snacks, we had ordered for a cheese corn sandwich and a chicken sandwich which were ordinary. And then we ordered for their freshly baked Chocolate cake.
The cake was moist and nice, looked and tasted home-made to the core!
The prices were just ok I would say.
All in all,we had a great experience to say the least. And the people in the cafe from the waiters to the owners were so warm and friendly that made us even more comfortable.
So, if u love tea, u gotto visit this place and even if u don't love tea, visit it for the sheer experience!

I have vlogged my experience as well, in case you are interested to checkout my Youtube channel, below is the link to the vlog:

Darjeeling in Kolkata... This is the first thing that will come in your mind. Ghum station with a carriage of TransHimalayan Railways complemented by a tea garden , these are all about the Yule Tea Lounge in Eco Park Rajarhat. It has the propensity to become "the destination" of the tea connoisseurs of the city. Varieties of blends to choose from which are kept in perfect order in a stylised cottage inspired by the British era architecture. And they do serve yummy momos which are soulful delight and the sandwiches are simply superb. 

The entire package comes with a warm hospitality of Mr. and Mrs. Neil Law. Thank you very much Â for a nice evening which I spent there with my friends. 

Gate number 3 of Ecopark is the nearest entry point .
