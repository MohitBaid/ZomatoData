Visited this place on the day of christmas eve with a friend of mine.Its very easy to locate since its very close to the park street metro station.Also this place is relatively new.So we decided to give it a try.The interiors have this dim atmosphere.Its American themed and has a good choice of food options.We went for their tandoor for starters and for maincourse we had their chicken nasi goreng rice along with black pepper chicken.The food was delicious.The place is attracting a lot of attention it seems as it was quite full on the day we visited it.A good place to visit again.

A spacious American themed diner. The staff was cordial and very forthcoming. The servers came up with suggestions and were extremely helpful. I had :
Mezze platter: the platter was missing kebabs the day I ordered and we had to do with pita only. The carrots were not fresh. The dips were good but 2 elements from the dish were wrong.

Chicken skillet : perfectly seasoned and balanced. Filling quantity. 

Overall, a great place. Service was quick during lunch hours. Some elements can be improved.

It has a great pub like ambience but doesn't serve alcohol. That's a slight minus. The Stir Fried Chicken in Basil Sauce was unique and great. The falafel tikki with hummus wasn't special. The Chicken Lasagna was satisfactory. The prices are probably a bit too steep considering the food quality. Deserves a one time visit, considering how conveniently it's located.

We ordered fried chicken, guloti kebab, chicken lasagna, a mexican hotpot rice , blue lagoon, green apple martini, mango margherita and kiwi juice(cant recall the fancy name). 

Good points: (Food) Fried chicken was tasty. The lasagna was also creamy n yummy. The mango margharita and green apple martini were pretty good.
(Ambience) The interior is dim lit so it gives room for privacy. Spacious enough. I liked the interio. Good for catchung up with friends on a weekend late afternoon. 
Bad points:  The quantity is very little for all the food items, especially the fried chicken. Didnt really like the guloti kebab. We did not like the mexican hot pot rice. There was spice in it...but it did not click well with any of us (there were 4-5 of us). If you are a die hard mexican cuisine lover I guess it might be likable, then. 

Final conclusion: The food is the main attraction. And given the quantity, its not a value for money place. I have been to better places for similar price values. The overall experience would be good for first timers. But I would expect more out of such establishments given the vast range of restaurants there are in Park Street.

Standing in the queue for about 45min resulted in entering a place of fine American diner. My 25th eve was well sorted at this place. The place was fully packed up, and my 45min wait was worthwhile. The ambience was absolutely up to the mark, and made me feel like I was sitting in an old school American restaurant. The staff service was excellent. We ordered spinach cheese balls and dunken prawn in starters, the cheese balls gave some new taste to my taste buds which I haven't came across yet, so as for the prawn dish. The main course came with pepperazzi's roasted whole chicken and the preparation was excellent. Strawberry darshan came in our desert list making our dinner a fully complete one. 
A nice place to visit with family. A must visit for all foodies. #StronglyRecommended

Next time will try their American & Indian dishes. Though not so pocket friendly. Little turn off was that, they are still yet to get liquor licence, so no alcohol.

Heard a lot about its food recently and finally got a chance to visit it. The ambience is very mediocre and can be worked upon. The food was amazing. We ordered kebab platter, ravioli and mexican rice with salsa dip. Everything was yummmm. We even ordered a few mocktails which were not very great. But for food lovers it a place worth visiting.

Cool ambience. Very expensive though. Staff was courteous but they took a lot of time in preparing their food precisely why we ordered just 2 dishes and left without ordering dessert. 
The dishes were namely : 

1. Chicken Satay : Pretty normie chicken fry with the red stir fry sauce. Nothing appealing about it. Don't understand why it was under the Thai Section, when it had nothing Thai about it. There was no presentation either. Simply 6 flat chicken pieces with a long tooth pick inserted for no reason whatsoever. 

2. Four cheese sauce : This was basically pasta with 4 kinds of cheese namely Cheddar, Mozzarella, Parmesan, Gorgonzola. They served it with 4 slices of Garlic bread which came complimentary. But price was again on the higher side with Rs 370 for just a plate of Pasta.

A new entry to the food hub, park street is The diner by pepparazi. Conveniently located on the main road. The restaurant is spacious with ample seating area. The interiors are done with a lot of neon lights in blue and red with posters of american pop culture. The retro feels are on spot. The service was prompt. I ordered a Virgin blue lagoon to start with, which was basic and made good. For starters we ordered

Potato and leek soup: the thick soup was served inside a bun, was creamy and tasted good.

Wild mushroom cuppaccino soup: it was average. It could have been made better and i missed the foam totally.

Tandoori kabab platter which was assorted kebabs of mushroom, cauliflower , paneer, alu and babycorn. The alu malai kebab was amazing. The kebabs were strongly smoked which I like a lot though the marination was a bit less flavourful.

Loving on to the main course we ordered

Sabz shikari masala: a blend of veggies in onion gravy was nice and spicy.

Corn kofta masaledar: it was okay, though the gravy was nice I was expecting some more corn in the koftas.

Charcoal paneer makhani: creamy and tangy, the dish was very good.

The breads were all amazingly done. Fresh, perfectly cooked and properly greased. We had
Onion kulcha, Paneer kulcha, Cheese naan and Masala Garlic naan. I loved them all.

We didn't have much space for the desserts . The service was good and humble. The prices are not very high which is a big winner. Casual dinners recommended. Because I tried only the north indian cuisine, the review is based only on the given condition.

This is a newly opened diner in Park Street and also quite pronounced so we decided to pay a visit and get a taste of it on the 16th of December. The decor is amazing and the music makes an excellent environment to enjoy. Full marks when it comes to ambiance and waiter service.
It gets a little tricky when it comes to the food though. We ordered :
Batter Fish Fry as a starter
Mutton Rogan Josh as the main course with
Green Peas Pulao
The fish was tender and simple, really liked it, no complaints whatsoever. Next comes the rogan josh, although the gravy was good but the lamb was extremely stiff, it was tough to chew and tear, which came both as a surprise and as a big disappointment. The pulao was as expected, good enough.
Although it was my first visit so I'm not so sure about the quality of everything available here, but definitely should improve.

One of the very good new places in the city. After some really poor places which still charge a bomb, this is worth what you pay!
A fantastic ambience coupled with great and attentive service with some of the most amazing dishes.
We ordered broccoli cheese soup served in bread bowl, cheese fondue both of which were lip smacking.
The threadbare paneer was good.
The Mexican rice with salsa stole the show though. Really amazing food.

Best part of it was everything could be made jain 💖

Pepparazzi is the latest addition to the food scene in the Park Street hub. Back in town after a year almost, I was here for lunch along with three of my friends.

AMBIANCE-
The ambiance is a big plus. Being an American diner themed restaurant, the decor is beautifully done with movie posters. With a playlist comprising of popular rock n roll and retro classics, the place actually gives out a vintage diner feel. The place is beautifully lit, perfect for selfies😉

FOOD-
Their menu is very well spread out. From Chinese to Italian to Indian there is a wide range of options to chose from. Also, equally good number of options for vegetarians.

What we had-

NACHOS GRANDE- Extremely filling. The topping was good. The salsa could have been better.

ChICKEN SATAY - Classic dish, nicely done.

CHILLI HONEY LOTUS STEM - Huge disappointment. Wasn't crispy enough. Wouldnt recommend.

GREEN THAI CURRY - Good consistency , although I felt it was lacking in flavours.

GRILLED FISH IN PORTUGUESE SAUCE - Quality of fish was really good. Liked it.

RAVOILI IN CREOLE SAUCE - Best of the lot. Loved it. Beautifully done. The Creole Sauce was extremely delectable. Although I feel the presentation can be improved.

CHICKEN STEAK - Another let down. The meat was dry, even adding oodles of sauce dint help.

The Mojitos were good amongst the mocktails.

SERVICE -
Being a weekend, the place was relatively empty but the service was extremely slow. Although the staff was amicable but a little bit promptness is required.

VALUE FOR MONEY -
Pretty affordable. For 7 food items and 4 mocktails , the bill came up to something around 3527/-

Overall-
Ambiance -5/5
Food - 3.5/5
Service -3/5
Value for Money - 4/5

I wish they get the alcohol license soon.

Came to pepperazzi with my team for lunch... With the menu options we decided to only gorge on starters... The team enjoyed the lemon grilled fish,  chicken.  Though we were contemplating....  We loved the cheese fondue. Falafel and hummus was OK (better than some other places that I have tried). The ambience and decor is awesome.  Am sure once they have the license to pour,  it will be difficult to find a foot in the door.

Went there on Saturday and it was a horrible experience. For an American themed diner, there was no 'Diner' food on the the menu. Also, the menu selection is lopsided. The Chinese section has half a dozen options for rice / noodles but only one option of only one chicken side i.e. Chilly Chicken. 

The place is really nicely decorated but the trashy they were playing gave me and my wife a headache. 

The service staff is extra attentive to the point it gets annoying. We had three different people come to serve food, instructions given to the first person was not passed onto the other two. My wife was in the middle of eating a bite and one of the service staff wanted to replace the plate for the main course. 

The menu and the feedback form was filled with spelling mistakes. This shows the lack of dedication on the part of the management to look at the finer points.

I would not recommend this place, purely because of a really bad menu selection, especially for people who prefer to eat non-veg.

Another food joint adds in the list of Park street restaurant,  located beside domino's pizza,  opposite to great western hotel and another must visit..  Great decor, good music,  friendly staff, cozy seating arrangement,  serves multi cuisine and tasty food makes the place awesome. We ordered cream of chicken soup, mango margarita,  stir fried chicken in basil sauces and mexican hot pot rice. Cream of chicken soup was little bit different from other food joints in taste.  The flavour of roasted chicken in creamy soup  gives a kick to your taste buds.  Stir fried chicken in basil sauce was sooooo yummy,  one of their signature dishes.  Overall great experience.. And would love to visit again to try their other dishes

Me and my family came here for a special dine out and we were not disappointed.The service was impeccable and the food was delicious. The sea bass preparation deserves a special mention. Great place for continental lovers! The Chaplin and Monroe effect on the walls will sway the heart to some old silent movie era with the perfect lights and sound. We were made to feel welcome and our meal was very reasonably priced. Before we had even finished our meal we were planning the next time we would eat here!

This is a diner themed restaurant located in Park Street. The ambience of the place is really good and the interiors are very well done. The restaurant serves a variety of cuisines like North Indian, Lebanese Mexican, Italian and Thai. We tried three of their soups- The Mexican chilli bean soup, Jalapeno cheese soup and The cheddar cheese broccoli soup. The cheddar cheese soup is their speciality which is served in a bun and is quite filling. The soups were nice but nothing very great. We also ordered a lasagna, burrito and the garden skillet. The burrito wasn't an authentic one but it was very cheesy and delicious and so was the lasagna. However I didn't really like the garden skillet. Although the menu it's quite extensive, there was only one option for dessert which was a bit disappointing. The service was efficient and quick. This is a nice place to enjoy with your family.

Another food joint in Park Street and another must visit!! The ambience, the decor, the staff members, the music everything was bang on here!!
The food menu is very happening as you get so much variety, starting from Mexican to Italian to Pan-Asian to Grilled items to Indian dishes! Yes, it does cover a vast variety! 
We opted for the Pan-Asian food. For starters we had Pan Fried Chilly Fish. It was very tasty. The crust was crisp and the fish was soft and well cooked. For the main course we had Mixed Fried Rice and Chicken Manchurian. Oh! How tasty the Manchurian was!! The taste and flavour of the Chicken was succulent! It had the smell and flavour of coriander and it was amazing. 
Although we wanted to have their Grilled Chicken Steak, but somehow felt a bit disappointed to know that they would serve shredded pieces of chicken instead of a whole portion. Nonetheless, it was an absolutely satisfying experience and would surely love to visit again to try their other delicacies!

Slightly inconvenient approach coz you gotta park a distance away and walk down the isle of park street. This is the biggest drawback which can be a reason y there would be low footfall, but yes over the weekends I am sure this place would be bustling. No alcohol is a NO NO!!! 

With such an exhaustive menu ranging from American to Mexican to Italian to Lebanese to Indian and Thai etc etc, you need wine and spirit to add to the fine dining. Nevertheless, it’s worth a visit and I must say more because the taste and presentation of food is just perfect. You wouldn’t complain for anything here I suppose. 

This place has got all the boxes ticked except for alcohol but once that’s sorted, it can call for more footfall and be a happening joint. 

Signature Soup and what I loved is the Brocolli and Cheddar cheese soup in bread bowl. It’s heavy, so guess good for two or may be two and a half ;)

Had a great time and am looking forward to try most of the other stuff.

Reviewing  food joints is becoming a bit of an addiction. Earlier, one could eat at ten places and review a couple if the mood came, but now it seems urgent.
Anyway – here goes –
Pepperazzi is a new place, spanking clean and shiny, a small entrance with stairs leading up and a very spacious first floor.
The menu is diverse and interesting. We had lunch yesterday  –
Soup in a Bread Bowl [Chicken]
Ravioli in Creole Sauce
Grilled Fish in Basil Lemon Sauce
Each item was super. The sauces perfect. The ingredients fresh. The presentation  tasteful. We fell upon it as soon as served and Omnivore forgot to take photos of the food.
It would have been perfect if we could have had coffee to pep us up after a wondrous meal, but no hot after-meal beverage is available. Let’s hope they relax this rule for actual diners.

Excellent ambiance and great hospitality by Mr. Wasim. The food was beyond expectations, recommending for four cheese pasta. The place has a great environment with their rest room, having crazy idea. The place is perfect for a splendid evening.

I would definitely recommend to try this place out . It sort of gives you a DINER feel . The ambience is amazing and surprisingly the food too . We ordered Tacos , the Chefs special paneer sabzi and cheese garlic naan with Cranberry Margherita . Everything was delicious and worth the price . The quality and quantity for what they charge is worth it . 
Def give this place a try with friends or family .
