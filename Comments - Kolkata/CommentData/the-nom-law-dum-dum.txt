I recently tried a Vanilla Chilli Cupcake from this place. The cupcake tasted heavenly. The cake was moist with an enormous amount of cream frosting placed on top of it. I loved the hint of chilly in the frosting. The sweetness was balanced. 

Overall, I'd love to explore more from this bakery. I believe this place is a hidden gem in the city.

They have a wide array of bakeries and chocolates. I tasted a few from their bakery stuff. The cupcakes are really nice over there. They have some unique flavours.

The Nom Law was there at CalBunka! Tasted few of the cupcakes, the green chilli and white chocolate cake pops and brought the black forest cake, home. The cake pops will always leave you craving for more  because of the perfect mixture of hot and sweet! The black forest cake is amazing, too! The price is very reasonable.
