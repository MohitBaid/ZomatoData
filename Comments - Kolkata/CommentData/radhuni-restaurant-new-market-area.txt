Located at mirza galib street to be more precise. This place serves simple but tasty Bengali delicacies. Last week my brother and I had gone there for lunch after our shopping spree. We ordered rice, mutton curry,fries, dal,murg polao and a coke! Food was humble but tasty. I would definitely go back just for their mutton curry. It tasted like home! I didn't find anything special in their murg polao. It was basically just a plate of polao and a piece of chicken chaap on top of it! The ambience was decent, nothing to brag about. Their service was quick and the waiters were friendly and sweet. I was surprised by their pricing. It was inclusive taxes! If u want to enjoy a good homely Bengali meal after a tiring shopping spree in new market, then this is the place for you to go to.

There might be many restaurants in town serving Bengali dishes and I tend to rate them slightly on the higher side as because I turn critical while reviewing my 'home' dish. However, this particular restaurant is on my hit list owing to their culture which is worse than many.

Normally all the eateries gradually increases their rates to meet the increasing prices of items. However, this restaurant does follow this mantra along with a sudden but temporary surge price on festive season. This, according to me, is a major drawback in the minds of a customer.

The ratings of 3.0 on Zomato is due to the fact that earlier it used to serve good quality food. However, as the time went, taste and quality both started to deteriorate with prices taking a steady slope. Many will argue to the fact citing reasons that it's price is still lower than most of the eateries and I will admit to their claims.

But, just this one advantage doesn't give them a green signal to increase price on festive. It might go on that, due to higher footfall in the restaurant, we are making an surge pricing of 1.5x (Uber and Ola model). This differential pricing might benefit the taxi aggregators but not a restaurant who serves food to the people.

I used to have liking towards the fish item (paturi), but, that has considerably declined in taste. While visiting the place with family was a boon, but, the time I started to be independent, this place has planned not to satisfy me anymore.

A visit to be avoided.

Popular restaurant amongst Bangaleshi tourists staying near Free School street. Availability of food items not consistent. Frequent visitor to the restaurant owing to its reasonable price and quality of food. Service and cleanliness lacking. Favorite dishes at this place: murgh pulao, chingri malai curry, Alu poshto.

Food: 4/5

Visited the place only once. An old place which I think was a fine eating house once upon a time. Now has become shabby with the remembrance of its glory full past. 
The food was good but not great. The staff was very chatty to be precise which actually was not a bad thing. Had a little moment with them.   

Coming to the food we ordered Rice, Bhetki Paturi, Kachu Chingri and Taki Fish Bharta... the Kachu chingriand fish bharta were nice. Paturi was very dry and the rice quality should have been better. Prices were on the lower side.

Oberall rating.... Average looking place with little above average food.... :)

Ordinary ambiance. Most of the food items are below average in terms of quality. Though I liked their Aloo Poshto. 
However, the price is reasonable enough. 
Mostly the Bangladeshi people staying nearby Hotels go there for lunch.

I have been there many times since it was near by my previous office. Ordinary ambiance. Prices are moderate. We often had Aloo posto, rui mach and aar mach which were okay. My favorite was the Murg Polau. Overall experience was okay :)

Went there on a Monday after shopping. The restaurant, although dull was clean. The staff were courteous and were eager to serve. The food was extremely cheap and these were the plus points. Now coming to the food: huge disappointment! The rice was served in huge quantity and was fluffy. The musoor dal was extremely thin but tasted good. The aloo-posto was also delicious. However, bhetki maacher paturi was simply bad: there was not the slightest hint of mustard and the entire preparation was made using posto. It was supposed to have two pieces of fish but we got just one. The aar maacher jhol was average. What they claimed to be Rui maacher kalia, was more like watery jhol. Overall we were extremely disappointed with the food and would not recommend it to anyone. If you want to try authentic Bengali food, then there are a couple of much better restaurants in the neighborhood.

It was raining, I was hungry and coincidently at Mirza Ghalib street - three reasons to how I ended up to this place.

It has an ordinary ambience with a very homely service. Seeing the menu, I wanted to order biryani but, since it was unavailable, the waiter suggested me to have murg pulao. When served, the platter was not so appealing but when I tasted it, the food was beyond my expectations. Seriously, the murg pulao at this place is a must try out, really good food at a very reasonable price.

I visited this place like 5-6years ago I ordered roti and mixed vegetables and for my surprise the food was unexpectedly delicious I was amazed by the taste specially ROTI it was so soft that you should try this even if you don't have teeth.. ambience was good too.. But the only down side was their SERVICE they took very long to place my order.. even though the service is bad I'm not upset only because of the taste...

I decided to try it out once when walking through rafi ahmed kidwai road.
Ordered a simple meal of rice,dal and mutton curry. Received horrible service. Firstly I had to ask them 3-4 times to even get someone to place my order. I was made to wait for a long time within which the waiters were busy doting on large bangladeshi groups. Then I wanted some bhajis and I was brushed off. The cooking was moderate,not at all what I would expect from a restaurant. The rice was poor in quality.
I'm not going back again,definitely.

If you are looking for authentic homely Bengali food then you should try out Radhuni restaurant. I went there for lunch today with my parents and we were presently surprised. It is a small air conditioned restaurant in the new market area. It also has a non air conditioned section. Not very clean but that is okay because the food compensates for it. They have traditional Bengali food items and we tried their ruhi kalai, Mung dal, karela bhaji, aloo posto, bhindi bhaji and mutton curry. They were all delicious except that the aloo posto had a lot of oil. We had the mishti doi for dessert which had a great combination of sweet and sour taste. On the whole a good culinary experience.

I had a visit just as a passer by with certain invitation by one of my friend who suggested me that restaurant and I'll b greatfull to him for lifetime due to Radhuni's one of best dish The Great Murg Polao called in bengali morog polao. With decent decor and service in lunch time it was just out of the world and I cant explain it more just go and taste.

I visit there sometimes when I visit New Market. Its located there. 

Its prices are moderate and food quality is tasteful. Chicken Masala is yummy and Chingri Malai Curry is also not bad. Service is slow and hospitality is fine. Ambience is mediocre. 

One more thing, Pabda Fish is my fav. 

i would rate 3.0 for RADHUNI.

In a nutshell:

Spartan interiors, fast service, tasty long lost Bengali food & easy on the pocket.

Background:

Bengali food is usually associated with fish, meats & everything non vegetarian. However there r some extraordinary vegetarian food items made from leaves, stems, flowers, roots etc that cost minimal but taste YUMM e.g. Mocha (banana flower), thor (the pith of the banana stem), oal (root), bok Phool (flower), kumro Phool (pumpkin flower), kochu pata (leaf), kochu (root), lau shak (leaf) etc. These have unique tastes & flavours and most of these r different from the mainstream usually available Indian vegetarian food.

Short Description - In case u r in a hurry:

Unfortunately, availability of most of the items mentioned above have limited availability nowadays in bigger city markets of Kolkata. Some of these dishes r difficult to make & the rest r painstaking to make / need lot of patience. A visit to Radhuni can however bridge this gap - u can enjoy the excellent taste traditional Bengali vegetarian gems without having to sweat it out to make these. Some of the 'vegetarian' dishes contain shrimps etc.

 Radhuni also has a long list of Bengali nonvegetarian dishes that r good but not outstanding. However, if u r visiting Kolkata / planning to eat out local cuisine, it cannot get better than this at that price.

 The service is fast. The people here r nice - they r not typical trained Restaurant Server types. They r normal human beings who respond well to good behaviour from customers.

The interiors r Spartan - a lot like South Indian Udipi Restaurants. 
Prices r unbelievably low (by Delhi / Mumbai standards).

Detailed Description - In case u have the time to njoy Reading:

We started our lunch with Kochu pata (leaf of Kochu plant) chingri (prawn). It had mustard paste, a  bit of poppy seeds (khus khus) & spices. The taste was delicious & simply awesome. Chingri added to the taste & flavor but the kochu was too good on its own. I wud give this a 4.5/5.

Then came mochar ghonto. Mocha as I mentioned b4, is banana flower. This one tasted very good too. The spices were not ground & hence the taste was spicy, rustic & good. Since mustart oil was used to cook the dish, there was an element of pungency as well. I wud give this dish 4/5.

Third came kochu saag (stem). This one was very good too. If not done well, this tends to be slimy. However, the one at Radhuni was not slimy as all. I wud give this 4.25/5 

 Next came lau chingri. Lau is lauki / gourd / ghiya. This is also considered vegetarian by many people though it has chingri (prawns) in it. At Radhuni, this appears in the 'Dal & vegetable' section. This was good but not wow. I wud give this 3.5/5.

Post this we had Chitol machher peti. Chitol is a huge fish with loads of bones in it. However, its peti (belly area) is sought after due to its unique soft buttery texture & less concentration of bones. The fish served at Radhuni was smaller than the optimum size but it was good. I wud give this 4.25/5. The gravy was non thick yet tasty.

The bhetki  paturi (betki fish cooked in banana leaf) was good - fish & mustard paste wrapped in banana leaf & deep fried / grilled. The pungency of Mustard was suboptimal - a bit disappointing for Bengalis but I guess good enough for others. Coz full blown pungency hits the sinuses directly & that is something that not everyone might b able to appreciate. I wud give this 3.75/5. 

The last dish for our lunch was Kosha Mangsho (Mutton Curry). The mutton pieces were a bit too 'bone'y but was soft & nice in texture. The gravy was pretty ordinary & inferior to any good kosha mangho made by any 'good cook' Bengali housewife. I wud give this 3.5/5.

 To end the meal we had anaras (pineapple) chutney - It was a sweet'n sour dessert made with pineapple & little bits of date. Excellent to taste. 4.5/5
The last item for our lunch was inhouse - made mishit doi (sweet curd). This was good but not great. I wud say 3.75/5. The good thing was that this doi did not have the thick layer of fat atop it.

Overall the lunch score adds up to 4/5 for food at Radhuni. I loved this experience & recommend it to u. Check it out.

Visited this restaurant first time pretty famous for Bengali(Bangladesh version) cuisines. Not that clean, good service, filled up with mostly bangladeshi people. But liked their foods. They also serve pudding unlike other so called bengali restaurants, tried it; not that brilliant, but was okay. Also eager to try one of their competitors situated nearby.
