Such cool places right beside my house ...one wonders food really reaches every customer if its worth the taste and investment .
kG4 is such a place .
A unique set of skills that results in neat presentation and the food is also quite good .
Try out the non-veg dishes its worth the shot .

Great taste. I got my first order delivered before time. Happy with the service! I requested for less oily and less spicy. Hope they will keep up the quality!

Dunno exactly where it is ....but it's somewhere near my residence....anyway not bothered with the location as long as deliveries reach on time....ordered a simple chicken fried noodles (hakka chowmein) and it was good....the quantity is enough for two but I ate all of it....the food was fresh ,hot and the chicken pieces and vegetables seemed like they were freshly procured....the taste was fine....will order again for a qiick bite in future...

Food is pretty good considering the price. We have ordered a couple of times and it was pretty good. We had ordered fried rice, chilly chicken, BBQ chicken, pan fried chilly fish, corn and broccoli in black pepper sauce gravy. All of them  was well prepared.

Very bad food quality and bad attitude of the staff on the phone.  Never again to order from them.  In fact the food and health dept should pay a visit to the restaurant' and should have it closed down forever. 

The food was stinking and even the cover of the containers were already fadef as if the containers were recycled/ reused.  See the picture attached here.

One of the pocket-friendly restaurants in Garia (Hindustan More) area. Ordered food from this restaurant via Swiggy. The Chilli butter garlic prawns, crispy fry chilli chicken and chicken momos (fried) were delicious. Looking forward to ordering from here again. Must try for Chinese and Thai cuisine lovers.

Delivery was awesome, food was awesome. Food was delivered within time. Quantity was sufficient for two. I ordered mixed fried rice n chicken pak choi, both tasted so good. Along with the delivery,  the packaging was good,  the liquid carrying food box was wrapped in cellophane. I will order again soon.

This place is located near hindusthan more and is opposite the bodyline gym. It is known for quality takeaways as dinning- in is not an option.
Coming to the food the Chicken drumsticks are pretty good. The Chicken momos are pretty decent. The Schezwan hakka noodles and the pan fried noodles were delicious. The thukpas are also good. The garlic pepper chicken was an awesome side dish.
This place is a must visit for all chinese lovers. I am looking forward to my next visit.

KG4 is the latest addition in garia area serving pocket friendly food. They provide delivery/take away services only. So far i have availed the services of swiggy to try the following items:-

1. Chicken drumsticks - Half plate comes with 4pcs. Decently sized lollipops with ample amount of chicken & not too overpowered with batter. Chilli garlic sauce is also provided with the dish. Good to taste!!

2. Chilli garlic butter fish - Superb starter to have if you are looking for something different than your daily chicken starters. 8pcs of basa shallow stir fried in butter tossed with onions,garlic & spring onions. The dish comes in dry version!! The taste was really good. Recommended dish!!

3. Pad thai noodles - The price of the dish attracted me since i'm a huge fan of pad thai noodles. The dish certainly comes in very generous quantity. Taste & quality wise was also decent but i thought it was a bit undercooked due to the fact that i found it chewy. Presence of adequate vegetables & chicken was good to see.

4. Tsing hoi chicken - Diced version of chicken dish comes in very good quantity. The dish was not very spicy & was on the sweeter side but complimented the pad thai noodles really well.

Overall a value for money place!!

P.s. Pictures have been posted separately.

Before anything. Let me say that this is a take away with free home delivery food centre and it does that very efficiently.  I stay nearby and often go to this place. As im writing this review i just finished savouring the chicken thukpa that i brought while returning home. In simple words.  You would be really happy with the quantity they provide and also the quality.09 Soup was really tasty. Noodles were smooth and thick. Chicken slices and vegetables were prominent throughout the container. And yes.. u even find large pieces of fresh mushrooms. Not too spicy and i liked it that way. The blend was perfect . Its true that you have to wait for sometime to get almost anything. But its worth it and you will end up with a smile for sure. Also the packaging was good.  Thanks to swiggy you can get your food right at your home but i prefer you visiting the place at least once.  Its a small startup business from some North east guys. And momos, thukpas, and thais they do the best. They will eventually grow if they continue to do the good work. My stomach is full as well as my words. Cant expect anything more than this.

We order a rice a plate of noodles and a paneer dish!!! When ordered we specifically made comment for nonspicy food in the special instruction and said the same twice as it was for 2 small kids!!! I ended up getting horribly spicy food with chopped red chillies!!!TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!! We need good food in terms of quality not quantity!!! We skipped pizza for this and the kids had to sleep hungry!!! PATHETIC

Situated in a remote alley near Garia Metro Station is a street food restaurant which serves authentic Chinese and Thai food. Their place might not seem that much appealing, but the food might take you aback. In my opinion, it was better than Tibetan Delight. Service was slow and we were getting impatient having to wait alongside the shack for our food, but once it came, all the negatives were overshadowed. We ordered steam momo, pan fried momo in schezuwan sauce and Tom Yum Soup. The momos were delectable, soft and tasty, while it had the right amount of spice. The soup was thick and it reflected the essence of Thai cooking. They surely have got their recipes right. The noteworthy thing about this restaurant has to be it's quantity of food at such low prices. 8 pieces of jumbo sized momos only for Rs. 120. All their dishes follow the same price range, but the quantity is HUGE for one. So you better take a friend with you. :D
