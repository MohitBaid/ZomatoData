Not satisfactory 
The quantity of the food is not enough and the product and quality of the food specially the rice is very very bad ... but the roll section is quite good .. but with main course i m not satisfied 
Try to change or improve the quality of rice and noodles

Only fried rice ,chilli chicken and all kinds of chowmins are good here...Nothing else...very cheap compared to other restaurants.
Ambience is pathetic.

This is a childhood memory of my puja outings. The food, specially mughlai Paratha was the best in the house. But last time I went there to order same Paratha and I got disappointed. Food is really unhygienic and full of dalda. Its Not like old times.

Mukharuchi restaurant, beliaghata
Location: exactly at alochaya bus stop. 
This is a non AC restaurant with plastic chairs and normal tables.. 
They do serve Indian and Chinese but the quality of the food is not good for health rather it's unhygienic.. 
They use bad quality of vanaspati for frying parathas and mughlai paratha which will stick on the upper pallet... Please change the quality ASAP..

Located at Alocchaya bus stop on the beliaghata main road. It's right on the side of the road,and can be spotted with ease.

A low costed eatery,with general Chinese food serving. 
The insides aren't as appealing, just plastic chairs and tables neatly put together with a large aquarium on one side.

The chicken momos here are a must have suggestion. Usually soups served with momos don't taste as good,but this place serves as an exception. The soup is equally chickeny and yummy. 4 pieces for 35. Not a bad deal!

Other than that, mixed fried rice and noodles are nice too. They contain egg,chicken,mutton everything for a price of about 100. 

The chilli chicken wasn't much to my liking. The gravy didn't taste as good.

Nothing exceptional but..
Give it a try if you pass by!

I think it is one of the low cost restaurants at Beleghata. It is located at the place which was formerly known as "Aalo Chhaya" .
Though the interior of this restaurant may not be impressive enough for one's eyes but the food is good -- both quality and quantity.
We often go there and usually order Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Chaap, Chicken Kasa. I also tried Egg Fried Rice. Not bad.
In the menu the price of both Chicken & Mutton Biriyani is printed Rs. 120 but chicken biriyani is less by Rs. 10

The Mutton Tikia is awesome here. You can also try Mutton curry. The Chinese dishes are also good. Try Mutton Tikia with rumali roti. The Tandoors are new added here.

It is like my para restaurant. I am going here since childhood. I am the common face of the restaurant.
Biriyani is really good. mixed rice is full of mutton chicken & egg and prawn. MoMos are awesome. overall good. pocket friendly also.
