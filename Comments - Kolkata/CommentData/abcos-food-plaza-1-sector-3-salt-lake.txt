We went for team lunch this Wednesday and it had been a mouth watering experience for us. We had been lucky that we went during Turkey festival and we ordered the Roasted Turkey. It was superb.
For Ilaichi Ran they have changed the item a bit( like earlier the whole leg piece would be there and less of vegetables and biriyani rice). That tastes great still but I would prefer the earlier preparation. Tandoori chicken was not up to the mark and it was kind of dryish(it wasn't stuffed either).
Salt and pepper chicken and Adraki Mutton was good too.
The stuffs are courteous and the ambience is perfect for family or office team outing.

We went here on a Sunday.. Got a table easily
The ambience was nothing special, the food was okay okay 
We ordered chicken hara dhaniya kebab, chicken tandoor, chicken tikka masala, tandoori roti and fresh lime soda(I liked) 
We had to go here as this is the only restaurant nearest to carnival cinemas and we had a movie to go to right after lunch.

The ambience was good. So was the taste of the items served. However, the waiters took too long to respond to the requests. Apart from that the food items were served 45 minutes after we placed the order. Overall I'd say it's an okay place to pay a visit!!!

Enjoyed the Elaichi Rann here again after nearly three years. And boy am i satisfied !! I always lowwee the veggies and pilaf served along with the succulent and flavorful mutton in the platter. Liked the patiala chicken too among other appetizers and sides ordered for todays lunch. Only liquid diet for my dinner today !! And no regrets ;)

The restaurant is located right behind Columbia Asia Hospital in Sector 3 with ample space for car parking. Have been here several times and was never disappointed with the quality of food or the service. The restaurant is on the Ground floor as well as the first floor. The ambience is good and sufficient space for dining is available.¬†
The restaurant serves excellent Chinese food at a very reasonable price. The quality and quantity of the food are good.

For our starters, we had Vegetable Wanton, which was nice and crispy. The Wantons were well prepared and served with a combination of sweet and spicy sauce. We relished the entire dish.

Then we placed an order for salt and pepper prawn. Now, the taste of this dish is subjective. While I savoured the prawns, which were non-spicy and juicy, my friend found it to be extremely bland and uncooked. Recommended only for those who are fine with prawns lightly tossed with salt and pepper.

Then came our main course i.e. Grilled Bhetki with Lemon Butter Sauce. The Bhetki fish was nice and tender and the vegetables were grilled properly too. This was served with lemon and butter rice. The taste of butter and lemon had blend very well and we savoured the dish.

Lastly, we enjoyed the prawn Cantonese Noodles. The Noodles were steaming hot and did not even require any side dish.

The restaurant has a wide variety of dishes prepared here. The quantity and quality are outstanding with prompt service too. We always enjoy our dinner visits to this place and look forward to many such evenings.

One of the oldest restaurants in saltlake, very easy to locate, behind Columbia Asia hospital. 
Quite specious, with comfortable sitting arrangement. Service is prompt & quick. 
We have ordered their signature dish - elaichi raan which contains polao, 750 gms boneless mutton, salad, boiled vegetable & some gravy. This is enough for atleast 4 people. Other things we ordered - lasooni naan, sliced fish with green chilli & spring onion, full murg tandoori, 4 fresh lime soda. This food was more than enough for 5 of us.  All of these were tasty as well. Not much high in pocket too. Total pocket pinch was Rs 2245 including taxes.

Used to visit here quite often during 2008-2011. Visited again after a long time and was readily struck with nostalgia. Coming to the main deal the food. Things didn't change much. Still they are good at what they were always good. The Elaichi rann is a must try. All the starters we choose were very good too. Tried fish n chips (the mayonnaise a la Maison it comes with is a real attraction). Ordered a kebab (can't remember the name. But the picture is being uploaded here) and also a dish of dry chilli chicken. Nothing to complain about. We also ordered, as I said, the experience for me being a nostalgic one, a dish of kasha mangsho (boneless peices of succulent mutton in a traditional Bengali thick curry) and a plate of luchi (it comes with 6 peices of quintessential Bengali fritters made out of refined flour and deep fried in vegetable oil). It was a lot. But we were a group of 6. Coming to the desserts, a special mention should be made of the chocolate brownies with ice cream. For those having sweet tooth and are not averse to ice cream, this is highly recommended

We have dined a almost 4/5 times at Abcos. For most of the time, one item was common... The Elaichi Raan!

One can say it's the north Indian reply for Sizzler. ( Though served in a normal plate & not in a sizzling plate).

But, for me; it's a full course North Indian meal for 3 hungry souls within 1k (RS. 950/- to be exact). 

It consists of flavored Pilaf rice; strips of boneless mutton , cooked to perfection with the mild aroma of Elaichi, toggling with your taste buds & sauteed (well, actually cooked) veggies prepared in Indian masala!

The taste of the items were complementing each other perfectly.

A recommended item for the mutton lovers!

Abcos Food Plaza is one of the oldest & most popular restaurants in Salt Lake . It is located just behind the Columbia Asia Hospital & beside the Big Bazaar ( both of which came up much later than Abcos ) in Sector 3 . Though we used to be regular visitors of this place but today was our first visit after a considerable period of time . Each storey of Abcos has a different name & the capsule lift with outside view was a big attraction for us . Today we were seated in the first floor which is called Kipling Klub . The interior is neat & clean while the staffs were attentive to our requirements . Coming to the food tried the following :
Wanton Chicken Steamed : This was especially for my little son who is fond of Steamed momos / dumplings / wantons etc but he did not enjoy the dish today . It contained 8 pieces of wantons but the chicken stuffing was a bit tough to our liking .
Elaichi Rann : This is their signature dish . It contains rice , vegetables & boneless mutton pieces . The dish is a huge one & easily serves three people . We were only two & it was more than enough for us . The mutton pieces were really soft & not much chewing was needed to eat them . The rice was of good quality & flavour . The boiled vegetables complemented the rice & mutton of the dish . They also serve mutton gravy in a separate bowl . As the dish is heavily spicy it is difficult to consume it in large proportion & it is better to be enjoyed with a group .
We had planned to try their Baked Alaska but were too full to try out anything after Elaichi Rann so decided to skip it today .
Overall a satisfactory experience .

Ambiance is not quite great considering a lot of options in and around salt lake now. Price is a bit high considering the ambiance and service(service needs to be improved. staff's behavior is a big let down).¬†

The biggest plus being the taste of most of the food items here are still good. My favorite is Pen and Ink and the soups over here is a must have when ever u land up at this place.¬† (all the soups are tasty but my fav is sweet corn).

Visited this place on Nabami with family,  since we wanted a place that served multiple cuisines,  and Salt Lake isn't a place we are well versed with. Ambience here is okayish. We were asked to visit the 2nd floor restaurant. We had Chilli baby corn and some shredded chicken dish,  name of which I can't recollect. Both were pretty good. Next we ordered their famous Elaichi Raan.  I think it's a hyped dish,  I found it pretty average. Servers were polite. 
Overall I didn't find the place too impressive. I won't be a paying a visit to Abcos anytime soon.

First off the Brownie wasn't a brownie. It tasted more like a regular packeted cake, drizzled with chocolate sauce. We had to send it back. Also chicken preparations are not that good. The fish tikka and fish finger were good. Also the run was good although I failed to understand why there is so much buzz around this dish. Also the environment and ambience were not family friendly. The staff also displayed inefficiency and the food arrived much later than it should have.

Behind Columbia Asia hospital, the Abcos food plaza covers 4 floors. We had lunch at Pen and Ink on the 2md floor and had a great time. We had the legendary Elaichi Rann, Tandoori Chicken kabab, Fish & Chips (the best I have ever had), cheese naan & chicken tikka curry. We had their variety of mocktails and Baskin Robbins Honey & Nut ice cream. Each & every dish was awesome and the overall cost was about ‚Çπ900 per person (We availed 12% corporate discount) Hope to visit again soon.

Chicken was hard in Chilli Kebab.¬†Then came the legendary Elaichi raan. My words even fall short in front of this sumptuous grandeur of culinary marvel. Veg items were just ok. Makai Jalfrezi was pathetic and 1 mark less is for that only. Overall a must go for mutton (raan) lovers.

We recently organized a dinner party at Abcos for 60 people. The food and service were great. Also we were provided with a completely separate floor for the private party.

The menu was a buffet which we had customized our self. It was also reasonably priced. Everyone at the party enjoyed the food and the ambiance. I have visited this restaurant several times in the past and tasted their ala-carte items which are great. This is the first time I have had a buffet arranged and they have maintained their high standards in this as well.

Great place to conduct such private parties. We had contacted several other restaurants as well but no one was providing a separate area for us (they were only reserving a few tables and wanted us to share the common buffet). It was only Abcos that provided us with a separate floor and also arranged and decorated the place as instructed by us. The service was also very professional and prompt. They were serving the food very diligently and no one had to wait for the food.

I would highly recommend this place to everyone and hope to have such parties in the future also.

Abcos food plaza has four restaurants.  We tried the one named O Calcutta. We had North Indian cuisine and Biryani. The prices are quite reasonable and the food is simple and good.  Nothing great,  but good enough for a simple family dinner on a normal day. Being from Hyderabad,  the biryani land,  I won't comment on the biryani at this place as my opinion would be biased,  but overall a decent place.  Ambience is okok, however lights are too dim I feel.

Serving is also amazing.
Only downside was there were metal glasses and ceramic plates.... Didn't understand the reason for that.

Food is good but the service is very poor. My family went to eat there and they were not able to finish a dish which they ordered.
Instead of wasting the food we requested to pack the left over however the waiter very rudely said that they typically do not pack left over food and after repeated request reluctantly they did the same.
This unprofessional behavior is not expected from a reputed restaurant like ABCOS. Everywhere across the globe restaurants encourage their customers to carry their leftover food to prevent wastage and here there is one who is trying to reinvent the wheel.
They must train their employees well to make them more aligned with more professional and courteous behavior.

A visit to this place after 10 long years made me feel nostalgic. Elaichi Raan is the dish which is so popular here. A large portion of Boneless mutton raan with saute veg and pulao rice can be easily shared by 3-4 people (priced @950/-). Chicken arabiana pasta could have been better. In starter we had chicken spring well and crispy chilli baby corn. Chicken spring rolls were juicy and tasty but baby corn was a let down, too oily and lacks taste. I have tasted far better baby corn in Opium, sector V. We tried variety of desserts, the best being crispy honey fried noodles with ice cream (also known as darsaan), house made gulab jamuns were good and so is tutty fruity, but a let down was baked alaska, which had raw flavour of egg and didn't like that. Overall good ambience and food. It charges 18% GST and no service charge. Note - corporate discount of 10% at dinner and 15% at lunch.

I have been to Abcos many times over the last 14 years! Have a special liking for this place as it's food quality was quite good. Recently I was there about a week back for an office lunch.
In terms of the interiors, the restaurant needs a revamp. It's been a long time since they would have had one. So their management should consider one. The seats, decor, etc should get a change.
Service is still good and the staff are polite. Their elaichi rann is still one of the best I have had. So kudos for that. Earlier I have had Kashmiri pulao and it was nice too. We tried several starters and they were good. However, they served fresh lime soda which tasted stale and smelly. This was surprising as it's a simple drink which doesn't require much expertise to prepare. The waiter changed some of the fresh lime sodas and then those were tasting good. They said it was due to the sugar syrup, which must have been stale and expired, without which such a bad taste was difficult. Desserts was also good. We tried gulab jamun, ice cream, etc.
Of course I must mention that they provided a pick up and drop in a 14-seater vehicle. That is a big plus.

We made the mistake of ordering chinese..mixed fried rice, kung pao chicken, schzewan chicken and pan-fried fish was the order..good part - service was good, quantities were okay, the chicken was soft and the food was hot..bad part - the taste..it was bad..even the sweet lime soda was too sweet..such a shame..

Been there multiple times. Quality of the food is uncompromised. Ambience is very good. Staffs are courteous. However dishes are a bit expensive. Drinks are too costly. Some of the must try dishes are Elaaichi Raan, Fish muniere. A chilled beer with Chicken Hawaiian salad is my personal favorite. I am deducting 1 star for pricing.

My husband had been to Abcos for an office dinner a few months back where he had liked the food. So he took me to the place for a lunch. But our experience this time was quite below average. A biryani festival was underway. We odered for gosht biryani, tandoori rooti and achari chicken. Apart from achari chicken none of the dishes were worth a mention. The biryani tasted like a variant of polou. It lacked the taste, aroma, look and feel of biryani. Then for desserts we ordered for baked Alaska. They took nearly half an hour to prepare it but then served it 'warm'. It did not taste good at all..... Having said that, the d√©cor is good, the staffs are well behaved and the place is quite reasonable.

We went there for dinner. Ordered fish and chicken tandoori , crispy chili baby corn, and paneer pakora. 
Original name was different and very fancy names but in reality you will get what I wrote in simple words. 
We were very disappointed with the starters which continued to the main course also. Eilachi Raan was also medium one. I would personally avoid this place. 
There are multiple good restaurants in salt lake and this is not a place to visit as per my experience.

1. Boti kebab 
2. Chicken hariyali kebab
3. Chicken badami kebab 

This place deserves special mention due to their speciality item Elaichi Raan.  It's must try which serves 3-4 people..  Go n grab it.

Abcos is a old establishment in Salt Lake situated at Sector 3 behind Columbia Asia hospital. Abcos is an independent building with a separately named restaurant at each floor and the rooftop.

Food:
The food in Abcos is reasonably good and they have a good spread menu. There are many items that are must have like Elaichi Raan, Fish Finger etc. For foodies Abcos never has been a let down. The recommendation will be to go for "Khas Hindusthani Khana".

Price:
This place is pretty expensive. Fish items are very expensive and with taxes will start above Rs 500.00. So the value for money is on a lower side.

Service:
The service is decent and waiters will be polite to explain you the specialties and recommend more expensive items. 

Parking:
They have some reserved parking and the guards will guide to that. Otherwise near the hospital there is provision for parking at a fee.

For what it's worth, the place has an excellent ambiance, be it the open air or not. Now coming to the food, I have to say I was satisfied. The drinks menu is long enough to choose from and complementing it, there are ample options to choose from the food menu as well. We had the crispy thread & the kung pao chicken and both were enjoyable. I had the Mexican chicken sashlik which I though was cooked well enough and from the little of what I tasted of the chicken tikka butter masala that my friends were having it was more than decent as well. All around, I would say the food was better than most places in the vicinity. Pocket pinch was also acceptable considering the location, ambiance, quantity and taste of food. However I would have rated it higher had it not been for a less than welcoming staff, who were pretty irritated with us taking 10minutes to leave after we were done and oh.... nobody else was waiting for a table. However disappointing it may have been, I would still give this place another go purely because of the food, considering this was an one off incident. But guys, do try to expand on your corporate tie ups

I have always been in love with abcos! I like their each and every dish! The ambience is quite nice. Abcos has been around for quite a long time now and I've been eating here since my childhood. But I have just one complaint that is the quality and taste of food has gone down over the years and the prices have increased over the years. I don't mind paying a higher price, but the food should justify it's price which it sometimes fails to do.

Well if you are looking for good food and a great ambience to relax then this is just the place for you.. Located just behind Columbia Asia Hospital, this place offers you a rooftop experience. We had ordered tangri kabab, chicken nuggets, mixed noodles and shanghai chicken. The food was tender and very tasty. And the service was prompt. I would just give it a 5 for the ambience and food.

Good ambience and service, food a bit costly.

Located near Carnival cinemas, this place has sitting arrangements across multiple floors and also has rooftop sitting which is really nice. Three of us went there for dinner during holi. We took seat on rooftop and ordered Roasted chilli Lamb and kung pao chicken for starters. Starter was promptly served within 15 mins and tasted good. For main course we ordered bbq chicken sizzler, mexican chicken sizzler and chicken stoganoff. All three were tasty and having good quantity. Total bill for three persons came around Rs 2200. They also provide separate car parking space. Overall we had a nice time.

The ambience is just the average one.. (look out for the elevator and the stairway..The look is pure classic!) We ordered a Chinese spread for a group of 23 people. The taste was just satisfactory, very ordinary but the bill came along as extremely extraordinary. The place seems too expensive for its spread. But if you are okay with the pocket pinch then this place is okay to give it a try!

Although Zomato lists this place as a single entity, it is actually a hub of 4 restaurants on 4 levels of a building all sharing a common kitchen.. Abcos has been one of the oldest restaurant hub in the Salt lake area and still a favorite to some of the old patrons from the locality.. Last time went a few months back to the 1st¬†floor restaurant in this place.. Ambiance is classy and beautifully done.. Elegant d√©cor and comfortable seating to make you feel at ease.. Service is usually flawless but during the busy hours the service may take longer.. The menu is actually quite extensive and exhaustive from cooking up some delectable North Indian Kebabs to Chinese spreads to even preparing some authentic Bengali dishes.. The food I sampled during our last visit:

Shoroter Coffee: This actually came up as quite an innovative cocktail.. Vodka, Kahlua and Honey mixed to perfection to present a great delight for the tongue.. The drink was strong enough to lit you up..

Murgh Shaslik Kebab: Ordered on the server‚Äôs recommendation and it tasted okayish.. Not much awe in terms of flavors and the chicken was a bit rubbery.. But overall not bad either..

Chicken Hakka Noodles: Portion was generous, only issue was it seemed a bit oily..

Lien Soon Chicken: Basically the unique name caught our attention.. Chicken cooked in a whitish gravy accompanied with sweet corn and capsicum.. Loved the garlicky flavor not attacking the taste buds..

Overall, it was a decent enough dining experience with not much reason to be going back but given the location and the prices charged, this is actually a better option if you feel like having some good food after watching a movie in Carnival Cinemas.. Our total cheque was Rs. 1229/- (all incl.) for 2 people..

Food: 3/5

Pricing: 3.5/5

Service: 4/5

Ambiance: 3.5/5

I heard about this restaurant from my friends and was very much excited to try their menus. I ordered chicken steak and lamb chops and both were so so. I was disappointed. There was large room to improve those steak and chops. Try once if you haven't tried it at all. Prices are fine but I don't think value for money. Please improve the quality and serve juicy and delicious food.

Overall ambiance is good. though the sound of the music was too high and that's unpleasant. The food quality was not up to the mark comparing with the price. Got heavily salted masala kulcha (and they changed it later). Rs ~450 for a hundi Mutton biriyani ...and we didn't like it at all... Though we like tandoori chicken and chicken Hawaiian salad...

You you have enough money to spare you may try once...after all your choice....

It was a quick and random plan to visit Abcos. Pen and Ink on second floor. The entrance looks nice as the ambiance inside is well maintained. 
Tandoori chicken was well prepared and was delicious. I expected Kashmiri naan to be more interesting but it was not. Biryani was well cooked and sufficient for one. I liked it more as there was no potato in it. üòâ 
The food was overall good. Price is a bit higher side for the quantity of food being served.

Review is longtime due from my side. Visited this place quite a few times with friends and office colleagues and never been disappointed. I always prefer to be on the Rooftop arrangement which is not only spacious and open air makes you feel good but another plus point is that u can smoke here while having your drinks.
Coming to the food, all of their dishes which I have tried throughout my visits are treat to my taste buds. One should try 'Elaichi Raan' which is their specialty, tender boneless mutton combined with white rice and steamed spiced vegetables (Can serve 2/3 easily).

Ambiance (Rooftop): Excellent
Service: Very good
Quantity: Too good
Quality of food: Awsome
Price: Reasonable
Recommendation: Elaichi Raan¬†

Overall a must visit to all food lovers.

A¬†few days back I was there for their newly launched ¬†Brunch that now has been started from 8th January. ¬†It was a nice wintery afternoon and I was there with fellow blogger duo Anindya and Madhushree, in fact, the invitation came through them. I was not aware that the restaurant actually belongs to a famous travel blogger. I didn‚Äôt even recognize Amrita over there who then shared that she is presently helping her father.¬† It was a bit different than typical bloggers meet we generally attend, as the invitation was restricted to a small group and two friends were not able to make for the day.

It was my 5th visit to Abcos.. This time Kipling Klub with my relatives who visited Kolkata on 31st December 2016. My relatives love to relish home cooked mutton. So I belive the best place  to satisfy our taste buds with mutton is having Elaichi Raan here. It's my favourite and my 3rd time. We also ordered Chicken Hawaiian Salad and that too is my favorite and perhaps it's the best salad preparation with chicken in Kolkata. Loved it. My relatives really enjoyed the lunch and praised the chef alot. Apart from food it has lovely ambience where we can come with family friends or colleagues on any occasions. Hospitality is brilliant too. Only a slight disappointment we had this time was with butter nan and chicken bharta we ordered. The butter nan was too buttery almost wet soaked with butter and the chicken bharta did not have any shredded chicken rather it was keema with taste of Chicken butter masala. This lunch could have been the top notch lunch we ever had but the butter nan and chicken bharta spoilt the show. Excluding these 2 items everything was amazing.

ABCO'S has been around for a while and a regular part of the food scene in salt lake. Food is always good and in all the years I've been there I've never had a problem. The flavour are good and the multiple areas and cuisines make it better. Sizzlers make it a bit smokey when they're served. The ambiance too is decent. Service can be a bit slow. Overall a good place to grab a meal.

Lemon butter sauce was amazing , u get to choose wither bread or rice along wid it. Comes in a sizzler platter and tasty. Chicken ala Kiev was not good at all. We had to complain the manager, they wanted to replace it but we preferred to let go off it. Caramel custard and hot gulab jamun was good and upto the mark. Overall fine.

Ambience -average since we got place in the ground floor
Quality - chicken Dian steak was cheesy,juicy steak with veggies with amazing taste
Barbeque sizzler was huge almost a full small chicken. Tasted good. Loads of veggie were given.
For dessert the brownie with hot chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream tasted okay
#Quantity- the best thing about the meal was it's huge quantity. More and more than enough for two people and sufficient for three.
The size of chicken they offer in barbequei sizzler is worth it's money and hard to find anywhere in Kol at that price
Even the dessert was more than enough in quantity.
Experience- very nice
Hope to visit soon

Heard that there was a Sizzler Festival going on at Abcos. So I kinda managed to convince my dad to take us to this restaurant. We had roasted drumsticks, which were more or less okay. They came with Mushroom sauce. Then we had grilled lamb chops in bechamel sauce which were pretty awesome. We also tried the penne pasta in red sauce. Nice to see that a seperate menu was made for this particular ocassion.

Salt lake has come up with various food joints and i really wanted to try this one. Well to start with, ambience is okayish but clumsy to a good extent. Service is fine but people taking orders are themselves confused when asked about any dish. Coming to the food, i liked the mocktails, well prepared and quite soothing. Had their methi jhinga pulao, little oily but tasty. Tave da gosht is good, succulent mutton pieces. Even the kebabs are well made. But the air conditioning is so bad i was waiting to finish the food and run off asap. Please rectify it, food is for pleasure, not punishment.

Hi
I had visited this place quite sometime back(4-5 yrs) with my cousins. After that I was out of town and returned to the city few months back. I remember we had a dish named Elaichi Raan. It was a fantastic dish and I relished the taste for a long time. We also had many more dishes but I only remember the name and taste of this dish. :)
Would be visiting the place once again very soon. Just one query. Do you people still make this dish?? if yes then it is available in which floor?? I remember there are different restaurants on each floor, but don't quite remember in which restaurant it was available. Kindly let me know. Will be visiting the place very soon with my family.

Abcos is one of salt lake's oldest restaurants . They are around for almost two decades. They have been maintaining superb quality. Ambiance is good with ample parking.

Though it looks cheap restaurant from outside but inside its nice. I liked the chinese delicacy lot here. Recommended to visit here if you wanna have some some good chinese starter with heavy drinks. Drinks price is very less and located so near to city center so, its easy to locate. Nice pkace to catch up in a group and get high

Heard that there was a Sizzler Festival going on at Abcos. So I kinda managed to convince my dad to take us to this restaurant. We had roasted drumsticks, which were more or less okay. They came with Mushroom sauce. Then we had grilled lamb chops in bechamel sauce which were pretty awesome. We also tried the penne pasta in red sauce. Nice to see that a seperate menu was made for this particular ocassion.

Salt lake has come up with various food joints and i really wanted to try this one. Well to start with, ambience is okayish but clumsy to a good extent. Service is fine but people taking orders are themselves confused when asked about any dish. Coming to the food, i liked the mocktails, well prepared and quite soothing. Had their methi jhinga pulao, little oily but tasty. Tave da gosht is good, succulent mutton pieces. Even the kebabs are well made. But the air conditioning is so bad i was waiting to finish the food and run off asap. Please rectify it, food is for pleasure, not punishment.

Hi
I had visited this place quite sometime back(4-5 yrs) with my cousins. After that I was out of town and returned to the city few months back. I remember we had a dish named Elaichi Raan. It was a fantastic dish and I relished the taste for a long time. We also had many more dishes but I only remember the name and taste of this dish. :)
Would be visiting the place once again very soon. Just one query. Do you people still make this dish?? if yes then it is available in which floor?? I remember there are different restaurants on each floor, but don't quite remember in which restaurant it was available. Kindly let me know. Will be visiting the place very soon with my family.

#Ashthami Lunch#   #Review for Kipling Klub#

The Abcos Building doesn't look good from outside but it's beautiful inside.
This is the first time I visited.
Firstly I would love to say that the staff was very very caring! 
On entering we saw that the restaurant (Kipling Klub) was full, only one table was empty and we got seated there.
The interior of the restaurant was a bit of old style but I loved it. It was kind of comfortable.
The service was fast. We got our order in 30minutes. Our order was huge! We were a group of four.

We ordered--

** Starters- Murgh Tandoori, Tangdi Kabab, Fish Fry, Salad, Lassi

** Main Course- Kasmiri Pulao, Mutton Kosha, Chingri Malaikari

**Deserts- Chutney, Hot Gulab Jamun and Chef's Special Papad.

The quality of food was excellent as well as the taste! Cost for four was around 5k.

Abcos is a must visit for foodies!
I am really impressed and will be visiting again. Next time I am gonna try Chinese.
Surely it will be delicious :-)

Moderate food quality,ample space,variety of Chinese and Indian served under the same roof- in a nutshell.
Didn't enjoy the Fish Bhunia.The fish was stinking and too filing for an individual.
I loved their signature,Mutton Elaichi Run.What tender boneless mutton pieces tossed with optimally steamed veggies,served with white rice.This is a must have.
      Their chicken fried rice is decent but their noodles aren't as per Chinese cuisine standard.Instead it's more like street food stalls.

A place to which I've made innumerable visits and generally rate high for food and service. Good taste and services had deteriorated in the recent past but has been partly restored now:

Service levels have improved, and Old Monk is back again as is Bira beer. Corporate discount and Happy Hours have also been started. Couple of suggestions from the management from a VERY regular patron

1) Please extend happy hours till 8PM on weekdays. Large part of your customer base are office goers in Salt Lake, who don't usually get free for a drink till 7.30pm, certainly not 7pm! The volume increase in footfall should more than make up for your discount.

2) Corporate discount and happy are provided by the management only to increase footfall. Staff, specially in the ground floor should be advised to encourage patrons to avail it, rather than behave as if a special undue favor has been asked, when a customer asks for this. Customers pay for the meals, it doesn't hurt to be a little polite!

I ordered chicken wonton and chicken dry fry.I love the ambience and food are excellent. Service is good but price is a bit high. They have a variety range of chinese dishes and have a authentic flavour of chinese . I highly recommend this resturant. Every one should go and try out specially who love chinese cuisine.

A great place to go to with family and friends or even to book for parties. The ambience is very cosy and yet formal albeit a little too dim. A big plus though is that they have their own parking space so yaay if you get there early!

The food here is yum! I would recommend the chilly mushroom dish and obviously the Elaichi Rann that it is so well known for... 

The Elaichi Rann is quite simply put a large tray of rice meat and vegetables cooked together and placed in a steaming hot heap.... its enough for at least three people with decent apetite.

Located in the lane beside the Columbia Asia hospital - each of the floors serve different cuisines like chinese,¬† mughlai etc. Ambience and service is good and rates are reasonable. Would recommend to try out their mughlai cuisine - elachi run which tastes brilliant¬† served with soft mouth melting pieces of mutton, saffron polao and a gravy.

Well,my experience with this place is very disappointing..I heard a lot about Abcos..Alas!I did not find anything much good to talk about..

I went there with my friend around 2.30P.M. on Sunday..No food was available there almost but restaurant was not closed at that time.. Whatever we asked,we got response like "it's not there/two plates are not available,you can get one.."

Finally we gave order for kebabs ,chicken biriyani and soft drinks..

Biriyani quantity was not enough as like it was the last plate.Taste was average.Kebab was bit better.

Serviece was too slow and annoying.We got food around 3.30PM.Stuffs are casual in behaviour.

Personally I did not expect this kind of service from Abcos.

Ambience is OK.

Sorry! But I will not recommend this place at all ....

I just like this place. Decor is classy so is the food. Just order a pint of corona along with Fish n Chips.
I guess they serve one of the top fish n chips in Kolkata.  Next beat thing to try here is the Elaichi Rann, but order only if you have 4 ppl in ur group and who are not on dietüòÇ. Try out the continental dishes, my fav Caribbean Chicken.
But just stay away from ordering Biriyani here, they just don't know how to make BIRIYANI. 

It is a costly place but sometimes you just need to go to a posh place to have a great time.

One of the good places in salt lake for a casual dining with family or friends or office colleagues. 
They have a good range of items on the menu, Indian, chinese, Thai and such. I would suggest to try the Kung pao chicken there. It's really good. About the setup, even though they r short of seating place, they have done real good job with it. The ambience is good with the music and the lights. The food is great. This place is worth more than a single visit.

Have been there around a month ago. It is in abcos food plaza. We were thinking to go to kipping club. But it was closed due to the timing. So we stepped down to The Pen and Ink. But we have got completely disappointed. Decoration was ok. The starter was also ok in taste. Then we ordered sizzler suggested by one of their stuff. And it was totally horrible in taste and it took too long time to serve to our table.  Overall it was a hopeless experience.

This restaurant is located just behind Columbia Asia hospital and a walking distance from Carnival Cinemas. After hearing a lot about this place, I thought to give it a shot. Me and my fianc√© visited this place on a Friday noon. Ambiance is ok ok. Not very attractive, but a bit quiet type. We had a plate of sislik kebab and Elaichi Raan. Kebab was fine. I won't say it was outstanding, but it was good. Elaichi Raan is their signature dish and believe me it was delicious. A plate is enough for 3 persons. Mutton was soft, as well as juicy and the combination with rice (part of the dish) made it just perfect. I was so full that I couldn't try any desert.
Price wise, it is affordable. Not cheap, but not costly either. If you are in a place near Carnival Cinemas or Columbia Asia, give it a try. You won't regret.

Turned up for dinner today after about 6 years. Amongst all that's changed the quality and taste of the food remains constant. It's pretty easy on the pocket and excellent quantity. We had the mutton  kebabs and chicken keema wrapped in egg for dinner. The tandoori Roti's were terrible though.

Abcos food plaza has been the heart and soul of every office party and family gatherings for many years now . It amazes me that this place has so less reviews , whereas this restaurant should be in the list of legendary places for sure . I am in IT sector for 5 years now and have been here almost 8 to 10 times now and each and every time it has been a wonderful experience .

¬∞ Location :- This restaurant is located at sector 3 . You will have to reach the Broadway Street where the movie hall Carnival cinemas is located . It is near to this movie theatre . The best way to come is from the beleghata connector towards the stadium , you will go straight and stop at the Columbia Asia hospital . The restaurant is located behind it .

¬∞ Ambience & Service :- It has a beautiful decor . It is basically a food place with a number of restaurants but with a common menu . I have mainly been at the Kiplings Klub, the ambience is stunning here . The staff is very well behaved and  very much skilled to serve a huge gathering single handedly. We have never had any complaints .

¬∞ Food :- Abcos boasts a wide variety of cuisines starting from mughlai , continental to oriental.  But it has always been the mughlai that has always fascinated us . The following are the regulars which we akways order here :- 

----------------------------------------------------------------
STARTER
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Chicken tandoori ( 5 / 5 ) :- The best chicken tandoori you will ever have .  And it is costly too.  Priced at 500 rupees for a full plate , the chicken pieces are huge . Yes they are humongous , and juicy and tender . Marinated and grilled to perfection.  This dish has always been our one and only choice for the starters . And because of the huge sizes of the chicken dishes they have always fulfilled our appetite . This goes absolutely heavenly with a peg or a mug of beer. 

----------------------------------------------------------------
MAIN COURSE
---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Kosha mutton ( 4 .5 / 5 ) :- oh yummy . Very few people are aware that abcos serves one the best mutton kosha dish in the city . It used to be a combo with luchi which is absolutely heavenly , but we came to know that they no longer serve the luchi in dinner . So you can take tandoori ruti or kulcha instead . Mark my words this will be the best mutton kosha you will ever had . 6 pieces of tender and juicy mutton is served hot . The kind of dish to win your heart anyday .

2. Masala Kulcha ( 4 / 5 ) :- Forget the kulcha from any dhaba . Have it from here and you will know the difference . They are so soft and stuffy . The stuffed masala is so yummy . These kulchas go hand in hand with any chicken or mutton side dishes but preferrebly the mutton kosha . 

3. Elaichi Raan ( 5 / 5 ) :- The main event . The dish for which abcos has won many awards.  The mighty elaichi raan. I don't have words to describe the dish.  This is that dish which has made me forget biryani . Priced at 950 this is good enough for 3 to 4 people.  The dish comprises of rice , sabzi and the mutton portions from.the raan ( leg ) . Trust me , the mutton is so soft it will literally melt in your mouth . And the flavour of the dish is so fabulous that you will love it . The mutton along with the veggies and the rice will be a heavenly experience for you . If you are food enthusiast and have not tried this dish then your food experience is incomplete. A must must have dish for all and especially the gosht ( mutton ) lovers .

----------------------------------------------------------------
DESERT
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Brownie with ice cream ( 4 / 5 ) ;- the brownies go excellent with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream covered in choco syrup.  An absolute delight . 

2. Baskin robbin special ( almond , hazelnut , kesar malai ) ( 5 / 5 ) :- You have to order this because they are simply outrageous.  Served 2 scoops along with a wafer , this is a personal favourite . 

----------------------------------------------------------------

Following points are to be noted , which I believe the x-factors of this restaurant and mind you it has a lot of x-factors :- 

1. Multicuisine , but mughlai is just out of the world 

2. The best tandoori chicken .

3. Home of the legendary elaichi raan .

4. Amiable stuff and elegant ambience .

5. Excellent for office party and family get-together .

I would request anybody who still have not tried an evening or lunch at abcos to just go there and have the dishes as mentioned above.  If not all , atleast have the elaichi raan . The drinks are a little on the costlier side as compared to others but that's just one of the very few cons that it has.

Abcos is one of the few restaurants I visited in my early days as an IT professional . The restaurant which amazed me with its splendid cuisines.  I have always regarded it as one if the best and I hope they will keep up the good work in the years to come.  A legendary eatery to me .

Food is good. Very well served. You may have to wait a little mainly at weekend evenings. The interior ambience is average. Visted a quite a number of times. The Long Island drink having 5 spirit is v.well made and would love to try it again. Both chinese and mughlai dishes are avaialble here and both have a balance of taste neither bad nor extra-ordinary.

Though its a rooftop restaurant but i didn't get that feel exactly as i dropped in last Sunday. Somewhere a comparison was there back of the mind with blue & beyond. Dalhousi i felt bit congested with its not so comfortable seating arrangements & plants could have been placed differently.However the intention was to try their signature preparation elaichi raan.I would say the dish is bit overrated than actually what it is.Basically it comes in a oval platter & its a three layer meal in which about 400 gms of  boneless mutton chunks being served on a bed of mildly flavored rice & another bed of vegetables like cauliflower beans etc.Gravy is served separately in a container.Mutton shreds could have been little more juicy as i felt they were bit dry & chewee, the rice was fine & flavorful with cardamom & cashews,neither i have issues with vegetables. The portioning is actually ideal for 3-4 pax  with medium apatite & it is been priced accordingly i guess.The complete meal combination which i think the idea behind the dish is applaud able but having said so taste wise it  doesn't do any wonder.Also tried the very basic fresh lime soda sweet & salted but i'm sure the lemon juice was not fresh & thus it made the drink little bitter.People were hospitable & gentle only they refused to parcel the leftover which i did on my own by asking 2 containers on chargeable basis,though they informed that this particular dish cant be parceled but it was not convincing enough. Bon apetit

Abcos ‚Äì My First Glass of Whiskey  

I can never forget my first glass of whiskey ever at this lovely place called ‚ÄòAbcos‚Äô situated in Sector 3 of Salt Lake City dating back to 1999. Lot of changed since then. It is located behind Columbia Asia Hospital in Salt Lake and I have visited it recently on my visit to the home town couple of months back. It‚Äôs basically a 3 storey building where each floor houses a separate restaurant. Excellent Food Quality and is surely a Value for money

From Chinese to Bengali to Mughal to continental, you name it and Abcos have it. The name of the restaurants on various floors is different but you can choose anything you want from the menu. I really like the Mughali dishes here and prefer the rooftop which gives an amazing view.

In short it has nice ambiance, great taste of food to offer and so much variety. This restaurant is a good place for different food lover and service is also good. Though the price is on a higher side still a good bet to dine out when you are in Salt Lake.

Not sure why each of the abcos restaurants have different ratings because they have the exact same menus and the same chef, though their decors are different. Abcos building has 4 restaurants, each one a sperate floor. They offer a large variety from indian to chinese to continental, they have it all. With reasonable prices, sober decor and efficient staff this place has gained popularity in the salt lake are. I used to be a regular at abcos a few years back, and was quite fond of their North Indian dishes. Must Try : kababs, elauchi raan.

Wish them all the success in future!!

One of the most frequented restaurants of sector 3, abcos has created a mark for itself. Pen and ink is located on the second floor Abcos. I have been their more than once. Whenever I go to Abcos I ritualistically have their Elaichi Raan, and always I had an excellent experience with it. I also like their North Indian preparations. With a beautiful & sober decor, good service and excellent food the Abcos brand has stood out in Kolkata's food kaleidoscope.

Abcos is a multi storey eatery housing multiple individual restaurants. Kipling klub happens to be on of them. I have been here on numerous occasions but can never tell the way, coz the route is slightly convoluted. Its close to my office and a favourite food joint of my colleagues. The staff are well behaved. The place is clean. Interiors are nice, but not exquisite. Their food is realllllyyyyy delicious with okish price. Well one thing you must must must eat : Elaichi Raan. This is a dish for 2 men or 3 women with fairly large eating capacity. This dish is kind of like a biryani within lots and lots of mutton. They have also won awards for this dish. So if you are here and not trying the elaichi raan then its a shame!!

It is located near Kulraj Broadway in Abcos Food Plaza where you get a wide choice of cuisine on different types of restaurant in one building. We wanted to have chinese so we dropped in at Kiplin Klub. The interior does not have much decoration and the lighting is appropriate. In starters we had Diced Chicken in Szechwan Sauce, Lemon Chilli and Prawn Chilli, in main course Mixed Hakka Noodle which was served in Kadai. The dishes tasted really good and each had a flavour and aroma of their own. In drinks we had Beer & Breezer. The ambiance was very good. The staffs were polite and helpful. Overall good experience !!

Located on ground floor of abcos food court. Not very big restaurant but with good ambience to dine in. I reached after 2.30 so not many customer were present but still found service to be slow. Ordered there nimling fried rice and veg Manchurian , Manchurian was good but rice was very spicy.

Another member of the Abcos group of restaurants. Had visited here once long time back and ordered for an Elaichi Raan. Succulent pieces of mutton, more than sufficient in quantity. Went really well with the Naan. Managed to feed 3 of us easily. The pricing was quite decent then and hence did not burn a hole in our pocket.

This one is located on the second floor of Abcos Multi Cuisine Restaurant. Has same menu card to that of the other restaurants in this building. Had tried Biryani once here. I remember it being served in a steel 'haari'. The quantity was sufficient, but the taste was quite average. Must try, Chicken Ala Kiev!

Similar inputs as that to O'Calcutta, except this one is located on the top floor of Abcos and has an open area sitting arrangement. Try their Elaichi Raan or Chicken Ala Kiev! Do not forget to opt for their corporate discounts.

I have been coming here since the last 10-12 years, if not more. Located beside Big Bazaar (Which came up much after Abcos), this particular restaurant is more like a tiny mall divided into four floors with each of the floor portraying a different ambiance and has an individual name and identity of their own. The menu however, is mostly the same, with the food being prepared from a common kitchen.

I have mostly ventured into O' Calcutta, the restaurant hoisted in the ground floor. This particular venture isn't much spacious and hence may be an infringement to your privacy. However, the ambiance is quite decent and the people who come here to drink booze are usually well behaved. During my initial days, my favorites were the Chicken Pizza accompanied with a Chocolate Shake. The Pizza was probably priced between 100-150 and the Shake being price around 80, that is as far as my memory goes. The Pizza had sufficient cheese and a tasty sauce. The shake was a perfect companion, owing to its thick and rich consistency.

That was a time when commuting to this place, even if you were a resident of Salt Lake was quite difficult. Slowly the adjoining areas started to grow up and visiting here became more easy. During this long association, I began trying the other dishes they had to offer. Caribbean Chicken and Chicken Steak Diane are two prominent names I remember having tried under their Steaks category. Didn't like both much. The sauce lacked taste and the texture was quite watery. The Chicken portions were good in size but again lacked flavor. I have had better steaks elsewhere.

Their Chinese also is quite average and is quite overpriced. Same goes for their Indian Fare. I will not go into details since I had tried both these cuisines long time back for me to remember any intricacies, but I surely do remember none of these cuisines here managed to tickle my tastebuds or excite my senses. Coming to the best dish I like here, it would be the Chicken Ala Kiev. I have been having this dish since ages now and everytime I keep having this, I promise myself to come back sooner or later to have another.

Large and succulent piece of Chicken being coated in a crispy batter and containing loads of butter and garlic. Accompanied with mashed potatoes, veggies and french fries, this is one of the best dish they have to offer. I usually do not go for the veggies as much as I do for the mashed potatoes. Hands down, these guys make the best mashed potato I have ever tried. My usual order for take-away mostly happens to be 2 portions of Ala Kiev without any veggies and some extra mashed potatoes.

Another dish which one should try here, if you happen to visit in a large group is their Elaichi Raan. Although the prices has increased heavily in the last few years, this is a packed dish which is sufficient for the likes of four. Coming to their deserts, I had tried their Pan Cake once, which was again okayish. Nothing to boast about.

These guys happen to have a free pick and drop service if you come in a group. They also offer corporate discounts. Besides, they have their own card which you can get for Rs. 500/- which gives you a 15% concession over food. Not to forget, the shoppers stop first citizen card, which also makes you eligible for a 15% concession if you food bill comes up to a minimum amount of Rs. 1500/-.

Bon Appetit!

Abcos is my all time favorite for office parties.
We usually throw the parties here for the pocket friendly prize and food variety.
Elachi Raan and Baked A laska is my all time favorite.
Their non veg items are unique with new chef varieties.
Staffs are good too .
Ambiance and location is good too.
Must visit restaurant in Salt Lake.

The Pen and Ink is one of those restaurants which seek to give you everything - decent but not overtly attractive ambiance, good food in large quantities, and one of the most extensive menu options you can find. I have been here several times just because it is decently done, has good food in a variety of cuisines, and while not very pocket friendly, but reasonable enough at times (at least for college students).

Three restaurants on three different floors with most probably a common kitchen in a nicely decorated building with comfortable and sophisticated setting. The Elaichi Raan is quite popular amongst meat lovers and you need not order anything else because of the quantity. Do visit.

With lots of room and good ambience, it is the most cozy portion in Abcos food plaza. Being located at a walking distance from my residence, I have been there numerous times, and each time I was amused. From staffs to foods, everything is fine (fine means seriously good).. But.. Most of the time they couldn't provide Tuborg.. Without only this dissatisfaction.. I strongly recommend to all.. If you are in salt lake.. Try this one...

Have been there as part of our recently organised office party. So the order was large and got to test their hospitality to a great extent.

Going by the location - behind Columbia Asia hospital, this establishment also houses a bar cum restuarent in the floor below this restuarent. It also provides car pickup services when a big group (30+) like ours visited there. 

They also accommodated us in their main hallway by bringing in all the chairs and tables side-by-side and that pleased as all as one point of time it seemed we were going to be spread out at different sections of the floor. 

Coming to the integral part of this review. Foods :-

We ordered the 
1) Elaichi Raan ( Huge platter of assorted Mutton [boneless] served with Naan and salad. Enough for 4)
2) Handi Gosht ( reminiscent to the chkn/mtn handi)
3) Mutton Achari Masala - Nice favoured Mutton and spicy, goes well with tandoori roti or butter Naan.
4) Nilgiri Khorma ( Boneless Mutton in thick brown gravy, mouth watering dish that will go well with people who doesn't prefer the spiciness)

In case you are wondering why all Mutton dishes - well this was free food and Mutton dishes costs higher üòÇ 

5) Murg Makhan Masala - Nice smooth gravy tastes well with keema naan.

Lastly the 

6) Murg tikka masala (we order 3 of these plates as they came with 6 boneless tikka kebab pieces of chicken and gravy and preparation was well versed with what the market leaders like Aminia, arsalan has to offer.)

With all these dishes we only ordered the Indian breads - Naan, butter Naan and Tandoori Roti, some us also opted for the Masala Kulcha and the Lachedar paratha.

For desserts - after all these thusing and thasing - we settles for a scoop of fried ice cream. I instead opted for the Baked A Laska enough for 4. Nice dessert and great presentation.....

All in all it was a nice experience for all of us, a formal setting perfect for a formal party!!!

This Food Plaza is situated just behind the Columbia Asia Hospital, Salt Lake. Its a multi-storeyed building, houses four different restaurants in separate storeys. I have been to Abcos-->Kipling Klub as a part of a Team Dinner with my colleagues. Being a part of a large team, we've had the chance to try several items among Chinese and North-Indian.
The ambiance was good, decor and seating arrangement was classy, lighting was a bit too dim... Talking about the food and service:
The waiters were cordial, I admit they handled our large group of 30+ people adeptly, although things got delayed, trying to coordinate.
STARTERS: hot BBQ chicken wings,
Sliced lamb, Kung Pao chicken
MAIN COURSE: fried rice, nanking rice, hongkong chicken, shredded chicken, naan, Murgh malai zaibunissa, murgh chatpata.

Most of the dishes were average to taste. Murgh zaibunissa, Chatpata and Kungpao were quite special.
None of us liked the flavor of Nanking rice.
Not a bad option for a classy dine-out.

Abcos Food Plaza my all time favorite. 4 storied, different floors different names but menu in each floor are the same. Ambiance is good, in food Lamb,¬†Kumb Pao Chicken, Golden fried prawns and a must try the legendary Elaichi Raan. Elaichi Raan is an awarded dish of Abcos ,one can easily see the award being framed in the walls while climbing up the stairs.
The Rann contains zeera rice , sliced minced mutton and mixed veggies which equally competes the mutton. The dish can easily be shared upon 3 people. You can get 10% corporate discount on drinks as well. In short it is a must go place at least for the Elaichi Raan.

I visited this place on a Sunday evening with my brother and a Close friend. And the reason we chose this place is because it's on the roof and we would be able to smoke in peace while our adda continues.
But the food was really great, and the cocktails were pretty well made. It was a great evening thanks to the very polite and efficient service and the atmosphere. 
I would heartily recommend this place to everyone in a similar mood for a cozy evening!

In Kipling klub, we ordered murgh patiala...the whole chicken Keema was wrapped in an omelette. It was lip smacking. Other starters were also superb including hara bhara kebab, murgh reshmi kebab, crispy chilly baby corn. Lovely evening. Thanks to Kipling klub.

This place is making their name in Kolkata by its own signature dishes. Located near columbia asia hospital, just besides bigbazar/carnival cinemas. I have been there for 4 times and every time they are just as good as always. I specially visit this place to taste their very own signature dish - Elaichi Raan. I don't think it is available to any other restaurant in Kolkata. It contains loads of mutton with sabzi and fried rice and 1 plate is more than enough for 2. They also serves mutton kasha gravy along with this. people who loves mutton should try it out, it is bit different yet delectable. The ambiance is pretty good and so is the staff.

I went to this place very recently. The experience was not at all pleasant. I've had high expectations from this place as the ratings are all good. I visited with a large group of office colleagues for a treat. The serving time was exceptionally high. It is not at all expected. We literally had to wait 15 to 20 minutes for starters and main course separately. The food was nice and we asked for desert that can be served very quickly as we were already late for office. Then came an incredibly bad caramel custard. The caramel was burnt, black in color and extremely bitter. We asked the waiter immediately and his response was very rude. He said that this is supposed to taste like this only. Never in my life I've had such a bad caramel custard. I'm extremely dissatisfied with their service. I'll probably avoid this place in future.

I always prefer to have the continental dishes.. their sizzlers are a special mention, specially the bar b q chicken sizzler, served with bread or rice as per your order. Try out the elaichi rann, its one of a kind :) They also have a rooftop restaurant called dalhousie, in the same building try visiting it in pleasant weather.

The ambience is pretty good and so is the staff. We had ordered Fish Muniere and it was indeed finger liking good true to the expectation. The elaichi Raan though a bit costly @ 950 INR is probably the best. The quantity is huge and you need 3-4 people to finish it. the meat is very well cook and soft. the vegatable and the rice compliment it pretty well. We had ordered some crispies which were very good indeed. Overall a great place for food enthusiasts
Visited the place the 2nd time.¬†This time didn't order the Raan and Fish muniere. We ordered chilly kebab. The meat was hard and blant¬†. For the main¬†course had butter naan, kulcha, tawa chicken and handi gosht. trust me never had such shitty food in a proper restaurant. The handi gost was tasteless with burned smell though the meat was soft. No diffence¬†between butter naan and plain naan !! an please dont talk about the kulcha :(¬†¬†. this staff is couteous but pathetically slow in service

But Pineapple Raita was dilute, not up to mark.BTW happy with the other items we opted for.

The Konjee Crispy Chicken was too much crispy. The Fried Rice tasted delicious and so did the Chicken in Oyster Sauce. The chicken dishes were tasty but need to be improved a bit more. The overall service time and ambience was pretty good. The food was quite cheap as well. And, it is a good place to go have food along with a gang of friends.

Rooftop sitting, ambience is decent. Very dark difficult to read the menu, mosquitos, and people smoking.

Menu is quite comprehensive, we ordered hara bhara kebab. Must say the best I had in my life. It was stuffed with succulent cottage cheese. Brilliant melt in the mouth preparation.

But the Mexican sizzler was a downer, the cottage cheese was rubbery and the taste was weird. The French fries with it weren't crispy and felt almost rubbery to chew. After the hara bhara kebab the expectation was built up so high.

However, the mouth freshener with the bill was again amazing.

I took a star away each for the sizzler and ambience. May be this place deserves better. But they need to be consistent.

I went to Abcos the other day to have lunch. Ambience is quite good but I must say the service really needs improvement. We took fish muniere at starter and that is a must try if you go there. Though if you compare the same dish with Peter Cat Abcos would lag behind. In the main course we had mahi biriyani and Elaichi Raan. Both are their speciality dishes and ensures you would give a return visit. We had sizzler as well and that is so so. You can skip the sizzler. In total a nice family restaurant provided the service is improved.

Abcos Food Plaza is a four storeyed building, where each storey is assigned to a food joint, which is self owned by Abcos.
It is easy to locate; falls exactly behind Carnival Cinemas near Big Bazar.
Dalhousie Celebrations is Abcos' terrace restro-bar. Decent ambience. Above average service. Great food. Drinks with limited choice.
Chicken Tandoori was properly marinated and brilliantly cooked. The tenderness of the chicken mingled very comfortably with the injection of spices. We also ordered King Prawns cooked coconut milk. It didn't turn out to be great choice.
The pick of the day was Ealichi Rann, rice based mutton preparation that happens to stand out from the rest. Put it down as a must order.
p.s. They provide corporate discount as well as allow you to smoke on the terrace, while having your drink on the table, as it is open air providing outdoor seating.

Ordered 2 plates of Mutton Elaichi Raan as have heard much about it and truly speaking was amazed at the taste, quality and quantity (Trust me as I am a mutton lover and still 5 of us could not finish the two plates). The mutton was really tender and awesome to taste. The rice was good too with a elaichi flavor and aroma.¬†
The drinks are also moderately priced and it was a bonus to the pocket.¬†

All in all a really nice experience and will surely visit there again!!

Infact first time we visited, we had no idea what elaichi raan was. So wanted to order more items with elaichi raan. But they suggested elaichi raan would be enough for 2 people and not to order any more. So happy with the staff behaviour as well.

Visited the place with friends. Ambiance was good. The food were delicious and also the quantity was very impressive. We had Reshmi Kebab for starters nd Elaichi Rann, Chicken tawa in the main course. The service was great. Waiting time was very less. The price is a tad costly but compared with the quality and quantity, it is justified

Went there yesterday for dinner with family and friends. Ordered fish n chips, tandoori chicken for starters and Biriyani, American chopsuey and a mixed grill sizzler for main course. Finished with an icecream sundae.
Beautiful ambience and good food though a bit overpriced which is balanced by the nice decor.

Roof top restaurants have always been my favourite specially when its a hang out time!!!And Abcos's roof top restaurant provides an excellent ambience for a proper roof top dining!!! With dim lights and soft instrumental and artificial fountain and fauna!!!Coming to the food...since we were a big group..we ordered many varieties of starters which includes Five spice chicken,Chicken Alakiev,Crispy chilly baby corn,American corn salt n pepper,golden fried prawn and fish tikka!! I would say if you are looking out for something out of the box taste..then you will surely be disappointed.The corn was fried till burnt and the fish tikka was an average.The main course dishes were also just average!!! The elaichi raan..which is their top preparation was unavailable that day.The staff's were less attendant!!! Overall the food quality and the staff's behavior got camaflouged under the ambience and the big office group!!!But this is one time go kinda place with prices on the reasonable side!!!

We were seated in Dalhousie, as the Kipling Klub didn't have sufficient space for a group as large as ours. Its the rooftop seating space in the Abcos Food Plaza. The ambience is no doubt remarkable with dim lighting, light music and cool breeze whizzing around.

The food though was very poor in contrary to what we had expected based on our last visit. The chicken seemed to be stale and the taste was poor. The Kabuli Naan also was very rough and lacked taste. The starters were good. We enjoyed Crispy Chilly Babycorn, Salt and Pepper American Corn, Chicken Five Spice, Fish Peshawari Kabab, Golden Fried Prawn & Chicken A La Kiev. The main course was Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Jhalfrezi with Naan which as mentioned, was not good at all.

The service was not good either; some of the waiters really lacked the sense of courtesy and at times appeared to be very agitated and restless.

Totally disappointed, I am pinning it at a 3 just based on the starters.

Few days ago I visited the restaurant. As soon as you enter the cleanliness and nice ambience soothes your eye. We ordered vegetarian food. The starters were excellent. I am very choosy about crispy baby corn and I must say this restaurant lived up to my expectation. The main course was excellent. In dessert baked alaska is something extraordinary one must try. It was full of innovation and unique taste. The quantity of food was also good. Dishes were more than enough for 2. Would love to visit again and again.

I have been to Abcos quite a few times but hadn't reviewed it yet. Went again last week, we were in the mood for some beer and this seemed like a good option. Nice location, good ambience and service. Not a lot of beer options but we got something decent to drink and some appetizers. The Mushroom Kung Pao was great but very spicy, which works for me. People who can't handle their spicy food might want to take their advice before ordering.
The crispy chilli baby corn was not that great, it was somewhat unevenly cooked and not coated properly.¬†I have not had their Indian food but their Chinese is pretty good and I think its a good option specially after a movie at the nearby theatre.

This is one of the best places to eat in Salt Lake. Not very expensive. Ambience is quite nice - well lit and spacious. Do not forget to try their chilli lamb and Tangdi kebab. Also, this is one of my favorite places for Biriyani- try the Handi ones in Chicken/ Mutton. On weekends/ holidays do try to plan your lunch or dinner in advance or be well prepared to brace the long wait in the queue outside.

Abco's has been a Salt Lake food institution since long. I had an opportunity to visit the place recently after a long time. The service and the food quality has been maintained at a good standard. Though the menu is non-veg heavy, pure vegetarians like myself will have no problem in finding food of our choice. Overall a good value for money place

Because I am a gr8 lover of sizzlers.... went these reputed restaurant in salt lake for having there sizzlers.... there are four restaurants and bars in the building named Abcos... and they serves sizzlers in ground floor ( O' Calcutta) and top floor ( Dalhousie celebration)  restaurants.... so with out any delay odered mix grill sizzlers and a mocktail litchi fizz.... mocktail was good... but l don't like there sizzlers.... they serve it with rice.... the panner was not tasty... where as the prawns are under cooked... french fries were smelling oily.... only the mutton, chicken and egg saved the dish and also the overall dish was very dry... also the cost was very high as comparison with other restaurants serving sizzlers in the city.... I may be wrong as my fellow foodies giving such good ratings.... so I decided to give another just some day.... the deco was very good..... service was also pretty ok.... the staffs are a little untrained.... pocket pinch was high....

We dined at the ground floor of abcos food plaza which is named as o Calcutta. There was a long queue as it was saptami night but luckily we managed to get a sit for four of us. 
The ambience was good with all the tables completely filled up and smells of food overwhelmed the room. We ordered chicken tangri kebab and crispy chilli babycorn for starter. We enjoyed both. Then for main course we ordered masala kulcha,sabzi handi,Kashmiri polao,murg acahri masala and pineapple raita. Whenever there are some veg people with us we always ordered sabzi handi and it never ceases to entertain us with its great taste and this time was no different. We also liked the sweet taste of Kashmiri polao and the awesome pineapple üçç raita. What we did not like is achari murg , the taste of achar does not go well with the chicken in our taste buds. 
However the overall experience, serving time was good amidst of so much customer.

Coming over to the fooding, it was not that great either as the starters were only good. Main course was simply average and they don't even know how to cook biryani. It tasted as if we were eating just a simple rice with no taste at all. Overall I would suggest that it's surely a one time visit only for me.

Visited this place couple of days back during the pujas. It is located on the first floor of Abcos. We ordered some mixed fried rice, chicken chowmein, hong kong chicken and a salt and pepper chicken. The rice was horrible. It tasted weird and felt like the cook was confused or something. The chow was still better. The hong kong chicken was rather tasteless. The salt and pepper chicken was the saving grace here.
Heard a lot of good things about this place previously, but don't if it was the puja time rush or what, it was definitely not what you'd call value for money. 
When you spend a certain amount of money, you expect a standard of food to back it up. That certainly did not happen here unfortunately.

This restaurant happens to be in the same building that goes by the name of Abcos Food Plaza.
Being a resident of the township for more than a decade,this is one place that has gained tremendous popularity over the years.
Located right behind the National University of Juridical Sciences,this getup and decoration of the building is good and very neat.

The interiors are well spaced and the walls are adorned with the various credits people have given,for the food being served here.
The staff are very polite and courteous and they have a tremendous capability to manage huge crowds.

If you target the bar,then you get a plethora of cocktails and drinks that can be served.
But apart from this what makes this place stand out is the quality of food being served.
From Indian to Continental,the dishes served here bear a fantastic taste.
You have kebabs,sizzlers,Biryani and various chicken and Mutton dishes from where you can choose.

Since me and one friend went on a dry day we opted for a dish by the name of Elaichi Raan.
The dish comprises of boneless lamb meat served with butter rice,salad and a vegetable curry.
It is indeed a speciality of this restaurant and many a people have simply loved this place for this particular dish.This dish can easily satisfy the appetite of two people.

On the finishers you have good mocktails from where you can choose.Prices are a little on the steeper side,but the food they serve really deserves a 5/5.

Being a very old customer of this restaurant,I'll give it a 4/5,the price being a factor here.
But if you look at rest of the things,I'm sure this restaurant will always be in your good books.

The Kipling Klub is one of the franchisees housed inside Abcos's building.
This place is a splendid selection for a Bengali's home-away-from-home experience in the department of food.
The interior is chic, contemporary and tasteful. The arrangements of walls and lights are complimentary to each other.
Since my whole family had happened to visit this place, everyone ordered items of individual choices. So there were Chinese, Bengali and North Indian dishes on the table. But patently, we wanted to taste everything and hence took in bits from every platter.
Despite having ordered the Noodles for myself, I think the Bengali items were the most delightful. I loved the way they had cooked all the various fish items. They really took a lot of care in handling the cooking of fishes, as fishes when fresh tend to be soft. Hence while cooking, it is mandatory to cook them with extra vigilance and care to avoid serving an ignominiously over-cooked fish that may unfortunately invite grimace.
The restaurant is fine. The service there is very good, ambience is calming and the food even if is a bit pricey, will gratify your palates. I think it will be a good decision to try out this place with your family indeed this Durga Puja!

I am really confused about the naming of this restaurant at the second floor of the abcos food plaza near salt lake big bazaar. But, the food quality and prices are good. Being very close to my workplace, I have dined there numerous occasions. Last night, we had a beautiful dinner there.
We ordered sabzi hare ghare kebab and tengri kebae for starter's. Sabzi hare ghare kebab was beautifully cooked, felt tender in mouth with the right amount of spices although I am not quite satisfied with the tengri kebab. Then in the main course, we have ordered tandoori kulcha, cheese nun, Kashmiri polao, sabzi handi and mutton hari mirch. Cheese nun and mutton hari mirch was awesome. I also loved Kashmiri polao. Tandoori kulcha was not that soft and sabzi handi was ok type. Overall we had a good dinner at a reasonable cost.

Located behind Columbia Asia Hospital this is a nice place for a dinner with friends or family. The open sky is your ceiling and the stars looking down..all go to provide a different experience. The hospitality is excellent. They have variety in what they serve. We did order many items like Roasted lamb chilli ,Murg Shaslik kabab and Tandoori Jhinga. Roasted lamb chilli was excellent but Tandoori jhinga was not up to the mark. The lamb was quite soft and easily melts in the mouth. The problem with Tandoori jhinga was that it was probably overdone due to which it left a bitter taste in the mouth. For main course we ordered Elaichi Raan. This turned out to be the highlight of the evening. The dish is good enough to satiate three people. Large portions of well cooked lamb are served in this dish, with vegetables and fine rice.I would certainly suggest that everyone visiting this place should check this dish out at least once....you will not be disappointed. Mixed feelings for the pocket pinch....I certainly think that Tandoori Jhinga is overpriced whereas Elaichi Raan justifies the price tag.
A mention for the washroom....one small makeshift washroom does no wonders for the image of a place as nice as this one...the management should look into this. The rooftop restaurant should be able to provide the amenities as those on the lower levels.
Nice place...good for a dine out.

I never got the chance to visit this restaurant, but I have had their food items, on home delivery. 

We had ordered, Murgh Tikka Masala and Butter Naan. The Butter Naan looked and tasted similar to Laccha Paratha, but the Murgh Tikka Masala had the perfect blend of spices and was finger licking good. Apart from these two items, we had to order their signature dish, Elaichi Raan, which is a unique preparation of Biriyani Rice, Mutton Curry and Sauteed Vegetables. This dish is awesomely delicious to taste and a plateful can be ordered for 3 people. 
The mutton pieces were succulent, with no bones, very tender to eat, and the gravy was very spicy and delightful.

Would recommend this place, and their signature dish to all who visit this food joint, situated inside the Abcos Food Plaza.

This place is located near the Salt Lake big bazar. You get a good feel as you gradually climb up the winding stairs. You will find the ambience soothing.

As this was an office party, a lot of dishes were ordered - some that i dont even remember the names of :-P
To be precise, i found each and every starter they served delicious - even the lamb. This place serves the best chilly baby corn i have tasted. The service is slow.
It was the main course that could not meet my expectations especially after having given a great start. They made a mess out of the bhetki - it was not tasty and lacked salt. The chicken dishes were too spicy. The mutton was awesome. +1 for that.
Gulab jamuns have been a long time favorite and I am too biased to cite any negatives on the jamuns! However, the brownie cake they served was a bit too bitter than usual.

Ambience - 3.5

Abcos is one place in salt lake where food will never disappoint u. This was my umpteenth time there and I craved for continental. Now few of my friends wanted sizzlers which was only served at ground floor. It was my first at the ground floor, o Calcutta! The decor is nice n cozy, a big TV n an upstair arrangement to house more ppl.the lighting was yellow n soothing n ambiance was friendly. We ordered, pepper chicken, chicken Diane n chicken Caribbean. It did take almost 25 mins for all three to adorn our table at once. But we had fun talking n watching a movie on TV.
Coming to their continental delicacies, wallah!! Beautiful n yummy!! All three dishes though hadcsame basic ingredient, the chicken, tasted remarkably different. I personally loved carribean chicken. Mind you about portion sizes here. The chicken breasts served are huge!!! Even if u are really hungry its quite a task to finish your dish. Especially if u happen to finish the soft bun with butter which is accompanied with every continental dish. Also the french fries and saut√©ed buttery veggies. It's too much for one person!!! I insist any continental food lover to go and give it a shot here and am sure they will thank me.
The pocket pinch is 350+tax per dish. And if u don't know yet, they have free parking space as well n a bar too.so enjoy if u drop in without worrying at all!!

Elaichi raan is the signature dish of Abcos and it is really great in taste! The dish is served in a long tray-like plate, one side is the rice and the other is the boneless mutton pieces along with the mixed vegetable. The mutton pieces are very soft, well cooked with good spices. Warm soft spicy pieces of mutton just melted in the mouth! We had crispy chilli baby corn as starter. Every piece of baby corn was crispy and tasty, with a smell of garlic in the sauce! Overall a very nice experience!

The ambiance here is awsome. Though they serves hard drinks but one who does not drink will face no problem here as everything is so well planed. The food quality is very good service is always up to the mark. The price of food is ok compared to the food they serve. One can get variety here in food so no monotonous feeling... its a must recommended place for everyone....

It is a must visit for all Rann lovers. Try out the Ilaichi rann here, its a speciality serving....one dish caters to more than 4 adults, filled soft melting boneless mutton....a delicacy for the mouth. Kebabs are equally good. Overall, it is a mutton hideout in the heart of Salt Lake. Drinks are bit over priced. Overall, a must visit.

It was manager's farewell and we decided to check in here. They sent a cab to pick 12 of us from the office. I do not prefer to have soup, but had tomato soup and it tasted perfect. Among starters baby corn was the winner. Then came the main course. If you visit Abcos do order the Elaichi Rann. It was awesome. To get a bit of Bengali flavour try luchi with mutton, we loved it. They had few options for deserts. But the overall experience was good. The service is good and prompt. Most importantly they serve good food.

This is my third visit to Abcos food plaza. It's one of a kind as it houses 4 different restaurants...O' calcutta, Kipling Club , The pen and ink, Dalhousie celebrations (Rooftop) all serving from the same kitchen with the same menu... Although each has a different setting and ambience keeping in mind the preferences of foodie calcuttans. 
¬†¬†¬†¬† Kipling club is a family restaurant, well lit, amply but soberly decorated with instrumentals often playing in the background. 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Coming to the food... Among the starters, Crispy chilli baby corn and Chicken a la kiev (continental) are really good. I had ordered Pomfret fry which was tasty but average. Mango lassi as an appetizer served its purpose well. 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† As for the main course, Elaichi raan is their signature preparation. It's mutton marinated with yoghurt and cardamom presented with rice and vegetables. The mutton is well roasted, soft. Rice is somewhere in between pulao and biriyani. The amount is quite enough for 3 hungry people. But to be honest, the taste becomes a bit monotonous and i am not fond of it really. 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Bengali dishes here do taste like home made. I would advocate going for their Bengali pulao.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Desserts are awesome... Chocolate brownie , Fruit salad with ice cream and finally Crispy honey noodles with ice cream stole the show for me.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Staff are courteous , cordial , helpful.       Overall this restaurant is value for money especially when someone is with a group of 4 or more people.. Prior reservation during peak lunch and dinner hours on any day is hereby recommended.

We went there for lunch, the decor and menu looks like something from the 80s. Food and service is nothing great, the only thing that was good was lasagne. But I must say the portions they serve are huge. Ordering cocktails is not a good idea, overall its an okay place.

An ideal destination for dinner with family and friends. We started with hot and sweet chicken. The dish was well prepared but I have had better Chinese food. Then we had their signature Elaichi Rann. Enjoyed every thing about the item. Mutton was so tender....... simply cooked to perfection. My verdict : have their Indian dishes.

The Pen and Ink is on the 2nd floor of the Abcos Plaza, situated ¬†close to Big Bazaar. The restaurant, which is dimly lit, and hosts an LCD screen as well as a bar area, looks more like a pub than a family restaurant.

I visited the place around 5 pm for drinks and some food, with a couple of friends. Although Tuborg was mentioned on their drinks menu, they told us that they were not serving Tuborg anymore. Maybe they should remove it from their menu! We ordered Carlsberg instead, which was served chilled and Antiquity Blue. So, +1. The drinks were accompanied with peanuts and a savoury mixture as 'chakhna'.¬†

We ordered Masala Papad, Spaghetti with Mushrooms in White Sauce, Kung Pao Potato (sort of Chilly Potato) and a Chicken Sizzler dish. The Masala Papad was crisp and topped with finely chopped onions and tomatoes, however it was too salty.The Spaghetti was okay, nothing great and was accompanied with warm bread and butter. The Kung Pao Potato was soggy, too spicy (I know it's Chilly Potato, but there's a limit to human endurance and I eat pretty spicy food!) and way too oily. The sizzler came pre-plated, not on a sizzling plate, as we had been warned earlier, and again, it was too spicy and tasted average.

The service of drinks was quick, however, the food took too much time to arrive and the waiters kept hovering over our table!¬†

The serving portions are small for the prices. Finally, one get's a certain percentage (15%, if I'm not wrong) of discount on their bill if they are carrying a Shopper's Stop Card.¬†

So, the ratings for The Pen and Ink would be as follows: ¬†

FOOD: 2.5/5

SERVICE: 3.5/5

AMBIENCE: 3.5/5

VALUE FOR MONEY: 3/5

Abcos is a very famous restaurant in our institution. Almost all my friends had been there at least once in every year. As a foodie, we have been there numerous times.

First, having a general sweet tooth i decided to go for a liquid refresher.. I went for the cinderella and my sibling started out with a virgin pinacolada. The ambience was pretty good..calm until a child decided to break the silence. The interior had a colonial feel. The temperature cooled down all our warm food. Good distinct cutlery. The " prawn koliwada" went beyond your usual batter fry. The crispy babycorn was true to its name. Clearly the staff lacks brownie serving skills but they do make up for it with quick and effecient service.
Next time I'd go for a fish prep.

Went for the lunch and to have the famous Elaichi Raan!
Had ordered for a few starters which were so so kind! Then in the main course we had the special mutton dish. The amount of food is quite a lot and enough for 3 hungry people! It is a dish made out of soft boneless mutton pieces with veggies and rice mixed in spices!
I personally liked it but its pretty heavy! And it is suggested not to order much staters before elichi raan!
At the desert had a butterscotch scoop!
We were thee and bill was 2000/-.

An ideal place for an office banquet or for an evening of fine dining with friends and family.
Cozy ambience and decor with quality food and a reasonably good collection of drinks.
The elaichi raan in particular is a must try item on the menu. The dessert section however could do with a little augmentation.
But overall, definitely a joint you won't get tired of visiting.

Abcos has four restaurants serving the same menu. I have been tonthis place before on two occasions and feel pen and ink is more suitable for office parties and kipling club is good to celebrate with friends.  O Calcutta has more of a personalised setting and serves equally good food. The chicken salad is a must try and though we didn't try elaichi rann the chicken items served were good too.

Located at 2nd floor of Abcos Food Plaza never understood the logic behind the same which represents some office stationary store. The ambiance is royal but outdated and lack maintenance.

As we were there for a quick lunch didn't get time to explore their other delicacies. Had Mutton Malai Saagwala and Lasuni Naan. The naan wad soft full of garlic flavour. The dish has succulent mutton boneless chunks cooked in spinach gravy and topped with malai. Had hogged it in few minutes due to its taste. Wish could have more time to explore other dishes.

There will be corporate discount 15% during lunch while 10% during dinner. If you are Shoppers Stop First Citizen then eligible for flat 15% discount round the clock.
They also have pickup and drop facility for big corporate crowd. However the speed of service needs to be improved though servers are extremely courteous.

Been there for a team lunch, ambiance is very good, decor is nice, in case of food I liked kulcha, dal makhni & specially sabjh handi. Do try sabjh handi if you visit this place, I loved it. However my non veg friends did not like food so much & were complaining about the quality. I am a vege so cant comment about non veg food so shared my friends views.. If you are a vege then you can try this place, however its a bit expensive for eating veg food. One thing I liked is that they provided home drop in their car (facility available for small distance).

Well visited this one with my uncle who suggested me that their elaichi raan is one thing I should try. Well to say quite frankly I was disappointed. Mayben because I found it bland or maybe it was my palate. The mutton was not that special and the other items that we ordered like tengri kebab were again what might I say a little above ordinary. I was quite surprised that my uncle was quite moved by this taste as I was not. Well one's choice is one's own. The ambiance and service is quite good.

Last night, we happened to visit O‚ÄôCalcutta (the ground floor multi-cuisine restaurant at the Abcos Food Plaza), not to be confused with the multi-city multi-outlet giants ‚Äì Oh! Calcutta. 

This food plaza (more of a 4-storey building housing 4 different eateries , the O‚ÄôCalcutta, Kipling Klub, Pen and Ink and the Dalhousie Celebrations). The funny part is that though all the 4 restaurants are themed and named differently, all  4 of them share a same/similar multicuisine menu. Tucked in the alley behind Columbia Asia (which connects to the Big Bazaar/Broadway building), this restaurant has stood tall for quite some time now. One of the Generation 1 restaurants of Saltlake, it‚Äôs reputation has not faded even when scores of other joints have mushroomed in the vicinity.

The reason being, well, great food, nice ambience, and a loyal customer base. We were a group of 7, including 2 kids, and since it was midweek, it was reasonably empty at 9PM. Try taking the risk of not booking a table beforehand on a Friday or Weekends, and you would be surprised to see this place filled up, and how!

The restaurant has a enjoyable, a not over-the-edge ambience. The lighting is on the dimmer side and the color theme is dark and red, which incidentally makes a good atmosphere for dinner and some drinks.

The cutlery is nice, and the copper glasses are eye-catching. The staff is civil and courteous. There is also a television set which would screen IPL matches, so that you don‚Äôt miss your match because of a spur-of-the-moment dinner plan.

The kids ordered for Pizzas, while we decided on the Sizzlers. I asked for a Barbequed Chicken Sizzler while my companions ordered for Lamb Silzzlers and Mexican Chicken Sizzlers. While we waited for the sizzlers to arrive, we ordered for a Garlic bread to nibble on, and it was good enough. It was shaped like a pizza and almost tasted like one, with all that cheese thrown in !

The sizzlers arrived, piping hot and sizzling, and boy, was I happy! The Barbeque Chicken was a big, half chicken (The Chicken tandoori types), nicely chargrilled, red and soft, while the barbeque sauce was served separately in a cabbage ball.  Accompanied with French fries, boiled veggies and rice, it was an optical as well as a culinary treat. I relished the taste, and boy the portions were handsome.  The barbeque sauce flavor was bang on authentic. It took me a good 45 mins to finally finish it off, and I was really full, considering we avoided soups, starters or deserts. The rest of the sizzlers were supposedly good too, and we really enjoyed our meal.

There is a corporate discount too, so if you‚Äôre planning to dine during weekends, don‚Äôt forget to carry your I-cards. Overall, a satisfying experience, and would definitely revisit/recommend this place .

Good Job team Abcos‚Ä¶!

This place has an air of quiet sophistication. We had a delightful lunch here today. As starter chicken saslik kebab was succulent. In main course , Elaichi Ran was a real treat.Overnight marinated in yoghurt &elaichi boneless mutton pieces were served with mixed veg & aromatic pulao. The thick gravy was served separately .The quantity was more than sufficient for 4 persons. It's a real muglai treat but not heavy on the stomach. In dessert,Baked Alaska was a real match winner. The medley of spongy cake, mixed fruit, vanilla ice cream & baked egg white on the top make it a heavenly item.  
   We recommend Pen &Ink for a pocket friendly yet sumptuous treat.

O'Calcutta is a pretty good restaurant. After a good movie in nearby carnival cinemas, Abcos is the best place to hangout. The beer is cheap, they have a good collection. You will have a quite a good spread of many quisines. 

We ordered chicken asparagus soup. It was the best soup I had for quite a long time. Then came ghee bhaat, Aloo dum,   Chicken jhol. At last we had cream caramel, which was large in size.

Total value for money!!!!

I have been here several times since 2009 till recent days. They provide sophisticated dining without any doubt. Typical Indian multi-cuisine restaurant. Quality of the food is quite good and with respect to the quality and quantity the price is surprisingly pocket-friendly. Service is enough courteous and sober.
I am personally fan of three of their delicacies. First is the sliced lamb in red chillies - very hot but extraordinarily soft and tasty. Second is Elaichi Rann - famous enough, a rich flavoured biriyani with lots of veggies and tender and tasty meats, extremely tasty but too rich and heavy. Third - Baked Alaska, an extraordinarily unique dessert that completes a meal with ultimate satisfaction.
Nice experience every time. Would like to visit again and again.

I love roof top restaurants and this was my favorite pick in Saltlake.

The food and service was amazing. I always used to prefer to sit here when given an option in comparison to the other restaurants available in the same building known as Abcos Food Plaza.

Been there in 2008 for a team lunch and was mightily impressed. Wanted to be back ever since but it took a leisurely seven years. Couldn't really be helped as it is a bit outside from our usual gastro-circuit.

After a long checkup session at AMRI hospital we were famished. Fasting from the night before, by noon health was the last thing on our mind. Shamelessly we zeroed in on probable food items nearby which included bottles of saline drip, baby food and lunch box of the receptionist.

Afraid of failing the checkup on mental health grounds, we headed out. Our desparation for food was only comparable to that of Rahul Gandhi looking for an election breakthrough. Thankfully Abcos was just round the corner.

My wife had a craving for Crispy Chilli Baby Corn. So starter was sorted. It was crispy and had the right amount of chilli/garlic in it. With a dash of salt and pepper, the cracker of a starter was the best CCBC I ever had.

We ordered garlic naan & a mutton dish. Sadly they turned out to be quite a downer. The naans were quite small and the abysmal amount of garlic on them didn't do justice. The mutton pieces were boneless and excellently cooked - actually I can remember very few instances when I tasted such well cooked mutton. However, they were quite fatty. I was confused about the dish when my wife said: "the amount of seasoning somehow killed the taste of mutton". Yep, that summed it up.

Very few restaurants serve Caramel custard and even fewer get it right. Chinese starter, Indian mains and then Continental desert - our orders defied all logic. But we were pleasantly surprised when it arrived. Neither runny, nor hard; the wobbly goodness had the perfect melt-in-the-mouth consistancy. It's taste brought a sense of completeness after a good meal.

The attentive waiter informed us about corporate discount which we availed using corporate id card. The decor was elegant and understated. I found the ambience soothing and quite relaxing.

The cleanliness of the building impressed us. The white marble staircases didn't have a speck of dust on them and looked sparkling clean. Black stone railing was gleaming and not an inch of it was smudged with fingerprints. Obviously a lot of care went on to them. Not everyday we get to see this level of maintenance in our dusty environment. My wife was so impressed that she shunned the lift to walk down the stairs from top floor. Now, that's a big complement from a lady patron after a hearty four-course meal!

The main course and the sides fell short of our expectation. However, this restaurant has potential and it showed. I found myself thinking about our next health checkup. Who says I am not serious about health?

Dissapointed as we could not get indian cuisine at the time we ordered, as it's only served after 6.30 pm! So we had ordered for some known Chinese dishes with the drinks to start with and found out those were nothing more than very ordinary! 
Then we were served with the dish we were looking forward to - murg malai zafrani kabab! It was pretty good and tasty, so we ordered for another around of it. 
We did not like the  service, as every time we were raising our hands to call the waiters! Pretty frustrating!

Yesterday we decided to visit Abcos since it had been a long time since we had tasted their signature dish (coming to that later) and so we called 'em up to book the cab. Yes, as many of us know they provide free pick-up Drop service and we being in Saltlake Sector 5 had no issues availing that. ¬†

When we reached there we went into their ground floor eatery called 'O Calcutta'. ¬†The place is neatly decorated with an old well-off Calcutta feel with nice vintage pictures of iconic city structures adorning the walls. We were pretty clear about the order, so we placed it right away without wasting much time - we asked for couple of plates of Elaichi Raan, couple of Panner Kulchas and one Subzi Pulao. Now Elaichi Raan is their signature dish and serves nearly three people. It has got very well cooked soft pieces of mutton which is basically a leg of ¬†mutton marinated overnight with yogurt/cardamom/fresh herbs, served with pulao rice and spiced vegetables, the combo is really fantastic. It looks good and tastes even better, if you wanna have plenty of mutton just go for this dish, you'll love it. Subzi pulao was nice, not at all spiced and comes with well tossed veggies in it as the name suggests. Paneer Kulcha was also too good, too much stuffed with paneer inside and very soft, one of the best of its kind available in the town. Also the service was pretty good and swift. ¬†

Overall - a very nice and satisfying dining episode. I keep coming back for the mutton feast in their Elaichi Raan and there is no denying that, I have now lost count how many times I've had this. After all these years, now this place carries a lot of nice memories and great dining experiences. Will be back pretty soon for sure!¬†

Cheers!

Well the photos will be uploaded soon.
Coming to my review first what we ordered were as follows - Elaichi Raan, Chicken lollypop, fish in garlic sauce and fresh lime soda.
Well coming to the fish item--the preparation was good with spices and garlic tossed in sauce,but the fish quantity was very less and on top of that too much of coating applied and deeply fried-did not have the taste of fish much.
Same goes for the chicken lollypop, the crispy fried portion was more compared to the chicken inside.
Now coming to the Elaichi Raan, I have heard so much about it before and so blindly we have ordered that 1 for a group of 4. Quantity was good enough, boneless mutton pieces with vegetables(beans and carrot mostly) with enough quantity of rice(can call it something between polao and biryani). But to be honest the taste of mutton I did not like , pieces were soft and succulent but I personally did not like so much of mutton fat embedded with the flesh, would recommend them to get rid of those fat more before serving people or give customers the option to choose what type of mutton they would like to have.
No complain about the service and staffs--well mannered and helpful. Ambiance was nice but still only 3 , because of the so-called Kolkata famous Elaichi Raan

The Abcos Food Plaza located behind Columbia Asia Hospital and has four floors including the rooftop dining area which is a fantastic winter location for a meal. These guys have been serving up consistently great food since forever and remains a firm favourite with the locals as well as people like me who will make an annual winter trip just for the Saag Mutton and Tandoori Chicken which are both absolutely yummy. Service is average but the food is very good and has been consistent which is why I have been frequenting it for years.

As per me the place is totally of value for money. We'd tried Elaichi Raan, which is definately a classic dish and a must try for everyone. It can serve 3/4 person easily handi gosht was great too. Starter Items tasted average with kababs on platter.Quantity of food is great.

Located near Saltlake big bazaar, and just behind Columbia Asia hospital,the place is easy to reach from anywhere in Kolkata,especially for those living in Saltlake area .
If you're planning to visit abcos,I must suggest you try Biryani Run . Served with impeccably cooked mutton, this is a signature dish from abcos. They prepare the item in a limited amount,so hurry up before it runs out. Did I mention one dish is enough to serve four! Crispy chilli baby corn is one of my favorite starters here as this place manages to make it so perfect. All the side dishes are well enough to be water your palate. In the desserts I would suggest you to try Buskin Robbins Almond.
Overall this place is perfect for any parties your'e planning to give to a bunch of friends,colleagues or family members. You can book a table over phone . They also arrange a cab pick up and drop facility in their convenience.

On the top floor of abacos food court behind columbia asia hospital. The outer looks of the building are just exquisite, it gives a feel that one is going in a tibetian small palace and the Italian marbles, imported granites and lighting effect with decorations gives it a very posh and elegant look.
Menu is large and wide varieties are available. We ordered subz handi and paneer hyderabadi. Subz handi was amazing. Perfect blend of spices and every taste was perfect. The paneer hyderabadi is on spicy side. But so much of onions and masaala overpowered the delicate feel of the paneer in it.
We ordered pudina paraatha which was nice, crisp and flaky and butter naan, which we felt was slightly rubbery. It could have been better neverthless.
The interiors of the restaurent are just perfect but a bit crowded. A/C was not crisp and it had a slightly suffocated environment.
The best part that with two dishes three people were able to have food properly.
Then the icing on the cake was if one is having shoppers stop card or IT sector card one gets a discount on the VAT. So we ended up having dinner for 3 people at such a nice place with great ambience in under 800‚Çπ. Those 4 * is for that only. 
Service is bit slow and waiters could be more courteous. But since we were very hungry we hardly got time to think over it. Nice famliy place but I won't recommend for couples.

This review is not for a one time visit, this is more of a testimonial for abcos. As I have been a frequent foodie here for almost half a decade now.This is certainly one of my all time favourite restaurant. This place is serving good no nonsense tasty food for over a decade now.For most of the people Abcos and Elaichi Raan are synonymous. But I would request them to experiement beyond Elaichi Raan. Elaichi raan is certainly an innovation from them, but there are other items which are also very good.I have ben coming here for last 6 years, and with every visit, tried something new.I am a great fan of their Fish Finger with tartar sauce. I have always found the fish fresh and juicy. The tartar sauce is even tastier than the legendary Peter Cat.Chilli Lamb, Kung Pao chicken are also delicious, if you like spicy food. Since its a multicuisine restaurant, we have tried the Bhetki Paturi, and its very good. The normal normal north indian chicken dishes are decent as well.Dishes which you can give a miss -Prawn dishes are not that good, so you can opt out of the prawn dishes. Also Biriyani is pretty mediocre.Not to be missed is the baked a lasaka. Believe me its waaaaay better than Mocambo. Do not miss it.A scope of improvement for them - Some times they serve old cold drink, which do not have the fizz. This should be rectified

Me n my office team went out for lunch in abcos plaza , they settled us in pen n ink... We ordered for chicken kebab , chili fish n chicken drumsticks for starters...as they did nt have many items available.... They served pretty late n the chicken were stale n smelly , we had return back the order n they refused to accept that the chicken was stale.. In the main course as well we ordered for chicken tikka masala n it was stale as well.  Never want to go to this place again.. Many of us even fell ill after having the food from there. Would recommend people to avoid going tl abcos.

O‚Äô Calcutta along with Kipling Club, The Pen & Ink and Dalhousie Celebration forms one entity Abcos. Located behind Columbia Asia Hospital, Abcos is a 4 storied building with these restaurants on each floor.¬†

Though they are different restaurant but shares same food menu. As mentioned in one of my earlier review if you are visiting Abcos then don‚Äôt think about decor, ambiance or service. It‚Äôs just about food. It is one of those famous establishments in Salt Lake area and reservation is mandatory in case of large group irrespective of any days. 

Here you will find two basic things taste and quantity. Ultimate value for money. One must try the classic award winning dish here is Elaichi Raan which cost around INR 750 before tax but enough for 3 persons.¬†

You also have option to explore the Chinese or Bengali cuisine here too. During winter months if you fancy for rooftop the same provision is also there.

Salt lake Sector 3, Abcos food plaza is the place you can find Kipling club restaurant. Its my girl friend's choice who's research institute (SNBNCBS) is at close vicinity. We entered for a lunch in KK.
The menu was pre decided rather once we have returned from here for not preparing the menu on that day. It is "Elaichi Rann" we came for.¬†

This is actually a complete dish of mutton, rice and vegetables. The mutton was extremely tender, boneless and tasty. Along with they serve colored rice which tastes between polau and fried rice. A mixed vegetable is served with this dish which appears as a needless addition to the whole thing. Overall its awesome.¬†

The service was very good and we have a very attentive person in our table.

The amount is too large for two. Rather it is perfect for three heads.
We two with a beer bottle and a plate of elaichi rann paid 1000 rs.¬†

Note that this menu is prepared in a common kitchen of abcos. So irrespective to the restaurants (Kippling club, pen and ink and oh calcutta) the taste of elaichi rann is going to be the same. This dish is available only between 12 to 3 pm hence hurry up.

Housed on the second floor of Abcos food plaza near Big bazaar in IB block, this restaurant is value for money. I stuck to roti and subzi since vegeterian fare is very regular. Its a whole new story for the non vegeterians, however. A mutton raan is huge and suffices for 3-4 people and is modestly priced at 750 INr. The service was very slow and not to my liking. The AC was not a crisp cooler and we needed the fan too. Now this one was a bad experience. The waiter switched on the fan and it was rotating 180 deg. Another waiter came and turned it off since the people seated at next table did¬† not want the fan. This was a ridiculous situation since we wanted the fan. However we made him switch it on again much to the unliking of the people seated at the other table.
Oh and the nicest thing was they offer free pick up and drop to your office in Ecospace and have a 10% discount for the corporate employees. Overall nice and value for money.

i love o calcutta due to one item - elaichi raan. it's a platter of mutton and tastes awesome. the quantity is enough to serve 3-4 people. along with it i generally have kashmiri pulao which is prepared with fine basmati rice. this restaurant specializes in mutton preparations. handi gosht, mutton achari masala all are prepared with perfection. mutton is soft and the preparations are generally a bit spicey, which i like.

the other kebabs like tandoori, tengri etc are generally good, nothing to complain about. try the mahi azwani if you like fish.

the interior is well decored, quite classy. i would definitely recommend it for family dining or corporate lunch/dinners.

i like dalhousie @ abcos because of it's location. it's a rooftop open air restaurant at abcos food plaza. getting parking is easy, location of abcos is near columbia asia hospital. i have been to dalhousie at least 8-10 times and love the ambiance. it has limited seats though and often stays full during rush hours during holidays.
food is decent, nothing extraordinary. i have tried murg tandoori, murg shaslik, murg reshmi, mahi azbani, murg badami and all tasted nice, but the price was on the higher side. quality compared to price was not good. quantity per serving was good though.
alcohol price is very high, so prepare to spend high if you are here for drinks.
overall, a nice restaurant with good ambiance but the cost is too high compared to the quality of food served here. also, waiting time is high after placing order.

Have been seeing abcos from so much time but tried them only a couple of weeks ago and was delighted at the experience here.¬†

Located near charnocks, it a building that hosts 3-4 restaurants with identical menus but different ambiance. I visited this family dining one. The decor was average, nothing great but with comfortable seating. The staff were pretty polite but service was taking time. The rates were amazingly reasonable and after having tasted the food, they seemed all the more value for money.

Coming to food, paneer tikka kebab was good and not that great. The soups were decent but the star was the main course. The kali dal had a huge serving size and was lovely. The mix veg was pretty good too. The rotis were well made and loved their pulao in the end.¬†

Overall, amazing food, great serving sizes, reasonable pricing, basic ambiance, decent staff service.

Today I had my lunch here with 7member of my family.
I have oredered Elaichi Rann, Chicken Bharta, Butter Nun, Veg Pulao and Paneer tikka lababar.
Good thing is that we have got our seat to the earliest and didn't have to wait.
The food quality is standard despite the Durga Puja Crowd.
Rann was as usual, enough to feed 2gent and 2ladies full.
So I can suggest people to try Abcos, as you can get a medium sized crowd here if you are at Saltlake at Puja.

One of my office colleague suggested this food hub for its famous Elaichi Raan and we were simply blown away by the elegant taste of the dish. It has a nice ambiance and is strategically placed from the heart of Salt Lake as well as the EM bypass, so location wise it is convenient to reach from any parts of the City. You can enjoy full fledged business lunch as well as heart warming food night with your family and friends.

Kipling, commonly known as Abcos is one of my favourite restaurants close to my home as well as office. The main reason of liking this restaurant is their award winning  Elaichi Raan, mutton marinated over night with yogurt   and spices and cooked; served with Pulao, mixed veg, and Salad. A single portion is always good enough for three. At max you can add a few butter Nun to go with this. It's just unbelievably good. The meat is so soft, your teeth will hardly be used for chewing. It's perfectly blended with right amount of spices and acids. Pulao gives u adequate carb in your plate.
Surprisingly, few weeks back when we had it again, the meat was excellent. But pulao and veg had some stale smell, absolutely not appetising. Complaining about the same, the manager changed it, but still can't expect this from Kipling.

Abcos has proved to be a comfort place for me... hence, opted this place for a friend's farewell party, based on the consistency it has maintained over the years.. Free pick-up and drop was definitely another reason!

Started with Kung pao Mushroom, our very own Fish Muniere and Fresh Lime Soda.. Mushroom was served quite fast, along with the soda.. the mushroom preparation was excellent! Tangy, Spicy and exactly the way we wanted.. we were so delighted with the dish that we ordered one more plate of the same.. everyone had a burning tongue and still continued.. the soda acted as a savior.. though the soda was a little letdown.. it was warm and smelt of somewhat rotten lime.. we expressed our concern and they added ice cubes to our drinks.. they could have offered a change.. Yes, the same has been the case in one of my last visits.. Yes, I could see the degradation in their service..

Fish Muniere was around and we were again delighted at the sight.. but the delight disappeared once we tasted the same! I have been having this dish each and every time I had visited Abcos and I can smell the slightest change! The fish was a little stale.. hard.. the coating was dry... the melt-in-mouth consistency was badly missing.. 

The main course was served meanwhile, Butter nun, Achari paneer jhalfarezi and Murg Patiala.. murg patiala was chicken keema wrapped with egg.. tasted good but nothing extraordinary..¬† paneer tasted different.. that tangy and peppery taste worked well for me.. 

Elaichi Raan, probably the signature dish of this restaurant, was served after this.. It tasted the same as years, as mentioned by my friends.. though the veggies were a little over-spiced for me..

I concentrated on my Chicken Mexicana Shashlic.. Missed the sizzler plate for this dish.. missed the added charring flavor..¬† as they told sizzlers are not allowed except Dalhousie, the roof top restaurant.. This dish, again, being a favorite of mine, would have been caught on the minimum depreciation and exactly that happened.. the chicken was way too spicy for a continental dish.. however , the portions were generous enough to be shared by two of us.. 

For me, a meal at Abcos can NOT be completed without Baked Alaska.. And yes, it again tasted like heaven.. the creamy, fruity, eggy dessert defined the finish line of our meal.. on a happy note definitely! A plus one just for this dish..

We were 9 happy souls.. 4654/- was the pocket pinch!

What I observed was a clear degradation in service and food quality.. which should be repaired at the earliest. or can take a toll on their reputation!

Today I had my lunch here with 7member of my family.
I have oredered Elaichi Rann, Chicken Bharta, Butter Nun, Veg Pulao and Paneer tikka lababar.
Good thing is that we have got our seat to the earliest and didn't have to wait.
The food quality is standard despite the Durga Puja Crowd.
Rann was as usual, enough to feed 2gent and 2ladies full.
So I can suggest people to try Abcos, as you can get a medium sized crowd here if you are at Saltlake at Puja.

One of my office colleague suggested this food hub for its famous Elaichi Raan and we were simply blown away by the elegant taste of the dish. It has a nice ambiance and is strategically placed from the heart of Salt Lake as well as the EM bypass, so location wise it is convenient to reach from any parts of the City. You can enjoy full fledged business lunch as well as heart warming food night with your family and friends.

Kipling, commonly known as Abcos is one of my favourite restaurants close to my home as well as office. The main reason of liking this restaurant is their award winning  Elaichi Raan, mutton marinated over night with yogurt   and spices and cooked; served with Pulao, mixed veg, and Salad. A single portion is always good enough for three. At max you can add a few butter Nun to go with this. It's just unbelievably good. The meat is so soft, your teeth will hardly be used for chewing. It's perfectly blended with right amount of spices and acids. Pulao gives u adequate carb in your plate.
Surprisingly, few weeks back when we had it again, the meat was excellent. But pulao and veg had some stale smell, absolutely not appetising. Complaining about the same, the manager changed it, but still can't expect this from Kipling.

Abcos has proved to be a comfort place for me... hence, opted this place for a friend's farewell party, based on the consistency it has maintained over the years.. Free pick-up and drop was definitely another reason!

Started with Kung pao Mushroom, our very own Fish Muniere and Fresh Lime Soda.. Mushroom was served quite fast, along with the soda.. the mushroom preparation was excellent! Tangy, Spicy and exactly the way we wanted.. we were so delighted with the dish that we ordered one more plate of the same.. everyone had a burning tongue and still continued.. the soda acted as a savior.. though the soda was a little letdown.. it was warm and smelt of somewhat rotten lime.. we expressed our concern and they added ice cubes to our drinks.. they could have offered a change.. Yes, the same has been the case in one of my last visits.. Yes, I could see the degradation in their service..

Fish Muniere was around and we were again delighted at the sight.. but the delight disappeared once we tasted the same! I have been having this dish each and every time I had visited Abcos and I can smell the slightest change! The fish was a little stale.. hard.. the coating was dry... the melt-in-mouth consistency was badly missing.. 

The main course was served meanwhile, Butter nun, Achari paneer jhalfarezi and Murg Patiala.. murg patiala was chicken keema wrapped with egg.. tasted good but nothing extraordinary..¬† paneer tasted different.. that tangy and peppery taste worked well for me..

This is not just a restaurant but a food mall as this whole building is segregated into four restaurants.All the four restaurants have a very nice ambiance specially the DALHOUSIE CELEBRATIONS which is on the roof and if you want to have a nice romantic-candle light-roof-top-open-air dinner with your loved one this is the place.
This place is very easy to locate as it falls very close to the Broadway multiplex in sector 3.
The staff is friendly and courteous and welcoming.
As far as food is concerned I would rate it above mediocre.A few of the dishes are very nice but if the restaurant is crowded than it can take a toll on the taste of the dish you have ordered as they try to prepare it quickly.
The vegetarian cuisine is expensive and not so mouthwatering.
But people flock this place for it's non-veg dishes specially the MUTTON ELAICHI RANN as this rann is the best in the city.
To sum up, it's a great palce if you have got a big appetite for non veg food.

To start off with, a nice resturant with quality food and good service. Located just behind Columbia Asia hospital, its one of the places which i guess most of the people are not aware of. But that wont be a problem because Abcos provides pickup and drop facilities in that place.  We had the Elaichi Rann in our main course which they portray as their speciality and i must say it as one of the finest preparation i had . Apart from that the fish and chicken starters were also good . But somehow the veg dishes like dal and sabji was not that delicious.Overall a nice resturant with good food.

This joint of ABCOS has nothing superb in their menu.
Both price wise and menu wise it is lagging behind in every aspects.
Firstly, the Quality of the items is not upto the mark in comparism to other nearby restaurants in salt lake
Secondly, the price is on a higher side which can be expensive to some class of people.
Thirdly, the service(wait time between the order and delivery is nearly 40-45 mins) is average.
Fourtly, Decent ambience.
Overall a 3 rating from my side out of 10.

Abcos houses four restaurants at four floors, all serving the same menu though.
 The Pen & Ink is one of them. The USP of this place is they have pickup and drop facility from and to offices at Sector-V. So this is always a great plus for people like us.¬†


Here, the ambiance is pretty nice, comfortable seating and cozy interiors. Coming to the food - I haven't had better crispy chilli baby corn in any other restaurant to be true. The chef knows the trick how it should actually be prepared! Though my personal favorite is elaichi rann, a complete platter dish of lamb, vegetables and rice. This wholesome plate serves 3-4 people, and is really awesome to say the least.¬†


Althogh they serve both Chinese and Indian, but I suggest please do go for the Indian dishes over here. They are really worth the money! Cheers!

Been here for an office party. The best thing about this place is that they have a free pick up and drop service and a corporate discount. The place is well decorated and overall ambiance is really nice. For starters we ordered for roasted chilli lamb, crispy baby corn and five spice chicken. Chicken and baby corn was awesome while I did not like the lamb much. For main course we ordered Elaichi Ran , the famous dish here and trust me its enough for at least three. Its like biriyani with lots of fried vegetables and mutton. Personally am not a biriyani lover, but found this item tastier than biriyani. We were too overloaded to have desserts , so we skip that. Overall a really nice experience in reasonable price.

One of the four restaurants in Abcos food plaza. They serve mughlai, indian, chinese. They serve alcohol too. Everything is good about this. Food is good, ambience is good, service is good. Good place to hangout with family. Their chinese dishes are more popular than their indian dishes. I have been there few times and never been disappointed. Very popular among Salt Lake residents. Weekends are always full. One will have be in queue for some time.

Elaichi Raan is what this place is famous for. I have visited this place a couple of times and each time the said item has been the main item ordered. Decor and ambiance is not something that strikes an impression.
Apart from elaichi raan the other items though are good but fade away in comparison.
Service is okay and at times there is a certain delay as well.

Two poor souls wanted a drink and a bite before a movie and this was a nice option. They ordered a bottle of kingfisher (premium.. 650 ml), corn and cheese toast and kung pao mushroom. The server set the drink first, and added a small bowl of cheeselings. 

The kung pao mushrooms came in next. It was quite tasty albeit a bit too hot for one poor soul. The other one was happily chomping down the mushrooms. At this point the corn cheese toast came with some French fries which were pretty obviously from a packet. But they were Fried fresh and the corn cheese toast themselves were hot, tasty and filling. The bill, which was asked for quickly, was under 500/- which was cause for much rejoicing and eating more cheeselings before leaving.

Dalhousie Celebrations is located at the rooftop of Abcos food plaza in salt lake sector 3.
Abcos basically have four restaurant in there different floors and dalhousie is on their top floor.
Basically my brother is a fan of dalhousie as his very fond of outdoor seating.So now and then i visit Dalhousie for family dinner and gathering. 
Its a peaceful place to spend some quality time with friends and family.. But as per decoration,its very average.There rooftop seating is the key to their popularity in terms of ambience... 
The staffs are polite and friendly.. And one of the plus point in Abcos food plaza is that they have ample of space for parking. 
Coming to the food i have almost tried all of their items specially i prefer their north indian cuisine ( elaichi raan, tandoori chicken, kali dal) the food is good... Even the price is reasonably charged.

The ambience(specially the roof top) is quite good, service is also fine. Price is a bit higher side. Regarding food the best dish is ELAICHI RAAN- superb for mutton lovers. it is more than enough for 2 people. in general indian foods are better than chinese here. the kababs are also good. they have a very good thing that pick up and drop facilty for large groups.

I am an ardent fan of Abcos and immediately grabbed the chance of visiting the same while a family dinner was getting planned!!! It was a saturday night and I did not expect of getting a table at the first chance.. but we did, and that also in its rooftop section, i.e., Dalhousie.. Pertaining to that day's nice climate, we were overjoyed!! 

After being seated, the first part of orders went for Carlsberg and Cosmopolitan.. And all of us, specially the kid of the block enjoyed the titbits served with the drinks.. perfectly salted, perfectly crunchy nuts and mixtures.. 

In Starter, I ordered the same item which I have been ordering in my every visit.. Fish Muniere!! They just excel in this item.. Perfectly baked Fish fillets, with veggies with the perfect crunch and ,french fries.. I could have eaten up all the three plates, believe me!! They were absolute bliss!! 

Thought of experimenting a little in mains.. and avoided the craving of Elaichi Raan.. and went for sizzlers.. 2 plates of Chicken mexican shashlik and a plate of Crispy oven baked chicken with bbq sauce. My husband went for Chicken strognoff. While ordering, the waiter politely suggested that 4 of these platters would comfortably serve 5 of us and we decided to go by his word!! Thankfully!! The portions were real huge!! 

Chicken Mexican shashlik were superb.. juicy, spicy chicken chunks sizzling with veggies, fries and rice.. 

Crispy baked chicken was chicken coated with cornflakes and baked in oven.. tasted good with the sauce though I felt the sauce was a little more tangy to my taste.. And also, the chicken was a little thready, dry I mean! 

The chicken strognoff was heaven.. creamy, gooey white sauce with mushroom, onion and chicken.. 

We practically battled off to finish our portions.. one platter is enough for 1.5 persons.. thanks to the waiter that he saved us from the guilt of spoiling food!

Last but not the least, a must in any of my Abcos visit.. Baked Alaska.. Creamy, fruity, eggy.. in one word, wonderful!! Couldn't end off our meal better without this item.. 

The pocket pinch was around 3500/-!! Happy souls!!

I generally avoid eating bengali food when out for a meal since this is what we eat at home. But my parents were hosting a lunch for a few friends and we joined in too. If you are a fish lover, try the fish meuniere. My dad is a big fan of their whole bhetki in the sauce of your choice served with rice and alu peyaj posto. My dad generally chooses the mustard sauce or shorshe bata for the bhetki in this case. This dish is a complete meal that can serve 3-4 people with average appetite. 
By the way, even if you are looking to host a party which has a guest list not more than around 40 people you can talk to the managers beforehand and they can arrange for it -- there is a secluded area perfect for private parties.

This place is part of the Abcos Food Plaza group and own the virtues that are common to all the categories of this group like moderately priced, pretty good quality and quantity, courteous staff members. Now coming to the food, if you are a soup lover like me, do remember to try their seafood chowder. I also love their fish in lemon butter sauce -- light and flavorful -- a combination for days you would like to eat comparatively healthy food without compromising on the taste factor.

This is pretty near to where my parents currently stay and I have been frequenting this place for quite some time now. The balance of the quality, quantity and pricing is awesome in all the sections of Abcos Food Plaza. Located in a by-lane, one should think that there would be ample parking, but with a hospital right round the corner, there is often a fight for free slots in the peak hours. Now coming to the food, I am a big fan of their soups and mocktails. If you plan to go for Chinese, do not miss their dry chili fish. If you like mutton, try their Elaichi Rann -- It is a spicy meat concoction that is served with sauteed vegetables and pilaf on the side -- a meal in itself, and can easily be shared by 3-4 people with average appetite.  .

This place is a good one for standard food with not so heavy pocket pinch. It is part of Abcos Food Plaza. The food is pretty good. The staff members are accommodating. They also cater to my mom's requirement of Jain style food which many non veg restaurants do not comply with. And if you are working, remember that the restaurant offers discount to corporate clients -- just carry your card.

Abcos or Pen and ink is similar to me as each floor of the building houses a restaurant of different name but serves almost the same items. The chinese and continental are my favorite picks here. All Chinese items scores well. The taste is light and has its own appeal unlike many other restaurants. The continental favorites are Chicken Alakeiv.... its juz awesome. People who loves cheese will have a fetish for it.
Another noticeable attribute of this joint is its service- impeccable and courteous is what defines it.
Abcos is my alltime favourite and I simply love visiting this place.

The Abcos Food Plaza has been around for years any most residents of Salt Lake would have dined there often because at one point of time it was one of the few dining options in that part of town. I have some dear friends who have lived there and I was first taken there many years back by them and have visited frequently since. They are a multi-cuisine restaurant and serve up very good standard fare . Their Indian food is very good and the Chinese and Continental good. However like all foodies I have my favorites or must haves and would recommend the Chicken Hawaian Salad to start with especially in the summer months. The Tandoori Chicken is delicious as is the Mutton Saagwala .... their Kali Dal is also pretty good .... order up a basket of assorted Naan and Roti's and your set for a good meal. Pricing is pretty decent , quantity is good though has reduced compared to earlier. Decor nothing special but service could be better. A good place where I have eaten consistently good food over the years.

Good food good service good ambience. Perfect for a hangout with friends and family. I would recommend the fish fingers in the starters. They come with a mayonnaise dip which adds to the flavor just in the right direction. You should also try the mutton biriyani, or if you are 3-4 in munber, try the Elaichi Raan. It comes with aromated biriyani rice, boneless tender mutton with coriander and saut√©ed vegetables, and is a treat to the eyes and taste buds.

Abcos Food Plaza is the ultimate food destination for many of us in Salt Lake. it is there for eons. This area has become the new hot spot in salt lake with big bazaar, CCD, Broadway, Columbia Asia hospital, EZCC, all coming up in the vicinity. it i a unique concept of food plaza as all restaurants here serve the same kind of food except the rooftop pub. So you can order Chinese, north Indian, Bengali, pizza‚Ä¶whatever you want to have. I liked the Chinese most in this restaurant though the north Indian fare is also good. this particular restaurant is more elegant in decor. its good for small groups or family. the chicken kebabs, chicken bharta, butter naan combo has never failed me. ok now the report card. the food is good, service is courteous, price is not too heavy, what else can one look for? go and have a good time.

Abcos Food Plaza is the ultimate food destination for many of us in Salt Lake. In earlier days food was the only attraction. Now we go there after hopping in nearby big bazaar or after catching a movie in Broadway. This area has become the new hot spot in salt lake. First of all three floors have different restaurants here but they all serve the same kind of food. So you can order Chinese, north Indian, Bengali, pizza‚Ä¶whatever you want to have irrespective of the restaurant that you choose to it in. ambiance is nothing great but it classy. getting a table on weekend is really a trouble. 

I liked the Chinese most in this restaurant though the north Indian fare is also good. The soups are very good and refreshing. The spring rolls are crunchy. The hunan chicken and schezuan chicken is really tasty to go with chili garlic noodles or mixed fried rice. This restaurant is not very costly also. Bill for two will be around 1000. All in all, good place for lunch or dinner if you are in this area.

This place once a favourite joint for itians and we are visitors since last 6 to 7 years! But I sirprised to feel the potentiall fall of the taste and quantity, now days. Price is also become high, which is not matching any longer with the taste of food!.. no longer a value for money. Their most wanted dish Elaichi Ran has a great downfall. My advice.. if you are ordering same more than one dish then order first one entity and taste it... also ask them to supply as seperate dishes. Othwrwise you can feel 2 elaichi run = 1.5 elaichi run cheating your taste buds!

A rather under-rated restaurant I'd say. Decent ambience, average service (our order took almost 30 mins) . The 'Elaichi Raan' is no doubt their signature dish, enough to feed 3 hungry men. I also would recommend you try the unusually quaint murgh malai zafrani kebab the next time you pop-in. Definitely value for money!

So yesterday I went to The Pen & Ink for dinner. Although I have been here several times before, I never  felt like writing a review for it, because it is kind of unnoticeable. Last night we ordered chilly chicken, noodles, chicken fried rice and sweet and sour chicken. All the dishes were disappointingly bland and the chicken was not fresh at all. It was hard and it made me feel like puking. The vegetables in the fried rice were uncooked. All in all, the experience was not good at all. The interiors were clean but that could not make up for the bad food.

This is part of Abcos food plaza, Saltlake - one of the most visited places for Sector-V office-goers. Infact I used to be more frequent here couple of years back. Recently we again dropped at this place and this time thought of writing a review of this most-visited common eating joint for people like us, for whom it is almost a default option for several office lunch parties. The starters are really good here and not to forget the one and only - Elaichi Rann. Don't miss to have this when you are here. Another really important and helpful fact - Abcos offers complimentary pickup / drop service, so if you really need it do avail it.

If you are visiting Abcos then don‚Äôt think about decor, ambiance or service. It‚Äôs just about food. It is one of those famous establishments in Saltlake area and reservation is mandatory in case of large group irrespective of any days. 
Don‚Äôt fall for the 4 different restaurant names mentioned at the entry. Whether you visit Kipling Club, the Pen & Ink, O‚Äô Calcutta or even Dalhousie Celebration its same menu.
Here you will find two basic things taste and quantity. Ultimate value for money. Classic award winning dish here is Elaichi Raan which cost around INR 750 before tax but enough for 3 persons. One can also explore the Chinese or Bengali cuisine here too. If you fancy for rooftop the same provision is also there.

However, the most pol pulse fish here would certainly be the 'Ilaichi Raan'. Its a boneless delicacy of a mutton raan, enough for at least 2-3 people. The dish comes with adequate pulao and some vegetables. Do not miss this dish if you are in Abcos.

I have been in Kolkata for more than a couple of years before i moved to other places. Since my office was in Salt Lake we used to go out a lot for team lunch and other parties. Salt Lake has major restaurants spread out either in and around City Centre 1 or in several blocks of the Salt lake city. Pen & Ink is a decent place to be if you are in salt lake and want to eat a nice lunch or dinner at a reasonable price. It is the second floor of the Abcos Food Plaza and you have the option of choosing any floor out of the other 3 floors if one floor is full. The food plaza also has a roof top restaurant where you can actually feel the breeze on a weekend in case you want to sit outside for a change. The menu is basically the same for all the floors as far as i know. These guys provide pick up and drop facility as well if you are booking for 8 people or more. One more reason to go to the place. Final thing! I know you guys want to know about the food. The best thing I have eaten here is Elaichi Raan and I eat this most of the times when I go here. This is THE best thing in the house to me. It serves around 3-4 people and is value for money. This dish consists of Kashmiri Rice, sauted veggies, mutton pieces (thigh), gravy. It is kind of an Indian platter and tastes yummy. The other thing that you might want to try is Date Pancake with Ice Cream, again a very nice dessert of the options available. The other great thing in their menu is Ananas Ka Raita. Most of the restaurants serve a regular Boondi Raita but you get a special form here which is quite good. I wouldn't recommend this place for continental though. You also get a choice of liquor to choose from in case you think I have missed out on that part. The other dishes such as Kebabs, Tandoor, Nan etc. is pretty good, staff is friendly as well. Head out to discover more.

The ambiance is good.The waiters are professional.The decor is soothing. The bar is pricy. The food is pleasing to the palate. They play it very safe here at Kipling Klub. The taste is conservative.Which is good,except that sometimes,things might get bland,figuratively. Because sometimes,at least a few dishes could have some signature special touch. Of course,Im not finding fault with the fact that many of the items here are safely done. Its good that they don't experiment much.But sometimes I like surprises and adventure for my palate. Last time I had their Fish and Chips. it was nicely prepared,but the fries were a tad cold. But perhaps I'm just being finicky . I also had the Baked Alaska for dessert. It was subtle to taste,which In short, to me,was heavenly. Prices are slightly on the higher side. But quite acceptable,overall.

Were here to celebrate 31st night dinner with family. The starters were too good, especially the prawn dishes were off the hook.  The main course were not great,...um..ok, I can say. Its a small and cute little place, good for enjoying with family.

I call this restaurant the Indian food Underdog of salt lake . Have been here a couple on times and taken parcels quite a few times. The ambiance is slightly tacky with colored glass ceiling and Bollywood music but the food has always been great . 
The service is on the shoddy side but the staff is polite and the place is usually packed on weekends and sometimes even on weekdays. 

Coming to the food they doa decent job with tandoori items... Sorry i have always eaten indian food here. The reshmi kebab and the tangri have never disappointed me . 

The tawa gosh ( not sure of the exact name ) have always been brilliant and wonderfully cooked. Even the chicken tikka masala is one of the better ones I have eaten in salt lake . 

Coming to veg ( usually not on my palette ) but there is one dish that we always order is the malmali or makhmali kofta. its one of them .. The paneer kofta is so soft and just melts in your mouth, comes in a rich white gravy and is always brilliant. The chhole and daal makahni are pretty ordinary . 

Never really ahd any dessert but the are very prompt in serving and make awesome naans. 

Over all a nice place to go especially if you are a noisy bunch ... people here don't seem to mind

Heard a lot about the Elaichi Raan at Abcoss, so went there after a movie night in Broadway.
Ample free parking available at the ground beside the building. Courteous guard at the parking deserves a special mention.
The afternoon operation starts from 6:30. 
Abcoss is basically a collection of different restaurants in different floors, but one good thing is you can sit in any one, and order  food from any other. They will happily manage that.
We headed for the rooftop restaurant - Dalhousie. It was just evening, and the weather was right. So we enjoyed a lot sitting there.
Some mocktails and then elaichi raan - food was perfect. It was good for two or even more. Mutton pieces were good, and pretty well cooked. However they recently increased the price to 750. Felt like its little too much.
Ambiance was nice as mentioned earlier - aquarium, music, courteous staffs.
They also provide liquor, however I didn't wish to try it.
Finally, they happily provide corporate discount. Just keep a visiting card handy when you go there. :)

Abcos rooftop Dalhousie is nice & peaceful for small groups of 3-5 people...but ordinary.
The bar had enough varieties for the regular drinker. Price is realistic. 
Food is ok, prawn fried like chili pakodas and fish fillet & chips were mouthful. 
With mughal, Chinese, continental and now authentic bengali dishes the restaurant can satisfy multi-cultural taste buds.
However, to get an overall better ranking they need to improve the seating arrangement. The round tables with huge umbrella in between are good for day outs, not so much for cozy dim lit wintry dinners. The rectangular tables could get more stable with firm unbroken chairs. The solitary male toilet is perfectly highlighted, even a drunken grandmaster wouldnt miss it, however people sitting at the last table dont really want to see all that while getting mesmerized by an overstuffed sizzler.
The sizzler is filling. The mixed sizzler is good for 1.5 people. Only the muscular mutton rib in it makes it too uneven & not very cutlery friendly. Stop putting excessive French fries for decoration pls. 
And I keep saying this, playing music just for the sake of it makes it noisy...and is a browny point repellant in my book.

I took a few friends to this place for the famed elaichi raan. The service and ambience is good. The timing is also quite good but we were the only group at that time so it cant be a measurement bar. To the food - apart from elaichi raan we took fish kabab, naan and mushroom. Honestly 5 pieces of fish for 330 was too expensive. The elaichi raan was as good as ever but quantity has reduced though price is 750 now. Worth a visit for the raan and the hot gulab jamun. Recommend a booking for the raan if you want fast service for it.

The service is unbelievably worse. On entering, there was nobody to attend to.
Secondly they take huge time to serve starters and finally when it got served the kebabs were cold and brittle. 
Although thankfully the main course tasted good..
Highly NOT RECOMMENDED

After a long term call back to kolkata, a short tour to SNBNCBS, hungry mood in lunch time made us (me and she) reach to Abcus. "Pen and Ink" is at 2 nd floor of this building. Entry was co incidental as we found the 1st floor restaurant was closed.  Just after the entry a nice decor will attract your eyes. Long tables at right, small 4 sitters at left and half moon personal space at the center, deemed  golden light along with copper finish walls made the space adorable even at sunny day time. 
As it was a week day lunch we were the third pair to enter inside, so not so crowded ambiance we found there which I liked most. 

A quick attention will be drawn to your table as staffs are careful and humble. We found the order for Indian dishes are not possible for the day for some unknown reason hence we moved for Chinese. Our order was 

sweet lime soda
chicken peeper and salt
mixed Hakka chowmin 
which were delivered after 20 minutes from the order.

Sweet lime soda was nicely blended with sweet and sour tastes.
Chicken peeper and salt was almost a dried version of chili chicken with a higher amount of fried garlic. The taste of this plate was not so special but okk.
Mixed Hakka chowmin was very much non special. Moreover a burnt smell was coming from it which was though very mild but quite abnormal for such Chinese foods. The noodles used for the dish was very ordinary. As the taste of the noodles plate is very much dependent of the quality of the raw material used a very good taste demands a very good quality of the materials. 

Finally we were charged Rs 596/- for the above set of menu for 2 heads. This was after 10% discount because of institutional I card of her. More over instead sweet lime soda other two items were ordered in single plate. Hence I must say these prices are quite high with respect to other places in Kolkata and reminds me about Pune. 

:: A Single Shot :: This is a bar come restaurant. Probably drinks will appear attractive than food. 

The 80% of my rating is for the ambiance and decor but not for the food and price.

 By the way I don't understand the origin of the name "Pen and Ink" which is any how not connected with foodies instead preparing bills and I don't like bills before (even sometimes after, ha ha) foods. Why not forks and plates or bottles and liquors were named ???

We (5 Adult + 2 kids) arrived there at 3 PM ,lunch time was over in all nearby restaurant by then.
PEN & INK in 2nd floor of Abcos gives us relief. Fee parking space available there. In my last visit it was free.
Staircase and Inside d√©cor is eye catching. Sitting arena is comfortable.  
Staffs are humble and helpful. We ordered beer and cocktail, fried threaded chicken and some lamb preparation as starter and Elaichi Raan as main course.
Starter was good, chicken was fresh and lamb is awesome. But Ealichi Raan steals the show it tastes out of the world just heaven for mutton lover. Quantity is so huge that we ordered 2 plates of it and we really face challenges to make it finish as we hate to waste a single bit of this delicious platter.
Price of food is decent, quality is excellent. Elaichi Raan is 560.
They give discount (8-10%) on showing your corporate ID.

But cocktail price are unreasonably extremely on higher side (400+) .

the windy weather in the evening,the bike ride in the lanes of saltlake yesterday,aroused our quench for...beer!! ;-) then n there we( me n my bf ) planned for beer at dalhousie's rooftop.
it was about 4:30pm we reached abcos,but were pretty disheartend when we got to know the rooftop opens at 6:30pm n it might not open for the rains! the only restaurant open there was pen n ink on the 2nd floor- and indian menu wouldnot be available.
we settled for it,and i must say the interior decor,from the staircase ,the lift, the inside of the restro blew me off.i found the wooden touch so classy, the u shaped sofa(like that of pizza hut,camac st ) really was super cozy,and also gives privacy,the wall shades,ceiling lamps,lcd...all done 
nicely,but soft music could be a better add-on!
the menu card is a bunch of printed sheets filed and clipped together,i had no clue why they cant design a proper menu card when they can spend so much on the decor!
we order 2 large beer,reasonably priced, fosters and kingfishers at 160bucks .and moreover its served with generous amounts of cheesy bites and salted nuts in two separte bowls.
i wasnot pretty confident on the  continental items,and went safe with chinese.
 tuesday-being a veg day for him,we ordered for a crispy chilli babycorn.the portion was great,the taste was awesum,and we were truely over satisfied :)
note ,the prices are about 20bucks higher than that mentioned in the menu in zomato.14.5%vat and 5% service tax are applicable for both food and drinks
the vegetable choupsey took a long time of 30 mins,but tasted well too.
now the reason for 3.5 is their ambience and food,the big reason for deducting is their SERVICE.the 1st servings were upto the mark.but after asking for refilling the cheese bites,we waited quite a long time and had to remind them again.also,the food takes pretty long time to get served.hope they soon improve on their service!

simple decor,huge quantity,nice taste. that's what defines kipling klub. we had chicken lollipop,american chopsuey and chicken in hot garlic sauce. the gravy was too fiery. but the chicken pieces were soft and juicy. the best is it didn't hurt the pocket much. all in all,a good place just behind the building of columbia asia hospital

what I love about this restaurant is the smell... the smell is so distinct and takes you to old Calcutta restaurants!!

apart from that, in the starters, you must try the crispy chilli baby corn - it is one of the best baby corns in Calcutta! the Chinese food is really good, although a little too much on the spicy side... fresh lime soda is good, the schezwan chow is fantastic, but the fried rice is very average... however, the abcos special veggies and the veg manchurian are really good!!!! 

the service is a little lousy and the staff, a little impolite... the desserts are below average - the swiss roll sucks big time.. 

but due to the good food and extremely pocket friendly prices, I'd keep revisiting the place and recommend everyone for giving a birthday treat! :D

The food is very popular with residents of Salt Lake but honestly I did not find it very good. I totally agree with other reviewer... you have to constantly keep on reminding the Reception guy or your table is given to someone else. On the whole not worth they hype. I will surely give this restaurant a miss in future.

it was a weekday and my hubby and i went in search of some continental food around salt lake. it was the first time that we landed in Pen and Ink. the ambiance of the restaurant was good enough and the staff was very cordial and friendly. we ordered for a chicken steak and a chicken ala kiev. i was a bit apprehensive about my order... the ala kiev. to my surprise when it was served and i took the first bite it was delicious. the chicken melted in my mouth and it was yummm. the chicken steak was nonetheless tasty. though my full marks go to the chicken ala kiev. try it to believe it!!

There are tons of good things about this restaurant in Abcos Plaza...
But a few "facts" I think... I must mention. I am sorry if I sound "rude"...
 
1. If tables are not available they would ask you to wait in a garage like corridor. No AC. Some stray dogs will be sleeping under your cheap plastic chair especially on a rainy evening. And that is applicable for all the restaurant at abcos. The waiting place is common.

2. But if you don't have a plan to fast that night...you would better ping the reception constantly....otherwise some body else pinging will get the table and you will keep waiting :-)

3. There is a dedicated parking lot for abcos on the left. The parking attendant seems to be extremely helpful. In fact he is our best experience at abcos.

4. Once we get in it we found lots of tables are lying empty....and dozens of people are waiting out side....why? God knows.

5. Food was ok...or rather good. But "Mahi Biriyani"  was....Yaaaakkkkkk.

Authentic Bengali food in a premium setting has always been a craving for the Kolkata elites and Oh! Calcutta has been  just the long awaited answer to their prayers. Authentic indigenous dishes served in a setting reminiscence of 40s Bengal , with Rabindrasangeet played in the background and showcases displaying Tagore's "Sanchayita"  the setting oozes  bangaliana in every respect.  Exquisite silver  cutleries , highballs, goblets and mahogany furniture makes the setting grandiose in every respect. The food doesn't let you down either. The menu has a wide variety of dishes that can be customized to the customer's taste.  Aam bhendi  , potol posto , bori bhaja and many more Bengali cuisines  are sure to delight your taste buds.  Luchi, cholar dal , chicken kosha and may more menus are sure to remind you of the  much widely and wrongly used cliche called "Ghar ka khana". The service provided by the restaurant is one of the best in the city. The ever smiling waiters make you feel at home and they seem quiet glad helping you with everything you always wanted to know about Bengali culinary traditions. To sum it up Oh! Calcutta is an experience itself.

Abcos Food Plaza is a highly commendable for the foodie experience. It is a definite go-to Place. The ambience is good. The service is fast. The food is worth your while. The restaurant provides pick-up and drop facilities for group of 6 (negotiable) within Salt lake. All 4 floors of the building have distinct looks and names, but the menu is interchangeable. The drinks are a bit on the pricier side, but food is reaaly a treat for the taste buds. For the mutton lovers, I would definitely recommend the "Elaichi Rann" and for the vegetarians there is "Kaju mattar tawa masala". The Chicken Tandoori is also a must-try. The desrt menu is a bit small, but has variety none the less. 

N.B : it allows discount on Corporate ID cards as well as on Shoppers stop First Citizen cards. Happy Dining! :)
