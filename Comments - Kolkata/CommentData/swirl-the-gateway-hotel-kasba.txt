This is a great place to hang out after having a long day! The ambiance is simply beautiful and mesmerizing. Every table has tiny fire lamps that are really pretty and give a beautiful dim and soothing aura to the place. All their snacks are also organic which was really great to know. I had initially ordered the Jamaican Blossom which was great to have with a burst of all the mingled flavors. My second drink was the Zombie but it tasted pretty much the same as the first drink. I had ordered the Gondhoraj Lemon Grilled Fish and it was absolutely delicious. The sauce was made to perfection with the subtle flavor of the Gondhoraj Lemon - would definitely suggest this dish.

Third grade staff. Most arrogant and belirgent. Think before u go. Can argue even about a table. Avoidable at best. I understand the hotel is on sale and I m not surprised.........

Lovely decor, which furnishes a very exotic feeling.  It's a wonderful place for couples definitely. The only disadvantage I found here was that they serve limited food items, as it‚Äôs not meant for proper dining. Grilled fish is A MUST TRY for all.

Cozy, relaxing and exclusive.... That's how I would like to describe this star rated outlet.
The ambience just stands out, and I now intend to be a regular at this place. The entire bar is dimly lit, with lanterns on each table, just very soothing to your eyes. The starters they offer are too brilliant.
A must visit for all.

Went there yesterday just to have a relaxing weekend. We order beer with pan fried fish,chilli chicken. Best thing about this place is you get unlimited snacks when you order any alcoholic drinks! And those snacks include badam and cheese bites of high quality. Food was okay! Not that great and lacked quantity! But you get to enjoy here relaxing time out from crowd ! Soothing music plays on the background which is nice!

Visited Swril @The Taj Gateway Hotel on a rainy Sunday evening for the very first time. Bit small, but has a really nice cosy ambiance! The beers were served chilled, the steak onion bruschetta and Kohzi porichathu were really amazing. The staffs seemed generous, but overall thumps up for the quality of food and the ambiance! Nice place if you are on a date! üòâ

Well, some people might laugh me off after reading the below review. Still, fully aware of this fact, I publish my review of this place as below:-

I had bought a couple of passes from bookmyshow to a comedy event destined to be held @ Swirl‚Äôs, The Gateway Hotel, Kasba. Unaware of what awaited us, we entered this ‚Äúlounge‚Äù @ around 8 pm, only to realize that it‚Äôs actually a lounge. Since both ‚Äì my friend and myself neither drink, nor smoke and no non- veg either, this place had little on offer for us. Also, the fact that we were already quite full after a delayed high-tea @ the bakery of the same hotel. We began feeling quite uncomfortable and were planning to leave very soon.

We felt glad when we were served with a couple of bowls of cheeselings as well as peanuts ‚Äì as is the standard practice in lounges ‚Äì and mind it, this entire review is solely based on the above 2 complimentary items (my sincere apologies for doing so). The bowls were so huge that even 4 heads can‚Äôt eat all of them ‚Äì and we were just the 2 of us! These complimentary bowls turned out to be great pass-time for us before the comedy show and great munches during the comedy show! Initially, we were seated on a royal sofa, but relocated to wooden chairs and tables ‚Äì on request, when a much larger group joined in!

Ambience is pretty cool, fine Holly numbers playing in the background and service is great. D√©cor is magnificent and yes, now I definitely feel like visiting this place someday and taste a mocktail/ starter or two.

Amazing place to hangout and grab a few drinks. The ambience is just what you need on a lazy Sunday afternoon/evening. The music matches the mood of the place. Had the steak and onion bruschetta which was one of the best finger foods I have had in the recent past. The staff are courteous. Pertinent to mention that this place is offering one of the best happy hours offers that one will see in Kolkata. Overall a great experience.

Cozy place..good ambience and good service. Well stocked bar with some good offers. Overall nice place to hangout with friends. But not too big..in fact small lounge inside The Gateway Hotel in EM Byepass. Lighting, muzic, decor, etc. overall nice experience. You can relax and enjoy drink for long hours.

Decent bar and a good place to hang out near Ruby. Decent menu and offering - but very unlike Taj services. Extremely slow and inefficient by Gateway standard.

'Had' to visit 3 times with a friend - who somehow fell in love with this place & their couches üòâ

Apart from their brilliant service and personal attention extended by stewards & stewardess, starters are 'OK' & beverages are as usually 'priced' as per star hotel standards !!! 

First 2 times we had the luck to enjoy the serene ambience with soft background music playing out there, which is what you might look out for where you can discuss issues (work/business wise, not personal issues to be resolved at this cost üòú) in a relaxed environment. 3rd time, a group of young guys & girls had a pre-fixed hang-out there at one corner, which made the place so noisy, we decided to avoid the place going forward ...

From there we shifted to the adjacent Dinner hall for buffet...spread was regular...however tasty. 

Overall rating hence can not be more than 4/5.

Ambience is great but the food is average. Even though I visited this place only to have brewed drinks but still I think it's a good place to go on a first date only if both r into drinking and have a heavy wallet. Otherwise go with a big group and have fun :)

One of the worst bar I have ever been. I don't know why but I felt like they are behaving like a wannabe 5 star. No wonder why it was eerily empty and silent.
I felt like I just wasted my time and money. I spent less than 30mins there and I was off. Thumbs down big time!!

Stumbled upon this place on a night when beer was desperately needed at 11PM around Ruby hospital. Luckily that day happened to be a Saturday - the live music day! Have been there on two more occasions - nonSaturdays - when the tables with candles were mostly vacant. Located inside the Gateway Hotel next to the all-night non-alcohol-serving Buzz, this place deserves to have a much better PR manager! The place is beautiful, the staff cordial and the music nice. The prices are decent too - 250 bucks for a pint of Heineken, 400 for Jager. If only they could do something about their weird seating when except a couple of tables, people dont face the band on Saturdays!

Visited this by chance being invited by my friends who were performing a live gig on its small stage. The place seemed a wannabe someplace else but lacked the spirit. Very costly and not worth the money.    Since it was little crowded I decided to avoid Credit card and pay cash but had to stand till my beer was hot to get the change. I will still prefer to fight for a parking space and go to some place else though swirl is quite close to my house.
However I want to give it another try because one visit is too soon to judge and also I did not try its food.

I think this lounge was an after thought . Cramped for space , this place lacks energy. There is a small pad for live gigs but you can't see it from the alley where you sit. Cocktails and food is good though. Not my kind of place...

A quick takeaway from their Deli beside this pub after tonight's launch. Although renaming it to Sin.
2 pastries
All that glitters is not gold.
Same goes for the pastries too.
Very mediocre.
150/- for the 2.

Swirl is an excellent bar, with excellent embience. Reasonable prices. Fresh beer was excellent.

Been there again on 9th November with 2 of my friends. The draught beer was excellent, tasted like fresh beer. But the side dish of Chilli Chicken was disappointing. Overall ambience was excellent.

Swirl is located inside The Gateway Hotel & Resorts and it is a part of the Taj Brand. The restaurant features a chic design with its contemporary look although at a glance you will not get the feelings of 5 star properties. From my view it‚Äôs a wide passageway converted in to bar, but they have wide range of drinks and food. Raise a toast in this fine lounge bar in Kolkata with beckoning high sofas looking over low tables. Sitting arrangements were really comfortable and relaxing. Staffs were friendly and greet you with a smiling face. We had Beer to drink and for starters we tried ‚ÄòKajoli Fish Fry‚Äô, ‚ÄòKothimbir Aloo‚Äô, ‚ÄòGateway Bruschetta‚Äô, ‚ÄòCafreal Murg Tikka‚Äô, ‚ÄòBangladeshi Chatu Fry‚Äô & ‚ÄòSammi Kebab‚Äô. Food was excellent; especially Cafreal Murg Tikka & Kothimbir Aloo, drinks and starters go together like bread with butter, Victoria with lingerie and Spongebob with his squarepants. If you want this killer gastronomic enjoyment - you must visit this place.

To much on we called for a shami kebab which was perfectly done... Yummy! Was very happy with the service too! Loved it! :)

A small but cozy place that is made warm by the hospitality of the guys who man the place. The decor is spartan and simple yet makes someone entering the place get the feeling that they have come to the right place and their search for a watering hole has definitely ended!

The seats are arranged in the form of a single row of workstation like structure -ƒèrink-station, i thought it should be names, that provides a sense of privacy yet it is not completely cut off. For those who love to have their drink with their feet up on the sofa, there is the sofa while there's the stool for those who wish to sit ramrod straight while downing their poison! In short, a relaxed ambience that allows you to gulp down your drinks in company of friends and loved ones! The only negative thing in my opinion is the fact that the space is limited and if you decide to treat more than four friends, you might feel a little constrained inside these drink-stations!

There's anorher good news for beer guzzlers-this place serves draught beer and I felt like jumping in joy and hugging the waiter when he suggested that I try a plate of chicken momo with a tall glass of draught beer! 

Thank you Swirl and its staff for providing me with the right ambience and food to catch up with an old friend!

I would definitely go back the second time....and many more times in future!

The Lounge Bar at the Gateway Hotel ( part of the Taj Group) is a nice place. Stopped by for a quick drink to say hello to a friend who was staying there and I quite liked the ambiance and vibe of the place. Service was good very attentive actually and  the bartender was good. My friend was drinking a cocktail called Black Russian and absolutely loved it. A nice place to go chill.
