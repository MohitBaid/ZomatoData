Its close to my place, went there multiple times, they are doing really good, and improving a lot. Regarding service, if you order south indian dishes, it will be served quickly and taste is awesome especially dosas and chutneys, dahi vada can be better, often the vadas are stiff, however if pointed out they will replace immediately. Coming to other foods, the north indian dishes are tasty and decoration and garnishing are magnificent. But they take good amount of time to serve. However, biryani can be improved vastly, lacks taste. Keep it up. Its pocket friendly, no separate GST, only to pay the menu price. Staffs are polite and manager is courteous.

A quaint place tucked in the by-lanes of Calcutta. This new restaurant is at a 2 mins  walking distance from Acropolis Mall. 
The ambience as well as the team looking after this place is extremely welcoming and pleasant.

Bhoj Bilash serves North Indian, South indian and Bengali dishes. 
So if you are looking for a quick dosa snack  or would like to enjoy a full-course bangali lunch and savour on Bhetki paturi or wish to enjoy lip-smacking kebabs this is the place to go.

Try this place if you are in this part of this city, rest assured you would be mighty pleased with the platter laid in front of u.

We had a wonderful experience at bhoj bilash with the food service and pricing. I had gone with my family and found the dishes like tikka kebab and boti kebab superb the Bengali items like pabda storage post bars was very nicely done. The Indian items like dam makhni and chicken afghani my brother ordered was also very well cooked... Overall we had a good time at a very reasonable rate.

This place is a sister concern of Bell Peppers, situated bang opposite to it. The management has segmented the cuisines available in the two restaurants: while the former deals with Indian fare, the latter is devoted exclusively to Chinese food. We decided to check out this new eatery after Pujo, and it proved to be surprisingly good. We ordered Tandoori roti, Stuffed Paneer Naan, Bhoona Mutton and Kolhapuri Chicken. We has specifically asked the Tandoori roti to be nicely done, but when it arrived we found that it wasn’t crisp enough….only tolerable. The other three items were delectable, so for the most part it was an enjoyable experience. I just wish they prepared their Tandoori rotis better!
                    

P.S.  I read in one of the previous reviews that they didn’t serve finger bowls to a patron. It didn’t happen with us, and they placed the bowls promptly once we finished our dinner.

Not a good place in terms of food quality and service.
Pathetic service,even an extra order of single roti takes minimum 15 minutes.
Untrained staffs, they don't know how to talk to guests.
If you ask for finger bowl they will tell you to go to washroom.
If you wish to pay the bill through card they will tell you to go to the nearby ATM.
There are lot more better options available on that locality.

Location: Kasba, near Acropolis Mall. Take the opposite lane of Acropolis from there it's a 1 minute walk.

Ambience: it is a quite small place. Ambience is nice.

Service:  Staffs are polite. But their service is very slow. 

Food: food was quite good, pocket friendly without any tax with good quantity. Food was fine nothing extraordinary but good.
