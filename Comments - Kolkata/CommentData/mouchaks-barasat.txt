Good food. Decent price and good behaviour. But there is no washroom. They are doing their business for years, but do not have the common sense to construct a washroom for the customers. 
They recommend the customers to use the washroom of the adjacent cinema hall.
It's really pathetic

A cool place to dine nearby barasat. I would recommend one to visit if they are from barasat or visit barasat for some purpose. It would not be wise to spend on your commute only to have food there. It is a cozy family restaurant and have variety food cuisines. Service is good and the food quality is worth the value. Serving time is also swift with availability of air conditioners, comfortable lighting and furnitures. It is in the premise of chhayabani movie hall so one can also watch movie. We had barbecue chicken and reshmi kabab. It was tasty and pocket friendly.

Don't go in there. There was time when this restaurant used to be good. But now their egos ​have grown to an extent where they started to do partiality. Only regular customers are allowed to have better services. Others have to pay their bills on the counter and they will not even provide a bill for it. Worst experience ever.

Had to choose this place for lunch as I was in the area and was just famished. For the locality, this is a decent place. Just across the street from their original famous Mouchak sweet shop.
The air conditioning was a relief from scorching heat.

Reasonably priced place has moderate decor. They know what kind of customers visit and have accordingly adjusted.

Made a mistake of ordering manchow soup, but they served hot and sour one which was revealed in the bill. Filled with green chillies, ginger was horrble. Couldn't even eat half of it. Eateries in northern Kolkata think tasty = spicy, and a well made dish is just spicy.

But thank God their paneer butter masala and masala kulcha saved us. The quantity was less than what we are used to at Kolkata side, but this is Barasat. Though the paneer pieces were good and soft.
Size of the kulchas was a bit smaller but it was actually quite tasty and soft and pretty good.

Pocket pinch : 350/-

Might actually visit the place again if I'm in the area.

It used to be a nice restaurant for food lovers in Barasat but, now the quality has been dramatically decreased. Quantity with respect to the price is horrible. The sizzlers they are selling with such high price range, god knows how can someone consider those as sizzlers!

Went to meet a friend at Chapadali. As there are lack of restaurant options, my friend suggested that we eat here. The entrance is through a dingy market place, however being a popular eatery of that area, the localites know this place well. The decor is basic like that of a regular eatery in the suburbs. Pretty clean. The waiters were courteous. Since it was the Christmas evening, they gave us complimentary cakes and candies. That was a sweet gesture.

We started off with chicken Thai soup, followed by reshmi kebab, malai kebab, plain kulcha and paneer butter masala. The food presentation was basic, as expected, however they did a good job in the departments of food quality, quantity, and taste. The malai kebab was reshmi kebab drizzled with fresh cream, but it tasted fine. The butter paneer was nk way close to authenticate however whatever it was, it was delicious (could have been a little less oily though).

Of course I wasn't expecting a fine dining experience here, however, in compared to the similar restaurants and eateries, this place is pretty decent. Hence a 4 rating.

Mouchak is a a decent multicuisine restaurant at Barasat area. Located at the Chayabani movie Ha area they caters decent food at a very low price. 

Quite popular among the students they have made kept the prices challenging. Though they have both the options but I have tried their Chinese cuisine and quite liked it.

The crispy chicken was tasty and the quantity is good as well. Along with that fried rice and chilli fish was also lovely to have in main course. I really liked the service and very polite. But the ambiance is not that great if you are looking for good ambiance but for food definately a good choice.

Decent place for dinning in Barasat. Popular among nearby college goers. Tried numerous items here. The Chinese menu is marginally better than the north Indian counter parts. We recommend Dragon Chicken for spicy food lovers and their chicken noodles for the rest. Biryani is okayish. Service is polite.

During my college days that place was our destination for big treats. We used to love their biriyani, they had some unique aroma in their biriyani which I can't compare with any other biriyani junction so far. Apart from biriyani Chinese foods are also great we had chopsey, rice, crispies but I don't recommend their noodles to try out I didn't like that.

Shabby sitting area, dark, they wanted to make it romantic but backfired. Had fried rice which was good. Crispy chicken as starters were good too. But the letdown was lamb in oyster sauce. The lamb was ruubery, juiceless. Felt like i was eating a chewing gum whose juice have been sucked out. Also the price is no way less.

It is one of those few descent restaurants in this town. Price is also descent compared to quantity. Coming to quality, known dishes are OK. I would advise not to try something out of the box even if it is there in the menu card. As long as I tried dishes like biriyani, chilly chicken, mutton kima, kadhai chicken, chicken bharta, mixed fried rice, noodles, crispy chilly baby corn - they were good enough. But it was a disaster when I dared to order chello kebab!! It was my fault I believe that I expected so much from them. 

Service is good.

Easy to locate this place coz its in the ground floor of the chayabani market, knc road Barasat Mouchaks is one of the best restaurant at Barasat area. I have visited there with my colleague in the evening. We have tried mainly Chinese food there. The food quality is good and the price is reasonable... If you are out for pandle hopping in Kali puja then Mouchak's is a good place for lunch and dinner.. Though its a family restaurant so you can easily visit here with your family and children..

First of all this restaurant is located in Barasat not in Dumdum. The stuff is well behaved but service is little slow during rush hour. But couples are being watched all time by Moody manager from cash counter. Biriyani is good in taste. We ordered chicken varta and nun kulcha which was awesome. The decor is not so good. You can visit for the tasty food only.

Been here a numerous occasions. Arguably the best restaurant in barasat. Try the uncommon and unfamiliar items too... High chances are there to be surprised... In a good way of course...ha ha ha... Only drawback is the waiting time... Minimum 25-30 minutes you have to wait, for a normal diner... And the waiters and the manager is a bit moody too... But the quality of food compensates everything. Big thumbs up from my side

This is located just next to Barasat's Chayabani Cinema Hall. They serve authentic Bengali food throughout the day and also serve Rolls & Moghlai in the evening. 
I have been there twice for lunch. They serve you good food in style, in proper 'kansha' plates, bowls & glasses. They have a huge list of authentic vegetarian curries, chops/bhaja and fish but only two types of chicken/mutton. You can taste both West Bengali & East Bengali fish preparations here (Chitol Myutha etc). The fish is fresh and why wont it be, a huge local wholesale fish market in Barasat. The Chicken / Mutton dishes are a bit too oily and coloured in red chilli powder. Their pricing policy is much like Bhojohori, each dishes priced seperately ranging from Rs 20 to Rs 200. A bowl of rice costs Rs 30 and some Golda Chingri costs around Rs 200.I prefer visiting this place over Bhojohori Manna (which also has a shop in Barasat where I have also visited twice for lunch ). 1. Bhojohori serves you food which are prepared in their "Central Kitchen" in Kolkata and delivered to them. Here they make it fresh everyday.2. Bhojohori shows you a huge list of items but on asking them, they say 'not available' for 80% of the dishes. Here they have all the dishes.
