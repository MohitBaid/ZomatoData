The place is amazing with the food is justified with the pricing, the portion served is enough for 3. The place plays an outstanding music and it's based on Kolkata tram theme, the place has got a private room for small get together which is a big plus point for party people who needs a separate place or some kitties

Very rarely found combination of a pure Veg cum bar restaurant with availability of shisha... It has separate sitting area for the family dining , bar area n shisha n dj zone... Ambiance is based on d legendary vehicle of Kolkata- Tram.. In food v tried north Indian... Starters like crispy chilli baby corn, corn cheese balls, stuffed mushroom were good... Veg Au-Gratin was really hot n cheesy.. In main course one who love to hv salads den must try ceaser salad .. Jain food is available n is tasty too... Paneer, Dal, Malai kofta, veg Jaipury all were served in proper quantity n all were served wid different n appropriate gravy which was delicious.. among d refreshing drinks der r many options which u can try.. Shisha was good... Overall a wonderful experience wid dj playing d music in d background... Pocket pinch is around 700 per head without alcohol... Definately a must visit dis place to try sumthin new.....

Cons:
1. Apparently, this is a disco-pub, but has a tiny dance floor, which wouldn't fit more than 5 people at once
2. This place asks for a membership, before serving, so opting for a membership is Mandatory, before you visit
3. The happy hour menu is a farce and has no cocktails and only 30ml portions of rather low rated alcohols such as old monk
4. Serves only vegetarian food
5. The staff forgets orders and comes back after 15minutes
6. Serves only brownies for desserts although has a page dedicated to it on the menu book
7. The tables are very uncomfortable. In fact the cabanas are not even worth 2 people sitting on opposite sides.
8. Obviously the place is overpriced and unreasonably so
Pros:
1. Location is easy to identify, almost adjacent to Quest
2. Taste has not been compromised although the food is vegetarian

I had to visit Tram Deepo on a friend's obstinate insistence. The very fact that the place is vegetarian depressed me. We ordered:
1. Veg Florentine (tasted good and had generous extents of cheese)
2. 2 units of 60ml Old monk
3. Rasna Hookah (which lasted 12minutes flat, coal change was unreasonably expensive)
4. Brownie with ice-cream

I think the management is confused, if they should have a posh night club or a cafe with old Calcutta charm, thus 2 parts of the restaurant have conflicting ambiences.

Ambience is really good. One thing I really liked about this place is that they have seperated hooka area from dinning area completely so you can take your kids, elderly there without being uncomfortable. Food is of good quality & there are quiet a few options to choose from. If you love to drink then you will like this place, specially during happy hours 😊. If they could have included wine in their happy hour menu then would have loved it but anyway you cant get everything you want. Staff are very polite. So to conclude a place worth visiting, with friends & family.

Me with a friend were in Ballygunj and had some time to kill so decided to come to this place . We purchased a deal from Little and sat in one of those tram themed compartments .

We had Khus Chilli Mojito which was not at all good . It literally was too spicy :P The virgin Mojito was good .

The Mexican Quesadillas tasted amazing with that tangy mango dip . I was in love it 😍

A cream of Mushroom Soup was served which was good but not the best .

We ordered the Red Thai Curry and Penne Pasta for the main course . The pasta was lipsmacking but the thai curry was pretty average .

Had Brownie with icecream for dessert which can never go wrong 👍

Also ordered a Mint Hookah which was nice .

The service was good . So was the ambience .

Uber cool place, first of all. I would like to focus on the fact that the cost of Mayonnaise dip was 'chargeable'. Moreover, the cost was no less than that of a full jar. So, basically I paid much more for the dip than the cost of my food. Funny, isn't it? Guys, please look into the matter.

Went for lunch..As soon as we were given table the manager came and asked us whether we have tram deepo membership card or not..when i said no they said its mandatory and without card you cant have food here..the charge for the card is Rs 49..

Coming to ambience it was ok but the music was extremely loud here which was not only uncomfortable to us but also to other people...the person sitting on the table behind me asked the manager to low down the volume of music but instead they increased the volume more and said that they cannot reduce it..the gap between table nd chair on both side is quite huge because of which you have to speak loudly to hear each other in such high volume music..

The service is pathetic...i have ordered cheese fondue..After 10 mins of serving cheese fondue on the table the waiter bought candle to keep it hot..Same thing happened for fresh lime soda...They served it without straw and we have to ask them 3 times for the straw..Food was average..From the starting till the end we were not served the glass of water inspite of telling them..

Better to visit other good cafes at this budget..

The place looks good with decent décor and the little app deals go well along with it. We ordered :
4 beers (kingfisher strong) (375ml)
1 starter, 1 paneer tikka kabeb and a virgin mojito.
The biggest reason why I took away 1.5 rating is because it only serves vegetarian food.
And you have a make a membership card for a charge of Rs 50 (one time) it's mandatory. Doesn't matter if you're gonna come back or not, the membership card is a must -_-

Firstly, one of the weird things is you have to become a member to eat here, so you have to fill up a form and pay some money. When I refused, they offered it for free. Did not understand that part.
Moving on to the food, there are few Veg-only restaurants in Kolkata, so nice to see another option on the map. The food is actually pretty good. We tried the kebab platter, kiwi mocktail, lasagna, one of the burgers and a risotto and most of it was pretty good. The lasagna was a little disappointing though, especially the very small size. The kiwi drink was very nice. All else was great. 

The decor is also quite nice, with Kolkata themed decorations and board games. 
Overall, a very decent place, maybe a little on the costly side. But if you are a vegetarian in Kolkata, you can give it a shot.

Nothing much to say .. Quite very disappointing because cafe are taking too much precausions these days, which is gud but it should be ask or informed to the costomer on door rather then after they r settled on table

FOOD - is gud .. full marks to the chef n team

HOOKAH - one of the worst hookah every had as the flavour was also not coming out properly and while having hookah i could feel water in my mouth. So ZERO for the hookah person. 

INTERIOR - As i m an interior designer .. i can say that the tables r way to uncomfortable. They occupy so much space tat where the owner could afford  comfortable 6-7 6-seater table , thier they only hav 5 tables .. tat to way huge making two people far apart  n then they hav to talk loudly which makes the place quite noisy ... low marks to interior

It has inhouse DJ which is quite a game changer in usual bar cum cafes. They charged us Rs. 49/-  for a mandatory membership though the waiter couldn't tell us its possible benefits.

We came here for 3 times in a week time expecting the staff behavior to change with time but it got worse. On the first time all AC was faulty but this can be considered as this is a technical issue but the main concern is the staff. The manager(I guess name is Debasis) here is too rude and don't know a single word about hospitality. On the second day they took 25 mins to get the final bill. On the third day, Music was extremely loud here which was not only uncomfortable to us but also to other guests sitting there and it was actually hurting ears. We suggested Mr. Debasis to lower down the volume a little bit to which he replied too rudely that he won't lower down the volume by even a single point and we can leave if don't like the music.

PS: Ambience is good, staff is pathetic. We are breaking up with Tram Deepo.

A nice cosy dine in near the ballygunge ice skating ring. A place for veggies but an absolute delight.
They provide separate lounge for drinking..
The dine in area is quite a place to hang out with family. Great ambience. Services can be slightly improved..we tried pesto paneer tikka and dahi kebab, veg jaipuria & kadhai paneer and veg lasagne.
Each and every dish was simply devine to my taste buds.. Do try their mojitos.. We had orange basil and watermelon mojitos... And the cherry on the top was their amazing brownie with ice-cream.. Don't you dare miss this in house special if you are a dessert lover.

Loved the food and the ambience of the place..

Food - 4/5
Ambience - 4/5
Hospitality- 4/5
Price - 3/5 (found a bit costly considering the number of people each dish served)

Pros - Liked the cheese fondu,Platter..

Cons - Something not related to food,but we were charged Rs. 49 extra stating that it was a mandatory membership which we had to take.Unsure if this is true/False..

Overall a good experience 🙂

Staff is really helpful n sweet ... We dropped there when it was raining heavily ... Unexpected thing was one of the staff guy was at the gate to help the diners to come out of their cars n move into the building ... Its really nice ..
Now ambience and environment super energetic super amazing ... Loved it ..
Food is amazingly tasty here specially red sauce risotto(delicious) and Au-gratin ... Very well cooked and served quickly .. we also had Bar-b-q sandwich which wasn't that good .. it wasn't grilled properly n wasn't hot ...
We also had mocktails which were very refreshing , watermelon mojito , tram deepo special , virgin mojito and green apple mojito ...
Very nice experience and looking forward to come soon...
Keep up the good work ... The good work is to feed people great food with fun ambience ...

Personally didn't like the Chinese dishes as the taste wasn't great and in addition to this the mojito was too sweet to taste.. Hookah was fine.. Valet service available.
Additional Info : U need to register urself with an annual card for which they charge just 49rs...(mandatory).

This place was more of a sudden visit.. not a hardcore veg fan.. but decided to try some veg food on the eve of my bae's bday..

Location :- Just 3mins walk from quest mall towards ballygunje phaari.. It will be on the left.. and vice versa if you r coming from the opposite direction..
A lot of parking space.. so not an issue..

The restaurant is on the 2nd floor.. you can either take stairs or opt the lift..

Ambience :- this place is basically divided into two genres.. One for fine family dining.. and the other for sheesha lovers and clubbing... as we didn't want to have sheesha so we opted for the former one... As soon as you enter it will awstruck you.. well lit large space to seat.. as the place was empty we had the option to chose our seat.. soft cushions.. fine white cutlery.. and a giant screen in which india vs sl was played...

Food :- Not much of a veg lover but still on their recommendation tried the below mentioned dishes..

1 ) Dahi Kebab :- It was the best kebab I have had.. simply lipsmacking.. (I am in love with it more than the chicken or mutton kebabs) it was a perfect blend of yoghurt and spices... With apt proportions.. spicy.. soft.. juicy.. (10/5) Highly recommended

2) chilli garlic fried rice :- the rice itself is a standout dish.. kudos to the chef for making such a dish.. you can have the dish alone without any accompaniment.. rght amount of spices.. veggies.. everything was sumptuous.. The quantity was enough to fill two hungry souls imo.. (5/5)

3) Veg manchurian :- This dish was also quite good.. But I personally felt that it lacked something.. and the veg balls were quite hard and smell of cabbage was quite annoying.. but the gravy was too tasty.. (3.5/5)

4) Brownie with ice cream.. :- we were full but how can anyone help without a delicious dessert.. It was simply lipsmacking.. delicious.. The presentation was 😍😍😍😍 (100/5)

Overall this was my first visit to a veg restaurant but it made our special day really special...❤❤

Staff :- the service was quite prompt.. They took a good care of us..

P:s :- Please do change the plates after starters.. its quite annoying to have main course over the same plate.. so please keep it in mind...

They do serve alcohols now..

Price is on the higher side.. as they have changed the price of each item.. around 40 to 50 rs per item.. They do charge 18% GST.. but the money spent is worth th quality of food and the ambience...

Please Don't visit the place if u are not a member of Tram Deepo.When u visit the place they will ask  u to take a membership of the place and if u dont take the membership u cant even sit there.Very rude and didn't even expect this.Hope you change this type of behaviour.Felt very disrespectful when the manger asked us to leave only for the sake of membership.This type of behaviour from the place is very unapproachable.

Excellent place. The ambiance is very good. We were four friends . There are 2 zones,one where there was music along with the dance floor and one area was only sitting with soft music being played. We sat in the second zone. It was awesome. The choice of the old songs was excellent in fact one of the best I have heard in recent times Only sad part was that the place was not full.only 2 tables were occupied. Might be people do not know much about it. Food was excellent .Helping and portions should have been little more. Overall a wonderful place to spend your evening. Loads of games and books were there to spend your time. All in all a must visit place. I would certainly visit again and recommend it all my friends

Sumptuous Veg Luncheon @ Tram Deepo, Kolkata ☺

Of late, Kolkata is witnessing a sudden burst of thematic vegetarian restaurants, which also provide enough Jain food options i.e. food items sans onion and garlic.

Budding city restauranteurs are coming up with innovative design concepts, so as to provide, an interesting and indulging environment to their diners.

While Fly Couzina enthralled the vegetarian brigade with it's interiors modelled on the lines of an aeroplane, Tram Deepo has bursted the city scene with it's interiors based on - tram lines, tram depots and tram interiors!

Tram Deepo is an extremely well designed 3500 square feet (approximately) restro-pub that occupies the second floor of the same building, that houses Computer Wizards on it's ground floor. Lying on the same side of the footpath, as that of the Quest Mall, this building is just a few steps away from the aforesaid Mall (towards the Ice Skating Rink).

The moment you enter Tram Deepo, you are greeted by the city roads look-alike asphalt flooring, complete with pot holes and tram lines!

Currently, the restaurant is divided into four kinds of dining area - QSR i.e. Quick Service Restaurant, Lounge Area, Bar Area and Private Area.

A mega 6*6 ft. projector showcasing songs etc. has been installed centrally, so as to, provide entertainment to the diners occupying the QSR and the adjoining Bar area. The QSR seating comprises of well designed and comfortable chairs, high chairs and couches. The Bar section is quite long and is lined with a considerable number of bar stools. Along side the usual seatings, the Lounge area also houses a number of cubicles, named after assorted tram depots. The Private Area is sound proof and can house upto 50 guests. It has a separate projector and music system. The minimum cover charge for booking the Private Area is around 12 K.

In Tram Deepo, interior decor is of good quality and the dominant color scheme is black and brown. The lighting is quite well planned. It's not on your face, keeps intact the black Gothic feel and doesn't temper with the visibility of menu and food!

The restaurant also houses a DJ console, though it's yet to acquire it's bar license.

Tram Deepo's menu primarily comprises of - hot & cold beverages, mocktails, salads, starters and main course dishes from Indian, Oriental, Mexican and Continental Cuisines, and desserts.

The dishes presented during the tasting session were -

- Mocktails -

- Watermelon Mojito and Orange Basil Mojito (Rs. 149/- each): Two long and slender glasses came more than half filled with the concerned mojitos, followed with the pulpy mush of the concerned fruit and some mint leaves, topped with respective thin fruit slices, a sprig of mint and a solitary piece of canned cherry.

I tried the former one. It tasted nice, refreshing and provided good company till the food arrived. The latter one was consumed by the accompanying PR lady. She liked it as well.

- Tram Deepo Special Mocktail (Rs. 209/-): This mocktail was ordered mid meal, so as to counter the dryness associated with rich Indian food.

Served in a similar type of glass, it was kind of 'on the rocks' aka more than half filled with ice cubes and had a beautiful shade of pink. It's visual appeal was further ensured by the presence of a big sprig of mint, thin lime slices and a canned cherry.

It tasted nice and went well with the Indian Course

- Salad -

- Caesar Salad (Rs. 199/-): It was the usual concoction of romaine iceberg lettuce and bread croutons, drizzled in Caesar dressing and garnished with a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese. Shaped in a mound and infused with other greens, it came in a generous portion.

It tasted crunchy, fresh and nice. However, the sprinkling of cheese was a tad bit on the higher side.

- Starters From Assorted Cuisines -

- Mushroom Fritters (Rs. 239/-): A pill shaped wooden tray came laden with triangular shaped and bulbous Mushroom Fritters, along with a small black bowl of chilli and mayonnaise based dip. The fritters were garnished with a scanty spread of cheese and coriander leaves. They were made up of - chopped and sauted mushrooms, cheddar cheese, jalapeños and bell peppers and were coated with crumbs before frying. 

The cooked mushrooms were soft, chewy and emitted a nice flavor. Overall, fritters were quite well cooked and tasted very nice. The dip was also nice.

This dish is apt for the ongoing monsoons.

- Corn And Spinach Quesadilla (Rs. 239/-): A compartmentalized and customized wooden tray came laden with four quadrant shaped portions of deep fried fajita bread, stuffed with cheesy corn and spinach filling. The condiments comprised of three small black bowls of salsa, sour cream and Chef's special dip (bean sauce).

The entire dish was well cooked and presented. It tasted excellent The Chef's special bean sauce was really good.

- Veg Lasagne (Rs. 269/-): It was the usual layering of pasta sheets and vegetables, topped with a generous serving of melted mozzarella. It was garnished with some dark colored sauce, chopped greens, a fried edible leaf and fried noodle sticks.

The vegetables were abundant in quantity and retained their original color. This dish was a boon to the cheese lovers. It tasted excellent.

- Indian Main Course -

- Paneer Butter Masala (Rs. 279/-): A moderate sized, low height black ceramic bowl came filled with clay oven roasted cottage cheese chunks cooked in tomato and cashew gravy. It was garnished with some chopped coriander leaves.

The cottage cheese chunks were fresh, chewy and spongy. The gravy was well seasoned and balanced in taste. The quantity served was good enough for 4-5 people and tasted excellent. Jain version of this curry was also available.

- Veg Jaipuri (Rs. 259/-): A black metallic rectangular wok came filled with an interesting adaptation of the usual Veg Jaipuri. Herein, instead of mixing a singular gravy along with the spicy mix of fried vegetables, two different gravy preparations were placed atop the veggie concoction, which were further garnished with some grated cheese. The two gravies were - spinach based and cashew based.

The curry tasted quite nice and the portion served was good enough for 4-5 people. Jain version of this curry was also available.

- Pudina Lachcha Paratha (Rs. 59/-): A crisp, shallow fried and layered Paratha was sliced in two semi circular halves and served in a white cloth lined metallic bowl. 

It was relatively big in size and tasted nice.

- Garlic Naan (Rs. 69/-): It was your usual Naan infused with a generous serving of minced garlic. 

Served in a similar fashion like the aforesaid bread, albeit shaped like a big (read massive) tear drop, which was sliced into a semi circle and a pointed triangle, the Garlic Naan tasted fresh and nice.

- Matka Veg Biryani (Special) (Rs. 249/-): A clay vessel shaped like a matka, covered with dough sheath, containing veggie infused steaming Biryani was served along with a small bowl of curd topped with assorted seasonings.

The Biryani was well cooked and not very spicy. It tasted nice.

- Condiments: The Italian cuisine came equipped with tabasco sauce, oregano and red chilli flakes. I did not use any. The dishes were well balanced. These condiments were not required.

The Indian Cuisine came equipped with vinegar onions, green chillies, lime slices and mixed pickle. Like always, I finished off a big portion of the former two.

The staff were crisply uniformed, prompt in service and courteous in demeanour. Background music provided a good rhythm to the ambiance. Overall, the food tasted quite good and promising.

The ambience rather the flooring would give you the feeling that you are strolling in a deepo. It also acts a disadvantage since it makes the seating quite uncomfortable. North Indian is a strict no no. Other cuisines are good.

Tram Deepo 😍
Purchased a coupon from Little App for 2 (Rs 499) which had costed to me Rs 300 because of some discount or cashback !
I wanted to go to this place for such a long time and the wait was really worth of !
The music 😘 The staff were friendly...
We were really hungry and it was the correct decision to land here for lunch 😉
We sat in the hookah area though we didn't have hookah as it was more comfortable !
Here begins with the food :
Starter - Chilli potato - Yummy it was.. Good amount of spices all over.
Soup - Manchow Soup - It was not that much wow but yes, it was good.
Main course with side dish - Veg manchurian with noodles - It was good, not that much spicy. They two had the perfect combination.
Dessert - 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce - Sone pe suhaga thing 😎

I strongly recommend everyone to go here and have a lunch or dinner with their loved ones or give a surprise birthday party 😊 They ll do the decorations with roses balloons in the chamber 🤗

Had been there on my birthday!  And it just surprised me.  Being a pure vegetarian restaurant it didn't disappoint me at all :) The place is really easy to locate. The ambience is just perfect with the perfect amount of light and music!  A lot of seating options available and each has its own beauty!  I just can't stop appreciating the place!  We ordered paneer pesto kebab, cheese fondue (my favourite for the day), Singapore noodles along with Garlic paneer and to end with spicy Cranberry mocktail. The food was on point.  The staffs were courteous too. Overall a well organised service is provided to the customers. Very happy with the entire presentation. It is recommended for all the foodies! Thank you team TD. :)

Amazing Ambiance. Completely justifying the theme, the flooring has tram lines and the graphics Street effect. The wall art is great showing glimpses of Kolkata. They have separate area for hookah. This place has high rised tables and cabin booths with detailing to give you a tram ride ambiance. From Tollygunge to Ballygunge you could sit in your cabin of choice. In the no hookah area there is a projector-screen and TV screens. So definitely apt for game time. Also, there are books and boards games like Jenga etc. The entire restaurant enjoys a view of the Syed Amir Ali Avenue.
Service is good, prompt. Though they need menu cards which are proper and not photocopied. It was difficult reading it.
Food is vegetarian, and had a good number of options. Also some dishes had a Jain preparation option. We tried the Vegetable Lasanga and Corn and Cheese Kebabs. We loved the cheesy lasanga, the kebabs were well flavored and had a decent amount of cheese, though I would have liked a little more.
As for drinks, we got a Brownie Shake and Watermelon Mojito. The presentation of the drinks was good. The mojito was extremely refreshing, though I requested for reduced sugar syrup.
It is going to be about 1100 for two. Portions are good, so it is worth the amount.
It is definitely a must go to place.

A very disappointing experience. Went there to host our friend's bachelorette party and I must say the experience wasn't great. Where do I begin with? The crowd. There was a pretty rowdy bunch of guys and we were a group of 6 girls and we really couldn't dance or stay for long because of the crowd. Not to mention, WHERE WAS THE DANCE FLOOR? They really need to filter their crowd. Next comes the food. We ordered the cheese fondue which was decent, the kebab platter which was alright and they somehow managed to screw up the baby corn. The service wasn't great too. Guess what, they managed to mess up the hookah too. Very very disappointing experience. I have never reviewed a place below 2.5 on my blog, but there's always a first! I really don't know how this place has a 4 star rating. We were misguided by it, hope you aren't too. :)

This vegetarian restaurant is located in Ballygunge near Quest Mall. They have a separate section for dining and a section for hookah lounge. The place looks very classy and well presented with nice quotes and wall hangings.
I went with my friends but we are all meat lovers- we wanted to experiment with veg food. We ordered a Watermelon Mojito which tasted very good and refreshing. Then we took Cheese Fondue which was as cheesy as it could get. The dish was served with crispy bread cruton and veggies. Dipping the crutons in the cheese tasted heavenly. Next, we ordered Aloo Telengana which consisted of Hyderabadi crispy potato tossed with chilli, curry leaves,tamarind, garlic and mustard. The mix was perfect and the potato fries melt in your mouth in no time. Finally ordered mushroom fritters which has chopped sauted mushroom served with cheese, bell peppers, jalapeños. The mushrooms were fried and served with a unique chili sauce. Mushrooms are one of my favourite and I loved the dish. 
The ambience gets full marks, the presentation of the food items are A-one, the food quantity is good and taste is top notch, the price is a bit on the higher side but the food is worth it. A must visit.

My visit to tram deepo was totally unplanned and yet I was happy that I chose to visit the restaurant today. Ambience is quirky, has a separate section for seesha, a full stocked bar and variety of seating arrangement. 

Coming to the food...the menu is impressive, surprisingly all veg menu. Order brownie shake, spinach and corn quesadilla and momo aglio olio. Presentation and taste of the food was great though service was a little slow than usual considering very few tables were occupied. 

Vegetarian foodies could give the resto lounge a try if you are in and around Ballygunge

I visited tram deepo during the ipl season 2017. We went there with a coupon from nearbuy. Though the coupon stated 2 mocktails but they served us cold drinks and gave an excuse of it not being available. The food portions served were good on taste but thumbs down to the quantity served. The sisha was good. And the dj did play good songs. They also have foosball to pass time playing with. Overall a little improvement in service is required. Good ambience.

First of all the name TRAM DEEPO justifies its decor. The place is done up beautifully. 
About food, the starters were fantastic and the best was Paneer Tikka with pesto sauce served with tangy mint chutney. 
In the main course, veg Jaipuri and dal makhani was very tasteful. 
Breads were an absolute delight and Garlic naan and Baked Kulcha worth mentioning. 
Well mocktails need a bit correction. But overall a nice experience and truly worth going again.

This is just a preliminary review for this place. You'll find out why soon enough if you keep on reading.
Tram Depot is as the name suggests themed around Trams. The decor is classy with a lot of wood and even tracks to go along with the theme. I sat in one of the chambers or cubicles they have made and I didn't quite enjoy having to constantly look at the person sitting in the next cubicle so a proper partition would have been better appreciated.
We went there for a short while and didn't really try much on the menu which is why this is a prelim only. The hookah was smooth. And the service is good as well. My overall experience was pleasant and I would definitely want to visit again to try out the other things they offer.
I will update my review as and when I get the chance but this is all for the time being.

As soon As u enter the place it's nostalgic to have your foot on tram lines.decor is well thought and done. Serves Italian Oriental and north Indian cuisine. Had ordered Oriental platter for starters which was very good. Baby corn were perfectly crisp. Lasagne order was below standard. They claimed to be a fusion. However good place to chill out wid frds along wid gud music.
Children below certain age shouldn't be taken along as it has open bar and shisha is also served.

Service is very poor, waiters bringing items one by one in hand they don't even carry tray to serve dishes.
Dull and boring place.
Never visit this place if you are in a good mood because its a literal disappointed.

Visited this place yesterday (11-5-17)to celebrate my son's birthday.We were 2 families with 4 elders & 3 kids.

Pros:
1)Chic Decor,Pub like feel

2)Tasty starter dishes

3)They have games to play (indoor games)

Cons:

1)This place is not for families at all.It is a youngsters hangout with loud music,pub like feel

2)This place is good if you want to have some starters but not suggested for meals.Infact when we ordered main course after having some starters ,they too inordinate delay after several reminders to serve us ! Probably they are not interested in taking orders only for mocktails & starters

3)Inspite of  government guidelines for imposing service charges,they continue to charge @ 8% .On this service charge they add government tax of 20.5% which is absurd.When I objected on paying service charges they removed it by making a handwritten note at the back of that invoice (which I have retained with me)

4)Expensive : A bill of Rs 1909 before tax & service charge becomes Rs 2484 after levies, which means add 30% Price on every dish you order to calculate its price

5)Serving Quantity  of every dish was very less compared to its expensive Pricing

6)Not for small kids -The floor is stony & anyone falling on it with get injured .My son fell down on the floor & got injured badly

7)Although they claim to give valet parking but when I called them after reaching there, after 15 minutes a black dressed "Bouncer" was sent who helped us park our car ourselves, but this is not called "Valet parking "!

Well I would like to point out that the staff lacked proper etiquette to serve a lady. It was pretty disappointing to see that my friend wasn't even offered a glass of water while she was waiting for me for almost half an hour. The water and menu were brought to the table after I walked in. This form of sexist behavior is pretty saddening.
Talking about the food, the food was good. The aroma of paneer and dum aloo was soulful. The mocktail were decent too .

I had gone there on 1st May. First of all the service was simply terrible. The menu stated in Zomato and the one we got at Tram deepo did not match. As soon as we ordered something the waiter said its unavailable, though later on we realized that it was possible. Regarding the food, everything was a mis-match. The Nachos was a let down with completely flat sauces. The beverages too were not up to the mark. The atmosphere, not the best, was considerably good. Though we had gone with high expectations, were let down.

Caribbean Cafe replaced by Tram Deepo and Hit Wicket, both in the same building in different floors - Tram Deepo being in the second floor.

Ambiance is good. They play great dance songs. You can always book a cabin for some privacy.
Staffs are professional and service was prompt.

We had the following mocktails:
Watermelon Mojito
Spice Carnberry
Orange Basil Mojito

• Orange Basil Mojito was my favourite pick of the lot. It had a dominating flavour of Musambi and a very mild flavour of basil complimenting it.

For starters we had:
• Pesto Paneer Tikka was good. I always look for good quality paneer and it definitely did not disappoint.
• Mexican Quesadillas served with three dips and tasted amazingly good.
• Atasi Aloo made an amazing starter. It had a stuffing and one would love it if he/she likes chatpata stuffs.
• Mushroom fritters will surprise you with it's lovely presentation and remind the non-vegetarians of their chicken nuggets.
• Penne Pasta in Roasted Tomato Basil Sauce - Absolutely loved it! The sauce was very well made, full of flavours!

Main Course had:
Paneer Lababdar
Dal Peshawari
Baked Kulcha
Garlic Naan
Lacchha Parantha
Matka Biryani

• Garlic Bread was the best of the lot.
• Matka Biryani - Only dish that needs to be improvised on.

For desserts:
• Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream - This was a delight! The brownie was gooey with generous amount of chocolate sauce and ice cream. Loved it to the last bit!
• Caramel Custard - Not a big fan of Caramel Custards yet it was impressive.

Very much recommended! Do try out their Quesadillas and Pasta on your visit. They're a must have!

As the name suggests, the theme of the restaurant revolves around the much renowned and preserved heritage of Tram system in Kolkata. The decor religiously follow the theme with real asphalt for the flooring along with steel rims that are visually similar to tram tracks. The furniture and interiors have been done entirely in wood giving it more of a subtle look.

Talking about the food, the starters were brilliant. Pesto Paneer Tikka had a distinct flavour. Mushroom Fitters and Asati Aloo were very good. Mexican Quesadillas and Burmese Semolina Balls were also nice.

For the main course, we had Paneer Lababdaar, Veg Jaipuri and Dal Peshawari along with Garlic Naan and Laccha Paratha. Needless to say, everything was so good. Every dish had the right amount of spices and flavours and the breads were optimally cooked.

Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream and Caramel Custard were an amazing pair of desserts to end our delightful evening at Tram Deepo.

One of those rare occasions when I just loved a veg place. Never thought a vegeterian eatary can be so good. Well to be honest I dont visit places where I dont get to get to eat some meat, but yesterday I had to because of few other friends who forced me to visit this place.
I was surprised to have such good veg food at this place. From the service to the food everything was fantastic. I never thought I can ever love food like this.
The decor and the ambience is unique which I loved.
I tried Watermelon Mojito, Spicy Cranberry, Pasta, Dal  Makhani and some Paneer dish.
Each and every dish was superb.
A must visit place for all the veg people and people who are hardcore non vegetarian like me do give a visit.

This place has been open for a pretty long time and a visit here was overdue. Meanwhile they have turned this place from non vegetarian to a vegetarian one. Yesterday came here with a few friends of mine for some dinner and good chit chat. I didn't try their non veg food, so can't share an opinion on that. But I must definitely say, that on this backward journey from non veg to only veg, they have maintained a very high quality of food. The theme is mostly sports based, loud music playing in the background and the sitting area is not very lit up. But we were a big group. So they had arranged a spacious private brightly lit up sitting area for us. The food was excellent. I definitely loved every single item I tried and it was truly brilliant!
Mocktails - 
Spice Cranberry - The cranberry syrup reached a new dimension when treated with chilli powder. It was a twist to a rather sweet drink.
Water Melon Mojito - Very refreshing. Tasted really fresh, a solace to the hearts after a hot summer day.
Appetizers - 
Pesto Paneer Tikka - Treated with basil paste, the paneer was very soft and literally melted inside the mouth. Liked it very much.
Mushroom Fritters - Who doesn't like deep fried things? Filled with nicely treated mushroom fillings, and served with spicy mayo, it tasted excellent.
Mexican Quesadilla - This was out and out brilliant. Quesadilla pockets filled with American Corn, Zucchini in a mayo sauce and served with mayo and sour cream, it was very filling and all of us loved it! 
Burmese Semolina Ball - The semolina ball was served with lots of veggies and semai (don't know the English name). Didn't like it much though.
Main Course - 
Breads - Garlic Naan, Baked Kulcha and Lachchha Parathas were served. All of them were made perfectly and tasted extremely delicious.
Paneer Lababdar - Goodeness, I am still dreaming of its gravy. Rich and thick, still not too spicy to bother your tummy. The paneer was too soft and tasty. I am sure that the cook is an expert in making paneer dishes. 
Veg Jaipuri - The presentation of this dish was really magnificent. Loved it totally as the food was too good!
Daal Peshawri - Served with Malai on top, the daal is something you cannot miss out here. 
Matka Biryani - It is really weird to write about veg biryani. But this one was good. Topped with fried onions and made in a matka, loved the smokey essence in the biryani. And there was aloo. I can't complain!
Desserts - 
Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream - The brownie was baked so well. Topped with rich and thick chocolate ice cream, it was very good actually - gooey and rich. Totally sinful! Presentation of the dessert was just on point!
Caramel Custard - This is the classic caramel pudding. Although the hint of egg was a bit strong but the caramel wasn't too sweet or too bland, just perfect!
The overall experience with the food was very good. Service was courteous. The decor and the ambience is definitely not my cup of tea. But it is a matter of personal choice. Since the food here is extremely good, I am recommending this place to try out for sure! Happy Dining! :)

All the drinks were wonderful and refreshing. Absolutely befitting the summer season.

*Paneer in pesto sauce : This is an absolute smasher. A welcome Change :) 
*Pasta in tomato basil sauce : really delicious.

Main course : 
*Paneer lababdar 
*Dal Peshawari 
*Assorted bread ( loved the garlic naan )

The reason I came to this 100% vegetarian restaurant? Because it's named after the heritage transport system which preserved their old-world charm, adding to the beautiful character of the City of Joy.Kolkata is the only Indian city having operational tram network.

The decor of this place is done similar to a tram depot.There are tramline like tracks on the floor.A huge tram face is on one side.There are paintings for sale too.Since it's the IPL season jerseys of various teams,cricket quotes and giant screens showing love matches have been added.

Food and drinks were brilliant as well.I visited here with a group of friends.Majority of them comprised by non vegetarians.But got bowled over by the culinary delights serve by this place.

Starters

•Atashi aloo- All of us loved this dish.Potatoes were stuffed with nicely seasnicelyottage cheese and chargrilled which added a beautiful smoky flavour profile.

•Pesto paneer tikka-Paneer were soft and well cooked.I wish pesto flavour was a bit pronounced in it.

•Mexican quesadilla-This was so good.It came in with three dips-Salsa, sour cream and spicy cheese.All of them were excellent.The filling of corn and veggies was packed with bold flavours.

•Mushroom fritters- It was served with cocktail dip.A good dish.

•Burmese semolina ball-This was a fresh,light salad.I loved the fragrance of lemon grass cutting through this it.

Main course

Three types of Indian breads came with 3 vegetarian side dishes

•Baked Kulcha-It was soft with masala stuffing

•Garlic naan-It was so good that it didn't even need a side dish to compliment it.

•Lachha paratha-It was usual stuff.

•Paneer lababdar-Its a delight for Indian cuisine lovers.Paneer was soft cooked in gravy which is spicy,buttery,full of flavour.Ticks all the boxes

•Daal peshawari- Similar to daal makhani.Liked it

•Veg jaipuri- This was a bit bland.

•Pasta in tomato basil sauce- Too much tangy for my liking.

We sipped on few amazing mocktails while having such huge spread.

•Watermelon Mojito and Orange basil Mojito- Both the drinks were refreshing and great thing is that they weren't overly sweetened.

•Spicy cranberry-Loved the twist of added masala in it.The contrast of sweet and spicy was very interesting in a good way.

Dessert

Brownie with vanilla icecream-A classic combination.Brownie was served hot.It was nutty,fudgy and everything that a good brownie should be.The bitter dark chocolate flavour was perfectly balanced by the vanilla icecream.

Definitely recommended to come here tocheer for your favourite team and munch on good food with friends.

Tram Deepo is conveniently located opposite to the Ice Skating Rink in Ballygunge, close to Paris Cafe.

This themed restaurant plays good music that will set the mood instantly, the seating arrangements are quite thoughtfully done, giving enough privacy to small/ large groups and couples.

The service is good, could be improved though.

Coming to the food part, this vegetarian restaurant can make a meat lover fall in love with the awesome veg preparations. Quality and taste of food deserve a shout out. Quantity is good enough for 2.

We ordered a number of items. I will list down the must orders here.

My recommendations - Spice Cranberry Mocktail, Mushroom Fritters, Mexican Quesadilla, Baked Kulcha, Paneer Lababdar and Brownie with Vanilla.

Price - Absolutely Reasonable.

Visited this place with some high expectations... I am would say it was good but did not live up to the expectations I had preconceived... The decor is really good but they need to fix the water dripping from the AC vents... music was nice and the IPL season added some excitement to the a little above average food... they really need to create a menu card and need to add more items... the Kit Kat shake and the watermelon mojito was brilliant... the Dal Makhani, veg jhalfrazi was normal nothing special... the starters was also average... all in all a good place to hang out with friends with good music and hookah!!! Service is a tad slow... need to push them for service!!!!

Tram Deepo is amazing. I had gone using a "little app cupon" and selected the continental menu. Our spread comprised of 1 soup, 1 starter, 2 main course, 2 drinks and a dessert, and all this for Rs 599. I have to admit, I have rarely been this impressed. 
The decor and ambiance shows that a lot of thought has gone into making this place. 
We started with the mushroom soup. The colour and the smell of the soup seduced us even before we tasted it. I haven't had this good mushroom soup since Little Italy. Most places can't do it justice, but Tram Deepo does. The Quesilada starter was just OK, but the mango sauce they served it with ruined the taste, and this is the only complaint food wise. Main course consisted of Risotto primavera and pasta in mix sauce. Both were good, but nothing you can't have elsewhere. The dessert had chocolate brownie with ice cream, and that was another winner. The presentation and taste reflected that they knew what they were doing. 
The service was also good, and didn't keep us waiting at all( although I should mention that the place was almost empty since we went during a weekday lunch time). 
Whilst we got a decent deal, in general such a spread would cost more than 700/head. If Tram Deepo is geared towards youngsters, they need to tweak their pricing policy, and perhaps make such combos a part of the regular menu.

We were looking for a place that serves all Jain food. Tram Deepo came to our rescue! We did a takeaway for jalapeno corn cheese balls, paneer tikka, cream sauce pasta, veg pulao with paneer makhna. The food was neatly packed, hygienic and hot when we unpacked it. The jalapeno corn cheese balls were a super hit - soft, full of cheese and had the right amount of jalapeno and cheese. The paneer tikka seemed like a healthy choice but with the right amount of flavor and spices. I'm not a big fan of paneer gravy items but the paneer butter masala tasted wonderful as well. I was also impressed with how liberal the portion sizes were in each of the foil boxes. Overall a very pleasant experience with a cuisine I usually don't try out. Great work team Tram Deepo!

This place is located almost a kilometer away from Quest Mall. It is beside Ice Skating Rink. It is located in the same building in which Hit Wicket Cafe is located.

The ambiance is nicely done up with train bogies concept. Special mention to separate smoking area. Coming towards food, the food was just a BELOW AVERAGE.

Oriental Veg Platter (2.5/5) - Baby Corn was okay and rice was okay too. French fries were decently made.
Mix Sauce (3/5) - AverageSpiced Cranberry (4/5) - GOOD
Virgin Mojito x 2 (3/5) - Average.

This place is a bit costly. We were billed Rs1776 for the above food.

This is a place only for those people who want to Try a new place in Kolkata.

This was a unexpected visit, very well decorated themed restuarant (kolkata's old treasure trams), ambience was soothing divided in two parts.
Now coming to food we have ordered veg platter and trust me the food taste and quality was too good, we ordered two hookah one was candy crush with milk base n d second one was candy with mojito base and both were good.

Nd yes they should start alcohol.
Overall d place was amazing n I wish on my next visit I should get alcohol available there

4.5 for no alcohol
Will visit again

It's a wonderful theme veg restaurant along with a hookah bar suited near Quest Mall ballygunge.
The resturant is situated on the 2nd floor , the elevator opens inside the restaurant. Whenever any one enter in the restaurant a man standing in front of the elevator rangs​ a bell which gives a similar feeling while traveling in tramway.The entire restro is based on tram theme the painting, flooring,lights n others.
The restro is divided in two section one is for only food and other is for hookah n food.
The best thing about the restro is the unique theme, ambiance , sitting area ,disco lighting dance floor along with a DJ makes it one of the rarest place to have all such things in Kolkata .
I have been there with my family couple of times I liked the food quality very much (mouth watering),
It's north indian main course is delicious.They also serve Jain Food.
The quality and flavor of hookah was also very good. They prepare all hookah flavor by themselves.

A really nice place to unwind, great set up matched up with excellent food. Quesadillas were too good, also tried paneer tikka, red Thai curry - could have been a little more flavour in it, noodles, garlic potato & tacos. They don't have a liquor licence yet but great food and excellent hospitality made up for it. The decor and set up is really well done.

It's a theme restaurant. Divided into sections. Went there on Valentine's day with my Fiancee. Well decorated. Ambience was soothing. Service was fast. Food quality and quantity both was good as well as cocktails were properly made. Music was happening.we had ordered Paneer tikka and Aloo bharwa in starters. Platter was worthful. Cocktails and mocktails were yummy.

Tram Deepo, a themed restaurant circling around Kolkata's age old treasure- tram and its concept is situated a few minutes away from Quest Mall. From having tram lines inside the restaurant, the place also has tables set up inside tram cells. Food? Average. 
We had tried their Garlic Cream Spaghetti which was on the bland side. Their Jalapeño Cheese Balls were a bit too heavy and lacked seasoning. We had also ordered one of their shakes, which tasted decent. Although the food here was a bit of a bummer, the prompt service and the warm behavior of the staff quickly made up for that.

First of all a big thumbs up for the theme which justifies the name tram deepo.tram lines on the floor...model of the front of a tram...a big picture depicting kolkata...cabins for couples..cosy chairs...all these were mesmerising surely!now coming to the food ...we had jalapeno cheese balls and irani paneer ..they were good ..but nothing extraordinary ...Going by the price which is definitely on the higher side ....i felt quality and quantity...in both aspects they were lacking.....Anyways if u consider the decor its a must-one-time visit for everyone.

I have visited this place four times and always loved it..
Ambience- Living up to the theme of a tram depot, fab interiors, music at its best. Dim lights and cost corners plus high tables, altogether does justice to the place. The place has three different sections, giving You choices as per your comfort.

Service- Staffs are decent and cheerful, service is prompt, menu is not very elaborate but decent. Though they can up their staff some more.

Food- tried very few dishes and all were very good, special mention for sautéed mushrooms. Hookah is fab, lot of smoke prepared nicely.

Pocket pinch- decent!!

Great depo for veg food. 

Its indeed themed on trams. Got the small lights of trams, seating arrangements named after each depos. Huge space, with good number of servers. In terms of interiors, absolutely appropriate! 
Coming to food, had temple run, virgin mojito, for starters  stuck to crispy baby corn, manchow soup. 
For main course, veg manchurian and chilli garlic fried rice and ended with chocolate mudpie, as desert .
The soup was though, good in quantity but not so great in quality. The soup was neither tangy nor soul full hearty, which is expected in winters. It seemed like knor or any such soup powder mix was used. 
The babycorn on the other side, was great with perfect crunchy outside and good spice.
The fried rice was superb, some great kick from chilly and good amount of golden corn in it. You can have it, without any gravy. Its THAT great. 
The manchurian on the other hand was a downfall. The same manchurian soup was made into gravy, which had some balls which tasted more like bread than veg balls. 
The desert was good though, the brownie/chocolate cake crumbled on marie biscuit crumb with ice cream on top. 
Service was  fast and efficient and every table is given with a tv, 
Theres loads in terms of ambience, but would have been glad, if the food also stood up to that standard.

An addition to kolkata's cafe scene. Located near chaibreaks in ballygunge.On reaching the place we got a vallet slip which i thought was a big tick in the box.Usually places of this genre doesn't provide valet services. It is on the 2nd floor and has a lift on offer. 

The lift directly opens in the cafe. Lovely wooden interiors with a hint design pattern of an irish club. Loved the setup. We sat near the window pane which oversees the road. Seats were comefortable. Btw we had gone to this place when it served non vegetarian food. Just saw some of their social media advertisement stating the place only serves vegetarian food now. 

So We ordered for -
1)galouti kebab
2)fish fingers
3)oreo shake
4)vanilla rasna sheesha

The food tasted yum and presentation was really good. The oreo shake was thick and scrumptious. Coming to the sheesha now it was nice as it had the right balance of vanilla and rasna with dense smoke.

Good place to chill with friends. Slightly on the expensive side but worth it. Will go for a vegetarian feast soon.

This is another one of the themed restaurant in Kolkata. Its located in between Quest Mall and Ice Skating Rink  . Trams and everything related to it is the main stay of the decor here. 

The place has 2 seating areas , one is the normal cafe type and the other has small cabins which have tram depo names on them along with a small dance floor.
My first impression was Woww .. This place is awesome .  Slowly my wow feeling came down slightly. The music was very loud and people cant hear what the other person is saying .
Its tough to get the attention of the attendants if you require something. 

Now for the main part thats food . I would say the food taste is good . But the quantity of food is very less for the amount they are charging . We had ordered the oriental platter costing about 500 bucks but if not sufficient to fill even a single persons stomach . Then we ordered for American corn salt and pepper and Spaghetti Aglio E Olio pasta . We also ordered 2 mock-tails which were also good .

Overall its a once visit place I would say.

Have you ever taken a Tram ride in Kolkata??
If not..you should! As a matter of fact, Its one of the most oldest operating electric tram in Asia and the only city in India to have tram network.. thats the charm of having the oldest culture and its still kept alive!

Tram Deepo is solely based on reviving the old culture and decorating it in tram themed cafe.. Is in proximity to Quest Mall, Ballygunge! The Ambience is super cool.. as one enters there are trams tracks.. proper wooden booth of tram are created.. replica of inside of an actual tram.. and its seating is very comfy! One can actually play those fun kiddish games like scrabble and uno etc etc.. It celebrates Kolkata heritage in an innovative way.. please book your joyful ride at TramDeepo!

Lets start the gupshup on The Food: This is what we ordered
Sauteed Mushrooms: This was just the way i placed my order.. perfect flavours.. loved it..

Attasi Aloo: The potatoes had the filling and it tasted really nice.. the mint chutney complimented well with this dish.. the only flaw i feel was the portion was very less given the price..

Finally The service is tad slow and poor.. we asked the staff to increase the temperature of AC as twas way beyond chilling.. all he did was nothing! Yes you must experience this place but it will burn a big hole in your pocket.. This cafe is only one time visit given the price.. Oh! How i wish this place could be my favourite place to chill but sadly one has to pay the price! Please do post your views.. I'd love to hear em!!

Visited the place on Christmas Eve. You'll love the interiors at once. The place as suggested is themed around trams. It is divided into 2 parts. The first have 6 seating cabins and a dance floor. The second, looks like a regular cafe. 

Since it was Christmas, we had to sit in the cafe portion. 

The menu is vast and dishes expensive. Since, the price was above average in a cafe, we expected the portions too to be "above average". We paid more Rs. 80/ pc of a thin bread topped with some cheese and garlic. But they compensated for this by giving us two complimentary shots (Disgusting by all standards). 

There is no drinks menu. If you wanna have something specific, you can directly ask for it at the bar. Else, the staff will simply show you a whatsapp photo of some drinks printed on a A4 sheet with prices next to it. 

Next we ordered the Signature Indian Platter and the Oriental Platter. Though the oriental platter was fine and somewhat "average in portions" the Signature platter bought the average down to a bare minimum. 

Overall, my wonder as to why the place was empty during Christmas eve was explained by the time I left.

Located where Caramelle used to be, this one's an easy find. The place is vast. The decor is excellent. Tram Deepo's the only probably restaurant which is so true to it's theme. They have an interior tram deco as the seating area. They have a dance floor and tram tracks laid which serve the purpose of the journey. They have a private seating area as well. The music/DJ console is provided by the famous DJ Akash. They have high rise stools and sofa seating arrangements. The place serves continental, north Indian and cafe food. Separate chefs man separate areas according to their expertise. The mocktails especially their kitkat shake is excellent. We tried their thai curry and non-veg platter, and their nachos is excellent.

The menu has many cuisines which offer various dishes, but the range of mocktails is limited.
The place has a fresh concept but fails to distinguish itself in terms of its offerings from other cafes.
Above all the place is worth a visit.

Tram deepo is one of the themed restaurants that have come up in kolkata with a very fresh feel..the moment u enter the restro u are mesmerised with the ambience..has a live bar setup although alcohol is not served at the moment..has a live inhouse dj and dance floor with a different kind of seating such as division into tram compartments in which 6people can sit together..and then another area where u can organise private parties of 20 people..flooring is that of rail tracks and rustic feel adding to the theme...good music and a large screen for watching live sports..shisha and food were jst great with courteous staff..is a pocket pinch but all in all a great experience..u can spend ur evening and njoy urself to the fullest..would love to revisit the place..:-)

Service: it's by far the most insincere staffs I have come across. Repeatedly told the attendant to get the lightest flavour which doesn't choke my throat. He got the worst one. I choked. He tried and said it's fine and I said it isn't. He had his air of himself as of I have to accept his choice whatever he is saying. After a long polite conversation with him, he changed it. The hookah was even more worse and I had no choice but to just let it be. So hookah was not at all what I get in other places. 

Food: They have lot of varieties in food menu. Ordered for a non-vegetarian platter. It had 3 different chicken dishes which are of very average quantity and it costs around Rs599/- which isn't worth it. Though the tastes of chicken popcorn was very tasty, the other two items were hard to chew. 

Ambience: Tram Deepo as the name says has the concept of tram. But it's no where interesting. Seats are uncomfortable. Worst is their wash rooms which looks like its actually a public toilet. I mean what's he use of making things unique which looks so bad and dirty. 

At last the bill payment. As we are happily into the era of demonetisation, this place needed a cash. When I asked them for the card payment method, they said there server is down. Then we did paytm... and they have failure there too. Around half an hour went just to try and try and try this card and paytm transaction. How can they not before hand put up a board with a notice of their shortcomings... 

It was one of the worst experience in tram deepo. I don't like this place at all. It wasted my time and money. I don't recommend my people or friends to this place. 

Thank you.

One of the well themed restaurant in Kolkata. Has the potential to serve liquor but they haven't got the licence yet. 

They accept old ₹500 and ₹1000 notes


The cafe is entirely being themed like a tram and all the details and history of the background of tram in Kolkata is beautifully scripted thorough various ways in the restro.
I ordered for Jalapeño Vodka Chicken, Jaggery Lemongrass was the mocktail and one shisha. 
The food quality is appreciated but I couldn't feel any vodka marination in the chicken. However I liked it. And the rose water was overpowering in the mocktail when it was not one of the primary ingredients.
Coming to the most important fact .. Value For 💰 
Being a critic I feel it's overpriced; almost all the items. Coz just for these few items my bill was ₹1063.
On top of that they didn't have any feedback form nor they provided me a printed bill as their system was not working.
But you can surely try it for once..
Happy Eating!!

Situated very near to quest mall, on the second floor of the building where the signboard of this restaurant glows. Its yet to receive the alcohol license, when they will get that it will really be fabulous coz the bar is well set. The beverages menu is which attracted me most as they have really nice mixologist in the house. 
We ordered for jaggery lemongrass mojito, jalapeño vodka chicken and teenpaan candy sheesha, we got strawberry cooler as a complementary mocktail. The chicken was well prepared with an unique taste infused by jalapeño. Mocktails were showstealer!
Coming to ambiance and decor, well its just as the name suggests when you enter they ring a bell and the floor has tracks and symbolizes roads of Kolkata. 
Only few flaws I found would be a dysfunctional door in the ladies washroom, too much overpriced food in terms of quantity and presentation.
Service was pretty slow in the early hours of the day, would be waiting for the bar to open cause the drinks are the most amazing part of this thematic restaurant.

On a Culinary Tram Ride@Tram Deepo..!

Kolkata is evolving their taste buds to the newness of global cuisine. Evolving adjacent to this, is the aesthetic aspects of a casual or fine dine restros. This is where themed restaurants hits the basket. An amazing smell of freshness in the concepts, a visual retreat and  concept food is being curated.

One such newly launch lounge cum restro is the Tram Deepo. Kolkata and its intrinsic connect with the rich heritage Calcutta Tramways.  Trams define Kolkata’s joyous and frivolous nature.  Trams have been intimately associated with the history and lifestyle of Kolkata and have been portrayed time and again in popular culture. This concept has been brought into limelight by the newly launched casual dining cafe, Tram Deepo in the south end of the city.

Location:

Jhowtala Road just opposite of Skating Rink near Park Circus.

Decor and Ambience: 

 As suggestive of the name , Tram Deepo promises you great ambience with bass music to spend in your leisure hours.

There are three seating areas:

1. The Bar: the tram track floored bar is done in a form of a shack.
                                          ...

I was there only for half an hour. 

What was really disappointing is that they don't serve tap water and force you to buy bottled water. On principle I do not use bottled water because the plastic bottles are not recyclable and go in landfills which is killing earth. This is apparently not a common way of thinking and I can't hold it against the restaurant. But, regardless of that this trend in Calcutta restaurants where water isn't served is abominable. There are other ways of making money and it's shameful that water is one of them. It's a question of conscience and the establishment needs to decide what's ethical and polite for them. 

I had a khus and chilly drink and that was below average. 

Disappointed with everything, I chose to ask my friends to meet me elsewhere and leave. 

The service was very good and the staff extremely polite. I did not get the bill for drink  and they seemed apologetic for the machine breakdown. 

Cannot comment on the food. Do try it for yourself.

Horrible food...too oily to be consumed. We ordered for alio olio pasta...which didn't have olives...wasn't even tasty...we also ordered for continental platter which was tasteless although it had so much oil in it...the paneer wch red in colour was completely bland in taste. The only thing good about the place is the ambience and the music...

Went in on a Sunday afternoon where it was not bustling with crowd to my surprise ! For the afternoon time the decor looked minimalistic.I guess it's better to visit the place in late evening.
Coming to food , we had chilli babycorn , nachos , Indian platter , a cranberry mocktail , and penne in mixed sauce .. all of it was decent.. nachos was not home made but cornittos and the Indian platter didnt seem perfect coz of its naan. The kebabs in the platter were nice . Overall a nice place but seems Lil dull for weekend afternoons! There are games too if one goes in with a group for a longer time. Staff was polite and warm.

With a phenomenal experience I wud suggest everyone to visit the place... We visited the place to celebrate my wife's bday..... I wud rate them 5/5 for their cordial assistance and off course for the palatable food..... Though all the staffs were amicable  but I wanna thank specialy Kader (restaurant manager) for the arrangements... we both liked the touch of their decor.... though shisha is available through out the week, u can loose ur feet with shots of alchohol merely in weekend. We have tried kiwi mojito, shisha, tram deepo sholay kebab and a conti non-veg platter, those were really mouthwatering....

Located in the most common place in Ballygunge. Extremely near quest mall.
The ambience is superb. On visiting for the first time- you won't even realise you've reached. The set up is beautiful and well thought. Full marks for that.
We had taken four different flavours of hookah- gum supari- teen paan rose- brainfreezer orange and paan supari vanilla.
All the four were good. Special mention to the brainfreezer. The hookah was smooth and good in flavour.
Coming to food- jalapeno cheese balls - gets full marks- they were superb. After a very long time- I've tasted such good cheese balls.
The pasta- a mixed sauce one- again gave me a clean chit. It was excellent. The vegetables were fresh and nicely cooked.
The nachos were ok- nothing too different from what you find at other places.
The pesto paneer tikka is a bit over hyped. Following the Zomtao review, I had ordered - but it was cold and not upto the mark.
Coming to the mocktails- the oreo shake was good.
The kitkat shake was yuk. Even after saying it wasn't good- I didn't get a fresh glass- they added the same to the bill- even after returning it. Highly not recommended to have. It was water and kitkat.
The service was good- except for the pasta- which took way toooooo long.
However, I was very happy with the ambience and food but highly disappointed with the shake.

There is also am offer of being a member and getting discount on the next visit. 

The sholay nonveg kebab starter deserves a special mention...

Tram Deepo!! Well, this place had been on my bookmark even before it had opened up. Finally visited it today!!

Location:
Jhowtala Road. More or less near Ice Skating Rink. Just opposite to Great Eastern showroom. The same building where Ground Zero and Urban Desi used to be. 2nd floor of the building.

Ambience: Just Wow!!!!! Themed on Trams as the name suggests, the interiors and decorations have actually justified the theme. Really really great ambience!

Interior:
There are 3 seating areas:
1. The Bar: It accommodates a large number. The best part I liked about it is that it has got tram tracks on the floor. :)
2. The Dance Floor Area: You'll come across a Tram standing as you enter the place. There are seating arrangements inside the tram in coops and you can look outside the window out onto the roads beneath. It's actually decorated with tram interiors inside. Each coop got the name of various tram depots written over it like Tollygunge Depot, Esplanade Depot and so on.
3. The Private Area: This place is perfect for private party if you're in a group of 15-20. The best thing I liked about this place is the various videos of Kolkata streets, they keep on playing on one of the walls which itself is covered with the kind of square wires, a Tram window has.
There are live sport screening in all the 3 areas. The music over here is also pretty good!! Overall, ambience and interior is jus fab!!

Food:
The food was just too good!! We had ordered a wide variety, half of which I don't even remember. Still the ones which I can, were:
Cheese Garlic Bread (heavenly)
Atashi Aloo (A Must Have...it's amazing!!)
Pesto Paneer Tikka (Unique, when Pesto meets Tikka)
Indian Platter (Pretty decent)
Pasta in Pesto Sauce (Yummm)
Mocktails and Sheesha
Food was really good!!!

Hospitality:
The Manager and the staff were really polite and courteous. Hospitality was really good!

Overall, a great place!! 100% positive experience. Would definitely recommend everyone to try!! :)

Very often you won’t find two contrasting elements coming together to produce any wonder. Such was the case at the latest eatery where I was invited. This restaurant is called ‘Tram Deepo’ and as the name indicates, it is a themed restaurant and the theme is the vehicle that Calcuttans are availing since 1873, i.e. the trams. The trams which still run in Calcutta are the oldest electric trams in Asia and in fact it is the only tram network running in India. Previously it used to be horse-drawn trams which helped people commute, but with time trams kept on losing its importance in the city of joy, and people started avoiding trams and rather go for faster moving and more flexible vehicles and cabs. But since Calcutta never forgets its roots, so trams are still running in Kolkata and it is mostly becoming a heritage element in the city, which of course we are proud of. Now, instead of trams and old yellow taxis, what we can find more commonly in the city are the App-based cabs, malls, closed-down factories, new restaurants and restropubs!! City crowd has started living life on a faster lane, they are trying to work hard and party even harder. Thus we got the latest restropub ‘Tram Deepo’ where two contrasting elements has come together, one is vanishing fast from the city, i.e. the tram, while the other is just making its entry in the city and into the lives of the city dwellers, i.e. the restro-pubs.

Went there last weekend. Ambience is nice but I dint feel any tram feeling. Coming to food it was ordinary, nothing spectacular. We ordered cheese chicken 65, crispy babycorn and 2 mocktails. We also ordered one hookah which was okay to some extent but lacked the fire power as it was small hookah. We dint order any drinks which is still not in menu card but they do order if asked for. Only limited alcoholic drinks are available and they are extremely costly. A pint for 300 is worthless.

“Tram” well this word is quite known to everybody specially if you’re a bong.let’s go back to the 60 years from now when Tram is one of the most famous and popular vehicle for travelling,for an example Esplanade to Shyambazar like Metro rails,apart from the buses & taxis.now a days we hardly travel by tram.what will happen if you get the chance to have lunch or dinner in a Tram themed restaurant,well the wait is over Tram Deepo finally arrived in Kolkata.located in 45,Jhowtala road,Ballygunge area,just opposite of Great Eastern,near ice sketing ring very near from Quest Mall.first of all i would like to share my experience about the decoration.the place is quite big and it’s divided into three different parts.first one is in the normal restaurant type themed chair and tables along with the lovely lighting effects.their speical thing which i noticed customized tables made with wood along with iron tankar,the concept was simply brilliant.next come to the another part which was tram compartments where you can enjoy the foods as well as enjoy the live Dj music with an extraordinary lighting effects which creates a perfect atmosphere for partying.third one is a private section where you can arrange a small get together,simply a noice free zone as well as a glimpse of old kolkata which displayed on the wall by the projector.well i was invited there by the management of Tram Deepo with my fellow foodie friends over a food tasting session.

From the lip smacking dishes to the crazy music (one of the best I've heard in a long time), it's all worth each penny!
The ambience seems about perfect for an evening chill with friends.

P.S. It still stays on the expensive side.

Tried mexi skin and quesadilla and both were good .. The place charges service charge but the guys around has no clue what the dish mean , so was absurd .. Given that charges are not low ur service and set up shouldn't be compromised .

With all the new places coming up in town, Tram Deepo could boast of good taste and interesting interiors. However, the place really needs more time to get up to the mark. The service was pretty slow and there was a lot of confusion in the order that we placed. Also the air conditioning and lighting in the seating area is a slight put off with poor regulation.

Located very close to quest mall, this is where Caramelle used to be previously. Located on the first floor it's a well spaced out place decked up like a tram depot (like the name suggests). There are couches as well as high rising chairs as seating arrangements. Well lit and pretty ambience with good music, the place starts off on the right note. The staff takes personal care in general however I wish they were a little more attentive as they tend to lose track with what's asked for. Coming to the food, we tried two types of kebabs: mutton galauti and malai chicken. In drinks we had. Fresh lime soda,an orange and basil mocktail (no liquor license yet)For main course they don't really have much of an option from the north Indian category or for that matter even Chinese or Thai ( except sticky rice). We tried the penne pasta in white sauce. Quantity wise it's fine however I guess price could be brought down a notch just to appeal the crowd more considering its absolutely new.

I visited the place during the Puja's and the first impression that you get when you enter is that the place is much bigger than it looks! Definitely a plus to the ambience and the music! A strong mix of the conventional and rustic appeal with a modern hint to it.. the floor are the 1980's tram tracks...
divided in 3 sections for a crowd of all ages for the hookah, pub and food lovers!
Coming the main aspect.. the preferred choice is definitely the various platter options. And the food quality is met with..
Pocket pinch- a little on the higher side but won't dig a hole in your pocket..
Definitely recommended for a group outing!

We gave the order at 1 am and at 1.30 the music and a.c was off...we were there for the music n ambience...but our mood was totally spoilt..I want the mgmt to look into this matter seriously..bcoz the staffs over there are good for nothing..the manager named Mr.kadir, I am sorry to say but he is not capable of being in this industry. I don't know how come the mgmt have recruited him...total waste of mood n money

Visited this place on ashtami night... Very honestly the food was ok kind of.. ordered 
1.Garlic cream pasta (Thought it would be a bit diffrnt
from other white sauce pasta but there was no garlic flavour in it... so the suggestion would be 'Kindly change the name from garlic cream to white sauce')

2.Crispy Chilli Babycorn ( it was crispy but the tangy, sweet n sour n spicy flavour was missing)

3. Chilli Chicken and Cheese chicken 65 ( Though the chicken were extremely soft n juicy but the preparation could have been better )

4. Mocktails-Virgin Mojito and kiwi mojito (10/10, Too good)

Been there twice ! The ambience and entire atmosphere is Fantastic - kudos to the team for the concept !! The plc has been constructed and so is the service - the staff is pretty courteous but slight less trained for running the Restaurant. The food is average , we had ordered the tandoori platter which was v v avg and mocktails were decent ! The quesadilla was avg but out of the three dips served only one was fine but the other two was bad ! The Shisha served was great as well ! So over all this place needs improvement !!

A complete justification of its name. 

This place does takes one on a ride along with lip smacking food and the delightful hookah. The interiors are different from the mainstream restro bars. It gives you a feel of a proper tram deepo. My personal favourite being the small tram bogies. The food is yummy, if i have to be bluntly honest. Apart from the taste, another thing which caught my attention were the platters in which the food was served. Instead of using the mainstream platter dishes, the food was served in spade platters.

Thai chicken skewers 
Chicken malai tikka 
Spinach corn sandwich 

I am unable to get enough of these 3 dishes. A must try out dish. Being a hookah enthusiast, a good hookah with mild flavours and dense smoke is a must for me. They didnt dissappoint me there as well. I was also treated with a complementary sheesha made out of an orange and the base being a water glass. 
The pocket pinch is minimal compared to the places of this grandeur. From being a little skeptical about new places, i have become a regular here within 2 weeks. The behaviour of the staff is also appealing and allows you to maintain your own comfort zone. Overall i would say if youre looking out for good food and hookah with a different touch, you should take a ride.

Starting with the interior and ambience the interior is nice and soothing! The service is okayish but Tanmay served us with a smile! Food is good and so is the hookah. A nice place to hang out with friends and chill having drinks too!

Its located where UD and Caribbean cafe were opposite Great Eastern..
The ambience is a 5/5
Food was 4/5 The Quantity was good.
Worth it. A must visit..
 Tanmay served us and was very polite.
(This review was made up by me there and then so that we could avail a little discount on the bill.Honestly the food was bad so were the drinks,The staffs were inattentive hence resulted in poor service. Had to wait for fifteen minutes for the salsa for the nachos.
Sadly never going back again.

This place is a total bliss. They have a great service, well mannered staff, serve cheap alcohol as well, what else does anyone need. Located just beside Ballygunge Chai Break, I would recommend this place if you want to hangout with your best buddies because the availability of some games just adds up to the fun

Interior is very well done. Food is excellent with very thoughtfully created menu. Ambience is exquisite. In spite of serving shisha, it wasn't at all smoky and very comfortable for people who don't prefer going to lounges where shisha is served. Being a sizeable group we were accommodated in a private section which was a very nice gesture by the management.

Highly recommended!! Must visit💜

As the name suggest tge interiors are inspired by the tram. Loved the interiors. There are good no. of TV sets installed, music is loud and good. Coming to food i have tried the crispy chilli babycorn which was very prepared and had the good amount of crispiness and flavour of garlic and chilly added to it. Then we ordered a veg indian platter which had 3 slices of pesto panner tikka, 3 slices of atashi aloo, black dal and naan. If you are a fan of tandoori aloo and you like them a little sweeter then atashi aloo is the best dish you should go for. The pesto panner tikka had the perfect flavour of pesto, the panner was fresh and delicious. The taste of black daal was upto the mark.
Must try the spice canberry in mocktail. Overall had a very nice experience and i am sure there are many dishes which is still left unexplored and would love to taste them all. 
I came 3rd time here service has been bad. No one to take care of feedback.  Very unhappy.

After a lot of confusion we decided upon this place. Ended up there on a Sunday afternoon not aware of the timings of this café, ordered a Thai chicken skewers and crispy chill babycorn. Served in a really nice and creative manner, loved the babycorns but not satisfied with the skewers as it lacked the Thai touch in it. Hukka was of their choice which gave off mild flavours and a sweetish aftertaste. Surprised us with their moctails, loved the Mango twist, watermelon mojito and Masala Cranberry. Coming to the theme of the café, it's more based on the significant Kolkata tram as the name suggests, they have this side of the café looking like the boxes of tram with the deepo name's written on top of them which was really cute, what I loved the most was that they had this front of a tram on one of the walls. Moving on I think they need improvement in certain aspects but it can be overlooked as they're new in town.

Definitely the best place for continental. Simple yet rustic presentation and portion is ideal for two.The intensity of flavours just shines in your plate. Their authentic special touch always excites me, especially the use of ingredients and taste is remarkably good. The use of ingredients, sauces and spices elevates the food taste.

It was on Sunday, when I have tasted the most appetizing dish at Tram Deepo. However, the best things that have pleased me most are the customer service and interior look.  It is really a unique looking cafe with attractive decorations and excellent maintenance of hygiene. I am also gratified with the fast and dedicated service for the customers. They served me just after ten minutes of my order.  I am now making a plan to visit the same restaurant to get relaxed with wonderful foods and friendly service.

Sunday dinner & a new place! Had the Oriental platter with Jaggery & Lemon grass mocktail.. & it was awesome!
Interiors: Nice sitting arrangement and loved the window experience!
The ambiance is really good and perfect for a light pocket dinner. 
Great music and lighting!
Plating: The plates and platters make the dish look lip smacking.
A good visit!

Being a regular customer with hookah, amazing food and great ambience this newly opened lounge is a must visit place for all. Earlier i was facing few problems with the service but day by day its improving..... if they carry on improving at this pace then am sure they'll do great success in future.

The management is great on their service, shisha and their service boys are very active, TRAM DEEPO is better place to run in a locality which already has some big names serving amazing food and shisha. 
Though the interiors are unique and they have made there dream project delivered with a new themed Cafe.I really enjoyed my visit here infact i went on the opening day itself and they served me what i ordered in right time.I am expecting TRAM DEEPO to have more outlet asap in a city of joy.

MASSIVE RESPECT TO THE OWNER OF THIS PROPERTY.

What a disappointing experience management isn't well trained. When we were seated we asked our server do they serve alcohol the server said they didn't get their alcohol license yet so we asked when are they expecting their license he said end of this month. After 5 minutes his senior comes up to us and says we have alcohol but we won't be giving you any bill instead the Alcohol will be punched as mocktail on the bill. We then planned to skip drinks at the place, and ordered for shisha, few mocktails and Food. Shisha took more than 25 minutes to reach we expected it to be smokey, after just 10 minutes the shisha went out of smoke even after repeated request the shisha wasn't changed. Till that time we were still waiting for our food. The place was just occupied by 2-3 more tables and half of their food items weren't available. After more 15 minutes our food arrived it's was surprisingly decent. 
The management needs to work on their service, shisha and train their service boys, to run in a locality which already has some big names like CB and Unplugged serving amazing food and shisha. 
Though the interiors are good and they have come up with a new themed Cafe.

Amazing Place to chill out with friends ...delicious food ...value for money ...!! Perfect Hookah made by Jahangir ...but your service is very very very poor ...I asked the manager to get me a good menu he got me after half an hour that also after reminding him again ...no one comes to take the order we have to keep calling them ...!!

Place is very good nicely decor. Totally a different concept. Dj Chetan is as usual very good with his music. Anwesha the PR she is just outrageous with her work. Food is nice and Hookah is good. But....
I am very much disappointed with the service part. They took almost 45 mins to deliver me the order. Pathetic service and there's no co-ordination between them. If they will work on their service part then trust me this cafe will rock.

Pathetic food and service time had to leave the restaurant by cancelling all the orders. Recommend no one should ever go at the cafe. Not worth for money lift cannot accommodate 4 shabby entry

You know you're in for a ride as soon as you enter this place. The interiors are just mind boggling and outstanding. Never seen one before like this. The place is really well constructed and the ambience is just amazing. Ordered for chicken wings, wasn't disappointed at all. The hookah is decent and so are the drinks. A must visit for all in Kolkata.
