I thik this place is the best destination for cakes,  I took few flavored cakes for certain occasions in my family two birthday cakes and one anniversary cake all were equally good. 
1st birthday cake was of dark chocolate flavor it was so moist, soft and tasty that all our guests liked it very much.  
2nd was another birthday cake of black forest flavor it was so yummy that most of my guests asked for one more piece and definitely the name of the shop from which I bought this cake. 
3rd one was an anniversary cake,  it was of two different flavors the 1st tier was vanilla and the second was chocolate it was the super hit cake very well decorated as instructed by my uncle. 
All the time we were please with the quality and it's always a value for money. The cookies and chocolates are also very tasty. I would love to order cakes from this place years after years.

I was looking for a perfect birthday cake and was going through various cake shop's Social Media pages. Suddenly came across the Facebook page of 'The Creations' and I went through all their posts and I loved all photos because the cakes were designed with such expertise that one is bound to develop an immediate liking for the designs. So I texted Jiya , the owner of this shop and got an immediate response. I briefed her about my design and she took no time confirm me that I'll get what I want. Today I got the cake(the one which I have uploaded) and honestly I was soo happy to see the cake it was perfect and tastes so good. The best part is their hassel delivery service. Thank you 'The Creation' for making the birthday so special üòä

Well I was looking for barbie cake for one of my friend's daughter's birthday near Howrah area in zomato. I looked at The Creations and found the reviews very good. I called up and placed my order of 4 pounds of black forest cake in barbie doll shape.  The lady owner Ms. Jiya is extremely generous & nice and have sent me few photo options to select from through whatsapp.  I selected one of them and the result that turned out next day is amazing.  I have attached photo of actual cake. It was fabulous not only in looks but tastes also very delicious. I'm very impressed with the kind of service she provided. The rate is reasonable. I would definitely recommend my other friends to try this place.

One can trust Creations for making the special occasions magical and memorable!!! Their cupcakes are treat to the eyes and they taste delicious. I got a Barbie Cake from Creations and all my guests loved it. The quality of cream that they use is of superior quality. The cupcakes that I ordered were customized exactly as I instructed. The best part is that they charge reasonably and you will love their service. To summarize, if you wish to make your dear ones happy by presenting them customized cakes or surprise cakes (for eg. a letter or a ring hidden inside the cake), Creations will serve as a magic wand to fulfill your special requirements. ¬†Also, if you are planning for a theme party, Creations will be your one-stop solution!!!
