Taste is average, price is decent. I ordered a tandoori chicken, that was little over spicy. Other items yet to check. Service people had nice behaviours.

Food was worst. The tandoori was kept for the whole day with the spices added on them and was burnt later. It tasted really bad. Would not prefer to go there

Food & Taste: We ordered tandoor chicken half plate. The size was too small when compared to more restaurants nearby. The chicken had less meat and it was mostly burned. The masala on the tandoor too was not good. Then gave a mint chutney which tasted okay but was too watery. Overall not really satisfied and wouldn't recommend anyone.
Price & Packaging : The price is almost same when @compared to nearby restaurants but the packaging is too poor, they just wrap in foil paper and give it in a plastic bag. The same item when bought from nearby restaurant is wrapped in foil and then packed in a paper box .
Ambiance : Since the order was a take away there is nothing much to comment, it's easy as one enters and give the order and wait outside.

The worst food i get is from this shop!!  Today only i brought 2 mutton biriyani and the mutton was totally burned. It was not consumable and we had to throw this two pieces of mutton..  Plus the quantity and quality is bad for its price.. Not worth buying.. Try to avoid this restaurant..

If you are really looking for having a good time do not go there. Place is well furnished but customer satisfaction is not taken into account. Menu is small but availability is big   question. If can not have bara kabab mutton chap pulao although they are in menu. Service I would not say hi fi as if people were very reluctant to serve. Last but not the least fod quality was average quantity was average.

They serve quite good food both quality and quantity wise. Fairly priced. Their delivery service is a bit slow though. Overall a good place in howrah for mughlai food.

We received stale food from this place.The 'chanp' was disgusting as well as the 'mutton kasha'. The tandoori rotis were like you could play frisbee with them. The biriyani was really dry. Bland!!! Extremely disappointed. Â I will never recommend this place to anyone.

Never dined in there, only ordered food a few times. The delivery service is fast and great. Food quality is good. The menu, however, is quite limited.
Recommendations: Peas pulaw, chicken reshmi butter masala
Food: 4/5
Service: 4/5
