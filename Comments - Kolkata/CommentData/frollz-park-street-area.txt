I opted for the java love. It was coffee flavoured and topped with whipped cream, chocolate sauce and a small piece of brownie. It tasted quite good! üòÖ
But seemed a little over priced! 
Worth a try!

Okay I might sound crazy but i did not enjoy their ice-creams at all. An ice-cream should be silky and melt in the mouth textured. Unfortunately the rolled ice-creams were icy and just unpleasant.

This place is situated just opposite  kfc park street , so we happened to visit here after a good meal from kfc.. I being a hardcore ice cream lover was eager to try this place.. Hence after a long discussion  orederd chocolust.. It was good ..nothing 'oh so special ' about it.. Had way better ice creams in other ice cream parlours.. It was too much for two of us.. We(me n my husband) somehow managed to finish it.. It was ok for a one time try.. Doubt visiting here again..

I ordered CHOCOLUST

‚óèCHOCOLUST : i have a little bit confusionvbetween chocolust nd nolengur...atlast i choosed chocolust...it was not disspointed me...chocolate syrup along with¬† the condensed milk and vannila icecream...with 2 choco sticks...

Frollz is one of the pioneers to introduce the concept of fried ice cream in our city of joy, which is a very trending idea these days. 
There‚Äôre a number of flavours to choose from like Strawberry Blast, Paan, Nolen Gur, Kiwi Blast, Gulabo, Butter Scotch, Black Forest, etc. A number of other flavours are available apart from the chosen ones. You can make customizations as per your own requirements.
I ordered Chocolust & Pinacolada, and both were pretty delectable.
The pricing is pretty cheap compared the quantity of ice cream served per portion(one enough for two people). Also, these fried ice creams don't melt soon. So you can take your own sweet time to finish it!

Pros: Picture perfect Fried Ice-cream rolls.
Cons: Gets crowded at times.

One of the unique things that I've had recently, fried ice cream rolls at Frollz. We tried Chocolust- Choco cubes spread out on a pan, smashed into a paste and made into rolls, then mixed with ice cream and other toppings, this is a must try for dessert lovers, the quantity is huge, one ice cream serves for two.
PS: The variety of flavors was mind blowing, but they should increase the sitting space, it's too small.

To everyone who have a craze for desserts, this is a must try. Located near Petercat, this little store serves the best and the yummiest kind of ice-cream rolls. Also you get to see how they are prepared which itself is a bonus. 
We ordered the Java Rolls which is coffee based and Oreo Shake. Both were 5/5. Couldnot be more better. The shake was the best I had till date because it was so thick and flavoured. Also the java rolls were topped with fresh cream and chocolate sauce and choco chips. 
Prices are affordable and quantity was good.
The only minus point is their space.

I cannot wait to visit this place again. ‚ù§

I loved the flavors and the rolls topped with fresh cream,chocolate sauce,choco chips and choco sticks...The quantity is enough...Prices are suitable..This is 5/5
The main problem is that the place is not spacious...There is not sufficient seating arrangements...they should improve their seating arrangements..¬†

We ordered Chocolust and it was mind blowing.
I loved the flavors and the rolls topped with cream and choco chips.
The only drawback is the place is not spacious and you even have to wait to get yourself a seat and its difficult to enjoy your Ice-cream peacefully coz you got to bear the noise while the ice-creams are being prepared.
Price is worth the quality and quantity.

Been planning to visit for a long time. Had the coffee based Java Love. The preparation was amazing! One should go there just to see how it's done with their own eyes. And the outcome looked pretty great too. But the ice cream itself was not that impressive. The taste seemed very bland, and I personally didn't like the texture.
The place is very small, with extremely limited seating arrangements. Also, keep in mind that they don't accept card.

Was very eager to visit this place after finding out that a place serving ice cream rolls has opened in Kolkata.Finally made time to visit this and I was pretty impressed! I wanted a Nutella¬† ice cream roll with out the bananas like in the custom menu of theirs, the staff very gladly accepted my request and improvised it by adding ferrero rocher in place of bananas and oh my god!What a sinful combination it was!
The ice cream cup came with 4 ice cream rolls and 2 chocolate wafers and is enough for 2 people if having it as a desert after a hearty meal.
I am definately going back soon to try the other flavours especially the Nolen gur one!

Last weekend went here to try this new trend of ice cream rolls that is going on.
Location :3-4 minutes walk from Spencers
We tried the chocolust roll. The quantity was good. The place is a bit small and seating arrangement is there for 5-6 people only but you get to see the making of the ice cream. The taste was really great and rolls tasted like ice cream but a bit different. One of the best deserts I have had in recent times and would love to come back again. 
P. S - They don't charge any extra taxes.

Ice cream at its best. Woah! It's just a whole new level. First time experienced something just like this.

The place is small. Sitting arrangement is not very good. You might have to stand for while to get your seat. The atmosphere inside is ok.

Now the ice cream rolls. Plenty of flavours to choose from and the process of making these rolls is something new. It takes 5-7 minutes to prepare the rolls. It is worth of trying something just like this.

 it to another level altogether! 1 can feed 2 easily and if you're not a heavy eater then it can feed 3. Very good value for money.

I was a little skeptical about trying Fried Ice Cream rolls but couldn't leave it untried. So after a lot of self persuasion went to this place with a fried on a Thursday afternoon. It is located a few shops ahead of Peter Cat, right opposite to the KFC. The main ice cream parlour is on the first floor and the ground floor is mainly the cash counter. We ordered for Chocolust ice cream rolls. It was basically a fusion of cream and dark chocolate mixed, freezed and rolled and topped with a lot of fresh cream, choco chips and Chocolate syrup. It was amazing. I am not a fan of dark chocolates but this was was absolutely great. A must must try. I want to visit this place again to try out all the other flavours of the ice cream rolls and also the shakes. 
Happy Fooding ‚ô•

I've tried the kiwi, strawberry, oreo and black forest one. The black forest one is probably their best. Oreo could've been better. It was too sweet and grainy. Also, THE QUANTITY IS A LOOOOT. Really hard to finish one yourself unless you're on an empty stomach.

The layout inside is not very practical. You have to go upstairs to order and pay downstairs. It was fun watching the ice cream being made fresh in front of me. I ordered a Pina colada. The description stated coconut flakes but I actually got was a crushed coconut biscuit. I would have appreciated if the guy told me they were out of coconut flakes. The flavour was still good and the ice cream rolls were so cold, they didn't melt as fast as regular ice cream. Overall the place could have been cleaner.

The concept of ice cream rolls earns much praise.
They were really yummy. Infact the taste was a bit different from regular ice cream. The only disadvantage of this place is that it doesn't have much space.

Visited here for the first time, my friends and I wanted to try the kiwi flavour but since it was not available we tried the nutella, banana ice cream instead!! It was absolutely gorgeous!! It was also fun to see how the ice cream is made (perfect for instagram stories).  üòä I would like to try out others flavors they seem tempting as well.

Excellent taste. 
You should see the making, it's interesting. 
A small place though; can't acomodate more thsn 10. 
The flavours really blend in your mouth and the quality and amount is nice. 
A bit pricy. 
Overall will definitely revisit.

A great place for ice cream lovers!

Located at the food hub of Kolkata, Park Street, Frollz has come up with a new concept of frozen ice cream rolls, making it a happening place to be at. They have a confined space with just a few seating arrangements. The ice cream rolls look good but tastes average! The price is also moderate. One of the good things about this place is that it's opened till 2a.m. ! So if you have ice cream cravings at midnight and don't have any at home, you know where to drop by!

Frollz is a chain of ice cream parlours in Kolkata. They give you a variety of ice cream rolls and my favourite is Black Forest. As described as described it has fresh brownies crushed and mixed with cherries and homemade chocolate syrup talked with whipped cream to give you the perfect taste. You can also have Pina Colada mango blast which is very rare in any Ice cream parlour. The place is really small but the service is good. The cost of the black forest was 145 which is worth it.
I would recommend all the ice cream lovers to frollz at least once and have black forest.

This outlet is located few buildings next to peter cat. The ground floor serves milkshakes. The first floor is where the fried icecream is prepared and served. There are few stools for sitting. The waiters are a bit indifferent and cold. We tried their pinacolada and saw it being prepared in front of us. It's fun watching the milk and other ingredients being beaten and rolled into icecream. One serving is huge and enough for two if not three. The only thing which was not expected was that they used nice biscuits instead of dessicated coconut in the pinacolada. Taste is delicious. Price is okay as per prevailing standards.

Frollz is located in the same lane as Loreto, Park Street. The fried icecream rolls are something new in this city and it is definitely worth it.

Gulabo is my ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE now. It's simple yet so luscious and delicious. It doesn't have the strong smell of rose syrup and the strawberry icecream is the most delicious I've ever had!

Black Forest is good but nothing extraordinary to write about here. But this one looks really good and of course desserts are 50% looks/design and 50% taste amirite? 

Can't wait to be back and try out the other flavours. Also the cost is quite on the lower side so it's just another reason(if you ever needed one) to have ice-cream! :-)

Located just oppsite of Myx and beside Golden spoon & Peter Cat. A very new concept of making the ice cream in front of your eyes ie., they have a live counter. Two storey outlet but a seating capacity of around 10 at that place. Ice cream made on a chilled fryer but mixing condensed milk and vanilla ice cream in it and mixing flavours of your choice. Ice cream is very yummy.. Mark it..!!
                    

Chocolust ‚Äì The best in the menu. Fully chocolaty. Chocolate syrup along with chocolate chips being added with the condensed mil and vanilla ice cream mixture to give the result. The quantity is good enough. 5 rolls being served and I must say it‚Äôs worthy.  5/5 from my side.

Black Forest- Very nice and yummy too. Cherry toppings and cream toppings what you will get. Chocolate being added with brownie in it with added cherries.

Cookiespree- Here it comes for oreo lovers. Oreo biscuit being added with the mixture along with brownie and chocolate syrup.
                                                                ...

This is one of the various ice cream parlors that you will find when you visit Park Street. But what makes this one unique is that it serves ice cream rolls. Confused by the name? Basically its made by pouring milk on an extremely cold Steel surface that resembles a pizza pan. The person chops and scrapes the ingredients till they freeze and they scrape the frozen spread into rolls of ice cream. These ice cream rolls are made in front of you instead of being ready made. I think this resembles the Thailand ice cream rolls. Anyway, so there are various flavours to choose from. We chose the cookiespree that's made from Oreo. Its extremely delicious and an absolute delight to have. And one serving is enough for 2 people! And that's not even the best part! The best part is these frollz are cheap and are "inclusive" of taxes! What a steal! Unfortunately, what this parlor lacks is seating arrangements. Not enough seats, but there are shelfs provided to rest your frollz if you want to. Anyway, I'd still make people consider this place because one drawback can be overlooked by the numerous benefits this place has to offer. Yes people, go! If you haven't tried it out, you have to! All the best!

Situated just near loretto college this little place for live ice cream eat-out at first is difficult to notice because of its very simple outside decor..But after you enter the place you can see and smell ice cream and shakes everywhere like a place made in heaven(for a dessert obsessed person like me of course)it has two sections the ground floor is for various types of shakes and the upper one is for ice cream.we went the upper section it is small but the wall Decor is charming and funny in a good way.after we ordered chocolust and black forest.we started watching the process.and it's really worth watching.the girl behind the counter was making the ice cream on a flat surfaces -beating , pressing,cutting the ingredients with so much energy and power that it made us look for a long time.after they are done both of the dishes looked so amazing and unique.the quantity was beyond questioning and the raste was something i never had before ....Smooth,creamy,not very sugary just proper balance of sweetness and creaminess.the whole experience was wonderful from watching the love ice cream making to actually eating it.if you are in the mood for relishing your sweet teeth and not so much a fan of packed things frollz should be your place.the fried ice cream rolls are surely the new in- thing Worth trying out.
Place 3/5(they should make the place a little bigger)

Icecreams are great. Tried chocolust and kiwi blast. Its a small parlour. Although icecreams taste good but the place is a little dirty. Proper cleaning of the place is mandatory. Leftovers are kept on the table. The taste gets all the browny points but considering the look and the ambience its a big no.

Huge ice creams! Literally huge.  
You could actually be full with just Ice cream.  

Tried the black forest,  butterscotch, pan and nutella banana. 

Thumbs up for the butterscotch and nutella banana.  
The pan and black forest were okayish. 

I would like to bring out though,  the hygiene part. The place was quite low on its hygiene level.  A better care towards the outer hygiene is required. 

The rating is completely forgot what I enjoyed.  It's a cozy place.  
Decently priced for what they quantity is. 
If the hygiene was better,  probably the rating would have been as well. 

Can do a little better guys!

As the name goes, frollz stands for fried ice cream rolls which is a bit of oxymoron. After all, how can ice cream be fried and presented ? Its possible and you will only get to know once you visit their outlets which is highly recommended. I really liked the art of making the rolls and the output was beyond description. The presentation, the taste everything was just awesome and yes one cup is enough for two.
So if ur an ice cream lover ( like really ? who can even hate ice cream? ) or even if ur not, just hop into the place and¬† give it a try.
I will recommend you to try the¬† chocolate based ones, the nolen gur (which is seasonal and is available only in winters) first before moving on to the others.
LOCATION: Its located on the same lane and on the same side where the legendary Peter Cat (with its never ending queue :-D) stands.

This place took me to wonderland with its exquisitely tasty ice cream rolls. 
I have to keep going back to try all of the varieties they have to offer. 
Its a small parlour in the lane of Peter cat, that has a few chairs to sit, the seating is a problem since it is easily crowded.
But, the ice creams are to die for!
I tried the black forest ice cream roll with whipped cream and it was the best experience ever!
My friend tried the nutella banana one and unexpectedly that tasted amazing too! But I'd opt for the blackforest one of I were you, over and over again.

10/10 would recommend this place. The place provided is a tad bit small, however the preparations are worth all your money since a single order serves two. I have tried the Cookiespree(which in my opinion, is the best I had there), the Chocolust, the Butterscotch which were good. I particularly disliked the Black Forest preparation. The Paan and the Kiwi preparations are a specialty here. 
It's a treat to watch the liquid cream harden over the freezer and get rolled into perfect spirals for your luxury  experience.

Located next to Peter Cat.
Had seen a lot of videos of ice cream rolls online so was really excited. 
And to be honest it didn't disappoint me. 
The place is small. It can accommodate not more than 10 people so you only get to enjoy your ice cream if you're in luck or be prepared for the crowd. 
Ordered Java lava and pinacolada. 
Java one was coffee based. As not being a coffee fan it didn't sooth my taste buds but my coffee lover friend loved it.
I wanted to order mango blast but it was unavailable so had to go for pinacolada. It was okayish. It was made with a biscuit and pineapple. Would love to try other flavors.
Sorry for being not being able to click pictures as the place was too crowded.

They have taken the concept of ice cream to another level. It shows a unique way of instant preparation of ice cream. The best thing about the ice cream is it melts very slowly. 
We ordered black forest,chocolust, butter scotch. 
Black forest : is a combination of chocolate and straberry topped by cream and cherry with chocolate sauce. 
Chocolust : is a combination of chocolate and choco chips. Topped with cream,chocolate sauce and chocolate wafer.
Butter scotch  : it's simple butter scotch ice cream roll topped with caramel.

Its 'live ice cream making', amazing. It was a delight to watch the entire procedure... From scratch to garnishing.i ordered choco lust n cookie spree... Both were lip smacking n d sight of the ice cream will make u drool. Fried ice cream rolls is their speciality. Everyone please try n visit Frollz, each n every ice cream they serve is awsome...and of course at a very reasonable price.

FROLLZ is the best place where anyone can get fried ice cream rolls. I heard a lot about this place & went there. It has two floors. The ground floor offers shakes of various flavors & the upper floor provides with delicious ice cream rolls. It has a small seating arrangement. I went for the Chocolust as chocolate is my all time favourite. It has chocolate ice cream rolls with chocolate waffles on the side & whipped cream with chocolate toppings on top. I never tried ice cream rolls & this is THE BEST. It was too tasty and marvellous...will soon come to this place again.

The first thing you will enjoy is the preparation of the rolls and their presentation. I have visitied this place twice , first time I had the Java love  and Choco lust for the second. Both were delicious. But the One bowl is heavy enough for one person, sharing recommended. It is a must visit for ice.cream.lovers.

We visited after Lunch and the crowd was moderate but the Staff quite soft spoken. He was handling both the floors together. He was also working as a cashier,waiter and a Glacier...
P.S - In the traditional French brigade system, the chef in charge of frozen desserts is called a "Glacier"

Nevertheless,He was quick with his work... and he made yummy Frollz for us. It is a must visit for ice cream lover.

The best ice cream parlour, I have ever gone and the best Ice creams I ever tasted. They serve incredibly tasty ice creams with a sweet decorated ambiance. You can also enjoy how your favourite frollz are being prepared infront of your eyes. 

Last day we visited this place and tasted Chocolust and Pan. They just justified their price tag.

The only complaint I have that the place is little extra small it is really difficult for more than 5 people to accommodate.

Fried ice cream roll is the talk of the town. And it was such a delight to witness the live ice cream making process. While making my Pan Flavour rolls they actually used pan leaves, gulkand, mukhwas and other sweeteners. It was lip smacking and absolutely worth the money. I have heard a lot about the Java Love which they make from crushed coffee beans but unfortunately it was not available.

Frollz has a little seating arrangement in the upper section where they make and serve the rolls. But I thought it needed a little more maintenance. The ground section is basically the cash counter and also serves smoothies.

Ice Cream rolls is the new trend in Kolkata, the way it is prepared and served is truly amazing and a treat to the eyes. Frollz, located in Park Street, serves lip smacking rolls. A small place, with a seating capacity for not more than 7 people. The service is fast and the staffs are warm. Chocolust is the one roll everyone must try here. The rich creamy chocolate has that sweet and bitter taste, a unique flavour which oozes once it starts to melt inside the mouth. Only one drawback, the tables could be a little cleaner, and the water in the tap to wash hands is a trickle which is quite frustrating.

Probably one of the most innovative ways of making ice cream... Frollz is definitely going to be my much frequented spot now onwards... The parlour is small yet cute in its own way... It was sheer pleasure to watch fried ice cream being rolled out right in front of us... This is the first time that i witnessed a live ice cream counter and it seriously made its impression on me... Visited the place with a friend and therefore we could try only two flavours...
Chocolust-- The ice cream was beautifully made with an ample amount of chocolate in it... It was topped with a generous helping of whipped cream and chocochips which is enough to floor a chocolate lover... Yet, I personally felt that the dessert was overpoweringly sweet and lacked relief and failed to strike a balance in the taste buds.
Java love-- I simply fell in love with this flavour and I can go back again and again just to relish this dessert at Frollz... It is sheer pleasure for an inveterate coffee lover and it emanated the strong yet magically intoxicating aroma of freshly brewed coffee... And what made it more amazing was that it was sprinkled over with coffee bits and powder to create the perfect dish. Do have this if u r at Frollz...
Definitely looking forward to trying more flavours here... This out of the box ice cream parlour is undoubtedly worth a visit for all sweet tooths.

Went to Park Street outlet with a friend for deserts after dinner. The preparation is really good. But since I am not a sugar person it was too sweet for me. I wish they had sweetness option. Good point is they add real fruit pieces along with artificial agents.

I wanted to order Nolen Gur flavored ice cream but they didn't have it in their stock. Eventually I had to opt for Chocolust. 
As it's name says, it was loaded with chocolate, chocolate and chocolate. And it tasted heavenly delicious!

An amazing place to hang out with friends who love to chit chat having an ice cream. This place is perfect for ice cream lover.
The ambiance was decent. We ordered Butterscotch and Javalove. Both of two was just yummy. I enjoyed the butterscotch as it's my favorite. And extra profit is one can easily enjoy the eye soothing making. 

I would love to visit this place again and again because I would love to scream for my ice cream.

It's a small ice cream parlour located just a few steps away from Peter cat. The ice cream is really awesome. Everyone must atleast once try it out. I'm sure they won't be disappointed and they won't settle for just one. You will also enjoy watching the procedure how it is made. The parlour is small not much space is there for sitting but u can enjoy ur ice cream there are standing tables.

Best Ice cream parlour in Kolkata at present

Ambience: Located in the lane of Peter Cat, this small ice cream joint packs the best frozen surprise one can enjoy in Kolkata. It is two storied with the upper floor dedicated solely to ice cream while the lower floor serves shakes and smoothies. The place is small and the walls are filled with the pictures and descriptions of the ice cream they serve. At the side, there is the counter where they make the ice cream rolls in front of you. And trust me, that‚Äôs really a treat to watch.

Food: The ice creams are so well made, that u start salivating the moment they start putting the rolls in the cup. The quantity is enough to serve as the dessert for 2 people at least. Added bonus is the whipped cream and the choco-chips they sprinkle on it. We ordered a Kiwi Blast and a Java Love and both of them were heavenly to taste. The kiwi blast had original kiwi in it while the Java love had coffee powder and chocochips blended in it. Totally overwhelmed with the taste.

Service: Service is good. Cash and Card accepted. Parking available in front of the restaurant.

Overall: Definitely recommended. Must visit.

P.S: I have visited their Carnival cinemas outlet as well, and that is also as good as this one.

Ice cream rolls have been quite popularized in Kolkata for the past 6 months now. This concept has mainly originated from the streets of Bangkok. 
So, coming to the location of this place, it is located right opposite to Aaira. Take the lane beside Au bon pain in park street and walk straight. It'll fall on your right hand side.
Enter and climb the spiral stairs, the ice cream counter is upstairs. It's a small and colourful place. Hardly 6-7 people can sit. We ordered chocolust. I saw the entire process of ice cream making live. It takes around 6 minutes to get it done. 5 ice cream rolls with ample amount of chocolate syrup. Since I don't have a sweet tooth, it was too much for me to finish even half. Two people can share as because it was too sweet. 
I'm gonna come back for their pan flavoured ice cream rolls which is quite famous.

Well... One of the new ice cream joints in town and with a new style of presentation creating sensation among the foodies... Frollz it is!
  Google baba once again paved us the way to locate this ice cream parlour... I must say the outside decoration is a peppy one in a bright neon orangish colour...and a small joint it is indeed! But looks can be decisive too. We went upstairs thru the artificial grass-paved staircases( yeah, one very innovative interior designing to notice)... And found the seats to be occupied (place,place guys...). Anyway we waited patiently and watched in amusement how the icecream rolls are being made over the freedging plate...it's indeed worth visiting there just to watch them make the rolls. We were a bit unhappy to hear that both our choices i.e. kiwi blast and mango blast were unavailable at the moment (that's y I am rating them 4,not 5)... But what they offered us instead ( chocolust and paan blast) were delighting ones. Quantity wise it is quite a lot... One cup is enough for two. Pocket pinch is just perfect... Two of those costs 290 bucks... Which I think a fair game.
 So what u waiting for?  Weather is still hot and humid..find a way to reach frollz and get a freezing delicious treat urself! :)
Cheers and happy eating!!  :)

I must say it was the best Nolen Gur ice cream I ever had. The Chocolust and Mango Blast was equally amazing. The way they make the ice cream rolls is indeed a treat to watch.

I would recommend you to visit this place if you haven't already. You definitely won't be disappointed.

Frollz is for those times of the month when you are craving to satisfy your sweet tooth and don't really care about your waistline.. Started with a chocolust baked ice cream which was enough to awaken the foodie in me with its dark chocolate.. And then came the black forest flavor which was a Pastry disguised in an ice cream.. Trust me fellas you gotta enter this cozy little two storied desert heaven if you wanna know what these devils do to your taste buds.. Truly mesmerising.. Must visit for a quickie.. 
Service and interiors were somewhat acceptable nothing much to brag about that.. Music was groovy..

Came across the recent buzz about the Fried Ice Cream Rolls ? Well ! This is THE FROLLZ ! üòç

This is located in Park Street, very near to Peter Cat. So it has got a very convinient location.

Ambience - This is a small outlet. You get the ice cream upstairs. It has very few seating capacity with 4-5 tools. So it can not accomodate enough. That's a negative point about this place. Plays good music. 

Food - Ordered a Chocolust. It was really amazing. The Ice cream rolls were served with 2 Chocolate sticks. And it is sufficient to share with your friend. üòù 
However I personally feel it is a bit overpriced although. So this should be noted.

Service - As there is quite a lot of crowd here, it takes some time to serve you. But it is worth the wait. üòä

So if you wanna try these yum rolls ? Please do visit here. üòä Won't disappoint you !

This ice cream parlor had created quite a buzz in the town so one day went to check it out. 
It has a small seating arrangement upstairs and can't accommodate more than 7-8 people at a time. Lack of professionalism caused poor service. Half of the menu wasn't available. Disappointed.

Frollz is one thing, if nothing else and that is, worth every rupee you pay for it.

So I had the Chocolust flavour which tasted just amazing and had me savouring it with my eyes closed. Also tried the Cookiespree flavour, with the oreo infusion, which I also loved. The Kiwi flavour is also good for people who, unlike me, like Kiwi. 

Overall, I feel Frollz is worth the money and better than it's counterparts like Baskin and Robbins by leaps and bounds. Definitely worth a try! 
PS: Why does Frolls have 'Fried Ice-cream' in its name?

A small place located in the Peter Cat lane, does wonders when it comes to ice cream rolls. A new concept to Kolkata that has been brilliantly executed and very well received by foodies.

This is a two floor store with the ground floor serving shakes and first floor serving you delectable ice cream rolls in many mouth watering flavors.

I tried Pan and Chocolust flavors. Believe me, both of them were just too good. I would personally give some extra points to Chocolust, as chocolate is my all time favorite in ice creams.

Do give this place a visit, if you are in park street. It is something new for Kolkata as a concept but it definitely deserves much more acceptance. Also, this place is open till 1.00AM. So it can be a respite for people who stay up till late night.

The Frollz ice-cream concept is very new in Kolkata! 
Went today with mommy dearest! She wanted to experiment with this new ice cream parlor. It's easy to locate right next to Loreto College/ School. 
It's a small outlet with two floors. They sell milkshake  as well as ice-cream. 
Frollz service is INEFFICIENCY at its best. They are disorganised, they have all their ingredients all over the place and only one person catering to so many customers. No one is bothered to clean the tabels after the customer leaves. An ice cream which was suppose to take 5-8minutes took him 25-30 minutes. The server is so confused. 
We ordered a black forest Frollz, the 2.5 is only for the excellent ice cream. No complaints here. Both of us loved it. 
I usually never give such a low rating, I hope they improve the service.

Zomato is being very helpful for me in finding out amazing placed in Kolkata. I stumbled upon Frollz while searching for outlets near my office in Park Street. And oh boy, this doesn't disappoint. It was "the" best ice cream roll i have ever had. Out of the 12 flavours available, i ordered black forest. The way the rolls prepared in vanilla and brownie injected with loads of melted chocolate and syrup blends into your mouth feels nothing less than heaven. Dont miss this if you are an icecream/chocolate lover. No reason for me to cut even 1/2 a rating. 
You wont mind spending 145 bucks for this beauty. And the best part, the prices are inclusive of taxes.

Fried ice-cream rolls are all the craze in the world now.Coming to this place, which is one of the very few places serving this kind in the city, I must say, this quite lives up to the hype. Somewhat. It is a very small place,not spacious enough. However, the staff are very gracious.Coming to the flavours, I tasted the Kiwi and the Nutella Banana variant.The cup portions are huge, can be generously shared by two people.But the thing that disappointed me the most, was the flavours used, or the lack of them.The kiwi cup tasted of much too artificial flavour than of natural kiwi pulp and the nutella banana barely had any nutella, it was more of banana fried rollz with brown food colors.To top that, the ice-cream was much too dry, not exactly how it is supposed to be.To end it, would just say this, if you guys work with generous helpings of the natural ingredients, it would make a world lot of difference to the taste and will invariably take it a notch higher.

Though tiny, its a nice place to hangout with friends. 
I had my 1st fried ice-cream from here a few weeks ago. We ordered 2 flavours - paan & chocolust. 
Both were yummy. Paan had all the flavours of the traditional benarasi paan. & chocolust is a treat to all chocolate lovers. 
A must visit for all.

Fried ice creams are the talk of the town lately as far as ice-creams are concerned. And this place have been striking all the right chords.

Located on the floor above TRO (The Rollover) this place is a small one with hardly 7 to 8 seats present. But in that small cringy space that it has, it is done up quietly nicely i must say. And with the popularity that it is gaining in recent times, consider yourself lucky if you get a seat at all!!!! Take the lane adjacent to Au Bon Pain... And then it's just a few minutes walk...

Coming to the part which i like most about this place... That is the fried ice-creams rolls... I would say they deserve a straight 4/5... They provide you with multiple choices starting with gulaab, chocolust, java love (coffee), cookiespree, and even the bengali fav nolen gur and many more so as to speak...

I have tried their nolen gur, cookiespree, java love, chocolust, kiwi blast, pinacolada... Each and everyone of them were good... But definitely as the chocolate lover that i am, cookiespree and chocolust takes the bait... 5/5 for both of them... üòÉ

A nice little place to find that child in you craving for Ice cream!!!! üòÉüòÉ Keep it up frollz!!!!

Fried Icecreams have become very popular lately and there are many new outlets serving these delicacies across the city.Frollz is one of them and is quite popular so we gave it a visit.It is located in park street,middleton row,a little ahead of Peter Cat on the right side.As we entered we saw that at the ground floor they were serving some other fast food items and on the 1st floor the ice cream is being served.We opted for the Kiwi Blast and it was prepared in front of us and served.It tasted pretty good not very sweet though but the kiwi sauce with it was brilliant.The pocket pinch was approx 170 bucks but it was worth the money.
Will visit again to try more flavours.

Flavored ice creams, sundaes, smoothies etcetera are now obsolete. Ice cream rolls have gained immense popularity and are quite a number of chains serving these innovative rolls have popped up over a period of somewhat 2 to 3 months. Judging by the looks of it they are damn delicious and the way they are made right in front of your eyes is surely a treat. This outlet has being located in Park Street definitely enjoys it's perks of a fair share of customers at any given time of the day. We had to wait for a good 15 minutes before placing our order. We opted for Cookiespree and Paan flavored rolls of which the latter was better in terms of taste, smoothness and ingredients used. The beetle leaves were crushed right in front of our eyes and finally we're topped with saunf for an authentic Paan Wala taste. Each spoonful would remind  you of the royal banarasi paans. Cookiespree consisted of loads of Oreo biscuit crushed in it topped with yet another Oreo and Hershey's Chocolate sauce for a sinful sweet treat. Pricing is very decent and they do not add tax which is very surprising. Rush to this cute little place for a super duper yummilicious ice cream date.

Icecream is something which can lift up my mood anytime and everytime. Wanted to try out Frollz after hearing positive reviews. Located near Loreto College main gate, Frollz is very near Peter Cat and can be easily located because of its orange colour. It is a small shop but you get a variety of icecreams and they all look yummy. I tried out the butterscotch variety and it was delicious. The way they make it very unique as well. I had to give them a 3 because of hygiene standards. The shop opens at 12o'clock. When I went at 12:30, I had to wait for a long time and they were cleaning their garbage and the tables. The man who was cleaning it was wearing gloves and after that without removing those gloves he was about to make the icecream. This is when I and my friend pointed out that he should remove those gloves. Then he did that. This was really unexpected.

Ice cream is always best in any form. This rolled ice cream has become a new trend. The flavors of this parlour are unique and amazing. We took Black forest and cookiespree among all the mouthwatering flavors. Both were delicious. One thing I would like to advice to the parlour to keep the ingredients in a clean place.

Their ice-cream roll concept is new in the town.
Totally fresh made after you place the order. Ambience is nice but the place is cozy. Hardly few peoples can go and have a seat. I tried chocolate excess and mango but the blackforest tastes like candy. Choco excess is good.

Went to Frollz after lunch with a friend. Decided to share just one butterscotch icecream roll. Sitting and watching the icecream roll being made from scratch was an unique experience in itself. Two spoons into the icecream and we decide that even though we were completely full it was just too good to share. So went ahead and ordered the Nolen gur too. Both the flavours were equally‚Äã good and not overpowering. Now wondering how to go back to regular icecreams after this.

Very recently Me and my friend where looking for an ice cream parlour after having lunch at Park Street when we came across the place.Its a cute little place which has maximum of 7-8 people seating arrangement.They make delicious rolled ice cream.The concept is a new one in Kolkata.The way they make the entire ice cream from the scratch right in front of you is really impressive.We ordered for the butterscotch and the nolen gur flavour ice cream rolls.Both of them were really good.The bill came up to 250rs inclusive of the taxes.It was totally worth it :)

Live ice cream rolls originating from Bangkok is the fast growing dessert now in Kolkata. This outlet serve some nice flavours of it. We ordered the chocolust. It was a coffee based flavour mixed with chocolate. A rich flavoured one. The cream served on top is yum-yum! A nice stop to crave in for some dessert.

This was my first trip with a couple of friends to the much talked about destination, and I absolutely loved it !¬†We tried the Cookiespree, Black Forest and Pan flavors. Cookiespree was THE BEST. Oreos and ice cream, of course it was perfect.The seating area is a li'l too small, with no more than 10 people making it seem very crowded.¬†The quantity is well worth the price, and the experience of watching the rolls being made is intriguing, to say the very least.A cozy ambience, and yummy desserts to tuck right into, can make anybody's day.¬†Will surely visit again !

An ice cream parlour which is talk of the town, and well they deserve to be. Long time waiting on my to-go list, finally ticked off last friday. Live fried ice cream rolls, exciting experience to watch and to try, both. We tried Nolen gur and Chocolust flavour, both turned out to be very tasty. Portions are good according to the price, since the ice creams are fried, they take time to melt, so you can take your time and finish it off well. Loved the place, will surely visit again.

A small cute outlet in parkstreet serves such amazing flavours of icecream rolls. 
Today we tried the Paan and Nolen Gur. 
Loved how patiently the icecream roll was made and the quality was top notch. 
Paaaan one was the best. Nolen Gur we had after the Pan one, so couldnt enjoy much. So if you gotta have Nolen Gur have it first, then have the other ones. üòãüòãüòã

A really good place for ice cream in a food heaven like Park Street. 
A variety of Ice cream rolls are available here and the making process is a really interesting thing to watch. And finally the taste... GREAT..!!! And they are not over-priced. Rs. 300 is enough for two.
The only thing to be noted that here you have to have time in your hand. This place remains crowded almost all the time and only one guy is there to make rolls one by one.

This has to be one of the greatest inventions of mankind. We ordered for kiwi, nolen gur and paan ice cream rolls. The process of making these ice cream rolls is fascinating: they dice up the main ingredient (and it's all natural, mind you), add creamy milk to it, spread out the mixture on their freezing plate and roll it up just in time to serve you a bowl-full of delight. Their prices for that quantity of ice cream (plus their expertise and technique in making something so perfect) are most reasonable -- the range is between Rs 125 to 160 only, + taxes. The shop is located next to Golden Spoon, on Middleton Row, on your way to Loreto College from Au Bon Pain on the same side of the road as Peter Cat! They have a bright orange colour theme and therefore easy to locate. I'm not giving them a full rating for two reasons: a. the milk could have been creamier, and b. their place is tiny (since the rolls take time to make understandably a larger seating space would probably make more sense). These ice creams are an ABSOLUTE must try!

There are varities of flavour but the most uncommon are  pan, nolen gur. The ambience is also nice. The doodled walls n the grass stairs looks very nice. We ordered pan, java love, nolen gur and black current ice cream rolls.

Ordered java love prepared with coffee and brownie. Watching the proceedure of making the ice cream is very interesting :) its such a new concept. Really. Loved it. When it arrived..it tasted sooo different. It had a very distinct flavour to it. Moreover liked it. Would come again to try the other variants. @rohit shaw

Excellent !  Didn't expect such a display of quality ice cream in Kolkata !
We had ordered a Kiwi Blast. It had a slight tangy taste. It's  topped with a Slice of Kiwi. Loved it.

Also had a Black Forest. This looked the best. But taste was nothing extra ordinary. Topped with 3 cherries.

Lastly, the Paan Flavour. This is the one I can never forget. A rush of cool , minty and paan flavours in the mouth. Being the cheapest, never expected it to be that good. A 10 on 10.

Ice Cream Rolls are the next talked thing in the City of Joy. There have been so many brands endorsing this product by importing them from the streets of Bangkok. It's a visual delight to see the ice creams being made live in front of you with fresh fruits and other stuffs. While we were on a walk solely based to explore the summer cooler options in Park Street area, we just couldn't miss Frollz.
Located on the mezzanine floor of The Roll Over building, it has a few options to try from. Ambience and decor is basic. It is not that we expected a lot from here. Tried the following flavours - 
Pinacolada - They didn't use fresh pineapple or coconut cream but synthetic flavours and syrup. Presentation was good but the flavours could have been more original when there were scopes of making it. 
Black Forest - The case is same here again. Flavours used were synthetic. Cherries could have been pasted, instead they used Alpenliebe Strawberry Jelly Burst candies. Tasted good but it could definitely have been better if served original.
Tastewise the ice creams were good. Presentation was nice as well. But somewhere the charisma of the ice cream rolls were missing as all of them were made of synthetic flavours although there have been scopes of making them from original fruits and chocolates. Recommended? Yes if you're really keen on trying out the ice cream rolls in this area. Else I would say that there are better options for ice cream in this area. And for such 'frollz', there are other places as well to serve you these beauties in the original form. That's it! Happy Dining! :)

The ice creams r really good and tasty. I would suggest to try their best butterscotch ice cream rolls and chocolust.

This is a little space located in Park Street that has cute staircase, decent interior and good music playing. But that's about it. I went there yesterday and had cookiespree, which was okay. Nothing great. After a few bites, I found a hair in the ice-cream and left it. It takes around 5 minutes to make each ice-cream so if you're in a hurry, be prepared to miss whatever it is that you're hurrying for. When we went to clear the bill, the cashier had charged us for the ice-cream with the hair in it too. Naturally, we refused to pay for that ice-cream. I would not recommend going to this place.

An ice-cream parlour with a unique way of preparing your ice-cream right in front of you. They have 12 varieties of flavours for you to choose from. One serving of ice-cream should be sufficient enough to satiate your sugar pangs.
The best part is the overall presentation.
Indulge in the sinful treats!
P.S. The place doesn't have huge seating capacity. So if you are going with a big group, that may not be feasible.

While many customers would like to witness the ice-cream being made, people like me feel perturbed by the noise. Yet, I recommend this place to all friends with a sweet tooth as are looking for some refreshment.

Located in Park Street, Middleton Row. Head straight from Peter Cat towards Loreto Church‚Äã,you will spot it on your right hand side.
The fried ice cream rolls is a recent turn on summer trend, so it had been in my wish list for quite long. So finally after a lunch we decided to pay it a visit. It was a great experience to witness the live making of the fried ice cream rolls.
The interior was quite good, I found the green spiral staircase to be very intriguing. The only drawback was that the AC wasn't working properly.

We ordered KIWI BLAST it was good in taste and the ice cream rolls doesn't melt fast as the r regular ice creams does. We would visit here to try out the other options. The bill came for 166 bucks.

We went to Frollz to check the new-in-the-city fried ice cream rolls. Its a beautiful little joint, just beside Golden Spoon and above TRO. They make the ice cream right in front of you and it looks great. We tried the Cookiespree, Nolen Gur and Black Forest one. Cookiespree was delicious, chocolaty. Nolen Gur had a soothing ice cream flavour which is perfect for a summer evening. Black Forest was the best, and they put whipped cream on the rolls with cherries which makes it all the more awesome. Medium priced, but filling.

I ordered the Black forest Ice cream roll and it was 10/10.

Well this is one among the different types of ice cream which you get in this city..the concept is FRIED ICECREAM ROLLS...the ice cream rolls are really crisp and wonderfully shaped..i had the JAVA love...as it stated it did taste like coffee...bt the part which stole the show away was the whipped white cream which was laid on the ice cream rolls with nescafe powder sprinkled on it..the cream along with the rolls mixed perfectly and melt in the mouth smoothly creating a flavour which u hardly get to experience...i absolutely loved this one..and will be back to try out the other ones..

Fried ice creams being the recent trend, I visited this ice cream parlour to taste their fried rolls.

Frollz was in my bucketlist for quite a long time now and as i was in park street yesterday, we two hopped in this cute parlour.

They also have a vegetarian food counter on the ground floor and the dessert parlour is on the 1st floor.
Quite liked the spiral staircase and the interior with images of their ice creams printed on the walls which makes it easier for u to order.
We wanted the BLACK FOREST ONE. But as it was unavailable, we had to settle for a COOKIESPREE.
Well, now coming to the ice cream.
The ice cream was made out of oreo cookies so it has to be delicious, and there was also an oreo cookie placed on top..
Overall, i liked the ice cream, it was nothing extraordinary though. But i really liked the quantity that they served. It was a total value for money..
I am definitely re visiting this place to try out the various other flavours they have and would also like to recommend this ice cream parlour to others.

probably the first ice parlor i visited which offers ice cream rolls :D had chance to taste their black forest roll .... and was truly amazing.. that flavor of that blend of fresh cream , chocolate , strawberry sauce was really great. ¬†enjoyed a lot ! their sitting arrangement is very limited and claustrophobic.

Saw a lot of people sharing videos of this new concept of ice cream rolls being made....so finally decided to try out this really interesting and innovative dessert ¬†from Frollz . ¬†It was worth it....probably the yummiest ice cream I've ever had...I took the black forest flavour ....there are a lot of other flavours to choose from...wish to try all of them.¬†
The place was a bit small...but loved the ambience, and the staff were quite friendly too...Price is a bit on the higher range inclusive of tax.

Loved their ice cream rolls. Visiting Frollz was in my wishlist for a long time and finally I could tick it off my wishlist. They made fresh ice cream rolls in front of us. We had ordered Kiwi Blast and Chocolust. Kiwi blast was highly refreshing and there was a blast of flvours in our mouth, this is the best natural ice cream I've ever had. 
Choco Lust was also nice, it tasted like normal chocolate ice cream. 
I'm glad there's places like this in Kolkata. Will visit again.

Fried Icecream is the latest concept these days where the ice cream is prepared in front of our eyes. The process of making it is creative and quite interesting to watch. I was recently invited at Frollz, which is one of the pioneers of fried ice cream in Calcutta. 

In the process of making the live ice cream, the base, the ingredients and the toppings are first assembled over a metal pan, which is kept cold. These are beaten to mix them together and finally the mixture is well spreaded over the pan. It takes just a few minutes for the mixture to freeze. It is then scrapped off from the pan, in the form of rolls. These ice cream rolls are served with necessary toppings. 

At Frollz, there are a number of flavours to choose from like Strawberry Blast, Pan, Nolen Gur, Kiwi Blast, Gulabo, Butter Scotch, Black Forest, etc. A number of other flavours are available apart from the chosen ones. You can make customisations as required. 

I decided to try Java Love while my partner opted for Kiwi Blast. Java Love is basically for coffee lovers having a sweet tooth. The ice cream is made with freshly prepared copy paste, home made brownies and chocolate syrup. The quantity was appreciable. The texture of the ice cream was really good. It tasted brilliant, with the coffee and chocolate flavours creating a wonderful mix. 

The Kiwi Blast was equally good. What I loved to see was a fresh kiwi being used in front of us and not any artificial flavour. It was sweet and excellent. If you love kiwi, you're sure to fall in love with this. 

Both the flavours were good in terms of taste, texture and quality. The pricing is pretty cheap compared the quantity of ice cream served per potion. Also, these fried ice creams don't melt soon. So you can take your own sweet time to finish it !

An innovative dessert recipe with a difference!! The ice cream is made in front of you by mixing the vanilla base with the flavour of your choice which could be strawberry to chocolate to mango to paan to nolen Gur,etc etc.The frozen ice cream is rolled into pieces and served with similar toppings.Good quantity.Ok pricing.The shop in park Street is small going up a windy staircase with limited seating - mainly take away.Good overall.Something new.

Finally went to check out this summer's trend of ice cream rolls, freshly rolled on live counter right in from of you. 
Convenient location, walk towards right from Peter Cat. A small joint, downstairs is the Tro-the rollover; already had lunch so didn't get a chance to check out their bite sized rolls. The Frollz is upstairs, which has a little sitting area.
When we reached, we were the only customers there. Their AC wasn't working. Thumbs down for that; they  can't even have air conditioned sitting area in summer. 
We ordered a choco lust. Would've ordered other flavors but the lack of AC made us decide against it. 
Now coming to the ice cream part. They have some ingredients prepared already. Like the icing cream and batter, once those are finished they make more so customers don't have to wait for too long. They have a common white batter for every flavor and then add the specific one while making the ice cream rolls. The whole process takes about 4-5 minutes and kinda fascinating to watch. That's what mainly attracts people. And the ice cream rolls don't melt fast like regular ice cream. 
By the time we were eating, other customers arrived and we got to see how they make the mango and blackforest ones. 
Pocket pinch : 189/- price is a bit on the higher side when keeping the quantity in mind.

It's near KFC,park street. Surely one of the best icecream I ever had. Sitting arrangements are though not sufficient and its taste wins over hearts. The way they make the icecream rolls is lovely to watch.Its quite famous as it was crowded on a Saturday eve.All over a very good experience. More visits to this place. Efficiency,ambience at its best.

The fried or ice pan ice cream made its way to India quite a while ago. This skillful mixing and rolling of  milk or cream with desired fillings over a chilled teppan, a favorite of East Asia has wooed the Indian ice cream lovers victoriously!

Branding this style to kolkata is FROLLZ or more conveniently ‚ÄòFried ice cream rolls‚Äô.From fruity bliss to chocolaty indulgences the fried ice cream rolls come in a variety of fresh flavors to choose from.

From our favorite summer fruit like mango to exotic breeds like kiwi and from chocolaty specials to black forests you can watch your favorite ice creams being whipped and rolled from scratch here!
Furthermore, this undeniably fancy treat wont be heavy on your pockets. Great stuff for really affordable price! Indulge in your favorite flavors like nolen gur, beetle leaf (pan), rose, oreo cookie and many more at your closest Frollz outlet.

If you watch MasterChef you know that half the excitement of food is watching it being prepared ‚Äìthe ‚Äòtheatre element‚Äô. The costume of the chef, the dramatic flame of the stove, the slow-motion sprinkling of ingredients ‚Äì the entire production is ready (sets, props, actors, special effects and all). And there are few things more exciting to watch being prepared than ice-cream. Frollz does exactly that ‚Äì the cream goes from liquid to perfectly icy rolls in a matter of minutes all of which happens right before your eyes.

Frollz and their fried ice cream was on my wish list from long. It was a brilliant experience to see ice roll making in front of us. And also the beautiful decoration.
The place is small with a limited seating arrangement. But their ice cream beats everything.
I had the Black Forest one. And it was very good in taste. They prepared it in front of us within 10mins.
Prices are also reasonable.

A great location and great value for money, Frollz also has a savoury joint on the floor below. Although vegetarian, the food is amazing, especially the Billets and Rice Bowls. 
The ice cream being rolled is worth watching and adds up to the excitement of the experience as a whole.
The best part about this place is it's friendly staff, well conditioned interiors and value for money. 

Must haves: Baked Mushroom Billet, Au Gratin Billet, Choco lust ice cream , Biriyani and Dal Makhni

Visited this outlet absolutely close to my college . It is walking distance from KFC on the right hand side of Middleton Row while walking towards Loreto House and Loreto College. Tried the black forest which looked absolutely tempting. Service was prompt and the place is nice for a walk in dessert. Frollz serves different flavours of fried ice cream. Something which became highly popular in Thailand. Glad it's in Cal now. Would highly recommend a visit.

I was really excited about trying ice cream rolls for the first time. We ordered nolen gur, coffee and black forest rolls. However nolen gur was fine but the other two flavours were a bit disappointing. A small place ambience is okayish. We wer√® delighted to see the live counters but somehow the taste and quality of the ice cream disappointed us.

BEING AN ICECREAM LOVER MYSELF, FROLLZ HAS BECOME THE NEW HUB IN TOWN FOR ME. THERE ARE A LOT OF DESSERT OPTIONS HERE. IT IS CENTRALLY LOCATED & VERY MUCH POCKET FRIENDLY. THE AMBIENCE IS ALSO VERY GOOD. THE SEATING ARRANGEMENTS ARE ALSO DECENT. NOLEN GUR & BLACK FOREST ARE THE TWO SPECIFIC FLAVOURS WHICH I WOULD RECOMMEND FOR ALL ICECREAM LOVERS .¬†
A HAPPY CUSTOMER.

Pan fried ice cream a concept is very famous in Thailand and rolled over(quite literally) and brought to Kolkata by this brand, Have tried live ice cream at other places but not in rolls anywhere. Its hard doesn't melt easily and its heavy for stomach and Pocket friendly. i ordered Alphonso MAngo flavor, it was better thn my expectations. ¬†They used real Alphonso Mango, Ice cream mix (liquid form) and some mango homemade syrup were the ingredients and its good and not over done. would love to try other ice creams from the menu.
Its a Original Natural Ice cream Experience one can say.

Ice cream made in ice grill, infused with fruits and a lot of other things has always been an East Asian method of preparation. Never knew Kolkata had this awesome place hidden away somewhere in Park Street. 
We tried the famous Choco Lust (it is known to be the best, here) and Nutella (without the bananas as the original is Nutella Banana...cause wasn't so sure how the combination would be like) and they were downright delicious. Chocolate doesn't need any further explanation. You got to try in order to know. Well to me, they tasted better than most of the ice creams they serve at famous ice cream parlours of the city. 
Will visit again for the fruit flavours!

I was delighted to get such an ice cream parlor where you can witness the making of ice cream in a very innovative way. The cold pan they use for the preparation and the process they follow is very delightful. They have quite ana rray of flavors avaialbale though I was a bit dissapointed with the nolen gur flavour. The other two i tried was really exotic.

Pan fried ice cream a concept very famous in Thailand and rolled over(quite literally) and brought to Kolkata by this brand, Have tried hand made ice cream at other places but not in rolls anywhere. Its hard doesn't melt easily and its heavy for stomach and well as on pockets. Tried a pan flavor, it was super cool, double freshness, firstly its ice cream and secondly its pan. Its actually all the pan ingredients and its good and not over done. Eager to try other offerings as well. Eager to try kiwi blast also, do inform when its available. 

Some suggestions: The light is a bit dim, pls have adequate lighting, the wash basin was also not working and also the servers were not aware of cashtag rewards and was not able to provide the same.
