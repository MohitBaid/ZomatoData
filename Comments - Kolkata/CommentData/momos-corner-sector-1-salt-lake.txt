Momo's Corner is a small kiosk in the swimming pool area of SALTLAKE. Swimming pool area is one of the happening place in saltlake for street food n adda. 
It is a pure vegetarian outlet. Momos are perfectly steamed. Momos are served with its traditional spicy chutney and soup. I have been having momos here for years and it never disappoints. A must try here.

Pocket pinch for veg momo - 40rs for 5 pieces with soup.

This is one of the kiosks located at Swimming pool. They sell only vegetarian momos. The momos are good and soft. Served hot with their house made momo sauce. Priced at 30 or higher they are a good and light snack.
