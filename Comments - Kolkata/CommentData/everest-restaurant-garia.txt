great place to have chinise dishes in GARIA. The food quality and quantity is awsome.Have almost tried every dish from the menu and all are good. Though being small in area you can see people eagerly waiting for the dishes getting preprared before your own eyes even me. Recently they added some more dishes especially choupsey,which tastes great.

Don't miss Chicken Lung-fung soup. The proportions are good in every dish especially the soups. The soups are one of the best in this area..

The best Chinese food at this price. Being almost a regular here, I love the way they prepare everything infront of you after you've ordered. Each and everything tastes great and the quantity is more than sufficient considering the prices. Though it's a small place and cannot accommodate a big crowd. But still shoutout to this place to suffice our hunger everytime we are short on money.
