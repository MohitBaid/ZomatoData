This is a small restaurant serving veg thali at a reasonable price. The restaurant mainly serves regular thali and a special thali where the main course dishes change every day and repeated on weekly basis. The thali consists of 3 phulkas, rice and salad along with 3 more veg dishes. If you prefer special tali then they include buttermilk, papad, sweet and pickle.
The food is good

A home food delivery service in the city, Urban Rasoi is a blessing for vegetarian office goers like me. Came across these guys today and decided to try. 
They have a fixed menu. Today they had a veg meal composing of Frankie's, dal chawal, sprout salad and dahi. 
The food came in neatly packaged boxes and tasted really well. The rice had curry leaves and a distinct taste, the Frankie's were cooked to perfection.
I paid 120/- for my meal and I feel the pricing is reasonable considering that they dint charge for delivery.

Will try food from their kitchen again.

A friend had suggested Urban Rasoi, so one afternoon i gave it a shot and yes i wasn't disappointed. The packaging was way above my expectations. so  a big thumbs up to their presentation. Little details like this add up to their value :)  The food was delicious, simple home cooked north indian thali with Rajma masala, aloo ki sabji,  roti, rice, salad and Anardana raita.. The raita was delectable :)  
The drawback was delayed delivery which resulted in cold food.. Nevertheless, there is always scope for improvement. :) All the best for your venture guys...

Simple homemade food with very good taste.. I am delighted by the food quality. Amount is best for the quantity and quality. I would like to additionally thank Varun(urban rasoi) for the complimentary mini Samosa's. We 25 people in our team were so happy to have such good food. The menu customization while ordering is a great creative idea. Will try other options soon... Keep up the brilliant job.

Ordered lunch thali when I came across their Facebook page. Packaging was excellent, made my expectations rise and I was definitely not disappointed with the food quality and taste. Simple yet nutritious. The moderate pricing acts like the icing on the cake. They could consider increasing the quantity for ogres like me but for an average human, it shall suffice. Their raita was so delicious that I could not resist signing up for their monthly package. Please note: I had ordered on a sweltering Monday and surprisingly, I was given a free Frooti (some respite!) with a hand written note which just added to the customer satisfaction. Shows how they are going the extra mile to delight their customers. Strongly recommended!

I decided to experiment with this place and ordered their thali for office delivery. Delivery was quite delayed (which is ok) due to dearth of delivery boys and ultimately, the owner himself came to provide me the food. The thali was well packed in a plastic food tray and food presentation was nice. Thali consisted of 3 pcs plain phulka (ok), aloo capsicum (much below expectations, very low on spice content and low on taste), sweet pickle (okayish – nothing great), raita (very tasty with some cucumber and onion content), biryani (nice – very balanced vegetable content including babycorns also) and some raw onions as salad. Priced at just Rs. 120/-, quantity and quality served is very decent. However, they strictly need to work on taste and also ensure that food delivered is hot or atleast warm!

They are a new startup, so I wish them best of luck in their future endeavours.

Cheers!

Convenience at best. Food quality and quantity both are good. The food tray is also sturdy unlike Gupta Brothers or other delivery outlets. 
Less points coz they missed the delivery twice in two weeks. 
Also, a suggestion - when the plan ends you should communicate that the plan has ended and if we would like to continue it.

A must try! Simple tasty home food at extremely reasonable price available at your doorstep! Loved the packing as well! Great solution for office lunch especially for those who miss home food! 

Suggestion: If the weekly menu is available online, it would be helpful. :)

The food was really nice. The first pleasant surprise was to see that u use Pickji for delivery, my husbank works there. The presentation of the food was really nice and so was the taste, the next surprise was a hand written note which i found post my lunch, which was very touching as u give personal touch to the food. 
Good job guyzz & keep using Pickji..:)
