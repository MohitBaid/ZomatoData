Their speciality is mutton tikiya and laccha paratha. They serve the best tikiya in the city and the sweetest laccha paratha. These two items are what they became famous for. Try these two items and not stupid egg or chicken rolls. Go for the mutton tikiya roll or tikiya paratha separately.

Looking for a fast food corner in beck bagan. No wonder there will be rush in the counter but it serves one of the best fast food in the city. Sumptuous and yummy. Will fill you tummy but leave you wanting to visit the place again.You ought to have the double egg chicken roll at this place.
