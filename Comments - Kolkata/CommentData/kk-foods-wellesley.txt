Only for the food i am giving a 3.0 because it tasted to some extent same like other Chinese restaurants!Now what went wrong is that i ordered via FoodPanda and it was my worst experience!I had to keep a balance between my anger and hunger!45 minutes past the delivery time,i called to inquire the food joint what my order status was.The reply came-"SIR,THE PERSON WHOM WE HAD SENT IS LOST ON THE WAY,SO WE HAD SENT ANOTHER PERSON TO DELIVER YOUR FOOD"...
Your question might be,"WHERE IS YOUR HOME ANINDYA?"
My home is a 15-20 minutes walk..from Ripon Street(KK Foods) to Lytton Hotel at Sudder Street!

The first thing I tried was momo because yes if you go to some Chinese joint then the first thing you order for that taste is momos. My first experience was not at all good. Momo is something which should have good amount of fillings with a pinch of sauce to dip it on but the momo out here lacked both. I should have given it a 1 star but I didn't because I can't judge the restaurants menu by just having the momos. So it's a three star from me.

Just finished my dinner with their mixed chilli garlic fried rice and chicken in black bean sauce!! They surpassed my expectations!!‚ò∫ Thats y I m so quick to review them!! ‚ò∫
I ordered through swiggy, so cant comment on their ambience or service!!
Starting from the packaging :-D
Well packed, hot n fresh food was delivered to me!!
The quantity was huge!! One rice item and one side dish are suffice for two persons. I ordered for myself and later had to share it with my roommate.
The fried rice was so tasty with lots of prawn, shredded chicken n fried egg in it. The side dish was tasty as well! The flavour differed from that of typical black bean sauce gravy, still I loved it!! Chicken pieces were very well cooked!!
More importantly, the food z so cheap!!‚ù§ :-D
Wish to try the other dishes soon...‚ò∫‚ù§

After noodle king this is the place to satisfy your hunger.
Ambience is good as compared to noodle king.
Food quality as well as quantity is good. Babycorn was not upto the mark but fried rice was.
The guy named Faiz was also gentle to us.

Never again.
The food lacks taste, not worth it. Worst was their Pan fried monos, atrocious. Almost same gravy preparation in all dishes.
A lot better options available around, go for ACS or Food king instead.
