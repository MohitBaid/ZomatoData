The worst Mutton Biryani I ever had in my entire life. Infact I would not call that Biryani. One cannot even expect to get this type of Biryani in Kolkata. Its better to have Biryani from any roadside stalls than to have here. 1.0 rating for the food irrespective of any taste. Thank you.

Went to this place twice and I must say that both the experiences were satisfactory. On both the occasions we tried indian and chinese and both here are splendid. Although the items were basic but they were cooked well. The menu contained mixed hakka noodles, chilli chicken, kashmiri poluo and chicken butter masala for the main course. It will be a delight for Newtown office people to try the buffet, which I will choose next time. The price was also very affordable.

Food quality is far below than average. It's mentioned chapati in menu i got Tawas roti. Which also not properly cooked.
Paneer is like they added paneer in any gravy n dispatched to me. Also paneer was heavy spicy.

It took more than 30 minutes to confirm my order and more than 2 hours to deliver the order. I had to contact zomato customer care for the hassle..Thanks to zomato for the support.

The alu is always d star of biriyani but here firstly alu was burnr n secondly it looked like someone had eaten 3/4 of the alu pc n packed 1/4 of it..from no angle was it kolkata biriyani.was a total waste of money.so much so that i feel like puking packing n sending back to them as thats how shitty the biriyani was. I wish i cud rate a big big 0 to them.

The food was really awesome. I was in two minds as I never ordered veg from any restaurant, so when I received my food I was really on cloud 9. In this heavy downfall that guy came to deliver where most of the restaurants were closed for online orders. The food was really fresh and hot. And moreover it tasted too good.
Thank you Opt in for your awesome service. Looking forward to order more from you guys!!!

Due to very few options of ordering online at the place i stay , i once tried out food from this restaurant inspite of the already unfavorable reviews about the place. Sad to say , the reviews are right. The packaging was very bad , the food arrived too late. That gives you an idea about the service aspect. Coming to the taste , none of the items were good. Chilly chicken for instance tasted like chicken pieces dipped in tomato ketchup.

I had ordered chicken biriyani, first the food reached 1 hour late, then the packing of the food I guess even road side vendors can do better packing. Now comes the quality of the biriyani, if you want to taste the worst possible biriyani on this planet, this is the place you need to go. 
It looked like dog food, it was greasy, and smelled and tasted like puke.

And guess the price? 180 bucks. 

One advise to the management, Beta tumse naa hooo paayega! This place needs to be closed.

Food almost always never comes on time. average waiting time is more than two hours. So if you have that luxary, pls go ahead, otherwise avoid it like plague.

Food quality also sub-par.

Zomato should exclude these kind of restaurants from their listings, which of course, they will never do.

We had ordered for home delivery, the delivery was on time. They had taken the late order @ 9pm. Which was rejected by another restaurant. So we were greatful to opt in for that.
We had ordered Tawa Roti, Tandoori Roti, Chicken Butter masala.
The low part of the entire thing was the Tandoori roti was not really from the tandoor and was rubbery, on the other the Tawa roti was big n soft and tasted good. Chicken butter masala tasted really good but the pieces were small as per the amount charged.
Overall it was an OK experience.

If you're looking for fresh food, this is definitely not the right place to come to. I came here with 8 friends for dinner and we ordered these things - chicken curry, chicken tikka masala, tandoori roti, crispy chilli baby corn, spring roll, aalu matar, paneer tikka masala, veg biryani, daal tadka, butter naan and masala kulcha. Everything served to us was cold and didn't taste like it was freshly made. The food was too spicy and salt was hard to find, which spoiled the taste if there was any. Masala kulcha was more like masala paapad; there was no filling inside it and it wasn't even near to a simple kulcha. Tandoori roti and chicken both were not cooked enough to be eaten by humans. Biryani was so amazing that it left a color on our hands (something to be remembered for sure) and it was cooked with so much love that you could see the oil all over your plate.
Also, these guys here were really too keen to serve food to us that they didn't wait for us to finish one thing before dropping the other onto our plates. The food isn't worth the prices. 
P.S. : They don't have a functional washroom :P

I ordered our dinner which was one of the worst experiences. The chilly chicken was so salty that we could not eat.The mutton kasha had pieces of uncooked meat.The chicken Bryan was a mess as it was sandy. We threw all the food and had to rely on home cooked Maggie instead. Not worth of rating.The food ordered also arrived late.Hate to give negative reviews but it was a total waste of food and the evening dinner.

It was my birthday party and we pre booked the full floor.. The staff co operated with us and no extra charge.  Ambiance is okish, compared to other restaurants. No decorations as much. But tasty and spicy food at their best and as we instructed. I ordered veg Kolhapuri and paneer tikka masala. The quantity of the dishes was enough for 2 people  and the food was very tasty.  My friends tried chicken murg kabab, cholle kabab, chicken kohlapuri, reshmi butter masala, butter naan, mutton rogan josh, all were well cooked. Though the Butter tandoori Roti was bit hard. Recommended.

I would like to try their chinese food as well.

Being bored with other food joints, we ordered for Veg pulao, Tandoori roti, Paneer butter masala and Chicken Reshmi kabab for home delivery from this restaurant. 

Delivery Time: The delivery was within 45 minutes. 
Taste of food: The Pulao suit our taste buds and the smell was nice. Paneer butter masala was slight sweet taste and very mildly spiced. thus making it an excellent gravy. The kabab was also up to the mark.
I would recommend to try their food. They also give discount coupons like we got a coupon for 15% discount on our next bill and we are going to order again coming weekend.

Amazing food specially the kababs and the tandoori.. We loved the chicken pahari kabab and fish tikka. One of my friend recommended this newly created restaurant. They also serve variety of Indian and Chinese dish. We ordered manchow soup and clear soup. Both were nice. The main course was also up to the mark. They also provide 600ml and 2 ltr cold drinks for delivery. Will soon order from my office as well.  The food can be considered more than average. Overall I am happy with the service and food quality.

A splendid lunch is how I'd describe my experience at Opt In. Located near to DLF 2, this newly-opened restaurant has been quite a delight. They have recently started with home delivery only and very soon starting dine out as well. The menu contains Tandoori, Indian and Chinese dishes and they have vast variety as well. We ordered home delivery for 4 of us, with Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Rashmi Kabab, Mixed Fried Rice, Chilli Chicken, Garlic Chicken, Congee Chicken. The food was sumptuous, the flavours so well-blended. The Kabab was great but Garlic Chicken was bit more spicy. Considering the amount that they serve, it's moderately priced; even the delivery time is good. The menu price includes all taxes, though they charge for containers. The main advantage is they can also provide cold drinks for home delivery.

I'd strongly recommend Opt In; as I myself will be going there soon to give the other dishes on the menu a try as well.
