This restaurant is located in kestopur, just opposite to the Assistant guest inn. It's very pocket friendly family restaurant. According to price food is very good. Pan-fried noodles and steamed rice are really yummy. Over all it's a nice Chinese restaurant within budget.

Visited twice .First time it was good.Had Sweet and soup soup,mixed fried rice and garlic chicken.taste was ok,but the most disappointing thing was the service time,they took around 50 mins to service the main course,which was annoying as the ambience is not up to the mark.
My last visit was pathetic.Had Thai soup ,chilli paper chicken mixed rice and chicken chilli.
The paper chicken was tasteless,they served chicken pakora,when I asked them about the dish ,they said it's their style.We can't think chilli Chicken without capsicum,they served the chilli chicken without the same.
Finally they are running the restaurant with one waiter .In short ,below average.

The food here is somewhat like real Chinese. So that originality brings the real chinese food taste in it. The ambience is not totally chinese. Maybe that can be made better. But overall the ambience and the service was good here.

With many so Chinese restaurants dotting all over the place, only a very few are able provide the Quality and experience of our beloved Tangra. This one of those few establishments that do exactly that. Providing Quality Chinese in Keshtopur at a price point very reasonable by Tangra standards, its quite a deal if your looking for good proper Chinese food in Keshtopur.

This review is based on a home delivery through Zomato, i did not visit the restaurant in person so I cannot comment about its interior nor can I comment on the service provided on-hand. We ordered dinner for two, steamed rice, American chopsuey, fish with assorted vegetables and chilli baby corn. It came just on time and the food was delicious. It was neatly packed, no spillage at all. The gravy was given separately so the noodles doesn't become soggy. However it's a bit expensive but worth it.

Golden gate may be a small and humble restaurant but the food is really good .This restaurant is in my locality and my family loves it. We always order the mixed gravy chowmein - it is packed with veggies, prawn, chicken and some munchy crispy noodles as well . One of the best gravy chow's we had. Their chilli chicken is okay but can be too spicy for taste. Another great dish is the prawn pepper salt- golden fried prawns with onion, pepper and ginger. Overall its a great place to order food for delivery. Ambience wise you wont get much but it is quite cheap and value for money.

The food is quite tasty.But the popularity of the taste should not be cashed in thus making the food overpriced.The location of the restaurant should also be kept in mind.Previously they used to charge all inclusive of service tax.No extra charges had to be paid by the customers.But after the onset of GST they started charging on the already tax included price of the items.THUS THEY ARE CHARGING BOTH SERVICE TAX PLUS GST UNLIKE OTHERS.Also the GST is charged over the overpriced packing charges.THIS IS NOT FAIR.

This is a local food joint for us with ordinary decoration but extraoridinary food qualiry. Have tried almost all items here. My personal favourite are chicken steamed momos, hot n sour soup, chicken hot pickel (those who dont like spicy plz avoid it), smokey fried rice, n ofcourse greavy noodles. There fish preparations are also v good. 
Mouth watering food at quite affordable price. Quantity is also enough. They also provide home delivery. But I have one concern that they do not give home deluvery during day time.

I would recommend this place to all.

Golden Gate....please keep up the good quality.

An average, regular restaurant. Located at Keshtopur, close to VIP road, the restaurant seats around 30 at a time. I was disappointed to have not got fried rice, although it was quite late at night, because in a Chinese restaurant, fried rice is the least you would expect to get. I had to order Chowmein, which was kind of okay. Lacked a bit of salt though. Didn't find too many chicken pieces in the dish, but the quantity of the chowmein was good to be honest. Pretty basic ambiance. Old fashioned table and chair arrangement, but I like the red shaded lights. The prices are reasonable. No extra taxes.

Was really disappointed with the bad quality yesterday. Some friends had brought chicken fried rice, shezwan chicken, chicken manchurian and sweet and sour chicken for a friend's birthday. The rice was tasteless with no seasonings at all. The manchurian was too dry and bland. Only the shezwan chicken was up to the mark. Didn't expect this from golden gate since I've visited this place a couple of times earlier and never had any complaints.@debrup bhattacharjya @procheto khan

This restaurant near VIP road Keshtopur is just 15 minutes away from my home. A small place with sitting arrangement of 25 people at on 1st floor of a building.
I ordered veg schezwan fried rice and chicken Hong Kong. The rice was hot and quantity was really good (for two). The chicken dish was quite impressive. There were big chunks of chicken cooked in soy sauce and with a lot of vegetables in it. I also felt that the ingredients used in it was of good quality. I liked the bit tangy taste of this chicken and it blended perfectly with the rice dish I ordered.
Service is good here. Food was delivered smoking hot, quickly after I ordered. And this restaurant is really pocket friendly and value for money. I would definitely recommend this place and also I am looking for more visit in future.

Amazing , I really like this place. It is very near to my home. Located in Kestopur Rabindrapally. Opposite to Ashirbaad Inn. 7 mins walking distance and to your Right handside direction , after you have started walking from VIP. Awesome food ! Very pocket friendly. I am almost a regular visitor to this place. ! :-D
The staffs are very decent behaved. The restaurant is clean, though a small one, but ambience is good. It looks like the eateries in Darjeeling. Not a hifi fancy restaurant. But you will definitely leave the place full, stuffed, satisfied and happy ! Me and my family have visited this place a number of times and have always thought to write good reviews. Food quality and quantity is nothing less than what you get in China Town, Tangra. I always jump into this place when I am hungry and leave satisfied, everytime !! I Definitely recommend this place to everyone. Unfortunately I did not click any pictures because when the food is served to me, I just plunge onto it, no wasting time for clicking ... LOL :-D

Honestly speaking as an avid consumer of Chinese foods, this place serves the most authentic Chinese food you can get for a low budget 
The staff is very friendly and it can take a while for the food to come but that just spikes up the anticipation

A nice place to enjoy Chinese food when your pockets are a bit light. A bit tricky to find if you don't know where to look for. It's on the first floor and the stairs are on side of the building........ Ordered chicken noodles soup, chicken fried rice and chicken manchurian.....service was on time and the food was delicious. Ambience is moderate at night time. The only drawback for me was that the place could have been cleaner

Don't know why this place isn't known to most foodies out there! The food is really great, pretty authentic when it comes to Chinese and the staff service is more than what you get elsewhere! Food quantity is enough for regular Bengali adults. Overall you'll get more than what you've paid for!

PS: the restaurant have shifted from its original position to a place much nearer to the kestopur bus stop!

4 gentlemen from Darjeeling started this resturant from a tiny 5'/5' space and kudos to them,their chivalry and skill, this resturant became one of the biggest resurant in kestopur area. If you are in love with pure taste and no gimmick...this place is surely for you. Trust me,it can compete with any posh chinese restaurants of Kolkata. My picks are : Mixed chowmin, garlic chiken and most mouthwateringly Chicken chowmin gravy. The price is very reasonable. In short : no gimmic,only food. Just wear a casual dress,pick your car key,come-sit-order,enjoy and leave this place with a smiling wallet in your pocket.
