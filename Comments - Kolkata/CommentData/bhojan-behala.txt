Really good place to rest your feet and have quality food after all that pandal hopping.Price is medium too.An AC eatery at this price range is quite good I@ must say.We had taken 2 plates of Veg Fried Rice and 1plate of Chilli Chicken and a plate of Chicken Crispy.The Chilli Chicken with 8pieces of chicken was not at all good but the crispy chicken recipe was just fabulous.The quantity is good enough with respect to the price and the service.Do not expect high end dining facilities however and you won't be disappointed.

Food was fine.The reason am rating them 3.5 was due to their very polite and homely manner..Had Chicken Bharta which was more Bangaliana than A regular Mughlai flavour.Food is reasonably priced.

Located at 14no. Bus stand. At a low cost we can get good food from here. Food quantity they serve is average.ordered moghlai paratha, chill chicken and lachcha paratha. Taste was not so good but manageable.

located near behala 14no bus stand.The ambience is just like a normal food shop, service is not that good. I occasionally order roti with chicken curry from this outlet.The chicken curry has that great homemade taste.apart from these i have ordered their crispy chicken,chicken chowmein,chicken mughlai paratha.all the items are good considering the price.

Bhojan is a new addition in swiggy lately in Behala region. Thought to give it a try. My idea was to have starters at first but my craving for fish made me order a pomfret dish and I repent my decision for that. I haven't had anything as awful as that. It was so bland and tasteless I couldn't have imagined. We did also ordered crispy chicken which was good, crispy spicy and tasty too. But the pomfret was a blunder. Skeptical about any further orders.

It is located just behind the cstc bus depot in behala 14 no. bus stand.Recently went there for a light meal. There were 4 of us and 2of us ordered chicken steamed momo(as pan fried momo was not available), and the 2 others ordered egg chicken roll and double egg roll (as mutton roll was also not available). The momos were not bad, but were quite small in size. They tasted well with the chutney and soup served with it. The rolls were also good, the best part was that they felt less oily. However, the food was served after 15 minutes, quite late considering the fact that the restaurant was quite empty and the food ordered was pretty common. Overall, u can give it a try.

Among the many other new food hubs in Behala this place is an addition which has opened recently. Even after residing in Behala it took me a long time to visit this place and I don't regret it at all. Located in Behala 14no. Bus Stand this place can be found with ease. A very small place with not much of decor, simple seating to have your food. I visited this place in the evening and went for some snacks. I ordered  momo , fish finger and fried chicken. I didnt like the momo at all, the stuffing was too less with a weird chatni. This was the first time a sweet tomato chatni was served along with momo. The fish finger was comparatively good and so was the chicken. Nothing much to expect from this place if you go. Though they claim to have a very good Bengali Cuisine, but still I dont have the guts to go back again.

A 2.5/5 is a lenient marking for the newbie in Behala.

I was very excited when Bhojan opened up near my place because they serve bengali food  and I have been there a number of times for a lunch comprising of daal, bhaat, fish or chicken.
On my first visit I had ordered rice, daal enchor chigri and parshe fish in red gravy. But they gave me a shorshe bata gravy instead due to a communication error but the fish was really good. The enchor chingri however had a very north indian taste, as in it was just prepared so there were a lot of fried onions in it and it felt like it had been cooked in a flash so the enchor and prawns were also pretty crispy.  it was a bit too oily for me, but taste wise it was still good. It wasnt what I was expecting though. The moshur daal could have been thicker. 
The pricing is really affordable though.

Location is good, exactly at 14 No. bus stand. Not the most ideal if you are looking for a private restaurant experience. Things are pretty basic here. I like the way they have decorated the small space. Infact I tried them few months back but could not pen the review as Zomato didn't have their page ready, hence I had to suggest this restaurant page.

I have tried Chinese from this place, that too take away. Not the best Chinese dishes available at Behala, is all I can say. The food was quite spicy. Prices are average, at par with other restaurants in the locality.

Tried the Bangali dishes oflate. Must say, value for money.

Review update: 27th July, 2017

All the Chinese side dishes are hugely overpriced. I ordered a Garlic Chicken which costed around 180, seemed atleast 50 bucks overpriced judging from the quality of the item and when compared to similar standard of restaurants in and around Behala. They should rework and reduce the rates of Chinese side dishes. Also the chicken pieces looked like just dipped in the gravy and not cooked in it.

The owners need to do something about the flies. It's unhygienic and irritating. For the last 3-4 times I have been to Bhojan, I have noticed the place is infested with flies.

Reducing my rating from 3.5 to 2.5.

Behala needs more restaurants/hotels like Bhojan! <3

on Sunday morning 27th march 2016 India vs Australia match day <3 ^______^ we decided to have some Bengali food!! being a Bengali it's so sad to tell that we hardly have Bengali foods outside other than home!! :((((( being middle class people we selected bhojan as you know how costly this Koshe Kosha Sholoana Bangali are..... ://////// so after all we decided to have our lunch from here :))))))))))) so my father went to bring food from here ^______________^ 

our menu
4 plain rice [regular] ( as mentioned in bill )
2 dal
2 alu fry
1 sukto
1 dhokar dalna
1 chicken curry (4pcs)
1 paneer butter masala (i ordered 1 chanar dalna but it was not available so ordered this) 

now lets start the review... 

rice - it was awesome!! i was actually shocked to see rs15 rice can be so much awesome! :O the rice had a smell of basmati rice :D ^_______^
dal - plain and good! :))
alu fry - awesome!!! perfect!! one plate is enough for two!!
sukto - didn't have but it was awesome as said.......
dhokar dalna - just awesome!! it was handmade dhokas i guess :)))))))))))))))
chicken curry - awesome!! :D loved the jhol pure Bangali ^_______^
paneer butter masala - awesome!! :D

all the items we had were awesome awesome and awesome! :D <3 ^_____^

another thing we loved that less use or you can say no use of red chili powder now a days it has become compulsory to add red chili powder in everything -_-

only con is that many items unavailability like on that day dahi echor , fulkopir dalna etc weren't available :(((((

my father said its an big ac restu/hotel having pictures n all and also very clean and hygienic :D ^____^

If you're looking for a quick and economic Bengali lunch on the go without the frills and you're in the Behala area, Bhojan is a good choice. It's relatively new and is located within the #14 bus terminus in Behala on the DH Rd. The restaurant is air conditioned and very clean with comfortable and spacious  seating.

They have a vegetarian thali with Bengali items and also a fairly wide of fishes aside from chicken and mutton dishes. 

You may also select a la carte from their menu if you don't fancy the "a little bit of everything" thali. 

I had tried their mughlai paratha one time and, from personal experience, I don't recommend it.

Its a newly opened restaurant in behala....the restaurant is neat and clean....bengali food is very cheap and quite tasty here...but they should improve the time management of their staffs bcoz i think they are very novice at this profession....although its good food joint for bengali authentic food lovers. :)
