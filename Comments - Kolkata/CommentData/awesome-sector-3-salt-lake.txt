I had a takeaway from this place . We ordered for a basic veg fried rice and devil's choice. The food is really awesome. It was a relish from the first mouthful till the last. I am hoping to order more from here in future.

A very new outlet situated just beside Sugar n Spice on the road opposite to Salt Lake stadium.We were nearby for some work on Saptami evening and decided to give it a try.This has a very space with around a seating capacity of 20 people.The interiors are very elegantly designed.
We ordered for chicken lung fung soup and chicken sweet corn soup and also some crispy chilli babycorn and also packed some chicken Lat me Kai.The quantity of every food was on the large side.The soups were perfectly made which very little seasoning but lots of goodies inside and the chilli sauce (I guess it is their self made version) complimented the soup soo well.The crispy chilli babycorn was perfect for me,the sauce was not sweet and the babycorn were super crispy.The Lat me Kai was not the version I had in other places.This was more like salt and pepper chicken and unfortunately the pieces were a little dry.
The staff was extremely courteous and very efficient in there work.
They do not take any taxes as of now and hence the pricing is quite reasonable.
I am looking forward to trying the other dishes from this place.
