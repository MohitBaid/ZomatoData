Located near andul road and andul station road crossing. Beside HP petrol pump.
With a small dinning area it has also a 1st floor section which is also small.
This little place have many items to satisfy your testes buds.
Food quality was quite average. I find nothing special about the items. But some items like barbeque fish might surprise you.
Stuff behavior was not friendly. There was no individual attention if you need to order or need some water you have to ask again and again.
Ambiance was also average. There was always some chatting among the stuff you can hear.
One thing I have to tell that this restaurant has the better quality food and ambiance to offer among the other restaurants in this area.
If you are in andul and get hungry then this place is the perfect place to eat and hangout.

A small and humble place with decent decor. The food is above average. They haven't installed card payment system, so it is a big turn off.
The quantity of food is nice. The Pomfret Tandoori had a large size of pomfret fish which is quite uncommon, so a big plus point. Chicken lollipop had a tangy and sweet taste and the meat could be felt in the mouth unlike other places where only the taste of batter is felt inside the mouth. Chicken Hyderabadi had a very nice taste. But the biryani was a disappointment. The rice grains were not long, the potato was burnt and the mutton piece had was a big bone. We could not even taste a bit of mutton. The service is slow, but the staff are courteous.

This restaurant is small yet offers delicacies of a wide range. One can try mughlai and Chinese dishes out here, and his tastebuds would not be able to differentiate it from any renowned restaurant in or around Kolkata. The one thing I like about their Biriyani is that it is not rich and oily and one can have a plate of it with ease. And I must say, they are punctual when it comes to delivery.

Went to this place yesterday night for a quick dinner. Interior was decent enough, you obviously can't expect luxurious interior here. Ordered Mixed Chowmein and Tung Fa Chicken. They were bit late in taking the order, but food was served fairly quickly. Mixed Chowmein was good enough for 2 people. It was loaded with eggs, prawn and chicken. Tung Fa Chicken tasted good too, it was topped with seasame seeds. Bill came around Rs 250. Overall a decent place for a quick bite.

Average in every aspect.... Food, decor, ambience, everything.... Had their Mixed Noodles and Dry Chilli Chicken.... Quantity was sufficient for two people but the quality was nothing special.... And yes, the price was very very cheap.... Highly recommended if you live in Andul-Mouri area....

Update
Visited this place at least 6-7 times since then, and I'm quite satisfied overall. There's no specific food that is out of the world,  but all the items are quite good. Yes, the service is very slow, they surely need to improve that. Other than that everything is satisfactory and the big plus point here is the price....

Well...well..well...Blue Heaven, this time..so here I go with my review, I had Fish Barbeque, Butter Naan, Chicken Red Qorma and Indian Chilly Chicken (Indian kick-twist in Chinese way). First of all taste and quality, it was above expectations, Fish Barbeque and Indian Chilly Chicken won my heart and wallet, I found it delicious. Service was good, the staff were polite. Price is reasonable. It has a lot of potential if customers give them a chance more and quite often. promising menu, smiley pocket pinch. People should try biryani over here, its less greasy and tastes good enough to compete. Overall experience Delightful...!!!!

this place is actually for couples. I tried the food once. I would say they dont know how to make veg biriyani. coz the biriyani did not had any spices and vegis. I felt like i bought some veg biriyani from train, which is just yellow rice, nothing else. the veg navratna was good but so less in quantity. the salada was like average home made salade, but the dressing is also average. The alu ka parathas were totally burned. The veg fried rice need more salt. overall it is not just an average place to visit. it is just a place for couples to have romance under blue light.
