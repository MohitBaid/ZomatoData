I had placed an order for Home Delivery from this outlet. It serves vegetarian only. So Non-Vegetarians stay away ! üòù

Food - Ordered Pan Fried Cheese Momos, Chocolate Sandwich, Mango Smoothie and Brownie with Hot Chocolate. 
üí• Pan Fried Cheese Momos - were superb. It was delivered hot. It was sufficient in quantity. The Cheese was also grated. And it tasted so good.

üí•Chocolate Sandwich - was good filled with chocolate. But the size was really small. This is the only item that I found was not reasonable.

üí•Mango Smoothie - was also good. 

üí•Brownie with Hot Chocolate - was superb. The brownie just melted in the mouth with the chocolate. It tasted so yumm. 

Service - It took a lil longer time to deliver. Although the food was great. They are of such reasonable prices.

So guys, Pan Fried Cheese Momo is a must try from here. I am sure you would love it. üòç

This place really makes good decent food and at unbelievably cheap prices. Have been here a couple of times the food was always good and fresh would have been an absolute gem if it also started serving non-vegetarian dishes. But that's not a complaint this place is good and hygiene really happy with the food served over here. 
One suggestion it the just melt the cheese after garnishing it over any dish then it would be making it even more yummier .

Small joint.
Clean.
Serves only "VEG".
Usually thronged by students, friend groups & young couples.
Service is good & fast.
Well, talking about the food, I wanna say that I tried 3 different sandwiches but unfortunately all of them tasted the same to me.
Pocket friendly.
Definitely needs to work on the food taste.
Overall experience : AVERAGE !!!

A college-goers' paradise! I don't go here often but order food extensively to satisfy my sudden snacking needs! They serve fresh stuff and are generous with their mayo, cheese, chocolate sauce, ketchup and all other good things! You can buy a small sized meal at around 100 bucks! Service and packaging is neat too!

Well I've never visited this place..  So this rating is solely based on food..Just ordered snacks one evening to be delivered to Medical College while on duty.. The cheese Maggi was tasty with generous dollop of cheese..  The corn cheese sandwich too was good with decent amount of filling..  Cold coffee was unexpectedly great.  Price is cheap.  
Keep up the good work.!!
