The food items served here are tasteless. Once I ordered boneless chilli chicken and I got bones in chicken. Fried rice and mutton kosha too doesn't have a taste. Most of the dishes I've tried here have bland taste.

Located at the entrance to Dunlop super market. Been there at night, almost before the closing hour. Had ordered moghlai paratha.... It was good but not outstanding... Seating arrangement was so so.... Interior is too clumsy and not evenly lit..  their pricing is reasonable but food quality could be improved along with the interiors... 

Summing-up everything... It is a very low graded restaurant... And would recommend it to others as there last retort and if they r too short on their budget....

I am a resident of Dunlop. and this place is very well known to me. But nothing special or casual in here. No decorations. 
Time consuming and you'll end up eating not worthy food ðŸ˜‘  street food are far better than this. Better not to think of coming here. Trust me.

This place is situated at the entrance of the dunlop market. Dark and really boring and not so clean interiors. Never sat there for a meal. Only order takeaways. They have roll counter along with all that is on the menu  card. The rolls are average and pricing is ok. The chowmien is tasty if you can overlook the fact that it is quite oily. Not a very popular place in the area.

A sober joint for evenings snacks with rolls, noodles and fries. Have not improved their menu as well as their ambience in the last 10-15 years. Very oily food and not of optimum quality. Most of the times remain empty even in the peak market hours. Definitely not a prefereble in this area.

Situated at Dunlop crossing. Average quality of food (specially when name is related to coffee house, expected better). You can visit this place once but not worthy for regular visit as there are more better restaurants nearby.

This place is located at Dunlop super market.

Quite spacious.

Ambience sucks.

Average service.

Tried Mixed Chowmein & Chilli Chicken, food quality was average.

Pocket pinch is ok.

Would never try again.

I have been there in 2011 to have some evening snacks and coffee of course. Well I didn't feel much enthusiastic in visiting this place twice because of its food quality and price accordingly. Food was average but price was not that much worthy. Well If you wanna spend some time in Dunlop then you can visit here.

Dunlop Coffee House is located near to Dunlop main crossing in the market area. There's so many restaurants available in this area including street foods, where this one is just located in the corner what makes it easy to locate.

The restaurant is quite big, dine is on the 1st floor. Dine is kind of old fashioned but enough spacy. Somehow clean & manageable. Simple eye catching lights & fancy decorations are there. We ordered the followed dishes just for evening snacks & faced a long delay in their service. But I noticed their old waiters were quite responsive.

Chicken Cutlet : Cutlet was quite big & was served with mustard sauce. It was nicely fried but not very oily. Inside there was very less chicken & the taste of it was compleatly missing. Just the high spicy & onion taste was there. Mustard sauce tasted kind of sweet & very unlikely with the cutlet. It was priced only Rs. 50 at the time of review, still that wasn't worth it.

Coffee : How I wouldn't have ordered coffee over here, afterall its coffee house. Coffee was provided in small old style cup. I couldn't felt any fravour and it was so disappointing & bitter in taste that compleatly runed the coffee experience.

If you're tight on budget, look nearby & you will find a good place. Overall experience wasn't very good over here & not at all recommend from my side.

In no ways it is a coffee shop. It is famous among the younger group because of all dirty reasons. Only thing edible here are the rolls and Afgani cutlet.

The owner is very rude and he will never have a change for 100/500.Â

If you're around Dunlop and are starving , then too , opt for this restaurant only and only when you are left with no other choice. 
The food quality is bad and the ambience is not good.

Just at the Dunlop more... Very old restaurant there.
I often go there with my friends... good ambience for a coffee shop.. big space just lacks lighting and atmosphere,u always find it epmty. It has got cabins also for lovers who want privacy.. Cant find a waiter there???
and about the food and stuffs. snacks items are  good. Coffee is also good but below average. Had Chicken Soup which was very good. Didn't had any food there yet so cant review about it. Overall recommended for friends to go.

**Location = Just at the Dunlop More. A nice location I would say.

**Brief = Baranagar area lacks in genuine Coffee Shops, though the name says its Coffee House, it is not a CH at all.
More of a roadside food joint with a extra space to accomodate around 10-15 people. They serve rolls and biriyanis during the evening as well.

**Things ordered = I have visited this place since my school days. The condition has deteriorated. The ambience is really bad. With unfriendly waiters, who are really snail paced.
I ordered chowmien and chilly fish, both of them were ridiculous and not worth eating.
Never try their coffee or cold coffee, they are just worthless.

**Items Recommended = None.

**Purse Check = Pretty high with such quality of food.

**Overall = I usually never give such low ratings. They must try to improve fast and bring on some changes to attract the customers. :)

Not a really exciting place and get in there only if you happen to be too hungry and don't find anything better open around the area.
Food quality has lot of scopes to improve and so with the hygiene of the place. Ambiance was not so great and in fact depressing and the service is also not that great but better than the food they serve :P
Being one of the oldest food joints in the area it is expected to maintain its quality but guess they don't bother about it.

located at the lane towards sonali cinema at dunlop..it is one of the old restaurants here..but with time its quality of food and standard has degraded a lot..
recently went there with Ak..we ordered for chicken and egg chowmein ..one roll and cold coffees ..chowmein was very bad..though the roll was ok one..the cold coffees were made of water or milk was not recognizable .as in this heat it was cold so we somehow had it....we never expected it to have deteriorated this much..
the ambience is not that good..and the servers are very slow..and the worst part is that this food does not go with the price..it is quite price taxing as compared to the food which i didnt like..hence i dont think i will be visiting here in near future!

If you are hungry and want a quick bite or have a cup of coffee, its better to avoid this place and have noodles or egg role from any street side vendor outside. The floor had water spilled all over. No one to clean it. The table had not been cleaned after the last customer left. The chair had stains of chowmein from the previous customer. The condition of the restaurant is pathetic.
