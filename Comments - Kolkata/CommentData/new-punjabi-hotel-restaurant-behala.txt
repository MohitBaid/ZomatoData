Went there a couple of weeks age with my mother. Located near behala 14 no bus stand, it is the place where you can go for a quick bite and a full course meal at reasonable rates. We ordered butter tandoori roti and chicken bharta. Both were well cooked and the salads were fresh as well. Looking forward to more visits.

The prices are very low. It lacks in cleanliness and even there is not a proper decor. Ordinary tables and chairs with old tube lights. Service is very poor . The waiters are dressed in *sando genji and lungi*. Food quality was okayish, only food which I found quite good was chicken bharta.

Last sat ordered food from this royal punjabi Restaurant. Food was pathetic, cooking was terrible & taste was just "joghonno"...... guyz if u have lots of money to waste then visit this punjabi Restaurant. Food quality is worst than road side bhat daal er dokan. Just a bullshit n joghonno Restaurant.

The resturant is easy to locate nearby tram depot market in behala.
The ambience is okay but the chair and table can be replaced by new for comfortable seating that was the thing which heavily disappointed me but the food was excellent and flavour enriched.
I ordered tadka daal and paneer butter masala with tandoori roti and plain rice,the taste was good and I really enjoyed it espically the tadka daal which had a punch of little mirch which tasted excellent.
My experience was good with the food not with the ambience.

Ordered via swiggy from this restaurant and I was heavily disappointed. One of my worst food experiences so far. Ordered mutton biryani and mutton keema mattar. The entire thing was stale and had to be thrown out so am not even going into how it tastes because I could not taste it at all. My entire money was wasted. Would not recommend this to anyone.

today for lunch had 1 Boneless Chicken Bharta (8 Pcs) & Mixed Fried Rice (Contains egg, chicken, mutton & prawns.) through swiggy!

starting off with Mixed Fried Rice it was good!! it really contained egg, chicken, mutton & prawns :D normally you get egg, chicken & prawns but here you get mutton :D :D lastly the Boneless Chicken Bharta (8 Pcs) dunno why it's called 8pcs :/ it was bad!!! it did not have any taste it was pure bland! and on top of that there was no salt!!!!

Lip smacking Punjabi food with the good ol Dhaba feel. The food is piping hot and decently priced. Take away or just sit down the classical way. Onions & chillies on the house. Dal fry (tadka), chicken masala must haves here.

Well this was famous when there were little options to dine out. But they make some good quality tarka in behala which are reasonably priced.  nothing fancy about the place.  okay for some quick bite at a very low price.

Ordered food via Swiggy today. The chicken tikka butter masala had 6 soft, succulent, and big pieces of chicken in a nut rich gravy. Priced at Rs 160, I think this is a steal. Rating the place highly just because of this dish. 

The egg tadka lacked salt and was overall a little bland. Nothing great to write home about. Definitely going to order the chicken again

I have had food from here since time immemorial. 20years back there were very options to dine and this was one of them. The food quality here has declined a lot but still I like coming here for old times sake. The interior has nothing to be mentioned about, nothing fancy just some tables and chairs. I did a takeaway today of tandori roti and chicken korma. The chicken was pretty average and for me it needed a bit nore salt.

Dude, u cant call yourself a punjabi restaurant if you cant make decent aloo paratha and gobhi paratha.
Horrendous! 
The dough was some inedible combination of maida and atta and god knows what... the oil to fry it, was also some smelly substance. Still cant understand what that was. And the stuffing, i dont know what it was in the gobhi paratha.... some old cooked sabzi.... arghhhh....
Butter naan... so thick n doughy.... 
N palak paneer... palak not ground properly... stems of palak in all the bites!
Every restaurant has atleast one redeeming quality... but i am sorry to say, this one had none!

This place has been always a good option whenever I want to have some Indian food keeping my pocket in relief. The place is situated in Diamond Harbour Road and can be easily found. This place is not good for dine in but you can always take away the food. It has been several occasions when I take away from here. The packaging has always been good. If you want to eat in the restaurant, firstly you wont get an AC and its not that comfy. So take away is better option. Another thing which I want to mention is that the staffs here are really good and well behaved. 

Food:
Few dishes are quite good and few dishes are not. Its better to take Indian Dishes rather than taking Chinese. Few items which i generally order are:
#Egg Tadka
#Chicken Bharta
#Chicken Do Pyaza
#Dal Makhani
#Butter Paneer
#Lassi

Last words:
Cheap and filling. Wanna fill your stomach spending less bucks. Here is your destination.

3/5

The place which serves the best tarka in behala region. I didn't had too many items from this restaurant but yeah did ordered their famous egg tarka numerous times. Once ordered chicken kasha,it was a horrible experience. Their romali roti and tandoori Roti's are quite cheap and good as well.

I am a big fan of "Golbari-r Kasha Mangso"(Mutton kasha of Golbari) and I try to have a stop there whenever I pass near by Shyambazar Five Point crossing. It's an old food joint of North Kolkata that still preserves it's reputation and taste and almost became a legend. Don't expect a big and fancy ambiance or mannered service...just sit, order and eat or u may take away too. Try the "Kasha Mangso" with Paratha or Rotis...I am sure u will remember the taste for a long time.
