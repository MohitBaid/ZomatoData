Simply one word -awesome. Big thanks to Bhavna.
I(in mumbai)was searching for a red velvet birthday cake for my fianc√©e(in kolkata). And we were bored of monginis/french loaf/ flurry's. More over I planned it to be a surprise,so obviously was looking for delivery option too. From zomato I came to know about Chocolatier.
With Bhavna , I chatted nd called couple of times to explain her about my expectations (most importantly the creame should be soft as they prepare only eggless, timely delivery and a lovely romantic box homemade/handmade chocolates).
She was very helpful and understanding and designed this entire package perfectly.
Payment options were very flexible.
Finally, it was delivered perfectly on time,taste was awesome(although i was unable to). Nice packaging.

Thanks to The Chocolatier again for making her birthday so special.

I had ordered a speedometer cake for my hubby, it was a Fondent cake. The chocolate truffle was really awesome and as expected. The design was put in a really nice way but could have been given a little more perfection. But the taste compensated the perfection. Please put a little more effort towards the designing too.

Had a really bad experience. It was my husband's birthday and I wanted to surprise him with a cake. The cake she made was very ugly. I wanted a girl and boy sitting beside each other holding a hookah on a bed or type of hookah lounge. But she made the girl very ugly by making her fat. She told me they will be sitting on a carpet back to back but what I got was completely different. The finishing was horrible. My husband became so upset that I decided to return the cake bit since we didn't have that much of time to spend, we simply discarded the cake.

For any food item, I think two things are very important : 1)quality 2)service
And they are the perfectionist with respect to these two parameters. Above that, the customized designs over the cakes, the sweet little cup cakes and the warm gesture is what I loved the most. Do try once!

In one simple word the taste here is splendid. Ever since i tried cup cakes here , cant resist myself from craving for even more. Once i got a chance to order a cake for my sister for her first homecoming after her wedding. what i got was a superb barbie doll which actually reflected my sister and taste was speechless everyone liked it. The best part here at The chocolatier is that u get very prompt service and a perfect customization of your cake which fits perfect to your occasion.
Kudos to the team as you already made a remarkable entry in this field hope you guys reach to the apex of it.
And once again thanx for making our occasion a perfect one.

The most fantastic chocolates and cakes ever, ever! My cousins got my birthday prank cake made via Bhavna (owner). It was a barbie doll cake. I could not control my laughter. But beyond the looks, when I bit into a piece of the cake I could not resist it for much long. It flew of the box in seconds. :D
