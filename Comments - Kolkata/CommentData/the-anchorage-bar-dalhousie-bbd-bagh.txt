Super costly place as per the quantity I must say. Plus point is the location. . Undoubtedly one of the best place I have been to.  Prawns chilly was good and so were extra friendly staff. .

The weight of the name of this place is mightier than the food or service (kinda hoped it to be the other way around). Food is nothing to gloat about except for the Smoked Chicken Tart which is out of this world and the only 'chef's recommended' dish that I will ever have in any restaurant. Although a very costly affair, you will love the view which is incredible, maybe for the fact that it's below the ship and you see the Ganges hitting against the glass walls.

This place symbolises Kolkata. Its stuck in the past while competition has moved on but has an ego which makes it morbidly resistant to change. Go for the view from the deck and NOTHING else. Strictly for one-time visit only.

It's one of its kind... Should be experienced ones... Coolest place for destination wedding within in the destination.... The food was is subtle and excites your taste buds. Mesmerizing experience

Don't bother about food or service,  just go for the view.  The food is not bad, but terrible... Never ever coming back here... The buffet is perhaps the worse in Kolkata

We visited Floatel on last day of durga pooja ( visarjan ). We have heard abt this hotel and its view since long back . Here are few things I would like to share:-
1. FOOD : Food options were very very less.Only 2 paged menu card they have provided in which veg and non veg dishes were not seperated and also not marked with red or green signs. We have ordered dal makhni and 1 paneer dish. Both dishes were too sweet to eat. Thats why food experience was very bad.
2. VIEW : As far as view from Floatel is concerned, 
deck view is very nice. As we went in the month of october the atmosphere was highly humid so we prefered to seat inside. There is no provision of sitting close to deck in AC.
3. Service: I can say the service was not up to the mark in comparison with other equally expensive restaurents. Staff behaviour was not professional.
We complained about our experience to one of the senior staff, he apologised and said because of pooja time, we have limited menu.
People like us come to kolkata for pooja. From restaurents like Floatel which one of the leading name in hospitality industry this is not expected.
