This place has been my favourite for a long time and now they have started delivering in my location too. They make the best momos around Agarpara and Sodepur area. You got to try them out. The Pan Fried Momo is a bit too spicy for me but the Steamed and Fried Momos are plain awesome. Their food variety is limited but I guess that makes their quality better. Who needs a wider variety? We order the same stuff anyway and in that collection Momo Junction has enough on ther menu. 

Delivery was made within 35 mins of order! That was the cherry on top!

Ambiance isnt good. 
Pocket pinch is economical
Steamed momos are nice served with a very tasty clear soup
Noodles are also good.
Worth trying.

I don't think the momos which they serve are any good. Just a basic stuffing of boiled chicken and oninos, who loves just these for price of 60 rs !
Let alone, there are no other options than chicken momos
Only steamed, fried or pan fried with the same basic boiled stuffing
I seriously think they should educate their chef to make decent momos.
If the name of your shop is "MOMO" junction, the least you can do is make good "MOMO"s !

This place is great of you want to have great momo and chinese food. They have limited number of seats, so sometimes you might have to wait if there is a rush. The steamed momo comes witha tasty free soup but everyone's favourite is the sauce sauted momos.the mixed hakka noodles is great too. If you are a resident of sodepur this eatery is worth a visit.

Being from Kolkata, I am always a crazy street food lover, and I believe you will find a variety of items, which will come with an unforgettable taste for life time. Recently I visited the place called Momo Junction in Sodepur,  as it is very near to my home. I tried the chicken momos, and believe, they were amazing. The. Chicken soup accompanied with those Momo, made it much tastier and likeable.The chicken stuffing, will give you an unique cozy taste, for which I really liked the momos. But the shop is very small and has limited sitting capacity, so the ambience of the shop was not upto mark, and they have very few staff to, though the momos were tasty, but for ambience and managment I would rate it as 3.5. But if you don't care about ambience, and momos is what matters to you, give a try, and i believe, you will like it.☺️
