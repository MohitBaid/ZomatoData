Dnt get surprised when you will get a totally different menu  on the resturant. We went there for chicken salad but got completely different menu and ordered  a chili garlic noodles and spicy pasta.. food taste was good. Quantity was average for two.

Cafe mezzaluna is a cafe snugging in the lanes of Maddox Square in Kolkata. The cafe is well maintained, and has 4 various seating options available. The place definitely is well maintained, and the staff is really courteous. I went there a couple of days ago with my friends. We tried the mix sauce spaghetti, as penne was out of stock at that time, however, the spaghetti wasn't liked by us. Further we tried a mocktail and a KitKat shake and an Oreo shake all 3 of which tasted amazing. However the crispy chilli babycorn again didn't match upto the expectations, and the quantity seemed quite less.

Located just opposite to Maddox Square this cafe has got 4 sections(one exclusively for hookah smokers)Well decorated, will give you a feel of posh cafe. Lighting and decor is really nice with comfy large sofas. Staffs are really nice.
Food is good. 
And they make excellent mocktails.
And the main usp is u can sit here as long as you like without anyone poking you to leave or disturbing your privacy.
I guess it's going to be one of the best cafes in town.

a lovely cool place to catch up with buddies for a hookah. located just opposite to Maddox square it is a cool place, the things which makes it cool is the offer it gives in little app, download little app, then go to cafe mezuluna then go for the offers, buy the offers, and redeem the offers at the cafe, it is really cool and budget friendly, the staffs are good, with excellent music, and seating arrangement, it is my regular must to visits during weekends.

Today was my first time at this place, and I loved it! We ordered a Schezuan chicken noodles, Salt and pepper chicken, mixed sauce pasta and fresh lime sodas. The food was pretty good.
This place also offers reasonably priced hookah. We opted for a mix of spring water and kiwi, which was great! :) The ambience and decor were impressive as well. The cherry on the cake was they served with ice cream which was complementary! üòçüòçüòç

Just visited the place with my girls. Located near maddox square. Awesome decor. The music and the tv screen was most imperfectly synced. The service was slow. But the food was marvellous. The schezwan hakka noodles won our taste buds. The mix sauce spaghetti and chicken salt pepper were good too. The Spring Water and Kiwi mixed base hookah was a perfect combo. 

PS. I rated it 5 stars since the bill came with three scoopes of ice cream with my favourite black current sauce which was on the house!

Okay i am a bit late in giving the review! Situated just beside the madox square, Cafe Mezzaluna is one of those places with very good ambience and food. The decor is classy and comfortable. The staffs were cordial as well. Me and my friend  ordered one grilled chicken sandwich and one sheekh kebab . The sheekh kebab was undoubtedly mouth watering and the sandwich was also good. Morever a very  nice place to hangout with friends over hookah and food. Prices are affordable. Would surely love to visit this cafe once again!

Awesome place. This place is must visit for foodies as the food served here are just a bliss. Beside food they also serve hookah and it is also awesome.
I have tried the pene pasta and it was fantastic. It is highly recommended that if you are visiting this place you should try that. The potato skin was Average as I think the ingredients were added a bit extra to what should have ideally been added, so it should be rectified. Oreo shake is just Wow.. loved every sip of it. Over-all it's a fantastic place to hangout with friends and you will definately enjoy visiting this place as the staffs are also very friendly and helpful. :)
Will come back soon. 
Thankyou for the wow factor.

They had a discount going on in Swiggy and I ordered the Harissa Chicken with grilled vegetables and mashed potato. The food came in different containers, packed quite effectively. Now normally, I have a big appetite but even then I found it difficult to finish their portions. In the end, I had to waste a lot of vegetables and potato. The sauce had a distinct taste of pickle which was too strong for my taste. But the grill was perfect and the chicken succulent and delicious.

Looking forward to visiting this place. Bill was 270/- after the discount

Went there on Valentine's day with my love though previously also we went there! We had a nearbuy coupon. The People over there were very friendly. They redeemed it quickly. We had one devilled chicken pizza with mashroom,potato skin,one KitKat shake and a San Francisco mocktail. Food was really delicious. The ambience of the restaurant was @really good. So for that I would like to give them 4.5 out of 5.

Have been here twice. Its adjacent to maddox square and easy to locate. The staffs are well behaved. Cosy and good ambience. Now coming to food, honey chilly chicken wings and Mexican pizza are must try. Virgin mojito is also good. We visited here during puja and they served hard drinks at cheap prices. Mezzuluna special hookah is quite refreshing.

Location : Opposite Maddox Square Park.  
Place/ Ambiance : The place is considerably big and has a decent Ambiance.  
Food : The food quality is inviting and juicy and quatity is good,  yet keeping side by side to the price is somewhere not fitting.  
Hookah in this place is different and has alott of amazing combinations of there own.  
Overall the place is can be visit for all.

Second left from The Firefly, Sarat Bose Road.
The place might not look so pleasing to the eyes as you step in but you've to be here for the amazing food and courteous staff; special mention Mr. Faiyaz. A simple and quiet place to have great time with your buddies. 
In Love with the chilly garlic noodles and four topping pizza. Don't miss out on their special garlic chutney.

Been here with some friends during puja.The place was cosy but the staff behaviour was bit different.They were playing music really loud and when we requested to keep the volume bit low,they refused.Our table was just beside the speaker and the sound was hurting our ears.Apart from this food and hookah was ok.

Cafe mezzaluna is this newly opened place right in next to Maddox square back gate. The outer appearance might not be very impressive but once you step in you are welcomed by humble staffs ready to help you with anything you need. We ordered for lime grass monitor, peach and orange cooler , fish finger with french fries and tartar sauce and crispy chicken with spring onion. Food was really tasty. But what I felt was they limited option of food to choose from. The y serve sisha as well. 
Pocket pinch:700-800for two

The cafe is not a standard cafe, everything feels crammed up, the ambiance isn't upto a normal standard cafe feels like a living home has been converted to a cafe, the light are bright should have been a little dim and the music is loud, though the food is pretty decent!

Pre-Inaugural Food Bloggers Meet at Cafe Mezzaluna..!

                A new Caf√© in town, Caf√© Mezzaluna enters into the array of the food scene of Kolkata, with its first and foremost outlet located very close to Maddox Square. For an area, which boasts of some fine caf√©, finding an area close to Maddox Square, is a winner by itself. With comfortable sitting sofas, the eye-soothing lights, minimal yet classy decorations,¬† Caf√© Mezzaluna is going to be the next big thing. Hookah is already being served here, and once they acquire the bar license, this place is surely going to receive all the buzzes. Team #panchphoron was invited over here for a pre-inaugural food tasting session, and following were the dishes and drinks, which were served to us.

‚ÄãA new cafe makes its way into the city of joy ! Located conveniently near Maddox square, this cafe has already gained much popularity before it‚Äôs launch. Named as Cafe Mezzaluna, the beautifully decorated red coloured exterior is bound to ¬†gain your attention. The menu has been beautifully designed with dishes ranging from Western to Oriental. Apart from that, this place serves some amazing hookah along with cocktails ! Yes, you get it right. They have a bar too and this is probably going to be the best bar cum cafe in the whole Hazra area, in the coming days.

Just beside Maddox Square, this place is still under construction but anyway,they accommodated us. We were a group of 6 and had a gala time relaxing on the sofa and enjoying great food, nice cold coffee and mocktail and sheesha. We mainly had starters which included fish fingers, pepper chicken satay and a prawn dish, each with distinctly different sauces that complemented the dish. The iced cappuccino was average though. The thin crust roasted chicken pizza with black olives and caramelized onion was the star of the evening and I hope to be back there soon to try other dishes as well. The staff was courteous and they gladly arranged for a candle for the b'day cake that was taken there to celebrate a colleague's b'day. Overall an above average experience.
