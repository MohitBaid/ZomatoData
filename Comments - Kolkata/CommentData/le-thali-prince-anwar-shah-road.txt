Ordered online from this food joint. We ordered two tawa tandoor laccha paratha and two butter nun with chicken bharta.    
Nun and paratha were very soft..but a little bit small in size. Chicken bharta was too tasty!  It was served with an fried egg! 
Overall nyc good food , good quantity, pocket friendly cost!

I ordered chicken biriyani combo with self chosen chicken side dish through swiggy. The delivery was prompt and the packaging was well done.
Now coming to the food a mineral water bottle was there along with raita, and honestly the quantity was really good. With delivery charge it came upto 255 rupees and I got a good tasty chicken egg biriyani along with 3 pieces of chicken tikka masala. The food was very tasty and cooked to perfection.
It was my first order and honestly I am really satisfied, good job people and will order more in future.

First things first. This is the second time I have ordered 2 assorted kebab thalis from this joint via swiggy (since zomato does not deliver to my address). The kebabs are excellent, so soft, juicy and of good size. The naan is also so soft. You could literally cut the chicken with a spoon, even when the food has turned cold.100% marks for quality and the packing too.
The only reason I rated this restaurant 1 is the size of the naan. When I ordered for the first time, I saw that it had written 'baby naan' in the description. Upon receiving, I saw that the size was bigger than what a baby naan actually is. I was really impressed and each thali had 4 naan. 8 naan were actually more than sufficient for 4 people.
Today, anticipating the same size, I opened the pack for serving. To my utter disappointment, this time the naan was really small. I had guests at my home and it was really difficult for me to provide them with sufficient naan. I have no problems with the baby naan being baby, the only problem I have is that they should stick to the same size. Had they served this size earlier, I would have made arrangements accordingly.

I ordered a mini mutton thali from Swiggy. And you won't believe that the food was so stale that it appeared that it had been digged out of some prehistoric caves of the sites of Harappa or Mahenjodaro

Ordered one mini veg thali and a mini mutton thali. The food was awesome both in quality and quantity. Specially I am in love with the gulab jamun in the thali. If Folks at Le Thali are reading this , I want to buy those gulab jamuns, they are the best.

I was so impressed by the food from this place that I placed an order for the same thali just a few days later after my first order. While browsing through Swiggy I came across this outlet, what attracted me the most was the kind of option you get to choose. The packaging was done properly I had ordered for a Veg Thali and both the quality and the quantity of the food was remarkable. Thali comes with 500ml water bottle and they had also packed a small amount of sugar coated mouth fresh freshener. Definitely trying other non veg option pretty soon.

today ordered via swiggy. tried kebab thali and oriental non veg thali. kebab thali is good and light on pocket. oriental thali is also good but the chilli chicken needs improvement. seems they used breast pieces in chilly chicken which were hard. hope will have will more tasty dishes from them in future.

Very horrible service! Ordered a Chinese thali.. the noodles were burnt and therefore to hide the same they poured some Manchurian sauce above it..the food altogether tasted horrible and my brother got food poisoning.

An unique variety of thalis in this place. Came across this place while looking for food options on swiggy. A range of thalis perfect for office parties, conferences or home events. I had the kebab thali which had tandoori murgh 2 full pieces, hariyali Tikka kebab 4 pieces, reshmi kebab 4 pieces along with 4 baby naans and a bottle of packaged water. Delicious tender succunlent kebabs and tandoori. The entire thali is more than enough for 1. Can easily be shared between 2 people. Great innovative idea. Keep up the good work

I did not order but had the food at a friend's place. Also heard about the concept. Such awesome food engineering can happen only from someone with a passion towards food. Enjoyed every bite of the kebabs as well as the mashed potatoes along with Jeera rice n Grilled Chicken. Really felt you all should be given a moral boost. Was just curious...do you people deliver in New Alipore?
