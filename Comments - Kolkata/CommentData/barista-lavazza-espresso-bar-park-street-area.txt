Today I had a horrible experience. It was 31st December evening, so there was a bit rush. At the counter I ordered a cafe americano large (around 140 bucks). Of course, they were trying to convince me for all the add-ons and I denied. The counter guy then asked whether I want my coffee normal or bit strong, and I said strong. Immediately the guy added one espresso to my coffee and charged around 100 more. I thought ordering strong coffee is always free of charge (at least it is in most coffee joints I believe). This was a total rip-off. Anyhow I realised that there is no point arguing with the guy and paid full 240 (approximately). The coffee came in a small cup (may be that's the large portion, which I doubt). 

While drinking the coffee, the servers came twice to me and asked whether they can take my cup (while I was not finished). And I denied. Three of the servers were standing around me and making me feel uncomfortable. Finally third time when one server came, I took the last sip and handed the cup over. Then I was with my mobile while another guy (probably manager) came and said I have to order or leave. I said that I will order in some moment (and also a friend of mine will join) because I just finished one coffee. The guy was extremely rude and asked me to leave or sit on a sofa near the cake shelves, which was an uncomfortable place to sit. And I left the place immediately.

This was so unprofessional and of course an unpleasant experience. I will not go the place anymore. They became only money-minded rather than giving a nice service. 

I recommend everyone to give a second thought before visiting the place; I believe there are much much better coffee joints.

Cosy, comfortable, my go to place.
With close down of Au Bon Pain this is my destination for sudden meetings and hookups over coffee. Bean bags are just love here. Brownie with chocolate sauce is a must try . All the pastries are equally delectable.

I would say the best coffee shop in Kolkata. I had been visiting Barista for a long time, sometimes with friends as well as family. The food there is very nice. On quiet days I spent hours there over a cup of Cappuccino or maybe a latte. The coffee is just amazing! I also tried the desserts there, specially the brownies. They are an absolute bliss. Wonderful place, wonderful people and awesome coffee. That’s how a cafe should be. A must visit for everyone who likes their coffee a little strong.

Good location, not too much rush, cool music, overall good, as usual....
This time we ordered for barista frappé, sheek kebab wrap and mojito... Food and drinks are average in taste... Can't compare the frappé with the one from Starbucks... Staff behaviour is good...
Overall average rating...

I had a horrible experience yesterday at the Park Street outlet of Barista. 3 of us was there for a meeting and ordered 2 cappuccino and a bottle of water. The place had enough vacant tables.

1st server came and asked for if we need anything else and we denied.
2nd server came after sometime and almost forcing us to place order. As we are still enjoing our coffee and water; we denied again. However he was adament, hence I ordered for another bottle of water and called for the manager.

The manger came and he was furious at us. Almost asking us to leave and still the place was half empty. Very rude, unprofessional, unethical and aggressive behaviour. And I was very surprised to be at the receiving end. And there was a lady with us.

We settled the bills immidietly and left.

I can understand that you guys are trying to push the sales, however if you behave like this; actually you're pushing the customer out of your place.

As a company are you stressing people so much that they are almost about to fight?
WELL, IN THAT CASE, IT'S REMARKABLE.

Oh almost forgot, before putting my review on this forum, I was going through your philosophy. It's interesting! !!!

Do you really follow ???

At Barista Coffee, we do all we can to make every guest feel comfortable and welcome. We have friendly and efficient brew masters who believe in service with a smile. And provide a cheerful, interactive ambience that makes guests wish their coffee breaks lasted just a little bit longer.

The ambiance of this place is great, really loved it.
There are books you can read, work on your laptop or have a gala time with your peeps.
There is a private area where you can practice your gigs as well.
Had hot chocolate, latte, and grilled chicken sandwich with peri peri chips.
The latte was perfect (10/10).
The hot chocolate and the sandwich were average.
Only thing is I felt it was a bit over priced cause 800 bucks for a sandwich and two cups of beverage is too much.
If the price was a bit less it would have been a perfect spot for hangout after school or college.

We liked the ambience as it was too calm and quiet. The coffee is mouth watering though price is a bit on the higher side. The location is another big bonus for this place.

One of my favorite cafés of the city that I had been visiting a long time back. Perfect ambiance to spend lazy afternoons with friends gorging over a cuppa. Had their café latte and iced mocha coffee. Both of them were good. I have visited their New Market outlet too but still this Park Street outlet is my favorite. Pocket pinch is medium. Service is great. Elegant atmosphere. What else you need in a café?

Simplicity clubbed with elegance at its best. A quintessential cafe to sip coffee and be engrossed with your favourite book or with the company of conversation. The simply amazing music in in the background is neither too loud nor too soft The staff is just fine. The beverages are good. I wished there were more to munch upon. If only the service could be a bit swifter. Else a good place to be. My personal favourite are Darjeeling green tea with tulsi flavour and roasted hazelnut latte.

As most coffee places, it is a deeper pinch in your pocket.

We had the Caramel Cappuccino which was just amazing.
The Green Apple Lemonade, however, tastes a bit funny. Not sure whether many will like it.
The drinks were accompanied by Smoked Chicken Sandwiches which were totally delectable.

Will probably drop in again on another lazy afternoon.

I last visited Barista of Park Street somewhere at the end of 2014 till the middle of 2015 and I can say that barista has changed quite a lot. They added a shelf to display cups and mugs for your daily dose of caffiene. Not only that, they added a separate long table just for students who wants to study or do something on their laptop. I think this is pretty innovative, something that you don't see often in any cafe in kolkata. Coming to what we ordered, we didn't order for any meal or dessert as we had our dinner somewhere else. We only came here for drinks but I am sure the good here is pretty good. We ordered for iced americano and one orange juice for myself. Tastes good. Would recommend.

There is an enchanting coffee aroma all around the cafe which is really tempting and perfect for all the coffee lovers!

Being a coffee lover, I am absolutely heads over heels for this place !
Now a days, coffee has just become a very clichéd drink being served at every place in an unnecessary high price with absolutely trashy taste. But when it comes to really good coffee, this place does complete justice.

It's my humble request to you all, do not be blinded by places like CCD's bad coffees. Instead come and give a try to this amazing place, you'll be highly satisfied.

In the age when finding a good cafe was an accomplishment , Barista from park street was a more than decent choice . And now when there are a plenty , park street with its glam and glamour are left with most of their old ones . And , quite sadly this outlet is all glitter and so less gold .

I am an ever unenthusiastic person when it comes to endorsing outlets like CCD and this brand but this particular outlet is one I always held in high regard because I have had better service here . 

Today , i was in a need to find a suitable place for conversation . I choose this particular place because as I said I always held it for high regards . I was not that hungry so ordered the following :- 

1. Barista frappe ( 3 / 5 ) :- Decent cold coffee . Regular size was complimented properly . Didnot ask for any add ons do felt that the basic taste was okayish . A decent sip .

2. Pan mojito ( 1 / 5 ) :- Here's where it went horribly  wrong . Decided to try something different and found this one . Was very excited after ordering but it was a big mistake . The size was regular but the glass container mostly ice. The water had lime and betel leaves and it tasted pathetic .

* Cafe ambience ( 2 / 5 ) :- Although the decoration was quirky and the lightning is good there were other areas they completely flopped. Don't really why would you play disco music in a cafe where conversation should speak louder than music . You don't need any to be precise . The AC was not working and it was a very unexpected thing .

Verdict :- It was an utter dissapontment and in a place like park street we deserve better . Still , wishing all the best to the team for they have a lot of potential . I would be happy if they re-plan e everything and bring a new zing to their everyday boring already layed out business frame .

Situated at a prime location in Park Street,u cannot miss this outlet of Barista. Decided to meet a friend here for catching up sometime back. Had ordered the hazelnut latte for myself. Loved the coffee. It was well blended with milky foam on top. The hazelnut flavour was spread evenly throughout the coffee. Good place for chitchat over a sip of coffee :). You have may other options apart from coffee,just like any regular cafe/coffee shop.

When one is bereaved of quality coffee and frantically searches for a decent cafeteria (other than CCD), Barista comes to the rescue! Getting tired of drinking below average coffee from CCDs , I somewhat made up my mind I won't visit any CCD outlet in the near future. At that very moment of disappointment this place at 'firangi para' comes as a silver lining! :)
Taking the first sip of their freshly served Cappuccino, its gentle aroma & smooth taste tickled my senses! Along with it I ordered  Chicken Tikka & Spinach and Corn Sandwich. (P.S. I was really hungry at that time!) The former one was good but the latter was blah! But anyway their coffee was the showstealer. Having quenched my caffeine urge, I left the place with a smile on my face and taste of coffee lingering in my mouth! :)

I am especially very choosy when it comes to coffee. And coffee lovers in the city know that the Barista outlet at Park st. is a gem. And trust me when I tell you I only go to this Barista outlet when I am craving for espresso & teas. Like many I would definitely agree that nothing beats their signature cappuccino and earl grey tea. I love the Mocha frappe which is delicious cold coffee and ice cream. Apart from the coffees I have tried the Penne arrabiata pasta which is good and worth a try. Another personal favourite of mine includes the blueberry muffin which can go with your lattes and espressos anytime. I love the ambience here and it's spacious too. Try this Barista outlet. You won't be disappointed.

Coffee sure is their specialty but I do munch on d sides they offer like d muffins and d pastries......
Barista is known for its coffee but then I normally end up taking tea which is either Earl Grey or Ginger honey....
Do try these as they shall lift ur mood with their sheer colour and aroma....
And make sure u try the muffin they go well with tea/coffee✍

Very conveniently located, this branch of Barista Lavazza Espresso Bar is spacious and the service is really good.

I always feel that the coffee beans that they use is better than the ones used in CCDs. 
I love the Cappuccino, Lattes & Muffins. The Smoked Chicken Sandwiches are good too.
Somehow, their brownies fail to satisfy the taste buds. 

Good place to hang out with friends. 
Hence, recommended!

This place was extremely disappointing. The service was shitty. Most of the items mentioned on the menu were unavailable. The most pathetic part was paying close to 1000 bucks for terrible coffees. The iced mocha was nothing but water. No sane person would want to spend so much to drink coffee flavoured water. The coffee if made would cost below 10 bucks. The rest was just a fee to sit on Park Street.

One of the premier brands in coffee-making, now gone downhills due to their poor quality. Located right at Park Street, one of the busiest area in this city, this place has been though my all-time favorite. Whenever I pass by here and have some time to waste upon, I usually drop by to have a cup of coffee. 

The ambiance is good and so is the cleanliness. If you wanna kill time here, you could do it by simply reading on stuffs. The food here is decent but the service is slow. They would stare upon you if you happen to ask some extra condiments. Kinda overpriced, but I still love their sandwiches and mostly the chocolate cake.
If you are looking for an alternative to CCD, drop in here sometime!

I have visited this cafe so many times and a review was due. There is sort of an instant comparison with the neighbouring CCD, but then the tastes for literally everything are different. However, i am a firm believer that when i am coming to a place like this, its not just the food or rather never the food /coffee (although the menu is nowhere below excellent), what matters is the ambience and feel. This is right in the corner with the famous walking alley right in front laced with good shady trees. You could spend a good time reading or with a person churning up an interesting conversation. Yes i love this place for that one good thing and i keep coming back....

Mostly visit for a cup of coffee, it is a much better outlet than other outlets. Coffee is as usual as in the other outlets. This outlet has relatively more options actually available for the food menu. You will find some coffee table books on the book shelves which you can read while having some coffee. On the first floor there are sofas and bean bags, so if you want to lay on a bean bag, then first floor is your place. Though I prefer the center table you see just after entering, on evenings the glass exterior allows plenty of natural light to come in which I like very much. The environment is calm and you will find power sockets, so you can plug in your devices. If you are there for a weekend work kind of thing, like a code jam or some personal work stuffs, then the bench on the right side is the ideal place to put your laptop and start working.

I find the paneer tikka pockets and the smoked chicken sandwich comparatively better (same for the other outlets).

Giving a 4.0 for the nice calm environment and the nice lighting and spacious environment (in addition to the coffee).

The most wonderful thing about this outlet is its ambience which is much better than many other cafes in town. A few great things about the ambience: Space, plush interiors, interesting books to read, optimum lighting, beam bags on the first floor, comfortable seating and many others.
Coffee tastes well, nothing extraordinary. Americano, Mocha and Frappe are safe bets. Muffins were good as well. Go for it when you are satisfied with things that are less sweet.
Staff is friendly and the rates are standard.
3.5/5 - spend some time here and enjoy your coffee.

Never had this kind of coffee in this joint. Been many times at barista but this time was very upset for this coffee. We asked for sugar and got that reply that sugar nd chocolate sauce already added. The coffee was extremely bad in taste and it was without sugar and chocolate sauce.

Situated on the most lively street in Kolkata makes it crowded but then try getting the table on the upper deck and you should be good to go.

At this moment this outlet of Barista Creme has to be the best one in town. Usually not a huge fan of this brand ( anymore )  I was rather taken aback with their efficient service and good quality coffee. Barista was the first cafe to serve decent cappuccinos to Kolkata public and this particular place still serves really good coffee and snacks. Their chocolate fantasy dessert with vanilla ice cream is an old time favourite and so is the non veg calzone ( filled with cheese and minced chicken, it's quite a treat ) this place is very conveniently located, just opposite to where music world had been once upon a time ( now changed into another cafe ) and has a nice and spacious seating area, it also has an upper level which gets operational only when the place gets crowded. 
I was disappointed to hear that they were not serving affogato the day I visited, it's one my favourite drinks and I personally thank Barista for introducing me to this drink! 
We had ordered a couple of sandwiches which were fresh and grilled to perfection. It's really good to know that at least one of the outlet of this very famous chain of cafe has retained its standard. Staff is friendly and serves you promptly. If you really want to experience good old Barista magic (gurusaday outlet ) was the best, till it got shut down, you should definitely visit this outlet. The coffee is fresh and strong and the ambience nice, no screaming kids or overexcited teenagers, one can easily find a corner spot and sip coffee and enjoy solitude without being disturbed! 
Highly recommended!!

Ventured into this outlet for breakfast. The place was pretty empty as expected and the staff was just reporting for work. Service thus was slow and inattentive. Opted for the non-veg combo as I was quite hungry. It comprised of a chicken tikka sandwich, cappuccino and chocolate excess cake. I was served after a good twenty minute wait. Not to mention that I had to remind them to take down the order. Not bad for people who are not rushed in the morning.The sad part was that all the three items were served all at once. It is common sense that by the time one polishes off a decent sized sandwich the coffee would have gone cold. The sandwich was quite decent though I felt that the chicken stuffing had too much of mustard mayo in it. Thus it was hot. No complaints about the coffee. It was spot-on as expected from a café. The chocolate cake was outstanding-dark gooey chocolate, pretty moist, soft and a decent amount of flakes as a topping took the honours hands down. All in all at a price of Rs 300/- all inclusive. No bad eh! What say?

The service in Barista @park street area is so disappointing .. I have no words to say . Honestly ,I love Barista in general but maybe my bad luck I had to come across such horrible service . 
That day,I had to meet an old friend of mine from college .. And it was suppose to be a fun catching up evening in a coffee shop . But the waiter made faces at us ,just because we wanted an extra packet of brown sugar was too insulting .. And when we asked for other waiters.. It seems no one really cared. Such a horrible experience ,I must say . I wish this review bring to their notice about their bad service and bring about a change . Those who go to coffee houses usually want to leave happily and full of energy .. Not see some grumpy faces.

I remember I had visited this with my school uniform during school hours. U can might as well guess why they had not allowed me in. My memories of barista dates back to my school days. Initially it was esplanade.  Then I finally found park street definitely better than esplanade and increased the frequency of my visit. Well what about this café. A café like experience where u can sit and talk and the coffee would actually fill up your soul with its richness. Nonetheless the Caffè Latte is the thing that you must try if you want to fall in love with barista. Atleast I did so. And an almond biscotti to team up with the coffee. there have been times where I have repeated my order owing to the rich crème experience. Then you have the Caffè mocha which will equally make you fall in love. The muffins are real great. Especially the blueberry muffin and the double chocolate muffin is mwaaahh. Among the sandwiches it has to be the smoked chicken sandwich which I can keep eating for like forever. The chicken sausage roll is great as well. Among the pasta the pasta alfredo steals the show. for the dessert. I love to do brownie which is mind blowing. I think this the coffee shop available in kolkata when just coffees are an agenda. Nevertheless I feel you should not just walk in when u have money crunch as the prices are a bit on the higher side.

Went there few days back and found the same to be pretty ordinary. Had a Chicken Seekh Roll which was decent and French Fries which was also ok. Had ordered a Barista Frappe but that was the disappointment. It was not even close to the normal cold coffee we get outside. The description said along with ice cream but I dont think there was any ice cream in it, not even blended since it wasnt even cold. It was room temperature. So not sure if i would like to go back there.

Great space to sit, chat and relax. Good service and excellent coffee. I enjoy coming and eating/drinking here...actually I prefer drinking coffee since I am not a big fan of the food in the Batista ccd chain to be honest. But I can assure you you will have a nice time here if you come with a friend. I drink either plain black coffee or cafe mocha with excess chocolate. I am also a big fan of their cold coffees which have chocolate sauce and ice cream...I do not prefer paying extra for cream sicne I am not a big fan of white stuff that makes you fat. But yeah I totally recommend this place.

As Park Street is my favourite place in the whole of Kolkata i love coming to this Barista outlet very often because of its vibe and the nice atmosphere altogether.

Every time I have been here the AC doesn't work! Everything is overpriced if value is considered. Just an average place with no maintenance. Nothing much to talk about their coffee or food too. I don't visit this place anymore.

This is the second Barista Creme outlet in the city after its first on Camac Street. This is is relatively new but benefits from a top notch location just beside McDonalds outlet in Park Street.

I have always loved Barista and its high service standards but last couple of years the service has taken a decline mainly because of inadequately trained staff who at times aren't so focused on customer satisfaction. This outlet though located very conveniently, suffers from a very cramped up and congested seating arrangements unlike most of its outlets. The music is good at any Barista outlet more often than not but i do not feel so comfortable at this outlet compared to the one at Camac Street.

The staff is polite, warm and tries to customise ur coffee pretty well to your liking. Hazelnut cappuccino, barrista frappe, blast, butterscotch crunchy frappe, classic mojito are my favorite beverages alongwith a spinach n corn sandwich. The muffins here are really nice. Overall the food and service at Barista is always good n satisfactory but i would suggest one to travel a bit and visit its other outlet half a km away on camac street which is much more spacious, comfortable.

After a long day shopping at new market and park street you obviously need a break for refreshment.. Headed straight to barista and occupied the upper floor.. Had to wait for ages to place the order first and then to receive the order.. The order consisted of cappucino and green tea.. Though barista never comprises on terms of  the quality of tea and coffee. They surely spoiled our mood by making us wait .. Even if we asked them to serve 2 plain glasses of water we had to wait for 30 mins to actually get it.. Hope they improve on this aspect.. Otherwise nice place to hang out with friends...

We are thinking of some tea or coffee after we finished our meal in McDonalds. Barista is one of the few places in Park Street where you can just sit and chat without any worry. Also we wanted to play a match of chess while enjoying our drinks. We ordered ‘Espresso Coffee’ and ‘Iced Lemon Tea’. We really enjoy our drinks while playing chess. I personally think that the drinks Barista serves are pretty good value for money, and go for them when you are not eating anything heavy.

My wife and I walked in after finding Au Bon Pain crowded and the seating annoying. It was a simple manner of crossing the road and finding a nice table. It wasn't crowded at all. We ordered a coffee each... my wife ordered a Latte while I asked for a black coffee with milk. Both were served with two small cookies, crisp and nice. The coffee too was well flavoured and pretty strong, unlike most places. I wish they had served the milk in a vessel that would not spill when pouring.

A friend joined us shortly. He ordered a lemon ginger honey tea which he said was rather nice. He also asked for a muffin that was fairly nice... warmed in a microwave though.

A bill of Rs 408 was reasonable by today's standards. Its quite another thing that at least this unit of Barrista seems to have had better days.

We ordered from, and were served at the table. Service was quick, efficient and friendly.

Sit down, unwind and talk. Oh and watch Park Street flow by. But wait this is something that one can do better from the cafe across the road. The big and mighty Flury's. What does this place have that Flury's does not or what does this place not have that Flury's have? Firstly the coffee here is better (not the food) and I think the best espresso is served the Barista cafes (CCD just sucks). There is a decent egg sandwich too and some cookies. On other fronts Flury's is way ahead but what this place does not have is staff. I mean it does have staff but not the kind that keeps roaming about seeking for an opportunity to do what they are supposed to do....serve, and sometimes that is a good thing. So here you can sit, unwind and watch Park Street go by just as you would in Flury's but perhaps just a little bit more peacefully.

There was a time when Barista was a craze with us and we landed up as often as our pockets would allow. There was a certain novelty in having a place where we could chill and chat and eat but now with Cafe's mushrooming at ever corner in every locality of every kind of variety its worn off. All the CCD'S and Barista's have become clones and quite boring actually . However one cannot deny the convenience they offer to catch a brief meeting or grab a quick snack. Coming to the food and beverage part ..... Penne Alfredo with Chicken Ham n Mushroom , Smoked Chicken Sandwich and the Egg Crema Tramezzino are all decent bites to grab . Wash down with Iced Tea / Slice n Ice / Mojito ( Virgin ofcourse ! ) and the Brrista Blast are all good. For a warm beverage I usually stick to Earl grey Tea or the Cafe Mocha.

What's the big deal about a barista? No big deal may be, but there's something about the park street barista that sets it apart from the rest. May be its the location, may be its the vibe...or may be its the simple fact that they have everything they promise on the menu unlike the esplanade barista who shamelessly smile and say "sorry ma'am, this is not available"!
whatever it is, I keep going back to this particular one.
I am in love with their kokum mojito pitcher! and these guys serve a mean latte! But above all, I am a big fan of barista's banana bites...be it their banana walnut cake slice or the banana smoothie! good place to be! :)

Simply done up, one of the few places in Park Street where you can just sit and chat and not worry about being thrown out. They make a latte which is to my liking - not too bitter or too bland - just perfect, with a bit of milk foam on top that makes all the difference to me when I stir in the brown sugar. They have also started up a pitcher system of interesting mojitos and lemonades, quite tasty. Tried the Kokum Mojito and found it very nice.

The staff is nice, and they know what they are doing. At times, I have found the music a bit too loud - which is my biggest crib. Otherwise, nice!

many a late evening have been spent at this place. The outlet of barista is very close to my heart. have fond memories here. 

the staff here is very warm and friendly . Usually stick to the regular ginger honey tea. today a friend and i were sitting here and chatting while we decided to cool off with the kokum mojito pitcher. It was simply brilliant . a little steep but brilliant to taste. 

looking forward to try the other mojitos very soon

Seldom have I been so infuriated about a cafe. It was once the only decent place to get extremely good coffee whether served hot or cold and even though over the years I believe it was losing out to better options its standard was maintained even if it did not give value for money but  never have I come across cold coffee served at room temperature. I wouldn't even go into details about the weak taste of coffee even though I had asked for a strong flavoured cold coffee. When I had mentioned my dissatisfaction I was served an even worse version where the coffee was simply blend with ice cubes and in the end I had coffee flavoured water.i usually dislike confrontations in public but I was compelled to ask for the manager and I politely pointed out the shortcomings and to my amusements instead of an apology all he did was try and defend the cafe by asking me to check the temperature of the milk. His voice might  have been polite but when a customer complaints it is only polite to apologize at the least. My french fries were over-fried and I suggested that they should try and serve french fry which is neither over crunchy not soggy. I believe people pay attention to you if you are calm and dead serious with an authoritative voice rather than raising your voice and he later came and asked me if I would want to write down a  complaint and asked me if I needed anything else since he had wanted to go out. Let me be clear that in no way do I hold the person in charge or the servers responsible. I believe when one runs a family owned restaurant or cafe one puts in extra effort because it is usually one of its kind and they love it but when its a case of chain restaurants no on cares from their soul and it leads to unwanted circumstances. I have recently read on an internet site as to why experts fear that cafes as old as 500 years in Italy run by families are on the verge of shutting down due to the many fast food chain restaurants sprouting in every corner. It is a shame that while such tragedies take over the world and the world loses its different heritage tastes , corporate food chains thrive on unsatisfactory quality of food.  In case one is wondering,  making a decent glass of cold coffee is  child's play . One needs chilled milk, ice-cubes but a good amount of ice-cream for the creamy texture and extra strong brewed coffee and a blender. Now if a customer knows the secret how is it that a cafe fails to serve this simplest of recipes in its right form?
