Visited that place while passing through hatibagan; tried chicken dimsum which was very reasonable in price and the hot & sweet sauce was mouthwatering. Being a girl who doesn't like to taste much spicy food, also will rate it with 3.5. Will visit again to try pan fried chicken dimsum as they suggested.
