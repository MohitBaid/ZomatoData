I just had once from this joint but the food was just awesome ... I had burgers and fried chickens from other shops but the taste and quality of Kolkata Fried chicken is the best ... It is pocket friendly but the taste of the food is delicious ... One con that I can think of is that the burger was a bit spicy but non the less the taste was really good ...

Though a little spicy, but the quality and quanity are not compromised due to the low prices. The food is really great compared to other places. 
Must try :)

Ordered chicken wings and chicken burger. 
But the Swiggy guy only came with wings. The restaurant actually forgot to prepare the burger. So definitely not the best service. 
The wings were cold, it was cold as the Swiggy guy returned back to the restaurant to pick up the burger again. 
But the wings tasted fine. Probably would have tasted better if it would have been delivered at one go.
The burger was a complete disappointment. The hun was thick and chewy and there were no cheese. There were  only mayo and fried chicken. 
Would not recommend the burger at all!

Just a replica of the KFC and nothing else. But the price is dirt cheap and tastes almost as good as KFC. Had Chicken strips, Chicken wings and a combo meal which came with Chicken Burger, French Fries and Cold drinks.
The strips were delicious. The chicken wings can be improved. The combo meal was cool as well.
