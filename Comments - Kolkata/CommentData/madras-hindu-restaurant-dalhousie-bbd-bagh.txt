I made an online order for veg pulao with raita and sambhar. The rice used in pulao seemed to be of poor quality and barbati was used instead of beans. The raita was too sweet and the sambhar was OK. My points go to the ease of order, quick delivery and the less spicy and oily food. It's almost impossible to get good veg food from a vegetarian restaurant in strand road area. Just improvements in quality of good and ingredients can earn the restaurant a 5*

Went there for a weekday lunch. Found a lot of things on the menu with south Indian priority, but not necessarily. So decided to go for a full thali @ Rs 110/- (theres also a mini thali which doesnt include Poori @ Rs 90/-) Got 3 pooris, sambhar, aloo dry sabzi (the one used in masala dosa filling), 2 papads, butter milk, sheera, rice and a white kadhi which reminded me of Gujarati style sweet kadhi.   

The taste of food is average, but fresh. I expected atleast a rasam and one more veggie to go with the rice and poori. Anyways, its not disappointing either, as rates are reasonable. Its a busy street eatery and basic in approach. One of those few places in strand road where you can sit, order and be served a peaceful meal. I will go again to try dosas and other south Indian items.

Just the average cafe (chaalu)style place where we get food and only food. The south indian dishes they serve is good and pocket friendly. Overall a good place.

This place is situated on strand road. We visited here on Saturday on lunch time. The ambience is very simple, there is nothing special about it. The service is again ok nothing special to write. Coming to the food ,when we ordered thali it was not available so we decided to go for dosa and other things. We ordered Rava masala Dosa, cheese butter masala Dosa, dahi bade, idli sambhar and Mysore masala Dosa. Dahi bade was nice ,cheese butter masala Dosa was crispy and tasty. The Mysore masala was little tangy because they spread too much pickle on it and the Rava masala Dosa was really very bad. It was very thick just like rubber and was very oily. The Rava masala Dosa was not at all tastes like a Dosa. In fact all the dosas were oily. Idli sambhar was ok. The coconut chutney was not good. Overall I didn't like this place and you can skip this place.

Date of Visit : 09/05/2016

Location : Strand Road, very near marshal house.

Decor : not good

Service : Prompt

Food Ordered :
Dahi vada mixture 
Schezwan Masala Dosa
Gun powder Chutney
Chaas (butter milk)

Description : This restaurant is very near to my office. Was attracted with the varieties of dosas they offer. 
Dahi vada mixture is something different. It a dahi vada topped with mixture (chanachur). 
Schezwan Masala Dosa is also different item. Never tried it. Its Masala is as good as any restaurant. But disappointing part was Chutney n sambhar which is the main part of a south indian restaurants. 
Gun powder Chutney was average.
Chaas is excellent. Though it was little high on spices.
Overall average experience. Can be tried if someone wants to something different.

Coffee & beverages were delivered without covering them. Food quality of new or different items was not at all good. Regular food items was ok....ok....
