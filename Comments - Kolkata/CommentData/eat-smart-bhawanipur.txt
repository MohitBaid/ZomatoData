Though am a regular customer of this restaurant but for the very first time i am very disappointed by them. I recieved my food in a very unprofessional way. They gave a packet of sauce which was all over the box of food. It was soo messy . Hope they look after these kinds of problem.

Used to order from here a lot . Today I found hair strands in my food. It is unhygienic avoid eat smart. Also they have degraded the quality. It tastes pathetic now.

Being a regular customer I can say the food is quite good. but in my  last order the Mounchrian was damn spicy that could easily burn your mouth.Rest everything is good.

The review is based on 3 simple orders, hence its kind of limited!

My orders were online and staple: Fried Rice, Chicken in Chilli Honey, Chilli Chicken!

The order took 1.25 hours to reach home (Restaurant to Park Street).

Fried Rice: The rice was a little hard. Like my mom says, ek kanni baki hai! It was 7/10 done whereas it should have been 9/10 done and then used as proper fried rice. The quantity was decent for me (I can eat for 2 at a time). The rice had less of soya sauce which makes it look authentic but more of vinegar, which I do not prefer. The strips of chicken and egg was sufficient considering the price! Prawn would be 5ps to be precise but then again: Price! Overall: 3/5

Chicken in Chilli Honey: Less of Honey and more of tomato and sugar. When cooked in honey, it glazes and leaves a sticky feeling to chicken. Gravy has a thick and light sweet taste. It was heavy sweet and light gravy! The chicken has no coating of cornflour so that's authentic and portion was very good! Overall:3.5/5

Chicken in Chilli Sauce: This is your own chilli Chicken made Indian Style. Good portion, had mushrooms, nice feeling of the chilli sauce! No cornflour coating! Overall:4/5

Revised review after third order:
Three strands of hair in my food! Ridiculous.
PLEASE AVOID EAT SMART.

Revised review after a second order-
Onion pancakes which were crispy, fried and tasty! The Thai green curry was smooth and delicious. loved the Hakka noodles, honestly enjoyed it. The stir fried veggies in white sauce was delicious. Pretty content!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ordered from here via zomato delivery and honestly disappointed with the delivery done by the restaurant. While zomato confirmed that the order has left, it took 45 mins delay to reach a distance hardly 10mins away.
Not justified since eat smart is an all delivery restaurant!

My order-
‚Ä¢ veg steam momos- pieces were nice and taste was good. Like the garlic chilli sauce. But order came in cold!
‚Ä¢ veg pan fried noodles. The noodles were not fried and the gravy was extremely bland. Liked the flavor, if only it had a little bit of salt. I know corn starch based gravies are mild but this one had no salt!

The only plus is the economical price. But that is justified with the food and the fact that you cant dine in.

Not sure about trying this place again.

Excellent food. Efficient service and fast delivery. The joint is already famous for its take-away service. I had ordered twice from them on zomato. Chicken lat me kai was okay but what really impressed me was the crispy chilli Babycorn. If only it had a proper seating arrangement!

Ordered dry shezwan crunchy chiken & crispy chili babycorn yesterday from Eat Smart. Food arrived little late than promised time even though restaurant is max 20 mins walking distance from delivery spot. If that is ok, what I did not like was the quantity in chicken dish. It was too less to even fill half of the container it came in. & surprisingly the crispy chilli baby corn was more full than container can hold. It seems they compensated chicken amt with the veg dish and I faced this first time with a restaurant, yet!! But food was delicious & hence the rating.

Out of my compulsion to try out a new place whenever possible, I decided to order today from this place. 

I simply ordered for a Non Veg Mixed Chilli Garlic Noodles. And boy was I impressed. Amazing quantity with heaps of chicken, egg and prawns! That too only for 170! I was blown away by the taste and would certainly order these noodles again soon along with some other dishes. 

Till then, I definitely recommend this place for their noodles if nothing else! 

Happy Dining!

New joint but maintained good quality & quantity. The combo meal was good enough for single consumption. ¬†I wish them all the best :) New delivery system of Zomato also seemed to be good & efficient. Looking forwarding to having more from your joint. Good job done !
