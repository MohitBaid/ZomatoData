Well most of d ppl have heard about Aminia, one of the oldest biriyani stops in d city.
This outlet was better than previous outlets as per me. If cheese lovers are visiting then go for chicken cheese kababs which is loaded with cheese and tasted yummy being a little heaavy dish. I have also ordered mutton Awadhi Biriyani and believe me one plate was more than enough for 2ppl.
You can also try tha Korma and chap here.
One think that I want to say that here at Chinar park you will find both Arsalan and Aminia located side by side. I had biriyani at both places and felt that Aminia's was better.
P.S: This was only for the Chinar park(Rajarhat) outlet

One of the newer branches of Aminia which does justice to its brand in a way. We had the usual blend of kebabs and biriyani which did not disappoint me. Nothing extravagant about the place, the food is decent, service is a bit delayed I thought, decor is good enough. Overall a decent experience.

Very much recommended for those biryani lovers who love light biryani. The taste of the biryani is pleasant and the quantity is more than enough for a person. Try out the Chicken Achari Kebab for it's deliciousness. Chicken Awadhi Biryani is reasonable for two in terms of quality as well as quantity. The decor is clean and seating arrangements much better than the other Aminia outlets. Servicing is of moderate standard. Try to avoid weekends as the restaurant then remains packed. Waiting to pay a second visit.

Quality of food is not upto the mark,considering the price they are charging.Quantity is also a big drawback with most of the Aminia outlets.
Liked the Chicken Chaap here,but the masala kulcha was not good.Firni was average.
The waiters did stared alot while paying the bill,almost forced us to pay tips with their gestures.
Yet i respect their value in kolkata for their Biryani.but this time,i am sorry.no good memories except that firni.

When in Kolkata you have to try the biryani and fish I was told this before I visited Kolkata for the first time. So we choose this place to have our experience. 
The place is huge. Easy to locate. There was waiting but we quickly got a table. 
We went for chicken biryani and veg biryani and fish butter tikka masala. 
Now the staff is polite and courteous, the service was quick compared to the amount of people they cater at a time. 
The chicken biryani was yummy. Had patato which was something new. But it was amazing. 
The veg biryani too was cooked well n yummy. 
The best expiernce was the fish curry. Just delicious. Usually I dnt like fish personally but the fish fish had me converted. 
Would definitely recommend dis place if someone wants an authentic experience. 
U can also try rolls n kebabs on the ground floor area as they dnt serve it at the tables.

Well what can I say about this place? Along with Arsalan, Aminia is kind of a box standard for Biriyani and kebabs, Kolkatans go out and try to compare the local biriyani with what is served in these places. Kebabs are generally good I consider it better than Karim's in Old Delhi, only difference being the Galawati Kebabs, that honor has to go to Tunday Kebabi of Lucknow...

The year was 1999 – it was going to be my first stay away from home. Kolkata was meant to be my destination for the next three years and Presidency College Girls Hostel my address. The night before my parents went back to my home town, leaving me on my own for the first time, we dined at the Aminia outlet opposite Elite cinema. It used to be a favorite of my dad’s during his post graduation days in the city. Over the years, there have been quite a few options serving great biriyani but I keep visiting Aminia mostly  for the nostalgia it holds in my heart. This weekend, we decided to revisit the Aminia outlet near Chinar Park, Rajarhat and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised to see some positive changes in the attitude and feel of the place. Located on Rajarhat road, this outlet  had a queue of people waiting to get in when we arrived. It is still that popular.

The food and ambience are both good, but the rigid behavior of the staff can be an issue...specially if with a small kid. Recently had a bad experience while having lunch with my family. Since there was waiting and our kid was hungry, we ordered an egg role from their take away counter. By the time the roll was ready we had already got a seat and ordered our food from within the restaurant. Surprisingly, the rude staff won't allow the roll to be consumed by a 4.5 year kid inside the restaurant since that's against their boss's rule (they told me that the rule was by their hyper sensitive BOSS)....had to go out of the restaurant to feed it to my daughter who was by now starving. Glad that the little one also understood the misdemeanor and requested me to never go back to the place!! It's off my list for ever. Wish them all the luck with their absurd rules!!

An all time favourite. Be it a hectic weekday or a  weekend get together to get quality food and service at any hour of the day (from 11am to almost midnight) Aminia is the best option.We have been there, opted for take away or ordered  for home delivery for get togethers thousands of time.Never had it failed to satisfy.Nothing so special about the ambience.But the service is very prompt.They serve the famous Kolkata style Biriyani with potato and egg in it.All the starters are so lip smacking that it’s quite hard to mention any one specially.The Mutton Galouti  and Kakori kebabs just melt in the mouth.Those are heavenly.The Boti kebab too remains always in our order.Personally I don’t  have any liking for their iconic one pot meal  “Aminia Special“as I am not a  roti ‘n gravy person.
For dessert Firni is a must.On weekends and holidays there remains a huge rush even for take away.So it is better to be there with a lot of time in hand.

We went to Aminia on a mildly cold winter afternoon. There was already a small crowd relishing their lunch. We ordered Mutton Awadhi Biriyani that contains two mutton pieces, one egg, one boiled potato piece and a few kofta balls. 
The Biriyani was served in a few minutes. It tasted really good. The mutton pieces were succulent and juicy and when eaten together with the potato and beautifully prepared rice, it tasted delicious. One can definitely try this dish. He won't be disappointed. 
Lastly we ordered phirni. It was also served in a jiffy but it was okayish. It could have been a lot better. 
The prices were well within the budget. 
All in all, it was a good experience.

I will recommend this place if you are looking for very light weight kolkata style biriyani and tandoor items. 

Chicken Achari Kebabs was soft & juicy served with curd and mint mix. 

Mutton Biriyani was good, light weight served with a big piece of potato and tender soft big piece of mutton. Quantity was moderate so was the value for money. 

Tengri tandoor masala was exceptionally good. It was a gravy based preparation cooked with tandoor leg piece of chicken. The smokey flavored tengri masala went very well with the biriyani. 

It was time for dessert and we ordered their famous phirni. It was served on a earthen pot and it was exceptionally good in taste. Phirni is a must have if you are visiting Aminia. 

1st floor sitting arrangements made the ambience crowded so you can forget about your personal space. Staffs were cordial and servings were on the time.

This is my nth visit in Aminia, I remember visiting Anima with my parents, when I was little, during the pujas and standing outside waiting for our turn to enter and sit at a table, and growing impatient on when our turn will come, fighting the ever growing urge of sinking my teeth in the tender mutton piece of their Biriyani.
Anyways, today's experience is pretty much 'forgettable'. Visiting the Chinar Park outlet on a Sunday, after 8, means you have a wait time. We got seat upstairs, the music was loud, place was crowded, undermanned staff. We had tandoori chicken, Awadhi mutton biriyani and fresh lime soda. Tandoori was OKish, Biriyani was not at all the Awadhi I was expecting, do not go by their words that it's 1.5 times the normal mutton biriyani, it's not, it's actually the same quantity just with 2 mutton pieces. I, by now have had Biriyani from enough number of different places to provide a comparison scale. The Awadhi mutton biriyani is a 6/10, I forgot take a pic, this time, apologies for that :-p. And DO ABSOLUTELY TRY their fresh lime sodas, I discovered a completely new taste, tough it tasted more like masala cold-drinks, the cold-drink being Mountain Dew, because sweet factor was dominant, but I would like to hear your version, it is definitely anything but fresh lime soda but still, you know.
All in all, my next Biriyani stop will be....... anywhere but Aminia. So long, my friend...

The decor is elegant with more than enough seating arrangements both for big groups and couples. 
Food is too delicious specially the masala kulcha and chicken reshmi butter masala. Firni is a must try for all.
Food isn't over priced and the food is worth the price.
It's exactly at Chinar park bus stop.

I went here to have dinner on a Monday night.
Table was available without waiting time fortunately.
Ambience of this restaurant is okay, just like any other fast running restaurant, nothing very luxurious.
I ordered tangri kebab for starters and it was very good.
For the main course I took butter naan and mutton Rogan Josh both of which were disappointing.
Butter naan was overly sweet.
Rogan Josh was bland and was chewy and hard, terribly dissatisfied with it.
I think this place is more suited for the biryani. I noticed almost all tables had biryani, for side dishes like Rogan Josh , Arsalan nearby has much better taste.
Staff was cordial.
I would revisit mainly because of its location, and try Hyderabadi biryani the next time.
Its not an expensive place, cost effective.

I am rating it 1 star not because of their food quality. The take away service is awfully bad. They will prioritize your order based on the bill amount and customers dining inside the resturant. I ordered 5 tandoori rotis and was made to wait for exactly half and hour. Could you imagine that? Half an hour for 5 rotis. Moreover, i could watch from outside a chef continiously making rotis and yet they made us wait. There was another customer with the same issue. Please stop discriminating based on order bills. Doesn't suit such a brand name like Aminia. Do train your servicemen aptly.

Today we visited Chinar Park Aminia branch and we had a great experience. We ordered chicken tanduri kebab , chicken tengri kebab, awadhi chicken biriyani and firni.
1. Chicken Tanduri Kebab : Taste was really amazing and properly cooked.
2. Chicken Tengri Kebab : Taste was wow , chicken was soft, tendered and kebab was juicy and fully cooked.
3. Chicken Awadhi Biriyani : Really i had an awesome biriyani after so many days . Biriyani contained two chicken pieces which were properly cooked , 1 egg , 1 potato and it was really melted in mouth and overall Biriyani was not spicy and rice was also very good.
4. Firni : This is always my favourite desert item and firni was very tasty and it had saffron flavour also.

Our overall experience was very good and we enjoyed the food also. We will visit this branch soon😍

Mostly famous for Signature Biriyani and Kebabs. Tried few dishes...

Chicken Tangri Kebab
Chicken Reshmi Kebab
Mutton Dum Biriyani
Mutton Awadhi Biriyani
Peas Pulao
Chicken Handi

Tangri Kebab was just awesome and a good start as well. Reshmi Kebab was fine. Mutton Dum Biriyani was good but no way closer to Authentic Hyderabadi Biriyani’s like Hotel Shadab, Bawarchi, Shah and Ghouse. Awadhi Biriyani quantity was good. 

Staffs should be well behaved.

One of the best Biriyani houses in the city.
Visited so many times but seems equally tasty.
Today again visited with husband and brother in law.  The awadhi Muttoni biriyani comes with its aroma, color , tenderness of the biryani Alu, egg and soft mutton pieces and  simply blows our mind once again.
Though this biriyani dont require any complimentary side dish or any starter item. Bt we offered chicken tengri kabab as starter. It's also good enough with its softness of the chicken piece.
Completed​ our lunch with desert Firni.

Ordered ------------- Chicken Biryani, Chicken Reshmi Kebab, Firni. 


The PROS :-


Food -- Already Famous for their Biryani so no judgment from my side but still as a description for my fellow foodies - Chicken & Rice Perfectly cooked, Rich Aroma & even less oily. Reshmi kebabs were great, so soft & juicy. Completely smitten by the Phirni.Texture, softeness, sweetness all were perfectly balanced. 


Staff - When I visited it yesterday night, The restaurent was so houseful but due the staff's great management, I didn't had to wait much longer. They are professional, polite & cooperative. 


Dećor- As it was houseful so was not able to explore much but I found the seating area very clean & hygienic.



The CONS:- The Aloo in the Biryani was not cooked fully & was a lil raw. I think the service was a bit long but this can be avoided as the restaurent was packed with customers.

Aminia has several outlets in our city. More or less I've been experienced from all of them. For most of the 90's kids (though we're not kid anymore) Aminia is nostalgic because whenever (or even once) we went to New Market area with our parents we visited Aminia for Mughal Dishes at least for one time. So we have a soft corner for this name. Even after getting some bad reviews. So one day we decided to go a different outlet so we choose this one and surprised. Here is the gist review.

Food- Brilliant. Sublime. Awesome. Biryani is absolutely stunning. Better than it's neighbor ;) The curry dishes and rotis are perfect.
Decor- Really cozy. Best among all other outlets. Love the place.

Behaviors of the staffs are good. They took not much time to serve. Overall great experience.
From me an awesome 9/10

The food is classic. Everyone in Kolkata must have tried aminia. The naans and biriyani is very good. Like there's nothing new to say.. It's very common taste. The staff here is good and fast. The restaurant is big and spacious and looks good. I really find aminia better than arsalan and the phirni is really amongst the best I've ever tasted.

Last time I have ordered Chicken Kasturi Kabab, Mutton Biriyani with extra Boti, Chicken Tangri Butter Masala and firni. Biriyani was lovely as always. Kabab was so soft and yummie. Butter Masala was very tasty and perfect as a side dish with biriyani. I recommend particularly this outlet for you all. Go and try!

This place and it's Biryani ❤️
It is located near Chinar Park crossing. The ambience of this place is good, but the service was not upto the mark. The staffs were slow in everything and they seemed to be confused. 
Coming to the food. We ordered Chicken Reshmi Kebab,  Mutton Awadhi Biryani, Chicken Handi and Rumali Rotis. 
Chicken Reshmi kebab : The taste was okayish. The chicken pieces were not that soft and were a bit stiff. 

Chicken Handi : This is the dish which everyone should try.  The best Chicken Handi I have ever had. It tastes soo good and the chicken were properly cooked. 

Mutton Awadhi Biryani : It consists of 2 mutton pieces,  1 egg and a potato. The quantity is quite good and is sufficient for two people. Coming to the taste the mutton pieces were soft and succulent. The taste was just awesome. 

A great place for Biryani Lovers! ❤️

I went there yesterday with my brother. The situation was pathetic there. AC was not working and it was very hot inside. The whole floor was wet. I was initially worried but at last ordered my food. I ordered 4 coke but something else was supplied other than coke and while someone brought the soft drink one of the container fell in our table while delivering the soft drink.

Altogether it was a horrible experience for me yesterday.

After all these I could not enjoy my food at all.
All i remember is the horrible experience.

I am very unsatisfied with the kind of treatment we received yesterday.

Awadhi mutton biryani taste was very good but mutton quality was horrible. Mutton piece was mostly bone and completely fibrous. On top of that there was no mutton kofta in biryani and on calling them they non-chalantly said probably they missed and there's nothing they can do about it. This kind of attitude is definitely not good for their business. Also they need to take the takeaway customers more seriously. I think they pass anything if it's takeaway since customer can't check on spot.

I have always found Aminia a real value for money.

Back to back two days before Saptami , I had ordered food from Aminia.

Tried Egg Biryani and Reshmi Chicken Butter Masala , the biryani tasted vey good and the butter masala was not much oily as well.

For occasional home deliveries especially when we do not feel like cooking at night , very affordable and pocket friendly option.

In addition to this the double chicken roll and Chicken Chap are awesome as well.

food is full of OIL little high on salt, biryani again was full of artificial flavors, service staff and counter staff are biggest negative  of this restaurant they would ensure guest would not come back i think.

I had here Chicken biriyani, mutton tawa masala, rumali roti,chicken tengri kebab and mutton keema. I must say all of the dishes are mouthwatering. These are fav selections. Chicken tengri kebab was nice and juicy. Keema and tawa masala were very good to have with soft rumali rotis. At the end I had firni which is milky and smooth.

Located at Chinar Park, Rajarhat, this branch of Aminia is spacious. The white and golden decor gives a majestic touch to its interiors. When it comes to authentic Biriyani and Kebabs, Aminia never disappoints. This branch is no different. The staff is extremely courteous and will guide you in choosing the best dishes according to your appetite, even during their busiest hours. We had Chicken Tandoori, Butter Naan, Tandoori Roti, Mutton Rezala and Chicken Tandoori Butter Masala. As expected, the Naans and Rotis were soft and perfectly cooked, the gravies were lip-smacking. Highly recommended, anytime.

Worst experience. Yesterday went to Aminia Rajarhat along with a friend. We were made to wait for half an hour despite lots of tables being free. Finally we were given a table. Since we were in a hurry , we ordered for one chicken biryani n one mutton biryani. After having the biryani for lunch , by evening we started feeling stomach pain and cramps. Had to skip dinner and felt like I would vomit. Same was the case for my friend who had chicken biryani.

In fact , few days back some of my friends visited Aminia in park circus and we're served spoile@d rotten chaanp which led them to puke later in the night.

I will never visit Aminia again , even if the food is free.

Been there for twice now in a week, nice cozy place, in weekends you would have to wait a little while before you get a seat if you are in couple or alone. 

Tried Anchari Tikka Kebab for the first time(Tangree Kebab being our favourite we hardly try any other Kebab), it was really good, so repeated it on the next visit. 

On first visit, Chicken Awadhi Biriyani and Hara Keema. If you have never tried Awadhi Biriyani in Aminia,  I would insist you to do so, as you would taste that Kofta in it,  you would hardly order the Normal One. Next the Hara Keema(mutton) was also nice. I was surprised that they don't server the Aminia Special Pudding here, so went for Firni which is also one of our most common orders while visiting Aminia

On second day,  went for Tandoori Roti n Aminia Special Mutton Curry in main course. This curry is a favourite dish of my wife,  I tasted it for the first time and yes,  liked it very much, the light gravy of (tender and juicy) Mutton with a whole Tomato, Potato and Egg(boiled) would surely make you it's fan.

This one was wonderful experience... This outlet is  specially desgined very well,situated just beside chinar park bus stop...one can easily locate it as it is just at the roadside...a little decor and cozy ambience will make your dining experience even better.

Now come to food...previously I've tasted Arsalan biriyani at the Rajarhat outlet... That was ridiculously bad tasting....so we went here with zero expectations and while ordering stuck to the basics
But what we got was quite satisfying... We ordered Egg biriyani,Tandoori roti,Chicken bharta...
*egg biriyani was delicious consisting 2 eggs... Bliss for egg lovers and perfectly cooked.
*Chicken bharta also was very nice....though a bit oily but tasted good...chicken pieces were soft and juicy.
*tandoori roti was also nice...nothing special to mention
Staff behavior was ok...bill was quite expected... Pocket pinch is medium.
I would specially mention one thing...if someone is confused between Arsalan and Aminia....then later is a far better choice.

When you think of Biryani in Kolkata the first name which comes in your mind is Aminia.
The taste of Biryani is Awesome here and can be enjoyed with Chicken or mutton chap.
The traditional cooking of biryani is followed and the quantity they provide is fulfilling for one person.

This was my first visit at this particular outlet in Chinar Park. Ambiance was average and the staffs were well informed. But the service was very slow. Ordered chicken sheek kebab, garlic naans and chicken handi. The food was average but what i disliked was they took nearly 45 mins to serve the starters itself. Then after completing the starters had to wait for another 20 mins for the main dishes.

The famous biriyani brand in Kolkata. Nothing to describe anything details about this one I guess. So this will be a pretty crisp review.

Location: At chinar park. And yes just beside the road.

Decoration: okay and nice type. Nothing special but pretty clean and clear.

Food:
________
✓ Mutton Biriyani: very nice. The proper Bengali biriyani. Yes with a piece of mutton and Aloo.
✓ Chicken Biriyani: nice one. And as it like proper traditional Bengali biriyani, I loved it. Come with 1 piece of chicken and Aloo.
✓ Lahori Chicken: four pieces of well cooked chicken in Indian masala gravy. If you come here this is recommended, go well with biriyani.
✓ chicken chap : disappointed. Not liked it.

✓ Natural Ice-cream - in desserts we opted for the famous natural icecrm brand. They had the dab and nolen gur options. We took the nolen gur Ice-cream and as usual it was superb.

All that cost : 1260 for 3 heads.

Yes a good place for biriyani lovers for sure.

Firstly, the location is spot on. Parking is bit of a problem, but managable. It's basically one of those old-school restaurants, where the service is damn fast, food is good in qty, average in taste and overall experience is okay-ish. The reason for my such good rating is their hyderabadi biryani and chicken cheese kebab. The regular kolkata biryani is quite average, but the meat quality and size makes up for it. Chicken reshmi tikka is decent.

Situated at Chinar Park, just beside Cloud 9 and Arsalan, crowded by all class of people from students to officials.

AMBIENCE- Its ambience is quite great.A unique combination of modern decor and classical music and provided with a very fine, maintained sitting.

SERVICE- Service is quite efficient. The staff were very much well mannered nd pleasant. Serving of food took only about 5-10 minutes. 

FOOD- We ordered mutton biriyani and chicken biriyani which was amazing both in taste and smell. Lastly we ordered firni as our desert,which was served chilled. It was proper tasty.

Overall experience at Aminia was amazing.
Hope to visit again in near future.

Tried their mutton biriyani...2 piece mutton for 330 including GST...quantity was very good...size of the mutton piece was also satisfactory... but the main issue was taste....taste was missing from biriyani.... their main branch(Esplanade) makes much better biriyani than this one... the mutton was cooked but not very soft...so overall I don't think I will visit this restaurant again... I was wondering has Kolkata lost its art of making good Biriyani? 😰😰😰

Been here twice with friends.
FOOD:
Must try their mutton Biriyani 😍 and raita.
The Awadhi biriyani is nothing so special other than the two pieces of mutton,of course. 😁

SERVICE:
Must Improvise!!
My friend had ordered chicken Awadhi biriyani as he doesn't eat mutton but they brought him mutton. On discovering that and informing them about the same, the waiter just took the pieces of chicken from his plate using the fork and brought back the mutton. Didn't like it at all. I mean, when you're asked to replace, you take the whole dish back and replace it with a proper one, right? 😑

AMBIENCE:
Nice.

In all,a good place to enjoy Mughlai.

Not very crowded and very nice place to hangout. Coming to the food, we ordered Veg biriyani, chicken biriyani, masala kulcha, Butter Nun, Mutton, paneer butter masala. Each and every one of them tasted nice and it was a treat to our taste buds.

Mutton Biryani was Outstanding. It was light; moist & Aromatic. It had one Big size Mutton & Potato pieces. The Potato was Soft and perfectly-cooked. The Mutton piece was Succulent & Moist. Highly Recommended. (5/5).

Lahori Chicken (4pcs) was Excellent. The Chicken pieces were Soft, Juicy & Tender with the perfect mix of exotic spices, adds to the right balance and consistency to the thick oily gravy. Try It !!! (4/5).

After multiple visits and great food, I here by rate it 5.
What you should try :🔸 chicken cheese kebab, 🔸chicken Reshmi kebab, 🔸veg hara bhara kebab and 🔸chicken tangri. In main course we had🔸 paneer dopaiza ( never have I ever taste such an amazing preparation)
🔸chicken lahori ( yummy but could be less oily, it has a good hint of mustard oil) 🔸tawa mutton and mutton handi are great🔸reshmi tikka masala ( such succulent pieces), kulcha and naan were soft. Finally I had 🔸chicken awadhi biriyani which was had a fine line of masala and mildness and the best cooked potato ❤️ with tender chicken pieces. Don't forget 🔸firni, it was better than kabuliwala's.
Ambiance, service and quality of food was good and it's pretty light on pocket. It's crowded, let me warn you before hand. 
Totally recommended for parties and group eatings.

This place is definitely for biriyani lovers. I have visited a lot of restaurants renowned for biriyanis but this place surprises me. Took mutton biriyani as a takeaway and the taste was mouthwatering and the quantity was very good. Takeaway was given to us within 5 mins of ordering. This is the best place for biriyani. Tried biriyani from other outlets of aminia and also arsalan but this particular outlet provides with the best quality and quantity of biriyani. Hope to visit here soon again.

The staff is very hospitable and the ambience is also great. Now coming to the food,the nest choice for me has been their Special biryani that is easily sufficient for two people. The kebabs are very tasty and succulent. I recommend their Galauti kababs.They tasted so great!The firni is yummy.I have got better service here than the original Aminia. I definitely look forward to my next visit.

Biryanis are much lighter in aminia compared to that in arsalan.
This branch located in chinar park serves great biryanis and among then hyderabadi biryani is a must try which comes with raita as complementary dish.

Aminia - A great experience! 
=====
Location + Intro:

This outlet of Aminia is located somewhere near Chinar Park Area. I was crossing back from Airport and somehow found this on Zomato. 

I had gone here sometime ago with a friend. The outlet is quite beautifully decorated with cloth hanging from the ceiling making the ambiance even more soothing to the eyes. The ambiance of the place is really good and even the staffs who were serving us were all dressed properly in the uniform and behaving courteously with us. 
=====
What i ordered: 

• Chicken Biriyani - The biriyani was excellent. Unlike the new market Aminia where the biriyani had got a subtle taste. This one is masaledar. The aloo was cooked to perfect and the chicken was succulent and moist. It is like a perfect biriyani. I really relished on this one. #musttry

• Chicken Rezala - The rezala is a mughlai dish which is usually always rich. I enjoyed their rezala as well too. It was creamy and going hand in hand with the biriyani. 
======
Pros:

• Reasonably priced. 
• Good service.
• Great ambiance.
• Huge seating capacity.
• Hygiene is maintained. 
=====
Meal for two: 350-800 approximate. (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc)
=====
Summary:

Food Quality 4/5

Food Quantity 4.2/5

Taste 4.2/5

Presentation 3.9/5

Hospitality 4/5

Ambiance 4/5

VFM 4/5
=====
Expert Sugggestion:
Improving the food presentation will surely make your restaurant class apart! 
=====
Conclusion: 

I loved the experience here. Hope to come back soon again. Highly recommended especially if you love Mughlai Cuisine.

A miserable franchisee of its Famous Outlet in the Heart of Kolkata, this Aminia 's will do nothing but disappoint its patrons. Awful quality of Biriyani, absence of the Trademark Egg and Aloo Combo of Kolkata' s Biriyani, Blood stained Chicken pieces only makes its visitor's repent with their choice by just blindly following the Brand Name. Bad Service quality and Customer Service makes one's conviction to avoid these Outlet ever again. A small caution to kolkata's first time visitors, please give this outlet a miss, Since we Kolkatans value our Biriyani s reputation more than anything, so don't judge us by this awful rendition of a Terrible version of Kolkata Biriyani.

The biryani is heavenly and fills the stomach like a volcano 😂 Just love the Afghani style menu and for a hungry day, I would look no other way and head to Aminia for a plate full of chicken biryani and chicken reshmi kabab along with lassi! Slurp! Gotta go there now! You see I'm already hungry! 😂😋

I have a very mixed experience with Aminia. These type of restaurants mostly runs because of brand value and most of the time they never maintained the quality. With increasing price in last one year for same biriyani 3 times they served very low quality biriyani. I will request please be careful with this restaurant. See the news in TOI about the The South Dumdum Municipality recently raid for serving unhygienic food.

Aminia, Rajarhat is located at a very convenient location whose ambience is thoroughly royal and one of the top-notch in the area. Had to wait for 15 minutes to get inside but the food was worth the wait. We ordered mutton reshmi kebab, chicken tangri kebab, chicken chaap and mutton kassa along with rumali and tandoori rotis. Everything was upto the mark except for chicken chap which could have used some more oil in it. Overall, it's one of the finest choices for family dinners.

I usually place online order from Aminia Nagerbazar branch however this time order got placed my mistake to this branch. First of all the delivery was too late and secondly the all the mutton pieces in the biriyani was simply a bone with almost no meat. So it was awful. Please don't fool your customers if it's a delivery order. Aminia Nagerbazar doesn't do that.

I have lived most of my life in the northern part and the southern part of india. Eastern part of India and especially Kolkata is a new destination for me now. I have been here for the past few weeks and have been trying all the hyped/praised/liked/known restaurants and outlets. Heard a lot about aminia and arsalan and have tried them as well...I liked Arsalan's biryani more as compared to Aminia's biryani. The biryani offered at Aminia is just okayish but still better than most of the biryanis offered in New Delhi where i non persistently tried different biryanis for 4 years and failed to find one which i would call awesome.

Apart from the Biryani , the kababs especially Goulati Kabab and Chaps were very good and comparable to the ones you will find in New Delhi and Lucknow. Mutton Burra Kabab served at Nizams and Karims at New Delhi is quite famous and rightly as well. The mutton Burra kabab i had at Aminia was even better than the ones at Nizam , Delhi.  It was one of the most properly cooked Mutton Burra Kabab. This one is a must have on my list from now whenever i visit Aminia.

Overall i would say its a good place for mughlai and tandoori items.

Myself any my wife had visited this place after a late night movie. We went in with hunger in our belly...but came out after having dinner cursing the cook all through the drive back to our den.

We had ordered Chicken Reshmi kebab. It was bland. It was dry and the juices had not seeped in. We then ordered Chicken Bharta and Masala Kulcha. Masala Kulcha was OK. Chicken bharta was tasteless.
Bottom-line: Depressed and dissatisfied

Probably the best outlet of aminia. It's mutton biriyani is one of a kind. I specially love the kebabs and tandoori there. Also they have less variety in deserts but i will always suggest one to try their special firni. Don't know why they stopped making caramel custard but they made it quite well too. The ambience is quite nice obviously you cannot get the vibe of most restaurants in park street. Nevertheless it's a good to go at an affordable price.

The worst experience in my life  in a chain restaurant like these. Wee asked the waiter to change our water glass because it was dirty and full of water and he get another glass same as the previous one. They give us bottle water which I refuse to take and they didn't even bother to serve us regular water after asking 2 time the waiter finally serve us regular water. Wee order masala kulcha along with chicken hundi. The kulcha was like a potato stuff paratha and the hundi  was full of oil Indian food not has to full of oil the hundi taste was ok but the gravy was oily not exactly a gravy it was oil only by the way the staff was very rude while taking order this type of behavior is not expected in hospitality industry.

Appalling experience with 2 year old kid in Aminia!!!

Though today (15th April 2017) began like a normal day for me and my family, but a bad incident in Aminia @ Chinar Park will make us remember the day for long and never again to visit this restaurant. Me, my wife and our 2 year old kid left this restaurant in less than 5 minutes with a bad taste in mouth. Aminia ensured that all this happened without us even tasting their food! After finding a place to sit, while we were going through the menu, my wife took out a mother dairy mishti doi (85g pack) to feed our 2 year old son. The waiter immediately told my wife not to feed the sweet curd to our son. We were taken aback and asked the waiter to confirm with the management. The waiter came back and confirmed that we cannot feed the mishti doi to our 2 year old son. We decided to leave the restaurant, never to come back again. We went to the restaurant besides Aminia (which is again one of the big restaurant chains in Kolkata) where they allowed us to to feed our kid. Our 2 year old son is still not used to outside food from restaurants and I am sure the same is true for other parents having small kids as well. Though we never carry the full usual meal for our son to a restaurant, but we have been carrying some snacks like biscuits, sweet curd, etc which the little one can have while we have the food from the restaurant's menu. This has never been a problem so far and the restaurants we have been so far with our little one always allowed this as an exception to babies and small kids. It is disheartening to know that Aminia is trying to do business at the cost of a 2 year old kid. Even restaurants abroad allow this. A very big thumbs down in present world's hospitality industry where customer delight and not customer satisfaction is the goal. We won't recommend this restaurant to anyone not because of the food, but because the restaurant management lacks the basics of hospitality and humane outlook!

One of the better aminia outlets in the city. 
Good quick service. Nice airy space. 

We were five and went on a Friday afternoon and got the seats instantly. It's like the outlet is easily locate-able, easily spotted from the Chinar park crossing. We ordered 2 mutton biryani, 2 chicken biryani, chicken tengri tandoori masala, butter naan, paneer do piazza and firni. The biryani was fresh, quantity is enough for one. Succulent and big piece of chicken, mutton however disappointed. The tandoori masala wasn't too great to write home about and tasted decently with the biryani. Naan was soft and really liked the paneer do piazza. Firni was fine. 

Will suggest this outlet to friends.

The Ad over here does not mention that the order needs to be minimum of Rs.1000 for a Home Delivery which is ridiculous for wasting my time, energy and money to give them a call. Zomato should review their own Policy along with Aminia's. Stop abusing and wasting customer's time and money. I called up just now and got declined because it needs to be Rs.1000.. What a Joke??

I guess it is one of the relatively new outlet of Aminia.. Me and my group of friends went there around 1'o clock. Fortunately it was pretty empty. The ambience was quite good. We ate mutton biriyani an it was good and well seasoned.  The mutton was also quite tender. The service was excellent. We didn't have to wait long for our biriyani. Overall a pleasant experience.

I've been to this place many times. Their food quality fluctuate between 3 - 4; if I'm imagining a scale of 5.

Location wise it's very easy reach as it's.at the chinar park crossing.

Location: from Chinar Park crossing walk towards City Centre New Town after walking 1-2mins you will reach one of the dominant Biryani restaurant in the town.
Ambience: Just 9/10 for to dine with your soul mate or with your family
Decor: Good, after watching that reasonable price tag they are provided
Food: Food is the main focus for foodies & all so, in this case without any doubt it is stupendous & from me it's 10/10

We ordered chicken_cheese_kebab, mutton_biryani, chicken_ishfan. Every dish was bang on. I just felt disappointed about the Servicing so, it is 6.5/10

As it was sunday and 1:00 pm in the afternoon, its a perfect ambiance to grab a plate of biriyani for lunch. It is one of the Calcutta's top biryani's hotspot. This place always fulfills my cravings for biriyani in a promising manner. We ordered for Chicken Tengri Kebab, Mutton Biriyani, Salad, Firni (the main thing that I drool over here) and last but not the least Cold drinks. The foods were delicious. It was simply finger licking good. It's a must visit place for biriyani lovers. Services were up to the mark. Over all an amazing place to have delicious biriyani.

The Mutton pieces were well cooked and the aroma of the food was mind boggling 👍👍👍
We have tried more than 4 times here, and the quality and quantity remain same.

The brand has come a long way the 1st chain was southern Aminia then a flow I remember going there having a plate of biryani chicken or mutton in its flag ship restaurant in new market the rajharhat one is now close to home a alternate of taste between Aminia or Arsalan is a battle of wits never can decide so the coin toss is which is less crowded. Its light than others in the market portion has gone down in size since I had, gets very busy in weekend so be prepared for a long waiting

A relatively new outlet in the Chinar Park area but which is extremely busy notwithstanding the stiff competition from another big player in the business, Arsalan, just metres away... We went there on a Wednesday evening with a pretty large group of around 20 people and found the main restaurant was full... However they have an extension at the top in form of a banquet hall with huge tables keeping in mind large groups... Relatively less disturbed dining experience and that too at no extra cost was a huge plus... 
Coming to food, being one of the oldest players in the business, their Biriyanis, Kababs are just about quintessential... Try hard you may but you would not have much room to complain either quality or quantity wise... Add to that the dishes are not exorbitantly priced either... All in all, a great place to dine in a large group...

Something went wrong with them.
It was not my first visit. 
I visited there several times before but this time the food was not upto the mark
Ordered- 
Mutton Awadhi Biriyani 
Chicken Tikka Kebabs 
Chicken Roast
Garlic Naan 
Firni.
The only good thing was Firni.
The biriyani had too much spices for our taste. 
Kebabs lacked the juciness.
Garlic naans were dry and hard.
Chicken Roast was the worst of the lot. The quantity was lesser and it didn't sooth our taste bud, once again too much spices.
It may be was lighter on the pocket but the food was so not good.

Located conveniently on the Biswa bangla sarani at Chinar Park, Aminia stands tall among a lot of food joints here n there, good food, fast service in traditional Aminia way makes this place worth visiting again and again, I like the Biryani and chap here and it is a consistent taste throughout the outlets in the city, the Chinar park outlet is no exception. The quality of kebabs are also good, the phirni a must-try.

Quite a nice place to have tasty affordable biryani. Cheese kabab is one of the best to try besides biryani. Rolls and chicken roasts are worth trying. There's no compromise on taste. Enjoy 👍

A relatively new outlet in the Chinar Park area but which is extremely busy notwithstanding the stiff competition from another big player in the business, Arsalan, just metres away... We went there on a Wednesday evening with a pretty large group of around 20 people and found the main restaurant was full... However they have an extension at the top in form of a banquet hall with huge tables keeping in mind large groups...

We took biriyani 
Frankly didn't like it
Then we took firni , that was good
And most important is price

In a city that arguably serves the best biriyani in the country, aminia falls short of its peers. This outlet has an enviable ambience though. But the biriyani isn't so good. And the service isn't that amicable either. Waiters who walk like they are pioneers of biriyani in town. That belief is misplaced.

It is very great restaurant to taste the mughlai cuisine. I have been there several times, the meal is never failed me. It has always great taste. We had always different dishes. 
The best dishes that I love are chicken tikka, dal tadka, butter chicken masala and the mutton biryani. 
The service is very corteous and quick. I love to see when they carried the 3-4 plates full of biryani rice. That was awesome.

When its comes to Biryani, I prefer Aminia over any other restaurant in Kolkata. I have visited there with my friends for a dinner and needless to mention that it was a superb party without making holes in your pocket.
We ordered chicken starters and mutton biryani, which was served on the table at a reasonable time.  Will not say that the ambiance is for Date but definitely for a hang-out with friends. 
Staffs are really polite and the location is good,  atleast you do not have to hustle to get the location.

One of the repeat destinations for this biriyani hogging non resident Bengali, starving off the unavailability of that aroma of kolkata biriyani.
Add to that the heavenly taste of cheese kebabs that makes you wonder what life is without food and why did you even leave this place.
Aminia is one of those places that makes the duration between each visit to kolkata feel like eternity.

When it comes to biriyani,Aminia is mostly considered as a choice if u r a biriyani lover.
We went to this place for dinner. Decor was nice and good Ambiance. Comfortable seating arrangements and prompt staffs.we Have ordered chicken cheese kebab,mutton biriyani, chicken chap,coke,firni.
Kebab was soft and juicy and covered with melted cheese and parsley. It was awesome.
Mutton biryani was simply yummy.. which comes with a piece of mutton, an egg along with everyone's fav aloo..
Chicken chap was good as well..
In dessert must try the firni.  It was creamy and delicious..
Pocket pinch is a l'll high but Always a pleasure to visit..

I know the brand name Aminia since my childhood days. Now they have expanded like anything, but quality has downgraded like anything. The worst experience is when you order for take way. Today ordered for Chicken Biryani for takaway and repeatedly asked for providing good pieces and they ensured they will do. But the when unpacked the chicken piece I saw was hardly recognisable as it was a tiny one. DON'T CHEAT PEOPLE LIKE THIS. THE FAME YOU'VE ACHIEVED IN YEARS WILL VANISH IN FEW MONTHS.

Have heard abt this place and seen the restaurant. Today was the dAy . 
Ordered - kakori - galoti kababs and chicken dum biryani . 
Kabaas are delicious and soft as butter . 
Biryani as disappointing , chicken dose not  have any flavour or taste .

Update (27/07/2017) .. i am amazed to observe how pathetic their service has become recently. Waited for 20 mins and nobody even bothered to take order after several  request !!!! ... Sorry but had to update review accordingly.

After Having Arsalan biryani on Chrismas, I decided to try Aminia too as it was near to my stay, New year eve and long queue so waited for a while, finally got the seat while this place has enough space inside for the normal evening.
Ordered a Biryani with raita and Chichen curry. Didn't disappointed after so much wait, amazing Aroma from Biryani made our day complete. Raita and Curry were also good.
Definitely, a placeAto visit for biryani lover in Kolkata.
Overall: 4/5

I am a big time Biryani lover but somehow got very disappointed with biryani from this outlet. I visited this place along with my relatives and had impression of having an awesome experience while having Biryani from here. Somehow, the overall experience was so bad that me and my friend would never try again from here. There is no taste in the Biryani and it is over priced. How come they are charging so much for giving such tasteless stuff. It was very disappointing and the staffs were so arrogant that they do hardly care as they have so many to serve around. No spice, plain and sweet potato inside biryani. The Mutton was so dry as there is nothing with biryani to make it eatable. The management must work on the taste and service quality.

Typically very poor service . No hospitality sense at all . Coming to the main point THE FOOD ... well you will go to AMINIA and pay for the food served to you stone cold where you will be battling with the fork, the  spoons to cut the meat almost forgetting that the one has come to enjoy the food and it's  taste  ..And if were to recall and tell you about taste IT HAD NO TASTE AT ALL . GOD!!!...And to top it all  MANAGEMENT ( VERY WEIRD AND UNFRIENDLY)WAS NOT EVEN APOLOGETIC . 

I HAVE A FREINDLY SUGGESTION 
WHY DON'T YOU SHUT YOUR RESTAURANT  ACTUALLY START SELLING FROZEN BIRYANI ( PRETTY NEW CONCEPT)
 NO ONE SHARES SUCH VALUABLE TIP FOR SUCH A THANDA BIRYANI  !

The ambience of the place is fine. Had ordered Paneer sabji which was passable. It had more than the required quantity of oil and it would have been better if the paneer was slightly fried before adding to the gravy. The tandoori roties, both atta and normal were good. The non-veg items may be good though.

Aminia is one of my favourite Mughlai chain of restaurants. We ordered for Tandoori chicken and tengri kebab for starters. Special Awadi mutton Biriyani to follow.
The tandoori chicken was one of the best I have ever had. The chicken was soft and tender with the perfect  mix of spices.
Tangri Kebab was also good but not as much as the former. 
Mutton Biriyani was also good.
We were so carried away with the tandoori chicken that we ordered for a second round. But this was way below the mark. The chicken was stiff and burnt. I am taking away 0.5 rating because of this.

I really love the ambience of this Aminia. Probably one of the spacious outlet. The food is as good as any other outlet but the price is a little bit higher here for most of the items.

A visit to Aminia implies "Biryani" 😎!
Here is the list:
• Mutton Biryani
• Chicken Tangri Kabab: It's good
• Nolen Gurer Ice cream: It tastes okay, I love the one at Cafe Ekante (Eco Park) more

The behavior of staffs compared to other Aminias is worth a  mention - it's better!

After a visit to EcoPark we decided to head towards Aminia for Lunch.We ordered the Chicken Awadhi Biryani  and Chicken Handi.The biryani asual was good and had 2 pieces of chicken,an egg and potato and the chicken handi had a lot of small soft pieces of chicken and tasted moderately good,wasn't anything great coming to the desserts we oredered the firni which was good.The only problem here was the very slow service,it took almost 20 minutes to serve the food and then anothet 10 minutes to get the cold drink.Such slow service is not expected from such a reputed restaurant and they should improve their service.

Having lived in Hyderabad for over 4 years, I didn't want to miss out trying the much fantasized Awadhi biryani of Kolkata. So one of the legendary places suggested was Aminia and decided to give it a try. They say it's on since 1929 and certainly looked like it (well as a tourist I was looking around). So as the waiter suggested, I ordered the mutton Awadhi biryani and it was out of the world. Amazingly flavourful and succulent. It is served on a plate with a serving enough for a person with a very good appetite. I had a good appetite and managed to finished 3/4 th of it. There is a big potato and an egg as well. The potato tasted good too as it carried the wonderful flavour of the biryani. For those like me who have had just Hyderabadi and Ambur biryani from the south, this is a delightful change. The meat is soft and tender too, though not as much as the Hyderabadi biryani. The service was epic too. The waiter was kind enough to give me 5 hundreds of change for an additional 500 rupee note, something hardly anyone obliges to these days. They don't serve any raita or curd or salan sort of with the biryani. It goes very well as is. I had to order a masala coke to add some moisture in my intake haha. Overall a delightful experience and a must go for a try out. There are other Aminia outlets too but I'm unsure if it is original and just as good. Do try it if your here in Kolkata.

Been there 2 times in this brunch. This is located in chinar park bus stoppage. This outlet has very nice ambience. First time when we visited we ordered chicken biriyani and last time I went to have "Double ka meetha" (one of the dessert which I loveeedd and has been longing for a long time but Aminia has not been making this dessert since last 2-3years). So instead, I ordered gajar ka halwa and firni. But It is my request to all the branches of Aminia that please atleast once in a year make "Double ka meetha" for dessert lovers like me

Expected much better from your end. Not just received the order late.. but the taste of the kathi rolls was horrible. There was excess salt in some rolls that we ordered. Also the person who took the order had no clue whats in stock? He rang back and told us to change the order. Reluctant to visit or order from Aminia unless these are taken care of.

Ate worst Biriyani ever. 
Requested waiter to provide me good mutton piece. 
But he didn't pay hid to my words. 
Chicken piece also good. Very dry chicken. 
Ordered handi keema which is very sweet. It was not going with Biriyani. 
When we couldn't get thru our food,  waiter told us that u wasted all thing. U should have tried egg Biriyani. I didn't want him to give suggestions rather than good service and food. My table number was 13. I am a Biriyani lover and it was Biriyani day today. So my wife gave me treat at aminia,  but it was a total mess.

We ordered Biriyanis , Chicken Reshmi Butter, Chicken Bharta, Raita, Firni. Food tasted good enough. But service was very slow although there was hardly any rush. They were almost reluctant to take orders. I ordered coke which they took forever to serve. And when it finally came, the coke tasted anything but normal. After telling the staff , they took it away n thankfully didn't charge for it.

Awadh biriyani was made of same rice but with extra mutton and egg. Rest nun and other chiken side dish was good but little bit oily... Rest all good. Keep it up..

Well its aminia the name describes its all. Visited many times since childhood, and it will continue. What makes me crazy about this particular place is the biryani. Ahhh heavenly. Specially mutton biryani is too good. Chicken cheese kebab is the must try in here and yes one unique dessert Mihidana with Rabdi, try it guys you can thank me latter.

Went their for lunch and got the seat easily. The ambiance is good. This chain serves such delicious north Indian food. The staff was really good and the were quick. We did not have to wait long for the food. It arrived on time. We ordered Mutton Kakori Kebab, Mutton Hyderabady Biriyani  and Murg Hyderabadi. The meal was heavenly.

A must visit place.

Well, had a bad experience with them. There is no doubt about the quality of food they serve. However, there food delivery procedure is far worse. We had planned for a small team lunch on Saturday in our office and ordered 6 biriyanis. Later we decide to add another biriyani. When we called in the next time, they said that for delivery options we won't be able to take any card payments or the 2000rs note and they will only accept 100rs currency and no paytm as well. In the end we had to cancel the whole order. Bad experience as a whole.

Regular items are very good. But season special dishes have always disappointed me. Last day I ordered winter special "Nalli nihari with Tai Lan". Its taste was horrible :(  I also tried "Hyderabadi Biryani", "Chicken Shawarma" earlier. But all were very bad in taste. I would like to suggest the team, learn to make dishes delicious before trying anything new. Thanks :)

Personal favourite outlet of Aminia. Located at Chinar Park. The ambience is great. We tried out this place while returning from a trip to Barasat. 
Had the chicken biryani.
There's nothing special I would have to say about the biryani served here.

I've ordered awadhi mutton biriyani and tandoori fish tikka at 6:30 PM. It was delivered around 8:30 PM though the estimated time was well before. The biriyani was dead cold and hence wasn't palatable... Fish tikka was good and tender, though cold. I used to be a fan of Aminia since my childhood. I was disappointed yesterday. Hope you will cope up to your goodwill. Thank you.

I've been to Aminia outlets a number of times and in this Chinar Park Outlet its for the 3rd time. It remains a bit crowded most of the times and therefore the ambience is average-ish. But anyway, their service is quite quick.

Coming to the food, Biriyanis are good here as we all know! The Awadhi Biriyani (both Mutton & Chicken) is perfect for two people to share. It contains two pieces of Mutton/Chicken, an egg, a potato and a few koftas. The Biriyani here doesn't feel dry and the Mutton/Chicken pieces in it are also perfectly cooked.

I'm a huge fan of kababs! The Tangri Kabab, Chicken Cheese Kabab & Mutton Galawti Kabab are a few in my list of favorites.

Among the gravy dishes, I like Murgh Hyderabadi.

If you haven't tried the food here yet, make sure you do next time - if you want to pamper the Foodie in you 😉 Happy Eating!

A great brand name for Mughlai cuisine and a delight for Kabab and Biriyani lovers alike is now a place that is harbouring people with questionable integrity as employees/delivery agents.
Ordered food last Tuesday worth Rs 1,445 from the Rajarhat outlet. I paid Rs 2,000 to the delivery agent. The delivery agent looked surprised at the high denomination and asked for exact change. I told him that at the time of placing order, I had told them that I would be paying the higher currency with 50 rupees change if required. 
He acted extremely surprised and asked me to call the same number. Interestingly, the person who received the call said that he will look into the matter, will call me back and disconnected the call. 
It was 2 pm and we were hungry. Not sure what to do, the delivery boy came up with a sudden solution. He produced 5, hundred (100)  rupee notes and told me that's all he has and all of that were his personal money and that's all he had. There was a shortfall of Rs 50 in the change. Though it was very frustrating, we let the matter end there and honoured the order.
However, suddenly it occurred to me that the 100 rupee notes the guy had given me were in perfect sequence except for one note that was missing in the middle. Immediately it was clear that in fact, the restaurant had given him six 100 rupee notes cause I had given them that option while placing the order and the delivery boy in all his stupidity took the note from the middle of the note sequence and smartly rode away with 55 bucks.
Its not a question of 55 bucks, its a matter of dis-reputation this person is bringing on Aminia. 
I  hope the management makes a note of this and takes some action. However, I am wondering when will I receive the call that the person on the other side had promised, so I am not sure if a bigger fish is involved.

Near Chinarpark,as always was crowded like anything on a Sunday evening. The Fierce competition of ARSALAN next door never seem to bother it's business anytime of the day.
Ok now back to Aminia, with a very majestic interior and the tasty smell when you step inside the restuarant seems to make the rats runs more inside your tummy.
I know the place is famous for biryani ,hence that was out of the order list as we know biryani is good.
We ordered Peas Polao ( my mom's suggestion), with Handy Chicken and Masala Kulcha as well as a simple Kulcha.
The 2 seater tables are a little congested,anyways the  order was fast and food was daam tasty.
The food was a little too oily but the handi chicken was awesome.
The masala Kulcha was very disappointing else everything was nice.
Overall a nice place for muglai food .

Visited here in the afternoon of a weekday...It was moderately crowded...Ordered Mutton Biriyani , Chicken Rezala ,Mutton Handi and Lahori Chicken.I must say staff service is quite nice and quantity is also good but the quality is a dissapointment , specially with the expectation it bears with its Brand name.Biriyani and Mutton Handi was average but Lahori chicken & Chicken Rezala were below average..I cudnt even finish the Fresh Lime Soda(too salty) ...Firni was the one thing i cherished eating.. Owing to the huge brand value that Aminia carries this one needs improvement to live up to the expectation..Anyways do have your own experiences of the place...

Very wretched hospitality. Takes like ever to deliver. We waited for 40 mins after placing the order just to be informed that they had "somehow" forgotten our request. Anyway, to err is human, so we decided to wait further. 15 minutes later when we queried regarding the waiting time to be expected, we were told quite arrogantly and I quote here "You should had ordered biriyani, if you wanted a fast service".

This review is solely for Aminia Rajarhat,chinar park branch. I have been to the main one in new market and quite frequent in Garia but needless to say this is the worst one. Tool much oil and dalda in everything. Also I have taken delivery more than 2-3 times here and everytime they have given a parcel which was not ordered.  There is a  staff members who just verifies parcels but I dont know how he misses it. I believe its not just a  isolated issue now, they purposely seem to push old/stale items in delivery orders. I dont recommend this to now to anyone, there is a brand new arsalan beside it,one can try from it.Or else go to the new market branch or Garia branch.

For Lunch we had Chicken Biryani. Good enough for a reputated brand like this.

At night we ordered Naan and Chicken Bharta and Chicken Tikka Masala. Food wasn't good enough. Too much oil floating about the food.

Was at vedic village attending a birthday party and we decided to order biryani from here for lunch. I had the chicken biryani. The quantity was good,more than enough for one person. I had got a decent sized leg piece of chicken which was soft and tasty,wasn't difficult to pull off from the bone. The only problem with the biryani was the potato. The potato of a biryani is a very important element of the dish!! The potato given with the biryani was overcooked on the outside making it into mash easily while the inner part of the potato remained totally undercooked. Apart from this,the biryani was quite yummy :-) Looking forward to visit the restaurant in person.

This review is based on a home delivery order and not a sit and dine experience. Hence won't be able to comment on the service, decor,etc.

We were at Vedic Village for a friend's birthday party and ordered Mutton Biriyani, Tangri Kebabs, Chicken Bharta, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Butter naan and Jeera Rice. 

Biriyani tasted good. The large mutton piece was tender and juicy. Only disappointment was the big overcooked piece of potato. Generally we love the aloo in our biriyani and it's quite sad if we can't have that. Otherwise would have rated it 4.
However, the other friends got the potatoes perfectly cooked.

The Tangri kebab was finger licking. Jeera Rice was average. Chicken Bharta was good. Tikka Butter Masala was decent. Butter naan was good.

Recommended!

So planning to visit here soon for updating my review by adding the information of above things. Well I'm attending a birthday party at vedic village where I tried there veg biryani it was heavenly delicious and tastes amazing. Perfectly made biryani with true taste of mughlai cuisine and with lots of veggies, soyabin and paneer. Price was totally reasonable. Highly recommended for biryani. Loved it.

We have visited the Aminia at Chinar Park for around 4-5 times, and for atleast 3 out of those had terrible experiences with service. Yesterday being the latest when we ordered for special biryani but to find no potatoes served with it. We promptly complained since potato is a major constituent of Kolkata biriyanis. To our horror we were told there is no potato available in the market. When we asked why it was not informed earlier, we were told actually all potatoes were finished (already changed reason), and then when we threatened to send back the order, one of the senior servers attended us and promptly brought a potato. The entire incident left a bad impression, especially with the servers lousy attempt to cover up with lies which looked like a simple miss. In earlier occasions we had faced issues with wrong bills as well. So not looking forward to visit again, atleast the Rajarhat outlet.

Food :
Mutton biryani - soft n juicy mutton piece with one big potato made the biryani superb. Great flavour.
Mutton boti kabab - 6 small pcs. Another delicious item perfectly cooked. Served with mint chutney.
Tangri butter masala - 4 pcs of chicken tangri kabab in butter masala. Did not go well with biryani but taste wise it's a decent dish.

This restaurant is located at the chinar park stoppage at Rajarhat and is prominently visible with it's familiar take away and roll counter on the outside . The interiors are neatly decorated with warm lighting and a combination of  sofas and chairs for seats. The staff here are courteous and the service is quick . We ordered a quick lunch of butter naan and chicken bharta on a busy Friday afternoon , as the garlic naan which happens to be a favourite would take more time . The chicken bharta had juicy pieces of shredded chicken with a light gravy base , and tasted very good with the butter naan , each of which was big enough for one to feel full. The prices here are extremely pocket friendly, and the popular choice remained the chicken biryani , which needs no reason to be consumed , even on a busy weekday afternoon ! Would definitely love to visit this place again!

It's a big restaurant at Chinar park which is over crowded during the weekends. The restaurant is known for its biriyani and chicken butter masala or try the mutton rogan josh. The other items on the menu are quite good as well. The ambiance is good compared to its original one at New Market. The chicken achari kabab is one item you must try along with Galouti kebab.  The rolls sold at roll counter are very tasteful as well. Th decor is good and the sitting capacity is huge.

Was amused to see Aminia at Chinar Park. So we promptly dropped in and managed to grab a table too. There is nothing special about the menu. Every damn dish was familiar. So we had ordered mutton biriyani and chicken chap. Price is at par with the quality and quantity. Though the size of the chap was relatively smaller than the standard size offered/served at Arsalan normally. Service wasn't that great. Sadly this place doesn't even provide finger bowl. So you need to stand in a queue near the wash basin. It was annoying. Ambience was okay. But the servers needs to be little professional at least. Cheers.

They serve some Good Bengali style Biryani n good non-veg food. The place is not very spacious but the taste of the food served compensate this. Non-veg eaters must try this with friends or family.

This is not a review, it's a tribute to the great 'Aminia' for serving us the best of biriyani, mughal/mughlai cuisines.. I am a very very big fan of aminia, so mind u, ill be completely biased(though the biasness came just becoz of the awesome food). This place serve the best biriyani in kolkata(period) No more words. I am in love with this place.. The galauti kebabs, the dishes each one simply gives u a very very good night sleep..not much to say, awesome place, awesome food, awesome interiors, average pricing.. Have a visit soon.

Aminia never disappoints. Yummy and tasty food. Be it the kebabs or the main course. Chicken bharta, butter masala, kadhai chicken. All r great. 
Be it the biryani. Same taste. Nothing much to write.

Very bad in serving customers. So many conditions they put, like you can't seat in the seat of four if you are two people. I had to personally requested to the manager then got the seat where lots of vacant seats were available then. Also the Biriyani they served was very poor in taste and the aloo was half cooked for both of the plates we have ordered.

Can't believe that the attitude of the staff managing the orders for the takeaway outlet... being in a hurry to reach the airport, I requested our taxi to take us to this overrated outlet for Kathi roll..
We saw about 10-12 persons enjoying their rolls & a couple receiving theirs in front of us.. we ordered a chicken Kathi & double Mutton Kathi. Staff refuses to take order & says we must be willing to wait at least 25 mins as they have now started a huge packing order.. despite much requests the guy is adamant & being farcical goes to the cook operating the tawa who simply shrugs.. comes back to say sorry..
Was it just because we looked & are proud Punjabis? Anyways we walked off & decided to enjoy beer & roast lamb at the Airport.. so much for Kolkata hospitality or Kathi rolls... proud of Nizams Kathi Rolls in Delhi

Awesome Kolkata biryani after many many years... reminded me of my childhood days. Personally went there for a take away from Rajarhat centre as they don't deliver here in Salt Lake... no complains... order was promptly taken and all items were made ready within 20 mins... thumbs up for packaging and quality of the food. Quantity is more than sufficient if you don't have a big appetite, i guess Awadhi biryani's are bigger in portion as 2 of us had to finish 1. Do try the kebabs... Chicken achari kebab was mouth watering. Be prepared to queue up if you want to dine-in on weekends.

Disappointment! That's how I would like to describe my visit here. Aminia, after all, is part 
of nostalgia. 

              The decor and ambience of this outlet is good. However, the problem is with food and service. Food 
did not impress me. Biriyani is just so so. Ordeded handi chicken which turned out to be too spicy and 
oily.  Tandoor and Kebabs  were okay. 

             I find the attitude of the service staff to be too casual and lacking sense of courtesy.

Dinner at aminia was rather disappointing mainly due to the pathetic service provided by the staff members. They were not at all bothered about the guests demands and needs. Every staff members were busy among themselves. They didn't even took the pain to serve the food items to us. Food was good to taste. But the service was a real deal breaker over here.

Aminia,, a reigning name in the arena of mughlai cuisine has failed to satiate my tastebuds in accordance to my mounting expectations... had parcelled their CHICKEN BIRIYANI AND CHICKEN RESHMI BUTTER MASALA.. the rice was golden,,flavourful.. but the chicken in it literally brought tears in my eyes... it was stale,, smelly as if refrigerated and boxed after heating.. the reshmi butter masala was a sheer delish with juicy chicken cubes wafting in rich white gravy... the only turn off for me in this preperation was at times some of the pieces were too huge to my liking as it prevents spices to intrude.. It would be better if they increase the number of kababs in a plate making them relatively smaller in size... besides I praise them who had done such a commendable packing not allowing a single drop of the gravy  spill outside... overall I had a good experience..

As I am new to kolkata and quite foody too. I keep on trying new food outlets and also the places carrying strong word of mouth. Today I had a visit to this place..so called ...a great place for having Biryani. My purpose was to judge the place for kind of Biryanis , the outlet serves. I ordered chicken as well as Mutton Biryani both. The moment , I got the chicken Biryani , I could easily figured out the potato whose base was totally burnt( full charcoal). I was surprised , how come their staff overlooked the same while I could able to notice without toching the plate. Although, I told the person to remove the plate , he argued with me and was trying to pursue to exchange the potato in the plate which could easily gave me the sense that the Biryani was not at all a Dum Biryani. Later, I got my Mutton Biryani too. I was surprised to see these Biryanis and started looking around on other table to understand whether I was being given such shocking treatment. Soon I could realise that I am not exceptional as other tables have also been offered similar kind of Biryanis. It is really shocking to see that how come kolkata people has given so much of word of mouth to Aminia for such pathetic Biryanis. It is the worst Biryani , I ever had in my life. The Biryanis rice has got two color, yellow and white ,soaked in Dalda and there was not even a dash of pure ghee in the dish.
It was quite oily and rice was having two flavor, one 
for too.much salt and other garam Masala to cover up the goof ups. The mutton was boiled with salt and garam Masala and used as a separate cooked part. There was no raita, no sidings to supplement the biryani and it is overpriced at Rs.175/-. 
I think , kolkata people must resist their taste and come out of these legacy taste of bad Biryanis.. ...plz do avoid ...it is sheer waste of money..guys. There is no point in wasting hard earned money on such useless food corners.

The only word that suits this place is "pathetic". The behaviour of the staff was horrible from the moment we stepped into the place. They were least interested in taking the order. After we did manage to place the order it was again an eternal wait before the waiter came us and told they just ran out of galawati kebab ( surprisingly it took him 30 minutes to realise that). We did order something instead but that appetiser came when we were almost done with our main course. And to top all of this, at the end we even discovered a dead fly in the Lahori chicken. When we called the waiter to show him that, he said he said it's not a big deal and it was unintentional (thank god he clarified that). Though later when we talked to the manager he said we don't have to pay for the lahori chicken, but of course that wasn't our concern and even though he apologised it wasn't enough to soothe the extremely bitter experience.

Good, consistent biryani, which can be hard to get that far from Park Circus. Staff is more professional and the food's better than the Arsalan next door. Good rolls. The mutton pasinda that all of the Aminias are known for is, predictably, delicious. And *fantastic* haleem.

Well if it's Kolkatta it has to be biryani @ Aminia. Just walk by and the entire area and road is smelling of the lovely food that you can't resist yourself, you get tempted to have a taste of it. Well Aminia serves the best Biryani in Kolkatta by far. The long rice is evenly cooked, less in fact no masala like all biryani's do have. Sucullent meat be it mutton or chicken.umm goes well with a glass of chilled coke and ends well with a mouth watering firni.

Aminia at rajarhat has probably the best biriyani out of the current lot of restaurants in this part of the city. Arsalan's quality has gone down, and the others are not worth mentioning. I have always taken delivery from this outlet, and most of the time the food has reached me hot. At times, though they have taken their sweet time to deliver. The biriyani is great as expected, with the kebabs very good as well.

A place known for it's heritage. They often say, "when we used cross the Aminia at New Market, the aroma of the amazing biriyani pulled us in."
This place, being a newly opened branch, has kept up to the standards. Their food is really well made and served. Though the serving time is a bit high and takes a while but as a whole, it satisfies you.

Should give it a try, you won't be disappointed.

This is my favourite biriyani joint. This place is known for its biriyani which is delicious and would titillate your taste buds and leave you wanting for more. So we didnt stop at biriyani and went on to order chicken tandoori which again was beautifully cooked. Food has right amount of spices that balance each other out leaving your mouth filled with longlasting taste. Biriyani is cooked pretty light without added stuffs that undermine the true taste of biriyani which is why this place is my favourite biriyani joint.

The location is quiet convenient. And the cost doesnt bore a hole in the pocket. For all the mughlai food lovers, Aminia is the place for you.

So I ordered at 21.10 hrs and it was a basic order. When ordering, the option showed that the time of delivery would be 60 mins. I was ok to wait until then. However in order to check if they can expedite, i wanted to call them again and explore the opportunity.

When I called on the given number after 30 mins of placing the order (2140 hrs), the person took my details and mentioned that he shall call me in 5 mins after checking.!! I had to call again at 2210 hrs to check what's happening with the order. Without any second thoughts, he told me to call an alternate number.

At 2210 hrs, when I called the alternate number and reconfirmed about my order, to my surprise he mentioned that he hasn't received any order.!!! And will take down the order now and ensure that it gets delivered by 2245 hrs at most...

It's 2310 hrs - 2 hours after I ordered. When I called again, he said it'll take 15 more mins since it's busy..!!!????

Who says like that??? I contacted Zomato to check and assist... But even Zomato couldn't get in touch with Aminia...

Extremely bad experience. Such a big chain but cannot keep a basic promise OR cannot communicate properly...

Never ordering via them again ever...

This was my 1st visit to Chinar Park branch of Aminia..Over all I must give them 4/5.

Ambiance: Good.Seating arena is quite large.
Service: Stuffs are very good  and service is prompt.
Food:  Mutton Awadhi  Biriyani is too good.It's very light but taste is unbelievable .Perfect combination of                      flavor and taste,not at all oily.Mutton pieces will melt in your mouth.Chiken Awadhi  Biriyani is very                     good as well. Biriyani of here will compel you come here again and again.Another thing you must                       taste here, i.e.  Fish Tandoor Tikka. This is  mouth watering.
Cleanliness: Some improvement can be done in this area.

If you are a food lover..You must visit this place... :)

Had been to this outlet twice!
Visit 1: In the year 2014 when i ws just a college goer.
Ordered biriyani and chicken butter masala.
There was a COCKROACH in the biriyani!!
Left the food and the manager never showed up.

Visit 2: in the year 2016 when i went there for a team lunch with a group of 15 people.
Served a COCKROACH in gravy.
Left the food without paying as the manager dare not challenge a group of 15!

Over the years, time changed but their standars didn't.
Kudos to aminia.

Worst service. I ordered paratha and keema. Paratha was served cold. Further, it was clearly understood that paratha was prepared many hours ago. I called the waiter and requested him to replace it with nan but he refused. Then manager came and he also refrained from replacement. It was worst experience. They denied from replacing paratha of merely Rs 25. So you can understand the mentality of the people running the restro. So if u want to eat paratha please look for some other restro unless u r accustomed of eating cold parathas.

Once known as the face of Kolkata Biryani, this restaurant chain is now struggling with its competitors to survive.  The quality of the biryani degraded and it became just another mughlai restaurant.
On top of that, the waiters in this particular facility are quite novice and service in not at all up to the mark.

Menu- Chicken Biriyani
Place- Aminia (Chinar Park ,Atghara , Rajarhat)
Pocket Pinch- Rs. 434.00 (Including Service Tax 6.0% and Vat 14.5% on 2 plate Chicken Biriyani costing Rs.180 each).
Isn't the name of Aminia and the food ordered enough?Do I need to say more?
One of the best Chicken Biriyani is offered over here in Kolkata.The food was served within 30 min of being ordered. The aroma of the dish filled the place as soon as it was brought. The dish tasted equally great as it smelled and appeared. The quality as well as quantity was good. The quantity was enough for a single adult.The chicken and the rice was cooked properly.
I along with my friend had a delicious lunch that afternoon.
Surely I will come back again to have some other items from the list.

Aminia is one of the oldest biriyani hubs in kolkata. This fairly new branch in chinar park is as good as the old aminia. The place has a large seating arena.The service is quite good and fast.The food is served hot. The biriyani is out of the world. It is not at oily and greasy but is full of the rich flavours. The chicken handi is a must try. It has pieces of shredded chicken in a rich white gravy. 
We have done home delivery quite a number of times and every time the food delivered was warm and tasty with no problems at all. This place is a must recommendation for all the biriyani lovers.:)

This one located at Rajarhat is huge when it comes to space. The decor is kept simple with combination of white and purple. The service... prompt and efficient. I had gone for lunch and ordered the signature chicken chaap and special biryani since we were two people. The chaap was good but I found the special biryani a bit too soggy and not cooked properly. Other times we go to either try out their rolls or pack biryani and chaap. The mutton roll here is really nice and can be eaten often. The billing and the delivery counter outside has made it easy for customers who are on the drive and are in a hurry.

Very pathetic service. The restaurant is just 5 minutes driving distance and still after 2.5 hours the food not reached.  Upon calling the executive bluffs the the food is on the way, while the delivery boy is at the restaurant. The same is for food. I ordered Biryani and after 2.5 hours it got delivered and it was cold. The Raita was also pathetic. I won't ever try for Aminia any more. If there was 0 rating I would have been try for that.

If you are a biryani lover then you either must have visited this place or are planning to. Aminia offers a classic Kolkata style biryani. You definitely need to taste the biryani here if you haven't till now!

worse, disgusting, and they do not maintain the minimum decency as well.Food ordered never came on time, was late by an hour.Naturally, they were almost stone cold.we managed them to get them heated, but still tasted disgusting, with all spices being plummed into the dishes simultaneouslyChicken smelled of god knows what and as a result, 7 out of 9 people felt sickno idea regarding the take away or the live roll centre, but takeaway is miserable

Prime Location, near Chinar Park more. This Aminia is much better than the decade old Aminia located in New market area. The ambiance and seating arrangement is nice. The restaurant mostly remain crowded.

We ordered Aminia special biriyani, Chicken handi and reshmi kabab. The biriyani tastes very nice much better than other Aminia outlets. 
You can surely give it a try.

Food tastes awesome as you always expect from Aminia. Since it is newly build and huge so, the ambiance is also nice and perfect for dine with family & friends. From juicy kebabs to biriyani every mughlai cuisine was mouth watering.

Only issue I faced is that service is too slow and you have to ask waiters several times for everything.

This is my 2nd visit to the Rajarhat outlet, and the experience was good. Chicken Tandoori, Mutton Biriyani, Aminia Special Naan and Mutton Handi were in our wish list. Taste was good. However, They served the mains with the starter which we did not like, so just remind the waiters to serve the starters before.

This eatery is a new outlet of Aminia, and has earned a good name for itself within this short span of time. 

We dropped in for lunch, and we ordered for Chicken Special Biriyani along with Fresh Lime Soda to wash it down.

The Biriyani was beyond perfect! The spices were aptly infused with the flavours; the rice was aromatic and tender; while the chicken was succulent and juicy. The potato along with the Biriyani was as soft as butter and the egg was fried to perfection. We strongly recommend this place for Biriyanis.

The fresh lime soda was good, too.

Food is ok but delivery system is total messup. I ordered mutton biryani at around 9pm and the order taking guy on phone tells me that it'll take maximum of 1.5 hours to deliver. Order arrives at 11pm and they have brought chicken biryani instead of mutton. Called up the order guy, he says might be a mistake and will check and inform me. Even after 10minutes no response, I called him up and he says that I ordered chicken biryani only. When I asked him to play the recording, he disconnets the call and doesn't even pick up the call of the delivery guy. Exhausted and hungry at that time of the night, I had to take the wrong order only. 
And this is not the first wrong delivery case from Aminia.

We visited it 9th August for celebrating my birthday with my friends.  First of all the place is well decorated one and enough big.  And the services are prompt too.  We ordered tandoori chicken full for starter.  It is amazing and we'll cooked.  Then for main course we ordered special mutton biriyani and chicken biriyani.  Muttons are soft and we'll cooked.  Special one is enough for two people.  And chicken biriyani is also good with large piece of chicken. 
 For desert we ordered one coke one firni one koolfy and one chocolate ice cream.  Firni is one of the best I ever had.  It is amazing.  Chocolate ice cream was also good.  But I am little disappointed with koolfy as for me it was little under quality  
And we need to pay 1334 over all. 

Over all I am happy with my experience.  And I must visit it again.

We went there for a friend's get together. But were too much disappointed. There nothing wrong with the place. The ambience is good. But the service was so bad that we had to ask for a single thing e.g a simple spoon, twice or thrice. Even the Biriyani was not like other branches of the same chain. Don't know whether this was the condition for that day only or not, but we are not going to this outlet once again :(

Well! I prefer Aminia not only because of their biriyani, but also quality time with my family. We are a regular customer of Aminia Rajarhat. Because of the food quality and quantity, they are much better than Dharmatala Aminia. Firni is awesome.. but the quantity is little. One must taste chicken tanduri butter masala with their special biriyani,it is awesome.

Had the mutton gulawti kebabs, with butter naan and phirni. The kebabs were a bit too spicy for my liking, but I guess that is the way they should be made (I don't exactly dig spicy food, so can't blame the restaurant), but phirni was pretty great... we even ordered a second helping! This place is both affordable and impressive. Keep up the good work!

They also have chicken spl biriyani but this is the same normal biriyani, only diffetence 1 more piece of chicken and rice quantity is more. Overall good restrurent .

One of the more popular mughlai restaurants in the city. I've eaten out of a lot of Aminias and I kind of feel this is the best out of what I've tried. We had taken home (I mean office) delivery orders earlier from this place and we're impressed by the quality of the Biryani, because delivery biryani always sucks even from the mighty Arsalan. So this time we went to the restaurant on a lunch-out. The seating capacity is large, to say the least and also it's quite cozy. We ordered a mix of the Hyderabadi mutton biryani and normal mutton/chicken biryani along with mutton handi. The Hyderabadi biryani was well different and not much to my taste. So after finishing that I ordered a normal mutton biryani for myself, it was pretty good.
Only had a chance to visit once, would love to explore more.

My experience in Aminia was good until now. I went to this restaurant and ordered a Chicken Handi and some breads and starter. When the order came they gave me chicken Bharta. I asked the waiter that it is Chickem Bharta, He said that this is special Chicken handi in Amini. Will definitely not suggest this particular restaurant to any of my friends.

Mughlai food has always been of a rich standard in kolkata. And aminia is one of the names that carries on the legacy. Well, this branch at rajarhat is situated on the main road itself. The inner ambience is cool and service is quite good even on a busy day. The mutton special biriyani- gives a heavenly combo of tender mutton and a succulent potato. Lahori chicken is a must try. The rotis and parathas are so well made melts in mouth. A good meal at aminia must end with firni and they do make it quite tasty. I must say a good competitor to arsalan situated next to it. Will be visiting again and again.

Not packed order. The boxes got open. Tikka and bharta gravy fell down in plastic. Chicken biriyani pieces were small but biriyani quantity was sufficient. Tasty was so so. But chickrn tikka masala and chicken bharta was awesome

Another day we went and parcelled it carefully and brought ourselves. That day we ordered chicken biriyani , chicken bharta and mutton kasha.
All were super fresh and excellent.

Wanted to try this place after seeing the better ratings when compared with Arsalan of the same area... took my parents for lunch as we were close by for some work. Liked the seating arrangement, but overall feeling was not that cosy. The staff will was not that courteous also. Bit noisy and not as mannered as Arsalan. Food was good. We ordered the special Awadhi mutton Biriani, chicken tikka kabab, chicken kadai and tandoori rotis... mutton pieces were succulent and really tender. The biriyani was excellent. Rest were just so so. At the end, the billing was in a quandary over broken computer server and eventually we got delayed a lot. All in all, I would prefer Arsalan at Park Circus, over anything Mughlai at Rajarhat. But. If the cravings are hard to satiate, try the Arsalan at Rajarhat rather than Aminia.

A long drive from the maim city but worth going and eating.
The place has good big mutton tikkias. Its tasty and quite filling. As always the biryani is pretty good and filling. 
One thing is a must try that is their brilliant rolls. Their mutton egg cheese roll is amazing. The cheese melts away when added to the roll on the hot tawa. As u bite into the different layers it will take you to a different world. First the crunchy paratha then the softness off the egg, following it the tenger juicy mutton topped with melting cheese. It is sure to blow you off your feet.

Aminia, Rajarhat New Town, seems to be the landmark of the Chinar Park area off late. Being a very popular Indian restaurant in that area, we decided to visit the place on the last Friday for lunch. The interiors looked spacious and neat, well illuminated and ACs were comfortable. 
Coming to the food, we ordered Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Handi and Onion Salad. The Biriyani was brilliant with the perfect blend of richness and aroma. The potato was super tasty which is one of my significant parameters for judging Kolkata style Biriyani. The mutton was succulent too. The Chicken Handi was also okayish however nothing extra-ordinary. 
The service was very fast and we could finish the total lunch within half an hour. Also, the food served were all hot and was a plus. Overall, a good experience.

N.B. The pocket pinch was low as 2 Mutton Biriyani, 1 Chicken Biriyani, 1 Chicken Handi and 1 Onion Salad costed INR 850 only.

I wish there was the option of '0' rating because this place truly deserves that.

Food was supposed to be delivered at 9:40pm and it is 11:30pm and I am still waiting for it. To add to that, the management of the hotel is so utterly horrible that they cannot share the correct information on when the food was dispatched and how to contact the delivery boy. And sometimes they will just ignore your call/ hang up in mid-conversation

Order through Zomato is horrible and it is the most unreliable place when it comes to timing.

Regarding the food, no idea because it is yet to be delivered (or may not as well). WORST PLACE TO ORDER.

Well nice place for a date if you both are foodies..... food is pretty good. But i personally didn't like their briyani. I mean i am a huge fan of briyani but i didn't like the briyani. I ordered special chicken briyani along with seekh kebab and chicken reshmi butter masala. I loved chicken reshmi butter masala and seekh kebab was was just amazing. But i would say not a best place to have briyani. Because your tastebuds won't love it.

This restaurant Aminia is the worst nightmare one can have. We went there for team lunch around 15 people. We ordered Chicken Biriyani, Mutton Biriyani, Tandoor chicken, Onion salad and Chicken chaap. We felt the chicken chaap was like sadak chap. There was water dripping from the A/C over our head. When we complained, they gave rude reply that either you sit there or the A/C will be switched off. It felt as if it was a complimentary drink or something, the water from the A/C. The waiters were very rude and were wearing dresses on which was written "captain". God knows what kind of captain they were. May be captain of rudeness.Overall, I advice one and all not to visit this restaurant since the behavior of the staff is so bad, felt as if they are paying us and feeding us... If you don't want to make your "dimag ka dahi", then strictly stay away from this crap. The food is also nothing special. I would never ever visit this useless restaurant again

Aminia somehow does not disappoint  me ever. I love the food, especially the kebabs. They are down right perfect. 
This most probably is the second biggest establishment of the brand in the city.  I love the whole look of this place, the checkered floor, the posher diner style seating and especially the pavement outside.

Coming to my favorites, I am absolutely in love with every single kebab on the menu. They are fresh, moist with juices running clear, the coating is silky and the whole thing just melts in your mouth. One moment its there and the very next second poof. My other favorite items on the menu are the awadhi chicken/mutton biriyani and the mutton handi. Must try for all.

Food has been good. But my recent experience is if you order from zomato and you have already paid for it online or through card through zomato they might deliver the food after 2 hrs. Cold food and after 12 o clock in the night. Though on zomato the delivery time was 11:12 pm. Interesting experience. Best to go for cash on delivery if taking chances. Had similar experience Rang De Basanti Dhaba.

This is quite a huge place in new town. I love the Biriyani of Aminia. The food was excellent. I have no complaints about the food. The service was good too. Overall Aminia has maintained it's standard over the years and the quality has not dropped at all....

Back in 90's if you have been to New Market in Central Calcutta & happen to walk past Aminia, it was impossible to walk pass without a "guilt" - "Why are we not going in?".  The aroma of Biryani simply overpowers you. 

Over the years Aminia has opened many other branches - like the one in Rajarhat. Today also any of the Aminia branches are great & will not disappoint you if you want to have a great Mughlai dinner.

Biryani is good! At such low price what they offer is unbelievable, no doubt the crowd that lingers on weekend nights is huge. With waiting time of 45 min to 1 hour sometimes. Reshmi Kabab is worth trying! Overall a great value for money restaurant!

I was having this craving for biriyani since a long time and finally we decided to head towards our very old aminia. It is located at the rajarhat area.. near to haldirams-cc2 auto stand.
After a long queue v finally got a chance to enter the place. The ambiance was nicely set . Luckily v got a seat n the couch. 
We ordered kebabs , biriyani and chicken varta.  The food tasted good but I think the kebabs could have been better. A bit more soft . The biriyani was just up to the mark.. A bit more better with the taste was expected.
About the service it was usual. But yes it is very much pocket-friendly.

Heritage Biryani with a modern outlet. 

i ordered from this place for a lunch organized at my office for about 20 people. Well I ordered on the previous day and had to follow up more than 5 times on the date of delivery. They were suppose to deliver at 12:30, the food finally arrived at 1.15. 

Coming to the food. We ordered awadi mutton biryani, awadi chicken biryani, chicken reshmi butter masala, masala kulcha, peas pulao and paneer dopeyaza. Aminis awadi biryani is just plain delicious, a lot better than their plain biryani. The spices are different and definitely much much better. It came with 2 pieces of chicken/mutton, a big and well cooked potato, an egg and garnished with meat balls. The reshmi butter masala had 6 big, juicy pieces of chicken(reshmi kabab) in white gravy. It was apt for the biryani. The pulao was good and had lots of dry fruits. Even the paneer and kulcha were brilliant. We had no complaints when it came to the food.

I hope they would improve on their level of professionalism and look into other aspects apart from the food. Wish them the very best !!

Awful experience. I was actually mesmerized by the food from aminia, new market area. But this branch is totally horrible. Yesterday, we ordered food on bulk as we had guests in our home. They delivered after 1 and half hrs, that too after calling them 2times. We ordered mutton galoti kebab... but that was not delivered, instead they delivered some chicken kebab. Chicken tikka masala was not properly cooked.

The month of Ramadan is here and so are the delicacies! Wish all my friends a happy Ramzan!
This is one of my favourite times of the year, mainly because of the delicious haleem that's available exclusively during this month.
Aminia has a very good haleem to offer along with the Shahi Falooda which is a nutritious mixture of fruit bits, kulfi and Falooda topped with jelly!

This is a must try.

I went there today evening. Ordered lahori chicken with garlic naan. Food was tasty. But problem was with water. If your regular water filter/machine is not working you cannot ask customers to buy mineral water for this reason. When I said I wont pay for the mineral water you served me the regular water only and it was tasting very very bad(see the colour). The point is-If you cannot serve safe free drinking water then you are bound to serve the mineral water for free. Kindly dont take human health so lightly and make a serious note of this issue.

This one is the nearest Aminia from where I live, so I often come here whenever craving for good  Biriyani and/or that famous(& delicious) nolen gurer ice cream. This place looks same as the other Aminia joints, seating areas are organised pretty nicely although in weekends you might end up in long queue waiting 1 hour also to get inside😞.
Food is always good in Aminia, I have my favourites - green salad, tengdi kebab, chicken Biriyani and that mouth watering nolen gurer ice cream 😃😃
Coming over here pretty soon again!!

If  you are taking a 'take away' item, make sure  u order something where pieces r mentioned. Else they will give u something which won't be sufficient for even a single person. Like mutton tawa masala,  lahori murg etc. Quantity is not worth the money. They have started to cheat now.

The chicken roll they make here is one of the best in Kolkata. I have also tried the chicken biriyani. The best thing about the biriyani at Aminia is that in spite of being a very rich and spicy dish, it will never make you feel full or never make you burp, no matter how much you eat. The ambiance and behavior of the waiters was very nice.

The old school Brand..Aminia..it was my first visit to this newly opened branch..stand alone building on road property. No problem at all in finding out. Near Chinarpark crossing
Recently I had been to Aminia Biryani (New Town) to have some Biryani. As this place is very famous for serving Quality Biryani lots of people were waiting outside the joint. The security in entrance was writing visitors name and calling them serially. Me and my few friends ultimately after waiting few good minutes able to have a seat in the first floor. We gave an order and I must say the service is very bad. we had ordered some food and he served some other food that too he took close to 20 Min to get our order served.  The pieces of Mutton were not roasted properly and rice was completely overcooked. huge portions of Rice had been burned such a way that lots of black coloured rice were found in Mutton Biriyani. Mutton quality was not good at all. Ac was switched off. We 5 were SUFFOCATING. None came to pour water in empty glass too. I had to went to cash counter of the first floor to serve water and switched on the AC. Pathetic customer service. And for that beautiful hospitality and service we customers are paying service tax.Then the restaurant was not well maintained. Washroom was totally massacre. I would never visit again here. total waste of money. Such a waist of Brand and good ambience cum interior.

Yesterday, as I was sleeping over at a friend's place in Rajarhat, we decided to order food from Aminia. We were in the mood for some sizzling chicken butter masala, and what would've been better than Aminia?
We ended up ordering :
• Chicken reshmi butter masala - I loveeedd it! Creamy and tasty, the chicken pieces were tender and juicy. The flavour of cashews made it more delightful. 
• Chicken tikka butter masala - This dish was spicy and well, oily. It was equally well prepared but due to the spice quotient, I liked the former dish better. 
• Lachha paratha - lachha parathas from Aminia needs no introduction. 

Pocket pinch - 637 for four of us. Very reasonable and pocket friendly.

As we ordered stuff from there, I can't comment on the ambience or anything, but the service was prompt, and the person who took our order really heard us out. Okay, we had bugged him a lot regarding the quantity and price and lachha paratha. :P 
Over all quality food at a good rate!

After that question about their home delivery its good.. But they not overlook the cooking instruction. Recommended chiken biriyani., reshmi kebab, egg paneer roll. And must have a chiken rezala. And firni in dessert.

Pretty fast service as we were 12 person together and we didnot have to wait much for the food to arrive. A spacious area located at Chinar park area next To arsalan and Below Selfie Latte.
Coming to the food the reshmi kabab tasted marvellous ,touched my heart.We had ordered special mutton biriyani for ourselves.The Quantity is huge having 2 mutton pieces ,an egg,one stuffed potato but it seemed little dry.Hyderabadi biriyani was also good.
You can stop over here after a long drive on the em bypass and Gorge into biriyani.
Ambience may seem.little noisy as the place is congested but its way better than the other Aminia outlets in town..Theres a soothing music playing on background.

Note: My previous review got deleted automatically due to some issue so its a repost.

Date Of Visit : 05/03/2016

The Place and Loacation: Its very visible and near to Chinar Park crossing. Its always crowded Whether its weekend or weekday because of its name & quality. Aminia in Rajarhat has taken all the limelight and made it tough for the other players to run their food business in this area. Its Indian tandoor items needs no intro as we all know about it so well. This place is made of two floors, the ambiance is very nice and full of light. They maintain proper hygine and cleanliness whether serving food for dining or take away order. They have made different sections for Rolls and other Tanddoritems which is on the outer side and for dining the arrangement is inside. The staffs are actice enough and guide you properly till the table. Aminia in Rajarhat area is serving a good customer experience.

The Food : To be honest i have tried varities of items at this place but could not take pictures. Few days ago i had sudden craving for Roll so i went there and tried it. I only had Egg Chicken Roll.

1. Egg Chicken Roll : There are many places in city where you will find the clear awesomeness of roll and this place is one of those. The size of the roll, the quality of it and the quantity of chicken filled in it was great. The chicken pieces were so well marinated with various essential spices and the taste was very nice. The Paratha they made for roll was soft and it was having a juicy flavour which it should have. I didnt found Ghee on the paper which they use for wrapping the roll. The service time for providing  the item took very less time.. My Rating : 4/5

Overall Experience & Recommendation: Very few brands are there who maintain their quality, quantity as well as reasonable rate. Aminia is one of those brand which carried all these with it and gather good custromer satisfaction. I always felt myself satisfied on visiting any of the branches of Aminia. The type of taste and reasonability which the customers wants keeps them coming back and this is something they do. My Recommendation would be Chicken Reshmi Kabab and Mutton Biriyani.

Almost my third or fourth visit there with my friends. First I'll start with what I don't like there. The ambience, the monotonous tracks playing in the background sucks at times and the crowd. Good things, they have a big space, they serve delicious biriyani. I don't have any complaints with their food. I love their assorted kebabs and the phirni. They are mouth watering.

Aminia has crafted it's biriyani to an unfathomable level of intricate perfection. The spices and the flavours blend in an exotic way, and the aroma tantalises the senses. The basmati rice is perfectly cooked; the boiled potato is as soft as cotton, whereas the chicken is tender and juicy.

Lastly, I'd like to say one thing. You're never going to regret having biriyani from Aminia. It's better than the best you think is :)
Cheers!

Aminia Rajarhat is one of the most lavish branches of the brand in town. Located in between Chinar Park and City Centre 2 on the main road, they have free parking facility. 2storeys of neat clean glassed medium-classic well designed eating space. Tidy. Hygeinic. Quite a good menu available at reasonable price. Food is great. They also have a roll centre and a juice centre outside the restaurant. People throng the place like friday blockbuster shows! :p
In comparison with Arsalaan, Aminia is a bit cheap but food is uncompromised in quality! And quantity!

Biryanis can never disappoint specially if it is from Aminia. I ordered a plate of Chicken Biryani for myself. Though the taste was not as great as the first and the main outlet near New Market, it was somewhere between average and good. The quantity was nice and the quality good too. Definitely a good value for money.

Yesterday it was a takeaway cause we were doing a biriyani party at work. We ordered almost 20 biriyanis, both chicken and mutton. I personally had chicken. Quantity is an A+ for Aminia. They provide big time potato well spiced. I couldn't eat the entire thing. However the chicken piece was a small portion of the leg piece. Biriyani taste wise was good. Mild flavours, good mix of spice and very light. On the whole they're still keeping up their brand pretty well.

After a long discussion of which place to try next, we ended up with Aminia Restaurant @ Chinnar Park. The restaurant was jam packed with people waiting outside in queue to get a seat. Even the take away counter was super crowded. After waiing for 10 minutes we were given a seat. The interior n decor is just fine. Nothing too fancy and a very light music in d background. We ordered Paneer tikka kebab and chicken tikka kebas as starters. The presentation was great. The chicken kebabs were  soft and succulent and was very appetizing with the pudina chutney(must try). Paneer was a bit hard but that may be coz it was paneer kebab. Coming to maincourse we ordered their famous Spl chicken biryani, spl veg biryani, garlic naan, plain naan, chicken tikka masala and paneer do pyaza. The chicken biryani is one of the finest ones i had recently. The added an extra boiled patato with the biryani which u never find down south. The qyantity was more than enough for two pax. Loved the garlic naan n the chicken tikka masala(lovwd the masala blend in the gravy). We couldnt try their house spl Raan-e-sikandari as they require min. Of two hours to prepare it. So please make an early reservation if you want to try that. Service is an area they need to improve upon. The cost was normal as were billed 1500 for 7 people.
 Now will i recommend this place?? yes i will

On weekends to get a table you hve to wait for at least half n hour.. But the wait is worthwhile.. They even provide home delivery nd dat is also grt no complaints..

The chinar park Aminia is certainly the best outlet of Aminia in town right now. Along with the good food the USP of this outlet is its service decor and ambience. I have visited this place much often as it's closer to my college and now my workplace and I have never been disappointed for a single time. Their Mutton kakori kebab is mouth watering. The biriyani is always served hot and delicious. A clear thumbs up for this Aminia from my side, any day!

The delivery time was done okay.
Coming to food, loved the chicken bharta and the mutton tawa masala.All the tastes were awesome.overall a good experience!!

Let me start from the beginning. We ordered for a office party (pre poila boisakh celebration). Order was placed one day in advance. When the chicken reshmi butter masala was served it looked good. But from the first bite we could feel it was sour. 12 plates of chicken reshmi butter masala was simply dumped in dustbin. The chicken was stale and was having foul smell and taste. We called aminia and they offered to replace the one plate chicken butter masala which was unused and sent a boy with a fresh one. But we refused to accept and sent the one left stale full chicken reshmi butter masala back to the management by that guy. A terribly bad experience and a party spoiler. I can tag all 36 users who tasted it. Sorry Aminia but it's our last order from you.

Visited for a Saturday night dinner with friends with a mood to eat a lot.. Thus, pre-book a Murg Musallam.. And when it arrived, our jaws dropped.. It was huge and just brilliant.. It is enough for 4.. But we were really hungry, so we ordered Achari Chicken Kebab, Fish Seekh Kebab, Lahori Chicken and Murg Hyderabadi.. Each preparation was awesome and distinct.. When we completed these, we had just no space for desserts.. The décor is cozy.. Highly recommended..!!

Worst food quality. Chicken and mutton biryani are not at all up to the mark. Whenever I try to order Mutton Hyderabadi Biryani they say they are out of the item. I do not understand if they can't prepare the item why do they have it in their menu. Very very "irritating ordering service" when ordering for home delivery. Just for the sake of making the menu list look longer does not mean you can put items that you don't prepare or do not have the capability to prepare. Even the menu card listed here is out dated as they charge higher amounts. When queried about this they say its an old menu listed in the zomato website. Extremely unsatisfied with the kind of service from Aminia Rajarhat. I am disappointed!

Very fond of galauti, kakori, burra kababs etc..biriyani is just the way it should be.. Big and spacious with good seating arrangement... Service time is acceptable and the cost reasonable...

Went here some time in November last year, on a Saturday for lunch with friends.
An OK ambience for families, couples and friends alike.
Service is very prompt and friendly. Not a place for fine dining, though. The biriyanis live up to their name, and the kababs are awesome! The portions are quite good too. 
Quite popular with some foreigners as well.
Will definitely visit again.

They have take away service and do home deliveries too.

I asked for a home delivery on the day before yesterday at my location - Siddha Town I placed the order over phone and it took over 14 minutes to place the same. The order was quite simple but it took time to make them understand about my location and my block number. After a long effort, somehow they considered my order and the call was ended.
After I placed the order, I checked the Zomato's online order system. This is not the first time I am trying to place the order online. Before, when I tried to place the  order online, it used to locate my place automatically. There was no option to manually enter the address for delivery. But this time, when I checked, I found that now I can enter my address manually and this is an improvement from Zomato's side. Good going Zomato!

Anyway, the food was delivered within 30 minutes after I placed the order. The delivery boy was polite and did not ask for tips. That was impressive! After I met the delivery boy, it seemed that Aminia outsourced the delivery facility to a third-party vendor. I do not have any complain about the delivery system as the delivery was within time and the food were still warm. The delivery boy was also very polite.

There is nothing to say much about the food. I ordered - Chicken Reshmi Kabab(1), Aminia Special Mutton BIryani(2), Keema Haara Dhania(1), Salad(1) and Firni(2). Firni was not initially on my list to order but the person who took my order, forced me to choose firni as, according to him, my place was too far off from Aminia and my order was marginally over Rs 800. According to him, I should pay more as my location is relatively far from Aminia's Rajarhat location. Without firni, my bill was Rs 870 and I believe, it was quite above the minimum price for home delivery which is Rs 800. Anyway, I was not in a mood to spoil my time and feeling by arguing with the person who was over the phone. It was quite unacceptable from any personnel representing Aminia. Aminia is already known for its quality and quantity of food. 

Anyway, I do not have any complain about the quality of food. They tasted great and every item was good in taste. But regarding the service, I have lots of complaints. I think, Aminnia should educate its staffs and teach them how to receive calls from a customer.

Visited this place on a Tuesday night with a friend of mine. We ordered Mutton galouti kebab, chicken tangdi kebab and Chicken Biryani. 
The mutton galouti kebab was extremely soft & mouth-watering to say the least !!! The chicken tangdi kebab too was very delicious, although a shade lower than the mutton preparation. 
The biryani was a disappointment though, very oily and tasted bland. Texture too was not like the one I remember from the original outlet.
The ambience of the store was good, so was the decor and facade ! Staff is also competent and friendly! 
Overall had a good experience.

So Nice !!
I went there on 12th March at around 9 pm. We were so hungry so we directly went for main course. We got 3 types of Biriyani as they are specialist on that. Ambiance was nice & perfect for family eating out.

1. Chicken Biriyani  ( 8 / 10 ) : It was really nice with a huge quantity. But they dont serve egg with the biriyani. Luckily i got a leg piece.

2. Mutton Biriyani ( 8 / 10 ) : It was also nice but the mutton was under prepared, even it was too hard to bite, but once we ask the same to service person the change the same without any hesitation.

3. Hyderabadi Mutton Biriyani ( 9 / 10 ) : I must give 9 marks for this preparation. It is different type, if you are traditional Biriyani lover then ignore the same but you can do experiment with the same. Taste was good but the plus point is you are getting 2 pcs of medium sizes mutton along with egg. Not only that they are giving one bowl of raita with the same.

4. Fresh Lime Soda ( 5 / 10 ) : This was really bad taste. Taste was bad , quantatiy was small. Even they were serving the same in a paper glass. OMG !! Its unexpected from them.

This place is perfect for having Mughlai cuisine.. The best part of this outlet is its ambiance and taste.. It reminds you of the rich heritage and their legacy of cooking and also maintaining the perfect standard of food..🍴
Having ample taste and spices give you a mouthwatering want.. The briyani has enough meat be it chicken, mutton..
They do serve lip smacking chicken cheese kebab...🍖🍗 We just sit and order mutton biryani, chicken cheese kebab, chicken lahori... Though the food is quite greasy so be prepared for some extra workout 😂😂😂 but it is definitely worth eating when you have some biriyani craving nurves 😁😜..

This is an excellent place to dine in if you are a Biriyani Lover. It is located very close to Chinar Park. Went there last Saturday and found the ambience very nice. It has a very big dining space and hence a lot more people can be accommodated at the same time. Ordered 1 dish of Kasturi Kabab (Starter), 2 plates of Regular Chicken Biriyani and 1 Lahori Murg (Main course), 2 Kulfi (Dessert). The Kasturi Kabab was the best amongst all these. Lahori Murg and Kulfi was excellent too. The waiters were very courteous and well behaved. We were three in number and the above portions were a perfect fit in for our stomachs. All of these at Rs. 990, not quite a bump to the wallet. Would like to visit again, to try the mutton delicacies.

The restaraunt is located near Chinar Park, beside the Arsalan. Amminia used to enjoy monopoly earlier, but now it is facing stiff competition from the newly opened Arsalan. This place does have its own plus points too, mainly the spacious seating area with minimum waiting period for customers. The food is tasty as well!

Its in a location that u can't miss...
There is huge rush on the festive days so u got to be there early. They have many outletss but this is young and dynamic.. u have the young group of youth who is just as par excellence... with their service and food.
They have an awesome Biriyani which i think everyone knows. But to spice up more try their cheese kabab... it just melts in your mouth.... and their firni is uncomparable to anyother rival outlets... go their and try your dishes to match ur palate.
Thumbs up to Aminia.. may u come out with more innovation on the muglai platter.

Another among the numerous restaurants I see while returning from office; finally made it here last Friday. Situated just adjacent to Arsalan, this has more footfalls than Arsalan. The primary reason being space and decoration. You can feast yourself to some delicious Mughal Cuisine seated comfortably inside with friends and family.
Coming to the food, I ordered my favourite Mutton Biryani but the Aminia Special one. It had two pieces of mutton, both good, and most importantly a potato, I love that.
I also took chicken rezzala with didn't disappoint either. Looking forward to trying more dishes from here.
Good restaurant; go for it.

We went to the restro after hearing aminia is awesome food is super and stuff. But I m very much disappointed with the service. Please staff of aminia need to understand 3 things
1. When the restro is half empty and 2 persons are walking in you can easily give them seat instead of asking them to sit in between two persons.
2. When insisting or requesting a person name plate CAPTAIN said if four person come you have to leave the seat. Whereas the restro was half empty.
3. A waiter serving water over poured it so that we leave. And we left without having.

This type of service will leave you nowhere 
Please improve on service.

Aminia has lost its ground because of its sudden fall of quality and also the newly established branch of ARSALAN beside it.Till the time arsalan was not there they used their monopoly but never looked at quality..mutton pieces were becoming smaller,sometimes even smaller than onions(yes,thats actually true..i have visited 3 times and every time same),staffs behaviour degraded,special dishes have nothing special in it...and finally arsalan came in to scene and made their way out of it...needs to improve lot more

The biryani battle in Kolkata between Arsalan and Aminia is as heated up as the New Yorker thin crust vs Chicago deep dish pizza debate.Having had a soft corner for the Arsalan biryani I finally decided to give Aminia a chance and ended up here for a Sunday outing lunch with my family.Being ravenously hungry we ordered for 4 mutton biryanis with a side of chicken tikka right away.The place was jam-packed but we did manage to get a seat and they even dished out our orders quite fast.So coming straight to the point,the biryani was strictly okay.It was a tad bit dry and one of the mutton pieces out of the 4 was really fatty and tough.The quantity was huge and 3 plates would have been sufficient for the 4 of us.The kebab though was moist and paired well with the hari chutney.We got chicken rolls packed as takeaway and they were good too.So overall my vote goes for it's rival chain though the food here is admittedly good.

When this particular out-late was opened, we had high expectations from them... seriously the fond memory of dining at "Aminia" is quite synonymous with my childhood.... but the experience was kinda disappointing... cant comment about the food... mouth watering indeed but their service was extremely poor... after the main course they didnt even clean the table before serving the dessert... anyways its Aminia... the name is enough i guess.

Tried this today (take away). Unfortunately, it is nowhere near the Aminia at esplanade, which charms me since my childhood. The esplanade Aminia has unique taste of its chaap. Here, the same dish but completely different smell and taste.  Similarly, the biriyani. The esplanade Aminia serves a very light and dry biriyani. Here, i found the taste similar to few other popular biriyani joints in kolkata. Nothing unique or special. All in all, if it was not the same brand name, possibly i would have given 3.5 (food is little spicy and hot too), but the taste is nowhere near the aminia at esplanade which i always liked. May be it is just me.

Timing of serving is good and waiter maintains a proper gap between starter and main course. And food is delicious....fantabulous. A proper house of Kolkata's hottest biriyani. Try Hyderabadi bitiyani of course....they are like champion in it. And don't miss mouthwatering raita with it. Nice job guys

After having had hyderabadi biryanies for quite a long time...it's really difficult to justify the review of the same in some place....still not comparing kolkata's biryani to that of hyderabad....i can say that this is really not that a place to be called a good biryani joint in kolkata...i have had biryanies in few other outlets in kolkata like that of Arsalan in Park Circus and this resturant still has to go way ahead in terms of quality and taste to emerge as a popular mughlai and biryani resturant...

The only good thing about this resturant is its location, right next to CC2....

Three visits altogether and got never disappointed. Ambience, space, seating everything is good.
Menu is little less to choose or opt for.....but it's worth it.
Amazing taste, and good service. 
One issue although........you will never get shah tudka when you ask......Dunno why? Phirni is readily available.

This place is a Gem of Chinar Park area. A complete package of delicious mouthwatering foods with outstanding ambiance and well mannered staffs. Many a times I visit the place. My personal fab is delicious Reshmi Kebab as Starter, Authentic Hyderabadi Mutton Biriyani with boneless Chicken Handi at main course  and Kulfi or Firni in desserts. From Romantic dinner to Family get together it is a perfect place to visit. I will insist all the foodies of Kolkata to visit this place as soon as possible.
            

Few days back I visit the place once again with my wife . I tried Chicken Kasturi Kebab and Awadhi Mutton Biriyani. The Kasturi Kabab was too good and Awadhi Biriyani was best of the lot with well cooked Mutton with Egg , Aloo and Kofta.

Went there before our flight and had little time in our hand and found little waiting outside. Finally entered and the concerned guy ws giving us a place for two. But we asked him as guys were sitting to give us a place for 4. He dint give us even though it was empty. Finally some senior person came and gave us the seat we wanted. We had biryani and rezala. The food want good and biryani want up to the mark. But the restaurant was beautifully made.

Aminia is a well known place for biryani. This outlet is located near Chinar Park at Rajarhat Newtown.Visited this place along with family at the time of returning from a trip.We have ordered Chicken Biryani. It was asusual amazingly tasty and lip smacking. We also tried Chicken Reshmi kabab and tandoori , both are excellent. The outlet is big and ambiance is also nice.Staffs are well behaved. Overall it's an enjoyable experience.

This outlet of Aminia is situated at Chinar Park more at rajarhat. quite big. and in my personal opinion it is way better than its esplanade original counterpart. we ordered hyderabadi biriyani and aminia special biriyani. both of those taste very well. hyderabadi biriyani was slightly overspiced. ambience is good. serving is okay. but you may find the bill little bit out of size. but overall a place to have a lunch if you are at rajarhat newtown area( eco park, wax museum) and opt to avoidd CC2.

Ordered for butter nan with chicken bharta and sabzi ustad ki pasand alongwith vegetable dum biriyani and chicken reshmi butter masala. Couldn't make it to the restaurant as I have a busy day. So ordered for home delivery. For what they had served, I shouldn't even give any points. Firstly the butter nan was all burnt and bitter( checkout the pics). The sabzi was oily and tasted dull. Worst was the chicken reshmi butter masala in which the meat was simply floating in a tasteless creamy gravy. What we could actually take was the vegetable biriyani and chicken Bharta. Overall, the eating experience was horrible. Since I had to feed myself with something, I had to eat. Rest was all into dustbin. I had been to this particular 'Aminia' outlet many a times but this experience was worst. They fail to maintain the consistency of food quality. I gave 1 point only for the Chicken Bharta. Beware when you order for home delivery particularly from this Rajarhat outlet.

A restaurant in Chinar park. Quite big restaurant, perfect for having lunch or dinner ambience is also quite good. Been there many times  but had different type of experience regarding food last time. There special Hyderabadi biriyani was awesome to have. And starters and desserts were also very good specially the firni. But last time I was there on September all food tasted salty may be that was an accident but as normal this restaurant is one of the best in the locality.

Visited Aminia (Chinar park) for lunch today with my spouse and a couple of friends. The ambience and the seating capacity is quite good and so are the items in the menu card. We ordered for Tandoori Fish Tikka (₹270), Galouti Kebab (₹260) for starter and Special Chicken Biryani (₹260), Mutton Biryani (₹170) & Chicken Do-piaza (₹195) for the main course and to end it with Double ka Meetha (₹75) for the dessert.
The starters were served within 15 minutes and 'looked' good - the fish tikka had 6 pieces of decent size kebabs served with a green chutney and onions, but, were extremely dry from inside. Hardly I had such a dry fish tikka ever before. Next was the galouti kebab (4 pieces) served on top a small paratha(as it's generally served), but again a disappointment, it tasted more of a shami-kebab than a galouti. The outer portion was fried too much and the interior wasn't too soft to melt in your mouth (as it should have).
Disappointed with the starters, we went forward with the main course, which was decent. The Mutton Biryani had a decent piece of mutton with a potato and the Special Chicken Biryani had 2 pieces of chicken, an egg and a piece of potato. The amount was quite generous.
The double ka meetha was not very sweet (which was good) but it was too flavored either with rose or keora essence (couldn't make it out though). Also, if I am not wrong, seems they don't throw out the side(brown) portions of the bread.
The pocket pinch wasn't very high but wish the experience could have been a bit better.

[Couple of more things - the menu says Double ka meetha but when we ordered the same, the person taking our order called it as Shahi Tukda (which should be a strict no-no) and the person clearing off our plates was in too much of a hurry to clear them.]

I wish I could have given a better rating but the experience was not such.... :(

The second Aminia that falls within my Radar. Cme up quiet for some time now but didn't get a chance to visit till now. Only on last Sunday that i went there with my family afternoon time. As it was a sunday so there was a bit rush so hd to wait for 15 mins before we got place to sit.
This is one huge place to dine with a huge sitting capacity and is in both ground floor and first floor.
We ordered Chicken tikka, Chiken reshmi kebab for starters and Mutton Biryani for main course.
The kebabs were soo soft and was like melting inside the mouth specially the reshmi kebab.
The Biryani was equally tasty but on any day i would rate Arsalan's biryani over Aminia.

I had tried the special Hyderabadi mutton biriyani , masala kulcha, lahori chicken and chicken tikka kabab. The kabab and the biriyani were delicious. But the lahori chicken could have been better!

This restaurant was just a choice to try out the delicacies available. It was eve of Diwali or on Diwali night I walked by the restaurant and it was crowded. We decided to go ahead and try something else than wait in the Q. But, somehow I decided to stay and have my dinner in Aminia. To my surprise the wait was worth the taste. So I was checking on Facebook and I 've see this post on restaurants which are must try in Kolkata and this was one of them. So I set out once again and this time I tried these Kasturi kababs and they were so soft and yummy and let me tell you these are one of the finest kababs I ever had. Make sure you have kababs in ur order. Otherwise the restaurant is pretty decent, spacious and service is upto the mark. 

Note this place is usually crowded so make sure u have a table booked in advance to avoid the crowd.

Location Chinaar Park, Kolkata, WB

The restaurant is comparatively large but little mismanaged, the sole reason for the delays. The biryani tastes good but the person serving, doesn't mix the biryani well, either its too spicy or too dry.
I would also suggest the restaurant management to make it mandatory to wear skull caps to avoid hair strands in food (i found).

The New Market area Aminia (Used to have Biriyani and Rezala during Durga Puja Shopping in Esplanade) was one of favourite during childhood but this is the first time I have visited this outlet of Aminia.

I went there during Durga Puja and as expected there was a queue outside the entrance in Rajarhaat. The door man was doing a decent job in managing the queue.

We were ushered in after waiting for around 10mins (quite good response time being time of festival). Decent arrangement of tables - nothing to highlight here.

We ordered Chicken Reshmi Kebab for starter and Chicken / Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Rezala.

Firstly the plates which were placed at the table was not properly cleaned. Had to ask the server to replace the plates. While waiting for the foods to come we were quite entertained (surprised!!!) by the waiters quarrelling among themselves :).

The Reshmi Kebab was good. Otherwise Biriyani was too oily (Dalda all over) and Rezala was too sweet. Hopefully this is only due to the fact that this was during the Durga Puja and the rush and this is not the definition of food in Aminia (which holds a place in the nostalgic bengalis for their brilliant Biriyani and Rezala)

Will try another time and hopefully i will have something better to write here.

We bought our first car on 31st Dec'14 and had our celebration in this branch of Aminia. We had liked the food and service. After a couple more visits in the meantime, today we decided to come back. Not only was the food quality bad, on our exit, we found the valet had damaged the rear left of the car badly. On enquiring he flatly denied it and refused to call the manager. On further pressure the attendants said the owner/managers don't come to the outlet. 

I would never ever visit this outlet. If ever asked, I will not recommend the place to my friends or relatives. They have damaged my personal property, and their trustworthiness.

Absolutely PATHETIC food. Every day evening i used to see a huge crowd outside the restaurant waiting for their turn inside and even a long queue for take away food. One fine afternoon we decided to try this place and ended up here. We ordered chicken  reshmi kebab as starter and for main course we ordered- chiken biriyani, chicken bharta, butter nan and salad. To my surprise not only was the food EXTREMELY COLD but it was filled with DALDA completely. As if they get dalda for free and they put in ao much dalda that it was getting stick to your fingers. (As dalda gets stuck the moment it becomes cool). We told the staff about this and they bluntly refused to accept it and said "sir humare yeha shaam ko iss khane ke liye line lagta hai aur aapko ye khana pasand nahi aya." 
This very much gives u an idea of what kind of place this is. I feel the people who queue up outside this restaurant have never tasted better food and they feel this is the best. My dear  biriyani lovers please go and try out Arsalan which has just opened beside it and is serving much better food with a much better staff service. 
I m never going to this place again. If at all u want a good biryani then step into Arsalan and u r sure to get value for money service n food there.

Biggest disappointment...... 

I don’t know what was the problem but nobody was interested to give menucard and take order… we asked for menu card after waiting for 15 mins and ordered a food… it takes so much time as they almost forgot about our order.. I don’t know what the confusion was? Everybody was transferring their responsibility to another staff person.. and saying “maine bola tha na tumko.. tumne order andar bola nahi..” then another 2-3 staff members came to us and asked about order…… totally mismanagement.. 

we tried chicken biryani, chicken handi and roti....... 

chicken biryani was average.. we were not able to eat chicken handi as it was tasteless and salty and …. I don’t know why Aminia is famous.. Average food... Poor management…….

Visited during Durga puja for lunch.. It was Nabami and one can spot the waiting crowd from a distance. They told waiters had to work till 5am on Astami that's why they had not reported for the day and for that they couldn't open the 1st floor. After waiting for half an hour or more they opened the 1st floor. This was the first time in this Aminia.. Decoration is nice.. Coming to food we ordered mutton special biryani, some chicken item with lots of creamy gravy, butter nun and lahori chicken. In dessert firni. Foods were good, no compromise with quality in this rush time.. Only one suggestion as they serve Indian , Mughlai food they should give finger bowl at table so that people don't need to go and wash hands.

A small menu card,quick service,fair quantity,fair price and an adequate sitting arrangement for a fine dining experience.
This is what I can draw out of Aminia.

I have visited this place thrice and all I could say neither my pocket nor my body felt pain or were upset.

Mutton Biriyani -  Typical Avadhi style,light,subtle aroma,tender and juicy mutton pieces,sufficient quantity.If you are not a heavy eater 2 biriyanis could be happily consumed by 3.

Murg musallam - Pre order it to avoid any delay,takes long time to make.Order 2/3 hours before you go to dine.Rich and very thick gravy.Chicken stuffed with egg inside.Where as I expected masala and egg.Nevertheless it was tasty with soft Butter Garlic Nans they serve.Sufficient for 3 people.

Aminia Special Mutton - possibly best in lot,a signature light weight mutton curry.
Please check its availablity.

Mutton Rezala - May not be their speciality,but this dish of their was served hot and on a sweeter side.Tasty it was.But you need another spicy side dish to compensate.

Firni and Coolfi - I just like them.Way Better than  chemically enriched icecreams.

I will surely visit them again to check out their Kebabs.

Truth to be told i think this one is stand out from the others. I have my reasons for that. 
1. The ambience, restaurants position and the interior everything is just spot on!
2. Coming to the food I must say it surprises me. Tandoori breads were soft and they didn't cut it from the middle which is essential for keeping it soft.
3. Starters were soft but a bit salty.Main course was tasty,spicy but way too much oily. Less amount of gravy more amount of oil :p
4. washroom was clean enough.
Finally the biriyani Nice,perfectly balanced oil/ghee but again a bit salty.I dunno why this much salt is there in the food.something to work on.
Verdict : Definitely go for it.

The decor of this restaurant is kept simple and comfy and coming to the kebabs and biryani...just unmatched!!!! Keeping up its old old fame..aminia indeed serves the best biryani and kebabs in the entire city!!!! Only if they could prepare the chicken dishes in little less oil..as a thick layer of oil floats over all the chicken items that I have tried here.but apart from that...no complaints!!!

Good North Indian food at reasonable prices, that's what the brand Aminia stands for in the city, and I wasn't disappointed when I went there a few days back. The Biriyani is light, Kebabs nice and smoky and Desserts are pretty tasty as well. If anything, the Kebabs were a bit dry for my liking and they could also do with a few more desserts, all you get is Firni and Kulfi..

Here I had  aminia special mutton biriyani with chicken cheese kebabs. The place is good and usually on weekeds its very crowded. Service is pathetic. Food quality is good. Parking space available. Seating arrangement pretty convinient.

For all those people who sincerely love biriyani, try their biriyani and you will fall in love with it. I recommend the mutton biriyani, if you are a meat lover. The meat and rice are cooked to perfection and the best part ( which is not available in biriyani from any other state ) is the potato- it melts in your mouth and the sensation is unforgettable! Must try

Needless to say this place serves one of the best biriyani in Kolkata and they offer it in a lot of varieties and all of them are equally tasty. Other than biriyani, the kebabs are amazing too from the gaulati kebab to chicken kasturi to fish tikkas. Behaviour of the staffs is good so as their service.

Given that Aminia is a recent entrant to the long list of legacy restaurants that are franchising, it's adopting to it with some good and bads:

Management: Good. Efficient seat allocation management that minimizes waiting time.

Service: Sluggish and disenchanted. It daily retains the legacy lethargic service culture.

Food: Good not great. The biriyanis and chicken chaps dont retain that unique original taste. Mutton biriyani was chewy. But its still a value of money and marginally better than nearby Rahamania.

Decor: Pointless.

Hygiene: Palatable if not anything worth mentioning

This latest outlet is more elegant and sophisticated than the New Market area one. The food is no doubt excellent. Though the service is somewhat slow even on regular days, and the waiters cannot be called experts in their work, it is the food that melts your heart. Do try their firni. It's one of a kind.

I went to New Market Aminia many times but got a chance to visit Rajarhat Outlet for the first time with my family. The interior is really wonderful. First we had ordered Tandoori Chicken which was soft & very tasty (one of the best tandoori chicken I had till now). Next came the Special Mutton Biriyani and I felt the quality and taste was way better than Aminia New Market. After that we had ordered Butter Naan which was fresh & soft and in side fish Chicken Butter Tikka Masala which was really mouth watering. In desert we had Firni & Kulfi which tasted delicious. I would like to visit this outlet again.

So we landed up at Kolkata airport, had two hours of stop over.. We decided to take a quick bite of some of the authentic dishes nearby airport. Got to know that most of the famous joints were far and would take not less than 3-4 hrs round trip to airport. So a local guy in the nearby mall suggested us to check out this Restaurant Aminia.. The ambience is very simple but the place was totally packed. We ordered their signature dish chicken biryani and fish tikka to start with. The order was quick with enough quantity for two people .. The chicken pieces were soft and melted in mouth .. Highly recommended. We also tried their mutton biryani which was ok.. To finish we ordered phirni which was very average , looked old..overall experience was ok..Good place to relish chicken and mutton dishes in mughlai style..

We decided to make an order from this outlet for a small dinner party at work. The food turned out to be really good, keeping the standards of Aminia alive. Chicken Rotisserie looked awesome, tasted awesome. Perfectly spiced up and roasted. The Special Mutton Biryani smelled nice, beautifully flavoured, wonderfully coloured and tasted great. It had two pieces of soft and tasty mutton, one potato and egg. Sufficient quantity too. We also had Lahori Murgh, which tasted tangy and the gravy was delicious. We were pleased with the quality of the food. The price is also fine, keeping in mind the area they serve. Good job, Aminia.

The name itself speaks of its class! They serve you all classic moghlai dishes. This outlet of aminia at rajarhat has a pleasant ambience with sufficient space for dining. The take away counter is always bustling with people. The appetizer and the main course was delicious but the dessert was a huge disappointment. We had ordered 'firni' which was nothing but bland completely.

Yesterday we visited this Aminia outlet and we were very much impressed with their improvement. quality of food excellent. The biryani was awesome, fish tikka kebab mind blowing also the nun and tandoori roti were soft and yum. Only regret is we asked for mutton galwati kebab which was unavailable. Next time we hope to have that.

The Chinaar Park outlet of Aminia is quite spacious and a very crowded one...the sitting arrangement is comfortable and nice..Quality of food is also very good..biryani is tasty kebabs are juicy and mouth melting..in dessert the baked mihidana with rabri is a pleasant surprise..service is ok..waiters are a bit rude..

Aminia is one of the oldest and favourite biriyani junction of Bengalis in Kolkata and currently this brand has extended upto Rajarhat New town, with its smart and glorious look near Chinar Park bus stop. I planned many times but could not make it up till now but that became success recently to visit this place and taste some varieties. Although I am not a big Aminia biriyani lover, I felt the seating and the hospitality they offer at this branch is quite adorable. The menu remains the same except a few drinks(mocktails) added in the menu list.
We ordered kakori mutton kebab, muton biriyani, chicken Lahori and salad, among drinks we opted two mocktails, lemon virgin mojitto and sweetheart lady...
The bill came around 900. The service was prompt and unlike the other branches, the Sevice was a pretty well mannered.

Judging by it's reputation and my past experience in one of its other outlet, I decided to treat my friends who were visiting Kolkata with one of the best biriyani joint in the city. But I was more disappointed than my friends when I realized that I made a wrong decision. In spite of having two floors, they still scamper for space. After queuing up for a long time, the three of us finally got a table. We ordered chicken biriyani, obviously. To compliment it, I asked for mutton tawa masala and lahori chicken. The waiter took the order and disappeared even without fetching us a glass of water. After asking almost 2-3 waiters for water, one was kind enough to pour some into our glasses reluctantly. The biriyani came quick followed by lahori chicken. When asked about the mutton item, I was told it can't be served now. Without creating any fuss I asked if they can get us a chicken keema instead. He said yes and went back inside. We were eating slowly, waiting for the other dish to come. After 10 mins, the waiter replied that even that is also unavailable. I was now desperate. I said what about kadai chicken and he disappeared again in the kitchen, this time for eternity. We were hungry and were done with the food. When we asked for the bill, the waiter said if he should parcel the kadai chicken. I politely replied that I have no intentions of parcelling any food I meant to eat here. You can consider it cancelled since it was not served to me within proper time. The matter didn't escalate further fortunately, but I am seriously disappointed with the kind of service that is provided by this joint. Piggybacking their esteemed popularity is not going to work forever. I'm rating it 2.5 only for the food. Everything else is basic, overrated and crappy.

Perfect place for Mughlai dishes. I haven't been to older branches and happen to land up here by chance. 
So cant say whether all branches dish out with same perfection :)
Chicken Tikka (gravy) and Chicken Achari were really finger licking tasty. Rich gravy and perfect taste. 
Briyani is good and would be near about iconic Royal though different preparation alike Arsalan. 
Pocket friendly and worth every penny 
Rs. 300 per head if group exceeds 3 persons

Had a wonderful Kebab experience in d form of Kakori n Kasturi. Aminia special Nun is a bit heavy due to its nut n other toppings and it's sweet taste overpowers the natural flavour of items like Mutton Keema n Lahori Chicken. But, overall a nice experience coupled with good ambience and equally cordial staff behaviour. Worthy to be visited for several times not only for Biriyani, but also for other items. Wish to see a more improvised interior.

Last Night me and my brother had a dinner at this outlet as we have heard some positive things about its ambiance and quality of foods. So we decided to give it a chance. We ordered Peas Pulao and Fish Tikka Butter Masala. The Quantity of Fish Tikka Butter Masala was okay but the quantity of Peas Pulao was less as far as the price is concerned.The taste of Fish Tikka Butter Masala was good but the taste of Peas Pulao was not good as Arsalan (Hatibagan). Ambiance is good if not best. The waiter's behaviour who took our order was bad as we felt that he is doing us a favor. The most disappointing thing about this outlet is that after having your dinner and after getting your bill you will see the taxes (Vat and service tax) are too high. You will feel you could have ordered another item with its tax value. This was my first visit at this outlet and I am lil disappointed with the quantity of food and high tax. Sorry to say but I have a better dining experience at Aminia Nagerbazar than this outlet.

This was my first experience at this outlet. This review and rating is based on the doorstep delivery service and does not include dine-in service. Incidentally, this was my first time to try the dish Murg Musallam. We also ordered rotis, mutton rezala, chicken tehrani, chicken do piaza and green salad.
Delivery was slightly late but hassle-free.
Packing was average - murg musallam came in a box but good amount of oil spilled out of it. Other dishes were intact however. None of the containers were written with the name of the items, its our knowledge that helped us understanding what was what.
Coming to food - quantity:quality ratio was healthy. The murg musallam was an extremely tasty delicacy - cooked with great care. Rotis were of fine quality and size. Rezala was good to taste but the meat was not boiled well, it was hard. The two chicken dishes were also very well-cooked and tasty. Green salad was standard. Best part of the food was - it was rich and spicy but was very easy to digest and that was result of good cooking with good ingredients.
Overall, a nice friday night dinner experience. Would like to recommend this outlet for a casual lunch/dinner.

We reminded the waiter of the soft drink. But there was no response. Then we ordered veg biriyani and mutton biriyani. The mutton biriyani was okeish but the veg one was terrible in taste.. The raita which was served with biriyani was too sweet.The behavior of the staffs were too bad. I suggest not to go to this place at all.

I have been there a lot many times earlier for their mutton roll which has a separate ourside counter, but I visited this place for the first time for dinner this friday.
The place needs to build a covered parking area as people flock in good numbers because of its location (and the brand name). Aminia is located near cc2 and is a good place for dinner if you have just completed your day's shopping and are craving for biriyani.
I always prefer mutton over chicken and the mutton biriyani here will not disappoint. We had also ordered for chicken tandoori (was ok-ish). You will find the decor to be decent here.

Food - 4
Ambience/decor - 3.5
Overall - 3.5

The place is swanky. Nicely done the brand Amina brand has reinvented it's self. Quality of food quite good. Quantity is good. Price point at par with quality. However the service is a little wanting. Now I am not looking for 5 star service here... But the waiter changed my order without asking he just said he ran out of the dish and hence took the liberty. Also charged for mineral water without asking whether I preferred it or something else. The low score is for poor service only. Will I go again well I am not very sure.

Aminia located near CC2 . Awesome place , spacious also loved the place. The food is note worthy too. Went with friends ordered Chicken Biryani , Chicken Tandoori , Butter Nan & Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala , everything tasted so good . Staff are not that well behaved were hovering around every 2minutes to take away the plates really annoying it was.

This a very common place for me and good part is it remains open till 00:00 AM.Very large and busy dining space in both the floors.I have visited here more than 15 times.To me it's better than New Market outlet.I like their Biriyani,kebabs and roll.Specially Chicken Kasruri kebab, Achari tikka,Mutton Galauti Kebab is my favourite.In side dishes Chicken hydrabadi, Lahori chicken impressed me a lot.If you are a Tangri Kebab fan then please try Chicken Rotisserie here.It contains 4 pieces of kebab(2 leg pieces and 2 chest pieces) along with one Laccha Paratha and one piece of kashmiri aloo.All dry fruit lovers will like the Aminia special Naan. In winter they serve Nalli Nehari, a specialty of Mutton side dish.Firni is soso.Overall if you are a Kebab and biriyani lovers don't miss this outlet.

Aminia well the name suggests too good mughlai cuisine.Well the biriyani is good as per the standards.The best thing here is the mutton special curry which melts in ur mouth.
But the bestest thing is the chicken and egg or mutton roll.Well u ve to stand in a long que but the wait is worth for the delicious rolls.

This is my worst biriyani experience ever. There is no biriyani saffron smell, rice looks like fried in yesterday leftover oil. Meat isn't tender and soft. There is no biriyani factors but it happened to be fried rice converted to biriyani.@Indranil.

I have visited this place twice and liked the staff and ambience .... 
Its heaven for biryani lovers and a must try out .

During my visits I tried out Mutton special biryani which comes with one egg, one potato, two pieces of mutton😍 and a wholesome quantity of rice...
With that one can go for Mutton Handi (which is shredded mutton chops) or Mutton Chap... (both excellent)

Its a great place to hang out with family and friends but sometimes is over crowded on weekends.

And lastly one friendly advice don't go for the fresh lime soda. Its a disaster...

Last Sunday me and my wife went to Rajarhat Aminia. I had order chicken Handi  and my wife ordered mutton tawa fry. The food is good but i am little bit confused also...is it necessary to add that much of Oil ? As we have to separate the oil from the curry to a different plate to start our lunch. And at the end  they disappointed by saying no Feni available today.

Yesterday visited this place for the second time. The best thing about this restaurant is that Aminia is located at Chinar Park, and near to CC2. Good place for food/dinner after shopping :)

Ordered the Chicken Tandoori and believe me its one of the best chicken tandoori. Also ordered Chicken Biryani which is as usual very good in quality.

Also ordered a special item Mutton Hyderabadi Biryani (only available on Fri/Sat/Sun). It's something different than usual with a fine smell of curry leaves, with two pieces of mutton and one egg (no potato piece :) ). Good one, you may try this.

Edit on 25 Nov 2017: This becomes a regular place for me. If I am here at CC2 then I must visit Aminia. Good food with reasonable price.

Yesterday was Aminia day for me. Whenever I think of authentic Kolkata Biriyani - the first name that comes to my mind is Aminia. Very fond childhood memories are associated with this name. But that was New Market Aminia. Here, the New Town one is a new addition to the Aminia family.

When I go for a food outing, my preferences are bit specific - not only just the food but also the courtesy of the people who are serving, the ambience and the basic facilities like car parking etc does matter.
So here is my rating :
Food - 3.5/5 (I apologise, but I think the cook here and the authentic Aminia at New Market are different. I find more flavour in the biriyani available at the latter)
Courtesy of people who are serving : 1.5 / 5 (customer service is an art, don't want to be rude - but I would prefer to eat in a bit of more civilised reception)
Ambience : 2.5/5 (decoration is good, but too congested and noisy)
Basic facilities : 3.5/5 (they have valet parking)

Can be easily located as it is situated near chinarpark crossing. This is the biggest outlet in calcutta as far as I think and as it is new the place is neat and clean in its appearance. We went there for a late lunch on Sunday and found that the whole place was packed with customers but luckily we got a place to sit. The staffs were super ignorant and showed no interest in taking our orders. At last we managed to place the order for 3 biryani, 2 firni and 1 green salad. I was surprised to find that the biryani was quite light and had no excess oil in it. I really enjoyed it as well as my friends. The firni was really yummy and wonderful in taste. We were really satisfied with the lunch apart from the service scenario which was pathetic.

This is located in Chinnar Park Rajarhat and is mostly overcrowded all time, hence at times it is very irritating to to stand outside and wait for a seat. Talking about the food quality, I found this better than the outlet in Esplanade. Tandoor Chicken, and Mutton Rezalla is really nice, Biriyani is more or less average and quantity is also less. Ambience is good and interiors looks really promising, in desert, they only have Firni, which can be tasted, will love to see more variations in desert. Overall good for family dinning.

Nobody served on our table whatever we ordered was brought to our table and kept that's it. We had to serve each other.
Ordered for 1) chicken tagri kebab - nicely roasted chicken drumsticks, soft and juicy.
2) Aminia special mutton barra kebab - Tandoori mutton kebab well marinated in a medium spicy masala. Could have been better, mutton was chewy.
3) chicken kasturi kebab - Hariyali tikka rechristened... succulent chicken cubes, roasted to perfection in a green mint coriander marinade. A must try

That's all for starters, we dived into the main courses then. Ordered for
1) Lahori chicken - awesomely delectable preparation.... Ummmm...still salivating by the thought of it. Another must try.
2) mutton rezala - one big piece of a meat  rectangular cut from the rib, highly disappointed thin white gravy sweetened with sugar and the meatchad a big fat layer and so hard and chewyas if uncooked. do not recommend at all.
3) mutton khada masala - slightly sweet was expecting a medium spicy version. Mutton though was very soft the gravy was very greasy and overall wouldn't recommend. 
4) garlic naan - good accompaniment with any and spicy / non spicy / medium spicy main course. Full flavour. 
We wanted to have gilaouti and mutton stew but they were not available, we also wanted to order kakori but we were discouraged stating that it will take very very long to prepare. 
Overall experience was not so good, had expectations basis the review and rating of 3.7 on Zomato.

Visited this outlet of aminia yesterday around 3-ish with two of my friends. The place is quite big and has a huge sitting area.The place was supercrowded and hustling, when we went and though most of the tables were full, we got a seat immediately. Since aminia has a heritage of serving delicious biriyani,we opted for the same. 2 of my friends ordered chicken biriyani n I ordered a mutton biriyani for myself. I along with my friends were quite satisfied with the quantity served and the quality of the food. The rice was sufficient,wih a big nice piece of mutton or chicken which was quite tasty too. For the dessert we wanted to try the mango firni but since it was unavailable, we opted for the normal firnee. It was delicious. The best thing about the firnee was that the sweetness of the dish was adequate and the sweetened taste did not overpower the other flavours. The price of the food is in sync with the quality. But having said the good things, the service of this restaurant is of no good. The staff were quite rude and we had to call after them repeatedly to place the order. While placing the order it seemed they were not at all interested to even listen to us. This attitude was highly disappointing and I feel management should definitely look into this matter.

We had a friends' reunion today at this place. Service is pretty nice. Friendly crew. Ordered Biriyani, Rezala ( both chicken and mutton ), Naan and Rumali Roti along with Firni for dessert. Food is tasty, nice interior decorations and prompt delivery. Though the musics they played spoiled the mood a bit. Kebabs and Biriyani were really yummy. Rezala though was a lot sweeter than the usual, still they were taken care of. Overall, a good place to be with old buddies.

This outlet is at chinar park and certainly a busy one ... Alwys crowded specially in weekend ...Spacious as they have a big sitting arrangement. The decor inside is very nice... The price here is a bit more than other aminia outlet as its a premium one... As per the quality of the food its serious a very nice one...In fact the delivery experience was nice as once we have ordered in odd place of Rajarhat but they managed to send that on time.. Expressive.. I recommend to try them

1. Chicken cheese kebab
2. Reshmi Kebab
3. Dal makhni
4. Mutton Rara
5. Mutton khara masala
6. Baked mihidana with Rabri

Loved all of these and also the Biriyani is famous as everyone knows... Recommended :)

Everything was very good and upto the mark. The food and the service was also nice. The serving time could be shortened as we had to wait a lot for the starters.
All in all it was a good experience and even on a weekday it was packed so you could guess this place is a must visit.

Last day I went to Aminia (Chinar Park) with few of my office collagues with an empty stomach. When it comes to mughlai cuisine , this place has been delivering such beautiful dishes from last few decades.
This branch is too new and well decorated I must say, the hospitality from the waiters are pretty commandable. 
We have ordered Chicken Roast as a starter.
Trust me it is one of the best thing I have ever had in Kolkata and after that we took tandoori roti, Chicken chap , Mutton Biriyani , Chicken tikka kabab butter masala and ended up with Firni. This branch has maintained the same quality of the oldest branch(Esplanade) in terms of taste however you'll feel more special when you get the supreme quality of hospitality. Wish this place will continue this legacy in future as well.
A must visit with friends and family with an affordable price. :)

Food was good but most the items which we wanted to order were not available even on a normal day normal dinner time. Even the food that was server had a piece of hair on it. After shouting they replaced the plate but they might have taken the same plate and reserver the same place. They didn't even paid heed for keeping the hair-ed plate and giving us a fresh item which we insisted.
An advice to everyone having food at Aminia, they give wrong/less changes. We had food for 1123, gave 2 notes of 1000 each but they refunded only 777. If you are not careful in counting and just step away you would not get any refunds.
However galotia kabab and firni were awesome. Biriyani was good, chicken/mutton quality was finely baked but service and their honesty are extremely poor.

Hi,The restaurant is not for vegetarian as most of the vegetarian dishes mentioned in menu are not available any time of the year.The food service is very slow and no one is even bothered if you have your water on your table.The food taste is just OK and nothing is so tempting about it.The place is managed poorly and requires better management.I would not suggest this place for any kind of group because you cannot talk peacefully as most of the time you will see staff shouting on each other.OM

Good food. Heavily crowded. Waited 30 mins for an entry to the restora. The only thing you would love here is Biryani.
We ordered kababs. And unfortunately, to our surprise they were completely burnt.
Asked the floor manager for a replacement.
Poor service. You could not get a single person who could take care of your needs.
If you are with your family or special ones, I recommend you to avoid this place. They are gonna induce bad moments in your life with their awful kababs and service.
The way, the biryani was served would make you feel, being the most unluck person in the world, with rice spread all over the dish in an uneven manner.

One afternoon a large group of us friends decided to drop by here for a birthday treat. Located right at the Chinar Park crossing, it's hard to miss this place. When we arrived, we did have to wait outside for 20mins as the place was packed, but once we entered, it's a completely different place! The ambience is nice and quiet unlike the noisy and congested road outside.

Now about the food. We had ordered several plates of mutton and chicken biriyani, chicken tikka kebab, chicken reshmi kebab, chicken cheese kebab, mutton rezala, aminia special mutton curry and firni. The biriyani was good (after all Aminia is famous for it) though not exceptional. The kebabs were good and I especially liked the green chutney that they served with it. But what stole the show for me was the chicken cheese kebab! We were hesitant ordering it but now I just have to say "YUM!" Loaded with cheese, the soft chicken piece melts in your mouth as you bite into it. I loved it and would go back if only for it. All in all the food was good in both quality and quantity.

It is surprising that yester day I have ordered for 3 Chicken biriyani and one mutton biriyani for my home but after opening the parcel I have found in all the packets two big now of half boiled potato and one small piece of the chicken/mutton provided where the rice quantity is very less. Its a great experience for me. Basically I always used to take this type of food from Arsenal, park circus which is too far from my house and after that I have chooses Aminia for this outlet. But in the first visit I got deprived where most of the customers like me is cheated by this organisation. Sorry for the inconvenience but without this explanation my hard money never get satisfied. Always check the quantity and the pieces which is packed before the staffs of that particular counter at rajarhaat. For clerification can call me at 9830080053

Quite a busy and jam packed restaurant.We went for dinner at 10:30 pm and to our surprise no table was available. People love Aminia. :D 
We had chicken biryani there. Taste was good but not worth the money we paid for it.Restaurant was clean and ambience was average.

Reasonably good north indian food. Possibly the best place in this part of town for the price tag. The rest of the joints nearby have poor hygiene standards. Personally I prefer their rolls and kebabs more. Biriyani is ok, too much of Big elaichi and shah jeera flavor.  Too strong for my appetite. Oil is too much in all dishes.

Aminia to me has become a part of Kolkata heritage .. I have  been to the main Esplanade outlet  a few times and have great memories.. The new Aminia outlets which have opened all over kolkata are the newer improved version .. Quite similar to the chains we find in Mumbai or Bangalore.. 
I visited the Rajarhat outlet with my mother at around 9 pm it was raining The ground floor is mainly for Rolls and takeaways .. Not sure if they have a place to dine  .. We had to ask the cash counter guy for the restaurant .. We went to the 1st floor .. It was disappointing not to see a doorman , we had our hands filled it was very difficult to open the big door , I ordered the my  usual mutton biriyani , mutton razela  , chicken chap and Firni for desert ... Always been a big fan of the biriyani .. The mutton razela was superb less spice with a lot of flavor nd fat enriched the entire dish .. The chap is good as usual ..I love firni in dessert because it's not so sweet and tastes amazing .. The other negative no finger bowl after dinner we literally had to walk from one end to the other to wash hand and had to wait in a queue .. Would have been 4 if only for the food ..

Nice place, but the waiters don't know much about service. They will bring you the food and leave not serve. So why pay tip or service tax.
Waiters are may be locals so they have their own goon like attitude.
 
Second issue is too much noisy.

Third and big issue for me is that food is tasty but very spicy but still I love it.

Aminia is a place that I get regular home delivery from. I havnt really sat there to have dinner but I have seen the place and it looks much better than their other outlets. The food here is typically what we find in outlets like Arsalan, Zeeshan, Shiraz, etc. Mughlai worth ur money. The food here is nice, specially the Mutton Tikkia and the Kesar Firni. Their Biryani is better than the original Aminia at Esplanade but, the Chicken chaap is no where close to the original which is a big disappointment. All in all I guess I'll keep ordering for home deliveries on and off.

This is a new outlet of the popular restaurant brand "Aminia". The food is overall good. Apart from biriyani i had tired butter nun and chicken bharta and that was really outstanding. According to the taste of food I would like to give 4.5 rating but the serving is a little bit slow according to me. Hope they will serve a little quick from next time.
I have been there today again and have tried mutton biriyani, chicken reshmi kebabs, chicken butter masala.

Went here on 17-Apr as a sudden plan to take an office team member for a farewell lunch. Tried chicken biryani & chicken chaap. Food quality is same as in the main Aminia in Esplanade area which we tried long back. However, the other aspects remain same as the original one such as service and ambience and crowd remain the same. Of course, price wise its pretty economical.

Big fan of Aminia and I have always tried to visit the place whenever I get a chance. Their ambience was good, it was raining heavily outside so we managed to take some awesome selfies inside and the lighting was perfect :D
Now coming to the food part, I went with a couple of friends and we ordered Chicken Reshmi Kabab, Mutton Rezala, Chicken Rezala, Paratha and Chicken Biryani. Chicken Reshmi Kabab was delicious, it was soft and juicy and being very hungry that day, it satisfied my appetite to the full! The paratha was a bit on the tougher side which was not easy to eat but the Mutton Rezala was too good! I love the gravy although the mutton piece they gave me had less mutton and more fat! And lastly the Chicken Biryani was also very good.
So all in all a great place to visit. Although I think they should have atleast two types of paratha (they have only one).

A sudden plan to drop onto Aminia, one fine afternoon. The valet parking was nice. Adding on to it was the decor and ambience inside. I liked the place quite a lot. Not a big fan of the New Market outlet though. Quite a lot of staff.
The lampshade of the ceiling was quite nice.
Onto the food now, the Mutton Biriyani was awesome here. Perfect melted potato and tender mutton. The rice was adding onto them, with a nice aroma. Note: I asked the staff specifically whether they use any special potato...on which they replied they use the normal Jyoti potatoes readily available in the market. We asked for Lahori Chicken, and believe me the gravy was relishing. Firni as usual..Aminia class.
All in all a satisfied pocket and a satisfied hunger. A recommend to my fellow Zomatians.

This new addition in Chinar Park seems to be one of those which has very quickly become a crowd puller. Aminia is not new to people from Kolkata and this place lives up to its name. Tried few starters and the Biryani and it was good! Worth a visit! Beware of the long queue in weekends and festive eves.

by far the best aminia i have been to so far.

location just on chinar park crossing you can see the rush right outside the restaurant once you visit this place 
its spacious like hell and the seats are comfortable and more importantly the ambience and food matters.

for ambience a thums up beckons. 

and food is delicious absolutely delicious!!
it was my first visit here so it was obvious decision was to eat biriyani and a side dish was a mutton tikka we had less cash so the we had to shift to a economical budget meal 
me an my friend had a good experience overall and i would like to visit again

The newest of the lot! It was my first visit to Aminia, Rajarhat yesterday! I wad quite pleased with their service as they were quick at everything. Aminia is one of the most sought joints for Biryani and it has maintained the level very well. The best thing about this place is the interiors. It is very well decorated and much more spacious, unlike the one in Esplanade. As we went during the Ramzan, how could I miss the special Chicken Haleem. It was prepared very well and paired with parantha and roomali roti, it tastes really nice. One of my friends had mutton biryani which was also quite amazing.

Aminia that has opened up in Rajarhat Chinar Park area had eluded me for quite some time, but finally went there for a team lunch. The place is quite large compared to golpark one with lots of tables and I did notice a difference in the menu. 
We had Chicken Cheese kebab, paneer tikka, mutton galauti kebab, a roasted chicken and fish seekh kebab for starters. The chicken cheese kebab was nice and creamy, paneer tikka was decent. The fish seekh kebab was disappointing though, i felt it lacked flavor. Galauti kebab was soft, but the paratha below was too crispy and thick. I have had better. Finally came the roasted chicken (rotisserie) which is pretty rare in kolkata. It comes with two lachha parathas and a potato with the chaap curry. It was really well done, but they added a bit too much lemon in my opinion.
Main course was mutton biriyani, mutton tawa masala and raita. These dishes need no mention and it was really filling.
Finally for desert we had kesar firni and rabdi with mihidana. Both of which were excellent and left a great aftertaste. Overall a good lunch and good food.
I will rate it 4/5

I am all praises about Aminia... It's the first time I've tried their spread, and it was great :) the food was perfect, the ambience quite pleasing, and they didn't keep us waiting although the place was jostling with people. Anyway, coming to the food... We ordered chicken cheese kabab, chicken reshmi kabab and fish tikka kabab. The fish one was awesome, it melts inside your mouth and makes you crave for more! The chicken cheese kabab was a clear winner... Try it and you'll see why!

The mutton biryani was moist, spicy and tasted like a piece of heaven :) the mutton pieces were really well-cooked... Loved it! The side dishes mutton keema and chicken chaap were fantastic, too. Overall, not bad at all! Looking forward to my next visit :)

In Calcutta, Biriyani enjoys a very special place in the world of food and the restaurants which provide a special flavor to it get a very special recognition. Aminia is one of them. This place in Rajarhat near City Centre 2 has a very elegant look. The service here is quite well to do with that is when they are not over crowded. The food that you order here will be served to you in matter of minutes. The quality and quantity is justified. The flavors that they have on their palette are quite well known and appreciated by almost everyone. One will surely love to eat here. They have one of the best biriyanis in the city and they keep it that way. This is a place you should visit if you love food. A must visit restaurant for every foodie.

Recently visited this restaurant with my friends and had chicken reshmi sheek kebab, biryani and chicken butter masala. The kebab was smooth and delicious specially the pudina chutney that they served with it tasted great. But the main course, the biryani which is my favourite dish was just OKAY! The flavours were good but the wow factor wasissing that other famous restaurants provide in their biryanis. I mean Aminia is known for biryani but the biryani did not stand out unique from others plus the chicken piece in the biryani was not good. It was bit tough to chew. Also I noticed that they served a big piece of boiled potato. I thought they did it intentionally so as to reduce the quantity of rice but it may nit be as the quantity was good and price was economical. The chicken butter masala was also delicious and thank God the chicken pieces in it was very good and tasty. Last but not the least we had firni which was unique in taste. It had pinch of kesar in it. Overall experience was good but if you would ask me for a second time, i would give a secon thought gor it

As I reside nearby, I have been many a times. Also as a Biriyani and Kebab lover I had huge expectations from Aminia being opened at Chinar Park.I must say, the Aminia Rajarhat has exceeded my expectations in quality of food they prepare and serve. The service is very prompt, restaurant arrangements are very aesthetic. The food specially Biriyani and Kebabs are best in city and best among other Aminia outlets. Another point, the Home delivery option and the boys who deliver are just awesome...!!

Last friday I went there with my frnd. We ordered mutton biriyani, tandoori fish tikka kebab, mutton rogan josh, butter nun and firni. Biriyani was good. The fish tandoori was ok but the most pathetic was the Rogan josh. Taste of the dish was not good. Mutton was not cooked properly. I left the mutton piece . They compensate this things with two cold drinks. BAD experience.

Being a Biriyani lover I had high expectations from this place. So when I got chance for a group lunch with my team, this was our first choice. The restaurant id big and it was fairly crowded. The taste of biriyani was nice. The galouti kebab disappointed us as it was dry and chewy. The chicken bharta was average in taste but mutton kasha was good. ambience is nice and relaxing. Service is prompt.

Extremely poor service received from Aminia. We have ordered 10 chicken swabarma roll for delivery. It was of 100 rs each, but seems like it was at least 2 days old. It was very hard to take a bite as well. Very poor food.
When we made a complain for that, they replied this roll will become hard after few minutes of preparation. When we asked then why you took our order and not let us know at the time of providing order itself, they replied it is not their headache, it is up to the customer.
Very poor food and service, strongly recommended to avoid Aminia.

Being a biriyani lover ... i have visited multiple times almost all restuarants famous for serving biriyani , Aminia being one of them .... Having had biriyani in all other branches of Aminia in the city ... i have to say that this by far serves the best quality among all other its other branches ....and yes .. quality in different branches of Aminia indeed differ (though slightly) .... this one being situated in a great location in chinar park crossing .... there's always crowd outside in parcel counter ..... the ambience inside is great ..... large interior space and nicely decorated ..... biriyani quality is one of the best in the city ....its quantity is also nice ..... have tried kebabs ....they are also good .... the prices mentioned are inclusive of taxes ,so as a reference its slightly costlier than arsalan park circus 7pt crossing (which doesn't charge VAT on its food items) but slightly economical than arsalan hatibagan (which charges taxes separately in addition) ....

Sometime, during the summers of 2013, we visited Aminia New Market joint. The place was over crowded, and the waiter that served us was totally unfriendly. He shouted at us for not leaving behind tips for him. With this experience at the very first time, Aminia was never my choice there after.
But the Rajarhat joint had something different. During April 2015, my husband visited the place for his office team lunch. He was looking for a chance to visit with me. Finally, we visited the place for dinner last night. Located at the main road of Chinar Park bus stop, the place easily catches people's attention. We were greeted in by smiling faces of the waiters. We were led to a table for two. The place is very bright and lively, with happy faces all around. We ordered Chicken Tandoori, Plain Naan, Ustad Ki Pasand Sabji, and Dum Biryani. The tandoori pieces were cooked till tender, and was the best I had in a long time. The Ustad Ki Pasand Sabji is a must try, if you are a veg person. The bowl is more than enough for two, very much spice free (optimum for summers like this), and tasted delicious. My husband is a veg person, so we had Vegetable Dum Biryani. Never before had I imagined that veg biryani could taste so awesome. The dish had chunks of panner, potatoes, carrots, peas, beans, and the rice was cooked till perfection. The only problem one could face is the size of the tables for two. Once your food arrives, it becomes very difficult to sort out the plates. You can't move your hands freely, and that keeps you conscious all the while. Rest, all good. We had till our stomachs could take no more. The bill that came out for all this was much much lesser than what we expected. The VAT was incredebly lesser than many other joints. Who goes to KFC when one could have much better chicken in much lesser price in Aminia, Rajarhat. Overall, it was a lovely experience. Gonna visit again very very soon.

Yes sir/ ma'm, if you are planning on having selected Aminia@ chinar park as an ideal place to bring in your date to munch on to some good biryani and have a nice time with your date...then quit your plans...because in all probablity they' ll ask you to sit beside another couple breathing down your neck (mark it 2/2 for us).

" Sir, we have those large empty tables of 4 for our non existent customers. Why don't you sit with you date beside another couple  on this long bench....shared by almost 9-10 couple... So that when you sneeze, it can get to the next pesron sitting beside you, it adds to the mood of the evening!"

So I get it....its Aminia....the name speakes a lot. But just because its Aminia doesn't make all the bad things disappear. I wont be talking much on food as I think its quite a clear deal ( the special biryani is too good). But does that mean that you set up a resturant to fit almost 30-40 people comfortably at a time and yet ask your customers to sit on sombody elses lap, hoping that your non existent customer suddenly show up and fill the room with double the capacity? Good going Amina!

I had a very bitter experience @ Aminia , chinar park ( although the other outlets of Aminia is quite good/ personal experience).. The behaviour n the hospitality of the waiters and the management are too bad... I would request u never to visit there ..It jst runs via its brand name...there are a lot more outlets near Chinar Park..njy ur day there :)
The seating arrangement there is so conjusted that u cnt have a healthy conversation.. It can't give u any personal pace..the side by customer sitting beside u can evn read the msg u type at ur mobile..so i think u cn understand that kind of chipku n small environment it is (although there are plenty amount of place available). They don't care about customer Satisfaction... Very bad behaviour...

This place is just majestic. Starting right from the giant gate and down to the mesmerizing food, this place is royalty personified. The quintessential Biriyani is a must have along with my personal favourite of parathas and wide range delicious chicken and mutton dishes.

Last Friday the midnight hunt for food ended here. It was not exactly what we wanted maybe but it was definitely what we needed at that moment. Now coming to the review, the food aka Biriyani at Aminia is great here(Rajarhat), IMHO better than new market Aminia which I visited earlier this year. From the appetizing smell to the buttersoft biriyani with all the balance of textures was just splendid. Or may be we were just hungry. But for whatever reason I liked it. The firni was a tinsy bit dry, I like a little viscosity in my dessert. The staffs were lousy though. I would expect improvement in service the next time I visit there. Recommend.

Biryani is very good. One of the best in Kolkata. They are in top 3 according to me. Restaurant is well decorated. A huge takeaway counter is also there. Food costs ok according to quality. Paneer Tandoori i tried. It was really good. But Vegeterian people should try polau instead of veg biriyani.

Somewhat new Aminia joint with good sit down arrangement .

As usual great biryani , Rezala and chicken bharta taste . They serve some good moctails too which goes nice with main course .

The firni to end the full course was also quite nice

Aminia a newly opened bin rajar hat is a treat for people who cannot travel long to have a decent non veg. Food is of good quality , whatever ordered is a treat. Quantity is also good specially Biriyani. The ambience is also good big space and proper hygiene is maintained. For two people cost comes around 700.

Finally got a chance to eat at Aminia after waiting for someone to join me for completely non-veg meal. This place is located between City Centre 2 and Chinar Park crossing. Ordered their signature special Chicken Biryani, Mutton Resala curry and salads. Probably the most delicious biriyani I have eaten in town after ages. Still lots of other stuff on menu which are on my list and am gonna try in future. Went in for dinner, the Service was very quick and we were out within 45 mins. Must go in for their Biryanis.

We are vegetarians so were skeptical to go here. however they proved us wrong. Food was very fresh, just cooked. Served with very nice attitude. For veggies try Navratan Korma and mix veg they are amazing. Try to avoid the veg dum biryani, not that great. Must have is the rabdi with bundi laddo, its awesomest combination and really innovative. the rabdi is less sweet to compensate the sweetness of the bondi ka laddo.
I would say GO TRY THIS. You will come back for more.

Situated at the Chinar Park, Rajarhat, this place is another outlet of Aminia. I visited here last year along with family and ordered the following. 

1. Chicken Cheese Kabab
2. Chicken Biriyani
3. Chicken Tandoori Butter Masala

Well, the food here is okay-ish but definitely has something missing from its main counterpart. Staff are not attentive towards the customer. The parking facility here has a lot of problems between take home and dine in customers. Besides, a family celebrating birthday were present that day and took the central long table ( maybe couple of tables were joined in ), and most of the staffs were busy attending them only. 

Overall, could not give me enough satisfaction. Return on Investment - not worth. 

We might keep one thing in mind that spreading your business in the country citywise by openning more joints is a good idea. But one needs to take care of staff, behavior, ambience, facility and other things in mind too. Especially when everything comes with your 'service' tax.

Been here with my family and had ordered for home delivery many times. The quality of the meals here are mouth-watering and the quantity is just appropriate. Tried chicken biryani, chicken reshmi butter masala, chicken tikka masala and they were quite good. Properly cooked food and hygenic. The ambience is fine too. Menu rates are reasonable. Home delivery was quick and the items were properly packed. If you happen to visit rajarhat/new town, then this the best place to dine.

The Cost of food is Between Cheap and Medium Pricey. However the Food Provided is simply amazing, mouth watering delicious with very efficient service. There is also a Takeaway service and Rolls counter outside the restaurant.

Now coming to the food, Biryani & Kebabs are the specialities. We had Mutton Biryani and Galouti Kebabs. I Recommend everyone visiting to try these. Completely 'Shahi' :-)

The food is filled with goodness.
Had the famous Chicken Chap,Chicken Biryani,Chicken Malai Tikkas and Some Mutton Kebabs.
They also provide delicious rolls and shwarmas.
The food quality was above average,the ambience was good,the service was extremely slow though.
The kebabs were delicious,and so was the Chaap.
The Biryani was decent.
Although I hated the Tikkas.

Will visit again.

My Personal Rating is as follow
Food Quality: 2/5
Service: 1/5
Ambience: 3/5
Location: 4/5
Value for money: 2/5
This rating is because of their service. They have no respect to the customers and no value of their time. It takes too long to have your order on table. The taste is just like an ordinary restaurant but still you will find a healthy crowd of customers and I was surprised for this.

We ordered "Chicken Handi" and we got "Chicken Bharta" on our table. After questioning about this, they answered that "Chicken Handi" was not available. They modified our order without asking or informing us. 

If you are visiting this place I will suggest you to order your starter and main course in single order, because it takes almost half hour to get it on table. And if you think that you will order as per requirements then be ready to spend their at least two hours.

Beside all this their Ambience is quite well. Any kind of people or group can visit without hesitation.

This is the best branch of aminia among the city. After visiting soo many restaurants finally I got chance to taste"galauti kebab" in Kolkata which  is amazing. All the kebab lovers shuld go and try this.the most noticeable point is the ambience which is not only good  also totally different from the other branches of AMINIA.

Aminia is a house hold name in Kolkata and is very well known for its kebabs and biryaani. You go there any time of the day and you will see a hungry crowd awaiting.  This particular joint is not very old and is quiet big too. During its inauguartion the place was all lit up like they were celebrating marriage or diwali. Anyways let me go straight to their food.

I have tried their chicken rolls and they are nice. Nothing extra ordinary. The place initially claimed to server shawarma rolls but till date that counter has not opened up. Dont know why would they even publicize it. Their biryaani too is very over rated because i felt it was just any other biryaani. 

Next i tried their chicken cheese kebab and trust me i can go here again and again just for this particular dish. It was mind blowing. Very well cooked chicken and generous amount of cheese. Just melts in your mouth. But, unfortunately out of the 6 pieces one of the piece was actually a half boiled piece of potato dipped in cheese. CHEATED!! If you see the picture you will know. Aminia should check what they are serving to the customers. I know it gets over crowded but hello people are paying for the food they order so atleast be fair and check the items before serving. Unfortunately i had done a delivery so no option to change the plate but considering their experience in the food section they should be more careful.

Next i had ordered the chicken tandoori butter masala , keema hara dhania and roomali roti. The roti was good, soft and huge and even their keema was really nice and tasteful although quite oily but the chicken was just average. The whole tandoori taste was not there and it was tangy. Usually butter masala dishes dont go well with the typical tangy, sour taste so i thought the dish was a let down. 

Price i think is ok keeping in mind the market scenario.

I was at this place few days back. It was lunch time and the only thing which clicked my mind was mutton biriyani and phirni  as two very casual favourite menus for this name "Aminia". But gave a thought about finding something more and got the menu card. 
Ordered a sweet lime soda which is a casual drink i find for myself everytime  to quench my thirst. It was "OK OK".
RESEARCHED and decided on 
Mutton Galouti Kebab 
Chicken Kasturi Kebab as starters 

Mutton Biriyani as mains
Phirni as  dssrt 

STARTERS SERVED
Starters-- It was just perfect. Very beautifully cooked. Mutton melted in my mouth and Chicken dish was equally good too.

THEN 
Mutton biriyani --> delightful, mutton was soft and juicy. 

Phirni--> was nice.
THIS NEW OUTLET'S SERVING IS QUITE BETTER. THE PERSON INCHARGE OF THE TABLE WAS VERY RESPONSIVE. 

SHOULD TRY OUT AS ITS QUITE POCKET FRIENDLY AS WELL.

Biriyani quality has surely downgraded with expansion of outlets. The royal taste of Kolkata corporation outlet is not available here. But the one served is good enough to satisfy taste bud. Takes more than average time to serve. Firni is not very good. Tried home delivery too. Found that mutton quality is not very good in home delivery.

So, factually I was pretty much excited to find the Biryani giant coming up with another branch closer to our home. 
So finally on this day I went to pay a visit to this 'new but already popular' restaurant with

Writing this one after I visited this place thrice in a span of two months.
The food is good specially the biryani, which its famous for. The quality of meat they use in their preparation is commendable.
The sweet dish is quite good too. Just for the food it could get 4.3.
Now coming to service. The service here is downright shabby. The waiters are disinterested. One one occasion they even forgot to deliver our item when asked about it we were served the very same item which was kept for so long and went cold by the time we got it.
Not recommended if you are in a hurry or are hungry. Go only if you have plenty of time and are in a very good mood otherwise you'd end up having a tussle with somebody on the staff.

As requested, I changed my seat, as my seat was not comfortable & too much hot.
Got the food. But just take 1 spoon of mutton special biryani & found 1 hair on gravy. So interest come down.
Biryani taste is not good. Ordered chicken & mutton curry. Only mutton curry was little ok. But chicken was not good.

I dont know how to express awesomeness. I went with my friend to this outlet few days back. The decoration and ambience were nice . The staff were not so spontaneous due to the huge crowd. We ordered a cheese chicken kebab, mutton biriyani and mutton khada masala (a must have). To be very honest, it was very tasty. When i order a side dish from other restaurant, i generally get a taste of oil. The mutton khada masala was very delicious. Speaking of biriyani, trust me, you wont be disappointed. Good quantity and quality. Biriyani is incomplete without "firni", and they are great as well. So if you think, you will be going to aminia, make sure to empty your tummy, because you will want more. Hope this review was helpful.

Edit : I'm extremely disappointed from their service today.i used nearby coupons for biriani today,one of the coupons were added and the counter guy told me it had already been used,i was in haste but later coming home i found saw the details in my app and saw he redeemed it but did not provide the biriani for it.then i ordered a tandoori ckn butter masala,1st they gave me tandoori ckn on pointing out they sent the food back and came out the a box which looked like it was corrected.after opening at home there was only one piece of ckn on that which should have two pieces.

I dont know why this happened.i have been to this joint countless times,had good food there took home many times.
The management should look into it.i m expecting a reply from them.

The biriani here is better than the one in new market.and other items to..i have been here many times.as cç2 does not have a good resto inside it..

I will be very precise about this place that it has a huge set up of different counters for options to eat like kababs rolls biryani etc as well drinks juices or mocktails and all but the quality did have a set back for me as I was a bit dissapointed with the biryani as it was not smelling good and I have eaten better biryanis in the city for even half the price I paid here , now coming to the packing well that was very impressive with a take away box they dress up the food which was a plus point as it was hot and easy to carry so service was nice but the food did not satisfy me maybe I had a bad day at the resto so have to try once again to have a different opinion .

My verdict - ideal for big families but food might not satisfy from person to person it varies .

This sum up my dinner experience at aminia chinar park. Aminia is my all time favourite restaurant for dine out with friends and family.. but I must say that if in weekend you come up with a group of more than 6 persons then you need to wait for 45+ minutes for your turn to get tables. There is no suitable arrangement for a big group of 6+ people..

Aminia is a "heritage" name when talking about biriyani. 
Coming to the Rajarhat outlet, i opted for a take away rather than having a seat inside. The food has been improved much over the past period of times because in the middle it degraded drastically.

The biriyani was yummy and very tasteful with the meat cooked perfectly.
Aminia Special is a 'legend', needs no introduction.
 Reshmi or Tikka kabab, anything you opt is a treat to your tastebuds because it very juicy and soft.

Unfortunately, this was the only items i had during my first visit and their take away service is quite prompt and well-tackled as i went on a Sunday evening and waited only for 10 minutes.

Aminia Chinar Park at Newtown Rajarhat is one of the newest addition to the Aminia chain in the city. This franchisee is one of the biggest across the city and serves a lot wider variety of menu than some of the joints of the same ownership.

I had been there several times and also ordered few home deliveries. The food is as usual good. Quantity is sufficient ad per the unit. For example 1 platter of Biryani is sufficient for 1 person. For some dishes the oil is a little too much.

Place is very tidy and clean. Service staffs are mannered and some of them can understand English. Enough space and seating arrangement is quite comfortable. Well lit tables. Serving time reasonable and most of the time is bery quick like 5-6 mins.

Right across the Newtown Chinat park crossing it is situated around atms and other amenity stores. Vallet parking is available. Takeaway joint is right at the entrance of the store with sufficient seating for takeaway customers.

Only snag is is the location is not so good for late night stake out if youndont have your own transportation. Also the home delivery closes by 10-30pm. Early evening traffic can be a problem for you as rushbhour traffic is a sluggish in near the restro.

Dishes to look for is Mutton chaap, Garlic naan, tandoori chicken butter masala, and special Mutton Biryani.

The latest offering from Aminia for the people of northern suburbs. That itself is such a good news. I have frequented this place quite often, but has always opted for takeaways.The mutton rolls are to die for. The mutton biriyani is also very tasty and not very rich. I also tried the chicken kasturi kebaab which was mediocre. The takeaways system is very disciplined.

SHORTAGE OF STAFF!!

I was very happy to see an Aminia outlet very close to my house but its actually not worth it. It is a spacious restaurant with enough tables to accommodate 70-80 people, well decorated but they are running short of staffs. Its very frustrating to even wait for the menu to be brought to you.

I had CHICKEN KASTURI KEBAB for starters. I have had it before but I didn't like it here. The pieces were hard didn't have a specific taste. There must be some reason that their SWEET LIME SODA is not sweet to taste. For the main course we had BUTTER NAAN and MUTTON HANDI feels like same old same old.

The waiters are confused whether they have FIRNI or not. Someone says they have run out of stocks some one else brings it to our table. Also tried the KULFI WITH FALUDA. The desserts were worth it though.

Was so happy when I saw this outlet coming up in Chinar Park. Since opening I've seen the most crowded restaurant for the longest period. Everyday while coming back from office I could see long queues.  Finally decided to visit the place with my wife and cousins. Decor wise much better than the Newmarket one. However that place has its own memory for everyone who've been there. We ordered galauti kebab as starters. It was amazing. Then for the main course we opted for readily available biriyani. The food was real good and overall a nice experience.

This is the most recent addition to the Aminia chain in Calcutta. Located just ahead of the Chinar Park crossing, this is one of the most elegently decorated outlets by Aminia. It is quite big and well organized when it comes to seating and table arrangements. The ambience looks and gives you the feel of somewhat an elite restaurant but it actually ain't.

Food quality is decent but the Esplanade outlet is any day on top of my list. The service is nice but feels more like a dhaba than a restaurant. The prices are reasonable and with that I'd say that it's a good place for having your meals in a group or with family. They provide parking and the place is very much accessible.

I believe that more emphasis has been given on the decor rather than the legacy of what it serves..

4) Now Come To The Main Thing Food.... Really Very Much Disappointed With The Test & Quality. Still Arsalan Is Unbeatable In Point Of Food Test & Quality. 
5) Felt Price Of Food Is In Higher Side Respct To Test & Quality.
6) Limited Menu.
7) Presentation Of Foor Is Ordinary. Surprised To Got Masala Thump Up In Foam Glass. With Sepending of  Rs. 50-60 Can't I Expect At Least A Good Glass. 

In My Finding Aminia Has Spent A Lot's Of Money In Decorations With Compromise Of Food Quality & Innovation.

I have stayed in Hyderabad and have had the biryanis over there at different places.. I wouldn't compare these two. Both of them have a different taste and are definitely delicious. The chicken biryani here is served with a boiled potato (to my utmost surprise, because I haven't seen anything like this before). Small chicken portion though. But it just melts into your mouth. The staff here is not that great though and gives you the feel of a dhaba instead of a restaurant. Food quality is nevertheless brilliant.. Keep eating!!! Cheers!!!

Hi, 
I have a very serious complain against them. 
Yesterday I placed a bulk order for team dinner at office near 9 p.m.
During dinner time we found that one plate special biriyani was missing though we paid for that.
We have called Aminia Rajarhat, they said very roughly that can't do anything against that. After that one of my friend said it is their common practice in case of bulk order.
Either you find less pieces in side dishes or less amount of roti  or biriyani(1 plate missing).
Food was good. But think before you place a bulk order mainly for office.

Aminia is a very good restaurant in Rajarhat area. 
The kebabs are pretty good. I always like their biryani. Which is authentic mughlai biryani. 
You must try the tandoori chicken they make here. Also the kathi rolls are awesome. 

The firni is also very good.

Soooo..finally m writing a reivew for the new outlet of Aminia located at Rajarhat New Town..i was willing to go there because it is close to my home..i went there with my cousins for dinner..after our visit to Mother's Wax Museum we decided to have biriyani..and Aminia was a good option because they opened their new outlet..we were in hurry that is why we odered simply chicken biriyani,mutton biriyani and chicken kasturi kebab..honestly i did not like the taste of the biriyani..kebabs were good..service,ambience and quantity of foods were good enough..decor was simple bt nice..many people were taking foods from take away counter..if u wanna go there,u can go..i don't recommend it..

The ambience is pretty average like all other Aminia outlets. Well I wont say I was pleased by the staff approach and service but its ok. This place is a great value-for-money joint and should be tried out if you are in mood for some Indian spicy, super-tasty, not-so-healthy food.Their dishes simply look stunning, smells awesome and ofcourse tastes great.

This review has been written after trying out four times at this relatively new branch of Aminia, so there isn't much scope of going wrong on the evaluation part :-) Though all the four times I went in for home-delivery, so wouldn't be able to comment on the ambiance or service. This new outlet of Aminia is located close to my place and hence we try them out whenever we feel like. 

Location --- It's located near the Chinar park crossing on your left hand side (on the main road itself) if you are going towards the airport. It's a huge white building with Aminia boards all over, so you can't really miss it.

Call attendant's behavior / knowledge --- Person who received the home-delivery order was quite polite and knowledgeable about the food. Estimate provided regarding  the delivery time was also not misleading, overall he does a good job and handles the calls well.

Delivery speed --- It takes around an hour for the food to reach my place. To be noted - my place is just 2.5 kms away from this eatery.

Packaging --- All the dishes except kebabs are packed in white plastic containers. The packaging is pretty good and there is no biriyani rice, etc found in the plastic bag which carries these containers. Though sometimes found there is excess oil seepage from the containers having the side-dishes which is understandable but ofcourse messy. 

Food quality --- Till now from this place I have had Chicken biriyani, Mutton biriyani, Aminia special Mutton curry, Mutton Kakori Kebab, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Chicken Bharta. Let's talk a little bit about these items - I am always skeptical about trying out mutton biriyani since in most places the mutton pieces are a complete waste, but not here. The mutton piece in the mutton biriyani is extremely tender and very well spiced. I have tried it more than couple of times, so it is something really good. It'll be a crime if you do not try out their Mutton Biriyani. And ofcourse, you need to have Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala along with that, one of the best sides you can probably come across. The pieces of chicken are so succulent that you can not stop yourself from over-eating! And I guess if you really wanna have some great value-for-money starter then go for Mutton Kakori Kebab, but I'm not sure if you can control yourself just by having one single plate of this, since it tastes shockingly delicious, the kebabs are extremely tender and goes very well with the salad and green chutney. Also tried their Aminia special Mutton curry, it is a dish having one piece each of mutton, egg, potato, tomato, whole onion, sliced carrot in thin non-so-spicy gravy, this dish overall tastes okayish but has got a lot of excess oil in it, so I may avoid having it in future. The Biryani here is no-so-oily compared to many other outlets though the sides have got oil in them in generous quantity. 

Food quantity --- According to me the quantity served should be sufficient for a normal human being. Biriyani has got enough rice in it, one big potato and one piece of meat of your choice (mutton or chicken). Quantity of the sides are also good enough and as expected.

Value for money --- This place is a great value-for-money joint and should be tried out if you are in mood for some Indian spicy, super-tasty, not-so-healthy food. No extra tax is charged i.e. all the prices written on the menu card are tax inclusive. 

Their dishes simply look stunning, smells awesome and ofcourse tastes great. So overall - I highly recommend this new outlet of Aminia. Do visit them with your loved ones!

Cheers!

Aminia has always been my favourite while I spent my student and early work life at Park Street. I was indeed overwhelmed when they opened up their branch at Chinar Park. 

This one is quite spacious with 2 levels of seating and has a contemporary look and feel unlike its other outlet. The restaurant being close to my neighbourhood I frequent it for weekend dinner. 

The piping hot Special Biryani is my top favourite and trust me it indeed tastes superb. Aminia has one of the finest Biryanis in Kolkata.

I am not fond of side dishes with Biryani and I prefer Salad and Raita with it instead.

The Kebabs here are also splendid. Specially the Chicken Tikka Kebab...it has the perfect blend of spices and tastes awesome.

The Tandoori Chicken, Mutton Kassa and the Mutton Handi are also worth complimenting.

All in all the food is completely value for money and the cost per person does not make a hole in your pocket. Go for it if you have not tried it yet.

Came here on a weekend along with my friends for dinner. The place was crowded. Had to wait for half an hour before getting a table. We ordered for PANEER DO PIAZA, CHICKEN TANDOORI & TANDOORI ROTI. Food was tasty. Ambience was good but service was pretty bad. They were serving wrong orders on the table, as it was crowded. Their service was not quick. After taking the orders, the waiter took almost 1 hour to bring the food. Price was reasonable. 
Ambience 3/5

Went over to this place for dinner from City Centre 2 on the day of Saraswati Puja. The ambience was great and the food tasted really good. Even on that festival day,  the service was prompt and the food tasted up to the mark; not like those places where the food tasted bad just because they had to made it in large quantities on the occasion day. The waiters were well-mannered with us even after the tiring day.

Being someone who lives near the NSCIAirport, Aminia(Chinar Park) becomes a natural option for hunger-satiation, whenever the pocket's light... Nice place to dine after a family outing, or even a date, given that you have a City Centre less than a kilometre away... Now, I've seen a lot of people patronizing the Biryani here, something that's similar to appreciating potato chips in a bar(it's good, but it's not the best they offer)... Try going there with an adventurous spirit; try out something apart from the Biryani, and I assure you, you won't be disappointed...

Anyways, for the ratings, Ambiance - 7/10, Food - 8/10, Service - 7/10, Pricing - 6/10...

Dishes worth a mention: Chicken Cheese Kabab, The Tikka, The Reshmi Kabab, The Full Tandoori for appetizers... For the main course I'd recommend only one dish 'cause basically, it stands out from all the other dishes; that's the Mutton Handi, along with Tandoori Naan(buttered/non-buttered)... For desserts, I'd recommend a bowl of Firni, or The Kesar Kulfi, both of which are quite good... 

P. S. Get over the Biryani, guys... There's more to Aminia than that...

I was never a fond admirer of them, say it be aminia Esplanade or at there dum dum outlet. But when they opened a so big outlet I thought it to be different from the other but I found it to be the same.

If you prefer only the traditional biriyani and chicken tikka masala then you sure hit the right place but then when want to try out different dishes this place is a big no for that. Food quantity and quality both are average and service is not good aswell. The takeaway and home delivery is good though but then on a day when you plan to have a lunch or a dinner at this place, then I would suggest there are other good options then this.

This was my first visit to aminia..before this i had never been to aminia but had heard a lot about the 'aminian biriyani' from my peers and acquaintances. I got a delivery at my home from the nagerbazar outlet but had never got a chance to visit...luckily,my friend decided to give her b'day treat here. There were 4 of us,we went there for lunch. Though aminia from outside always at every time of the year looks crowded and queued,fortunately that day the scenario was simply opposite. We were readily seated after we entered the restaurant. The ambience was nothing special,though the seating arrangement was really comfortable. Not to mention,their washrooms were so small that it even became a problem to fit a person inside:-\
Anyway,coming to the food,we ordered 4 plates mutton biriyani,1 chicken reshmi masala and 1 salad. Order came real quick. The biriyani as usual tasted awesome,i even loved the chicken. The soft meat with a bit of sweetness really won my heart. The mutton in the biriyani was soft and tender. The quantity of biriyani was okayy...enough for 1 person. Chicken had 6 diced pieces which was really cooked well. Price was ok even..not on the higher side but not on the lower side even. There was a great hustle and bustle during the lunch time but i really enjoyed the food as well as the service. Loved aminia..definitely coming back again..next time would probably go for their kebabs!!

While zooming past the City Center 2 mall in Rajarhat, we thought of checking out this restaurant. So we packed a couple of chicken rolls and chicken biryanis. I loved the taste of each of those. The quantity and quality felt impressive. The day before we had visited Arsalan and did not have a good time there. Aminia seemed to give us some relief. Much better taste than Arsalan, loved every bit of the Aminia biryani!

I have visited this place on a Holiday. It was lunchtime, so as expected the restaurant was crowded, though within a minute or two we got the chance to get in.
The themed inside decor is beautiful but certainly not plush. The 4 or 6 seater tables were spacious but the 2 seater table where we were seating has space constraints, as we had difficulties while accommodating the plates and spoons.
We have ordered Chicken Cheese Kebab, Mutton Galauti Kebab and Chicken Biriyani as starters and main course. Among them the Chicken Cheese kebab deserves to have a special mention. The soft tendered chicken nurtured in burnt cheese was one of the best things I had in any restaurants. The Mutton Galauti Kabab was made of Mutton Paste, marinated with exotic herbs and spices and grill-cooked.
The Chicken Biriyani is good and carries the legacy of great Aminia Biriyani. We end up with one Shahi Tukra, the size of which is enough to be shared with your special friend. ;)
The servicing was average and maybe it's because there was a huge number of Diners at Lunch hour rush. The Bill amount was modest Rs.635 (1 Cheese kebabs, 2 piece Galauti Kebab, 1 chicken Biriyani and 1 Shahi Tukra) and it's good to see that the menu prices were calculated including the tax amount.
Certainly this is the best branch Aminia is operating in the city and it lives up with the expectations of foodies like us.

This branch of aminia is located in the rapidly expanding chinar park area, Newtown. Had been to almost all other branches. The biryani was nice. The kebabs were supple and juicy. But as an avid biryani lover, I am sorry to see that the unique taste of aminia has waned over the years. During our childhood days, we knew aminia (new market) = biryani. Alas! Those days are gone.

They have tasted success and are slipping gradually. I stay nearby and buy from them almost twice or thrice week. Most of the staff at the takeaway counter know me now. But off late the takeaway counter has stopped taking cards. It has become very very regular. Almost every weekend evening they say "sir card is not working" and they will always show a bunch of charge slips saying "it was working all day" !!! and will also promptly say that there an atm nearby. They simply want to cut down on customer handling time. I am sure that the time they give these stories to the huge takeaway clients, which has way lower opex, they cannot say the same to the dine in customers for a few extra bucks and effort. I will spread the word now as they have taken the crowd response for granted a way too early..

Laat Sunday I along with two of my friends decided to visit this restaurant.. This place always have been over crowded.. But to our luck it was empty when we went there though later on it was crowded and not a single table was empty. We ordered Chicken Tikka Kabab and Chicken Biriyani.. The chicken tikka kabab was brilliant.. soft and tender.. it tasted awesome.. Then we moved to chicken biriyani.. Though I'm not a very big fan of Aminia's Biriyani but I fell in love with this biriyani.. it was awesome.. This is 3rd outlet Aminia I have visited and this has been by far the best experience of Aminia for me..

This was my second visit to Aminia and first at this location. It was big family gathering. The food was sumptuous, although my pina colada tasted like sugary milk - avoid it. The mutton kababs were killing - loved em. Biryani was tasty and not at oil greasy. The best part is the 'valet parking.'
Verdict - A must try place on the way to the airport.

Well there was a sudden break from my boring college and ma and me decided to visit the wax museum near eco park to cut the boredom.  After an awesome time spent, we were hungry. And the best way to suffice it was go to city centre 2 and gorge on. But a local friend based at chinar park suggested that I should try out the new aminia joint ar chinar park. From what I imagined and what i saw was solely different.  I expected it to be some small dingy little biryani joint. But it was lavish. A grand restro indeed. The decor was awesome. The chandeliers and the spray glass paintings and the dome arch and the basic islam architecture just added to the theme of the restro. What I absolutely loved were the staffs.  They were amazingly fluent in whatever was best available out there. They were warm and courteous. Confused with the starters between chicken kasturi kebab or mutton galauti kebab, they suggested we should try their chicken kasturi kebab. I think I would rate it as one of the best kebabs that I have tasted. The supple flesh marinated with herbs and spices just let my tongue lull out. It is solely recommended. Then the main course had to be lachchha paratha and mutton rezala. The rezala was quite good. But the lachchha paratha was not what it should have been. I felt like I was chewing a gum which has been in the mouth for the past few hours. But what finally brought a smile to my face was the firni. It was amazing. I could not settle for one. Two of them I had all by myself. And the bill was enough decent. So good food at nominal rate is the catch line.  Definitely going to sneak peek back soon.

My friend and I went there for dinner on 1st Jan at around 9.15pm. There was a huge queue for obvious reason and we got our table after about 1 hour. We placed order for two plates of Special Mutton biryani, one plate of chicken reshmi kebab and a plate of green salad. The items were served pretty quick within 15mins. The kebab was okay, it tasted good though I feel that it could have been softer. The quantity of biryani per plate was very good. Qualitatively, I think there was much scope for improvements in the taste and aroma of the biryani though it was not bad. Overall the experience was okay but I shall look forward to the mentioned scope of improvements on my next visit.

The order taker is deaf first of all. In spite of repeated sayings he has taken less order. The Naans were very hard. Also the delivery was late due to which the food ordered was actually not at all hot. Infact there was no sign of hotness in the food when opened out of the aluminium foils. I don't think the restaurant people are professional enough to serve a better quality of food to the customers. Totally disappointed with the food yesterday.

Nice decent restaurant however pls order biryani if you want it quick or else the al-a- carte menu takes huge time. Menu is elaborate and affordable, average for 2 would cost you 700-800 Indian rupees.

As always it was crowded but somehow we managed to get a table.
The ambience was quit. The prices are reasonable but i wasn't satisfied with the quantity of the chicken biriyani and the piece of chicken was just a miniature piece.
But the Chicken Tangri Kebab balanced it out.

The service was surprisingly instantaneous.
At last the Firni was simply  delightful.

Really disappointed with Aminia's home delivery service.
Ordered special mutton and chicken biriyani with chicken chap. Mutton Biriyani was no doubt good. But Chicken pieces in both Biriyani and Chap were horrible. Biriyani rice had burnt smell. Even the potatoes were burnt black. Chicken chap had feeble chicken slices, with mostly bones. Gravy was too oily.

Visited Aminia Rajarhat today on Christmas,had a average experience.Food was more or less okay,we order Mutton Biriyani,Mutton Gulaiti Kabab,Tandoori roti,Mutton Rezala and Firni.Biriyani,Kababs was good but the Mutton Rezala was tasteless and Tandoori rutis were cold and not at all good.
Service is a big letdown.Manager and none of the staffs have any sense of etiquette.
Givving them 3/5 mainly because of poor service.Food is decent.

Well one thing is for sure that you guys got a perfect place for this restaurant. Biriyani is as always mouth watering. Good Decor and good lighting. The chicken and mutton are cooked perfectly. All the sides are not always good. You guys sometime add water in the drinks. But still one of the best biriyani you can get nearby.

This dec'14, when i went down to kolkata to visit my parents/sis, had food from this new outlet of Aminia.
Chicken biryani - as usual , the legendary stuff it is - the chicken was really tasty & the biryani was awesome :D
Mutton biryani was also great - the mutton pieces again were really tasty.
Paneer dopyaza was good - kind of karahi style.
The handi chicken seems to be the boneless version of their famed chicken champ - it was again great. Overall, nothing much to say ,except that if you are visiting the place ( around rajarhat) - plz visit this new outlet - its also pretty large.

Actually this place is quite close to my house, so had been there quite few times! For good moghlai dishes, I think this one is a must.  Try several biriyanis, trust me you will not be disappointed. I will recommend to try Cheese Kabab as well. Don't be afraid of getting too full, as this is the whole point of getting into Aminia.

One negative point is that their waiters are not always quite friendly. If you are accustomed with polite services of big restaurants, you will be surprised.  Even though they are far better than their Esplanade branch counter parts :)

Had been to Aminia Rajarhat yesterday for dinner. This is
quite near to my place but wonder why I missed it for these days.

The place is quite decent with comfortable sitting arrangement.
Service was courteous and prompt. Our food arrived by 15 minutes on placing the
order. The service managers are also informed about the food quality and
quantity and could recommend as per your liking. Had Tandoori Chicken as
starter followed with peas polau, kima matar, chicken tikka masala and
butter-nan / roomali roti. The food tasted good if not awesome. High on oil and
masala on the kima matar. Tandoori was good and was soft and crunchy. The pulao
was quite large for 2 people. Tikka masala was with 6 succulent pieces of
chicken and went very well with the nan.

Good experience for the first time at this place. Finished
off with ice-cream from the counter outside. However the photos did not do
justice to the dishes. Sorry for that. 

My rating would be :3.5 on Ambiance, 4 on Service, 4 on Food
Quality. I would surely put at 4 overall.

Would love to visit again.

They only understand Bengali language.. We ordered 1 chicken and 1 mutton biriyani,green salad and 2 cold drinks.. Chicken was not softly cooked and I can see the blood clots.. Mutton was average.. In taste it's - 3/5.. In cold drink we ordered thumbs up which served us in fountain it tasted awful cold drink mixed with water... Another experience of aminia..

Been here a couple of times, mostly after office while returning home with colleagues and i must say, they serve wonderful food that make your night a good night. 
The interior may look a little overcrowded in the evening due to the rush but it doesn't compromise in the comfort much. The place is nicely lit but the overall ambiance is just okay. Nothing special !!!
For the food I tried the tandoori and the chiken tikka kabab in the starters and they taste as heavenly as they look. Perfect combination of seasoning and spices.
The biriyani in the main course is good and the chicken is so moist and soft that it can be easily eaten with a spoon. You don't have to get your hands dirty to get the meat off the bone. I have tried the mutton biriyani once and to my dismay, the mutton piece wasn't good and didn't have enough meat in it. But that might just be my bad luck as my friends got all the good ones ;(Firni and kulfi are both good in the desserts section and really complete the meal.Looking forward to many more visits in the  future.

Refreshing change from the same old Arsalan biriyani. The biriyani tastes good but uses a bit too much hydrogenated vegetable oil! Quantity is decent. Chicken dishes are good. The ambience is better than Arsalan so definitely a good option for Mughlai flavours.

"Aminia"..The name itself gives me that nostalgic feeling,the post-puja shopping Pet-puja and from the name,what first strikes is AMINIA'S Biriyani.
And thus it was time to check out(eat up) the newest member of Aminia delicacy The Aminia,Chinar Park.
The perfectly boiled and seasoned rice, beneath that playing hide and seek,the perfectly flavoured mutton and you just can wait to dig in the plate and be mesmerized by the flavours Aminia have been offering us and to take the proceedings to an end,it was the perfect "firni" and all these for just Rs 200.
It just can't get better.

I'm not sure whether this is a franchise of the same name or a total different brand with the same name. :O
Yes the menu unlike the authentic one at Esplanade, had no option of Afghani tandoori, even the regular tandoori has been hiked up in price. The quality has not been compromised, and the dishes are awesome. Unfortunately was too full to order any main course. :-P
Yes, it's true that the menu features more dishes, on the contrary a few has been totally omitted.
The interior is much smaller, but nicely lit and decorated to keep up with the mood.
A good lunch is heavily recommended.

Guys, all that glitters is not gold; same way all those restaurants that shines bright from outside doesn't serve tasty & hygienic food to its customers......
This restaurant of aminia on the main arterial new town road has pleasant decor, its big & beautiful, probably the best in town, but made all our friends feeling sick right after we explored mutton biryaani & chicken chaap. We went through gas problems & stomach ache & we knew about the consequences right from the moment we started having our food. Oil & dalda used in extreme proportions to made the food taste good......If you are a foodie & has a good sense of acumen in food tripping, this place is definitely not for you.
They have specialised in interiors, but not in kitchen quality for sure.......its like a plush road side dhaba with zero knowledge in quality urban taste

I have been there with my family twice. the experience was worst ever.
whatever we wanted to order was not available apart from the simple biriyani and tandoori.
the service was not at all up to the level. every time they are giving excuses like the stuff is new or they have rush of orders.
they served us biriyani which was not warm at all. we ordered 5 plates but they delivered part by part. naturally we had to wait a long and even after that we had to share from my cousins plate.
this is really irritating.
there is no desert available.
any how we have placed order for home delivery there also they failed to delivered within the time they committed.
I think no one should ever visit this place.
better they can visit aminia diamond plaza or esplanade branch.

We have been this outlet on a weekday. We have ordered chicken tandoori,chicken reshmi kebab as starters. Tandoori chicken was good to taste; but was a bit oily. Reshmi kebab was good. The quantity was enough for two persons, chicken pieces were soft and garnished with copped onions. In the main course, we ordered mottun special biriyani, tandoori roti and chicken butter masala. Biriyani was not so well to taste. Rice were dipped in ghee. However, it contained two pieces of mutton, a half potato and a boiled egg. I would suggest you that don't try the biriyani. Tandoori roti and chicken butter masala were as usual to taste. I like to provide the following unbiased rating based on my experience:

food: 3/5
décor: 4.5/5
service: 4/5
hygiene: 4.5/5

Please do add Pudding to your menu like your counterpart at Esplanade did and try to start with home delivery asap, if possible launch your own website and facilitate us with online ordering; else what? Kindly try to continue with genuine cleanliness, hygiene inside your kitchen as maintained outside.

I don't like to have Biryani very much, but today I saw this outlet of Aminia and I could not control myself to step inside. Firstly this outlet is inaugurated just three months ago, seating arrangements are very much well organised, you'll find less crowded even on the prime evening time. I ordered a mutton biryani along with the chicken reshmi butter masala. But the waiter advised me to go for their signature dish chicken "something"(I forgot the name and could not able to find the name in this menu because this is very old) instead of Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. Which tasted very good but chickens were not so fleshy. The quantity of biryani is quite good, and a five star for the potato and mutton piece. I specially like potatoes in biryani. I did not know about the special biryani but according to their menu it mentioned "two pieces". Suppose two pieces of meat only. But a regular biryani does not contain an egg, alas! And finally I ordered a firni which makes me drool. Guys, if you hit Aminia next time, go for a firni. They say it helps to digest properly but the firni is just delicious. In comparison with Arsalan, Aminia is far ahead for the quality. So if you are a Biryani lover, don't think just go for it.

Aminia Newtown Rajarhat doesn't have its own kitchen , what ever kebabs we have ordered during lunch time around 1:15 pm all finished. We then ordered two plates mutton biriyani the waiter suggested that it will be too heavy for two of us stick to one plate !! We insisted for two plates of biriyani then they served but to my surprise there were no eggs in  it !! Waiters  have no interest in their work. As we r not staying in kolkata took some biriyani(parcel) for our children while going to airport . But again disappointed when we found,out of two boxes one has totally rotten biryani.

Aminia Rajarhat is the newly opened outlet of Aminia centrally located on Rajarhat Expressway. Unlike Aminia Jessore Road, the quality the offer still.remains good. The quantity of Biryani good.  Special Mutton Biryani comprised of 2 large chunks of meat (not bone), 2 large pieces of potato and an egg. Even the Chicken Chap they serve has better pieces of poultry and gravy. 
I am not getting into the quality as Aminia is alwaz impeccable. However Aminia Rajarhat stands out of the queue because they have not compromised on quality. Owing to overcrowdedness, Aminia Jessore Road has done away with with all quality control.

This was the first time that I visited Aminia and my first impression was quite good. Firstly I would speak about the food which is just fine. The best of the lot is tandoori roti. It's soft and kind of melts in your mouth, also don't forget to try the Mutton Rezala which is just fabulous! The biryani could have been better if it was a little less oily. And if you find time from devouring the delicacies, the interiors and ambience is fine.  Apart from the food, the staff is friendly and the service is quick. A must visit for all the north-indian cuisine lovers.

------------Update: 02 Oct'15------------
This was my 3rd visit to Aminia and day by day the quality graph is going southwards.

Ordered Chicken Tangri Kebab in starters, in main course had Mutton Biriyani and Lahori Chicken. Called it a day with Mihidana with Rabri and Kulfi.

Lahori Chicken and Mihidana with Rabri should be in one's list of must tries.

Service has been inconsistent, oily unwashed cutlery, presence in impurities inside bottled mineral water, uncooked meat in biriyani and pathetic valet parking options.

------------Update: 11 Apr'15------------
Second time visited Aminia and this time dine-in was the option. Went to first floor and must confess they have the best ambiance compared to any of their outlets or compared to their competitors like Shiraz, Arselan, etc.

The servers enforce to take us cramped two-seater table though more than half of the tables were unoccupied. Had to ask numerous times for water and menu. Till the starter was served on the table there was no cutleries or crockeries were provided on table. Once order was taken was taken food was served promptly.

In starters ordered Chicken Kasturi Kebab and Chicken Cheese Kebab. Kasturi kebab was average but no flavour of Kasturi my taste-bud sensed. Cheese Kebab was so succulent and baked inside tandoor with cheese layer on the top. Only problem is with the cheese quality made it too salty. 

In main course order Mutton Handi and Tawa Paratha. I found handi dish was slightly band but paratha was flaky. In fact for an average eater one paratha will be more than enough.

In desserts Kulfi is must. Final verdict my rating of 3.5/5 remains unchanged.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On my way back home bit surprised to find Aminia is less crowded. Always overcrowded and never had the tenacity to make my way to the counter through the ocean of people. So this time without giving second thought handed over my car to valet parking. 

But why during early evening sitting arrangement was closed? So had to go to take away counter. With an irritation asked for Galawati Kebab and Pasinda Kebab, guess what neither of their specialties were available. Not that it was over but not prepared for the day for this outlet. Without any option left ordered Mutton Kakori Kebab, Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala and Mutton Biriyani.

Kakori Kebab was sinfully tasty. Tandoori chicken was good but nothing to die for.Mutton Biriyani has again orthodox lucknowi taste but missed that zing. While ordering keep in mind there is another variant called Mutton Hyderabadi Biriyani. Finally, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala has to be best dish of the restaurant. So soft chicken pieces dipped in white creamy sauce.

Order took almost 30 mins though it was comparatively less crowded. Need to improve a lot on demand supply.

Note: If you want to have the real taste of kebabs and tandoori has to tasted fresh out of tandoor. Home delivery or take away spoils the freshness a bit.

It was a sunday evening, when me and one of my friend were searching a good restaurant for dine in.as this place is very close to my place sowe went there. The service is very poor standard, as we wait to give order for 15 mins. Then someone came and we ask them to give a special mutton biryani , one mutton handi and one butter naan, in desert as there were no options on that day we go for kulfi. Go with my words...muttons was not boiled properly in biryani. And we ask them a bowl to keep the oils from mutton handi.we took thatsomehow.My fruend suggested me to not to yake anyone to this place from now onwards. Its pitty. A very good chain in kolkata but they are unable to maintain their standard.

This is the new outlet of Aminia so I went there without much expectation but they proved me wrong with there delicious taste of food. We ordered tandoori chicken, chicken kastoori kebab, chicken tandoori butter masala , tandoori roti and fresh lime soda. Trust me each and every items they made were mouthwatering.

Went there with my friend on nabami evening. Had to wait long in the queue for puja but luckily we got a 2 seater within 5mins :). But what I must say that the security persons were very much polite & cordial, they were tackling the annoying public in the queue very generously.

Interior decorations, sitting arrangements & ac everything is fantastic. It has the potential to become a very good family restaurant, but they might try with some different lighting to make the place more charming.

Now, coming to the main part, food. We're in a hurry, so hv ordered green salad, mutton biriyani, chicken handi & firni. Food temperature,quantity and quality was very good. The biriyani was better than other aminias (new market, nagerbazar), mutton piece was pretty good but the salad was lacking cucumbers :(.

They are new & doing well. But, they need to maintain their service & quality. And if you are looking for best mughlai & biriyani destination in newtown/v.i.p road area then this is the place to hunt :)

Thought it will be as good as Aminia New Market, but we get dissapointed when found Biryani quality not as upto the mark. Staffs are good and more freindly with their guest. We tried Mutton biryani and kebabs. Kebabs are awesome but Biryani was not so good, Even the potato was not boiled enough. May be it is due to the durga puja rush. Anyway I will like to try another day.

As usual no big complaints can be done in the food quality department.But only thing I would like to mention is that I think the food is a tad bit overpriced in this branch.Besides I would also like to mention that the rates charts given here does not match the actual rates.Please update at once.

I went to Aminia Chinar Park Rajarhat which has made its debut recently. It's choc-a-bloc everyday in the evening. You need to be in queue in order to get seats. We ordered Chicken Biryani, Chicken Kasturi Kebab, Mutton Kakori Kebab, Garlic Nan, Mutton Handi, Firni and Fresh Lime Soda. We were 2 adults and 1 kid. It was more than enough for us. At last we had to pack the biryani and take home. Kebebs were one of the best I ever had. I am not sure about the Chicken Kasturi Kebab. It was same as Chicken Hariyali Kebab I had elsewhere. But nevertheless, awesome taste and chicken was very soft too. The best thing about that evening were Kakori Kebabs. I have a craving for it everyday. It was just awesome. Biryani was good too. Garlic Nan was just about perfect. Their service is also swift and good.

No complaints! Thumbs Up! I am planning to visit again. I have to try their Mutton Pasinda and Galawati Kebab.

***24/03/2016....Update***

I ordered food for home delivery. After 1 hour, I called up twice to two different numbers. None of them had any idea about my order. Very poor home delivery. I am going to change the rating. Good food should not be the only criteria for good rating.

We stopped by this restaurant on the day of Mahalaya, 2014! And truly speaking, it didn't disappoint us! For starters, we had Chicken Cheese Kebab. It tastes brilliant, super-soft and melts in your mouth (Mukhe dile gole jai-type!). But this stuff is very filing, so don't just keep on eating (specially if you are a biryani-lover). I recommend 3 persons/per plate cheese kebab! After that, we ordered the customary Mutton Biryani, which was awesome. If you are visiting this restau for the first time, you ought to try it! It definitely matches the quality of Arsalan's best ones! In side dish, we had Aminia special mutton curry (i forgot the exact name of the dish ) with shredded mutton pieces and nevertheless, it was equally good. The service was quite good, nothing to complain about. But it can be better! And this Aminia is really big and spacious! You'll love it! :)

Been there last sunday for take away parcel. We ordered for 1 special mutton biriyani one mutton biriyani and one few more mutton curries. First of all the mutton pieces in biriyani were all half cooked almost raw. I was unable to eat them finally had to throw the mutton pieces away. Biriyani taste was ok ok but not like the one in New Market area. The mutton curries were good. They were not like the biriyani pieces half cooked. Next time i m not goin to this chinar park outlet anymore.

"Not good enough Pakrashi, not good enough." For those who have watched the Bangla movie  'Baishe Shrabon', underlying meaning of this dialogue will be clear. Having moved into Calcutta after 7 years, I was delighted at finding brand Aminia in the quaint Rajarhat area. Drenched in rain on a muggy afternoon, we decided to give a break to house hunting and try biriyani. 
The ambiance is pretty huge with plush interiors and chilling air conditioning. From what I observed, afternoons are choc-a-bloc at this place, making the waiters work extremely slow and reluctantly. Our order came fast but the others were complaining beyond measures. 
We had ordered Mutton Biriyani and a plate of salad (charged extra, what the hell!). If you have read my previous reviews, you would know I'm a biriyani connoisseur and keep hunting for a good one. Aminia disappointed me hugely. The rice was bland and dry, with lots of garam masala and pepper. The mutton had been prepared with onion-garlic paste a long while ago and that made it hard and less succulent. There was no egg (a minus for me), but the potato was well done. Overall, a disappointment, our first biriyani in Calcutta after years.

No need for any introduction.From my childhood days AMINIA is always marked for excellent mughlai cuisine. But as it was located only in Esplanade so we got rare chances to experiece their delicacies.The new branch of AMINIA at Chinar Park is right in my location so I got the oppertunity to have them according to my wish.Nicely decoreted place with very friendy people willing to serve you the "Art of Mughlai Food"And I started with their Biryani, chaap, rezalaa and Kebaabs.The Biryani is changed what they used to serve at Esplanade specially the aroma. But still it was nicely crafted and wonderful to have them in your test buds...The Mutton Rezala was as wonderful as before so the Chiken chaap. And Kebabs? please dont wait for review and try as soon you can.

My first time in Aminia was worth the wait. I visited the Rajarhat branch. It is well placed at the junction of an arterial road, the Chinar  Park crossing. I went there to dine along with a couple of friends on a Sunday night, a couple of days after the restaurant opened its doors.

                       We had to wait for half an hour to get in which was a bit exhausting. My first  impression about the ambience and decor of the place was satisfactory. Our order was served without much delay. I did a survey beforehand about the dishes to go for. My list consisted of butter nan , paneer butter masala , chicken handi, kasturi kebab and chicken tikka butter masala. Many may be surprised with the absence of biriyani from my then ordered list but the mere reason was that I had already relished their biriyani sitting at home. The food was finger licking good though the oil content was noticeably on the higher side. Among these items, I would suggest you to go for kasturi kebab. We ended our dinner with kulfi which was sweeter than expected.

                      Pasinda kebab and chicken reshmi butter masala were amongst the items I did not taste but were good according to my friends. It is cost effective too.  My overall experience would certainly pull me back to Aminia to dine there again.

Any Kebab specialties are outstanding and world-class level! We additionally tried Biriyani and Curry items that were also good quality and taste. Very nice ambiance and quick service whatever you order! The cost are also reasonable for middle class people. Free valet parking really helps! This is now probably one of the best foodie choice and value for money in Chinar Park and City Center II areas with its brand-new, trendy, and urban-packaging on the century old Aminia concept.

This new Aminia restaurant started just few months ago and already it is flooded by gluttons and foodies alike from the area and beyond. I must say that as a resident in this area, it is quite a relief to have this restaurant. The mughlai dishes sold by Lazeez and Rahmania in this area are just do not have that touch.
So, on last Friday, I decided to take away some Aminia favorites for home. The turnaround time for the takeaway is reasonably well. I ordered Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Chaap, Mutton Tawa Chaap, and Chicken Kaali Mirch.
Lets start with the Kabab. Chicken Kaali Mirch is a spicier variety of reshmi kabab. The pieces were succulent and full of flavor. The rice grains used in the Biriyani is not as goos as in Arsalan. The Mutton Biriyani is yellowish whereas the Chicken Biriyani has streaks of yellow. It may be that the rice of the Mutton Biriyani was boiled in the "akhni" whereas for the Chicken Biriyani "akhni" was added before the dum. Both tasted quite different with Chicken one better. Chicken Chaap had its usual flavor, thick and grainy. It was good. The Mutton Tawa Chaap is a classic one. Bite sized muttons that had flavors upto its core and melts in your mouth. The taste was superb. Thanks to the chef in the takeaway section for suggesting it. Absolute must have.
Overall, the experience was quite good. I hope that they would correct the biriyani soon.

Aminia is synonymous to famous biriyani and galaiti kababs. We visited the Rajarhat branch for a quick office lunch and found the restaurant conveniently located at Chinar park right on the main road. We were 10 and wanted to seat together. Initially they didn't have any clue how to arrange the seating. After much deliberation, finally they joined some tables to make our seating arrangements. 
Coming to food, each item was too much soaked in oil. Rezala was too sweet. Nans were soft. Mutton in biriyani was soft and tender. Lunch was ended with firni and kulpi which were decent, nothing to complain about.
Overall ambiance was a bit chaotic, however the restaurant was clean and tidy.

This place is a boon for Biriyani lovers residing in the Rajarhat, Salt Lake side! The queues are generally huge but the wait is worth it. The staff, people taking the "Take Away" need to tone down their attitude. Don't forget, we are the ones who have made you guys a BRAND. Your wrong attitude will eat up your salary, so behave properly while dealing with customers.Food wise, no complaints, biriyani was good. The mutton chap had only bones (2 pcs), would be good if you provide some meat in the chap. Chicken chap was good, so were the kebabs.

1stly the location is fabulous,just at the Chinar Park Crossing. On my way home from office, suddenly decided to visit this place but not with empty stomach.  Friday late evening , it was full, so we have to wait a bit to get in.  Ambiance is classy, the management is very good. Our order was served very quickly. Coming to food , we ordered just Tandoori Chicken with fresh lime soda. Tandoori Chicken tasted nice, tender juicy and tasty. And the best part, its pocket friendly, they dont add service tax with the prices printed on menu card. I am really looking forward to visit this place again to have the main course.

My work means I travel often ..... unless its late night I use the Rajarhat Road for convenience to reach the airport. I was therefore rather happy to see an Aminia has opened up here. Now I can land .... pick up my Pasinda Kebab and Roti and head home to have a nice dinner when I arrive back after  a tiring trip .... no more tasteless sandwiches on the aircraft for me ! 
To be honest I have never eaten here always done a take-away ..... My recommendations are Mutton Pasinda Kebab , Mutton Chap , Mutton Kassa ( this one can be inconsistent in terms of the Mutton Pieces and quality but tastes good ) , Chicken Reshmi Kebab and Firni. I like their Tandoori Roti's best. The Biryani is decent but a bit oily and not my favourite I prefer to stick to the above dishes.

Went with my friends for lunch.  Having a decent enough decor inside. Ambience was very good. We ordered Tikka kabab and Tangri kabab for the starters. Both tasted good enough specially the tangri kabab. For the main course we ordered Mutton Biryani, Mutton Handi and Fish tikka butter masala. Briyani and Fish item was good but the Muttin handi was awesome. Mutton handi tasted really good and the pieces of mutton was so soft that it just melted in our mouth. Overall the food quality and taste was good enough. This restro is having valet parking.

Finally a decent option for the foodies near CC2.Waited long for the opening and the first weekend after the opening bumped to check it out.First the decor is pleasant with huge space.Had the signature Biriyani and Chicken Reshmi Kebab.I was a bit sceptical about the authenticity of the biriyani comparing to the new market branch But they matched it well.Far better in maintaining the brand quality than the jessore road branch.kudos guys,keep it up.

This Aminia is a branch of the Jessore Road Aminia as per the bill receipt. Been a fan of Aminia restaurant however this branch of Aminia has disappointed me a lot in the initial visits.

We went on a weekday for a light dinner at around 8:30 PM , most of the starters were out of stock by then . As they took the orders for Galauti Kebab and Chicken Cheese Kebab, however the waiter returned with an alternate option . Food was good undoubtedly however I couldn't enjoy the reshmi kebab as it was dry(more cooked possibly).

The most important disappointment happened when I stopped by at their fancy take away counter for a Roll order. I waited for the order for about 30 minutes ,and the serving guy kept me telling that it will be delivered in another 5 minutes  for 2 - 3 times, however was unable to deliver the same. Disappointed with this I got the token refunded at the counter.My question is if you are unable to deliver in a sequence why to open a TakeAway counter. Again yesterday I went for a take away and the care less guy at the counter told that Lunch will be available at 2:00 PM adamantly .There were 5-6 customers along with me who went for the take away and all dispersed with the statement.

Its the service that people will come for to a restaurant . It doesn't mean that being famous and unable to cater to customers will bring more name to the branch. I was happy for the Aminia branch close to my home again disappointed with the service quality.

Hope they improve the service quality in recent times......

The food palace is very tough to miss, situated right under the nose of the biriyani lovers. Though you may have to wait for sometime (if at night) to relish your already salivated tongue by the very fragrance from the take-away counter but trust me you won't even mind it as soon as you go in through the mughal-styled doors. The ambience is nice and as expected is always full of foodies waiting, ordering and gulping in the spoonful of biriyani or tearing apart the fleshy and juicy kebabs. and you are bound to feel the hunger a lot more courtesy the fragrance of biriyani and the staff does justice with the delivery time. Coming to food, the quality as well as quanity is awesome for both the special and normal biriyani. The kebabs are ready to give you the heavenly feeling inside you mouth and the chicken chap i had was so very delicious. In all the experience was good and i would expect a lot more from this place.

The Description: Newly Opened!! Just where i wanted.. near chinar park. and best place to open near the City Center.
Aminia did not need any intro as all knows about it...

The Ambience: They have really made it big. Good looking ambience with lots of tables and full a.c. Staffs are good and service is also nice. Roll counter is outside with the parcel counter.
Bought Biriyani parcel today to have a taste..Beginning from the packet so They packed it in plastic container and that made it worst.  

The Food: The whole biriyani was mixed just like khichdi. A big potato in that small container to less the rice quantity. Secondly it was so oily. Just felt as biriyani of any other small biriyani store. Very disappointed. Coming to the taste so it was good but according to the Aminia Standards its really 2 out of 5 thou i given 3. 

The Conclusion: Therefore, this 1 biriyani dosent affect my expectations from Aminia.. Hope next time it wont happen again.

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

23RD OCTOBER 2015.

Finally a visit to this place with family for Dinner.

The place is very good. Place is big and interiors are very good. Lighting are too glowing well. 

Staffs are well behaved. Very quick to your service and attentive as well.

We had CHicken Biryani to begin with followed by Chicken Tikka Butter Masala and Butter Nan.
Chicken Biryani was as usual very good and chicken was also well made. The Potato was missing in my plate.

Chicken Tikka Butter masala was tasty as well.  Gravy was thick and smelling well, Butter flavor was found inside the gravy.

Nan was good. Soft and crunchy somewhere. But i think the pieces should be more big.

Chicken Biriyani 8/10
C.Butter Masala : 8/10
Nan: 8/10

Quantity of biriyani was good. Quality was nice. Prices are a factor here. A bit higher from other restos.

Will visit again for some more food items.

The only issue I had was with the behaviour of the Serving Staff &Take Away Counter Staff, they obviously dint semm friendly to me.

Very very nice indoors..surprisingly spacious than expected..the staff is fantastic..very good when comes to knowledge and management..more importantly they are very helpful in selecting the menu..the seats are cramped up..but okay..felt very good to see when i went last sunday more than 40% of the customers are elderly people or senior citizens..even they are attracted towards this place..that's inspiring..
Okay food..kebabs are lying somewhere between okay and good..they serve hot and fast..biriyani is mediocre and in very less quantity..that's not good..phirni is awful..separate cold drinks are available...another shocking thing everything in the menu is never available..then why a menu card if more than 50% of the stuff is not available..buckle up..but still its good enough for a family outing..the tak away center for snacks is also good..nothing to brag about but good..

P.S.- the place is very overcrowded so you have to stand in the queue for even hours..

As its a popular restaurant chain, located in 6 to 8 locations in kolkata, we  think of trying out their food in their newly opened chain which is in Chinar park, rajarhat. Restaurant view is quite impressive with glasses, mirrors, live kitchen & tandoors at the entrance which creates an early impact of food for its fragrance & aroma. one can easily get mesmerized after going through its menu and pricing. we were three in a group, ordered for fish tikka, chicken tikka, chicken biryani & mutton afghani korma, taste of the kebabs were good, but coming to biryani and mutton afghani korma, its a disaster. I really doubt about its freshness, mutton was fatty,  enriched with rose waters and all, a typical flvour which I couldn't have. it was oily too. I really felt bad as the food here cannot be comparable with the other aminia chains at all.

Aminia, Chinar Park – A pleasure hut for gourmands!
A few days back, I went to the Aminia branch near Diamond Plaza.
I had prodigious expectations as I got some very good evaluations from my close and far contacts, but I was not pleased with them.
Today after watching a great flick at City Centre 2, I decided to go to the newly open Aminia at Chinar Park.
As usual, it had got a home delivery facility and a minor counter for the rolls and other appetizers.
But the outside environment was much enhanced than the DP one.
There was a queue and we waited for about 20 minutes.Then we entered the restaurant and the décor caught me. 
It was incredibly designed. +5 for the ornamentation only.
We were kindly greeted and offered a menu.
I had no beliefs about the food after the previous week’s Aminia experience.
Anyhow, from the whole bunch of delicious looking menu we ordered
i) Mutton Special Biriyani 
ii) Chicken Biriyani
iii) Chicken Handi
iv) Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala
v) Peas Pulao [ don’t freak out, we went during Janmashtami and my mom is not a chicken devotee ]
vi) Dal Makhani

Now,
Veg
v) Peas Pulao was pleasant.
vi) Dal Makhani was below average dish for me. But my mom loved it. Actually there was no onion in that, maybe because of Janmasthami or any other purpose. My mom was really happy savoring that.

Non Veg
i) The Mutton Special Biriyani was fabulous. The flavor was first-rate. The Mutton was so soft and juicy. We solely loved it.
ii) Chicken Biriyani was okayish. I had better Chicken biriyani is elsewhere.
iii) Chicken Handi – Quite Good. It went really well with the Biriyani.
iv) Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala – HERE CAME THE BLOCKBUSTER! I would love to stopover by Aminia anytime to taste this particular dish. Awesoooooomeeeeee, to be accurate!

I wrote the non-veg selections at last, just to make the climax superior. Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala was the climax. So, the food was really worthy. I was really surprised to get such wonderful delicacies from Aminia, after that particular dreadful dine at the DP branch.

Advantages :
FOOD!
The décor
The service
Cost-effective
Disadvantages
The waiting period

I really adored this Aminia and I would unquestionably visit it again and again. 

4.5/5

I visit at Aminia a lot so I'm also mentioning the other menus I tried.

Rumali Roti - Well Made.
Paneer Dopiaza - Good. The Paneer was soft. 
Lahori Chicken - The gravy tastes amazingly good. Loved it. Must try.

The new edition of the famous Aminia family - in one line this outlet is good in its decoration, interior, n servings. It was my first visit - we were 6 n had tandoori chckn, chckn reshmi kebaba, mutton seekh kebab as starter. The tandoori chckn was awesome, mutton seekh kebab was brilliant, and the reshmi kebab was just out of the world - it was so soft that even my belated 80 yrs granny could easily chew it (love U Thamma) - let me correct myself there was nothing to chew, it just melted like marshmallows:) The starters correctly played their role in building our appetite for the main course - mutton biriyani, butter nan, mutton kasa, chckn butter masala, shredded mutton in gravy (sry I forgot the name). If I mention any gravy item first it wud b injustice to others - all were just superb. The biriyani was good - quantity was huge n juicier than the one served in new market outlet. Naan was soft n large.
The place is worth of visiting again n again. But I personally missed the grandness of the new market outlet - the tables around the round pillars, the ever receptive Chachas, the storage n serving area at the ground floor n many more. You will have an aroma of luxury n modernisation in this new outlet, but I guess a meal at the new market one is not only a pleasure for our taste buds, but also a journey in a time machine towards the great culinary skills of mughal era. Still its good that this master pieces of Kolkata cuisine (Aminia, Shiraz, Arsalan, Royal) are venturing in new outlets n we the gourmets have enough opportunity to fulfill our gastronomic needs:)

Biryani bad, service slow. Very new, may be we need to revisit after few months and then decide if it is OK or not. But first impression is not good. Restaurant is new and big. But what disappoints is that it is not satisfying the taste bud and service is sloppy. So, kind of disappointed as a whole.
