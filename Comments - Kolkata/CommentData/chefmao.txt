Chef Mao is one of my favourite take away for Chinese foods. I often order through Zomato app. Most of the time I order a veg combo meal and I love their hakka noodles. Their chef’s special Chilly Basil Fried rice is also a must try.

For evening snack or for house party menu I often prefer their French Fries with Chinese Dip, Wings of Fire and Walking Street Fried Satay. Wings of Fire is really super hot and spicy and every time I have it from Chef Mao, I fall for it. Price is reasonable, so, house party happens often!

I’m not a foodie and I’m very choosy about tastes. I just don’t like experimenting foods from different places. Whenever I eat outside, I prefer to go to some older, authentic places. But the last weekend I experienced something new. 

I visited Rajarhat City Centre (CC2) with my friends last weekend for some window shopping and mall hopping. Eating out was undoubtedly a part of the day out. But I was really confused hearing them talking about the take away food junction Chef Mao. I didn’t want to try from a new place. But my friends insisted, and YES, I like that they insisted! Otherwise, I would have missed the really tasty food. 

With lots of confusion I ordered steamed dimzoom and hot & crispy baby corn; and...I LOVED IT! It was really mouthwatering. I’m gonna try some more soon.

Ordered veg and chicken momos, crispy baby corn and pop chicken lol. Momos had a quite nice portion of fillings and tasted good, much better than wow momo. I was looking to order wings on fire, however, could not find it in zomato online menu. A request to the management: please add it to zomato online menu. I am looking forward to ordering some main course soon.

I often visit CC2 for quick shopping, watching movie or to just chill out with friends. But whatever the reason is to visit the mall I never miss to eat something. Though the something may include a lot. After all. I’m a foodie. 

There are loooooots of food stalls, restaurants, casual dining even a food court inside the mall, but I have some favourite among them. Chef Mao is one of them where I really love to eat. Though they are a take away counter but there’s enough place to sit and enjoy the food in CC2!      

I love Chef Mao’s chef’s special chilly basil fried rice and chilly chicken combo. And in the appetizer, crispy chilly baby corn and the fire of wings are just yummm...Love the hot and tangy tastes!

The stall is located near the back gate of McDonald's. Ordered hakka noodles combo (non veg), the combo was served in a rectangular box which was nice. The chow and chilli chicken was delicious. Also the gravy was too tasty. The staffs are attentive.

Chef Mao is a nice place to take away some quick bites while returning from office. Even in some lazy evening their hot tastes make the leisure pleasurable. I often order through Zomato and get the food delivered faster than the expected time. Delivery service is very prompt and packaging is good. They deliver fast but never lack the quality. 

It’s rarest of the rare condition that their quality lacks. I really trust the Chef Mao chefs and love the tastes. My personal choice is their Chef Special combo of fried rice and paneer with the coke and for my lazy evenings I prefer crunchy veg roll, french fries and veg pan fried momo.

I am not a vegetarian but I love veg foods. If the veg item is from Chef Mao, I love it more. I often eat their Schezwan Veg Noodles and with Hot & Crispy Baby Corn. I love the spicy hot taste of the Schezwan sauce as well as the tangy taste of the baby corn. Their special Fried Rice also one of my favourites. Their Momos (dimzoom) are also very tasty. 

Once I tried their Tandoori Chicken, it was good but not exceptional. I also have tried their special sweet which was also a good one. Though the price is li’l high including the GSt, but I love their quality and quantity. Recommended!

This is just a take away joint but if you wish to eat then and there then you will have to sit on CC2’s concrete sitting blocks set up for general public at large. The menu is not vast however you will find good combos to  supress hunger strokes. I stopped by to do just that(was dying of hunger) so quickly ordered their momos . Mind it i am a big fat momo lover and most places esp.those which arent authentic are on my hate list. But chef mao surprised me with their quality. The chicken momos were nice and moist and well knit. It wasn’t falling apart. The taste was good and the stuffing too was good. The dips were nice but definitely not anything like the ones you get in the hills. On request the server gave me an extra chilly dip which was ok but it was sweet of them to consider my request. Everything was good except the quantity. 5 piece for Rs.84. Just an odd number. They should revise it to atleast 6 .

Over all good food and visibly doing good business.

When several restaurants are giving their efforts in making their presence prominent in the food scene of Kolkata, Chef Mao came into the limelight by showing their creativity in the authentic Chinese and Tibetan foods. 

Though this takeaway outlet is pretty young, yet it has won the hearts of all Chinese food lovers. It is welcoming the foot fall slowly but steadily not only due to its endless food combos but also because of their reasonable prices. 

Last night, we five friends had a fine dining just because of this joint. While returning from CC2, Rajarhat, we all were starving. One of my friends suggested to order food from Chef Mao. We agreed and ordered accordingly. As we all were new to this outlet, we decided to seek suggestions from their chefs. After asking, we came to know that they are quite knowledgeable about the food they deliver. The food which we ordered there were DimZoom Fried Non-Veg, Schezwan Noodle, Schezwan Fried Rice, Chef’s Special Hot and Crispy Baby Corn, Chilly Paneer and Fountain Coke. 

DimZoom Fried Non-Veg had a crusty layer and tender and juicy chicken inside. Chef’s Special Hot and Crispy Baby Corn were no less delicious. It was cooked in Chinese style and were crispy enough to give your taste buds a rollercoaster ride. Then, we ate the stomach-filling Chicken Hakka Noodles. The Noodle was loaded with big and soft chicken chunks. Apart from it, other assorted ingredients in the dish were fresh. 

Chilly Paneer, though was a common dish yet it was made unique by the chefs. It was bit spicy and hence, we all loved it too much. Moreover, it was working as a great side dish for Chicken Hakka Noodles. Their consistency in quality and quantity is making them gaining customers. 

I am looking forward to order again from this restaurant. Courteous staffs and budget-friendly price are two major factors that add to its popularity. They may not have a seating arrangement yet if you taste the Chinese dishes from there once, you won’t mind ordering food from this outlet only.

Takeaway joint under the roof of a shopping mall is not an innovative concept. Yet what is especial about this eatery is their wide range of Tibetan and Chinese food combos. And, it is due to these outstanding combos that they have managed to gain a strong dominance in the gastronomic world.
Few weeks ago, I went to CC2 of Rajarhat to do some puja shopping. As after the shopping, I got tired and had no energy to cook food again at home, I decided to order some food from a restaurant there. My family loves to eat Chinese and Tibetan delicacies. So, I went to Chef Mao to order such dishes. One great thing about this joint is that you won’t have to wait for long to get your food delivered. Besides, their staffs are friendly too. Foods which I ordered there were:
Schezwan Rice (Non Veg): It was bit spicy to my taste buds. Tender chicken chunks, soya sauce, and crushed sichuan peppers were adding to its Chinese authenticity. The steamed rice were fine and non-sticky. This Indo-Chinese cuisine itself had such a superb taste you won’t mind eating it without any side dish. 
Schezwan Chicken: This, according to me is an awesome Chinese appetizer. Being mildly spiced, it was loved extremely by my kids. Moreover, its unique and distinct aroma and flavor will make you crave for more.
Tandoori Chilly Chicken: The soft chicken pieces had absorbed the flavors of different sauces nicely. Though it was well spiced yet it was light on our palate. Tasting it was like an elixir of life for us.
Walking Street Fried Satay: Walking Street Fried Satay was an innovative dish for me. I have never tasted it in any other restaurant. It is surely recommended to all the Chinese food lovers. Its crispiness will definitely impress you.
If you have a strict budget, and yet want to try some authentic Chinese and Tibetan dishes, then consider visiting this restaurant at least for once. Just place your order and start to enjoy the food in no time.

If you’re a lover of Southeast Asian cuisines, then you’ll surely love the food of Chef Mao. Their Crispy Chicken Babycorn is my favorite piece of Indo-Chinese food that I’ve ever tasted. All their dishes are available at pocket-friendly prices. Both quantity and quality of their dishes will exceed beyond your expectations. This is an outlet that will give you the much-needed food break between your shopping sessions at CC2.

Chef Mao, located at the ground floor of CC2of Rajarhat, Kolkata brings array of flavors from China. I went there on Saptami Puja after pandal hopping with my friends. However, it offers only delivery service. As we all were crazy fans of Tibetan and Chinese cuisines, we preferred this restaurant over others.
Though I have tried this eatery several times, yet every time its dishes were like delights to my taste buds. Some of the foods which are outstanding here are Chicken Fried Wanton, Chilly Garlic Noodles, Chilly Basil Fried Rice, and Chef Special Chicken. Their Chicken Fried Wanton is way too superb with crispiness on outside and juicy chicken inside. Chilly Garlic Noodles which is a common Chinese delicacy was made extraordinary by the chefs of this retaurant. It was having a dominant garlic flavor which was carrying the authenticity of this Chinese cuisine perfectly.
Chilly Basil Fried Rice has assorted several fresh ingredients which were enhancing its taste. Oyster sauce mixture, bell paper, and chicken in the dish was simply amazing. Chicken pieces inside it were so tender that they were melting in the mouth. Besides, their Chef Special Chicken was a dish to die for. This is certainly highly recommended to all the chicken freaks out there. It consisted of 6 pieces soft and big chicken pieces which were well seasoned and nicely cooked. The ingredients used in coking it were balancing the taste perfecly. It was a perfect side dish for Fried Rice. Besides, their Desi Wok Burger also deserve some appreciation.
All the dishes were nicely garnished and packaged well. When we unboxed the dishes to start savoring it, the fresh smoky flavor impressed us. With a single bite, we were sure that the dishes were fresh. Both in terms of quality and quantity, they are good. Services of their staffs are prompt and they listen to the orders of the customers with patience.

Visiting this eatery means having yumm dinner after a fun-filled shopping experience. The food available there are budget-friendly and are sure to impress the gourmets with their freshness, quantity, and reasonable prices.

From their long menu list, we tried Chili Garlic Non-veg Noodles: Spicy with the dominant flavour of garlic. Yummy and stomach filling, Manchurian Chicken: Full of flavours. Was cooked exactly in the Chinese style. Chef Mao Special Non-veg Rice: Excellent and has a unique taste. Properly seasoned with spices. Loved your service. Will order from here again soon.

Yesterday me with my friend visited there and tried their 'Fried Chicken Wings' .
The staffs were very professional but the service was very slow.
Now coming to the food, 6 pieces of perfectly fried crispy wings served with a red spicy sauce.But the chicken was tasteless and seemed to us frozen and the batter on the wings had no seasoning at all.
All their items were very reasonably priced.
An average experience for us.........
