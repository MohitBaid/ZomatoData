Ordered American Chopsuey and Crispy Baby Corn. American Chopsuey had prawns that were not cleaned properly, and the food was cooked in dalda. Amount of food was good though. Taste was ok too. But felt almost sick after having food there.

My mom and I went to have lunch there. We were pumped up after seeing the menu here. However we were presented with a menu which can found at roadside food stalls. The ambience was good. Foods were okayish. They were overpriced however. If you're driving and want to have a quick lunch, this place won't disappoint you. If you're a foodie, ignore this place.

After along drive we stopped at this place.We ordered fried chicken drumstick,garlic fish,chicken fried rice.The food was good no doubt about it.The chicken gravy chow is just too good.And I was amazed to see such alot of dry fruits on the ice cream!!A true value for money.
