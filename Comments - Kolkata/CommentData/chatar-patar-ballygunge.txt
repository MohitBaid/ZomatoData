Located near park circus 7point,This is the best place to grab chaat's.
I ordered delhi papri chat and delhi dahi bhalla (doi bara),which was really delicious.One plate chaat costs ₹50-60 on an average and is more than enough for two persons.The packaging and service was quite good.Their special dish is zappi.

Awesome food, great snacks, tasty and hygenic. Friendly and cooperative staff.  Customized food as per your taste preference (Ordered On-line) ..  Tried almost all the times very frequently and all the foods lived to its names and expectations "chatar patar" (Especially chats, Bhels & Zapi were awesome. Pasta,  Maggie and sandwiches were also great.  I would recommend this outlet to all for small get togethers,  birthday parties and people who likes @munching on the Go..

The curd was completely awful and of the lowest quality. If anything happens to my health who will be responsible? Please make note of it and try to serve better.

Gobsmacking vegetable food around Ballygunge. Ambience isn't too bad either. 
What we ordered : 
1. Chola Kulcha(3.5/5) : A bit too spicy for my taste. But palatable. 
2. Pav Bhaji(4.5/5) : The Bhaji was a little too spicy, again. Unnncessary, doesn't add to the taste. 
3. Delhi Papdi Chaat(4.5/5)

A perfect snacks is difficult to be defined. We think of  a light yet healthy n tasty food. Still anyhow Wateva we eat .. we neva get satisfied.
 Thinking of light pocket bucks yet fulfilling snacks, chatar patar is best u can think of.
 U get sandwiches, many types of flavoured drinks, bhel, chat, wraps, idli, chat cum pizza, pasta. 
I ordered one Delhi bhel papri chat, cheese corn wrap known as zappi, and virgin mojito.
 Total cost - Rs.235 
 The amt was plenty for two and very tasty.

The best street food i ever had in the city of Joy is here. The range of food from Chatizza (Pizza+chaat) ,Zapi ,Range of Maggi (viz.Tandoori,Schezwan) will keep you salivated. The flavours with phuchka/golgappa/gupchups (Thanks to their interiors i came to know so many names of the types of street food) left me flabbergasted. Improvement quotient will be sitting capacity.Service will be better if it's less time consuming.

This is a place that can boast of a robust snacks menu none of which burns hole in pockets. But if that is not the only criteria, the food largely disappoints. Many of its sandwiches like sandwich mexicana or the schezwan zappi wrap are products of Indie cuisine style. Beneath the bread and cheese,its all desi garnishing. Even the corn mayo sandwich wasn't fulfilling. The only item that was a tad savory was the virgin mojito. Again, no soda and more than enough sugar - but it's still refreshing.

Good for quick bites. Went there in the evening to have my tummy filled but was shocked to find a child employed for cooking, serving and cleaning tables at the store when child labour is strictly banned in our country. I can't expect much from street vendors but was shocked to see a brand encouraging such malpractices. Also very uncomfortable seating arrangement.

Chatar Patar is my ultimate savior on days I am craving chaats and bhels.
I have tried almost all the chaats they offer and cannot badmouth a single of one of their offerings.
From the Delhi papdi chaat to the classic bhels, finger licking good!
Apart from the chats and bhels they have chaatiza and zappis beating the conventionality pizzas and wraps.
The tandoori maagi though is all things foodgasmic!

I generally order food online from the outlet and recently tried the Mexican pasta. Amazing is the word for it!
A big thumbs up but there is always more room for improvement.

Awesome street junk, value for money portions. Zappi is a must try dish here. Tandoori Maggi leaves an eccentric flavour to the mouth. Such lovely delicacies goes down well Paan Bahar. Pocket friendly price points. Only improvement can be of the increased seating capacity. However who cares for sitting.. When you want to gulp down Gupchups! ;)

Service is really good. We tried different kinds of maggi including tandoori maggi, cheese maggi, maggi chaat alongwith various other items. This place is very pocket-friendly and can also fill your stomach with the quantity. :) Surely going to visit more often.

Have eaten here, it's a small joint but clean and well maintained. Have had the food home delivered at home via Swiggy as well several times. Excellent for snacks!!

The phuchhkas are excellent. They are crisp, the aloo filling is mixed well with spices and the paani is very well prepared. My faves are the mirch and Khatta meetha ones. 
They make amazing Dabheli, chaats and sandwiches. 
The preparation is very hygienic and the packing is spill proof. Prices are dirt cheap compared to the high quality of food.

Recommended for street food!

Discovered this place on zomato and ordered via zomato delivery. 

My order- 

- Mexican zappi, which is an Indian version of a quesadilla. It was tasty. Filled with mayo, onions, spicy Mexican sauce and corn this dish was good.
- Chola kulcha was delicious! The chola was made pindi style and the kulcha baked well. Though one kulcha per portion is too less a portion.

The prices are reasonable and food was hygenically packed. 

Overall, pretty content with my order. Will definitely visit personally again to try more dishes.

First things first, the place is in a very small area and its very easy to miss it. So pay attention while you are looking for it. Also, there is space for only 4 people to sit. So coming to food now. I had heard a lot about this place from my friends and I was dying to visit this place. So I had high expectations from this place. Luckily, it did live upto those high expectations. Everything that we ordered was perfect and true to the taste it should be. We started with puchka and I must say, i seldom like it with sour water but the one provided by them was one of those instances when I liked it. So it must be something. Exactly in the Delhi style, it impresssed me at a level of 4 on a scale of 5. We next tried sev and dahi chaat. Dahi chaat was just excellent. Off the charts taste and loved it a lot. After that it was the time for their famous tandoori maggi. And they are not wrong to say that it is their speciality. My God it was great. The quantity was perfect, and the flavour complemented the original taste of maggi. The only way they could have made it any better is with some cheese. In terms of flavour it was excellent. And along with all this food we had oreo shake with us to complement food and quench our thirst. I wouldn't say it is the best orea shake I have ever had, but it's definitely in top 15. Finally the last two items for the evening arrived. The garlic cheese sandwich and Italian Zappi. Well Italian zappi was just fine. It had too much mayo flavour and that's why didn't quite like it. But the sandwich, that was one hell of a sandwich. It was filled with cheese and had an amazing flavour of cheese and burnt garlic. I really loved it. All in all it was an amazing experience. Time well spent and today I am going again cz I just loved the sandwich.

Food 4.5/5

Value for money 5/5

Cost for 2 - 350

I had ordered chilli cheese garlic maggi, mexican Zappi, Maggi Golgapa ( which sounded completely different to me from all the varieties it had) 

I look forward to order from Chatar Patar when I really want to have good food and have budget constraints because no place can offer more satisfaction to me.
Worth it money!

Post average weekly orders - hv come to the conclusion these guys do not read the complete instructions - special mentions of non-spicy food is Latin to them - even after calling & ensuring - delivered food is not palatable

Have become a fan of this place - took me ~ 4 months + regular orders to come to this status. Amazing assortment of street food - classic bhel, dabeli, chaat are really good

Zero consideration to the instructions of the customer while ordering. Ordered pav bhaji - non spicy. The delivery was so spicy couldn't eat - wish they read this review & correct so no one else faces similar situation. Am still trying to recover from the initial biting to the food. 👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿👎🏿

Had recently visited the place in the hunt for a Dabeli. The Dabeli was just fine , nothing extraordinary but not bad as well. During my visit had even tried the Corn Gapagap(puchka), which was a dry puchka stuffed chat and the Cheese Garlic Maggi. The puchka chart tasted really well and garlic Maggi lived up to its name.
The only problem was that the place was understaffed during my visit and service was very slow. Overall they serve good Street Food in an hygienic environment. Almost forgot the place is very reasonably priced.

I have ordered food from this place many a times, till date i don't knkw the exact location of it. Its a newly opened place but is quiet hyped.
No idea about interiors and all, but their food is something which satisfies tastebuds. Their menu is small but very innovative.

One and the other innovations with everything, tandoori maggi i had which had some different spices giving it a very different texture. Garlicious zappi was even very tasty.
Papdi chat was even crispy and tangy, as such the name it was chatar patar and dabeli was the one i got crazy for, it was  very authentic with proper chutneys, sauces, potato sandwiched in the middle of a burger bun with spices and pomegranate seeds.

So for me chatar patar was everytime a good experience, n i will surely look forward to visit this place once and enjoy more delicacies!! Without even thinking just go for this place its not at all disappointing.

This place offers dishes that are as quirky as it's name. Ordered online as we wanted to check what the fuss was about. The delivery took about 40 minutes which was decent considering the number of items we ordered - Litchi Pani Puri, Garlic Chatizza, Chole Chaat, Tandoori Maggi, Pan-e-Bahar. Every dish had an element of twist and was very well executed. 

Highly recommend if you are one of those who likes to experiment. Check out and discover for yourself

After the office hours we wanted to have something quick and tasty to satiate our evening hunger pangs. We were walking towards ballygunge circular road when we discovered this small and cosy place. We decided to get in. And it was not a bad decision at all. They have a very well crafted and crisp menu. Innovative as well. We tried kKhatta Meetha Gapagap, Taka Tak Bhel and corn chat. All were very well made. I liked it more because of the hygiene factor which is something we need to consider in Street foods.

If you walk straight from gurusaday road towards ballygunge circular road, you'll find this place just 2mins from max mueller bhavan. Quaint little sophisticated place with well chosen color of the shop -sea green and lemon yellow. Amicable staff and delicious food, all well within the price range. Literally, cheap price I would say. Way less than ordinary branded coffee. The concepts of chats, zappi, sandwiches, gapagaps are awesome. We had a schewan zappi and masala sandwich which was enough for two. All in all a good investment.

Great concept. As close as it gets to mumbai and Delhi chaat, in Kolkata. The dabeli needs a bit of work though. But the papri chaat was outstanding. Infact better than many places in Mumbai and Delhi also. The sandwiches are also pretty good. And they have maintained great quality and hygiene at very reasonable prices. Great experience.

Today I visited the place and had a very bad experience. Had bought vouchers from nearbuy and now I regret wasting my money, time and effort in trying it out. I will never ever go there in future and nor will I recommend to anyone. That guy charged me extra Rs.80 for packaging without any special package. He was packing the simlar way for other customer without any extra charges. Nor was there any mention of the charges on the deal voucher I had purchased. This is the first place till now which had charged extra other than that mentioned in the voucher.

The whole food I had to throw it off. I had ordered maggi, gapaggap, papdi chat, bhel and iced tea. Nothing was in position to eat except maggi. The quantity was too less compared to the price or dont know if he had given me lesser. The papdi chat became soggy. The chutney in the bhel was smelling , also the bhel was dry as if dry jhaal muri. The maggi was ok but quantity was less. Bought 6 glasses of iced tea. Inspite of charging so exhorbitant packaging charge, the disposable glasses were of poor quality without proper lid. The whole drink spilled over by the time I came home. So had to throw it off too.

This was the first and last time I visited them. Remember, its appreciation that pays in the long run not this looting business. Had you been good in your service, I would have given you more business. But now be happy with those few bucks that you looted from me. And I'll be happy of giving it to some beggar. I have better options to go to who provide not only great food but good service without the intention of looting people.

When I first came to have lunch at Chatar Patar while I was interning at an office nearby, I wasn't very pleased to find out that this place only served veg food - me being a hardcore non vegetarian. But with my very first bite into their garlic cheese sandwich I fell in love with Chatar Patar's food! And hence during the entire length of my internship I made it a point to have my lunch there! I have tried almost every item on the menu out of which my most favorite dishes are garlic cheese sandwich, chhola kulcha, Mexican zappy, cheese  pao bhaaji, corn cup, masala bhel and the amazing phuchkas! The drinks on the menu are also worth a mention - I especially liked their cold coffee, iced lemon tea, Oreo shake and virgin mojito. The store is a bit small and cannot accommodate more than four to five people at a time. So I really hope that they move to a bigger place - in that way a lot more people can try out their amazing food at the same time!

Location: A few hundred meters from Max Muller Bhawan/Iskcon Temple.

Chatar Patar, a fairly new joint has been serving the people in and around Ballygunge area with a delicious yet, pocket friendly fare. It has slowly become a hit among the commercials nearby who prefer availing the delivery facilities. Happened to discover this place while wandering around with my friends and after a quick discussion, planned a snack.

The ambiance of the place has been kept simple and toned up to a lemon-green color decor. A rather small place with just enough space to accommodate six heads who could enjoy food in a stand-n-eat format. Just has one tall table in the center and two little wall-sides. It's best to opt for a takeaway. Parking wouldn't be much of a problem around but, the change in the route of traffic flow might be a turn off for some. Nevertheless, it's worth a try. :)

Chatar Patar is a place where one would get street food along with a few snack-type and fusion items in an established format. And yes, this place is a purely vegetarian place. From the range of fare, which was quite wide spread, the following was ordered:

- Dabeli
A variant of vada pav made with a tangy potato mixture patty sandwiched between a small burger bun and then topped with onion, pomegranate, fresh garlic chutney and sev. Was delicious to eat.

- Mexican Zappi
A twist to the local know Quesadillas gave birth to Zappi. The mexican version of the zappi consisted of a pizza-pasta sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup, herbs & spices and a flavorful filling of corn & vegetables folded in a griddle-cooked flat bread (roti). Was served with chopped coriander leaves, grated cheese and a drizzle of ketchup on top. Tasted great. Recommended.

- Italian Zappi
The Italian version of the zappi was a non-spicy version comprising of a filling of chopped vegetables and corn mixed with mayonnaise, ketchup, Italian herbs & spices folded in a griddle-cooked flat bread (roti). Topped with chopped coriander leaves, sprinkle of cheese & drizzle of ketchup and served. Tasted awesome. A little spice was added on request. Recommended.

- Stuffed Gapagap (Fusion Dish)
Gapagap is nothing but, puchkas or pani puris as you may call so. The fusion was the stuffing inside the pieces. The opted dish was Cheesy Garlic Gapagap and yes, it was bolt upright to its name. Had a filling of melted cheese and garlic dip. O so cheesy! Nice to taste.

- Chola Kulcha
Nicely boiled chickpeas prepared in a flavorful home-made style gravy paired along with Kulcha Bread and served with onion juliennes & a lemon wedge on the side.
The piping hot Chola tasted nice and the Kulcha bread was warm enough to compliment.

- Pan-e-Bahar
A delicious and refreshing milk shake which was a blend of fresh Magai Paan, Milk and Ice-cream was loved.

All the orders were prepared by the welcoming owner himself and the staff were also found to be friendly. The service was slightly slow, but, one can always wait a bit for the delicious affair.

The prices were found to be pocket-friendly.

• A little suggestion for the wonderful place is that one expects to have food in a clean environment and thus, expects the tables to be clean and ready for use. :)
The presentation of the Zappis' could be experimented upon, as all look the same.

Overall a nice experience.
- Would certainly return for more.

Good joint for ordering snacks during office hours. Our favorites are the Cheese garlic sandwiches and Samosa chat. The Italian Zappi deserves special mention here - its very similar to quesadillas. You can also try their Puchka platter. Very efficient for office deliveries around that area.

We've been ordering food regularly from this joint during our office hours. There's no complaint against the food they offer. However, whenever we've tried to order online through zomato you show a minimum order amount of Rs. 300 but when we call and order we get delivery at our office even for a billing amount as less as Rs. 55. It would be a lot easier if you remove the minimum order filter from the online ordering system so that it becomes easier for customers like us to place an order directly by selecting items online.

Very nice snacks joint. The awesome flavoured puchkas( called gapa gaps) r something new.. so is the zappi. The food is gr8. The Mexican and italian zappis r outstanding. So is the kokum and lahsan gapagap. Dabheli is delicious and if u r a spicy aficionado then taka tak bhel is a must try.
Althought the space is cramped up and an exhauat system wud have been a life saver but if u want to try something new in chats, this is the place..

Being a street food lover I had to try this place. Though it's a very small place, the experience was great. Tried pudina and lychee phuchkas, in which the water served were flavoured differently. Then the chocolate phuchka was tasty but a little too sweet, would have been better if they served 2 or 3 pcs . in a portion. The pav bhaji was yummy & very buttery. And finally finished off with paan shots which were very refreshing  & something i never tasted before. I was told that they can serve many more flavours which weren't yet included in the menu. Looking forward to try them in the next visit.

Went to chatar patar today for the first time.It had a lot of interesting things on the menu however to be safe we tried the basics. I had the puchka first with khatta meetha paani.The flavour and taste was good however,the water was a little grainy with the masalas.Then had the aaloo tikki chaat which was quite tasty and good.the staff was helpful and good but I found a few flies there.much less comapared to the street chaatwaalas though! Will definitely try the other items again.

The best part is that  you can take it home anytime and relish it with your family and friends.
Weekends or weekdays you just have to be there to taste the various varieties of puchka's.
Every foodie should visit this place.

I thought this joint would be same as the mainstream ones present in the city joy but i'm glad to say I was cleared of this misconception upon trying a few of their dishes. Their main strength is innovation. The zappi and chatizza are amazing. It's like they say, give the poet a pen, the words will come flowing and in their case, give the chef a spatula the dishes will come flowing. A few minor set backs, the service is a wee bit slow, and there isn't enough place to sit. Over all amazing food. Must try are firstly the chatizza, a chat made on a thepla which serves as the base. Zappi which a coleslaw sandwich in a different style. The cold coffee is sugary sweet. Not much of a pocket pick. Over all a very good place mainly because of the innovation. 

Tummy calls chat,  go chatar patar.  :D

A little late in posting this review.
This little food paradise is just next door to my office. And it's understandable I'm a frequent here.
The hygiene, the quality of food and the graciousness of the owners is what appeals about this place.
The sandwiches are filling and extremely delicious.
The ccholey kulchey is to die for. The cchola is spicy and tangy. The kulcha literally melts in the mouth.
I had the oreo shake the other day. It was GOOD.
Now, the best part. The pricing. It's not only pocket friendly, it is SO nicely priced that I think I'll stop having the roadside food altogether and just rely on this place from now on.
Overall a life saver.

I Am a big foodie and love everything thats yummy, so explored this place and was amazed to see such a great varieties of chaats..such dishes I never heard before..Initially, I was very confused, then the staff helped me out with the dishes.I wanted to try just a dish or two but I ended up having so many of them..:-) I loved mexican zappi, chatiza,matar tikki,.garlic puchka was soooo yummy..I even loved pav bhaji which was soooo very chatpata and spicy...the buttery pavs were very soft .. it reminded me of some of the best places in Mumbai..As I am writing this review, n recalling the stuff I had, my mouth is getting watered...

Another great feature that I loved about them is they serve some great drinks, we tried lemonade and ice tea.these were great flavoured and refreshing!

Just one request to Chatar Patar, pls start home delivery soon!

very easy to locate( Ballygunge Circular Road-Opp to Tivoli court/ petrol pump)

This is the first and only outlet of this famous chain in Kolkata. So what are you waiting for!
