This is an old charm in Park Street. Me and my mom went there on 1st january evening. Surprisingly we got a table instantly though it was filled. Live singing was going on. Bollywood tracks. Old ones. We ordered a plate of chicken tikka kabab and carlsberg beer for both of us. Ambience is good. Family people enjoying. We had fun. The food was good too. Waiters were courteous enough. Just that the hygiene isnt upto the mark. Insect was there on the wall, it even got on the table. I feel cleanliness is a huge issue there. And yes, I love old songs too but on 1st January we young people expect a bit of modern or latest songs too. So yes, these 2 are my complaints. Otherwise its a nice place. Bit expensive but nice. :)
Ambience- 3/5
Food- 3.5/5
Hospitality-4/5
Worth the money- 3.5/5

Well we went in 30 th December at night. So there was quite rush. We tried Chicken Cordon Bleu, chicken kebab and tandoori,  mixed fried rice with pork and roasted garlic chilli lamb. I must say the kebabs and the tandoori were heaven but I other than that all were ok sort of. The staffs were courteous.

Have dined here a couple of yeas ago times but a very conservative place in a literally sense.They didn't want to serve alcohol without a male companion since we two were the only female customers.Good is decent and they also had a live band but it so so loud that is was impossible to hear one another.Not going back for sure during the recent times and even otherwise.

if you are a foodie n wish to have a great meal without spending a bomb then this is your ideal place. excellent food, decent ambiance and very reasonable. if you like to booze then avail the happy hours from 12:30pm to 5:30 pm, 20% discount.
We had fish finger with Tata sauce, ham and chicken salad, mixed fried rice, chilly pork and chicken sweet n sour... all tasted excellent. if you like spicey food then options are far more.

BUT inspite of all the pros, entire fun can be ruined thx to their loud music. There are singers shouting their lungs out and thats a big turn off for me. If you aspire to have a conversation with your friends or your group then its not the place for you. It is the only negative point of Trincas so beware.
overall keeping food quality and price in mind I will give them 4/5.

Trincas is one of my favourite restaurants while I am in the Park Street area in the evenings. The beer is great and the food is simply awesome. What keeps me bringing back here is the 'live music band' that keeps the crowd stuck here. Step in here around 08:00 pm and immerse in some soulful country rock..

Trincas is the first eatery on your left when you enter Park Street from Maidan. This prestigious eatery is one of the oldest and has been a stepping stone for many artists. This eatery like the previous years has the love band playing till now during weekends and on the festive occasions. 

I took a delivery of their noodles, rice and chicken. 
1. Chicken noodles: Good VFM. Costed merely 100 was good enough for its price. The spring onions hurt the teeth though. 3.5/5
2. Mixed rice: again great stuff at 120. The prawns were tiny in size but the chicken and egg seemed way too out of proportion. 3/5
3. Hong Kong chicken: Loved the string ginger flavour in the gravy. The gravy was a little too thin for my liking and the pieces were not satisfactory. They were braised, solids would have been more appreciated. 3.5/5

Packaging was good enough.

Though I drop by this place earlier, still I am putting the review today. This place is quite famous among the foodies of kolkata. This place has 2 outlets, one with live music and another without. The live music part is pretty unpleasant because of the loud music. You may feel uncomfortable after a few minutes. The other part is quite pleasant, but the place is pretty small and the small chit chats go loud after sometime. 
The food is good, specially the biriyani. It's a much try thing for this particular place. 
Hospitality :- 2/5 ( considering the rush during puja hours I have to state that the service is not upto the mark at all. Taking a long time to attend and serve)

Ambience:- 3/5
Food:- 4.5/5 

P.S:- After completion of dinner while leaving the table the waiter ask for tip. Its upto us whether we pay the tip of not. Its been a foul experience for us.

Even though I'm a Kolkatan by birth, & a die hard foodie to boot; somehow I had never managed to visit this venerable eatery. So we sought to remedy this unacceptable situation on a rainy evening. It was Ashtami, & the place was packed. Luckily a table opened up just as we went it. I had the Mixed Grill, which is highly recommended for all hardcore meat lovers. The assortment of chicken, lamb, ham, sausages, a fried egg, bacon & fries was both very filling & tasty. And while we ate, first a gentleman & then a lady entertained us with nicely sung live music. 

Cons- one of the members of our group tried Veg Fried Rice & Chili Chicken & found them to be rather unimpressive. And maybe the management should think about re-ordering the sitting arrangements to give each table a little more buffer space.

26.09.2017: Trincas is one of the oldest places at Park Street and Kolkata as well. We had our chance on the Sasthi of Durga puja and stepped into this restaurant cum bar. We were given a 4 seater table which was our requirement promptly. At the first glance it seemed to be crowdee as space was more occupied with tables.
Songs were playing a bit loudly though we enjoyed the second the band playing western music. Three of my friends took beer and as an exception I took Trincas special cold coffee which to my surprise was very good.
In starter, we took Roasted chili pork an@d pork in Schezuan style. Both the appetizers were good if not outstanding.
For special mention, the ambience sets the mood and the service was very good.

Cockroaches in the sizzler board and management seems used to it.


Here goes my experience: 

I visited the restaurant today and ordered mocktails (blue bliss, mango tang) and fish tikka, makhmali kabab.
Food was very nice.
Then we ordered 1 chelo kebab sizzler. When it came, we liked it and ordered 3 more (we were 4).
The disaster starts here..

When the 3 sizzlers were served, 3-4 small cockroaches came out of the sizzler boards (wooden part).

After we complained about it to the staffs, my father in law was going to the washroom.. and he heard the cashier was mentioning to another staff.. taste would be better if there are few cockroaches.

It felt disgusting.. first there are cockroach and when customers complains, the restaurant is not apologetic.

Ordered golden fried prawns, chelo kebab sizzler and tandoori mixed grill sizzler...all the platter was delicious and sufficient in quantity. The rate was reasonable with 18% GST.

Trincas definitely does not need an introduction. One of the oldest player in the restaurant industry, its clientele is spread across generations. Recently during a visit to Park street we decided to dine at Trincas as we have not been there for quite sometime. 

The ambiance takes you back to the 80s with a live band performing classic English soft rock numbers. Over the year they have maintained consistency when it comes to food and service. 

We usually order their Indian fare. They are always spot on with their kebabs and Indian gravy items. 

The tandoori chicken, mutton sheekh kebab and chicken reshmi kebab are my personal favourites. 

Do visit Trincas for a soothing musical evening with your family

Went here for a Sunday dinner last week. We were a party of four, and Trinca's was our obvious choice.
If you want to kick back with a drink and some delicious food, while enjoying live music - this is the place to be. We ordered :

Drinks :
A bottle of chilled Kingfisher's Draught Beer.
A small peg of Bombay Sapphire gin with chilled tonic water.

Starters:
Maahi Malai Tikka.
Maahi Tandoori Tikka.

Main course :
Plain Naan
Chicken Tikka Butter Masala
Chicken Roulade
Chicken Steak
Fish Florentine

Dessert :
Tutti-fruity ice-cream
Chocolate Brownie with Vanilla Ice-cream.

Each and every item was PERFECTION on the plate ( and in the glasses :P )
The alcohol served was of good quality and came with complimentary accompaniments of chanachur and cheeslings which were replenished multiple times by the attentive servers.

The Indian dishes were bursting with flavours but the heat or oil was not overpowering. Be it the kababs we had as the starters or the chicken side dish - they were a perfect amalgamation of flavour and texture.

The continental dishes too were top-notch. The fish Florentine was enough to fill two rumbling stomachs. It comprised of two huge fillets of subtly steamed Calcutta beckti on a bed of creamy spinach puree, covered with sinful molten mozzarella. The chicken steak too was cooked just right, it was not dry like most other steaks with white meat tend to be. The chicken roulade too tasted great, with a delectable filling of spiced chicken mince encased in tightly wound up chicken breast. The pepper sauce drizzled on it was DIVINE. All the three continental dishes came with sides of creamy mash and steamed vegetables.

The winner of the evening was the dessert though. Be it the pretty pink tutti-fruity adorned with fresh fruits or the perfect marriage of a warm and sinfully rich choco-walnut brownie with the cold and milky taste of the vanilla ice-cream. The hot fudge drizzled on top added another dimension to this dessert.

The service is a little slow, but given the fact that the place remains crowded all the time, one can overlook this glitch.The live music is the novelty of Trinca's, but the acoustics as well as the artists and the choice of most of the songs are surely a downward dip from the glorious days of Trincas which had stalwarts like Usha Uthup as singers or the sultry Miss Shefali as dancers.

But, all in all it was a beautiful experience and one has to admit - when it comes to the question of Old-school fine dining in the City of Joy, Trinca's still rules the roost.

Went to have dinner and I absolutely enjoyed it.
Well he had fusion of both Indian and Continental items.
First off we had some Reshmi kebab and some juice with that, the kebab was perfectly done over the tandoor and was delicious.
 For main course we had Chicken Ala Kiev and Chicken Belle Hellen.
None of the items disappointed us and were absolutely delicious.
Followed by some Murg Pulao and Murg Tikka Masala.
These were prepared to perfection as well.
Finally for dessert had a brownie with Ice cream.

What I disliked was the live music.
Didnt like the singers for the night and their voice really gave a headache.
Nevertheless I enjoyed the food but hope for better performers next time.

It is one of the oldest restaurant in park street, with the ambiance and decor of british times...though it seems a bit congested.... We went on Saturday evening, the band that was performing that day was mostly playing old hindi songs..it was good but a few new songs would have been better... We ordered trincus special mixed grill, Barbecue chicken and a chicken pasta (dont remember the exact name) and few drinks...food tastes really awesome.. But the service was not so good..we have call them frequently to take orders...and they seem to more interested in the tip than actually serving... Overall if you want to hang out with friends and remember good old days Trincus is the place for you..

First came to know about this restaurant on a magazine. The magazine featured that Trincas was founded by some Jews. I don't have any idea that the story is true or not but it served as the basis behind my visit.
To me it was as an unassumed gem,but entering the place, I was welcomed by their European Pub Culture. This place hosts musical shows in the evening and the ambience is so therapeutic.
As it was my first visit,I only tried out their Spicy Mango Tango,Chicken Tettrazini, Chicken Cordon Bleu.
Each of them was made to perfection but I would like the Spicy Mango Tango a bit less spicy. Otherwise it was quite okay.
Next time,when I will roam on the streets of the Park Street Area, I would love to spend another evening here.

Located beside THE PARK hotel,parkstreet,this resturant is not bad for a weekend hangout.The ambience is quite pleasant.The staff members are quite cooperating and doesnt allow any kind of drunkard nuisance.The food quality is a bit average and not very pocket-friendly.The singers are sometimes awfully loud.However this place is as a whole nice place to hangout is you are having a boring weekend.

Amazing food and drinks served by these guys! And if you happen to be a fan of old hindi songs, then this is the place to be! So after you are drunk and the world makes less sense, such music then starts to make more sense. A good place to hog, get drunk and be lost to the soulful music! The only thing that annoys is the servers nagging you for tips!

This is one of the well known places in Park Street. One of the oldest as well. It is located right next to The Park. We had gone on a Friday night and we got to see live performance. Both Hindi and English performances were held. The ambience was very good. Chilled. Coming to the food, it was not that great. We had ordered beer along with few starters then for main course Chicken Fried Rice and Devil's Chicken(super spicy) and then dessert. Over all food was not that great. Service was good. Ambience was on point. And definitely for that I'll visit again.

Food - 4/5
Comfort - 3/4

Located in the ground floor of Park Hotel, Trincas is an old gem of Park Street. Famous for its North Indian , Chinese and Continental delicacies with a reasonable price of drinks. The USP of the place is its live band, Usha Utthup being one of it's old members. The ambience and the quick service adds another feather to their crown. 

Trincas has been there since British times. So it's really more of a heritage now. Though the food quality and quantity is good but the seating arrangement is quite old and can be made more comfortable. The ambience should get a thumbs up for it's live band which is well complemented by dim lights.  Good place to have drinks as they don't charge alcohol tax separately. And a perfect destination for a hangout with friends. The staffs are really good and they even recommend you if you are in any hesitation. In short this legendary fine-dine bar cum restaurant is perfect for you if you want that old Calcutta charm and nostalgia. 

In Picture - Crispy Chilly Babycorn , Chello Kebab , Dahi Wada , Hot Gulab Jamun with Icecream , Caramel Custard , Tutti Frutti.

Trincas of Park Street needs no introduction, it’s been an integral part of the famous Calcutta nightlife scene since the swinging sixties…when my father and his buddies used to hang out there, and when my aunty Eve was the main draw…a long, long time ago. So I went there expecting as much from its reputation, as all the stories I had heard. I was disappointed from the minute I stepped in. Trincas looks (and feels) tired and run down…a badly aged, has-been, Austin Powers…minus his mojo. And sadly that’s all I have to say about Trincas. You want a fun place with live music on Park Street? Look no further than Someplace Else at the Park Hotel next door.
 Yeah baby!

Waste NOT. Want NOT.

Located on the heart of Park Street, Trincas has been very famous among all foodies. The live performance is not really nice always (sometimes it makes feel nice but not always) and sometimes makes people feel irritating because it hampers the normal conversation which people like to have while relaxing. The wine is nice along with other food menus. Visited there on Christmas eve as a result of which had to wait for a long time. Rest is good. Would like to visit again.

Food item - 4/5
Ambience - 3/5 (due to the live performance )
Service - 3.5/5

We visited in the afternoon for lunch, not at all prepared for continental food, but we ended up ordering them and was amused by the taste. Nice behavior of the staffs, good food, good decor .. what else you want?
Prawn cocktail: 5/5 (its a must try starter)
Chicken tetrazzini : 5/5 ( the ice breaker  if you are not a fond of continental food )
 American fried chicken: 4/5

Firstly,For price tags check out trincas tavern menu. Its the same.
The live band kicks in from 4pm. Its quite good but also a bit loud.u will enjoy it and wont hurt your eardrums but unfortunately u wont be able to hear anything the person next to you speaks. The food is yum and very tasty but i am a bit dissappointed with the quantity.seems Trincas' sister restaurants help us hog more value for money than this prime premier. Drinks availability is good but not all are on happy hour offer - so do check out before ingesting. Overall a good experience.

My suggestions is to order your drinks at a subtle pace while u enjoy the good music.by 8:30pm have a good filling dinner.go home and go to sleep as u sulk in the memories.

I have not visited Trinca's in many years. It was my first visit to remember. I ordered for a glass of gin and tonic, assisted with fish and chips. The bill amounted to over 1000. So Trincas is a costly affair.

The fish and chips was good; drinks are expensive. Seating can be made more comfortable.

I went primarily to listen to live music. The quality of music let me down. They played bad Hindi music. I was hoping for more westernized culture, considering it's a pub set along British lines.

Park st is the only Happening area in Kolkata. Trincas is one of the oldest place in Park st. I'm giving 2.5 points only for the Live band and Drinks they serve. If you're hardcore vegan I won't suggest you this place for dine out. Food taste is not at all good plus service is also lil late. We ordered Yellow dal which was pathetic it only tasted of chillies, Paneer Tikka butter masala which was not up to mark, butter nan was not soft, At the end I ended my food with just Pina which was soothing. So if you want to only drink then trincas is best place otherwise don't try.

This place has history but sad now its music standard seems to be dropping big time. Your English band Drummer is absolutely dead no life in him and your singer only air comes out of his mouth. Its high time you make a few changes with the band. Visited your place on Saturday the 7th of Jan 2017 sad only 3 people on stage a new drummer keyboard player and the guitarist playing bass. Food drinks and service are great.

I would say that this place is a mist visit and then revisit.

Had to stand in a line, waiting for the table for around 15-20 mins. 
So now as we entered the place, the aura of the place was very positive. 
The live performance was going on which was just so awesome.

I ordered tandoori chicken and black bog scotch and many beers😉. 

The party was amazing.

More work can be done on ambience. However, the service was good.

Firstly i will praise their crowd management skills..there was a huge queue outside the trincas on 25th night...when we joined the queue, i was expecting no less than an hour to go in..but the way they managed the queue and the seating arrangements systematically, we got into our dining shoes in just 10 minutes...Coming to the ambience,it was as lively as a place could get with top quality live songs going on complemented  by the dim lights, which added a festive flavour to the night..maybe another usha utthup will emerge from there one day...the seating area is large enough to cater a big crowd...service was remarkable, staff were thorough with the dishes and recommended us well...as far as food is concerned , we chose to order the trincas special mix grill which included bacon,chicken steak,lamb steak,sausages,fried egg and french fries...well we enjoyed the food every bit..it was tasty..could have been served a bit hotter though...neways trincas made my christmas celebration complete...it served as an icing on the cake...il strongly recommend this place..compeletely satisfied..will visit sometime again in the future :)

Very ordinary food with extraordinary price, more of a nostalgia shop crowded with old people and playing irritating old fashioned 90's songs .. pathetic is the sizzler dish, they serve the same pre-cooked kababs( 4pieces) and improperly bolied rice in a so called sizzler plate

Style and class are 2 words that will define this masterclass restaurant. 

Live music the aroma of good food 

Always make you feel rise and shine.

The food is tasty but sometimes the quantity is a bit disappointing. 

The behaviour is good the waiters are helpful and never make you feel uncomfortable. 

But one thing is suggested that if you want to sit quietly then trincas isn't a nice option as sometimes the music is too loud that you won't even listen to your fellow diner's voice

This place is hilarious! Sure, you'll get decent food, decent drinks and good service. But, be prepared to be forced to hear random musicians playing morbid Bollywood songs at full volume and you'd feel like they are trying too hard to hold on to some outdated image of a typical bar. But, overall not so bad! A hearty laugh guaranteed!

We were under a budget and a lot of hurry the day we visited Trincas (me and my best friend). So we decided to keep it light and just order lamb chops, chicken steamed momo and fresh lime soda. 

Now I know that one is not supposed to order common items like momo in places like Trincas and instead go for the unconventional ones, but as I said, we were under a budget (it was a free meal actually so we couldn't be too extravagant with our choices) 

Anyways, the lamb chops were pretty good, though forgettable. The fresh lime soda was as you would expect fresh lime soda to taste like (it was good nonetheless).

But I was shocked with the momos. They were 5 in one plate (we usually have 6). The outer covering was thin and kinda slimy and the stuffing was very little. Moreover, after a few bites we realized that the chicken tasted odd, almost unpleasant. It didn't take us long to figure out that the momos were stale and we quickly called the manager to inform him. At first, he seemed as if he didn't understand what we were talking about. I'm sure that he was thinking the same thing that we were - that how could such a well known restaurant in Park Street serve "stale food" ?!  

After he was out of his daze, he took the plate and smelled it (that was a really funny moment!) and said something to the waiter.

 Around 15-20 mins later, another plate of momos arrived for us, which by the grace of God, tasted a lot better (not stale atleast). The new plate of momos too had a thin coating and little stuffing inside. I've had way better ones in roadside stalls.

Overall, the food was ordinary and unimpressive. It was not worth the price they charge. 

Plus, the staff were just weird. They didn't know how to smile and would just stare at you like a zombie. All the time that we were cheering the band which was performing and singing along with them, the waiters and the managers were just looking at us as if we were Martians! 

And of course, there was the stale-food disaster too. 

All of these are the reasons I am giving it a 1.5 rating.

I would recommend Trincas only if you wanna have good drinks and are in the mood for some nice, entertaining music. Otherwise, it's a big NO.

The interior is good. But I am not so convinced with the hospitality part. Food is kind of good. But not a good option to visit with a large group. As they will never adjust the sitting arrangements for such group. Good for people that are in small groups. 

Overall, a 3 for them. ☺

If you are looking for a vintage restaurant with stories this is the place. Wonderful staffs! Though the restaurant need to think about their taste of foods sometimes. Most disturbing part- in the evening the music can make you a deaf if you are a true music lover and that's probably because of the sound arrangements!😰

The food served was too good, tasted nice and looked good too. We had taken #chickencordonblue and #lambausju and #kingfisherdraughtpitcher. Moreover even doesn't costs the pocket that much. The draught beer was during Happy hours. So, a nice place to go for a lunch date.

This is one must visit legendary bar cum restaurant in the city of joy , specially in any festive day when they arrange some quality live music by professionals to create an amazing and charming musical ambience alltogether be it pop or melody, like on our last visit on this durga puja ashtami . I have always tried avoiding trincas as unfortuantely in my couple of previous experiences , the bollywood numbers and commercial bengali tracks most singers were singing was enough to spoil the vibe but this last visit was phenomenal. The food , though a bit overpriced , didnot disappoint as well. we had simple chicken hakka chow with a side dish of chicken with mushroom and vegetables , and hard drinks which nowadays would seem to be quite affordable as they dont charge alcohol tax separately.

Many might disapprove of my review but I love the ambience of this place, I literally loath those dimly lit restaurants....this seemed to have variation in lighting which I loved.They do not provide a colossus quantity of food which is a liability so you need to order more. Food is not on the cheaper side. The one I ordered was from the Continental platter (Trincas Special Mix Grill) and a Fosters beer. The chicken and ham didn't taste that good but the prawn and the sausage were great, even the combination of french fries, poached eggs and all was great. Lastly the waiters are really kind and the food serving time is moderate.

Ps: The bathroom is squeaky clean.

This is the restaurant where Usha Uthap used to be a crooner in the days of yore. It is the place to go to for tempting continental cuisine, though the usual Chinese and popular North Indian dishes are also available. It has a bar and its mocktails are great as well. It has steaks, sizzlers, all kinds of famous mouth watering continental dishes.

Trincas in park street is one of the very famous restuarants of Kolkata which has a lot of nostalgia attached to it. I have been hearing about Trincas since I was a child. The have live music performance during evening! Great ambience! 😊

Coming to the food we ordered Chicken Tandoor, American Fried Chicken with French Fries,Mixed Fried Rice, Chilli Garlic Roasted Lamb, Caramel Custurd. 

American fried chicken was good. The chilli garlic roasted lamb was awsome and the lamb was cooked well! ❤ All the other dishes were average! 


Staffs are well mannered; though waiter was standing beside the table for extra tip even after giving 50 rupees tip and asked for more! 😰 

Foods are over priced; kolkata has better restuarants serving these dishes at lower prices. If not for the food I will visit again for the ambience,live music and nostalgia! 😊

This is one of the oldest and most popular restaurants on Park Street. It's a fine dining restaurant where musicians perform live. The ambience is great,especially if you are lucky enough to go when a good band is performing. Had gone there to see my brother's band perform. Ordered snacks during the performance- chicken sandwich and cold coffee. Both were alright :-). On an earlier visit here,I had had the chicken stroganoff. I had loved that dish. It was very filling. Creamy white sauce with veggies,chicken and rice 😍. The staff is courteous and helpful. Overall,good food with good music :-)

Now the food here..... they make very good continental dishes. I like the kebabs here as well. The peshawari kebab specially is worth a try with the right mix of flavours and a literally melt in the mouth texture. This is one place which has an outstanding lamb lasagna to offer. The house special sizzler is also a favourite. This is one place where you will be satisfied with the food and service. The pocket pinch can be a bit on the higher side, but you don't feel cheated at the end. A recommended place

Trincas is one of the very popular figure in Park Street, located just beside the Park Hotel. The main building is divided into few sections each is different branch of the same Trincas.
Went there for hard drinks. We took the Corona and I must say if you haven't tasted Corona you should do it atleast once as it do taste really good. Add a lemon in the bottle and it becomes better.
The food quality is good. The quantity may not be huge but the quality beats everything. One rice dish is not sufficient to feed two adults.
And ambiance is good and the service is excellent.
Be it for food or drinks this place is worth visiting. :)

It was evening time when we went in there and there was a band playing live music as always.
We went there with an old pal and his wife for dinner and a few drinks.
We had paneer tikkas, chicken tikkas and a couple of fish items for starters . I honestly don't remember what we ate for main course because of what we drank with those starters..
All in all, an awesome experience :)

Had heard a lot about Trincas from a very young age, finally managed to visit the place. Let's start one by one. Firstly the food, excellent to taste and great quantity. We ordered the special mixed grill and two desserts, everything was delectable. The portions though may seem pricey come in huge quantity and one dish is usually enough for two medium to heavy eaters. The staff are extremely well mannered and actually help in choosing your food and recommend nicely. The ambience is very nice. We went in the afternoon, so we didn't get a chance to see the live music, but the songs that were being played were nice as well. So all over the place is a must visit for food lovers. Everything is appealing and great, however, I'm deducting the 0.5 because we constantly had to ask for water and had to pour it ourselves. Though the maitre'd and staff were well mannered they seem to lack slightly the virtues of good waiting. Definitely a "visit again" for me.

went there after years last nght  and realised , what i was missing - single woman for dinner and drinks and stepping out to a smoke and doing all of it feeling comfortable - ofit course is something about self confidence,  but if a place makes it happen  with elan it is something about the place as well 

i found a table easily through it was crowded - service was prompt and courteous - except the last minute when the waiter stood at the table waiting for the tip , made me a little uncomfortable, i think i would have tipped higher if he hadnt stood there - but thats one chotu baat ...

well the real stuff - music - a high volatage young girl belted out  steamy and energitic 70s and 80s hindi filmi numbers ( RD Burman zindabad) , followed by a gentle man rendering some soulful Manna Dey ( oh wow ...) and then really effective band with truely talented bass and lead rendered some melodious number in angrezi and then a peppy little thing went - shala-lala- la with some verve .

my whiskey had enough ice and salad was ok, soup tomato and basil was ketchuppy - and baked spinach and corn - served with mashed potatoes and buttered rice was pretty good with a yummy cheesy crust .

portions were good  and over all pretty good 

may be tonight again ? if not then soon when i come to kolkata

To try and survive based on nostalgia alone is to simply have given up in your vocation. The place that was once graced by the likes Usha Uthup is now witness to unbearably loud music masquerading as nightlife in a city that surely deserves better.

Very limited selection of drinks and an extremely average fare compound its miseries further. A platter of weird smelling Boti Kebabs, a dry portion of Chicken Steak and a disastrous attempt at a Fried Ice Cream rounded off a very poor evening for me.

So this really old school place stands proudly at the park street which happens to be one of my favorite places to eat. 

The place looks boring at first glimpse but you eventually get the hang of it and start enjoying the soft music, courteous staff and everything else. 

Someone in fact told me that singers like Kumar sanu started their career from this place. Don't know how much of that is true but might just be possible! 

The food is good. Not the best I had but average enough. The staff is really friendly. Moreover, the budget is a bit on the higher end but it's worth it to mark your presence at a place like this once at least!

Though I swear my eating out mostly by Park st, I did not visit Trincas before yesterday possibly because I always had this misconception that this place is definitely expensive. But my misconception was cleared sooner when I took the menu card in my hand. All items were moderately priced! This place has a legacy of it's own. Live performance and ambience are thumbs up factors here. We ordered the blue bliss, Tandoori mixed grill sizzler, mutton hamburger steak and choco mud pie. Tandoori mix grill was pretty filling. Loved the mutton hamburger. Absolutely smashing. Mud pie was good nothing great. The staff were pretty cordial. I have no complains. Food quality can be elevated though quantity is good enough. Definitely worth of a couple of more visits.

Wanted to go to this place from a long time, as Trincas is known as one of the living legend in the heart if kolkata. So the ambiance is good. There is a stage in between where a band performs live with hindi and english songs. So it somehow set ur mood...their service,sittng arrangements are is good. We ordered two types of kababs,chicken polao,butter nun,o ther three dishes of chicken with drinks and desserts. The prices are little hyped here I think...the food looked delicious but wasn't that tasty. A good experience in general.

This place reminds me of the 90's with a stage for live performances and their seating arrangements. The ambience and service is good. The place is dimly lit and spacious and even though the live performances aren't outstanding it somewhat sets the tone for the evening. The kebabs we ordered were good, nothing spectacular. One must visit this place only for their love of fine spirits and ambience.

Located in the heart of the city of joy this restaurant has been a famous eating joint for the people over the years. This restaurants also believes in giving chances to new musicians and singers . Coming to the food its nthng extraordinary or special but if you are looking for wallet friendly boozing do visit this place with your friends during the happy hours which generally starts frm afternoon .

Trincas is located strategically in Park Street, and is quite easy to locate. The decor is a lil oldish (that's what my perception is). We visited this place on a late Sunday afternoon, and did not find much people over there. Our main idea was to have alcoholic drinks along with starters sitting in some lazy place and we were more than happy to find out less number of people in the restaurant. We ordered crispy conjee lamb, drums of heaven, schezwan pork, and chicken hakka noodles from the food menu. The items were decent to taste and I must appreciate the service of the restaurant. We had vodka and whiskey for drinks which were decently priced. Also, there is a separate area for smoking and my friend was delighted to go in there for 6-7 times. Overall it is a decent experience for us.

What i really loved about this place is the live band. I never experience such a beautiful thing. The lady singer has a beautiful voice. Now coming to food we ordered lemon chicken which really tasty despite not being too spicy and chicken haka noodles. Among the drinks we orderea bloody mary. I didnt like drink. But i loved the food. I am looking forward to come over there in future.

Trincas is almost a popular landmark of Kolkata nd specialises in North Indian nd Continental delicacies.....
Although the food quality has gone down in the past few years,,,, it is yet undeniable that fine dining in Kolkata refers to Trincas,,, with their good live music nd entertainment..... However,,, if you are at Trincas,,,, try their specialised cocktails or mocktails.....

A restaurant is known not only for the food it serves but also for the drinks it has. I came to this place to attend a quiz, and ordered a Fresh Lime Soda as I was thirsty and craving for a refreshment.

The soda had no fizz, wasn't cold at all. One would definitely expect a better drink from a place as renowned as Trincas. Wasn't satisfied with this beverage at all.

However, the staff is really courteous and prompt. Will update this review soon when I try out more items here.

It is so average!!!! God knows why it is so over hyped. Located at the heart of Park Street, it is very easy to locate. Vintage place. Average food. You get to see middle aged people perform obscure old hindi/ bengali songs (believe me, witnessed it twice.) Not that I've issues with middle-aged people performing but they are so ridiculously confident and off tune that it's funny. 😛 This place is functioning on its yesteryear glory. Hope it does the needful to live up to its name.

Have been to this place 3 times....couldnt afford during college time but always wanted to since this is another legendary place in the part street area.....ordered drinks and finger foods everytime which were good....the ambience is typical of that in the 70s-80s where there is a singing stage with full hands playing english n hindi songs....the singers were average but it sets the mood....of a different type....with an array of classic and modern restraurants all over, this place is worth a try at times for a different feel....

After contemplating for over an hour as to where should we go and stuff ourselves in park street we landed up here...
Sunday afternoon...the streets are absolutely empty...the restaurant door unguarded...hardly anyone around...we really began to think should we even enter the place...or...should we just grab some chicken rolls...but anyways we decided to go in...and boy oh boy...really didn't expect such a crowd to be inside...the place was buzzing...
We were immediately seated...the manager was courteous....

Now coming to the food...
GOLDEN FRIED PRAWN: Excellent...nothing less...crisp...the prawn extremely fresh...all that you can ask for from the dish..

CHCIKEN AND HAM SALAD: looked like a dessert...not the way to present a salad if you ask me...I almost returned it...saying we haven't called for any desserts... after a lot of digging...found a few pieces of ham...some pork fat I believe...if not that...I have absolutely no clue what I've put in my mouth...
Verdict: Please avoid 

CHICKEN LOLLYPOP:
We were served with drums of heaven instead...and the waiter very casually said...sorry...we serve only these now...
But taste wise they were awesome... EXTREMELY EXTREMELY SPICY...so please exercise caution...and I mean it...call for a drink to douse the flames...

Now after a few drinks...we dint have much place for main course...so we called just for a sizzler...
MUTTON BURGER PATTY WITH BACON AND SAUSAGES SIZZLER
first things first...that was not bacon...it was pork belly...with an extra load of fat...
Very little meat...but whatever were get hold of...was delicious...
in house sausages...crumbly...moist...orgasmic...
We were so engrossed with the mutton burger patty and sausages...we kinda ignored the chicken fillet...though that was also very well cooked...I say that cause...a succulent chicken breast is a work of art...it's not everybody's cup of tea...

FRIED ICE CREAM: I Like
GULAB JAMUM WITH ICE CREAM: what's not to like...delicious "pantua"...the ice cream dint matter...
CARAMEL CUSTARD: Nothing great...

Last word: trincas fed us well...will definitely come back next time when I visit...the sweetest part of India.
Kudos

Ensconced in the womb of the Park hotel at Park Street, this legendary restaurant still carries the legacy after more than five decades. Although some inevitable changes have taken place, there is still a sense of deja vu every time I enter the place. I have visited this place on numerous occasions. I heard that renowned English singer Cliff Richards used to sing here. The live music and drinks in the evening is a superb combination. The music in Trincas is no longer what it used to be. However, Trincas has not changed much at all and it still makes me feel nostalgic. 

I feel that the food is never spoken of because people just go there for the live music and drinks. However, I like some of their signature dishes like Shredded Lamb, Grilled Bhetki in Lemon Butter sauce, the Chelo Kebabs, Mutton Hamburger steaks, Chicken Tettrazini, Lamb Lasagne etc. The service is generally unobtrusive, cordial and attentive. The prices are very reasonable here. I'd love to visit this place again.. !!

It is one of the legendary restaurant of Park Street. My first visit harks back to the time was in school and was usually taken there by my grandfather and dad. Last few years I din get the opportunity to dine in. Yesterday I went there with my husband (his first visit) and had awesome food. We also took the privilege of the happy hours on alcohol and beer. Try out Bekti in Oyester sauce or Devil sauce. The ambience is serene and their hospitality is excellent. Music adds to the flavour.

An iconic restaurant on Park Street. Decided to visit this place after a long time and we weren't disappointed at all. Ordered fried fish in lemon butter sauce with mashed potato n veggies. The sauce added a lot of zing to the dish and the fish was well baked , enough to linger in your mouth for long. The chicken steak in barbecue Sauce was another winner. A beer or two to go along with this and a nice seat facing the street ( lucky! On a Sunday) and this place shall be a perfect outing. Would definitely love to visit and catch up on live music...

It was our first lunch in this city and my mom wanted to go to a place that in a walkable distance from The Park. This was listed in the legendary restaurants, so we fixed up for this one. Its located in the corner of the street and has some real good interiors, that makes you feel like you have travelled back in time!
Our order comprised of Tandoori Mixed Grill Sizzler, Chelo Kebab Sizzler, Blue bliss and Chocolate mud pie with ice cream.
The mixed sizzler came along with butter naan and was a complete meal in itself. The service at this place is amazing with the staff making sure that you are comfortable. Its a complete value for money place!

Has trincas been legendary for the quality of food? I don't know and I've never heard any one talk about trincas food. Know much more for the entertainment which came with the food. Some legends have entertained the guests in the classiest manner possible long before live bars and restaurants were taken away by yuppies who have made money from material syndicates and tanneries. I have been to trincas to see what still goes on, it's nice if you enjoy a not so impressive band playing retro English music. Overall with old friends, music, alcohol and food I left the place happy

I visited Trinca's on the occasion of a friend's birthday dinner. I was reasonably satisfied with Trinca's, though there were a few things which I wish were different. 

First of all, I did not like the ambiance very much. Of course, the live music is a nice touch, but the restaurant was quite dark and that made it difficult for us to navigate. I think legendary restaurants often become complacent and do not easily change a few things. 

Apart from this, the service was decent. I tried the Chicken Stroganoff, which was basically chicken cooked in mushroom, onion and capsicum sauce, served with buttered rice, and it tasted absolutely delicious. The Chilli Garlic Noodles, however, were impossibly spicy for some reason because of which we had to order Chocolate Brownie with Icecream (this was decent). The LIITs were all right, and could have been slightly improved upon. Overall, the food was good, the ambiance was dark and music-filled, and the experience here was pleasant.

After going to their Trincas Tavern, which we were not very happy with, this time we were actually trying to go to Oly's pub, but since they were having a live band we planned to go there. We actually enjoyed the band playing as they played a lot of old soft rock and retro music. Though the musicians are old , but they still have a good touch for music. Their food too was my really good
We ordered for a chicken malai kebab and what we got was not really the same it was more a bit spicy which didn'tmake us feel to eat more as it spoiled or appetite. The only thing is that their seating style should change and their setup. They still have the old type set up and for the price that they are charging on the alcohols is really high for the place. They should actually work out on this. Also another issue I noticed is that the waiters wait for a tip something that I have only seen in the park Street areas with most pubs. For the music I would give it 4.5 but food 2 looking as the quality and ambience 3 out of 5.

Wanted to visit the place since a long time. It is quite a big restaurant. Ambience is good. The soft music lifts your mood. The service is fast. And the staffs are very much well-behaved. 
However when it came to food I didn't find anything very special. Obviously it tasted good. But not anything you won't find in other restaurants. 
And also the price was a bit high. But then again it is something you expect in a restaurant situated in the heart of Park street. 
The offer of happy hours is not very lucrative. They just give 20% off on alcoholic beverages compared to the  1:1 deal you'll find elsewhere.
But all over Trincas is a nice place to be with someone special. So just give it a go.. I think evenings will be a better timing.

Their food is average nothing extraordinary,but their fish fingers are one of the best in town do try this,highly recommended. A draught beer costs u around 100bucks whereas it is 75 just beside it @the street. So if you are going in for that simply walk into the street rather.

Another gem in the Park Street crown in the Trincas. A dimly lit resto-bar which has many live performances throughout the week. Start with the Trincas special chimney soup. And for all the meat lovers do try the mutton hamburger steak with fries for a full tummy! 
Trivia-Usha Uthup started her career from Trincas with live performances!

Omg! It's one of the best place in Park Street area. Really it's a legendary place. I had my best memory here. I have never heard any negatives with this place. The soothing music, food and alcohol. What else you need? 
You won't believe until you visit this place. I fully recommend this place.

Expensive, old and loud.
After a tiring day i was here with a bunch of friends to have drinks and food. I made a mistake that Some Place Else slipped from my mind.
The moment I entered there was live and loud oldie hindi music which made me step outside and leave. The manager noticed it and came back rushing to convince us to move to the silent area which again not to my surprise not very silent.
We had ordered chinese food, being a veggie i had picked veg Manchurian, Noodles and Fried Rice along with momos as starters. Thankfully the food was good but i found it a bit expensive. I am giving this rating for food and good service.

Another famous joint in Park Street. If you want to have a conversation with your friends, avoid going to Trincas for Dinner, as there shall a live band performance almost every evening. So visiting Trincas during lunch is the best time. Crispy Chilli Pork is a must try here. Food is good and the staff is courteous. It has also a bar with good collection of alcohol. The best part, Trincas has also got a smoking room inside.

Live music performances is the USP of this place. Nothing exceptional with the décor. 

The food is good. Never had a meal but both Chinese and Indian starters are tasty. Expensive alcohol but again the music makes up for it. 

The service is okay.

Trincas is like our very own coffee house....a heritage place where many celebrities have come into limelight from an "Aam Aadmi". Located just beside Park hotel, Trincas serves more or less all type of cuisines. The crowd mostly gathers in the evening time to enjoy the live band music. Prices are on the higher side for drinks..

It's Trincas. Enough said. :)
It's one of my favorite places in the Park Street region. Last time we went there for lunch, we had Bin Pina for starters. Be sure to get blown away by this mocktail. It works as a great appetizer.
Going to main course, we ordered the Chelo Kebab. Although it isn't the finest in the city, it's a great preparation and does come close to being the best. We washed it all down with a Mini Tutty Fruity. Being a dessert person, I would say this could have been made better for the price it charges.
In all, the ambience of Trincas with the soft music playing in the backdrop while you settle for a cozy little lunch with your buddies, Trincas is the perfect place to go. It's got a very old school charm to it. :)

I can stand in queue for half an hour to get an entry here during the time when a band is performing. Couples, families, friends all come here to have a good time. It's fun to watch people getting emotional (both happy and sad) after a few drinks during the band performance. Do order some drinks while listening to bands. We ordered Millers. In food items, butter paneer is delicious. The staff is courteous, the place is simple with a bit congested seating arrangement. But definitely a must visit (during band hours).

There's something about the holiday season in Park Street that reminds you to celebrate the quaint. Trincas is an institution that stands for this celebration.
We had the opportunity to try their holiday meal this year. The menu was very well designed. The turkey was the nicest thing that happened to me this holiday season. The staff were a little slow. But the music made up for the wait. Trincas has been a beautiful experience.

This is one of those few places in park street where you can visit with your family as well as friends. Service is good and pricing is also right. Not one of those must visits but you will not be disappointed either!

This legendary restro-bar in the heart of Park Street have been their for ages. Have visited the place innumerable number of tyms, most of the time for reunions with old friends. Quality posh ambience, good food, and live music are the things which you would associate with trincas. It is famous especially for live performances and many famous musicians of Calcutta have been here to enthrall its loyal crowd.
The food here is quite good and consistent, and though a tad bit costly. You can come here to spend a nice tym with yourself or friends and feel the the long lost charm of Park Street.

I visited this place after about 20 years when I was a frequent diner, and was pleasantly surprised to find that the food was just as great as it used to be.  Of course we had the obligatory & scrumptious spare ribs and the drums of heaven, and also the gosht platter and the chello kebab which is at least as good as the Peter Cat version, if not better!! Very few things in Calcutta have remained as good as they were in the past, but this is one the rare few which have! 👍👍

With many expectations in mind went to Trincas. Ordered chicken pepper fry as the starter which was quite good but the pieces are incredibly small. 
Even if one ignores the size of the pieces, the main course was a total blunder. Ordered chicken tettrazini. Waited for half an hour and all of a sudden we were told to change our order as they did not know when the food will finally arrive!!
We placed order once again and at that very moment chicken tettrazini appeared. The food was quite cold, not well prepared. 
Trincas did not leave up to my expectations... will think many times now before visiting the place and would also recommend others not to eat food but can eat music !!!

My friends & i visited this place for our post office hangout since we were in the mood to have soome booze. 

Their ambience is superb simply. Dimly lit with light classic music playing in the mood just would lift your mood instantly to have a great evening with your companions. Also the place is very spacious to accommodate a lot of customers so thats a plus point. So now coming to our order,we had the following items:-

1. Blenders pride 30ml for 4 of us

2. Carlsberg elephant beer 650ml

3. Murgh tikka kebab= 8 pieces nicely charred & seasoned properly served with chutney,tomatoe,cucumber & pickled onions. The taste was just superb & went perfectly with our BP.

4. Chelo kebab= This took the cherry. I think their chelo kebab would give a run for their money to peter cat's version easily. The butter & herb rice was superb & so were the other items on the palate. Must try

The total bill came to 1527 & all the items on the menu are tax & service charges inclusive. The staffs are attentive & courteous which was good to see. Also they have live music performance after 6pm of classic bwood songs. So dont miss that if you are an admirer of old classic bwood songs!!

It would be wrong if I state that Trincas is the best that Park Street has to offer but the place has got it's own uniqueness. It's a perfect blend of a mass outing with a classy flavor. Many would disapprove, still I rate it over Oly Pub as a place to quench your thirst. The drinks menu is moderately price & the Shrimp Cocktail excels as an appetizer. The band stage is another plus with music that's good on ears. The stage has seen the likes of Anjan Dutt & Usha Utthup striking the right notes.

Went to this place during Durgapuja with lot of expectations as I had never been to trincas before. Things were nice before entering the restaurant. It was almost empty when we were there. We ordered spicy chicken finger and mixed hakka noodles. We did not find any spice or taste in the so called spicy chicken finger and the preparation was so rock hard that an old man can hardly chew it. We were unable to cut these stuffs with the knife also ,so we started eating with our hands. Upon eating the so called chicken fingers, we got only one taste - BITTER. Then we got our next item - apparently it was the worst hakka noodles we have ever had. They mixed everything with it ,but no distinct taste was there in the chowmin. We can get much better noodles in any of the Kolkata footpath also.I was unable to understand how this kind of restaurant can survive in park street area. For what they are taking money form the customers? Just for the bullshit live band performance? Why 5-6 waiters roam around in front of our faces when we were having so called food there? There are lot of reasons for not liking this place. All my money was wasted. Take money ,but please serve good food as per your cost.

I have been going to this place since childhood and so decided to drop in with friends on Sashti afternoon. Since some of my friends were supposed to have veg, so Trincas was the best choice in park street area. The service was great as usual and ambiance was good too. But Don't know what was wrong that day...I food was extremely disappointing. Tofu was average. Chop seuy and baby corn were life saver. Mushroom was okay. But what disappointed us the most was the Drums of Heaven. It was as if chicken was dipped in gram flour and just deep fried. The Chicken sandwich and dessert was good. Hope to get some good food on next visit.

Houses three or fourdifferent themed eateries....BIF BITE....MING ROOM....TAVERN....OTHER ROOM

It would probably score more on the Indian cuisine compared to the other cuisines it serves....chinese is also fyn

Its speciality is the Kabuli naan and tikka butter masala....

For starters one can go for chicken sandwich and fish fingers

Ambience is awesome....specially when you enter in the evenings with live music to give u a bttr feel

A classy place and a courteous staff round up the review!!!!

The first of the series of big names in the park Street arena. It is a perpetual spot for meeting up. Trincas is one of those restaurants which has a refined old school feel. Service was fast. Food was delicious. Ambience is great. Prices are on the higher side but when you get such service you really don't mind. All in all,a lovely place to hang out with your squad or having a quiet dinner with your family or that special someone.
Must try: Spicy chilli pork in schewzan sauce and Roasted lamb in oyster sauce.

They have live music which is good enough for ur eardrums. 
Main highlight of this place is cheap liquor just like Olypub and Mags on park street but definitely better ambience than those two. Ambience is quite good on weekends though will find more elderly crowd at this place. Crowd mix was really good with everyone dancing and njoyin the band performances.

Planned to visit trincas for a reunion with friends. 
Atmosphere was vibrant and food was okayish. 
Well, 'partially' a thumps down for the service. The person who first came in to take the order seemed very rude and in a hurry to write down the order,whereas the one who served us the food was a gentleman. Overall it was a 3.5/5 * experience. Appropiate for family get together and reunions though, not a place to experience new stuff. A splendid "old charm" vibe stays here forever.

This is one famous restaurant of Park Street. Food tasted decent, wasn't out of the world tasty though. We tried wine which we got at a comparatively reasonable rate. Service was decent. 
Overall, a must try place as it is one of the old restaurants of Kolkata. It surely has some heritage attached.

An old time classic. Have been going to this place since college days. Even today a trip to this place brings out nostalgia, the Hindi songs are loud but the English section is great, specially the lady who sings. Food of course if not exceptional but is cheap and the drinks are cheap doesn't hurt your pocket. So a good place to just get sloshed.

Well I would love to edit my review! !
Trincas is one of such good old places where I wish to take my non-calcutta friends but last year when I went there I had to face not-so-good behaviour from the ppl there. Maybe because of the wkend rush or what I donno but earlier it was much better a junction to dine in.

It's a very old and prestigious establishment. The new look however is quite good and a good view of pedestrians of park streets adds to its charm. The Chinese food here may not compare to Chinese outlets like mainland China and others but its quite good. The plating is one of its greatest plus point. However servicing is average for such a prestigious hotel. However at the end food is what matters and that is very good.

Trincas is among one of the old restaurants in Park street.. I usually prefer going there on Saturday night due to the live band performance..  ambiance is very normal like other restaurants..  3/5 in ambiance..  3/5 in service.. Food is 3.5/5..  live band 4/5.. Awesome performance...  Specially after 9pm on Saturdays...  I always had the Chinese items here which are good..  Try it with gang n njoy the band performance n food..

Ambiance: Very ordinary. Space is huge with ample seating arrangements. 3/5

Service: They sure need an improvement in this area. We went there at around 5pm on a weekday which is definitely not peak hours, but we had to wait for 30 odd minutes to have our order on our table. We ordered for single portion of a dish, they confirmed the order, but they served us 2 plates of the dish in a single plate, which we couldn't notice earlier. Later, we found that out while paying the bill.
And they placed the final nail in the coffin when they literally stood by our table after the bill was paid, which meant they were waiting for their tips even after such a pathetic service. 0/5

Food: Very ordinary, nothing to go gaga over. We ordered for chilli paneer and crispy chicken.
Chilli paneer was ordinary, too spicy for my taste bud (well, I am lover of spicy foods). Literally, I had to gulp it down with water.
The crispy chicken tasted blunt. 6 pieces of small chicken came with french fries. The chicken were not succulent, and the skin was not crispy at all. 2/5

I would not recommend Trincas to anyone. Very much disappointed.

Featured under the legendary section of zomato, this popular restaurant from old days still excites my tastebuds. I used to come here with my family when i was a kid to celebrate new year or any other occasion and fell in love with their live performance section and indian food. Today i stopped by for a late lunch with my sister at 3pm after shopping . Our orders were 60 ml martini rosso vermouth , chelo kebabs and chicken ala kiev. Chelo kebabs here are the best which had chicken and mutton kebabs with a portion of rissoto rice , veggies and fried egg . On the other chicken a la kiev was perfectly made. Though the old charm of this place is being missed, my childhood memories and today's hunger pangs gives total rating of 5 to this place.

As I write this review I would like to state that if during the course of the 250 odd pieces I have written,if any is a 'homage' then this is it.

Trincas is Calcutta.No other establishment in the city has typified the heady days of the British capital of Calcutta to the down market 'Kolkata ' than this place.

Cliff Richard,Freddie Mercury,Engelbert Humperdinck,Pam Crain,Usha Uthup,Louis Banks and a host of other greats have played here.Time was when you had to book days in advance and arrive in your jacket and tie to be admitted here.In our childhood I remember being driven by and longingly looking outside my cab window at the beautiful people queueing outside to be admitted here.

The menu was strictly British club menu then and the Grills and the Bakes were predominant.

No longer.Trincas degenerated during the eighties,the predominantly Anglo Indian clientele and servers moved out and a new generation of cash rich but differently inclined people thronged this place.So inspite of the occasional Hotel California( a house favourite ) being played,they changed their music,their menu and probably the identity....for ever.

There were offshoots,the place was subdivided and the all pervading Indo Chinese invaded the place.The chilli chicken I had today was good but the chowmein was not but that is not the story.No one came to Trincas to just eat.It was a holistic experience sadly little of which remains today.

The buffet is good but I think they should try to revive the 70's atmosphere as the young crowd today dote on retro places where they can experience the Flower Power of the 60s and 70s

Amen to that

Luxury and comfort rolled into one.
May it be a business meeting or a friendly get together, this is the just the place to be.
Seat- nice, food- nice, ambience - nice, workers- nice....simply everything about this place is nice. Seems like a flawless place.
Variety can be seen in everything, may it be food or liqueur or mocktails or deserts.
Some outstanding ones really worth mentioning are their Sizzlers, tandoori-chicken,  tuti-fruti and obviously their mocktails (bizzy lizzy, blue bliss and fantasy green).

On a Saturday afternoon I and a friend went to Park Street for lunch and decided on spot on try out Trincas for we had already tried another big brand there several times.
Now Trincas is a big name, so the expectation was really high. However, the satisfaction to the expectation fell a bit short to the highest level. The primary reason being the atmosphere. Well, honestly if one goes by the atmosphere is just like any ordinary family restro-bar with a dash of sophistication served by the location. Its a peaceful but too plain an ambiance.
Even food is mediocre, nothing that exciting nor too plain. We ordered Cheloh Kebabs. Presentation was too simple compared to the brand name. The food did not look much attractive but tasted good.
Service was quick but again too simple. 
One may try it on occasions of family meals.

It was my elder bro's treat and so we chose this place for a cousins' hangout destination..The place welcomes you with a really royal ambience and if you visit there in the evenings you will be lucky enough to witness their live performances :) Trincas, one of the oldest restaurants of Park Street area lives up to it's reputation.. We ordered Black Dog Triple gold reserve scotch whiskey at first, then as starters Crispy Conjee Lamb and Chicken Salad, followed by Chelo kabab platters and a Gosht Platter as main dishes. Pleased with their quality of food and service (though few of the waiters were a bit indecent regarding tips), i recommend every foodie to visit here once provided you are set for a big budget :P

This place has awesome ambience, frankly speaking I have never been such an awesome place than Trincas. Had a lot of beer, whiskey and vodka. And oh wait for the food. Garlic chicken. Mixed hakka noddles and chilli chicken dry. Hospitality wad beyond the mark. But this place is a bit overpriced. Will visit this place again for sure :)

On a rainy day I visit this place at around 4 p.m. where they had a promotional 20% off on liquor. So preceding their reputation, I visit the place which is rather spacious and well laid out with a stage in front at the same time retaining the old school charm but that is standard fare at Park Street where people bank upon nostalgia as one of their biggest attractions. Unfortunately there was no live music at that point of time.
I had ordered a beer and Spicy Chicken Fingers.
The beer was cold and the staff cordial. However the food did take some time to be served and it was bland instead of spicy unlike the name suggested. It was more like standard chicken pakoda, nothing special. Maybe I should have tried out something else to change my view about the food.
I would like to visit again when there would be some live music and would try out the better food items they might have on offer.

Trincas is a legendary place. 

I have been to this place on numerous occasions along with friends and family. One of the places which my father used to take me during childhood days.

This place is nostalgic as I had the first beer of my life here only, ofcourse after crossing 18 years of age.

Good ambience,  friendly staffs and great food.
My suggestion is to keep the plans simple.

Drink as per your wish, choose a starter and finish off with a main course and side dish of your choice. Each and every dish that they make is absolutely perfect and that is why they are in business since long.

People who don't drink can try the fresh lime soda. It's refreshing. 

People who do not like live music can prefer to visit during the afternoon although the music will add to the experience. 

Trincas has never been disappointing to me. Hence, whenever I visit Calcutta, I make a point to visit Trincas as well.

Ambience: Very relaxed n chique. Ambience is certainly a winner for this place
Food: Very good n totally worth the extra dime. Very good collection of liquor so choose wtevr is ur poison.
Service: Very formal n nothing outstanding.
Price: A little on the pricier side but still pretty manageable. Just a notch above oly pub.
Overall a good place whether for first dates or casual hangout with family n frnz. Totally recommended n full thumbs up like.

At last managed to pay my maiden visit to this heritage joint. It was long overdue from my end. Dropped in on a weekday late afternoon. It was empty and the staff were merrily gossiping. After being seated for quite some time a waiter with a bored look on his face gave us the menu. We ordered starters and drinks. Nothing heavy because it was pay past lunch hour. Amongst the starters we ordered gosht seekh kebab and chicken boti kebab. The gosht seekh kebab was slightly dry unlike most places where it is moist. Taste wise it was okayish though wow factor was missing. The murgh boti kebab was too salty for my liking and bony too. Next we ordered chilly lamb and Szechwan fried chilly pork. Both the dishes were well-made. But the mood spoiler was excessive onion, capsicum and garlic. In fact both the Chinese dishes had pretty less quantity of meat in it. However I found out that the preparation of Chinese dishes was superior as compared to the Indian kebabs. Prices are  all right by Park Street standards. However service is not attentive at all. They had conveniently forgotten to serve drinking water once we were seated. Clearly this is a heritage joint that is way past its prime and living on past glory. Sigh! Same old tragic story of the culinary circuit of Kolkata

The food served here is tasty specially the dragon chicken. The staffs are one of the best in kolkata with a very cordial and helpful nature. The prices are quite affordable and the quality and quantity satisfies one and all. Very well maintained and clean-- a classy place to be with friends for a drink or with loved ones for relaxation.

Last month i was here with my friends for dinner. We were super hungry so we just ordered whatever and as fast as we can. We ordered indian. Firstly waited sooo long for the food. Second the food was not upto the mark. Didn't like the chicken dish at all. Paneer dish was still lil better. Quantity of the food was less. And as it is TRINCAS, quite renowned there was nothing 'wow' about this place nor the food. The way my other friends boasted about the food it wasn't the same. Compared to the low quality and taste of the food the amount we paid was not justified then. Unexpected. :( No second visit from our side.

Though trincas was a hub for activity back in the 90s my visit to it however showed me how maintenance can be a huge problem.
My first look at the old 'pub' wowed me the sheer extent trincas had was astonishing it had a fast food joint a separate area for Chinese
Our appetisers excited us with the pepper chicken with a minty chutney giving us a refreshing feeling in the heat of Kolkata the veg kebabs were wholesome and tasty.
However our appetisers only led us to a disappointing main course the Lamb being too sweet and the grilled fish( which was served whole) turning out to be entirely burnt on the outside and inside it was cold the only reason why this establishment got 2.5 was because of the appetisers I only suggest this place if u want to have a drink, some snacks or just want to see the old haunt.
Rest assured I will not be returning any time soon. :(

So I walked into one of Kolkata's legendary restaurant with my friend on a rainy evening. Well this place is all about the old world charm of Kolkata. 

The ambience though good not great. There are plenty more good restaurants doing business in the city now. There was live music...keeping up to the tradition of this place. I was not expecting to live Rabindrasangeet though.

We had fish and chips and a pot of jasmine tea. It was prepared well though portions could have been more.

Service was really good. The staff was not only  polite but helpful and friendly. They were swift and on their toes.

Overall ,this place is worth a visit for those seeking for that nostalgic feeling.

I have been visiting this place since the last 7 yrs. Excellent food, good music, nice crowd and hospitality. However, yesterday was a very bad experience in the Other Room Trincas which is on the 1st floor. We ordered for fish fingers, chicken wanton, spicy chicken fingers with some beer, whiskey and vodka. Main course were chelo kebab platter and mixed grill. While all the items were perfect mixed grill was just too salty n stinking. While we called the so called floor manager to taste the dish and discuss with the chef, he had the audacity to tell one of our Lady in the group this is how continental dishes are, may be you are having it for the first time. He was adamant he won't be changing the dish as there has not been any complaints from other tables - after much pursuation when a couple of other guests in other tables got to know the issue, they immediately pointed out they also had the same feeling while tasting and the Continental preparation both in platter and sizzler were too salty and was somewhat smelly and stinky. Knowing that he is getting into trouble the manager (so called, he don't deserve to be in the hospitality sector given his attitude and behavior), took away the dish and came back 5 mins back- to our surprise this was the same dish which he took away for replacement, just that they have tried to modify the taste with some addition and deletion of some ingredients. We were totally disgusted and have also filed in a written complaint downstairs, though I'm not very sure whether any heed will be given to the complaint by the management. The manager was not ready to divulge his name even after asking repeatedly. We got to know his name to SHAMIM, after enquiring downstairs. The experience was pathetic and disgusting. We did pay the bill minus the mixed grill but won't be visiting the place in near future. Won't recommend either. It's a zero rating from our side.
I would definitely want the Trincas Management to respond to this, if they are at all concerned.

Trincas is that place where u get very tasty food at a modest price. Good if you re giving a treat to a small group of friends, or a group of college goers wanna hit a restaurant n have a noisy meal. 
The portions in most dishes is good-big eaters needn't worry! There is something for everyone's taste-Chinese, fast food, American or slightly' continental! Their menu is pretty exhaustive with tonnes of choice and I see that the bar menu even tops the food menu!
Well the place is very clean but the waiters are straight faced and have a slight unfriendly expression on their face (like they don't wanna care). And the space is OK for lunch and evening. The place gets its maximum crowd after 8 pm and I always see a queue for tables. So if u happen to plan on dining here after 8.30pm, be ready to hear high decibel conversations from a couple tables beside you, all are a lil tipsy after a drink probably! 
I repeat here, food is very good, tasty and fresh always. I would rate Trincas better than Peter Cat any day!!!
Just be ready to wait a little to grab a table.

The history of the place dragged me in there on a puja evening with a couple of school friends. We were  lucky a get a quick seat but soon the loud music and cheap songs made us repent our decision. The food was pretty ordinary and the service was mediocre. Hopefully the management is taking good care of it now.

Trincas is not just about the food it serves,it is about our heritage,it is about the music,it is about the association it has with the Kolkata(or I should say Calcutta?) culture..Experts say good food and music forms an inseparable pair,which apply so aptly for this place..This place has witnessed some of the amazing rock musics and western classics back in the 60s and 70s..It is from this place the legendary Usha Uthup started her musical journey..Though sadly the quality of music in this place has gone horribly wrong with cheap Hindi songs being presented nowadays the food still lives up to its past reputation..I have spend quite a few enjoyable evenings at this joint with friends over a few drinks..The service is quite fast,the waiters have loads of experience and what catches your eyes the moment you enter this place is the old world charm..The decor,the seatings kind of remind you of the colonial pre-independance Kolkata..Coming to the food I personally favour the Chinese dishes above the Indian menus here..though the prices have gone up steeply in recent times the food is still quite delicious and prepared with much expertise..Only issue is they charge some extra tax on your alcohol..so be cautious about it..Last time we went there we ordered:
Dragon Chicken: Easily one of the best one I have tasted..the flavours were well balanced..loads of cashewnuts..loved the tanginess of the dish..Passionately Recommended..
Fish Malai Tikka: It was also nicely prepared..loved the smokiness of the dish..marinated perfectly..the cheese enhanced the taste of the dish..
Dry Chilli Prawn: Fresh cooked tiger prawns..loved the crispness of the prawns.. could have been better if salt used was a little less..
Together with the food we ordered some beers and cocktails..By the time we finished it we were too full to delve into main courses..will surely try them next time..Our total cheque comes to Rs.2400/-(incl tax) approx for 2 people..
Food: 4/5
Pricing: 3/5
Service: 3.5/5
Ambiance: 4/5

It was nice to be here again,a day before Christmas.Nothing much has changed here except the upholstery I guess (noticed between visits).
It was a classic songs night and I enjoyed sitting by the window with my Old Monk.
The memories of  Usha Uthup's still quite fresh here and you cajole an old waiter and here comes out one anecdote:).Love the old world charm.

Food isn't upto the mark. Seems like a premium restuarant but it's a joke. Apart from that, in the evening there's some failing bands who are ready to screw up your mood with their godforsaken music. Overpriced as compared to the quality! Everything here is ridiculous.

Good place. They maintain a standard here. The food is ok as  compared  to the price they charge which I think is a bit high comparing to the quality and quantity you get at restaurants in the neighboring area for the same price. Would like to go there once again and try something new. We tried Chinese cuisine which we found to be ok. The service is also ok.

Been there with my mom last summer. Though its a bit late but the restaurant still lingers in my mind because of the soothing lighting and a bit of Japanese touch to its interior decoration. My mom didn't expected the polao to be so tasty but still less spicy. We are overwhelmed by the services. They were calm even in such humid and hot weather and dealing well with the visitors.
Very nice place and I would suggest each foodie to be there once if you are in kolkata

Trincas is one of the names that always will stand out, make its place in the park street area. Having heard of it many times, lured me to this place. I went with my colleagues on a sultry Saturday evening after office. And I wasn't disappointed at all. The food, drinks, service, ambience was above standard, although a bit harsh on the pockets, it was worth it. The music was a bit loud to my liking. But the feeling was exactly as it would have been in a European or American pub. The continental dishes are worth noting. This is for the next foodie....... Hope u enjoy the place.

This review has been pending since long... Amazing place. Have crossed it many times but never thought of entering. But the day I did.. I loved it...

I prefer sitting in the middle section. Its bigger and during the day well lit. I visited both during the daytime as well as nighttime. And this place didn't disappoint me in either. During daytime sunlight reflects and u love it as u don't feel hot but u can enjoy it with your food. And during the evening there was a live singer .. She sang beautifully and was also taking requests.

The drinks are priced normally as in restaurant and the mixture they offered was hot crispy and yummy. It reminded me of the road side vendor who sell hot mixtures with peppy taste.  The seekh kebab was pleasurably tasty. Freshly prepared. Never had better seekh kebab.. This a must try.....!! 

Also I had tried Chinese that was good too the regular chow and veggies in gravy.  But definitely I wana go for more. 
Though I m a vegetarian I am sure this place offers good non veg food too as I see it is crowded with bongs. 

Do try and gimme your feedback:) so that I can try the veg options once I go ;)
Pocket pinch for two without alcohol is rs. 600 approx

I have been here a couple of times.  The prices of alcohol and food is not exorbitant.   Everything is still very 90s here with the live music and band and the hindi songs from the 80s-90s. Though I would like the band to sing a some better songs nit those 'dil toot gaya and pyar loot gaya' type of the 90s, but well , this is what makes this plce unique. So if you dare to step into this place in the eve, be ready to hear some loud hindi songs of the 90s.

Trincas is one of the oldest legendary restaurants in Kolkata. It has one of the finest collection of spirits to chose from. Ambience is good if you are a music lover with live music singers and bands complimenting well with their mouth watering starters and booze. Kebabs are a must try. Still an average place for me specially cos of the crowd and price. Good for one timer.

I loved the ways Gavin strummed the electric guitar confidently. even with people giggling and hollering..and the idiot box gleaming with ipl action etc ...they played my request in the end...smoke on the water by deep purple...and it was spot on..the riffs...the jiggling of voice et al....taken care of nicely. ..so I rate it high...a class apart from the usual dining places...food here I can't say much about.  .was full with chelo kabab n all desserts from peter cat...so just sipped on a mocktail...ano ther friend of mine was guzzling heineken...

My first visit to this place...aah n its just so perfect! The live music, food, drinks, service, the good old retro ambiance, just cant get enough of this place.

Been two years in this city and my exploration is still in its infant stage. This place has given me the feel of how i used to perceive Kolkata in terms of other nightlife (movie parineeta influence). Well, I thoroughly enjoyed spending my Saturday night. Oh not to mention the courteous staff & the band who played music on request. 

People, anybody new like me do not miss this place. Good times waiting for you at Trincas..Cheers! 

P.S.  Was too high on music n everything else to review the food, though can assure, you wont be disappointed!

Eating at Trincas is sort of travelling back in time. The place held on its old ambience and style with live music and song request, occasional dancing by the visiting people and  birthday wishes.
Service is excellent. Food varies from good to average. But it will not make you unhappy. The pricing is good.
Overall I personally like the place - still have an heritage charm to it.

Food n music combined gives most of us d thrill. D shredded lamb tasted awesome. D alcohol n food served is good n blends perfectly with d soothing ambience. d music played there makes us feel special just like I felt when my bf chose trincas to propose me with a beautiful engagement ring. Hence, it will always hold a special place in my heart. :) n I visit Trincas quite often too. The mixed grill sizzler can improve. D chilly roast lamb is my favourite dish along with the pan fried beckti in lemon butter sauce and also baked beckti supreme. I feel so nostalgic whenever I visit this place n this place is sure my partner's favorite!  :)

Trincas. The place where the Bengali Icon "Usha Utthup" once performed. The place takes you back years to the glorious bengali past but fails to recreate the same joy. The food has lost its flavour and the live band plays the same 90's music all the time. The place is filled with creepy single men too drunk to handle themselves oogling at the women seated with you. I say clean up your mess or you will perish soon.

Trincas is a joint set up by Mr. Trinca, a Swiss in the 1930s after parting with Mr. Flurys, another Swiss of Flurys fame! Historically, Trincas has been more of a bar than a restaurant. Trincas is the place which started the careers of Usha Uthup and Biddu. Incidentally, Trincas is the only place on Park Street where music hasn't stopped for a single day for the past 50 years. In terms of food, let’s give this place a passe – let us remember it for it’s history, it’s music and it’s liveliness – once upon a time, in it’s heydays.

It's one of those places that Kolkata stands for, though, I am not sure how long can Trincas survive the onslaught of newer and sleeker babies on the block. Located at the heart of the city, Trincas is an average beer-in-a-bar place with live music and affordable prices. The waiters are from the last century and the place retains them for the old world charm they bring.

We went there as a group of four person and thoroughly enjoyed it. We had Both Indian and Chinese there and none disappointed. The chelo kebab it served up was in no way bad than its opposite end counterpart Peter Cat. And the cost of everything including drinks was all very affordable.

There are restaurant in park street which are much better than trincas. Thier usp is live music,  but if I rate their choice of song it will rate it as 3/5. If you are choosing Trincas for live music then it is not the option. 
We had ordered Mixed grill sizzler which was tasty but the chicken was hard 3.5/5
The mixed hakka noodels was tasty 4/5
But the ambience is good to come with family and have a good evening not a place for hangout with friends.

Beer n fish kebabs n prawn cocktails were favs of mine. Food wise i was happy and so was the ambience. Live bands are played there. Not to offend anybody. I don't like the loud music n genres of music played there BTW tastes varies from person to person. There is scope to better their food menu and make preparations much worth of money. Other wise it's been old place and has its it own share of history. Probably if time n mood permit I shall visit again. As I still love the old good charming Park Street.

Trincas is one of the most iconic and old restaurants in Kolkata. If you are in the city and haven't visited it yet, you must.

The menu is rich with many varieties and so are the drinks. There are different sections in the restaurant that one can choose from. Good quality live bands play while you dine and I won't rank them among the average ones. They are good.

The prices are not too high but not too low either. If one wishes to have a relaxed time alone or with others, step in and you won't be disappointed.

Any guy who's visiting kolkata must must go to "Trincas".
- this place has a get up of restro/lounge which will reminds you of 80's 
- live music is the bestest part of this place, they play oldies . So the one who enjoy light music " you are in for a treat here"
- food is available at a very nominal rates 
Hard drinks are almost of same range as available at usual places

Trincas is no doubt a place to hang out with friends if you have classy choice. The ambience will make you feel like you are in British Era. No doubt its a bit costly but worth it. Food quality is too good... a must visit place if you are a foodie.

I heard about Trincas a lot. Been there last evening for the first time. It was expensive, but it was worth something. Classy, well decorated, soothing environment. Nice food and drinks combination. Waiters are well educated, and well informed about the recipes of the dishes. last evening, it made my dinner with my girlfriend memorable.

This legendary restaurant had the look decor and feel of the sixties of our city. Its location at the heart of the city just besides the Park Hotel's entrance makes it all the more visible and appealing! No wonder even my grandfather had memories of this place! And the singers of the band is great. I love the band's male lead singer's voice. A perfect place for a drink and dinner and good old live music! Oh i know that the chelo is famous at Peter cat, but it's a must try here! If you don't want too much of the music, there's always The Ming Room, just perfect for a family! A must visit, atleast for the band! !!

Worst experience. Heard about this restro alot. But yesterday's experience was terrible. The music was so loud and that was irritating people. They are even not offering tissues. Every tive we have to call them twice thrice to get water also. After that they have served  chilly garlic roast lamb which was completely burned. They try to convince us that that is the flavor which suppose not to be because no one of us was able to eat that. Then after lots of argument they cancelled the order. Very poor service quality. Trincas is a brand name and the name is taken into the list of top restros in Park Street. Please guys try to improve the food quality as well as the service quality.

Who can forget the scene from gorsthane sabdhan(though originally it was blue fox)..it really a park street restaurant in its true sense with live music during dine in..
1.Ambience-its not that great but its above average and have a true park street charm.
2.Reception-again its a park street restaurant so its great
3.Food-above average..sizzlers are good
4.price-its the cheapest restaurant after bar b q in the block (oly pub not taken into account)
Final verdict it's the oldest park street restaurant just go n have a dinner to have a charm of true park street restaurant.

Well as elders say, this one perhaps was a legendary restaurant in the 80's with live performance and good food. I went there couple of years back and to tell you honestly i didn't find it that great. Considering the standard of other Park street restaurants, food here is below average. I just like their sand witch. Other than that I can't remember anything worth mentioning. I wonder, unless a fanatic of old times, leaving all other places why would one really wanna come here.

Trincas and the accompanying romance that it evokes in so many may have had its day under the sun but in its present avatar happens to be rather average. I had ventured in once with a friend on a cool December night. A band was playing soothing music. We ordered Beer, Chicken Pakora and Chelo Kababs. The food arrived and it was ok. In between we asked the Live Band to perform a Pink Floyd number which sounded simply amazing. Though tje food seemed ordinary the smbience was very pleasant. It's a one-time experience.

This legendary restaurant has the feel of the Kolkata of the sixtees & seventees era. The live band performance is still a thing which excites me every time i visit here. It has got that old Kolkata Charm that my parents keep talking about. The very nostalgia associated with this place makes it special. The waiters have been here for ages and knows the pulse of the guests who visit here regularly. You can make out the regulars here by the way they sit here for hours and listen to the songs and interact with the band members while they sing. The chicken tyangri kabab is very very tasty and so is the chilly chicken. Last time i tried the chicken clear soup and it was nice.  The band members are quite interactive and would take in song requests from guests and croon. They do sing modern songs both hindi & english but it is best when the old retro numbers are being sung and you enjoy it thorughly over a glass of alcohol. If you want to have a chit chat with friends then this is not a preferred place as the music is loud enough. Its a place when friends can go to hang out and enjoy the live band music over a few glasses of their favourite drink and some food. A must visit place if you are one of those who want to get a retro feel. This was the place where the legendary singer Usha Uthup started her career as a singer and the rest is history.

Was taken out on a date to this place. The ambience was great with live performance going on. Had heard a lot about this place, it was worth a visit. 
We ordered cello kababs and mixed grill sizzler. Just the cello kebab was good(better than peter cat), didnt like the other kababs or the butter rice. The mixed grill platter had chicken steak, mutton patty, two slices of bacon, fried egg, fish cutlet, a sausage and fries. Went during happy hours, so got 20% off on drinks. Overall the food was alright and the ambience great. 
Had a great company, enjoyed a lot, will visit again.

All the glowing tributes I had heard about this place are so true. Went there with a couple of friends in the evening. It was 6.45 n patrons were just walking in -the music started with old hindi n bengali numbers. We ordered subzi seekh kebab with two cocktails n two mocktails. Mine was called bizzy lizzy n had citrus flavour while a friend ordered green fantasy with lime flavour. The kebab was just of the right consistency n tasted yum. Meanwhile the music turned to 80's hits n everybody was having a good time-the singers also obliged us with a request number. The main course had also arrived by then- butter naan, egg fried rice, paneer khurchan n one chicken dish (forgot the name). Was told the chicken was nicely done n the rice quantity sufficient. The naans were fluffy n the paneer khurchan was one of the best paneer dishes I have tasted in recent times. Unfortunately we could not accommodate dessert. The cheque was around 4000 for 5 people including drinks. It was 9 n the English numbers were just beginning as we left the place -I'm definitely coming back.        My second visit to this place today turned into a horrifying experience. We had ordered veg wanton soup. My companion found out that we had been served chicken wantons instead of veg. He had taken just one bite. Mercifully I had not yet touched the wanton -I'm a vegetarian. The waiter assured that it was veg -when presented with evidence, finally they admitted the goof up. The waiter insisted that it was the kitchen staff's fault. We were told such mistakes can sometimes happen!!! I'm afraid I've to reduce the ratings from 5 to 3 because people visit a place like trinca's for the whole experience n not only the food. I feel let down as I had only suggested the place to my friend.

Trincas is one of the many places to hit at The Park. If you are going for lunch then I will not suggest this place. The food is not out of this world and the drinks are a bit overpriced for me. But if you are going there at night, then this place is a little different with live music playing. You might enjoy it at night. Overall as a foodie, I will not rate this place more than average.

This place was in my wishlist for a long time. So suddenly visited to have a sunday dinner. It was a nice musical night with beautiful songs going on. The hospitality is good.
We ordered Shrimp cocktail which is a bit tangy in taste and i think shrimp should be more in number rather than egg slices. Our next dish is Pepper chicken which is well cooked with soft chicken pieces and curry leaves and then lastly we ordered Sizzler Chicken Chelo Kebab which as a whole is good to taste but not upto the mark as i expected it to be.
The bill was 2200 including 2pegs of Absolut vodka and 3pegs of BP.
My overall experience is good and hope to visit someday if possible.

Blah!!!! One of the worst restaurants i have ever visited.
Went there during the puja of 2013 on navami for lunch. We had actually planned to go to Peter cat but seeing the queue outside we opted for Trincas. We did'nt have to wait long. 
Once we entered we were greeted politely by the manager himself. Till that time we were pretty much impressed. 
Now when it came to ordering food we ordered chicken malai kebab alongwith 1 budweiser n 1carlsberg. The kebabs were just average. Next we ordered American chopsuey. It took quite a long time. So in the meantime we ordered another budweiser. But when the chopsuey came OMG it was disastrous. Even my para restaurants make better chopsuey than them. The dish contained a lot of prawns which tasted like they were uncooked or just boiled. Ugh....
Moreover there was too much of gravy. 
Maybe due to too much of orders during the puja had they served such low quality dish. But i had a very bad experience there. 

However the ambiance is good, there is ample space for incorporating large groups. But the pricing is a bit high. They charge you with a lumb sum amount of tax. Will not b visitng again...

With an outstanding amalgamation of food and music; Trincas, rightfully lives upto it reputation. I was there with my college buddies on the night of IPL 2014 finale, which, though added an extra vial of enthusiasm, however didnt surpass the exclusivity of the place in itself. Brilliant layers of cuisines poured one after the other proved to be just the sumptous treat any foodie would need. Music was excellent with Jennie in the vocals. Ambience was just the right one. All in all its a must visit and a must revisit.

Visited Trincas on 9th September with a friend to celebrate my birthday.. The ambience was very good not too jazzy with soothing music. We ordered Dragon chicken, Chicken tangri kebab, Mixed chow, Fish in garlic sauce, 2 beer (although Tuborg was not available) and a glass of Four seasons white wine.. The food tasted awesome specially the dragon chicken and the fish. But the prices of the items had increased a lot.. The total bill was Rs 1900 with minimum breakage of the taxes implied on the drinks.But still had an awesome experience on my bday because the food was really worth it and looking forward to visit again :)

Visited trincas on 7th sep 2014. It was partly out of curiosity and partly because my partner didn't want to go to oly pub that we came to this place... There was a live performance going on... The singers were good... But I had no clue why they were playing horribly sad monotonous songs of way back 80's ! However ,  I did enjoy some of it... Coming to the food... We ordered chicken tandoori full , 2 large peg vodka( white mischief) with 2  orange juice , and 2 large whisky peg(blenders pride)...  Guess the price........???  I thought it would be something around 1200 Max !! But the bill came around at a whopping 1700 !!!  Which means the price is not transparent and loaded with a lot of tax !  Orange juice was taken as rs 150 in the bill for each glass plus taxes .... So yes basically pricing is not transparent ! And not a very good neither very bad experience .... I'll visit again maybe ... But have to be careful while ordering .... One small glass of orange juice at 150 + tax is seriously not justified.... !

A very popular evening joint. Nicely lit, well decorated & nothing too flashy. They just kept it simple & elegant. Before reviewing the food let me first review the staffs of this bar cum restaurant. They are very attentive. Always at the right place at the right tym. They gave us the best centre seat with amazing view of the stage where singers were performing. The food was also very good, simply garnished in a classic way and was very tasty. Don't try the golden fried prawn. For us it was a disaster because of it's bitter taste. Just try chilli garlic prawn if u prefer prawn to compliment your drinks. Fish finger, chicken dishes we enjoyed very much. Please visit this restaurant. I recommend it strongly. Cheers!!

This place a hang about itself and has been one of the oldest and nostalgic places of the city. At the heart of the city, Park Street, Trincas is a very famous establishment with very comfortable sitting conditions, chilling AC and smoking zone. One can also enjoy a live performance but the sound is soothing and comfortable enough so as to strike a conversation with your friend. Well, I have been an old and faithful customer to this place, so the waiters are nice to me, but then again, I feel they are very courteous and friendly in their way. The place is a bit expensive, the food quality has also dipped to my liking, still I keep on visiting this place, because lots of memories are still attached to it.

Ok..I had heard a lot about the place since i came to Calcutta. Wanted to try this one out. So went on a Saturday evening. Like other well known places on Park street this too was very crowded. We went in a group of 5 and got a comfortable sofa seat at a corner with the good view of the Live music being played. Yes... the live music was a little too loud at the beginning.. which I did nt like..coz it was making talking difficult to even the person right next to u. But then beyond 9 pm as Candy and her Band started playin some cool songs..it felt better. Coming to food.. it was a chicken overdose for us..crispy pepper chicken, irani chicken, chicken lasuni kabab, drums of heaven wer all yum.. so wer the paneer and baby corn Manchurian. Along wid  beer it made my evening jus perfect. Price was a bit on the higher side though... but thats ok considering alcohol prices... All in all mus visit for ppl who are looking to relax over some good music and some booze

When you step into this very renowned eatery, the first thing that amazes you is the price ; next is the quality of food.. No, this place doesn't make  food which makes you drool over it for decades ;but when you factor in the price, the ambience, the location, the live music.. It makes for a very good value for money proposition...  Don't even think about trying anything other than a Indian, and if you don't you shall be pleasantly rewarded with food that scores high both on quality and quantity.. Perfect for those outings when your budget doesn't permit you to splurge! :)

It was my wish that i go to this restaurant once, while i stay in Kolkata. And fortunately i got this opportunity in the previous week, to hangout in this place. The Trincas is known for its, special small bites, so I tried the Fish fingers with tartar sauce. after that we all tried the shrimp cocktail, it was something weird to me, but i guess it is meant to taste like that, i am not expert in culinary. Then the prawn tetrazini struck my mind. Actually i love tasting new kind of foods, so yes, i tried this, and actually it it didn't suit me well. However now i went with the Indian style, kebab, and the bd 12 yo teachers origin, and at last that suited me well enough to give this restaurant a 3.0 points. Well guys, you can go here once, but it's better for dates, rather then friend hangouts, so guess what, maybe, it's my fault.

When it comes to good pubs in Park Street, Trincas scores higher than others. The rustic charm, the buzz of the place, the live music in the evening and the lovely food. It all makes trincas one of the best and I always make sure to recommend it to my friends over other places in Park Street. 
About the food, I would recommend everyone to try out the mixed grill. It is a great combination of lamb, chicken, sausages and bacon with eggs. The prices are pretty reasonable. A great place to take your friends out to. 
Make sure you visit trincas for dinner to catch the live performances.

The food is really good. I love their chicken starters. Booze isn't really cheap, but definitely moderately priced. 
The only thing I don't like about the place is the way the waiters keep looking at your table/ standing right beside you_!.... Leaving that, the ambience is nice. :)
It is not my favourite restaurant in park street. But good enough to be visited again.

the ambience is good.. dim lights .. live music .. if ur in for a drink .. the best time wud b after 9.30 .. thats when d blues r played and its a treat really ..
food is just above average .. the pork ribs r my fav .. crispy lamb too .. quantity is good .. service is fine and quite quick ..
The worst thing about Trincas is that if you are not a regular chances are that you will be asked to sit in a corner table, or at a table very far from the main stage.

Trincas Ming Room

This has been one of my fav hangouts in the busy park street area. Not much needs to be said about Trincas which is probably one of the most famous park street institutions.

The ming room is glass enclosed. One can see the live performances in the main Trincas while the sound is low enough to have a relaxed conversation with your friend. Chilled AC , good smoking room and very friendly staff. The golden fried prawns are a delight. The mixed grill is a great combi of lamb, chicken, sausages and bacon with eggs. The lamb steak is a great dish too. Not much need to be said of the live performances, which sets the place apart. No better place to hand out with friends over a few drinks in a true Calcutta heritage feel.

Costly place. Good food. Clean toilet. Location is easily accessible. Inside environment is good. But orchestra is too loud although sings well. Waiting time is moderately less. Giant screen TV for enjoying matches and all. Nice place for hangover with friends, family, colleagues. A total like if expense isn't negotiated. Satyajit Ray used to visit trincas during his days :)

I visited this place like yesterday with my brother and sister in law. 
"What a wonderful restaurant, such a nice ambiance.", they say.
I couldn't see anything to support that statement,
The food was average, quantity was in the minor side. Ambiance was OK and the music was way too much loud and at instants you can feel the need of an ear bud. Coming to service which should be their USP, 
If they will forget some of your orders then be ready to listen this line from them, " Bhool gaya main abhi banwata hoon".
Now u need to wait and wait and wait for almost 20-25 minutes sitting idle on your table. They will never feel the need to apologize for their mistake and you will ask this question to yourself y did u ever come here.

Regular daily bar in Park Street. Live loud music when I visited. Too much light and not very perfect seating, but its consistent and been there for a while and at the right place. Good food, but what I liked here was the service. I visited on a monday and was suprised with the crowd visiting the place. There is a small closed area where the noise levels are lower. But if in Kolkata on a weekday definately the place for an evening drink.

I really love the ambiance of Trincas. This place is dimly lit and the staffs are really co-operative and well mannered. These two are the first thing that always comes into my mind when i hear "Trincas". In the evening live music is played there. There are two women who sings and another man who plays octopad and also sings well(I really liked his performance), the guitar and other instruments like saxophone are also worth mentioning. 
The food is secondary here, cause I never liked its food quality with the price they offer. Food quantity is fine but if u ask about food quality, it is just above average.
Things tried-
1) Chelo
2)Nun
3) Veg Malai Kofta
4)Peas Polao
5)Chicken Tava Masla
If you look for a drink with music you can obviously look for Trincas , it will be great if you go after 9:30. Not a very great place to have dinner if you look for quality foods.

I learned about this place quite a long back. Went first time in the last pujas. This place is quite vintage but nothing pleasing. Decor was quite ordinary. There was a lady singing in a monotonous tone.
When it comes to service, yes people were friendly and suggestive.
Food didn't stand out perfectly. It was very normal like other road side joints. Chicken was less spicy no good flavour. Nun served quite plain without a slight hint of butter. Vegetable dish had peas undercooked.
On the whole it wasn't satisfying.

Came here with a few friends on a weekday and had a good experience overall. What I loved about this place is the live band playing popular English songs and in the between some Bollywood numbers as well. The food was excellent to say the least. I especially loved the chicken irani folks to go off with the chilled beer. They have a small separate smoking section as well which I've heard it to be a recent development. The pricing was very reasonable keeping in the mind the location of the pub. The service could have been a bit faster. Otherwise, overall, a good place.

At Trincas after a long time--gosh just the other day "Uncle Josh" and "Omi" greeted you and visited you at your table. Eve and Usha,the Sunday Jams...all nostalgia.Time seems to have stood still. the decor and ambience remains very similar ,and the Tandoori prawns,chicken and nans taste just as good.The Continental fare is quite good especially the Bektigrilled or fried. Steaks anyone ???
The smoky atmosphere,the husky Hava Nagila and soulful California Dreamin of Usha are just memories.
Trincas youre still very much there--so folks do drop by for ol Cals sake !!

I like Trincas for the fact that food and drinks served is cheaper than any other decent restaurant on park street. Music played is mostly the most popular English songs which find a liking by an aam aadmi in India. However I mostly music a tad louder than what it needs to be. 

Its a nice hanging out place with your friends but certainly not a place where you can take your date.

Went here on the day before Valentine's day, the place was sparsely filled. The waiters were very courteous and well behaved. We went there cause this is one of the few if not the only place that provides live music. Well the music was a disappointment, they played mostly old hindi songs and the music was very loud. We ordered chilli garlic roast lamb for starters along with alcohol, the taste was good and the quantity sufficient for 2 people. For main course we ordered chicken tetrazini, they served it with mashed potatoes and some fresh broccoli, olives and green and yellow pepper, the taste was good but the cheese was overdone though. They had decorated the place with heart shaped balloons for Valentine's day and it was a pleasant experience.

There is hardly a single foodie in Kolkata who has not heard about Trincas. This is one of the oldest and poshest restaurants, located at 17 B, Park Street, Kolkata. The moment you step inside you feel the same warmth and cosiness as people felt years ago when they dropped in here to enjoy delectable delicacies.  The ambience is good; service is excellent. Most important of all you never feel neglected. There is always a waiter to respond at your beck and call. For years I have passed by Trincas, hardly getting an opportunity to step in and enjoy a plateful of delicacies.  I have wondered how it must feel to eat in one of the posh restaurants whose popularity has not undermined even after so many years of inception.  My opportunity came on the Christmas day when I decided to have my lunch there with my family. 

The place was overcrowded; afterall it was Christmas day. Nevertheless we waited in a long queue (for 20 minutes) till our turn came.  Seated comfortably in what I say one of the cosiest corners, I looked around to find a whole crowd of foodies thronging there to enjoy lipsmacking lunch at Trincas.  A waiter, cordial and courteous, handed us the menu card. After flipping through the pages of the menu card, we ordered our food- a sumptuous meal comprising of chilli mustard chicken, crispy ginger chicken, peas pulao, chicken do piaza, chilli chicken and chicken fried rice. I must say food was delicious. The chicken pieces were fresh and juicy and aroma of the different spices was simply tantalizing! Here I would like to mention that chilli chicken served in most restaurants is always too spicy. The generous amount of chillies used for cooking chilli chicken almost brings tears in your eyes. At Trincas, the chilli chicken was neither too spicy, nor too bland. It was just perfect for our taste buds.

A lavish meal was incomplete without yummy desserts. So, we ordered some hot gulab jamun with ice cream, which was merely awesome.  The taste of the of the hot gulab jamun with cold ice cream lingered in our mouths long time after we had licked our platter clean.  I had a nice experience at Trincas and I would visit this restaurant again to enjoy another lipsmacking meal.

The worst thing about Trincas is that if you are not a regular chances are that you will be asked to sit in a corner table, or at a table very far from the main performance stage. The front tables are all reserved for the regulars. Live performances are good, but be prepared for old hindi songs and lots of medleys.

'Trincas' is all time preferred by foodies who want to eat in style while listening to live music. I went there with my friend Soumitra Kumar Sahoo to have some drink. The menu, although extensive, actually has few items in stock but I know what to order. We ordered ‘Carlsberg Elephant Beers’ alongwith ‘Crispy Ginger Chicken’ and ‘Crispy Chilly Lamb’ (boneless) with tartar sauce followed by ‘Chocolate Brownie Ice Cream’ with hot chocolate sauce. There is nothing exceptional about this restaurant - it is not bad, but that is not the quality I look for. Coming to the food, it is tasty but as I said - there is nothing in it to leave a mark or impression. This is a cool place to hang out with friends or families but the pocket pinch will make you think a lot also.

We were roaming in park street and wanted to go to some good place for food, by mistake we zeroed on this place.....the performers were singing Hindi song which was very loud and bad, and after 9, a new band (English) came which was far better than the previous one...the Food was not tasty and what can I say about the service, we were kept waiting for good 10-15 minutes and when we inquired about the order the response was not that positive....I think this place is only running because it is situated in park street

Trincas represents the onset of the poshiest area in Calcutta, the inimitable Park Street. Like most places there it is an embodiment of the vibrant nightlife of Cal, and has been/was instrumental in Calcutta's own swinging seventies and eighties. Everyone from my parents' generation swears by it. Unfortunately if my recent experience there (and of many others judging from the reviews) is anything to go by, it has turned into this joyless, morbid place overrun by an officious staff with no clue about the tenets of customer service.

Me and my then fiance (now wife) had gone there for a quick bite for lunch on a Saturday. The place was deserted, which was puzzling for a Saturday. We were ushered in by an uninterested middle aged gentleman. We ordered a couple of glasses of scotch and fish fingers to go with it. The fish fingers arrived in time, but the scotch was nowhere to be seen. On enquiring the waiters quipped that we seemed underage for drinking and hence they wouldn't be serving us alcohol. Imagine my hair raising frustration when I barked at the guy as to why had he not checked with us about it. I'm all for restricting underage drinking, but isn't there a modicum of common sense to be applied by checking this fact from the customers themselves rather than making assumptions and desisting to serve alcohol? I was carrying my ID which I promptly showed to them, unfortunately my wife did not have any ID on her. So they insisted that I could consume alcohol, not her. My wife, ever the pacifier, urged me not to make a hue and cry about this and said that she could do without the scotch and would rather gorge on the food. All fine and sorted, you say? Well that waiter actually stood close by our table to ensure my wife so much as wasn't sipping at my glass of scotch. That was the last straw. I gave him a piece of my mind by reminding him that babysitting customers was not within his call of duty, swiftly paid the bill and stormed off this place.

Mine was an impromptu visit to Trincas on one fine Saturday night when we hoped to get cheaply drunk (I was so wrong) and fill our bellies before heading off to Roxy. 

We ordered some Long Island Iced Teas but to at the first sip itself, I discovered to my dismay that the bartender was totally lost to the idea of an LIIT! It tasted of only cheap Rum and nothing else. We repeatedly asked the waiters to amend or replace the drink but all the requests fell on deaf ears. Then the manager came in and we proved our point to him, but he refused to be of any help in the end.

We asked for some usual veg starters too, which were also pretty average. Disappointed, we finally left, paying some 2500 bucks for almost nothing!

The only thing I could  appreciate was the live music performance going on there. Also, the ambiance seems to a cross(in a bad way) between a shady bar and a family restaurant. My recommendation would be: Avoid (specially if you are with friends) and rather head to OlyPub or other nearby restaurant.

The annoying music, the unpleasant ambiance and extremely cramped seat spacing (amongst other reasons) have put Trincas on my list of places to never visit again. What was once a famous and prestigous joint has now reduced to a cheap place where the wrong kind of crowd flocks to to enjoy the sight of the scantily dressed woman singing cheap Bollywood numbers. The food eeps also quite poor and the prices were extremely high. 
Trincas,  once a glorious joint, is now not worth a visit.

This place is now no good, food-wise. The quality of the live music has deteriorated greatly. Instead of the classic English songs (usually jazz) that were the hallmark of the place, we now hear 1990s English pop songs if we're lucky, and Bollywood if we're not. I suppose it's done to please the crowd that patronizes the place regularly these days.

Alcoholic beverages, which are what most people come here for,  are heavily watered down. Cocktails are the worst sufferers. The food is quite bad, and there is a menu for formal purposes alone - the establishment wants patrons to concentrate on the alcohol. The waiters are indifferent and the service for food is slow, possibly because they're rarely asked to serve it. Certainly not a place to go for anything.

Trincas is one of those places which still tries to reprise Kolkata's reputation as the 'Paris of the Eat'. Calcutta, as it was known some moons ago, was a great place to party, and Trinca holds on to that. So what if the music ain't that great? It's a happy place with a lot of buzz, decent starters and well-priced booze. 
It's also one of a dying breed where you can request a song and swing a leg, without gyrating like a coke-addled moron to trance. 
Trincas is old school, and i simply love it! 
As for the food, it's Ok, but like i said, this is one place i visit for reasons other than food. you can always pick a kathi roll after you're done dancing and drinking.

Eat in style at Trincas! 3 out of 5

Trincas is one such restaurant in Kolkata that has witnessed the changes in the city in the last five decades, yet has been able to retain its uniqueness and authenticity. Not long back, eating at Trincas was a class symbol. The restaurant became even more popular for iconic singer Usha Uthup, who used to give regular jazz and pop music performances at Trincas during the 70's. Time changed and many more restaurants opened up in Park Street, but even today Trincas is preferred by foodies who want to eat in style while listening to live music.  Trincas became popular for upholding the so-called pop culture in Kolkata. It is one of the oldest restaurants where people dined listening to light music or enjoying dance forms like cabaret.  But, these are only added factors that make Trincas popular. Trincas serves lip-smacking food and that is the main reason behind their popularity and fame for so many decades.

A whole lot of items are listed on their menu card and people often get confused while placing their order. I have been to this restaurant thrice in the last year alone, and every time I found myself jumping from one item to another until the waiter helped me to select a few items.  Yes, it is just not possible to taste every item listed on the menu. Nevertheless, I have had a chance to taste their really delicious chicken pakoras, paneer sheekh kebab, chicken malai kebab, dragon chicken, chilli prawns, chilli garlic roast lamb, chilli pork dry, panner tikka masala, chicken bharta, fish jhalfrezi, chicken pulao, peas pulao, buttered lachha paratha and chicken tetrazzini during my visits at Trincas and all of them were respectable. 
I really liked their date pancakes with ice cream and caramel custard, which I had twice after my sumptuous meal.  I think Trincas must be given credit for serving delectable cocktails of which my favourite is their Pina Colada. Everytime I have been at Trincas, I have a Pinacolada.

Eating at Trincas is an expensive affair (a meal for two costs about Rs.1200 + tax). But, visit this restaurant once and you'll really love their lip-smacking preparations - and the music is nice too!

Over all I enjoyed my Saturday.

This place is done very well, which serves good food with reasonable pricing. This one is located on Park street, beside Park Hotel. The ambience is well done and looks pretty decent and stylish. I loved their Chelo but yes Peter Cat is better I must admit. The choice of cocktails and mocktails are quite vast and they taste nice. The continental section also serves good and scrumptious food. 
The staff are friendly and cordial. They try to help you as much as they can and makes you feel homely and comfortable.
Overall I enjoyed my meal and had a great time with my family so I rate it 4 without any kind of hesitation.

park street of the 70sand 80s had its myth built around few joints that would scribble their names forever in the minds of kolkatans.the vintage charm of trincas is the reason we go there.its like listening to 80s rock,metal. they have live music and a dining set up built around the cabaret theme.continental food is a speciality here.you can go for the platters,selections that the chef has decided upon.its a place where you would like to linger for a while.come outside and your tryst with the time capsule is gone,you again belong to the new world.

A brilliant place to catch up with friends over a peg of scotch or a bottle of chilled beer,with live music playing in the background and a decent crowd.

Ordered beer,chicken pakodas(boneless) and fish fingers with tartar sauce followed by chicken tikka butter masala and masala kulcha.The live band performance was the attraction of the evening. The band performances were in English and Hindi both.GREAT food and an unforgettable experience.

Trincas is an old name when it comes to Park Street dining. There is nothing exceptional about this restaurant - it is not bad, but that is not the quality we look for! In my scale I would say that it is an overpriced and average joint which is cashing in mainly on its location and word-of-mouth publicity.

The menu, although extensive, actually has few items in stock. If you order some of their less popular dishes to try out something new, chances are you will not get it. The service is excellent though - with the waiters going to the extent of craftily suggesting 'better' dishes for the ones they can't serve. This is diabolical in some sense, but they are mostly polite. The only man I would mark as cunning and just bad (bleh!) is the doorman. He is unfriendly and sometimes refuses to open the door, and you are inclined to push it open yourself. It is not that I mind it, for me it is nothing; but I have seen many people who do.

Coming to the food, it is tasty but as I said - there is nothing in it to leave a mark or impression. There are happy hours, though and live music in the evenings sometimes, so you might as well check in on reservations before you go.

Verdict: If you're going to Park Street you can try out lots of other places. The place has an old world vintage charm to it, but the food does not really excite you. It's placid, so to speak.

I was there two nights ago. It was not a good experience. The food was ordinary,ambience was poor, the maitre'd was rude, four waiters hanging around talking loudly. This place has deteriorated so much from the sixties when I was there in my younger days.

I would not recommend anybody to go there.

Well trnicas has a very good advantage is its location,its located at the heart of park street.

after entering I felt good and both.The lighting was really nice,but the music was too loud.The staffs were very well trained,polite and helpful.?Unfortunately that say some stingy smell was coming.

The food was average,I ordered garlic chicken dry with some rice.Both were up to the standard,nothing special.But if someone wants to go for a nice dinner with live music they should go a bit early to get a nice place.

Overall it was fine,nice dinning.I would recommend this restaurant.

I have been to Trincas a few times and it's a fun place to hang out with live music and extremely economical selections of food and drinks. However, the last time I was here with a few friends, we were stopped at the door and weren't allowed to enter because we were wearing chappals. We asked to speak with the manager and he came across really rude.

Wait. I'm a Delhite and I've traveled and eaten across the country but never faced such humiliation. As I had pointed out to the manager, my friends who had accompanied me were all current players in the Indian National Football Team and the manager said that he didn't care (to their faces!). The situation was really embarrassing since Trincas is a far from fancy place, yet they dont allow people in Nike and Adidas slippers, when even Park Hotel (where we eventually went) next door allows them. That aside, why cant a person feel comfortable and be himself and grab himself a meal somewhere. Whats wrong with the picture?

The restro instade of being located at the heart of prkst is much affordable . the quality of food and service has nothing to say but really good. the ambience is also good and the place is really specious. i tried tandoori chicken all the times which is really delicious. besides mixed fried rice and mutton rogan jouce is really good. price of beer is also attractive and affordable.
This is a cool place to hang out with friends or families and the pocket pinch will not make you think a lot also.

One of the most famous restro of park area. The booze and food price is quite affordable. Food is really great and staff members are friendly. But this place has really loud live music and so maybe a no no for some, but overall is great and dosent draw cheap crowds.

I love to visit this place on a rainy or busy working day. Get a seat beside the glass window and enjoy the energetic Park Street with the music in festive seasons. Foods are good apart from the deserts nevertheless it has its own fascination to bring you in its scope.

A very nostalgic place me. We(me and my gf) often go there for a change. The ambiance is very good. Foods and drinks may be a little bit costly but the quality is good. Try to go there in festive season as you can get surprises. Try chicken dopiyaza, mutton tava masala, chicken tangri kebab etc. I bet you will definitely have a nice time.

Trincas....a well known landmark at Park Street. The best part of this place is that you can eat and listen to the live performance served here along with your partner.....a treat to remember and cherish...all at Trincas. I can recall that the menu card holds a large number of delicacies to offer and yes, they are all tasty and yummy to eat. Price is all-right and the people inside the restaurant are also good and provides you with necessary know-how on foods. Reserve a table and go there with your loved one....Have A Treat!

We were a group of 4 college girls and we had come here on a saturday afternoon and we were not quite behaved well with. We were given only food menu firstly and when asked for the beverage menu one gentleman very unkindly asked us for our ID cards (which is fine as its a rule but the rudeness was uncalled for) and was given only when we proved our ages and another rudeness was followed when asked for a particular alcohol saying 'but thats very expesive' as if we dont know... Anyway the waiters were well mannered and the food was good as well...

On 28th September I went there to celebrate my birthday.
The Mutton Malai Kabab & Chicken Irani Kabab was great. Ice cream with chocolate sauce was yummy.
The ambiance is too great, nice live music there, thoroughly enjoyed.



On 12/07/2014 went with my 'Fiance'. It was my 2nd visit to Trincas. Classy ambiance, polite waiters , quality food.
Ordered Chicken Lasooni Kebab & Mutton Malai Kebab. Both were succulent in taste. In main course Plain Naan & Chicken tawa Masala. The gravy of of the side dish was excellent to taste. And finally the best of all Vanilla Ice-cream with Hot Chocolate Sauce, yummy.
It is only the Bar at Kolkata, where you would not find a 'Drunker' environment. Must visit to everyone...

A perfect place for family hangouts.If im asked to name the place for perfect moghlai food then it would surely be TRINCAS.The chicken tikka butter masala with butter nan makes a perfect combo.The texure of the meat,masalas and the aroma blends in ones mouth with each bite that one takes.The one thing that i cant do without is the tandoori chicken as a starter.

I was there for a working lunch. The service was courteous and attentive, the ambiance was nice (except a loudmouth at the adjoining table) and the food was excellent. I tried the Crispy Pepper Chicken as starters and was quite satisfied with the overall taste of the dish. The Fried Green Chillies and Ginger added to the flavour. The main course was Prawn Tettrazinni with green chillies. This combination was quite innovative and I tried it for that very reason and it did not disappoint. They have a live band too, but I find the music too loud.

Its one of the old school place in Kolkata. One of the legendary once at Park Street corner adjacent to THE PARK.
The food was very tasty but the only problem that might occur is the extremely loud music whose volume could be a little on the lower side as it acts as a barrier sometimes for the person who is taking order as I was given something else which I did not order but I highly recommend this place as far as the menu is concerned and the taste of the food too.
Its old school with the hint of 21st Century! :)
