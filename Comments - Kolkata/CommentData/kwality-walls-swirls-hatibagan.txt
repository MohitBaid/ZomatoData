This is my third visit at Kwality Swirls. Had opted for the Extra Large Double Chocolate Thunderstorm ice cream, althought there was nothing extra large about it. Kinda expensive I would say. But it tasted quite good. They didn't provide their trademark long red spoon. They had just provided one small white plastic spoon to go with the dessert which was not expected.

Yummy.... Simple, tasty. But they can't serve as the menu. The ice cream was delicious with toppings of chocolate chips and brownie. They served the order very fast.

Have been here for 2 or 3 times, they offer decent desserts i mostly prefer the scoop of 3 layer with choice of topings the dont take the extra charges because it is in a open space i guess.. all the prices they offer are inclusive with the taxes. Once again I will tell, it is not the best but yes it is decent & pocket friendly. Wall's always maintain there quality.

This small ice-cream joint just below the Star Theatre in Hatibagan serves Kwality Wall's Swirl's. This is actually a small ice cream stall at the back-gate of Star Theatre. Thunderstorm from this outlet is an ice-cream lover's delight. üòä

Swirls had been pretty good in their products. But this time I noticed they are selling water bottles more than the marked price. I said them thrice your cannot do that but they were bent on charging extra. I have reserved a copy of the bill and will take it to higher authorities

Hi, this Kwality Walls Swirls Parlor in Hatibagan is really amazing. Service offered by the staff is good. The kids really enjoy the flavors of ice cream available here. It's just beside Star Theatre. Almost in a walking distance from my place. I went with my Sister and we enjoyed the ice creams eaten and the service of the staff members. In the summer, please visit here and enjoy the ice cream in the sun, it really feels so nice. Had an amazing experience here enjoying the ice creams.

This outlet is a small kisok, close to Star Theatre. Paid a visit here recently for a cup of Friut and Nut ice cream. Very good in taste, it was full of Choco Chips and nuts.
Prices are also very reasonable.

The name of Kwality Walls strikes a chord with the Ice Cream even after loitering in my early twenties. When the Swirls is added, I tend to image the reddish centre located at the malls. However, I did not have had much expectations from this outlet which turned out rather nice.

This a small kiosk of Kwality Walls Swirls located just below the Star Theatre beside the ticket counter. Taking into consideration the type of people who usually visits the Theatre, I thought of not having warm welcome which was where my insight went wrong.

Having a walk from College Street to Shyambazar, I along with my friend decided to try it out. It was like any other outlet and the serving was rather quick with a smile on the face of the server. The taste of Dry Fruit as well as Choco Chip was rather fine, better than the outlet at City Centre Rajarhat.

However, the area where it is situated was kind of shabby and the kiosk‚Äôs colour were faded giving it a look as if they are in bankruptcy. A single glance will make many of the foodies to give it a second thought before visiting.

Overall, I kind of liked the ice cream I tasted. Give it a go!

A brand extension of Kwality Walls, this one is a small kiosk located in the Star Theatre building premises serving chilled goodness. The Dry Fruit option is a pure bliss, in this hot summer, as the combination of the Swirl, along with the Fresh Fruits, really strikes the dry palette. Service was quite good.

Located inside the Star Theatre. Very small and cute kinda place to have some wonderful ice creams.
Being having a tummy full of meal minutes ago this was a perfect way to end the things up for the night.
I tried the Choco chip sundae and it was great. Filled with choco and ice cream beneath. Nice one

Located at the premises of Star Theatre, this small kiosk is surely a pure bliss for the dessert lovers and the sweet toothed foodies.

Specially, after a sumptuous meal from restaurants located inside the Star Theatre premise(Wokking, Bhojohori Manna etc.) this place plays a pivotal role of ending the meal with some sweet anecdotes.

Good in taste, and descent in quality, are the frozen desserts served here.

First of all, this is situated at a place where one can detect very easily, adjacent to Star theatre. I had fruit fetish sundae (large) . I loved it. I think the price is worth of what you get. The fruits mixed with vanilla and syrup(don't know the name) tasted so good.

Its the same as all its other outlets. You get a lot of options if you like your ice cream your way. You get to choose you cone, topping, and of course the ice cream. Its a great place to just have your ice cream just after you have finished watching your movie for a quick bite on the go.

This Kwality outlet is a few steps away from my home. A movie at Star Theatre ends with a visit to this outlet most of the time. Though I'm not a dessert person by heart but exceptions can be made for the exceptional.

On moments when I crave for a soft serve of chocolate scoop melting on top of a brownie filled with chocolate sauce topped with dry fruits and choco chips all over it, I visit Kwality Swirl's. Most of the ice creams taste good but unfortunately some have icicles formed in them, which leave a watery taste in your mouth. I'm a fan of their Thunderstorm range topped with mixed and dry fruits. Though I'm yet to try their SUNDAE range but would love to recommend their Cappuccino and Black Current Raisin combination to all. Don't let the Xtra Large size entice you unless you are absolutely sure that you won't have to ask your friends to finish your part at the end.

Just one request to the staff behind the counters, we don't really appreciate and enjoy your taste of loud Bollywood masala music. That's no way a crowd puller. I will visit this place many times in the long run.

Since my childhood days I have weakness for Kwality's ice creams, still now that weakness persists. 2 or 3 weeks ago after our Annual Departmental Get-together lunch at Blossoms, my colleagues were searching for a good place to have desserts and they introduced me to this place. 

Location: Inside Star Theatre campus. Actually a pretty good location to attract customers. 

Staffs are well behaved, prompt in service, maintains the hygiene level. 

I tried their tuti-fruity flavour-  tasted quite good, smooth, presentation was good too. Plenty of flavours available. Reasonably priced.
