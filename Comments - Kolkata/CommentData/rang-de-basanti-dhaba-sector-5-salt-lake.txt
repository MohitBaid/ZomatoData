One of the most popular dhabas in Kolkata..and they serve you really well. It's a well lit place with nice ambience.. serve you with a lot of options in the menu.. do try kebabs for starters and mung dal ka halwa for dessert. And in between you can try their lachha parathas

We went there after the Armin Van Buren concert in Kolkata. The restaurant was not expecting such a rush of customers i guess. The food was almost over. We managed with whatever they had to fill our stomachs. The food was ok though.

Want to taste the essence of North India? This is where you go -
Right from the utensils to the walls, from the menu card to the tables & chairs - everything about the decor of this Punjabi themed restaurant would make you feel in Chandigarh/Delhi, reliving the scenes from "Sholay"!
The food - finger licking good (maybe I love it more since I'm into North Indian cuisine) - offers you all the varieties of Punjabi and North Indian dishes imaginable.Service and hospitality is not bad, could do better.
This place often gets madly crowded during occasions and weekends.
A must visit even if you're not a fan of North Indian platters.

Overall a good experience. The food was really good.
We had Dahi kebabs, rumali roti and kumbh matar. The dahi kebabs were amazing, a must try. The kumbh matar was also cooked well and tasted good.
Even though the restaurant was full, the service was quick and the staff was well behaved.
Definitely worth a revisit..

If you are a Tandoori Chicken fan then you must try the Delhi 6 ka Tandoori Chicken in this restaurant. They serves really good Punjabi food. However, I felt the number of waiters are not enough to serve the crowd as I have to wait for a pretty long time for my order. Also, I instructed one of the waiters to pack the remaining food on the table so that I can give the same to a homeless person but unfortunately one waiter came out of nowhere and took the food in a hurry  :( as a lot of people are waiting to be served.

Had the worst experience on this new year eve...
We are pure vegetarian  and we are against having non vegetarian as its beyond our culture ..
We were having a new year party at a friends place
& We all were very hungry...we ordered for our food which contains nan daal paneer .
After a long wait we got our food and we all were very hungry and sat for our dinner.as we started our dinner we found that the paneer we ordered is tasting very different and after checking we got to know that its a non veg item we dint even knew what it was and when we called at the restaurant they told us we @ordered for chicken .we are pure vegetarian how can we even order them when we never had it in our entire life.
It was the worst experience on such a occassion and our whole party mode was spoiled and the entire group of ours had to go to another restaurant as we dint felt like eating anything from your restaurant after such a bad experience.

Reasonably close to college more, this restaurant is a perfect restaurant when you are on a budget. The quirky Indian decor steals the show. We ordered tandoori roti, kadhai chicken, aloo do piyaza and egg tarka. All the dishes tasted great. The staffs are courteous and the service was fast. A perfect restaurant to spend quality time with your family.

On our second visit, we had cheese and peas polao, mutton roganjosh and chicken bharta. I loved all the dishes.

Tried the Butter Naan and Murgh malai tikka at Rang de basanti dhaba , saltlake, unfortunately I forgot the name of the other chicken dish I had, but each and every dish was lip-smacking And undoubtedly very tasty, and at the end I went for trying the Desi masala chaach and Desi nimbu pani within Beverages, n felt like what's better than a nice masala chaach after a lip-smacking main course in this season. And I should not end without mentioning about the gentle and friendly behaviour I received there, and hence, I had a great experience this Christmas at the Rang de basanti dhaba.

Didn't liked at all. We have ordered 2 chicken, 1 mutton, 1 starter and Tandori roties. Only thing which was as expected was the starter and roties. All the dishes are not at all up to the mark. 

Chicken lababdar: The onion paste was under cooked. Blunt in taste. Under-cooked spices. And it seems like there is no difference between chicken lababdar and chicken tikka masala.

Kadai Chicken: The onion gravy was very under-cooked. And smell of undercooked gravy was irritating.

Mutton rogan josh: Don't know what to say about that. It seems like boiled mutton were just dipped in the gravy. The gravy was tasteless, no flovour of mutton. I cannot call it Mutton rogan josh.

Over all a very bad experience and waste of money. On top of that the Quantity of food was less in compared to price.

Situated bang opposite to the new Bose Institute campus near College More, Rang de Basanti dhaba takes you to the world of a colourful and earthy Highway dhaba. Its immense popularity could be easily understood from the rush inside and outside during lunch time. We got our seats after waiting for a few minutes. The staffs are very helpful as during the rush hour also they answered each of our queries. We ordered Patiala da chicken tikka kebab which was a bit spicy and very soft. Masala papad was a perfect warm up for the main course. Then we took Kolkata chicken biryani, garlic naan, butter naan, dal makhani, dilli ka butter chicken. Despite the rush, their service was very prompt. Biriyani and naan were as usual but the sides were to die for. Both of them are strongly recommended. In desserts, we took gajar ka halwa and gulab jamun. It was just the perfect ending to our satisfying meal. The pricing also didn't hurt our pocket so definitely going to come back here to try their other mouth watering dishes.
Overall experience-
Ambience - 4/5
Food- 4.5/5
Service- 4/5

We ordered chicken malai kebab which was amazing, mutton seekh kebab - not recommended. Keema matter - good, Dilli butter chicken - very tasty but too hot, may be a little less chilli would be perfect. Cheese and peas pulao - don't be excited it's just paneer and peas. I recommend.

It is located near the College More at Salt Lake Sector 5 and is a landmark by itself. We went there recently on a Friday lunch out and had a good time. We had the Tandoori Chicken starter, Raliway Mutton and Chicken Bharta as the main course alongside Hari Mirch ki Roti. The tandoori chicken was good as expected (a dhaba that doesn't make tandoori chicken well doesn't deserve to be called that), the railway mutton was the surprise package as it was really good, but the combination of Chicken Bharta and Hari Mirch paratha was just fabulous. We had a great time eating out. 
The only issue was the delivery time for each of those dishes, I could say that my stomach never faced the trouble of processing them at one go ;P ...

If you can Go on Weekdays then you will encounter less people traffic, and if you are going on weekends be prepare for Crowd as they pour in to this place from every part of the city.

We ordered Tandoori for starters, it was a bit disappointment.¬†
¬†
Must Try is "Methi Chicken"¬†and "Chicken Labadar" in main course along with any Tava recipes or Rice.
Hands on some LASSI.

Located in salt lake sector V among the branch of IT sectors....i Visit the place yesterday with my two mates in offive lunch break....in that time the place was really crowdy so we have to wait and then we decided to sit outside for save time....

We ordered 1 plate og afgani chicken for starter and 3 plates of mutton biriany with a plate of green salad....

Afgani chicken was really very teasty.....and just because this dish i gave 3 review....

Mutton biriany is not good at all....its dry and tough to eat it without any side dish....the mutton pieces of my plates was too hard to eat....quantity is good for 1 but we could'nt finish it just for its dryness....

Price was like the others mughlai hubs of the town....but if you want to visit there try something else apart from biriany....

Whoa a tractor!! Yes a tractor welcomes you into this humble yet spacious joint that is full of fun and frolic. The interior is getting weary now, given that it's the oldest restaurant in Sector 5; but it leaves no room for any adversities, thanks to the courteous and humble staff.

We were comfortably seated while waiting for our starters viz. Dahi Ki Kabab, Afghani Murg, Patiala Da Chicken Tikka and Fish Tikka. Being a hardcore Chicken person, I must admit that I liked Dahi Ki Kabab the most, followed by Afghani Murg and Fish Tikka. The roast was done perfectly, resulting to an excellent smoky aroma and brilliant flavour.

In the main course we had ordered for Butter Naans, Garlic Naans, Dilla Ka Butter Chicken, RDBD Special Chicken Bharta and Dal Makhani. Everyone loved the Garlic Naans and the Butter Chicken. The Bharta was no less either. The Dal Makhani was a pure delight as well.

It was funny how we had overestimated ourselves against the quantity that was served. It was tough for even a group like that of ours to finish all the food. Anyhow we emerged as winners and are now looking out for more with higher expectations.

Had some work around sector 5, so visited this place almost 3-4 times in last 1 month. Honestly, the experinece of every visit was absolutely top-notch.

This place is easy to locate. Just near college more opposite to the Bose Institute. Not even google map is required.

Special appreciation should be given to the staffs for their superfast service. The place is huge enough to accomodate quite large number of people together. So one of the added pros is you never have to wait.

Now coming to the food, we tried
Chicken Bharta (5/5)
Matar Paneer (5/5)
Dal Makhani (5/5)
Tandoori Roti (5/5)
Chicken Biryani (4/5) Quantity should be increased
Chicken Tandoori (5/5)
Chicken Roll (5/5) One of the best rolls I ever had

Lastly, the place is super cheap and absolutely affordable which makes every visit more worth.

.5 less rating for that.
Hope next time I could give more than 5 rating if my concerns get solved but seriously Gosht was 100 out of 10 :) (y)

I am back with another review, extremely sorry no pics this time as I was so damn hungry, I just ate it in matter of few mins.

So what did I have here ?? I had a very simple and yet very close to every Kolkatan's heart.  #ChickenRoll..

Well I will not say it was the best I have but yes, it had its own unique flavours especially the sauce it had in it. I still will not compare it with the ones in park street or at esplanade but yes it filled me up quite well and I loved it sauce...

Full Punjabi Styled Restaurant
Their Tandoori Chicken
Their Kebabs 
Each type of Kebab was so yummy we just can't stop eating
Then their Chicken Bharta was also awesome
Sikanji at the end is also necessary to digest such yummy food

The fact that this restaurant is open till pretty late at night needs a mention, so it is the place that I usually go to when I have those midnight hunger pangs. Absolutely love the Dilli da butter chicken, kheema paratha and Cheese and peas pulao.The dhaba style interiors with quirky posters like "Bhayankar Thanda Cola" and a big yellow truck could cheer anybody up. They give out free dessert coupons on filling up a feedback form and desserts aren't bad either. Everything said, I would have liked it better had the cleanliness been at par with the quality of food served. Agree that it's a dhaba style restaurant and dhabas are not necessarily very clean and tidy, but being one in Sector 5 is probably why this needs a mention.

1630 hours. Nov 8, 2017, Wednesday, Sector V:

So back to the city of Joy. And an opportunity to meet my old friend from Bombay - Raj Dwip Pandey.

Raj is now heading the Ops of RDB Dhaba. And I had the honour of being his guest.

RDBD is the brainchild of Abhimanyu Maheshwari, who founded Zing Restaurants to create an independent brand which would bring the freshness, taste and affordability of a Highway Dhaba within the confines of a city. Thus 'Rang De Basanti Dhaba' was launched in Delhi in 2012. The brand was awarded the 'Most Creative Concept Restaurant' Award '12 at the Indian Restaurant Awards hosted by Franchise India and currently operates six restaurants across 4 cities.

I was also regaled by the chef Siddharth Joardar. ‚ÄúEverything is top end here, everything is sourced daily, everything is cooked fresh. We cook 30 kgs of Dal each day. We design our own Masalas. We purchase 200 litres of milk every morning and 120 litres every evening. We make our own Paneer. Our meat and veggies supplier is premium. We do not have ANY leftovers, so hygiene is automatically guaranteed‚Äù.

CHICKEN RESHMI KEBAB (4.5 /5): Creamy, cheese-y, mildly salted. Tandoor grilled, ginger garlic marinade, white pepper, and cashew almond paste. Well cooked, soft and succulent tikkas crumbling at the slightest bite. Best to be had with green mint chutney.

TAWA WALI MACHHI (4.5 / 5): Ajwaini fish, deep fried fillets. Crunchy and spongy at the same time. Luscious is the word that came to mind.

SHIKAMPURI KEBAB (5/5): Sigh! What a delight! A lamb mince kebab infused with mint and a balance of spices. Binding of Chana dal. So soft and so crumbling as to resonate a Gilaouti Kebab. In fact this has been a trial product, introduced for tasting just today. I strongly recommend immediate inclusion in the regular menu.

CHICKEN BHARTA (5/5): A super hit again. I had in fact asked for Mutton keema but was strongly recommended this. And the suggestion was not off the mark. So this was a dish made of chicken shreds, well cooked in a mildly sweet gravy of cashewnut, egg yolks and yoghurt. The ginger garlic paste and the onion further added elan to it. 

RANG DE COLA (4/5): To wash all the heavies down, we were also offered this special fizzy drink. A cola enriched with roasted Jeera powder, rock salt, lime drops and black pepper. Purrfect.

Whatever I saw, I absolutely liked. The prices are very attractive, and the chef is a magician. The no of items on the menu card is humongous, and the food is prepared super fresh. Why wouldn‚Äôt I want to go there again and again?

Wanted to try good dhaba food since a long time. Finally went to this restaurant for lunch yesterday. We had to wait for about 10 mins to get a table as it was jam packed even with their huge seating arrangement. The restaurant is well lit and clean so I have no complaints regarding their hygiene.
There is no point of eating in a dhaba if you haven't tried their BUTTER CHICKEN and BUTTER NAAN. So I too ordered these dishes along with DAL MAKHANI.
The food reached our tables within 10 mins, so you can understand how fast their service is.
The butter naan was light and fluffy and soft just like it should be. The chicken was succulent and had the smoky barbecue smell and the taste was just superb. The Dal makhani was creamy and was also very delicious. For dessert we had GULAB JAMUN. We were served with two huge hot Golab Jamuns which were soft and fried in pure ghee. The food of this restaurant is just amazing and everything is served hot and fresh. The price is also very reasonable. I loved this place and I'd love to visit again.

When it comes to take a chill in a restaurant without making a big hit on your pocket; I'll put my bet on the dhabas. Rang de basanti offers you the authentic northern cuisines in a feasible suitings. I went there during my office break. My order was 'Palak Paneer' and 'Tandoori Roti'. A fabulous combination comes with my personal recommendation. Palak was smoothly caramelized and the soupy creamy textures was really admirable. Paneer was soft & mushy, roti was also a fair call. So the dhaba got my mood fair and square and I had a tummy-full lunch üòã. You should make your way out to this if northern delicacies won't make you resist. Peace out ;)

Located near College more Rang De Basanti Dhaba remains crowded most of the time. I have been there twice, previously for lunch and recently for a quick bite.
This restaurant is nicely decorated and has lots of space. It gives a proper dhaba kind of feeling. Food here is pretty good, nothing exceptional though. I had liked their Butter Chicken specially. Quantity is also satisfactory. Their service is also quick. Their rolls are another attraction.

Quite a decent place to dine out with friends or family. Ordered Butter chicken (boneless), Special chicken bharta, Dal makhani and butter smeared tandoori rotis. The butter chicken deserves special mention. It was finger licking good. Bharta and Dal makhani were okayish. Could have been better.

I had ordered food through Swiggy .
Jamindari Alu( similar to Dum Alu)and Chapati .
It was pathetic to say the least. The delivery was before time but the food was not at all worth .
I thought we would get some good Punjabi food in the East similar to Mumbai but it turned out to be a disaster.

This place serves excellent North Indian food, and that's coming from someone who's not a fan of North Indian cuisine. Visited this place on a Wednesday afternoon,  to beat the mid week blues. We ordered Tawa wali machhi,  tandoori chicken and Dahi wale kebab. The non vegetarian items were excellent, tandoori chicken was one of the best I've had. The vegetarian kebabs were pretty interesting,  had a gooey curd based center,  with a thin fried exterior. For main course we had naan and Dilli wale butter chicken, which perfectly complemented each other. The lassi we ordered, should have been frothier,  and was a tad too sweet. Looking forward to frequenting this place.

Hence a nice place to satisfy the appetite for mughlai food. Try it :)

Poor. The food is really not up to the mark.I don't know why people suggest this place. Food quality is not worthy of price. Neither you will like it. I ordered chapatis and they gave chapatis which were cooked long time back by just applying hot butter. If u order paneer ( people recommend for veg; although non-veg is also poor) they would give you large chunks of it and which has a rubber texture ( feels like synthetic paneer).went a couple of times. Worst experience both the times..

Rang De Basanti Dhaba opened at College more, Sector 5 since I was in second year of my college and due to our daily commute me and my friends have been here innumerable times especially for their lipsmacking egg and chicken rolls. They can never disappoint the foodie in you. Also I have had the dining experience here for a couple of times as well. This one is way more spacious and has fast service compared to their Diamond Plaza outlet.

P.S. Their malai lassi is a MUST.

Not much to comment on the decor, tolal dhaba ambiance. Don't expect to have a private quite dinner. Service was good, though the puja rush was too much.
Coming to the food, we loved the dishes. We took Delhi 6 tandoori chicken , murgh Malai kebab & Reshmi kebab. The tandoori chicken and cheesy murgi Malai were just love! In the main course , we took mutton biryani, butter nun, mutton rarra and chicken butter masala. The biriyani was good but not great (had two mutton pieces), but the mutton and chicken dishes were heavenly. The nuns were very soft. Lime sodas were there to accompany the dishes.
Yes will come back here and definitely recommendable for young & happening crowd

This wasn't the first visit and we visit this place quite often taking advantage of the close proximities. Good punjabi food with quite a variety. Both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Interesting decor with funny posters and folk and spoon chandeliers and a big tractor. Their yellow and black theme is quite attractive. Food is good, has punjabi flavour and not extremely spicy. You can ask to make it less spicy while ordering. I love their kebabs, special dishes and garlic naan. Service is good, staff is friendly, this is a place for everybody. They have two outlets in Kolkata, the one in Salt lake is open till late hours and home delivery and take away is available too.

Ordered in, can't comment on the decor.
We got chicken biriyani, mutton biryani, butter naan, butter chicken and paneer butter masala. Got a Pepsi for free.

Quantities are very good. Hard to finish a full plate unless you're really hungry, which we were.
The biriyanis were pretty tasty, different from the Arsalan and Aminia ones. The mutton pieces could've been bigger though. But very well-cooked.

The Dilli ka Butter Chicken was exceptionally well-prepared. It was flawless. All ingredients in the right amounts.
I wanna go there in person soon.

Recommended.

Located amongst the IT hub of Kolkata, the best restaurant to try out Punjabi Khana.¬†
Food is excellent. Specially their kebabs, the malai kebab tops my fav list. The way they serve the food, the utensils and the interior reflects the authenticity of Punjab. So highly recommended restaurant to go along with friends or family.

A place situated in sec 5, near college more, usually empty during lunch hours, but at night, this is the place u want to visit. This restaurant remains open until 2:00 am so if u r a person who need food at midnight, this is your destination. Great cuisine, menu is very good. Interiors is quite OK, u can also eat outside, they have a seating arrangement outside too... food tastes good. Deducting points coz the price is quite high as compared to the food quantity.

Had a sudden Saturday night drive with family and stopped at this one , parked and walked in. Ordered fish kabab, reshmi kabab as starter. Ordered some tawa roti with palak paneer and mix veg along. The starters tasted fine , mix veg was fine for me too, palak paneer was good for me but mom didn't liked it much taste differs. They could make the chairs and tables a little better. Maybe it's a no nonsense eat it stuff dhaba type as the name suggests.

I went there for take away food last Friday at around 1am from Office as we came to know it was birthday of one of our colleague in shift. Accentuated by the fact that it was Friday we were desperate to celebrate and the only option which came to our mind was this restaurant which remains open till pretty late.

The restaurant will greet you with a large tractor which is placed just by the door to add to the Dhaba feeling. The decor is that of a sophisticated dhaba with funky one liners hanging from the wall.

We saw many customers not even getting down from their respective cars and having food in their car by parking the car in front of the restaurant. The staffs are taking orders and serving there only.

The staffs were suggestive and courteous.

We just ordered starters -
Achari Mushroom Tikka - This was awesome in taste
Sabz Seekh Kebab
Chicken Hariyali Tikka - Among non-veg kebabs this was the best with taste of coriander and mint.
Seekh Taka Tak
Murgh Reshmi Tikka

Simply awesome!
We had visited during lunch hours. Dhaba was not crowded that much on Saturday. But when we were leaving, there were people waiting for seats.
It's a feel like dhaba food in city. We had ordered non veg item- biryani, chicken chili , paneer, butter naan and some other items. Taste wise..it's very good and affordable restaurant dhaba. Cost for 2 People- Avg. 1000 rs.
Ambiance wise, medium.
No drinks allowed except cold/soft drinks.

I went to RDBD for the first time at 2 am for dinner and i didn't feel tired the entire night!!
The location of this restaurant is brilliant and so is the food. When it comes to North Indian Food, THIS is the place to be. I've visited this place innumerable times and have left more satisfied.
The interior is great and so are the utensils in which the food is served.
I've recommended all my friends and acquaintances to try and visit this place at least once. The service is quick and the people are very polite.
One should definitely try the Lasooni Murgh Tikka and Amritsari Macchi. Then the Chicken Bharta and Keema Mattar. Vegetarians can try Paneer Butter Masala and Dal Butter Tadka.
Try out any bread you want, you'll like all of them!!
Cheers!!!

I had been to this restaurant today. Had ordered chicken tandoori which was okay. Had ordered for kadhai chicken and keema kaleji which were horrible. There were four pieces which were too small. Overall the experience was not good and when we complained about it to the manager he offered us a discount of small amount and assured us of good preparation the next time we visit them.

Its a OK OK restaurant....the ambience is like a modern air conditioned punjabi style dhaba..we ordered chicken and mutton biryani but i would give it 2/5.butter naan and rumali roti was good.and best was the butter chicken it was really good and tasty...and lastly the green salad and lassi is not the value for the money...one thing which really needs to be improve is the air conditioning system,thought the ac was on but it was too hot inside especially when u r eating indian typical foods!!!!

A regular over here since the last 1 year, this place had been my savior during the late night weekends. I have a standard order with minimal changes whenever I come here. It consists of Chicken bharta along with dal tadka and some naan or rice respectively. Their food tends to be spicy at times, but the overall hospitality that you receive at that point of midnight tends to overpower every other aspect. Will keep coming for more.

Dhabas are my favorites and EDBD is no exception! The not-so OTT ambience gives you the "dhaba" feel! What you may try is the reshmi chichen or chicken lasuni tikka, haryali kebab, butter chicken, chicken bharta, kadhai paneer, malai kofta and garlic naan in bread! The service is fast enough and the staff service is satisfactory too! 
Note: plz get back gulkand ice cream in ur menu!!

RDBD as is popularly called, is located beside IBM at Sector 5. This is one of the urban dhabas which serves you in a jiffy and is open till late night.

Started with a cooler, the Nimbu Pudina Sharbat is a must try. It soothes you from the heat of IT hub - Sector 5.

Ordered the Afghani Murgh for starters, the chicken was juicy and tender.

For main course we ordered the Kolkata Chicken Biryani, Chicken Lababdar, Chicken Kadai and Butter Tandoori Roti.
The Biriyani was quite good, and so was the Chicken Kadai but Chicken Lababdar which is recommended by them wasn't very extraordinary and tasted bland.

The ambience is quirky and walls are adorned will movie posters and dialogues of the 80's, there's also a tractor inside the dhaba.

The service is quick and the staff members are friendly.

Also, the takeaway rolls they serve are delicious.

Food - 4/5
Ambience - 4/5

Ordered kulcha and chicken patiyala tikka masala.  Food was okay, price was moderate. Waiters had to be called (rather shouted at),to get attention, which was not nice. Overall decent place.

It is one of the best tandoori chicken kabab I have tried in Kolkata . We also ordered garlic nan (not so good) , butter nan , Butter Chicken (good) chicken bharta (was ok in taste) . That day they only had fresh lime soda for drinks which was also not cold enough . Overall experience food taste was good . But ambience and staff behavior was not that good .

I went to this place last month.. You will feel an authentic dhaba style flavours in the food. We had soda sikanji, Kolkata chicken biriyani, masala kulcha, dilli ka butter chicken, kesari phirni. One half plate of butter chicken is more than enough for two and really delicious. The biriyani was so so. There was nothing extra ordinary in it . The masala kulcha was the best of all. It was too yummy. The phirni had that authentic taste and it really completed the entire meal... The overall experience to this place was really nice and of course it was pocket friendly. Dilli ka butter chicken is highly recommended

Been here mostly on team lunches and it's one of the good places in Sector 5 where you get value for your money. Their biryani and kebabs are delicious. So are their rolls. Another plus point for this outlet - their service is superbly fast considering the prime location and the number of footfalls in a day.. kudos for that. The staff is friendly and helpful. This place is always full and it becomes difficult to snag a table sometimes. Overall, a good go-to place for lunches..

Ambiance- very crowded and hence hot . Air conditioning is not enough to make up for that amount of crowd. 
Service- staff is really polite and respectful. But the water they served was warm. When asked for cold regular water,they said it isn't available.
Food- amazing. Items we ordered and likings - 
Paneer makhani - 5/5
Tandoori roti-4/5
Chicken chatpata- 2/5
Biryani Chicken and mutton- 3/5
Chicken lababdar- 4/5
Jeera rice- 4/5

This place is hugely popular among families and the sector 5 crowd. For 7 people the bill came at 1800 , Which is a decent amount. Next time ,I will prefer take out food from here rather than a seating.

Visited Rang De Basanti on Saturday for a team lunch. Waited for 30 mins and then got the table.
We ordered: Dilli ka butter chicken, garlic nun, butter nun, punjabi kari pakora, dal makhani.
Now coming to food quality
Dilli ka butter chicken- Taste good but not sufficient enough. Quality too low as compared to price.
Garlic nun- was so so
Butter nun- Got totally burned and just a bit pinch of butter on it
punjabi kari pakora- worst
dal makhani- It not better than the road side tarka.

If you take regular water then they will simply provide tap water, not filter.
The serve is low. Ask for finger bowl and it arrived after 20 mins. No proper response from the waiter.
Would never visit again. Price is toooooooo high.

Other specialities of the restaurant like Dilli ki butter chicken and murgh Patiala is average. Staffs are polite. Service is good. Main concern is hygiene! You could find multiple house flies around your table. Water is dropping from ac vent. Interior decoration is also average.

For the main course we ordered tandoori butter roti chicken lababdar and Dilli ka butter chicken boneless. For the drinks we had pudina nimbu sharbat and masala shikanji. The food was good Specially the chicken was extremely soft and tender. The rotis are very light and well prepared. Service is very fast and efficient considering we went during peak dinner time on a weekend. On a scale of 5 I would give it a 4. Worth a second visit or even more!

Authentic Punjabi dishes with the ambience and setting can take you back to Delhi. Chicken kalimirch to go with keema kulcha is a must try option. Despite unavailability of all deserts, the Shahi Tukda which is almost always available beautifully wraps up your meal. Service is satisfactory. Sides may be a little pricey.

The Interior view of the Restaurant is Very good and you will love the environment.
But talking about food and service, then definitely it is not up to the mark. I visited there in afternoon and we ordered food, we didn't even got cold water as it was unavailable. Later we used ice cubes to cope up. This is something which I didn't loved. The taste was good but not delicious !

Located near IBM in sector 5 it is a great place to hang out which is pocket friendly .We ordered butter naam,plain naan ,paneer kulcha,tandoori roti,chatpata chicken ,chicken kasa ,chole,butter chicken and coke.kulcha was awesome.BUTTER NAAN is a must have dish ,it is just awesome.All of the chicken was properly cooked,but the taste diff between kadhai chicken and chicken chatpata was very less.One thing that is bad is that the service is very slow.We had to wait for a long time for the food to arrive.But the wait was worth it :)

First of all I have to say about the atmosphere, typical Punjabi feeling is there. Ambience is good, food is delicious, decoration is fantastic, service is also good. I really liked the quotes like "Keep calm and have Naan"
Yes, one thing I will like to point out that the quantity of Biryani was quite less compared to others though taste was great.

The location was awsum and so was the decor.The restuarant was successful in bringing the ambience of a Punjabi village mixed with Sholay characters.We had ordered 
Sabz seekh kabab,reshmi kabab,dhaba chicken curry,tandoori roti,alu gobi,kadhi ,rice
Favourable factors:-
1. Nice ambience
2.A wide range of menu apt for both veg and non- veg people.
3.Friendly staff and prompt service.
4.yummy kababs. And nice alu gobi

Unfavorable factors:-
1. Not too options in rice platter
2.Tandoori roti could have been better

Definitely recommend for a visit.

Decided to give this place a visit on a very rainy night.
Inspite of being really close to my place, this was the first time I visited it.
The place was really cozy and gave off the dhaba kind of vibe.
The tractor was a reappy catch for me and I loved it.
Coming to the food, we ordered roomali rooti and butter naan with rdbd special chicken bharta and a mutton biriyani.
The indian breads were good, nice and soft.
Coming to the bharta, the taste was bland and lacked flavour, but they gave a good quantity of it as compared to the price. 
The biriyani was less in quantity compared to their competitors who provide much more at the same price but the taste was good. They give a plate of complimentary onions. 
The price is average and so it is pocket friendly.
Will I visit again- Probably.

Amidst the corporate sector, all you need is a dhaba. Dhaba for me, means, dal ta·∏çka and roti.. and trust me.. it never disappoints. That's the good thing about them. They aren't like the fancy cafes, they are simple yet comforting. And and and pocket friendly too.. when everything fails. Don't forget to drop at this dhaba and grab a bite. Happy tummy, happy you. üòÉ

One of the worthless food joint I have visited though very popular in the nearby vicinity.
They dont tell the client in this heat that the cold drink is not cold.... HAHA! when objected they agree to take the return of the masala coke which was not cold but cooly add it in the bill.... what more... tissues are not provided .... food is extremely spicy.... we tried our hands on Chicken Labaddar but unfortunately could not eat it ...because of the high amount of spice. Lababdar is known for its mild taste..... They dont provide onions also.... the only thing i liked about this restuarant is THEY HAVE A TYRE WHICH SAYS "BHAYANKAR"..... ABSOLUTE TRUE TO ITS WORDS....

ADVICE: STRICT NO.... WASTAGE OF MONEY

The food was good but a little on the spicy side.
Which cholle were awesome but spicy. Chicken butter masala was spot on and the tandoori chapati was soft and yummy.
Even the lemonade made a good impression.
All in all a good food joint to grab a quick dinner

Titbit time!

Well as everything in pocket was small - time & money - so it's titbit time for us. And that cause a rendezvous with office colleagues.

Though it's titbit for them and I was holding the band here so we ordered quick for aloo kulcha, paneer kulcha (I never had kulcha before, however, I found it big enormous in taste and size than parathas) and patiyala de chicken tikka.

We immaculately enjoyed the taste of dhaba in each and every dishes we ordered. Wanna taste more from theirs' menu.
And the price of titbit was 597/- for 4. So ain't it delightful? Go for it guys. You may love it.

Next we opted for murgh malai tikka for starters.. I'd give it a 5.. yes it was that good.. Next we opted for the garlic butter nan with chicken reshmi kabab in butter masala and and amritsari macchi.. Food is just splendid.. Ambience is authentically Punjabi..

Not a good option for vegetarians. Starter tandoori aloo and chaas were the only things that were good, rest of the lunch we ordered were below average, taste wise. However, service was fast but the waiters were like wanting to throw you away ASAP. Dint even let us choose our dishes peacefully, we were just hurried away. Won't consider visiting this place again.

Been here for lunch,  I had a tight schedule and they made me wait for about an hour for just Bhatinda k kofte and tandoori roti, when I complained they said that they have started a new menu that's why its taking so long. I don't know if it was just for that particular day or what, but they really need to improve their service.

As I mentioned I had Bhatinda k kofte which was listed on their special item, and it really tasted good, but quantity, very less, just two Koftas for Rs 215, I mean guys you need to at least provide quantity enough for two people.
No complaints for the taste though, it was delicious. 

Maybe if they would have named it Kolkata k kofta instead of Bhatinda k kofte, it would have served earlier, probably they were getting it from Bhatinda to serve on my table.

The location of the restaurant is good with all the major offices of sector V nearby. Ordered Lassi, lime soda, veg shammi kabab, chicken seekh kabab, butter chicken and naan. The starterd we're delicious but the quantity served was very less for the price. The quantity of the drinks were also small and Lassi didn't have the signature dhaba taste. Butter chicken was good but the naan was rubbery after 5 minutes. Basically it's a fancy restaurant which tried too hard to become a dhaba. Interior is good though. Overall an average experience.

Been a regular eating joint for quite some time. From the tractor to the quirky posters/frames it's all dhaba style and fun. 
The food is consistently good with the exceptional items being paneer tikka in butter masala gravy, Mitch ki roti and chicken boneless (forgot dish name).
Gets pretty crowded with most corporates hogging this place for the scrumptious food.

They also do pretty good combos during lunch hours for delivery.

I tried this outlet of theirs for the first time.
It was rush hour so they offerd us a single sitter table by adding an extra chair. However the table was very small and the plates were getting messy so we asked the manager if we could shift to a bigger table.
He said as its rush our and they would have problem if a four member group arrives denying us from shifting.
Soon after we saw them giving away the four sitter table to a two member group.
This was really bad from the side of management.
This is the reason of me giving 3.5 instead of 4.5/5
Anyway coming to food, we had butter chicken and butter naan.
The butter chicken was a bit spicy but tasted good and the naans were also soft and had a good amount of butter on it.
Pocket pinch is also moderate.

Good spacious place. Lighting concept felt great. Amritsari chole was great, a good try if you like spice. Chiken preparations are average. Major thing I felt was staff being unprofessional. We were six and the put up only 4 glasses for water and did not bring remaining until I shouted. Further cutlery was put on the table after we had finished eating. To add to the misery was late billing and when billed, two of the hightest priced items were marked twice! After finishing lunch it became another project to make them understand things! Need alot of improvement!

I chanced upon this place on a recommendation while visiting Kolkata. First the decor - its rustic, vibrant and full of props that are truly Punjabi and many if not most Bongs will not know the grassroot link to Punjab except the tractor. Seating is basic but very tematic. Now the food (I am veggie so will comment on the same). Superb dahi kababs, very nice paneer tikka. Panner is what it is like in Punjab and not the version most city people know of. Yellow dal - this is a tricky one. I loved it. Too few restaurants/dhabas serve moong dal. If you are okay with experimenting do go for it. Naans were nice. Kulfi was great though phalooda was below my expectation after such great food. The rose syrup was overwhelmingly sweet and too much in quantity. Phaloodas were not silky and cut too short. Overall brilliant experience. Highly recommended.

This place is located quite close to my office. On my last visit I could only manage a glance inside the dining area which has a nice quirky decor, since I had opted for a take-away parcel. So keeping in mind the colorful desi themed interiors, I am sure to come back to dine at this place. On this visit, I had opted for Kolkata Mutton Biriyani and Kolkata Chicken Biriyani along with some fresh lime soda. I often find chicken pieces to be too hard, dry or chewy in Chicken biriyanis, but here the chicken piece was juicy and soul satisfying. The mutton piece was also insanely soft in that mutton biriyani. The sweet potato in there was rightly cooked and spiced. The rice was well fragrant and the aroma was overall amazing. The quantity was perfect I guess, but for someone with big appetite this might just fall short. 
I will surely recommend both these variants of Kolkata biriyani! The service was prompt and staffs were courteous. As already mentioned, the prices are reasonable, won‚Äôt really burn a hole in your pocket. I will surely come back to this place to taste their other delicacies and of course that glass of lassi, the drink which if not taken leaves your dining experience incomplete at any dhaba.¬†

Cheers!

Excellent place to have proper punjabi cuisine with the feel of a dhaba as well. Focusing on the food, it's actually excellently prepared. I specially love the combination of the Kolkata biriyani and the Mutton rogan josh. Aside that, the tikka butter masala and the mutton rarra are also very sumptuous to name a few. Having my office in the locality, I have recently shifted to visiting this place from other similar restaurants in the are, simply because of the quality of the food they serve. only thing unimpressive about the place is the time they take to serve, whoa.... that's quite more than my own liking

A brilliant place to hangout with friends and family. Nice ambience and decor, quick service, economical and the food is simply awesome.
The location is extremely convenient, as it is situated at the heart of sector five in Salt Lake and accessibility is not a big issue. 
Also their home delivery is a big turn on.

For the starters, the Murgh Malai Tikka and Chicken Reshmi Kebab are my all time favorites and for the main course, do not hesitate to order butter Naan or Lachcha Paratha with either Chicken Bharta or the rich, savory and creamy Dilli Ka Butter Chicken.
The Biryani is not disappointing as well- Simple, less spicy and homely with an impressive taste. :)

Been there yesterday,we ordered butter nan,tandoori chicken,daal makhani and egg bhurji.
Tandoori chicken was good. But daal makhani was pathetic,it was horrible,it tasted like a bowl of boiled lentil with no flavour on it.egg bhurji was good but highly priced.

A very easy to locate place situated in sector 5. The decor is catchy but I felt it could have been a little more neat and clean. Coming to food, we ordered dilli ka butter chicken, rarra gosht and garlic nan. We asked the waiter for a non spicey mutton dish and he suggested rarra gosht. But it was spicey as hell. Also I haven't ever tasted butter chicken that spicey. The food was definitely very delicious but I personally felt they should make it a little less spicey unless told otherwise. Quantity was enough for four people. If you aren't a spicey and tangy food lover, this place isn't for you. Also I would like to mention that the place felt little warm and hot.

So this is one of the best NorthIndian yum food serving place in town,undoubtedly!
I've been to this place twice now.

Easy location from the college more bus stop. Covers a large area,and easy to find. It is a great place to stop by with family or bigger groups in general for a fulfilling meal.

The place is large,with lots of big tables and chairs arranged in bigger clumps of 4-10 people a group to be seated with convenience.

Service is fast enough,we received our orders within 10 mins.

The best part about this place is it's Indian style eating of food. No fancy arrangements,it's served in big dishes or handis and big silver plates. Typical dhaba style. You don't particularly need to use spoon and fork fashionably but go rustic instead!
 

Of the things we ordered:

Chicken Bharta and Chicken butter masala make you actually chew into your fingers too. Creamy and rich. Delicious cooking. Take my word. 

The Naans are large in size and heavily coated with butter. And when I say large really large. We couldn't finish 2 properly each,was quite big.

Tikkas and reshmi kebabs for starters were a little dry for my taste. 4 big's per plate. (What we had) served with a little tossing of salad on the side, and a green yoghurt sauce. Pretty nice overall.

Nimboo pani's on the side was a good refreshment to cut down through the richness of the items.

Must try! You'll keep visiting again and again,promise!

Visited this place last weekend. üòä
Situated near College more bus stop at sector 5...very easty to locate. üëç
The interior decoration is really impressive..A big tractor at the entrance, wooden chair tables..gaint posters on wall.. beautiful hanging lamps...üëå

We ordered Tandoori Pomfert and Patiyala da Chicken tikka for starters..Chicken Bharta and Nan for main course,and Nimboo Pani. ü§ó

The pomfret was served first..with two decent size of pomfret,cooked well..spicy masala coated all over the fish..üòç It was a good start for our dinner.üëç

Patiyala da chicken tikla was yet another flavourful and lipsmacking item..üòä Served with green chutney, amount was good for two people. üòá

Next comes the chicken bharta...üòç with lots of Shredded chicken and egg..served piping hot..,it had a creamy gravy which is just blissful..ü§ó

And now comes the desert time...we asked them for suggestions and they told us to have that gulbjamun with ice cream.. I was a bit confused..thinking how can those two work together......ü§îü§î
And then our dessert was served...a hot gulab jamun at the bottom and vanilla ice cream on top.
And wow..they really just give a blast in ur mouth..with the hot gulab jamun and super cold ice cream...,üòç

So overall a great experience... Surely visit many more times.

Had ordered laccha paratha, butter chicken, mutton rare and murgh malai.. The delivery was very late, they did not take down my contact number correctly.. The food was very average. The murgh malai was hard, parathas were like rubber sole, mutton rare was just okayish and butter chicken was good. This was my first order. Don't think will repeat it.

A dhaba is mainly common in National highway but Rang De Basanti delivers the Dhaba experience in the corporate location of the city. This one is near to College More of Sec V Salt Lake. 

Decorations : They have tried their best to give a dhaba feeling to the ambience but somehow they have failed. Lots of sittings are there & it feels basic. Tracktor, tier hanging on wall & hanging lights makes the difference but nothing too impressive.

Staffs & Management : Staffs & their services are bit slow. Tables are not well managed by them. Our order took quite a while even when the restaurant was empty. Again nothing too impressive.

Foods : Their special items are listed over in the menu card with an icon of tracktor in front. We ordered our foods from that particular listed items.

Murgh Malai Tikka : 6 pieces of boneless chicken coted with a layer of cheese on it. Provided chatney with it was pathetic. Kebabs were well cooked but taste wise it felt quite average.

Cheese and Peas Pulao : This Pulao was served in a small handi & quantity seemed average. The rice quality was very basic & it also tasted very basic. Unfortunately there was no smell of cheese as it is named but ample amount of peas & paneer pieces were found.

Dilli 6 ka Tandoori Chicken in Butter Masala : The name of this dish may be very big & impressive but in reality the dish wasn't that great. 2 big tandoori chicken pieces served in a handi with full of gravy. Gravy was very rich & full of spices. Other than that a lot of burned onion pieces were found. Chicken pieces didn't felt very good & could have been better in many ways. Buttery taste was completely missing.

Pricing : Bill for all the above mentioned items were Rs. 729 in total including of Vat & service tax. Pricing felt kind of average to little bit higher for some dishes.

Conclusion : Its not about the taste & quantity everytime, its about something that I felt a day after in washroom. Well nothing to explain over here, their foods didn't suited me well. Not recommend from my side.

Yes a 4 rating restaurant. Its too rare to find a good Punjabi restaurant at such a far off city.  The taste of North India, completely immersed in Ghee, paneer freshly cooked, chaach that you will savour throughout the meal. Rate is nominal and is completely defines value for money. The only thing that misses here is the punjabi feel which is though rare here but it can be worked out.

Hi Everyone 
So let's write some review about this restaurant. I ordered two times today 
1st lunch - Butter Chicken with Naan and Tandoori Rotis which was amazing and finger licking good. Hats off to one who made food.
2nd Dinner - I was about to order yellow dal fry but below dal was another Punjabi dal tadka which was presented in menu card as chef's speciality so I chose Punjabi dal tadka and Naans and Gulag Jamun as dessert. 
But my dinner was pathetic. I don't see any specialty in this dal, just No Taste and just lil warm as it was made before and they reheated in microwave and forwarded it to me,, so I had to order dal again from hotel where i am staying. 
I don't know about what shall I recommend but chicken was thumbs up but Punjabi Dal Tadka ewwwww..

The one thing I totally loved is the malai kebabs... it's a must... a bit overpriced though.. but you can check it out for this awesome kebab is absolutely worth it.... furthermore keema kulcha is also worth trying... I am not so much a fan of shredded chicken hence not in favour of the bharta.. but kulcha and malai kebabs did justice.

This place is to go to for your north Indian cravings in sec5, interior's are good, loved the tractor kept at the entrance and the gaint bhayankar logo. Service was prompt, tried 'Dadi maa ka achari paneer tikka which was panner tikka cooked in achar, tasted well, but quantity was less. Masala kulcha and garlic naan was perfect, panner butter masala is recommended here. For desert's tried kesaria firni which was also great.

My only complain is they don't serve onions with north Indian, common man, its like a pizza joint refusing to serve oregano and chilli flakes, its that basic, though available for 70 bucks+ taxes but this is not how it should be, though I was served another portion of salad that was served with panner tikka, but would highly recommend the outlet to start serving fresh onions atleast with north Indian orders, everyone does.

Came here for a Bday treat of a friend and sadly just because that friend is a vegan we had to eat veg.
The service is quiet fast but as this is a dhaba dont expect the waiters to be very courteous.
Starters are quiet amazing .... Yeah even the veg ones 
Achari paneer tikka - Soft paneer in tasty masala
Hara bhara kebab - this is the kebab i quiet liked though i have no idea what it was made of 
Stuffed mushroom tikka - mushrooms was good and so was the stuffing 
Bhutte ke seekh - this was also quiet good.
Coming to the main course - 
Dal makhani - Just as good as it can be 
Paneer makhani - delicious 
Kadhai paneer - my personal favourite 
Butter naan - soft and buttery 
Jeera rice - Comfort food 
And a special mention to the lassi ...... Which was extremely delicious but i found it a bit expensive

Last week I was out with my friends and it was late at night so we decided to head to Rang De Basanti for dinner as it is well known for being open till late night.The decor was good and it was more of a mixture of a restaurant and a dhaba,coming to the food we ordered the Tandoori Chicken for starters and for the main course we took Butter Naan and Chicken Bharta.The food took quite a long time to come approx 20 minutes but the food was good the tandoori chicken was tasty,the butter naan was soft and fluffy but the best part was the chicken bharta which was the tastiest.The only drawback was the service because our server seemed to be irritated whenever we requested anything maybe it was because he was tired after working all day long,anyways the food was good and will be visiting again soon.

I often travel within India, city to city due to my work and today happen to visit this restaurant as the smell from outside was tempting. I was with my boss, I ordered Mutton Biryani ¬†for myself and Veg Biryani for my boss. Well the taste of the food was really delicious but quantity was very poor, only 2 piece of mutton and inside the bowl it had a big potato which makes it look like the quantity is enough for one, once order I was expecting a rita (curd) or gravy to come along but it dint and in order to get one we have to additional which was surprise to me as most of the restaurant does provide rita or gravy along with biryani. We also order Mushroom Cheese Kabab which was totally waste of ordering, to simplify it was worthless ordering. ¬†I giving 2.5 as rating cause the taste was good.

The Dahi kebab was nice although it had a bit too much of the Dahi I could just taste yogurt and nothing else. The dal makhni was great although the rotis were pretty alright. The fresh lime soda a complete disappointment. It was more like a sugar syrup than a drink. All in all and okayish experience.

Situated at a good location near college more in sector v, this dhaba styled restaurant has very good thematic ambiance. You are welcomed by a big tractor when u enter the restaurant. The food is quite good, visited after hearing good feedback from collegues and friends. Order chicken bharta, tandoori and biriyani with lime soda. Liked all of the items and would definitely come back to try out their other dishes.

A typical Punjabi styled dhaba, easy to locate, just a two-minute walk from the college more bus stop at Sector V, Salt Lake and a couple of blocks from the Millennium city campus. Visited for lunch on a Thursday afternoon. The place was utterly crowded and the staff almost running to and fro, busy attending to customers. Few seconds of looking around, struggling to find a table for two, I comfortably settled on an empty six seater spotting it on my own since the RDBD folks were too busy to find one for me. Fortunately, after a few minutes they managed to shift us to the table next to us once I was joined by my colleague.

The ambiance was lively with latest Bollywood numbers playing in the background, perfect lighting, a spacious layout with dhaba style tables and benches with the walls lit up with a wacky decor.

Food was served without much delay. We came here specifically for the "Dilli ka Butter Chicken" and boy! It certainly did strike a chord! The dish had chunks of succulent tandoored chicken in a buttery and creamy tomato based gravy. With its rich flavor from different spices, in the exact correct proportions‚Äã made it absolutely finger-licking GOOD üíØ. And without any spec of doubt, I would enunciate, this IS the best I have had in Kolkata till dateüëåüëå. As for breads, a tandoori roti or nan would be a great choice to pair up with the chicken. Not to mention, the firni at the end was delightful as well.

The staff were cordial however, the service was tardy during the rush hour and could be a bit more attentive. The bill payment was done via PAYTM wallet which I found very convenient.

So, out came a happy customer with the taste of that butter chicken still lingering on the taste buds...!!! üòªüòª

Went to RDB around 9:00 o clock in weekdays,the crowd was good,love the environment with full of 90's ad posters .Ordered chicken reshmi kabab ,6 pcs ,really tasty,the chicken was very tender,very juicy,really liked the kabab.Nxt ordered kolkata style briyani,not too rich,very shuttle test,enough quantity,the chicken was very tender and juicy but the rice was bit dry,the moistness was missing.Otherwise my overall experience was good.Bit disappointed to pay Rs 55 for a 300ml pepsi (without tax).

A Dhaba never goes out of business...at least in India!
Its decor is bright and colourful. Being situated at the middle of an IT hub definitely benefitted this place. We reached quite early on a weekday and as predicted the place was nearly full. We ordered Keema mattar, Laccha parantha, Dilli ka butter chicken, Chicken biryani, Kadai Paneer, and Lassi. The food was decent. Don't know whether it was a bad day for the server or whether he is usually that cranky but he rudely refused when I asked him to give me lassi without ice. Not a happy thing to remember.

Rang De Basanti Dhaba is situated at a very convenient location at College More, Sector V.¬† It is a nice place to eat for the sector V office goers.¬† We had a team lunch at this place a few days back.
The decor and the ambience was nice.
Food was delicious. We had the following:
1. Rang De Cola- it was not that nice. An overpowering taste of ginger ruined the punch of the cola.
2. As a starter, we had chicken malai tikka- Awesome starter.
3. Garlic Naan, Butter Naan - good, soft and tasty.
4. Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala- soft pieces of chicken cooked in a nice and thick gravy. Tasty.
5. Delhi ka Butter chicken Full - We were told that this dish would have 10 pcs of chicken. But we were disappoint to see only 5-6 pcs of chicken and those too be very thin and small. It was a bit spicy dish and lacked taste.
6. Kolkata Mutton Biriyani - quantity was very good and it tasted well too.
7. Phirnee - tasted good. but desserts here are over priced.

Overall, we had moderately good food here.

Uueeee Maa!!!!

That is what was written on a poster frame in Rang De Basanti Dhaba! The reason for "uuueee maaa!!" is quite reasonable ofcourse in a positive note!

Firstly the ambience- "‡§≠‡§Ø‡§Ç‡§ï‡§∞", quirky. Innovative ideas could be seen with kettles and milk cans... Attendants were well behaved-thumbs up for this...

Now comes the food.
Delicacies were lipsmacking...
Those who love little spicy foods can try their special "Uueee Maa"- hari mirch ki roti(which is actually baked with green chilli and coriander leaves!) or laal mirch kaa paratha or both! Both type of Naan-plain/butter were really soft and looked healthy. :D

Their another special dish- "Kashmiri Mutton Roghan Josh". Wish the mutton pieces had little meats on them and little less bony. If they had taken the meaty side little more than the cartilage and bony side during initial preparation, then the review had been a "chummishwari" one... That's a Suggestion though...Still...

Service delivery was quick- another thumbs up.
Their Kolkata Chicken/Mutton Biryani is more than fulfilling. Photos were reserved to be posted(to avoid buri nazar from drooling foods!) ;))
Price tags- "chutki bhar pricy" but chalta hai... üòä

Wish to come here again with positive notes and more quirky new dishes.

This place has a perfect Dhaba atmosphere with the interiors very smoothly done in bright yellow mixed with young quirky colourful¬†flavours showcasing epic liners from Bollywood. Their staff is well-mannered and are mostly on their toes to serve lip-smacking food outside their Dhaba¬†premises for those who like to park their car and grab some quick bites. It is safe to say this place is becoming¬†the Jai Hind of Salt Lake area, mainly for the office area of Sector 5.¬†

Coming to the food, their Dilli 6 ka Tandoori Chicken which was juicy and well grilled, the Kolkata Chicken and Mutton Biriyani's were cooked well, had light flavourful notes of the masala and mixes, the Dilli Ka Butter Chicken with the Tandoori and Rumali roti's was a good change to our biased Jai Hind Butter Chicken tongues, it had a sweet taste and was more of Kolkata style Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, but a change nonetheless. Overall, it was a good experience!¬†

PS. I was looking for some Dhaba style cutting chai to sip on while sitting outside on those yellow coloured benches, but they did not have it on their menu. Would be great if more items could be added to their beverage menu.

Keep it up! :)

Pretty close to MillenniumCity IT Park in Sector V, Salt lake. It's easy to spot! I visited this place for having some kebabs with a friend and wasn't disappointed at all. 

There be a Yellow tractor waiting to welcome you right at the entrance followed by actual dhaba style wooden tables. They have quirky posters and signs for you to read while your food is being prepared.

I tried the Achaari chicken kebab and the patiala chicken kebab. The patiala chicken was thoroughly enjoyable and I had no complaints about it. The Achaari chicken however was a little too oily. Nevertheless it was pretty spicy as it should be and wasn't that disappointing. 

Interestingly the kebabs were served pretty promptly . I think this restaurant opened up not too long ago and the staff here need a little bit of training ( no serious complaints though ).

I always love this joint. Firstly it's very near to office in saltlake and the foods are great as well. Foods are always good specially the malai kebab is real yum-yum.also garlic nuns and chicken bharta ,dal makhani are my all-time favourite.i have tried almost all dishes including mutton,chicken side dishes,jeera rice,fish dishes and most of them are very tasty. The only problem se the staffs who are not very active. They take much time and are very slow. I have witnessed people shouting but no one to take orders or attend table. So there are wait time which do create issues.

Being a regular here for over three years now, one might question as to why suddenly i felt the need to rate it so low. RDB has been a family staple for us, to the point that it has(now had) become synonymous with punjabi food.¬†But today, we faced two different situations which prompted us to say 'na, thaak, aar ashbo na'(bengali for 'Nope, never coming back lel').¬†The first involved Tandoori Chicken. We ordered a plate of Tandoori pomfret and half a plate of chicken tandoori. halfway through the tandoori, i notice a gelatinous texture that is similar to raw chicken, and alas, it was a half cooked mess near the bones. We did get another piece as replacement, but let me clarify why i list this under the said situations. This is the third time in my last 7 visits that i have had to call the waiter for our tandoori chicken being raw. Third is a strike,and sorry to say, i apply it here as well. I'd rather not return to a place where i have to live with the constant fear of having to be served raw chicken under the succulent red charred guise of tandoori.¬†The second though, was very disgusting. We asked them about the sarson ka saag(off the item seasonal menu without a single presence of it on paper), and the waiter replied that it costs 225, no issues. he then says that makki di roti is not available. Any sane person right now, would think that he just let us know that it wasn't there simply because it is the general and accompanying dish of sarson ka saag. no issues. Came the bill, and we see that the price of the saag was under a combo of two makki rotis and the saag. i asked the waiter, who instead of admitting his mistake, kept saying that he told us that makki roti was not available(never once mentioning though that this was a combo item with the saag,and not a separate off the menu item). I do not appreciate lack of transparency from food joints, which is why i have not returned to quite a few places before this incident. A simple apology could have made things even, but he insisted that we were at fault for not knowing that the roti and saag were combo items.¬†I am not going back there for a very long time,if at all. I think i have had my share of this place. To top that, the taste of food has significantly deteriorated since our first outing here back in new year 2014, the day we feel in love with the place. Disappointed, if not pissed.

I've never had a better version of it anywhere in Kolkata. Try 'dilli ka butter chicken' and the 'RDBD special chicken bharta' with tandoori roti.
I'm not really a biryani lover but I wasn't too satisfied with the biryani.

This place is located at Sector 5, Salt lake and serves mainly North Indian Cuisines. This place has a desi dhaba kind of look.

Ambience is cool.

Staffs are efficient.

Tried laccha paratha , butter chicken & Sweet lassi.

Paratha was crispy and well made.
Chicken was very yummy and lip smacking. A must try.
Lassi was thick, creamy and nice.

Prices are reasonable too.

A certainly nice place to dine in.

Located at salt lake sector 5, this is a dhaba in its true sense. It is commendably spacious with outdoor seating as well. The decor is impeccable with the ever famous tractor of the "sarson" khet of Punjab. The seating arrangement is very comfortable. The utensils add to the dhaba feel. We had ordered-Desi nimbu paani and jaljeera- ¬†Very refreshing beverages.Murgh malai tikka- This is what i loved the most! The chicken tikka was so very tender and smothered generously in malai.¬†Murgh reshmi tikka- A spicy and tangy preparation.Since it is winter, we had the opportunity to order the famous sarson da saag and makai ki roti. The saag tasted wonderful, a bit spicy though.¬†Chicken masala- a boneless preparation which is not very spicy and can be accompanied by any kind of indian bread.¬†
Kulfi faluda- The kulfi was flavourful and creamy.¬†Kesaria phirni and the lassi were good as well.Overall, it was a very good dining experience and I would definitely recommend it to everyone who likes dhabe ka khana.

Pocket pinch is reasonable.

cannot comment much on the interiors and the rest since i ate there thrice in the last one month and everytime it was in a typical dhaba style where the food was served in our car and we enjoyed it rather adventurously standing on the street.... but being the typical well known indian restaurant they are,  they do live up to the standards with excellent tandoors and gravy items..... for me,  the differentiator is that they serve till late night,  almost 1.30am and will promptly serve you at your car.... this is indeed a favourite place now with atleast a visit guaranteed in a month....

Located on the main road near the college more crossing. 
As my college is situated in this area, we always heard all about this place. 
When we visited that place, its seating was not like a dhaba but having a mini tractor within the restaurant and the posters hung on the walls,gives you a full desi feel. They serve drinks in milk bottles that are used in villages and food in brass utensils. 
We ate the Tandoori chicken, Chicken Biryani, Chicken bharta and chana masala along with roomali and tandoori rotis. Absolutely loved the food. The service is great and the staff is friendly. 

I've also had the Chicken roll from their take away counter. It's a must have!

Amazing food for a very reasonable price. Quite honestly, judging by the quality of the food against a backdrop of the cost, I'd say that this place is a real deal.

Ordered RDBD Chicken Bharta, Dilli Ki Paneer Makhani, Hari Mirch Ki Roti, and Masala Kulcha. I really liked the Bharta which was shredded chicken in a rather smooth gravy. However, the paneer preparation was even better as it had that silky texture every Paneer lover loves. The Masala Kulcha was okay. Special points to the Hari Mirch Ki Roti. It's a unique bread that can provide you with the most eccentric of tastes while also making your nose run. :-)

This place epitomises a true Dhaba. Highly recommended.

Finally visited and was a happy visit.  
The place is blocked up with a desi quotes and surroundings.  
Seating are good and more than sufficient.  
Food - 
Chicken malai tikka -  Delicious.  Cheesy and tasty.  
Chicken Bharta -  Bit of there type which good but nothing new and great.  
Tandoori roti -  Normal, the way it should be.  
Chicken Biryani - Fitting.  Tastes good.  

I also tried the chicken cheese roll which was excellent and gives you a second call.  

Service was very nice and friendly.  
Place is reasonable as by the location.

To be very honest i was not expecting much from a Punjabi restaurant in Kolkata, but unexpectedly food was good, i wouldn't say it was amazing as you get in Delhi but it was decent , rolls are amazing and service is also very good. Lassi in glass jars can fill your tummy too much and its taste also good. Murg malai kebabs are just amazing.

I generally enjoy home delivered food and eating it peacefully at my own convenience.. Though Rang de Basanti Dhaba has pleasant ambience.. I strongly recommend Mutton Rara from RDBD.. One of the best Mutton preparations i enjoyed when away from home cooked mutton... Please do try.. Thanks

We tried their butter naan and dhaba chicken curry, which was tasted normal like other dhaba foods. No extra speciality.¬†
They keep open for late nights, which is a plus point for the late night food lovers.

est place to get indian food at a reasonable price. Though the place needs some improvement when it comes to ambience but the taste of their food is just mind blowing.

I ordered Mutton Boti Kebab ¬†with Punjabi Daal Makhani ¬†and Keema Kulcha. The price was reasonable and the taste was superb.

Though we need to wait to get a table as the place is over crowded.

Rang De Basanti had always been on my list after listening to reviews by my friends. However, upon reaching there, got to know that the staff had not heard about the phrase "Customer is King". The service is very slow and needs improvement.
Ordered a Kadhai Paneer, Daal Makhani, Masala Kulcha, Butter Naan and Kulfi Faluda. Masala Kulcha deserves 5/5. It was amazing. Loved the paneer too. Naan was however not very soft. 
Would love to visit again if the staff becomes more cooperative.

The food was fantastic, if you're not too much of a health buff and rich food is your thing. 
The kebabs are a revelation, the chicken malai kebab especially. The biryani is also very good, but I'd suggest you to try the dilli butter chicken preferably with a masala kulcha. The lassi is good,nothing outstanding. The firni kesari was rather mouthfilling.

The ambience 

Its like punjab in our own city.

Cool place a lot of space .

Food is a very important thin for a restaurant and these people understand it very well.

Liked the overall setting except the dress of the waiters. 

They also should be dressed like punjabi people to complete the illusion.

Not to mention their chicken rolls which I often have is another item one should try.
The biggest plus point is they are open till very late night.

I have heard good things about starters in here. To be honest I had my doubts about the main course. All of doubts were washed away when I took the first bite of Garlic naan the only word that echoed in my mind is 'wow'. The menu card has various names of food that I want to try. The veg section is pretty amazing. For desert I ordered Gulab jamun that was not up to the mark. It was good but not great. I liked the idea of vanilla ice cream on top of gulab jamun.

The starters are good over here especially the dahi ka kebab, the food is good, however the service is a bit slow. Food usually takes 20-25 times to come after ordering, also it is so full at times that you have to literally search a waiter to place your order. 
It is just a dhaba for the name of it, prices are at par with normal restaurants. The ambience is okay not great.

Aah the place looked neat, with milk can style lighting, a big ass tractor as a showpiece and a huge truck tyre hung on the wall !
Ambience was totally like a sophisticated dhaba. It has both outside and inside sitting. Food was good, nothing extra ordinary! But, the Murg malai tikka (chef's recommendation) was absolutely bang on! Soft tender juicy meat, with a generous amount of fat filled malai on top! Table for 2 were a little too small according to me but overall, prices are on the moderate side, extremely courteous staff, food came quite fast and all in all had a good time there!

The staffs were really helpful and always near you to listen to your needs not like some other restaurants that you have to call them every time for anything. The place can be easily located because its on the main road only. Coming to the food it was above average. Specially their murg malai tikka is awesome. We have ordered dhaba style soup, murg malai tikka, naan, egg fried rice and chicken bharta. The quantity is sufficient for two people and the taste is proper. Just that there is nothing extra ordinary except the murg malai tikka. Recommended

, Kadhai Paneer, Alloo Kulcha & Kulfi Faluda. Having started like Hariyali Paneer Tikka and main course like kulcha with paneer and ending with faluda, just made my day. I felt like I shouldn't leave the table and order again the same items but the problem is my stomach is not allowing that. No worries Rangde Basanti Dhaba.... Main tere phir awanga.... Balle!

Rang De Basanti ! The name itself is so catchy that you'd definitely wanna visit it. This place is my 2nd favourite place for North Indian food. Love the big, bright, bold name board. Nobody would not look at it while passing through.

On walking in, there is a huge yellow tractor. (No you can't take it for a test drive.) You can sit in it and pose for pictures though. On looking around, you see yellow (Yeah, they were all yellow. *sings*). Yellow benches, yellow posters, yellow tables and so on. They balanced the yellow furniture quite well with the brown ones. The walls have fun-tastic illustrated posters, bringing out the quirkiness. Plus tyres have been used as wall decor in the form of a frame and lighting ! Woah ! And whoever said utensils were just for food ? They have freaking used them as decor too ! In a VERY creative way ! Not just this, the ceiling lamps are nice as well ! Over sized, gigantic bulbs !

Coming to the food. What I normally order - ¬†

Paneer Tikka, Tandoori Aloo, Dum Aloo, Dal Makhani, Paneer Butter Masala, Garlic Naan, Masala ThumsUp

No complaints at all ! Plus they serve the food on|in metal utensils which totally supports the "dhabha" theme of the place. Cute glasses which look like long dabbaas without lids are used to serve the drinks.

I don't think I need to say more. :) Content.

It gives you the full dhaba feeling when you enter the place, for example, the big truck on the side etc. The food here is remarkably good, the service is kind of slow, but I had gone during the lunch hour. The ambiance is good, interiors are good. overall, the restaurant is good to visit. A must visit in fact, if you are ever in Sector-5. Also, it is well placed, surrounding offices. If you wish to have a heavy meal, this is the place to go.

This place offers some great food, along with a decent ambience. 

We ordered 
-Punjab di daal makhani
-Aloo do pyaaza
-Lahsuni chicken tikka
- Rumali Roti
- Garlic butter nan
- Onions (we had to order separately)

My friend felt that one of the pieces of his tikka was undercooked. Otherwise the taste was great. It smelled really good. The other items were delicious too. None of us had any complains. The naan was soft, with a generous amount of garlic. The quantity was sufficient too. All in all, this place was value for money. 
Our total bill was Rs.1054 including taxes. So very reasonable too.

"Basanti!In kutto ke samne mat nachna"..... :D You can get a little flavor of "SHOLAY" but¬† not Amir Khan's "RANG DE BASANTI".This is a Punjabi-styled eatery and served picante north Indian foods.

No more filmy dialogue,here i am going to review Rang De Basanti.I went here for dinner and ordered like a mad such as chicken tandoor, keema kulcha,tandoori roti,garlic naan,chicken kadhai,butter chicken,kashmiri mutton roghanjosh etc.

After giving order,we had to wait for 30 minutes and then the attendants came with our super yummy foods.The taste was really awesome and their cooking style made every dish mouth-watering.
Chicken tandoor is perfectly cooked,Kulchas are delicious.The richness of chicken kadhai,butter chicken and kashmiri mutton roghanjosh are¬† very good(really love the hotness).

The feast included flavor-free 'Dilli ki Butter Chicken' that would be indistinguishable in a blind tasting from mammal, seal, or Jell-O. Tandoori Pomfret looked as if it had spent time in tandoor but stopped short of becoming TANDOORI. When summoned, the manager did snap on rubber gauntlets like a doctor preparing for a proctology examination.

Went there on the Day of Dussera. I was delighted when we finally got a table at approx. 10:30PM! The food was quite good, very flavourful without being spicy(a plus point) and also light on the stomach(the naans and kulchas were not as thick as cardboard as in Azad Hind Dhaba). The service was quite speedy(I don't know if it was because of Dussera or it usually is like that. This is one of the few dhabas which serve food which is not served in a pool of oil, butter and extremely spicy masala, which is what makes it a preferred choice over Azad Hind Dhaba and other mid-range Indian eating places.¬†

For starters, we had a plate of panner tikka. Though it was good, I felt that it was a little dry which I don't like. For the main course, we had some naans and kulchas, with kali dal and mix. veg. The kulchas were extremely soft and light on the stomach. They had a filling of paneer, potatoes and spices, which was not very overpowering. The kali dal was also not drenched in butter, which is contrary to what you usually find in dhabas. The mixed vegetables were also flavourful and not extremely spicy.

Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good mid-range place for Indian food. They have a very competent staff. Even on Dussera there wasn't any chaos and things were smooth.

We ordered a full plate dilli 6 tandoori chicken ,butter nun ,chicken bharta and lassi...and the food was yummy..even if it was crowded and the saptami rush,the waiters handled it with ease,inquiring if we needed anything else..they were courteous,and very attentive.....loved the ambience...so with a satisfied tummy and happy heart we stepped out of this place....thank you for making my saptami grand....I'm surely coming back here..

Only one word to say 'heaven for Punjabi food lovers'. This 'typical Punjabi roadside dhaba' themed restaurant is located in Sector V, near College Modh. The restaurant is not a very old restaurant as it replaced another famous restaurant in the same spot, a few years ago. As soon as you walk in, you are greeted with a big tractor, improvised lighting and wall hangings that give the restaurant its Punjabi theme.

Ambiance is the highlighting factor for this restaurant. Decor has been done nicely. Ceiling lamps were shaped like truck oil canisters, kettles and milk containers. Lighting was moderate to dim and Bollywood numbers were being played. Furniture and upholstery resembled a Punjabi dhaba to some extent, but better job could have been done with them. Utensils and cutlery match the theme nicely with dhaba style plates and big steel glasses. Also there are several decoration pieces on the wall such as tractor tires etc.

Jumping on to the food, they have a rich menu of Punjabi and North Indian delicacies. Vegetarians will enjoy a lot as their collection for veg. items are good compared to other restaurants of the same cuisine in Kolkata. For me, I had ordered Murg Malai Tikka, Chicken Biryani and Butter Chicken (B/L) when I went there on a busy afternoon. Also asked for a Fresh Lime Soda to help gulp everything down. Murg Malai Tikka kebabs were one of the softest I've tried till date. They had a generous coating of malai (cheese) and were finger licking good. Chicken Biryani was good and very flavourful, spices were aromatic. Chicken piece was soft and succulent. Butter Chicken was a show-stealer. It comprised of soft and tender pieces of chicken in well marinated mildly spicy gravy. The flavour just melt in the mouth. Lime Soda tasted refreshing!

Pricing is definitely on the higher side. A bill for two came around ~?1300 including taxes, but this sort of pricing is expected form an authentic themed restaurant. Quantity is overwhelming. Half plate butter chicken serves two easily. Kebab pieces were big and Biryani was of generous quantity. Service was nice, server was humble and helped us deciding the right quantity. Serving time was fast, they promised us main course within 30 minutes, but it came well before that. Billing had a little fuss and took bit longer than expected. They also gave me a coupon for free desserts/beverage valid for next visit.

Thumbs up to this restaurant, definitely recommended. Ambiance is surely enjoyable and food is outstanding in its class.

I'm usually a very big fan of this place and I quite recommend this place to others. But on Saptami we had ordered for Butter Naan, Mutton Tara, Mutton Biriyani and I have to admit that the biriyani was stale when we had opened the box. Very embarrassing as I had guests at my place to whom I had boasted about this place. Complete face loss for me from one of my go-to shop for good Indian food üò•üò¢

Visited this restaurant during Shashthi (6th day of Durga Puja-on 7th october 2016). There was a huge crowd waiting outside owing to the festive spirit kf the city. We were told the waiting period was 30 mins. We were called in rather quicker than we had had been asked to expect. Within 12 mins we were called in. I guess this happened cuz this restaurant had a large sitting area in its dining hall. As expected the dining area was housefull and noisy (cant complain about it though.. all of us were in a festive mood and in a celebratory spirit.).
We had ordered murgh malai tikka kebab, patiyala da chicken kabab, kulchas, butter chicken, mutton biryani and chicken biryani. We were happy with eveything and the service was very prompt... food was really voluminous and delicious. It was @Just the size of the meat pieces served in the biryanis were dissapointing... they were smaller than what we had expected. Price is reasonable... overall it costed  Rs. 2170/-
Definitely visiting this restaurant again...

I visited this place with my family on Saptami night @ around 10.30..The place was packed with people.After waiting 30 mints we got a table.....First thing I should mention was the service....damn fast..courtesy the amount of staffing employed to cater the rush during a festive season...We ordered Calcutta Biryani...Fish Tikka Masala...Malai Kofta..Plain Naan & Tandoori Roti...all the items were well cooked..though the quantity was less....The food came at lightning speed much to our surprise but taste didn't drop as it happens in other places as we approach late hours..Must try if u take dinner @ late night..The ambience was so so ...just like a normal street side AC Dhaba...apart from the tractor in the entrance..

I visited this place with my family on the eve of Maha Sasthi. This place was packed as expected but it took just less than 10 mins to get a table. The one thing that attracts is the big yellow tractor right in front of the entrance. The seats were a bit uncomfortable but loved the ambience of this place. So we ordered the Murgh Malai Tikka kabab, Mutton biriyani, mutton roganjosh, patiyala di chicken tikka butter masala and butter naan. To our surprise the food came in just less than 5 mins and that too a festive season. We were very delighted at this point. Murgh malai tikka was very chewy and palatable. 
Loved this item. Also loved the patiyala chicken butter masala and the chicken biriyani. On the other hand the mutton roganjosh was a big let down. It tasted like the regular mutton dopiyaza. The butter naan was very crispy and didn't like it much. 

Overall I had a good time here. Probably the fastest service I ever had in all these years. Food could have been good but can't complain on a festive season. Still would highly recommend this place. Worth a try.

The interior decoration will try to take u to Punjab with all tractors and funny old ads of Amitabh and Gabbar!! An experience to share.. once we went and the AC was off due to some cable fault in the area. The guys took care of us very well. Gave us complimentory fresh lime sodas. The taste of food didnt allow us to complain about the hot temp.

If its good non-veg food you want- it is great non-veg food that you will get. The ambience is pleasant- nothing out of this world- but something which really works. The staff is cordial & coming to the food- we had the murg malai tikka (this is an absolute must try) and some butter chicken with butter nan. Both of which were really nice. Definitely check this place out.

I've not been here personally, but have ordered for delivery one fine saturday afternoon when I had to stay in office.
I won't be long in my review as there is nothing much to comment on the food as the quantity of Biryani on a single plate was way too much for a single hungry person and the taste was good too. I won't say it was very exotic, but it was much on the good side. Only wrongside was, the chicken and the mutton pieces in the biryani were not at all satisfactory. You get a piece 3 times bigger when you eat biryani outside from the local biryani joints.
Murgh Malai tikka as a starter was an excellent decision as the chicken was fresh, juicy and tender, and the malai increasing the taste of the tikka manyfolds.

Having 2 outlets in Kolkata as of now, this one is situated in Salt Lake Sector V. The first thing which draws your attention as soon as you enter the place is the Big Yellow Tractor standing by the door, giving the feel of a dhaba in Punjab. The best thing about this place is that it remains open as late as 1am in the morning. Serving a wide range of North Indian cuisine, the food over here really good. Interior is bright and lively.

We ordered Chicken Bharta, Kurukure Bhindi & Roti. While the Bharta was lip smackingly delicious, the Kurkure Bhindi was toooo crispy that it was crumbling with even a slight touch. Will be back soon to try more dishes .

The first thing u notice upon entering this place is the yellow tractor. It's quite a cool addition to the d√©cor and goes with the dhaba theme of the restaurant. The walls have many quirky posters which are bright and amusing. The restaurant is spacious and clean. I liked the desi twist given to the names of the items on the menu,especially the drinks. For eg, the masala thums up is called " rang de cola". The food here is tasty without being too expensive. We were a large group and hence had ordered a variety of dishes. I had the mutton biriyani with chicken tikka butter masala and liked the taste of both. Overall,had a god dining experience with my friends here :-)

With a TRACTOR inside the restaurant which they call a dhaba, this place appeals everyone. The interior is delightful. Yes, the service is pretty good. The guard always wishes each time you enter or exit. They also have seating arrangements outside the dhaba. There's a parking area too around.
Well, coming to the food, it's worth the price. It's delicious. Lip smacking! Tandoori chicken, biryani, chicken butter masala, all tempt our taste buds.
This is one place where we can go again without another thought.

We went here on a Sunday night, the ambience of the restaurant though ought to be nice as per the interiors, but lack of cleanliness made it look a lil filthy...

Coming to the food, we ordered chicken reshmi kebab in starters and the rating that I have given to the restaurant is only because of this...it was juicy, and well cooked...and tasted really delicious....
In the main course we ordered kadai chickn and butter naan...It just spoiled our mood...it was so sour with whole lots of tomatoes that it tasted like a south indian chicken curry... I hv had kadai chickn ordered from this restaurant and they are not this bad...We asked them to replace the curry and wanted to order something else....but they mentioned that they will recook the dish and make it better...we thought to give it a try...the one that came was obviously a lil beter than the previous one but not like the way we hv had earlier or expected...

We had ordered cold drinks....which was everything but not cold...

The experience was really disappointing and will only recommend this restaurant if its late night and you r wandering for food outside in salt lake...

I had just ordered a plate of garlic nun,  chicken kali mirch , daal makhani,kadhai paneer and chicken reshmi tikka 


Firstly got less than the number of platesordered the restaurant refused to accept that , the nun was very hard almost felt like eating a shoe sole , the dal makhani was very bitter , the kadhai paneer was horrendous and very bland , the kali mirch was atrocious 

If there is any sensible person who loves his/her food their palate and their pocket 

Never ever order from this restaurant,  as this restaurant is a blot in the food service industry

Okay, 
This is indeed a nice food palace to hang out with friends and family. 
'Dhaba' the name goes well with the ambience.
The service is gentle and so the food that made us wow and energetic.
The price is reasonable too.
There is a tractor at the entrance quite good to take photographs on it.
The walls decorated well too with fancy memes and quotes.
Best is chicken tadka and butter nun.
I loved the place and food. 
Would love to visit again. 
Thank you.

The visit to this restaurant happened by chance.I live in South Calcutta and seldom venture to this part of the city, i.e. Salt Lake.I had an assignment in an office just two buildings away from the restaurant and thus grabbed the opportunity to savour the North Indian cuisine of roadside dhabas that this "Dhaba" had to offer.
This was also a roadside dhaba but located amidst the steel corporate structures of the 21st century making the dhaba feel out of place.But once inside it, you will be bemused to see the decor which is quite innovative n out-of-the-box.The little lampshades on top of every table resembling milk cans to the framed posters of funny one-liners --- all of these come as a other-world-thing to all the corporate crowd visiting this place.Now coming to the food part, its pretty good but their menu was quite normal n not as innovative as the decor of the place. I would have liked more fusion food cooked North Indian style, like coming up with something innovative with the Dal Makhani they serve or the Tandoori. Actually these days the kind of experimentation on food going on around the city of ours leaves me craving for more of such innovative dishes. This is just a suggestion for the RDBD guys. Leaving that aside, the food as I said was pretty good.I loved the Chicken Lassuni Kebabs and the overwhelming Butter Naans, yes the Butter Naans were delicious! Do try them if you love buttery and oily food.
In a word if you love North Indian cuisine you can give this place a try.The prices are also quite reasonable too.Happy Dining! :)

Ordering from the same set of restaurants makes me monotonous and hence I felt the need to experiment over the site of Zomato. However, this experiment of mine landed me into a nightmare which I would like to share with all the Zomians (users of Zomato).

On a Friday afternoon, I opened Zomato to order from set of eateries I haven't tried previously and in this search I landed up in ordering from Rang De Basanti Dhaba which was also offering 15% discount. The expected delivery was shown after 50 minutes, though the actual delivery was made 80 minutes later. Despite being late, I wasn't disappointed until the issue started with the bill.

The total over Zomato was showing ‚Çπ886 but they billed me ‚Çπ1008 which clearly defines that they didn't acknowledge the discount. On talking to the Store Manager, he bluntly said that the offer is being given by Zomato and you "understand" with them. I tried to call the Zomato Order Helpline but it was unresponsive. However, I paid the delivery guy and was asking him to show the delivery items for me.

On scanning the items another form of disappointment appeared. The food was delivered in the most pathetic way possible. The lassi, lime soda and cola were the beverages ordered which got delivered in a plastic container meant for delivering food items like rice. On calling the store again, they informed me that is their way of delivery and made an action as if - "Jo karna ha, kar lo". This particular attitude of them made me furious and I asked them to take back the order and which resulted in a heated conversation over the phone. At last, we decided on returning the beverages and taking only the food items. With such a fiasco with the mood to have something went for a toss.

However, the food orders, ie, two types of naan along with a paneer butter masala and chicken item followed by a biryani tasted quite well. Still, the whole trouble for the particular order continued to pinch me.

Qs) Should you visit it
Ans) I would strictly ask you not to.

Qs) Why have I rated them 1 star?
Ans) The rating is given taking into account their behavior over the phone, the lack of decency in the way they treat their customers and also as how they are not bothered about customers but themselves.

We reached this place at 11 PM. It was open and brimming with happy people. The awesome location of this place  is hard to miss. Situated in the middle of the business district, this place gets a steady stream of revellers day in and day out. The 1st thing that attracted us was the tractor. Yes, they have an actual tractor at the entrance. The place is huge and can accommodate 200+ people easily. The tables and chairs are similar what you actually find in the roadside Dhabas and a tad bit uncomfortable. Another unique thing of this place was the poster that had been put up. Old ad and movie posters and some nice quips. The Thalis and classes were stainless steel, again for the sake or the feel. 

Next up is the food. For starters, we had the following 
Fish Tikka
Dahi Kebabs
Chicken Lassuni

For the main course, 
Paneer Do Pyaaza
Punjab di Daal Makhani
Garlic Naam
Dilli ka Butter Chicken
Boondi Raita

For beverages,
Fresh Lime Soda
Sweet Lassi

The portions of the food were humongous and enough for us 4 hungry guys. The quality was good too. Only problem that I had was with the beverages. They were diluted like anything and served in the new container type glasses. It is not aligned with the overall decor. 

Overall, a good experience as the food and ambiance was enriching!

Ordering from the same set of restaurants makes me monotonous and hence I felt the need to experiment over the site of Zomato. However, this experiment of mine landed me into a nightmare which I would like to share with all the Zomians (users of Zomato).

On a Friday afternoon, I opened Zomato to order from set of eateries I haven't tried previously and in this search I landed up in ordering from Rang De Basanti Dhaba which was also offering 15% discount. The expected delivery was shown after 50 minutes, though the actual delivery was made 80 minutes later. Despite being late, I wasn't disappointed until the issue started with the bill.

The total over Zomato was showing ‚Çπ886 but they billed me ‚Çπ1008 which clearly defines that they didn't acknowledge the discount. On talking to the Store Manager, he bluntly said that the offer is being given by Zomato and you "understand" with them. I tried to call the Zomato Order Helpline but it was unresponsive. However, I paid the delivery guy and was asking him to show the delivery items for me.

On scanning the items another form of disappointment appeared. The food was delivered in the most pathetic way possible. The lassi, lime soda and cola were the beverages ordered which got delivered in a plastic container meant for delivering food items like rice. On calling the store again, they informed me that is their way of delivery and made an action as if - "Jo karna ha, kar lo". This particular attitude of them made me furious and I asked them to take back the order and which resulted in a heated conversation over the phone. At last, we decided on returning the beverages and taking only the food items. With such a fiasco with the mood to have something went for a toss.

However, the food orders, ie, two types of naan along with a paneer butter masala and chicken item followed by a biryani tasted quite well. Still, the whole trouble for the particular order continued to pinch me.

Qs) Should you visit it
Ans) I would strictly ask you not to.

Qs) Why have I rated them 1 star?
Ans) The rating is given taking into account their behavior over the phone, the lack of decency in the way they treat their customers and also as how they are not bothered about customers but themselves.

We reached this place at 11 PM. It was open and brimming with happy people. The awesome location of this place  is hard to miss. Situated in the middle of the business district, this place gets a steady stream of revellers day in and day out. The 1st thing that attracted us was the tractor. Yes, they have an actual tractor at the entrance. The place is huge and can accommodate 200+ people easily. The tables and chairs are similar what you actually find in the roadside Dhabas and a tad bit uncomfortable. Another unique thing of this place was the poster that had been put up. Old ad and movie posters and some nice quips. The Thalis and classes were stainless steel, again for the sake or the feel. 

Next up is the food. For starters, we had the following 
Fish Tikka
Dahi Kebabs
Chicken Lassuni

For the main course, 
Paneer Do Pyaaza
Punjab di Daal Makhani
Garlic Naam
Dilli ka Butter Chicken
Boondi Raita

For beverages,
Fresh Lime Soda
Sweet Lassi

The portions of the food were humongous and enough for us 4 hungry guys. The quality was good too. Only problem that I had was with the beverages. They were diluted like anything and served in the new container type glasses. It is not aligned with the overall decor. 

Overall, a good experience as the food and ambiance was enriching!

If you want to experience a typical dhaba atmosphere then you must try this place... As you enter a huge tractor welcomes you just to make you feel the environment of a Punjabi dhaba. They serve the food in stainless steel utensils to make it more apt. The typical north Indian taste is what you get over here. Though i felt its a bit expensive but then its ok for the delicious and quality food you get..

Location : It's located just down the road from Bandhan Bank office in Saltlake Sector-5 main road! 
Service: 2/5
Cleaning:2.5/5
Food :3.5/5

Well this was my first knock at Rang De Basanti Dhaba which is at Saltlake, i went there with my mom for a lunch! Ambiance really impressive for my mom. Loved that red truck at the entrance. Very bright decoration and lovely theme. 
Service very poor . if u really want to enjoy this place I suggest u not to visit this place on Saturday/ Sunday.  Service is really poor. We had to ask 9 times or maybe more, just to receive our  order. Table was not clean properly we asked them to wash it again. Empty tissue stand. They placed our order @table after 20 to 25mint. The dishes were notably tasty but insipid. Egg curry was decent . I liked that mutton kosha .  Butter nun was also good.  This place is ok for a causal lunch or dinner. Bathroom was terrible. Its was not clean. Honestly my experience was not so good that i can say " will definitely visit again"  . But you people can try once if never been. But don't visit on weekends

It was a special day today and we(my husband and me) decided to go to Rang De Basanti dhaba for lunch. I walk past it everyday, so I just thought to give it a try today. 
Usually I have chicken roll(both wrapped in Paraguay and rumali roti) and I find them good.
The ambience is good as there was mostly office-goers. A special mention of the interior decor- yellow was the color. There was a yellow tractor and framed print advertisement of few noted brands of 90,'s.
I liked the plates on which we had our food and the tumbler in which the fresh lime soda was served.
Today we opted for a simple menu. Murgh Reshmi Tikka- at the sight of it I started gobbling those up. Those tasted good. It was followed by Dilli ka Butter Chicken(boneless), the signature dish of the dhaba. It was a red gravy, well balanced and there were ample chicken pieces. We ordered half plate that sufficed us both. Along with it plain Tandoori Roti and Garlic Naan. Those were well baked. From the beverage section we had Fresh Lime Soda-sweet. Celebration is incomplete with a dessert and we ordered Kulfi Faluda. A bit more rose syrup would have been good.
In short, it is a place worth trying.

Finally visited this place on friendship day. First of all ambience was good. Sholay theme which was nicely displayed. Friendly waiters and staffs. Good food (could't have paneer which me and all of my friends wanted the most because they said it was smelling and had to be removed). But overall it was a nice experience and a complete dhaba wali feeling.

Biryani was cold, ¬†chicken piece was small though was told will be big by the waiter. Too many customers, quality is worsening. COME ON RDBD, PEOPLE ARE NOT FOOL AS YOU THINK.

This restaurant has everything to be called an actualy Dhaba. As you enter you'll find a big tractor that takes you back to the state of Punjab. Tasted the egg chicken roll and mutton biryani.. The egg chicken roll was tasty! smouldering in sauce and sufficient amount of chicken was given. The mutton biryani was a big thumbs UP. excellent cooked. 2 pieces of mutton. and perfectly cooked rice. The quantity was also good. Good restaurant. Service is also decent . Staff cordial. 
Ordered a non veg combo once.  Nothing special. Didn't enjoy the chicken do pyaaza.. No taste.  Bland.

Dhaba experience and environment is what you can expect here. A modern day dhaba which serves some delicious dhaba styled "khana".
Butter chicken, dal makhani and tandoori roti was fantastic.
Biggest let down was that there was no complimentary plates of onions, lemons and chilli's like typical north indian dhaba.üòùüòú

"DHABA"..Yes you heard it right.But you will not get any feel inside the dine premise. Few Bollywood movie pics and it's just like any northern India restaurant to me. At least the siting area is almost similar to Delhi or some place near by to it. I have stepped inside to this outlet twice and prefer vegetarian foods on both occasions.I like their food but they are not justified to the price quoted in their menu. Also I have received a very bad feedback from my guest for their non-veg items like they keep the same gravy for different items. Even I was surprised how a food lover can skip his food in this famous place.Their service is good even the serve food even if you park your vehicle at near by. I have witnessed people consuming alcohol and ordering food from this place.Surprise! How it went unnoticed from the hotel management and the police. Advantage of the location they run this outlet smoothly. The other outlet is not as popular to this one. One can have a meal at this place for a change.

I have been wanting to check out this place for quite some time now after reading all the good reviews, especially their "Dilli ka Butter chicken".

Ordered in Chicken Biriyani and the famous "Dilli ka Butter chicken". First let me add, I was impressed with the quantity. The biriyani tasted really good. It wasn't the usual Kolkata Biriyani, but they had added their own lil twist, which I quite liked.

And the butter chicken was Delicious. The chicken was so tender and juicy. Just melts in your mouth. Do try it out, you won't regret it.

Loved the food so much ordered in again after a couple of days. Ordered the RDBD special Chicken Bharta. Delicious as well, but the first place goes to the Butter Chicken. The Biriyani that day wasn't very good. But then again, very few restaurants are consistent with their food.

Well this was my first knock at Rang De Basanti Dhaba which is at Saltlake Sector V.
But the place along with its mouth watering food and the ambience was up to the mark.
It has tried to put forward a feeling of being in typical and indigenous punjabi dhaba which is quite commendable. Now the coming to good part that is Food; Tandoori chicken with the appetizer Pudina chatni is a treat to the tastebuds. Mutton Biriyani that is served is in apt quantity as well as quality with deliciously cooked mutton piece.

To be honest, the effort they put in for the look and feel of punjab right from a tractor at the entrance to all kinds of funky lighting / symbolism was good and appreciable (see pics)

The food was sumptuous and tasted well although in parts it was more bangla_type_punjabi rather than Punjabi but still tasted good

For a mix of naan, salad, dal makhani &  kali chicken the bill was only ‚Çπ651 which is highly reasonable. Would rate this place good for a nice light lunch / laid back no frills dinner.....

Been to this place so so many times...but yesterday was one experience that was really patheic..!!
The restaurant wasnt that packed up, but still the service was lagging majorly..!!
Ordered for paneer tikka and tandoori aloo tikka, got it after 30 mins of ordering
The main course was served with the starter , which was shocking, even after objecting the waiter just shrug his shoulders..!!
When we finished our starters, we jumped into the main course...
The roti were not at all chewable 
On complaining they brought the roti by reheating it in the oven and said this is what we can do..!! I mean seriously...??
Luckily enuf Azad (waiter) recognised me and helped me out with fresh roti and apologised.
Will be thinking twice before coming here now..!!
2.5 is only for Azad and the Dilli ki Paneer Makhni..!!

As this restaurant is at a stone throwing distance from my office, I usually prefer to call them for regular office parties. I have not entered into this restro yet but I had been taking delivery of various rolls and kababs for quite long period. As I always crave for chicken kababs, I have a huge affinity towards RDB. They make delicious kababs. If you have office in sector V and you are planning for some evening munch, this is the best place to opt for. I personally recommend their rumali rolls and kababs. The RDB staffs are very humble. They talk politely over the phone and deliver at time. And yes, the accept cards while delivering the order.

We ordered in this Friday a decent chicken bharta , RDB special dal mouth watering makhani and tandoori Roti's. The Roti's don't sit well so isn't the best for take out or delivery. If you are dining in go ahead and on your way out try the delicious ice cold pan.

This dhaba serves better food and the ambiance is far better than roadside eateries. One can find this place open till late night. There is one tractor here which gives you the Punjabi Desi feel. I needed to wait for about 15 minutes for the food to arrive but it compensated the taste.
We ordered Mutton Briyani, Kesari firni, Dilli ki butter chicken, Salad and Murg Malai tikka. They servd the briyani in small copper handis...its feels good to have. 
After office hours, its a good place to visit.

5 of us friends went for a rather late night dinner at RDBD post an IPL match. The place was relatively full at around 11, not over crowded but yea kinda full. Service was the major concern at that point. No waiters to attend, we had to shout few times to make them come to us, add loooong waiting time post ordering as well. Apart from that the whole experience was good. Starting from the big yellow tractor at the entrance, to the quirky lampshades and installations the ambiance was full of Punjabi flavors. 
And the food, we had Butter Nan, Dal tarka , chicken bharta , chicken tandoori, and gulab sharbat and fresh lime soda. All the items were good, the only one worth mentioning though is their chicken tandoori. Well marinated, well grilled, succulent sumptuous treat. I can go back just to have that. Overall a descent experience.

This restaurant can bowl out anyone with it's eccentric dhaba ambience...by stepping here one can't simply ignore the huge tractor, followed by food offerings in steel plates giving a complete Punjabi roadside dhaba vibe üîõ
‚ô¶ So we ordered mutton biryani, chicken biryani along with chicken chaap.
To be honest, food is not as good as its decor, but decent enough ...although I expected it to be better going by the vibe.
Mutton pieces were quite succulent, biryani was flavoursome, didn't like the chap though.
‚ô¶ Staffs were prompt and service was fast too.
No marks less on this section.

Had gone to this place on a holiday with a lot of expectations but sadly all were not met. We had ordered Achari Panner Tikka and Stuffed Mushrooms for starters. The starters were good. For main course we ordered a dal makhani which tasted a bit weird and Aloo Pyazi which was really bland and horrible. Would not recommend anyone to order it. Had ordered a biryani and raita too which were nice. The food lacked the spice and the zing which one expects from dhaba's food.

Dropped in for lunch on a weekday afternoon and the place was still crowded with a lot of office goers. The place is done up like a dhaba with a tractor finding pride of place! We ordered a malai tikka kebab for starters and chicken bharta and tandoori rotis for main course. The kebab was melt in the mouth and the cheesy topping was great. The rotis n the bharta was ok. Nothing to write home about. We also ordered a masala chhanch which was nicely flavoured with pudina n quite refreshing on a sultry day. Another point worth mentioning is that the place is quite pocket friendly and offers good value for money. Overall a sumptuous lunch!

The moment u enter this restaurant ur eyes would stuck into their decor which is based on a specific theme. Visited many a times especially during my internship days. The truck at the entrance would certainly took ur attention! Usually i prefer roti with some side dishes in a dhaba. Tried chicken tikka butter masala, reshmi butter masala, tandoori chicken, butter naan. Awesome meal nd fulfilling ur tastebuds!

Very popular and favoured Dhaba located in College More. Have been to this place several times and was never disappointed with the quality of the food. Interiors are well done and the service is real quick.
For starters one should definitely try
Stuffed Mushroom Tikka - it was nicely prepared and tasted well
Achari Paneer Tika was fine too. Just that if they wouldn't have sliced it,it would have tatsed better. The masala was not evenly spread because of which it didn't turn out to be that good.
For main course we tried
Punjabi Dal Makhani which was really average. It didn't seem to b a Dhaba Dal at all and was on the sweet side.
ALU do pyaaza was just below average and really a big disappointment. This used to be my fav subz. The preparation method has changed and I would really not suggest to go for this. It was too bland and lacked major spices.
Breads were decent best being Garlic Naan and Masala Kulcha.
Biryani was decent and well cooked with freshness and fragrance intact.
Raita was complimenting it and properly made.
Suggestion would be that they should provide onions as complimentary with north Indian food and they should look into their earlier method of preparation of food and should try maintaining it everytime.

Good dhaba food, and soft, succulent kababs are the trademark of Rang de basanti dhaba, service can be more couteous, rest its a good place for family dining.

This restaurant is located in sector 5, right by the main road, near IBM.
 
Well, after watching a movie at RDB I decided to give this restaurant a try.

Staff is courteous and polite.

Dishes ordered:
 masala chaanch
Chicken malai tikka kebab
Chicken bharta
Tandori roti
Papad

The masala chaanch was quite refreshing and was a palate cleanser.

The chicken malai tikka was oh so delicious. Loaded with cheese, this kebab was a sure winner. Served with green chutney and pickles, onion.

Next up, the chicken bharta. Umm, not the kind of bharta I was expecting to be honest. I was looking forward to a sort of creamy and velvety gravy with pulled chicken, but the gravy was a bit loose. Flavour was there but not the right creamy texture of a dhaba style Bharta.

Tandori roti and papad was normal, the way it should be.

Overall, a satisfying meal and not unhealthy and greasy like other dhabas. 

P.S.- the prices on the menu card are exclusive of taxes.

This urban dhaba has always proved its quality with its platter. Firstly, its decoration is definitely worth mentioning. The hanging lanterns to the silver thali, the tractor, the posters will give a complete dhaba feeling. The food has always tasted good whenever you visit it. Its a must visit place for a sumptuous meal. Worth trying are the breads with types of veg/non veg side dishes and kebabs. Few of my favourites are mutton boti kabab, chicken malai tikka kabab, butter chicken, mutton rogan josh, chicken bharta, mutton kaleji masala, kulfi faluda and many more

We visited this outlet for lunch in a hot and humid summer afternoon this year...
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Our simple menu was comprised of butter naan, masala kulcha, Chicken Lassuni, Chicken Hariyali Tikka. The breads were well prepared. Both of the chicken preparations were tasty. 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Among desserts, we ordered Kulfi Faluda and Kesaria Phirni... But due to non-availability of the former we had to remain content with the latter. The phirni dint disappoint us though. 
Room for improvement: Serving time (The servers took too much time to serve us the preparations).

Service is very slow for all kinds of orders, from home deliveries to in-house meals. The food just takes forever to arrive.
However, after the long wait, the food is not bad. The servings are quite generous. But then, the area is flocked with restaurants which are far more appealing than this in all respects, from food to ambiance to service.

I had ordered food online today through Zomato for home delivery. Delivery was done half an hour delay of the maximum time given by RDB. Order was delivered incomplete when we checked it they said it was by mistake ee are sending the forgotten food in 15 minutes but we received it after 50 minutes. All the food got cold and breads too hard kebab soggy and curries and dal got very thick . Due to this our total dinner was a waste.

A nice dhaba with interesting decor, reflecting Punjabi culture. You see a whole tractor the moment you enter the restaurant. Good food and prompt service. The lassi and the nimbu pani were served in mason jars and kebabs came in square steel trays. Also the dining plate was made of steel, to do with the dhaba ambience.

The malai kebab was simply delicious. The butter roti and kadhai chicken were good, nothing great. The patiyala tikka butter masala was an interesting item.

The gulab jamun with ice cream is something that you should skip. The gulab jamun isn't gulam jamun at all. It is more like pantua.  And that too is not served hot.

I'd have given a 4.5, however 0.5 dedectud for the gulab jamun disaster.

I quite liked the place and the food. We ordered Sweet Lassi, Masala Jaljeera, Mutton Biryani, Garlic naan ,Chicken patiyala tikka masala and green salad. The drinks were really good, perfectly sweetened and aptly cold. They were served in interesting bottles. The garlic naan was good and the chicken side dish was excellent having soft and juicy pieces. The gravy was extremely tasty, perfect for having with rotis. Biryani had the right flavour but was a bit dry,having two bony mutton pieces. The service was impressively fast. The place has a small area inside dedicated for kids, benches are availabe outside for waiting purpose . An overall good experience.

A proper roadside punjabi dhaba type decor and ambience, loud and energetic

Wooden chairs with cushions ajd similar tables
Steel utensils and a tractor model to add to the feel

Coming to the food, they vary a lot from good to disgusting

Kababs like patiyala tikka and achari paneer are awesome and so is the cheese and peas rice but with naan and kadhai paneer there was disappointment

Lassi and chhaach are surprisingly the worst stuff dere

Staff are courteous

Pocket pinch is reasonable!!

The best aprt about Rang De Basanti Dhaba is that it is opem till 1 am. Everything I've tasted so far is good. Just a recommedation: Please increase the number of items in the menu :)

The place had a different sort of a decor. Bollywood themed restaurant. However the food was not all that special. Its not something you would want to try over and over again. Biriyani wasn't well prepared. Lassi and the kebabs were still better. Service is a bit slow. Attendants seemed a little dumbstruck with their job descriptions. However 3/5 would be well suited for the average experience.

Usually I have had nice experience visiting this place but yesterday night the home delivery was a bad experience.

We ordered for masala kulcha n naan. They were in horrible condition, totally burnt and hard (total black in lotsa parts). We were hardly able to take pieces out of it for a bite. May be in a dine in that would have worked, eating instant n fresh but for a home delivery it will not with anyone.

The subzi, mix veg was also not cooked well, it seemed just gravy was added to veggies and served, not at all cooked well. Had a bad night after eating such stuffs.

Team rang de basanti, these are minute things to be taken care of even while catering to home delivery orders. Kindly take note and don't disappoint others. For home delivery purposes you definitely lost one customer at least.

After a proper saturday outing went here for dinner. i was very hungry after an entire day outing. The first thing that amused me was the huge yellow tractor as soon as i entered the dhaba. The sitting area is huge. And it was full. I could see so many heads. We ordered tandoori chicken, masala kulcha, butter nun, chicken bharta, chicken reshmi butter masala, phirni, kulfi, gulab jamun and fresh lime soda. The tandoori chicken came in really fast and we dived in. The tandoori chicken was perfectly cooked and very tasty. But the green chutney given here is not as good as i have tried in other places. I loved the masala kulcha. Butter nun was normal. I loved the chicken side dishes as well. Very tasty and all came in quite fast and we did not have to wait. Then was turn of the desserts. I tasted the phirni which was great too. I absolutely loved the hot gulab jamuns. They were very tasty. I love the crockery here. Its so typical punjabi. And what i love is the cute bottles in which they serve fresh lime soda. Loved each and every dish. Favourite was tandoori chicken and masala kulcha. Food was really really great. And the interior wow. Not a very expensive interior but very clever one. Use of typical simple things like the milkman's milk container, then huge bulbs for lighting. Then crockery attached to the walls. Huge tyres with posters inside. Pura punjabi style. And that yellow tractor üòò

We went here on Friday as a group of 21. An order of 62 tandoori rotis accompanied by chicken bharta and egg tadka was placed. The initial serving time seemed like an eternity, because we had spent the entire day in a pool and were starving beyond imagination. However, in retrospect, the quantity of food ordered was huge enough that the serving time seems rational now. 

The dishes all tasted pretty good, the gravies had a lot of chopped chillies, adding to the spice (a good thing for people like me, who enjoy their food hot). Overall, good food, good service, reasonable prices. (The bill came to about a 4.5k sum. Slightly more than we would have ideally liked, of course.)

PS- note the quirky interiors. There's even a tractor present.

Located near College More, Sector 5, Saltlake.
The decor gives more of a Dhaba feel. With the tractor being a piece of attraction and fun activity for kids. 
Food - We ordered Murgh Malai Tikka for starter. Since it was RDBD special.
Though the chicken was well marinated, juicy and soft, it was basically more of a Chicken cheese Tikka. Better prepared at other places. 
Dilli wali Murgh was nice. Boneless, red spicy gravy. Rich and lovely for the palate.
Better than that was Chicken Reshmi Kebab in Butter Masala. I personally love this dish because of the brilliant taste of the gravy. The sweet tinge makes my taste buds happy.
The Indian breads were pretty decent with the exception of Lachha Paratha, which was crispy and soft both at the same time.

Something which marred the moment was the lack of impromptu service. We had to wait time and again for every time to come.

Though it was pretty crowded, but that cannot be an excuse.

Pros - Good decor which makes people attract. Taste of the dishes. Not that a pinch on the pocket. Location.

Cons - Service. Biggest disappointment. Quantity of the starters (maybe we ordered the wrong item).

This yellow yellow quirky dhaba style place is going to steal your heart in the very first sight and it's food might not disappoint you.You will get the entire essence of a dhaba from it's steel utensils to it's dhaba style washroom.
Let's come to food.We took achari chicken as starter and it was delicious.For main course we tried butter tandoori,butter nun and chicken varta. All were up to the mark the quantity was pretty perfect for two people.Cold drinks and desserts are slightly over priced.Otherwise all the dishes were reasonably priced and suffice for two people.
For two people:Cost will be around 800.
I liked the place and would like to revisit here.

Location : At College More Sec 5, Beside the Mohan Udyog Car dealership .

Ambiance : The ideal sentence would be " a cross between the roadside Dhaba & local railway station ! " . A Big fat tractor greets you on the way in .Huge yellow Tables like the ones at the waiting rooms of railway platforms are found everywhere . Huge Bulbs hang about like the ones at Spencer or More . AC barely works . Clearly ¬†a very cheap / average Look . But the most vivid aspect of the place is a constant ruckus from all the people at this huge 2000 sq. ft. plus space constantly chirping about making it literally a " Railway Station" .¬†

Service : Slow and Messy .The waiters are either blind or are very bad at waiting tables ! . Takes them an eternity to find you ¬†& the rest of the eternity ( 40 mins. plus) is spent waiting for the food to arrive !! ¬†¬†

Food : Ordered the Murg Reshmi Tikka & the Lucknowi Mutton Korma along with some Tandoori Rotis and Naans . Leaving aside the insane waiting time , when ¬†the food finally did come it was piping hot which was a relief .. Both the dishes were well made to the point that one couldn't find a flaw unless one was too picky ! The Reshmi Tikka with Gravy and about 4 pieces was quite tasty with a high spice content . Reddish hue all around and adequate quantity . The naans and the Roti was Crisp and thin .¬†
¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† But the apple of the Taste Buds :P or so to speak was the Korma . Buttery creamy pieces of mutton with a very interesting taste and smell infusion . It was so so juicy . Both the dishes were quantity wise flawless .¬†

Cost for 2 : 950/- +¬†

Final Conclusion : Ambiance is the main reason why you shouldn't visit this place !! One wishes to go a dining establishment for dinner with the sole purpose of some quality food accompanied by Serenity . While the food maybe Fine and delicious , the constant ruckus & chatter around you would make you feel like your office was quieter !! ¬†It's like a Urbanised Langarkhana !! A one time visit at best ...

So after Raize the bar we all hopped down to Rang de Basanti for more kebabs. The place is huge and decked up to give a dhaba feel. It has a big yellow tractor on the left and different posters and big jugs hanging as  lamp shades. But the ACs were either on high temperature or not working properly. It was too hot inside. Service is slow. But the food is served fast so that is good. 
Starting with the drinks. Everything was bad. They are served in a glass bottle. The fresh lime soda had no fizz and was too sour and sweet together. It was more of a nun lebu chini jol than the said drink. I think they make it in huge quantities and keep it hence the fizz goes away. I don't drink lassi but it looked very watery and the rang de cola which is masala pepsi was the only decent one amongst them. 
The chicken lasooni kebab was soft and delicious. The dhania and murgh seekh kebab could have been softer. It was too dry. The dahi kebab is a must try, it has a tangy taste. We ate all the kebabs with roomali roti. The mutton boti kebab was succulent but few pieces were hard and might have needed a bit more of cooking time. The mutton rara was really bad. Overloaded with spices and tomato and not at all flavourful. 
The washroom was very stinky. Although it is the customers who make a mess there but a cleaning person should be kept so that it doesn't stink.

It was my first visit here. My experience is superb. The kebabs are as you say "crunchy outside and juicy inside". Perfectly prepared. We odered lasuni kebab, achari kebab and tangdi kebab and fresh lime soda. In main course we odered chicken bharta, keema matar, mushroom masala, garlic nun and keema kulcha. The mushroom was avarage but chiken bharta and keema masala was great. I liked the garlic nun better than the keema kulcha. Keema kulcha was not upto the mark. Overall experience is preety good.

Decent place to have dinner after office hours, we usually visit this place in weekdays when craving for typical north Indian food - naan/ tandoori chicken etc. In so many visits I paid, I have tried almost every item in the menu and I really loved 'hari mirch ki roti' & dilli6 chicken butter masala. Tandoori chicken and Tandoori Aaloo are also month watering good. Overall very budget friendly eatout option

As a restaurant that has come up in the place of the legendary Azad Hind Dhaba, Rang De Basanti has made a name for itself in the Kolkata food ¬†market. We, a group of friends had visited the place during Durga Puja and though the standard of food many have been a little less during that time, nevertheless we quite satisfied with the decor that was just like the replica of a highway side dhaba. In the food department, we had ordered Chicken Biriyani, Hariyali Paneer Tikka, Dilli Ka Butter Chicken Masala, Mutton Rarra, Tandoori Roti and Masala Kulcha. The Biriyani was standard but the meat items and bread was quite good. I was especially satisfied with the Masala Kulcha that they served and I will definitely visit the place on a non occasion day to get the real feel of the place.

Visited this restaurant over a weekend evening and found that service was pathetic. We waited almost 1 hour for the entry which is fine but after that we had to wait another 1 hour to get our order served. On top of that, they served few dishes wrong from what we had ordered. Bill again had errors, and surprisingly the manager seemed non apologetic for any of these.

Food is decent as everyone else had pointed out & the ambience gives you the dhaba feeling, but pathetic service kills the entire experience.

The go to place for all them Northies in NewTown. As you can feel from the name it gives you all that feel you want from a dhaba with seating options both inside and outside (not somewhere to sit in Kolkata weather). The menu correctly highlights the best bets you can have, with a tractor. The best part is the timing that is suffice to support your late night food cravings, especially for a special meal. All in all a good place to eat at. Staff is really busy so best of luck with you "Bhaiya" call.

After a stint with the Eden Gardens we visited this place around 11:30 in the night to get some sumptuous dinner. The very first thing that caught my attention was the dining space which is huge and is ideal for such eateries who keep their doors open till late night. The interiors are pretty sleek and simple with posters adorning the walls. The lightings was adequate and i found the lamps quite innovative. The seating chairs are quite uncomfortable though.

Now coming to their food, The Chicken Tandoori was made to perfection. The marination was absolutely stunning and was tandoored to the perfect notch. The Chicken Bharta was equally impressive. I enjoyed the spiciness of the dish and it proved to be an excellent side dish with the Roti's. The Chicken Tadka was a bit disappointing. It tasted a lot sour.

Now coming to the part which makes this place an ABSOLUTE NO for visiting. Their SERVICE. Haven't seen any place as bad as this when it comes to service. After asking for like 10 times, finally someone came to take our order. Inspite of mentioning that the Tandoori must be served with the rest of the dishes, the Tandoori arrived early and the rest of the items took an unusual long time to arrive. Had to ask like 10 times again to get some water. We ordered some extra roti's while eating and had to wait more than 10 mins for it. The Fresh Lime Soda and Gulab Sharbat was served at approx the same time when they gave the bill. Bonkers they are when it comes to customer satisfaction.

Overall, inspite of the satisfactory dishes, avoid this place as it is irritatingly bad in terms of service. There will be times when you will feel like walking out in the middle of your meal.

This is itself a landmark in sector 5. Formerly it was Azad Hind Dhaba. Thereafter it has come up with the actual dhaba themed ambience and the name changed to Rang De Basanti.

The tractor inside connects with the Punjabi flavour. There are several lanterns hanging from the ceiling.

The chicken side dishes are prepared with perfection. Chicken Kadai, Dilli ka Butter Chicken, RDBD Chicken Bharta, Dhaba Chicken Curry are all equally delicious. I prefer butter nun with the chicken instead of going for Biriyani. There are so many places in the city to provide you better Biriyani. The soft   nun goes perfectly well with the thick ,rich,well cooked chicken gravy. But it is not too oily to be on the safer side. 

In the veg section I have tried Amritsary Chole and Mixed Vegetable. They could not do justice to any of the two dishes. 

They serve the beverages in very unique wide necked bottles instead of glasses. So the quantity is also more. I had taken Fresh Lime Soda which was refreshing.I am yet to try the Kebabs. They also prepare different varieties of Rolls outside. But rolls are little overpriced. Proper outdoor seating area is also there for people who want to eat rolls. This is an appreciable gesture as most of the restaurants of the same standard who also sell rolls clearly say it in writing that sitting not allowed for those who would have only rolls.

Service is slow during lunch hours. You have to remind the waiters to serve all the dishes you have ordered. The dishes are more or less moderately priced. The quantity of the chicken side dishes are sufficient to serve 2.

This place is very near to College More. As we went there to celebrate a friend's birthday who is  a vegetarian , we ordered veg item (it was her day ). We ordered lashuni naan , butter tandoori roti , hari mirch naan and pudina naan along with rdbd special butter daal , kurkuri bhindi ,paneer dopayaja, jeera aloo and jeera rice. Among all these naans taste good and the paneer is very soft and tasty. Jeera rice needs a special mention for being so perfectly cooked. I personally don't like there version of jeera aloo. I have never tried veg items in restaurant so I can't judge them with others. But yes the food is tasty and the price is reasonable. The decor is funny , a tractor becomes the centre of attraction of the kids

This place deserves a better rating than what it has on Zomato.
The big tractor you see as you enter the place adds up to the 'dhaba' ambience of the place. Also love their seating arrangement both indoor & outdoor facilities. 
Love the punjabi food here, some of my favourites being the Chicken Malai Kabab & of course the butter chicken. The biryani here is okayish, not one of my preferred dish here but it isn't too bad, it's just average. I feel one should order the naan and rotis here along with the dal makhani and their gravy chicken dishes, perfect combination. Oh and ya the quantity they serve is also excellent.

Food is as always great..
Their home delivery standards are much better compared to in restaurant.Am really  impressed with their home delivery even at peak times.

With my experience of visiting over 6-7 times, I will say their in restaurant service needs to improve a lot.they serve too slow even when not crowded.not much agile when a customer is calling the waiters.Food quality wise v good but quantity is saddening.
So it's better off with home deliveries.

Never have I entered a restaurant and found a tractor inside it, that too right inside the diner. I think they took the Dhaba tag too seriously. The place seems to be popular, crowded with the usual IT crowd of sector V. We ordered Chicken Lassuni Kebab as a starter and followed it up with Butter Tandoori Rotis and Chicken Bharta. The kebabs were succulent, delicious. The Bharta was OK, I've had better at lesser places. For dessert we had Gulaab Jamun with vanilla ice cream. The food is good, but the place needs a bit more maintenance. They provide regular stainless steel utensils to keep up with the dhaba image, which is fine as long as they are clean. However, the ice cream bowl had a very loose stand, making it shaky and difficult to eat out of. Also, the air conditioning system was dripping. These problems, although temporary, need to be taken care of to increase customer satisfaction.

Finally at Kolkata, a place known for its food n ppl. First destination was Rang de Basanti Dhaba. The restaurant is themed on the mixture of Punjab and Bollywood, with decent ambience. They also have a seating outside but considering the humidity in Calcutta i recommend a table inside.We ordered Paneer Butter masala, RDBD spl dal thadka ,masala kulchas n tandoori rotis. The masala kulchas were the best, but thw paneer butter masala was just normal. We also ordered lassi n tanda kola. The drinks were  lilttle over priced n not worth the money.  The service is just mediocre, the guy took such a lot of time to serve us our food n we had to rwmind him also. 
Overall i loved the food, but the price is just a bit steep and service is okish!!

Had been intending to try out this place since it opened a couple of years back, and did get the golden opportunity today. They are situated @ College more, Sector 5 at the same place where Azad Hind Dhaba used to operate earlier. Ordered a Dal Makhani and 1 Pudina Paratha for office delivery and my office is very near to this restaurant. The bill of Rs. 229/- is not much of a pocket pinch ‚Äì considering they provided free delivery as well as free packing. However, I received the food after more than an hour ‚Äì which did not bother me much. 

Packing was decent and Dal came in an air tight plastic container and parantha in silver foil. Dal was a typical Punjabi one ‚Äì hot and just too good! It also had certain pieces of sliced green chillies, which went very well with the Dal. Pudina parantha was also nice, but became somewhat soggy and should have been better. To conclude, they are a good replacement of their earlier counterparts ‚Äì Azad Hind Dhaba!

This place came to our rescue many times when we had a sudden surge to have some "desi" delights be it after an awesome trip to WetoWild or at 1 o clock at night!!! Yeah! This place is one of the very few places in Kolkata which remains open till 2AM. Big deal I would say in city like Kolkata where late night restaurants are hard to find!
Anyways, the food is absolutely amazing. You do get that "dhaba" flavour which you look for in Indian cuisines and many Indian restaurants fail to deliver that ! We had butter nun, kulcha, tandoori roti, jeera rice, chicken butter masala, tandoori chicken, paneer tikka kabab, chicken tadka and daal fry. As coolers they had this amazing lassi they serve in small bottles! The Indian breads were amazing: not burnt neither undercooked! Crispy N moist at the same time generously dipped in butter !! Really good! The chicken dishes were absolutely amazing! Looks rich but doesn't give you that bad after effect you usually have after having rich Indian gravies! The daal tadka was the stealer! Simple yet delicious! Unexpectedly good!
Ambio is nicely done keeping the flavour of an ethnic Indian dhaba with posters of 90s filmstars and tyres in the wall. There is a tractor parked inside the restaurant right near the entrance! Treat for selphie-loving peoples and people wanting to have some pics on the tractor!
Price is moderate! Staffs are very courteous and helpful!
Do visit this place if you wanna taste dhaba signature desi delights or wanna have some chicken butter masala at 1 o clock at night!!

Nice North Indian food. Variety is nice. But prices are very high as compared to the location, quality and quantity. For big group party, it's apt. The kadai paneer, Chicken butter Masala and garlic naan are nice. North Indian food lovers will surely like it.

The best north Indian food you can get in Kolkata.
They understand the delicacy of food.
I have been in search of such a restaurant forever now. Roadside restaurant with a glass side,spacious interiors,polite staff and beautiful food.
We ordered the famous chicken Delhi 6 kebab,dahi ke kebab,naan and butter paneer.
The chicken kebab were lovely but the smooth,subtle flavoured dahi ke kebab stole my heart. The naans were perfect and the kadhai paneer authentically made.
The only thing I did not like was the chaanch I ordered. .it was just not right.

Loved the decor . .will go again and again and again

Formerly known as Azad Hind Dhaba, this is one of the most happening places in Salt Lake Sector V, other than the busy tall storied buildings housing corporate offices! I have been coming here for many years now. Don't know since when exactly, but somewhat around 8-10 years! The location is pretty easy, just board an auto from Salt Lake Karunamoyee and you would find this outlet just before College More / IEM (Institute of Engineering & Management).

The main attraction for me were there delicious Kachoris and Kosha Alur Dom which they used to serve during the evening time. Apart from this, they also had huge Samosas and hot Jalebis. But, alas, the days Kachoris and Alur Dom are long gone. Undoubtedly, the Alur Dom they used to prepare, could beat any standard Bengali Restaurant.¬†

Coming to the main course, have tried Biryani (Mutton/Chicken), Chaap, Bharta and Roganjosh. Among Kebabs, Tandoori and Aloo are my favorites here. The quality here isn't great. The service is usually slow but the waiters are mostly well-mannered. If I were to pick just one item from here, I would opt for Tandoori Aloo. Their Rolls are also quite popular among regulars.¬†

Apart from the main course, they also serves delicious Lassis. Kulfi used to be my favorite here as well, though I am unsure if they still serve the latter till date. Do come here, if you are opting for a quick bite, but do not expect anything grandeur in nature! :-)

RDBD has acquired a cult status, pulling in all the late night crowds of salt lake city ! It's located within sector V. Reaching there shouldn't be a problem to anyone! Iv had good experiences whenever iv been to this place. The theme of the restaurant is great and the way they have decorated the place is brilliant. The food and beverages are also pretty good with my personal favourites being the chicken lassuni kabab and the lassi.
The kababs are soft and melt the moment it touches your mouth. It's served with a mint sauce which adds to the flavour. 
The lassis/ soda sikanjis/ lime juice are arches in Small glass bottles. The lassi is thick and tasty 

Pros:
1. Tasty authentic food
2. Great decor/ ambience
3. The best place of u develop midnight craving for food !

Cons:
1. The online ordering facility is limited to a small area. Increase the radius of delivery guys !

The first thing that comes to my mind about this place is the amazing decor they have put up. It's a modern take on the age old dhaba culture. Back to basics, this place is a bit above average with the food being a tad overpriced. Location is good. The management is nice and accommodating. The garlic nun deserves a special mention. Come here if you have a large group for a better experience.

Rang de basanti is probably one of the very few joints that is open at the late hours. While the place is quite big and done up nicely, the quality of food and service needs to improve a lot. I went there with a couple of friends and we were seriously disappointed with the quality as well as the quantity of biriyani served. Pocket friendly yes, but, on the taste front, there is scope for improvement.

This place is well located in Salt Lake. 

The starters here were good! Paneer Tikka was average. Dahi Kabab and Tandoori Aloo Kabab was awesome! 

In the main course, Dal makhaani was much like tadka daal.. A very average preparation.. Chana Masala was awesome.. Paneer Do Pyaza was also good but Paneer Makhaani was a little below average.. Fried rice is really tasty over here! 

Coming towards breads, Masala Kulcha - strictly NO, Butter Naan was good and well prepared! 

We were so full by the end that we had no chance to try mocktails.

This place is not costly also.. We were 10 of us and our bill was 4000 rupees!

This was a random visit from wet-o-wild.... We were dead hungry and wanted to have 'asli-khaana'... So what would be better than a dhaba? Located right opposite to webel more signal,  the place is quite visible from a long distance because of its big yellow board.... 

The parking is a bit of a problem since it resides right on the main road... The interior is very beautiful... They have various kinds olden days framed pictures... 'Sholay ka zamana'.... That is why i guess they have ladies washroom named as Basanti and gents washroom as Gabbar... 

I started off with sweet lassi and was definitely unhappy with it since it was too watery.... I expected it to be thick and creamy but it was nowhere near to that.... After the disappointing lassi we ordered appetizer... Paneer tikka and chicken tikka.... Both were equally delicious... Paneer was soft and tender and chicken was perfectly juicy..... For main course we ordered butter nan,  jeera rice,  daal fry, chicken bharta and chicken butter masala... Daal fry was super tasty... I actually finished every bit of it.... It was that marvelous... Chicken bharta and chicken butter masala both complemented really well with butter nan.. It was totally amazing... One should give this a try if you are a non-vegetarian... 

Service was very quick and extremely humble and polite... We asked for the food at the earliest and they actually delivered it before time... Hats off to the team!!!  Keep up the good service....

What I loved the most was Chicken Bharta and chaach. It reminded me of pure North Indian food. Even the dal tadka was so tasteful. This place was like the Kickstart of my day and being a foodie I owe this place a second visit.

After a long wait I finally paid a visit to this place. Patiala chicken tikka kebab was a blast of flavors. Nimbu pani was a relief from Kolkata heat. Then I ordered butter naan and Ludhiana chicken butter masala. It had a taste of coconut which did not quite suite my pallet. Apart the interiors were good and it was a pocket friendly experience.

Decent joint. Cheap, matter of fact stuff focussed on service and tasty food with no frills attached. Try keema pulao, their mutton specialities like rara or Kashmiri korma. Do try the Chans. and look around and enjoy the retro Bollywood meets jaathland posters and photos all around you. And yeah, it's real easy on your pocket. Try to eat here once, the place will grow on you.

So another one of those wannabe North Indian (read Punjabi Cuisine) restaurants in Kolkata.  Decor wise they have got it right giving it a dhaba feel,  coloured wooden table-chairs,  old ad snippets et al.  The menu also seems to have been given a lot of thought,  good mix for both veg and non-vegetarian eaters.  The lemon soda was "banta" like,  the dhai kebab,  except the dhai oozing out was almost there (however at a price of INR 200+ for 4 pieces,  it just priced itself next to a Delhi fine dine) and the Naan and Kulcha were fairly nice.  The kadhai paneer  had the right ingredients and taste.  However the kadhai chicken failed,  was strangely sweet and lacked taste.  The Raita with the Biryani (which by the way had to be bought separately) was not Biryani Raita and the Biryani was more like spicy pula sans flavours.  

My other gripe is they do not provide any salad with the meals (even vinegar onion has to be bought),  no Indian chutney and no pickle.  That is not dhaba style my friend. 

They need to get the pricing and some basics right and can have a lot going for them. And yes,  don't forget to serve saunf in the end.

The restaurant stays true to its character and screams Punjabbb all over the place. As you enter the place, you see a tractor, yes a freakin TRACTOR!!

Brrrrruuuaahhh!

The ambience is dhaba-ish ofcourse, with posters from 1960's. There's one we were laughing about; it was a poster of young Vinod Khanna advertising for Cinthol! Gabbar Singh, Basanti, Jay, Veeru and the entire Sholay cast is up on their walls. üòù

If you go here, you must start with Tandoori Chicken. It's one of the best in this side of our country. Finger licking good.

Main course, stick to recommendations of the awesome staff, they are busy but happy helpers. Butter chicken, Chicken tikka masala & Kadhai chicken are quite good.

My entourage also liked the 'Thanda Cola' which is again a Rang de Basanti specialty. Although I didn't like it, but you might. It's basically coke mixed with jaljeera.

The bill will be easy on your wallet. A realistic estimate would be 300-350 per head for a sumptuous dinner.

And while leaving, make sure you check out with a fantastic paan from the tapri just outside.

Taste wise, the food here is exceptionally delicious. Not commenting much on the entr√©es since they are inevitably good! We tried a couple of dishes of our own choice like nimbu mirch mutton, mutton boti kebab, kolkata chicken biryani, delhi ka butter chicken and rumaali roti. All of which were finger licking good.
Every time I visit this place, instead of going for kebabs I go for the chicken roll with extra cheese crumbs for starters. Also I think an entire cheese chicken roll might be a bit too heavy for a single person, which is why it is better consumed one by two, that is half! For instance, for 6 people with a regular appetite,having an intention to go for a wholesome main course, the ideal decision would be ordering 3 chicken cheese rolls for starters and dividing equally among all. The staff will neatly cut each roll into two halves and serve it, if requested. It is one of the most innovative and by far the best starter to begin with. The extra dab of cheese just adds to the delight! The delhi ka butter chicken has a rich and savory gravy that goes basically with everything! Could be any kind of Indian rice or roti. Service, though I believe, should be slightly faster! And they must solve the issue regarding the parking space!
Overall great food, great experience!

We checked in today for a quick lunch. There is a huge tractor to greet you first up! They have tried their best to provide a dhaba-like ambience from the wooden chairs to the wall decors. Coming to the food, we ordered Chicken Malai Kebab, Garlic Naan & Kashmiri Mutton Roganjosh. They did take around 25 mins to bring the food but it was smoking hot so no complaints! :) I liked all the items .. Both the mutton & chicken were soft,tender & really well cooked. The waiters are cordial & their service is up to the mark. I was tad disappointed with the Roganjosh because my taste buds didn't detect anything special compared to a normal Mutton grevy preparation .. Hence the deduction of 0.5 points :p
Oh .. Per head cost came around 350 bucks so its value for money in my opinion!

This is mainly a Bollywood themed restaurant where Hindi movie posters and ads from the 90s have been used to decorate the walls.

The food is light too so u can enjoy to your content. Also the lassi is served in served in a milk bottle which is really unique. Do try it out üëç

This place is situated just beside my office and thus an easy option whenever I crave for some outside food. The kebabs are just perfectly cooked - soft tender and juicy. North indian dishes served are also good but dare not opt for the biriyani served here..you will be disappointed. But going by the word 'dhaba' along with its name, this outlet lacks the taste of the typical mouth-watering dhaba food. The roll corner is also good and the service is pretty fast.

Their Masala-cola bottle shape glass is full of fun and masti. Nice place in salt lake Bengal for Punjabi food. Must visit. 

Only one thing I didn't like is their sitting which need improvement (soft cushion base) & yes they are charging 50/- for Onion plate since I'm being Ahmedabadian here Onion slices are FOC. Anyways thats it. Must visit place .....

The place is not too good for a quiet dinner. Very loud as frequented by youngsters who aren't very classy. The food is okayish, paneer kadai was very dry and not so spicy, naan and roti were very dry and rubbery too. Chaas we ordered was very sour. Fresh lime soda however was perfect.

I think it's a hit and miss place. Sometimes you would love it and sometimes not so much.

Deduct 2 stars each for ambience, service (not too great) and inconsistent quality of food

Located at college more , beside Hyundai showroom, it is a true blue Punjabi food joint . 
The place is spacious and has enough staff to address the peak time rush, which is actually very essential. 
I went there for lunch with my parents on republic day and was very pleased with the experience.
Coming to the food , we ordered dahi kabab for starters ; kadhai paneer, Punjabi di dal makhani, tandoori roti and lachha paratha for the main course.
‚Ä¢ Dahi kabab: Soft kebabs filled inside with frozen Dahi which just melts in your mouth. Given a chance I can eat at least 20 of them at a go :P. Do try this !
‚Ä¢ Dal makhani: The flagship dish of Punjabi cuisine, it is one thing that vegetarians generally order and thus it becomes necessary to keep it up to the mark. And it was indeed perfect. Adequately spicy and that essential velvety texture. üëç
‚Ä¢ Kadhai paneer was decent. Could have been better , a bit more spicy I guess.
‚Ä¢ Lachha paratha and tandoori roti were crisp and tasty. 
The servic was brisk and the staff,polite.
Amazing food at comparatively reasonable rates üëç 
Definitely going to visit it again.

I have been to this place a number of times, and have always been quite satisfied with the spicy North Indian food served at this place. A modernised air-conditioned dhaba with a tractor at the entrance and milkman cans all around gives it a decent ambience. I personally liked the desi masala chaach, Hari mirch ki roti, Punjab da Dal makhani and Paneer Tawa Khurchan served here. The only concern I find is - this place needs to work a little on the service.

After my visit (lunch) there in March 2014. I visited there twice, both after watching night shows at RDB. Boy üë≤I was in for a surprise!!!! 
It felt like the restuarent had come to life. 
Buzzing with people and improved service. 
Food was cooked better and served with hot fluffy tandoori roti's. 
We ordered:
Murg malai tikka and Delhi 6 tandoori chk. Both were awesome, but lighter on the gravy side. 
Along with that we also had the panner tikka butter masala, for my veg only friend üòú

Overall, I guess you should visit here for dinner (late dinner), to get the real feel.......

This place was in my wishlist for a long time before I nailed it this winter. This is located at a 5 min walking distance from College More at Sector-V. This place creates an ambience like that of an authentic Punjabi Dhaba. Foods are served in Steel plates. We tried roti and Chicken Side dishes. Food is good but a little bit expensive.

As per the name suggests one might expect a perfect Punjabi cuisine here. Unfortunately the don't serve the signature dish Makai ki roti and Sarson ka saag. Otherwise the food quality is better than average. Service is slow and clumsy. Only thing which worth mention is the ambience. It is really really good. The wall paintings, cartoons, the lights all are very beautiful. Oh, how can I forget the tractor ( yes you heard right) just inside the door.

So just for no reason we landed up to Rang de Basanti Salt lake sector 5.
The ambiance is not as expected...quite clumsy and simple. The whole Kolkata IT crowd gathers there all the time.
We didn't feel like having food sitting there..so we ordered for parcel.
Food is pretty good... Like the Biriyani and nun and a simple Punjabi chicken curry..
Not fit for special occasions or celebrations.
But OK for daily lunch or dinner

This is a decent place to have good Punjabi food at a decent price, the ambience is nice, it gives a feel that you're sitting in a dhaba, but the service at times is bad; sometimes the staff seems clueless. I personally love their "Delhi ka dabba butter chicken" and hope they will improve some of their shortcomings.

Food was tasty
Butter chicken has its own beauty when served with lachaa paratha.
A half plate of butter chicken has 4 big pcs. Enough for 2 people. As I was alone it was a bit too much.
One thing which I hate was the taste of lassi.
It's a punjabi theme based restaurant so lassi is must. I have tasted lassi but it was not up to mark as compared to CCD in Bangalore.

This place was previously an outlet of azad hind dhaba that was pretty average but the new franchise is way better and food is pretty consistent. 

My experience here is generally for a home delivery and service is prompt. Aloo , Dahi kebab are must haves. Aloo do piaza and dal tadka are delightful along with mirchi ki roti.

Overall great food at very pocket friendly prices.

I had a home delivery done. It was delivered with 12 minutes of my order, which clearly stated the food wasn't freshly cooked. We ordered dilli ka butter chicken, dal makhani, garlic naan and rumali roti.. While the chicken, daal and rumali roti were ok, the garlic naan was the worst I have ever had. We just left it off as it was all dipped in extreme oil, chewy and plain bad.

I kid thee not when I say that you feel like an absolute child when you walk into this place. The decor is sooooo cute and the posters used to decorate the place are BRILLIANT! As for the food, if you're looking for some authentic Punjabi food, then this is definitely a restaurant that I would suggest trying out. This place gives restaurants such as Azad Hind a run for their money. We ordered quite a few dishes whose names I can't remember at the moment, hahaha. But, the fact that the entire table was so creepily silent after the food was served made me realize just how amazing g their food is. The only thing that I was disappointed with was the Gajar ka Halwa. It wasn't as amazing as the previous time when I had eaten here. But besides that, this place did not let down. So now, keep calm and eat naan.

The theme of this restaurant is something that is sure to catch anyone's attention. From the name, its quite perceivable that its a purely indian food joint exuding flavours of Punjab.
But as you step inside, the seating arrangement, the ambience and specially the big tractor placed inside the restaurant is sure to give you a pure vibe of a dhaba of Punjab.
The food served is pretty good, and its an excellent place to check in for lunch or dinner, be it with friends or family. Not only for the food but also for the entire theme, which is impressive and innovative as well.
And off course, the labelling of the washrooms for ladies and gents is sure to remind you of the legendary film "SHOLAY".

Visited this place today for Lunch with Friends.

A symbolic Tractor at Entrance is just something different I found in their Ambience. They have tried to make a restaurant with a Dhaba look, But it remains a Restaurant. 

It was almost empty around 1:30 p.m. on Sunday.

In a Punjaabi theme Dhaba, Lassi is the First thing that comes in and so we ordered one. But the salted Lassi was completely disappointing with too much Salt in it. Had to get it corrected.

Coming to food:

We ordered dahi ke kebab for Starters. It was ok. Basically Tikkis stuffed with ample Dahi.

Mix veg, Aloo do pyaza, Kashmiri Aloo Dum, Dal tadka with Butter Naan, Makki Roti, Tandoori Roti in Mains.

Mix veg was dry base and good. You could at least know what's in their unlike at other places where you have to guess, what am I having. But had too many small green chillies in it. Not all in the group were comfortable with it.

Aloo do pyaza was ok and kashmiri Aloo dum tasted similar to Aloo do Pyaza. Only Difference being the first was dry, second had Gravy.

Breads were fine. 

Service was ok.

Overall, The meal was ok.

Visited this place for lunch on Christmas eve. We were one of the early guests, so got to select nice seats but later on it got really got crowded.
1.ambience - typical artificial dhaba ambience. Punjabi dialogues , wooden chairs and tables,lanterns. The place was spacious. There was an outside counter for takeaways. The days special menu was mentioned in the tables.
2.Hospitality - the staff's were courteous and served us well. They kept a keen eye in our needs. But at the end goofed up our bill. They replaced a chicken item with a fish item which had increased our bill amount by rs150.so please check ur Bill carefully. On pointing out their mistake, they promptly corrected it.
3.Food - food was excellent as per the price. We ordered the following:
Chicken kasturi kebab- it was that day's special menu and it was really special. The chicken was very soft and the spices penetrated to its core. Very tasty.
Tandoori nun - the usual stuff
Dilli ki butter chicken - it is their trademark dish and the curry tasted really great
Sweet lime soda - loved the containers in which this was served
Overall a nice experience except the bill part

Location,right at salt lake sector V,college more,where previously Azad Hind dhaba used to be. Ambience is good,spacious,with film posters with quirky one liners on the wall and complete with a tractor near the entrance.

Coming straight to the food,which can make or break a restaurant:it was really good.our order was simple,since it was a festive day and the restaurant was full,chicken biryani,keema matar,butter nan and delhi ka butter chicken.

Biryani was light and a little underwhelming,ut the other dishes were perfect.the butter chicken was bit on the sweeter side,but that made it even more special. quantity of each side dish was more than sufficient for two.

The part which seriously needs improvement is the service.we had to wait for 15 mins trying to attract the attention of the waiters for the tables to be cleaned,another 15 mins for a glass of water.the wait for food was about 40 mins.though there were many of them,all of them hovered around the kitchen instead of attending the tables.I deducted 0.5 marks for this.

Will visit again for food and I think I will opt for takeaway.

Same place used to be Azah Hind Dhaba and it was taken over by Rang De Basanti.

The look and feel inside is quite like hinterland of Punjab with a real life Tractor inside the dhaba and charpai but still food is more Moghul dishes.

I have been to this place 2-3 times. Food was good.¬†
Recently, We had Chicken Bharta which has shredded chicken. It was good.
Butter naan was as usual.¬†

There is room for great improvement in service.¬†

Overall a decent place to have lunch outside your office as it is situated in heart of Sector V which houses IT sector companies.

A nice dramatic,desi themed eatery which instantly pepped up my mood.The interior is innovative with ad cutouts and quirky quotes framed on the wall.The big tractor near the entrance gave me a true highway roadside dhaba feeling.
I ordered masala kulcha and Punjabi Kali mirch chicken for my lunch.The food was piping hot and the blend of masala in the food made my taste buds happy. :)
But the food quantity was really less than the prices charged.The waiters are very sluggish.They forgot to serve water and when i reminded them,they just served the water in a jug and they forgot about the glasses.

Have been there five times already coz this is near my office and trust me I have completely satisfied each time I have been here. The moment you enter you get a feel of the Punjab, with a huge tractor in front, beautifully decorated (do click pics). And then you can comfort yourself at one of the abundant tables (no cushions though) of your choice. There is style in everything be it the awesome interiors (all gaddi related stuff) or the menu (with some taglines) or the glass pot they serve your liquids in... The food is awesomely tasty with lots of options (I have not tried all but the spicy ones only) and at a reasonable price. And yes you can order some little variations too in dishes (i ask to add chopped green chillies to make dishes spicier) and they will take care of it.
Luv to be here. Best of lukk RDB...!!!

Nice dhaba style restaurant which won my heart.

‚òÖ LOCATION : (4/5) It is located just opposite IEM college in College more and beside IBM sector v

‚òÖ AMBIANCE :(3.5/5) ¬†It has a feel of panjabi dhaba. with wooden chairs, steel plates and huge steel glasses of water, lamshades made of paint bucket, filmy posters and the main attraction a tractor.

‚òÖ FOOD :(4/5) ¬†We ordered 1 Chicken Biriyani, 1 Dilli ka butter chicken(boneless half plate) , 1 Onion salad.
Biriyani was moderate. Chicken was a leg piece, potato was nicely cooked. I felt quantity of rice is little less.
Butter chicken was yummy. Huge portion of gravy with 8-10 small chicken piece(much smaller than kabab piece). Very tasteful. Quantity is enough for 2 of us.

‚òÖ PRICES :(3.5/5) ¬†The prices are moderate.our bill was around 550.

‚òÖ SERVICE : (4/5) Prompt service and helpful

Overall the experience was nice. Will visit to try more of the items :)

There are Dhaba serving good food and there are ones that serve great food. Well this is the one.

Absolute cracker of dishes these guys serve. We ordered Peeli Daal Tadka, Mutton Raara and Chicken Bharta with Masala Chaach and Roti.

The peeli daal was to die for. Best chicken tadka in a long time. Shredded chicken with a delicious gravy.¬†

The star item was "Mutton Raara". It has to be the best mutton dish in town. You need to taste it to know it.

Overall a superb experience.

Writing this review after a couple of visits to this restaurant! 
Lovely interior, open till late night, ample of parking space(on the road), located just at the crossing of IEM in Sector 5! But all these doesn't attract foodies! Food and service does! Food is good, better than many such dhaba in the town. But it's excessively spicy! Don't blame the Punjabi cuisine, RDB just happily uses spices to make dishes look beautiful! So if u love spicy food this is where u must visit! Service is seriously very poor and the most worst part of the restaurant! It's not that they lack people, but maximum are either reluctant to work or exhausted! Taking a parcel from here is like complex than a doing a coding in Java! 
With the increase in quality of service they can always be one of the top late night hangout place in the city!

Been here quiet Alot of time before,but today I visited here maybe after 5 months and it's a disgrace to see this place go down in such a short period of time. We were three of us and the Stuart who came to take the order was absolutely inexperienced and so were few other staff. A senior came n took our order, after we ordered the food I asked a staff if I could get the Wi-Fi password but I was shocked when he said a no straight on my face. Now coming to the food we ordered dahi kebab which to my astonishment I found the outer layer has become thicker followed by our Main course  which took another 15 mins. Being so hungry , when my romali Roti was served I was amazed to feel my Roti cold I sent it back n this time it  came warm but there was a weird smell on it. The aloo Gobi and chicken reshmi butter masala was good. While eating we ordered for mix salad n we told the server to make sure the salad is mixed with chaat masala before they  serve us but it wasn't done. I preferred the old staff they were more quick n reliable. I would suggest that they pick up their sock.

The place is spacious and is always crowded. The food is good. We tried tandoori aalu, paneer tikka and bhutta ka kebab. Paneer was a bit hard but was appealing in taste. For main course we tried alu matar, paneer kadhai, dal makhani, dal tadka, garlic naan, tandoori roti and masala kulcha. The food is undoubtedly good and resonable. A visit is surely recommended.

The most horrible experiences I've ever had lifetime. At work we'd ordered dinner. It was approx. 12 colleagues ordering different items. In other words people ordered what they¬†wanted to have.¬†While placing the order I'd requested them to kindly deliver the food¬†at¬†9:00 PM. I received a call from the delivery boy at 8:00 pm asking if he could deliver the food in the next¬†20 mins. I declined stating the order was agreed to be delivered¬†at 9:00 PM¬†by the restaurant staff taking the order over the phone. So the guy said he would deliver it at 9:00. The food was delivered at 9:30 PM. 30 mins late. Worse part of the story was when we opened the parcels we could not make out which container contained which order. We could not identify the meat type, the chapatti type or for that matter even the vegetables. Most of us ended up having what we did not order. I am surprised how on earth an enterprise like Rang De Basanti cannot afford a permanent marker which can help them write the item name on the container containing? A permanent marker would not cost anything more than Rs 160 which would write atleast nothing less than 100 boxes. I am not sure whether these people are over confident about the service delivery or they are just not bothered about the market.HORRIBLE! I shall never order food from here.

Went there with my office colleagues for a office party on Diwali.
The ambience is awesome and gives u a desi feel.
We ordered keema rice, mutton Rogan josh and tandoori.
The was served 45 minutes later which is a bit annoying but then the taste of the food made for the Tim loss.
Keema rice was full of mutton keema in correct proportions and the mutton rogan josh was awesome.
All in all it was an awesome Diwali at RDBD!!

We visited this place late at night, around 11. But this place was still hustling and bustling. We ordered dahi ke kebab, paneer tikka and haryali chicken for starters. The dahi ke kebab was amazing, a little different though.
For main course we ordered dal makhni, and burji and some mixed veg. The food was really nice. We also ordered some rotis and hari mirchi roti and garlic nan. Everything was good.

It was well smoked and cooked just giving you the flavour of smoke as you munch in. Softness and the gravy added to its exoticness. Panner was also awesome. And the tandoori roti was well baked. All my friends enjoyed the lunch it was awesome.

After pandal hopping on Asthami we were hungry and tired. So after checking zomato we decided to drop in at this Dhaba to experience North Indian Cuisine. When you enter you'll see a Tractor on the left and the dhaba is decorated with Wheels, Utensils, Funny Quotes in frame. The utensils they serve are also typically Dhaba Style, i.e. long heavy glasses, huge circumference plates, etc. We started with Tandoori Chicken which was soft, tasted amazing and very delicious. Then we had Butter Nan with Chicken Tikka Butter Masala and Dal makhani which were quite good. Monetary wise its moderate. Overall nice good place and nice food.

This was one of my fav restaurant until I went there in the day of panchomi this durga puja. We ordered tandoori chicken, mutton biriyani, butter & plain nun and two chicken items in side dish. The biriyani was so bad I can't express in words. It was just like over boiled yellow rice. After eating so tasteless food we were shocked seeing the bill amount. They charged 55/- for a 20rs mineral water. The ambiance and service is good. According to me you should order tandoori dishes but never order biriyani there.

Staff was warm. Pocket pinch was on the higher side due to our visit during the festive time.

I expected a good dhaba style north Indian food  but was completely disappointed. 
Firstly...  They don't provide complimentary onion,  achar,  etc..  "Dhaba without Onions.!".   Place was full and hence very loud....  It was not at all comfortable. 
Food was very ordinary...  Tandoori Rotis were made of Maida...   Overall it was disappointing and a bad choice.   Will never revisit.

This place was a pleasant surprise to us. It's located just down the road from Bandhan Bank office in Saltlake Sector-5 main road, and offers a great environment to chill out. The tractor just inside the gate, and other wall posters from vintage Indian TV add to the feel of a Punjab countryside. We ordered Chicken Lassuni, Mutton Boti Din Raat, Egg chicken roll and Kulfi Falooda, and the former two items were just heavenly. Don't miss out on this yummy place.

The chicken Biriyani is good but the quantity is not  something i can say much about, Chicken Tandoori is the grace which saves this place quite frankly I've not eaten tandoori like this in long time, Butter chicken masala is another safe bet coupled with tandoori roti,the waiter suggested to try the kadai chicken but i found it tooo spicy for my pallette, bhayankar thanda is average beverage at most, the desserts don't impress at all.All in all decent place

Previous location of Azad Hind dhaba this is located just near college More HDFC bank. They offer north indian and punjabi food with awesome taste. Some items worth mentioning are mutton rogan josh, dahi ke kabab-best in kolkata, murg achari tikka, kadhai chicken. I simply loved these. Biriyani is not so good, at times very sticky rice & overcooked. The restaurant gets very crowded very fast and the service takes a lot of time of u go in a big group. Serving time is a big drawback here food is good.

I've been to so many different restaurants in my life. Surprisingly, the one kind which went missing was a 'dhaba' experience. Finally got my chance to visit RDBD yesterday, and came out with a memorable affair (which, I think, could've been excellent if not for a glitch or two).

Saturday lunch with my team of 3 people, and got a table straightaway. One of my colleagues stated that this was possible only 'coz it's a Saturday. Or else, you would've had to stand outside for our turn.

Anyway, the ambiance is good. The place has its modern-day 'dhaba' feel, with truck tires decorating the walls and oil cans hanging upside down as lamps. Ordered the favorites over here: Murgh Malai Tikka, Garlic Nun and Mutton Rarra.

Mind you, the quality of the food was excellent. Each and every item was fresh and tasted delicious... especially the Mutton Rarra. The gastronomic urges were so tempted with the look, smell and taste of the dishes that I ate more than I could take. Full marks on this ground.

However, the place is a tad bit overpriced considering the quantity they serve. A small bowl of Rarra masala is not enough for three people, oddly though there are three mutton pieces inside. Priced at nearly 300 bucks, the pieces were more bone than meat. Maybe you were the unfortunate ones and other customers might be luckier with their portions, but this wasn't something I would want from a well-renowned Sector 5 joint. I don't mind emptying my wallet, but the serving should back up the price too.

The staff members were prompt and courteous. So that's a plus point. In all, a decent place to go in a group. Would love to come back someday and try out their Dilli ki Butter Chicken and Lassi. And I hope that it'll be a better affair with RDBD that time.

Till then, its 3.5 from my side.

Fresh food, with limited choices and crisp!! Tandoori Chicken is YUMM...the inly thing which I faced consistently was cold water/beverages....which I think promoters of this place will look into soon. Happy Partying Late Nighters....and Happy Eating at RDBD !!

The name attracted me. Me and my family was damm hungry and we were looking for some decent restaurant in sector v then I came across to this place on zomato. I thought of giving a try. It is a good family restaurant with tasty and lip smacking food. We had veg, which was really nice and it was tasting like proper dhaba food. On top of it the ambiance is really attractive. U will find all old ads of 1970's in photo frame, they have used tyres and village style utensil to do the interior. The best part is the tractor when u enter on right side. Service is good. Prices wise reasonable. I will suggest to give it a try.

Either I sit inside the dhaba or take the food in the car..food will be finger licking only.

Be it paneer tikka,tandoori alu,naan,kulcha,dal makhni,sabjis,fresh lime..etc etc..nothing ever will make you sad.

Aha nothing like a place as it is. Entering you will get to see a big tractor. And on the walls u will find all the old add campaign which I have seen in my old days in dordarsha. Well about the food both veg and non veg are mouth watering and gives a suffient quantity for 2. We orders aloo jeera , butter nun, roomali roti , masala kulcha,  stuffed mashrom,  hariwali kabab and chicken butter masala. Well aftr a nice food out side u will find a pan shop and aftr having a pan u will find that u had a nice outing. Well the plus point is that even at nght u can park your car outside the dhaba and have ur food at ur own car. And one thing to suggest if with out table chairs if they had brought some place with kha titas like outside dhaba then it would have been a place to be to enjoy the ambience.....

The ambience was amazing. Service was amazing. The drinks were very good specially rang de cola. The naan was perfectly made. Paneer and chola were both spot on. Dal makhani was good. Could've been a bit more spicey. Very impressed. Definitely recommending to others :)

A nice place to have authentic Punjabi food. Dal makhani and kulcha is irresistible. Tandoori alu and rolls are a must eat with soda shikanji. Have lost a count of no of times have visited this place. Must try for food lovers.

The place does offers a environment to that of a dhaba. A tractor is placed as soon as you enter. Food was kinda average. Though the Reshmi Kebabs were great but I didn't quite liked the Biriyani and Chicken Bharta. Service is kinda okay but water was dropping continuously due to AC leakage. Certainly not the place if you want to hangout but one can plan for occasional team lunch or dinner after office due to it's prime location is College More, Sec V.

I had Chicken Do Pyaza and Tandoori Roti at RDBD.

Food: Quality is superb. (4/5)

Service: Well, I am bit disappointed with the service. We sited on a table where we found that water is leaking for AC, then had to change our table. (2/5)

Washroom: Very Bad (1/5)

Decoration: Good, in fact very good. The Mahindra tractor will definitely impress you. (4/5)

Overall Experience: Good, food is good, if you are a foodie then you should definitely go there, but if you want to hangout with your friends, family or date, then I would recommend you to not go there.

This is my first visit to Rang de basanti and they have convinced me enough to revisit the place again. It was saturday afternoon and in office break, we three went there to try their finest delicacy in the name dilli ka butter chicken. We tried kadai chicken and butter nun adding with first one. First thing that I noticed that their preparations are sharply different in taste. First dish that I mentioned is mouth watering and kadai chicken would not far behind. Both these dishes are having thick gravy. Even the butter nun also require special mention. 
The resturant is placed in prime location near college more. Ambience is extremely different than any other outlet offering in Kolkata city. Interior is superb and fantastically lighted. Service is quick and best of all, they prepare your food after your order and they serve it hot. For me, it's a must visit one.

The decor gives you a feeling of Punjab. Loved the ambience of Rang de Basanti Dhaba, Sector-v. Food was good. It's pocket friendly. Being vegetarian, was little difficult to adjust. Service was satisfactory. The place has a punjab feel to it. If you just enter The dhaba, on your left side there is a big tractor kept. We had ordered bhutta Ka seek and tandoori aloo in starters, aloo do Pyaza, rumali roti and peeli Dal with tadka in main course, rang de cola, lassi, and desi nimbu pani in beverages.

Came across this gem of a place by zomato only so Thanks for that. I went there once and have gone there a number of times now. The food be it non-veg or veg is really good. With a novelty ambience (the posters, the tractor and the lighting etc) this place has great butter chicken, stuffed mushroom, dahi kebab, alu gobhi, kurkuri bhindi(a must try) and nearly everything. The only place to improve is their service time. Otherwise great, must visit for great north indian food !!!!

Tonight's dinner was our (my wife Jaya and I) first visit to Rang De Basanti. The decor and ambience were nice and service satisfactory. We tried Punjabi Chicken Kali Mirch. The gravy was good but the flavor had not penetrated the chicken. This gave us an impression that the same precooked chicken is put into different gravies to make different dishes. Not the hallmark of a good eatery. 

Lachcha Paratha and Tandoori Roti were nice but Rumaali Roti was very ordinary. Sweet Lassi was good. 

On the whole, an average experience.

Dropped in to celebrate a  birthday dinner. To be honest wasn‚Äôt expecting the place to be filled with families in such late hour. The place , ambience is indeed one where you can take your family & friends .

There is a tractor placed inside and vibe is very Punjabi and traditional. Anyways coming to the main area of focus- food!! We had ordered for butter naans, chicken bharta and the butter chicken masala. Coming to the naans, they were well done, buttery and soft. The chicken bharta was good and tasty. I preferred the bharta  than the butter chicken. To be honest we had ordered dishes that are safe to eat and therefore don‚Äôt have much to write as there was nothing unsual or innovative.  But yes you can always go for their lassi which was refreshing and tasty after all this butter overload.

Overall nice place, clean, staffs are ok but little inattentive and slow. Price is competitive and the place is open till 1 am. So you could always go in here after a party and have a good meal.

Aesthetically it is all what it promises to be, a typical road side style dhaba which one would encounter while on a road trip. The picture is complete with the truck at the entry, the quaint old-style commercial posters (Sr Bacchhan endorsing a beedi brand and Vinod Khanna endorsing Cinthol being the best of the lot).

When it comes to food it doesnt disappoint but it doesnt wow either...im a little uneasy sitting on the fence while writing about the food at RDB (famously as its called). The first time i came here it was fabulous, the second time it was good, the third time its just about ok. Somehow the food is bland where its supposed to be spicy and excessively spicy with green chillies in other places. The service is slow, the food takes a hell lot of time to arrive. But its the waiting time at Rang De Basanti which is enough to put you off at this joint, and God help you if its a weekend!

A little more organisation at the gate with less waiting might just help but they need to up the ante with the food. All in all, its just OK. My rating - Can Eat.

Great food..... Butter chicken was awesome....  But delivery service needs serious improvement... Very little co-ordination within different service unit within the restaurant...our order was delivered after 2 hrs...that too cold drinks was not delivered. Rain was surely a reason but mis-communication kept happening from restaurant side . In case RDB management gives some importance to customer feedback, request you to improve you delivery service.

After waiting 45 minutes to get in the restaurant, had to wait for another 45 minutes before meals were served. Services are extremely pathetic with no one taking care of anything. After all this struggle, food turns out to be compleyely tasteless left is wondering why there was so much rush in first place. In the end, waiter added things in the bill which he had not even served. Make a sandwich at home rather than ruining your evening here.

Had been visiting three times due to office colleagues recommendation. But they go for dal tarka and paneer items. But nonveg items are not so good. Tried chicken biriyani. ..will say no to that forever. Tried chicken tikka butter masala. ..more masala gravy than chicken pieces and too spicy. About kebabs. ..harabhara kabab is good but never try the achari chicken kabab. .its so pathetically bad in taste. Too salty. And the chicken are dry means either not properly marinated or are basi. One more thing its just a dhaba but cost is little bit higher than expected.

Well, been here for a good food anticipating the Punjabi tinge. And they proved me right as they have a big Mahindra tractor just at the entrance. Theme is very good and can strike nostalgia by the ads they have on the walls of products that lasted ages. Very simple seating arrangement with decent table and chairs. Bronze thalis and other cutleries were quite good *and heavy as well*. A light note of music was playing which nobody can hear because of people talking and chatting on high notes. We went there on 18th July 15 (Celebration of Eid was ON) and the restaurant was almost full. We ordered for Patiala Chicken and Vegetable Korma along with butter naan and butter roti and a Sweet lime water to start with. Well, after 45 minutes the waiter came and served half the order apologising that they do not have Korma. Seeing no other option, we asked him to serve whatever possible in least time. So he bought Butter Paneer masala which was about to be served to another table!! The food quality was average, naam was good but roti didn't live up to the mark. I mean how can a person spoil a roti!! When we asked him to bring the bill he started cleaning and kept the bill on the table like a file in any government office with no interest to explain. We paid our bill of roughly Rs. 800 and started getting off the exit. Just at that instance, another table of 8 people faced the same issue and their story is that they got all the vegetables served but were waiting for roti / naan from last half an hour. We expected better from a dhaba with such name. Alas, 2.5* from my side..!

I remember this place to be Azad Hind Dhaba, now it‚Äôs Rang De Basanti Dhaba. Only a change in name, no change in food quality and quantity whatsoever.  Seating arrangement is quite simple but the d√©cor is unique. There‚Äôs a huge tractor just at the entrance. We were two hungry souls and thus ordered a Dilli ka Butter Chicken (8 Pcs), Laal Mirch ka Paratha, Aloo Kulcha and Masala Kulcha. Service was moderate. The food tasted really good especially the masala kulcha and the butter chicken. Not at all on the expensive side. Pocket Pinch: 700 for two.

One can easily be mesmerized by their flamboyant interior decor with some humourous posters on the wall. Seating capacity is huge. Even they have a few seats outside of the restaurant for the waiting people. We went there for a project lunch and found their service awful. After two reminders they served food after 45 minutes of taking orders. Food was tasty with a good quantity too. One suggestion, its better not to try rice items there.. try some of their unique paratha recipes..

This is my first review and I so wished it be good but to my sheer disappointment this place didn't leave me with much choice.
My Ordeal:
Date 10 Jul called up the joint at 8 PM placed an order regular veg stuff
At 9 called back to check the status was informed delivery boy has left and would be there at my place soon which happened to be 2 km from the joint.
Suddenly @ 9:30 I realised where is my order called back and was told they would get back to me in 5 minutes, I waited.
No call so I called back again at 9:45.. again was told looking into it as if some high level enquiry was required to figure out where the little food parcel is...
No progress till 10 again called again was told food would reach in 5 mins again missed the time line. ..
At 10:30 again called to check as to what happened again same response looking into it and would be there soon mind you the distance between the two places is 2 km. .
Finally @ 10:40  by God's grace the parcel arrived and I thought I am not going to pay for the level of harassment I was subjected to... I opened the door and figured out a young boy in front of my door holding the parcel..
I asked him young man when did you actually leave from the joint and he told me Sir just 5 mins back which was justified as the food was still warm... I called up the joint asking them so was I being fooled around since 9 coz the food was out for delivery since 9.. got no answers as to wht had transpired...
I kept the call looked at the boy at my door and just felt it's not his mistake and if I with old the payment he might suffer... so I decided for my good conscience I can not do this and duly made the payment along with the tip...
Now just to simplify the whole process it's about taking order, processing the same, getting it packed and having it dispatched.. It is not a complicated process of designing a work flow for high end manufacturing firm even they remain on time even after great degree of external forces hampering progress..
One should realise it's the service business and in it quality of product and service is the mantra along with truthfulness be true give correct updates as people will understand obvious bottlenecks but just for the sake of keeping a corporate kind of outlook don't just keep dishing out jagrans like "We are looking into it and we would get back soon"
Maybe someday customers too might treat you the same way... "we would think about it and get back to you if we feel so"
Apologies for such a long post but wished to put forth my ordeal so the joint if they wish to can improve and other fellow kolkatans can take a cue and decide accordingly.... Rating 0

Located in Salt Lake Sector V, just at a distance of 2 km from Nicco Park and near Aliah University... Well Coming to the dhaba interior... the ambience of this place is ok types...the seating arrangement is quite spacious... the waiters are alert all the time,they do as said...they are not much educated but tries their best to speak in english (y). The prices are more or less fine.
 I went with my friend just for a little meal so i ordered one Tandoori Chicken [ it was well grilled, soft and juicy from inside,but still not satisfied as i expected it to be according to its price] served with pudina and curd sauce [ was ok typs], Butter Nan [ it was light and well cooked, simply the best nan I hav had for years] and Chicken Kadhai [ thought of experimenting before ordering this as it ws my first tym and to my surprise i just loved it so much...the chicken pieces were upto the mark and its gravy took my vote, tomato ,onion and capsicum ws giving a khatta meetha awesome taste and well balance chilly flavor] Overall a nice experience,will love to try other item soon...!

Out of the many visits and takeaways, this quaintly popular dhaba has earned a place in our hearts as a go-to place over others in times of rush or madness or however else due to its consistent taste and dependable sureness of quality.
The Mutton Saag , kashmiri Rogan Josh, Chicken Bharta and Delhi Butter Chicken are any day one of the best in town for the price they charge.The best thing about this place is their unwavering consistency of Quality.

I hit the place today to celebrate my birthday¬†with my special one . First I wanna to tell about the ambiance and Getup . in one word it is Simple but Awesome. A big tractor was there to welcome and say hello to us.¬†Punjab da mitti yaad a gayea. It is not only unique but also innovative¬†...The staffs ¬†were very helpful and caring. Although we carried the cake from outside they arranged the total set up¬†very promptly. After all those birthday celebration I concentrate for the dinner. In the starter there was Murgh malai tikka. Just soft and delicious. A must for every foodies. In the main course there was Alu kulcha , rumali roti and Dilliwala Butter Chicken (boneless) with ¬†lots of butter and thick tasty masala.¬†¬†we conclude the meal with Masala Cold Drinks served in glass jar.According to me it is one¬†of the best Punjabi Dhaba¬† in Kolkata....

Went there few days ago. Ambience is ok. Food tastes good. These are the only good points. The service was slow and the staff seemed confused. The worst part is the hygiene factor. Ordered chiken kali mirch and found a hair strand. No use of complaining as we had already finished our meal. Service and hygiene should be improved. Otherwise food tastes good. Oh yes, the butter nan was really nice.

Location : Sector V Near Monotel Hotel. Earlier it was used to be Azad Hind Dhaba. 

Ambience : Most Average. The owners have not spend much on the decor and ambience. It's average. Not very clean also at some places. One of the AC near rest room was having leakage problem and water was dropping continuously from that for which they had kept bucket over there. Disgusting thing to see in a restaurant. 

Service : Service was not very slow but slow. Peak time handling pressure was there on Sunday night but it's ok. This happens everywhere. Staffs are not very much trained seems like new boys. 

Food : Food was average. We ordered indian starters and food. Not high standards. Preparation was a bit oily. Breads I didn't liked at all. Especially Roomali & tandoori roti. We ordered thrice but every time it came half uncooked. They were serving everything in a hurry. This is the place where you have to maintain the taste. It was full rush that time. May be some people liked the food and place but every body has it's own perception. 

Price : Prices are not very high and lot very low also. It's in between. It's now become standard rates all over for these kinda places. People don't mind spending few extra bucks also but the need good food and good ambience.

A below average experience.

The decent footfall to this restaurant should be mainly attributed to the location, where it is situated, garlanded by IT and other government organizations. I found more BAD than GOOD, so i will start writing about cons first

CONS.

1. Taste is BAD

2. WRONG BILLING

2. Authenticity is missing

3. The quantity is JUST ok

4. Plain Onion salad, which is served as a courtesy spread, even in most famous chain is of Rs. 50 here!!!!!!...Imagine

5. be careful about the bill, they had added Rs.50 extra in my Bill, which they corrected later.

PROS:

1. Easily accessible Location

2. Good and clean ambience

Coming to Kolkata means having delicious food. Went to Range De Basanti Dhaba for a family dinner. 

Outside they have their Roll and Kebab counter. 

As we entered we saw a huge tractor which added to the Punjabi aesthetics, gave a feeling of Dhaba. We were welcomed by some of them. Chose a table for four and finally sat. The table and chair were wooden and had a typical dhaba decor with some western touch. The lanterns were milk can and kerosene can shaped. There were many posters with funny quotes and some tyres to add to the beauty. 

Menu ordered and my ratings :-

Murgh malai tikka - 5/5
Paneer tikka - 4/5
Mutton Roganjosh - 4.5/5
Butter Naan - 5/5 

Malai tikka was topped with cheese, was tasty and very juicy. Now coming to the paneer tikka, well tasted good, undoubtedly but the quality of paneer I guess they need to work on as I found out little stiff. Roganjosh was tasty good but little oily (sorry I'm a Nutritionist) and butter naan was heaven! 

Awesome experience will go again to try their lassi, roll and biryani. üòä

Although rang de basanti is one of my fav joint for north indian dishes in kolkata,today i am only giving it 3.0 as their service was very poor today.All the staff seemed lost.It was a Saturday evening no doubt and the crowd was huge but it didnt seem to me that this was the reason.They brought our order in a very short time but half of the dishes were missing.We called the waiter 2-3times but he used to just say yes and will not return with the food.They even took time to provide extra cutlery whereas i could see many plates clean and stacked up near our table.They basically seemed very lost today.All of them.I think the mgmt should look into this.I frequently visit this place atleast once a month and today was sheer disappointment.

The quantity was more dan enough..
We also ordered fresh lime whch was quiet huge as it was in a glass like heavy container whch was quiet different and enough fr two people..
So all and all we had a satisfactory experience because north indian is my favourite and so it satisfied me..

Sumptuous Indian spreads in spacious grandeur. Complete with a tractor. And you suddenly start smelling the greenery of Punjab. The heart and soul of this outlet is as big though. Try out the Tandoori Chicken and the kebabs. You will never be satisfied with one serving. The interior is one big jazzy show. A fun place to be. But just in case the server forgets to provide you with chopped lemons, a gentle nudge would work. There's a paan shop right outside the restaurant which completes the cycle for a gastronomic. 
This weekend do make RDB your destination. The dripping marination of the delicacies awaits you.

A gem of a place in sector V, the place caters to the young crowd of gen x by staying open till the wee hours of the night. It is an authentic punjabi joint with a punch. Staying close to this place i have mostly had takeaways or deliveries from here, so i can't really comment on the restaurant itself. The dishes to most definitely try out are the Tandoori chicken for starters followed by the dal makhani and the dilli da butter chicken for main course. Throw in a masala kulcha and the picture will be complete. Bon Apetit!

Yesterday night around 11.30 me n my friend visited this place. From outside it looks like a simple restaurant but as as soon as we entered the yellow walls,tractor placed infront of the gate,the tables arranged,etc gave a very punjabi feel.Ambience is good specially if you are visiting late night.
Coming to the food,we ordered masala pepsi which was yum.We ordered hariyaali kabab n another kabab(the name I forgot).Both tasted really good.Then for the main course we ordered mirch roti n chicken bharta n both were very nice,though the roti could have been better.
Overall its a nice place to visit with friends n family. :)

As my training centre was at a two mins distance from this place, we once had a typical Punjabi meal here with Lassi. Today was my second visit. Every place can be judged by it's chicken roll if they're serving one. So the chicken roll was good and a bit different to taste which was quite a surprise. If you're ever visiting sector 5 for any work do stop and eat here.

And regarding food..Kadai chicken and butter naan were unique. Proper dhaba ambience can be felt. Best in terms of looks and food quality.

This is the place where you get a proper dhaba-like feel as the interior are well designed. There is even a real tractor placed inside the dhaba to signify "punjab da shaan". Coming to food, it serves delicious dishes, mostly of which is punjabi, and all of them comes at very affordable price. Located on a busy lane where most of the offices in our city is located, this place is really a savior for late night dine-in's. And at the end of your meal, you may feel that you've over eaten but still you'll find some space in your tummy to order a glass of lassi (without which a Punjabi meal is deemed to remain incomplete) which simply tastes yum!

I went there with my family once at 10:30PM, ordered food, and after about 45 mins and constant asking they said "abhi der hoga" when I could see that they were serving others who came after me. Then I left. the waiter came out after me to demand the price of the bottle of water that took...to keep our hunger at bay. There was not a single apology from anyone. Seeing their attitude I decided not to pay for the bottle of water and asked them to pay me the price for waiting uselessly for 45 mins.
The waiter probably had never faced this before and had no other explanation. We left never to return.

Visited this place in one sun burning afternoon. Well decorated, fully yellow and spacious inside. We had chicken reshmi kabab, chicken biriyani and garlic nan. All were good both in quality n quantity. Bt one prb, since this place draws a lot of sec5 employees,  they should have more staffs to attend all, else you may have to sit for an hour.

Firstly I do not know how come this place has such high ratings....I RECOMMEND AS IN STRONGLY....TO AVOID THIS PLACE...REASONS...Disgusting service...Obnoxious behaviour....Utter no respect for the people....Below is our ordeal....
We entered around 10:30,after giving our order we were told that we would have to wait for 25 min....we were cool with it....They didn't even serve water for the next 15 min....we had to ask for water to be served.....You guys take 15 min to serve a basic thing like water,are you serious!!!We were 6 people and we served only 3 thalis first then the next 3 after 15min,I mean do you expect us to share from the same plate or eat in installments !!!!Food came...but to our surprise we had ordered tandoori butter naan,chicken bharta and another chicken dish....We were served plain naans, when we inquired about it we were told, we would have to wait further 15 mins for it. Thus, we stuck to it without any option....chicken bharta was simply sad,bigtime bland taste, the saving grace was the other chicken dish we had ordered....

We ordered soft drinks,which were served hot, when we inquired ,we were told that they do not have chilled or even cold soft drinks....I mean why not even tell us that there's no chilled or cold beverages available, its sheer harassment and what kind of staff do you guys have that they are not even updated about the inventory.

Lastly,we had to wait for 15 more min for the finger bowls to even arrive.¬†

I have a serious question for the management, are you guys doing a favour...you people are definately not treating us for free, you guys are charging us then why dish out such pathetic service to your clientele.

If this is the way ,this place is headed, then lord save the brand name.

I generally go to Jai Hind for my midnight food craving, however a friend suggested we should try this Dhaba 
The ambience is interesting. The milk can Lantern, the tractor. 
But the service! 
One customer was shooting at the management for late food. 
I entered super hungry, I waited and waited. Till I lost my appetite. That's when I got angry. We all walked out. 
The manager comes with a bill, not even asking what the problem is. 
When I said we waited an hour to get served Gravy Chicken and roti, the waiter said, he lost the food in the kitchen! 
That's absolutely ridiculous! 
The waiters look so confused! 

I hope you can make your service better!

I've been to this place once, and once had my food delivered. I was partly disappointed both the times. They do not accept the orders carefully, and on both occasions, they charged us for extra rotis, which we had not ordered. The dahi kebab was not up to the mark, though the other preparations¬† like Sukhe Dhanya aur Murgh ki Seekh and Murgh Resmi Kebab were awesome.
The ambiance is colorful, with all those nice dhaba-like decorations, and the price is also reasonable.

Great atmosphere inside the dhaba. I do enjoy the look they have tried to give it to the place. I am sure they can do more improvements to it but still great atmosphere and place to be. The food is good. I would say do not try to order the "Daal tadka" or anything with daal nature as I think they can't generate that same flavor as other dhaba but as far as chicken dishes goes. It's simply fantastic. Delhi butter chicken is something that I could go and finish the entire plate myself lol. And in appetizers go for reshmi, wait I think it's something else.. Anyways it's basically reshmi kebab with melted cheese on top. Amazing amazing :) definitely a must go if you love chicken.

Trying out different options near our college got our wallets empty but our appetites filled. Rang De Basanti Dhaba or RDBD in short provides you with ample eateries. Ranging from North Indian to Mughlai to Chinese, this place has It all. Fantastic service and delicious food makes this place a 'must' for foodies out there. The ambience has a Bollywood-ish feel with famous Bollywood one-liners adorning the walls. Lots of tables to offer and a roll counter outside, this place gets two thumbs up from me, despite the prices being on the higher side.

Great place for a simple dhaba style food! They have late night car parking and waiters serving in the car itself.  Quick and neat preparation.  
#Paneertikka is a must for veggies.  Absolute heaven to the taste buds.  Overall a good place for family dinner and late night eat out with friends...

Have been to this place quite a few times before. It's located just 2 mins walk from College More towards Karunamoyee. The place is very lively buzzing with people all the time. It's just a standard Punjabi style dhaba and have a wide variety of food to offer. Kulchas are quite good and rotis are always very crispy. Other vegetarian dishes such as Dal, Aloo Do Piaza, paneer etc. are average just like any other North Indian restaurant. They have good selection of beverages such as masala cold drink, nimbu pani, lassi etc. which are worth trying. Service is very quick And the place is open till 1 am.

Authentic Dhaba in between the high rise buildings and Offices, and 1 minute walk form College mor, the location of this dhaba is just perfect.

Coming to the food. 

We ordered Delhi Butter Chicken, Laccha Parantha, Butter naan and Masala Chaanch.

As I belong to Delhi where best butter chickens are served, RDBD's food was upto mark.

But one thing they missed to serve is "Complimentary Sirka Onion with Green Chutney". These 2 items were not even available on menu.

No doubt these two little things can make a lot of difference in taste and mood( for me specially).

It will be great if the RDBD will start serving these two as well along with the food.

Ambience : 4/5

Food : 4/5

Service : 4/5

There are still loads of items left on menu which are yet to be tasted and I am soon going to try them in my future visits.

Formerly it was azad hind dhaba.
But now it is RANG DE BASANTI DHABA.
And i must say everything is changed with its name..
I had chicken bharta n masala kulcha and taste was really good.
Prices are normal and decoration is mind blowing and i'm saying this as you will find a big tractor inside the restaurant to add up to the Punjabi style.. :p
Location is one of its USP as its located in hub of offices in sec 5.
Overall a good place to enjoy authentic Punjabi and other north Indian food.

This vibrant, colourful and Bollywood style dhaba is a refreshing contrast to the dull concrete buildings it is surrounded by and so it was full of people from offices around it when I visited with my friend. For starters we ordered the famous dahi ke kebab and then dilli ka paneer makhani and garlic and masala naan for the main course. I was highly disappointed with the delay in the service and they took almost 40 minutes to get us the starters but once I tasted the food, all my anger melted with the lip smacking Dahi Ke Kebab served with chutney that had an ‚Äòout of the world‚Äô taste. Masala Naan is also a must try, though I recommend you to take some time in your hand before going there.

It gives you the feel of dhaba, inside the city. On entering you are welcomed by the tractor and you get a feel of being in Punjab. The ambience was good, filled with vintage posters of bollywood adds. You are welcomed with punjabi songs, which gives a nice feeling. The served food was good, the gravy served has appropriate quantity. But the naan wasn't up to the mark cause few pieces were burned, though was changed instantly, but didn't impress us. The lassi served at the end wasn't as good as was expected. Overall was a good hangout here.

It was a midnight food run. After roaming around sector 5 for quite some time we found that This place was open. Luckily for us we were craving some piping hot north Indian. We entered the noisy dhaba style restaurant and ordered garlic naan and chicken bharta. The nimbu Pani didn't have enough nimbu though and we had to squeeze additional lemons into it. All in all, an OK place for the prices they charge

Been there and done that. But yes i will think quite sometime before even considering going back here. The food is decent but the bill is what slaps you down. Given the location of sec V many people like this place of office gataway lunch. But for students and people who can go to other paets if the city easily will have major issues with cost and quality. It gives an artificial feel of dhaba. A rather insight in dat would have been beneficial.

Apart from the over hyped makeover of this place, it still doesn't appeal me much. Food is oddly overpriced in my opinion. Quality is also Ok. Good for late night bites and chicken rolls.
Edit: Went there again, the service was sloppy. Mutton in the mutton Biriyani was a bit dry, the Hariyali seekh kebab was just kebab dipped in pudina sauce. On the good part RDBD Chicken bharta was tasty andthe Biriyani was palatable.

They serve one of the finest Dal Makhani in the city and is a must try. ¬†Their veg food is good with ¬†The desi breads are not that good but you can hangout for a late night dinner. ¬†

¬†The Ambience is not exactly of a dhaba except for the tractor. I like the bulb holders and the poster of Gabbar and Basanti all around. You have to struggle to find the waiters but the service is quick.

Heard about the good food at this joint... So my friend and me headed for dinner one evening... I liked the decor... gave a punjabi highway roadside feel with the tractor and the huge bulb shaped lights.... Service was quick ... the walls were done well with quirky posters... also the restrooms had 'GABBAR' and 'BASANTI' labelled for the ladies and gents restrooms ... which was amusing. Coming to the food...
We ordered patiyala chicken tikka... fair... 6/10 ive had better ... nothing spectacular
Dilli ki butter chicken... 8/10 done well... slightly more on the sweeter side but good none the less
The Punjab di dal makhani stole  the show... with right taste of the tarka and butter laced .... sinful... will come back for more... Also the kachumar salad was a good add on.
Lachcha paratha and keema kulcha were good. The tandoori roti was very soft and easy to break so extra points for the bread..

Located at a convenient place just near College more sector 5, this place is a good place to enjoy food from north-west part of India.My suggestion wud be to go for Delhi ka Butter chicken, Special attraction is Malai ka Chicken kebabs.. absolute bliss. Pair them wid hari mirch ki roti or lal mirch ke paranthe if u like spicy.

Lassi is just abt avg., ambience is just abt okay, lil crowdish but thats okay for a dhaba.¬†Although a slightly overpriced for some items but value for money.

Went for dinner here on Sunday n the place was crowded, luckily v got a table as we were js two ppl.. Some ppl even ordered the food and were having it in their car. As u enter there is a big tractor on the side givin the place a touch of Punjab, the ambience is nothing too great.. It's simple with a few frames n posters on the wall. V ordered hara bhara kabab n dilli 6 ki tandoori chicken for starters.. The tandoori is really good, soft n succulent pieces of chicken, the hara bhara kabab is good as well. V ordered the masala papad as an accompaniment  as well which was served with chopped onions, tomatoes and cucumber.. For the main course v ordered the dilli butter chicken, lucknowi mutton korma,amritsari chole,rdb dal butter tadka, tandoori roti, butter naan and masala kulcha. To wash all this food down v ordered the rang de cola. Okay the amritsari chola is the best chola I have had till so far, simply loved it, the butter chicken was nothing too great, I found the chicken pieces to b a bit rubbery.. The mutton korma was prepared excellently, it has a similar taste to chaap n it comes with an egg. The rang de cola really helps u in digesting all the food, it's basically thumbs up with jaljeera.. V even had the kulfi here, it's average, served with falooda and rose syrup.One can easily miss it as its nothing exceptional..Overall a  very good experience.. The staff is polite n very helpful. Food is better than the other dhabas around!

The service is not exciting as the name sounds spoiling the entire experience.
This was my second visit (once during 1st week of opening).The service was at snail pace in my first visit thought since it is new will improve but in the my 2nd visit also i couldn't see any improvement.
Waiters took 15-20mins to serve water and after repeated asking for menu card gave it finally.The order took another 40mins to serve on the table.

Positive: The decor is a different with quirky posters adoning the wall.The colas and sodas r served in an unique way in glass bottles.

Neutral: The food is neither good or bad its just average.

Only go if you have loads of time (atleast 2hrs) and want to taste average food with a below average service.

Alright firstly let me admit that this place is the only restaurant where I literally tapped my feet... The moment you enter, you feel the retro side of the city. Music is awesome, I feel they played all my favorite songs... Just loved it. The beautiful giant tractor gives you a great feel of Papaji... ? Yeah it's different. The pictures or frames on the wall are amazing... One should not miss the lights... Gosh, they are absolutely innovative; kettles, milk containers are used beautifully for the lighting shades.
Food is quiet good. Chicken Biryani, butter naan, laal jhinga, kadhai chicken & simple nimbu pani were on our order list... Other than the prawn I liked everything, I felt it was too salty but was tender & juicy. Prawns could have been way much better. Plates, glasses are beautiful. I mean this is it, I loved each & every corner of my presence there. It is a true our ishtyl restaurant. It's Desi...!!!
Special Mention: Afsar, our attendant was extremely polite & patient. He deserves a thumbs up!!! One will love his treatment. ?

Thank You

It was a birthday treat and we went to this place after office last month. Earlier this place was known as Azad Hind Dhaba which changed itself to Rang De Basanti Dhaba. Well, I wasn't that pleased with the Azad Hind people and here too little changed for the better. The food is great along with their prices. We tried Dilli ka Butter Chicken, RDBD Chicken Bharta, Achari Chicken Tikka, Sukhe Dhanya aur Murgh ki Seekh, Chicken Lassuni, Keema Kulcha and Butter Naan. I have to say they were all delicious but what irked me the most is the service.¬†
We had to ask atleast 6-7 times for a glass of water though the place was fairly empty. The waiters are far away and you need to shout in order to attract their attention which is no way an expected norm.
Last but not the least, the koolfi was great too.

Had a pathetic experience today.  Someone named Anand took the order at 11:45 pm.  we waited for more than one hour and called again.  We were told that we are supposed to get the order delivered within next 10 mints.  After that 30 mints passed and then we called again.  This time we came to know that due to the tyre puncture the order did not get delivered.  They will deliver once more.  I can not expect this kind of service from RDBD.  This is worst.  After 1 hr 30 mints we are hearing that order will be re dispatched.  That too on a weekday. This is unexpectable.  I urge to RDBD that these kind of persons should be removed.  Some actions need to be taken as this is nothing but harrasing the customers.  If no action is being taken then  I will be taking necessary action.

Every item on the menu is lip-smacking..They consistently dish out gorgeous dhaba fare with the exact finger licking taste every time.
One amazing family dinner I had there recently was on my dad's birthday.We were ravenously hungry so we ordered main course right away.The cheese and peas pulao has a delicate flavour with melt in the mouth chunks of cottage cheese.For Vegetarians who are bored of paneer ,the Kashmiri aloo Dum is a must try.The mutton biryani,kadhai chicken and butter naans were all perfect.The lassi takes the meal to another different level.

What a funky place! Starting from their decor which says "bhayankar thanda cola" to the huge yellow tractor just next to the entrance to the colourful posters to the delicious food I absolutely love everything about this place. 
Their staff is super fast and efficient and is very attentive, the place is clean, the food served is hot fresh and most importantly tastes good! 
My personal favourite is their Palak paneer and masala kulcha! Even their chicken roll is a great evening snack! Fresh lime sodas are served in cute little jars! 
A no complaint restaurant for me! Fast service, superb food and I don't need anything else! Please don't let the standard fall! One of the few places in Calcutta where North Indian food still tastes good !

I can easily call this the best Dhaba around! The food is more than delicious and the ambience is good too.. The shiny steel plates, the glossy steel glasses, melted butter over the soft nans and the yummiest dilli ka butter chicken made me feel like I'm in Punjab... Awesome food! Keep it up guys! Will be visiting soon again! Highly recommended peeps!

I have visited Rang De Basanti Dhaba pretty often lately. Thus this review is a culmination of my last four visits to the place. 
It is a Dhabha themed Restaurant. The ambience and decor of RDB is unlike the other Dhabas in Kolkata. The red tractor along with classic framed print ads of various brands are attention grabbing and engaging. (Being a media student I totally fell for those ad strips! ) 
I liked the laminated clean menu card, something which is very unlikely in most dhabas I have visited. The menu has typical dhaba offerings. We ordered the Chicken Platter for starters. This was a tri-colored platter serving three pieces of each, achari (red) reshmi (white) and hariyali (green) chicken. The chicken was mouth-melting soft. I personally loved the Hariyali chicken the most among the three. Our main course comprised of Dilli ka makhni chicken along with tandoori rotis, garlic and buttered nans. I loved the tangy gravy of this particular curry. Coupling it with steamed rice made my meal sumptuous! 
For drinks we ordered Desi Nimbu Pani, Fresh Lime Soda and Gulab Sharbat Nimbu Maarke. The drinks were nothing exceptional in taste but what made them attractive was the mini bottles they were served in. 
We summed up the meal with a serving of the Kulfi Faluda. Being a novice in having a taste for Kulfi, I personally liked the spoonful I tasted. 
After so many good things that I have mentioned there were still a few flaws that the management  needs to work on. Firstly, on three out of four occasions I have been declined a serving for fish tikka. In a state where fish consumption ranks 4th in India, not being served one of the the favorite recipes has been quite a disappointment for me. Secondly, it is a tussle to get the waiter to notice that you are ready for an order. It takes a lot of effort to grab attention of the waiters from the start to the end of the meal. The same has been the case in rush hours as well as a usual day. 
For someone like me who loves themed places with good food, RDB is a must try.

It's a good option for people living in an around salt lake and Newtown if they are in a mood for some desi food. We have mostly done takeaways. The chicken bharat was nice and creamy , but I missed the eggs in the bharta which is so quintessential to the dish. The chicken tikka was fiery and soft..With a pungent smell of mustard oil. I personally liked the taste of it. I had also ordered masala Kulcha which turned out to be soft and non oily. The mutton raat din is an innovative dish with eggs filled with a spicy mutton mix but they take a hell lot of time to make it.

RDBD is a brand new name given to a very well established place and they have done absolute justice to the reputation this place holds. RDBD has a variety of delicious food items and the prices are reasonable.

There's no other place around which is close to the quality of food and services they provide. I have tried Chicken Bharta everywhere in the city but RDBD makes it best along with many other dishes. The ambiance is too good for a place of this stature. Its neat and clean and very specious. Overall, it's a must visit place in the area.

Located next 2 my office,this s an obvious choice 4 eating out in weekdays as well as 4 post office hunger cravings..

The place has a fun ambience..u will find a tractor inside the restro...they serve dishes having fun names like vayankar thanda cola..

My personal favrt here is kima kulcha..if u hav a medium apetite,1 kulcha s enough 4 u..also the other variants of roti,like butter nun,garlic nun r must try..side dishes are good..mostly wid loads of butter and cream..so pls put ur calorie conscious self aside and indulge in the flavors of northern India..

I didnt like their biriyani which lacked the moisture and necessary flavours..
The kebabs r too good..especially hariyali kebab n fish kebab

Service is prompt..Staffs r well behaved..

They also hav a sitting arrangement outside 4 ppl opting 4 rolls whch agn r quite good..but rolls r costlier compared 2 other roll shops..

Overall worth a visit..

There are not too many places in Kolkata where you can get good Bheja Fry.Having heard RDB dhaba serves up a lovely Bheja Fry and Bheja Masala,this place was in my wishlist for quite a while.

Located conveniently in Building more at Salt lake Sector 5,I finally managed to try out this place a couple of sundays back with a group of friends.It was about 3.30 in the afternoon when we reached and the place was buzzing and we had to wait a while to get ourselves a table.Once you enter the traditional vibrant and colourful Punjabi Dhaba ambiance is sure to attract your fancy.

We had to wait so long to be given a menu,that I myself got one from the next table.Once we decided what we would order,it was a pain to get the attention of the staff to actually get our order placed.Anyway we finally managed to place our order and I was utterly disappointed to find that the Bheja Fry would not be available.Anyway we were a bunch of hungry souls and our order comprised of a paneer butter masala,chicken bharta,tawa bheja masala,keema kaleji,nimbu mirch mutton,laal mirch ka paratha and pudina paratha.

Our order was quite extensive and we could understand the food taking¬† some time but what really disappointed us was we were not even served water and also the food took exceptionally long.We had to wait far too long.All in all even before we could taste the food,the service left us exasperated.

Finally the food arrived.The laal mirch ka paratha was unique and excellent.I loved it.The paneer butter masala and the chicken bharta were okay but I have had better elsewhere.The keema kaleji,tawa bheja masala and the nimbu mirch mutton were all tawa items.They all were nice and tasty I must say but were all far too similar.Moreover all the items could do with a little more of the brain or the mutton or the keema I felt.

The service as I have mentioned already was pretty woeful.The prices are more or less okay.

All in all we visited this place with high expectations but ended up being pretty disappointed.Although there was nothing much wrong with the food,it was by no means exceptional and still can be improved upon a lot.The service surely needs to be looked at.

And the worst experience so far in Kolkata. Food was okay, no doubt abt that but service sucks. I ordered fresh lime soda and as usual they served it in their bottle like glasses and guess what the glass was not washed/cleaned. 

It was easily seen that they previously served lassi in the same glass as curd was all sticked on inner wall of the glass (cum bottle).

I quietly stood and went to their cash counter and saw them the glass, they instantly took it from me and said that they will replace it.

I went back to my seat and as soon as I sat back they brought a new one in just 30-40 seconds. Obviously they just poured it in new glass.

Now I asked the guy who was serving my table that at least he should check the glass before serving to the customer and on that he replied "sir wo to saaf hi tha bas thoda sa hi lassi laga tha". 

WTF.. This made me very unhappy and started asking for their supervisor.

No manager was there to address the complaint. And those present there were not ready to accept their mistake and start pretending like it was all my mistake.

Seriously, you SUCK rang de basanti dhaba

Good staff. Great food. Punjab da feels. Tractor in the house. Name says it all.
A pocket friendly late night modern Dhaba. The salted lassi or buttermilk is mind blowing. The service is fast. 
The meetha paan outside the restaurant at the cigarette shop is also worth trying.

Food is very nice as promised by them. And the ambience is superb. It gives you true pleasure to sit , relax and eat the food. But its slightly expensive and digs holes in pockets. And moreover the service just negates the beauty of the ambience.

If you have enough money to spend and you don't worry about delayed services or if with bunch of friends, this place can be true heaven.

I opt for home delivery as was craving for punjabi food in kolkata and it did not quite put up a gr8 show. The charges furnished were different from what the menu displayed at the site. 
Tandoori roti was the biggest disappointment.. i asked for plain but they charged me for butter rotis and that too for those rotis which i had to swallow just like that as they weren't even chewable. They were more like dry naans which i had to streach all the way to break it... 
Its not ethical to charge even a penny extra from wht u display on ur menu... or send ur paper menu along with the order so that the customer rest assured in case ur menu isnt updated on the site. Also it wud help them to order smthn the next time... 

A good initiative though to make punjabi food accessible in kolkata.. but it needs some major fixes here and there atleast at the home delivery service to make this initiative a gr8 one.!

Service is good.
One more thing..just at the entrance,they have put a tractor. Those who are camera loving ,can go for it..to be clicked like a tractor driver ;) :)

Now coming to the food we ordered mutton biriyani and the waiters took considerable time serving it though the restaurant was quite empty. The serving of the food was excellent. 

The taste & quality was above average but not excellent. Have tasted better elsewhere.

This is a proper dhaba with very simplistic decor.Though,it does look contemporary and I loved the photos adorning the walls.
I had the Dal Egg tarka and Chicken Masala (boneless) with rotis.
The Dal was thick and the flavour was very good.
I just loved the Chicken.It was cut into shreds like Chicken Bharta.It was a medium spicy dish and was very flavourful.
The service was average and the prices are like they should be for a good standard dhaba.

After an exam today I and my friends went to RDBD for lunch.... As it was sunday we thought that it would be quite empty... However many people were dining there... The waiter pointed towards a table and the three of us went there to have a seat...The first thing that amazed us the tractor right up there and the vibrant decor inside completely splashed with colours and posters of old ads and many foodie quotes!!!!
Coming to the food... It is probably the first time that we had not ordered any starters and I do regret it ( which instantly gives me another reason to come back!!!!) For the main course we had ordered mutton biriyani , chicken biriyani and keema pulao... Keema pulao is a new dish for me and it was great.... The rice used for this was different from the rice used normally for pulao which added to the taste.. Keema in the form of meat balls was all over it and it was way too good....
For the side dish we just had to order their signature dish dilli ka butter chicken.... It was excellent.... The best butter chicken i have had so far... The chicken was soft which instantly sort of melts in your mouth... The gravy was awesome with the smell of butter all over it...
We also ordered 3 butter tandoori rotis to finish off the butter chicken...

The bill was 1076 for the three of us which is all right.....

It was one of the most colourful food experience i have had so far and will be coming back soon!!!!
While making the payment , the waiter gave us another reason to come back...... He gave us a coupons of free beverage and desserts!!!!!!! We could not have any starters or desserts today but surely will come back sometime soon...

I visited this restaurant with high hopes. I ordered Kadhai Paneer while my friend ordered Sarso Ka Saag. Neither of the dishes were upto the mark. The kadhai paneer lacked taste and the Sarso Ka Saag felt "powdery". The ambiance and the decor of the place was quite good. Felt that the prices too were on the higher side. Conveniently located, you could try this place if you're hungry and bored of the Subway Pizza Hut and KFC in the vicinity.

This review of mine is based on my three visits to this place..earlier I had rated this place 5. However, due to my second and third visit I had to change my ratings. 

My first visit to the joint was a very good experience. The service was good. Food was excellent. 

However, my experience on the second visit was not so good and on my third visit was bad beyond description. The waiters at the place are unfriendly, unwilling to serve. You have to wait for at least fifteen minutes after getting a seat, for the waiter to come to your service. If you want to re-order you will have to try hard to catch hold of a waiter. The same condition persist even when the rush level is low. 

Now coming to the food..firstly, there is no consistency in the taste and quality of food. On my first visit I order Dal Tarka, mushroom mattar, dilli ka chicken, Indian breads, fish tikka and chicken biryani. All of it was good, mushroom mattar, dilli ka chicken and fish tikka being the best. On my second visit most of the items on menu were missing. So I ordered dal tarka, Indian breads and dilli ka chicken. Fish tikka and chicken biryani were not available though it was just 9pm. After waiting for an hour I was served. This time the same items tasted different. All of it was bad. 

My third visit forced me to change my review on Zomato as well as fill the feedback form at the restaurant. After a movie with my family we decided to come here for dinner as this place serves food even at midnight. However, to my disappointment they hardly have anything to serve at midnight. Again after 15 minutes of sitting the waiter arrived to take our order though there was no rush at the restaurant. 90% items on menu were not available. Basic food items were unavailable. For instance, i ordered onion salad and mineral water. It was unavailable. I didn't get the point as to how these items can be unavailable. I ordered chicken biryani, rumali roti, kulfi, ice cream- all of these were unavailable. Finally, all they had was Dal makhani, chicken tikka, mixed vegetable, steamed rice, some Indian breads and keema rice. Dal makhani and steam rice was ok. Mixed vegetable was super spicy. Chicken tikka was bad. Keema rice was more of kaju rice. Highly disappointed by the service and food, I asked the waiter for feedback form when I was handed a fork. After three requests I was given a feedback form. I filled in my grievances and handed it over to the waiter. The whole team of waiters were now reading my form and staring at our table as if I had committed some crime by filling the form. 

Apart from food and service the washrooms are also terrible. "Basanti" was so terrible that I was forced to use "Gabbar". 

My overall experience at the place was very bad. Only having the tractor will not help attract customers. Food, service and ambience together play an important role to lure customers specially when the competition is high. 

I would not recommend this place to anyone. You may visit it on your on risk. If your luck is good you may get good food and service just like I got on my first visit. Otherwise, "All the Best" is all that I can say.

Best place in Calcutta for yummy veg food. The waiters are a little rude. Ambience is just okayish. But I visit here frequently because of the tasty food.

Had no plans of visiting this place but ended up being there at the last moment. We were four in number. We ordered veg spatter and paneer tikka for the starter, dilli ki butter paneer was delicious and the veg korma was liked by my pals though I didn't enjoy it that much. The LASSI to end the meal was beyond expectations. Coming to the ambience, being a theme based restaurant, it got me at once i was in there. The portraits, the tag-lines, the aroma and the lights were all just the way they should be. The bill for the four of us was Rs.1480 which again was decent enough.
To sum up, i had a great experience and would definitely recommend this to my friends. Thumbs-up!!

A crazy restaurant with all the popular bollywood dialogues on the walls and a tractor up front which may make u feel like u r in some kind of punjabi dhaba. The design and quotes in the menu card is really somehow unique.  We ordered veg fried rice, chicken fried rice, chicken butter masala and chicken afgani. Though the service was late, but no compromise with taste. I liked the afgani, u should try once. And dnt miss the lassi at the end. Overall, best to hangout with buddies particularly when someone is throwing a treat. :D

As the name pulled me inside to have punjabi khana and found the interior were really nice.
The menu is moderately priced and parallel to that portion size is also relevant. For the menu pricing I will recommend 5/5.

Food: Being as a bong I am hardcore Non vegetarian and the positive waves of this place captivated me towards the lunch. And I ordered chicken lassoni , masala kulcha & chicken tikka butter masala. Food served to me as before & more of my expectation. Loved the prep. For food at this price 4.5/5.

What gets you to this place is the actual tractor placed right where you enter. Gives that punjabi pind feeling- you know... 
The decor is symbiotic mixture of Bollywood and Punjabi culture. 
Coming to the food- the quantity is no doubt worth your salt and more. 
Quality and taste wise also the place serves good food but there's room for improvement(explains why i have rates it 3.5). 
Overall good place and good food, wouldn't mind going there time and again.

I have always found dhaba food not only tasty but different from the elite restaurant, hotels as it adds a rustic flavour to the whole atmosphere. The very Indianness is difficult to avoid; lovely, nowadays there are few dhabas on Kolkata which providing marvelous food in a relaxed atmosphere. Rang se basanti dhaba is one dhaba where I go often with my pals. That too name of the dhaba is one of the blochbuster films making the place more attractive and curious to all. And as expected the food will be as interesting as the overall environ. The item that I chose to indulge in was hariyali panner tikka, the paneer laced in green sabzi is truly heavenly. Then came chicken lassuni I just love the flavour and taste, not just that I have the special corner for chicken but the flavour alltogether¬† was exceptionally scrumptious, so was the look of it. Next mutton chaampen and burrah is the typical rustic dish. The dish went very well with jeera rice. The combination is fulfilling. Sometimes I prefer to savour their chicken biriyani or mutton biriyani both are equally good. And when it comes to choose their sweets I love to go with their kulfi faluda.

This place offers great Punjabi and north Indian food. The classics like butter chicken , dal makhani and chole  masala are all amazing. I would recommend tandoori chicken. The quality of food and service is better when there is less rush like on weekdays . Overall an amazing place and u get a feel of a sophisticated Punjabi dhaba.

First of all its not at all a DHABA. Its a restaurant and the interiors and seating and the price- none of them are dhaba style. A tractor placed inside with some tyres strewn around is cool and they even allow you to get shots posing with,on or in the tractor ...ahh-so-cheeky... Well the food, is okayish. The prices are competitive and the service is average. So its not a bang for the buck but full marks for a huge cover and special marks for being open till 1 AM. Now how many places in Kolkata do that? No eyeing around once you are sitting past 10-30 pm....Nice! You can order dishes upto 1245 AM. Coming to the nitty gritties of the food served...its average at its best. I have had sarson da saag and makai di roti...but the ones served here had only a colour resemblance. the makki di roti was yellow. Thats it! It was hard and crispy which is not at all desired. I had to ask them repeatedly for ghee(to soften the crispiness) and lemons and achaar which should be on your table always. Only thing that I liked was the masala cola and the chaas...authentically prepared and served in a quirky way - a glass bottle that resembles a cough syrup bottle(without the cap). Nevertheless its tasty and especially at 1 AM, when you are out of choice its overpowering!. Parking is free so no worries. The staff is ok and take a long time to bring the platter to your table but I didnt mind, especially at that hour. The longer they take...the more fun it is for us :P Would visit this place later on to explore more of their offerings...In a nutshell an average place with a little uppish charge but all points for late night dining. Oh and they have decided to rename the lavatories as Gabbar for Men and Basanti for women...So keep that in mind to avoid embarrassment in public...Ouch! :) Next time if you want to date a doting girl afterhours try this place. Who knows they might let you eat and sleep in the tractor as well.. :P

Makki di roti aur sarsho da shaag! I visited this restaurant to taste this special punjabi delicacy. It is available throughout the winter. The place is big, well lit, innovatively decorated, with a full size tractor inside the hall. Now the food, the starter, paneer achari tikka was exceptionally tasty. But main course was not upto my expectations. Makki di roti was hard and crispy. They served small serving of butter and sweet guur. We had to apply the butter on the roti to make it soft. As this was my first time, not really sure if that is the way to eat makki di roti. Sarsho da shag was simple and tasty. We also tried one mutton dish, which was good. Finally lassi and gajar ka halwa. Lassi was simple and tasty, but I believe the gajar ka halwa needs a little bit more ghee to avoid the dull smell of gajar. Overall a mixed experience.

Strangely this place seems to be determined to ask for a lower rating with each visit..with their worthless operations management. Before I proceed to divulge details let me specify that my earlier review was from the first 2 visits both on weekdays during low rush hours and am leaving that below unaltered to show the difference. 
Strangely they do not have a waiting queue manager on weekdays and whoever grabs a table gets to sit!Once grabbed we had to wait for at least 20 mins when the waiter took the order with and said wouls check on availability and said we could place the order.After around 30 mins we were told 2 of the 5 dishes were nit available. We still altered to suit the available options but after 15 mins another dish was told to have run out!! It was like waiting outside for free distribution of dinner service.Even the manager was "kya karega sir" types!And all this when it was 1045 so nothing would be available at other places.
Suggestion to all who want to try- food is good here if you get it..and please go with time at hand and be prepared to run for seats.Also have options in case you need to walk out!!
@mgmt of RDB: if you are reading this..please give a thought to managing operations before opening such places to harass people who are already hungry!

Went there with family and was quite pleased with the overall experience.The place is nicely decorated and decor is kept simple which seems to fit well into the theme. Staff is courteous and take care of guests well.We ordered makai di roti and sarson da saag, lasooni kabab, haryali kabab, garlic naan and kadhai chicken...all of which were quite nice.The lasooni kabab was the best of the lot and would have preferred the haryali kabab to have less spice. But overall it is a nice break from the regular indian buffet outlets in and around sector V.
One aspect that the management should take care of is the cleanliness of the restrooms..definitely needs better attendants and facility to stand close to what is to be expected from a restaurant of a similar class.

One more dhaba in the locality. Sector 5 is flooded with food joints. The food here is quite the same as you will find in Azad Hind Dhaba as this was earlier a branch of AHD. Now they have got themselves a new name and a new look. Well the look is quite cool and new whereas you won't find much difference in terms of food. The variety and quality of the food is quite the same as AHD. The pricing, though, I think has been increased a bit. The food quality I might say is quite good for its own standards but if compared to its early form (as AHD), one might be disappointed. The service is also quite alright. Treat yourselves and then have a opinion of your own.

located near college more in sector 5, it's a place for authentic mughlai cuisine in very affordable price. they stay open pretty late, we reached there at around 1am in the midnight and still found people dining.

interior is bright and spacious. they have few outside tables available too. order process was quick and service was quicker! we got our food within 7-8 mins of ordering.

we got classical tandoori rotis and butter naans along with egg bhurji, keema matar and chicken bharta. amount per service was enough for 2-3 people. tastewise, nothing to complain about, keema matar was very tasty but not very rich. chicken bharta was nice, lacked egg.

price was less compared to other restaurants in the same area. i would definitely recommend them for quick lunch/dinner if you want to have good quality food in affordable price in sector 5.

Let's get right to it. We visited RANG DE BASANTI on Christmas. However given that I must say, there was absolutely no delay in the arrival of our orders. The ambience had a Bollywood touch, but it wasn't impressive on any scale. The service was mediocre.
Now the food part.
We ordered
RDBD bharta which was utterly disappointing! The only thing rich about it was the color. Everything else just failed.
Chicken tadka was another dish we ordered and like the former it also failed to delight our palette on any level. Just average.
However the nans were quite firm yet soft. Which is a plus point.
These 2 dishes discouraged me from trying out anything further. So I settled with The RDBD gola. It's their speciality drink which comes in a cute bottle and was pretty tasty. Over all I'm pretty disappointed. Here are the quick ratings.

Ambience : 2.5/5
Service : 2.5/5
Value for money : 2/5
Food : 1.8/5

Check this place if and only if you have no where else to go.

Peace :)

RDBD is most 3rd class restaurant I ever seen before. Basically they use to cheat customers.....if you see the prices of any item from internet different from actual price. Today on 24/12/2014 we have ordered two Chicken Kadhai which is printed in internet Rs.185 per plate but when we received the items we got shocked after looking at the bill, it was Rs. 527 for two Chicken Kadhai. It seems like okay because there was nothing to do on the mean time, so we thought like the food quality will be great and obviously the pcs of chicken will be sufficient.

But no way, there was 4 pcs (as promised) and size of the pcs was too small, and about the taste there was no salt in the food and too much sweet, seems like we are having chicken flavor sweet.

We never expected this kind of food quality from RDBD, and I will never going to visit them.

Once a branch of Azad Hind Dhaba, this newly set up Rang De Basanti Dhaba lives up to the reputation of its predecessor.

Food: Very good. One of the places in Kolkata where you get good Dhaba food. The biriyani and dal makhani are awesome! So are the kebabs. Do not try the mushroom dish. They don't make I that great. I rate it 4/5.

Ambience: Pretty basic setup it has. Nothing fancy. But it's clean and comfy. It has outdoor seating arrangements too but because of the pollution from the cars running just beside, you generally prefer it inside. I rate it 3/5.

Service: Staffs is not immensely cordial but well behaved. In rush hours you might get ignored a bit and there can be delay in preparing your food but in other times they are pretty prompt. I rate it 3.5/5.

Price: Standard price. Tad bit more than what its worth I think but then it depends on what you order.

Overall I give it 3.5/5.

The food here is very good but sadly it is over-priced in the most worst manner!! As per Kolkata standards and the food that you have here the prices are too high!! I would rather prefer going to Arsalan or Aminia or elsewhere if I am willing to pay so much!!

RDBD is a must visit for all foodies with a love for north indian cuisine. I was bowled over by their chicken lassuni which was extremely delicious. Mutton boti was served on egg whites which was a bit of a let down for me. The patiala chicken and the tawa chicken tikka both were equally tasteful but the latter was a pinch more spicy. But what i liked most were the naans. The keema kulcha was full of fillings and the garlic naan was crispy and soaked in butter. We also had rang de cola which i did not like as it tasted just like masala cola. However the firni was quite good. The service is not up to the mark but the food is to die for. Waiting to try their rolls on the next visit.

Went to RDBD at 11 in the night.It is one of those few places that remain open till late night!First of all,this restaurant provides outdoor seating which is a great plus.The ambiance is nice,and the waiters are well behaved.Ordered Roomali Roti,Dal Makhani and Chicken Tadka.But Roomali Roti wasn't available.The food was exceptional,and the Tadka was perhaps the best i have ever had!However the only downside is the waiting time.But considering the rush they had even at 11 pm,it is quite understandable.

Hope to return soon and try out their other items.

To start with, I would say that RDBD is a perfect place to grab some North Indian fare with both friends and family.
Well, it was a family gathering. The staff were informed that afternoon, and they gladly made nice arrangements for the 11 of us to sit together.

Inside, I really liked the lamps hanging from the ceiling - they're milk canisters hanging upside down! The tractor added to the charm (with special appreciation from my 2 years old niece).

We started off with Lasuni kabab, achari tikka and chicken reshmi kabab. Though I did not really like the lasuni kabab, the other two were relishing. The dal makhani was one of the best I've tasted yet, coupled with okayish garlic naan. The boneless pieces of Butter Chicken were soft and delicious. The biryani was different in a positive sense. Thumbs up because the dishes didn't have the overdose of oil I found in many dhabas.
I wanted to conclude with the Gulab Jamun in icecream, but they told they couldn't heat the jamuns. (sad!)
Combining the hospitality, quick serving and the food, the experience was brilliant. Visiting again soon!

This place,a little off college more serves authentic punjabi fare.
The decor is cheeky and bang on with a tractor placed just inside the entrance.
Delhi Butter Chicken,Chicken Kali Mirch,Bheja Fry. The Garlic Naan is mouth watering. 
However service is slow and behaviour of the staff not that great.
The food is amazing and we gulped it down without that many photos on both the occassions I went there.

First visit Week 1 Oct'14: Waited 15-20 minutes , tables occupied that time (lunch time weekday ) at 12:30 -1 pm were only two . So I was the third person who walked in, nobody came to my table I cud see orange t-shirt staff not less than 5-6 standing idle at billing counter. On having eye contact with one i called him by raising my hand he pojnted me to a guy already taking order for the table seated behind me . But he dudnt come, nobody else bothered to look. The guy who was already taking order after taking order served water and kept plates on the table behind me, by that time the last table at the back called "excuse me" , sk thisguy goes there speaks for some time notes the order and goes to the counter where some food just came from kitchen, he takes it and heads for the last table. He then comes back has some yellow page small notepad finishes writinv dkwn something and gives to a guy standing next to him. Then I am being given the menu. Water not yet served almost 10-15 mins have gone. I order for a dal makhani and rotis. Aftef thatyellow handwritten order slip is handed over, I am given water and plate. After another 10-15 min order is served. The person kept the food on my table with a bang as if he just offloaded something very heavy that he was burdened with. Didnt even bother to ask if i wanted the food to be served as dal was hot, picking the hot bowl and self serve was difficult. As these ppl usually carry a cloth napkin on which theg place the hot bowl and then serve, anyways after finishing through one roti. I came across a small piece of stone. I kept it aside and told him , trust me no rssponse at all very cold sorry and went away. Trust me dal makhani was horrible not at all the original dal makhani that you would get in north. It was more like a mix dal you could see whole chana dal , whole rajma, whole black dal. However though all these dals form part of dal makhani but all you can see is whole masoor dal and some bits of rajma rest all is pulverised to give a creamy texture. Overall a pathetic experience.

Second visit: sometime in oct'14 . Visited at about 4 pm in the evening no delay in taking order. No table was actally occupied that time, ordered for a mutton biryani biryani was served, the person served it also, i noticed todays special on board was masala chach, so ordered for it, later realized the biggest mistake. Chach was served in a small glass bottle greenish in color, too much salt and very thick , just tasted as if  I am having nothing but a large portion of mint chutney poured in a bottle, told the person, no response just an ok acknowledgement.

Third visit: week 2 nov'14. Again lunch time, same incident repeated nobody came even if they were free and roaming around, except the person who was busy with 3 more tables occupied in the same section wherd I was seated. Delay of almist 10-15 mins. Ordered for a rajma and plain rice. Food came after 10-15 mins usual time. Rajma was horrible, didnt at all have the original taste of how rajma should be, they served the red/maroon rajma and not the light colored rajma. Red one is usually called rajma jammu and lighter spotted one is known as chittidar rajma. Rajma gravy was thickened by crushed boiled potatoes, very obvious from the taste and I also got 2-3 small bits of potato. Spoiled taste of rajma altogether. I called in for the chef, gave him a detailed feedback, all he could say us these are standard reciepes fron start of the restaurant and he is very new, he will share it with management.

Fourth visit: 30-Nov-14 : I walked in at about 3 pm . It was almost occupied only 4-5 tables were vacant but all unclean, there were two more group of people waiting for tables, I caught hold of a person at the billinb counter and asked him for a table for 1 person. He guided me to an unclean table and I pointed out that it needs to be cleaned then he told some guy, after couple of minutes a person came in, since it was damn hot outside I immediately after getting seated asked for the 'bhayankar chilled cola' trust me 10-15 minutes passed nobody turned up I walked upto to counter 3-4 orange tshirt people were standing I asked the green tshirt guy at the countef that its been 15 min whats taking so long, no body responded in fact the green tshirt guy was so bust counting his notes he first looked at me and almost ignored and went back to counting, while I turned back from the counter I saw the gug whom I had asked for the cola, he in turn asked someone what happened to the cola didnt I tell you its needed immediately, he said he is not sure whether order is not, I immediately stormed out, I went out to the take away counter and trust me anyone else would have slapped that person a dark guy in green tshirt with specs for the way he responded. I saw the number mentioned for bulk booking I asked him where the call will go. He said it comes here only. I told him the issue, and asked for a phone number for complaint or some senior, he said manager is inside and only he can help. I told him look there has been a issue me rather than putting it as a negative feedback in reviews in zomato, FB and tripadvisor its better I speak to someone and sort this out,  he replied you can put it any where you want and it will be better you put in online reviews and smirked. I walked away, trust me I had recommended the biryani to many of my office colleagues who came on tour from outside, we are usually booked into monotel while on travel visit to kol. Now, I wil neither visit myself nor will recommend any one to RDB Dhaba, rather will let people know if you want to be humiliated and want to subject yourself to poor services,  ZDB dhaba is the best place.

Right beside millennium city at sector 5, RDBD has been serving very good north indian food for some time now. Much better than the erstwhile Azad Hind Dhaba. Chicken tandoori,bhetki fish kabab,dahi malai kababs are cooked to perfection. Meanwhile, on the main course, tandoori roti,chicken butter masala,palak paneer,mashroom mattar masala, even the chicken chaanp tastes awesome ! Wish their dessert spread was a little better. A definite 4 !

In Sector V you will find all brands of fast food joints and caf√©. But if you're looking for a full fledged meal you have limited options. And out of those options the best one maybe this one. Locate just at the corner of college more this a well decorated dhaba with food that is sure to satisfy your taste bud. However it can be little heavy on the pocket. But a money well spent.

If you are in sector 5 and hungry, craving for north indian delicacy at affordable prices with good, crazy ambience and proper timely service - you should ask for this place. Be it non-veg or veg, the food quality, taste are amazing and remind you of the old small Punjabi restaurants which are now practically non-existent. Each time we visit, we feel excited watching the tractor, wheels, kettle, etc all over the place. The staff is courteous but do not expect a restaurant like service but a dhaba like where you need to ask for everything you want. Still would give a good rating based purely on food.

Finally got a place with 'all good' stuff. This is a restro in the heart of sector 5. The name is very catchy so does the interior decoration. With the attendant open the door you will see a TRACTOR in front of you in spite of getting it outside like our traditional roadside dhaba. The food was as tasty as its environment. We have tried malai kebab, paratha, naan and chicken karai. Their servings in stainless steel plates was really different. In desert kulfi faluda was also good. The best part is that it is worthy for your money..

This is my most favourite place for north indian food. I absolutely love the food from this place. I have had food delivered from this place as well as dined in. Both experiences have never failed me. 

The dal tadka is the best of the lot. Other must tries are the tandoori aloo butter masala and paneer tikka butter masala. When u are dining in please also try the bhayankar thanda masala thumbs up and soda shikanji. Even the rolls are delicious if u want something on the go.

Their decor is amazing, the food is absolutely great and the prices are okay. Two thumbs up for this place.

Lunch from Rang De Basanti dhaba was quite a pleasant surprise for us. We ordered mutton biryani, chicken biryani, chicken tikka butter masala, chicken bharta and mutton kosha. They took less than an hour to prepare and deliver everything from sector 5 to rajarhat, which was definitely a thumbs up for us. Now coming to the food... the side dishes were excellent.... specially the tikka butter masala was too tasty! The biryani was a tad bit better than average, less spicy but not dry at all. The mutton was soft and well-cooked. And it's pocket friendly as well. Overall, the food was good and comforting... and that's what matters the most, right?

Rang de Basanti Dhaba‚Äôs delicacies 

If you are looking for a perfect veg and non veg eating destination Rang de Basanti Dhaba situated in DN-37 sector -5, Salt Lake, Kolkata, can be your stop then. The restaurant‚Äôs mouth watering delicacies are simply irresistible. A plate of palak paneer with malai kofta was something to drool over. The restaurant has a whopping list of paneer items. As I love chicken, I ordered cheese and pees pulao teeming up with dhaba chicken curry and Punjabi chicken kali mirch. Not to forget our very own chingdi malai curry which is quite popular dish of the restaurant. With that I also tasted Bhetki fish tikka. Begalis meal is incomplete without side dish so I ordered plain dahi and kachumber salad. And off course for desert I preferred Gulab Jamun and Kulfi faluda. Lastly I chose from the array of beverages my favourite desi masala chaanch. It was a complete meal at reasonable price.

We chose to try out the dhaba post midnight on saptami this year and any one familiar with pujo fervour knows the crowds. Outstanding food - keema matar was delicious and the nimbu soda ( banta) yummy.  So many places including star restraunts get food and service wrong when crowded but this place just delivered fab food to 4 hungry but demanding adults at that unearthly hour. Would come back for more...

At a proper location and no problem parking makes it more lovable

RDBD, as the name suggests this place has given a vintage appeal to its ambiance with vintage posters of ads like that of 5 star, Lizzat papd, Amul butter, Bollywood masteros along with its different lighting and sitting arrangement. The old tractor greets you the moment you enter the place and the restaurant ¬†gives us good vibes with its bright lights, soft music and comfortable chairs with cushions. The menu is a typical dhaba one with a lot many non-veg starter options. We tried out the tandoori chicken, fish tikka and hariyali kebabs out of which the fish tikka just took away the championship crown as the best starter in the menu. Do make sure you try out the jaljira in those small jars which makes the whole experience of drinking the simple drink a refreshing one. For main course we tried out the chicken bharta which was decent in taste along with tandoori rotis and butter naan. Overall this place is a good one when it comes out to hanging out with friends late in the night along with loads of food as well as loads of things to discuss.

We had ordered for authentic punjabi khana, that is, butter naan, masala kulcha, chicken bharta, tandoori chicken, punjabi chicken kali mirch, masala papad, etc etc. I loved every bit of it and my tummy was smiling. ???? I would be going back to this place sooner than you think. I love punjabi! Everything! Haha.

This place was Azad Hind Dhaba, now redesigned and changed to Rang De Basanti Dhaba. Very easy to locate since you can spot it as soon as you enter Sector-5 Salt Lake City. Noisy and always filled, this is a non vegetarians delight. You have the option to park your car and gorge on rolls or sit inside and eat.

Dahi Ke Kebab, stunner, soft and will literally melt in your mouth. Best when had hot.

Murgh Malai Tikka has some cheese coating. Some may not like it. Otherwise the kebab is fantastic. Good quality chicken, soft and juicy inside, makes you crave for more.

Among gravy items, my favorite is Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala. Creamy and non spicy gravy. Perfect for your kulcha or naan.

Punjabi Chicken Kali Mirch is average.

We also tried Jeera Rice and Yellow Dal Fry. This is a nice combo.

Hari Mirch ki Roti was something unique. As the soft roti is laced with hot chilli. It tastes good with butter masala gravy since it gives the extra tinge.

Staff is courteous and service is fast.

One bad thing is that the washrooms are not so clean. It may be because of the huge rush during Durga Puja.

Prices are economical compared to azad hind or balle balle dhaba.

Cost 4/5

Ambiance 2.5/5

Quantity 4/5

Quality 4/5

I was waiting to visit this joint ever since it opened its doors and finally did so around mid-July this year. We were on one of our many evening drives around Salt Lake and Rajarhat (out of context: Rajarhat roads have become extremely dangerous and accident-prone these days. Please avoid if you are not a capable driver and DEFINITELY DO NOT SPEED. Be careful.) and decided to stop for a bite in front of RDBD. The place was SO beautiful from the outside that I BEGGED my friends to get out of the car and go inside but they refused so I had to stay put as well, because it would be pointless to go in alone.

The server came to our car window and we ordered a variety of kebabs: Chicken Hariyali kabab (or was it harabhara? I forget), Chicken Tikka kebab and Chicken Tangri kebab. Alongside we ordered fresh lime soda and phirni. The fresh lime soda was made the way I had directed them to: not too sweet. I love how it came in a glass bottle with a straw: a nice little detail. The kebabs were succulent and tasty. It was my first time eating Hariyali kebab (harabhara?) and I thought it was pretty good. But the real hero of the day was the Phirni.¬† It was a day of firsts for me, as I had phirni for the first time on that day, and may I say, I was BOWLED OVER. If only I knew what I was missing all these days! I have since had phirni in a variety of other places, but I would definitely go back for the one at RDBD. 

I have no idea about the prices, because I didn't pay (I barely ever pay. Free food, yay), but they seemed reasonable enough on the menu card. I would definitely go back to sit inside, and try some of their main course dishes. Improvement on the service is needed.

Dal tadka was was also good. Butter chicken was superlative and it reminded me of Moti mahal restaurant in Delhi, which is famous for butter chicken. It was not too heavy on pocket. overall, we loved the food. now i am looking forward to going to eat in this restaurant again.

I have not eaten out a lot in Kolkata, but I did like this place.

The restaurant is done in a very Dhaba style with wooden bench and tables placed closely together.¬†
The tractor placed inside the restaurant adds a rustic feeling to the place.¬†

The food was good... we ordered some starters... Dal and Paneer and rotis.

I liked the way jaljeera and Shikanji was served in glass jars instead of glasses.¬†

The service was fairly quick and the staff helpful.

We ate a simple meal that included butter naan tandoori chicken in kebab gravy and masala kulcha.

1. Masala kulcha maida was raw in some parts. Uneven cooking
2. The chicken gravy was quite tasty little on the sweeter side, but it geled well with my pallete. Basically if you want some of kebabs...in gravy....anything you order will have the same gravy. The two are cooked separetly and then mixed. Thats a separate section of order in their menu card. However of the two chicken pieces , one was terrible smelling. The chiclen piece was old and had an almost rotten smell.

Let me start off by saying that in Durga Puja season, Kolkata restaurants need to have double the staff. Which this place did not have. Half the staff was looking overworked & frustrated.
For starters the Chicken tikka was overcooked & extremely spicy, which made me order another fresh lime. (Personally spicy not preferred)
The Dilli Butter Masala was ok, naan was too.
Ambiance & decoration was better than the food itself. 
Bill was 950/-.
P.S.- Be sure to try the Mitha paan outside.

Ok, so first of all, this review is for the Rang De Basanti Dhaba inside the Diamond Plaza Mall near Dum Dum. The inside is really cool with an awesome ambiance. The dishes and cutlery were not made of plastic or melamine but of metallic nature. We ordered butter tandoori rotis and a peas and cheese pulao. Also, we took dhaba chicken and mutton kasha. The service was a little slow, but acceptable. The food was delicious and lick-tastic!!! The food quantity was decent and the chicken gravy was mouthwatering. After that, we ordered a couple of lassis. The lassi was served in a glass bottle. Overall, I'd say this place is worth visiting. And the prices are really cheap.

Durga puja means all night pandal hopping and hogging in odd hours of the night and the best place to eat are usually the dhaba's in Kolkata. Hence we visited rang de bansanti Dhaba yesterday night at around 2:30am . The food was delicious and freshly cooked and hot. The palak paneer and the keema  matar was the star of the night. And deliciously hot and fresh tandoori roti. Yummmyyyyy . It was perfect.

I being a regular at the place was pained and am not going there again but would still expect the persons concerned to see that no such incidents happen at the once favorite place of mine. this rating is becaz of the service and not for the food

This food joint amidst the tall offices and building stands boldly, everything of this place is nice, the guys taking food order are really well mannered. 
Now talking of the food, the dishes are really delicious, indian punjabi style food is served here delightfully.
The quantity of main course dishes can surely serve a couple of voracious foodie if not three. 
The pricing of starter items can be claimed to be a bit high,but the awesomely delicious taste is definitely an equalizer.
The decor of the place has been kept minimal, it is a bright place and the feeling of fields of punjab shows inside the place, the seating arrangements are carefully made allowing even 6 to 8 people to sit together.

You would seriously enjoy your food here at any time of the day. :-)

Had been here wid my frndzzz and seriously it was indeed a well taken decision.... Afta a long tym had the flavours and essence offff dhaba food.. Whether u have ordered veg or non-veg u wont regret for anything because the taste was just top notch.... Just a little complain, don't make ppl wait for such a long time..

Easier to spot than to miss, RDBD lies right on the outskirts of Sector V; a two-minute drive from the Salt Lake EE Block Petrol Pump.¬†

First off, It is a SPACIOUS restaurant and the eponymous theme of the restaurant covers every inch of the place. It is brightly lit and primarily yellow, with inverted milk cans instead of lamp shades, framed pictures of the quirky kind on the wall and one large Mahindra tractor near the front door for all your 'selfie' purposes.¬†

Secondly, the tables for two were barely large enough to hold two plates together and allow you elbow space. When we arrived, most of the deserted tables still required cleaning after their previous occupants had left. The chairs had a poor excuse for cushions. Instead of the spongy seats, I would rather much sit on the bare wooden seats.¬†

Thirdly, the service is of the worst kind. It is worse than all your nightmares about getting a table during Durga Pujo in Kolkata put together. The groans of all the fellow customers were reverberating across the room. The servers always seemed to be in a rush but no one could fathom why since none of the tables were taken care of. Even the glasses of water were unclean and the water muddy. I overheard a couple of waiters egging each other to take new customers as neither was willing to do so. My parents and I were ravenously hungry; so I assured them that the food would more than make up for it.

Our order consisted of:

(1) Butter Naan: We ordered three at first and then two. The first time, we were served thin, burnt bread with overcompensating doses of butter. The next time, we were served fluffy, fresh and soft bread glazed with butter.

(2) Punjabi Di Dal Makhani: It was the sweet yet tangy flavours of the Dal served up in a handi with a generous dollop of butter in the middle that made my parents drool.¬†

(3) RDBD Boneless: I could finish more than one Handi of this. It was slightly burnt (which I liked), delectable and perhaps RDBD's only saving grace for me.

Excluding tax, the meal cost 600 bucks and it did pinch our pockets because we were fuming at the falling standards of the place. At one point, I found myself wishing the doorman would leave his job and help the servers.

p.s. Yes, I would go back to the place because they did not compromise on the generosity found only in the rich, buttery food of the north Indian community.

Rang de basanti dhaba has a typical village like ambience with tractor at the entrance and lights , seats all seems to have a village influence ! Food was a bit above average , delayed service be it for serving food or delivering the bill, overall a nice visit ! But should be avoided if you prefer quick service!

I went to have my lunch with my Punjabi foodie to treat him Kolkata's food. His reply was satisfying though not great. We ordered Dahi ke kabab, fish amritsari, dal makhni and paneer butter masala. Both of us loved 'Dahi ke kabab' the most. It tasted amazing. Done in a lazawab way. For me, dal makhni was nice too though 'He' felt its okay, not unusual. Paneer was good also.
what I loved the most is their decor. A tractor in the heart of 'officepara', the lighting in milk cans and the funny phrases, all looked great. Practically, the restaurant reminded me as a piece of land from 'Punjab'.
We had Rang de Cola and Lassi also. I loved the cola most. try dahi ke kabab.
I would love to go there again.

I have always driven past this restaurant with big letters of RDBD in bright yellow neon lamp in front of it... but neva got a chance to step into. So one night after a tiring day at the ofc I and my friend decided to step into and give it a try. The restaurant is pretty big with lotsa vacnt seats ..which was obvious coz it was a Thursday.. but once we gT seated I was surprised to see many ppl coming in and the place getting filled up quickly.. the walls wer decorated with small portraits ranging from sholay pics to vinod khanna ... to lines like "hum bohot butter maalish karte hain " :p ... so much so the men's washroom had "gabbar" and women's as "basanti" written on the door. 
Comin to food..we wer on a veg menu and i wasnt very impressed with it. But i was surprised with the taste of the food which was really good.. the dahi ke kabab and stuffed mushroom wer really good...main course consisted of butter nan rumali roti malai kofta and paneer do pyaza...all of them yumm. What impressed me was the nan and rumali did nt become hard after being left fr sometime which happens most of the time in other restaurants.. blame it on preparation. All in all a good dinner with per head cost of 500 bucks.. worth it i say !!

Though situated in my 'office-para' ..... my¬† first visit to Rang De Basanti was not on a normal office weekday ..... rather it was on a weekend i.e saturday ...and that too at dinnertime ...... had come from home just to taste their cuisine ........ actually i was never a fan of the previous restuarant in the same place i.e Azad Hind Dhaba .....maybe thats the reason why my first visit to RDB was a bit late ...... 
Newayz ..... few things about the restuarant when u enter ........ there are several wall hangings or frames with different pictures/writings with content ranging from filmstars to hilarious writings , which contribute to the theme of the restuarant ...... infact the washrooms too had 'Gabbar' and 'Basanti' written on the respective doors instead of 'Boys' and 'Girls'¬† :P ...... the last page of menu had a writing in punjabi ,it was something like - 'kee dekh rahe ho ...sadaa menu to khatam' :) ....... overall ambience was good .... the only thing that mattered to me was the tables and chairs ..... they were so ordinary and made the restuarant look like a government canteen ..... though one can argue that this is in accordance to the theme of the restuarant , but i would differ ....newayz thats a personal opinion .......
Now coming to food ....... we ordered chicken hariyali tikka ...... taste was good ....... the biriyani is so-so ....nothing great ...... infact acc to me, alibaba's biriyani is better ....... but one item that stole my heart was chicken bharta ...... actually it was referred to me by one of my colleagues ...... i just loved it .......the taste matches the likes of what u get in Hanglatherium ....... i think they should promote it as one of their signature dishes ........ i am willing to visit rdb again just for the chicken bharta ..........¬† 
Overall i would say that its a mixture of good and avg in terms of quality ...... the price ,considering the food they serve, is slightly on the higher side i would say ......

My and my friend decided to visit the place. 
Decor: It has a huge tractor decorated by light. Spacious. But the tables were not too clean.
The staffs were just ok
Food: We had ordered chkn biriyani n boondi raita. the biriyani was just barely warm, the chkn was just ok. there was also a tiny potato. Unfortunately it was hard in the middle n kind of black. I was totally dissapointed. The raita was nothing spcl. boondi, raita n chat masala on top.
Conclusion: I wouldnt b too interested to go there twice. the food was very average, the kinfd of biriyani served on roadside stalls.
note: they gave us a food coupon, which i discovered, to my horror was already expired!! nothing more to say

Okay! So I have not eaten inside but just had rolls and cola from the outside joint. I dont even know if I am supposed to write this but I would write anyway since I have a story to tell!



So last week we had an interview near this place which started early and got over around 8:30pm. Hungry and late for home we were so we quickly ordered chicken rolls from here and ate at the pretty wooden tables outside. Yes you are allowed to sit on them and have your food. We did not not find a bin and even left out wrappers on the table which the guard said was fine! You have to pay the bill at the outside counter, present the slip at the food station and they provide you the rolls. The only problem that our food had was too much of sweet sauce! Yes we were asked if they would put in sauce and we agreed and that was a mistake. The sauces are extremely sweet so next time when you order roll, avoid sauce. 



So after we finished our food, we got off and started walking towards college morr and it was around 9. Suddenly we heard somebody calling us from behind and we turned around to find a man from the dhaba with the wallet of A. She left her wallet at the table, along with all the roll wrappers and they found, came running with it. It was extremely sweet of them! All the little complains about the sauce disappeared and I would give this place full marks!



Next day we had the final round of the interview and we had rolls again along with masala cola. Quite a pleasant experience! Although we made sure this time there was no sauce in out rolls

A sprained leg....a bunch of happy friends.....chilled beer.....long drive....rajarhat...country music....hot piping food from rang de basanti...friday night. What else do you need to be happy! Chilled beer, good food, music and friends are a deadly drug to kill the pain of a sprained ankle. Coming to the food, we ordered Mutton Rara, Butter Roti and Green Salad.¬†

The Rotis were resting peacefully in a pool of butter. So what we gluttons did was, we dunked the rotis in the butter that settled peacefully in the plate before we could savor its taste. The taste was stupendous, so much so that I could just have butter rotis with beer. Well, when mutton rara is enticing you with its aroma, the chopped onions caressing the pieces will surely make you lust over the dish all the more, you can actually go green with envy over the fine pieces of onion and remove them to just stay bedazzled with the dish. The gravy was made with keema and the spices of the keema managed to pave its way inside the supple mutton pieces giving this dish its flavor, this can let loose a million butterflies in your tummy ( if that helps in adding more space to your tummy then bingo). My appetite increased by a zillion to have more rotis ( dunking them in butter is a must) with the mutton along with crates of beer settling happily in my lap. Alas if only the clock did not strike 10, the party could have continued.¬†

A note - I'll be back soon for more of mutton rara with chilled beer!

As promised and suggested by RDBD management visited the restaurant to try some of their specialties.
We ordered Dilli Ki Butter Chicken, Hari Mirch Ki Roti, Laal Mirch Ka Paratha, Garlic Naan, Sweet Lassi and Rang De Cola.
Indeed the best butter chicken I had in recent past. The roti and paratha were so unique but liked roti the most in these two. Also went ahead to try my all time favorite Garlic Naan. To me this is the best Garlic Naan I ever had. One strange thing I noticed that the waiter was discouraging us to order Laal Mirch Ka Paratha saying its not that great while the RDBD management is claiming this as one of their specialties. Has some disconnect looks to me.We washed these down by Sweet Lassi and Rang De Cola. We already seen the unique way of serving the same in small bottles buy management needs to be careful in replacing the bottles which as chipped sharp edges. This can be harmful for someone.We were so happy and satisfied that we went ahead and order take away for evening party at my place.
Opted for Murgh Malai Tikka, Stuffed Mushroom Tikka, Dahi Ke Kebab, Mutton Boti Din Raat, Mutton Rarra and Phirni.
The Murgh tikka just melted in my mouth once popped in. Highly recommended. Mutton boti has unique way of presentation and amazing taste. Dahi ke Kebab is still fond in my memory. However without my expectation the twist in the tale was mutton rarra and phirni. Mutton Rarra gravy has pieces of crushed bone in the gravy which hurt myself and my guests. Flesh pieces were though and rubbery too. The phirni katori was not washed properly and while eating one will feel taste of mud with the phirni. Very disappointing and disgusting from health stand point.Health and safety of guests should be biggest priority of the RDBD management. Hence reducing my overall rating down from 4 to 3.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------

On my way back home I stopped by to pick up tardka and roti. Initially was sceptical to try this as was carrying previous impression of Azad Hind Dhaba. But on checking it closely found that with change in name they have improved on ambiance, sitting arrangement and courteous staffs.
Coming to food the Egg Tardka tasted great and quantity was enough for 2 adults. Tandoori Roti was soft enough even after 3hours. Parcelled and foiled properly. 
Will review other dishes soon on the next visit which will be pretty soon.

What could have been a gastronomic delight for people who love typical north Indian food turns out to be a disaster owing to the shoddy management and careless attitude of the staff.....Kolkata goes off to sleep pretty fast and if someone craved for some calorie laden Punjabi food,this joint was the perfect answer....but the taste & quality of food served is not consistent....however inspite of all this one still witnesses packed hours and that bears testament to the fact that salt lake lacks quality food joints....its high time a foodpreneur wakes up and hits the latent demand for quality food at flexible hours.....RDB guys really need to discipline their staff before it leads to empty chairs in the restaurant which I doubt cause kolkattans are pretty cool with sub standard service....

The dilli ka butter chicken with a few kulchas is a perfect combo!!! 
Their lassi was too sweet.
I also tried their tandoori aloo and tangri kebab.. Tangri was two grilled chicken legs. Really good.
Chicken reshmi butter masala had a yellowish gravy and very good!
This is a really good place to eat at if u want those yummy north Indian flavors. Be prepared for a heavy one though..
Fyi the kulchas are too much flour too less filling. Could be made better.

This was the old Azad hind which used to be a hit in sector 5 area but I don't know whether I can say that its better now as Rang de basanti or lost its charm as it used to be Azad hind cause certain factors are really impressive but some things arnt really keeping the standards as for This dhaba it has a fantastic outlook with everything giving you a feel of modern Punjabi dhaba  and lots of wacky lines and filmy dialogues to set your mood right . Now let's come to the eating part ,well its not exceptionally good so I would say just fine food nothing great infact gone down ever since azad hind has lost its name .
My verdict - On the higher side but quantity of food is good so you can experience it sometime

Was crossing the place with a friend , was bogged down by the sun and the interiors always beckoned me, so just entered at about 4pm. The interiors are fantastic, a themed restaurant for sure. We ordered, Kesar Kulfi and Lassi. Their Gulkand ice cream was already out of stock. The people inside were polite and other customer looked pleased. While we waited for our food, the decor kept us busy... the filmy posters and quirky decor amused us. The milk cans for lighting was a topic for discussion too as well the tractor kept inside! Their Kulfi was goood to taste but felt is was not too cold, it melted quite easily and the lassi was good!! I like falooda a lot so I had instructed to put more falooda and I was happy to see that was executed. Would like to visit soon to try their saag and paratha and butter chicken.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
After catching NH7 concerts went straight to Rang De basanti for food. Not disappointed like the admin had said. We had chicken bharta, butter naan, paneer tikka, tandoor chicken, dal makhani, masala chai. each item lived up to their aythentic taste and the people serving had a smiling face even at 11;30pm. loved that absolutely!

Nice place.. The setting is pretty good. U can see an original mahindra tractor in the premises.. On the walls one can see posters of old ads..(Salman khan in a Hero CD100 AD etc.)..In short the setting is that of a proper Dhaba in a much more modernised way.. Now coming to food.. It is good nothing out of the world.. Do try the chefs recommendation like Amritsari chole, kurkuri Bhindi, Butter Chicken Delhi style, RDBD chicken Bharta etc..The waiters are quite helpful and courteous... In drinks Masala Chanch, Zaljeera and Lassi are Good. Try the Rang de Cola if u like a drink with a difference..

This was another Azad Hind Dhaba near College More, Sector 5. I used to have food very often here. One fine day, I see they changed the name to Rang De Basanti. I thought of trying it out, so I did. My personal favourites of Azad Hind is Tandoori Chicken for starters, Dal, Nan Roti and Mutton Keema for main course. I tried the same here, and was very pleased. The food tastes better than the previous Azad hind. the entire restaurant looks really different and I love their decor.
Recently went out with my friend to have just desserts. Tried out their kulfi, and Lassi. They give the lassi in milk bottles, which I found very funny. The waiters behave very politely. Their overall presentation is pretty decent.

Visited this place on the night of EID. Ambience is nice. Theme & decor is good. Service is not upto the mark. Even overheard the waiters fighting with each others. Tried Dilli wali chicken > quantity is great in portion & tastes good. Butter-Naan s > looks like fried papad & not even resembles to the image of an ideal naan like that of arsalan's & others. Kadai chicken is just crap. Wanted to cook myself some kadhai chicken & let them know how actually it shud be!!! Fresh lime soda was good (may be there is nothing there to mess up with as my friends say!!!). But, overall a good place to hangout with friends or family till late night coz its open till 2 a.m. where the real advantage lies.

Azad Hind dhaba at college more is now Rang de Basanti Dhaba. The interior is quite interesting now as it has a punjabi feel but then the quality of food has deteriorated enormously over the last few months. The kababs are hard and either too salty or no salt at all. The biryani tastes average and the other side dishes are mostly salt less. I do not know what is the problem but last couple of times i visited i had the same complain of no salt in the food. I do not find it worth going to RBD again as the pinch in the pocket is felt after tasting a below average range of food here.

All the points that I gave here is due to the decor. This place has the same staff as the previous AHD that was present here which was a very bad example of Punjabi food... and now this. The decor I must say is very good and worth staring at with hurricanes for lampshades,etc.
But the food... gosh it was horrible. The mutton was almost raw and it tasted nowhere like what it was promised. When we asked the waiter that we are unable to even tear the pieces off with our teeth, hands and may be couple of more things at disposal, the waiter apologizes, takes back the dish and brings the same thing back only with more gravy and a worse taste.
Need I write more !!!
But I generally dont let my review be marred by one single dish, but in ths case the Chicken Bharta was anything but bharta.
Only the Rang De Cola is worth mentioning

My high rating of 4.5 is a careful combination of 'feel at punjab' and 'food of punjab'

'Feel at Punjab' - Rang De Basanti Dhaba or RDBD as it is popularly called is a place to go even when your are feeling low. Because the warmth of the place, its bright ambiance, careful and appropriate placing of things related to the Punjabi feel will elate you! A bright yellow and red coloured tractor with LEDs on its tyres is placed at the entrance and is an instant hit with kids. The milk/oil cans used earlier hanged as a part of the lighting system, the walls decorated with funny and hilarious bollywood dialogues and punjabi quotes, the washrooms have 'pital ka patila' as basin and the toilets are designated as 'Gabbar' & 'Basanti' for obvious references!

'Food of Punjab' - the quality and quantity of the food served were amazing! 3-4 average eaters like me can enjoy a particular dish. The vegetarian food ordered goes like this:
- Panner Tikka (Soft, juicy, fine flavours)
-  Kashmiri Aloo Dum (Less spicy, not very sweet like served in many restaurants, good choice)
- Paneer Butter Masala (As good as it gets)
- Punjab di Dal Makhani (I judge a place heavily on the quality of Dal Makhani served as I am a die hard fan of it. This place served an authentic Dal Makhani which had strong flavours, perfect consistency and somewhat heavy, which a Dal Makhani should be!)
- Garlic Naan (Too strong a flavour of garlic! But then it is a garlic naan)
- Butter Naan (Ok ok types)
- Jeera Rice (Nice, greasy enough not to choke your throat :) )
- Fresh Lime Soda Sweet (I deliberately mentioned an item like this to bring out the importance of the flavour added to a simple Fresh Lime Soda - its was superb! Served in a bottle)

Staff - This is one of the highlighting points of this place, courteous, quick and responsive staff!

Cost - Around Rs 1000 for 2 people but considering the quantity served, it will come to 1200-1500 for 4 people.

We ordered the kadhai paneer and butter naan with the Chicken Biryani Paneer was too tomatish and biryani was aslo not great. We specifically asked for a leg piece chicken but that wasnt served... Service was lathargic...not a great experience..

I have been attempting to try Rang De Basanti for a very long time, when a nice little girl from our office offered to treat us there. Yay ! :D
We went for a delivery at our place, and our menu included:
Garlic Naan
Palak Paneer
Chicken Bharta 
Mutton Rara and
Cheese Peas Pulao.
The delivery was swift, nicely packaged, spoons and use & throw plates were supplied on request, although all of it was chargeable, but still all the facilities were available promptly. I was quite impressed by their quick service, it did not allow our hungry souls to suffer much. 
The Garlic Naan was attacked first, and it went great with the Palak Paneer. I felt the Naan was good but had it been a little more warm, the flavour of butter and garlic together would have been heavenly.The Bharta was for the sweeter people and tasted ok, but Palak was better. Next came the cheese peas pulao, basically paneer and peas, but tasted best among all the items, this one is a must must try over here, With the mutton Rara it was the perfect combo. Now this Mutton Rara, I thought to be spicy and coming in pieces (4) and that is exactly what the man taking order claimed. Now it was definitely spicy but turned out to be shredded mutton. Anyways everything was fine, when on the verge of concluding our meal a hawk eyed girl among us pointed out something on one of her mutton piece, guess what, It was the Hair of the mutton, I mean a small piece of pathetic Black Hair/Fur of mutton still hanging with a piece of skin on the flesh of the mutton !!!!!!
After this discovery all us quickly turned vegetarian and finished our rice with Palak, safely !
The food overall was really good, in fact one of the best Punjabi food I have had in a long time, Had this hairy issue not been revealed my rating would have been more than 4, but neither can I accept this fallacy nor does the hairy view of the mutton would delete from my mind.
Please take care of this things in the future, when a customer pays for food from a reputed place like yours, hygiene is the minimum they deserve, that you can offer.

¬´¬´Second Review¬ª¬ª

Location: Near College More, Sector 5, Saltlake.

As informed in the first review, it's quite near to my workplace and thus called for a takeaway again¬†(Will be dropping by for a dine-in experience soon).

This time as well it took the office boy nearly twenty minutes to¬†bring the food back to the workplace.
My order consisted of the following:

Special Dal Tarka
It was absolutely delicious!
Black lentils perfectly simmered overnight and flavoured nicely. Topped with a drizzle of cream.
Highly recommended.
-Have always (at other places) preferred this particular dish over the usual Dal Makhani, and RDBD is no exception.

Rumali Roti
Was soft. Did not turn leathery even after it went cold. Happy.

Garlic Naan
Was average.
A little more baking in the tandoor would have rendered the raw garlic to cook well.
Apart, from the above negative, the bread was thin and the right amount of garlic was used.
-Suggestion: Top the bread with finely chopped coriander along with garlic and the whole bread would level up in terms of flavor. :) ¬†Was missing in my bread. :(
Kindly look into the perfect cooking of the garlic. Nail the dish leaving no flaws. :)

Onion Salad
Nothing special about the salad. Fresh onions cut into rounds, sprinkled with pepper or chat masala packed along with a couple of green chillies and slices of lemon.
Fresh Salads compliment your food that adds up to your overall experience.

-Portion size was generous.

Pocket friendly costs.

A good experience again.
Would have rated 4.5, but, deducted 0.5 due to the Garlic Naan.
-Would visit it soon for a dine-in experience and the management recommendations are yet to be tried. Comments due.

¬´¬´First Review¬ª¬ª

Location: Near College More, Sector 5, Saltlake.

Being very near to my workplace, had called for a takeaway from this restaurant.
Had sent an office boy to get the food. It took around twenty minutes for the office boy to bring the food back to the workplace, so speculating about the service time for the dine-in would be a bit less.
We were two in number and had ordered for the following:

Dal Makhani
The black lentils were perfectly boiled mixed along with kidney beans parboiled upto 85%. The spices were well-balanced and the whole dish was nicely made.
Tasted good, and a personal preference of a few drops of lemon made it taste great!

Paneer Butter Masala
Disappointed.
The Paneer cubes were a bit chewy and the gravy lacked the flavours and the little flavor it had, couldn't take it's toll as the whole dish lacked salt.
-Wish this dish is taken care of and the flavours are improved.

Butter Naan
The Naan was soft and thin, and complimented the Dal well.

Masala Kulcha
The filling was flavourful and was made quite nicely. The Kulcha was thick & well-tandoored.
-I could eat it without even pairing it along with anything else. :-P

-Portion sizes were generous. Good enough for three heads.

The pricing wasn't much of a pinch.

Loved the food except the Paneer!
Was a good experience.
-Would visit it soon for a dine-in experience. Comments due.

We went for a team lunch from office last weekend to RDB. The interiors are cheerful and fun. The tractor is definitely an added attraction. For starters, we'd opted for the chicken lasuni kebab, mutton sheekh kebab, dahi ke kebab, and achari chicken tikka. The mutton kebab was really yummy and so was the dahi ke kebab. The latter was something I had for the first time, and it sure was a very nice experience. It had layers of curd inside the patty and tasted delicious! However, consistency wise, one of my colleagues got one in which the outer patty was a bit undercooked. The chicken kebabs were standard ones we get elsewhere. I didn't find anything extraordinary.
For main course we had taken lal mirch ka paratha, hari mirch ki roti, naan, mutton rogan josh and dilli ka butter chicken. I found the starters more promising than the main course. The rogan josh was tasty, though quantity wise pretty less. I did not like the butter chicken. the taste was overcome with spices and somehow didn't appeal to me. The roti/prathas were innovative and pretty spicy! I had taken a salted lassi which was so good that I ordered for one more. 
Overall, the service was good but food wise I found RDB pretty average and price wise over average!

Visited the place few months back....but still remember the awesomely delicious food served. Not a very old outlet and I was searching for eateries nearby for lunch with my family, when we came across this and decided to get in n experiment. Was delighted by the varied items in the menu and affordable prices. The decor of the place is really charming and soothing....giving u a typical dhaba wali feeling....I luved it being a PUNJABAN :)  Service is okay. Finally the food arrived and relieved our empty stomachs. Ordered 3-4 Dishes of Chiken n all were good.....The Naan is well made....serving of the food is nice and the Masala Chaas ordered was truly well made...well served and was a great end to our meal. Keep up the good work but there's still scope of improvement. Will Visit Again for sure !!! :)

PROS:-

1) Good ambiance,nice decor and staffs are well behaved.
2) We ordered mutton rarra ,and that was really tasty. One should try this. 
3) biryani was ok and the peas polao was kind of ok.
4) The sweet lime soda was also kinda ok.

CONS:-

1) The chicken kadhai was pathetic. Do not try. 
2) The main negative point that I have found was the time that they take to serve the food.It will piss you off for the time they take to serve the food.

We ordered:-

Chicken biryani
Naan roti
Mutton rarha
Chiken kadhai
Peas polao
Chicken curry
Sweet lime soda

It was this year's Holi when me and my friend were trying to look for a new place to have our Holi lunch at, when Rang De Basanti Dhaba caught my attention. It was a revamped restaurant at the same place where our very own Azad Hind Dhaba once used to be in Sector 5. The moment you enter the restaurant the look and feel of it would make you thank yourself for choosing the place. To give the place a typical Dhaba feel there is a huge yellow tractor parked inside and the walls have graffiti written and sketched in Punjabi along with some nice wall-hangings.. now coming to the most important part.. FOOD. We first ordered the Holi Special Thandai and Lassi, followed my some Tandoori Chicken. For the main course we ordered the Laal Mirch Masala Paratha( as recommended by the staff), Garlic Naan, Dilli Ka Butter Chicken and Kadhai Paneer. They all tasted really good. The service of the staff was equally good. A nice place with good food and ambiance and the best part remains the affordable price menu. Would surely re-visit  and try out their other delicious offerings!!

I went there with my family and we ordered my all time favorite chicken tandoor butter masala,chicken bharta, malai kofta, kaali daal, pea & mushroom masala along with masala kulcha, garlic naan and zeera rice. The taste was wonderful and the quantity was pretty adequate. I didn't like their service much but it was OK.
The chicken tandoor masala was just awesome!!!
You must visit this place at least once for the ambiance which is quite good and different and mast wala food

If there was any rating below 1, I would have given that......I along with some group of friends, did catch up around 10:30pm for dinner post a movie at RDB. We went & waited fo someone to attend us for the first 5 mins & after calling the floor manager finally order was being taken. We ordered for biryaani, which was horrible....too much use of dalda had actually taken the real taste away from the biryaani. The chicken tandoori was half cooked; the tikka kabab was burnt. 
To sum it up, no foodie would come here for experimenting their taste buds, its a place for "no choice" people, if nothing is open, u can come here & compromise on quality.

Rang de basanti dhaba...! Firse lets talk about the decor. Its fresh, its new its amazing. They have placed a tractor too at the front door which gives it a more punjabi feel. They have placed all the funny quotes from bollywood movies in the walls which is again pretty nice. Now food..!  Its very less likely to get a good mughlai biriyani at a punjabi restaurant... But this place would not fail to surprise you.... The mutton biriyani we had was really really good. Not the best... But one of the best. Chicken tikka Masala was a little on the sweeter side for me... But wasn't bad either. Overall experience was good.

An outlet very close to office, I visited it two-three times post the makeover from AHD to RDBD and I would say I am really disappointed with the overall service. The waiters and all barely pay attention to the customers sitting. You actually have to remind them that they need to take ur order. The service too is really slow. It takes almost ages for the food to be delivered.

But my most surprising experience came when I ordered them for Fresh Lime Water. They said its not available. I showed them that Fresh Lime Soda is available in the menu. The reply was fresh lime soda is available, fresh lime water isnt. I said just replace the soda with water and that should be fine. Sorry sir, thats not possible was the reply. I said charge for the soda but just replace it with water, it would be cheaper for you. But the server did not agree. Finally I gave up. Surprising, such a small customisation wasnt acceptable to them

Ambience is good but for a food lover, this isnt the place. If you are the type who likes trying out new dishes and stuff RDBD isnt for you. Food is really rich which not everyone would like

I really love this place. The food is amazing and the interiors which have been done up are also really good. Earlier it wasn't that good, but now it is aesthetically pleasing. I really like the ambience which is a mixture of a restaurant and a traditional dhaba feel. 

The food as I said, is really very good. The kebabs melt in your mouth.
When we had gone, it was a really hot day so the first thing that we ordered was Lassi. Iy was chilled and tasty. That was what we needed. 

Then we ordered the appetisers. We got Bhetki Fish Tikka, Achari Chicken Tikka, and Tandoori chicken. All the three dishes tasted amazing. The chicken and fish were cooked beautifully and they just melted in your mouth.

For the mains, we ordered Kashmiri Aloo Dum, Dhaba Chicken curry, and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala(one of our regular dishes). We also got Garlic and butter Naans and Masala Kulcha along with Egg Tarka Dal. 

The Kashmiri aloo, Butter Masala and Dal were really good. But the Dhaba Curry wasn't that great. It could have been a lot better. The Masala Kulcha was nice, soft and buttery, but the Naan was a bit hard for our liking. 

Overall, I really loved the place and the food. If you like authentic Punjabi food, this is the place you should visit. 

P.S. The rolls from the Takeaway counter are also really good. Do try them.

An urban dhaba with very good interiors RDBD is a favorite among MNC workers in sector 5. The interiors and the menu is very well designed and a tractor welcomes you inside and is kept as an aritfact. The food is great and they serve golas too. the lime soda we had was served in a nice bottle. Overall a happy place with good food and service and value for money.

This place was right beside my office, and was the erstwhile Azad Hind Dhaba, which had delectable chicken rolls, dal tadka, and Jalebis. Now they have renamed it to Rang De Basanti Dhaba and re-done the decor. It is now bigger and swankier, so thumbs up to that. I have walked into this place post 11pm at night and ordered, which I think was awesome, though service is a tad slow. The kebabs and tandooris are up to the mark. Try their Dilli ka butter chiken and Lal Mirch Masala Paratha - quite unique. And finish it up with a Gulkand icecream. But to truly complete the Dhaba feel, I think they should introduce Chaai (tea).

The ambience is nice and soothing.
Coming to the food section
The tandoori chicken is always a delight.
The thing that impressed me is the marination was excellent and made the chicken taste so good.
As for the main course,
Do try the lal mirchi masala paratha(recommended by a friend)
And the dilli butter chicken.
Nice and cozy place.
Would love to visit again

What a attitude man !! Rang de basanti dhaba..a big NO NO for everyone. I went to this newly renovated dhaba last week with two of my friends on a week day. The first experience was awesome and then went again with a bigger group this time on weekend. Firstly i was not aware that if i dont have a booking, i am not even allowed to enter into this "dhaba" as the security guard told us right on the face that keep standing outside till the time he allows us to enter. In that lovely rainy sunday, all our frnds waited for almost 35 mins and finally entered to dine. As it was crowded, we took the decision to place all the orders together and was waiting for the starters. Till then almost after 20 mins of waiting on the table, the waiter asked us for water which took him another 30 minutes to deliver. Finally waiting for more than 75 mins altogether we finally asked the waiter about our order and found that it has not been prepared till now and would take another 10-15 mins to deliver. The manager standing their seems not interested and was least bothered in his own dreams. We took the decision of leaving the dhaba with a wonderfull taste of mineral water..what a lovely food it was ????????????

Food: If there's one thing I most look forward to in a dhaba it has to be the Chicken Bharta. A little different from the other dhaba's in the city, the chicken bharta took time for me to get used to. However, the second time there I gradually developed a taste for it. An important point here would be that it isn't too spicy. 
Being a hard core non-vegetarian, I was a little hesitant before trying their signature dishes like Kurkuri Bhindi and Dahi key Kabab and even passed over it many times. However, once I tried it there was no going back! I loved it!
Love the fact that the masala cola is served in such cute little bottles and everyone must try their Gulkand ice-cream! 
Ambience: Love the ambience, more spacious and more contemporary than most of the dhaba's around the city. 
Service: The waiters were courteous though the food takes quite a lot of time to arrive every time I'm their

Overall: I definitely recommend this place to people who love dhaba food! Also the fact that they keep adding new dishes to the menu and come up with interesting combos is a good sign of the restaurant making an effort to constantly reinvent themselves! 
P.S: Don't forget to pose on the tractor, which occupies pride of place at the joint!

As we performed our electoral duties in Kolkata today, thought of picking up some authentic Punjabi cuisine from Rang De Basanti Dhaba.... Well it was a rude shock...!!!

At around 21:00 hrs, touch based 03366346084 for a take away, on the other side Mr.Daniel picked up the call, ordered 2 portions each of Egg Tarka Fry and Chicken Bharta accompanied with Indian Breads, the order booked and had assumed it would take not more than a max of 5 minutes of waiting time since most take -away joints in Kolkata have a TAT not more than 10 mins. Well after reaching the joint, had to wait till 21:48 hrs, frustrating enough where no one responds to queries of actual delivery, what was more surprising other take-away customers had to go through the same ordeal, even after speaking to Mr.Sanjib, at the joint, things did not move and a indifferent attitude was displayed. What was more surprising, "home delivery" parcels were given priority and we had to wait endlessly.

The food was equally horrible, quantity questionable and did realise not to experiment!!! Do fondly remember the great food that AHD used to serve, the excellent services that it used to offer and efficiency the cashier's used to display.

Even if you re-model the look and feel of an eating joint, what matters is food, service and customer satisfaction.... A horrible experience indeed and definitely not worth recommending.

I reached there at around 10:30am on Saturday morning. The look and feel of the restaurant both from outside and inside is really good. Outside, there was a banner with list of available breakfast menu:
1) 4 piece Kachori, Aloo Sabji - Rs 40/-
2) Aloo Paratha, Pyaz Paratha, Paneer Paratha, Mixed Paratha - Each Rs 50/- a plate
3) Omlette - Rs 35/-
4) Boiled Anda - Rs 20/-
5) Salted Lassi - Rs 60/-

Inside, the decor look nice (although I felt the rustic feel of Azad Hind Dhaba was missing). They have a large tractor inside to give the dhaba feel. On the wall you can see a large sign saying "Bhayankar" (a declaration that RDBD special Thanda Cola is dangerously good!). There were framed posters of movies where you can see Mr. Bachchan in a biri advertisement and some movies.

As we took our seat, no one came up to take the order! After waiting for 2-3 minutes, I had to signal to the cabin where the manager was sitting and then he called and a young waiter came up. We ordered three plates of Kachori and tea. The prompt response came that tea is not available (really surprising!!). I told him that tea was the primary reason why we came here (Dhaba tea is famous for it's taste) and to check out and see what can be done. 

After around 10-15 minutes the Kachoris were delivered.Again, we had to ask for water and then again for napkins. Seems zero attention is paid to service the guests. The Kachoris were hot and good but the accompanying Aloo Sabji was cold. The achaar was watery and not at all good. Eventually the tea was given and the taste was so bad that we were not able to consume it entirely.

I am not sure what the problem was. Whether it was because it was a Saturday or because it was a breakfast order but this kind of service is definitely something which was not expected. If this prevails, I would suggest the RDBD management close down the breakfast option completely.After paying visit to Dhabas like Sher-e-Punjab and multiple other Dhabas, it is disappointing and RDBD has to go a long long way. Not a good experience and I would seriously consider paying another visit to this place.

I recently visited this for dinner‚Ä¶the overall experience is horrible‚Ä¶extremely poor service, dirty plates, unhygienic and chaotic sitting arrangements, less number of waiters / attendants in comparison with the number of tables / consumers, late service and overall a horrifying experience.. the worst part is that when I ordered for "tandoori roti" they served me on a used plate and when I pointed the problem they simply took the plate and replaced on another plate‚Ä¶..no apology nothing‚Ä¶I brought the issue with the manager and it seems they are least interested on customer satisfaction / delight‚Ä¶
I‚Äôll surely not visit the place and my strong recommendation for the restaurant is a big NO.

To be honest this is an overrated place.
Went with a couple of friends. Ordered paneer butter masala and dal makhani. Both the dishes were decent. Nothing too great. The tandoori roti and rumali roti weren't upto the mark. Infact the rumali roti was a little uncooked :( . We ordered their bhayankar thanda cola (masala pepsi in short) which turned out to be Pepsi with some jaljeera and a strong dash of hing. Nothing bhayankar about that.
Overall decent experience. Very pocket friendly. Staff are courteous and service is reasonably quick. I liked the ambience though.

Food is below avg. Nothing special about food. Interior and decoration is a little above avg with some North Indian Dhaba styling. Lassi! You should try outside the restaurant on the foot... But if you don't have any other option, you con go with Rang De Basanti...

Dear food bloggers ! 

Well to start with let me tell you how this place took me back to my college days ! Rang de basanti dhaba reminds me of the last three years of my life spent in college where we would go out for dinners or luncheons or breakfast or whenever we were hungry . You have those places in your mind where you need to go when there are too many people hungry at one time and each of them can only pay 300 bucks ! This place has been there for like donkey's years but recently they've done it up to something that gives justice to their food . Don't get fooled by the big bright truck inside the place because the food is as bright and robust as it should be in any dhaba ! 
My usual takes are- tandoori chickeen ! One of the best i have had in the city and i think that's like saying a lot ! Then their selection of tikka gravies ! Their kebabs are to die for ! At par with Arsalaan def ! 
Another big dish would be there dal ! The makhni is very very good . Rich and just how it should be . The breads are usually best when consumed fresh anywhere so i am not judging ! Another usual order for me would be the peas pulao ! Something that they do to the rice that makes it so yummy and mouthwatering ! You must try the following -- reshmi butter masala, chicken tikka masala , ALL THE KEBABS , dal makhni , gaaaarlic naaaaan , mutton kasa , gaajar ka halwaaa , kulfi , that cola thing they serve as a beverage --- and before i forget , they have this thing on their menu -- laccha oinions or something . It is really good , one must order this as it is the beat accompaniment to anything you order there !!! Ekdum Chatak! 

Pricing - reasonable . 

Now GO ! 
Happy eaating lovlies :)

This pinches your pocket moderately considering that it is a Dhaba.


The cuisines are excellent and so is the ambiance. But their service sucks big time.
They take more than 30 minutes to give you only a bottle of Pepsi. The food is also equally late in coming to your table.

The food does not have any complaint against it and the Punjabi flavours are amazing.

Do not miss the FIRNI if you visit this place. It is just amazing.

As for paying 50 bucks for a glass of Fresh Lime Water seems just a bit too much.

Ambience: 4.5/5
Food: 4/5
Value for Money: 3/5
Service: 1.5/5


Oh and one more thing, they do not accept SBI Master Cards, in case you plan on paying with that.

Rang de basanti somehow gave me a very Delhi-esque feel for its decor.

Ambiance:
Bustling with people, the first thing that you see in this Dhaba is a gigantic tractor embellished with light. The interior is loud, bright and lively. 

Food:
We started off with Tandoori Chicken and Chicken Malai Tikka. The Tandoori Chicken was moderately spicy and quite tasteful. Coming to the better part, Chicken Malai Tikka was absolutely delectable! The chicken was soft and succulent with a cheesy layer on top which added to its taste. To quench our thirsts, we had ordered a Bhayankar Drink, the name got our attention. Yes. So, the Bhayankar Drink was masala cold drink tasting somewhat like soda and hajmola, a good accompaniment with the food.

For main course we went with the classic Naan and Dal Makhani. While the naan was tasteful the Dal Makhani was average. All in all, the food was just about average. Must Try: Chicken Malai Tikka and Bhayankar Drink.

Service:
They take a really LONG time to serve so go with someone who you can have really long conversations with. The staff is polite otherwise. The prices are okay.

Nice place, nice ambiance, good food. Centrally located, near Sector 5 college more (previously known as Azad Hind dhaba) this is a great place for an office lunch. Tried Biriyani, butter naan, chicken side dishes and kababs, all of them were pretty good. However I did not like the Basanti Thandai much which was a Chefs recommendation.

The rustic feel of the Dhaba which was there in Azad Hind Dhaba is not there. The main attraction is the decor. I went with my family on Saturdy night for Dinner. When we arrived it was almost empty but within 15 minutes the whole place got packed and was bustling. The starters we ordered came within 10 minutes, after which the waiter put on the dinner plates. The main course came nearly 1/2 hour after the dinner plates had been put. Some items which we ordered did not come and the waiter had to be reminded again to bring those items. The waiter taking the order does not suggest anything when asked. Secondly we ordered a veg and 2 rotis again which was served after a long time. Since we had almost finished the food I asked the waiter if the veg can be cancelled to which he answered "No it cannot be cancelled and you have to eat it". This was bought to the notice of the Manager. The food overall was average.

Azad Hind Dhaba Under a New Name. Everything is the same, but I must say, Interiors & Food Quality is Better than the Regular Azad Hing Types. Though not close to a Jai Hind. But With a few more Options It might just be as popular.
Plus Point Opened Late Night.
Food Is Good, If you are a Non Vegetarian then you will love it especially.

It was just an unplanned visit...we were 8 friends and useless to say damn hungry...we ordered  bhuttha seekh kebab and panneer tikka as starter....it was cold and just ok types...for drinks we ordered fresh lime soda which was not cold and there was no ice available...for main course we ordered malai kofta,kali dal and paneer do pyaza...kali dal was bit runny in consistency but overall the main course was good...so to sum it up its a good place to visit with friends but the service is slow...so those with ample amount of time should give it a visit...

Butter Chicken and Laal mirch waala paratha with a Full glass of Lassi is the one you should try here first. you can try the Hariyali tikka and Tandoori also. However most of the items reminds me the same old taste of AHD and of average taste if i compare other places at Kolkata serving similar North Indian food. In terms of Service its very good. I liked the tractor placed in the Dhaba that gives a special touch to this place.

If you want to tuck into Dhaba food and not drive far away from Saltlake, this is a pit stop with friends. You can order the food in your car or step out into the restaurant. Here the service is excellent and even on a busy day it is not difficult to get spotted by the watchful and alert waiters. The most favourite is the lasooni chicken and it is soft and succulent and yet well made. 

If you want real dhaba food in the vicinity of Saltlake, then this is the place.

"Gabbar" & "Basanti" titled washrooms :P
"UEEEE MA" & " Mary had a little lamb, badi swad thi" 

The above are some of the many things that I liked about RDB. It's decor, theme and above all the perfect 'PUNJABI' styled food makes it one of the good places in Salt Lake.
Being a veggie, ordered Paneer and dal and Nan Bread. Though the service was not at it's best, the food more than compensated for the lethargic servicing..finger licking good !
Not very hard on one's pockets, this place gives you a feel of being in a roadside dhaba in a metro city..The tractor inside adds cherry onto the cake !
Love the colas and the 'sharbats' served in bottles...
Recommended !!

I am not sure why but it seemed the the earlier Azad Hind Dhaba was better. The only thing good about this place was the tractor at the entrance of the restaurant. The decor is average. We went on a friday for lunch. The restaurant was around half full, but yet it took almost 75 minutes (yes 1 hour and 15 minutes) to server the chicken tandoori we ordered for starter. The food was average. Butter chicken in main course seemed a bit too much red in colour. Most likely excessive colour was added. The lassi was very good. Overall, a not-so-good experience.

After office hours headed for RDBD for dinner. Not much rush noticed like weekend. Ambience as usual happy bright with old advt paintings on walls.
Order for masala chaas was served with efficient service. Chaas was thick and spicy, tasty. Dilli ki Paneer makhani with roti was as expected. .fresh, softy,spicy,tasty and sufficient for dinner. Rotis were also warm enough to enjoy meaul. Lastly steam rice was right order to full our stomach and finish off ordered yellow dal tadka.
Quick service,bright ambience,good taste makes RDBD preferred and recommendable joint. Only thing to keep in mind is you don't get free onion and lemon before serving order. Have to order with charges.

Good times come in leaps and bounds. Our good times have already started with the weekend just another day away. I always look for delivery options in sector 5 while narrowing down on eating options given my super lazy attitude to make way out of the chilling temperature into the burning heat. I basically see no logic in giving up on comfort while looking for comfortable options to eat out at. Thus we zeroed on RDBD today. The delivery took about 50-55 minutes.
From my last experience of the foodie meet up along with entrepreneurs, I was aware that they make absolutely tasty North Indian food. Also, having tried quite a few options from the menu then, ordering today was a cake walk. We ordered for two laal mirch ka parathas, one half Dilli ki butter chicken (boneless) and one tawa keema kaleji. My greed never stops me from ordering absymal amount of food. Even while knowing through and through about the amount of keema kaleji, we ordered so many items along with it. 
The laal mirch ka paratha is a tasty killer when paired with the Dilli ka butter chicken. The chicken gravy is so good. Rarely do you find dhabas making such good, well cooked gravies, keeping a balance of spices along with oil. I was absolutely surprised to not find the chicken floating in oil with the masala settled below. It was a think, smooth, spicy yet sweet gravy that made sure we licked every bit on the plate and container, respectively. The laal mirch ka paratha as a standalone bread is  nothing less than crazy! It is spicy, red in colour and created explosions in the mouth. It is always advisable to order this with a gravy dish than with kebabs and dal. The latter will not bring out the texture of the bread comprehensively, so to say. The keema kaleji has been a favourite from the foodie meet and it was as good and perfect this time too. The only thing that keeps coming to me while having it - how can mutton liver be made so tasty and appetising? I guess RDBD knows the trick and nails it so well. It tastes awesome with the pav. I plan to pack it back home one day to have it the Bengali way with steamed rice. :)
Since I have been to RDBD already, it will be unfair to not mention about the two items I absolutely heart from the beverage and dessert sections - gulaab sharbaat and gulkand ice cream. These two are MUST orders along with the keema kaleji and butter chicken at RDBD. The sharbaat is a comforting refresher leaving a nice taste of gulaab in the mouth. And the dessert thoroughly reminds me of everything good in life. The only thing I do while slurping on it - ummmmmmm ummmmmm. 
The pocket pinch for our today's order was 650 INR. Not cheap, a little on the expensive range for a dhaba, I consider the price worth it for the quality and quantity of food they serve. I am satisfied. Immensely.

This is the dhaba that is located where Azad Hind existed earlier. A new  management has taken over the place and really decked it up. I particularly enjoyed the attention to detail esp fake cold drink posters on the walls as well as the tractor model: these have been thought of in order to give the place a dhaba feel. Coming to the food: It was a tasty treat but frankly I've had better north Indian food in Kolkata as well as in the northern part of India. We had ordered butter naan, tandoori roti, garlic naan, tandoori chicken, daal makhni and chicken bharta. The breads were good but all the other items could have been better. The only downside in my opinion was the quantity of food. The bowls looked big but the inside height was short thereby reducing the quantity of food. I do not appreciate this kind of ploy. Azad Hind provided more quantity for the same expenditure. Other than this I was very very impressed with the overall decor and general quality of the food.

Last week,I happened to eat lunch at this place.

1) Ambience:Top notch, i was welcomed by a big tractor near the door.The walls are covered with old advertisements and funny punjabi jokes.The lights are large milk cans,big bulbs.It was pleasing to the eyes

2)Food:We ordered dal makhni,mixed vegetables, and a paneer dish as mains,accompanied by butter nan and rumali roti.The portions were good and the food tasty!

3)Staff:The staff was well versed with the menu and gave good suggestions and the service was quick

4)Pocket pinch: The food is well priced and dosent hurt your pocket.

All in all a must visit when youre in sector5!

We visited this on the day of Holi this year.
The tables were not clean at all, they did not even clean the left-overs properly, not even wiped the tables with water.
The kababs were so hard,
The service was worst, had to wait for such along time for our foods to be served.
The A/C restaurant was closed, and they did not even provide proper fans.
Hygiene is also a bit low.
Should have rated this 1 (to avoid) but adding 1 point more as the chicken butter masala, roti and papad were good.
Mutton Gravy was tasteless.
And on top of above food is very expensive compared to quality.
They charge 45 + taxes for cold drinks which is absolutely crazy.
Quality- 3/5, Ambience-0/5, cost - 1/5, Service - 1.5/5

The place was earlier an azad hind dhaba but has been changed to rang de basanti only recently....

the food is very very good... from the daal to the biryani... the meal was cooked to perfection...

it is still a dhaba so they serve like one... it is a little laid back when it comes to service and the food takes a little time to come to you.... other than that the food is just great...

the pricing i had a problem with cause it is a little steep on the pocket... being in sector 5 we hit this place for lunch during office hours and paying this much does not make sense all the time... earlier also it was more expensive than the azad hind prices and now the prices just sky rocketed...

the place has changed with better seating and cleaner environment making the  place more comfortable to visit...

cause of that i would deduct some point... but again the food is just very very good...

I was a first time diner here. I will not try to compare the experience with the earlier establishment which was present here. Food ordered: Plain Nun, Dal Makhani, Chicken Bharta,

First the goods:

1. Ambience inside was ok
2. Chicken Bharta was good

The sorry parts:

1. Staff seem to be untrained. One of the guys was constantly spitting in front of the open seating area. Not a very pleasant sight while having lunch
2. The server spilled water carelessly while filling our glasses. Kept the spoons on the plates with a loud noise
3. A restaurant which takes pains to create a Dhaba like ambience (also noted by others) doesn't provide raw/soaked onions. No clue why. We were happy to pay for it, but thats apparently against policy.
4. The dal makhani had a lot of Rajma in it. No we did not request any Rajma.
5. Most of the nuns had burnt black patches which had to carefully peeled off.
6. The server said the manager was busy when we requested to speak with him/her. No raised voices, no angry tones. He then said they could not locate him. At a time we were literally surrounded by all the waiters - some of them said the manager was busy, while some said he couldn't be found! We made it clear we were not leaving without talking to the manager. Only 2 other other tables were occupied at the time so we didn't quite understand what kept him so busy on a Sunday afternoon. When he came out finally, he explained he wasn't informed all this time. Really?

Overall, we left with a bitter taste in out mouths.

Hello Folks,

I visited this restaurant on 1 March 2014. The revamped look is great. I love their rolls and they just got better at that. 

However, I was a bit disappointed with the food. The pulav had a strands of hair, and the salad wasn't freshly cut. In fact, a guest sitting next to me also complained about the salad, and had it canceled. 
I raised the issue and the waiter argued that it was fresh. Come on, now anyone can easily figure out fresh salad from non-fresh. When I insisted, they waived off the salad charges from my bill. But thats not the point, it kind of soured my overall experience. 
I would recommend this place, but exercise caution and check your food properly before consuming.

People familiar with Sector V will remember Azad Hind Dhaba near College More. And that is where this transformed outlet has come up. Renovated and renamed as the Rang De Basanti Dhaba, this restaurant is located, in what can reasonably be said, as one of the best in all of Sector V. Transport is not an issue and it is well connected from both New Town and Salt Lake sides. I have visited this outlet a couple of times and on both occasions it was to have dinner after watching a movie at RDB Boulevard.


I have been to its predecessor outlet as well, and compared to that, I feel this one is way better; not only due to the improved ambiance but also the organization of the entire place as a whole. The lighting is also better, and the inside of the restaurant has a nice comfortable feeling about it. Not to mention the tractor that greets your entrance.


Coming to the food now. Over my couple of visits to this place, I have mainly had items like Naan, Tandoori Chicken , Paneer Masala and Chicken Tikka.  Apart from the fact that the Tandoori Chicken felt a bit spicy, the other items were good. No complains there really. I actually liked having Naan with Paneer Masala and to me it made a good taste. The service was fine as well.


The final cost did seem to be a bit on the higher side, but it was okay since I had gone in there to have my tummy filled and the food they served did so, quite to my satisfaction. And at the end of the day, at a restaurant, that is what matters.

Our old joint Azad Hind Dhaba has been reconstructed and taken over by this Rang de Dhaba.My office is just close by so actually I have seen the transformation and was very curious about the new joint.From outside it looks really bright and fresh.Last friday on a friend's Bday finally got a chance to step in.

The first thing you will surely gonna notice is the ambience.Its very unusual,unique yet simple.Very clean n bright.There is this unique touch in all the aspects.Be it the lamp shades some of which are milk-cans and oil holders and big bulbs or the walls which are decorated with posters and funny quotations.They also have a tractor inside.

Now coming to food and service.Since we mainly went for evening snacks we limited ourselves to tandoori chicken ,malai tikka kebab and basanti thandai.
Nothing much to talk about the food.Tandoori was spicy and well cooked and malai kebabs were pretty good to taste.
I only had problem with size and quantity of the kebabs given the price.We get better kebabs in relatively lesser price in many places.
The thandai was not at all good.It was all milk with ice and had some distinct taste of some spices.My friends also agreed on the same.I would like to revisit this place for the paranths and main course dishes.Till then its a 3 from my end.

P.S: The bill for one plate Tandoori(full)+kebab +2 thandai=747/-

Our very own Azad Hind Dhaba at Salt Lake has been rechristened as RDB Dhaba! Well the change in name has ushered in a better decor and ambiance inside the place - it appears cleaner and well lit with funny one liners from the 80's and 90's ads winking all around. The lamp shades and seating are also innovative. Food has always been good here, and the quality is the same. Service was bit slow, which was disappointing. I tried out some new items like Mirchi ka Paratha with mutton which was good (and hot! - try this one if you can handle it).
RDB please concentrate more on food and quality of service. You enjoy a unique location - make the most of it. All the best.

I had high hopes for RDBD but I was truly very very disappointed with this restaurant. Twice had I had to bear the pathetic service they provide. First incident was that they made me wait for more than 40minutes although I ordered just a plate of kebab and a couple of plate of Biriyani. After around 40minutes the waiter came and informed that the Kebab was not available.
The second incident happened a couple of days back. I went down to restaurant and ordered a few items to be packed for home. When I returned I found an entire different set of items had been delivered to me. I had to again go back and get them changed. 
I wanted to meet their manager but the waiters present refused me to do so. After a prolonged argument, the manager was called who came and apologized.
I don't remember having experienced a worse service before. Even the food is very mediocre and is not worth a wait.
I would recommend any and everyone to avoid RDBD.

The very well known Dhaba of Salt lake (AHD) has been rechristened as RDBD. Would like to mention here that it's fresh and the ambiance is quite innovative.The menu has the history on the front page which says this is a branch of the orginal RDBD in Sarojini Nagar,Delhi.I went to have my dinner with wifey on valentines day , though the place was very crowded being located at the hot location in Salt lake.

Entering the RDBD you see a Real Tractor decorated with LEDs , which gets you the feel that you are entering a Punjabi place.The new look has neat rows of wooden benches inside and outside.Interesting funny quotations and advertisements of 80's cover the walls(e.g. Campa Cola, Gold Spot, Vinod Khanna in CINTHOL ad, Salman Khan in Hero Honda,EXIDE etc ).Lamp shades are quite an innovation with Milk Cans and oil holders .

Coming to the food part, there is a CHIN-JABI(Chinese food in Punjabi style) fest going on this month and the menu is on each table. Went on to order Tandoori Momo with Tandoori chicken for the starter.Chicken Tikka masala with Lachha paratha and Garlic naan in the main course.Also in drink we did order Sweet Lassi and Rang de Cola which was served in small glass jars which seemed bit average in comparison to the price.

 The tandoori chicken/tandoori momo was extremely hot/spicy which made me drink a lot of water.I never had this spicy Tandoori in my life and the garlic naan was not up to the mark(thin,crisp,burnt).However , the staffs taking the order were courteous enough and they are real assets of the restaurant.They also did serve a complimentary heart shaped "Gajar Ka Halwaa" at the billing which was a relief to my burning mouth.

I would like to mention here , RDBD should concentrate on food quality and serving style which will make a long lasting impression. I would certainly comeback when I find people giving positive response. All the best RDBD team. Cheers!

Really liked this place. 
The ambiance and the creative decor is sure to catch your eyes. The staff was extremely well mannered and responsive.  I had planned to have a small meal but ended up ordering 3 types of Kebabs along with Butter Naan and Dal Makhani. I was more than happy with the food. I even packed some for home. Pricing too is reasonable.

Food: 3/5
Service: 1/5
Ambiance: 3.5/5
Price: 3/5

I went on Valentine's Day night to have dinner and had a below average experience. The place was quite crowded and the waiting list was increasing rapidly. The management was not able to cope up with the orders and they were completely clueless as if where to start from. Even waited for long they let people go inside who arrived after us.

Upon entering you will get to see everything which needs to be placed in a dhaba to look like a dhaba. Hanging milk cans, funnels, tyres, photo frames with old ads, saloon style door for the wash room and how can I forget about their mascot - the yellow and red tractor. It's kind of modern dhaba without any sardar.

People on the adjacent tables were complaining about the food being not cooked well and stuff like that so, we were bit worried about ordering any non-veg item. After 10 minutes they came to take the order. We thought we'll order the starter (hariyali chicken kebab) first, while having the same we'll order the main course. As it was getting late so I ordered the main course too which was Kadhai Paneer, Dal Makhni, Hari mirch ki roti and Cheese & Peas pulao. After 35 minutes of waiting the waiter came with main course then the starter together.

The paneer was average and dal makhni was full of chillies, how come dal makhni can be so hot? roti was not soft and could not realize it was cheese and peas pulao. There's nothing called cheese in it. Only the hariyali chicken kebab was good but then again they forgot to serve the green chatni with it. After all this just wanted to come out from that place as soon as possible. Maybe some other day will give it a try again but for now nothing special about it.

Edit:( This place has really upgraded in terms of taste and service over the years. I have visited this place quite a few times and had different experiences every time. On Sundays you will have to wait for at least 40 mins for your table. The food varities offered are very exquisite and the Punjabi cuisine is totally lip smacking. Haryali paneer tikka and kebab are one of the best veg starters. Do not forget to try the Paneer Tawa Khurchan which serves two loaves of paw and Paneer cooked in tawa Masala gravy. The Rang de basanti kaali daal and chole are must haves. Along with these do indulge yourself in some thirst quenching drinks like Masala cola and Lassi. Overall you will enjoy the atmosphere with the dhaba decor and ambience in the restaurant but only on a weekday or when the place is less crowded.) Ambience was good. The setup is also amazing and out of the box with concepts of typical Punjabi environment. The veg delicacies included tawa paneer with pav which is a must have there. The non veg items also had a variety of lip smacking options.

Such a colorful and bright place!

RDBD is very near to college more in sector 5.It also has an outside seating arrangement which might be preferable for dinner or in the winter time.
This place has some quite unique wall decorations,I remember one was "Keep Clam and Have Naan" ,hilarious!!
It also has a tractor is the entrance.

The service is good,food was served on time.The waiters were friendly.

Food,I would say was pretty okay. 
We ordered:Rang De cola,tandoori chicken momo,achari murg tikka,butter chicken half and butter naan.
1.Rang De cola was like any other masala coke(but what more can be done)
2.Tandoori chicken momo was a very unique dish and I was impressed.What I could understand from the taste,the chicken momos were streamed then coated in tandoori masala and were put in the tandoor.
3..Achari murg was high on spices ,which could have been good if it was not high on salt.
4..Dilli ki butter chicken half has 5 small pieces and enough gravy for 2 people.However the taste was not like you get in Delhi.I've had much tastier butter chicken even from the smallest outlets of Delhi.
Nevertheless it was a good try. 
5..Naan was soft.

I might revisit again to try out something new!

Rang De Basanti Dhaba - Located at sector 5, Salt lake. Keep going straight from Nicco Park. Don't get up on the flyover. Go below it, keep going straight and you will reach a cross section of four roads. Turn right from there. Keep going, keep going, on your left, first you will come across Monotel, BBs and then RDBD! - Thank you 'Ps' for helping me locating the place. :P 
--------------------
Brief
This place has a lot of scope of improvement's. When i first entered this place, i was mesmerised but not over the top impressed as one of my major complaints is the tractor. I don't know i overlooked the tractor and many other people who had been coming and visiting this restaurant first time. I felt there should be a better position for the tractor so that it can be seen properly and should be catchy. Secondly, i really loved how they have beautifully decorated on the 'top' ceiling and the way one tyre is giving the impressive look on the wall beautifully decorated with lightings.. However, the side walls were bland and plain decorated with various portraits of old ad's and bikes which really did not act as a make up with respect to the bland decoration. 

Lastly, i felt a need for a better music because being a punjabi myself, the music was not as impressive as it should be. 
--------------------
Starters and Beverages-  I had tried Veg Tandoori Momo and even chicken tandoori Momo. The Momo's were good but placing it into the Tandoor wasn't a great idea. The presentation of the food was excellent. However, i somehow would have preferred the green chutney and not the red sauce.  

As beverages, i had tried- 
1) Rose sherbet - Which was superb. 
2) Sweet Lassi - Which was good but had better one's before. 
3) Jal jeera - Which was good too. 

Main course- 1) Chicken tikka in hot garlic sauce - I really like this concept of Chingming. However, the tikka tastes like the usual chicken when made in hot garlic sauce. I could not get the Flavor of tikka. Too spicy it was. 
2) Paneer Tikka in hot garlic sauce- Usual same greavy. Too spicy it was. 
3) Their special lal roti had tasted really superb and is a really good concept. The other roti mixed with cut green chilis and capsicum did not appeal me much. However, it was good too. 
4) Dilli ka butter chicken - I really got reminded of Delhi when i had the first bite of it. It tasted outstanding and superb and is my recommendation out here. 
5) Fried Rice- Usual fried rice, nothing too extraordinary. 


Desserts- 1) Gulkand icecream which tasted really awesome and has become one of my favorite out here in RDBD.

I really want to thank the owners for helping us to know RDBD better and Special 'PB' to invite me into the get together. :)
--------------------
Suggestions:-
1) Ambience needs improvement.
2) There is lot of scope in improving the presentation style. 
3) Tractor requires good placement. 
4) Need to try more different concepts. The chingming's was a good try but better things can be made by mixing other things. 
5) Hospitality can be improved in a much larger dimension. 
--------------------
Summary:- 
Food presentation 4/5
Food quality 4/5
Food quantity 4/5
Ambience 3/5 

Pricey? Not really. Pretty reasonable.
--------------------
Conclusion- Pretty reasonable affair. A good place to dine it with family and friends. Beverages can be improved on a large scale and same with the food. I am glad that RDBD tried to be somewhat different. :) Coming back for more.

"O Chak de phatte, nap de killi,
raat nu Jalandhar, sawere Dilli" ! 

A luncheon with two of my closest people :  J and S today afternoon.
We were famished to death when we reached RDBD at around 2.15pm.
I had planned this luncheon a week back and was very excited when finally I saw my plan getting executed perfectly.
The ambience is quirky and pretty cool. The tractor is whacky. Got a few pictures too. Haha.
BUT, what really was disappointing was their service. DISAPPOINTING is the word.
We had to wait for 50 long minutes for the meal. It was definitely TOO much a wait.
 (We had ordered at 2.30, they got back to us at around 3.20pm)

Here's what we had ordered :

1. Chicken Tikka in hot garlic sauce (from their Chinjabi festival)
2. Masala Kulcha ( PS : We had previously ordered Haka noodles with makhani gravy, which they said wasnt available. Going into that detail later)
3. Dilli ka butter chicken
4. Gulab jamun with ice cream
5. Rang de cola

I have kept my review is two segments : :  Food and service.

Food : Excellent food. Right from the Rang de cola (which is a version of masala cola) was so refreshing.  Yes, today the afternoon sun was a ball of fire and the rang de cola was a respite. However, trouble began after the cola. We were expecting the starter which was Chicken tikka in hot garlic sauce which did not turn up in the next 40 minutes. After a span of 40 minutes, the waiter waiting our table came up and told that the haka noodles werent available. We were informed about that when we were almost starving. We had to immediately change the order with a sort of disgusted look. So instead we went for the masala kulcha. They took another five minutes and finally delivered our dishes. The food was excellent and impeccable. I completely loved the spicy gravy and the masala kulcha which went extremely well with the butter chicken. Yes, butter chicken is a total favourite of mine. It smelt amazing and the gravy was thick and smelled of butter and spices and completely blew me over. A huge revelation was the chicken tikka is hot garlic sauce. This was a concoction of punjabi and chinese , in other words "Chinjabi"  :D
It was delicious.
Lastly, we couldnt help ourselves and ordered gulab jamun and ice cream. It was icing on the cake. I just wish the gulab jamun was hot. It would have tasted bomb if it was hot. Nevertheless, it was an amazing end to an amazing meal. 
I had a *burrrraaaahhhh*  after the meal.
Anyway having said all that, the service disappointed me a lot. We had almost cancelled our order because of the delay :(
We waited and waited and beckoned the waiters. And all they said was "Abhi aa raha hai, bas ho gaya hai" but the dish never turned up within their time limits.

I would have rated them as great because of their food but the service totally put me off. 
Will come back of course but I hope their service improves.
I really wont appreciate another wait of 50 minutes next time.

PS : They have a quirky washroom door too. The ladies washroom reads "Basanti" and the gents washroom reads "Gabbar"  LOL.

Cheers!  :)

A very very mediocre experience ! 

Decided to order some tandoori items reading the reviews and also assuming that they are a dhaba  and tandoori stuff at a dhaba cannot go wrong but I was sadly mistaken. 

the tandoori chicken was measly ! i mean the drumstick was 2 inches long ! and i finished the thigh and drumstick in 4 bites. loaded in chilies i felt the strong marinade was a good way of camouflaging bad cookin

the lehsuni tikka was well cooked but the marinade was not anything great .... tasted like a reshmi with garlic 

The mutton seekh kebab was HORRID ! the button was chewy and not smooth at all the seekh kebab  had the same taste as the tandoori chicken and and was falling apart and was crumbly 

although the service was prompt and quick . This place has opened up in place of Azad hind dhaba unfortunately the delivery bikes still have azad hind written on them and they haven't done much of change in the decor . except for the tables

Today, evening it took almost 45 minutes for me to get a plain egg roll. It was a rush time but delivering about a dozens of rolls to dozens of people in 45 minutes!!! Horrible. When I took a bite, it was awful. 

Do I want my money back? No, I am not that much of miser but I do of course want my time  worse spent back and my appetite too!! 

-5/5.

When I visited Kolkata this month, I wanted to try some new restaurant. My friends suggested we should try "tractor" restaurant, it has a real tractor inside the restaurant!! We didn't know the name, but Rohan (my friend) knew it was at Sector V. 

We landed up at the place, it was called Rang De Basanti Dhaba. There was some electrifying atmosphere at this place, lot of activity outside the restaurant. There were people ordering rolls from the counter, guests sitting outside and enjoying their meals in Calcutta winters. 

We went inside, it was very warm and beautiful interiors. Well lit up, amazing lights Milk Can Lights, some hilarious posters, (Thand rakh, lassi pee and Mary had a little Lamb!!) and of course the "Tractor"

We ordered for Mirch Malai seekh, Tandoori Aloo and the waiter suggested we should try Aloo ke Tuk. They were all mind blowing! Mirch Malai seekh was not very spicy, yet creamy and very soft. It does melt in your mouth! Aloo ke Tuk was something different too though Tandoori aloo was same as we get at other places.

For main course we ordered Kurkuri bhindi (the name was very interesting) Dilli ka Paneer and Dal Makhani. Again, we went for mirchi ki roti as suggested by the waiter and tandoori roti.
Well, we didn't stop eating! Really. Dilli ka paneer Makhani was so amazing that I felt like packing it and freezing it so that I could carry it back to Mumbai! Kurkure bhindi blew us off, we could just keep munching it. Hari Mirch ki roti was very interesting. Rohan didn't let us touch his roti after a point!

Over all fantastic experience! Good ambiance, very clean, lively and bright! Food was so good that I felt like I was in Punjab! Service was little slow, if only there were some punjab da munda serving us, we would have eaten double the amount!

Good work guys! Hope to be back soon :)

It was Saturday night and my friends and myself were hanging out at a pub
till 1am. Once we were done partying, we ofcourse wanted to eat desi food!
Someone suggested to try out Rang De Basanti dhaba at sector V. We weren't
sure if it would be open at 1:30am but to our surprise, it was open and
buzzing with people!

We called for the food in the car, "Car Seva" like they call and it was an
amazing experience! The guy who was serving us, "Azad" was brilliant. He
kept running to and fro to us to ensure we had everything we wanted.

For starters we ordered Aloo ke Tuk, Tandoori Chicken and Mirch seekh. Each
one of them were delicious. Aloo ke Tuk was very different with masala on
it.

Main Course we had Delhi ka Paneer Makhani and daal makhani. Paneer was so
good, so creamy and full of flavors that I will go back just for that again
to RDBD!

We couldn't eat a lot that late at night, but I could see lot of
interesting items on the menu card. Before leaving we asked the waiter if
we could sit on the tractor and he said, of course you can!

So we sat on the tractor and got lot of pictures clicked! What a fantastic
way to end a party!

Dhaba style mazaa lena ho toh, you should go to Rang De Basanti Dhaba!

It was PB and CM's reviews which dragged me to RDB Dhaba!! Was happy to see the funky decor.. the huge tractor at the entrance.. the oldie adds.. the quirky posters... the wooden benches & the colorful menu card.. absolute punjabi vibe I should say!

Servers are quite courteous.. but let us down when we found the famous Tawa Bheja Masala was not available.. in fact, no tawa items were available.. 
We settled down for Laal Surkh Jheenga.. Desi Nimbu Paani and a fresh lime soda(sweet).. We were in a little hurry, and the starters took real time to arrive.. considering it was a prawn dish, we allowed the delay.. drinks were served meanwhile.. the glasses looked interesting! The Desi Nimbu Pani was okay.. but the soda was a bit too sweet... like you have put soda in sugar syrup!! We asked the server to change that.. & what was served instead was strictly okay..


Finally the starter arrived.. it was a real delight to eyes! The prawns were rightly sized.. and looked perfectly spiced.. We jumped on the plate.. but was disappointed with the quality of the prawn.. they were extra-soft in texture.. no more than that of a fish kabab... I love the crunchiness in prawn.. & I missed it! The taste was good though.. but again, not at all spicy as told by the server while ordering..

In main, we went for Chicken Biryani and Dilli ka butter chicken.. The biryani was okay.. smelled too much of rose water.. real deterioration from what was available in Azad Hind Dhaba... like, literally! The butter chicken tasted good.. with small cubes of chicken.. smooth and silky gravy.. and loads of it.. we actually ordered an extra butter nun to wipe off the gravy! There again, I had ordered my favourite garlic nun.. & the waiter warned us, it would take huge time to get prepared.. & made us order butter nun..

However, the food was okay.. not something I would gorge on.. I have been a fan of AHD.. and the change is not at all welcome..

My first meal at RDB dhaba was with my friend C, who dragged me along with her. Yellow and happy on the outside, I loved the decor which had old ads, quirky sayings (keep calm and eat naan), and oil cans posing as lamps. I was smitten. We ordered fast, since C was in a hurry, and our food came within ten minutes of order (well, the starter did, anyway!). 

I spied Bheja fry on the menu and all was right in the world. They make an excellent Bheja fry, which, when I could not finish in one go, I asked them politely to pack it for me, and they did. They also had made my drink of rose soda WITHOUT lemon, but well, added the salt in it (which probably came with the lemon) which made it a bit too salty. 

The butter chicken had been pretty much amazing, though. It made me happy, and I polished off most of it, although it was C's dish. The mushroom tikka, stuffed and smooth, was C's pick and well, I ate a lot of it. Let's just say, I was hungry that day. Of course, in my hurry the first time, I forgot to see the tractor. (FACEPALM MOMENT).

My brother packed chicken bharta from RDB the other day, and I have to say, I want to sample more of the food from this place, because it was quite silky, and not the average stuff you get in the name of Bharta. However, I would want to go back to sample the Bheja Tawa Masala and the Keema Kaleji, two things on the menu I have my heart set on.

Hadn't been to the Delhi wala RDB Dhaba. This was a very nice surprise, finding good North-Indian food in Kolkata! Loved both the veg and non-veg items..as well as the Lassi! But the best part was the wonderful ambience - the creatively designed interior (using filmi posters and taglines)  and the decorative items across the length of the restaurant.
Would definitely recommend it :)

So I whined and whined some more and mabe PB1 take me to RDB Dhaba today. It is on College More, beside MC building where previously there used to be Azad Hind Dhaba.

The first thing a normal non-PB1 person would notice is the giant colorful tractor on the left of the entrance. There are funky posters all round. The lights are actually milk and oil cans. The rows of wooden benches and tables are quite comfortable. It has a very undeniable Punjabi vibe.

The staff are corteous and helpful and the service is prompt.

Now coming to the food. THE FOOD. We ordered a rose syrup without nimbu marke and the masala thumbs up which has some fancy RDB name. The rose syrup was a bit too salty. The masala thumbs up was PERFECT. We ordered stuffed mushroom for starters which came with the most divine green chutney. The mushrooms were soft and the stuffing was subtle and did not overwhelm the taste of the mushroom. Then we ordered garlic naan, bheja fry and chicken butter masala. The garlic naan was a little burnt for my taste and not garlicky enough. But both the bheja fry and the chicken butter masala were delicious. The last time I had a good bheja fry was in Pune. I will definetely go back to this place just for the Bheja Fry. PB1 actually ordered an extra tandoori roti to wipe the bheja fry off with. As it is the bheja fry comes with butter soaked Pav.

Also I must mention their funky menu card. It has dancing Sikhs and Mary's lamb and the thing I liked the most. The Chef's recommendations have a tiny tractor beside them.

We are from Mumbai and shifted to Kolkata a month ago. We went to RDB for our anniversary dinner. Actually I forced my husband to have dinner in RDBD as the restaurant was rennovated and I was in mood to have North Indian food.  But RDBD didn't meet my expectation as I found many few options available for Vegitarians. Food was good but we have very limited options to order. We want to order Rumali Roti (which was in menu) but the waiter said they dont have it. Also for rice, only Peas and cheese pulav was in the menu (other than Plain and fried rice) in veg, They dont serve biryani or any other rice stuff. 

Food: came quickly after order and was good in taste specially the "Kurkuri Bhendi" which was awesome and I would recomended everyone to try once.

Desert: Again very few optios available (Only Vanilla flavor was available in Ice cream). We have ordered "Gajar Ka Halwa" and "Gulab Jamun". "Gulab Jamun" was ok but "Gajar ka Halwa" was bad. It seems that the boiled carrots were fried in Ghee and served.

I do agree that the Resturant recently reopened but In a metro city you can't take chances. I had food in many newly opened resturants and hotel and had very good experince in Mumbai.

Interior and concept is really good which really impressed me but the options with food really disappointed me (It also spoiled our important day).

Guess what I found at Kolkata?!    

Rang De Basanti Dhaba!! 

RDBD has been my favourite Indian restaurant at Delhi and it recently opened an outlet in Sector V, Kolkata!

I visited the brand new place on the third day of its opening and I must accept that it had certain teething problems, mainly in service. However, once the piping hot food reached the tables, all our restlessness was put to rest! 

There use to be some other restaurant here previously, so I asked the manager at RDBD what was different here, from the previous Brand and the answer was very good, he said "Ma'am, it's Same Same but Different!" Which was true. The menu was same, with a few specialities from Delhi, staff were the same. However, everything "looks" different here. The interior is super cool, right from the Milk Cans lights, the quirky posters, Bhayankar Tyre and of course my fave, the Tractor!

Starters:
We ordered for Aloo Ke tuk, Dahi ke Kebabs and Tandoori Chicken for starters. It took it little too long I must say, but once it started coming, the food never stopped! Starters were very good, my friend says his Chicken was juicy and well charred. Dahi ke kebabs were exceptionally good, they melt in your mouth. Aloo ke Tuk werent as good as the ones I have at Delhi, but it was ok!

Main Course:
For main course we had Kurkuri Bhindi, Aloo do Pyaza, Mutton Roganjosh with Mirch ki Roti! Kurkuri bhindi wasnt as kurkure, but nevertheless, it tasted brilliant with the special masala sprinkled on top. Aloo do Pyaza has always been very good here and he loved the Kashmiri Mutton Roganjosh. But the highlight of the day was the mirch ki roti! It wasn't very spicy but tasted really yummy!

Drinks:
I ordered for Basanti Thandai, others called for Gulab Sharbat and Jaljeera. They came in super cute jars, completely chilled. Thandai was to kill for. Jaljeera was good though the sharbat had little extra lemon in it. 

After eating so much, I was sure the bill would be a bomb! To our surprise, it was nothing! I actually felt like I was eating at the same old place but a lot better, cleaner, brighter ambiance. To top it all, the manager sent  us complimentary Gulkand Ice cream, this was to apologize for the slight delay in service! Oh the Gulkand Ice Cream was so gooooood! Never tasted something like this before!

All in all, I was very glad I came here. Service, slow, but its a new set up, guess the guys are taking time to adjust. 

I am definitely visiting this place again very soon. Thanks RDBD for giving Calcutta it's real Dhaba.
