Terrible and horrendous are the two adjectives that can be used to describe this restaurant. I visited this restaurant yesterday. It is located just opposite to the headquarters of the Fire Brigade in Sudder Street. I went in thought the restaurant can repel anybody. I ordered chicken lollypop. They took three minutes to serve the food. The lollypopa weee good. Next, I ordered chicken stick kebab. The chicken was tough and bland. It was tasteless as hell. Thr behaviour of the staff is somewhat rude to say the least. Hygiene has been extinct in this shop for a long time. On close observation you can see cockroaches. I am never visiting this shop again.
