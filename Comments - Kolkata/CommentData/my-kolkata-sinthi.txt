Had noodles and chicken kebabs. Food not upto the mark. The washroom area is not hygienic also. 
Need improvement both in service and food quality.

Nice and small restaurant.. Creative decorations.. Nice presentation of food.. Good behaved staff.. and the best thing about this restaurant is the food... Those dishes I have tried are very good and there is a lot of varieties in the menu....

This place is a newly opened joint very close to the University of Calcutta( being a student there) and hence I made my first visit. 
I had ordered for sweet corn soup and drums of heaven. 
I didn't like the food at all. Seating is good enough. 
The soup wasn't thick. It was probably just the chicken stalk, chicken,egg and sweet corn. Didn't make me happy. 
The chicken appeared stale to me.
Need to work on their food. It's the only thing that matters.
