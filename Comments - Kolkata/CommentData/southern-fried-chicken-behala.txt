Ordered through Swiggy..Nowadays many food joints have come up which serves food on the similar line of KFC but on cheaper rates (I am not comparing them with KFC but it came as an obvious mention).

I really liked the juicy fried chickens and tenders. The Chicken Popcorn was also too good.Â 

The sandwich was okay-ish.

Recommended for home delivery as I have not been to this outlet though I believe its very near to my place.
