A decent pizza house out there in Behala Chowrasta, which indeed needs some attention to locate while you are in normal traffic. We visited there today just to hang up for some time. Our apetite was on lower side and hence we had a Regular Paneer Makhani pizza along with cooling Nolen Gurer Sundae. The sundae was out of expectation and satisfied our sweeth tooth. I look forward to visit again and try out some other food item as well. Thumbs up!!

I am in love with is restaurant. The food is so good. Today I had a thali " Veg pulao with chicken curry" and it costed me Rs 110. It was so good. They provide you with the vest value for money. Previously I had their  Dinner Box ( 3 pieces of fried chicken). For just Rs 140 had a great experience. I guess I will never go to KFC for fried chicken :P

First of all its really hard to find it. We once ordered chicken family bucket and boneless strips. We were very satisfied with the taste and quantity specially when we considered the price. So went to the restaurant another day with great expectations. We were greeted well by the attendant. We had burger and chicken bucket. We were very very disappointed this time. The buns were very dry. It was ever tough for us to swallow it. The crust of fried chicken hinted of low quality oil. All the impression were gone. We didn't even try to have pizza and just left
Thank you

Ordered food from here through swiggy. We went for a 10 inch spicy chicken tikka pizza. The pizza wasn't authentic, but Indianized . Anyways, it tased good, had enough toppings, adequately cheesy and yea, was superr spicy.
The packaging and everything else were good too.
I am definitely looking forward to more food from here soon!

I have had a couple of pizzas from this food house. While the pizzas were good, i do have a couple of complaints.
Firstly, i ordered their supreme delight pizza which should have had pepperoni instead it came with sausages cut round
Secondly, the crust was a bit chewy, and the edges were burnt mildly.
Otherwise it was a great pizza at sucha cheap price

Ordered for the first time from here, wasn't extremely disappointed at all. The food was average. The pizza needs a round of applauds but the burger wasnt par expectations. 
Never the less, getting warm pizza delivered at your doorstep in barisha region is a biggie and we got a solution to it now. 
Order was : Fiery Bengal Pizza and Chicken Maha Burger with Cheese.

There are multiple fired chicken outlets in nook and corner of Kolkata these days. This outlet has been consistently maintaining their quality. Their burgers and pizzas are also decent. Though didn't like the Chinese part of the menu. Tastes were not that good.
But for fried chicken in Behala, this is the place to go.

But, my favourite one is the Hawaiian Burger.. It's speciality is that it has a big chunk of pineapple in it..I donot recommend this to those who think there should be no pineapples in pizza's or burgers.. But those who do..Go for it.. :)

Pizzas are just horrible. Chinese food items is however average. Location is at Behala Chowrasta DH road in the industrial area , which can be a cons but it is near my place and I being a pizza lover expected much from this place . Chinese foods are satisfactory and pocket friendly , ideal for low budget lunch or dinner.

I have never, for once visited this place and hence a review on ambience and service is something I am unable to provide.But the one thing that I can guarantee is its food.Considering the fact that it is located in chowrasta ,providing us with a quality of food not usually found in this part of Kolkata is laudible in itself.I have ordered online a number of times and it has fulfilled my cravings almost all the time ,be it pizza or crispy chicken or salads or burgers.Pizzas have ample cheese oozing out with enough toppings and delivered super hot.The chickens are equally crispy and spicy (just according to my palette) .The only complain I have is about its buns.They are dry and needs serious attention.Among it's lot I found the combination of Russian salad and crsipy chicken the best.The salad acts as a palette cleanser in sharp contrast to it's mildly hot crispy fried chicken.
In the end I would like to add that like most of us the chefs' also have their ups and downs and therefore the food comes out not as great as expected on these days.Please bear with them as I am sure they are trying their best to cater to people and fulfill all their wishes.

P.S- the home delivery is apt on time everytime .(within 30mins from ordering)

After giving the food waiters don't ask us for serving it.. evn we ask for water den they gives us the water..  food was ok .  We ordered chicken fried rice n chicken noodles with garlic chicken nd brownie sundae . Fried rice was nt properly cooked bt chowmin was good. Bt chicken preparation was really bad.. there was we find no chicken.  Only small piece of bone n flour coated something.  Bt only the dessert was awesome.  I really loved it.. only for this item i give 3point to dis resturant.  Overall I dnt find any wow factor.. i dnt go dis place 4 next time..

Ordered chicken sweet corn soup, chicken russian salad, chinese nonveg combo meal and chicken maharaja burger. I must say the chicken maharaja burger and the chicken russian salad is a must try. The rates are also very low. So this can be an ideal place for chilling out with friends and also for evening snacks. I haven't tried out their home delivery yet but is surely looking forward to try it out. If you are in behala you must not miss out this place.

Since this place is nearer to my office so I often visit this place........it is located inside Behala Industrial Estate..
On my first visit I tried its Chinese non-veg combo which consists of chicken hakka noodles and chilly chicken... though the noodle was quite good but I didn't like the chilly chicken since it was lacking the required amount of flavour....
On my next visits I had tried fried chicken wings, chicken lollipop, chicken Maha burger and chicken popcorn......
I liked all the fried stuffs except chicken popcorn..it was not that bad but still then it needs to be a little bit more spicy and crunchy.....
The burger 🍔was good and delicious....among all those foods I had tried i loved chicken wings and lollipop...
overall it is a good place and also the staffs are very friendly and well-behaved...
RECOMMENDATIONS : CHICKEN LOLLIPOP & CHICKEN WINGS.....

I have ordered food from here quite a few times, and I must say that their delivery service is very good. And for that reason I'm giving this extra half rating. Their burgers are very good, crunchy and cheesy at the same time. I don't like their sandwiches much. They're not grilled nicely and the stuffings are gravy like, which makes the sandwich bulgy. The other snacks items are good. Overall a good place to gorge on junkies 😉

I would say that this joint is a good effort to provide a cheaper alternative to international pizza chains like Dominoz and Pizza hut. You get similar sized pizzas for a cheaper price and I've tried only the Pizzas till date. However, I'm not sure of the quality of the crust, it's freshness and the quantity of cheese added. To me, it appeared as though the crust was already baked beforehand and they just put the toppings and baked it once again as per orders received, parts of base were burnt. If you're hungry and want it to be light on your pocket, this joint would be a great choice. If you want to indulge in good quality pizzas, sadly, Pizza hut is still the place to go to.

Got their food delivered via Zomato only and they took less than a hour to deliver our order. 
We settled for Chicken Supreme Pizza and Crispy Chicken. The pizza was awesome with a great topping of chicken chunks,black olives, babycorn, tomato with a generous amount of cheese. The crispy chicken was also a good option and it tasted like that of KFC. The covering was hot and crispy and the chicken was succulent. Pocket friendly and their service is highly appreciable. Thinking of trying out their Chicken Maha Burger for the next time.

This restaurant is located inside the Industrial Complex of Behala Chowrasta opposite to the Vivekananda College for Women. Since the restaurant is not on the main road, we found it quite empty even during the Durga Puja which is a hectic period for most restaurants. The place has a small seating consisting five tables with a maximum capacity of four seats in a table. We ordered a couple of Non Veg Chinese Meal for One, one with rice and the other with noodles. Although the quantity of both rice and noodles were more than sufficient for a single person, the quality of rice was way better than that of the noodles. The noodles appeared to be tasteless. The chicken side dish in the combo meal had four pieces of chicken in it and all of them were very small. Another downer for me was they do not serve regular water, so I had to take mineral water which is by default present in all the tables make it compulsory to charge Rs. 20/- from everyone for this. The cost of the meal was quite sufficient as compared to the quantity served but the quality needs to be better.

The staff was very friendly.I ordered a grilled chicken pizza- juicy, full of toppings and soft crust,i liked it more than the dominos pizza in terms of taste and cost! And also ordered a chicken wings in tomato garlic sauce which came in 6 peices tossed in a well balanced hot sauce. The service was quick and food was *inclusive* tax. If u have a group of friends looking for a pocket friendly eatery this one is a must visit!

We visited the outlet as well as ordered home delivery few times and we were satisfied every time. It is a small joint with few tables. The person at the counter is very friendly. We had chicken supreme Pizza (and I ask them to avoid adding tomatoes), lite bite, chicken maha burger with cheese and once i got a complimentary brownie through zomato. They deliver till New alipore within an hour which is highly appreciable. My favourite one is chicken maha burger with cheese. Soft sesame buns, two chicken fillets, cheese, tasty burger sauce and some other sauce made with tiny chopped veggies. It tastes like heaven and it is my favourite burger in the city. Chicken lite bites are 6 soft chicken strips. The outer covering is little crispy but get succulent while they are delivered but i like it that way. Chicken pizza is also good with huge amount of toppings, lots of cheese and soft crust. The brownie was basically chocolate muffin from mio amore. Their prices are very much affordable and extremely helpful for college students.

Order: Crispy Fried Chicken (Family Box)
Home delivery takes an hour or so. Staff is friendly and polite. As far as the food is concerned, I would give it a 3.5 out of 5. The taste isn't out of the world or extremely good, but it is appreciable and quite tasty. Portion size is good. By the time I got the delivery, the chicken had lost most of it's crispness. 
But it's is pretty mild on the pocket.
Overall, both food and service is appreciable.

We ordered from this place using online ordering from Zomato. We took the Chicken burger a la king only. The burger was a disappointment as it was not filling, the bun was too dry, the chicken in the burger too less, there was not enough lettuce or burger sauce. The only good part about the burgers was its price, good packaging and the quick delivery. We will try this restaurant again though, but not for the burgers.

Awesome food. Awesome service. One must try their fried chicken variety and pizza. Today we ordered fish fingers and it is the best bhetki fish fingers ever delivered to out door steps. Fresh and delicious. Highly recommend and Bravo to the restaurant. Hope they keep up the quality we received from them. KFC, PIZZA HUT AND DOMINO'S followers please try their food once. You won't regret. Thanks Zomato for their ratings and introducing Chicken King and Pizza Day to us.

I really like chicken burger, it has a bit of KFC style, not exactly though. I even like the roasted chicken pizza. Though not thin crust, but it's not bad.

A small cafe come restaurant near chowrasta.. pocket friendly and good place to spend time. The food is quite good if we consider the pricing, the coffee is 30 bucks only, you can spend some time with a coffee itself, waiting for someone or something else. The other food items are also good and tasty too.

Trying out eating joints in Behala can sometimes land you in a sticky situation and 'Chicken King & Pizza Day' sets the perfect example. The restaurant is located at Behala Chaurasta opposite the Vivekananda Girl's College. Home delivery seemed a good idea considering the current weather and the traffic scenario on DH Road. Since this was my very first order with CKPD, looked up the various combo deals on offer and went for a "Chicken Burger combo" (accompanied with french fries + 500ml Coke). The delivery took exactly an hour but what followed next was an unpleasant experience.🙀

⏹Chicken Burger - The Chicken Burger was nowhere near to what I was expecting. The sesame buns (with almost no trace of sesame😹) were dry and stale. The buns were too big and almost dwarfed the piece of meat underneath. Instead of a burger patty, they used a deep fried chicken fillet. The fillet didn't seem fresh and was chewy, an indication of frozen meat. Maustard sauce smeared on the fillet along with ketchup added a sweet and spicy flavor to the burger. May be some salad/coleslaw with some mayo could have helped with the overall dryness of the burger.😼

⏹French Fries - Though the fries were given in plenty they appeared to be over done and reeked of reused oil.😾
Overall very disappointing...NOT RECOMMENDED!!!

Price wise this place offers good combo deals at pocket friendly rates. The burger combo came to 160 INR after a 15% discount by Zomato. But most definitely not ordering from this place again owing to it's terrible quality and sheer recklessness with the food..😾👎

A good value for money. You have to pay only the amounts writing in the bill. Pizza tastes far better than Domino's. I will recommend everyone in Behala to try once atleast. :-)

This place is much better than it looks. And I'm giving it a 4.5 instead of 5 just because of the way it looks. Taking a look at it, would make you feel this is just one of the many average or below average restaurants and maybe they're only learning to cook food. The way the food is served is also very simple. But now I come to the taste. Last time I visited this place we took a Fiery Bengal medium pizza and lite bite. The pizza tasted like those of pizza hut and I'm serious. The crust was in fact better than what dominos makes. The lite bite was crispy and the boneless chicken pieces were soft. I thought it would be chewy when I ordered it. Just wanted to give it a try and thank god I did. We took a mayo dip along with it. I loved the food so much, I ended up visiting again. This time we ordered spicy chicken medium pizza with extra cheese and chicken popcorns and the mayo dip. The popcorns are like those of KFC, crispy on the outside, soft boneless inside. LOVED IT! I can't think of any better way of saying this. In terms of price, reasonable is not the right word. Compared to all the other places where I had pizza, and given the quality of food here, this is cheap.

Have ordered for home delivery from this place twice,so although I do not have much idea about the ambience,but got to say that their pizzas are out of the world! My personal favourite is the Chicken Extravaganza Pizza,with huge chunks of chicken marinated in spices ,accompanied by a generous amount of cheese.The summer veggie delight is also worth a try.

When you are fond of the Italian delicacy , pizza and when u live in Behala ,then you must not fail to visit this eatery. 

Location : It is a bit tricky. Basically you need to get off at Behala Chowrasta and head towards Disha eye hospital and you may spot the banner of this place . Follow the banner ,head straight and on your left will be the eatery. 
The space has an accommodation capacity of 20 people. 
The menu consists of pizzas, burger,and other appetizers. It also offers 4,5 kinds of desserts.
Now coming to the main part,the the taste is on point. Their pizzas have a speciality that pizza breads are highly soft and fresh. Generous amount of toppings will satisfy you, so will the taste. Pizzas are of 3 sizes and they are priced accordingly. The rates are generally pocket friendly .

They only accept cash and not cards. They don't charge tax as yet 

Final verdict : Yes, I'll visit this place again if I feel like having a pizza.

Visited this place a couple of weeks ago with some of my friends. The place is situated in the industrial area of Behala Chowrasta. I have heard many things about this place from many foodies and that's why I thought to try out this place. The place can be regarded as a youth zone. This restaurant can be compared with the likes of Dominos or Pizza Hut. We ordered Crispy chicken (Snack box), the chicken was very juicy but the covering was not that good. Tried their pizza's too. I tried their medium Veggie Mexican. The pizza was too good both in terms of price and taste and its a must try for all. My friends tried their Chicken Delight and Veggie Crunch Pizza. According to them the pizzas were good. And a last another shock for us that unlike others pizza stores they charge tax on their food but here it was all inclusive of taxes. So overall the place deserves a 4.

Today we had a grilled chicken pizza with extra cheese(for which they charged Rs 60 extra), but the amount of cheese they provided was actually like that of a regular pizza which was quite disappointing...their french fries are also not up to the mark...so basically this place needs a lot of improvment...

Ordered Chicken Maha Burger for the first time from this restaurant and that too online. Needless to say, I am super-pleased. The bun was soft, chicken fillet (KFC-like) with the cheese and the coleslaw salad made it all the more yummilicious and lip-smacking. There was no bone in the chicken as was mentioned in most reviews. I'm trying from there again. The burger made me happy!

My mom ordered garlic fish and noodles. I loved he taste of garlic fish. Noodles too was yummy.
The fried chicken (snack box) was a replacement of kfc crispy chicken at a much lower price. The choco fudge sundae was equally lipsmacking. In all a tasty experience. Looking forward to order more and visit more. Fast service. Reasonable rates. Sumptuous meal. After goin west this  adds to my fav list for food joints in behala. Best part,no unecessary taxes.

So it was chicken king n pizza day. I ordered for home delivery. Coming to service, it was prompt and quick and the food was delivered warm. Since I dint visit the outlet, I have no clue about the ambience but the staffs who came for delivery and whom I called for confirmation was friendly and helpful. Coming to the food, not much thing I ordered though. I settled for one tomato mushroom pizza and chicken cream pasta. For the pizza, the regular size was appropriate and the toppings were also abundant. Pizza was cooked nice. Proportion for pasta was also good and tasted really yummy. The only con I found in both the dishes was they lacked the taste of salt. Salt was very low and also I expected oregano and chilli flakes sizzlings to be served along with the pizza. The price was reasonable. Overall good experience. Hope to visit and try something new soon. :)

I ordered three large pizzas today and got it delivered within time as always and the food was tasty n delicious but for which I am not gonna give a 👍 is that I found a piece of glass and a sticker inside the pizza while chewing it. Its just luck that we figured it before swallowing or it could have been worse. So i suggest you if you order anything not only from here or anything please do chew the food pretty well n check it properly before swallowing. I know that it was an accident but they should be careful while serving us food. Apart from that the 3 pizzas were different in taste
1-Fiery Bengal :its kind of whitish due to cream @toppings n spicy
2-Chicken king Delight Pizza:it comes with cheesy top. But as you put it in your mouth it feels dry inside with a thick layer of stuffings
3-veggie Feast:its tasty n equally decorated with baby corns on top and its too good.
My personal pick from here is Fiery Bengal

 I submitted a  report for that glass and really Zomato forum instantly checked into the matter and did as much as they could 👍 Zomato

Got home delivery from this place last night and it was a delight. The delivery was on point and in time.Coming to the food, we ordered 3 medium pizzas and 1 regular. Chicken Supreme, Chicken Spicy and Chicken Extravaganza medium pizzas and another Chicken Spicy medium pizza. We ordered with extra cheese and the supreme was with extra jalapenos. What strikes you first is how extremely soft the bread is and how generous they are with the meat in the topping, both are huge plus points in my book. The pizzas were delicious with lots of cheese. The Chicken Spicy was really good, and Chicken Supreme became spicy with the extra jalapenos. Chicken Extravaganza was the best among the ones ordered. 
Will visit again.

Okay, first thing first. The ideal rating of this place should be 3.5, but I'm gonna give it 4. If you're wondering why, then keep reading.

1. It is pretty close to my place. And makes cheese chicken pasta.
2. You will always find it empty. Unlike other decent restaurants, you don't have to deal with the chitter-chatter of other people (most of the time).
3. The maha burger with cheese is so good, you won't be returning to KFC's zinger burger. And it only costs 90 bucks.
4. They make pizzas. Well it's not good as Domino's. But they deliver to my place. So yeah, that'll do.
5. No extra service tax. All taxes are inclusive, so there's no hidden cost.

You can try the beverages and desserts. I can't guarantee those will be good, 'cause I haven't tried any till now. One piece of advice: don't try the chinese here. It's terrible.

Recently they are serving very low quality foods. The quantity is less than that of before. Have ordered chili chicken n chicken fried rice.  Have to swim in the rice to find chicken. And the chilli chicken was sort of orange looking dish.  The pieces were full of may be a mix of atta  besan and chicken paste.  No solid pieces of chicken.

A decent place to  have  pizza and burgers. The burgers here taste really good. The pizzas are nothing extra-ordinary, but the price is reasonable. The Chinese meal combo is perfect for dinner.

Got home delivery from this place last night and it was a delight. The delivery was on point and in time.Coming to the food, we ordered 3 medium pizzas and 1 regular. Chicken Supreme, Chicken Spicy and Chicken Extravaganza medium pizzas and another Chicken Spicy medium pizza. We ordered with extra cheese and the supreme was with extra jalapenos. What strikes you first is how extremely soft the bread is and how generous they are with the meat in the topping, both are huge plus points in my book. The pizzas were delicious with lots of cheese. The Chicken Spicy was really good, and Chicken Supreme became spicy with the extra jalapenos. Chicken Extravaganza was the best among the ones ordered. 
Will visit again.

We had opted for a home delivery and had ordered two pizza, namely, Chicken Extravaganza(regular) and Spicy Chicken (regular) with extra toppings.

Chicken Extravaganza: The regular one costs you 180 INR. It was loaded with toppings of chicken and cheese. You won't be finding the pizza dry at all and would enjoy having it till the last bite. The taste was superb. Recommended!

Spicy Chicken: We had opted for extra toppings for this pizza. Hence, the total cost was 180 INR yet again with 20 INR being added to the price of the pizza, which was 160 INR. This pizza was a little offbeat and was a blend of Indian and Italian cuisine. The topping contributed to the Indian touch with the crust and the cheese with the other toppings adding to the Italian flavour. This dish is highly recommended!

The generosity that they have displayed with respect to toppings on their pizzas is highly appreciated. Even though the crust was a normal crust and not a thin crust, you won't ever find their pizzas dry, which is not the case with pizzas from other places. The prices are pretty reasonable. Although Zomato has an old menu, the prices have slightly increased. I am adding a picture of the present menu and hope that Zomato would update the same. I would love to visit this place some day and try their other items. A must visit for all pizza lovers.

Had opted for a takeaway hence can't comment on the ambience so let me jump straight into food.
Had ordered the following items-
1) chicken extravaganza(regular) [4/5]- priced at INR 180 ,the pizza was loaded with cheese and chicken! I usually like my pizza with ketchup else I find them a bit dry, but not with this one! This was infused with an amazing flavour of its own which the ketchup seemed to overpower and ruin so it's best had by itself! Really worth trying!! strongly recommended!👍

2) spicy chicken(regular) [4.5/5]- it is priced at INR 160 and we opted for extra toppings which was for another INR 20. This pizza is like a fusion of Indian and Italian cuisine! The topping had the Indian flavour of chicken tikka with cheese in abundance! The dish is pure love💗 This too wasnt dry at all and didn't need ketchup!
I am highly impressed with this food joint-the generous quantity of toppings and freshness of the food that too for such a reasonable price is something that will steal the heart of every pizza lover.The only thing that I didn't like here is the Italian seasoning that they had provided...it was almost tasteless!
A must visit joint that serves tastiest pizzas at such an affordable cost!

Had a lovely Veg Extravaganza Pizza. Comparable or better than any multinational brand. Super effort. Crisp crunchy veggies & mozzarella is something I fall for everytime. Also had a burger which is sort of like the indianised version of the zinger burger, more Spiced up, messy and very enjoyable.

We have tried hot wings, cheese chicken pasta with white sauce and pizza delight and lastly chocolate fudge ice cream. Though they serve tasty food but I think this place needs some improvement. Specifically they must have a wash room like other cafeteria/ restaurant and also needs improvement in service.

The place needs improvement. I had visited this food joint last month with my friends. As we entered, we were welcomed with suffocating smoke. Its recommended that they put up a chimney or something of that sort.
Coming to the food, we ordered 2 snack box which had 4 fried chicken. Although the food was good enough, they literally took ages to serve us and ONE OF THE CHICKEN WAS UNDERCOOKED. As soon my friend pinched out some meat from the chicken piece, blood came out.

First and foremost, it was very hard to find. I could not locate it even with the assistance of Google maps. However, the place is very small and peaceful. The pizza there was way beyond my expectations but what disappointed me was the size of the pizzas. Large are of the size of medium pizzas found in pizza hut. I wonder the size of a regular pizza there. Keeping that apart, it's a hidden gem. In a place like Behala, I could have never imagined finding such a decent pizza corner. Thank you zomato!

Only ordered online via Zomato. Food arrived within 30 minutes. Was very happy to get such a fast delivery but happiness got lost once I opened the pack. Both the pizza were cold. Ordered their combo meal (2 Medium pizzas of your choice+1 Russian chicken salad+Coke [600 ml]) , pizzas were : Veggie Mexican Pizza and Margherita Pizza. Tasted bad. I thought maybe it was due to cold factor, so I heated them up. Still it tasted bad.
Only thing a bit good was the chicken russian salad but unfortunately I couldn't find and chicken in it. :P

Pretty cheap for pizza, this is the pizza place for when you're running low on money. The crust and type of cheese used is not that great, but considering the price, it's easily acceptable. Their 10" is a medium size pizza according to Domino's standards, but is pretty filling. Ordered through Zomato and got it delivered within the time limit so no complaints there..... Overall, it was a pretty good experience. It's the pizza place to go to when you're almost broke in the money department, but rich in the craving department.

Now coming to the food, I ordered Chinese meal combo, &, veg pulao with chicken curry. It was delivered within time but the quality and quantity not worth the price. In the Chinese meal combo there was 2 plate chicken fried rice, chili chicken 10 piece.  The size of the chicken is very very small, it is totally full of cornflour, you need microscope to find any chicken piece within that. Some of them had no chicken at all, they are just cheating their customers. The taste was ok but not good. In place of veg pulao they sent me just veg fried rice, taste was very bad. Same for the chicken fried rice, no taste at all, just like it was a simple plain rice, you can hardly notice any chicken in it.  The smell of the chili chicken also very irritating. I never had this kind of chili chicken having a awkward smell.  They should improve the quality of the food.

Looks can be deceptive. I will start by saying this. This outlet is hardly 100 meters from the Diamond Harbour Road, and yet you might not ever have seen it. Located in Behala Chowrasta, this place is tucked away on the left side, if you are moving towards Taratala. But, it is quite difficult to spot. And hidden from view, lies a hidden gem. What this place lacks in surroundings and ambiance, it more than enough makes up for it through its food. We ordered the Maharaja Meal and Grilled Chicken Sandwich with coffee combo. The Maharaja Meal combo is made of the Maha Burger, french fries and milk shake. The Maha Burger was actually one of the best burgers we have had in quite some time now. It actually tasted as good as a similar item found at The Chaiwala of Tollygunje. The milk shake was really awesome and indeed deserves a special mention. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich too was very good, and so was the coffee. And it is very reasonable indeed so no worries there. We are not exaggerating here, but had this outlet been on the main road with a better visibility to people, this would have actually given other places a run for their money. We hope this outlet makes a bigger name for itself in the days to come.

The best place in Behala if you wanna go on a pizza hunt. It's super cheap and tasty and gives you a fair ambience. If you wanna get that rich experience, please do order for extra toppings. It's so cheap that the maximum price for a large pizza is just 320 bucks. 

Also, do try out the Iced Coffee with Ice cream which will cost you just 60 bucks. Try out Spicy Chicken with extra toppings.

The only drawback here is the location. It's not on the main road but a little on the inside near Behala Chowrasta.

No extra taxes.
All rates are inclusive of taxes.

The 1.5 stars i have given is solely for the ambience and nothing else. The location of this particular food joint is quite odd and hence is easy to miss. The service is not up to the mark. Food was below par and highly priced and also they seriously need to change the source of their drinking water. I don't know from where they supply it but what they serve as water is nothing but a salty fluid which cannot be ingested.

This place is located near the Chowrasta bus stop, inside the industrial estate. I went there during the Durga Puja on nabami. I had asked for a Mixed Hakka Noodles. The place itself is small yet nice, cozy and clean, with around four tables. The staffs were nice. I brought the parcel home. Regarding the food, the Mixed Hakka Noodles was well made with ample portions of chicken and prawn, the price too is pretty cheap as it only cost me around 100 bucks.
All over the taste was nice and am looking forward to trying some of their other dishes.

I have ordered their food through Swiggy. Liked the preparations. All the items tasted different, not like what you usually find at other restaurants. The prices are also reasonable. Satisfying quantity. Looking forward to visit them soon and try their pizzas too. Good to have a crispy chicken counter in Behala.

Area of Improvement: Would like to see more and better meat pieces in the fried rice.

One of the great places to have pizza. I and my wife (also my girlfriend) went there for the first time last sunday. It was a wonderful experience from the moment we entered. Though the seating capacity not huge the ambience was great. We ordered Veg extravagance pizza large and when it arrived it was a great  to taste as it was not stiff like that of the dominos. A freshly baked pizza with a baby corn strip. It came on a palate and we eat it within no time. we also took delivery of chicken pizza at home. Now the price was half of what at Dominos and inclusive of taxes. Looking to visit it once again and they have home delivery too.

Twice we ordered food from this cafe. We also visited the cafe once for coffee and snack session. The food quality always satisfied us. Be it pizza, burger or sundae, all the items were nicely done. Moreover, this cafe offers pocket-friendly foods, with no compromise in both quality and quantity. On a separate note, their quick delivery deserves a special mention. Overall, my vote goes for this cafe.

Ordered home delivery on a rainy waterlogged evening. Thanks to them for the service when the street was badly waterlogged. Food was nice and warm.
Hot wings could be tossed rather than fried. If fried, please mention that in the menu. Steam momo and pizza was nice. The momo soup was like a regular chicken soup and it was specially awesome. Food was nicely packed, tidy and presentable.
Price, I feel, could be bit cheaper since it's not a brand or franchisee.

I wasn't sure to order from here reading few negative reviews. But for me, the experience wasn't bad. Delivery time was a little late but the food wasn't as bad as many reviews read. I ordered few variety of momo's, salads and pizza. Quality of the food was good enough with its price, although the pizza wasn't that good. Momo's and salad tasted good. Overall it's standard food with the price tag.

We ordered veg extravaganza pizza(a large one). It was a 10 inches large pizza which satisfied our hunger as well as raised our taste buds! Recommended!

This chicken king outlet has been very helpful for the munchies.The burgers are good at that price, but the pizza is not upto the mark.Prices are moderate and service is okay.The fried items are quite satisfactory as well. A place worth trying ,overall, for the locals.

Ordered via swiggy .delivery was swift.bt the pizza was all soggy.plus it was way too spicy and salty ...not up to d mark.and they do not make the pizza bread from pizza dough. They simply use store bought base and put the toppings and cheese on it and then microwave it.the bread tasted like feet.not ordering from them.they cant even place d toppings on pizza uniformly.bad experience

Over the past few months I've been here several times and tried various items. I find their pizza to be the best. My personal favourite is spicy chicken pizza which is cheesy and and nice amount of toppings. 
The maharaja burger is tasty. 
Their crispy fried chicken is close to one sold at kfc in terms of taste.
The fried rice and noodles are tasty and sufficient for a single person.
The desserts are not that good.
I'll say their pizzas are a tough competition to one sold at dominos at half their rates.! 
Keep it up :)

This new place at Behala was in my wishlist for long....though i was pretty sure of what i was going to get there...i have been to the x- outlet chicken king at Ajanta before.....so we finally made to this one on a lazy afternoon for some pizza and fried chicken....ordered the medium chicken extravganza pizza which was a 8inch base with chicken toppings....the pizza tasted pretty good, nicely browned, good quality cheese....the base sauce was a little diluted and can be made thicker to give a better taste....

Then came the  fried chicken, the appearance is not close to the legendary KFC one, it looked more like some deep fried chicken pakodas but when i tok a bite, it tasted pretty close to it....so good job done there by the team however the chicken pieces were small and less meaty and hence was a little dry inside.....these are not complains since i will never expect a dittoo KFC at the price this outlet is offering but trying to compare them and conclude that KFC will always be way ahead but Chicken King is an extremely close and pocket friendly substitute which can surely lighten up your kitty parties or quick budget dates....

The restaurant is just opposite to the Vivekananda Girls college for women at Behala Chowrasta...a place with ample parking space and a quite surrounding but so close to the main road....the restaurant inside can accomodate around 18-20 people but i understood that they get most orders for home delivery....not a great deal of ambience or decor which is a big area of improvement....specially the oversized and blurred kolkata pics on the wall are a complete mismatch to what they offer and the name....we were the only guests and the server was polite and courteous.....food came in about 20mins which is acceptable for sure....hence all in all, a definitely worthy visit

Hi all,
I am yet to visit this place. But I have opted for home delivery.The pricing looked very moderate, especially when you are used to the overpriced Bangalorean restaurants and joints, like I am. I ordered the veg pulao and chicken combo for lunch.
1. Delivery : Delivery was on time. I asked the delivery guy to bring a pack of smokes as well and he was very accommodating. 5/5 on that.
2. Packaging: Packaging was good as well. It came in a plastic container with compartments, was covered so the food was warm. 4.5/5 for that.
3. Quantity: The food was enough for 1 person. I never hoped for more for 99/- INR. 2 pcs of chicken, rice, pickle, papad and a gulab jamun. 5/5 again
4. Quality needs improvement. The rice was nowhere close to pulao. It was vegetable fried rice. So they could have given that name in the menu in the first place. Chicken was delicious. The pickle should have been avoided as it smelled and tasted like months old. The gulab jamun was deep fried and tasty. So 3.5/5.

I had ordered for a chicken Maha burger with cheese and a pan fried momo with schezwan sauce. It was supposed to be delivered within 1:27pm according to the message sent by Zomato but when I called them around 1:40 they said they still did not check if any order was placed and they would call me within 2 mins. And yes i never got a call back!!  But around 2 o'clock they did deliver the food. And now coming to the food.. the pan fried momo was sticky and cold may be the packaging was not upto the mark because the schezwan sauce had already dried and was sticky or may be it was stale. The soup with the momo was floating with oil and it was not actually soup but chilli chicken gravy!!! The Chicken burger was ok but instead of spoiling the taste with too much of tomato sauce they could have just added lettuce leaves or may be raw tomatoes or onion rings. May be they can just increase the price a little and add the option of combinations so that people could choose. They can still do better if they take the reviews seriously :) :) Thank you !

This food joint has been recently opened in the area of Chowrasta inside a factory area. It is not much spacious and have place for only four tables.
The place provides a whole lot variety of items which comes in handy in case of home delivery.

#Food : We ordered pizza, chicken noodles, crispy baby corn and chocolate brownie sundae.
Can't complain about the noodles. Quite tasty & good quality in those price.
But the crispy baby corn & pizza could have been better without the sweet sauce.Personally I think the sweet sauce provided in the topping of pizza decease the taste.
Coming to the chocolate brownie sundae, I am literally disappointed. The "brownie" was actually those chocolate cake slices of Rs. 10 packets available in market. Quantity & quality of sundae are not upto the mark. I wont recommend this item there.

Service is good. Stuffs there are very welcoming. Its very much pocket friendly.

I ordered medium sized spicy chicken pizza.. And it got delivered before the promised time.. 
First of all I was bit confused as the size of the pizza was apparently small.. Then I reassured it by asking the delivery boy that whether it was medium sized or not..
Okay now coming to the taste of the pizza.. It was pretty good.. I liked it..
Overall I had a good experience..!!

I have been ordering for home delivery from Chicken King for quite sometime now. The food quality is decent but what I love the most here is the Indianised Pizza. It is something one should definitely try here iff you like variations of your beloved pizza. Delivery standards deserve a thumbs up.
                    

Update as on 25th Oct '17:
Ordered after quite some time. We ordered Fish Thali and Chicken Cheese Pizza. Although taste wise there is no much change but few things I absolutely hated.
1. The thali was delivered in a totally messy condition. It is the responsibility of the delivery person to carry it properly.
2. We ordered fish thali and to my much eww and yuck moment, found chicken bones in the gravy. If its fish then why not the chicken and fish gravy be prepared separately or atleast maintained separately. This was a horrible experience. And since my Mom ordered it, she is left in total distaste.
3. Cheesy chicken pasta was okay tastewise and also quantity wise, but the pasta was overcooked and of bad quality, which meant the pasta experience was not upto the mark.

Reducing my review stars. Totally unexpected food hygiene and quality.

Trust me, this place is just awesome. Firstly had heard about it from a friend, then ordered online for the first time to check how it is. The delivery was in time and the service was really good. The pizza was neatly packed,with all the necessities prodived in the box. Then i decided to visit the place with my boyfriend. Had a very good experience at the restaurant too. Tasty food,good atmosphere and most importantly very reasonable price, What else do you need! And yes,the place is a bit small, but is very clean and neatly decorated.

Just another pizza hub without any renowned franchise name, raised in the middle of nothing.

Coming to food :
Going by its name I suggested my friends to order pizza. 
So we ordered chicken mexicana medium , a honey lemon soda, and coke.
After about fifty (50) minutes they served us that pizza. Well it was thin crust, as per as taste it didn't at all taste like mexicana... It tasted like tikka...totally spicy like Indian...and how in seven hells a honey lemon soda could actually taste like that I wondered. When I asked the waiter abt it, he could do nothing but smile... I was highly disgusted. Lastly what was worse, the waiter himself took the tip all by himself without even granting permission. 

As per as price its cheap....which it should be otherwise it won't survive in this market!


NOT RECOMMENDED!

This is small joint located inside the industrial complex in Chowrasta. The inside can accommodate about 20 people I guess and you can pot to set outside in the small lawn too I guess.. The food here is allover average with some very good ups and equally bad downs. I have tried a lot of things here.. 
The standout dish here is the Chicken Maharaja Burger.. As a matter of fact, all the burgers are quite good.. The pizzas are good considering the price, Chicken Mexican Pizza would be the best if I had to choose.. Also the sandwiches are quite good.. 
But the Chilli Chicken is a complete letdown.. It was devastating to see only layers of cornflour over the most little of chicken.. We called them and complained but initially they seemed quite aloof about this.. Though they did call back after a few minutes and immediately apologised and sent another dish within half an hour but quite surprisingly this dish too contained the same type of chicken pieces.. Also the chicken popcorn has the same story..
Overall a place where you can maybe go for a evening snack at pocket friendly prices.. 
P.S.- The Cold Coffee with Ice Cream is very good.. I would have given 3.0 if not for that..

Chicken king & pizza day. Was really excited when I first heard about this place. Went out on a Sunday to try their food. Called ahead and asked for the directions to the restaurant so it wasn't hard to find. The restaurant is kinda tiny. But I don't think they have a problem with the seating as most of their customers order online. We ordered the maharaja combo. We got a maharaja burger, fries and a milkshake. Service took some time. Quite sometime actually. Not as fast as other burger outlets where service is extra quick. Waiting wasn't that bad with music playing in the background. Backstreet boys, Akon, etc. Coming to the food. When it finally arrived at our table we were pleased to see the quantity of what we were served. The burgers were huge and the fries were aplenty. The milkshake was enough too. Now coming to the taste. The burger was very dry. The buns were the main contributor to the humongous size of the burger. Not the pieces of chicken or the mayo or the coleslaw. Disappointed. The fries were over cooked so in the end it was a challenge just finishing it. The milk shake was fine. After eating and going back home. We spent the next hour in the bathroom. We both got food poisoning. Maybe hygiene is a concern here. So, because of this won't be visiting again and won't recommend it either. At least not for burgers. Maybe their pizzas are good and worth a try. Can't say. But for burgers. Go elsewhere.

The place is small and new but the pizza is good. Unlike other places which serves you pizza the pizza here will give you a feeling of a home made pizza and the price is really less and the quality is good enough. Best thing is that you get a bit of kfc n pizza hut flavour in this single place.

I am ordering food from this resturent since a long time.and always my experience was good.but today I order chicken chees burger and lite bite. Trust me friends it's a horrible experience.the burger bun is huge big according to the paty. And I have to search chicken with a magnifying glass.the portion of the chicken was really bad.I feel that I gave 80 rs for the burger bun.
Next item the chicken lite bite.I ate chicken lite bite many time.and always it's yum. Bt today it's really bad.there is no crispyness. And again the portion of the chicken was very poor.

I got the food on home delivery, so I cannot talk about the ambience. The large Margherita pizza was nice, a little small and doused in oregano but the crust was wonderful and soft. The small chicken supreme was full of flavour but the crust was a bit overdone. Finally, the fried chicken was very good, crispy and juicy. The only real negative is that I did not the french fries I had ordered along with it.
In short, the food is good, tastes like a home cooked meal, but it could be better

Order for a chicken maha burger with cheese, the burger was great with double chicken patty, cheese and sauce. It was delicious. The other one was a chicken extravaganza pizza. I did not like the pizza very much. It was loaded with chicken but i found it ordinary. The delivery was quick.

An impulsive hunt down on zomato landed me on this page,and the next thing i did,after of course going through a couple of reviews,was placing an order  for a large Chicken Extravaganza Pizza and Chicken Burger A la King.They took roughly 20 minutes to deliver the order to my place.I must admit,this eatery can give a stiff competition,to all the leading pizzerias out there. Right from the crust,down to the generous amount of topping of chicken and cheese,you can't get enough of a pizza from this outlet.I urge you to try a pizza from here atleast once.
As regards the burger..I found it quite dry...it needs further improvements...
I am glad,I ventured forth ordering from a rather unknown place,which didn't make me regret...it was worth the choice.All the best wishes to you...flourish :)

Didnt know this restaurant existed. Installed the Swiggy app and was browsing through the nearby restaurants when this restaurant's menu caught my attention.

So cant comment on their delivery or the ambience. At least they prepared the food quite fast for the Swiggy Delivery agents to deliver on time :)

Ordered 
Chicken & Capsicum with Corn Sandwich - Big sized bread. Bit spicy which suites my buds. Chicken quantity should be little more ;) 
Family Box - Crispy Fried Chicken - If you are bored eating KFC, this is a good alternative.

Small but nice place. chicken fry was a bit dry, though the size was very good in terms of price. The maha burger was very good and the choco shake was excellent. It was so cremy and thick. Over all its a good place to have snacks kind of food.

Me and my friend went their like saw it on Zomato and just went as it was superclose to our home...the interior of this place is ok ok..the ambience is good though..nice ceramic lamps light music...though the service was not as prompt as we expected....the prices are reasonable...now lets come down to our order..we ordered a snack box and one chicken maha burger with cheese..one iced tea with mint and a Choco shake
..the chicken was quiteeeeee drym..it looked like crispy chicken but didnt taste that good but the size of them were huge...but the burger was a killer...omg it was juicy crispy and the salad and the home made sauce of them was finger lickingly good...i just loveeeddd the burgerr..it was realllyy tasty..now the iced tea it didnt atall tasted like iced tea it was more of a detox water amd most importantly it wasnt cold at all..infact it was hot...and by the end of that drink it tasted soo bitter that we had to leave it in its own place😬😲now comes the game changer the shownstopper that item which made me so crazy that i cudnt help myself but add another .5 rate..otherwise it would have been 3.5...the choco shake...guys it was one of the best shakes ever..it wax creeaaamyyyy...smoooothhh...choclatieee...arghhhh divine it was..and for 60bucks????its a stealllll...but to take this place on another level they really need to work on their service and the recipe and the method of their cooking in case of Fried Chicken...but as a whole we liked the place..andi tottalllllyy recommend everyone to give it a visit...

Food was delivered to my doorstep within 30 minutes of placing online order.It was warm and well packed.
I ordered schezwan chicken fired rice,boneless chicken in spicy schezwan sauce and Russian chicken salad.
The fried rice was tempting,the schezwan chicken had loads of spicy gravy.Loved the russian chicken salad,the chicken and the vegetables were submerged in yummy mayonnaise.
They provide sumptuous meal at a very competitive price and is close to my place.I'd certainly try out the other dishes soon.

Now...from where should I start...I never in my wildest dreams thought that a place like this will ever come into existence. Its a heaven for KFC lovers.I ordered through swiggy one family box of crispy chicken. It arrived at my doorstep in less than 30 minutes. There were 6 large chicken pieces and a garlic mayo dip. The chicken pieces were hard and crunchy on the outside and soft and extremely juicy on the inside. To be honest, at some point I thought its better than KFC...at damn cheap rates. We here at behala are extremely lucky to have Chicken King. I cannot wait to order again and try their pizzas. Made my day

Chicken King N Pizza Day is one of the new food hubs among the numerous other places which has come up in recent years. I have been hearing a lot about this place from my foodie friends. So after reading the reviews I decided to go for this place. 
I ordered online these following things:
#Mango Milkshake
#Chicken Wings
#Chicken Mexican Pizza

=| SERVICE: First talking about the service. The service was pretty fast. It came within 25 minutes after my order and that's a positive thing. The behaviour of the delivery boy was good.

=| PACKAGING: The packaging was good. The wings was packed in a box properly and it was warm. The pizza was packed well too with tissues and sufficient number of tomato ketchups, chilli flakes and oregano. The mango shake was packed well but they forgot to give a straw. They should be lil attentive about this.

=| FOOD: The Mango Shake was synthetic and the flavour was not all that great. The shake was more in the dilute side which could have been lil thicker.
The Chicken Wings was ordinary and tasted decent.
The Chicken Pizza was the best of the lot. The taste was really good and it was well made. The chicken chucks were nice in numbers and the tangy mexican taste was feeling good in the tongue.

Last Words:
If you are bored with those same dominos and pizza hut pizzas, this place offers you some good quality pizza in a very reasonable price. Well, definitely a good place to have some pizza nearby.

Just yesterday my boyfriend told me about this place and today I had to order pizza at home. I ordered the Chicken Supreme Pizza (Large). The order reached my doorstep in less than 30mins. The delivery boy was very polite. The pizza was incredible. At just Rs.320 that too a Chicken Supreme Large Pizza is seriously worth it. It tasted too good. It had 6 big slices of pizza with lots of pieces of grilled chicken. It was seriously very tasty. The base and crust was soft. Not hard like the pizza of few renowned places. I loved the pizza. It was very tasty and we all loved it. I have no idea about the seating arrangements and the restaurant's interior, decor, ambience and in-house service but i am really glad with their food quality and home delivery service. Both food quantity and quality in such less price is a big 👍

Today I ordered chicken supreme medium size pizza with extra cheese from this outlet . I heard so many good things and good positive feedback about this restaurant in zomato. But frankly speaking I didn't like it much. Pizza base was fluffy and it's was never close to dominos or pizza hut. Other thing I am very much doubt about the size that they have mentioned. Asper them regular pizza should be 8inch but trust me guys I am pizza lover and had dominos medium pizza alone so so many times . but this one doest not look like it was close to that. Well if you spend little more money then you can enjoy good pizza from dominos or pizza hut.

Being bored of eating the same pizza from the Domino's, and absence of sufficient KFC outlet in the city, people of Behala,Tollygunge and other neighboring areas got a pure bliss with this fast food joint which serves yummilicious Pizza and chicken preparations. In fact this place deserve footfall from all over the city for its wide range of offering, and mouth watering taste.
Right inside Behala Industrial Estate, is located this place, very neat and Peaceful ambiance with a charming décor.
Service is prompt, and the food is genuinely fantastic with alluring presentation. Portions and pocket pinch is absolutely fine.
A must visit for all the foodies out there for some mouth watering chicken and pizza cravings.

I have been planning for a long time to visit  'Chicken King N Pizza Day', but somehow I could not chalk a plan. Today, I suddenly had the urge to have pizzas. So, I thought of giving it a try. This shop is very conveniently located at Chowarasta more. It is in the Behala Industrial Complex, just beside 'The Gold Factory'. The space within the eatery was small and the ambience was okayish. The food, however, made up for all these shortcomings. I ordered a 'Lite Bite' first, which is a dish having fried boneless chicken strips. The strips were served with a chilli and tomato paste. The 'Lite Bite' was a perfect appetizer. The chicken strips were crispy,juicy and delicious to say the least. I loved the dish. Next, I ordered 'Chicken Supreme Pizza with extra cheese'. The food took ten minutes to arrive. I took the regular sized one, but this size can put any regular sized pizza of Pizza Hut or Domino's to shame. I was not expecting the size of the pizza to be satisfactory. But, I was surprised. The first bite gave me food orgasm. It was delectable,yummy and delicious. I apologise for the redundancy in the previous statement but that is the only way that I can express the heavenly taste of the pizza. The staff is well-behaved. Brownie points for that. All in all, a great eatery, that too near my home. I will visit it again and again.

Fair amount of cheese as well. Now I am not a pizza person but I loved this one. It was fresh and juicy. Do give them a try :)

I have been a frequent customer to this joint for a very long time. Sometimes I visit the outlet to enjoy a burger and sometimes I order them from home. They make good basic burgers at a very low price. And the appetizers are good too. The chicken lite bites, nuggets, and some of the other that I tasted. The fried chicken is tasty as well. Mostly, their food is good. So is the service. The online ordering service especially is great. The chinese Items are good as well.
And surprisingly, I find their pizzas very tasty. Be it the vegetarians or the non veg section. Go visit this little joint for a little bite sized happiness.

This type of joints are really famous in Mumbai, people selling burgers and pizza of good quality at dirt cheap price when compared to the likes of McDonald and Pizza huts.

In that enthusiasm I tried this place for a change and I can say it didn't leave a nice taste, but definitely not the one to forget.

Burger quality was below par given the price charged. Bread was nice and soft but the fillings in between was confusing. Looked like half baked chicken cutlet without the bread crumbs was put in with a slice of cheese.

Coming to the Fiery bengali pizza, it was a thin crust pizza - that I guess they tried to prepare but failed miserably as it was already rubbery by the time it arrived. Toppings were adequate with cheese covering the base.

All in all this experimental experience went well but I would not 100% recommend it as I feel a few extra bucks can fetch you a quality meal!!!

Situated in a lane opposite Vivekananda College for Women, Chicken King N Pizza Day is a nice little restaurant and a much needed burger joint in Behala. 

At moderately cheap rates, Chicken King was surprisingly awesome.

We have had KFC style fried chicken, burgers, wings and strips and have never once been disappointed. Servers are polite but Dont expect your food to come in minutes, though they are still quicker than most places. It is a 20 seater restaurant.

The prices are extremely affordable and this a complete value for money place.

Finally a good fast food joint in Behala..Amazed to see the quality of food.Quite good I must say.Ordered a maharaja meal and was very happy with the quanity of the food.Since I had ordered for home delivery I guess I was told that the minimum delivery was for 200 bucks but as my order was only for 180 I was ready to top it up with something but the operator was generous enough to pass the order for 180! I will give a thumbs up for this gesture & also for the quick delivery.I will now order from this place regularly :)

Did not expect a Pizza Joint like this in Behala, that too so close to my house. The pizza was delivered within 25 minutes and the taste of both pizza and pasta was quite good. Only a little less spicy will make it even more delectable..
Will no longer miss Pizza Hut or Dominos Pizza if we crave for pizza.

1. The delivery was on time.
2. The pizza wasn't excellent but it was good.
3. The dry chilli chicken was just horrible. Too much cornflowers used to make it thick and too much spicy and it wasn't tasty either.
4. Very pocket friendly.

Its a new snaks joint in our locality. Opened on 14th september 2015, just 5 months ago. Its located opposite the women's college of chowrasta, inside the industrial complex of behala. Its a small joint having siting capacity of 20. It is air conditioned. They have also some outside sitting option. Regarding food i must say they are value for money. They offer kfc-style chicken fry, domino's-style pizza having both veg & non-veg options, mcdonald-style burgers, few options for rice and chowmins and some deserts and milk shakes. I ordered crispy chicken and chicken supreme pizza. The chicken fry tastes really good. It tastes similar to kfc's original reciepe fried chicken. Regarding pizza i must say that one must not expect something that tastes like dominos. But they taste really good. And the good thing is that they prepare the bread by themselves, so you are getting fresh pizzas everytime. They can be called a substitute of dominos pizza. Yet to try their burgers and other item. I highly recomend this food joint. Its very ideal for lover couple, college friends and for family visit too.

To see a restaurant like chicken king and pizza day at behala is a great benefit.Ordered a chicken supreme pizza,fried chicken with garlic mayo dip,chicken maha mac,veg pulao and chicken curry meal box.The pizza was really good.The meal box was also good.The fried chicken had too much coating.The burger was a letdown as the bun was stale.The prices are reasonable but it needs to be constant.Overall it was a good experience.Hopefully it runs well.

Tried out their food again in recent times.Excellent.Veg pulao with fish(sumptuous portions and excellently prepared..to add pickle and a gulab jamun) for 100 bucks...It can't get better.Can easily compete with the Koshe Koshas,6 Ballygunge Place and othera...Excellent burger (Maharaja Burger chicken) a must try...Chicken strips with garlic dip and Mayo dip....Russian salad is fine..And all this for 530 approx...Seriously !!! Amazing...Behala has truely been put on the food map..A sincere prayer that it maintains the standards and blooms more..Cheers !

Tried the fried chicken wings and french fries. Not that great. Very economic though. But at similar prices, Sai Taka Tak gave KFC a harder competition. Liked the Garlic Mayo which comes with an added price of 30 rupees. Can't comment on the pizza.Delivery was on time and efficient.

Definitely a place for all school and college goers. Good food with a very less pinch in your pocket. It's located in the industrial area just opposite to the women's college in behala chowrasta. Must try would be their chicken tikka pizza. With a very thin crust comes great pizza. Hope to visit soon.

Right opposite Vivekananda Women's College, Behala, tucked away inside the lane is this quaint little eatery hidden from the public view. It has a calm ambiance though with limited seating options. Food is really good considering the prices. My friend and I ordered the Chicken Supreme Pizza, Hot Wings and coffee. High on taste and pocket-friendly, this place should definitely get more exposure. We were the only ones in the place at that time and the boy who attended us was well-behaved. An overall worthwhile experience and would like to revisit Chicken King N Pizza Day soon.

This place is small but cozy. Staffs r nice. Coming to the food it was okayish not that great. 
We ordered Egg Noodles, Chicken Cheese Pasta, Chicken Maha Burger and Veg Burger With Cheese.
 Egg noddles could not stand up well. It lacked seasoning n was partly cold, so couldnot enjoy much of it. 
Chicken cheese pasta was good to taste but was dry n pasted were a bit undercooked. It could have been better.
Chicken burger was nice with two deep fried chicken pieces. 
Veg burger was okay too. 
The sole advantage its cheap n quite near to my house. So if anyday i feel like having fried chicken or burger i can just call for a home delivery. I would like to try their pizza someday.

At moderately cheap rates, Chicken King was surprisingly awesome. Very few people know about this joint. I wonder why. Hope this review gets more people from Behala to try the next best thing to KFC there is, here. Have tried the Maha Chicken Cheese Burgers, which taste really awesome for 90bucks. Fried chicken is juicy and delish (yes, the chicken have skin). They did not charge any VAT for my delivery, which is again surprisingly wonderful. I have a feeling, this is going to be my favourite getaway joint.

The most amazing pizzas, southern fried chicken and burgers can be found right here, in the heart of Behala. This place which used to be near Ajanta area recently shifted to the Behala Chowrasta Industrial estate for whatever reasons and is a bit tough to spot on the way unless you know the address before hand. But the one thing that hasn't changed about this place is the food, which is as brilliant as it used to be.
We have had KFC style fried chicken, burgers, wings and strips and have never once been disappointed. Servers are polite but Dont expect your food to come in minutes, though they are still quicker than most places. It is a 20 seater restaurant.
The prices are extremely affordable and this a complete value for money place. 
I highly recommend the Chicken Supreme Pizza which has three kinds of chicken as topping and it was probably the best pizza I have ever had. The cheese had browned beautiful and the crust was just perfect in thickness, right between thick and thin crust. I can't stop gushing about it!

Great taste and pocket friendly. The delivery is also very good. Try the chicken supreme pizza. But If you need to order for two people then go for the large size.

Forget Domino's, forget MacDonald,if you are a 'Behalabashi', this is a food joint you surely mustn't miss. A lovely little place, that serves great pizza and burgers at reasonable price and no added tax. A place foodies shouldn't miss.

A much needed good burger joint in Behala region. I ordered the Chicken Maha Burger, which turned out to be pretty good. The service is fine. Worth for a recommendation.

Pocket-friendly and quality fast food. Burgers much better than those in conventional burger joints. Chicken stuffing was fantastic, but having an affinity towards juicy stuff, I'd suggest more white sauce and molten cheese. Burgers taste better that way, I believe. Pizzas are delicious. Overall, nice joint. Recommended. Would go again.

Situated in a lane opposite Vivekananda College for Women, Chicken King N Pizza Day is a nice little restaurant and a much needed burger joint in Behala. Service is good and fairly quick. We ordered the Chicken Burger meal. The chicken was nicely cooked and accompanied by the generous slice of cheese, the burger tasted very good. The French fries were okay-ish. The ambiance here is good hence a option for hang out. It is a very pocket-friendly place with generous portions of food. I would definitely recommend people to try this place out.

Update from 08.11.2015 :

I had to increase my rating after trying out their pizzas. We ordered the Chicken Supreme and Chicken Extravaganza pizzas. Both were absolutely delicious. The bread was soft and fresh, baked with a heart-melting amount of cheese and toppings. At such reasonable rates, the pizzas were perfect and filling.

Saw this place near Behala Chowrasta and decided to order as wanted to try something new. The delivery was as promised within 60 mins. The packing was nice and the food was hot. I ordered the dinner box combo which had 3 big pieces of fried chicken, fries and coke. I have to say was very happy with the quality, taste and quantity. Hope you can maintain this and will surely order again.

A nice place, easy to locate and a much needed burger and pizza joint in Behala. Service is good, talking about the burger, I would say everything was good except the bread tasted a bit stale. Anyways, a much better burger than McD, a must visit for everyone.
