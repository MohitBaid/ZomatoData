Ordered Lemon chicken and hakka noodles from this restaurant. The hakka noodles was ok although it was simply fried without any vegetables. The Lemon chicken was the worst. Seems like they do not even know the receipe of Lemon Chicken. I could not even have it. Would never order again from this restaurant.

The order was very late and the food also didnt taste good. I ordered lacha parantha and shahi paneer.
Lacha parantha was quite ok, but shahi paneer was not at all good.

i ordered pan fried chicken.. it was good but the preparation could have been better. Also ordered Laccha paratha and chicken kadai,it was pretty good. But the delivery boy was worthless.

Delivery time is usually longer. Food quality is average.  But today I found a piece of plastic in the paratha. Also had to take out lots of oil from the Paneer Tikka Masala. But this is not tolerable.

Delivery was on time. However, the quality of chicken used in chilli chicken was not good. They tried to make it tasty but the coating used made all efforts in vain. They do no charge any extra other than the amount shown in zomato.

There was no potato in Chicken Biriyani which is the essence of taste. Taste was not so good. Donot give extra money other than the money shown because they provide a hand written bill which in which they adds GST amount, delivery charge and container charge.
