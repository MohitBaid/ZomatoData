Food was upto the mark but service was terrible. Even though the place was almost empty, the waiters were forgetting to serve half of things we were ordering. We ordered The Great Gatsby and Shades of Grey on their suggestion. The Great Gatsby was all stuffed with ice. It was like 70% ice and rest real cocktail. The taste was good though. Coming to the food, everything was more or less delicious. The pizza deserves a special mention, it was probably the best pizza I ever had. Also, food quantity is tiny.

An amazing place to chill out with your friends. We tried the Cocktail Goblet of Fire , Kamikaze shots and two more Cocktails .The people at the bar are very friendly and nice .Special mention goes to Jyoti for her amazing hospitality and giving us one shot of complimentary drinks too.They made sure we have a gala time there with the right music and the atmosphere.

Went here for lunch with a friend and the food was absolutely wonderful.From preparation to presentation, it was very pleasing. We specially enjoyed the Tangra chilli Chicken, which was a perfect amalgamation of sour and spice .  
Looking forward to visiting this place again.

It was christmas and I had an eye on this place for long.. Finally got a chance to drop in.. We reached here during the lunch hours. This place was way less crowded than other places in Park Street so we were kinda happy about that. Let me come to the review of this place and the food
*Decor : It has two levels . The ground level being the bar and hookah place. The top level is where we decided to go for and I instantly fell for the quirky and cute decor.. This was the perfect kind of insta picturesque place.. Vintage stuff, pop art, abstract decor.. In a word it was pretty
Rate - 5/5

*Food : let's come to the main part.. We ordered four dishes
1. Chicken Bao : cotton soft bao with tangy chicken and veggies filling.. They hade gondhoraj lemon zest which elevated the task of the entire dish
Rate - 5/5
2. Soupy dumpling bowl : tangy soup with flat noodles and chicken dumpling served with egg. This dish was huge in quantity. A single bowl can fill two hungry stomachs easily.. Very light in taste prefect amount of spice and tang..
Rate - 4.5/5
3. Shroom balls : cheese and mushroom balls.. Well they were a disaster I must say.. They had a weird taste and a weird smell too .. We couldn't eat the dish as it was making us nauseous.. But the best part is that the staff changed the dish immediately and adjusted the price with the dessert.
Rate - well let's just leave that
4. Bodega bomba : the dessert looked so pretty the presentation was so adorable that I literally didn't wanted to destroy the dessert... Everything on the plate was candy pink.. A red velvet cake with raspberry crush, and a raspberry sorbet.. Its tasted good as well but the presentation is what took my heart away
Rate - taste : 3. 8/5
presentation : 10/5 :p
The Staff were really well behaved and attentive 
Over all I rate this place a 4.5/5
Its worth a visit

A pretty interesting place to party with your close ones. My favourite destination while I come during festive seasons to Kolkata. The shots and some of the cocktails are truly amazing , and the live music or the DJ adds more to it. One of the best places to visit in Park Street. Look for a table downstairs where the DJ is present and enjoy your time.

special mention: large range of cocktail n drinks.. and bodega's presentation of the drink is really superb. last important thing u may found tht the price are little higher.

This is good place to chill over some amazing cocktails with friends. We ordered The Great Gatsby and Shades of Grey. Their presentation is beautiful ‚ù§ Great Gatsby was a treat to the eyes. The white bubbles were coming out of it. It was whiskey based and tasted like coconut water. Shades of Grey was amazing too. It was vodka based. And fumes were coming out of it. A coconut shell was placed on top of it. It was tasting superb. Both of their quantity was huge. Ambience wise was good too. Their only fault was their volume of music. Ground floor was too loud whereas first floor was too low. Other than that I loved this place totally.

Was there for my girlfriends‚Äô birthday with a few close friends and was generously introduced to a New Meaning of Valet Parking. Apparently the Valet service is instructed to leave your car unattended on the street about a kilometre from the establishment without informing you. Further they close the front entrance adding another 2 blocks to be walked down.
When asked to contact the manager about the issue, the attendant left us standing outside for about 30 minutes and yet the manager didn‚Äôt show up. Overall I would not suggest car owners to drive into this establishment unless 
Food-okay
Cocktails- good
Waiters - good but occasionally stare at you eating and talking 
Hospitality- poor

really nice place! good and spacious! the ambience is also nice.Though i had gone there with a little less appetite than usual , i did manage to over eat.I had visited here quite a while back so i will try my best to justify this memory with whatever my memory can help me with. Though my palate memory is intact so nothing beyond that i  guess.To start with i had the Baked brie , very well presented with assortments of salads and fruits and a decent portion of brie cheese baked inside a pastry. The taste was really nice but i have had better quality of brie in Kolkata in other places. Then i ordered a vietnamese coffee . It was brilliant , i actually took another serving of that. After the two followed the main course which was an asian meal / bowl with teriyaki sauce. The taste was good but nothing out of the world.

Overall a good experience . Hopefully will visit once more with some more appetite!

Happened to visit this place last Friday and it was a good experience. The quirky decor accentuated with some foot tapping music leaves a lasting impression on the customers. The food is good. I had some Bbq chicken pizza, Nachos and some Tacos coupled with Gondhoraj Mojito. The food was fresh and lip smacking. 
The long windows will provide ample sunshine to cozy up with a book on winter afternoons. It's a must visit if you want to catch up with some friends or your partner. Price is reasonable too.

Came here to have a nice 'chilled out' time with friends and letting my hair down after a long weekend. And a nice chilled time I did have. Along with discussions on politics and the state of affairs. The place is fantastically done up. It's got a fresh vibe to it, and since I had just tried a few finger foods I am limiting my review just till there. Having said that, Their menu did look like these guys had really put in a lot of effort and tried to recreate and experiment. Something like that always wins my vote. So based on the appetizers and the good time that I had served up by this place I would recommend this place a good visit on a Saturday night when you just want to unwind with buddies and relax.

Visited this place with a friend of mine on Friday night. This place is just beside WIDN, and consists of two floors, the first floor being a sort of small bar/pub whereas the second floor is like a family style restaurant. 

My friend is well known in their restaurant as he conducted numerous wine training practices with them and hence we got some free beers and mock tails on the house. In my own personal experience, they play really loud music so if you wanna smoke shisha and talk with your friends, trust me, your voice will get drowned in the music. The food was really good, we had pasta in white sauce. The manager was really nice as well, along with their servers. 

The hookah and the food costed us rs1200+, not including the beers and the mock tail. It is a bit expensive but the experience is worth it.

I visited this place for my birthday lunch with my girl and we were pleasantly surprised by the amazing cocktails and good food.


Ambience and Deƒáor: The ambience is great,the ground floor is the bar area and the first floor is the dining area.We decided to be seated on the first floor,I loved their deƒáor,large window panes
were letting a good amount of light inside which is lovely.

Food and Drinks:

Cocktails:

The Bubbling Bombay: This is one of the better cocktails I have had,perfect presentation and the taste equally good.It was a blend of bacardi gold,basil leaves and bhang.A bit on the sweeter side but I loved it.

Thai High: This was a refreshing cocktail,consisting of lemon grass,absolut vodka and lychee juice.


Food:

Wild Mushroom Pizza: Very flavourful,thin crust pizza,the mushroom and cheese were perfect in quantity and tasted amazing.It was filling aswell.

Service:

The service was good,the server was courteous and attentive.

Recommended for a romantic lunch/dinner.

Somehow ended up going to bodega , the food is seriously average and everything was a tad bit spicy.
The quantity of food is small and the justification given by the waiter is that you get to try more things in the menu that ways.

We ordered the pot stickers veg which was ok ,
Dimsums in peking sauce was average and can be given a miss, also some mushroom shawarma was bad .

The only good thing about the place was the mains we ordered the wok noodles in black pepper sauce which was good.

The place can be given a miss . Better places out there with better quality food.

Located opposite the Allen Park entrance, Bodega Cantina Y Bar is sprawled over a wide area. On entering there is a seating arrangement in the ground floor, with high chairs and wall hangings all around. The main diner is upstairs, which is nicely decorated with ample lighting. From a Bar cum Restro of such likes, one is expected to have high hopes automatically, and so did I, only to be disappointed at the end. To start with, most of the items from the food menu were not available, specially the Non Veg Chakna Box that I wanted to try out. Nevertheless, we opted for Chicken Wings which had portion too little to suffice for even one person. The only good thing was the innovative cocktails served with a twist. So, don't expect too much from this place when it comes to food, though you can surely visit to try their wide range of quirky cocktails.
I would think twice before visiting again.

This place is located around the corner of camac street and Park Street crossing. Went there for a bhai dooj on Sunday evening. Had a lot of expectations from this place but to my surprise found this place to be empty and got seated immediately. Ground floor is a loud music playing pub and 1st floor is a family dining area. Interiors are not at all appealing and lighting is extremely poor. We started with some appetisers and mocktails. When asked the server he gave very weird suggestions. As per him we decided to go with cigar filos and chose empanadas ourselves. Serving portions were extremely small and no one even bothered to let us know that it‚Äôs not sufficient for 8 people. Apart from that both these dishes tasted awful. We ordered some lemongrass based oriental drink and cinco de mayo. Again not worth mentioning. We then asked him about main courses and he kept on suggesting Thai curry and risotto which we didn‚Äôt wanna have.  We decided to try their mezze platter - again a let down. Then we had to finally settle down with couple of servings of rustic pizza, Parsi box, noodle bowl and pasta. Place is extremely pricey for small portions, ill-trained staff, poor ambience and of course poor quality food.

Bodega cantina y bar,the name is quite a mouthful. Located near barbeque nation park Street this place is quietly building a reportaire for themselves.it was suggested many times by friends and being on my home turf I gotta had to check it out.
Ambience- the club atmosphere below is rocking and the restaurant above is charming enough. There is something to offer to every kind of person.the party animal to the quiet brooding intellectual.
Food- I did not try much of food but whatever I had it was very tasty n I enjoyed eating it but the real stars are the drinks. The drinks are very innovative specially the bhang one and a lotta effort is put on there presentation as each drink had it's own look n effect. There is lotta variety in cocktails so cheers.
Service- warm enough,the people were gracious and serving time was also not long.
Price- tad overpriced but nothing exorbitant. 
Overall highly recommended,loved the place n will come back for seconds n maybe thirds. Just drop in n have a lovely time.

Visited this place on a very special day with a very dear Guest and I was so happy that my visit ddnt go in vain.  

The food was delicious. 
Gondhoraj infused fried Bass and cheese fondue.  Pretty decent presentation as well.  

What really blew my mind was the simplicity and taste of the beverages we ordered.  

A mejico mule which was an absolute delight and beautifully created.  And a non alcoholic Kiwi and basil refresher which was amazing equally.  

Yeah,  the prices are a bit on the higher end but when you get good stuff,  the crunch doesn't hurt. 
Decor of the place is so cool. A mix of retro, vintage and modern.  

I will surely visit the place again.

This place is quite cool, and impressive. Food was very good. Decor was simple yet good. 
We ordered beef chilli fried, beef momo, bacon wrapped prawn, pizza. Beef chilli fried and beef momo just won my heart. Now, let's come to drinks. We had kamakazi, one vodka cocktail , and goblet of fire (literally it was fire :D). Prices were overpriced and that's the reason I deducted the points. It can be visited second time without having any doubt.

P.s: Please visit washroom atleast once, you will get something surprising.

The name of this establishment itself is intriguing enough to pull a curious foodie like me.. On top of that the wide array of interesting cuisines and lesser heard dishes are definitely a plus.. Located close to Allen Park, on the crossing leading to Camac Street, this place is a paradise for foodies willing to experiment with flavors and ingredients.. We were seated in the outer section with a bar and few high tables.. Even the chairs were innovative and each table consists of differently designed chairs.. They also have a small smoking room.. What's interesting is the fact that most of their servers were woman.. Service could definitely improve big time in terms of serving time, courteousness and professionalism.. This place gets extra brownie points for their aesthetic presentation of dishes, more like contemporary global cuisine.. Coming to the FnB we zeroed on:
Activated Charcoal Martini: Sadly the activated charcoal was not available that day, but who cares when you get to sip on a magical concoction of Kahlua and Absolut, topped with espresso coffee.. Slightly bitter, may not be suitable for everyone's palate..
Beef Chili Fry: Lip smacking to say the least.. Spicy, sourly, and the beef was cooked to perfection.. Silky, smooth texture, not at all chewy or gummy, and devoid of any extra fat.. Served with hot Pao..
Korean Fried Chicken Bao: Chicken deep fried and wrapped inside bao made from fermented dough.. Korean version of burger with the hot sriracha sauce, lettuce and veggies..
Arabic Lamb Curry: Middle eastern curry dish served with Persian Pilaf and a sweetened chili date chutney.. The pilaf was subtle in flavor, nice aroma and the lamb curry was more like the Bengali mutton kosha.. Overall portion was suitable for twin sharing..
Passion Fruit Brulee: Simply outstanding.. So many components on the plate yet beautifully synchronized into a single dish.. Loved the presentation.. The charcoal sponge tasted heavenly with the tropical sorbet, the mango and lime coulis was also innovatively plated up.. Passionately Recommended..
Along with the above food we also took 2 Pint bottles of Carlsberg.. Overall, it's an unique experience to say the least.. The music, the vibes, the food everything leave you with complete satisfaction.. Although a bit pricey but given the amazing skills the chef displayed, we can afford the experience once in a while.. Our total cheque was Rs. 2630/- (all incl.) for 2 people as they charged 10% extra ST..

Had heard so much about this place that we decided to try it out on a Sunday evening! The door opened, there is a ground floor seating arena with the bar. The vividly descriptive stairs led to the upper floor which had a mix of  comfortable sofas and chairs. Dimly lit ambiance, which kept on fluctuating thanks to the voltage fluctuation. It was a meal timed between a heavy lunch and a late dinner hence could not try much.

Cocktail - Charcoal Martini

Desserts - These are the probably only thing you should come for!

Bodega Bomba

- Okay ish. Looked pretty.

Japanese Cheese Cake

- tasted okay. Too many elements added to the flavor.

Sunday Movie Night - The best dessert. Master chef standard dessert, left me extremely happy and wanting for more!

Visited them again - For their Asian Menu Launch.

I wonder, what took so long for Bodega to launch this. Each and every tried on that afternoon assures you of a place which knows its food, and you'll get authentic flavors. An owner who is well versed with her food is the secret to Bodega's success. 

Highly recommended - Beef Bulgogi, Jala Roti with Mutton Rendang curry, Pork baozee, Dimsums, Teriyaki Wings and so on.

The cocktails are all named after beautiful locales situated across Asia. Chiang Mai, Beijing, Langkawi - each depicting new flavors and weaving new taste stories.

Desserts _ Mango Sticky Rice, Buttermilk Pannacotta, Chocolate Lah.

Visited this place for lunch and as we were the only ones there we got a good seat. The place is very well decorated with quirky posters and antiques. The menu had a lot to choose from and we ordered the Shroom balls, the Pizza Rustica and Truffle Fettuccine. The Shroom balls and the pizza were good although we thought that the pasta was a little undercooked. The presentation of the dishes was nice and the portion size was also good. The staff were courteous and the service quick. All in all it's a lovely place to hang out with your friends and family.

In the brutal universe of Kolkata cuisine, where only a few things apart from oily biryani‚Äã, cheap Chinese food and overtly cheesy pizzas seem to cut it, this little nook called Bodega Cantina brings something quite fresh and charming. It's the perfect place to spend a quiet Romantic afternoon or evening relaxing over some delightful, albeit simple, continental/fusion food and a drink. It's not for people who are looking for a bustling joint with a million thrills up its sleeve...it's rather for the quiet enthusiast who's looking for a niche of sanity, accompanied by food which doesn't claim to be any more than it is.

The place looked balmy and bright on the Saturday afternoon when I had occasion to visit, and I immediately found it welcoming and relaxing - the kind of place which encourages stimulating conversation. Everything seemed in place and fashionably underplayed, nothing crying out for attention. The outside glass facade on the first floor (where you must sit to enjoy the place) let in ample light, creating a perfect ambience. The staff was warm and amiable.

Finally, about the food; they have quite an eclectic mixture on the menu. It was encouraging and confusing, but only in a positive way! The staff was happy to discuss and help out with what we might want to try. I had occasion to try some grilled chicken, and one of their signature pizzas, both of which were pretty commendable. It was tasty and satisfying, and consistent with the overall feeling that Bodega invokes - quiet satisfaction. That, in fact, seems to be the essence of the place when I look back. Only happy memories!

ABSOLUTELY in love with the place. I was there with a friend and although he hated the cocktail (the Great Gatsby),I loved it. The ambience was very relaxing. We ordered the beef chilli fry and black spiced grilled chicken. Couldn't point out any flaws with them. The beef was cooked to perfection and the jus with the chicken was heavenly.
For dessert we had the bodega bomba. It was almost too pretty to eat. Turns out it tasted even better. Want to try the other desserts really bad.
Can't wait to visit again! (Don't know why it's so underrated)

1. bad service. my husband was waiting for me, and had to wait for close to 40 minutes till the waiter approached the table. and that too after he was called. and it was empty.

2. nothing great about the food. they are very slow at taking orders and serving food. and the food wasnt satisfying. we ordered wild mushroom pizza and potato tornedo.

3. drinks have fancy names, yes. and are served in fancy themed glasses. that's just it. nothing substantial about the quantity. nor was the taste something to call home about. we ordered tiramisu martini, great gatsby, goblet of fire, and coca la copa.

not great for cocktails. nor for food, or service. was disappointed. not coming back, or recommending.

i would rather go to hoppipola for amazing cocktails.

Absolutely horrible service! Waiters are quite inattentive. First our food order took 40 min to arrive and the waiter's excuse was that the first batch got burnt so they had to make it again. Then our second round of drinks arrived after we finished our pizza! The place wasn't also super crowded, but still waiters are horrible at communicating and waiting. Food is average and drinks are okay, albeit being on the pricier side. Would not come here again for sure.

Food: we ordered cheese cigars, frittatas (nachos with potato chips instead of corn chips) and quesadillas. The cheese cigars were served piping hot (1 serving had 6 mini pieces) and was sumptuous. The frittatas topped with cream, were served with salsa and a cheese dip. We felt they were a good alternative to good ol' nachos. The quesadillas were a bit heavy and the pieces were cut sized a lil too big. Three of us gals were able to do justice to only half the plateful served.

Cocktails: We ordered the Garden of Zen (photo attached) it was a nice concoction of Thai fruits and vodka, very fresh and light. The presentation is something to look out for.

Ambience: The music was the latest on the charts and the service was very prompt and staff was friendly and courteous.

Would highly recommend this place for its cocktails.

A very fine decor and a fancy place to visit.  I did expect  a lot more from this place.  The ambience did kill the thrill. I was there at 5 30 pm and left by like 7 pm, and there were literally noone apart from me and my friends. The place is dead.  
Coming to the food and drinks.  Did try a salad and a glass of red wine.  I also tried a cocktail: "Coca La Copa" which I did find amazing but it is only for the people who are fond of old monk.

Fancy place to catch up with a friend, very cozily decorated with 2 separate sections for drinks and just dinner, but then coming to food, got very very few varieties to choose from in Veg Section, the names are just made very fancy to sound appealing, but then they are ultimately exactly the same, with nothing unique in their flavours. However, the desserts have a wide range of options to choose from.

Stands just beside allen park, in the heart of park street.
Talking about this place, well it has a wonderful decor to add to the mood. The concept and the minute things up here makes it a treat for the visiters.
Coming down to the food now.
It has a pretty mentionable number.
Chicken chips , Empanadas and Patatas bravas are ones i liked a lot.
The pocket pinch for this place is a little heavy.
So you are looking to spend a little and enjoy with a bunch of buddies this is the right place for you.

It's an okay place, with fancy decor and bad music(that depends though)The staff was very friendly¬†Ordered bacon wrapped prawns, Peking dumplings, mac&cheese, and Arabic lamb curry. The lamb curry and prawns were really good, rest of the food was in the bracket of bad-average. Didn't try the cocktails, maybe next time

Honestly I have been to Bodega earlier and it was decent but I have no idea what happened to it when I visited this place recently along with my foodie friends. The onion rings were so oily and limp and the channa 2.0 was average. The filo cigars were nice though a tad oily again. The mezze board was the saving grace of the appetizers round and it was decent.¬†

I had the Thai Curry and Rice for my mains and it was ok. I picked the Sunday Movie Night as my dessert and to be very honest I was disappointed with it as it was gimmicky rather than it being a satisfying dessert if that makes sense. Quite a disappointing meal overall.

I've been here twice or thrice, and I do like the place. However, it is slightly overrated. I appreciate the value they place on presentation, and I like the pork belly here over the one at Mamagoto, but in terms of taste and value for the paying customer, it falls a bit short. 
The standout dishes from my times here are: Mushroom Pizza, Cheese Fondue (it was pure foodgasm looking at it!), Bacon-wrapped prawn, and the pork belly. I'd recommend the tenderloin as well, but only if you like it either well-dome, or very rare. My medium rare came back nearly raw, and then overdone. The pork belly, on the other hand, was beautifully soft, and exceptionally tasty. 
About the cocktails, I'd strongly urge to try the Tiramisu cocktail (not pictured). It is a sweet, beautifully creamy cocktail, and has become a go-to order for the family! 
It does hurt your pocket a lot, though, and the mere appearance doesn't justify the prices. The desserts on the other hand, are absolutely value for money! They're innovative, tasty, and a sight behold! I'd recommend everything on the dessert menu except the Campfire. It's awkward to have, and isn't  anything very great, though it is the most impressive to look at. The ambiance is loud, stemming from the club downstairs. It isn't something I particularly enjoy, but their cocktails are definitely strong enough to make you forget all of the cons! :D The staff is also very friendly, and was very patient with my extremely confused family, even going out of their way to make a custom dish for my father (which was absolutely amazing and they should definitely put on the menu!)

For a Sunday evening, this place was really empty, it was just us.. downstairs is a dark place with music, and big screen.. upstairs review can't give, as didn't go upstairs.. hookah was well made. We ordered for food, waited for 30 mins, and got to know they forgot the order. Anyways, be careful while ordering food,, don't go with the food descriptions, as they would even write entire two lines about the sauce that wl accompany the dish. Really small portions, average dish price 350 (w/o) tax.. 

The other day we went upstairs.. it's lighted up better than downstairs, n good for a family going together. Decor is pretty impressive.. loved the way they served the soup.. again it was all empty for a Saturday evening.. this time we ordered a lot of food, bt again small portions for all. Risotto was amazing.. aglio olio have had better in lesser known places.

The unique mixology cocktails on the menu was always on my mind, which finally lead me to Bodega. Went there few days back with a friend. The quirky ambience upstairs was nice with the wall decor was commendable too compared to downstairs, which was kinda shabby.
¬†¬†¬† The best part was the cosmopolitan out of the box cocktail menu. Each of them were unique and well presented. We had 1. Amor Amargo 2. Thai High 3. Dusk to Dawn 4. Tiramisu Martini.
¬†¬† The food was okay type. We had Pickled Chili Prawns Dumplings which was good and we also had Soft Shell Tacos Chicken Tinga and Fondutta Chicken .
¬†¬† The staff's were courteous, smoking room was too small. Overall it was a good experience and I'm only going back to try their other cocktails on the menu :)

I finally managed to visit this place after hearing a lot about the food here. This place has two sections with a bar downstairs and the dining area on top. They have a tiny smoking cabin which smartly fits below the stairs, so good use of free space right there! 

They have a good collection of their signature cocktails. We tried their 15 Bloomsbury cocktail which was a unique drink presented beautifully. For starters, we tried their Crispy Pork Belly Salad which was so tasty with the bits of fried moong beans & pomegranate. We also had their Vietnamese Basa Fritters with fried capers and mayo. 

For mains, we called for their Pepper Beef Steak which was supposed to be medium rare and we did get medium rare on the plate which a lot of restaurants fail to deliver. The amount of jus however, was a bit too much on the plate. The confit potatoes were delicious. 

The dessert we had was their Sunday Movie Night. We loved the concept and the plating of the dessert. It was a sweet end to a good meal.

Appetiser were really nice specially the shrimp . The portion of Arabic lamb was perfect but Sichuan pot's portion was more. Now if I have to rate the food then
Baja fish taco 4/5
Shirmp n bacon 4.5/5
Arabic lamb 4.5/5
Sichuan pot 4.5/5
Overall it was a good experience. I loved the dress that staffs were wearing. So cool.

Bodega Cantina Y Bar has a chilled out vibe with good service. 
They have great cocktails but trashy food. The dishes seem great on the menu but tastes pretty ordinary with many ingredients missing.

Must have:¬†
‚Ä¢	Grilled artichoke ‚Äì Fantastic! 4 pieces of grilled artichoke drizzled with pesto sauce.¬†

‚Ä¢	Tiramisu Martini ‚Äì Yum! A fine dessert cocktail.

‚Ä¢	Crocomiester ‚Äì The cutest cocktail ever ‚ò∫ Delicious too!

‚Ä¢	Garden of Zen ‚Äì Fancy looking, great tasting cocktail served with wasabi nuts.¬†

Do not have:¬†
‚Ä¢	Eddie‚Äôs love potion- Looks fancy, tastes weird. I don‚Äôt even know how to explain.

‚Ä¢	Overloaded Nachos ‚Äì Just a pile of cheap nacho gunk. Pretty tasteless.

Can have:
Sichuan Pot ‚Äì Ordinary schezwan pot rice.
Filo Cigars - anything tastes good when stuffed with cheese. The dish wasn't bursting with flavour in any manner. The dip was better than the cigars. (Avoidable dish) 

Disaster:¬†
Textures of Chocolate: Ridiculous! It was old hard muffin with small pieces of brownie drizzled with chocolate sauce and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
 And, the description was 74% chocolate tart (missing), fondant (missing), cocoa cremeux (missing), chocolate chip ice cream (missing), cocoa nibs tuilee (smelled of oil), cookie crumble (missing).¬†When I complained they said, ‚ÄúMadam, the chocolate chip ice cream was over so we served plain vanilla!‚Äù Who the F are they kidding!? ¬†And this happened after we returned the cocktail Pink lips, as they had served it without cotton candy as mentioned in the menu. And they didn‚Äôt bother to let us know until I stubbornly returned the drink.¬†The good gesture, I wasn‚Äôt charged for either.¬†
Finally, I am not returning to the restaurant for anything but the cocktails and grilled artichokes. With the cocktails, the pocket pinch is about Rs. 1200 per person.

Extremely well decorated,Service is swift and pleasing,food is good (can be better)
I visited today with a friend in the evening,there was a little light outside which slowly faded away.The place looked amazing when there was light outside,you could see small things kept haphazardly together to make such a beautiful decor but as the lights faded,it lost the beauty a little. 
The service was swift and they were really nice to us. No complaints there. 
We ordered "Goblet of fire" which was a little bitter and not what I expected it to be but the presentation was cool. Followed by Prawns-exquisitely cooked,Asian noodle bowl (chicken thighs) a little spicy and you could feel the textures...it was great.Our lemon ice tea and cold cappuccino was the best part of the meal...everything in proportion in the drinks.That's one of the best iced tea I had in town. 
I would visit this again just for the beauty of the place ...2.5hours well spent.

With the ever evolving food scenario of Kolkata comes along Bodega Cantena, just about an year old. but to me it's the Renaissance-Man of Kolkata's good culture. It's Cosmopolitan food menu and out of the box mixology, thanks to award winning mixologist Uttam Singh, makes Bodega the place to go. I have tried 12 of their 27 well-appointed cocktails on the Menu and each of them are unique, special and delicious. The food menu is diverse and very tasteful. So is the garnishing. The food menu also comes with suggestions regarding cocktails for the a-maze-d customer, who may loose their way through the cocktail menu, which borrows a leaf from our Organic Chemistry books. It's tough to rate the food and drinks, but out of the ones I have tried I will undertake the herculean task. I will rank the snacks and small bites as - 1. Churezo bake, 2. Bass fritters and 3. Lamb üåÆ Taco. The cocktails can be ranked as 1. Golden Beet (for being most out of the box), 2. Spring time & Thai high, 3. Activated charcoal martini & Atlantis fizz. There are others which are beautifully served like Missionary Doctor and Dawn to Dusk but my ranking is only on the basis of perfect mixology and not how they are served.

The ambience is the only thing worth remembering and commenting on. They have really done up the place well with quirky elements here and there. But the food was a let down. The food presentation was good but the flavors failed to impress. For starters we ordered the Pickled Chilli Prawns and Dirty Green Chicken. Now something to be remembered here is that the names are quite misleading. For example, the prawns were not spicy rather grilled and a tad undercooked. The Dirty green chicken was neither dirty nor green, it was chicken in puff pastry. So I would suggest you ask your server to explain the dishes to you before ordering. 
Now, I had gone primarily to try the zucchini noodles, which to my disappointment they have discontinued. So we ordered the Black Grilled Chicken and the Sichuan Pot. Frankly we paid 365/- + taxes only for fried rice. It had no crunchy vegetables or scallions as the menu promises. Plus 50/- if you want Chicken. This by far was the biggest let down I have faced in any restaurant. On second thought, I should have sent it back. The Grilled chicken was good in terms of flavor and the chicken perfectly good and the mashed potato very creamy and the sauce perfect. This is the only dish I would recommend. 
Lastly the thing that ripped my soul was the tiramisu. Now I'm a tiramisu connoisseur, that being my favorite dessert. But the rendition of tiramisu that I had at Bodega today was a big disappointment. To start with, the expresso coffee was too strong and overpowered the whole dish. Might I suggest, good old expresso powder instead. The deconstructed version somehow failed to impress. 
Well, I hope to go back to Bodega just to try the other things they have on the menu because maybe today was a bad day ! :(

The ambiance of this place is great. The staff is courteous. The ground floor hosts weekly live music sessions(unplugged). Being a sucker for good music, it instantly impressed me. I went with my girlfriend, and we used a dineout offer which let us order loads of food at a discounted price. We ordered:Starters:

1. Chicken and Cheese Croquetas: Good in taste, but the size doesn't begin to justify the price.

2. Pickled Chili Prawns: Frankly, I've had better tasting prawns even at shabby places. The quantity is outrageously less for the price they charge.

Main Course:

1. BBQ Chicken Pizza: Though I do not like thin crust pizzas, this was one of the best I've had in a long time. The disappointment created by the appetizers was almost made up for by this delicious, filling pizza.

2. Asian Noodle Box: Perhaps my taste buds aren't developed enough to handle such dishes. To put it plainly, it sucked. The quantity was good, but there was no taste.

Desserts:

1. Bodega Bomb: As you can see from the pictures, it looks amazing. However, it doesn't taste half as good. I found it to be a weird mixture of cough syrup and ice cream.

2. Sunday Movie Night: The presentation was perfect. But again. the taste was tarnished by the excessive saltiness which destroyed the caramel ice-cream's flavour.

Had checked in for a beer. The environment is okay. The place was full-on IPL mood, screening live matches.                                                          
The restaurant was quiet clumsy. They didn't had any important beer. So had to settle with magpie. Menu was a bit weird. So I stood my servers recommendation and ordered chicken chips.
The quantity was good but it was full of salt.
Still, looking forward to visit again with an expectation to see some important beer available in the bar.

After hearing a lot of positives about Bodega, decided to drop in on a Saturday evening with a friend. The joint is located at the junction of Park St and Camac Street across Allen Park.

I had reserved a table calling well in advance and I specifically mentioned that I need a table which is close to the TV as there was an IPL match that evening which I wanted to watch.¬†

Upon entering I was directed to the 1st floor which has proper seating but no screens to enjoy the match while dining. Upon inquiring the waitress said that all tables on the ground floor are reserved. This was disappointing as I had specifically asked for a table to be reserved where I can enjoy the cricket match. However after few minutes they shifted us to the ground floor right in front of the huge projector screen :)¬†

They have a special IPL offer going on during the match timings. 799 for unlimited draught beer and 999 for unlimited IMFLs. This seemed like a great deal and went for it. Again the staff was a bit confused about whether 799 included taxes or not and after discussing with their internal team they confirmed that it was inclusive of taxes. Before even starting our drinks and meal we understood that there is lack of co ordination and staff is not accurately informed of the offers. This was quite surprising but the service afterwards was excellent. The staff is generally polite and on their toes.¬†

Along with the drinks we tried the Veg Nachos. We wanted to add a topping of chicken to it but unfortunately that is not an option. The Nachos were quite filling and tasty as it was loaded with cheese and baked beans. The food pricing is slightly more than expected but quantity makes up for it.¬†

The selection of music is great and loud. People who do not like loud music should be seated on the 1st floor as that is not the lounge area. The ground floor is where the bar along with high seating arrangement. Generally people start dancing around the tables after a few drinks :)¬†

Over all I liked the place and I will be back to try their cocktails.

On mother's day, my sister and I took our mom out for casual dining at Bodega. The dining area is spacious with dim lights and modern interiors. The menu has an interesting range of cuisines and the service was delightful. I ordered for a red Sangria while my sister chose to get a latte, mom tried the gunpowder green tea. The sangria was okay and could have been better but the coffee and tea was nice. For starters, we had the Vietnamese basa fritters and pickled chilli prawns, both were delicious and the presentation was gorgeous. For mains we ordered for the chicken steak in black bean sauce and they recommended a pan seared bhekti with spaghetti. The food is really nice and I quite enjoyed it. Because it was mother's day they served us a complementary dessert as well, it wasa combination of red velvet and white chocolate so it can't go wrong, I loved it.

The selection of music is great and loud. People who do not like loud music should be seated on the 1st floor as that is not the lounge area. The ground floor is where the bar along with high seating arrangement. Generally people start dancing around the tables after a few drinks :)¬†

Over all I liked the place and I will be back to try their cocktails.

On mother's day, my sister and I took our mom out for casual dining at Bodega. The dining area is spacious with dim lights and modern interiors. The menu has an interesting range of cuisines and the service was delightful. I ordered for a red Sangria while my sister chose to get a latte, mom tried the gunpowder green tea. The sangria was okay and could have been better but the coffee and tea was nice. For starters, we had the Vietnamese basa fritters and pickled chilli prawns, both were delicious and the presentation was gorgeous. For mains we ordered for the chicken steak in black bean sauce and they recommended a pan seared bhekti with spaghetti. The food is really nice and I quite enjoyed it. Because it was mother's day they served us a complementary dessert as well, it wasa combination of red velvet and white chocolate so it can't go wrong, I loved it.

Heard a lot about this place and was swayed by the rave reviews. But I must say I was really disappointed with the food. Ordered bacon wrapped prawns which were overdone and dry. The slow braised pork belly looked beautiful on the plate but all I could taste is the overpowering sweetness of most of the elements of the dish. Also tried Katsu chicken with high expectations but I would recommend against it. All you can taste is just wasabi (extremely overwhelming) over rice with barely there crumb fried chicken. The description of the bodega bomba was really exciting. Presentation was enough to make us salivate. But when we actually tried it, it was as disappointing as the other items we had ordered. Overly sweet and all you can taste is just raspberry. And caviar? Please don't call raspberry jelly beads that! Needs a desperate balance of flavors and a major cut down on the raspberry quotient. The rating is just for plating.

Lovely decor with wonderful ways of serving the food and drinks! That's the most simple way to describe Bodega Cantena Y Bar. Courteous staff members are helpful in suggesting the right ones for your tastebuds. Their way of serving the cocktails is the most innovative part of the restaurant. Would love to visit again!

Visited this place after checking the high ratings on zomato. 
Easy to locate. Right beside barbecue nation in park street.
The decor is different but nothing to be totally wooed. 
As for drinks, we ordered green LIIT (very refreshing during the scorching heat), shades of grey, and the great gatsby.
Started off with bacon wrapped prawns and chicken tacos. Then ordered slow braised pork belly and spicy keema pizza. 
Had their famous bodega bomba and sunday movie night as dessert.
The staff was very courteous. 
Honestly speaking, the price to portion ratio was way too high. This would not have been a concern if the food was mind blowing.

We ideally went to this place to enjoy the ipl match over some good food and honestly, we weren't disappointed.fun quirky food and drinks presentation was nice....the only drawback Is that there are very few tables and extremely loud music near the screen so while we actually went to watch the match over the meal we din end up doing so as there was very limited place.

Didn't even know about this place a week back. Located at the corner near what's in Da name, the bar downstairs is just plain small and inadequate. But when you step upstairs, the decor kinda strikes you with a familiar but still different look and feel. Nice sofas and low tables with beautifully arranged racks. Pretty cool.

There was this IPL offer of unlimited draught and whisky at 799 and 999 respectively.

For food, we ordered bacon wrapped prawns, beef chilly fry, bodega Caesar salad and some other dish of chicken. We ordered the prawns thrice, they were that good. The beef was very hot though.

Very good service and courteous staff. And not many people know about this place I guess, so it wasn't crowded or anything. People only come pouring in after 9.

Highly recommended.

Visited this place many times.. first few visits were around 6-7 months back . I loved the decor. Has a good diverse progressive menu. Cocktails are very signature and off beat with twists of improvisation. Food quality was yardstick.  But my last visit, a few days ago was quite different. At night it was like a local pub, contrary to its sophisticated ambiance in the day time, with extremely loud music and dim lighting like a pub.  It looked transmuted .

Great decor and ambience; value for money food. But not so customer focused service. And I'll explain why. We were walk-ins at around 1220. Was shown to a lovely table for 2 by the window and here's what we ordered - Coco Loco (since the Vietnamese Coffee was unavailable) and Morning After; Laal Maas Taco, Beef Chilly Fry and Pathani Chicken Tikka.

The food and drinks were served quickly and I'd readily recommend the Morning After as well as the Beef Chilly Fry. The spicy kick of the Laal Maas was not to my liking and the Chicken Tikka was well - as all Tikkas are! So, we are done with our food; thinking about dessert and it is just 1300. After a set of frantic hand waving the staff hand over the menu and clear out part of the food serving. And we place the order for Bodega Bomba and The Hazelnut. Time goes by and finally being completely confused about where our order was (a table next to ours went through soup and main course and had already paid the bill while we wait) I ask a staff member only to be informed about it taking a little more time. Both desserts were well plated and presented, I'd recommend the Bomba over the Hazelnut (there's far too much Hazelnut in it - not a downside, just not what I was expecting).

So, the food is actually good value for money in a set up which was been created with a great deal of attention to detail. But, if an order of 2 mocktails; 3 small plates and 2 desserts require over 70 minutes to be served - with the patrons being uninformed about any delay (we were on a schedule and would have skipped dessert if we actually knew it would take more than half an hour to be prepared) then it is an iffy experience at best. Sure, one can argue that this provides adequate time for customers to be social and chatty. But that's one way of looking at it. Right until the time all the small tables on the first floor were occupied, there was just one staff member attempting to take orders; place them into the system and all such. The usual observation around water refills continue - does not happen until you keep waving your hand for the staff to take notice.

My friend got a voucher from Zomato of a certain amount and hence we dropped in! 
The entire restaurant is very quirky starting from the entrance itself, which looks like the entrance of an old warehouse. It has two floors. The grand floor is the bar area while the first floor is the dining place. Its very well decorated and attention has been given to details. Even the washroom has been given attention to! 
Coming to the food, we had ordered BBQ chicken pizza and Nasi Goreng for main and Bodega Bomba for dessert. The pizza was delicious as well as Nasi Goreng. I loved the sambal they served with it! The dessert was a piece of art and tasted pretty good, but I thought it was a bit too sweet. Would have loved if they had some contrast. 
All-in-all a very nice place with good food but a bit on the pricey side!

Outstanding Cocktails, friendly staff and sumptuous food. A very chill, easy and young vibe with world class drinks and food. The upstairs section is great o catch up with friends in the evenings too. All of the cocktails were presented in a fun and interesting way, special mention for the yummy tiramisu martini for people who like deliciously gourmand cocktails. The nachos were so authentic and fresh and the chicken sui Mai is one of the best I've ever eaten. I'd go here again and again and never get tired of the place. Cheers to Bodega!

A hidden gem in the heart of the city. It's located in a bylane of Park Street. The ambience is amazing, so is the courtesy and hospitality of the servers. Ordered a slow braised pork belly, a grande and a sides of garlic bread. All of them were yummy to the point that I could lick off my fingers. They beer was freshly brewed. And tasted really nice. Kudos to the team.

Aesthetically, this is the best place I've been so far in Calcutta. The decor absolutely blows your mind. I have tried both food and beverage. When I went they had a Talli Menu which is quite a steal if you wish to drink cheap. I had THE DAWA DARU, MOVES LIKE JAGGER and BEER BATLI. All of them were really good. The quantity of food is really less, given the price, though taste is great. Steep tax. Had SHROOM BALLS and EMPANADAS.

The ambience is good but beware of leaking overhead air-conditioning  duct pipes......  In the middle of your meal and conversation there will a cold drop of water falling on your head and running down ur back.....  Yuck.  
And the topper was the mirror that fell....  A full ht mirror  that just came off the tenterhooks  it was on.... To fall right on my head in the bar area.....  Which  my friends saw falling on me and held off before it touched my head.....  Oh it was really scary!

Got a complimentary meal voucher of a certain amount from zomato for dining in ,in this restaurant so visited this place today. 
The entrance was a bit shabby but as soon as you enter the restaurant things change.. the restaurant is very spacious and have a quirky ambience with posters and various antique decoratives on the wall. It has two floors. The groumd floor is a bar and the upper floor is for dine in.. we settled ouselves on the first floor.
The menu is extensive for both drinks and food and I am pretty sure all the vegetarian foodies out there won't be disappointed if they visit this place because they have plenty of veg dishes as mentioned on their menu card.
Now coming to our orders, we decided to skip the appetizers and went straight for the main course. We ordered a BBQ Chicken Pizza and Nasi Goreng as our main course. We also wanted to order for drinks from the talli menu as we have seen in the menu section of this restaurant on Zomato but was disappointed when we were informed that they have stopped serving those because of the introduction of a new menu.
Coming to the food, the BBQ Chicken Pizza is a thin crust pizza and it tasted yum.. It had ample amount of barbecued chicken and cheese . I really liked the taste.. one pizza is good enough for two people of they have medium appetite.
The Nasi Goreng is basically an Indonesian fried rice but a little bit spicier than usual fried rice. In Bodega ,the long grained fried rice was cooked with shrimp and veggies and served with a sunny side up on top of the rice, prawn wafers,roasted peanuts,sambal and two chicken skewers. This dish was also delicious. My friend loved the sambal though it was sweet for my palate. The skewered chicken tasted like boneless tandoori Chicken.. overall this large plate was very good if not excellent. After this we ordered for the dessert named Bodega Bomba. It was visually a master piece. It was so satisfying to look at it. Though my first choice was to order the hazelnut but opted for this one on insistence of my friend. Tastewise it was good. White chocolate dome filled with red velvet and white chocolate topped with fresh cream along with caviar and strawberry parfait . I would say for a person like me who is not much into fruits they should avoid this dessert and opt for something more chocolaty. Though it wasn't bad, I would say for me it was more enticing visually.
Last but not the least, their service was promt. The person incharge was quite efficient and well behaved.
The prices are on the higher side but since we had a voucher , didn't mind the prices.
Did not order anything from the bar menu so cannot comment on that.
Hopefully I'll visit again to try things out from their drinks menu as well all other things from their food menu too.üôÇ

This one has been on my to go to list for a long time now... N what better occasion than a schoolies reunion lunch. To put it simply it was just love at first sight - I could just go on n on bout it's artsy decor. I would describe it as the best fusion of quirky n retro. 
The next interesting thing was their drinks - they literally brought out all the chemistry lab memories on the table. Talking about the food I liked their dumplings, Asian noodle bowl, mejico Fritas, shroom balls. Though my friends found the chicken shawarma completely unpalatable - should be looked into. One should ask for their corporate set menu - quite economical. Overall a hearty experience!!!

The music, I have heard is generally good. But it was disappointing the one time is visited.

Edit 1: Food is distinctively awesome. YOU CAN'T STOP YOURSELF FROM ORDERING THEM ALL. (I improved the rating too).

Had heard about this place since a long time. We had the great gatsby drink which was alcohol based and had pineapple and rose petals in it. It was served in a very unique manner , in a metallic glass resembling a pineapple. 
We then had the mezze platter which consisted of hummus, spanakopita, pita bread, falafel, baba ganoush and a curd based dip. The pita bread was made well , the falafel was crunchy and flavourful and the spanakopita was flaky and dry. Baba ganoush was a very nice dip , it had really well minced aubergines with spices. The hummus was excellent. It was creamy and had the correct consistency. The curd based dip was good too. 
We had the wild mushroom pizza which consisted of mushrooms, oyster mushrooms and roquet leaves with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar, the  cheese being extremely stretchy. But the taste somehow didn't come together. I felt that the tomato sauce was less in concentration and didn't add up to the taste of the pizza. And this is the reason I couldn't give this place more than a 4. 
We also had the mac and cheese which was cheesy with the flavour of dill and was cooked in truffle oil. It was less in quantity but tasted well. 
Lastly , we had a dessert called the Hazelnut. It consisted of hazelnut mousse atop caramel and a nutty and crunchy biscuit enclosed in a chocolate egg shell , with two sheets of tempered chocolate attached to it and dusted with gold dust. The rest of the plate had a quenelle of vanilla ice cream and a spread of hazelnut and chocolate spread with nuts and cookies on it. It tasted divine. It is an eggless dessert and highly recommended by me. The chocolate was rich, the mousse was smooth , the ice cream was full of flavour as it was hand churned and was filling too. 
Bodega has a really nice ambience. Downstairs is the bar area while upstairs is for dining. They have long windows from where ample sunlight can enter. They have quirky wall decor and the staff is amiable and helpful. Some people say the prices are a bit on the higher side but I found it pretty reasonable.

Ok so it was a spur of the moment decision to go and dine out here. We ordered the filo pastry cigars with cheese and veggie filling and a mezze platter as  starters. They were both average as platters  except the hummus dip which was really good. Then we had a lamb tagine with pilaf and a date chutney. The lamb tasted good , very rich in flavours indeed. The date chutney was amazing but the pilaf was so mediocre  that it was killing the dish. Moreover the quantity of lamb served was poor. Next I had a Nasigoreng  that was unbelievably bad, I mean genuinely bad. The fried rice was bad, instead of a sambal they served a chili and honey dip and the pdawn wafers were simply store bought crap.  The chicken skewers were still alright. Overall either I ended up ordering all the weak dishes of the restaurant or it is not where I will want to visit again. But the dessert of Sunday Movie Night that consisted of home-spun cotton candy, caramel popcorn,  chocolate mousse and a lovely peanut butter sorbet was mindblowing.

The people were continuously looking after our needs and making sure if we were comfortable or not! Tried their special drink and chaat box and i must admit that the drinks were  indeed awesome and there was nothing so special about the chaat box though! The decor is really catchy and needs a special mention! Wish to visit this place soon! üòá

Amidst the ones rich in heritage, Bodega Cantina makes a bold statement with the chic interior design!
And, my God the washroom!
These people have put in real deal of thinking and have built communication with the customers in such a cool way!
I forgot to take my phone with me to the washroom! Else I would have clicked quite a few pictures. Don't repeat this same mistake please!
I'm gonna visit again for sure.

We were there as part of Dineout's GIRF. Great vibe on a Friday night. We were slightly early so it was the right balance of calm and buzzing. Unfortunately for any nice looking restaurant, my agenda is always food and value. After taking my time with the eclectic menu, I settled for soft shell tacos and tofu burrito bowl. The waiter at the time of ordering told me there would be 3 tacos (I had asked). When it arrived, there were 2 miniscule ones. No matter how well made, that cannot satisfy. The chilli beef starter was also a tiny portion. The burrito bowl fared slightly better, lacking again in portion size but the beans and tofu made it fairly hearty.¬†

A lot of deliberation and we chose Bodega Bomba and Rocky Road for desserts (top choice Sunday Movie Night unavailable). Both interesting looking despite a touch of amateurishness. The Bomba, to those familiar with Masterchef, was all about technique :) I quite liked the concept and how everything came together. Rocky Road on the other hand, was missing a sweet element. Unsure if that was the intention, but it does not work as a dish. Each of the 5-6 components was either bland or bitter. As hard as I'm trying to move past the portions, I can't :)

Bodega is one of the better places to hang out in the Park Street Area. They have a well designed ambience, a lively atmosphere and good service. They have designed their cocktails really well and the presentation is really unique. Their Mezze Platter is also quite authentic.

Had visited bodega a month back.located on a very prime area of Park Street.starting with the ambience,the place is a bit dark,however,after seeing the menu the first thing I developed is a smile seeing the different names of items.had tried the chilli beef which comes with Pav,which tasted exquisite,hats off to the management for keeping such good quality beef.ordered the Moroccan lamb which was also very good but not as good as the chilli beef.for desserts being a ferero rocher chocolate lover,ordered the rocher,which was equally very tasty.for some,prices might seem on the higher side but looking at the fantastic quality of all items it's definitely worth it.will surely come back for the chilli beef.keep it up!

The amazing pictures circulating in Instagram, raving about the desserts served at this place was reason enough for a dessert lover like myself to drop by. But the price tag, being on the higher side, I was a little apprehensive. And then Dineout came with this amazing offer of a 3 Course Set Meal at a reasonable price of Rs 599 per head and I wasted no further time!

Locating this is a little difficult task, but turn right from Barbeque Nation and there's a tiny sign board indicating the entrance to Bodega Cantina Y Bar. The name is quite peculiar, and looking it up, I found that Bodega means a shop selling wine in Spanish. The ambiance of the place stays true to its name, and the first thing that caught my eye was the welcome board. It's beserk, unconventional and unabashedly true. The decor is amazing, on both the floors and you can understand that a lot of time has been invested in setting it up- be it the funky lamps hanging from ropes or the small wooden detailing to the furniture, or even the telephone stacked away in a rack. The lighting is pretty dim after evening, and as I mentioned, it stays true to its name. We visited the place on a Friday, and there was live music from 8 on the ground floor - all in all, a very happening and cozy place.

Now comes the reason of my visit - food. Unfortunately, all the praises regarding the ambiance and decor cannot be repeated for the food served. They claim to be bringing a wide variety of local and global cuisines on the table which includes Korean, Turkish, Mexican etc cuisines, but I was disappointed to find only a handful of regular items that you can find in other Continental and Italian hubs as well. We decided to settle for the following:

Appetizers:
1. Chicken and Cheese Croquetas: Tasted good with the mayo. Crispy outside and the filling was done well. 6 tiny pieces don't do justice to the price, though.

2. Pickled Chili Prawns: I found this pretty tasteless to be honest. The onion and carrot salad accompanying it tries to better the taste, but not too successfully. Again, the portion served is quite small.

Main Course:
1. BBQ Chicken Pizza: Thin crust pizza, with loads of cheese and generous pieces of chicken. Definitely one of the better pizza houses.

2. Asian Noodle Box: Flat noodles with chicken. Big time disappointment, this one. They initially said the chicken would be spicy and I advised them to make it medium spicy. They probably misinterpreted it as making the dish totally bland and tasteless. The portion is good enough, though.

Desserts:
Here comes the most important part of the meal - the reason I visited the restaurant in the first place. They have an extensive list of items, and I would have loved to order a few more on the menu, but I only had provision for two! So I decided to go for the popular ones:
1. Bodega Bomb: Pretty in pink! Garnished with raspberry gel, this one is full of different elements - chocolate dome, strawberry foam, red velvet, champagne sorbet and what not! It's a delight to the eyes, but tastewise, it doesn't match the hype it has created.

2. Sunday Movie Night: Full points to the Chef for coming up with such an innovative presentation. The file-like reel of chocolate mousse served with candy floss and caramel popcorn is so cute that it will make your heart wrench to eat it. However, again, appearances are deceptive. Though the sea salt caramel ice cream tasted great, the salted peanut foam overpowered the sweetness of the mousse to make it almost salty! 

Reviewing a bar should also include some comments on the drinks, but since am not an alcohol person really, I can only say that the menu looks promising, especially the cocktails!

Overall, it's a great place for spending an evening with music and booze. However, if you're going with high expectations for the food, you might be a little disappointed. And especially the pocket punch hurts.

Had visited with a friend to try their Talli Menu on an invitation. They have some of the best cocktails in the town, Sheela ki Jawani and moves like Jager being my favorite. ¬†Also do try their Non-Veg Chakna Box. The presentation matches up with the taste and is absolutely top notch. The place is well decorated with a lot of junk and looks fantastic and vibrant in colors. The top floor gets a lot of natural lighting during the day and makes the dining experience quite pleasant. While there also try their Laal Maas Taco and Ravioli Caprese. Bodega Bomba and Rocky Roads are my favorite from their dessert menu. Definitely worth a visit!.

Yesterday , I had an awesome lunch with my family here. We ordered pickled chili prawns , buffalo chicken wings,shroom balls , sticky pork belly and chicken croquettes for ¬†starters. Everything was excellent . The pork belly was a tad too sweet for our liking but given the quality of the pancake and the pork meat that can be easily forgiven . The mocktail we loved was "wrapped in emerald" .For mains we had truffle fettuccine (with added chicken) and lamb tagine . The fettuccine had good portions but we were not very impressed with the lamb though . The ¬†portion of lamb was small and the taste was ok . For deserts we had Sunday movie night and that was excellent . Our server was polite although the service could have been faster.Thank you bodega for this excellent meal !

Ambiance is terrific. ¬†State-of-the-art and beyond; I felt like I had walked into a Manhattan restaurant/bar. ¬†Waitstaff were prompt and on point with service. ¬†The empanadas were good and so was the Mango/Coconut fresca. ¬†The quesadillas were not. ¬†I've experienced this in Kolkata when it comes to Mexican food; no one gets it right. ¬†A tortilla (a quesadilla is two tortillas with cheese in the middle or one big tortilla, folded in half with cheese in the middle - it may also have chicken and other things along with the cheese, topped with salsa/pico de gallo/guacamole and sour cream on the side) is basically a corn-flour roti - it's thinner and lighter than makki ki roti or cornflour paratha. ¬†The tortilla itself shouldn't have any oil in it; that makes it hard for the cheese to stick. ¬†The consistency and taste of today's quesadilla was more like a makki ki roti with cheese and beans in the middle. ¬†Which brings me to the beans (for both the quesadillas and the empanadas). There's a quintessential Mexican flavor lacking and it's been replaced with the typical spicy Mumbai-masala taste you'd expect in a vada pav. ¬†Typically in Mexican food the beans are not spiced much, if at all; the pico de gallo/salsa adds the sour and spiciness. ¬†There isn't a great variety of spices in Mexican food but they do use cayenne pepper, Poblano peppers and jalapenos a lot. ¬†Lastly, the homemade sour cream was great; it would have been greater (easier to put on the food and taste/consistency) still had it been refrigerated overnight. ¬†I really loved the place and the food offerings; I'll try the Indian cantina fare the next time I"m there. ¬† Great design.

What a lovely place to have a meal! Apart from the superb decor and excellent service of course, great food and ambience. Among starters, the fish kataifi and grilled artichoke are a must have. For the main course, the Parsi tiffin box and seafood pizza are lovely. And do save space in your tummy for dessert, or just the Bodega Bomba, if nothing else. Optimum portion size is also something I should mention. It's one of the best desserts I've had yet, really. All in all - a great experience. I couldn't have chosen a better place to celebrate my birthday!

Went there on Christmas eve while they were offering a special menu . it has one of the most beautiful d√©cor you can find in this city with lots of vintage gadgets .the people were warm and courteous. Coming to food and drinks , we had  ordered a chicken and baked fish mains. And two cocktails . one of them was "Sheela ki Jawani" ( No prize for guessing why I have managed to remember only one name) the fish item was OK . but the chicken dish had stolen the show . it was not that soft but not at all chewy and perfectly juicy and the sauce was the pure justice . the blend of herbs and wine was fantastic . I would really love to visit them again . 

P.S. I would love to recall the names of the delicacies if any kind soul is up there for volunteering

The best thing about this place is its ambiance. I went with my friends and we ordered just some drinks and starters. The talli menu is actually as innovative and exciting as it sounds, at a very reasonable price too.
The chakhna¬†box reminds you of your college time booze parties.¬†

We also tried buffalo wings, beef chili fry and sticky pork belly. The pork was a bit different from what we expected. It was sweet but still savory, but the beef was very nice and spicy.

The signature drinks in this menu are different from we got there (might not be updated), but were definitely nice in all aspects (taste, aroma and presentation).

We spotted this place in Park street near park centre and dropped in here today.
It is a two storeyed beautiful pub with really nice interiors and cool music.
We had Nasi Goreng and Dawa daaru.
Nasi goreng is a very tasty dish with rice and shrimp,prawn wafers,yummy chicken skewers,poched egg,nuts and sambal.
The Dawa daaru cocktail is also very nice.
Presentation is neat and eye catchy.
We loved the food and looking forward to visit here again. üòä

On our third visit to our very favourite place we had a nonna's chicken wings,bee hive cocktail and a sunday movie night for dessert.
The chicken wings are highly recommend and tasted heavenly.
The Bee Hive mocktail both presentation wise and taste wise just won our hearts.It is also highly recommended.
And coming to the Sunday Movie Night Dessert,it tasted average.The mousse in it tasted it great.Presentation is really cute. üòç

LOCATION & AMBIANCE-
It is not very often I rate places this good! Bodega Cantina Y Bar was on my wish list for sometime and i finally paid a visit on a friend's birthday here. 
The place is located inside Magma House on Park Street and location wise scores well!
The place is divided between two levels and we sat on the first floor level. The staff was courteous can friendly throughout! 
The interiors have been done really well and this kind of place reminds of me of Mumbai pubs and bars!

FOOD-
‚Ä¢ Since I was not up for drinks I went for the cafe mocha which came in a big mug and was soothing to my extremely sore throat. 
My friends went for Sangria and wheat based beer. 
‚Ä¢ We tried the noodle bowl which was a bowl of flat noodles tossed in a beautiful garlic sauce with veggies! #recommended
‚Ä¢ Mejico fritas were delicious crisps accompanied by sour cream and beans and pico #recommended
‚Ä¢ chilli cheese fritters looked good but tasted pretty bland and did not have any spice in it
‚Ä¢ Shroom balls were delicious! Minced mushroom balls coated and fried with cheese! #recommended
‚Ä¢ Quesadillas were tasty and filling
‚Ä¢ Mezze Platter was delicious and loved all the fix ins!
‚Ä¢ Penne pasta in Alfredo sauce with cheese was delicious! #recommended
‚Ä¢Pizza had peppers, and was delicious and extremely satisfying! #recommended
‚Ä¢ Rocher cake was beautiful and complex but so good to taste!
Bomba and movie were also ordered which was like a dream on a plate though I missed trying it since i had to leave about that time! 

The prices are on the higher side and portions relatively less. Abut the experience and food make up for it so that you leave Bodega with a smile.

Simply superb ambience and decorations and a perfect place to hangout with friends on a weekend..
However the behaviour of some of the service staff was annoying and rude. When asked about the drink which We had pre planned to have, we were outrightly denied by one staff saying that the drink is discontinued. While another person when asked again provided us with the drink and the talli menu.
And then the person serving us the first drink rudely put the glass on the table and was a mood spoiler. Donno if these are also part of the theme!
The drink Sheila ki Jawani with Non Veg Chakna box was awesome and the presentation was marvellous. Thoroughly enjoyed it. 
Chicken chips was another dish which was really tantalising!
Would definitely go back to the place for trying the other dishes and of course the deserts which I heard of a lot.

Bodega is a bar canteen which is one of its first kind in Kolkata, just opposite to Allen Park in Park Street. The interior is very nicely decorated with catchy quotes which are hilarious. It is decorated with scotch and beer bottles, tiles, books, film posters and pictures giving it a classy look. It has two floors- the ground floor is mainly the bar area with a bar counter. The next floor has a sophisticated restaurant type of feel which serves both food and alcohol.
Now, coming to the main part, the menu. The bar menu has different types of cocktails and mocktails other than the usual liquor menu. They have introduced a 'Talli Menu' which provides cocktails with Bollywoodish names and food items. The food menu has a large variety ranging from delicious appetizers to big plates which includes pasta pizza breads and a lot more. They have a very nice dessert menu as well where they have improvised some of our most loved desserts like cheesecake. They have also introduced a Drunch Menu which provides a 3 course meal and will definitely get you full. 
The service is really commendable and the staff is very approachable. The ambience and presentation of dishes deserves special mention. The newly introduced menus are really reasonable. The main menu is a bit pricey but the quality of the food is worth the price. A must visit for all.

Kolkata needs more places like this.. this is the kind of bar I would hit to if i am planning to go out with friends.. really nice ambience , good service , great cocktails. Although I found this place to be empty on two occasions ( may be a coincidence) or maybe they are unable to pull crowd. But I was happy with the kind of crowd I saw and I urge people to visit this place as it would be the last thing to see this place closing its doors forever. Try burrito bowl, quesidella , nasi goreng, mejico mule, great Gatsby, katsu chicken, Korean fried chicken is a must

Bodega is a great addition to the food scene in Kolkata, that has just been getting better. Great ambiance and decor, though it would help if the music was not like a night club and thumping as your trying to converse. The food is excellent in terms of taste, quality and quantity, I love the fact that they have real Brie cheese! Other dishes I'd recommend the pepper steak, chicken and waffles. They were kind enough to accomodate a request for fettuccine with bacon which is awesome, they should add it to the menu ;) The drinks are exciting especially in the way they are presented. The menu is fun and fresh and the washroom is amusing and helpful all at the same time. The male servers have hipster outfits though I feel the ladies that serve there need more practical outfits instead of being dressed like Spanish dancers. Prices are a bit on the high end but with a place like this you can't get any better, quality will cost you. Overall a very happy customer and a definite recommended place to visit. It's sure to be an experience!

Adjacent to barbeque nation, this is an interesting Spanish themed restaurant with an innovative menu. They also serve beef! üòÅ We went for brunch on the new year's Eve and tried their Beef pickle, chicken chips, kumala Chardonnay and egg Kejriwal. The beef wasn't the best, but it was good. The chicken chips came in a huge quantity, the egg Kejriwal was out of the world, it was full of mushrooms and broccoli, the yolk was creamy. The drinks were bland, and seemed to have no alcohol, so it was the disappointing part. The dessert Bodega Bomba made it up though.

FINALLY got a chance to go to Bodega - been itching to go since it opened and was not disappointed! The entrance is a little hard to find, it's just on the Park Street Camac Street crossing. The downstairs (I think) is just the bar. The restaurant upstairs has beautiful interiors. The big glass windows allowed to winter sunlight to stream through creating the perfect ambience (not to mention great lighting for pictures!) 

I was especially excited to see the Christmas Specials menu. I was also pleasantly surprised to find myself leaning towards the vegetarian options as they sounded delicious. The bar menu is extensive too. 
For drinks we had -
 lemon ice tea: I would recommend it only if you like your ice tea very strong. It's also far bigger in quantity than you get at most places
Vermillionaire - It was not only pretty as a picture but the perfect blend of fruity and sweet. Very refreshing! Would be lovely for summer. 
The drinks were both priced at 175

For starters we went for the 'shroom balls. My Dish of the Day - if you love mushrooms and cheese (and garlic!) these are a must-have! They were crispy fried to perfection! 

For mains we opted for the pumpkin and goats cheese ravioli off the Christmas menu. It certainly is ideal for a winter meal. The sauce was creamy and extremely flavourful. Would have liked a bit more texture to the dish but the winter veggies were juicy, sweet and complimented each other well in terms of taste! 

The desserts come for 300. We went for-
The Bodega Bomba - After hearing so much about this dish we had to try it out. The menu description sounds like something out of Masterchef. Loved the multiple textures. So many fun aspects to this dish from cracking open the white chocolate ball to looking for all the layers inside it was a delight  for all the senses. Personally would have liked it to be a little less sweet! 
Sunday Movie Night - the name of this dessert is SO apt! Caramel popcorn, chocolate, peanut butter and candy floss- all your favourite flavours rolled into one! Don't miss the added detail of the chocolate camera roll! Again, loved the idea but found the seeet to be overpowering! 

Despite being on the steep side, Bodega is a great place to visit for a nice brunch with fun drinks and gorgeous looking food!

Visited on a Friday evening and found it surprisingly empty (though the club/restaurant next door had a huge waiting outside of it). Decided to walk in and try it out any way.

The seating and ambiance is lovely. The only complaint would be that it was a tad too cold (though might put that on myself since I was not dressed warmly enough).

Ordered cocktails and appetizers - followed by more cocktails (in all tried 4 varieties) and main course. Overall food - was amazing! I am surprised people dont visit this place more often, the food was out of the world. Tried the garlic burnt risotto and a thai-red-curry with Malaysian rotis - both were extremely yummm.¬†

I would probably have given this place a 4.5 star except for the big dampner - they do not accept American Express cards! In the era of demonitization and when your bills come to 3000+ for two, how can they not be tied up with AmEx? That was really disappointing since it led to an embarrassing situation of trying to figure out my other cards (have not used them in ages and hence do not recall their pins).

PS - Yes, that is another thing. Two starters, two main courses, 4 cocktails = Rs. 3800. Its on the expensive side. Not a complaint but more of a FYI in the future.

This is probably one of the best decorated places I have even been to. Has a rustic look with bricked walls, canteen chairs and such a lovely wall stacked up with photos and books and souvenirs, giant glass windows with sunlight pouring in, an ambiance that will just lift your mood up! 
Coming to our orders, we took two cocktails. The Beer Balti and the Full Moon Party. The cocktails delivered everything their names suggested, Beer balti was lemony fresh and Full Moon was really a party. Perfect concoction of pineapple juice, lemon grass and generous punch of alcohol. 
We also took the Non-Veg Chakna Box filled with chips, chakli, chicken popcorn and fried prawns served with two dips!¬† Also we ordered the Asian Noodle Bowl with Chicken Thigh. Flat noodles served with fresh herbs and chicken in a black pepper sauce, this dish was the winner. 
Great experience. Would love to go back and try out their other specialities some other time.

Located in the Magma Complex, this multicusine restaurant is pretty good. The ambience is casual, the service is good. Coming to the food, tried the broccoli soup which was good, but would have liked more broccoli pieces in it. The dumplings and the mezze platter was well made. The cheese fritters were a little oily and heavy to my liking. Loved the wild mushroom pizza, crispy crust and adequate and tasty filling. The dessert ( Sunday movie night) was innovative and worth a try.

Went there quite a long time ago... it was bit difficult to locate... but don't worry I'm here... it was just behind the famous barbeque nation on the same building... the deco was fabulous... very attracting... with beautiful music on the air... but their sttafs should have to be more trained... also need to take care of the service... whatever, we tried some of their mocktails n cocktails along with some snakes n desserts...

‚óÜ Spicy Latin~ Okish one... in this the spicy factor was very lagging...

‚óÜ Tak a tok~ Excellent one...

‚óÜ Summer sparkle~ Good...

‚óÜ Wrapped in emerald~ Very bad... need to look after...

‚óÜ Croquets~ It was tasty... but very less in quantity...

‚óÜ Wild mushroom pizza~ This one was the show stellar of the day... Insane... just loved it... perfectly loaded with tasty mushrooms with good quantity of cheese in it over a soft n thin crust... baked with perfection... #highly recommend...

‚óÜ Bodega bomba~ It was treat to the eyes but not to the taste buds...

‚óÜ Japanese cheesecake avalanche~ Good...

‚óÜ Sunday movie night~ Now this one was just mind blowing... perfect from all the cornes... presentation, quality, quantity n obviously the taste... we just fighted for it... #highly recommend...

So overall it was a good experience... but not as much as we expected... but surely worth a visit from every foodies...

Yeah pocket pinch was bit on the higher side...

Dia des los Muertos or Day of the Dead is an interesting holiday celebrated in Mexico during November 1 & 2. Even though this coincides with the Catholic holiday called All Soul‚Äôs & All Saint‚Äôs Day, the indigenous people have combined this with their own ancient beliefs of honoring their deceased loved ones. In most villages, beautiful altars are made in each home. They are decorated with candles, flowers (wild marigolds), fruit, peanuts, plates of turkey mole, stacks of tortillas and big Day-of-the-Dead breads called pan de muerto. The altar needs to have lots of food, bottles of soda, hot cocoa and water for the weary spirits. Little folk art skeletons and decorated sugar skulls, purchased at open-air markets, provide the final touches. Local folk believe that happy spirits will provide protection, good luck and wisdom to their families. People clean tombs, play cards, listen to the village band and reminisce about their loved ones on this day.

hello,

We went to bodega on a Sunday evening.On entering the place it looked like a funky place for hangout.interiors was nice.table made out of stretcher used in the hospital.just loved the concept.Teenagers will love it.Nice place to have a quick bit from office either for lunch or early dinner.Service is good.Presentation was also very nice. food is ok.i liked the menu too.Have tried the Katsu chicken and wok tossed noodle.Noodle was good but the quantity of chicken in Katsu was less.If you like wasabi you must try this dish.They have tried to make a difference in the lemonade too by adding kafi lime leaves.the smell was amazing.I was a bit disappointed on the desert part.we have tried the rocky road which was ok. As the chocolate ganache was not as per standard and the nitrogen rock .......didnt see the smoke....I hope they will improve as these is a new joint.

Thanks¬†

So, when I entered Bodega. My eyes were jumping in joy. I was really happy to have found such a hang-out in a city like Kolkata where you hardly got to see such beautifully designed places. It took me back to where I belong. (No offence to the Kolkata-ites). Every city, in fact everything has it's pros and cons.

When we entered this place, my relatives took their seats. Not even exaggerating I was hobbling around Bodega for not less than fifteen minutes admiring the interiors and anything that caught my eye. Was so lost in the beauty of it's interiors that I had to forcefully be called to my seat to help them order food.

Coming to the food, we had ordered for Potato Tornado as starters and a Burrito Bowl as main course. Bodega Bomba as the dessert and a cocktail which I don't really remember the name of plus they don't even have an online bar menu for me to re-call the name. It's there in the pictures though. The second picture from the beginning.

The Potato Tornado kept up to it's name look wise. The taste was bad. It was simply bad. The experience was bad too. Forget two forks together. It took us not less than at least 10-15 seconds to pull out a slice each from the stick without messing up our fingers. The taste still lingers in my mouth while I write this.¬†

The Burrito Bowl was okay. Decent is the word. Nothing less. Nothing more.

Coming to the Dessert, Bodega Bomba. It was very very good. Left me wanting for more. The presentation and the taste was really nice. Probably the best amongst the dessert options. Would leave this a little less detailed for you guys to check it out. :)

The cocktail ! Aah ! WHat can I say ! The BEST I have ever had ! Neither too strong nor to light and mellow. It was a perfect blend of all their secret ingredients ! It was so so so good ! The presentation ! Beautiful. It came in a round, flat like glass crockery with a tiny way for the straw. Different ingredients like chillies and flowers were used to make it look pretty ! Check out the pictures ! This one shouldn't be missed out ! The best cocktail I repeat.

Word of advice - The menu options can be improved upon as well as the design. The Potato Tornado can be experimented with a little.

Almost an empty place during lunch........ambience just ok.....had heard lots about it....but it did not live up to the hype build around it......starters were nice both in taste and presentation but the main course was pathetic......the veg version of parsi tiffin was just plain dal chawal served with fried okra and a salad........another dish canai roti of Malaysian origin too was horrible.....the breads looked like packaged frozen malabar paratha being warmed and served......the bottled water...Vedic brand was smelling and the caipirinha ordered had hardly any alcohol until pointed out......lastly very overpriced place.....not worth

Great decor and ambiance, but the food was quite disappointing. We visited with some friends and our parents and the dishes were a total hit or miss (mostly a miss). Some preparations such as Nasi Goreng  were far from when they should be - Chinese fried rice served with peanuts and mango chatni!!
Wouldn't recommend it, not for the food at least.

I have missed authentic Mexican food for a while in Kolkata now - and its finally here! Located just off Park Street, Bodega has a warm vibe to it, that leaves you feeling fuzzy inside and with a smile on your face. The ambience is atypical of anything I have seen in Kolkata before - it is very kitsch and classy, with lots of little elements.¬†

This particular evening, we ordered the Mejico Fritas, which was only let down of the evening, The chips had this overwhelming taste of tomatoes, and taste more sweet than tangy. We also ordered the Chargrilled veggie tacos and laal maas tacos, which were just delicious! They were extremely flavourful, and had us begging for more. We also had both their soup options, the vegetarian and non - vegetarian soup of day. The presentation was very cute - they poured the soup over the dry elements, from a little cup. In mains, we ordered the Roti Canai and the Chipotle Chicken Burrito Bowl. They both had generous serving sizes, and were cooking to perfection. The only thing we probably missed in the Burrito Bowl was guacamole, but that can be overlooked easily. In dessert,we had the Rocky Road, which tasted nothing short of a deconstructed Snickers. Super yummy! Their Tres Leches was a let down though, the creme de menthe overpowered the sweet condensed milk that is so typical of this dessert.¬†

The service is warm and friendly, although I do wish they could pay a little more attention to detail (it never hurts to refill someone's glass of water before they have to ask for it :) ).¬†

This is an expensive place, I will not even deny it. But for the quality, taste and experience, it is super worth it. Give it a shot of a quiet date, or a fun family get - together. I am sure it will win you over with its quaint and semi - formal vibe.

Came here for the deserts and I can say I made the correct choice. Had the bodega bomba and rocky road. The bodega bomba had the super raspberry taste. Had heard about this, but trying is much better. The rocky roads had amazing presentation and everything is edible. Although not a fan of dark dessert, but the choices I had here given with rocky road was splendid. Would surely recommend.

Visited Bodega with a friend for lunch as the menu and reviews on zomato sound very interesting. To start with, the ambience is really good - it did not seem like a place in Kolkata. We ordered for a pizza chilli - which was quite good actually and ravioli caprese - it tasted really delicious. We absolutely loved the ravioli. For drinks we ordered for an LIT - it was made well but nothing exceptional. We have bodega bomba for desserts - it was a virtual treat to look at and tasted good. It had so many elements in it, we really savoured this dish. On a scale of 5 I would rate this place as
Ambience - 5/5
Service - 4/5
Food - 4/5
Pocket friendly - 3/5

Had been here few days back on a Saturday. The place looks amazing. The menu spread was not very appealing. We just has a couple of entrees and that too was not very great and so we made our move from their. Seeing the Zomato page we were too attracted to the place. The entrees let us down and we left. Hopefully when I visit next time, their is something different and new that amazes me. Till next time.

Food - 5/5 Their selection in the menu is pleasantly interesting. The main course and starters are delicious. But special mention should go to their desserts. Their bodega bombs is scrumptious.
Ambience - 5/5 Their decor is amazing. The windows are an excellent feature.
Service - 4.5/5 The servers are well trained and attentive. Wish they were a bit faster though.

All in all would definitely visit again! Loved the place!

Was in my list for long. Reserved a table as it was recommended, but the place was relatively empty at 9:30PM. Since we already had starters somewhere else, we directly ordered for mains. Ordered a cantina chilly pizza and a truffle fettuccine. The pizza was thin crust with colourful pepper toppings and was average. The fettuccine was also. Itching to die for. The pocket pinch was slightly on the higher side. The service too is tad bit slow considering that the restaurant was half empty.

This particular place was on my bucketlist for quite a long time and finally could hit this place today afternoon. This is located just behind Barbeque nation near Titan eye + showroom. The ground floor is a lounge with pretty amazing ambiance. We chose to sit upstairs and it was really beautiful. Coming to food we had ordered their hawaiian paradise tea, one kingfisher premium and seafood pizza. The hawaiian paradise tea was too rejuvinating, after a tiring day in doubt you can surely go for this one. Seafood pizza was good but the smell of the toppings were too strong. Overall had a great experience. Prices are on the higher side. Service was okayish.

Was really looking forward to a great evening but it turned out to be a very disappointing one. Very few dishes made the mark. The Moroccan lamb was stale...the pizza was way below the mark...the nasi goreng could have been better recreated by a gariahat street  vendor.... And then the dessert's...best we don't even talk about it...STALE in caps and bold. Go at your own RISK!

Dropped in here on a wet afternoon in early August. The ambience in the restaurant on the first floor is stupendous - very relaxing. There is a lounge on the ground floor. The decor is very chic. The stewardesses are pleasant and friendly.

The restaurant menu is eclectic. We ordered pickled chilli prawns for starters and seafood pizza (calamari, prawns, bhetki) , spaghetti aglio olio with prawns and beef chilli fry for the entr√©e. The dessert we chose was Bodega Bomba.

The food was superlative esp the stone oven pizza and the dessert. Service was good, could have been tad quicker. Prices are on the steep side but well worth every penny.

All in all, a fun experience. A good addition to Park Street!

The ambience is fantastic! Really really good! But how can a restaurant hope to survive with such a weird menu and bad tasting food? We had the Bengali Mary which was good, a different take. The marinara patatas were below average, just about edible. And the roti canai, was also just about average. All in all nothing exceptional. I don't think I would want to visit again, solely because the food wasn't exciting enough.

Location-Park centre,near titan eye centre.

Heard a lot about this place and was keen to visit after seeing their beautiful presentation of food on different social media sites.This place has a two storey sitting area and serves variety of cuisines such as Mexican,Italian,Turkish,Korean and Mediterranean.It was quite difficult for us to locate this place but we ultimately did it.We were actually fascinated by the interiors at this place but the food was just good to see and the service needs quite a bit of improvement.

Service-The service at this place is good and reliable.The staff has been trained very well with the dishes but they are not attendive to the diner.They all remain gathered at a place instead of looking after the customer.

Ambiance-The ambiance at this place is praiseworthy.Its calm and soothing.As said we were fascinated by their interiors and not only that everycorner at this place has been detailed very well especially their second storey.

Food-The food at this place was excellent at its presentation but the taste was not praiseworthy.We had-
1:Signature Margarita
2:Rocky road
3:Sunday movie night
4:Bodega mezze board

Among them you must try their"Sunday movie night" dessert as it was the only dish we appreciated in all aspect.

Service-3.5/5
Food-3/5
Ambiance-4.5/5

On my previous visits I had walked through the length and breadth of Park Street looking for a place to hang out with friends and enjoy some nice music over drinks....but was always disappointed as all I could fine was either a fine dining place or a regular family restaurant or a regular resto-bar. This time however I landed at this place and I thought I was lucky to find it. A place which is not so Kolkata (not in a bad sense, of course). It's one of the places where you have a wide variety of cuisines from Korean to Mediterranean to Italian to Mexican and mind you...they seem to do the food presentation part quite well! Interesting cocktails too!! But it beats me...why would they have a dish which is named "egg kejriwal" yes you read it right....:)

Next time I would love to try out their cocktails too...the Bengali Mary being one of them !!!

Oh before I forget... don't forget to try their deserts !!

Overall a very pleasing and happy experience!

Will definitely come back Bodega!

One suggestion - have a bigger and more prominent sign board as its quite difficult to spot the place!

Located at the Park Centre, Bodega Cantina Y-Bar ,probably has the sweetest staff amongst all the Park Street restaurants . The place is very tastefully decorated. It is chic and classy at the same time. We were seated at a corner table which was pretty cozy too. The food though was the highlight of our evening. It tasted so fresh and so delicious that we immediately decided to come back and visit the place again. The drinks were equally amazing .However , the wifi was a let down. It wasn't working at all and wasn't fixed even after we asked our waiter to fix it. 
The overall experience ,however, was great. Loved how the place was done with an eye for the minutest of details.

Bodega had been calling to me ever since it had the picture of its Rocky Road doing rounds on Instagram. Hence, when a friend suddenly said, lets drop in at Bodega one fine evening, I could hardly turn him down. If you know your way around Park Street, finding the location should not be an issue. Take the right from Barbeque Nation (from Park Street towards Camac Street) and it is nestled on the ground floor of the second building on your right. The fact that the Cantina is on the back side of the building makes it a bit hard to spot, especially because there is a very tiny little board boasting the name. We were asking people where it was while standing at the main entrance of the same building that it is in. A bigger board should help.
                                                                ...

Lunch at Bodega Cantina Y Bar. When out client invited us for lunch to Bodega I was a bit apprehensive having read a lot of negative blogs/posts about the place. 

The entire experience was a delight both visually as well as for the taste buds.

Started with Thai High a vodka based cocktail with lemon grass infusion and my colleague had a Fish Tank themed Gin based cocktail. As the two of us were a bit late and the others were there about half an hour before us there were quiet a few starters already on the table amongst which were the Grilled Artichoke and the Compressed Beetroot Salad. The Grilled Artichoke was really delicious served on a bed of lemon, olive oil and basil. Loved the combination of the Chilli walnut brittle with the Rosemary Apple and beetroot, unfortunately all the goat cheese pannacotta was over by then. We ordered the Shroom Balls and Fish Kataifi. The shroom balls were Exotic mushrooms stuffed with fresh mozzarella and garlic and fried with a light coating of bread crumbs. They were really good. The fish was nice but did not make it to my must have list unlike the Shroom Balls.
Then we ordered some Miso Veg Bao, Spinach Fondue Tart, Mac & Cheese, Asian noodle bowl with crunchy vegetables and tofu and a Wild Mushroom Stone Oven Pizza.
The Pizza came first and was a mushroom lovers (like me) delight. In every bite I got to taste at least two different kinds of mushrooms. Once again the garlic and mushroom combined with the mozzarella on the crisp thin crust pizza was great. The Bao was melt in your mouth explosion of flavors. The Spinach tart was nice but then I never cared much for Spinach. The dish of the day for me was the Asian Noodles with crunchy vegetables and Tofu. I could have had an entire bowl of the same (nearly did as well). 

Dessert was the Rocher which is Bodega's take on the Ferrero Rocher and Sunday Movie Night. Both the desserts were to die for. The caramel used chocolate mouse and sea salt caramel icecream combined very well with the peanut butter foam which were on the Sunday Movie Night plate.

The best part about bodega is the ambience. There are two floors to it. First floor's the floor to hang around with friends, tap your feet to music and have some drinks. The second floor is a floor to sit down and dine. The food's pretty average. We had ordered the chicken bao,Caesar's salad, BBQ chicken pizza,Sunday movie night and bodega bomb. The chicken bao and the Caesar salad was actually pretty good. However the pizza was average. The deserts look better than they taste and it's pretty overrated tbh.

Closely situated to MBar; however entry is from Camac street. The ambience is nice and has a fresh feel to it. It has two levels : ground is for the bar and the 1st floor is the dining area. We ordered a lot of things but liked the appetisers the best. The main course was average and desserts had unique names but tasted nothing exceptional. The cocktails were not bad. So a good place to chill with friends but if you are a foodie then you can go once and then decide to visit again or not.

Robin Hood Army is overwhelmed to inform you that Mission500k was a great success and it would have not been possible without your support. We served 516,916 people in India and Pakistan, and Kolkata itself served 22,345 heads, beating its target of 20,000. Not only do these numbers give us immense pleasure, but also the hope it stands for in the future.¬†

On this Independence Day, we felt the happiness of an underprivileged person for whom a packet of food was God sent. Words fall short to express their emotions.¬†

From the bottom of our heart, we want to truly thank Bodega. Thank you for your support, time, and food donation. Our team and volunteers are extremely grateful to you.¬†

We look forward for your continuous support in the future. The war against hunger is on !¬†

Warm Regards,¬†
Team RHA

After trying them out for lunch, I agree with the other reviews that Bodega, though beautiful in decor, doesn't deliver in terms of food. Disproportionate plating of food (like a chicken shwarma needs a lot of chicken; a non-veg burito bowl can't stand on 3 nuggets of meat and an obscene amount of rice. Ratios are completely whack!), and misleading serving sizes (what's the point of serving "mains" if the main sizes don't fill you up?) disappoint. Flavours need to be tweaked but otherwise they're generally there.  Service needs a revamp, in terms of the way serving staff conduct themselves, their appearance and hygiene, and their ability to communicate the menu to customers. In sum, Bodega feels like it hasn't quite figured out it's teething problems, if this is what it is.

Visited Bodega today after T2 reviews. But the experience was bad. The mocktails were OK but it was served with a straw that was unsuitable and it needed to be sipped. We ordered for beef chili costing Rs.295..it was not enough for a single adult even. The second dish was Chicken burrito which was same price range ..came in a bigger bowl and was very disappointing. The dessert Sunday movies was all gloss no content looking colourless..felt fleeced with the quality quantity and price...not recommended at all..more of a BADEGA. ..

Visited bodega on Eid for a friends birthday. 
Being a dry day all I could taste was Mocktails and food :)
Most of the Mocktails were bland, I loved one with a lemongrass flavour though.
Coming to food I found it just ordinary.. The nachos were disastrous, the Mac n cheese was the best, the agli o olio was too oily. The mezze platter was just ok, their paratha with Thai curry was nice. 
The desserts were exceptional, all of them were too good.
The service was good too :)

New place in the age old magma building premises of park street. Quite spacious. Nicely disected in two floors. Looks rustic like the name. Tastefully decorated. The bar men will be the highlight. Drinks and cocktails are innovative. Menu is fresh and nice. Prices are on the higher end. Music seemed a little boring. Overall a nice joint. Service is spontaneous. Valet parking is available. No wifi i suppose.

After hearings from more than a few people that Bodega doesn't live up to the hype it created I still wanted to try the place for myself. Needless to say i should ve gone by the reviews.. Below average food and beverages and pathetic service left a bad taste in the mouth. Don't think would want to visit soon. Especially disappointing because i ve eaten great food from the same owners at food stalls prior to the opening of the restaurant!!

Bodega doesn't live up to all the hype around it! Right from the reservation system to the service at the restaurant, something is going wrong. We made a reservation for the 7:45 slot on Friday evening, only to be reminded twice by the lady on the phone to 'be on time!' Not just this, I had two phone calls saying 'make sure you're on time'! Almost felt like going back to school with so much pressure to be on time! There is a polite way of saying this, and, you don't call twice to remind your customer. 

On arriving, we were told we would 'have to leave by 9:30'!! Umm, is this a birthday party? And why were we not told at the time of reservation so we could have planned our night accordingly? You can't decide when I have to leave - what if I'm having a good time and ordering more food and drinks? You can't plan my Friday night for me! Again, very rude way of saying this. I appreciate this might be your policy, all you can say is we will shift your table down to the lounge! Not 'leave!'

Anyhow, we put all of this behind us and thought we would enjoy the evening. Cocktails - were like juice! No alcohol! We returned all 3 cocktails after having 2 sips and ordered beer instead - atleast that would not be diluted. On complaining to the manager, he said yes, our cocktails are very mild!! Sadly, we were charged for these cocktails too. I run a restaurant too, and when a customer complains and returns something, I would never charge. Well, guess it's another restaurant policy. 

The food was the only thing good about this place. Service was terrible! Almost had to wave like crazy to attract the attention of any of the servers. The music was terribly loud to a point where you couldn't even hear your own voice. The speakers upstairs kept being switched on and off so we had our moments of soft music in between before it went crazy loud again. Is this a nightclub? Or a restaurant? If the latter - why the loud music? If the first, why ask us to leave? 

I really hope the management reads this and takes corrective steps! It's got good food, but when you're charging these prices, we do expect a complete experience! Good food can be eaten sitting at home too.

I don't usually write bad reviews, but this was surprisingly a terrible experience at a restaurant where I would never had expected it! Step up guys, you can get this right.

Hello, 

I am writing this review out of utter distaste and animosity. 

I am a food admirer and love exploring new places, out of my same quest, I`d went out to Bodega the previous evening ( 05/07/2016 ) and to add on I`d taken my friends visiting me from Mumbai along. The place had made a good buzz in the city thus my expectations out of the place were upbeat and I`d presumed to be served well. Disappointingly, the place failed to deliver.

I was served with stale and uncooked food. The flavour was absent and it was unappetising on a whole. On complaining to the staff, the response I got was acutely blunt and brutish. I was told that I did not understand flavour well and had no knowledge about food or the oils that they use in preparation. 

I`m the director of a leading oil brand in the country, hence I`m absolutely able to critic the good from the bad, I have a living supported by this knowledge of mine. Therefore being spoken to in such an impolite manner and being treated in such a crude manner was a subject of disdain. 

There was no hospitality or atone of welcome in the way the staff spoke to me, they kept arguing and during this heated banter, a drink also spilled over my phone. The management stayed aloof until this happened after which also not much attention was paid. and Such was the PAID service I was offered. 

I am completely letdown by this attitude and its certain that I`m neither visiting nor recommending Bodega to anyone. If interiors were enough you would be a perfect go-to but it hardly sums up to much with the distasteful food and the ill-mannered service. 

I hope in future the authorities reflect on the kind of place they wish to hold an improvise on the basics until then the place is a definite thumbs down.

Went to Bodega with great expectation. The decor is fantastic and the place looks very lively.But food is very ordinary.The quantity served is very less . They should increase the portions if they want people to come back. We had a dish called Parsi tiffin which was very ordinary. Just some fried rice with lady finger vegetable and one very ordinary Dal vegetable. It is shocking the prices they are charging.Lastly we had their desert. The quantity as usual was very less in comparison to the prices they are charging but was truly awesome. The presentation was very good and the taste was top class. Something to die for for. I will give them full marks for the desert.All in all if the management does not increase the portion or decreases 
the price I do not think the place would run.I would never go again.

Visited Bodega for dinner after hearing so much about its fabulous food and was thoroughly disappointed.

Drinks :

Ordered three signature cocktails. The packaging is fancy but that's it. All three cocktails had near to no alcohol and tasted of Nothing but water. The Alaskan fizz, Manhattan and Latina all three were about two sips of water. Before we could even get through our starters, the drinks were so little in quantity.

Also had ordered a Thai ice tea, but waited half the meal but it never came. Ultimately cancelled the order as was just pissed of by then.

With all this, had also ordered for two small whisky. But no way were they 30 ml.

Food:

Ordered two starters: the pot stickers and the quinoa salad. The quantity was minimum at best and the taste average at most. 

Next we ordered the Parsi tiffin box, shwarma and the burrito bowl. The quantity was too less to be considered as a main couse. The tiffin had four slots. The first one had a salad the second fried okra. The third one was the dhansak. Was so looking forward to trying it but again min quantity ruined the dish. The pulao was very basic in taste and just had a lot of fried onion thru it.  The proportion. Of rice to dhansak was way off for it to be a enjoyable experience.

The shwarma again had a bread so thick that had to actually open it up to find the filling. Even then for an entire roll there could not have been more than a teaspoon of filling inside. What made the experience even worse was that the hummus provided with it was not enough for even two bites so we asked for a refill and they actually charged us for the extra dip. Have never come across a high end eating joint that charges you for a dip . For me this just showed how cheap the place is.

Last on our order list was the burrito bowl which we returned as despite the menu mentioning the guacamole ,there was none in the dish. After returning the dish and pointing out the error, the staff actually argued with us that it was not their fault and charged us for a dish we had returned.

Dessert:

This was the much hyped Movie Night. After being so disapapointed with everything, was looking forward to a good end. The dessert was not to my taste as it was too sweet. Needed some salt or dark chocolate for some relief.

Service:

The food came after a while and was never piping hot. Moreover, the staff arguing with us just put off our mood.

Overall:

Give this place a miss, it just isn't worth your time or your money. Its too hyped. Ive had not so good meals but have never left a place hating pretty much everything about it.

We began to order with a few drinks, a bottle of beer, a glass of red wine and a sangria. We order chicken chips, which was good; spinach fondue tart was average. The BBQ pizza was really good. We ordered two desserts Rocky Road and Mejico. Both of them were amazing. The desserts were the best part of the entire meal. 
Overall, the place is worth the effort of looking for it( near Mbar). The desserts are really good and I recommend to definitely try the desserts out.

It's located on the turning of CAMAC street from Park Street. Park centre building. Valet is available. 
It is divided into two levels, ground level bar sitting style. Nice decor. 
Upper level has fine dining style sitting. 
Food is good, Spanish chips, shroom balls and pizza are must try. 
Really liked they serve cocktails. Atlantic fizz, eureka...
Way they serve them is something new to Calcutta. 
Old school cocktails are also available.
On recent visits, it isn't that good with its cocktails.

The artichokes and the Bodega Bombay were the highlights of a delightful meal here.

it felt a little strange when I got a call with somebody asking for direction to my place and in the evening, a gentleman coming down physically for inviting me to the launch party of some food joint. But the actual surprise came, when I saw the invite. It was a strange looking dabba with the invitation card inside and a small bottle of their special mocktail with a jar of marinated olives. Well, the mocktail was pretty ordinary, but the invitation was mind blowing. Well, soo after, there was a fight between my son and my mom for possession of the red dabba and as usual, my son won the fight.

I was present at the said date and time at the venue and it looked like these guys know what they‚Äôre doing- feels good. The welcoming was perfect and we were seated on the first floor. Bodega is basically a lounge with special attention to their cocktil menu and with a fancy food menu. The ambience was perfect.

I must say, the presentation was fantastic for their cocktails, slightly quirky in certain cases. But, it was a fun party, so who cares ? Among them, I loved the Bengali mary (quite spicy), for which probably I‚Äôll go again.

Frankly, as compared, the food was quite ok-ish, and has got a definite chance of improvement. Among them, I somehow, I liked their pork sausage salad and the spring rolls.

Would I go again ? Definitely yes, this would be a lovely place to hang out with friends. Though slightly on a pricey side, I still like this place.

Went there one fine evening with the highest of expectations, the place being the talk of the town, and boy were we disappointed! The ambience is top notch, no two ways about that, but that's about it, everything just goes downhill from there. We were in a bit of a rush and since the place wasn't serving alcohol that day for some readon, we jumped straight into main course with chicken taco and seafood pizza. The tacos they served were basically 3 teeny tiny roties topped with a bunch of cabbage and 2-3 minuscule pieces of shredded chicken. For the price they are charging, its a shame. Seafood pizza was better, about the size of a medium pizza and loaded with cheese and an amazingly tangy sauce. Then came the desserts - the main attraction of the place. The look of the 2 desserts, the "bodega bomba" and the "saturday movie night" definitely put a huge smile on our faces - they were pretty as a picture - however didn't taste as good. Overall the experience was so so. For me, they are definitely not living upto the hype that has been created around them.

To start with, we were finding hard to reserve a table in the weekends. Thereafter, there was slot based reservations. Meaning - I can dine here either at 7:45 or 9:45 slot.
The hype made my expectations soar... The place and ambience is very good to go with friends and family.
The food is good, tastes up to the mark.
Nothing extraordinary though.
Being a vegetarian, the place has good options in food. The menu is crafted well. We ordered for couple of dishes out of which, I liked Roti Canai (I recommend asking for an extra bowl of rice to match up with the curry serving) and Mezze Platter.
The cocktails are very different and I recommend trying some. It's very subtle in taste and presented very well. I liked the litchi based, chocolate based, Thai high.
I would give 5/5 to the presentation of the desserts but the portion size is very small and does not taste upto the mark. We did not like Bodega Bomba. Rocky Road was average and Sunday Night (caramel) was better than these two.

Bodega had been calling to me ever since it had the picture of its Rocky Road doing rounds on Instagram. Hence, when a friend suddenly said, lets drop in at Bodega one fine evening, I could hardly turn him down. 

Location:

If you know your way around Park Street, finding the location should not be an issue. Take the right from Barbeque Nation (from Park Street towards Camac Street) and it is nestled on the ground floor of the second building on your right. The fact that the Cantina is on the back side of the building makes it a bit hard to spot, especially because there is a very tiny little board boasting the name. We were asking people where it was while standing at the main entrance of the same building that it is in. A bigger board should help.

Ambience:

The place is divided into two sections. While the ground floor is the lounging area, with good music happening and people tapping their feet to it and sipping on cocktails, the first floor is where you settle down with your group of friends for a proper meal. Both the areas are tastefully done, but the first floor had my attention trapped. The big windows, spacious seating and little but prominent additions to the wall are all very welcoming and beautiful to look at. 

Food:

We were first advised to settle down at the ground floor but a little pursuing took us to the floor above. Once settled, we ordered a bunch of mocktails to go with our other courses.
All the mocktails were served in beautiful glasses. We ordered the-

Tak A Tok- 

This was the only mocktail that impressed all the occupants at the table. It was the perfect balance of sweet and sour, catering the perfect refreshment it was meant to.

Summer Sparkle- 

This one, though not as impressive as the Tak a Tok, was not too bad either. I had specially asked Roshni (our server) too ask the bar tender to control the sweetness in this specific drink since it has a lot of grape and hibiscus reduction action going on. But sadly there was almost no sweetness at all. After a sip or two I had to send it back for a dash of sugar syrup. 

Wrapped in Emerald- 

This was a complete disappointment and we could hardly go through half of it. It was overpowered by the flavour of coriander, restricting the other ingredients from coming across, at all. This was finally sent back.

We then moved onto some appetizers. This was without a doubt the best course. We ordered the Chicken and Cheese Croquettes, and the Wild Mushroom Pizza. While we were completely and utterly in love with the wildly cheesy and mushroom-y pizza, the croquettes did not disappoint either. A few more of these croquettes on the plate would have been a welcome sight though. If you are planning to drop by, these two are a must try.

Once done with our pizza, we went forward and ordered our desserts.¬† We ordered the-

Sunday movie night- 

This was without a doubt the best dessert on the table. I see all the reasons why this is one of the highest grossing desserts on the menu. Two discs of nicely tempered chocolate hold smooth chocolate mousse inside, topped with two clouds of candy floss. A must try.

Bodega Bomba- 

Nothing worth the rage, frankly. The dessert surely does have a lot of elements in it- such as the tempered white chocolate domes, the raspberry drops, and the mousse inside, but none of them played their part to the ultimate best. 

Japanese Cheesecake-

Again, an absolute disappointment. We hardly went through with the desert. Let‚Äôs just say, when and if I return to Bodega, this will definitely not be one of the reasons. 

All over the food is okay, but is not something you will be blown away by. The hype around it had me expecting much more, but I was just left with an average experience. Apart from the ambience, the only good part of our time spent there was Roshni, our server, who took good care of us, with no other seniors/managers taking any heed at all (especially when food/drinks were being sent back). All in all an average experience.

Absolutely delightful place. Was on my list of places to explore this trip and I was not disappointed. Interested and aware staff, well-curated decor, lots of space and sunshine, superb cocktails and local/unique twists to drinks and great food. You don't get places that have things going so right, very often. Loved every bit of our afternoon drinking and snacking there. I was surprised to see it not nearly packed enough for a Saturday afternoon, but then I guess it is still new and things are a bit different in cities like Bangalore and Bombay, compared to Cal. Since Calcutta is more about the cuisine authenticity and taste and every new place has to work extra hard to establish its credibility, it won't be easy to get people storming the place, just yet. Definitely worth storming though. I wish the Bodega staff the very best and hope they do really well. They have everything in place üòä

We tried the summer sparkle, charcoal LIIT, the great gatsby, gondhoraj mojito, Bengali Mary, corona-rita and Mejico Mule alongside mac n cheese, tortillas, some kinda twisty potato fries and chilly baby corn. Everything was great!

To start with, we were finding hard to reserve a table in the weekends. Thereafter, there was slot based reservations. Meaning - I can dine here either at 7:45 or 9:45 slot.
The hype made my expectations soar... The place and ambience is very good to go with friends and family.
The food is good, tastes up to the mark.
Nothing extraordinary though.
Being a vegetarian, the place has good options in food. The menu is crafted well. We ordered for couple of dishes out of which, I liked Roti Canai (I recommend asking for an extra bowl of rice to match up with the curry serving) and Mezze Platter.
The cocktails are very different and I recommend trying some. It's very subtle in taste and presented very well. I liked the litchi based, chocolate based, Thai high.
I would give 5/5 to the presentation of the desserts but the portion size is very small and does not taste upto the mark. We did not like Bodega Bomba. Rocky Road was average and Sunday Night (caramel) was better than these two.

Bodega had been calling to me ever since it had the picture of its Rocky Road doing rounds on Instagram. Hence, when a friend suddenly said, lets drop in at Bodega one fine evening, I could hardly turn him down. 

Location:

If you know your way around Park Street, finding the location should not be an issue. Take the right from Barbeque Nation (from Park Street towards Camac Street) and it is nestled on the ground floor of the second building on your right. The fact that the Cantina is on the back side of the building makes it a bit hard to spot, especially because there is a very tiny little board boasting the name. We were asking people where it was while standing at the main entrance of the same building that it is in. A bigger board should help.

Ambience:

The place is divided into two sections. While the ground floor is the lounging area, with good music happening and people tapping their feet to it and sipping on cocktails, the first floor is where you settle down with your group of friends for a proper meal. Both the areas are tastefully done, but the first floor had my attention trapped. The big windows, spacious seating and little but prominent additions to the wall are all very welcoming and beautiful to look at. 

Food:

We were first advised to settle down at the ground floor but a little pursuing took us to the floor above. Once settled, we ordered a bunch of mocktails to go with our other courses.
All the mocktails were served in beautiful glasses. We ordered the-

Tak A Tok- 

This was the only mocktail that impressed all the occupants at the table. It was the perfect balance of sweet and sour, catering the perfect refreshment it was meant to.

Summer Sparkle- 

This one, though not as impressive as the Tak a Tok, was not too bad either. I had specially asked Roshni (our server) too ask the bar tender to control the sweetness in this specific drink since it has a lot of grape and hibiscus reduction action going on. But sadly there was almost no sweetness at all. After a sip or two I had to send it back for a dash of sugar syrup. 

Wrapped in Emerald- 

This was a complete disappointment and we could hardly go through half of it. It was overpowered by the flavour of coriander, restricting the other ingredients from coming across, at all. This was finally sent back.

We then moved onto some appetizers. This was without a doubt the best course. We ordered the Chicken and Cheese Croquettes, and the Wild Mushroom Pizza. While we were completely and utterly in love with the wildly cheesy and mushroom-y pizza, the croquettes did not disappoint either. A few more of these croquettes on the plate would have been a welcome sight though. If you are planning to drop by, these two are a must try.

Once done with our pizza, we went forward and ordered our desserts.¬† We ordered the-

Sunday movie night- 

This was without a doubt the best dessert on the table. I see all the reasons why this is one of the highest grossing desserts on the menu. Two discs of nicely tempered chocolate hold smooth chocolate mousse inside, topped with two clouds of candy floss. A must try.

Bodega Bomba- 

Nothing worth the rage, frankly. The dessert surely does have a lot of elements in it- such as the tempered white chocolate domes, the raspberry drops, and the mousse inside, but none of them played their part to the ultimate best. 

Japanese Cheesecake-

Again, an absolute disappointment. We hardly went through with the desert. Let‚Äôs just say, when and if I return to Bodega, this will definitely not be one of the reasons. 

All over the food is okay, but is not something you will be blown away by. The hype around it had me expecting much more, but I was just left with an average experience. Apart from the ambience, the only good part of our time spent there was Roshni, our server, who took good care of us, with no other seniors/managers taking any heed at all (especially when food/drinks were being sent back). All in all an average experience.

Absolutely delightful place. Was on my list of places to explore this trip and I was not disappointed. Interested and aware staff, well-curated decor, lots of space and sunshine, superb cocktails and local/unique twists to drinks and great food. You don't get places that have things going so right, very often. Loved every bit of our afternoon drinking and snacking there. I was surprised to see it not nearly packed enough for a Saturday afternoon, but then I guess it is still new and things are a bit different in cities like Bangalore and Bombay, compared to Cal. Since Calcutta is more about the cuisine authenticity and taste and every new place has to work extra hard to establish its credibility, it won't be easy to get people storming the place, just yet. Definitely worth storming though. I wish the Bodega staff the very best and hope they do really well. They have everything in place üòä

We tried the summer sparkle, charcoal LIIT, the great gatsby, gondhoraj mojito, Bengali Mary, corona-rita and Mejico Mule alongside mac n cheese, tortillas, some kinda twisty potato fries and chilly baby corn. Everything was great!

Had the most horrible experience!
When we reached the restaurant at 9:40 the hostess was surprised to find us 5 mins early. After being incognito for 10 mins she came back only to give us a temporary table & we were told that we would be given a proper table in 5mins again. 
After calling out to a waiter thrice we were finally able to place order for starters. Just when the starters were served, our group of 6 we was assigned a table for 4, which the hostess insisted was a table for 6. It was a bit too much for us and we had to ask for the the manager to come down who made an appearance after 15 mins. When we explained the entire thing to him he stumped us by asking "Anything else?" Needless to say if you do decide to go down ~ expect "Dhaba Service"
On to the food - Seriously nothing much to write home about, lots of restaurants offer much better food!
A note to the owners - Getting a fancy set up in place is sure to get the people through the door the first time but what makes them come back is food & service which is truly lacking!
P.S. Your toilet lock is broken, you might consider getting it fixed!
Muchos Gracias!

Pathetic experience.. Pathetic service.. Never go there.. We booked a table for 6 for 9.45 PM.. We reached at 9.40 and were told by the 'courteous' hostess that why have we come early.. Then she vanished for 15 minutes.. Then we are offered a waiting table promised to be shifted in 5 mins.. After half an hour we are given a table of 4 saying that it is for 6.. Moreover no one was interested to take the order.. Even after requesting to speak to the manager he didn't come for 15 mins.. A very pathetic experience !!

Its one of those cafe/bars/joints which has a great ambience and decor... cocktails are different and some are very well prepared.. dint like thai high at all though.. we ordered veg food and it was surprisingly way over our expectation..  very good on taste buds and quantity was decent as well... 1 starter, 4 main course, 1 dessert came approx 2700 including tax .. not very high on pocket either... 5 of us were almost full after the meal.... loved the experience altogether.. definitely going back üëç

Very very disappointing place . We went there for Sunday lunch n were famished. But all they had was a brunch menu. The menu is "food winked". Moreover the staff themselves can't explain what's in the dish. To add to that the serving size is very less . They don't score on taste also. Kolkatta has far better choices n there is nothing here to come back for. Go here only if u have no appetite n u r desperate to throw your money. Can we give negative rating ??üòè

The newest entry in Park Street, probably the most innovative one. The plating Here is like a theater, cocktails are really amazing and Food is quite nice. 
Visited this place twice, the review is based on those visits. The interiors are probably the best you will see in Kolkata, a very nice atmosphere with some comfortable seating. 
I have tried their wild mushroom pizza which was really good, taco, mezze platter, eggs and few salads and also keema pizza. Not all food items were good considering the price. For Beverages we ordered Spicy Latina, take a tok and two more the names I don't remember. They were presented nicely and tasted good. For desserts we ordered for Bodega bomb, cheesecake which was really bad. Making me cut points or else would have rated this place 4.5 at least. 
This place is doing good but they have potential to do better if the management looks into details and it will surely be a hit.

Bodega is the newest and probably the most popular spot in town at the moment. It was difficult to get a table even on a Wednesday night. 
The decor is good and quite unlike any other place in town. The atmosphere is cool and casual. But it's not made like a fine dining establishment. 
Regarding the food and beverages - the heart of any restaurant - in one word, disappointing. The drinks have fancy names and attractive descriptions but fall flat in terms of flavour and taste. You would expect a place with heavy Mexican influence to mix a good margarita, but sadly that isn't the case. The spicy Latina is a big disappointment. The flavours are complex but not appetising/ pleasing at all. The Mexican mule hardly tasted of tequila and ginger. In the end, I regretted having not ordered a whisky or wine straight up.
The food is average. The guacamole and sour cream were below average. Starters were Ok and in the mains, the burrito bowl was nice. The noodles and veg tempura were below expectations. The noodles were overcooked and the rice with the tempura was devoid of any Asian flavours. The plating of the dishes was also identical - everything served in big bowls. 
The desserts too flattered to deceive. The Bodega bomba looks beautiful but tastes average. However, there seems to be some potential in the dessert section and other choices could be better. 
If i would make a visit sometime soon - I doubt so. 
I would strongly suggest the people in charge to get their fundamentals right - the food and the drinks. A business cannot run for long on marketing hype alone. I feel the place has the potential to turn into something really exciting - a Tapas bar maybe?

Recently visited this newly opened Joint with my colleagues. The ambiance is nicely done and the day light makes it more energetic.
The food is realy good and so as the service. Found the ¬†service team members very friendly and with a smile on their face always. We tried a cocktail named-Alexander Fizz - the drink was unique and presentation also great.¬†

Only suggestion- Please get your bar menu changed with some other color as white tends to get dirty very fast.

Great place to hang out with friends.

Cheers!

we booked a table for 10 , the menu on zomato has no price , found that a tad bit strange that been said , its far to overpriced for mediocre food.
you can get the same kind of food in any other restaurant across Kolkata , there is nothing special in the food , the Japanese cheese cake was terrible , the worst cheese cake i have ever had in my life! it was not even a cake .

The decor is cute and well put together , upstairs is the restaurant and downstairs is the bar area, the cocktails are very nice and innovative in terms of how they serve it .¬†
The ambience is excellent and a perfect place to hang out unfortunately the food is such a disappointment .¬†

The waiters did not keep up with our orders , items arrived at different times .

For starters had to wait for 30 minutes despite of making an advance booking. We ordered a starter, a main and a couple of beers. The main(Ravioli) wasn't enough for even a single person. The starter never saw the daylight and after waiting for it for about 45 minutes and requesting the staff several times we cancelled paid and left.
Quintessential hype around a new place but nothing great..really needs to haul up service !
Loved the decor and ambience though !! Was a throwback to the Delirium Cafe in Brussels !

Went for a birthday party here. And I guess since the place is new they have a lot of demand especially in the weekends. So you have to book in advance to get a take and on top of it the American style of 2 hour tables is filled atm ie they take reservation for either 7 45 pm or 9 45 pm and you have to vacate your table in 2 hours. This place is a dinner drinks lounge or a restro bar if I may say so with a superb ambience. They have a lot of good fancy cocktails like charcoal martini among others. Food was also quite good with the menu including fusion sort of food. So ate a lot of different kind of items. Overall a good place to go to with friends to drink up, eat, chat and have a rocking time.

Bodega is probably the most nicely done up places in Kolkata. The interior is absolutely brilliant. The moment you enter, this place gives an amazing warm feeling and ambience.
Lower section is almost like a sports bar with a big screen . Upper section is the proper dining area. 
Food is pretty good, though I felt that a lot more could be added to the menu. 
Courteous staff, great food and drinks presentation. 
Overall the vibe of the place is superb.

Disappointment - excess of oil in the penne pasta. Beer wasn't chilled. :/

Must try - Wild Mushroom Pizza is something to die for.

Keep it up!!

My first visit to the restaurant tonight. Nicely done up but was not too impressed being seated on a 5 seater table when we were booked for 6. A bit cramped. Great menu to start with and all starters and drinks had a very different flavour. Food overall would be rated as 4.5/5. Portions are decent as per pricing. Desserts were outstanding! I would go again to try a few more dishes next time! A good effort I would say!

Bodega wins heart on the very first bite or sip.The restaurant offers several sumptuous and delicious dishes including exotic desserts thus undoubtedly it has something on the menu for all but when it comes to me THAI HIGH and RAVIOLI makes me visit the place regularly because that is what I like best! It wouldn't be wrong when I say, it may have taken a while to get to my mouth, but I've found the best RAVIOLI on the planet.
Along with that the prices are reasonable and the food is served quickly as opposed to other restaurants where one has to wait for long for your food to be served. The waiters and other staffs are polite, warm and welcoming.
 Thus, Bodega is a big THUMBS UP for me !

The newest gastropub in town had a lot to offer...from superb cocktails to lipsmacking food and to end it all with some delicious droolworthy desserts. 
The atmosphere of this place is very lively.
My top picks in the cocktails would be amor amargo and activated charcoal martini. In the main course the parsi tiffin box and ravioli turned out to be complete winners. 
The staff is well trained and disciplined. The owners are always around to ensure you're having the best of time.
Overall I had an awesome experience in this place and would definitely come back for more. I highly recommend it to all you guys. Cheers!

Bodega calls to the average Calcutta foodie's dream of having the ultimate dining experience, at the most jaw-dripping prices.

It is filled with flavours from every generation's childhood, like Mac & Cheese pots, Eggs Kejriwal, Parsi tiffin box (yum!)

The ambience is both funky and tasteful, done with a keen eye for detail, at the same time never losing the local feel of the city (yellow taxi on the wall being unmissable!)

The cocktails are colourful, with fresh ideas for presentation (check out The Great Gatsby, Atlantic Fizz) They entice your other senses along with your taste buds (Mirror Mirror)

The desserts are so original, they speak volumes about the team's inclination towards perfectionism! 
To believe this, go try Sunday Movie Night and their signature Bodega Bomba,

Keep it up Bodega !!!

I went to Celebrate Fathers day with my daughter and as I didn't have prior reservation they were kind enough to give me a table near the bar area. The service was bit  disappointing . We were sitting right below the AC vents which was " sweating" . This was a big annoyance and I could see the same happening at the adjoining table as well. I had to call the waiter every few minutes to clean the water Dripping on the table from the AC . The aglio alio ordered was very spicy and when the same was pointed out they promptly changed with fresh one without any spice . The Bodega mezze platter was good and so were the Mocktails. The service needs to be improved and waiters need to be better informed about the menu so they can guide us. When I inquired if they could make Spaghetti the waiter didn't seem to understand. I had to request for spoon, fork and tissue papers which were not on our table. Such small attention to details was lacking. No drinking water was served or asked for.  The music sounded good but the energy seemed missing in the atmosphere.

The worst place you can go for dinner. Firstly, we had booked a table for 8 and the table they gave us a table for 6. It was extremely uncomfortable to eat with our elbows bumping into each other. We adjusted because its sunday evening and very difficult to find a table for 8 people in park street. We ordered some cocktails and two of us ordered teachers whisky and some starters. The drinks and starters came on time and were good. We ordered another round of whisky and had to wait for 20 mins after which the waiter comes and says teachers is not available anymore and only scotch whisky available which was double the price. I got so offended that our group had to leave. This new restaurant needs to train their staff and stock their bar as well because i think it is a restro bar. Although the starters were good but my experience was very bad and will never ever go there.

Excellent ambience, small portions
We visited this place as a group of six friends- all light eaters, when the place had just opened up. We ordered their take on cocktails which were unusual and very very fun! The presentation was exquisite. The food- soft shell tacos, Japanese chicken, baos, spicy chana, nasi goreng, all were averagely tasty. But the portions were ridiculously small. We had to order a lot, and I mean it a lot of food! 
I would probably visit again for the feel of the place and the cocktails, but later come back to a nearby roll stall to fill my tummy!

So they tried and failed... Pretty miserably!! I mean the food is not bad it's very average... Not as good as they make it out to be. 
The burrito bowl does not take Mexican AT ALL, it was just rajma chawal with some chutney they tried to pass off as salsa!! 
The roti canai was good, flavourful. The gyozas (fancy momos) too was good. But the boas were not baos. They were not steamed bun but some weird combo of pita&bhatura. I could live with the fillings. 
The bar was impressive so were the drinks. That's about it. honestly the place was disappointing. Looked promising. But really service is terrible. The waiter looked confused when we asked him for jalape√±os. 
Up your game people or you're gonna die out after the first few weeks of hype...!!!!

I was invited to attend the launch of Bodega Cantina Y Bar and this post is planned for the review for the same but to my surprise I am more interested to write about my experience instead of a typical review! Blogger‚Äôs meet are nothing new in the city but there are really less¬† number of Restaurant‚Äôs or Hotel chain or PR agencies who actually think about the marketing part and this is what impressed me more about Bodega and their management. Smooth arrangement, proper invitation, and smart managerial skills; yes apart from good food and classy ambiance you need those as well. It is more of my professional background rather the blogger part of mine is satisfied with their managerial skills. One of my finest experiences of dealing with a smart group of people so far in terms of restaurant review!

We were walking towards another restauant last sunday evening when we saw the signboard of this place. It looked interesting and new so my husband and I decided to check it out. We were happy to see the place, the way it looked and felt. We requested for a table for two and luckily although the reataurant was full we got one at the bar lounge. I was excited to see many interesting flavour combinations in the cocktail menu. Our drinks were tasty and enjoyable. The music was good, so was the decor. But what impressed us the most was the food. The empanadas were surprisingly good. There was no heaviness of overused frying oil, no stickiness on fingers or greasy residue on the plate, the pastry was fresh and perfectly crisp. The wild mushroom pizza had uniformely cut and delicately cooked mushrooms and super fine herb garnish. We ordered another fried dish just to test the consistency and it was as good as the empanadas. Crisp and light on the outside, soft and fresh stuffing and no oily residue. The flavours were not the best I have tasted but good enough. It was however the detail of care in the cooking of the food and the no nonsense serving experience which made our eveing a hit. Definitely going here again for another try.

With amazing lively ambience and great sense of decor, Bodega is a very good addition to Kolkata. Love the sign on the outside. We were 4 of us, we ordered a couple of cocktails and snack items. The cocktails were really nice with in terms of taste and presentation. The food was also yummy- however they were out of french fries. Some of the dishes are very new and fun, like the Parsi Tiffin box. Dont forget to try the desserts, they're great. Staff were well trained and courteous. The only thing that could improve is the portion size as it was very little and thats why I won't give it a perfect 5. ¬†

Its a great new place on Park street and I highly recommend it.

A joint dream project by Urvika Kanoi and Akash Jaiswal, Bodega Cantina Y Bar at Park Street, is all set to transform the culinary map of the city.

Urvika, owner of Bodega, dropped out of film school and joined Le Cordon Bleu, London and on successful completion of her course, bagged an enviable internship opportunity. In her months of training, she honed her molecular techniques and also got a grasp of working in a commercial kitchen.

After coming back to India, she worked in some of the top kitchens and also conducted a pop-up, along with Mumbai Foodie, which received an overwhelming response.

In Kolkata, she had her own gourmet catering service by the name ‚ÄòThe Food Studio‚Äô which too became exceedingly popular within a very short span of time.

went for dinner on a weekend with friends. A lively joint teeming with youngsters and had the look of an old warehouse with memorablia on shelves in the walls.
We orderded 5 dishes including some pastas and starters along with a few mocktails.
The food and beverages were nice , but the one thing that eludes me is why prices keep creeping up to levels of europe and the rest of the west, with serving sizes creeping downwards. The beverages were cleverly served in thin tall glasses holding little more than a few sips. Food portions were also inadequately small.
If it weren't for this, the overall experience would have been very good.

Bodega Cantina-Y-Bar is exactly what Calcutta‚Äôs foodscape needed. Innovative food, delicious desserts, mind-blowing cocktails, I love this place already. Their attention to detail, be it with the interiors, or the plating, is absolutely fantastic. I can‚Äôt wait for them to be open for lunch and brunch! Extremely well priced, the staff is also very friendly and well-informed. An ideal spot for a dinner date, or an outing with friends- I am basically looking for any excuse to keep coming back. My favorites from the menu include the mac and cheese balls, beef chilli fry, the Great Gatsby and the Rocky Road. There‚Äôs so much more that I‚Äôm dying to try next time, and I have made dinner reservation already as they‚Äôre fast filling. Yummy in my tummy would be an understatement. Kudos Team Bodega :)
