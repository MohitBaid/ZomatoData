The ambience was quite average but the food is decent. Loses out if you compare with other restaurants offering same cuisines at the same price.

There's nothing ''Express'' about Oriental Express. It's rather slow, quiet & fails to impress at first sight. But when it comes to trying new food, the Chef here knows exactly, how to impress your taste-buds. And since we were determined to try new things, their menu had just the names, to excite us. So, we started with Crackling Spinach, Sushi Platter & 2 Soups; Tom Kha & Laksa. While we were waiting, the server suggested drinks; so we ordered some Mocktails. The Spinach came surprisingly quick. Deep fried, crunchy and filled with oily goodness. Tasted even better with the Chilled Pina Colada. Sushi was kind of a let-down; but Soup was full of Creamy, Coconutty goodness. That really built up our confidence on the Chef. Armed with our new-found confidence, we ordered the main-course, completely off the beaten track. Panchit Bihoon (Fillipino Rice noodles), Bamboo Rice & Roast Lamb in Mahlak Sauce.  After almost 20mins, the Bamboo rice appeared. To say, it was 'good' would be an under-statement. The noodles was rather ordinary, but went pretty well with the Lamb in Mahlak Sauce. For dessert, we went rather conservative; as we din't want to end it on a bad note, after such a lovely meal. So we ordered Oriental Special Fried ice cream; and for a guaranteed happy ending, we ordered the tried-n-tested Honey Noodles with Ice cream. Neither was a disappointment.Just the kind of adventure, the stomach wanted. Love at first night.

Everything about The Hotel Hindustan International is nice inspite of being a vintage hotel they still manage to maintain the place.
Staff is so humble be it a cab driver , security personnel or housekeeping... 
They do lack in terms of the taste of their food, need to improve that, else I would love to visit it again sometime soon!

The Orient Express is one place whose ambiance is something which needs to be mentioned! In fact, it is it's USP!
My wife & I tried the Chinese cuisine and I must say that it was indeed very refreshing  from the regular kind we had at Tangra!
However I was disappointed for not been able to eat Crabs as it wasn't available on the day!The portions offered viz- a- viz the price is very good!
Must say that the hotel Hindustan has revamped & is in tandem with modern times!

I am writing this review after several visits to this outlet at THE HHI hotel. Me and my wife simply love the food here. The food would probably give some of the asian outlets like Zen and Pan Asian a run for their money. 

However, where this place lacks is ambience. They really should build a seperation between their coffee shop and the restaurant as the crowd at the coffee shop is mixed and not too everyone's comfort level, especially couples. You do pay 5-star prices for dining here and in return expect 5-star treatment. Stained table covers is not the way to do that and nor are floor staff who treat you like you are sitting in barbq. I am not saying they are bad, but they are not there. However, the reason for my high rating is the food they serve which has been fabulous everytime we have visited this place. I believe it can revive the charm of the old oriental room that HHI had if they work on the ambience and guest services a little.

I had a 2 day family stay at HHI... The Oriental Express is an absolute delight which made us feel like royals.. Such luxury dinners should be experienced a few times in a lifetime.. Service and ambiance was memorable and ethnic.. 

Do start your dinner with the crispy chilli potatoes and baby corn and try the Mixed vegetables with tofu!!

The restaurant has a lovely ambience in terms of interior decor and the spread is quite good. From Indian to Chinese, they have a very decent spread. Worth a mention were the starters and the Chinese non veg dishes. Desserts were okay and nothing extraordinary. Mango moose and brownies are worth a mention. The staff were quick and prompt at their service. Value for money.
