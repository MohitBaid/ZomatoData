Why you guys even open your cafe? The worst service I've seen in my life...local dhabas are better than you guys...the hookah is really bad...no coal change avaliable. ..food quality is well i think your chefs cooks food blindfolded. Made a very bad decision that day to go to munch. My advice to Munch is close your cafe and open a Tea and Coffee stall ....oh wait that won't run too bcoz your coffees are horrible well you guys should just wrap it up and return to your mama

Worst Place ever... Worst service.. Delivery we got after 25-30 minutes after ordering.. Coal changing of Hukkah is not available.. First of my entire life I heard in a hookah parlour that coal changing isn't available.. Well!! Too spicy food.. Didn't got the actual taste.. Quality of food is low but price of food is too high... They serves food after 25-30 minutes.. But give us bill after 2 minutes of approach.. Behaviour and Connection which they should do with customers are not well at all... Overall 1* is the lowest margin that's why they earn it.. Else I want to give 0.1* for its decoration..  Nothing else... Don't spoil time and money to visit this ultra pathetic place

Probably 0.1 rating for the worst resturant experience of my entire life... Worst food quality and more than worst quality of service.. we took hookah and when we ask to change the coal they said coal changing is not available. They said alcohol in not available but infront of us they are carrying vast amount of drinks.. No available attached food.. They can serve Drums of Heaven without its main attachment "garlic sauce".. Even every order we got more than 30 minutes later... such a bull shit place.. just waste of time and money.. and most funny part is they didnt change hookah coal.. only one coal is available for one hookah... just worst experience  of us... dont go...

Just another place which is conveniently located in City Mall. 
However, I really do not find the price tags of the food here to be just.
Neither does it serve exemplary service.
Overall, a pathetic experience.
Since 1 is the lowest rating here, I have added 0.5 to it for the location only!

One of the worst food courts in Barasat. That too at a high price. Please beware of this place and even if you are really really hungry , try something outside. But not here!

This place is a total mess.Goofy staffs ,overpriced foods and drinks,uncomfortable environment and so on..
A bottle of tuborg costs you 220/230 + tax!! are you serious!! There's nothing special about this place for which they charge this much! I wouldn't even call it a decent place to hangout even if i exclude 'overpriced' part.

Jaya cinema hall is just above this place so it's a very good place to hangout after a movie with friends or family. Affordable. Nice ambience.

We have ordered club chicken sandwich.. when the sandwich came that was horribly tasted.. moreover the person sitting in the payment counter was not even well behaved.. we have enquired about the other foods while paying the bill but he dont even bothered to answer it and goes on doing his own stuffs.. when we again repeated our question then he started showing his arrogance.. worst food and worst staff.. that was our very first and last visit..

Went to munch.Ordered Chicken pakora (6 pieces,209/-).Nice decoration.Not so lit up.Avarage stuffs.Finally got the food.Guys the pakoras were not even worth of 109/-.A huge waste of money.At the end of the day you go to a resturent for the food,not for it's outlook.Food quality,quantity and the balance of these two comes first.Everything else comes next.Overall i expected more.
