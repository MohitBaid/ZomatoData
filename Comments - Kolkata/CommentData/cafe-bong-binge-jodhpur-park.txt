Well, on Zomato, this place looked really promising. What could one possibly want more than food, games, and a place to sit and talk?
Well, clearly, punctuality.
Because today I went all the way to this place, at 2.30 whereas the opening time was 2. The place was closed. A man also came and stood at the same place at the same time, and informed us that it will be open in 5 mins, we have to wait a bit.
25mins later, through the drizzle we kept standing outside. I asked again about how much more time it will take. He replied, with a slight non-chalance that the person getting the keys were almost there, he's around South City (this place is bang opposite though).
5 mins later, the man had still not come. We left, disappointed.
Firstly, everyone eats lunch at 1-2, so what's the point of opening a place at 2, with obviously no prep done beforehand?
Secondly, what's the point of making someone wait for around 30 mins? Could have just been honest about the time it would take.
With Blue Mug just minutes away, you can easily give this one a miss.

It's a nice place for hangout. The ambience is little different. Pocket friendly n they serve good food. I ordered non veg platter n I must say egg devil n chicken nuggets were very good but the chicken wings were bit undercooked n the cafe frappe needs some coffee powder otherwise everything is nice.

Definitely a hidden gem! Small, cozy with pool table. Nice place to arrange small parties. They have quite tasty finger foods and a lot of options in tea and coffee, both hot and cold. It is not a fancy place, but has a warmth to its service and menu. Do try this place hidden in the bylanes of Jodhpur Park. Good food and good conversation with friends are guaranteed!

It's almost out of sight if you didn't know the place. Nice place with games like Pool, fuzboll and there are books if someone like to read. There is a large enough TV so anyone can watch sports while enjoying coffee. 
The best part was almost all the items that are on the menu was available.
Th worst is probably the pet dog constantly barking.
Overall it is a nice experience.

A bit hard to locate from the main road (Prince Anwar Shah Road, opposite South City Mall). A beautiful cafe with games like Pool, books etc. It offers food, beverages & drinks at moderately reasonable prices. We went there on Ashtami Evening to spend some quality time together. It was empty. We ordered Arrabiatta Sauce Pasta with Chicken add on & Kitkat Shake. Along with we thought we would order some exclusive dishes like Jalebi with Rabri & Churmur. But we were told these were not available. 
1. Arrabiatta Sauce Pasta was tasty but the chicken was very minsed and was not being felt in tongue. So, it will be a suggestion from my side not to minse the chicken so finely. In stead use Chicken Keema. It would taste better I feel.
2. KitKat Shake- the presentation was good but the taste was not upto the expectations. KitKat & everything others were given into mixer grinder. It will taste better if it is crushed by hand and given on the top of the shake. 
Otherwise everything others were good.

Went there seeing the good reviews on zomato but got highly disappointed. 
Firstly the entrance.. you have to cross some drainage water and have to enter through a really narrow gate. 
Secondly the ambience..  nowhere near comfy and cozy. It was full of mosquitoes.  I felt like we were sitting in some relative's house and not in some cafe.
Now coming to the food.  We ordered kosha mangsher pizza,  egg devil and iced tea (lemon). 
Pizza and the egg devil was okayish,  taste wise like any other homemade pizza and egg devil. The iced tea was nothing but an sugar syrup. 
Though the price was on the lower side but overall they have to improve a lot.

The cafe is a little tricky to locate but once you find it,u'll see its not inconvenient to reach. It was absolutely empty on our arrival and remained so till we had almost finished eating. We ordered chocolate frappe and Oreo shake initially, both of which were so-so. They had large chunks of ice at the bottom which gives the impression that they are filling the jars with the drinks only partially. Also nearing finishing your drink,it becomes all watery due to those huge ice chunks which is really not nice. 
Coming to the food part, we ordered kosha mangsher pizza hoping for something innovative, only to be badly disappointed. Though the pizza was large enough for two,it was ill-topped,had hardly much of mangsher piece and it didn't taste like kosha mangsho at all. I would have rated this place 2.5,but only because of the quaintness of the place and the privacy I will recommend to give it a go. Go for a long chat in this place.

Cafe bong binge is a bengali themed cafe in the heart of jodhpur park. This has been made out in a small ground floor of a house. The location of this place is very tricky due to the fact that it is inside a small lane & could easily be missed if you don't use google maps. The landmark to find this place would the UCO bank ATM.

The place has just a single room of sitting with capacity of around 10 covers. They have a pool table & also foosball table if you are looking for entertainment. The place is fully air conditioned. Decor wise the place was neat & clean with utmost simplicity. Since we weren't too keen to have heavy food, we only settled for some drinks. We had the following:-

1. Choco Hazelnut - A cup of hot chocolate was presented in an obtuse shaped cup which was certainly interesting. The chocolate drink was decent. The hint of hazelnut was however missing but still liked the drink.

2. Cafe frappe - Cold mixture of coffee & vanilla. The drink was okayish but the vanilla proportion of vanilla was a tad too much which kind of ruined the balance of the frappe. It was too much of vanilla ice cream for my liking.

The place is pocket friendly & service was decent. They accept both cash & paytm. They don't charge extra GST,however they do charge 7% service charge. Will comeback to try their food next time!!

Locating this cafe is pretty tricky , situated close to the UCO bank branch you will find this cosy little place with a big pool table and a Foosball table. We ordered chicken wings and Jamaican beats. I have tasted better chicken wings at other places , this was pretty okayish. The sandwich though was pretty nice . The stuff is friendly . And they don't charge GST till now, they just charge 6% service charge. The place is pretty amazing , do visit. :)

Visited this place today evening to spend some time with bae..

Location:- This place is very near to south city mall.. just take the line beside leatherland and turning left and then right u will get to ur destination..

Ambience :- The entrance may not be very fancy.. situated under a building beside kali mandir.. but once u enter u will find it nice and cozy.. not much space to seat though.. may be 20 people max..With a pool board at the entrance..

Food :# The best part starts here..
1) virgin mojito :- 5/5 this drink is so refreshing.. It was really humid outside.. and this was a great relief.. frankly speaking..

2) barbeque chicken pizza.. :-5/5 one of the best thin crust pizza I have had in town.. With good amount of chese..smoked barbequed chicken toppings.. and veggies..

3) Meat lovers sandwich :- 10/5 this was a showstealer.. loaded with meats.. bacon.. ham.. chicken... oozing with cheese.. This was a heavenly to our tastebud

Overall u can bookmark this Place and have a nice evening..
Recommended :- all the dishes above..😅😅

The don't charge GST. . Only 7% serve charge..

Few days back we visited this place situated in Jodhpur gardens area. You have to take the lane beside the Leder land shop opposite to South city mall. Its few minutes walking from main road and situated in the ground floor of a residential building. A small cafe with a sitting area of 20people at max with a congested sitting arrangement. But we were lucky that it was almost empty that day so we had a cozy experience.
Coming to the food-we ordered initially virgin mojito and green apple soda- very refreshing and properly made coolers. Then we had crispy chilly babycorn-crispy juicy and tossed in a red garlic sauce, cheese poppers-it disappointed us as the amount of cheese was very less and chicken wings- loved this dish. 4pieces of chicken wings deeply fried in a batter with bread crumbs served with mayonese and sauce. 
Then we ordered one of their signature dishes-kosha mangsher pizza-just awesome, thin crust pizza with a topping of mutton kosha-very unique and tasty. We also had jamaican beats sandwich and penne pasta in white sauce. These also tasted nice and prepared with loads of mayonese and cheese.
They also offer you indoor games like pool, fifa etc but with extra charges. The best part is the price of the foods with no extra taxes like gst. So guys give this cafe a chance to serve you this weekend.

Cozy place to chill. Delicious food which comes in affordable prices. The only thing they need to improve is that they should take a little less time to prepare the orders. We had to wait approximately 45-50mins to get our order served(1plate chicken wings and a choco frappe) that too when there's none in the café other than us.

I have been hunting cafeterias for a long time now.Sometimes I give a review sometimes due to dearth of time I cannot.i sa the existance of this cafe in my student's FB page who is also a Zomato reviewer.Me and my husband reached there following google Map.The place is real tricky not only to find out but also to enter.I am not sure why is the entrance so very clumsy?We reached the cafe at about 2.45pm - 3pm.It had only one server, the owner and a lady cleaning the cafe.Due to the cleaning process there was a stingy smell present inside.The behaviour of the staff and the owner is very cordial.A young man of 20s may be running the cafe is worth applauding.The decor is clumsy as far as my aesthetics go.On one wall I found Tagore another wall had a 32" TV , another wall has a bookshelf , some pictures of kolkata.The wall paper the decor seemed incomplete and very ordinary to me,

The food I tried was Darjeeling tea which came in a cup and dinner plate made of black ceramic(that was good) , completely uncordinated.I asked black tea so it was jet black with no flavour of Darjeeling tea whatsoever.My husband had lemon Iced Tea served in a masonjar(which was ok) and it tasted good.We had a plate of chicken nuggets which made me remember Mc Cann Nuggets.

My view is- its a cosy place where you can hang on with your dear one lovedly providede there is no one at the pool table and other game amenities.Its a small place,despite its imperfections , if modelled a little bit can have a bright future.

This place is just near South city. When I first visited the place, it didn't look like a cafe from outside but then I entered I must tell you it gave me an amazing homely, cozy feeling. It is like I'm sitting at someone's living room. There is a TV in front of the sofa we were sitting and we could change the channel as per our taste. 
The place is small for sure but it has a separate section for pool, fifa, and many indoor games. And that makes youngsters to spend more time here. 
Coming to the food, 
We had 
Kit kat shake, chocolate frappe, frappe, bbq chicken pizza, margarita pizza. The food was great. Tastes amazing and was in a proper quantity. 
The prices are very affordable and inclusive of taxes 

I will recommend you to at least visit once and give this cafe a try. You'll  not regret.

I came to know about this place recently through Zomato and by going through the reviews and menu I just couldn't resist myself from visiting this place.

This cafe is like a hidden gem located in the bylanes of Jodhpur Park (more accurately I can say in the. Jodhpur Garden)... It is nearby South City Mall...few mins walking distance from the Lane beside leather land shop.

Ambience is small... Cozy... With hardly 15-20 sitting arrangements.

Owner was very much cooperative and service is prompt I can say.

I tried Creamy Cheese Pasta and Brownie Shake from this cafe.

Creamy Cheese Pasta was very tasty with lots of mayo and creams in it.

Brownie Shake was very refreshing and one of the best I can say.

Pool table was there near the entrance.

Pocket pinch is not at all high...and worth the money whatever I have eaten from this place.

Highly Recommendable ❤

Would love to visit more often to try out there other items as well.

Way to go Cafe Bong Binge 😃

Cafe Bong Binge is a newly opened cafe located at Jodhpur Park . It mainly serves Continental & fast food.

Ambience & Decor - Cool ambience , cosy decor with live sports screening , game zone of pool and hand football, which is real fun. It's a small place which can accommodate around 15-20 people.

Staffs & Service - Polite staffs with good service.

We Panchphoron team went on a food tasting session and had the following -

Refreshments -

1)Virjin mojito – A Mojito without alcohol is called a "Virgin Mojito" and made with  Mint, lime juice and sugar syrup mixed with soda. A very cooling & refreshing drink.

2)Mango smoothie – Thick , smooth and creamy and was refreshing and healthy.

3)Chocolate smoothie – It was creamy, smooth & thick and had vanilla ,almond , milk,with chocolate sauce & chocolates.It was enjoyable and healthy.

Food -

1)Fully loaded nachos – Garnished with grated cheese and coriander leaves and was served with a home made dip, it was crunchy and nice. The dip was also savoury.

2)Chicken wings – buttermilk marinated chicken wings deep fried, it was crispy outside and soft inside and was lipsmacking.

3)Kosha mangsher pizza – an unique item and the signature dish of Cafe Bong Binge, thin crust pizza with veggies, cheese and small pieces of mutton, served with chili flakes and crushed dried oregano. It was awesome and is highly recommended.

4)Grilled bacon burger – A barbecue sauce-glazed juicy triangular shaped burger with crisp grilled bacon, grilled onions, and cheddar cheese and was served with french fries and tomato ketchup. It was fingerlicking.

Dessert -

DIY sundae –This sundae was heavenly and consisted of  vanilla ice cream , crushed Oreo biscuits, Kitkat, crushed waffles with chocolate sauce. It was equally well presented.

Pocket pinch is reasonable along with sufficient quantity.

So come here with your friends and enjoy.....

Thanks to the management for their hospitality.

Great food, great service and good atmosphere. This gem is a hidden away off of the Main St. busyness. Located in Jodhpur Park, very near to South City Mall. A word of caution, if you are looking for genuine Continental, this may not be for you. This is Americanized Asian fusion.

However, it is important to note that what I did get was very tasty, inventive and the portions were large and filling. We needed a box to take it home. The atmosphere was beautiful and the service friendly and attentive. It’s a small and cosy cafe with a pool table at the entrance. They have live sports screening with option of PS4 and also have a foosball setup. The dining area is very small with only few tables, but gives a homely feeling.

Our visit to the establishment was on a Sunday early evening so it was quiet upon arrival, and starting to fill up somewhat before we left.

Located in Jodhpur Park, very near to South City Mall. 

Ambience - The decor is pretty cool. Seating arrangement is less. It can accommodate maximum 15-20 people. Plays good music. Irrespective of all these, this cafe is very lively. You'll feel like home Since the owners interact one to one. It has game zone of Pool and Hand Football. You can have lot of fun there. 😍

Food - Had Kitkat Shake, Cold Coffee, Chocolate Frappe, Barbeque Pizza and Margarita Pizza. All of them were great. Be it quality or quantity. ❤

Service - The people there were so courteous and good. Would have rated 5 but 0.5 is deducted because the service time is slow. 🙎

However, it's worth the wait. So guys visit this place soon. 😍❤

The place is difficult to locate. However it is very cozy and there are games to entertain one's  self eg. PS4 games, pool table . Adorable point : the cafe has a cute dog you can play with (suggestion is to ask for permission first.)

The items we ordered were Arrabiata pasta , French fries and ice tea.  It was pocket friendly. However the French fries were too oily but the pasta was amazing.  All in all it was a good experience.

Firstly I wanna say don't use google map for going this place.  It is situated just beside the Jodhpur Lake Club (The lane beside UCO Bank).  A good place. We have visited just about a day ago.  We have tried Jamaican beats Fresh Lime Soda Blue Lagoon And Chicken Wings.  Nice ambience. You can play pool or football(charges applicable)  50/- for 30 mins..

People dont fall into the trap of their offers. I went with one of my friends. We haven't even sat on the table the guy came and told us about their 349 bucks ka Unlimited Pizza with coke offer.
That was the worst decision of my life. I agreed & they said that it was prepaid. When I went to pay they said all the terms and conditions.
1. You can't share.
And already the bill was done & printed.
So I had to pay 748 bucks for thin crust worst quality pizza and hot coke.

I decided to go here after coming across good reviews on Zomato. Its a newly opened small cafe, so I decided to call up Cafe Bong Binge before going there. When I called them they said that instead of opening at 1pm (time of opening as mentioned by Zomato) they will be opening at 2pm. I reached there around 2pm but the cafe still have not opened. I decided to wait for sometime. But even after waiting for long 40 mintues they did not open the cafe atall! 

Why run a cafe with such unprofessionalism? And when people are even calling you up why don't you just tell them the exact time of opening the cafe? 


Such a bad experience!

Is it so that a cafe is being running by only one person?? Today we visited there after seeing "open" in zomato.... and what did we see? Closed.. why? Because the person is ill... and it will be open on Saturday...If it is so then you should have update it in zomato.... very much unprofessional gesture..

Cafe Bong Binge is located in the interiors of Jodhpur Park below a residential building. It's a small and cosy cafe with a pool table at the entrance. They have live sports screening and also have a foosball setup. The dining area is very small with only 3 tables, but gives a homely feeling.
The food inclusions are quite good. I ordered Chicken Wings which were crisp and juicy served with mayo and ketchup dips. The cheese poppers and Oreo shake are eyecandy and taste really good. 
Inspite of its location being a drawback, the ambience and food will attract many. 
Service staff is less but it won't be a problem if there's less crowd. Food is really good. The ambience is impressive with the sports lounge. Price is also very reasonable. A must visit.

A nice cozy place little interior of jodhpur park boys club.. has a pool table and some others games(charges extra).. this place gives a homely feeling and makes u feel if u also cud own a cafe of ur own.. coming to the food.. ordered the following:
Creamy Cheesy Pasta- The pasta was fresh and cheesy as the name suggests. quiet good.
Lemongrass Magic Mocktail- Tangy lemony and a lil bubblegum flavour to it.
Cafe Frappe- This was the most amazing thing of the evening. Loved this cooler/cold coffee topped with vanilla icecream. Totally yum! 
Oreo Shake- Nice and chocolaty !
Will come back for this surely! <3

A new cafe joint,opened quite a few months back which serves really good food,here you can enjoy delicious food as well as you can play varieties of games.being a big fan of any kind of sports,i was very impressed by the concept.this place is located opposite lane of South City mall which ends in Jodhpore Park,just beside the Jodhpore Park Kalibari.here you will find a pool table,small football table and PS4. ambiance was good,interiors are very well maintained.around 16-21 people can seat and eat together at a time. i was went there with my fellow foodie friends over a food tasting session.we had a great time.
                                                                ...

To start with, the ambience is great !! The poker table, foosball table are the first attractions you will see. Coming to the food , the menu is limited but very well sorted, we ordered cheese chicken popcorns which was good but the jamaican chicken sandwich is a big thumbs up, portions are fair enough and very reasonably priced. A cool place to hang out with your friends, mom dad or a date !! All in all great ! We look forward to coming again :)

This place is very tricky to locate. Located just beside - Jodhpur Kalibari if you ask someone near the South city mall. By reading the review, i visited this cafe on a saturday evening to try some light snacks with a lot of expectation. But experience was average one. Most of the items in menu were not available, hence they suggested me to try fish cutlet. The taste was not good, didnt like the taste of oil it was deep fried. Mojito cooler was satisfactory. The cafe has variety of games with an average decor - no. of seating arrangements in different rooms - though its very clumsy. Rates are reasonable.

This place is a little difficult to find. Located in a small lane near Jodhpur Boys Club opposite to south city mall this cafe is hosted in the drawing room in the ground floor of a house. The decor is minimal and cozy with ample bean bags to chill out. The place doesn't handle a lot of people I guess. Even on a Sunday evening we 3 were the only guest they hosted. The place has a mini pool table, a foosball table and a PS4 with a good number of games to choose from. However everything is chargeable at around Rs. 50 to Rs 75 per person per hour. The menu is decent and provides options from sandwiches, burgers, finger foods and other beverages although few items like the bong connection sandwich and churmur were not available. The food is average, the chicken and the egg sandwich tasted fine. The chicken wings were a little dry and not served in barbecue sauce as the menu said. The place is extremely pocket friendly and a good place for friends to chill out over a game of foosball or PS4 while chomping on munchies.

Want to indulge in some classic french fries alongwith kosha mangsher pizza and prawns wrapped in bacon and bond with people over perhaps, foosball and pool yet feel at home ???

Head into CAFE BONG BINGE tucked in a lane beside Jodhpur Boys Club..

======CAFE BONG BINGE======

A gem of a place co-owned by a lovely lady in her twenties who not only can customize the food according to ur delights but will also give you the friendly neighbourhood feel

===DECOR===
The interiors are kept minimal yet warm with a cozy home like feeling. The sitting is done in red and black. Bean bags are there just to give that much needed vibe especially when you are playing PS4.
YES, the cafe-cum-gameparlour has a PS4 boasting games like FIFA 2k17, NFS, WWE, COD to name a few
Add to that the popular pool and foosball..
The Rabindranath Tagore styled facade provides the bangaliyana factor. Add to that the book rack with subjects ranging from a certain Chetan Bhagat to Dan Brown classics.
There is even a LCD in case u want to see your favourite Kohli cover drive or a certain Ian Hume kick to the fence...👏👏

===FOOD===
There are a lot of options coming to food ranging from finger food like chicken popcorn to bengali snacks like cutlets and kabirajis. The makha muri with chaa is an innovative addition.

I've tried more than 60-70% of their menu over the course of 3 visits

The snacks be it french fries, potato wedges, chicken popcorn, cheese poppers, garlic bread, chicken wings, nachos etc are great to catch on during a game of pool or while sipping hot chocolate.
YES, Hot chocolate...!! A must have in those lazy evenings..
And the quantity is loadsome

Special mention : Their kosha mangsher pizza with sinful amount of mutton in the right places is highly recommended. 👍👍👍

Their sandwiches are full of cheese. Although there are quite a few non-vegetarian options, i've developed a fondness for their cheese and corn wich and also the choco wich with lots of molten chocolate oozing out from every corner.

Their four cheese pasta is creamy and delicious.
Its a must try 👍👍

The bengali dishes are a noteworthy section.
Kabirajis, cutlets, devils, alongwith churmur, fuchka and the innovative MAKHA MURI WITH CHAA are the right companions for those intelligent bengali conversations ranging right from ATK to demonetisation.

The assortment of refreshing drinks is perfect to wash down those fries or pizza. I have a special liking for their Coconut Mojito 👌👌

Prices are very reasonable
Apart from the food, Pool is 100/hour, Foosball is 50/player and PS4 is 75/player.
Given the fun one will have with the delicacies alongside the games, it is quite certain that you will get that warm bong homelike feeling..!!
And its a given, not only will you come out with a smile on ur lips but some new friends as well.

Cafe Bong Binge will be my preferred choice whenever i am in kolkata and want to spend some good time with friends and family over good food and exciting games..!!!

It took a while to find the place but its worth the time. Cozy ambience, nice place for Friends to hangout or dating spot. Food cant say is the best, but doesn't dissappoint (except for the Hot Chocolate, which will likely remind you of early morning Bournvita). I ordered creamy cheese pasta, which was delicious. Recommended for late eve hangouts. 
P. S - They got a pool table and Foosball table too, with extra charges on them

This place  is actually the ground floor of a house. It feels less like a cafe and more like drawing room. This happens to be my new den now. You get access to a tv out there and boredom can be kicked out if the company is boring. It is slightly difficult to locate in case you have not been to the place. The search is going to be worth it. You wouldn't find such cheap dirt place this easily giving you huge quantity along with lip-smacking taste. I have tried their non veg chicken pizza, pasta in red sauce and some crispy chicken out here and it was absolutely fabulous. It is a must visit place. They don't loot you much in the name of tax and give you good service. They have  board games too which is charged extra.

I visited this place last day with a friend. It was very difficult to locate this place and we kept losing our way. The owners were helpful with the directions.
The place is comfortable and casual.

I wanted to have waffles but it was not available.
We ordered for barbeque chicken pizza which was below average. There were small chicken bones in the pizza which should have been removed before hand as one expects boneless chicken on their pizza. The pizza was nothing special just made with barbeque sauce I think.

Overall I think this place has a lot to work on, specially when it comes to food and how to reduce the serving time.

Not at all a standard place for hanging out. The route to the place is very odd. In other words if you don't know the place well enough you won't be even able to find the cafe.
The comes the place decoration is good but the space is very small and tacky. Not at all comfortable.
Food is not even average like the pasta had way too much gravy but yes the taste was good as it contained a lot of cheese.
Lastly the price that is also low. But compared to the food served its kind a oke types.
Just opened cafe won't say too much negative but yes it requires massive change in all the aspects of the cafe.

Slightly difficult to trace this place but a walk around serene Jodhpur Park will definitely take you there. Do not enter the Kalibari though - there is a narrow entrance. Once jnside, there is pool that is chargeable by the hour, and foosball which isn't. For food, we ordered the barbeque chicken pizza as suggested by the nice owner/occasional chef. Also ordered were Choco Frappe (cold)and Chocolate hazelnut coffee (hot), both of which were amazing. A triple decker burger with extra cheese was also ordered which was quite fulfilling. Very very reasonable. There are also books to read!

Very difficult to find, but very satisfying if you finally did find it. 
After several phone calls we reached the place, on a Durga puja evening, which seems to be oddly placed near an alley near south city. 
It has pool, but not a typical dark and shabby place.
The menu is quite promising and the food is equally good.
We had ordered two drinks. One being lemongrass and the other being the classic fresh lime. 
The former  drink is tangy and great. We stayed back to try the burger. Which was enough for two people, filled with a flavourful patty, onion, tomato, loads of mayo accompanied with fries. 
Next, we were recommended to try the chicken cheese balls.  And we just had mouthful of cheese bombs.  They were quite a few In number. The moment you bite into those balls, the cheese oozes out. 
Great good at good price. 
The owner or somebody who looks after the place happens to be a polite lady who is extremely warm. 
A great thumbs up.

This place is located near south city mall and a big board near the café helps find the place pretty easily. Coming to the place, it's interior is very cosy and nice! There are games like Foosball and snooker. The place is really really pocket friendly! What we ordered:
4 cheese pizza
Mix sauce pasta
Veg platter
Non veg platter
Cold coffee
Kitkat shake
We were very satisfied with the food. Four cheese pizza and non veg platter were excellent. Pasta was well cooked and worth the money! The drinks also tasted good! I liked how they served the drinks in pretty jars! :D

We went there for the first time today and the experience was average.. firstly, the location is very tricky.. Its situated opp to poddar park in jodhpur park... When we reached there this evening, there was this big poster but we were confused on where to get in from because the passage was very small ... Now coming to the place.. It is the first floor of a house.. It was cozy and homely inside with good interior and games like pool and table soccer... As we were the only customers we had a good time over there...
Now, coming to the food.. We ordered
1) a hot chocolate
2) a kitkat shake and
3) chicken cheese popcorns..
Well, the hot chocolate was too sweet... So i had to complain about it but the guy was generous enough to change it for me... The 2nd time when he brought it, it was like the before only.. I couldn't make out any difference.. Then also he told me to taste it and also said that if i dnt like it he will change it, which i found pretty good...
Now, the kitkat shake.. it was tasty, well nothing extraordinary... But the chicken cheese popcorn they served had no cheese in it atall... Those were basically the ready made ones which are found in packets... He just fried it.. there was no trace of cheese inside and the popcorns were over fried..
So overall, didnt have a good experience although the staff and the interior was good.. I would prefer this place only for some titbits, adda and playing games with friends over food....

We ordered KitKat shake. It was so delicious we gulped it down. The owner is a nice lady who sat and talked with us for a while. They were playing one of my favorite band Coldplay in the background. You'll love it if you're into pool, Foosball or PS4 games. The interior is nicely done. This place is going to be very popular in the coming days.

My friend had been asking me to visit this place for more than a week now and I regret avoiding it. So today i finally agreed to come. The cafe is not close to the main road, and that's probably the only downside of it. Coffee here is awesome. There's a pool table as well, i just finished 3 game of pool with my friend. Am really stunned to see that this place is empty. How can anyone miss out this place?
We to be honest am glad it was , coz few months from now and i might not get pool table available. 

Even the food here is great. So don't think twice bring your friends and hang out here.. It's a fun place to hang out..

This is awesome and amazing experience visiting cafe Bong Binge .. I particularly like the ambience which is very cozy and comfortable .. Foods are of-course yummy .. Kosha Mangshor Pizza is a must try ..this is very successful innovative concept in Pizza .. The french fries and particularly the dips are even better then some international food chains .. and I loved the grilled classic non veg sandwich .. Everything is brand new and stylish and what a way to serve the Oreo-shake in a cute Jar ..  This cafe is also my new adda with live pool, fussball and my favourite PS games .. I seriously recommend that this place is a must visit .. and you will easily feel compelled for next time to revisit ..

On the lanes opposite South City, this place is truly a hidden gem. The food is absolitely delicious. I can vouch for the 'Kosha Mangshor Pizza' & the 'Classic Non veg Sandwich'. The price is reasonable. 
With pool, foosball and Ps4 this is THE PLACE to hang out with your friends. The friendly owners and the ambience is a plus :-)  Fellow foodies, this is a place you won't regret visiting :-)

Decided to try out this new café. To reach this place take the lane opposite south city, the place is close to Jodhpur Park Boys Club and just beside the Jodhpur Park Kalibari. (or better use google maps)

The cafe is located in a by-lane at Jodhpur park, about five minutes' walk from South City Mall. It can be a little hard to locate at first, but that's hardly a problem if you have your phone's location services on.

The ambiance is casual and friendly, with super comfortable seating arrangements. The book rack, the Coldplay playlist and the Pool and Foosball tables make it a perfect place for a hangout.

We ordered hot chocolate with hazelnuts, cappuccino, fully loaded nachos and garlic bread. The food was remarkably good, but the hot chocolate deserves special mention, because it had a sweet smell of hazelnuts and thankfully did not taste like just Bournvita and milk. The prices are very reasonable as well. 

Overall, it is a cool place and will definitely visit again, especially for the games. And of course the food!

A cafe worth mentioning to your friend. The homely ambiance along with the wonderful treatment from the owners makes this cafe stand out. I have been to several cafes in Calcutta and i can safely say that this is one of the best there is and will be for a long time. the prices are extremely decent. For people who cringe when they think of spending time in CCD (like me) this cafe is the place. The inclusion of foosball and pool is perfect. The quiet environment is perfect for any freelancers who may look for a cafe to sit and work in. Food is pretty good and if you like a bit of strong coffee just tell the owner and they will give you one to your liking. 

All in all a perfect place to chill after a tiring day.

What can be described as an innovative and entertaining cafe version of Oh! Calcutta, Bong Binge is also a modern day version of the Indian Coffee House (albeit without the incomparable heritage, legacy and legend associated with the Coffee House).
Foosball, Pool and PS4 are interesting additions to the establishment which makes the experience at the cafe more involving and this is why Bong Binge stands out from the rest.
The location of the this place is a tough nut to crack for first timers.
The aim of Bangaliyana Fusion has been achieved with the menu the cafe offers. From Kabiraji to French Fries to Triple Layered Burgers (with bacon), from Darjeeling Tea to KitKat shake(a must have), the menu doesn't disappoint and neither does the chef. Cost per person, for food, lies in the range Rs. 200 - Rs. 300, making it affordable for students and professionals alike.

The only area of concern is their service, which is no doubt polite, courteous and customer friendly, but lacks the required man power to cater to all their customers simultaneously.

For all those who seek a home away from home, Bong Binge is an utter delight.

Great food. Good ambience. Value for money. Rarely does one come across a cafe offering good food, live screenings, play station, pool table and foosball at the same time. Went with 3 of my friends. The cafe looked a little small at first. But once you settle in, it gives you the chance to do something that Coffee House once used to be famous for - interacting with strangers. Must haves are the burgers and chocolate smoothie.

This cafe has bong food which is very special for a great Bengali adda and the food quality is very good. The music test of the cafe bong binge is also nice. Its very pocket friendly. Except pure bong adda they have some really good games. This place will be my first choice for spending time in evening at south Kolkata.

To find a café this near to my house is always a blessing in disguise. This newly opened place popped up in Zomato and I decided to give it a go.

While the place was somewhat hard to locate, I reached it fairly easily following maps. 

The ambience is to die for. Casual and informal eateries have always been close to my heart, and this place scores high in that regard. The place is complete with a pool table, a foosball table and a PS4 setup. Moreover, it offers bean bags in addition to regular chairs for seating, which is a nice touch.

Coming to the food, the prices are very reasonable and that's something noticeable. We ordered French fries and a corn sandwich and in beverages, we got a lemon iced tea and a chocolate smoothie. The food was absolutely delightful.

So, to summarize:

Pros:
* Pocket Friendly
* Gaming Setups
* Quick Service

Cons:
* Location can be a little hard to find
* Cellular network issues in the cafe ( which the owners are planning to resolve soon)

 I'd recommend everyone to try this place out. All aces from my end!

Cafe Bong Binge is a newly opened cafe located near South City Mall, in the lanes of Jodhpur Park. The cafe is a bit difficult to locate, and the entrance is a bit shabby, but all of those things pale in comparison to the quality of food and the ambience of the place. On my first visit, I was surprised to see a PS4 gaming console, a Foosball table, a pool table, and a seating area for 20 people, packed into such a small space. The owner has utilised the space in a wonderful manner, and as a result, although the cafe is small, nothing seems cramped. Coming to the ambience, the lighting is perfect for a cafe, and the speakers are top notch.

 Now coming to the food. On my first visit, I ordered a Crispy Chicken Burger, a Fully Loaded Nachos, and a Corn Fantasy Sandwich. The Crispy Chicken Burger was extremely tasty. The crispy chicken patty was delectable, and the sauces used were perfect. Now some people like cucumbers and onions in their burgers, but I absolutely hate them. So I informed the owner about this, and he said that from next time onward, he'll ask customers before putting cucumbers and onions in their burgers. The Fully Loaded Nachos was absolutely amazing. The salsa dip was one of the best I've ever had. Now coming to the Corn Fantasy Sandwich. One of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Perfectly grilled with cheese oozing out, it was the perfect sandwich and I could not have enough. On my second visit I tried the Triple Decker Burger and the Oreo Shake. True to his word, the owner asked me whether I wanted cucumbers and onions in my burger, and I vehemently said no. The burger was absolutely delicious. A crispy chicken patty with ham and bacon, you just can't go wrong with that combination. But I felt that the burger was lacking a bit of a punch, so I told the owner to put some jalapenos or pickles the next time. The Ore Shake was absolutely delicious. No complaints about that. I also played Foosball, which is chargeable at 50 bucks for 20 mins. That's quite cheap considering the rates in all the other cafes. 

So coming to the pros; cheap good quality food, perfect ambience to hang out,  multiple things to do besides eating, owner attentively listening to your suggestions and actually implementing them. The cons; bit difficult to locate, some items on the menu aren't available all the time, some kinks need to be ironed out with respect to food.

All in all, this is a perfect place to hang out with your friends, eat good food and not burn a hole in your pocket. Will I visit again? Definitely. Will I recommend this place to a friend? Definitely. Visit Cafe Bong Binge. You won't be disappointed.

I heard about this place which has recently opened from a friend. Yesterday, I went there. To my surprise, it's one of the better Cafés I've been to. The ambience is casual yet energetic with soft music playing in the background. The food is surprising delicious at an extremely reasonable price.
I had ordered a Triple Decker Burger, which was reasonably tasty. The Oreo shake was tremendous. I loved it. They serve the milkshakes in jars, which is something I've not seen before. Overall, I was satisfied with the food given the reasonable price.
Coming to the entertainment oomph of the Cafe, it's a great place to hang out. There's a Foosball Table, a Pool Table, and a PS4. The prices are the best in town, and I had a fantastic time.
The owner is a young fellow. He's very amicable, and you will be at home here.
One minor flaw I found is that the food took a bit of time to arrive, but that's understandable given the place has just opened. And it's better that way, for you can try out the games they are offering in the meanwhile.

Bottom line, if you're looking for a comfortable place to hang out with your friends without leaving a big hole in your pocket, try this place out. You'll be surprised with what it has to offer.

This cafe is located in the lanes of Jodhpur Park, opposite to South City. The best thing about it is the relaxed atmosphere it exudes, perfect for a evening spent catching up with friends. We ordered Garlic Bread, Cappuccino, Chocolate Hazelnut and Fully Loaded Nachos. The salsa dip for the nachos was tangy ( with a generous helping of cheese 😄). Cocoa hazelnut was pretty good. I particularly loved the garlic bread. It's the best Garlic bread, I've had till date. Will surely go back to try the other items on the menu, especially the pizzas!

Visited this place just yesterday on hearing about it from a friend. Located at a very comfortable distance from south city, this place gives a really friendly and at ease atmosphere with the awesome music and really cool hosts. We ordered platters, a veggie delight sandwich and a few drinks. I loved the oreo shake, a must try for everyone. Opening only a couple days back, this place sure would win hearts of all with a really different combination of food and really affordable prices. Also they have games like the pool table and the ps4 and an awesome collection of books. Perfect for hangouts and get togethers.! :)

Visited this place on Sasthi with a group of 5 others. The cafe was a homely place. We ordered the Veg and Non-Veg platters, Veggie Delight and Fully Loaded Nachos. The chicken cheese popcorn, the cheese poppers and the dips were great specially the salsa dip for the Nachos. We ordered Chocolate Frappe, Cafe Frappe, Kitkat and Oreo Shakes to go with our food. They were delicious! The cafe also has a section called "Ghore Baire" which features some of the most popular Bengali snacks. Can't wait to come back and try out the "Kosha Mangsher Pizza".
The ambience is nice! The cafe has a pool table, a Foosball table, and a PS4, with games like WWE , Call of Duty, FIFA 17, GTA 5. The reception was warm, friendly. Music was good, with so many of Colplay tracks in the background was soothing.
RATING:
Ambience: 4.5
Food: 4
Facilities: 5
Service: 4.5
Price: way within budget (rating could get confusing)
Overall: 5
Will definitely come back again, more than once!

Delicious food at extremely affordable prices? Check. How about spending the evening voraciously reading an unputdownable collection of stories and novels? Check. How about earning yourself some bragging rights by defeating your friends in WWE 2k16, FIFA 17 or NFS or merely chilling out playing Call of Duty, GTA V , Watchdogs ,etc.  you just name them & they have ‘em .For the exponentially growing no. of FRIENDS fans out here in Kolkata , yes you can play foosball there !Or maybe you could simply show off your swag by playing pool. It’s a cafeteria……It’s a library…. It’s a gaming parlor…. It’s Café Bong Binge! Once you are inside the café, you never feel like leaving & even if you do, you plan on coming back as soon as possible! Result? Visited the café twice in 3 days (my house is 21 kms away). This place is one of those rare hidden treasures at Jodhpur Park, waiting to be unearthed. So what are you waiting for? All you foodies, avid readers, gaming fanatics rush to Café Bong Binge to have an awesome time in this warm cozy café which btw has an amazing playlist.

Located at a 2 minutes walk distance from South City mall, this cafe is a hidden gem and the perfect place for foodies. It does not drill a hole in your pocket. The decor and lighting make you feel at home. I visited this place with friends on Sasthi evening and we ordered for platters, desserts and a few drinks. The food was absolutely delicious, specially the cheese poppers and chicken popcorn which were delectable. The Kit Kat shake and Oreo shake are a must try. This is the best place for people who have a sweet tooth and love to experiment with their desserts. They have DIY desserts! The Belgian waffles are to die for. You can also play a game of pool and foosball here at an extremely reasonable price. We had a great time here and we'll definitely visit the cafe again during this puja! 
The main highlights were the warm hospitality, service with a smile and mouth watering dishes. 
Overall excellent value for money, delicious food and very courteous service. The music here is the cherry on the top!

It's such a cozy place to chill out with your friends!I absolutely loved the ambience.It's warm,aesthetic and feels like home.The food here is excellent and comes at very affordable prices.I had blueberry pancakes and an Oreo Shake.The Oreo Shake was soooo amazing *_* 
Being a F.R.I.E.N.D.S fan I had always wanted to try my hand at Foosball but never really got to because all the other places charge a huge amount.Here they charge Rs.50/head which I think is pretty reasonable.
Can't wait to go back! :)

Amazing place with several mouth-watering dishes served without long wait times. The PS4 serves as a cool addition for casual gamers, and most importantly doesn't burn a hole in the pocket. The crowd is fantastic, and the lightly themed interiors along with a good playlist makes this a perfect place for small get-togethers!

This is a MUST GO place for anyone looking for a good time and one that's easy on the pocket as well. These people have Pool, Fussball and PS4 (yes, that's WWE, Call of Duty, GTA 5 and FIFA 17 on Playstation *_*) To go with all of that they have amazing food for such low prices.
