Ambiance (3.5/5): The place is well known to people who are regular to, or often visit the College Street area. The outlet is more of a shop selling flavored beverages. It is not very spacious and sparsely decorated, but yet is comfortable and a nice place to hangout with mates while sipping on cool, refreshing drinks.

Service/Quality (4.5/5): There isn't anything ornamental about this place, and the staff just come over, take the orders and then shout out the orders to the people in the back. Once ready, the drinks are served at their respective table.¬†Whether it is a hot summer afternoon or a mildly cold evening during winter, the drinks served here are always a delight. It is more about the pleasure than the quality.

Revisit/Recommend (4.5/5): The outlet has been open for a long time, but is still on the top of it's game. Over the years, I have been to this place numerous times with both friends and family, and have never left disappointed or dissatisfied. It is definitely recommended to everyone for a fairly good time.

This is one of my favourite places for beverage..!I just loved the sarbats over here.. though I don't like passionfruit that much..but the passionfruit 
Sarbar comes with ravri on the top of it..& that's really good.. without this I have tried the cocoa malai..(the best one) & mango mania & the dub sarbat (one of my favourite sarbats over here) also.. it's really a thumbs up for paramount form my end..üëçüòâ

This is one of the heritage places around college street. The area is small but they serve really good shorbots. My personal favourite is the daab shorbot and kesar malai. I don't like their syrups though. Prices have been drastically increased over the last two years but the quality remains the same.

This place holds it own history in the town. It has served many known - freedom fighters, poets, writers and politicians. This place will give you, nostalgic vibes Everytime you visit here. It has a huge history, with plenty of eminent personalities having visited that shop.

The place is cosy, serving a variety of Sherbats (both Lassi based and Syrup based).
You can also buy bottles of flavoured Syrup for consumption back home.
However, it is too congested, not ideal for big groups. :)

 I was up for my semester book at college Street and I just took a look. Since it was the nearest chill/ relax option known for drinks. But honestly the sarbat syrup was okay okay types.

Just when I am wandering at College Street buying my favorite law books and story books and I need to quench my thirst, this is the place to be for some absolutely wonderful and delicious sharbats. my favorite one is the Daab Sharbat. Quite cheap and perfect in taste. This is a legendary place where many noble men stepped their feet. This place is not air conditioned yet you will always find queue and sometimes you really have to wait for a long time to get your seat.

Paramount enunciates nostalgia. The place is perhaps even older than Morgan Freeman (poor joke,¬†I know) and is associated with the sentiments of old Kolkata.I had visited it a few months back with a group of friends. The place isn't big, but hey, isn't that natural for such an old "restaurant"? We ordered a glass each of Cream Rose and Cream Lemon and two glasses of Vanilla Malai. They tasted pretty well. The hygiene of the place is fine, as well.¬† Besides, the service was good too.I will be glad to visit it again and try some other juices and coolants.

Service: prompt
Ambience: like a very small cabin-restro of old kolkata,like we see in old Bengali movies.
Cost: Reasonable.

What we ordered: Coco malai (tall glass.Can give the chocolate milkshakes of caf√©s,a run for their money.
It was topped with raabri and kaaju!!
 4.9/5) rs100

Daab sherbet (tall glass.most famous, delicious, topped with daab er shansh! but I found myself fawning over the other two 4/5) rs 50

Cream vanilla (medium sized glass,curd based,creamy, delicious and a little tangy,4.8/5
Topped with cream) rs 100

Perfect spot for that post-book shopping adda on a summer afternoon.It stays crowded on that time so we just went on a winter noon.
Will revisit.

It was very difficult for me to choose one from the variety of sherbats . I went with my friends this place.Few of them ordered kesar malai .Since I am fond of lassi ,so I preferred to try one variety of lassi. Cream green mango drew my attention and ordered it. A big smile came to my face after the first sip . I had tried lassi in many places bt this one was my best experience . Kesar malai was also good but not as good as cream green mango . I want to visit this place again and explore the other flavours also..

Paramount screams of heritage and nostalgia. And this is enough to satisfy the price they charge for their sherbets.
And satisfied myself with their daab malai one and the mango one! 
Extremely refreshing after a tough hour of maths tutions and book-hogging in and around College Street. ‚úåüèª

Will definitely go back for more experiences.

This is one of the heritage part of kolkata.The malai of paramount is mouthwatering.As it is situated amongst the college and university and also at the heart of kolkata People are use to visit the shop . The dub sarbat is famous in this shop. But I can say that if anyone doesn't like rose syrup it's good to avoid the dub sarbat. otherwise Cold coffee is awesome..You cannot feel that it's cold coffee it's like malai.The photos I have given that were Coco malai.This is so delicious.The quantity is very good .

Heard alot about this place since last year . I was around this area for a seminar and luckily got to spot this place . The sitting areas were occupied almost and had to sit down two stranger ladies who was having great gossiping till then üòÇ . The place is quite small and has no air conditioning ( I wish not to visit here during summer ) . There was huge chart for the sherbet and syrups they offer and I could only afford daab Malai sherbet for the time . Lol , I was literally broke at the end of the month . The sherbet costed me 50 bucks and the quantity served was just fine . I guess 50 bucks is bit more for the quantity they served . Honestly , I could enjoy an entire Malai daab at the end of the street at half the price . I could spot a iceberg in the glass with 1/4th of the malai in the glass . The sherbet was abit more sweet than normal daab'r jol . Will come back later to try other variants and hoping not to be disheartened then .

Thirsty after standing at the long queue at college square pujo pandal or after walking up and down college street searching for books or just looking for something to beat the heat after college classes? Then this traditional place is the perfect to quench your thirst with their chillers! It doesn't boast of the footfall of eminent personalities for nothing! 
Even though I've tried their sharbats like green mango,lemon sharbat(too sweet for me because I was looking for the tang) etc, my forever favourite continues to be the dab sharbat and there's nothing like it! I've found all their sharbats that I tasted to be on the sweeter side which however is not preferable always.
If you want to take the sharbat home, they will provide a sturdy bottle for that at a minimal price.
PS my review might sound like an ad but it is not because I precisely described the situations when Paramount had saved me from exhaustion!
Must visit if you are into old traditional places and kolkata foodies shouldn't miss this!

Nothing less than a full score to this historical place.. Nothing n nowhere can beat this juicy destination for the best coolers n refreshers.. This is one place that has never compromised on quality n taste over the decades.. The place reeks with history and u feel a strange thrill of sitting right where our freedom fighters shared a cooling drink over their plots n plans.. Im glad they did nothing to change the look or feel of this heritage hot spot.. I have made numerous visits and have never found this place empty.. But thankfully the wait is never too long since people finish their drinks n get moving.. Their daab shorbot is out of this world n its nothing like u have ever tasted.. I have tried their tamarind syrup n its a tease for the tastebuds.. Leaves u wanting more... Nothing less than 5 for this place...

It's nothing fancy compared to the big names that have come to the play serving milkshakes in the air condioned places by smartly dressed people. But it's pure heritage and nostalgia which makes people go to this place. Tucked in a bylane of College Street boi para, Paramount serve the most delicious milkshakes in Kolkats. My personal favorite are the Rose Malai, Cocoa Malai, Daab Sharbat and the Vanilla malai. The taste is the same as was 10 years back during my college days when I visited atleast thrice a week. Only with time the prices have gone up (which is worth it) and some new items have been added. Everything else has remained same.

There are few places left in the city, which will help you explore 'Calcutta', a city which grew with passion and love for aesthetics. Paramount, with its rich neighbourhood of the legendary 'boipara', the educational hubs and the populace who are lovers of art and recluse living is a true testimony to 'simple living & high thinking'. Once you step inside this age old place, you will realize beverages made of passion do not require advertising to attract people from far across the city and beyond. The show stealer - Daber sherbat and other juices are 100% unadulterated. The ambience is quiet with a silent homage to distinguished people who visited Paramount in its 100 year long journey!

Gliding past the busy alleys with smell of books,old and new,will you find this beautiful heaven on earth place.
A pretty humble place with marble table tops,deer torsos on the wall and framed photographs will give you the nostalgic feel that one demands while trading North Calcutta.
It's been standing there heads high for 99 years straight now and is a must drop place if you're in the locality.
If you're one of those avid foodies and do not care much about gastroenteritis,then you can give a quick peek at Kalika(For chops) and then head off to quench your thirst as well as to pacify the chillies.
I've been there twice.
On my first occasion,my acquaintances suggested me to dry the "Daab Sherbet" that happens to be the popular serving here.Honestly,that quite didn't catalyse my good feelings for this place.
So,I went back a few days later with a different set of people and I ordered two drinks namely "Passion Fruits" and "Kesar Malai"!
Ah!My tummy monster was satisfied!

I tried their mango mania and lemon syrup. The former was a great drink wid a lovely flavour of mango and some rabri spread on top of it. The lemon syrup was also good to taste. Looking forward to visiting again some time to try out their daab sherbat.

A perfect place for varieties of sherbets and syrups. One of the oldest places in Kolkata which has witnessed footfall of various bengali legends. 
Located amidst the hustle bustle of busy alleys in college Street, this place is located opposite to college square. Sometimes it's very difficult to manage a place to seat. 
If you expect a modern comfortable decor, this is not the one. Paramount is a typical north Kolkata  old place with wooden benches. Their flagship products are coco malai, daab sherbet, mango mania etc.
A must try if you want to explore real Kolkata !

Best place to chill for introverts or people having limited friends. And a cozy and comfortable place. The place remains cool even if hot and humid outside. Plus the pictures of the eminent people makes the place more exciting.Only place in College street where you can chill over a glass of sherbats and relax. So I went there with my friends after a tiresome day at the university and we ordered Strawberry Syrup,Lemon Syrup and Lassi. 
The Lemon Syrup: It was the best of the lot honestly. The heavenly feeling after it was flowing down my food pipe. Pure bliss. 

Strawberry Syrup: Sweeeeeeeeet. Yep. Exactly. Extra sweet. But anyway nice. 

Lassi: Idk how it was but my friend said that was awesome. 
So overall the experience was quite relaxing,cool and positive. Keep it up üòç

Amazing. Special being the Daab Sarbat, the photo of which has been added was really amazing and soothing. All the drinks are really refreshing. The Green Mango Cream and Mango Malai were good but the Daab Sarbat steals the show. They also have the syrup bottles which you can buy and bring home but it won't have the same taste as it would be if they  would prepare it for you. So it's the best to go there and grab your favourite Sarbat :) Very Very pocket friendly ;)

An authentic place in kolkata for having a softdrink/sarbat after a so long busy schedule. It is located near college sq. The price is a bit high but worth it. It is mostly crowded in afternoon. The sarbats are too good to explain. If you are in kolkata you must come at paramount.

Great place to experience old Calcutta nostalgia. ts non ac. The staff is also okayish but you will not regret it here.. Thanks to the awesome sherbet these people have to offer. The malai and daab sherbet and khush khush should be on the list if you are here. You will not be dissatisfied at all. However in my opinion the place needs more seats and renovation as well. The place needs to check on the hygiene part as well. Though I think the restaurant is a little hyped but it is worth a try.

Paramount is one of the legendary places in Kolkata. This place needs no introduction. Their sherbat amd syrups are pure bliss. My personal favourites are daab sherbat, kesar malai, cocoa malai and passion fruit. Passion fruit is prepared with rabri, almonds, cashew and raisins. Cocoa malai is chocolate based drink, the bottom of the drink consists layers of rabri and and at top few almond, cashew and raisins thrown in. And in daab sharbet they use coconut water and a bit of sugar and they also add real scoops of coconut which makes this drink so special.

I went there with my mom. Very famous place amongst us Bengali people. We ordered-

1. Rose malai

2. Kesar lassi

Both of them were amazing. My personal recommendation would be rose malai. It's just superb.

If there is heaven on earth, then it is Paramount!
The perfect place to quench your thirst on a hot sunny summer afternoon. Situated in boipara, it has all sorts of sherbets. The cream green mango is just irresistible!

1. Just behind college square. Always crowded with people. Not at all spacious.
2. All of the sherbets are nice in taste. Choose any but the Dab Sherbet is a classic.

It was a long day for me amidst the lanes of College Street, as I was buying some books. As I was feeling very thirsty, my friend suggested me to sit in the Paramount for a while and get refreshed. Apparently, the place looked shabby and overcrowded. Somehow, we managed to get two seats. Skeptically, I ordered a Sherbat. That was the beginning, as I ended up finishing three glasses of Sherbats. Afterwards, I have visited multiple times to have a sip of their Sherbat. Your food journey of Kolkata is incomplete without this place.

Paramount is one of the legendary places in kolkata, needs no introduction though. their serbats and syrups are pure bliss. Visiting here since my childhood and it's amazing that the taste of the serbats are scrumptious like always.¬† Passion fruits, mango mania and dub sarbat are my personal favourites.

If you are thirsty under the scorching sun in Kolkata, this place is brilliant. This is a good couple destination too. In the most of the times you will find a lot of customers inside and still you will find this 100 years old place comfortable even with your partner.

I found this place to be a little overrated. The Malai Sherbats are nice. I tried the Daab Sherbat and the Kesar Malai Sherbat. Both were good, but a little overpriced. I was forced to have the Kesar Malai without Rabri. I was informed that Rabri was finished for the day and it was only 7 PM in the evening.¬†

You need to wait in a long queue for entry, which can test your patience. The sitting arrangement is not comfortable. It's just wooden benches. The place thrives on age old tradition, and as a result it is still not air conditioned.
There is room of improvement as far as service standards are concerned.

Lastly, if you're a large group, please keep a count of the number of orders you've placed to avoid a mix-up with the billing.

An absolute delight. If you're feeling thirsty after roaming around College Street and craving something delicious, you should give this place a try. This shop's pretty old and a lot of renowned people have visited this place in the past and gave this place a huge thumbs up. We ordered daab sherbets followed by a few passion fruits. Service was relatively fast considering we visited the place during Durga puja. Do check this place out if you ever visit Kolkata. You won't regret it.

I have been to this place numerous times. A good place to be with friends. Apart from some of the best lassi you would get in the city they serve you with milk shakes as well. Try the kesar malai shake and I bet you'll love it considering the rabri spread atop the shake.

I have only one suggestion to the management, which is to have the area adjacent to the restaurant cleaned where the milk shakes and lassis are made. The place seems rather unhygenic at a glance...

Paramount is not a sherbet place its an institution. This age old place has been popular among people of all age be it kids or college goers young students or old professors and elder people who visit this place to reminisce their good old memories. Beside Indian Coffee House and Dilkhusha Cafe this place is also a legendary place in College street area and it can easily boast for one of the longest serving sherbet place in India. Most of the sherbets served here still are the same as it was way back when it was founded. No wonder that the new generation often visits this place along with their father or grandfather and able to relish all the flavours of sherbet that they serve. Overall a great place for sherbet lovers and people who love to soak their throat with some cold beverages the first choice should be this place. I would recommend this place to everyone who is visiting Kolkata as without visiting this place their trip to kolkata will remain incomplete

The sherbats are great and there's no compromisation on the drink quality whatsoever, however the ambience is too claustrophobic and service is slow. The place is always too crowded, as compared to the space it provides. The popularity is understandable, however the management can consider expanding the space, as they're charging a premium for their drinks.

Paramount is a legendary shop. It's just beside putiram in college Street. They're the best seller of sharbats in the city. Very small shop with long benches and tables so that you can carry your University discussions here and sip on to some Wonderful sharbats
I had their legendary dab sharbat. They use dab jaal and a bit of sugar and they also add scoops of real dab which makes the drink an amazing summer cooler.
Tried their kesar and pineapple lassi which they make using curd. Loved them. It was smooth and creamy, tad bit sweet.
Do give this place a visit. It's worth all the hype.

Anyways coming back to what we had....had ti try the dab sharbet....awesome....for rs50 ...plus the malai if the dab as well ....must try...btw parcelled this stuff in a pet bottle which was provided by them at an additional cost of 25rs(also dey said to finish it off within 3hrs...which is good that they privide infozz bout the product they are selling)had a cocoa shake which though damn tasty i felt was just a bit overpriced(just before anyone jumps into conclusions it is becoz i have had something similar in other places/states which uses similar ingredients but are cheaper/higher in quantity).....but nevertheless a gr8 place indeed.....anyone in kol and want to try out the best the city has to offer this onezz a must to add in their bucket list...

During pujo, keeping oneself hydrated should be the first priority. Be it with water or sherbet. Visiting Paramount has long been in my wait list. The place is legendary and that explains the long que before we got a seat. I ordered dub(coconut) sherbet and the order arrived after a waiting for about two minutes. It tasted heavenly, perfect for a hot and sultry afternoon. Definitely coming back again and again.

One of the cult places of Kolkata. You might find the place a little cramped and not with savvy ambience. Don't let it fool you my friends. Find a seat and order any of their signature sherbets like Kesar Malai, Cocoa Malai and Mango Mania (these milk shakes were there before the likes of new pop up milk shake brands now a days) and feel your stress melt away. My personal favorite is the "Dab" sherbet, I always order 2 for myself.

I have been to this iconic place twice, both after a day of roaming around in College Street in the hot sun. Both times, I have been delighted with the old world charm infused with the refreshing decor of Paramount, located right in the heart of College Street. The seating capacity is around twenty, more than enough for a place that serves only drinks.
The last time I came here, we ordered a Litchi Sherbet and a Rose Sherbet. The cold drinks acted like a balm in the merciless, hot weather. The prices of course, are absolutely reasonable, considering how old this place is.
I cannot wait to try out more of the delicious sherbets and syrups from Paramount.

Paramount is a very popular place of North Kolkata located near to College Square. There's hardly someone living in Kolkata, who haven't tried their Sherbats or doesn't know about this place. They're famous for their sherbats & syrups from years that is still maintaining a brilliant quality for respective price.

Paramount is a very basic place that remainds the old culture & looks of Kolkata. Sitting over here looking at the old photo frames with their drinks is refreshing experiance.

One of their most famous drinks are Dub Sarbat & Kesar Malai. Dab Sarbat costs Rs.50 and Kesar Malai was bit expensive at Rs.100.

Dub Sarbat : It wasn't just coconut water, it was something special that was made with experiance from a reputated place. Its sweetness melts the heart while quenching your thirst with the flavour of Coconut. You will see every table have ordered one of this because it's an absolute recommend drink here.

Kesar Malai : It isn't a thick drink like other places rather it was completely lite. Layers of malai & raisins in the drink was the main ingredients making the drink delightful. It tasted totally different than any place & maybe that is their signature.

Paramount is a charm of North Kolkata and a sweet cheers over here is a must.

Paramount is situated in College Steert area. It is a very well known juice and shake parlour. Though i dint know about this place. So today me and my friend ordered Cream kesar lassi and Cocoa malai.

Oh my god.... frankly speaking when i entered the place i did not expect that whatever we would order will be this yummy...

The ambiance is not that attractive...its a small place and benches are there and a small kitchen. As you enter there is this cash counter and then for you to sit there are these benches...

So from the menu card we decided to have these two shakes ...it took about 15-20mins and our shake was ready. When i took a sip of both the shakes it felt like heaven...it was that tasty.

 For quality and taste i would give them 10/10
Not only quality but the quantity is also very good and its super cheap...

COCO MALAI was for 110bucks(approx)
CREAM KESAR LASSI was for 90bucks(approx)

Its a super affordable place. 
I would recommend this place to everyone...

Dab Sorbet is my constant favorite.(It tastes heavenly)You will get a lot of Sorbet(other flavors) and prices are good too.Hygene is average.

Perhaps, north Kolkata is one of the strangest creatures I have ever seen, and if there is any regret I truly harbor, it is the fact that my college was not near central or north Kolkata. Personally, I acquainted myself with this part of the city much later than most of my contemporaries, but yet, given a choice, I probably wouldn‚Äôt change that. Sometimes, regrets can be deceptive. For I cannot certainly claim that I would treat north Kolkata with the same affection and dreamy curiosity had it always been within my grasp. Maybe not. Every nook and cranny here has a story to tell ‚Äì every ancient relic, every tree growing through the brick walls, every street, and every alley. They seem to speak of a phantom nostalgia that hangs in the air, slowly making its way into your lungs, infusing you with a sweet sense of melancholy.

A visit to College Street must count in it a short visit to Paramount, any day. The place is bound to be crowded, regardless of the weather and time. Nevertheless, their Sherbets are worth the wait and the crowd. I would personally recommend their Passion Fruit, Kesar Malai and Daab Sherbet. This little place highly recommended and a must visit for people looking for a refreshing beverage during the summers.

We decided to have the famous daab sharbat ..served to us within minutes in a simple glass! This was one of the best refreshing drink I  ever had!!

We then also took kesar malai ..this one is also equally delightful and pleasant to taste!!üòá

This is the best place in College Street. My friend found out about this place from someone. If you're in College Street you'll have to walk a little bit to get to this place. It's a small shop/outlet, there's not much space to sit inside. I tried the Kesar Malai and my friend tried the Pineapple Malai. Kesar Malai was just great. I, nor did my friend liked the Pineapple Malai much. It's a superb place and a must visit if you're in the neighborhood.

The place is just opposite to college square & it is a small juice(Sharbat outlet).
Their Daab(Coconut) Sharbat is what they are most famous for...tbh I liked it quite refreshing after u done with ur shopping (books i.e) from college Street.I would prefer if they add little less rose water to it else it is fine.
Looking forward to many more visits and tasting their other sharbat options.

Almost a heritage sherbat place... the place is cosy and mostly favourable for small groups... the sherbats are tasty and staff are nice... deducted the 0.5 because - though the pocket pinch is not much for one glass, if you want to order more than one glass it might be a problem for some people , especially students who do not carry a lot of money at a time ... but obviously the place is highly recommended

Paramount Sherbats and Syrups, a heritage place which has been there for more than a century.

Ambience~ Small space and always crowded.

We ordered~
1. Green Mango Syrup : Little different from the regular plain syrups. Chilled. And the '‡¶Ü‡¶Æ ‡¶™‡ßã‡ßú‡¶æ' flavour was mind-blowing. My alltime favourite. A must try.
2. Cream Kesar Lassi : Yummilicious.
3. Dub Sharbat : It refreshes and energies you any time of the day. Totally recommended.

Got tried roaming around the College Street market looking out for books ? Or be those unplanned adda or meetings we gave after college. Paramount has been a constant place for all the teenager or college or University people. Located at College Street this place is just opposite College Square and is very famous for selling some of the best sherbets in North Calcutta. Even Amitabh Bachchan visits this place whenever he is in town for shooting. Such is the popularity and it deserves all the fame because the only escape from heat is the sherbets from Paramount.

There's a lot of variety available here and season special as well like the Dab Sarbat , Keshar Malai these are available every time... but during summer they also bring different mango special Sarbats which is something extraordinary in taste.
Though it is not so spacious but only to be a part of this historic shop selling some the finest sherbets for like so many years everything is worth it.
The average cost is around Rs 150 for two.

This is an old beverage shop of college street.The shop is not so big but it's popularity is immense and they claim that clebraties starting from netaji suvas chandra bose to sourav gangully have been there.
We ordered dab sharbat,coco malai and cream vanilla.

Dab sharbat is so popular here . It's made from 
 coconut water.
Coco malai is nice.
Cream vanilla is just ok.

Paramount is a sherbat and syrup house in College Street, no less than a heritage point now. It mostly remains crowded with college students.
I've visited here so many times for their Dub sherbat. Dub sherbat is chilled coconut water drink with a mild rose water flavor served with a coconut pulp. It's the healthiest option one can choose to beat the heat. It is delicious and that too at an affordable price.
Other than Dub sherbat, I've tried their Cream Kesar Lassi and Strawberry syrup. They are equally delightful and refreshing.
Bangaliyana at its best. Highly recommended. üòä

Finally, I was taken to visit this place and in a lane of the bustling college street it really is a heritage of Kolkata.
I had the Dab Sherbat: everyone who visits there seems to order this and it's the perfect drink. With the daab er saash on the top it's heavenly.
Cocoa malai.. Rich Cadbury flavour and rabri n dry fruits topping to die for.
Cream Vanill. It had a mild vanilla flavour and saltiness in a curd base...
This place should never go down or be replaced, I loved it.
The street style, non-AC ambience is what makes it even more special actually!

Yesterday evening I went to college Street with brother for buying some books. We had fish fries & fish fingers from kalika & what would be better than having some drinks from Paramount after that.
We had their special dub sarbat & cream lassi.

Dub sarbat: very refreshing. 3.5/5

Cream lassi: really delicious. loved it. 4.5/5

Both the drinks were awesome. Really great place, I think everyone knows about it and those who don't, know about it & experience it!

This place is famous for its Green Coconut Sherbet. So, I tried their most popular item and got kind of disappointed. We waited for 15 minutes for the coconuts to arrive as they were out of stock. And after they served it with ice, it was just okay. The amount of green coconut meat they incorporate in their drink is too little. Having said that, it's still a better place to have drinks that those road side stalls.

Already it has history associated with it..and it does continue to serve wonderfully till date.
Went with a friend..we had kesar malai,dub sharbat and lemon syrup.

My friend loves kesar malai...and he will keep having that whenever he visits there. Lemon syrup was a bit too sweet..may be its a syrup thats why..may be its meant to be that way..i don't know but i wish it was a little less sweet.

My favorite is dub sharbatüòá It was really really reaaalllyyy nice. I loved it.

Located just behind college square close to the municipal office, the signature sherbet of this place is their daab sherbet.. There is something about it that you'll never get in the usual tender coconut water.. 
Kesar malai and passion fruit are winners, too. 
The price is a bit on the higher side considering their portion and the student crowd they cater to. 
But great place all in all..

Went there with my friends a few weeks ago.
FOOD(Sherbat only):
Tried the very talked-about Dub Sherbat and cream kesar lassi. Both were good.

SERVICE:
Prompt (how long could it take to prepare a syrup!)

AMBIENCE:
It's a small (yet hygienic üëè) world! üòÅ

I feel this place is a bit over-hyped. The sherbats are undoubtedly good but there's nothing to go all gaga. However, it definitely is one of those legendary places that they talk of. So, give it a try if you're anywhere near college street. üòä

Wheather you visit college street to purchase or just to rummage through the shelves, Paramount is a must drop-by. Featured in an exclusive array of sherbats and syrups, Paranmount is sure to melt your heart! There are a variety of options to choose from and on the first glance, I assure you that you will have a tiff with your inner self with selection. And once you start having, it wont make you contented enough even if you are too full to have any more! You will crave more and more of it. This is the magic of Paramount that sweeps it customers off their feet. Personally, I loved the 'Cocoa Malai Sherbat' and I would recommend everyone to have it. The service quality here is quite noteable with great ambience and a place suitable for visiting both with family and with friends. The staff service is very prompt and it aims at providing comfort to all its customes. On the whole, Paramount is really a beverage parlour worth visiting.

Paramount is the heritage in India's beverage network. Established in 1918, Paramount offers a vast collection of THE MOST exquisite soft drinks that you can ever dream of having. The green mango shake and vanillas shake and 'daab er sherbot' will make your tastebuds go crazy. Its quite true that having only one serving won't fill your hearts desire. Even historically, the shop is notable. Subhas Chandra Bose, Jagadish Chandra Bose, Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray and even Uttam Kumar, Soumitra Chattopadhyay and Sourav Ganguly all have made a visit to this heritage place for its mind blowing taste and vintage flavour.

Paramount does not need any introduction. It is one of the legendary sherbet shop in Kolkata with a lot of heritage attached to it. They are famous for serving eclectic mix of syrups/serbats and special drinks at rock bottom prices.¬†

This was on the bucket list for a long time and finally ticked it off on a Saturday afternoon. As expected the place was full, although we were seated in a couple of minutes. Ambiance is minimal without air conditioning and sharing your table is a must like most of the small joints in North Kolkata.¬†

I tried the passion fruit, Cocoa Malai, Daab sarbat and Tamarind syrup based drink.¬†

The passion fruit is the costliest on the menu and it is clearly the winner. Its filling and tasted amazingly good. Prepared with rabri, almonds, cashew and raisins - this is a drink worth splurging (well as per Paramount standards ).¬†
The cocoa malai is chocolate based drink with a few almonds, cashew and raisins thrown in - tasted good too.¬†

The famous daab sarbat was refreshing and taste wise - the closest a drink can get to fresh coconut water.¬†

The tamarind syrup based drink was surprisingly good and a welcome change to the taste buds after the other items. I really really liked it and will definitely order this on my next visit.¬†

Pocket pinch for the 4 drinks - Rs 320. Sweet !¬†

Located in the lane behind College square, its best not to take a four wheeler as parking is an issue. Over all a great experience and totally recommended ! Cheers!

An heritage sharbat shop..over the years many famous people have visited this juice shop...and can be seen as they are pasted over the wall...
The most famous juice out here is Daab Sharbat...made with tender coconut water and topped with tender flesh of coconut (saas)...and they serve it on the rox (with ice)...
Apart from this one can try cream kesar lassi...
The shop it not that big around 20 pax...so don't be finicky to share
seats...
The pricing is very competitive and easy going on pockets...
Recently they have gone online by attaching themselves with Swiggy...
Since it's an old heritage place so don't expect ac...
My personal favorite is Daab Sharbat & rose milk shake...

Finally I am able to visit this place after a long a wait and have some refreshing sherbat. This small old joint has some historic essence in each and every corner of it. On my 1st visit I have ordered their famous dub sherbat as well as take a sip of  the Rose malai. Both the drinks are refreshing  but I like the Rose malai over dub sherbat. For me dub sherbat is of average quality. Next time I like to have some different flavors.

Aaaahh! This is the coolest place to hang out in summers, springs, autumns and also in winters. Perhaps the best sherbet in Kolkata is sold here. And you won't be disappointed in whatever you try. I've been there several times and had different sherbets every time and each of them tastes really "cool" and refreshing!¬†
The hygiene should be maintained more properly here. Once we found a hair in a glass of sherbet and the waiter insisted that it was one of the customer's which was not the case.¬†
This place is small and cramped but the sherbet makes up for it.

Grew up visiting this iconic place at College St. Tried most of the varieties available. Both milk & curd based sherbets & syrups are available. They also serve Cold Coffee. Cocoa Malai,Cream Green Mango & Kesar Lassi are amongst my favourites. But their Dub Sharbat is of another level. Dub Sharbat in hot summer afternoon is pure bliss. It is low on calories too. The place gives a break from other cafes serving smoothies & shakes & coolers. Pocket pinch is also not that high with most items on the menu being priced at Rs.50/- only. There is a nostalgic feel to this place. This almost century old legendary shop has been visited by likes of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose,Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose,Meghnath Saha,Satyajit Ray,Uttam Kumar,Suchitra Sen,Sunil Gangopadhyay,Shakti Chattopadhyay amongst many others. You are not a true Bengali if you have not been to this place at least once :)

I visited the legendary "Paramount Sherbats and Syrups" with my mother yesterday after searching for books at the numerous book stalls . It was a hot summer afternoon and we figured that there was nothing better than a good glass of sherbat to cool off . It was a first for the both of us. I had read rave reviews about the place on Zomato and heard about it from some of my friends quite a few times. It was high time that I paid the place a visit during my next venture to college Street. The drinks cafe is located very close to the back gate of Calcutta University. It was packed with people trying to beat the heat when I walked in around 3 pm. The owner who sits at the desk at the front of the drinks cafe is very attentive to the needs of whoever comes in. The place is exactly like how I have imagined old cafes to be like. While maintaining its old world charm it continues to update its services by joining the swiggy network and putting up boards lit up to highlight the menu . The menu itself is comprehensive . Brief and to the point.

I had ordered a "cream pinapple" and my mother a "cream kesar lassi". Both of them were pretty good. The syrups used in each brought forward the respective flavours. Both were curd based and served with ice. Over the layer of ice was a white layer of a more buttery version of curd ( the layer that forms just below the soft crust of the malai.) It was to die for. I'd highly recommend the place to anyone who is in the area. It offers a break from the many cafes which serve shakes and smoothies. The sherbats here are something you won't find anywhere else in Calcutta because of the shere quality of ingredients used. Definitely visiting Paramount again to try more of their sherbats.

Update from 26.7.17
This time I had ordered a cocoa malai. It's a mix of milk, cadbury drinking chocolate , malai and dry fruits . I have never tried a blend of malai with chocolate milk before.....found it quite nice and refreshing . The service is pretty prompt as well. So if you're ever in college Street and have 10 minutes to spare , do drop into this place for a nice refreshing drink . Highly recommended.

I have visited the place in summer time. Ordered Dub Sarbat and it was fantastic! It consists of Dub/Coconut water with ice and "dub er sash" & a their secrete masala. Perfect and healthy which brings chillness in scorching heat. Service and ambiance is simple and fine.

The experience was sweet and nice exactly like the sharbat and lassi over the table. 
I liked the Dab Lassi and green mango lassi also tasted great. 
This place gives you many historical vibes and in a board since 1918 written looks good. 
Hello Summer. 
Happy Dinning.

A legendary shop which serves legendary coolers for legendary people. Paramount is an iconic landmark on College street which is absolutely the best place for you to quench your thirst in the humid climate of the bustling city of Joy. I tried their litchi and grape sherbets and both of them were quite refreshing. But my favourite was their dab sharbat which was really fresh and tasty. Definitely recommended

The sherbats tasted wonderful.. Specially the Daab Sherbat. And the Mango Milk-Shake were simply great! Would keep me coming back!

It is very hard to rate history.Paramount is an inseparable part of the history of Kolkata.Situated in the education hub of the city this humble shop has fascinated many notable persons as well as the commoners through decades.What really makes it even special is the homely atmosphere & prompt service.Apart from the iconic Dab-er sherbat,Green mango,Passion fruit,Kesar Malai are other top picks.Keeping a tab on the demand of the times recently they have collaborated with an online food delivery service.So I'm deducting half marks with the demand of the air conditioning system at the shop that has an emotional connect with almost every foodie of the city.

This was a unique experience. A small quaint little outlet in middle of the city which i didn't even know about till a month back.  You should visit here for the unique bengali experience along with sipping on some yummy juices....in that order. Established in 1918 this outlet is proud of its history and examples of it can be seen all over the place. Pictures of freedom fighters and other bengali personalities are all over its wall. And If you visit the place a must try would be the Daab Sherbat and the Kesar Pista.

The beauty of Calcutta is so often tucked away in tiny streets, nooks and crannies.

Paramount is one such beauty, carefully preserved in an old gully behind College Square. 

I went to this little shop on a very hot afternoon with a friend. She insisted, thank God, she did. 

Once we secured a place, she promptly ordered three glasses of Dub Sarbat. 

When I looked at her, surprised, she just said, "wait, we'll divide one in half" and soon enough, I was thankful again.

The drink itself was cold, with a curious taste and very refreshing. Each glass had shreds of tender coconut kernels, to be scooped up and eaten with a spoon.

Paramount has kindled my curiosity about the other sarbats too. The essence of old Calcutta in a cool glass tumbler.

For my 100th review I chose this heritage sherbat joint that would be the best place to go to in this scorching heat! Following are the 5 items we tried from here:
1) dub(green coconut) sherbet(5/5)- well this is my first 5 points at anything...hands down the best sherbet that I have ever tried!! The plain green coconut water has a more intense taste here thanks to a syrup added(which btw is also sold individually). The liquid is further topped with green coconut kernel! A trip to this place from south Kolkata is justified by this drink alone!! MUST MUST TRY!!

2) kesar malai (3.5/5)- it's a kesar flavoured milkshake topped with kalakand ,malai(cream) and garnished with dry fruits! It's a great drink for kesar fans! It looks amazing too!

3) grape sherbat(2/5)- the most disappointing drink! It's an orangish brown coloured drink that had a sweet and sour flavour but I didn't find any familiarity with grapes...

4) green mango lassi(4/5)- this is a very refreshing version of a plain lassi! The creamy frothy lassi with a hint of green mango flavour! I Really liked it.

5)choco malai(4.5/5)- I am so glad we didn't leave before trying this one out! It is chocolate milkshake with a very strong flavour of cocoa and this too is topped with kalakand and dry fruits just that instead of using cream they used cocoa powder!! Highly recommended!!

The ambience is very different! One doesn't have a table for oneself but it's like there are benches on which people sit , side by side, for drinking their amazing sherbets together! I guess the very fact that There are people waiting to get a seat in a sherbet shop...speaks volumes about the popularity and quality of this place!

A unique place that must be visited by all!

Soumya Chakraborty thanks for introducing me to this place üòÉ and yet again thanks for being there beside me right from my 1st review!This one is dedicated to you!

This place is legendary with many famous personalities of the city who have been here and had their shebats. Paramount excels in serving juice and sherbats that are just heavenly. Don't get dragged down by the small look of the shop. Once you have drinks here you will not be satisfied with any place other than this. If only they would revamp the place and make it look a bit more classy with the changing times, this would be a fantastic place to spend your evenings with friends. The only sad thing is that you can't just spend time here with friends or on date with your special one. This is not a place to sit and gossip. But I hope in future they will renovate the place and make it a more of a sherbat cafe keeping with the legend that it was once. The tamarind and dub sarbat is a must have here.

Unique and one of its kind! Visited millions of times literally.
Best place for sherbats & chilled drinks. I've been here innumerable times.... Nearly every day during summer months, I visit this place. I have tried every item multiple times.
My personal favorite is Rose syrup...its taste , I don't know why , but its deep taste appeals to me with an excellent sensation all over the mouth. Rose malai & cream rose kind of dampens the flavour.
Cream green mango, dub sherbat, coca malai ...All are quite good.
Cream vanilla is also my favorite.
Tamarind syrup is amazing....The great refreshing taste is beautiful.
Khus khus syrup is also my one of the favorites. It's prepared from 'khus khus' (‡¶ñ‡¶∏ ‡¶ñ‡¶∏ ) , the thin slice of interwoven wood curtain that's hung on windows after soaking in water so that passing air gets cooled. A traditional air conditioner. When that 'khus khus' is still green ( just after made from mango tree), it's extract is taken to make the syrup. Its taste is really good & interesting...I can't actually describe in words.
Passion fruit also good....And very decorated. It's the extract of an exotic fruit named passion fruit, whose taste somewhat resembles that of Wood apple (‡¶¨‡ßá‡¶≤) , but is unique.
Grapes crush is also good & very calming.
Ambience feels good with memories of so many great personalities and awards.
It is one of the most unique food stops & a must visit place for tourists also.

Tucked away in the streets of north Kolkata is this legendary sherbat outlet. This store is one of the oldest and one of the best place that serves a variety of flavoured coolers that helps one to deal with the heat. For someone who visits college street this place is a must visit. There is a list of eminent people who have frequently visited this place and one feels privileged to share the space that was once shared by the celebrities.  Even today this place welcomes people from all ages, from all professions and its been able to live up to their expectations for ages.  
The seating arrangement is small and is mostly packed. Recommended drinks are 
1. DAAB SHERBAT - THIS IS MY FAVOURITE. Coconut water with daab malai, this drink gives all shakes a run for their money. And its very reasonable too.
2. Mango mania- mango flavoured shake with rabri, dry fruits that imparts a unique taste to this drink. 
3. Kesar Malai- drink is floured with saffron and rabri with loads of dry fruits 
4. Coco Malai- this chocolaty milkshake with rabri and dry fruits is really filling and refreshing...
If you are visiting college street, buy a couple of books, get a kobiraji from dilkhush or baked fish from coffee house or luchi cholar dal from putiram and then seal the deal with sherbat from paramount.  This completes your college street adventure :D

"Osadharon" is the one word to say for this place.
Serves right, feels right, tastes right and refreshes right.
Small outlet just behind college square, serves the best sherbet in the area. 
One can go to this place multiple times to have a chilled drink and never get bored. Staff are very courteous and prompt. Drinks are served fresh and chilled to the optimum level. 
Dab sherbet is the best attraction but every other drink is also equally good. 
I'm short the whole menu needs to be checked out and every drink has something refreshing to offer.

Paramount, located near the College square grounds is the best place in this scorching summer to beat the heat. I had been here on a hot and humid afternoon. As we enter there is a list of eminent people who have frequented this place. The sitting arrangements is moderate. It is a very simple place,nothing extraordinary yet it has in the heritage of Kolkata. We ordered the special Daab sharbat, Mango Mania and Kesar Malai.
The Daab Sharbat has the unique flavour of coconuts with daab malai and at a reasonable price.
The Mango mania and Kesar malai also had it in raisins, kheer, malai and rubri which added to its flavour.
Thus this coloured coolers would soothe you at affordable prices on a hot summer day.
Strongly recommended!

Drinks & Description ‚Äì We few foodies after our visit at food station and having spicy Chinese food, were looking for some some coolers in the hot weather. What better that this legendary outlet. Almost 99 years into this business, this outlet have served their sarbats to many lengends. Have visited this place a lot of time, it never disappoints. One of the best place for cool sarbats. Coming to what we tasted:

Tamarind Sarbat ‚Äì It is excellent. Tangy flavours with little masala, heavenly. A must try.


Daab Malai Sarbat - This Sarbat is best here. You can have any number of times, you still will crave to have more. It is made with daab water mixed with their in-house syrup , with added daab malai to it. Out of the world. Highly recommended.


Overall the experience was amazing. Drinks were super. Sarbat lovers cannot afford to miss it. It is very popular among students there. Highly Recommended.

Pocket Pinch - water based drinks are at 50 per glass & milk based drinks are at 100 per glass approx.

Paramount the age old sherbet place as a legacy of it s own. It's not only famous but has unique variety of sherbets! Tried their dab sherbet,cocoa malai and kesar cream lassi in my few visits! All of them are very tasty n highly recommended in this hot and humid weather!

It was the month of May.The scorching heat of the Sun had almost exhausted us when we landed there in Paramount.We didn't have great expectations but they surprised us with the quality of their sherbats.Their "Dub Sarbat" would be my recommendation.

One of the oldest in the city, famous for its sherbaths and syrups. The best one and the most famous one here is the daab sarbat. Others like cream lassi, cream vanilla, cream green mango, green mango syrup all ate good. The special ones with malai are a bit heavy. Attendants are good. The part here is they adjust the taste if something isn't working for you; like more sugar, less sour,etc. And the rates are real cheap!
Visit the place for both sherbaths and its heritage.

What do you do after a long hot day of book hunting at College Street? 
Ans. You go straight to the Paramount and order Daab Sherbat and taste a little piece of heaven. 

Sitting at the heart of the College Street, this is the best place to visit during the hot days of Kolkata's summer. As you enter the place you will  get know the no. of world famous people that have visited this place before. And lets not talk about the drinks because I guess all the adjectives that I am gonna use to describe them have already been used by thousands of users who have rated this place before me. So if anyone is reading my review who haven't tried this place before, its already over 35¬∞ here in Kolkata, what are you still waiting for? üòâ

My all time favorite place. As a student of city college i used to go there every week. We all know that Dab sarbat is the trade mark of them but I add also that each and every sarbat is too good and fresh. It's so healthy too. Kesar malai and rose sarbat are amazing after Dab sarbat . :)

A must visit place if you are in Calcutta. Pocket friendly awesome sherbets and drinks. Staffs are very good and respond to you very quickly. Management in there is also very good so that you don't need to wait for too long to get a seat. Space is the only problem that I have noticed in there but overall experience is very good. 
My personal favorites are Daber Sarbat , rose malai , vanilla malai and kaccha mango syrup!!

They are overly priced. A glass of synthetic mango  drink costs ‚Çπ100.......I would not even pay ‚Çπ30 for this.

 How is this place getting rated so high??
I would suggest People rating this place above 3 to buy a packet of tang, put chilled water and ice. The ll have a better experience.

Expectations crushed.!!!!

Their service is good with lot of people coming in...... It's got a bustle but it's not at all worth it.

A legendary food establishment serving some of the best refreshments one can wish for. There is nothing ostentatious about this place, it is simple and commonplace yet there is a huge obsession amongst everyone to visit this place if they are in and around College Street area. The reason for this is the quality of the drinks they serve. It is located in one of the many lanes in College Street this place is always packed with customers. The students of the nearby schools and colleges form the majority of the crowd. I have been here many times over the years and there hardly seems to be any change in ambience or in the quality of service and servings. On my recent visit, I had ordered Dub Sarbat, Kesar Malai, Grapes Crush, Cream Green Mango, Cocoa Malai.

Dub Sarbat: Undoubtedly, the best drink I have ever had. Having this on a scorching summer day is pure bliss. This is a must try drink for all. Deftly prepared with coconut water and little bit of syrup with the kernel floating on top makes it an all-time favourite drink for all. Highly recommended!

Kesar Malai: This too is a very good drink. It is slightly heavy due to the presence of rubri, kheer and dry fruits. It is way better than the Frappes we get in CCD. This drink too is recommended!

Grapes Crush: This drink was slightly disappointing. It lacked the natural factor that this place is known for. It was too syrupy.

Cream Green Mango: Another great serving of this place. The cream provides a lassi kind of look and feel to this drink. The taste is exquisite. Recommended!

Cocoa Malai: A great drink with cadbury bits and dry fruits as toppings. This too is kind of heavy but you will enjoy it a lot. Recommended!

I have tried many of their other drinks and none disappointed me. This time, however, the grapes crush did not impress me at all. Others were all really good. The prices are extremely pocket friendly which makes it even better for the students. I would like to visit this place again and again.

It's a small restaurant which only offer drinks ( sarbats) . The dab sarbat they offer is really good and tasty. The cocoa malai is also good.It is a vintage place located in college street and which is mostly crowded. Though Its ambience is nothing special. If you want to refresh yourself with sarbats in summer without hurting your pocket then you may visit this outlet for sure.

Wow! Just wow! This place blew me away! This is life THE best place to visit for a break from the scorching (sun or even when it's cloudy) just go there! Have whatever you want. It can be easily located on the busy College Street and I might gain haters after I say this, but visit this instead of coffee house, your experience will be better! I'd suggest you try the milk sherbats but you can really have whatever you want. It's a great place, I liked the ambience, service was fast, price is reasonable. Do visit before you die

Whenever I visit College Street, I make sure to hop into Paramount for their daber sharbot. Almost a century old shop which only offers shorbots and range of syrups. Though their daber shorbot is the most popular signature item, but other drink items are also good. A small shop, not like modern food joints, their presentation is also very simple. But what set them apart is their heritage and history. Established in 1918 , it has a board on a wall with names of all the famous personalities who came to have a glass of serbat. I always have goosebumps while I read the list, it makes me wonder may be Satyajit Ray sat on the chair in which I am sitting. However a lovely place with lovely drinks in affordable prices.

I have heard about PARAMOUNT a lot as one of the authentic eatery with old world charm. Recently I have been to these place to find out. Ordered Rose Malai & Daab Sorbet ( green  coconut drink). None  were too exceptional in test but the malai was really  creamy and made the difference. A little too sweet for me but manageable. Daab Sorbet tests very fresh and specially the pieces of tender coconut put inside the glass added real flavour. Though the interior  is very basic; the location makes it a very comfy place for college and university students. Very economic in price point. Perfect place to quench your thirsty mouth with bunch of buddies.

This place is categorized under legendary outlets of Kolkata in zomato. It is one of the most oldest shop in college street area weighing lots of memories and traditions. Finally got the chance to visit this place today and my experience is just amazing. We take dub sharbat first and it is totally refreshing in this hot sunny afternoon. Normal coconut water served with lots of ices and also with the coconut flesh. As you start drinking, it will definitely give you a refreshment. Liked it a lot. Next we take pineapple cream lassi which is a curd based drink (lassi). It also tasted good. As we couldn't get enough of such chilling drinks we also take strawberry malai and it tasted too good. Strawberry drink is served with a malai on the top with kaju kismis. The sweet chilling drink made us happy. Surely recommended to my fellow foodies. Do give it a try in this hot summer and you will extremely enjoy every sip of the drinks. Cheers! üçπ

What can be more satisfying than quenching your thirst with delicious shakes n sharbats in the tiring summer . Nothing stops me from entering this place whenever I'm in the vicinity of College Street . Undoubtedly , its a heritage of North Kolkata where all the famous personalities have at least been  once.
The Dab Sharbat, the kesar malai , the mango lassi  and all other were awesome in terms of taste. A perfect place for " adda and sharbat ".

Before trying their sharbat didn't know that a sharbat can come with so much of variety. I ordered dub (coconut) sharbat ¬†and grape crush. After taking a sip of dub sharbat i was in heaven. It is the best sharbat they have in their shop but after that grape crush was nothing compared to it. Cocoa malai was also a great one. So whenever you visit college street give this shop and their sharbat a visit, i am sure you'll love them. For me coffee house was a must visit whenever i went to college street but now i can't ignore paramount and their sharbat. Just go guys and grab a dub sharbat.

To quench your thirst on a hot summer day, this is really a place to look out for. The place is small and a bit cramped but the service is fast. The people managing the place are decent enough.
If you like ac in the restu then this might not be ur place as it does not have ac but with their kind of delicious sherbats , you wont need ac.
One drawback is there that they don't serve you the bill , you have to go to the counter at the time of leaving to pay the bill means you have to memorise your whole order which is a bit problematic if you have order many items.

Location wise it's not easy to find, at College Street ask anyone about the KMC building & just the opposite lane of that, walk around 2-3mins on right you will find your place to shove all & not only thrust you will came with some unexpected sherba@ts at unexpectedly low cost.

They are running this shop since 1918. So after entering the shop you will came to see some that prev moments they kept.

Ambiance is good because area is known as "College Para", you will find that young crowd & college bunked / after the college gang.

Decor wise it's not upto the mark but sometimes I believe that they are upgrading minimal things for to maintain that "1918" look quite a bit.

Pocket pinch wise it's really cool. Hardly 100 -150 for 2 glasses of palatable sherbats. If you want to take that sherbats & enjoy in your house then they also have that option with very clean manner.

I visited 4 to 5 times there but now also I fell confused before ordering any of there menus. But, last day I took #dub_sherbat #mango_malai.

Coconut water Sherbet is something new that I found in their menu. This sherbet is one of the best sherbet that I have ever had. I tried their litchi syrup sherbet also. Perfect coolant with required amount of sugar and quantity. The prices are also very less when you compare it with the quality of the sherbet. This place is complying it's legendary status and for me, it is a must visit place every time I visit Kolkata.

One of the signature places of old calcutta... Situated in the heart of college street.. it is the liefhebber place to be in order to bear the heat with the sumptuous shakes and sherbets. I've tried many but rose malai is my favorite... With its pleasant aroma and colour in addition to its taste that is enhanced by the malai..and kaju.... It is the king of the shakes they serve .

I totally love this place. I went to Paramount (located in a quaint little lane of College Street) for the first time with my mom and it has been a favorite place since! And all I have had over these years is Dab Sherbet for Rs. 50/- (Coconut Water + Malai - I don't know their receipe but its amazing), but my friends have had other items from the menu, and the general review has been really good.¬†
The owners still run the shop, and take care of the customers. :) The lady at the counter helped me get stuff packed for home too (Plastic cup - Rs. 5/-, Bottle - Rs. 25/- - Since its not mentioned in the menu) :)¬†

P.S: The shop is very, VERY old - It has a history of its own. So, while it doesn't have the posh restaurant look, it still retains the charm of old Calcutta. :)

Paramount is one of the oldest juice centre in kolkata.Its running from many decades. It has many history. You can say it has it's own heritage.
Place -It is situated in college square.
Not like ccd or Barista nd that couldn't
rupture the rhapsody of that place.

Must try-dab sarbot,kesar rabri juice with cashew and raisins.

Paramount has been the most iconic sherbat joint in Kolkata, serving calcuttans since last 98 yrs with their diff. range of sharbets.
If anyone prepares a list of top 10 places to eat and drink in Kolkata, paramount will be high on that chart for sure.
Located at College Street adjacent to  The Calcutta University Hall. locating this place will not be tuff as anyone you ask on the street will guide you there.
 
Coming to the main part the  Sherbats: Their Dub sharbet is simply awesome, tender coconut flesh served with sweet coconut water with a hint of rose essence and ice on top..... Forget mojito this is best refreshing drink I ever had... Another 2 sharbats you must try are Kesar Malai sharbets,kesar flavour sherbats served with ample amount  of malai on top and passion fruit sherbats.

Service is really good.

Well it is part of the heritage in the city, so a visit was inevitable. Ordered one of their green mango drinks and the infamous daab sherbet. 
Note: ONLY order daab sherbet. ALWAYS. Do not deviate. No, the rabri malai one is not as fascinating as it sounds.

We visited this classic Sherbet place on one of our food walks which was organised as a promotional event for a college fest!
 Cozy seatings and packed with young college goers and people who want to enjoy the charms of the Old Calcutta is what you will see once you enter this place! We really loved the environment out here and the staff is really quick and friendly!
We tried the famous Dub Sherbet and Kesar Malai.
Dub Sherbet was really refreshing and soothing! Perfectly sweetened with pieces of daab malai combined with daab water! We totally loved it!
Kesar malai was like a badaam kesar milk based sherbet that is served in holi parties. It was a little too sweet but yes was definitely refreshing! 
One must definitely try this place if in this area just because its one of the gems of the city! Its worth a stop anyday! :)

This is the most unique and one of its kind beverage shop in Kolkata. 95 years old, this establishment serves a delicious array of different kinds of sherbats. Cozy sitting arrangements and very friendly staff makes this a very attractive place to hang out with your friends and family. The daab sherbat, rabri malai sherbat and the passion fruit sherbat are the best in my opinion.

94 years and still running strong! Paramount, located opposite college square is Kolkata's one of the oldest sherbet joints that serves you with instant happiness. That 4.5 is not just because of the boast worthy heritage, but also the lip smacking sherbets. Marble top tables, narrow benches, glass framed menus, walls adorned with wooden deer torsos and the photographs of famous people who had visited the shop, the ambiance is sheer nostalgia and creates the perfect atmosphere for an adda.¬†Coming to the sherbets, I was absolutely perplexed when asked to order because all of them looked equally tempting. I finally decided on the famous "Daab Sherbet" and the "Passion fruit sherbet". The daab sherbet was a refreshing one. It was topped with what we call 'daab er shaash' or ¬†coconut flesh. The passion fruit sherbet was rather an ornamental one. Generously topped with almonds, cashew and raisins, the sherbet had a thick layer of rabri. It was a filling and sumptuous drink. The price is very nominal and the people out there are always ready to welcome you with a smile and narrate the old stories related to the shop. You can also take home the syrups for a minimal cost. If one is in Kolkata, this is a must try shop.

It is one of the oldest as well as unique to its kind. It is a must whenever I visit college street. It is a very small place but always is swarmed by people. The famous daab sherbat is I must say is their speciality. You would also get a number of other syrups and flavour cream malai's. There is a wall of fame which has the names and reviews of different famous personalites. A must try for everyone who have not visited yet.

Being a Calcutta University Student, it would be real injustice to visit this place. Especially during summer !

One fine day, along with my bunch of people we headed to this place.

Ambience - The seating arrangement is quite less. But if you have to wait in the queue, it's worth it. So hang on there ! Gives you a proper Bangaliyana feeling.

Had the DAAB SHERBAT. I must say, you have to have this when you are around this place. You can't get enough of it. The way they present it, it's great. The service time is quick. 

Overall a pleasant experience. So give it a try folks ! :)

Have not visited the outlet yet but what I came across last sunday at my friend's daughter's annaprasana was a welcome daab sharbat  and strawberry malai sharbat which were above soothing and too much refreshing with real contents. I could not help myself rather asked the host about these cool beverages and it was then that I got to know about Paramount from where they have been ordering the drinks. Looking forward to visit the place and try the beverages.

Both not only soothes tongue and belly but your souls too.
Pocket friendly glass of heaven costs hardly 100/-.

I had heard from every Kolkata Bangali that this is amongst one of the must visit places if you happen to be in College Street. Finally, got a chance to visit this time. Not really a connoisseur of sherbats in general, but I tried their Dab sharbat. It had a unique flavour and is served with the Malai. With limited seating arrangements, it has a variety of milkshakes etc to offer and very reasonably priced. Historically significant place and I will definitely revisit on my next stint for a repeat order.

If you have travelled around enough. You'd know that besides being a century old. There is nothing special about this place. A refreshment shop that luckily stood amongst book stores where all the thirsty book shoppers and college students would stop. Nothing special about the coconut juice that I was asked to try...no offence, I didn't find anything special.

If I could attach a tagline to the restaurant name then I would propose, 'where you seep history itself'. This place has been visited by so many luminaries that you will get immediately humbled when you enter the place. Small but cozy, often visited by students and with prompt service the visit itself is an experience. 

And the delicacies. The mouth watering sherbets are simply awesome. Take my words. If you get too hot with book browsing at College Street this is the best place to chill out. Lastly what to recommend. It's so so difficult. Close your eyes and pick anything that first comes to your mind. Still if you are too picky, I would then suggest Passion Fruits or Mango Mania. They are simply delicious.

Located in college street area this place is frequented by students and other book buyers. The sherbats here is well renowned and each one of the variety available is worth it. 

During my many visits to the place I had kesar Malai, cocoa Malai, mango mania, daab sherbat, green mango and khus khus. All the preparations has lip smacking taste. 

This place is a life saver on hot summer days. A must visit for everyone. Little high on cost but totally worth it.

Paramount is probably one of the best place in College Street area. The Sherbaat seller started their business down in 1918 and has seen eminent personalities visiting here. A glimpse of the eminent personalities can ve seen on their wall. Also they have a board with the names people visited here.
Sherbats are superb. And that is the reason why Paramount was under Legendary catagory of Zomato.
I went here had they Dab Sharbat and Rose Sharbat both were excellent in taste.
Seating arrangement is old, mostly same from last 100years. Excellent place to seat and have quality time.
Prices are very reasonable.

Paramount- the name says it all. May be the only heritage outlet in kolkata that hasn't succumbed to today's trendy and modern juice bars/restaurants. Still carrying out the legacy of yesteryears when kolkata used to be 'kollolini tilottama'. But it's a bit costly given the plain decor and clumsy sitting arrangements and narrow space.

This place oozes of nostalgia. It's good to see that they have maintained the quality of the drinks even after all these decades. The Daab Sarbat is a must-try here. This place feels like an oasis on a hot summer afternoon. The ambiance is typical North Calcuttan, and for me, despite what everyone says, it does not need a renovation or a modification of seating arrangement. They need to keep that ambiance intact. Like the coffeehouse, it has a signature atmosphere exuding a profound sense of history that would perish if they renovate it.

During the struggle for independence, the freedom fighters of our nation needed a hide-out and this is how this place is said to be formed. The Majumdars were said to sell coconut water (known by Daber Sherbat) in disguise just to keep the real motive hidden. After gaining independence, it turned itself into a full fledged 'sherbat' shop.

Going by the name, Paramount Sherbat and Syrups, it continues to thrive on and attract the attention of the masses. It is probably one of the rarest soft drink refreshment place where you find people flocking in off-season, too. The first visit to this place dates back more than half a decade ago when I just got shifted to Kolkata. A tution class acquaint asked me to accompany him while he was planning to pay this place a visit and out of courtesy I couldn't deny him. It turned out that this acquaint is now my dearest friend and well, it might be the effect of brotherhood that once thrived in the hearts of fighters but surely not the taste of the syrups.

This iconic shop is located on College Street just opposite to one of the gates of College Square and hardly few metres from the KMC office. It is spread over a tiny area with few wooden tables and chairs cluttered against each other and one always struggles to find place there being flocked by people of various ages almost all the time.

There are various types of sherbats and syrups available but all of them taste just fine with exception of drinks which are priced over ‚Çπ100. There isn't such a taste which will attracts folks from all corners but it's the history attached to it which makes it that popular. All the types of beverages that are provided here are just like any other shops serving the same and hence it doesn't justify the high price they charge.

However, I would like to mention that the grandchildren of Majumdar family who sits at the counter taking payments and listening to requests are very well behaved, polite and soft spoken. The courtesy one gets there are recommendable but the staffs doesn't always make you smile.

A visit is recommended!

One of the most favorite joints in the north of the city. Lovely homely atmosphere with simple decor and menu. The sherbet are all delicious and easy on the pocket. I absolutely love their Daab Sherbet, which is their house speciality. Also tried their Mango Mania, Kesar Lassi, Khus Sherbet among many others. I visit this place almost every month to quench my thirst for the few beauties of life.

Finally visited this place after having it long in my bookmarks, this place is old and a legend in itself, it has served so many eminent personalities of Kolkata. On entering the look feel and smell will resemble of a homeopathy's doctor clinic, but the speed of service and taste does the trick.

Tried dub sharbat which was nariyal pani served chilled, a unique one instead. The cream lemon was fantastic, curd and ripe mangoes went so well together; I loved the taste of curd, never have tasted such thik curd in a drink apart from lassi. I even tried cream lemon, which was good, herr the curd over shadowed the lemon flavour but its a one time try. Will come here again till I try all there stuff.

Who isn't aware of Paramount? I'm sure no one. 
Paramount is a famous juice centre located in North Kolkata. And everybody knows about it! 

I was really unfortunate to not have had the opportunity of visiting this gem of a place until last week. However, last week I was adamant on visiting Paramount and thankfully everything worked out and I could finally visit it!

Located very near to College Square, this is a shop which is not very big. However, about 20 odd people can fit in.

Now coming to what we ordered.

‚Ä¢ Mango Mania - this tasted divine. It was mango smoothie with malai and dry fruits. Every sip tasted divine.

‚Ä¢ Kesar Pista Lassi - even this tasted brilliant. In fact I loved it more than the former. Simple yet tasty. Strongly recommended! The flavour of pistachio was so beautifully balanced with the Lassi. Uhh..I'm thirsty already. 

Pocket pinch - 300

If one wants to experience the old world charm of North Kolkata, this juice centre is a must! Definitely worth many visits.

A place of its own kind..... The taste,  tradition,  ambiance and the place... will give you an idea of what kolkata is once you visit paramount. now let me come one at a time:
Taste -  Their sarbats are made up of pure ingredients available in the market... they use quality products and genuine ones.... some of the famous sarbats in their repository are malai sarbat... daber sarbat and few others.... in the malai sarbat you can see the solid malai floating out from your glass, which is a mouthwatering sight......once you drink their daber sarbat you would wonder how coconut water could be so tasty... all other sarbats are also of top notch... they also sell it on bottles. 
Tradition -   A place visited by greats like satyajit ray,  netaji and many other famous personalities can't be regarded as an ordinary place... they have a full list of names of the personalities visited their shop in a photo frame(i am attaching a snap of that frame) . So you can imagine how old and authentic the place is. 
Ambiance -  After acquiring ao much fame and name they are very down to earth and their behavior is really good.
Place - Located at college street nearby coffee house... i guess i have nothing more to say about the heritage and popularity of the place. 
The only reason i am giving them 4.5 instead of 5 is that the prices are just a bit on higher side in comparison with the glass in which they provide the sarbat....  i think they any one thing is that 
1)reduce the price a bit 
       or 
2) make the glass a bit larger with little less ice.
the rest everything is fine

No amount of gourmet and fancy decor can compete with the classic. That's why they are classic. Having said this, this place is the best place to catch a drink, hangout and sip something which will completely blow your mind. This is the place you go to, if you have to recover from a breakup quick.¬†
The decor is minimal. You will find the staff to be especially friendly and mature. The drinks here are better and cheap to top it all.

I love their dab sharbat, cocoa malai. These are my personal favorite .

Apart from that, this place holds rich history of national freedom movement. From Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose to Acharya Prafulla chandra many legends regularly visited this place. The staffs are very friendly and customer satisfaction is their top priority.

I highly recommend this place to everyone, not only for their awesome sharbats but also the history associated with this place.

I have tried all of the sherbets except the banana type.
My favourites and recommendations:
Dub Sarbat should be a must try in summer. If you want to hydrate yourself in a scorched summer noon try the tamarind and/or green mango (Syrup- water based) sherbet. You won't regret it.
Next, I would suggest cream rose and cream kesar lassi.
Rose Malai is also good.
Passion fruits, choco malai and kesar malai are also good to taste and fills you up.
Service is extremely good. The ambience has a old school feeling. People here share tables. It is an all-good-feeling place.
I love it and would go whenever I am in College Street. I hope Paramount remain glorious like this for years more so that we can quench with the variety of tasty Sherbats. :) ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•

This is not a regular place, this is a LEGEND. Successfully refreshing the minds and souls of people for more than 90 years, Paramount is a must visit for anyone in Kolkata. They have a wide variety of sherbets, each one competing with the others in the menu to win over the hearts of the people who come here. With a neat and archaic decor, one can have a feel that they are in a different Kolkata. My personal favourite is the Daab (Tender Coconut) Sherbet which you cant have one, you will definitely indulge into a second helping. They do serve sherbets without ice during most of the times in a year (not during Durga Puja though), so people with sore throats can also enjoy.

And in the restaurant business, customer satisfaction is highly sought, and Paramount is a pioneer in this. We wanted to have a second helping of the daab sherbet, but they ran out of coconuts. The lady who runs the place, took in the stride and made sure that we have another round of daab sherbet before we leave. I was appalled by this gesture, and my respect for this place increased 10 folds. You can also have sherbets take away, which they separately pack in a bottle for you. 

Paramount should be in the bucket list of all the citizenry of City of Joy and anyone who visits Kolkata.

Sarbat quality is nice .

Probably one of the best places for sarbat in kolkata .

The place has seating capacity of 15 to 20 people . In the restaurant their are a lot of old newspaper cut outs about paramount is shown. 

The only negative is they add around 50% of the sarbat with ice and if you ask them to make it without ice then they charge you extra which was not at all acceptable to me.

I've been here so many times that I've lost count. Situated quite near to my university, I always make it a point to visit this outlet once in a month. This legendary outlet have been frequented by the stalwarts of Bengal. It's always a pleasure to come back to this place time and again. I've earlier tried the kaala khatta,rose syrup(both cream and water based) and pineapple juice. Well, what I can say about the taste or quality? Paramount have always excelled both quality and quantity wise. This place always marks a place in the must-visit list of all the foodies out there.  Recently tried the passion fruit juice and green mango (both water and cream based). Obviously like always I ordered the famous Dub Sherbet, which is so refreshing after a hard day at office.
P.S - This time I discovered the dub Sherbet tastes better during the winters than in summer. üòÑ

Totally up to the mark and really good...
The very special daab sherbat is pretty good as its refreshing and contains malai, but its a litt'l bit overpriced but the other sherbats are too good and worth for money. 
I've tried mostly all of them so....
My recommendations are to try the special drinks as they are really good and better than any kfc/Mcdonald types crushers and mocktails of other restaurants....
Just worth for money sherbats... so its a go go place where u must visit for several times...

Gist : Overpriced and over hyped, still serves good juices.

Visited this place on 30.04.16 around 1.00PM. Bit tricky to find for a person who is new at college street area. Ordered Cocoa Malai, Mango Mania, Keshar Malai, Strawberry Malai. Got the drinks within 5 minutes, so service is very prompt. Place is hygienic. Drinks taste good but not great. Also expected the drinks to be much pumped with pulps. Hence overpriced ( it is justified at its 2/3rd priced at most ). But will visit again to search if any other drink tastes outstanding.

Since 1918. Needs little introduction. I have been born and brought up in the vicinity of this place, so have seen and tried it since as long as I remember. This is no ordinary juice shop, it carries a lot of tradition. As I have tried this since my childhood, l like the taste of it. This is a family business and is into their 3rd generation now. I'm a little surprised that they haven't thought of expanding and restructuring the sitting place considering the huge amount of crowd it attracts. The service is fine and so is the ambience. The quality of the juices may has become a little different now but that can be accounted to multiple factors. Somehow the taste didn't stick this time. I always prefer the kesar malai and Daab sharbat. You can also opt for the Rose flavor based drinks, those are pleasant. Located just opposite to the college square swimming club complex, Paramount perhaps believes in retaining it's rich heritage and hence hasn't gone for a makeover. I like it the way it is and will keep going back as long as it's there.

It's an heritage of Kolkata...the heaven of mocktail It can be easily located in College Street. The most striking feature of it is Coco Malai...Sweet tooth can give it a try

A very urgent visit to the main campus of my university eventually drove me to the king of "sherbat cafes" in the city of joy through brisk serpentine steps. The sunrays were not that incandescent as the vintage-lover in me was ! For a few stable seconds, the camera of nostalgia rolled on and I almost stumbled upon two teenaged love-bird who were more than occupied between themselves to pay heed to anything else. Justified and unjustified. Especially when you are in the soft - drinks bar known as Paramount. Even people who are born and brought up in the Asansol-Durgapur belt won't confuse it with the most popular local confectionery......because this strip of shop in the very midst of Bankim Chatterjee street just alongside Mahabodhi Society is way too famous, even miles away. As the glimpses of my college-days blind faded away, I was dragged to reality and found myself alone for the first time in this shop. Cut the extra-literal part though.

Although I have planned and replanned to get truly enlightened with these strange delicacies newly introduced called "Passion of fruits" and "Litchi lassi", I geared up my extra-foodie genes to devour "Cocoa malai", my all-time favourite after "Dub-sarbat" and "Green mango lassi". As my eyes touched the left walls, the glamorous tabulation of their "ek-se-barkar ek" visitors from Day1 kicked my senses and hard-pinched the happy-go-lucky human being inside me.....and I remembered the jokes we shared that who amongst us would end up having his/her name enlisted over that antique chart. 

Did our beloved ex-captain of the cricket team ever dream of this honour? ?

I left with a rare pleasant smile with this thought in mind!

When it comes to juices and mocktails and sherbats, this is miles ahead from any other such joints in the city. nothing fancy and catchy, this is all heritage oozing out with over 100 years on their back.

the cocoa malai and dab sherbat are like pure ecstasy, in a glass, in this case.
Service during the crowd can be a hindrance and never ever have i seen their quality falter a bit

Why waste money in ccd's and barista when you have Paramount in town. This place is a heritage located in College Street since time immemorial and kaku will greet you with a very genuine smile. No it has nothing to do with ambience, nothing to do with fancy umbrella glasses but what matters is QUALITY at its Best. They dont ask tax vat from you like ccd does for some extra choco chips? Must try is #dabsherbat #vanilamalai ‚ù§

Leaves you in the same effect as Coffee House does irrespective of the food though.

My head bows down in shame realising that this was the first time I visited Paramount. The name which is synonymous to college street after books. But glad that I visited this at last and I visited this twice in 3 days now. Hoping to keep up this strike rate and make up for all these years of not going. 
The Sarbats out here are pretty different and hence it's uniqueness. The inclusions of rubri, cashew , raisins , almond actually do the trick. 
I am yet to try out all but so far whatever I have had like Dab Sarbat, Cocoa Malai, Mango Malai , kesar Malai ... all are unique in its own way. Any visit to College street without a visit to this place will remain incomplete. I am sure most of you have already been here. But if any one is yet to venture here .. please do so ASAP.

Went here after a great beef lunch at a nameless, hole-in-the-wall eatery at Chandni Chowk with my partner.
We ordered a vanilla cream lassi and of course the daab sharbat.
The former was a creamy, frothy, smooth delight. The latter is history servd in a glass, so any comment will not match up to its stature.
This place speaks to me, it is not just a place to drink juices and sherbets, it is an EXPERIENCE.

It is definitely one of the oldest shops of kolkata. Best place to have nice cold and creamy shorbets. The dab (coconut) shorbet is blissüíñ and if i am not wrong it is the best selling shorbet of the shop. I liked the green mango shorbet too even they make good cold coffee. The behaviour of the staffs are very good. It is a small shop which is definitely a heritage of north Kolkata.

This place was definitely on my priority list after i got admission in cu college street campus.O ne of the legendary sherbat shops where natural ingredients are used.
Though i went their with such a high expectations but unfortunately landed up saying it was ok.
We ordered dab sherbat,kesar malai lassi,and cocoa malai.
Dab sherbat was definitely refreshing and we again went for another round,kesar malai was ok ok but the sherbat which really disappointed us was cocoa malai.To be very honest it tasted like bournvita with almonds in it.
Everyone must visit their once in their lifetime but I would definitely not think about twice.

Fabulous. Kolkata's very own Prakash Kulfi, though existing since ages before the great Kulfi maker in Lucknow. They share a commonality; gaining legendary status selling a very ordinary food article. Been there ages ago so don't remember what I had but had many things which were all fab, particularly the dab sherbet. If you are in the vicinity, never forget to drop in.

As you enter this sherbet place, you get to see names of all eminent personalities who visited this place which includes Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. Prices are reasonable and Quality is excellent, though service can be improved. I went with my college friends and we ordered dab sherbet, cocoa malai, banana malai, tamarind juice, grapes syrup and mango rabri shake. Dab sherbet and Tamarind juice had a very refreshing taste and unique touch. Highlight was Malai which was very delicious. Mango rabri shake was however, a disappointment. 
All in all, its a must visit place.

This one's a part of the induction process when you are studying in presidency. I remember my senior taking me here and ordering the grape juice for me. It was the most disgusting thing I had ever had but because I could keep it down I was declared worthy of being a presidencian. The dab sarbat here is a must have on a sultry summer afternoon , there is not much in the name of decor or ambiance but it is full of character. The man behind the counter is quite the story teller too.

All of the sherbets have their own unique flavors... This place is a must visit for varieties of sherbets! :) I'd like to visit again!

Old is actually Gold and this place has been proving this even in today's time of Facebook, Whatsapp etc, when people are so busy as to be sitting at home and ordering food via Zomato, you will still find this place cramped and budging with young & old alike.

"The Dab-Shorbot" or Coconut drink is quite famous and comes as cheap as only Rs. 50. Being in proximity to the Calcutta Uni and other colleges its very popular amongst college goers. At its peak time one can easily expect wait times of 30 mins or so (not just to find a seat but to get their take-away delivered as well).

Simply walking into this ancient, albeit cramped room, and sitting on the benches once occupied by eminent personalities, makes you feel connected to this city's history.
Famous for its "daab-shorbot" or coconut-milk sorbet, it's not at all uncommon to find majority of the tables having at least one of those.
Forget all Kolkatans, this place should be on the "must visit" list for all foodies across the planet!

I personally feel that the college street area lacks good restaurants and cafes. There are merely one or two reliable options to chill out after a hectic college day. Paramount is no doubt one of them. I have visited this place for numerous times and tried almost all varieties of sarbets. The grape crush and passion fruit(contains rabri) are my favourites. I don't like the cocoa malai and dab sharbat much. Although these two are considered to be their best productions!!

Although it's been long that I visited this place , I still remember the place vividly. The cocoa malai and Daab Malai used to be my favourite. But I think their menu has undergone some changes and prices have gone up as well. Would like to pay another visit soon.

This is a legendary place. It's located in the heart of College Street and is a must visit for all the people of Kolkata. They serve great sherbets,Lassis and syrups. I have tried almost 5 flavours by now and have never been disappointed once. 
However, this place is antiquated and seems like an anachronism in the year 2016.

It's very clumsy and dilapidated. The inside of it is very small and there is hardly any place to sit during rush hour. They don't accept cards and don't even intend to despite the enormous daily footfall.
Apart from the drinks there's nothing else to offer here. So, for everyone else still living in the past and suffering from the Golden age syndrome this place is an epitome of awesomeness. But as a realist I simply cannot be blind to the shortcomings of this place.

What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said? Nothing I guess. Nevertheless, this little establishment is legendary. It has stood for generations. The fame it has acquired over the decades is both deserving and indisputable. This place is quite easy to find. If you're travelling by metro, just get down at MG road and make your way to college street. Once you're there ask somebody about this place and they'll be happy to guide you (Every tom, dick and harry at college street knows about this place). I've had the opportunity to visit this place quite a few times and never once have I felt disappointed. I've always had their famous Daab Sherbet although now I feel I should've tried something else as well. The drink was satisfying as always. You should definitely try out this place if you're in the neighborhood.

This legendary outlet is situated at the opposite side of the College Square backside, serving the Sarbats and syrups for decades. This is a common place for all the students who visit College Street. 

We tried : Their famous Daab Sarbat(Coconut water, Coconut pulp and ice mix), Rose cream and Pineapple Cream.

 All the items were delicious and refreshing. One thing for sure that you will not regret your visit there.
This is a must visit place for all, both who lives in the city and also for the people who come to visit the city...........

Visited this nostalgia with a friend of mine. It isn't quite the looker though, on the core side of its serving, it definitely takes the cake. I was looking for the, much famed, dub sherbet, but was out of luck, it was already sold out for the day, so my friend took the orange syrup dahi based, and I tried the cocoa malai.
The overall experience was pleasant with the refreshments being well done. Most notably immediately as you enter you will be overcome by the aroma of the different syrups and rose water in the air.
The crowd seems like this place is frequented mostly by loyalties who have grown up with this place and the persons serving seems to know them pretty well, from the looks of it.
Definitely worth a visit whether you are there for a cool refreshment or just to sit on those benches where some of the who's who might have been.

It was good to be in the atmosphere where once legends had come to sit. The place is historic and if you like to feel and  visit the places which once served as 'adda' for our freedom fighters, I recommend this place. The idea of making a small cafe out it is brilliant and fascinating.
Was recommended by a friend, since I am not a resident of Kolkata.
Had dabh sharbat, which happens to be very famous drink here and it was just up to the expectation!

A heritage place in North Calcutta, this place undoubtedly serves the best Sherbats. The well known Daab Sarbat is heavenly. Apart from this the Kesar Malai is equally tasty. However the place is not hygienic at all. The way ice chunks are casually kept , hygiene is a big factor.

The place is okayish. There's such a huge hype about Paramount but the place didn't seem that appealing to me. We ordered a daab sherbet and a lassi. Both of them were mediocre. The daab sherbet tasted like normal tender coconut water. The place is overrated.

A heritage place of North Calcutta, undoubtedly serving the best beverage items in the city. Try the most recommended Dub Sarbat, Green Mango Sherbet, Kesar Malai, The Rose Malai...in short, visit in a while and try everything. They give you a level of experience in a price you can't believe. However i feel the crunch is with the space which is indeed very small to accommodate such heavy amount of crowd. If they could extend a little that would help visitors to enjoy in this legendary place.

Paramount means nostralgia. It's an old Calcutta classic you can't miss whether you are a Bengali or not. A place run by generations offers great sherbats. 

Ambience 4/5 for continuing the old charm
Taste 4.5/5 - for the regular ones as well as the chartbusters like coconut sherbat & coco malai.

The last time that I had it was almost eight months back but the taste is fresh in my mind.
It like a veranda of a house with benches and desks in it.
A long list of names of legendary people who visited this place can be found on your right.
The Dab Sherbat is very famous however I did not like it.
Do try the kesar malai.
The service is quick.
The price range is absolutely fine. :)

In front of the names who have praised this legendary place, my review seems entirely banal. Still, the green mango one is the closest to my heart. The passion fruit one is also fantastic.

This place is a heritage for the North Calcuttan people. I hear them often bragging of this place. It was pretty displeasing for all that I didnt try this place at all. 

So, I headed to this outlet and tried out Daab sarbat, Grape crush, orange syrup and green mango. All ranged within 40-60. Daab one was pretty simple and grape one was absolutely like a tonic. The rest two lived upto my expectations.

They have a wide range and tastes really vary from one another. Me being a dessert and drinks lover would definitely love to recommend and turn up as well.

The owner lady is very friendly and helped us choose drinks. There's a list of all famous personalities who have been here. The lady was enthusiastic about it. And yeah, It was a nice experience altogether.

I'm not sure if one should put up a review after a one-time visit to any joint, though I'm doing this. I mean unless that one time encounter encompasses major items worth expressing your views about.
Anyway, visiting this legendary outlet didn't make me ride a feels trip, tbh. It was fine, incredibly normal joint.
But it's true about that, about beating the summer heat, like Zomato says.
Tasted two off the list, Cream Green Mango and Strawberry Syrup. Both were satisfying to the core.
The raw freshness of green mango along with acidic sweet curd could tag well along with the astringent tangy flavour of strawberries. Beautifully blended, thoroughly cooled and freshly served.
One thing I'd like to say, so many customers, such a hyped up place (well deserving, I guess), probably they should think about the space congestion really.

This is an amazing "concoction" of flavours. Literally. Again, a historical legacy of the city of joy, you will definitely fall for its drinks. Cocoa-malai is a hot favourite with many.

I have never had anything of this standard anywhere before. The Daab Sherbet and the Cream Green Mango were the ones I had in my first visit and i was absolutely delighted with the taste I had. For anyone who loves to go around trying new things to taste, this is one place you should definitely visit and trust me, you will never come away with any feeling other than being delighted.

If you are travelling through College Street on a hot Summer day, Paramount should be your pit stop. Quench your thirst with the legendary Daab (coconut) sherbet. Or the green mango. Or the coco-malai. Wait, it's really difficult to choose. I think you should try all of them once.

No review needed for the best.. the best sherbet parlour of all time. The cocoa malai,  the kesar malai, the super refreshing dub sherbet. The best of all time.. well, nothing more to say.. its a legend itself. The cocoa malai is a must try for chocolate lovers like me. The dub sherbet is extremely refreshing. It basically contains flavoured coconut water with chunks of malai in it which is apt for the tiring summer season. The kesar malai is also amazing. With creamy rubri, dates, cashew, and kesar. It is just awesome. A must try for all..

Cold drinks and syrups, best in town- next to none, proclaims the signboard outside. The claim is quite justified. Located on Bankim Chatterjee Street, just behind College Square, this is a historic place. My favourite is the Coco Malai, which is a cold chocolate drink loaded with dry fruits and with thick sweetened cream floating on top. This drink comes with both a straw to sip the drink, and a spoon to scoop out the solid goodies. When you think you have finished, if you fish among the ice chips at the bottom of the glass you are sure to find one or two pieces of nut. It is absolute heaven served in a glass. On a hot summer day, if you are both hungry and thirsty, coco malai is the perfect solution to all your troubles. It has always been the most expensive drink on the menu, the cheapest that I remember paying for it is Rs. 30, which has now increased to Rs. 100. However, the last time I went there I saw a new item on the menu called Passion Fruit which is even more expensive and the description says that it is made with rabri. I will definitely try that one day.
The less expensive drinks are also extremely popular- the daab sherbet particularly. The pineapple crush, green mango etc are curd based drinks. Though sometimes forced to drink these when I dont carry enough dough for the coco malai, I am not too fond of these myself because they all use a flavoured syrup which I find a little too sweet.
Paramount is a tiny little shop always buzzing with customers, but I have never seen the staff take more than 5 minutes to serve. It is quite an amazing place and if you do not visit it at least one in your life you have no idea what you are missing.

Each time I try a new one and all of them are invariably good.
They also provide bottles of syrup and sherbets if you want  savour the refreshing taste sitting at home.

Exclusive and innovative menu items. taste is no doubt out of the world. general, casual, limited seating on benches from the olden days, which I loved a lot. nothing fancy, but very nostalgic with old Calcutta charm. this gels v well with the locality.

Reasonable price, but could be a bit cheaper, given the setup and college/student locality.
The toppings are too less, compared to the price of the items. The quantity of toppings really need to increase.

Now about the Sherbats, we ordered the famous Dab sherbat and Khus sherbat... I had high expectation from this place. So I didn't like Dab sherbat that much.. I don't know it had some kind of artifitial essens may be... I liked the Khas sherbat.

My visit to College Street is incomplete without a glass of sherbet from Paramount. I first went there almost a decade ago with friends after college or something. Though I do not frequent the place much, but every time I go there I feel happy and refreshed. It has a charm that its casts upon the visitors.

Yesterday I went to Paramount and I had a glass of Dub Sherbet and my companion had Passion Fruits. Yes, we tasted each others drink, because it is so irresistible. 

I want to know the secret ingredient that makes Dub Sherbet so heavenly. Waiting to visit again!

It's all about nostalgia. I visited this place for the first time with my dad, (I don't remember much though) later I have explored this place several times. Their daab sharbat is somewhat legendary. But I must admit, I can order anything from the list with my eyes closed. This place reminds me of Kolkata at its best. College street, the smell of books, and Paramount's daab sharbat. I strongly demand that it should be given a heritage label ( and i am looking forward to try that daab sharbat thingy with vodka someday, too üòã)

College street is incomplete without Paramount. In the hot summer days of Kolkata when the sun has no mercy over the poor Kolkatans this is the ultimate place to just take a break and have a nice Sherbat. Located in the heart of College Street this is a common place for the numerous students who visit 'Boi para'. People and Foodies from around Kolkata and India have come here and had there say which was mostly positive. After the coffee house this is the place which puts college street on the foodie's map. I generally love anything so i am not mentioning any favourites and specials. Do try out if you ever visit Central Kolkata or College street.

I bet this place is loved by my fellow kolkatans who have been here at least once. It is opposite to the college square pool (location of a famous durga puja too!) and isn't difficult to locate. It is dedicated to quench the thirst of the Kolkata people with their innovative and tasty sharbats. Worth mentioning is daab sharbat which is my personal favorite. Apart from that, I have also tasted the kesar malai n the cocoa malai sharbat and like these two too! I feel every other sharbat in the men is worth giving a try.

This place has lots of memories connected to my college days. I still remember going to College street for buying books and the whole tour would start with an adda at Paramount. 

Do not expect CCD type atmosphere, it is mostly suited to the likes of college goers and adda groups. 

It would sound like a cliche but going to Paramount and not ordering a glass of Dub Sharbat is a sin. Apart from that, try any of the malai combo and rest assured to find a dollop of khowa, kheer, malai and load of dry fruits.

If you still haven't tried it, just make sure you drop by. People who have difficulty finding the place can ask anybody once they reach college street.

The sherbats here have a kind of an identity of their own. I make it a point to visit this place whenever I happen to be in the college Street area. A hidden gem behind college square, Paramount is a must visit!
P.S. You'd probably have to wait to get a seat here, but the wait is absolutely worth it!

If you are looking for the best daab sherbet, Paramount is your answer. A small shop in college square, which blends well with the surrounding. Had tried their pineapple cream sherbet once but was not satisfied. But if you stick to green mango and daab sherbet, believe me you will not regret your visit there. Frequented by college students, the ambience is perfect for an adda. The staffs are okay and the service is quick. But if you are accustomed to only ccds and baristas you will not like this place. But do pay a visit and try their daab sherbet. Its yummy.

Paramount is very famous name for Lassi, Sarbat destination in Boi Para Area(College Street). Situated just behind of College Square Swimming pool and beside of Calcutta University Hall.

It is one of a legendary Lassi Destination, which doesn‚Äôt need any special intro and still operating from generation to generation for many years.

They served various kinda Sarbat, Lassi, Malai for many years. During my school life they had only few types of lassi, but the list is grown up with some good combination of lassi,.The main thing about their specialty is, the doesn't add any kinda preservative or color. So what you get is a total healthy and natural drinks.

Among all of them, Dab Sarbat is one my personal favorite sarbat out there. Served with Dab water, Dub Pulp and ice make this sarbat really healthy and refreshing also.

Green mango Lassi is also my very personal favorite lassi out there. Served with curd and green mango flavor and ice, which is really very tasty.

Coco Malai is the most expensive one among all sarbat. This is also a very unique one. You can try it.

¬†Ambiance is totally retro type, not so fancy. Basic table chair sitting. The place can hold a capacity of 25 Persons. Stuffs are very quick in serving your drink. Overall a very nostalgic experience.

Don't go expecting anything less than deliciousness, 'cause you'll receive just that. This is one of those places, where you can feel years of history in the walls and the benches. Don't go in expecting decors and all that shiz, you won't get that! 

I've been there twice, and ordered the Cocoa Malai, Kesar Malai, Mango Mania,Dub Sarbat.

The Cocoa Malai is for chocolate lovers like me. It has a distinct Cadbury taste with generous amount of nuts and raisins. I'd have it time and again! It is quite filling and serves almost as a meal!

The Mango Mania is another super heavy shake with Rubri and nuts!! The mango flavour works very well with Rubri! Give this one a try with empty stomach and you'll enjoy this! 

Kesar Malai is the one with subtle flavour and classic Paramount feels.. 

Dab Sarbat.. Now this is the one with the utmost hype and you get why. On a hot sweaty day, after a haggle at College Street, this is the best thing that can happen to you! Coconut water, Soda, Basil and Mint in a perfect blend, what more can you ask for?!

This place has been, is and will be a part of Kolkata. Respect it!

Somehow, I always felt, there lies multiple Calcutta inside our very own Kolkata. The city with its old world charm has always fascinated me along with the new-age facilities. In this hot scorching Indian summer, while finding a good cool drinks place, either we tend to end up at those numerous coffee shops with a glass of their unnecessarily pricey cold coffees/ smoothies or some lassi shops. But, where does Kolkata has to contribute here ? In this post, we‚Äôll be finding and discussing probably the oldest sherbet shop in Kolkata, who is still giving tough competition (with its very limited capacity and one of the strongest fan-base) to the above two- the Paramount.

Paramount lies at the corner of Collage square on Bankim Chatterjee St, just after the Mahabodhi Society. Its generally open throughout the year (because of strong customer demand) from Monday- Saturday 11 AM-9 PM. The good part of these bengali food joints is, as soon as you enter, you magically get transported to some magical era of old-world charm, an era where people used to be polite and a certain ‚ÄúBhodrota‚Äù/ subtlety used to surround them. Such is this place. The place is a small room with stone-top tables and chairs. In the billing counter, you can find a small, fragile lady taking care of the billing needs. This place seems to be one of those very few place in Kolkata, where the entire operation is taken care by the Majumder family members and not depending on the external resources-thus keeping a strong check on the quality.

Once you settle down on those rickety wooden benches, you‚Äôll be asked for your choice and mind it, the server gentleman will expect you to know your choice without even looking at the elaborate menu Now, that‚Äôs the way it works here and after running the establishment for almost 100 years, it can‚Äôt be changed. At this point of time, trust me and go for their Dub sherbet. at least to buy you the time to think for the next items. Its pure orgasm. Dub water and vanilla flavored sherbet with tender coconut extracts floating, you‚Äôll need a spoon (which actually they provide) with the straw. Leave the straw and sip secretly wishing, you could‚Äôve mixed with a little vodka. Worry not traveller, you can buy this thing home in their nice packaging and can have it with a dash of Smirnoff.

Once you‚Äôre through with their thin sherbets, yo may like to move on to their cream based malai segment and in this scorching summer, what better than mango malai ? Again, you‚Äôll be tempted for Cocoa malai and Vanilla malai, so I would suggest to go in a group (at least with few of GF/ BF‚Äôs- to split the offerings). All are good, but I have a special soft spot for Mango Malai. But frankly, I didn‚Äôt like the dry fruits of top (more kinda non-bong touch), otherwise brilliant.

But, after all this sweetness, you might link something less sweet and the management has though of that also, the have tamarind sherbet and green mango. The tamarind and green mango extract is produced in-house and hence free from all harmful ingredients. The Tamarind sherbet is more tangy and spicy lovemaking (its a make or break situation) wherein Green Mango is more like a subtle first kiss with curd base with the extract.

¬†Tamarind sharbat Green mango sharbat

By this time, you should be quite full (both appetite-wise and pocket-pinch-wise). Let me warn, none of these items are cheap, by any means but the cost is justified. Where else, you can get a shop dedicated to sherbet, with proper seating arrangement, a waiter and a proper billing system ? People has been enjoying their favorites here from decades and Majumder family has been servicing them since them, knowing their individual preferences. So, let‚Äôs join in and enjoy

Paramount, a name that oozes heritage and nostalgia. If you are new to Kolkata this place is a must visit. If you are already in Kolkata, it is a shame if you haven‚Äôt already been there.

Located towards the end of college square, this tiny sit down eatery that serves only cold beverages has been around for over a century now. The place is a legend when it comes to sherbats and syrups.

Their traditional cocoa malai and daab sherbet still holds on to the charm as it did years ago. The consistency in flavour and taste, and the warmth of the family members of this family run place will make your heart melt.

We loved the fact that they connect well with all the customers in spite of the constant rush. We were overwhelmed when the old man for the family insisted that we try litchee tamarind and we were not disappointed that we did. Crushed grapes was the another favourite that we devoured before we decided that finally our hearts were full.

This place redefines nostalgia. Dingy, old, no decor, hasty service, often overcrowded with foodies who wants their taste buds to have a blast. You can't just miss any of the items, be it the tender coconut (dub) sherbet, mango malai, rose malai, cocoa malai, green mango cream, or passion fruit malai. And mind you, you can never have just one. ;-)

Being a student of Medical College and staying in the college hostel, for a 'College Para' resident like me, this is a frequent place of visit. And boy, do I like it. As it rightly says in its signboard- "Best in town- Next to none".
I won't start blabbering about the quality of the drinks. The long period for which this place is running and the names and pictures of the eminent personalities that adorn the wall will tell you much about it. And the fact that whenever some friend comes to meet me in the college, the first place that pops up in our head to go and have a drink and a chat is Paramount.Okay, I can't refrain anymore from commenting. No blabbering, just a little one. The Sherbats are AWESOME.
Not only a god place for a drink, but also for a good chat. This place is a must visit for all.

Tucked away inside the bylane right across College Square, I visited this place after a quiz at CMC after multiple failed plans. We ordered the Kesar Lassi, Daab Sharbat and the Cream Green Mango. The Daab Sharbat is a must try, a critiques favourite, as it leaves the taste of Coconut after the filling sip. The Cream Kesar Lassi was my personal favourite, very well made and with an aftertaste that leaves one craving for more. I'll give this one a rare 5star.

The fact that Paramount has a proper outlet having proper seating arrangements selling ONLY cold beverages, proclaims that it is hands down a big name in the food world. Located at the posterior of College Square, this is another bearer of the legacy of Kolkata. With wooden furnitures from pre-independence era, this place demands respect for the time it has been sustaining into the geography of food retail world.¬†
I had been there for a casual visit and had Cocoa Malai and Cream Green Mango. Cocoa Malai was simply ecstatic and I would pay anything to have that again. The Cream Green Mango was okayish though. I would definitely come back again and would always recommend this place.

This legendary place deserves all the accolades due to it. The ambience reminds one of old Bengali environment, complete with a stag horn. 
The drinks available here are one of a kind, having a distinct Kolkata taste. 
My personal favourite is the Cream Green Mango...people who prefer a sweet & slightly tangy taste should definitely go for this. For Chocolate lovers there is the Cocoa Malai, topped with malai and dry fruits. Kids will absolutely love Cream Vanilla.
All the items are worth tasting and the place is very pocket friendly. Behaviour of the staff and management along with owners are quite warm. 
A must visit place, specially if one is in the college street area.

This place is nothing short of legendary. It's still frozen in time and has the old world charm preserved.Located just a few minutes away from the Indian Coffee House, Paramount sherbats and syrups has been serving some tantalizing coolers since 1918. ¬†The sitting arrangement is not something to boast about but then you won't complain once you have taken a sip of their sherbat once.¬†I personally loved the coconut sherbat and the Litchee sherbat and are top notch. There are plenty of options to choose from of course.¬†So next time you visit COLLEGE STREET, do remember to drop by this legendary place.

Whenever in and around college street (which, sadly is not very often), I make it a point to drop by this place to stock up for the next couple of months on those beautiful syrups they sell in bottles. While they get me my bottles, I quickly settle upon some of the best sherbets this place has to offer. My favorite of course is the dab sherbet. I just cannot get enough of it. Other favorites include, the kesar malai and the green mango.

We generally opt for the extremely good Orange syrup, Green mango syrup, Daber sharbat and Malai drinks. Had almost all the types. It's a nice place to hangout with your friends and have "sarbat" pe baat. Do visit this place again and again. Thandak pouhchegi.. ;-)

Paramount, as the name suggests offers high quality sharbat and syrups. Many famous people were regular visitors of this place. It also created its own legacy by serving from a very old time. The staff are very courteous and very pro-active. You should try Daab Sharbat, Green Mango Syrup, Cocoa Malai  and don't forget to bring a bottle of it when you are coming back at home. Enjoy your sip!!!

At first , you guys should know the proper landmark is Umesh Chandra College , not the College Square . You can also remember the place as it is situated near the legendary sweet factory Putiram . Now , review time ! You might be a feminist , but not enough recharged to maintain the heritage . Tried malai cocoa there . I couldn't search the malai . It was only ice with 2 piece of almond . And yes , a tablespoon of kheer . If you're a ice-lover , then carry on . But not the proper place for the sherbats lover . I hope they will be back soon to there proper quality and the old recipes , with not much of ice . Thank You :)

Been here with my friend as a result of the many recommendations of my friends.
We tried their signature ,the dub sarbat :) which costs ‚Çπ50 which seems to be a very nominal amount but in comparison to what they give it's too much.It's simple coconut water with a bit of rose syrup :)
It's a good place except the fact that it's highly overrated .
Thumbs up üëç

Well, this review is long due.
Location:Behind College square, in the lane of the University Institute Hall. 
This place needs no introduction.It's a legendary place & visiting this place since my university days. 
Their speciality & one of the best is 'Daab Shorbot', a must try for new goers. 
All the other syrup, curd based & milk based ones are also pretty good, only they're heavier.

Whenever I visit College Street I make it a point to visit Paramount - the one-stop shop for sherbets in Kolkata . Paramount is a 98 years old sherbet joint that boasts of a rich heritage that very few places in the city can match up to. It is declared as a Heritage building/shop by Kolkata Municipal Corporation. 

The most popular and the best sherbet in Paramount is the¬†Daber Shorbot¬†- a¬†Sharbetmade of tender coconut water, ice, syrup and the white meat/pulp of the coconut. Once you take a sip of Daber¬†Sharbat¬†you will understand why people prefer Paramount's¬†Sherbet¬†than any regular soft drinks to quench their thirst.

The menu includes Green Mango, Cream Vanilla, Cocoa¬†Malai, Rose¬†Malai, Passion Fruit, Grape Crush, Strawberry¬†Malai, Tamarind and Lichi other than the famous and refreshingly delicious¬†Daaber Sharbat. I generally start with Daaber Sarbat¬†and then have other¬†Sharbets and then end with Green Mango.


So all in all Paramount is a treat to your taste buds and is a true symbol of Kolkata‚Äôs past glory and heritage. The LIVING LEGEND !

I was out with my friends and we were very tired and thirsty as it was very hot outside. So we decided to go to paramount and have some juice or sherbat.  We ordered rose malai and cold coffee. They were very cold and tasty. It was like heaven in that scorching heat. This place is considered to be as one of the heritage corner of kolkata.

The place is situated right behind College Square. And though it is not spacious enough from the outside yet quite a number of thirsty souls can be comfortably seated. The atmosphere is pretty homely and the staffs are very cordial. The service is good too. The drinks are also value for money. 

Daab sherbat, kesar lassi and cream green mango, all taste good. The first one seems a bit overrated but it‚Äôs high on demand. The Sherbats are heavier than the syrups. They also have take-away facility. 

It‚Äôs a refreshing place to be in during any season and at any time of the day!!

Great taste for great prices; applaudable quality and great service too. 
Yes, it might be only just a drinks parlour, but it's a pretty good one in that! The most appealing thing about them is the self made wide range of syrups. The fact that they make their own flavours is always a plus point. The humble atmosphere just adds to the great taste. And in the tropical climate of the city, a definitely good place to go for a drink. However, I feel they could start a take away system for those busy days. Will do a lot to boost their services. But except for that, they're pretty great I'd say. 
I had a great experience, will definitely go back.

Its one of the most traditional places of Kolkata. People have been relishing its sherbats & syrups from 1918. You may not find some super cozy decor but you will get some mouth watering sherbats. I went there many times but once I went there during Durgapuja (on sashthi) and we two had to wait for half an hour to get seats. I really like their Dub Sherbat, Green Mango Sherbat, Rose lassi. Grapes crush sherbat is not that good.

Paramount is one of the living legend on the serbat and syrup parlour in Kolkata.
Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose to Sourav Ganguli, Rabindranath Thakur to Soumitra chatterjee, every single person' name was attached on their visitors list on the wall.

You can see all over serbats and syrup everywhere on that place.

‚óèMango mania was made of Rabri, raisin and kaju with mango juice (No synthetic syrup). Excellent taste.
‚óèCocoa Malai was also made of same ingredients but there was cocoa instead of Mango juice. „ÄãBrilliant„Ää
‚óèDab serbat famous and must try here. Great one again.
‚óèCream Orange was only one thing that I dont like.. Made of orange juice with curd.

There was no deco and ambiance. But seriously who cares. Very much value for money items. Cost of those drinks only 290 INR all inclusive.

The location, the rich heritage, the ambiance, the d√©cor (that is simple yet elegant). The sherbats are amazing. Cocoa malai and cream rose and rose malai remain my favourite till this day. Every time I'm near college Street, I never miss a chance to visit this place.

Paramount is a stone throw away from my home. I have been visiting this place since my childhood. And I take great offense if someone says it is hyped or what not! The line on the hot summer days always prove the haters wrong. But as the saying goes haters gonna hate and the potatoes gonna potatet. :-P
PJs apart you have to come here once. I am not a curd fan so I will not be commenting on the curd based drinks. I am a die hard fan of the cocomalai. Now Rs 100 a glass. It is a pocket pinch. U started having this when it was rs 25 a glass so I completely feel it when my father says things during his time were so cheap. But then again to enjoy good things in life one has to shell out.

CocoaMalai:- must try for everyone. A chocolate based drink topped with a thick layer of malai and cashews and raisins. Scoop the malai with the spoon and slurp on the drink. When the small cashew pieces block your straw, blow on it once. :-P it works. 

Cold coffee:- another classic. It tastes like normal cold coffee but not thinned down with water. 

They had introduced a tamarind drink. Mind blowing. If you like phuchka water then you would love this one. Chilled tamarind drink. Perfect for this weather. 
 This is a must visit for all the foodies.

But everytime i take a long, tiring walk from sealdah to college street- i always feel that this place deserves it. The staff and manager are well behaved. The woman at the desk smiles everytime we go there. Its simply a great place.

Just to check why the place has so much name and fame, I was eager to go to Paramount, opposite of College Square at Bankim Chandra Street near College street... and I have visited there finally to have refreshing sorbets...
Though the place is small, it has an old age heritage... Many famous personalities in recent history had visited here at least once...
We had
Kesar Malai
Dub Sorbet
Cream Green Mango

All three were awesome... Kesar malai had a thick layer of rubri and khir on it and tasted really good... Dub Sorbet is one of their speciality... It was very refreshing and also had dub malai on it...
Green mango with a cream on it was also lip smacking...
Service was quick and friendly...

The drinks here are very soothing if you know what I mean.. and if you don't then go visit this place and you will know..

One minor inconvenience is that the place is a bit small and you have to wait for a while before you can find a place to sit. But trust me the wait is totally worth it!

Located near college street! This outlet is very small consisting of bench like sitting for almost 20-25 person. This place has got no special ambiance but has got a very glorious history. Coming to the beverages, this place serves some awesome 'trust-quenchers' like 'Dab Sarbaut and 'Green Mango Sarbaut' but their qualities are not consistent, thats' a major drawback. I was served with over chilled ' Dab Sarbaut ' which is absolute not worth paying 50 bucks. And again on the prop's side it served some awesome banana smoothie( I don't remember the exact name). ¬†Though it's a decade old place but they should work on the improvement of menu and ambiance. Will be visiting this place soon. Expecting changes but I don't think it will change.

Food- Sherbats at their best. In these hot summer days if you need a place to take some rest and you are near this place just pay them a visit.¬†

Dab sherbat is one of the best items.

Others- The place is small. Most of the cases you need to wait to get a seat. Service is good. You will get to see names of famous people who paid them a visit.

This place is older than even my father,n once inside, you immediately get hit by a full century worth of nostalgia. Memories of a pretty long existence,of all the dignitaries who have graced this place and of this very old city called Calcutta. They have still maintained the old decor and the home like environment, which is in stark contrast to the utterly corporate treatment that we are so used to these days. Finally I don't think I am qualified enough to rate a place like this. May Paramount endure for centuries more, representing the old Calcutta charm for kids like me to experience.

Nothing compares to this quaint litlle old world outlet which serves the most exotic drinks (read non-alcoholic) and no matter what time of day you go, they are always bustling and busy!! Had the Cocoa Malai and Daab Sherbet and needless to say I was on cloud # 9. To be successfully running for 98 plus years I guess one needs to know what clicks and what doesn't and I can safely say that Paramount is doing everything right!!!

The place is going to mark its Centennial year, come 2018. It is undoubtedly the avante garde of Sherbats in the town. Having situated at an amazing location, right besides College Square Swimming Club; heritage simply overflows through the brick and mortar here. 

The sherbats were pure and so refreshing. We ordered for Kesar Malai and Dab Sherbat, both of which were very delicious. However I would have prefered a somewhat thicker consistency for the Kesar Malai given the pricetag attached to it. Dab Sherbat was awesome. There was a piece of coconut put into the bottom of the glass which concluded the drink with a pleasant munch.

I would definitely like to indulge myself to all the other drinks in the menu. The place is on a must visit and a revisit list.

Kolkata without College street is incomplete and Paramount became one of my habit in college street. In the scorching heat of summer, Paramount's Daab Sherbet always quenches my thirst. But every item that I have tried is delicious beyond any competition. Paramount is such a place in Kolkata should not be missed. The only drawback of this beautiful hangout place is the shortage of space. But still it is an incomparably must visit place in Kolkata.

One of the legendary places in the city of joy. Every sherbat lovers must come here atleast once in their life, then you will feel an utmost thirst to come back here everytime you be in college street region. This place is a heritage of Kolkata. Paramount will never ever disappoint you with their wide range of beverages and quick service. Be it summer, be it winter, whenever I go to college street, I go to paramount to drink sherbats. My personal favourite is Dab Sherbat. I also tried Coco Malai, Kesar Malai, Cream Lemon and Cream Orange. This is an all time favourite beverage shop and always will be!

A place with loads of history, Paramount still continue to amuse visitors with its delicious and refreshing ghols. Don't know from when I am visiting this place, but never had any bad experience here.¬†

From their daab sharbat (tender coconut drink) to the cream green mango or the tamarind syrup, I love everything. The best thing here is the drinks don't taste too syrupy.¬†

Sitting arrangement is basic tables and benches (like the ones we used to sit in schools) and service is fast. The place remains full from afternoon, but if you wait for a few minutes you will get a seat somewhere. A must visit place.

I don't know how I missed to talk about Paramount... One of my favourite hangout... Visited several times. Love everything they serve here smoothies, rabri based drinks, water based everything... But Kesar Rabri smoothi and Daab sarbat is near to my heart... The sitting arrangement is not so good... Small and crowded... But once you sip into the drinks you will forget everything happening around....

Paramount has been there sitting on the east side of college square for ages... And everyone who has had anything to do with college street has been to paramount for a glass of sherbat... Whether the day is sultry or Clement is hardly the question ... I am the third generation of Paramount goer in my family... My Dadu went there during his college and university days... My mum has been going there since she was little and so have dadabhai and me!!! It is truly our family tradition.... My mum always orders the cr√®me rose and being a loyalist never ventures to the realm of unknown taste.... My favourite is Daab.... Did you know the recipe of daab was concocted by Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray himself.... For those tired students who brought their carcass to paramount to receive the kiss (read sip) of life.... My Bro has tasted everything on the menus but can't decide which one is his favourite and my dad being a fan of real sweet stuffs loves the cocoa malai....
Paramount has kept the taste and quality of their concoction same and superb through generations... And yes we can vouch for it!!! It is truly a Kolkata Heritage and what's more it is a Kolkata treasure.

Excellent extraordinary awesome, this place goes with all. Undoubtedly one of the best sharbat makers(if not the best) in Kolkata. 

This place is old fashioned, they don't have AC or comfortable cushioned chairs, but what they deliver can make u feel out of the world on a thirsty afternoon. The 'duber sharbat' is the best in my opinion followed by the cocoa malai. Kesar malai, cream lassi are amongst my other favourites, not very fond of their syrups though. 

Service is swift and ppl are friendly and helpful. The only con is u may have to wait to get a seat here, but trust me u wont regret.

Frequented by a string of celebrity guests in the past - they have a list of names of all the eminent personalities who've visited this sorbet shop - this little eatery serves really cool juices, sherbets and syrups. I'd visited this place with my classmates during my first year as an undergrad at Presidency. We'd tried their green mango syrup and daab er shorbot which were creamy, subtle, sweet and awesome. I recommend this place for anybody looking for a cool drink on a hot summer's day.

Well, this place is one among my favourites. Their sherbats are way too good. From the malais to the syrups, each and everything is very refreshing. Since, it's summer and it's the perfect time to hop in to this place if you are nearby. The Daab sherbat is my personal favourite. I tried the Strawberry malai the other day and it was very nice. 
Cheers!

A legendary sarbet parlour of Kolkata. Situated just behind the college square premises. Very popular and well known only because of their products. Very old shop. U cant expect a well decorated parlour which is so much old. They carry their own legacy. Many eminent personalities come here to enjoy their syrups. I went there 4-5 times and everytime I spell bounded. The awesome green many is my favourite.

Once upon a time, on a very hot day, I ended up in this place with a few friends. 
What I tried: Daab Sherbet, Cocoa Malai, Kesar Malai.
What I loved: Daab Sherbet. 
What you need to try: Daab Sherbet.
What you will love: Daab Sherbet. 

 Located somewhere amidst the hustle bustle of college street this place is indeed a heritage site. Not meant for typical coffee shop conversations but ideal for escaping the summer heat.

'old is gold '... this proverb goes absolutely well with this place. no matter how many other beverage shops grow inside Kolkata but no one is able to beat this place in popularity and quality. this place is just an extra ordinary one with their traditional items on the menu. I have tried their dub sarbat, cream rose,cream pineapple, cream green mango and kesar lassi.. all of them just made an permanent place in my heart. this place have been an all time favourite of mine. the old narrow lanes of College Street has many stories to tell and paramount is one of them. whenever I am at College Street, Paramount demands a must visit. neat and clean place with traditional interior. although the place sometimes remains heavily crowded in the afternoon which can make the availability of seats quite a difficult affair !! ¬†price is quite justified with the quality items served here. now I just cant wait to taste their tamarind sarbat as i have heard lots of good reviews about it.

If you are looking for awesome refreshing drinks and you are in the college street area. Look no further this place is situated just on the other side of college square,maybe couple of blocks away from mahabodhi society temple.The drinks served there taste heavenly especially if you visit after a tiring tour of college street.Me nd my friend tried rose with malai cream and orange with malai cream,both tasted class apart.Its an age old joint which still today maintains its standard.

A heritage place known for the unique sherbets. I had daab sherbet (a delightful and refreshing concoction of tender coconut water in crushed ice and a dash  of rose water with a flotsam of coconut malai). A hoarding inside claims the likes of netaji and contemporary celebraties of having visited this place.

In an age of ccds, a place like this one carves a space of its own and deserves patronage.

Some people do not need praises likewise some food establishments do not require compliments to establish their supremacy. Not that they are ¬†over-zealous about their achievements but people know the fact that they have always been that good to reign the hearts of millions of people residing in Kolkata since many years now.

In this current ultra-modernized society, when sitting on an 'Adda' implies walking into cafe's to puff over a Shisha or sipping your throats over a fancy-named Mocktails, there also exists a conservative section of people who still prefer to do things, the 'Old-Way'! Which means sitting on the roadside with a paperbag of Telebhaja in hands or sitting inside a not-so-fancy looking outlet to spend some precious time over a glass of cold 'Shorbot'!

Tucked inside one of the lanes around College Square/College Street, this is one of few shops which defined the very essence of Bangaliana. A trip to this area is not completed, unless you feed yourselves with the enticing Telebhajas at Kalika and then finish your meal with a satisfying glass of Serbats at Paramount. The history of this outlet goes way back. For some, this shop exists even before we were born.

Although the menu isn't much elaborate here, it pretty much has all the varieties one would want! Start with their refreshing Coconut (Dub) Sarbat, which is undoubtedly the biggest hit in this place. Cool sip of coconut water with chunks of 'Malai. Although, try not finish off the Malai as soon as you start. Instead keep having it as you sip your way to the bottom of the glass.

You want something exotic? Go for Passion Fruits, Coco Mania or Mango Malai. You want some curd based drinks? Go for Cream Green Mango or Cream Lassi. These people have it all. As you sit there taking all your time to enjoy the refreshments and enjoy in a conversation with your buddies, you would see names and pictures of several iconic and legendary figures who have visited here in the past and probably has enjoyed the same drinks you are feasting upon now with the same vibe and enthusiasm.

The staffs are super-friendly here and so is the owner. The charge here is pretty nominal and they also provide fresh plastic bottles at a marginal rate if you plan on packing some of their delicacies back home. The interior is nice and clean with no hygiene issues. The only con here is their heritage and popularity tag, due to which, the place gets super-flooded at times, and hence securing a seat may be the next difficult thing in the world other than to impress the girl you love!

A heritage, really! The ambience, decor, seating arrangements - doesn't matter, 'cause the quality one is getting is the only thing that matters. The sherbats do live up to their names. The Green Mango is one that can be had one after another and still you'll have some space for more. Service is fast and efficient. No need to worry about the pocket pinch at all. Definitely worth a revisit!

One of the best place specifically during summer. Staffs are really very well behaved who strongly believe customers are God theory.  Loved many items from here but 'DABER SARBAT' is my personal favorite.
Got to know some interesting stories from quite aged but still very much enthusiastic owner -
1. Prafulla Chandra Roy made the daber sarbat famous. He used to say this is milk and bread for poor people.
2. During pre independence period the kitchen portion was used by the freedom fighters for chalking out plans. While outside portion used for business to make British fool.
Always feel like home whenever visited this place.

Which Kolkata-bashi has not heard of Paramount. Situated amidst the busy streets of College Street, Paramount is a part of the heritage of Kolkata. And it's easy to see why! In these times of overprised AC coffee shops, this place is a breath of fresh air. No wonder this place is always packed. We were a group of 5 and we shared 5 drinks among us- Cocoa Malai, Mango Malai, Daab Sharbat, Lassi and Green Mango Lassi. Each tasted better than the other. The two malai drinks were packed with yummy goodness of malai and rabri, the lassi were thick and delicious but the surprise for me was the Daab Sharbat which was unbelievably refreshing. Prices are very reasonable. For all the newbies, in this coming hot summer if you ever find yourself near College Street, a trip to Paramount is must.

Undoubtedly one of the best Sharbat serving legendary places in Kolkata. Nothing much about the ambience, but, this small joint is definetly a hidden gem. A sip of Daaber Sharbat, Choco Syrup or the lassi's at Paramount is all you need to beat the heat this summer. And, it is quite affordable and a must-try. Overall, 4.0/5.0

If you are in college street and you know that you are neaby Paramount, it would be rare that you will give it a miss.¬†

Ambiance is nothing, cramped space with small tables and benches, you can choose to sit face to face or side by side. Don't get bothered if someone unknown comes and joins you in the table (concentrate on the drink please). This is an extremely busy shope specially in the summers.

Ordered Passion Fruit kesar malai and Dab sharbat. The first sip o the Passion fruit drink and it came to me how good they are, super taste, you can feel the cold rabri melt in your mouth, almonds and milk. It was awesome. Dab sharbat, tasted a bit like coconut but its a mix of coconut water, soda and ice and the malai of the dab actually adds that zing to this drink.¬†

Pocket pinch extremely reasonable. If you are in college street don't give it a miss to this legendary place.

Located just behind the college squarer ground, this place offers a wide range of sherbats which would make u feel chilled on a hot summer day. But the price is too much nowadays and the quality has also dropped drastically . The dub sherbats is ok type but the kesar malai is the best sherbat that i could find here. Being a frequent visitor have tried all their sherbats one by one but the price is too high . U can try out kesar malai as it is quite good. otherwise its ok type.

Not at all at level it is talked about. At a beverage counter people usually goes with a thrust, and here they comes with a so very late service. A beverage need 20mins to arrive at your table!! 
Pricing of the product is not also much acceptable as not any drink is exotic exclusive, neither the basic services. Spoons provided or I say they are just crossed stacked on the glass rim. Agrahhh!!! Even the Ice is not made from the drinking water.
Overall the place is a slime as No ambiance, poor service quality and questionable product quality with comparable higher side of price tags.

I prefer this the most...the taste excels in all ways...it has nuts, fruit flavored syrups and milk...its much better than any over-hyped cafes in kolkata...prices are reasonable too....besides paramount i have also tried their malai based ones and the syrup ones....the malai based are more like lassi but the flavored ones...coco malai,dab sharbat are also worth mentioning...everything tastes so yumm that no one would ever get tired of having it... :) definitely worth a visit specially when the summers are here@rohit shaw

The sherbets here are of amazing variety and are as refreshing as can be. I love their dub sherbet (made from fresh tender coconut) and their green mango drink. The sugar content needs some control sometimes but this is a legendary place and should not be missed

We visited this place on the day after Dashami,a sunny day to get some respite from the sun.The whole area was deserted as well as the shop too.We went there for Dub sherbat but unfortunately it was not available. So,we settled for Green Mango lassi  and boy,it tasted good.The lassi was so delicious that I ordered one more glass of it.My friend and I were feeling refreshed just from drinking it and it was easy on the wallet too.Next time,we go there,we will be waiting for Dub sherbat.

Sip the goodness of sherbats here at Paramount. The Cocoa Malai is there famous one, but I would suggest you to try all the sherbats because each one's special in their own way.

If you want to quench your thirst with any divine Sherbats then, this is the place to opt for. All of their sherbats are too good to have. And the special mention will be their "Daab Sarbat". That's a must have for any one. Their curd based Sarbat are also very refreshing. So be it any time or any occasion this is the place I'm looking to have Sarbat.

One of the oldest sherbat places of Kolkata.
Some of the drinks are good.
Cocoa Malai is their ace.
You can also go for Coconut Sherbat, Kesar Malai and Lassi.
Staffs are okay.

I have been in love with this place from my childhood. Whenever one is here one will find this place to be always crowded. This is absolutely a legendary place and whenever am in college street along with my friend visiting this place becomes a must requirement. My all time favourite drink is the daab sherbat and coco malai though I have tried other drinks but I prefer ordering these two often. The behavior of the owner and the staffs are wonderful which makes this place more famous and attractive.

One word is enough to describe this place. Almost a 100 years old, this place provides the best sherbet in the city... Even a cramped space can't deter it's popularity, be it for a college goer or an old-timer. Definitely a place to visit if someone comes to Kolkata.

This small, nondescript, little hole of an outlet off College Street is one of those innumerable things which makes Calcutta such an amazing city. Serving some of the best Sherbets in town, Paramount is one of the must-visit places in the city for residents and tourists alike. While one doesn‚Äôt really need to know the specials for a place like this, since no matter which drink you choose, it‚Äôs going to be a soul-pleasing, heart-soothing savior for your parched throat on a stuffy Calcutta afternoon- the Daab Sherbet deserves special mention which is a wonderful concoction of the fresh, tender, sweet Malai (Leyi- in Bengali) of a coconut and its sweet water and some of their other special syrups. The Daab Sherbet is so good that it gets sold out very fast and one has to wait a considerable amount of time before they replenish their stock and are ready to serve again. The service is fast, attentive, the seating area small and the atmosphere casual. It is one of those no-nonsense places which serves amazing stuff at throwaway prices and has a cult following not only in Calcutta but almost in the entire Bengali Diaspora. The walls of Paramount are lined with Newspaper cuttings of prominent Authors like Jhumpa Lahiri, Arundhati Roy etc. enjoying their Saab sherbet at Paramount. 

So, Paramount is not just a normal run-of-the-mill little place which serves drinks but an institution which has been a silent witness to all the rebellions rising out of neighboring Presidency College and Calcutta University.

I tried the Coco Malai sherbet which consisted of chocolate, milk and malai and was delicious and one of its kind. The Litchi Sherbet was also too good. The place also has the list of legendary people and celebrities who have visited it and that includes Satyajit Ray, Saurav Ganguly and many more such people. The staff is very helpful and courteous!

PARAMOUNT IS HERITAGE. AND I AM BIASED.
MUST TRY IS COCO MALAI AND DAB SHERBAT. (Which still come for 90 bucks and 40 bucks respectively ).
Have been coming here since I was a kid.
And since it is literally 5 minutes from my college it's a place of regular visit for me.
In the unbearable Kolkata heat and in the times of CCD and Baristas, Paramount is bliss for the soul.

Though I have visited this place for many times, somehow I missed to write about the famous beverage shop. We took the most famous Daab sherbat which is definitely fantastic as always.  We also had Green Mango Syrup which was also quite good. 

According to my own choice the taste of the raw syrup sherbats for any flavour are much better than the sherbats with curd of that flavour but it may vary person to person.

Boi para, college square and Paramount are things that you can speak of in the same breath. Obviously this place needs no introduction which makes this short review complete in itself. My personal favourites are of course the highly popular daab shorbot and cocoa malai. The only complaint I have against Paramount is that I have had to return without a shorbot several times because of a long queue outside it. I wish that that occasional disappointment could be somehow overcome.

Paramount is good, old and elegant. Situated near college square. I went there with one of my friends. We tried total 4 items. Grape crush, dav sarbat, cream green mango and cream orange. Dav sarbat was great. Cream green mango and cream orange were also good. Grape crush is good but very rich taste. So I personally do not like it.

I have always thought about visiting Paramount whenever I visited college street, but I end up spending so much on books.
This time I went to college street with a friend who had the urgency to buy books and my dream came true. This 1918 shop still gives the nostalgic vibe of the past golden days.
We ordered Dub Sherbet and Cocoa Malai.
It's inexpensive, divinely tasty, and will choke your throat if you have a tendency to catch cold, which I had by the way. Never mind.
I'll be visiting to try out the others. Can't wait. :D

If you are in College Street during a sultry summer day, this place will give you the feeling of winter by their legendary "Dub Sherbat". Personally I love the ambience. It's a quality place for quality people. May seem a bit expensive though. But as I said, it's a quality place. :-)

Paramount - its a well known name of sherbat lovers of kolkata and the number one choice too since the good old days of 1918. Every item of them is a classic gem. Most of the bengalee icons visited this place in every ‚Äòera‚Äô. Its situated beside the college square area. Its a bit hard to find now-a-days because its a small shop surrounded by piles of book shops. The shop maintains its old style ethnic beauty in its interiar decoration which carries the messege of its golden days which it is still carrying successfully. Tables are marble-top, very clean and well maintained. Waiters are very polite and helpful. In this era of various cocktails around the kolkata, this place gives you the essence of "bangaliana", in an affordable price. I was very lucky to taste ‚Äòdub (coconut) sherbat‚Äô and 'Rose Malai' here. Its just awsome. Very hard to explain the beauty of taste. I can just say that i have never even imagined that a simple coconut water can be made such a good tasty. I will try its every item later on. I will highly reccomend it to all.

For decades Paramount has quenched the thirst of college street with their sherbets & syrups. Even in the age of malls, marts and ccds, paramount leaves a long lasting impression. On two different occasions I tried out their Dab sherbet, cream lassi and passion fruit sherbat. Passion fruit sherbet was the best of the lot, both in taste and presentation. Though the seating arrangement was clumsy but the drinks made up for it. Recommended.

Whenever I am around College Street area, I try not to miss this place. Paramount has a lot of history attached to it. But what's more important is, they have managed to keep people hooked with their refreshing drinks.

Daab Sharbat is their most famous item, and according to me a must try. It is tender coconut drink with pieces of tender coconut flesh floating on it. Absolutely divine and thirst quenching.

The Ghols or the cream (curd based) drinks are next best items for me. Cream green mango and cream lemon are my personal favourits, though I love Cream orange too.

I am not a big lover of only syrup and water drinks, but love the tamarind drink from this section. Refreshing!

Passion fruit I order rarely as it is very heavy. Make sure you have an empty stomach before you order this. With Rabri and dried fruits, this is on the sweeter side too.

Most of the days I start with a Daab Sharbat and then order any two of the cream based drinks and end with another Daab, occasionally adding a tamarind in between.

This place is legendary, serving some thirst-quenching and lip smacking delicious Sherbats and shakes.

I've visited quite a few times at Paramount while strolling in College Street. Situated just beside the College Square this small place is quite ordinary with a old school feeling. But this place definitely has that old world charm to it. Till date i have not found any difference in taste of the sherbats from the one I had almost 4 years ago.
‚Ä¢
On my recent visit to Paramount I had their famous Passion Fruits. Some lovely Rabdi with some densely made sharbat. Absolutely in love with the passion fruits sharbat with the perfect mixture of cashews, almonds and raisins. The adquately thickened Rabdi adds the perfect flavour to this sweet sharbat and must be eaten along with the sherbat for the perfect experience.
‚Ä¢
The Daab Sherbat is another one which I love to the core and have it everytime I pass by this place. Last time I had their Tamarind Sherbat and Grape Crush. The Tamarind Sherbat was great with a tangy experience and a tad sweetness in it. The Grapes Crush was also great to have, after you had that hefty meal. 
‚Ä¢
Paramount Sherbats & Syrups needs no introduction among gastronomers in Kolkata. It is widely known for their old traditional sharbats, syrups & juices and all of their creations are great thirst quenchers. Service is good with the most simple seating arrangements you can imagine. Go to this legendary classic restaurant for a tasty Sheebat experience.

This place is indeed great, famous and legendary  with its epic sharbats. Though syrups can be a bit displeasing, it can be ignored against everything else they have to offer.

They use hand beaten and crushed ice for their drinks which gives a unique texture and I used to follow same trick for making lassi at home. It indeed improves your drink substantially. I had their mango malai sharbat which was thick, creamy, nutty and without a doubt, Tasty. After that I tried I went with Orange syrup drink which was a bit inferior to my first choice. It was super chill, sweet and I was expecting more orange flavor in it. 

In all the place is really good and quality of taste in drinks here is way beyond any other place serving good stuff in same domain. Highly Recommended.

No matter how many caf√©s pop up in south Kolkata, nothing beats this traditional Sherbat and Syrup Shop in College Street. I always ensure that I make a visit to this place, everytime am out to buy books. Almost all the drinks are worth trying, but I especially like the Dab Sharbat, Cocoa Malai and Passion Fruits. The syrups are also extremely refreshing, while the cream-based drinks have some added curd. So, if you are not up for curd-based products, you may avoid those. But in any case, you will be all too eager to take back a bottle home!

An eclectic collection of fruit juices and shakes will make you visit this shop for more and more times. I would specially recommend its "Dab Sherbat" which is made of fresh coconut water and its flesh. And last but not the least I will definitely exalt its quality of pocket friendliness.

This place is treat to your taste buds, in particular and your sense, in general. Standing proud on College Street, this place has been the "CCD/Barista" for decades now. I have tried almost everything on their Special Drinks menu and these people NEVER fail to impress you. 
The drink parlour is small with traditional wooden tables and chairs and staffs with a big-warm hearts. My all time favorite is the Coco Malai and Mango Mania.
If you haven't tried this place yet, what are you waiting for?

Paramount Sherbats & Syrups - Paramount in literal sense means supreme or say something which is of great importance. This place has been rightly named.¬†
=====
Intro + Location: It might be a little difficult to locate this place but i will make it easy for you guys. ¬†Enter Lane Opposite to Presidency Uni/College and take the first Right. On the left food after walking for say 2 minutes, you will discover this. This place does not have a board but the name is so famous that if you ask anyone, people will guide you through. It is one of the oldest sherbat shop and i think it is established in 1918 if i am not wrong. Most of the prominent personalities like Amartya Sen, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose etc etc. and even our famous cricketer Sourav Ganguly has paid a visit. When anyone speaks about paramount, it is about their famous daab sherbat.¬†

I did expect a signboard for Paramount at the top which was not there. However, they were busy constructing the other part of the building to enlarge their scale of operations. I took my seat and somehow this place did give me a really peaceful feeling. The ceilings and fan reminded me of my old home in Bhawanipur. Nevertheless, it could have been cleaned a bit on the walls and ceilings to remove the spider webs. They have also put a lot of wall photos of Rabindranath Tagore, Swami Vivekananda and many more prominent people.¬†
=====
What i ordered:¬†

‚Ä¢ Grapes Crush - It was good. However, the syrup was added a lot more than it should be making it a bit more sweet than usual. ¬†‚úå

‚Ä¢ Daab Sherbat - This sherbat definitely is something really worth tasting. I had been hearing from many of my connoisseur friends and somehow, i did get to try it finally. It's usual daab water mixed with their syrup and ice to top. Tasted extremely good and i went on ordering another one. I also packed the Sherbat in the Bottle they gave me. It was really worth it. ‚úå
=====
Pros:

‚Ä¢ This place feels like home.¬†
‚Ä¢ The owner is friendly.¬†
‚Ä¢ The service is fast as they only cater to sherbats and juices etc etc.
‚Ä¢ It is a very old establishment. More like a brand name now.¬†
‚Ä¢ Seating area is just fine. They are expanding too.¬†

Cons:

‚Ä¢ The place could have been kept more clean specially the ceilings and walls.¬†
=====
Expert Suggestion:
‚Ä¢ Please put a board on the outside so that people can highlight your outlet. This will help you gain additional customers.
=====
Sherbat for two 150-300 max
=====
Conclusion: I would love to pay a visit again. This place feels like home. Really a good place to have some sherbat and chill. ¬†‚ù§
=====
Unbiased review based on my visiting experience. 
=====
Recently, went there and had tamarind and daab sherbet. Tamarind is also a good try if you want tangy flavour.

Visited this place last month, after shopping for books in the college square. I had heard, so much about it, that I made a point to search it in the narrow lanes of that area. With the help of my gps, it wasn't difficult. Luckily there was not much of a crowd, i got a seat easily. Ordered keshar malai. It was heavenly. I have nothing much to say, it's almost a hundred years old shop and part of kolkata's legend,may it continue being that way.

The famous Dub Sarbat ¬†just the inner fresh tender coconut malai will melt in mouth... a must must try!!! The other ones tried were Passion fruit totally awesome, Cocoa Malai was so so where as Lytiche syrup and tamarind was so refreshing... Rest others Mango and green apple is also fine.. There is a Nostalgia feeling a short small cosy place and legendary had there grace over the years... Will surely come again for more drooling in

Set in as one of the oldest shops in Kolkata, since 1918, Paramount has been serving top quality drinks and sherbets. The drinks are ample in quantity and the prices are just right. i had Green Mango syrup and Dab Sarbat, and particularly liked the latter due to the presence of real coconut water and coconut cream in it. The drinks are served chilled with crushed ice which gives a refreshing effect, almost as if it revives a tired you. Must try if you are around the area, a must visit if you are in Kolkata.

Located in one of the busy lanes of college Street, this place needs no further introduction or descriptions as we all know how famous the sharbats and syrups are over here!. The dab sharbat is a must try over here along with the rose and the lemon syrups!  It's quite difficult to get a table over here but thankfully we have been lucky always. The service is very quick and it literally feels amazing to visit a place which has a touch of history to it!

Truly the mount everest of sherbats...located in a colonial building off the famous college square, it sooths you with its ever refershing array of sherbats..though daab sherbat is a hit here. yet green mango is my personal favourite. I was a bit disappointed with their grapes crush..despite being served with crushed grapes ..it was too sweet a sherbat.

This place is one of the best places to have sherbats and lassi in kolkata. This place was first introduced to me by my dad and since then I have fallen in love with it. Ever bong has some connection with the old legendary places of college street and this is one of them. The lassi and sherbats are lip smacking and i bet you cant leave just by having a single glass. Though this place is small but at the end its the lassi and sherbats that matter. The staff is very helpful and the owner is also quiet friendly.
Cheers!!
Keep it up!!

Nothing has changed over the years. The same historic ancestral look, cherish the well-preserved heritage of Kolkata in its sherbats. As usual the daabh sherbat¬†is a thirst quenching delight for the hot humid summers and the cocoa or the mango malai is the epitome of royalty drinks. Coconut/daabh sherbat¬†is a must try for the first time visitors, I relish the chunks of daabh¬†floating like ice bergs¬†on the sea of fresh coconut water.

This is an institution for sherbats and syrups which is running over a century now; and i being born "yesterday" seriously lack the intellect to write anything about this place, good or bad. (there ain't anything bad about it, is there?? noway!)¬†
¬†I was introduced to this heaven by my mum around 10 years back when i first visited college street along with her. she had told me NEVER to return home from college street without having a Dub sherbat from paramount! these are the golden words of my mum which i always abide by; and rest forgotten! :p¬†
¬† ¬†Enough of introduction! now coming straight up to the review.. ¬†seriously speaking, this is a place which one would visit again and again if he/she tastes the mighty Dub sherbat which is undoubtedly my favourite.. Have tried each one on the menu, right from the Coco malai to the milk based one, the curd based one and the water based ones.. have left no stone unturned! trust me, all of them are yum. (based on your taste bud, though. like, i prefer the water based ones over the milk and curd ones but they are nothing less and most of my friends like the milk and curd ones more!)
¬†¬†but the DUB SHERBAT is the winner! there has been times when i've had three glasses at a go and still craved for more! :p ¬†Love the soft kernal of the green coconut that is served along with the sherbat.. it's like a slice of heaven put into a glass with a straw and a spoon! yum! very subtle and light on tongue!
other sherbats are either milk ¬†or curd based.. equally good! plenty of varieties to choose from.. vanilla, mango, banana, grapes,strawberry, lychee, orange, lemon, rose, pineapple, kesar, passion fruit and even tamarind (mouth-wateringly delicious)!

Strongly recommending the place! MUST MUST MUST try! it's a calcuttan heritage! (yes, i do prefer Calcutta over kolkata!)

P.S. ¬† do check out the List of eminent visitors of this place which one would find pasted onto a wall right near the cash counter and trust me it is going to make the person dumbstruck! i ain't kidding!

A place as legendary as the Indian Coffee House in college street. Its a small place with benches and tables. You might have to wait outside untill you fetch yourself a seat. Meanwhile you can go through the board they have hung just above the counter displaying with pride the numerous esteemed personalities and celebrities right from the era of 1940s who have enjoyed coming to this place. They have a wide range of sherbats, favourite amongst which to me is the Daab sherbat, which is really refreshing with pieces of daab  at the bottom of the mug. It's worth giving a try!

Checked-in after a long long time...may be after 17-18 years !!! The outlet will be touching 100 years in 2018. 
Few names from a long list of stalwarts & super-humans who have frequented this place on a regular basis - Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Acharya Prafulla Chandra, Dr C V Raman (though his name is not inscribed on the Visitors' list), Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Rittwick Ghatak, Sachin Dev Burman, Basanta Chowdhury....
Netaji used seat on a particular wooden chair, which would be on display during their Centenary Year, I was informed during a emotional chat with their owner.
Now coming to Sherbat for which it is famous & standing for :
I Ordered Grape Crush , my colleague ordered one of their epic drinks - Coconut Sherbat ... 
'One for the road' was 'Mango Mania' - heavenly or, yummy as adjectives would be short of justifying it's real taste ...
Only thing because of the age ü§ë might be I started liking less about the preparations here is -added sweetness which I felt is on higher note !!!
 
However, it was really refreshing - the whole package of recreating old time memories over familiar Sherbat  !!! Only the companions have changed over course of time üò•

Went there on an autumn afternoon about 20 days before Durga Puja (in Sept 2015).¬†
Have heard about this place a lot.Have heard about the nostalgia associated with this sherbat shop.
However.I am not that impressed.¬†

Tasted the Dab Sherbat.Was nice,but nothing out of this world.
Also tasted the Mango Lassi. I actually found the Lassi to be better.

I feel they should try to improve the seating arrangemnt a bit. And for those folks who say its very cheap,I beg to differ. They charged Rs 50 for Dab Sherbat,which cannot be regarded as cheap,if not expensive,taking into account that they have minimal expenditure on ambience.I have heard that even 1-2 years back the prices were quite low and has been augmented only recently.

I am rather of the view that they should reduce their prices a bit,so that normal college going guys in and around College Street area can visit this place more often. Other than that,I do agree that every Kolkatan should come here atleast once so as to witness the rich legacy.

Located just beside the college square, this little marvel is quenching kolkata's thirst since decades. The "kori borga" roof and the antelope skulls hanging down the wall give the calm interior an unique charm. The list of visitors, starting from Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose to Sourav Ganguly, will surely make you spellbound. "Daab Sherbat"..... in my opinion, is the best. Chilled sherbat with juicy coconut pulp floating inside with ice topping.... you can not ask for more in a hot and humid kolkata day. Apart from these, one can also try "Kesar Malai", "Litchi Syrup" and "Grapes Crush". They also serve sherbats in plastic bottles for 'take away' purpose, of course you have to lose some extra bucks for that. So.... finally..... after a draining day, go there, grab a sherbat, take a sip and chill :)

Hi foodies!

=19th August, 2014=
This is a legendary restaurant and there's not much to say about it. Paramount has always been the destination for me for a quick sherbat after my swimming sessions at the College Square Swimming Club. On this day, I took my friend along.

We ordered:
1) Dab Sherbat: This is the all-time favourite here so I made her try it. As expected, she loved it. :)

2) Cocoa Malai: I, for a change, ordered this one but sadly, this was kinda disappointing, more so after you taste the former.

This is a legendary restaurant so don't expect much in decor, but do experience it if you pass by.

-Bon App√©tit. :)

Ladies and gentlemen.. Boys & Girls ..

So how can a Bengali write a review of Paramount ? Well in plain simple words there cannot be any review of this place which will always provide you with good experiences. I went there on 19th November 2015 which can be described as an off season because of the change in weather for the city . But that did not dampen our spirits because we were really thirsty and specially thirsty for sherbets :P . I had :

1. Dub Sharbat ( 5/5 )
2. Kesar malai ( 4/5 )

Well if you are asking whats kesar malai sherbet is all about . It is a combo of ( Rubri + Milk + Kheer + cashew nuts + ice = awesomeness ) . Its like the malai portion of rasomalai inside a full glass with ice . Trust me it is glorious. Priced at at a slight hefty 100 rupees this juicy delight is one for the memories. But the real show stopper is the Dub Sherbet . I would not describe it much in words because you just have to experience it yourself . If you are in Bengal or an outsider you have to test this once in a lifetime . The dub sherbet is as legendary as it gets. I will certainly go there again and again and again .. and each time i will have one choice as constant - The Dub Sherbet . :)

I studied in Presidency college, so obviously this famous place for sherbets became our regular got to go place. The drinks are amazing, and the price is old timey. That is this place is about old Kolkata values not CCD. 
I have had countless glasses of Dab Sharbat and Coco Malai there and when I had pocket pinches, it used to be the cream rose. 
Even now if I visit college Street for some work I go and sit there alone and have a drink.

I got introduced to this place on the day I visited college-street on my own. to sit for the entrace exam @Presidency University.
And maybe it is lucky for me. I got a chance in the university. I became a regular visitor to college-street and this place.
Once you enter, you will understand how old this place is. the wooden-benches and marble-topped tables are always ready to welcome you. There is no AC in the place and still there is an amazing sense of bliss and relaxation that soothes you in this place.
There is something to suit everyone's budget and each and every glass is created with perfection. One can never complain about the quantity or quality of drink they serve. The owners are always present and ready to assist you. They will attend every customer personally. guide you in your serbat-journey, take feedback and make you feel at home.
I remember ordering grape-crush once and when it was nearly finished, I noticed a little dead ant in the bottom of the glass. Before I said a word, the owner came to the table (well, he was keeping an eye on every customer I guess) apologized for the mistake and served another glass for free. Now this is what makes this place LEGENDARY.
My picks-passion fruit, coco-malai, tamarind syrup¬†
P.S- Ask the owners about the dear-horns displayed in a wall. You will come to know an amazing story

Paramount doesn't need an introduction amongst the old generation that grew up with College Street books. Every time I visit College Street, it's a must for me, summer or winter. But the summers make it just amazingly delightful. 

It's a small shop with a fair bit of old school ambience to it. Coming to the sherbets, the Cocoa Malai is the king of the ring and the undisputed champ. The super tasty drink with a very generous doze of nuts is just amazing.

But there is something about the Orange sherbet that I love. It's got a rather strong flavour of sour that gives an amazing kick followed by a lovely dash of sweet. I always end up having a couple of them or more. 

I only wished they had more branches to fulfil my insatiable thirst for amazing sherbets. Nevertheless, it's always worth the trip to the other side of town for this beauty.

I would rate them 4.5 if this review was written 3-4 years back. 
Their dab Sharbat is legendary and it should be. Glass size is large. Taste is awesome. The quality of 'malai' of the green coconut is outstanding. 
I don't dare to rate this below 4. 
But when it comes to the other Sharbats, the taste of the syrup and curd used to prepare them, have an strange taste (it is not bad at all); I used to like it a lot. But as time flows, I have started finding it lot more artificial than it used to be 3-4 years back. 
But their dab and coco malai Sharbats really stand out. 
3.5 for Sharbats and 0.5 for the awesome ambiance which reminds me of my school and college days.

On my first time visit at this place, I tried to play safe and ordered the most talked about sherbet of this place, the famous Dab-Sherbet. It came with thin layers of coconut malai and the dab-water was additionally sweetened.¬†
The ambiance is of the typical north-Indian adda place, with minimal decor. The time I went there, an uncle were sitting at the cash counter. He somehow figured out that I'm a newbie and came to tell about the place and the items they offer in details. It was really nice and kind of him to do that- added some extra points to my experience.¬†

Will definitely go back to try some malai-based flavours.

Been there for a couple of times. It is a traditional place. In summer evenings it is hard to get a place here. You have to wait for 15 minutes. But their sherbats are worth waiting. They are famous for daab sharbat but other sharbats are equally good. My favourite is green mango and orange syrup. I really love this place whenever I go to college street this place is a must visit. One of my friend made a documentary film. They were really helpful.

Their sarbats are out of this world. They are brilliant, with all the fruits, nuts & malai they give. Very refreshing and will fill your stomach too. A must try for everyone. I ate the chocolate malai sarbat & strawberry sarbat, both were fantastic.

My favorite place to hangout. I really don't have words to describe the PARAMOUNT. Adjectives like delicious and mouthwatering or refreshing are to less to describe. 
From green mango to dub sarbat to mango mania, all the drinks are :3
My only suggestion would be introduce a drink in every 6 months so we can visit more often.

What can I possibly write about this place. Most of the kolkatans have been there.
One word, outstanding.!!!!!!!!!!!.
I mostly like the water base sherbats and my favourites are mango mania, cocoa malai, cream lassi and dub sherbat. I always take it without ice.
This is it.

First things first, I must say, Paramount should open more outlets all over the city. It is an indigenous brand, and we pay double the money to have the same drinks from KFC or McD, etc. I had Daab Malai, Cream Pineapple and Cream Kesar lassi. I think the quantity was a bit less though, but the drinks were simply awesome! I am looking forward to try each and every drink on their menu!!

They also pack the drinks for you if you take a bottle with you, else you also have an option of buying one from them too. The place is retaining its heritage in the best manner possible.

I finally managed to drop In at the much talked about sherbat joint this Pujos! Ambience: Stirs up nostalgia with the decor of early 20th century...and they have so many articles written about them, all displayed neatly.
Dab Sharbat, the USP is truly magnificent. Not overly sweet its fulfilling and the tender coconut at the end is the best part.
Tried Kesar Malai which comes with a thick chunk of malai topped with cashews and raisins and flavoured with saffron. But was dissatisfied with the consistency of the drink! Too much ice cubes had made it go runny. So not really awestruck with the drink. The green mango was a better one, the sweet and sour flavour nailed perfectly.

After hearing a lot about this place.. finally got a chance to visit during durga puja while i was there at college street to see the college square pandal (umm too much information i guess ;) ) anyway, the place has this typical north kolkata charm like i expected.. nothing fancy or prettified.. simple benches.. which we had to share with another couple because of the rush during durga pujas.. very limited seats.. but clean and hygienic . What makes it popular is i guess the taste , quality and price of the sherbets.. we ordered the famous daab sherbet , cream rose and cocoa malai.. i personally loved the cocoa malai.. it tasted really good with ample nuts and coconut shavings .. the daab sherbet was good too.. i found the cream rose a bit sour .. or maybe because i have a sweet tooth and i like my lassi a bit sweet .. so that was a personal comment .. otherwise service is prompt.. quality is really good.. while passing by college street.. you can definitely drop in to quench your thirst without even thinking about your wallet.

I won't waste my words trying to describe how the tantalizing the sherbat is... Instead I would just stick to the words,,, "Paramount : the age old name in sherbats ."¬†
Being from Kolkata certain places are ingrained in your growing up years in food wise or drink wise .. This place certainly ranks high in the list.. It is the most iconic place of North Kolkata who thrived on food joint like Coffee house, located in the heart of the College Street.."College Street" the word is enough to describe that the legendary place z how much popular among the college goers & the book lovers..¬†
Regardlessly to say, this place more than lives upto its name.. This place gives you the feel of true Bangaliana, the decor akin an old zamindar bari jzt adds to the old world charm with high ceilings, deer head bust wall hanging that date as far back as 1918.. Its walls are adorned with the different articles.. Though its not have an extraordinary ambiance like nowadays cafeterias along with exotic names of drinks on the menu..¬†
I went to this place with my friend to quench my thirst. I have almost tried everything from their menu chart but cocoa malai and Daab (coconut) sherbat is actual coconut water with the daab malai on top, are my personal favorite..¬†
Paramount is just like heaven in a hot summer afternoon & the crowd moves so fast u really don't have to wait for long.. And about their price chart if you compare it with the other parlour or juice stop, then you won't notice much of a difference..The place.. The staff... The quality.. The taste.. Has all remained the same... Its like a frame fixed in time..

Was a great place once for sure but experienced a nightmare yesterday. We ordered 2 mango lassi and 3 kesar lassi. Surprisingly 1 kesar lassi they served with zero sugar, 1 with little bit sugar and another 1 was ok. When we asked about this the management started quarreling with us that they prepare all the lassi's together! We asked to taste them those 3 kesar lassi's to understand the difference but they keep shouting on us that we are sugarholic!!! Holy crap!! Visiting this place since when we were a school kid but never had this much bad experience. Shame on the management. It was there fault but they didn't accepted it and shouted on us. You guys should learn manners from the lassi makers in the foothpaths of esplanade!!!!!

In a sunny afternoon, when you are done with the scorching heat, Paramount is the place to visit. Nothing beats a tall glass of Daab Sarbat at Paramount & yes, they take great care to ensure that their drinks are good.

 Paramount is well known for their Daab (Coconut) sherbet. The people who runs the shop are really awesome. The way the will greet you and ask for orders, is really awesome.

Not the best place for an adda but definitely worthy of a visit and a drink.

A tasty, refreshing drink is often one to savour. Nothing beats a tall glass of refreshment, and at Paramount, they take great care to ensure that their drinks are good.

The shop is small-ish, and is terribly crowded, but I suppose the crowd is bound to happen because of their standout reputation. Their staff is friendly and efficient, although the man who walks around trying to control everything is kind of useless.

The drinks they serve, and they serve quite a few, are all delicious to the ear. I haven't had too many, but I assume that they're all good. Paramount is well known for their Daab (Coconut) sherbet, and the lady at the desk swears by their Chocolate Kesari Sherbet.

Not the best place for conversation, but definitely worthy of a visit and a drink.

Thanks for reading and pardon me for any grammatical errors I may have made.

Walking through boipara, and feel intensely thirsty? Paramount it is. When you go to a place like this, you go for the atmosphere as well, not just to eat or drink. Such a place comes with efficient staff and unique "special" items on offer. Try any of the malai sherbets, and green mango syrup(in picture). The daab malai looked interesting too!

Traditional and authentic sherbets are the hallmarks of this place. Situated in college street this place stands rock steady from a very long time. Yes!it does not have an extraordinary environment and the ultramodern decor of ccd or modern bistros along with exotic names of drinks on the menu but can surely give these new places a run for their money when sherbets and juices are concerned. I have been going there from a very long time and have almost tried everything on their chart(yes it is actually a chart held on the wall) , but my enthusiasm for visiting this place whenever in college street has never decreased. So,yesterday went in here again when I had some work in the area but my experience was a bit downhill and so i restricrted myself on giving a rating of 4 to this otherwise awsome joint. We ordered a tender coconut sherbet and a vanilla malai sherbet. Now, i went with my favourite drink( tender coconut) and as usual it was fantastic. The chilled drink was perfect and i paticularly enjoy the 'daaber saans' which floats in the drink. My friend ordered the vanilla malai but sadly she was disappointed with the taste and so was I. It was very thick and had a kind of weird taste to it. It was even difficult to gulp it and we had to leave the drink halfway. This was quite unexpected from a place like this. However little faults cannot diminish the otherwise joyous experiences of this place I had  in the past. For me this place has its own charm and i am surely going back to this legendary place whenever possible. Also highly recommended for all juice lovers...

The legendary and famous sherbat spot in calcutta is present in the college street area. I used to visit this place whenever i used to go to college street on a summer afternoon for book shopping. Now that i am in calcutta university, surely this is going to be my regular thirst quenching place as the weather is inconvenient. Little bit unclean but you will find it completely full. Sometimes you share bench with fellow thirst quenchers. Daab sherbat is a must try here along with mango and rose malai sherbat. One can also buy a take away bottle for 150. They do serve in weddings and other occasions.

This was my first experience when I had my Daab Sharbat at Paramount . Anyone who visits college street must have that glass of 'joy' at paramount .

I had a luck to take an interview of the current ownerfor a magazine and I came to know much more about the family behind this shop, how they came up with a plan to serve sherbats and the legacy of the same.

Finally I made my way into Paramount. Sharbat and Malai of Paramount is so renowned that you need to have a sip of either of them to be considered as a proper Bengali. Green Malai Sharbat was really good but cocoa didn't live up to its hype. Have a look at the famous crop of 'Bengali'  who have visited the store.

An Iconic place. A small hole in the wall place near college square with it's own boastful nuggets of history to share. Legend has- their Daab Sherbet recipe was formulated under the guidance of world renowned chemist Prafulla Chandra Roy. I can not think of any other place that can  boast this claim. Their Daab Sherbet is legendary and cools off inside with a sip even in the wretched hot summer days. 

They also sell the Daab syrup in bottles, I did buy one once. Bad decision. It's hard to replicate the same effect in home.

I personally recommend Paramount to everyone who visit College Street. The small place with marble tables and warm ambience is perfect for the cool drinks they offer. On sunny afternoons or humid evenings, this place comes to rescue when the thirst fills us.
Though I've tried almost all of their sherbets and syrups yet I recomment the daab sherbet along with strawberry malai and cocoa malai. I'd not suggest the syrups as they taste not as good as the sherbets and malais.

I have been going to this place since I was a child. My mother took me to Paramount after my swimming classes. We have been here when we were in college and even after that I have taken a friend from Germany to Paramount. This sherbet shop is special because it is an institution in itself. The flavours offered here are unique be it cocomalai or vanilla or orange. But the daab sherbet stands out. I still visit Paramount whenever I can manage. A visit to college street us never complete without a visit to Paramount. 
However offlate, for a few years they have started adding kaju kishmish (cashew n sultana) to their drinks. This somehow I feel do not go well with sherbet. Apart from this Paramount is a must visit.

I became a regular at college street and college square only during my university days! Often gaps between classes, called for long adda sessions and a visit to paramount.. I think their dub sarbot is phenomenal (and seeing so many pictures of their dub sarbot, let's not add yet another one) well I can have this every single day! This is so delicious.. Then cocoa malai needs another special mention! Which is yum too! And green mango! This is so refreshing in a summer days with a curd base! 
Only thing, don't try their cold coffee, at 60bucks its pretty cheap! But we all can make paramount type cold coffees at home, for that no need to pay a visit at paramount!

There are many places for juices and beverages but trust me this place is really good for juices. The environment may not be appealing but what really matters is the juice that we get to chill on and enjoy every sip of it with adda.

The thing about Paramount is you go here thinking you are just gonna have a sharbat and you are gonna leave, that never happens. You'll want another one and then probably another one if you in the mood. Its that good, no strike that its the BEST.

Paramount_Enough said!
A legendary place with their thirst-quenching sharbats. Have tried Mango Mania, Kesar malai, special Kesar lassi, dub sharbat & many of their other delicacies, All of them are superb for their own specialties, and one thing was common after every drink- a big satisfactory burp from me :P
You should visit many times to savour their whole collection!

Paramount is a place which I think needs no introduction.Perfect place to hang out during summer days.Though this place is little bit congested & crowdy but it's mouth watering sherbats & syrups of paramount are really awesome.Each of the drinks are well enough.

Had been to the place on 18th of september with a friend of mine. The place is located close to umesh chandra college on college street. The place has sitting arrangments and looks very old. 

The people at the place are very hospitable and the lady at the counter welcomes you with a big smile. We ordered for a cocoa malai , dab sharbat, cream rose and kesar malai. The dab sharbat was the best. The sharbat has pieces of coconut cut and put in the sharbat and it really tastes amazing. You should defenitely try this one if you ever visit the place. The cocoa malai is also faboulous. Cream rose is made with curd base so it is salty and not sweet but yes it tastes great. Although i personally didnt like the kesar malai much as compared to the others.

The price is slightly on the higher side although they do not charge any tax over the prices displayed in the menu, but the shebats there are worth every penny spent. A must go place for all people who love drinking sherbats.

The legendary outlet of kolkata. Famous among celebrities, students and adults.. Every time I visit college street, it's a rule to visit paramount. The quality remains same after so many years, the ambience same. Small place,ideal for a small adda over shorbot. College street is famous for things like book shops  presidency university, calcutta university, coffee house and paramount sherbats. The fav of many n for a reason is the "daaber shorbot" . The exquisite flavor or daaber jol mixed with a certain syrup n daaber shaans, its like nectar of God's..

This place is very close to my mom's maiden house. Whenever I used to get the book list from my school , it was a mandatory thing to have syrup or a sharbat at this place.
The thing I adore in this place is that the taste did not change round the years. I tasted almost everything here. And whenever my mama asked what would I like to have? I always said lets go to paramount.
The chocomalai and daab sharbat are signature dishes.The green mango and the tamarind syrup and the rose syrup are not so hyped but truely awesome.
I am a chocolate freak and the malai over the chocolate sharbat everytime makes me say " aha! yeh dil maange more"

Paramount is one of those rare gems in the city that the gen ex people swear by when it comes to sherbets and shakes and syrups. The place has received a legendary status throughout time, having catered to numerous stalwarts of bengal since 1913 including Netaji Subhash Bose, Uttam Kumar and more. They have survived the corrosion of time solely due to their quality of sherbets and the air of nostalgia it evokes. Although the prices have gone up considerably recently but still a must visit. They provide numerous options to choose from. So choose well and enjoy üòâ

Walked into this old hangout place frequently visited by most who visit college street. Ambience is old worldly, entrance has pictures of all famous people/celebrities who visited this place over years of history. Small wooden tables and benches to sit. Ordered daab sherbet and mango malai, quick service not to mention both drinks had an overload of malai on top of the drink. Daab sharbat had actual daab slices and tasted very pure. Mango did not taste of artificial flavoring and ws loaded with dry fruits and nuts. In all pocket friendly break to quench thirst as well as slight hunger.

I made a visit to this place, one tiring evening, to curb my long desires. I ordered the Kesar Malai. Just as I sipped into this legendary, oh the freshness! The current heir cum owner treated me with his company and amiability from my first step till the last. His long tales were like extra toppings over the sarbat! And yes, the interior, old yet no old. The paper cuttings and snapshots bear the heritage of the place. I've big plans to visit it again and again. My next try will be the cocoa, dab and the most special one! Just a note, I would prefer less ice than what was served.

Paramount is THE perfect place to cool down after a stint at book hunting.
The store is a bit small, traditional type with simple benches. The ambience is simple, and nothing much to talk about. Thing to note is the big board with list of famous people who have visited Paramount over the ages.

But hey, you don't come here for the ambience, you come here for the Sherbets.
The Daab Sherbet and the Green Mango Syrup are my favorite, and must tries. They are cool and pleasing, will freshen you up instantly.
Prices are pretty reasonable, might seem steep on paper, but you really need to experience it to understand the value.

Oh, did I mention, that after 2 years, Paramount will be 100 years old!!!!

Paramount isn't just another shop, its a legacy, a trip down memory lane, an experience in itself.

If you love juices or are thirsty from the scorching heat at college Street while surfing books Paramount is your place to be. The place has existed before Independence and according to their wall mounting the most eminent people of our independence struggle sat on the same benches and enjoyed a glass of juice. The place requires you to sit with others at a shared table removing the air of exclusivity or separation from others. Walls are filled with quotes and tables with awesome juices. Their coconut juice is a must try. Simply my favourite spot in the warm days of kolkata heat.

Its is one of the best if not the best soft drinks outlet in Kolkata. It has a traditional feeling within it. Now coming to the items I like all the items except the Dab Sherbat. But the curd based drinks are just awesome. Every time I visit in the College Street I used to take a drink or two here. Its its almost compulsory for me and my friends to visit here once in the pujas. Although it might be crowded still getting there and having a sip of any drink would refresh the mood and give us some most needed energy which would help us to venture little more.
Hence a full 5 * to it....

What sorcery is this Dab Sharbat? Hands down the best thing I have tasted in my 2 months in Calcutta. The first sip left me gobsmacked. Another glass of regal awesomeness is the rose malai. I also noticed that every table had a green mango drink. I was too full from my second dab to try it. The only sour spot was the orange sharbat which was too sweet/syrupy with no natural flavor. But with its intimidating antler heads and classroom benches, this gem is an absolute must visit.

This place is a must-go.
Not because of the amazing drinks it is known for but the fact that this is probably the only place in the city where they have come up with really innovative sherbets and ofcourse because of the legacy. And the entire feel of it : the laid-back nature of the city,the hustle-bustle,the location and the people around you.¬†
We tried quite a few of things from the menu.¬†

Cocoa malai,banana malai and kesar malai were all amazing. Though I think the cocoa malai is a little overrated because "chocolate in a sherbet" isnt a nice combination really,but despite that it tastes so good!
Daab sherbet was nice,people who like daab-er jol would really like it,I think.
Grape crush was okay. I didnt like the Passion fruits personally.

Great place to go to if you are in College Street buying books. Not meant for cosy long coffee-shop conversations.

Update 28 Oct'15

Went back to the place after many years with a friend. The place is still the same as it's used to be in my school years. Standing on the sands of time the shop seems younger by the years. 

I ordered for a mango mania and my friend a cold coffee. Taste was as per the standards of paramount. I felt ice was used more than required.

Not much of a ambiance to a naked eye, but if you look carefully the walls, newspaper cuttings, and most of all numerous memories of so many families, friends group, couples and solo goers will keep you warm. Pictures attached.

Old post:
In the heart of college street lies one of most famous Sherbat ka Dukan ( juice shop). I grew up in the area and for many childhood years it was way out of our league. Then in layers years we friends often opted for a one or two drinks here. I tasted various conventional drinks like mango, orange, rose and some special ones. E.g. Dab er sorbot, badam lassi, and off course the famous original lassi with a layer of papercurd over the top. If you're around the area do check out this place. It is a bit difficult to locate from a nonregular customer. Ask around and many will come for you help. The shop is right behind Hindu School near to the back exit of College Square.

This should be a must visit place for all the people in Kolkata. Serving some brilliant sherbets and quenching the thirst since decades. This place has been visited by a bunch of eminent personalities & those moments are preserved in the frames. Nothing outstanding in the decoration but this place happens to maintain in quality. Sometimes you might have to wait in ques to get your table. All the sherbets are superb but specialities are the Cocoa Malai, Kesar Malai & the Dab Sherbet. The Cream Rose & Cream Kesar Lassi is also to be mentioned. Each time I visit College Street I surely pay a visit here to slurp their chillers :)

I went to Paramount on a food trail to legendary places in old calcutta with a friend and had 2 dab sherbats and shared a coco malai and green mango. The dab sherbat is very good and famous. Coco malai is rich but not decadently rich, which makes it perfect for my liking. The green mango cream was a disappointment since it was too syrupy.

For anyone who lives in this side of calcutta or has spent a good part of student life here, Paramount is a more constant and recurring feature to their lives, serving up good sherbats at very reasonable prices.

However, for people like me and my friend who qualify for neither, Paramount stands out for its historical legacy and is an essential visit to discover the food hertige of calcutta. So do visit it at least once !

I wasnt aware about the history of Paramount till my wife pulled me along to this small n nice outlet just next to the college street swimming pool. Small outlet, only serves sharbets. Since menu is limited to drinks the service is fast and you will be in and out within 15minutes. The perfect break when you are tired of all the book shopping. Tried the dab sharbat and the cocoa malai and it was totally worth it. Total pinch on the pocket, only Rs130/- for the two drinks, almost negligible in todays time. So drop by and do try out a drink or two. Dont expect the moon and you wont be disappointed

Paramount is one of oldest and legendary sharbat parlour in Kolkata. Ambience is very simple which makes different from others. Decoration reminds you about old days of Kolkata. Menu is full of different types of sharbats. Wish to have all of them but ended up with Dab sharbat and kesari lassi both were really good. Dab sharbat was refreshing and chilled.

Tasted the mango sharbat and the malai sharbat( those might not be the exact names) honestly the mango sharbat came with rabri!!! Yes u heard me right! And was nothing less than awesome! Widout any artificial cooling the old architecture( high roofed) keeps this place cool,scoring a five for the ambience as well.

No fancy arrangements, it's just you sitting on a wooden bench and the drink that you have got in the glass in front of you is enough to blow you mind and come back over and over again. One sip into that and you forget every other discomfort. And no, there is no need for them to install air conditioners or better furniture because everything in there smells of heritage and class and it should remain that way. 

The legendary Dub Sharbat is inimitable. You can't just not try it. 

I mourn for your loss if you have been to Kolkata and have not tried Paramount.

Over 100 years they are fulfilling the thirst of the Calcuttans with their sherbats. There is no classy ambience..very normal atmosphere. Price is very reasonable,staffs are very polite. This small place is always packed with people. Try their green mango sherbat.

Legendary, traditional albeit with a touch of nationalism and perhaps Paramountcy over all other similar drinks outlets in the entire Kolkata... these pretty much sum up this place.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† All of the sherbats and syrups here are served with ice (if not specified otherwise)... and served fast. My personal favourites are Cocoa malai (milk based), Cream green mango (curd based) , Lemon syrup. Their Cold coffee is quite good too.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The staff are really courteous, cordial and they do attend to the needs of foodies.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† On a hot summer afternoon at College street, after hours of "boi-khoja-kena o pora"...this is THE place to go to revitalize oneself...

First time I went there with my father. I never knew about this place. My teacher once told me about this place. And just to taste the wonders of the sarbats I headed there with my father. The Dub Sarbat, Mango Mania and the Kesar Malai, all of them were just awesome.¬†
Last time I went there with my partner and he ordered the Tamarind Syrup. I just loved it with all my heart and stomach.
The service is very nice. I had a chit chat with the manager or maybe the owner of the shop. They are really funny people. I had a great time there.

The Paramount is not just an everyday sherbet shop, but one which carries years of history and pride with its name.
Though not widely known, one must visit this place in College Street, to get a glimpse of the lives of the Victorian Age Bengalis, vestiges of which have long since disappeared from the face of the city.

I don't know if i am blind or not but i never ever noticed this place before i saw a number of people going and reviewing this place . So when i went to college street today for my university work, i made it a point to go and taste the awsome sharbats and syrups. 

Location -- just behind college square park. If one goes to college street please visit this place
 
Syrups and sharbats ( not food :-P ) -- there are a number of varieties but my super duper foodie friend

I first went here with my best friend Kakali when we were studying MA in University of Calcutta. It was a long time ago. We were impressed by the marble topped tables and stuffed animal heads and old photos. It was a sultry afternoon and we were thirsty. Kakali chose rose sherbet. I wanted to try Cocoa Malai, but at that time it was Rs18/-, too expensive to try, so I chose Dab sherbet instead. Kakali later regretted that rose sherbet was nothing but rose syrup with ice, she had the idea that rose sherbet would contain real rose petals! I did not regret my choice. It was a wonderful refresher with a piece of dab malai floating inside the glass.
Days passed on. I often went there during my student days, with or without friends. Tried the other sherbets, including rose sherbet, and loved each one of them. However, cocoa malai, the costliest sherbet, remained a distant reality.
Even after my student days were over, whenever I went to College Street, I would come here for a drink, and one day I tried Cocoa Malai. By that time the price had risen, but I could afford it. It was like heaven, much better than ordinary ice cream or any other dairy products that I had tasted earlier. I promised myself to visit the place again and again.
In 2012, I went there last with my parents. We all chose cocoa malai. However I was disappointed at the fact that they did not serve it in the tall glass they used to serve. The glass was short, and the taste was not what it used to be. The quality has been reduced drastically. The price has also gone up. I wanted my ailing father to enjoy but he thought that we could have made better choices.
However, the ambience, the marble topped tables etc still remain, giving a feeling of nostalgia, reminding me of those light hearted student days.

This place is located at the heart of the city, just off College Square. A quaint little place where you can drop in for a quick sherbat, or a flavoured lassi or maybe try out some syrups. Easy on the pocket, very good service time, this place is a stuff of legends. My personal favourite here would be the Dub Sherbat. You could also try out the Rose syrup or the assortment of flavoured creams they provide. Would I recommend? For sure! You must visit this place at least once in your stay in the city.

It is one of the finest, oldest sharbat and syrup coolers place in Kolkata. Located cozily in the busy college street, it is still famous and popular among Kolkata people who still love their age-old mix of syrups into chillers and coolers like a true Kolkata heritage tradition. Must Have - Daab Sharbat, Coco Malai if not everything !!! you can even carry their homemade syrups for your home to make guests jump at the proposal of "daab sherbet". It maintains quality and quantity impeccably and the price is dirt cheap. Given any day I would love to have their daab sherbet before and after all my meals!

Well it's a legendary when it comes to syrups and sherbets...but inspite of so much of recommendation of daab sherbet...I couldn't find it up to the mark they have deteriorated from the past decades a lot now...though the mango kesaria milk was better but overall not satisfied and that smell of milk everywhere is just so unpleasant.... For the non milk lovers especially...

I will try my best to keep this review unbiased as for me Paramount is just more than a Sherbet outlet. 

The Winner : Daab Sherbet üòá

Green coconut water, sugar syrup, crushed iced and a floating strip of soft pulpy  coconut. Pure bliss!! üòò

Have been a fan of Daab Sherbet when it was Rs.15 per glass. Now each glass costs Rs.50!! In college days we friends always wanted to have Cocoa Malai but pocket never permitted us. So, we made a pact that after we get job we will come together to try Cocoa Malai. Sadly, since then I never tried Cocoa Malai but from the response of many school friends I can bet it's a sure winner!

The latest visit to this place with my school friends was full of nostalgia. The marble top tables, the wooden chairs, the list of eminent people who tasted Paramount's Sherbets, the wooden deer heads, the newspaper cutouts in the cashier's background all remains same. They had kinda upgraded their menu keeping in mind the young generation. The Passion fruit drink with a raabri base sounded exciting but I personally didn't like it much.

I will soon review it again after tasting the Cocoa Malai with my friends.

It is a heritage drinks corner in kolkata. Been there so many times. My previous generations also went there during their youth days. It is located beside college square next to mahabodhi society. Many dignitaries including netaji subhas chandra bose visited this outlet. My personal favourite out here is the daab sherbat and tamarind sherbat.

The tradition of coconut water in north and central Kolkata has been eminent since ages and this is being upheld fondly by Paramount too. Sourcing the coconuts from Basirhat, one gets to experience a refreshing coolness with the Daab Sherbet that's a blend of fresh tender coconut water, sugar syrup, essence and loads of crushed ice. It's light, tasty, definitely a thirst quencher that leaves you wanting for more!
Coco Malai is definitely one of Paramount's popular draws that's loaded on the Malai front. It's laced with dry fruits to complement the cocoa flavour with sweet malai base. I definitely like to finish off any of the drinks with the Daab Sherbet again!!
The decor/seating might not be posh like an upscale CCD or Barista the old era marble top tables with lined walls of eminent guests adorn the rich heritage of Paramount. Interestingly they do have a placard stating, "If you like it, tell others. If you don't like, tell us" ! We did just that; we found our Coco Malai to be on the bland side and asked to be improvised and voil√†! They whipped in some more Malai and magic and we were two happy, eternal Paramount fans, yet again!!

I visit about once a month. EVERY MONTH. That should tell you how special this joint is. First timers donot be overawed by the list of famous customers at the entrance but try out a dub sarbat. Over time you will gradually work your way to choco malai which has no equal. I just wish I could rate it higher.

Growing up in its vicinity, I have seen Paramount develop into this massive place of interest over the years. And they deserve every ounce of attention they have earned for themselves. A warm, simple and unpretentious place serving chilled sherbets with trophies hanging above you. It's extremely relaxing, that's about it. No high expectations, no disappointments. Oh, go for the malai sherbet. Bliss.

A long, long walk from CR Avenue to College Street for books, and more walking thereafter, we entered Paramount with exhausted legs and thirsty souls. On sitting we were handed the cards and I was immediately confused about what to leave out. 
Fortunately, the lady at the counter, who was just wonderful, helped us out. I finally settled with a cream orange and my companion, a cream green mango. 
It wasn't two minutes before our drinks were served. 
Creamy, cold, tangy, fruity, not too sweet, they were perfect. The green mango did taste a lot like the pineapple yogurt from mother dairy (just to give a reference to the lovely flavour). My cream orange was actually orangey but not at all artificial, and not too tart.
Then we went bonkers. And ordered the mango mania. And it was so, very worth the splurge. Loaded with rabri, malai and a generous dose of dry fruit with full fat milk with a generous amount of mango pulp, it was a revelation. Mango milk never tasted this good! We fought for the last drop, and were left wishing that had it were more.
I ended up taking a pineapple malai for mom, and even though she had it lukewarm four hours later, it still was creamy and perfectly sweet. She liked it so much that she refused to part with it at all! 
Our total bill came to 210 bucks, and even at first sight the drink price may look steep, but the goodness there is undeniable. And they really fill you up, unlike most beverages, more so if you request them to make it without ice. 
Bliss in a glass, thy name is Paramount!

It was a hot cloudy day when we walked in and after hounding for books,we were thirsty for something good. And then we got lucky.We discovered Paramount! With high ceilings, and deer head bust wall hangings that date as far back as 1918,this place is sure to give you a feel of nostalgia. Located opposite to College Square, its walls are adorned with various articles declaring it to be one of best places to have sherbets in Kolkata. But the deciding on what to order was the hardest part. So we asked the lady at the counter,who was very sweet and helpful when we asked her what would be best for us.She suggested the Cream Green Mango for me and an Cream Pineapple for my friend.One sip of my sherbet and I was floating through the clouds! The way it felt in my mouth was so goooood that I cant possibly categorize it. ¬†But the best part was the Mango Mania!!! Seasoned with rabri and dry fruits,one sip of this drink is sure to cleanse away all your worries and sadness for that moment! So next time you go to College Street,be sure to stop here for a drink in this legendary restaurant.Its a gem of a place!
P.S :The drinks are dirt cheap considering they use real fruit pulps for it.So go!! splurge!

Business works solely on the goodwill of the customers and the warmth of the attendants. Deeply disgusted with the behaviour of one of the attendants of this place. Due to some confusion of their own, they served me and my friend a sherbet "mango malai" that we didn't order for and when we denied that didn't keep him from offending us. Out of respect we held our words but such attitude is disgusting and unacceptable. I feel sorry of the fact that I took my friend there to enjoy some of the famous sherbets of this place. Never coming back as my respect and that of my friend's is more precious than some whimsical musings of an arrogant man who serves wrong drinks to their customers.

We wanted to visit Paramount for a long while. Finally it happened last weak. This place has very simple decor. sitting arrangement was made by putting some high benches and low benches together and you always have to struggle a bit to find a vacant place to sit. This outlet will make you feel little nostalgic if you belong to prior 90s. I am uploading a list, that they have put on display consisting the list of legends who have visited this place. Coming to the experience, they serve four types of beverages here. Some of them are rabdi based, some milk based, some curd based and syrup based. Other than that you will find Dab sarbat, grapes crush and cold coffee. We ordered grapes crush, lychee (syrup based) and cream green mango (curd based). Each drink was good but not extraordinary. Service is very prompt here. Presentation of drinks was ordinary. Dab sarbat and passion fruit are very famous here. We will surely try them latter.

Was nearly dying out of thirst when I had gone to College Street for some book shopping for my graduation course. Now there were two options left for me, one was to opt for some nimbu pani from roadside thelas and ruin the hygienic concerns or second was to find a descent beverage parlor where I could at least get some cold drinks or preferably sharbat. I choose the second option and searched Zomato for some help (as usual). Since this place was listed in Summer Coolers collections, I didn't give a second thought.

Firstly, I would like to say that missing this place is very easy as it is a small shop, somewhere between two yellow pillars on Bankim Chatterjee Street or the stationary market of College Street. One will need to ask for the exact location frequently as I did.

Next, upon reaching you will find a small place which is overcrowded to the brim. There are a few old wooden tables inside which were not very clean. Anyways, I ordered a Daab Sharbat which costs ‚Çπ50 a glass. The order came in a snap, with a big glass full of coconut malai and the sharbat. It was really refreshing and the malai was too tasty. The size of glass was big enough to justify the price.

Ambiance was typical olden days, deer heads and other interesting decorations are to be seen inside the place. Tables are uncomfortably close to each other, so expect no privacy. Service is quick and billing is extremely fast.

I have been there twice. 
The first time I went with my sister and her friend, and we ordered 3 different kinds of sherbets. Mine was the worst. It was something of chocolate but looked like mudwater and tasted worse. It's hard to go wrong with chocolate. My sister's was a rose sherbet, which wasn't bad, but I wouldn't pay for it. Her friend's one was the best. The daab sherbet. I had had a sip or two and it won over me. It was pure coconut water with a tinge of flavour and a thin coconut flesh in it. 
Moving on, the second time, a few years later I went with my own friend and ordered nothing but the daab sherbet and enjoyed it too, though I was a tad disappointed because there was no coconut flesh in it.

Paramount is a heritage of Kolkata.Those who would come from outside of Kolkata , it's a must visit place for them. After the whole days hard work if you want to take a sip to the fresh fruit made Sarabats, this is the best place for you. Its not an AC place also you don't require it because the kind of hospitality you would receive after entering here , would anyways make you feel relax and then the sip to the Sarbats and you are ready for your next.All type of flavours available here  are tasty,healthy and equally refreshing. So I would provide it a 5 star üåü üåü üåü üåü üåü rating...

This place never disappoints - all the times that we've been there - be it that first time, when i walked in with wide-eyed wonder holding Baba's hand or trooped in later with my friends from college - Paramount has always quenched our soul's thirst.
I always start with a glass (or two) of the awesome Daab Sharbat and then move on to the Green Mango or Vanilla or Rose Sharbats... I have never tried the Coco-Malai (nor do I want to) but I always think of trying the Grape Sharbat but veer away at the last moment... some day, eh?
The ambience is old-world and welcoming - the decor consists of sturdy wooden benches and marble topped tables which are always cool and welcoming, and the omnipresent antlers mounted on the wall. There are framed newspaper articles all over the place, from yellowing pieces which talk about how a Subhash Bose loved their fare to a new one of some PYT posing with a glass of sharbat. The lineage of their Syrups is impeccable - the Daab Sharbat syrup was supposedly formulated by the venerable Acharya Prafulla Chandra Roy. Now, who can fault credentials like that?They have also started a takeaway service where you can carry away 2 or 3 glasses worth of sharbats in cute plastic bottles for an extra charge.
The Daab Sharbat is definitely the star of the show - with pieces of tender coconut floating in the special syrup mixed with coconut water and ice shavings. Try it once, and you'll be coming back for more!

The ultimate Comfort Zone for me and my friends, the review comes quite late given that its been years since we first went there. The place is a legend onto itself, the sherbats are nothing less than miracles in glasses. I can't simply be unbiased and write neutrally, yes the place is that magical. Cocoa Malai & Dub Sherbat are my personal favourites but pick and choose yourself because the people who run Paramount haven't yet provided anyone any reason not to like any of their offerings.

If it's sherbat then it must be paramount...  Located near college square,this place never lets you down. Almost a century old establishment, paramount is famous for daab sherbat, kesar malai rose malai etc. Give them a visit at least once in your lifetime and yes don't forget to check out the list of personnel's that have visited this place since its inception... Simply mind blowing...

One of the most known and recommended go-to places of College Street, it offers some of the best summer coolers as well as all-time good drinks at reasonable prices. I personally love the Dab Sherbet and the Kesar Malai one. Since it is a bit crampy place, one has to wait around for seats as well as the order to come. Hosts are quite welcoming in nature.  
Definitely a must-visit of the famed College Street.

Paramount is the best thing that ever happened to mankind. If you are looking for a refreshing date with your loved one, Paramount is the best place to be over two glasses of elixir, oh sorry, sherbet as they call it. Its one of the oldest shops in North Kolkata. Once you visit Paramount, you'll know that you are bound to come back to relish again.

And frankly the rating says it all. This place cannot be reviewed/rated only. It demands to be felt. Rather tasted. Heavenly. Cult. Heritage. Passion fruit sherbat, Dub sherbat and Green mango creamers are my personal favourites. But each sip you take at Paramount is sheer bliss.

I have passed 19years of my life in college street...so its not very surprising that every nook and corners of this area knows me and I know them...from my school days I saved my pocket money one by one to make a glass of sarbat from paramount...during my college days nothing have changed...so writing a review for this one is a journey through my memory lane...
Ambience: small,clean with marble clad tables and two horns hanging from the wall...this is a picturesque view of paramount
Reception: perfect
Food: mine favorite is coco malai and dab
Price: maybe a bit high according to ambience but I am assuring you that you won't regret.
Higggggghlllly recommended...

The place is very congested.  Sometimes u have  to share your table with other peoples.
Moreover a sherbet 'pista(sum thing)' Costing Rs70 was not really upto the mark, and I felt that the cost was much greater than what it should be.
Not likely to recommend anyone.

Probably one of the best place to quench your thirst. It's a small shop behind college square. They have a variety of shakes available. It's a bit pricey pricey but they are really tasty.

Very few people have actually heard of Nihar Ranjan Majumdar‚Äôs 'Paradise sherbet shop'. But when I start talking about Paramount Sherbets everyone will surely be able to recognize this legend. Name has changed but the place still remains the same, and definitely the quality remains as it is. This legendary sherbet and juice bar still retains the old world charm and teleports you several decades back when you step right in. 

Location ---- Located at Kolkata's 'boi para', this place is next to the Mahabodhi Society (opposite College Square) and the place is infact quite close to the Putiram sweet shop.

Beverages ---- On my last visit (infact I was at Collge street with one of my foodie friends just to spend some time at Paramount!) I tried my favourite below two drinks:

a) Dub Sarbat: It is a refreshing concoction made of sweet soothing coconut-water, the pulp of the tender coconut, crushed ice and some secret syrup. It is a pure joy to try out this drink and I generally take less than one minute to finish off the first glass of Dub Sarbat on a hot summer day! As a matter of fact, this drink was famous even in 1918 when the shop just started operating. Back then the summer coolers (specially the Dub Sarbats) were served to the public and in the backgound something big was actually going on since this place was a hideout for freedom fighters and I have heard that there was one secret room for them at this place! Infact it is said that recipe for this dub sherbet was actually then prepared by the famous scientist Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray!  

b) Green Mango: This is the best refreshing drink I have ever tried. It is made from mango extract, some essence, sugar, salt and crushed ice. If you are here at Paramount then surely do try one glass of Green Mango, it'll be a crime if you don't; infact that is true for the Dub Sarbat as well :)

Ambiance ---- The humble settings, old furnitures, high ceiling fans and old wall hangings give that warm feeling and makes you feel blessed and nostalgic at the same time. It is a small shop and the place is naturally quite cramped up, but when you are here you are actually in a time warp and the thrill is enough to ignore all these petty issues.  

Hygiene ---- Though you may feel that it is not safe to have road-side sarbats, etc on hot summer days, but this is Paramount and things are quite different here. They don‚Äôt use synthetic materials in their beverages and the ingredients are primarily derived from fruit extracts, infact the ice used is being sourced from the same supplier all thoughout these 97 years! The table tops where the drinks are served are made of white marble and are generally kept clean.

Price and Service ---- Nothing much to say, the price at this place has always been very reasonable and it's truly worth every penny. There are no additional taxes charged. The service is very prompt and orders are readily taken and served almost in proper sequence.

Overall ---- The common meeting place for revolutionaries involved in the Swadeshi Movement like Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Pulin Bihari Das, Satin Sen, etc is still standing tall today with all its rich heritage serving those signature beverages and summer coolers to all the die-hard fans, some of them are again legends like Satyajit Ray, Uttam Kumar, Suchitra Sen, Bikash Ray, Shibram Chakraborty, Balaichand Mukhopadhyay, S.D. Burman, and so on. As of today the place highly depends on word-of-mouth advertising and is still going strong even after nearly 100 years! We hope and pray that this Beverage Museum goes strong for the coming 100 years... and more. Long live the legend!

Cheers!

The choice of juices available is very good. Feel like you have just become a par of history. There have a list of people who have visited them in the last 100 years. Yeah, you read it right.... 100 years!! Must try the Daab Sarbat.

Somehow... I do not agree with most of the reviews for this place... Yes this is an old place with decades of serving summer coolers... but the day I went, first there wasnt any one to attend to us... we ordered a cold coffee and a mango lassi.... I could taste the malai in the coffee and the lassi tasted awefully sour... as if gone bad.... we tried to change the mango lassi but it tasted the same and they even tried to convince us that this is what lassi tastes like and we are expecting something else!! Also when we started to leave with the lassi unfinished they got offended and asked us what's wrong with it...

Haven't you tasted yet the "Dub Sarbat" in this scorching heat of summer. Oh my God. You have really missed something eh. Located next to College Square this place has been the favorite for most Bengalis for a long time. ¬†Variety of Sharbats are available for your liking. Choose any one and they wont let you down.
Especially the Green Mango, Kesar Malai and Dub Sarbat are to die for. For us who stay away from home most of the year, this is a must visit every time I visit home.
Its amazing, superb and makes you come back again and again ..

I had always wanted to go to paramount sherbats as I've heard people swear by its sherbats so I finally decided to give this place a try.. Located in the lane opposite to umesh chandra college this place is always flooded with people. U may have to share tables with others cz of the rush.. I ordered the coco malai which is the awesomest drink on the menu, the dab malai sherbat is very refreshing and has the dab malai floating in it. They even have carrying the sherbat home facility at an extra charge of ‚Çπ25 so as I loved the coco malai I took one home back too along with the vanilla cream curd. The vanilla cream curd had become rancid, I wonder how tht happened!!! Guess it was cz of the tormenting heat. So had to throw it away. You have to visit the place if u r in college street.

How can you start describing this place. Its been around college square for like forever and still hasn't lost its charm. One of the few boutique homemade juice centres in Kolkata this place does not disappoint. 

    The shop first comes across as a regular run-of-the-mill place with crude seating arrangements but it does not matter once you have one of their coolers. I personally favour the milk rose but their Dab sherbet is one drink that you must have. You can also have juices packed in bottles which they provide for a nominal extra charge.

 Bon apetit!

Some things are life are so replete with their existence yet so rare in their true essence. Paramount is such a place. You want to know North Kolkata, the true Kolkata? Start by sipping down a drink at Paramount. You watch the hand-pulled rickshaw ply by, book hawkers wavering their hands from their tiny stalls, you watch the occasional nerd with his books, the hormonal teen with his girlfriend and the thousands of literary titles grabbing your attention everywhere just when a tram tries to ram you mid-road. 

It's sensory overload. 

And then you either go cool down splashing water at the College sq. pool; or you take a sip of the elixir that they serve you here. And they know you enjoy a cold drink best when you're hot so they don't have ACs. And then the stuffed antler head, the narrow benches, the handwritten signs.. It's not vintage 2.0. It's vintage 1.0. And nobody does it better than Paramount. 

P.S. Doesn't matter what you order, but my favorite is the coco malai.

Being a student of Calcutta University, College Street Campus it was once a daily go for us to get respite from the hot and humid climate and obnoxious studies. Somedays it would turn into our ADDAKHANA. The small cabin has a old world charm. The people are friendly. Though some sherbets can be called costly comparatively, but they taste good no doubt. The flavoured lassis are good. Specially the green mango flavour. The milk shakes are at par with it. Some of their novelties worth trying are Dub Sherbat and Grapes Crush. They really beat the heat and refreshens you up. Coco Malai is not any novel item, but its good. And their crown jewel (cost wise) PASSION FRUITS is worth trying once. No its not the best in business but good enough. Its base is that of rubri unlike those of lassis and milks, tossed with cashews and raisins. Its rich and a damn belly filler. Enjoy it with your special partner from single glass to feel and pass the real hot passion while sipping chilled sweet drinks :)

Naa...another disappointment! Maybe because of the 'Since' year syndrome that people rate it so high and there's always a queue of people waiting to get in.Personally, I found this place lacking in quality products and the hullabaloo of it being cheap is improper too. The most over rated Dub sharbat is nothing but artificially sweetened tender coconut water served in a glass with some ice. .Coco malai is a misnomer. ..there are blink and miss portions of malai :P....but it was the only One I liked. 90 inr for that. ..now compare that to ...perhaps..the molten chocolate milkshake in chillis at 150inr...I would go for the latter anyday...for the quality....so this place is not cheap....but yeah. .moderately priced... Mango mania ...well it was ok...too much of ice...in something that should be a milkshake. .. makes it taste like a slush....artificial flavours when real mangoes are around the corner. ...is something that I did not understand...keshar lassi...well. ...if a punjabi were to taste it....there would be broken shards of glass everywhere....; )I don't know why it's treated with such respect...maybe the ones who grew up to this place's sharbat still associate with it..a frantic search for books in college street in the sweltering heat...and this place can do wonders in cooling you down...agreed. ..but it was back then..now it has changed. The owners are very old kolkata people and perhaps prize this century old place but they are not taking proper care of it. To up the ante should be their motto now. Century old names might just make you survive while preserving the quality or even bettering it, takes you to a whole another level...perhaps the legendary status is then justified.

Located behind college square, this is the kind of place that fits perfectly into the locality- the old book shops,coffee house and.... Paramount. Their coco malai and dab sherbat is what brings me here, time and again.

You need certain prerequisites to enjoy the quintessential delight.
Go on book hunting for at least 1-2 hours in college street,get your favorite book and then go here and order daab sarbat or coco malai. The unadulterated exquisite taste your taste buds will feel will be totally worth of all the toil.. And who might say, you might even come across some celebrities..As this shop has a cult status and netaji,masterda used to order beverages from this very place..this place is    full with rich history as well with rich delightful beverages.

Perfect place to quench your thirst after shopping books. One of the oldest and popular restaurant was visited by stalwarts like Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, S.D.Burman, Satyajit Ray, Uttam Kumar and many others. My personal favorite is Dub sharbat and recommend to visit at least once to get the feel of old Calcutta a part of present Kolkata.

Paramount is a typical north Kolkata restaurant with a retro ambience. They serve only sherbats and syrups. Every time I visit I feel the legendary reputation they have. In summer this is may be the best place you can find. Every sip of your drink will make you feel. This is a never old place...

When Nihar Ranjan Majumdar‚Äôs Paradise sherbet shop near College Square in central Kolkata opened in 1918 little did they know that one day¬† the shop will be a legend and shrine for all the foodies. 

The famous ‚Äòdub sherbet‚Äô ‚Äî a combination of coconut water, a secret syrup and the pulp of the tender coconut is just like a koh-i-noor of all Sharbats. Beside that I also fond of he Choco Malai and Cream Green Mango.

If you are a person who likes the smell of vanilla and grass (read books) , you'll love walking through the dusty lanes of college street that will take to this small old shop. Irrespective of the flavors that drive you, I would suggest you to try out the soft refreshing 'dab sharbat' ! It's water bewitched!

This is a heavenly place to treat your tastebuds with various sherbats and syrups,specally in this scorching summer.the place is located just behind the college sqaure  and is always crowded. This place is  very small  having a siiting arrangement for max 20 people and it is nt as posh as CCD ,barista or any cosy cafe bt hey who cares.they serve d yummiest chillers and we r nt complaining.infact the place is d oldest juice/syrup/sherbat parlour in kolkata which is running like wild fire till date. We tasted their 2 most popular drinks :daaber saarbat and cocoa malai sherbat and each was fantabulous. No coffee joint or juiceparlour,I repeat no one cn replace them fr sure.

This place is historic... I mean come on from Netaji to Uttam Kumar to JC Bose to Najrul Islam to Banaphool.... and you are literally sitting on the same chairs .. it is priceless... A small joint for sherbats .. and again no AC or nothing... but what it has is just priceless... and not that I am talking about Bengali heritage... this time I am talking about the sheer justice this place does to your taste buds... the best sherbats in Kolkata are served here... And when I say Best I mean it... I tried the Daab Sherbat and the Green Mango cream... and I think of it over and over and OVER again and again... Outstanding blend .... Just can't wait to be here agaainnnn :)
Update : And I went again with my mom, dad and wify... same experience repeated . All are so satisfied . We tried the daab sharbat, had a great conversation with the owner family's 3rd generation daughter. Came to know from her that this is the shop's 97th year, daab sherbat recipe was invented by Acharjya Prafulla Chandra Roy , and it was to ensure the health point of the students... really amazing story... This time I also tried the coco milk shake... But, must admit the daab sherbat ruled everything.

Too many flavours to choose from. Awesomely made sherbats..topped with cream..is really soothing on a hot summer day. Located in college street...it is a famous hangout place for Hindu school and Presidency college students.

My father introduced me to this place. Being a resident of this area for more than 25 years of his time and also being a student of Hindu School and Presidency College and it's subsequent faculty, he was well acquainted with Paramount. So, when he took me there for the first time, he treated me with the best mango sharbat I have ever had. I had never experienced green mango with yoghurt. And after I had that, I could never drink green mango without it. This place has its roots dug very deep in the College Street culture and over the years, they have perfected the way of making sherbat. Starting from their transparent ice to the very delicately balanced consistency of the drink - they have mastered the art. My personal favourite will always be the green mango for personal reasons but that has never held me back from trying Daab Sherbat, Kesar Malai, Rose Malai and Grape.

P.S: The formula for the adorable potion of Daab Sharbat was given by Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray

Paramount smells history,this place itself is a living legend and a witness of the culture and traditions of our city for more than hundred years..It has seen legends, immortals savour its special serbet,the photos of whom u will see hanging in their walls..Legend says the idea of Dab Sherbat was the brainchild of Acharya Prafulla Ch Roy!!!Even in this age of CCD, the marble tob creaky tables,the old decors hold on to its unique charm even amongst the Gen Y..Their unique speciality is indeed their Malai based Sherbat in varied flavours at a minimal pocket pinch..My pop picks include Coco Malai,Pineapple and Rose flavours..
If you haven't visit it yet,u r missing out on a bright spot of Kolkata culture..

Decor - nothing is there. A very age old place having a simple old coffee house type seating arrangement.. but it helps to maintain the traditional image of this place. I have been their 4-5 times. Tasted coco Malai, vanilla Malai, dab sarbat, lassi , mango mania and many more that I couldn't remember.. each one can not be better in taste but it is bit costly... if you want to try the awesomeness of sarbat, you have to visit this place then.

I became friends with College Street and Paramount together on the same day I first came to buy books for college entrances after my boards at College Street. My dad, being a CMC student used to hang out here often as a student. So he brought me here to stroll down his memory lane once again. I was extremely delighted by the ambience and the thought of that so many luminaries have visited here during their times. Cocoa Malai, Daab Sherbat, Rose Malai are my favourites here. I often wished to have Tamarind Syrup but my friends always discouraged me. In my last four years of college life at Presidency, I have come here for only five times. On the first day, dad brought me here. Next, the day I came to collect Presidency previous years question papers with my sister, on my admission day at Presidency with mom and dad again, and later, twice with my friends. I couldn't frequent here much because I never carry sufficient money with me at college. So it's pretty difficult to afford a juice worth 90 bucks for my meal on a day at college. I hope you understand my crisis. But I think, their price rate is very standardized. The quality they give you along with a romantic ambience of nostalgia, is worth it and much better than other branded juice or coffee parlours in the city. It's definitely recommended. You should visit Paramount. You will love it. Happy Dining!

One of the best places in kolkata where you can refresh yourself witha varities of lassi and sherbats (juices)..

Its provides the best quality of drinks and fresh friuits are used in the process..

It's a small very shop..but you can seat indoors..not ample space to seat..generally crowded..customers of all age groups can be found..

It's one of the oldest places where great personalities have visited over the years..

You're welcomed with lots of pictures near the reception with boards descibing its vintage and tradition..

Old is gold..must muat visit..quick service..no worries

This is a heavenly place, particularly in the summers. The old building with its thick walls and high ceilings are airy and the cool marble top tables creates a very relaxed atmosphere. The wall decor akin an old zamindar bari just adds to the old world charm.

The big glasses filled with juices upto the brim... Colourful and delighfully tasty. My favourites are the grape juice, rose and banana. They also sell bottles of these exotic sherbets and mixes. It is a fantastic experirence.

Bracing the heat in summer , sharbats & coolers are often necessary . And when comes to this place , a very old & renowned sharbat den in kolkata . We took Dab Sharbat , Coca Malai & Kesar Lassi . Of which , the last two were good . The Dab Sharbat was average . 

For me , kesar lassi gets a 4.5 , coca malai gets 4 & dab sharbat gets 3.5 . 
All over , a good experience ! :)

I'm a north Calcuttan, hence been quite a regular here. Hung around Presidency and College Street throughout College life ¬†(was an active quizzer) . Still make a point to visit Paramount annually during the months of summer. Went a couple of times in quick succession this month, thanks to school reunion, having discovered batchmates who are also foodies who live in the north, and also once with parents during the Nobo-Borsho weekend. The ambience is that of the vintage old north calcutta baithakkhana - with marble topped tables, and trophy heads of deer mounted on the walls. A special feature is their list of prominent Indian personalities who have been their clientele. I enjoy most of the sherbets, though my personal favourite remains the Cocoa Malai ~ smooth, chilled, just the right flavour of cocoa, nuts and malai, and one delicious drink.

Paramount - the age old name in Sherbats in Kolkata. Located in college street, this place gives you the feel of true Bangaliana, right there from the benches to the board listing the famous names who have put redefined Bengal and made us proud in the World Map too.

Starting with their specialities - Dab Sharbat,Cocoa Malai to the very normal Litchi Syrup to Grapes crush , the sherbats here are refreshing,authentic and an welcome change to the tiring,scorching heat.¬†

Just 1 small advice, so arrive a little early in these summer days if you intend to enjoy the Dab Sherbat as it becomes unavailable pretty early....atleast i have faced so a couple of times post 8pm.

Will be coming back for a number of times to check out all the different sherbats!!

It's a legendary place. I had gone to College Street to buy books and I got tired so I went to this place to quench my thirst. Regardless to say, this place more than lives up to its name. If you compare their prices to the prices of similar items in other parlours and juice shops, you won't notice much of a difference. The distinction lies in the fact that Paramount's sherbets and juices are a hundred times better and more refreshing than other such places.

I would recommend this place to everyone around. You will just love this place as much as I do.

One of the best places for sharbat in kolkata, if not the best. Don't expect 5 start stuff. It's located in college street and basically a students hub. But once you enter you will notice the names of the people who sat on those very benches, who shaped our history. Please try the dabh sharbat, it is magnificent and I bet you cant stop at one. Other sharbats are also nice. One a hot summer afternoon , this is the place to be.

For once atleast , we don't need to walk through a glass door, rest on a sofa, listen to 'tasteful' music and empty all our pockets on a beverage to say - "What an exquisite place!"
Paramount is CALCUTTA in its truest apparition. Dub Serbet and Kesar Malai - Paradise !

One of the best juice shops of Kolkata,since 97 years. It is located just opposite college square. This has been a heritage shop of Kolkata visited by all the famous writers, poets, singers, actors and film makers and in the shop there is a board stating the name of those personalities, who have visited this legendary place. Everything is awesome here. Special Mention : DAABER SHARBAT and CHOCO MALAI, which are house specials for years and they will be. The stuffs are extremely courteous and homely and can suggest u a lot, on what to order. The service is quite prompt as well. Cheers. :D

Despite living in a jet-setting digitised age, this place with its ubiquitous old north kolkata feel have me impressed everytime. It's such a simple sherbet joint that makes scintillating heavenly absolutely marvellous sherbets. Many may frown by it's facade as it's not at all flashy or "cool"/"kewl" but a drink over there will surely make anyone cool and drool, equally. The best part, pocket friendly and hygienic. Love this place. And will forever do so.

Paramount is synonymous to nostalgia, for people like us, who thrived on food joints such as Coffee house and Food-station located in the heart of College street, during our college days. Just a stone's throw away from Presidency, this pocket-friendly sharbat joint, offers heavenly sharbats at dirt cheap rates. Stuffy ambience and cramped seating arrangement notwithstanding, this place rocks.

The sherbets are simply excellent. The most famous I think is 'Daber Sherbet'. A great place on a sultry day to hang out with friends and family. The system of catering and attending to customers is also quite disciplined.

On a Sunday evening, when you've plenty of time in hand and you want to quench your thirst with something refreshing and extraordinary, go to this place.
Paramount is a very small box sized room filled with people who are either waiting for their drinks to be served or are waiting on a queue or are enjoying their oh-so-delicious sherbets. It's a vintage gift to the people of Kolkata, with everything purana zamaana and with everything low on the pockets.
The best of the drinks they have is the Dap-something, mango mania and tamarind crush. I say, go now!

Well...a very tiny place but loadz of reason to admire. I hit up this place with one of my friend on a bright summer sunday morning... We had been walkin for 30 minz under scorching sun and the day was quite humid too. So, no other day could be much more approprite to drop by at Paramount... But... Reaching there ...realized... quenching thirst won't be that easy ... After all...good things are not easily earned :p ... After knocking there, we were informed that the juice parlour is closed and would get opened around 4 o'clock in the evening... We talked to the Owner and told that we have come all the way to have sharbat @paramount ... noticing the keenness in us to have a sip in the sharbats, the courteous propreitor allowed us in and suggested us to try their's signature glass ... Daaber sharbat (Tender coconut Juice)... Since the shop was not open so it took time for the glasses of chilled sharbats to arrive...though we didn't get bored...as we had an interesting talk with the owner Mr. M. Mojumder ...trust me guyz... I have never come across such a courteous , humble and nice proprietor whoes eatry is so eminent. Now...coming to the sharbat... I can bet that this daaber sharbat can't be found in any other place of India.. . It tastes  heavenly and gives an instant bliss the moment you have the first sip and it continues till the very last drop... I would love to land up here again and again.
N.B. (for all those gourmets who are inquisitive about the legends behind dishes and eatry) : The discussion with the Owner , was quite insightful... He is the 2nd generation running this business. His father had started this with the name Paradise sharbat which used to be a secret meeting place of freedom fighters . In the year 1937 it got banned by British government and later was reopend in the name of Paramount... Also, another interesting fact is that the "Daaber sharbat" was a recipe from Acharya Prafulla Chandra Roy... So the Paramount is not only a treat to your taste buds or thirsty throat but also a true insignia of Kolkata‚Äôs past glory and heritage.

Visiting here is one of earliest memories of my life. After school or in the evening used to visit this place with my mom. Always used to fight with her to get a second sherbet. Mine (Superfavorite) is green mango the most i have gone for is 3 glasses in a row. Orange and daab sherbet are also pretty awesome. It has its legacy with visiting dignitaries as such Shri Subhash Chandra Bose. ¬†The peecema ¬†(aunty) there is so lovely & graceful. Love it, for taste or memories that donot know.

A great place to have a few delicious drinks and enjoy the older part of a metropolitan. Amongst the rush of the numerous hawkers, businessmen and book lovers flocking the place, you do see these vintage eateries featured in countless movies, songs and books. On a humid afternoon amid all the sweat and exhaustion it is not a bad idea to settle for a mango sherbat or a glass full of ¬†'dub' (coconut) water! The kesar sherbat is equally mouth watering and gratifying all the same!

Was just there a few days back.. Umm.. Ordered their famous Cocoa Malai, Daab Sherbet and the Tamarind Sherbet.. Cocoa Malai was "meh" as it mostly tasted like Complan or Bornvita mixed with some Malai and dry fruits! Then tasted the Daab Sherbet.. and it was delightful.. It was hot that day and it refreshed my inner soul! A heavenly drink with a great amount of Daab Malai in it! Last the Tamarind Sherbet came and it was also a great drink! It was again refreshing, spicy and sour! So, all in all, the experience was great as you sit there and see the big list of famous people who have stepped in this Sherbet Heritage.. The Ambiance takes you back many decades.. Price is little bit on the higher side but it's "K"!! Cheers!!

Yesterday visit this legendary shop for the first time. The location is Surya Sen Street, College Street, Near College Square. Many famous personal have visited this place like Netaji, Najrul Islam, Jyoti Basu, Satyajit Roy and many more. It is 100 years of age. There is no sitting place available when I enter but I got one seat after few time. I ordered cream lassi. Just mouth watering taste...noting to say.. I will visit this place again I get a chance and that will be with family. Then I will taste another flavor it may be coko malaai.

This is Must visit shop. Don‚Äôt miss away.

This restaurant has been around since since 1918.Till today it is run by the same family who started it. The third generation is running it now. Incredible ‚Äì that‚Äôs what keeps it going. The shop has a list of famous people of Bengal who have visited this shop. Some of the names include netaji subhash Chandra Bose, Satyajit Ray, Meghnad Saha, Jagadish Chandra Bose, Uttam Kumar, Suchitra Sen, etc. The ceiling of this old building is obviously ‚Äòkori kaath‚Äô ‚Äì metal & wood beams that was characteristic of buildings of that time. The concept of this restaurant is interesting. A sharbat store with proper seating arrangement like a restaurant, servers coming & taking order & serving the sharbat - quite unique I must say! I have visited here a million times (each time with different company). So today I am reviewing my latest visit.¬†

The co-owner lady like every time suggested some good sherbets. We started with Daab sharbat. Marvellous. Daab water formed the base. The malai of coconut was floating in the sharbat. We were given spoons to enoy the malai. The sharbat was thickened a bit from the daab water texture & was flavoured as well. The external vanilla like flavor & the daab flavor both made their presence felt.¬†

We moved on to Green mango sharbat. The concentration of this has been made by them in-house. The Green mango sharbat tasted a bit like the synthetic green mango jelly that is available in the market. This sharbat was in a dahi base. Tasted very good on its own but very different from what I thought it would be.¬†

Next sharbat we had was Tamarind sharbat. This turned out to be the best in the lot. Intense taste & flavor. Great balance of sweet, salt & sour. Very good flavor of tamarind. It was simply marvelous.¬†

Lichu sharbat was recommended by the lady. It was wonderful as well. A tad more sweet but outstanding flavor of lichi. Sucked it till the last drop!¬†

Last sharbat we had was milk based ‚Äì Kesar malai. This one turned out to be sub optimal when compared to thick & rich North Indian Doodh based sharbats. The one at Paramount was average in taste and quite "diluted" in consistency. Though it had some malai onto it, but it didn't the drink. The only letdown so far.¬†

Quite naturally, this isn't my final visit. I will be visiting here countless times with new people and new memories!

Paramount offers the best sherbats in Calcutta, Period! Trust me. I have tasted various kind of mocktails/fruit juices/sherbats from various drink-joints in Kolkata and other cities as well! But nothing can match the quality Paramount offers! If you consider taste of food to be the primary factor of any restaurant, then most definitely you'll fall in love with this once you get a taste of Ravri-based Passion fruit sherbat or cocoa malai (the top two items in their menu). If you're a first timer, then I'd suggest to try any of these two sherbats. Though ambiance is okay-okay type, but I loved the old charm of it. Service is awesome and we had a very nice and heart-warming chat with the man who has been serving the drinks over there from its birth-time. Lovely experience!

Paramount ~ chilling your soul since decades. Heard of this place, but somehow never got opportunity to quench my thirst here. One fine day, been there and bang on!!! Lovely experience.

Ambiance: A golden touch of old Calcutta, Traditional. Small place with few seating arrangements. Obviously you don't expect cozy environment here, but a heart warming one. 3.5/5

Service: The staffs are polite and courteous. Always at your help. 4/5

Beverages: To me, one of the best sherbat joints in town, in terms of quality and variety. Very reasonable. Out of many varieties, my personal favourite is daab sherbat, passion fruit, cold coffee, coco malai with dry fruits topping, kesar malai. Each of them tastes delicious and has distinct flavor. 4.5/5

A must visit place if I hit college st area.

Okay now back to reality. Coffee House and Paramount are like 2 heritage food destinations for us, but there is a huge difference between them. The consistent good quality that Paramount holds is really appreciable. Ordered cocoa malai and passion fruit. Both were up to the expectations.
For those who have sweet tooth, go for rubri based drinks.
Apart from these Dab sarbat is a good pick for calorie conscious ones.

It took us almost half an hour to order two dab sherbats which were refreshing! Also we tried kesar lassi and that really served to its fame. Price is moderate and ambiance is very comfortable for long talks r gossips.One of the old beverage points in the city and u will surely love to visit again.

Well I know its an institution of a place and all that jazz so will not go there. Simply going to share what my experience was. 
Went to this place with a friend so managed to ordered two drinks- kesar lassi and lemon syrup sherbat. 
‚Ä¢ Kesar lass- just like your everyday average lassi from any random shop, hence nothing great. 
‚Ä¢ Lemon syrup sherbat- kickass! Indeed a great drink which not only refreshed the taste buds but also the mind. 
Advice- order anything apart from the lassi. 
Ambience wise the place still gives the aura of an age old joint which has aged well over time. Cheers.

After a little work went to this place with fellow zoman @Petal. Being a localite of central Calcutta and growing up pretty close to college street none of us were strangers to this place's fame and heritage. Umm there's not much to write about the place the decor is quaint and complements the place just right. The sorbets they serve are "good" but definetly not a bang for the bucks. The quantity is quite less. The staff are rude they will both say and show their inhospitality. Maybe its about time they expand. Oh they have a very limited number of tissue! When asked for one they got one after ages wrinkled and only ONE.

This is not a review. This is just my pleasure to pay the homage to this legend. Since childhood, everytime I go there and they spellbound me with the same traditional flavour and taste that is equally refreshing as the last time. Not sure why they do not expand the space or branches all over the city with a more smart and trendy look and feel. Many of the newer generation of the city are not aware of this place and they are unaware of what they are missing. During rush hours, space is a problem but I would happily stand outside on pavement and wait long to get the divine taste.

The pride of Kolkata -  Paramount Serbets. Been coming here since I was a child. They have been successful in keeping the quality of their drinks unadulterated through all this time. The coolers are a real welcome in summer. The first thing you notice when you enter the place is the loooong list of names of famous people including the likes of Netaji and Uttam Kumar, and the bevy of newspaper cutouts dedicated to this heritage outlet. The quality of their drinks is excellent, be it Dab Sherbet or Cocoa Malai or Rose Syrup. All in all, a must visit, especially in summer. Personal recommendation - Dab Sherbet, Passion Fruits and Cocoa Malai.

This is a must-visit place. Unlike many legendary old restaurants which just go by their old staggering name and goodwill and have been deteriorating over the years, ¬†this place really lives up to its fame and name.¬†
I've been coming here since I was a toddler. Later this became our adda joint in my college years. This is a small place. You might have to wait for a while before you get a seat during the sultry summer days. But the wait, however long, would be worth it.¬†
The staff is very courteous and friendly. Service is good.¬†
Coming to the main thing, their sherbets. The Green Mango was my first drink here. It still tastes the same, simple, yet awesomely delicious (with or without cream). The Dab sherbet is a must-try. So is the Cocoa malai, Passion fruit, Tamarind syrup (for those who like tangy flavours), Rose sherbet, ¬†. In short everything.

This has always been the best sharbat place in kolkata. No CCD mojitos,no KFC krushers can match their level.¬†
This is located in the heart of College Street boi para. This has enough seating arrangement to accomodate around 40-50 heads at a time.Believe me you do not need an air conditioning environment inside because it is located at the ground floor of a Old Kolkata House which belongs to the Paramount's family. IT is so airy and provides us a comfortable¬†environment.
I have been there with my friends a lot of times and have tried out dab sharbat, coco malai sharbat, passion fruits sharbat almost every time. It was worth it.One must definitely try out these three.¬†
This place gives you a completely old kolkata feeling as great Bengali stalwarts like Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose,Meghnad Saha, Mrinal Sen,Satyajit Ray, Amartya Sen, Saurav Ganguly etc had come to this place to quench their thirst.
And when it comes to money it is absolutely reasonable as most of the drinks are priced around 50/60 Rs. Cocoa-Malai costs 100 Rs and Passion Fruits costs 120 Rs.¬†
A complete value for many place in my opinion.

I went to this old juice centre on the recommendation of one of my relatives who had studied in Presidency College and been there numerous times. Old and 'colonial' feel comes naturally as we enter the area. I ordered Dab Sharbet, and I bet I have never drank anything like that before. It was pure coconut drink with the coconut 'malai' giving all the flavors. I kept on drinking it slowly so as to enjoy every sip of it. I hope to come to this place once again in future.

The only and only thing that is important is the taste, and value for money ! And Paramount Sherbats and Syrups is a bang  on example. Taste is heavenly, doesn't make a hole in your pocket and I love the laid back environment there. P.s - You HAVE to visit this place !

The ambience out here is similar to the black and white bengali movies from that of 70's but the main attraction of this place is the sherbets. My personal favourites from this place are cream of vanilla , dub sherbet and malai. I don't know how they are made but they are something which are from heaven.

In a hot sweltering afternoon while we were in college street one of my friend's suggested   that we grab a sherbat and when i was told this place was like a 100 yrs old i was immediately interested......so as we entered dis place it was no fancy CCD or MAMAMIA....it reeked of the old calcutta charm nd was filled with pictures of celebrities who had visited this place all over their walls ....so coming to the sherbat though my friend went for the Daab sherbat which is their legedary drink , i choose to stick to the Pineapple Milkshake.....ohhh and this milkshake was no ordinary milkshake....there was a thick layer of malai rabri on the top of the milkshake which was rich and cream simply heavenly and while sipping onto it i discovered there was another similar layer.....it was so good i ordered another glass and was quite full so much so had to skip my lunch.....

College street and its surroundings kind of represents a different 'Calcutta' within our known city. The foodie map of the area is bound to establish the fact too with cabins,coffee house and old school sweets and snacks shops adding to the romance. Now coming to Paramount when there was no CCD,chocolate or juice parlors to hang out,erstwhile Hindu College students like Subhas C.Bose chose this place for the purpose!!
This has been a go to place for many like me for a very long time.Nowadays it often takes some time to grab a place here.But the time spent over the great sherbets make up for it.The kesar malai,orange and pineapple malai tastes really good,but for me the Green mango stands out.
This place deserves a sure shot 4,but the history is bound to get it a notch higher!!!
And don't forget to browse through the list of distinguished people who had been here! Places like these are not only for food or juices,they add to the flavor,aroma,history and essence of the Kolkata :)

This place is a heritage. A legendary beverage shop with an arsenal of magnificient drinks that will make you drool. Such good quality at so cheap rates is just an understatement. Quantity is pleasing. coco malai with dry fruits on top, fruit punch wid rubree base, dub sarbat, green mango sharbat, kesar malai, rose malai and I ¬†can keep on going. I want to try each of their drinks. Every one of them has impressed me to my fullest. A must visit place.

No soft drinks giant can ever do what Paramount does. With their sheer quality and perfect blend of ice and sherbat and juice, every single glass of every single juice or sherbat is sure to give you a glimpse of Nirvana, more so when it's scorching hot outside.

I was introduced to this place by a friend post a tedious book hunting spree one afternoon and I was lucky to introduce another dear dear friend to this legendary joint, last year.

I had recommended the daab sherbat to him and the look on his face after the first sip was clue enough that Paramount had claimed another soul to their ever growing fan club. He looked like a baby who had discovered a new thing. He gulped down the first glass and we immediately knew that we both wanted another glass of the same.

He is not from Kolkata originally and I felt proud to show him the list of famous personalities who have been there. After two glasses of the daab sherbat, nd soaking in the history around him... It became an afternoon he would always remember and the memory would linger in his mind like the colour sherbets of this historic joint.

Delicacy served in a glass.That is Paramount for you.
One of my most favourite eateries in North Kolkata,Paramount Sherbets makes me happy every time.
The green mango sherbet is a life saver on a hot day.The yoghurt mixed with the tang of the mango syrup is a lingual orgasm.
The grape crush was light,cool,delicious.But the people favourite is the daab sherbet-refreshing and delightful.
A must visit.

I always visit here whenever i come to college street to buy books!! I love their syrups more than their other varieties. Also the green mango with cream is a must try as i find it the best among the cream content drinks.

Happy drinking fellas :D

Tried it's Dab Sherbet. I loved the chilled refreshing drink of coconut water with the 'malai' of the coconut and a little rose essence.
On a previous visit I had tasted the green mango cream syrup. The taste was good. It was creamy curd like syrup with artificial flavour.
The place is situated in the bylanes of the college street and so a little help from the other shops would lead you to this place which is present since 1918.
Next time I am here, I shall go for the others on the menu.

PARAMOUNT-The name says it all. It is indeed the paramount when it comes to the exquisite sherbats and juices! One can indulge in the famous Dub sherbat, Cocoa malai or kesar malai which can definitely make one come back to this joint over and over again. The Dub sherbat is a must try when one comes to this place. The syrups are also good especially the Green mango and orange syrups. The price is reasonable. The staff is polite and warm in their gesture. It is not a very big joint but because they serve people fast, you get chaired in no time. Go for this joint when you are at College street and taste the best of the sherbats.  :)

I have no words for this venue as this is one of my favourites in the city. I have been to this place 9/10 times and returned each time with total refreshment and satisfaction. The best time to drop at this venue is on a hot Summer afternoon when you have finished all your energy roaming for books at college street.

Now comes the menu - 10/10 for the Dub Sarbat. This is a chillar - a fresh jump-start to your battery when you are tired and out of energy. They have just blended the perfect drink.

Cocoa malai is tremendously rich will lots of cashew, almond, pista and a creamy rich smooth drink. One of the best recommended. I have had almost all the malai varieties that are served over here and also most of the cream ones. By best is pineapple malai and cream green mango.

Do the place need renovation? I would suggest No, it is good as it is. The old decor - a symbol of the bygone days of Kolkata when it was Calcutta - and the nostalgia of eating at a place which was once infested by the likes of Subhash Bose, Satyajit Ray, JC Bose, Uttam Kumar etc.

Overall hugely recommended and a perfect 5/5 for this place.

A treasure in the heart of old Calcutta!

A very old place next to theosophical society in college street, more like a corridor converted into a watering hole decades before the economy was set free for invasion of foreign brands in 1991. This belongs to a time when there were no aerated drinks and the goodness existed in the great sherbets and juices this place creates!

Their dab Sharbat is great and refreshing, my all time favorite. The malai sherbet is good too like any other on the vintage menu that is hung from the wall. 

A must visit!@

One of the best heritage restaurants, Paramount offers the best Sherbats in Kolkata. One should always visit this place to try the different variety of sherbats. Choco malai, kesar malai, Rose sherbat, coconut sherbats are wonderful. Passion fruit sherbat is the best of them all, as it is garnished with a layer of malai, cashew nuts and raisins.

Paramount is one of those legendary places which everybody just knows about. The specials in their menu are awesome (I sampled the Coco Malai and Dub Sherbet) and you should directly go for these. A straight 5/5 for the specials as long as you don't care about the ambience. But the regulars could be pretty dodgy. I tried their Cream Green Mango and the cream was pretty stale. Didn't like it really.

Strongly recommended to try their specials without giving a flying freak about their ambience.

At reasonable price, Paramount is the perfect place to sit and chill after a long tiring day. The drinks are original and authentic which will be an instant favourite. My favourite is the Choco Malai. Although the seating is a bit of a problem, with cramped seating and very few tables. But if you go in the off hours, away from the college traffic, you can delve into Paramount's magic.

Again one of those things that one must do before one dies, especially if you have the Calcutta Connect.
It is old , charming, nostalgic, tell-tale of the old world that this city was once a part of. I attended the Calcutta University, so Paramount was to me back in 2005, what CCD is to college-goers now. Only it was more affordable, more healthy, flavorful, and though minus the jazz - a lot more interesting!
Try their daab sharbat - a unique twist to the tale of coconut water...my personal favorite is rose sharbat and rose milkshake (yes, I am a fan of rose). Also chocolate lovers may like their cocoa-malai shake, which is new addition.
The pocket pinch is very low, and the experience priceless.
If you are a visitor, do try Paramount!

This is one of a kind place. Once used to shelter revolutionaries in the pre-independence era, now its a sweet oasis on a hot, tar melting college street afternoon. Dab sarbet is the crowd puller but green mango and kesar malai has takers too. Crampy seating compensated by polite service. A must visit if you are in college street in summer time.

Though it's kind off a heritage in college street so seating capacity is not increased to keep in touch with its heritage.

A small little heritage place tucked away in college street, this place is a must visit for anyone looking to enjoy a blast of flavours for a very affordable price! I visited this place yesterday and was suitably impressed by the place. As you enter the owner greets you with a beaming smile and welcomes you inside. I ordered a cocoa malai and was very very impressed by the sherbet. A chocolate flavoured drink with a layer of malai and dry fruits on top of it. A gastronomic delight is an apt word to describe the taste. In the times of CCD and other coffee joints, this place surely stands out.

Its very rare that sherbets can act as a sumptuous meal and make you cringe for more. Sometime somethings are best left unsaid to preserve its beauty and paramount is one such thing. I went with a friend of mine and we tasted all the sherbets till we were absolutely full. From dub sherbet to cocoa malai, vanilla malai, mango malai and passion fruit we tasted as much as we could and each of them were exquisite. Cocoa malai was the show stealer for me.
A must must visit for everyone and their hospitality is so sincere and genuine.we were shown some articles written about them from BBC and it was so friendly.
Experience it yourself if you haven't experienced it yet.

Was planning on visiting this place for a long time. Finally went there today with a friend. It's located just behind college square.
The ambiance is typically that of north Calcutta. The warmth with which they serve their customers is truly amazing. The thing that I especially liked about this place is inspite of being such an old joint its spotlessly clean and not shabby unlike coffee house. Maintainance is superb.
Now coming to the juice we had ordered one cocoa malai and one dub shartbat as I have heard numerous stories about these two. The choco malai was too good. The chocolaty sharbat with malai on the top sprinkled with cocoa powder and cashews is worth dying for. Dub shartbat had bits of coconut skin in it and tasted awsum. Pure bliss.
Service is very prompt and they ask for feedback and suggestions which is probably why they have sustained all over these years. The owner is very cordial and on learning that we were 1sr timers there he took special care of us.
They even have a list of the names of eminent personalities who have visited this place. It consists of names of ppl like Acharya prafulla Chandra roy and the famous dub sherbat was actually his favorite.
Overall a great experience. U'll get CCD and Baristas everywhere u go but this is truly a gem of a place with its old world charm which serves traditional and authentic sharbats at damn cheap price. Will b revisiting to try out the other varieties. Great expectations from here. Keep up the good work:-)

You enter Paramount and instantly you are transported back to a bygone era, a yesteryear's Kolkata. Some places are heritage, this place is one such place. You take the lane opposite to Presidency University main gate, travel the length of College Square, take a right and the place falls on your left side after about 10 feet walk. The tables are age old, with white marble tops that are always clean, instead of chairs you find small wooden benches to sit. The walls are adored with old photographs. ¬†Even the Sign outside is as old as the shop. My all time favorite choice is the Cocoa Malai. A frothy milky drink that is topped with crushed khowa kheer and sprinkled with chocolate (cocoa) powder. ¬†Recently, I am seeing that they have added some new mixes on the menu like Vanilla Malai and Banana Malai (!!!). Earlier it just used to be Cocoa Malai and Rose Malai. The Passion Fruits is also a new addition and looks inviting. Have to visit to try that. The Daab Sarbat is the signature. Its very soothing on a hot summers day when you are parched to your core. But I sometimes find it too sweet.¬†
Some places are great due to their sheer presence, due to their resistance to change, due to their fondness of the old. Although I see the management has revamped the menu quite a bit, I just hope that they have not replaced the heritage character of this place.

Paramount is undoubtedly one of the legendary outlets in kolkata and has maintained its heritage for ages. It definitely bears the traditional feel of old kolkata. Needless to say its juices and syrups r a delight to have. U don't have to carry a huge amount in ur pocket to visit this place as it is damn affordable, rather cheap. Though it's a small and cosy place one would enjoy spending time over a juice over here.

The taste of Kolkata is incomplete without paying a visit to Paramount . It is salvation for souls scorched in summer heat roaming in College Street , hopping from one bookstall to another. Rich with its own heritage of famous celebs paying visit from time to time , Paramount is a living legend. What catches my eye everytime is the deer head hung on their wall . The drinks are great and one should definately try the KESAR MALAI , DAB SARBAT and GREEN MANGO SHERBET.

The tastiest Dub sherbat you could ever have in the whole kolkata is undoubtedly 'Paramount'. Situating on the just opposite of the college square in between the book shops It is a small sherbat centre with a huge range of sarbats and syrups with great tastes. And everyone should definitely try the sherbats here. 

Tip: Dub sherbat, Strawberry sherbat and the Kesar malai are must try

I have been visiting this place when I was a kid. What fascinates me most is that my father had been visiting this place since his childhood. Even my grandfather had visited the place since his college days. No ccd no baristas can match the Sherbet this place can serve. During my Presidency College days this had always been our favourite adda place. I have ordered almost every item on their menu card. But i love most the cocoa malai and pineapple malai. Even today it is one of my favourite hangout places

Paramount is located behind College Square among a bevy of shops. There's an old-world , vintage feel to the place. I had ordered both of Dab Sherbet and Kesar Malai Sharbet. The service was quite quick and the staff was cooperative.  I heard the staff recommending the Paramount Special Sherbets to a few customers. The Dab Sherbet came with the Coconut Cream (Shaash) but was ridiculously ordinary. I had ordered the Kesar Malai Sherbet to be packed for home. The Kesar Malai felt like a cold,  cheap , watery dilemma and failed to live up to its name.  Really disappointed.

once great,now just a good juice bar in central kolkata books and publishing neighbourhood,bankim chatterjee street,opp college square tank and calcutta university.the price increase has been steep,and unaffordable almost,for the students ,who are the main clients.was a regular here in the eighties,our medical college days.now in middle age,i find the outlet standing as in a timewarp with vintage furniture,the old world smell ,only the price tag has gone through the roof.old familiarity and a fancy for the sherbet taste not found anywhere else brings me here.the miniscule 200 ml creamy layered juice should be enhanced to bigger glass of 300 ml at least to justify the price.orange cream sherbet is the flagship recipe and tastes well.the owners seem to be interested in cash register these days instead of thinking about customers.they have to change course to make the outlet survive.

No matter how many swanky cafes or bistros pop up in Kolkata, some iconic places still hold their ground firmly. Paramount Sherbats is a case in point.
Being a Presidencian, I've been to this place umpteen times and my all time favourites are coco malai & green coconut sherbat. The strips of tender "daab'r shaansh" floating on top of the crushed ice and the drink with a mild vanilla flavour is simply out of the world !!!!

If you want to get drunk and not want to have alcohol for it, Paramount is the place to be. The drinks are heavenly. The place is cramped but has a vintage feel to it with marble slabbed tables. A chat with the owner reveals the rich history of the place and its drinks.

If you haven't tasted Paramount's dub sarbat then you surely have missed a lot, to feel the refreshing taste of a dub sarbat. The inside of this heritage place comprises of newspaper cuttings and pictures on the walls, of renowned personalities those who have visited there over the years. We visited there a week ago and when we heard that the dub sarbat wasn't available, and was informed it would take about 2 hours, we decided to come back after 2 hours. After roaming about in the narrow lanes of college street when we came back, it was there, the dub sarbat. And over the years it tastes the same, awesome and refreshing. Though the other sherbats are also good but dub sarbat remains by personal favorite. So try it the next time you go there if you haven't had it yet and thank me later.

Coming to college street for me is synonymous to coming to Paramount. This almost century old Sherbet den makes the best sherbet in town! Extraordinary taste and traditional homely atmosphere is their USP. Grape Crush, Coco Malai, passion fruit, etc are the show stealers.. But the jewel in the crown is Daaber Sharbat! Tender juicy creamy malai of young coconut lost in cocunut flavored chilled sweet drink. Yummiest beverage possible! A must visit for all! 
Price was slightly raised since last time. A glass of Daab er Sharbat costs 50, Coco Malai is at 90. Still way better than the usual beverages Kolkata has to offer!

A place where I always drop in to hunt my college memories back. A small room with benches and ceiling fans hanging from the roof giving it an old look. Since college days its one of my most visited  place for a refreshing glass of sherbat. Pineapple Malai  is my favorite but the Grapes Crush & Special Kesar Lassi is also worth a go. Dab Sharbat is their "award-winning drink". They even have a take away facility and I always carry a bottle back home. For those who feel the place is pricey, these bevarages give you more bang for your buck. Of course there are plenty of other milk shakes & syrups which can fall under your choices too.

Its a traditional environment, not like the modern cafeterias. Great service and superb (best till date) quality sherbets. Tastes awesome!
Only thing is that they won't serve you without ice.
Pricing is on the higher side but considering the quality they provide, spending extra bucks won't be a problem!
Just give it a try if you want world class sherbet experience!

Location:- just behind college square premises.

Ambience:- One of the oldest in kolkata hence it reflected in the ambience. Walls have pictures of various renouned artist visiting the place and also cut outs from some renouned food magazines over the year.

Food:-
They are sherbhat speacilist hence you will get the best  variety of your choice.
Milkshakes and daab sarbhat r the must try..

Pocket pinch-100 for two

Conclusion:- This place has been serving one of the best sherbats for a decade now. Their low pocket pinch is also appealing to the students who come to buy books. Its a must try for kolkatan.

A place which attracts me whenever I go to collage street area, there is a very few shops left in Kolkata which is still carrying this Sherbat culture, Paramonut is one or I should say the leader among them, its carrying the same old legacy proudly since 1918, and serving lakhs and lakhs of happy customers every day.
It is very hard for me to explain about the taste of the Sherbat getting served over their, the only thing I can tell you that the first sip will tell you what its all about.
Every time I go over there can't hold myself but ordering 2-3 flavours, I force my friends to take different flavours so that I could taste as many as possible. With the time Paramount is coming out with new innovative tasty flavours of Sherbats, but the Dub Sherbat is the only one of its kind, you will never find this one any where else, each and every time I visit Paramount I never ever missed a single time to order this one except this onet he Green Mango, Coco Malai, Passion Fruit Malai, is a must try. You have to visit quite a few times to try all the flavours.¬†
Personally recommend all food lovers to give this one at least one try, I am sure you will visit the place once again.

Decent enough. Warm service. A nice touch of hospitality from a bunch of Bengalis. A place to have little chit chats. A place for unconventional dating. And moreover a place to start your sherbet expedition in and around Kolkata. Heritage is the keyword. Regular college street goers like me sometimes love to get the warmth. Do drop in. Kolkata never disappoints. :)

Price, waiters' behaviour, quality, taste, quantity - a perfect combination of these five gives you a 'sarbot parlour' called Paramount. They are a parlour with legacy and the important thing is  that they still maintain the policy of "customer satisfaction above all". A perfect gateaway on a sultry summer evening in Kolkata, I would highly recommend all Zomatians to pay a visit to Paramount.

You will probably just pass by without even realising that it was actually Paramount! The choice of juices available is very good. Feel like you have just become a par of history. There have a list of people who have visited them in the last 100 years. Yeah, you read it right.... 100 years!! Must try the Daab Sarbat, Coco Malai,Green Mango Juice and offcourse the Fruit Punch With Rabri base ...

Its something which goes with your pocket and meet your quench. Especially in hot and humid summer afternoon,when you are tired, stale and impatient after visiting college street book stores for hours. I have started visiting here since I was in my second year of college. My ex made me visit there ¬†-_- . Its so popular among people that i don't think i have to tell where it is actually. What they offer is SARBAT, but these are divine. I am not mentioning any particular drink that one should have, If you have thirst left and you can spend;try everything they offer(they don't have washroom,so think before you order all the drinks"lol")... #Happydays

Our usual hang-out place whenever I visit College street. Its about 5 minutes walk from the Presidency college gate. Well, it's unbelievable when you see the variety of sherbets and juices available...I have personally tried almost all the types....there is particularly one whose name I can't remember...chocolate based...which I love the best. I would recommend this place to everyone who would want to try out large variety of juices in such a low price. Superb Place, we should have more branches around south kolkata.

I have heard about it for several times especially from my math tutor. Had this on my wish list for a few months and I wanted to tick it off for a long time. Thanks to pandel hopping, went straight to the restaurant after coming out of college square puja mandap. My goodness that long a queue for a glass of sherbat but trust me that was worth it.
We had DAB SHERBET (COCONUT) and VANILLA MALAI (MILK). The queue was long but the service was quick and the refreshements were great.
The vanilla drink was topped with rabri, cashew and raisins.
I would definitely be there to try the coco malai.

The speciality of Paramount which I have seen in naked eye is the ecstasy of background.However the drinks are quite good.The The drinks are something that must claims originality.You can sit there,taking sips of drinks,can spend a good time with your family,friends or partner.But one thing I should add,it is one of the oldest beverage site of kolkata .They can modernize its interior decoration by retronize it a little more.Otherwise the atmosphere as well as drinks are something that works as positive catalyst to go the Paramount more than once.

I can't believe that the people of Kolkata gave so cold-hearted review about this place. No, I did not study in any institution around College street, but I have¬† very emotional bond with this shop. 

Tip #1: Go there thinking it as a museum.

Tip#2: Talk to the owner(s).

Tip#3: Appreciate the 100-years-old imported Italian marble table tops and the Deer horns. Notice that one of those tables does not have the same table top. Ask the owner why not. Ask who discovered the Daab Sherbet.

Do you know what Sherbet means? It means to welcome. Paramount taught me that. There are things beyond business. North Kolkata reminds you of that, and to truely appreciate the sherbet of Paramount, you would have to learn that. E Kolkatar majhe achhe ar ekta Kolkata.

I've heard about this place A LOT, seen their hospitality on NDTV Good Times as well. But when I visited the place I wasn't quite happy. I called for a Passion Fruit Sherbat - Not to mention the quality of which was outstanding. As you might see in the picture, the drink is rich, flavored with passion fruit, comes garnished with cream slices, cashews and almonds! But soon after I had my first sip of the Epic Passion Fruit Sherbat, I found a tiny little hair floating on the outside of the drink. The owner asked me to relax and he made another one! I really don't care how the taste is but hygiene is poor. Enough said.

P.S: Photo might just make you happy, but mind the hygiene whenever you go.

There is nothing extraordinary about the place. Runs because of its heritage.

However if you are planning to hit college street, then this must definitely be on your 'to visit' list. you only get sharbats here. The best ones would be cocoa malai, dab sharbat, lemon syrup and kesar and rose malai.

Service: Expect the glasses to arrive pretty soon after the order.

Ambiance: The place is very small but I do not have anything to complain about.¬†

DO not go to this place with high expectations. Go there to explore one of the oldest sharbat outlets in kolkata

The ever increasing price is a concern for my friends. Personally when I am near this place, I make it a point taking them inside and enjoy a glass of cold coffee. We are not a big fan of the cream based sorbets, Cocoa Malai is an exception. Another one Dab Malai stands a favourite amongst the crowd, though I don't know may be the day I tried it something was not that appealing about it, and I never tried it again. The ambience includes a giant deer horns, which I keep looking at every time I visit this much (so north..)

What new can i say about this place which is so famous among the people of kolkata ?
No CCD, coffee shop or juice parlour can challenge their *to die for * sharbats.
Very economical, not at all pricey, more popular among students .
It doesnt have the great ambiance and decor, but thats ¬†just ¬†a minor thing when u drink their sharbat .
All of their sharbats are equally good , but my personal favourite is the Daab Malai .¬†
Its a treat for everyone and to tackle the humid weather of Kolkata¬†
Just one thing lacking..Cleanliness. They really need to work on that. If that can be fixed , then this place is great to go :)

One of the heritage places of Kolkata located in the busiest College Street, this is one place you would love to visit to refresh yourself, especially during the hot and humid afternoons.

The place has an old charm about it. Like back to the olden times. A simple area, with fans running, and a few benches to sit on. We ordered a Kesar malai first. It was creamy, cold and yummy. The grapes crush was equally good, the crumbles of grapes moving in your mouth would be tingling. The orange syrup was tangy in taste and very refreshing too. The prices ,but , are a little high compared to the amount they serve. A 80 or 100 bucks for sherbats would be a bit heavy on the pockets.

But still, this place will definitely be worth trying to refresh yourself ! :-)

The place still holds on to the old world charm with the same simplistic decor and bench-style seating arrangements where great Bengalis from novelists to freedom fighters have enjoyed their 'sherbets'. You will find the list of all such famous Bengalis along with some of their pictures.
Their famous 'daaber sherbet' is ideal during summer months as a thirst quencher. I have tried their mango 'lassi' but did not quite like it. I felt the yoghurt was not thick enough and diluted with a lot of ice.
But, I am absolutely in love with the Passion Fruit sherbet and you just keep guessing as the different fruit flavors hit you. It contains wood apple (bael), mango, and many other fruits. It is a must try if you happen to drop by in College Street, especially on a hot afternoon.

If you are thinking of visiting this place, don't wait any longer. This is one of the best places for sherbats and syrups across Kolkata. The Daab Malai is a treat, and not only for a sultry, Kolkata summer afternoon. It is a revelation at anytime of the day. I also love the Rose Malai and the Passion Fruits. It is a must visit if you are in vicinity.

Yes true, it is one of the heritage places in kolkata. But, Paramount has surely degraded the quality of drinks that they serve. I had visited this place, once in 2013 and today was the second time. My first experience was way too good. I just loved their drinks. But this time, I was utterly disappointed. This is because, the have degraded the quality of their drinks. Previously, it used to be thick. But, now it's only ice, and water. However, since it is one of the oldest places, and a very very popular one. I would say, if you haven't tried their drinks, you should try it at least once.

One of the unique places to visit in College Street Area in Kolkata for its amazing Dab Sherbat and other varieties of sherbats. I loved the normal Daab Sherbat... it was super tasty and the kernel added inside the glass added to the essence. The Cocoa Malai sherbat is another must have drink to be tried here. Its made of Coconut water, chocolate and almonds. ¬†You have to stir it first and then sip it at intervals to make the taste linger in your mouth for a while. Its a heritage place which you should not only for the drinks but also to have a feel of Kolkata before Independence. There is a board on which you will find the names of famous people who visited Paramount and tried the drinks here. The first name you read is Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose followed by Satyajit Ray, Uttam Kumar, Suchitra Sen, etc etc

Ya, it's featured in the Legendary Collection of Zomato and it's apt. Location is good, preparations are awesome, the shop is running from a century now I guess - so, it's deserving enough to be featured in the Legendary section. If you enter the shop you will find there's a list of respectable people (read legends) who have visited it in the past and cut outs from the newspapers in which it was featured. The sherbats are just mind-blowing and you will never get such taste in any other shops in the city. I am not comparing its menu with the beverages provided by CCD, trust me Paramount have got some preparations which no other juice bar can match. The menu has a lot of items to choose from. Its Cocoa Malai, Rose Malai and Grape Crush are marvelous. I have deducted marks due to it's appearance and for being less spacious. But, again no complains with its looks as long as they keep serving us such wonderful sherbats and syrups :D.

SO, TO SUM UP -

FOOD QUALITY - 4.5/5 , QUANTITY - 3.5/5

Tip: If you feel thirsty and you are in College Street then forget those soft drinks and visit this place. I can assure you that PARAMOUNT will not let you down

I am going to paramount since my school days. the charge of the coco malai and general cream syrups were 25 and 10 respectively. but now a day a lot is changed, prices have gone up to 4 times. but i would say the sitting arrangement, taste still recalls the same feelings. obviously in between, the get up and everything has become more polished and commercial. earlier you could get sherbats without ice just by paying 2 rs. extra, but now you have to be lucky enough to get such wishes granted. everyday anytime (specially summer time) you visit there, will find it always crowded. it shows still how popular it is to us.

regarding sherbats, i have tried all of their preparations. by taste, there is hardly anyone to compare. still i will suggest coco malai, rose malai, cream orange and cream green mango. the malai items certainly will fill your stomach a lot. i cann't stop myself without having atleast 3-4 glasses of different tastes. even i can suggest that you can bring the syrups at home also.
so, as a whole i will highly recommend this to all the kolkatans as well as the visitors who are willing to learn about Kolkata...

This is not just a sherbat shop, this is a living memory. A memory of the old 'Calcutta', which was vibrant with intellectuality and wisdom. When you sit in those marble tables, order one of those delicacies ( my personal preference is cream rose, green mango and coco malai ) and check the list of people visited there, you must feel awesome! All those great people, they had visited there, may had sat in the same place where you are sitting today, enjoying the same sherbat that you have ordered! Now that's something you just can't find anywhere or buy with a lot of money. This is something that makes you visit this place, over and over again.
P.S. The Persian fruit is something ver unique, I think.

Paramount is a sherbet joint started in 1918. It is situated in college street area. It has an old ambiance with marble topped narrow tables and antelope horns. Daber sherbet is the best sherbet . There are various other flavours including tamarind.Take away facilities is also available. Costs of drink starts from Rs 40 onwards.

Well, I've been born and brought up in College Street. But I only started going to Paramount after I was in college. Before coming to the sherbats, let me first talk about the service. I LOVE the place because of the polite uncle running the shop. Everytime I go, he'll greet me with a smile. I usually tell him to give me something of his choice so he'd simply ask me "Shall I suggest you my favourite?" I just love the fact that being such a well known and busy joint, the owner still remembers his customers by face value.
Now coming to the sherbats. It would be unfair if I said any one sherbat was my favourite. Because trust me THEY ALL ARE AWESOME. I go to this place with my mom and everytime we end up ordering 4 different sherbats for the 2 of us. What to do? Too yummy to be missed. However the lychee and the strawberry malai are more dear to me. The daab sherbat, is a bit hyped. But pretty unique.
Overall, this para shop of beverage is an amzing evening mood lifter for me and my mum on a weekend. :)

This is exactly my kind of a place. Nothing fancy, just a very old place with a very North Calcuttan feel to it. Definitely not your typical coffee shop. We ordered the Coco malai which came at 80 bucks. The taste was simply heavenly. I have no other words to describe it. I am entirely willing to travel all the way from South Calcutta to College Street just for a taste of this. Can't wait to try all the other items on their menu. :)

This is for people who are thrilled by heritage more than comfort and glitz. This is a name which marks how much you are aware of old kolkata. Situated in a place where you have to know the place to find it. Almost always you'll have to look for a place in one of the benches which will remind you of you school days when you scrambled to over accommodate in the desired bench. There are pictures of famous people who visited the place. The place serves some amazing flavored sharbats with some underwhelming price tag. Whenever i visit i can't stop less than two or three varieties.  My favorites are the daab and malai sharbats.  Next time you are in he vicinity of college street make sure to find this unique place and have some amazing sharbats to quench your thirst.

Now this place is a legendary and one of its kind in the whole of Kolkata since historical period. I have seen people of aged as much as my grandfather and GenX kids praise it in the same way. They are very consistent and shall never let you down. 
When you enter you would come to know this place is standing there in pride since the inception of Kolkata, it has seen history being made. You will find paper cuts of reviews, a board shows who were the legendary visitors who stepped in here, and of course in another board you find the menu.
You would be offered a seat in their retro style wooden tables and chairs, and then you place the order, Grape Crush, Dub Sarbet, Green Mango, Tamarinds, Kesar Malai are the drinks I am a little biased towards, out of which Dub and Tamarind are my all time favourite. 
A glass of any of the drinks will leave you completely refreshed and ready to hop around the book stores again. 
I am seriously in love with this place. Good Bless them a 100 years of more life.

A little problem, they remain closed for around 3-4 months during the winter, considering that people are reluctant to have cold drinks at that period of time. I wonder !!!!

The best place to enjoy Sharbat... Feel like drinking all of them at one go.... Best one is the Daab Sharbat,  which is their speciality.... A glass of Sharbat after days work will make you feel refreshed.... The only problem with the shop is that due to the fact that it's situated in one of the most densely populated area, the shop is cramped....

Again an old hub of the city, located right at the centre, College Street. The moment you enter, you get the feel of those times, with the place having no modern day makeover. The sherbats are as good as you can get, especially the coconut one. A nice joint, and a excellent place to cool down with a cool drink, especially in the summer.!!

A cult in itself with recipies dating back to nineteen thirties. Paramount has been the soul of Kolkata for decades now. Immerse your taste buds onto the numerious traditional and innovative sharbats and mixes. With its preserved interiours the colonial marble tables Paramount stands tall in its former glory. Do try out the famous daber sorbot. Located in the heart of the college street boi para, this place is a must visit if you have a palate for sharbats and tradition.

Paramount is not just a name its unadulterated purity. Boi para, college square and paramount are shades of kolkata. Just behind college square situated is the age old favourite paramount. The small little sherbet bar has an old kolkata "bonedi" look with deer horn cuts outs. The menu that they serve is quite precise and exclusively experimental. My favourite being the daab sherbet. The coconut water mixed with sugar syrup, a thin film of coconut topped with crushed ice. The passion fruit sherbet is out of the world and is the best sherbet paramout can offer. And much in demand sherbet is the kesar malai sherbet. Tastes heavenly. For people who love milk with kesar, this is tgeir pick. Their latest new addition mango malai, is out of the world. For people who die for mango, i guess this is the only "har season mein aam ka mazaa lo" taste. It tastes excellent. The owner is extremely courteous to people. They quite appologise if they do not have something available. For people those who love mocktails please taste the "baap" of all mocktails.

If you have someone to take to College Street to buy that long lost book that you are hunting or taking a friend across the bylanes of colonial Calcutta you must drop in at Paramount. Thriving successfully even today as just a standalone Sharbet centre its must visit for College Street Boi Para.
What you will enjoy is the Green Mango Sharbat and the Daaber Sharbat . Those who have a taste for the rose syrup can also enjoy the Rose Syrup. Typically a Paramount Shake is made with your flavours  and served with wholesome curd. In summers you can also tuck into two shakes to yourself fill 
Location: Nestled Right opposite College Square in the bylane‚Ä¶  In case you miss it, you can ask for directions from the ever friendly Kolkata bystander and you will be guided. 
My visit to the College Street is never complete without dropping into Paramount once

I visited Paramount with a resident of college street. He took me to a place I had been hearing of for ages. To say it honestly, I was not really impressed. It is no CCD or Barista mind you. But I really enjoyed the fact that they were not trying to be CCD or Barista either. They are a  heritage place of Kolkata and they behave like it. Take it or leave it. I had their Daber Sherbet and it was quite good. The one without ice is actually costlier by a couple of rupees as you need more material in the sherbet :D :D Definitely worth a visit when in the college street area but not worth taking time off to go visit college street for paramount alone. Then again, you can always visit college street for the books and have a go at paramount as well.

Location: College Street.

"No visit to college street is complete without dropping by at Paramount."
-This was a statement given to me by my college mate and I completely agree to it!

I was introduced to this place by my college mate on our usual book-buying rounds.
This is a small joint serving great shakes!
Helped beat this scorching heat!!

Diving straight to the point,

- Dub Sherbat
It smells so heavenly and tastes the same as well.¬†
Legendary just like the place.
Highly recommended.

- Passion Fruits
Having a Rabri base makes u feel as if in a different world.
Simply outstanding!

- Cream Green Mango
Pure freshness!
Recommended.

- Strawberry Malai
Great to taste, but isn't something you should go for when there are better options available! :-P

- Pineapple Malai
Topped with Rabri and dry fruits, this drink wasn't that great as it lacked the taste of pineapple which one would expect from. 

- Rose Syrup
It was refreshing drink. One would think, it's a usual rooafza, but, I beg to differ. This one was much better than the usual one and had a hint of Rose water mixed along.
Recommended. 

Staff out here are courteous and the service is quick!

Pricing wasn't a pocket pinch.

Overall a great experience. :-)
Yet to try the remaining! A revisit on my cards.

A cool place to energise yourself. Cocoa Malai, Daab Sherbet, Grapes Crush...and the list goes on. Paramount serves the best cold coffee in the city. The lassi is equally refreshing. Only problem is the lack of Air Conditioner. It's always advisable to have the sherbets there, but the bottled syrups are difficult to prepare at home.

Visited numerous times. Some of my favorites are Dub Sarbat and Kesar Malai.

The only problem is at times you need to wait in a queue . Specially in puja time people usually stop by here while visiting the College square puja pandal. 

But the waiting time wont affect you as taste is really worth waiting.

Sure the set up of ordering seems a little weird when you're new, but it's so easy to overlook after the finest of melt-in-your-mouth goodness was placed before you. Whenever I visit this place I always try their 3-4 variety of shorbots, consuming one glass never satisfy my thirst. Today I ordered the ‚ÄòPassion Fruits (Rubri base)‚Äô, ‚ÄòDub Sarbat‚Äô, ‚ÄòSpecial Kesar Cream Lassi‚Äô and my friend ordered the ‚ÄòCocoa Malai‚Äô. We were in a heavenly extraordinary state of bliss!!! Truly a soulful symphony. Service was lightning fast.  Everyone was friendly and pricing was reasonable.  We will definitely be back.

96 years old now and they have maintained the quality well and so is the reputation of the place.

Though the syrups are moderate.The place is legendary,and continues to charm us as well! Now I know why my parents raved about it so much!!

This place doesn't need any introduction . It's LEGEND wait for it DARY .
It's the best 100 bucks i have  ever spent on refreshments - the prices may be high but they charge for consistency and quality .
In fact this place is not all about their amazing sherbets - it's about a tour of the old Calcutta - the lazy atmosphere the non-responsive and slow service - even time stops here . 
The seating is crammed and one ends up sitting with people you may never see again and all this adds to the flavor . 
 The presentation could be better but then again it would inflate their prices - so not much of a complaint . 
 The Daab Sherbet falls under the " Must Try " category .

Some things need no introduction, and this is certainly one such place. No visit to College Street is ever truly complete without a visit to good, old Paramount. While the daab - shorbot with its fragrance and delicate floating coconut kernel is an all-time favourite, the cocoa-malai is a close second. That is not to say that the others are any less. 
But yes, last week when I visited, there was a very weird stench invading the place. Certainly not something expected from a place of this stature. Of course I am not looking for room-fresheners here, but no matter how much i love this place, the smell was not welcoming at all and something that should be looked into.

Paramount..the name itself is a signature in bengali food n beverage industry. ....possesses a rich taste of bengal and praised by almost every eminent personality (Starting from freedom fighters to scientists, novelists/writers to directors/actors,sportsperso s n all)
Now, it comes to their spread...they have three types of variants in sherbets-
 1) Syrup based 
 2) Malai based
 3) Cream or curd based
In syrup ranges,I have tried their green mango and litchi, which I liked.
In malai based they have strawberry n coco malai..have tasted strawberry (am nt so very fond of coco or chocolate flavour) n it was heavenly.It is garnished with kaju n kishmish...:)
In curd based, have tried green mango, vanilla, pineapple n orange...they r delicious. 
But itz their signature sherbe twhich is my hot favourite-Daab sherbet..an awesome concoction with daaber sansh (the soft kernel of green coconut) & daaber jol...it is the showstopper.
All d sherbets r served with crushed ice, w/t ice, they charge 2 bucks extra for every glass.
Ambiance:-
This hadn't changed their original interior, still very much retained their old calcutta charm.A non ac joint, but the time their sherbets arrive, u'll forget all d heat!! A place where one can come with friends, family or all alone!!
The staffs are courteous n will help you gladly
If u r in a fix to choose one... 
They can accommodate arnd 25 people at a time, due to space crunch...so in puja times one has to wait long..so deducted 0.5 for that.
Overall rating :4.5/5
P.S.:one can takaway his /her fav sherbet, they have that facilty!!

I started visiting this place during my school days and It has the charm and freshness even today..My grandfather's favorite from his student's life and the best part is that even if you have problem with curd based sherbats on the menu just let them know they will suggest you we the best alternatives... All the sherbats on the menu are just excellent...!!

Now a days paramount is running because of their part earned goodwill. People have lots of money as well as time to waste just to taste it's heritage flavor would have rate it 5. The adequate valuation of it would be below 2.
Ordered dub serbat, and what i actually get is, a glass of water mixed with little amount of "golapjol" and a small piece of Coconut.
What a waste!! Will never suggest anyone to visit that so called serbat Specialists! :(

I remember visiting ths place with my parents since childhood.. And during my college days whenever I used to go to College Street with maa, we never failed to visit Paramount.. Now that I am a Calcutta University student, I go there with my friends often.. Thus, have been going there for a long long time..
 I wont say all the items are great but some of them tastes really awesome.. The dab sherbat, the coco malai, the kesar lassi etc..these are great..
The prices are very low n anybody can afford them.. The location is good as well and I guess all the Calcutta people have atleast once visited it.. ;-) 
Even if the quality deteriorates someday,  I would never write anythng bad about Paramount coz a lot of memories are attached to it.. :-)

This place has a lot of memories from my college days so whenever i am in College Street I always pay a vist. It is famous for its' Daab Sherbet and of course Cocoa Malai. I prefer the former where we scoop the malai of the coconut with the spoon. Prices have gone up but even then quite affordable. The interiors are clean with marble top tables and wooden chairs. The place is straight out from history as one will see the pictures of the famous patrons of the shops. It is usually quite full in the evening and one has to share the table or bench with strangers but that also gives them a chance to interact and relax. A must visit place.

Must visit place if you are planning to go to College Street. A great heritage is also associated with this place. If you are from Kolkata, you should have to visit this place at least once. Simply awesome place. Though the cost is a bit high but affordable. Per head, it will cost you around 100 Rs (for 2 sherbats). My personal favorite is Choco-Malai. Dab Sherbat is equally good.

Ambiance: 3.5/5

This is a rare gem stone in Kolkata's food-crown. A place not only carriers legacy but also maintains consistency. To me Paramount resembles to countless memories of visits to Clg Start. Name any of their sherbats - all are just awesome. Tried almost all varieties, my picks are - choco malai, green mango, n dab sherbat. So if u r thirsty its a must visit, n if u r not go n have a sip u wud have a chaska:)
P.S: 
1. Have a look on the visitors list - they are as famous as this place
2. Please visit "KALPATARU" - the famous pan shop - just few steps away

I have no clue how I could possibly miss reviewing Paramount.A visit to College street is simply incomplete without a visit here. 
This place offers absolutely certain rejuvenation and refreshment after a visit to the crowded College street area with its shakes and sherbats.All the sherbats on the menu are great and no less refreshing.Whether you would want a milk based one or a curd based one or a simple syrup depends on your personal preference and desire.No matter what you choose you will certainly not be disappointed.The milk based sherbats are my personal favourites.The Rose malai,pineapple malai,kesar malai are to name a few.The passion fruits,which is rabri based and the daab sherbat here are legendary.
The prices are reasonable.The staff are very polite and helpful.The service is quite fast too.The staff do a great job considering the small space and the generally crowded nature of the place.
This is one of the oldest places for food in Kolkata where all the Bengali legends of years gone by have paid a visit.This place has it all in terms of heritage culture and Bengali tradition.Along with all this,they have more or less maintained the quality.The only area where this place lacks a little is its ambience and decor and appearance,which I guess is kinda understandable.But I for one do not mind that too much.There is a certain charm about it all!
In short,if you have not visited this place yet,you just ought to do so.And like I said a visit to anywhere nearby is incomplete without a visit here more so in the summer months.

Being a medical student entails buying a lot of books in college street.Set amidst the bursting streets of college street,this is just the place to cool off after hectic walks and bargainings.The 'dab sherbet' and coco malai are excellent.Though the syrups are moderate.The place is legendary,and continues to charm us as well!

The very famous Paramount, something our parents rave about from their student days. Possibly it is their fault for setting such high expectations. Because in today's time walking into Paramount and drinking their Strawberry Malai is quite a mediocre experience. Its great, dont get me wrong, on a scorching afternoon, like a life saving potion. But is it something to go ga ga over? No. I personally hate their items containing banana. The safe ones are daab ( you might feel, why drink this and not coconut water from a roadside vendor), strawberry,kesar, grape crush and pineapple. The sitting area is very small as well. But the best part is its location, amidst the great College Street. And when you go there you can definitely stop by for the drinks!

And now as I happen to go to that locality for almost everyday ‚Ä¶.it has become a part of my routine.it is one of those places where you don‚Äôt care about the interiors or ambiance or the staff and service‚Ä¶all you want is that Dab sorbot or Coco malai sorbot in ur hands! They are their winners. Though of late an array of new drinks have been introduced. A must try for all the people going in and around college street .

I had heard so much about the place that I intended to pay a visit to the place when I visited college street after ages. With the temperature soaring over 40 degrees, the place was just irresistible. We decided to taste the much acclaimed "Dab Sharbat" and to be honest it superseded my expectations. The cocoa malai and the green mango with a thin layer of malai on the top wasn't too bad either and i thoroughly enjoyed all the drinks. The only part o regret is the feeling once u step out of the place again. Its like a heaven and hell difference in the true sense of the term.

I simply fail to understand why people make such a fuss about places like The Indian Coffee House and Paramount. I am well aware that these places once saw the rise of the much revered intellectuals of Bengal and that these places bear testimony to big names. However, that is not enough. To be thriving on the dying fame of past glory is just sad and that is what Paramount is. The beverages for which its so well known, did not seem to put up a very good show to me. I ordered a "Grapes Crush" while my friend ordered a "Cocoa Malai". My drink was too tangy and full of some silly syrup. My friend's drink was okay. In short, I have experienced whatever there was to experience, and am not going back there.

If you haven't been to this place, you don't know what you're missing. It may sound a bit lame to shell out bucks (though everything here is very cheap) just for shakes, but once you taste their stuff, it's just out of the world. You have to start your drink with a glass of the famous dab sherbet, which is a heavenly drink in itself, then you can move on to the banana malai, kesar malai, coco malai etc. They are delicately dressed with kheer and almonds, and also there are many curd based drinks (which I am to taste yet). However the newest additions, syrups, we never found much good. ¬†You can't simply go in paramount and get out after only one drink. Whenever we go there, 3-4 drinks are a must. And it is not at all heavy to the pockets. They can make the overpriced KFC krushers go out of business any day. Just ask anyone for the direction of paramount, and get ready to beat the scorching heat.

we ordered for dab sherbat.mango lassi.rose malai and choco malai trust me each one was awesomee..their dab sherbat is special in its own way with the coconut fillets..their lassi is unique and choco malai is of a superlative degree shake..if u havent tasted paramount's shakes then u r missing out a heritage thing of kolkata..
i am in love with this place..people serving are extremely cordial though one con is that the place is less spacious when many customers pour in it creates a mess..yet in this heat this is the best place with such great shakes and sherbats..kolkata's summer have to be  experienced by visiting paramount!!^_^

Was really lucky to visit this wonderful place. Wouldn't have known of this heritage had my friend not prompted me to visit this place. There was not much hustle around the place,only that the place was crowded. Patiently waited for my turn to get in and hurriedly ordered a curd based pineapple sherbet followed by another curd based Green Mango sherbet. The drinks were heavenly blissful, more so during the summer. Proud to have visited this place. A must visit for everyone in the City of Joy. ????

Almost a century old, still holding the flag of one of the must visit destinations of foodies in Kolkata and no competition. 
I hope the decoration of this place will remain same even after another century, because it is one of very few beverage shop where you can forget current date and imagine yourself having sip of "coco-malai" in the summer of 1961 or before than that, yes it is such a nostalgic place. Generation after generation have been visiting this place and quenching thirst with Dab-Sarbat, Keshar Malai, Passion fruits etc.
My favorite from the list is "Passion-fruit rubry base", the same taste and the flavor can not be found anywhere else. I think The malai items(Keshar, Banana, Rose,Strawberry etc.) and Dab-sarbats can be prepared in home but "Passion-fruit rubry base" does have special ingredients which give it distinct taste,texture and flavor. My instinct they use Bel-fruit in it. Do visit this place and give a try with "Passion-fruit rubry base".

Nothing much to say, this place ain't about pricey show offs and stuff. It's purely tasty indian drinks at its best. The oasis for Kolkata summers is right here.
PS. I visit this place quite often now and have become a sucker for their rather soothing dab sharbat and pineapple malai.

So my friend and I walked in and this place transformed me to a whole historical setting .. With all the pics and newspaper articles , the bench and low hanging fans. 
So we ordered the classic coconut n chocolate combo and also I had the mango sherbet. all I can say is if you think nothing can beat cocktails you really gotta try this place.

DECOR: Located in one of the lanes beside college square, it one of d most cramped places i have came across. The walls have cut out from newspapers confirming their legendary status.
AMBIENCE: Ppl often sit on u(literally), n gossip over glasses of sherbat. Ppl are warm n nice. It has a nice warmth n chard of its own.
FOOD: U don't get those cheap fancy wannabes, bt authentic, legendary sherbets. Passion fruit, choco malai, etc with cashew, almonds, kismis n kheer. Stuff of dreams.
Daab sherbet is a a must try as it has daab malai. Been there hundreds of times, still wana go there everyday if possible. :D
CONCLUSION: What to say, dream of evry foodie. A must try. Best sherbets in town! 

9th june 2015,
I feel very sad to share this but i must. This place is on a gradual decline and their service is getting poor. The people serving sherbats mix uo the orders almost everytime and one ends up waiting for a long time. They sometimes scream who ordered what. Not a great ambience. I guess the others went with time bt this place couldn't got stuck in time. Quality of sherbats are fine one day and pathetic the other. Lacks consistency. They must improve their services and consistency for the sake of their name at least..

this place has been serving the best sherbets for like decades now 
located behind college square the famous Paramount has a disappointingly small seating area 
they have clippings of their appraisal pasted in the front 
surely this place has been visited by many great names and has earned a reputation for itself 
the sherbets in fact  are truly deserving for the hype they get 
a bit overpriced yes! But the soothing drink with its awesome taste really makes up for the high price 
Their Best seller is the Coco malai .... yes the drink was really great 
the sweet chocolate milkshake with malai and nuts was really tasty only problem is it has a lot of ice 
and drinks without ice costs higher 
what i would like to mention is that besides the drinks which are obviously good i personally  found the pineapple malai drink to be the best one 
of course opinion might vary 
but guys u must surely give it a try 
i am so eager to try out the rest of the sherbets will be visiting you soon Paramount :D

It is a pity that it is so far away from my place, else I would have visited more often. Everyone has their own favourite or favourites. Mine are the dub sherbat, coco malai, cream rose and the green mango. Each and every time I am there I can feel myself being transported back to my childhood, the evening when my father took us all there. Man I became nostalgic again. Need to go again. SOON.

As far as my knowledge permits, this juice shop is probably the first of its kind in the city. It's also reached a level of fame that has made it a part of the culinary traditions of north kolkata.

Located on the road bordering the back side of college square ( if you consider the College street side as front ), it has a small seating area with bare ambience. The menu is limited with a clear division between the specialized drinks which are clearly overpriced and the ordinary drinks such as the rose, pineapple, grape, strawberry syrups.
I felt that the price is extremely unreasonable across the board. Having said that, the drinks are superb. We had the Dub Sherbat which is one of their more famous items. Its a tall glass of coconut milk mixed with a generous proportion of the kernel and ice blocks. The taste is one of unadulterated purity. I suspect that they also add a carefully balanced sweet solution but that's a trade secret. :)

Chakraborty Tip : I'm not a particular fan of the many specialised juice and mocktail bars in the city, primarily because they are not standalone establishments. It's extremely awkward to enter a 4 star hotel in order to grab a glass of sherbet. In that regard, this place is a must try.

Easily on the "do not miss" list of places to eat/drink in Calcutta. This tiny, freshly painted and immaculately maintained place serves some of the most interest drinks in town.

You can start with the Dab (coconut) sherbet (Rs 40, Jan 2014) or get right to it with the Choco Malai (Rs 80) which is this delicious chocolately concoction topped with fresh malai (cream) and dry fruits. Or you could go with the slightly intoxicating Grape Crush. 

You sit on long benches and all sherbets are served in tall glasses with spoons so you can cull out the pieces of coconut meat (in the Dab Sherbet) or the malai (in the choco malai) or the grapes (Grape crush). If you are lucky, you can meet the owner and hear stories of how this place used to be a meeting hole for the revolutionaries in the Independence movement.

Delightful place.

Writing about this place is like a Nostalgia for me... My Presidency days and our little sneak out from college class timings...

Paramount has been synonymous to a rich legacy itself. The sherbets here, are a cult and has been delivering quality for decades now. From celebrities to commoners, Calcuttans have sweared by Paramount. The curd based drink is like heavens from the unbearable heat of the city. Found in various flavors, ranging from Rose to Mango, from Banana to Kesar; these sherbets have never failed to delight us with their taste and aroma.

My personal fav are the Dab Malai (Coconut) which they serve with pieces of semi-formed coconut chunks. The Coco Malai is one more hot fav, where they blend the distinctive tastes of coco and cream together. the space is less and it is not air-conditioned, but these factors don't stand a chance against their offering. Superlatively reasonable prices make it a attraction itself. 

So on a whole, its a small trip to heaven itself.

You can even fly down from a different city for this :P

Those who are really dying of having good juice and drinks,
and if you like to to melt your tongue with good taste ..
then this is the place you are looking for. . . .

I'm sure guys, that you'll love the fruit drinks in spite of foods ..

please don't expect like CCD or any Juice parlor type environment, this is an very old and traditional place..
serving very good quality and original fruit juice more than over 50 years...
they use old type of wooden chair-tables,
but you'll never get any negotiation with taste ...

They use original fruits in juices . .
Each and every drinks are good, but I specially like the "Dub Sarbat" the most. . .
Coconut(Dub) water with pulp has its amazing uniqueness ...
mmmmmmm .....

This place is one of the Heritage places and I would visit simply for the fact that brilliant minds have frequented this place and I love the sense of history one feels from the minute one steps in here. Greats like Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose to Amartya Sen to Arundhati Roy have patronized this establishment which is almost a hundred years old. Must try flavor is Green Mango and Dab Sherbet which are very popular and their bestsellers.

Heavenly sarbats. Every flavour is a delight. Dab sarbaat and Rabri sarbats are the list toppers. No wonder why it is ruling since 1940.

When it comes to food I am serious, and when it comes to drinks I am super serious. And I might just trade a glass of Pinot Noir for a glass of Paramount's daab sharbat. 

Did you know that the shop is 97 years old, and thr recipe of daab sherbet is the only one not maee by the original owner, the grandfather of the current owner, or that the table tops, exept for one, arr imported italian marbles, as old as the shop? A must visit for a first tine visitor to Kolkata.

The search for Paramount started right here from Pune before flying to Kolkata. I just knew it was somewhere near college street. I had two targets in college street to satisfy my tatste buds and this was a great experience. Paramount lies a bit inside from the crowded college street area. When i stepped in, I could see a board attached to the wall where it shows great personalities who been visited this place for their unique sherbats. But, I say, everyone who gets into this place will become such great ones. I have also heard that they keep the recipe of their sherbat as a secret and they even are particular in hiring people here. The place is small and they have different kinds of sherbats. The one I tried was tender coconut sherbat, which was insanely awesome. 

This place is highly recommended if you are in Kolkata. If you dont know where it is, its worth finding it.

A  must  visit  whenever  I go  to   College  Street, a  summer  day with   troublesome  humidity  seems   much  bearable  with  the   delicious concoctions  they  offer , the   quality  and   quantity is usually  top  class.  Be  it the Dab Sharbat , Cold  coffee, Lassi  ,  Rose  Malai or Green  Mango,  Paramount serves    the  best   and  that  too  at  affordable  rates  .  The small place  with  humble  looks   is  famous   for  its  legacy   and  usually   takes  some   time  to  get   seats  ,  however its  always  worth  the  wait!  Pandal  hopping  during  Durga  Puja  is  never  complete  without   a visit  to  Paramount ! :)

Being in Kolkata and missing Paramount means you are missing a slice of history of kolkata!! I have been to this place a number of times in college and school days.. and have been dearly missing the visits after being deployed to the rough and rude IT sector!! So just converted a 50-50 chance of being here to a 100% and landed up to this place in a November Saturday afternoon!!

Took a stroll in college streets.. took the smell of books.. smell of old days.. and entered Paramount.. the same unimpressive looks.. and I am happy that it did not get renovated in these couple of years!! Somehow I feel this old building charm adds to the 'juicy' experience here!!

I actually wanted to re-taste every single item on the menu.. but we three finally settled for one Coco-Malai, one Pineapple Malai and one Rose Malai.. Just forgot to mention not to put ice and that took away 0.5 points! The sherbets arrived in 5mins... Long glasses.. chocolaty, orangy and rosy.. top-filled with nuts and malai.. both spoon and straw provided to savour this specialty!! We jumped on the glasses with spoon... soft and smooth layer of kheer and generous amount of cashewnut, almonds and raisin filled in our mouth... as well as our senses.. The richness of the shake was somehow getting obstructed by the amount of ice put, but nevertheless the shake was as heavenly as it was 2-3years back.. 

It took us 5-6mins to finish our glasses... I was yet to taste the another favorite from this place.. Dab-malai.. but I was reminded about the lunch and had to leave that for my next visit!!

Been here like zillion times with friends. Whenever we are in College Street or even Coffee House, we NEVER forget to visit paramount. This is like VERY famous in that area. And it serves the best sherbets ever! 
Paramount is an extremely renowned shop in College Street which is mostly visited by college goers.
Its a shop that offers sherbets and coolers. Very mediocre in ambience and infrastructure BUT looks are deceptive.
Do not go by the looks of this shop for the sherbets are just to gorge on!
My recommendation : Raw Mango sherbet

Its fabulous anyday and also helps to beat the heat!
All hail Paramount. This shop can NEVER get old.
And pocket pinch ? 100 for two! :'D

Lucid isnt it ?

Cheers.

It's a place that defines Kolkata. It's got a heritage atmosphere to it, not to mention its right in central Kolkata. The juices and shakes are simply enjoyable and wl make you want to come back again & again. The green mango malai has always been my favorite. The dab sharbat, choco shake, are also nyc. It's a must visit. A must in summer

The name "paramount" fits perfectly to this heritage place of Kolkata. The Daab Sherbat, Choco Malai and Kesar Malai are some of my favourites over here. The ambiance might be a turn off but once you get the first sip of their sherbats and malai, I bet you would want to order another glass and want to come back as soon as possible. Whenever I visit college street with my friends, I make sure to visit Paramount. Going over there in a hot afternoon is a bliss. The malai based sherbats taste so heavenly, rich with cashews and a layer of malai on the top. It is a must visit place for every Calcuttan.

I didn't like it initially.The crowded arrangement.Almost zero privacy.Plus,I thought I didn't wanna spend 60 bucks on some juice!! Enter Passion Fruit juice.Everything else was just a blur.All I could hear was the sweet,fruity flavour of the Passion Fruit coursing down my throat and ready to be etched in my memory forever.I don't mind shelling out 100 bucks for this baby.The Litchi syrup is also a must-try as it's natural.Totally.I haven't had anything so pure in a long while.Another must try is the Rose syrup and Kesar Malai.The only thing which earns a thumbs down,at least from me and everyone having tonsilitis,is too much ice cubes.Whether crushed or whole,sometimes it just numbs my mouth to the point I can't taste anything after that!I found out later on,that they do make drinks without ice,on request, but they charge a token amount for that.The place reeks of heritage and what's more,there's a list of the Who's Who painted that had visited this small place since its inception,so you could feel privileged.

I don't know how many times a month my best friend and myself visit this place. The owner and his daughter always tell us that we have got addicted to sharbats. I consider this place to be the third home of mine, after my own home and CCD Lake Town. The coco malai, daab sharbat and rose syrup are my favorite and are the compulsory ones for each visit.
I never get bored with this place, rather a gap of more than 5 or 6 days of not going there frustrates me like anything.
No air condition, no cushioned sofas, no decorative sharbat glasses, no suited and booted waiters, but a lot of cordiality is all that you can get in this place.
This is a place which my grandfather visited very often. This is a place where my father dropped in now and then. And this is the place where love to be always.
This place is beyond any comparison with anything. This is one of those places where you get the feel of kolkata. So, it gets a most deserved 5/5 rating from me.

Paramount adds just one more to the heritage of Kolkata. Situated at college street with other heritages of this city this place from 1918 has been visited by legends like Netaji and other renowned people, men of high caliber. The staffs and the manager are quite courteous and would always love to address the queries kindheartedly. Though you would not find a good ambiance but you would definitely get the feel of rich cultured Bengal. Their sherbets are a joy to have and you generally would get a crowd of college and school going people. The mixed fruit one though costs you a hundred bucks but it is made of rabri. Their syrups are just a bliss on one tiresome day. Dab Sherbat as it is called is the most unique thing available and probably the only place which serves such. Coconut layer dumped in coconut water and served. What a feel...!!!! All hail paramount...way to go.

I don't understand why they have the term juices, they make serbat and shakes, but i have never seen or drunk any juices there, neither I think they have one in their menu, only dab serbat is from coconut juice, but, they still mix rose water and other ingredients in it ( believe it? The recipe is from Acharya Prafulla Chandra Roy, amazing). What should I name of my favourite? Coco malai, pineapple, dab serbat, grapes crush, the very best green mango, and recently introduced tamarind. Sorry sirs, Passionfruit is not at per for the standard of your bar, this is a place of long long heritage and they make and break their own standard. Just don't try to compare them with anybody in the world. There are the places where you come to share original authentic and hall of the fame food and drink. I only can say, if you are a so called newcomer in college street, start your day with dalpuri and rajbhog from putiram, have grren mango from them, go and finish up your work. Have a pre lunch inside college square with ghugni, stew and pauruti. Have a grape crush and/or pineapple in there again, do some more work, have one of the best bengali authentic lunch with "macher matha diey pui shak, different fishes and oily, rich, yet so palatable pathar jhol with a big piece of alu (which will definitely make you forget about oh calcutta, 6 ballygunge place, kasturi, charnocks, bhajahari manna and all other so called big shots, and make you understand what real bengali cuisine is like) beside university hostel and opposite the mortuary, make your lunch digested by coming back to them and having a glass of dab serbet and "ek khili pan" from kalpataru. Finish up your work again and in between if you feel hot and thirsty, have a glass of "tetuler serber" and then a glass of coco malai as heavy snack. Finally finish up your day with bhetkir chop and mochar chop from "Kalika" and final glass of serbat from them, this time try lichhi, lemon or orange. Oh guys, One can die for it, when I go out of Kolkata for long, believe me, I simply miss these. No adjective is sufficient to describe the quality of any of the above, specially Paramount. Just try and be amazed. One of the best reason to stay in Kolkata.

Paramount, situated in College Street behind a narrow alley welcomes you with old Kolkata wooden benches and tables. The speciality you get is "Sharbet" be it any kind of starting from simple coconut water to varieties like syrups and lassis. This place is specially crowded during the summer season and also at the Durga Puja time. Now a adays, I am not that often to College Street, but I do make it a point to visit Paramount to have the cool daab sharbet every time.

There is a saying that if you happen to be in & around College Street / College Square and you haven't been to the Coffee House or at The Paramount Juice Centre , well then you probably belong to the unlucky few who missed a date with history of Kolkata! This is small outlet , very unimpressive though, but famous for its long list of eminent clients which includes legendaries like Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee , Bankim Chandra Chattopadhya , Satyajit Ray , eminent sportsmen . literateurs, cine stars & politicains including Ministers , Governors &  Judges , who have thronged this place for a glass full of magic in the form of Sherbets , Ghol & Juices which is very unique as well as mind boggling!The walls of the outlet takes  pride in  donning the cut-outs from newspaper clippings with rich reviews given by the greats of yester-years , reflecting its wonderful & glorious past!
I happened to visit this place way back one summer  in the late 70's accompanied by one of my school friend who had in fact insisted that we should drop in for a refreshing drink but would not tell me where! I had become restless as the scorching sun was taking a toll on my patience & just when I wasn't able to take it any more .........Lo here we were.....a small unimpressive & shabby looking place , till my eyes caught upon the clippings on the wall!
I swear in the name of the Lord that the Kacha Aamer Sherbet tasted like Ambrosia to me! I mean after the walk down the lane in the scorching sun there was nothing else that could have given you a feeling of utter satisfaction and the kind of pleasure which I derived   &  I could not help but ask for a second helping & thanked my dear  friend for having brought me  to a place which had a piece of history  attached to it!

P.S: I suggest if you do happen to in or around central kolkata / college street , please try it out for yourself &  then kindly revert to me regarding  your experience!Believe me , no one can match them, even though there are many reputed Juice houses in Kolkata, like the  Rallis etc of great importance but not as much as that of Paramount importance.!

After that day I have been there on umpteen occasions , with friends & office blokes & each time it has been an awesome experience!

From my college, Presidency University, Paramount is just a stone's throw away. Even though I've been going there for nearly a month now (I'm a Biological Sciences Major, 1st semester), I went to paramount only yesterday with a college friend who also happens to be a vociferous champion of Paramount. Given the utter negligence shown by popular hangout places like Cafe Coffee Day, KFC, McDonald's towards North Calcutta, me and my friends are now solely dependent on snooping out and experiencing less-heard-of eateries in and around College Street on a more-or-less regular basis. 
Thanks to zomato I had formulated a general conception of Paramount. So I had the quintessential Dub Sharbat. While waiting for our order, we enjoyed an invigorating conversation, free of any kind of interruptions. The parlour is small but is cozy rather that dingy. The interiors were a cool respite from the sweltering heat outside. From where we were sitting we could see a huge pile of dubs or raw coconut. We were thrilled to see the sharbat itelf. Arriving in a tall glass tumber, we could see for ourselves that the smoothie was wholly organic as it was really the colour of dub-water. Besides the straw for drinking, there was a spoon too for scooping out the generous portions of delicious nebulous dub-flesh. The cool effect of broken ice was accentuated by the marble-topped table. It was so refreshing that I'm still swooning from the delectable coolness. Forty rupees seems quite reasonable for this fantastic drink. I am proud to be the latest inductee of the Paramount Fan Club

North Kolkata has always been home to some of the most legendary places in the city. May it be the CU, Thanthania Kalibari, The Marble palace.... or the eateries.

When you come to the College Street area on a hot afternoon, u are bound to get thristy. But guess what, you are in luck!. Just hop in the Paramount Juice store just by the Pool side near the sanskrit collegiate. There are two things which make it better than all the Juice centres in the city:
1. Wide variety of Juices to choose from, some conventional, some not!
2. The taste is consitently great for all the flavours.

My personal favourite has been the Rose milk, very basic but amazingly delicious juice. Well the delicious word doesn't goes well with Juices, but after trying one of them from here u cant resist using it.


The low factor is that the space is very small and in rush u might need to hurry up for other people. But for foodies, who cares the space. There are no disputes of this being compared to any other Juice centre of the city, because this is the best of all. If you are in Kolkata, this place holds a tradition and a flagship of the signature Juices and flavours nature has allowed us to recognize. So please visit and it is gauranteed, you will come again and again!!! Happy Sipping!

Although my college was not situated nearby, any visit to Calcutta University would be incomplete without a visit to this legendary place. Especially on a hot summer day, this place is simply heavenly ! Yes, the place lacks space....and I generally have to hurry up a bit as other people are always waiting for their turn, but it honestly gives this place a very homely vibe...And I like the old world charm ! My friends and I have tried almost all the curd based sherbets....Banana (a bit too sweet), Pineapple (I like !), Vanilla, Orange etc. And while the Daab Sherbet is a clear favorite among most people, I personally love the Cream Green Mango sherbet....In fact I haven't tried many of the other drinks as i always look through the entire menu but end up ordering this one ! 
If you haven't been here already, you really should !

To visit College Street and to not visit Coffee House and Paramount is a sacrilege in itself. So, on a Saturday afternoon quite a few years back me and my friends decided to visit this legendary place in College Street, Kolkata. You might be put off by the space crunch but trust me, this is THE place to have varieties of sherbets and malai in Kolkata. The Rabri base passion fruit juice is unparalleled and the lip smacking malai in different flavors will leave you wanting for for more in spite of your tummy being full. You might not enjoy the ambiance because of the school-like benches and strips of marble top tables, but this is vintage North Kolkata at its very best. Visit it at least once, try the coco malai or the daab sherbet and am sure you will be itching to go back again and again.

A small sharbat parlour since 1918, with its original tables and chairs, it offers some delicious sherbats. I had two daaber sharbat (raw coconut) with ice and the cream of the daab, with a bit of sugar.  The owner is second generation and the next generation is there too. Started in the 1918 by his grandfather father, who came from east Bengal, the heavy weights of the 1930s and even those of the present day, patronised the Paramount. Its original name was Paradise, but his father renamed it. 

Its bustling with energy, a high turnover, very appropriate for all ages, and a welcome change form the heat of the outdoors.  A must visit.

This is certainly not the best place for any sherbet of any kind. The price of the items might be reasonable but considering the taste its no good. It might come helpful during the pujas after battling the crowd of college square but in any other day i wont even think of going to that place.

Oh Paramount.. Even writing about you makes me thirsty! :( 

I really don't remember how many times I've been here, but enough to know quite a few facts about this place.. An important part of the history of this city, this place had once catered to the beautiful minds of our country.. From Rabindranath Tagore to Prafulla Chandra Roy, Narayan Gangopadhyay to Banaful, C V Raman to Amartya Sen, they've all been here.. Such a legacy, that it's been declared as 'Heritage Property' by Calcutta Municipal Corporation..

Bored? My apologies.. I'll quickly tell you why their Sherbets, not old glory, is the reason they are the best in Kolkata.. 

This place doesn't look anything out of ordinary.. But it does give you a homely vibe, a place where you can sit n relax, n feel comfortable enough.. The owner, Mr. Mazumder, personally comes and asks you what you want, n gives you some excellent suggestions too, if he thinks fit.. Definitely adds a personal touch to your whole experience..

Sherbets.. Where do I start? They have simple Syrups, Cream based and Curd based.. Try anything, anything you wish.. Their most famous is Dub Sherbet though.. Made of coconut water, they leave a  thick pulp on the top.. Oh my! It's refreshing, and wonderfully tasty.. Do make sure not to miss it if you're there..

I love their rose malai and coco malai too, but my personal favorite would be Grapes Crush.. I was really skeptical about trying it for the first time, but mr. Mazumder said they make it with a special grape syrup, which takes nearly 3-4 days for the fermentation.. And it was really a wonderful drink.. It has a rich, very rich texture, n it tastes beautiful.. Try it, n you'll know why it's one of the best sherbet place in Kolkata..

Do make it a point to visit this place.. You'll love this old charmer! :)

Surprisingly i had my college in College Street never visited this place.. Neither did i take interest whatsoever..
Came here for the very first time last week after a friend of mine literally mocked me..Once you look at the place..you might not quite like it..maybe because of the dingy,congested seating arrangements here..Nevertheless i made up my mind and we both got to sit over here after waiting for 10 minutes.. These people hardly have a grand menu as such..1 page leaflet which has juice, lassi etc mentioned in different flavors..

We chose 1 "Passion Fruits-Rabri Base" and then "Special Kesar Lassi-Curd Base" ..Both just tasted heavenly..It was so yum.. we ended up ordering Rabri Base twice..:P Given the fact we both were gluttons, we were really happy to have come here.. The Rabri and the juice with Dry fruits was so yum...even thinking about it now brings water to my mouth...

The best part is the place is run by a Bengali Family for generations, on the wall we saw some of the most notable people were once customers to this place..

While leaving, one from the family said  goodbye in a traditional way "Abar Ashben" which is something i have never heard in any of the so called "eating joints" across the city till date.. I would definitely recommend everyone to come to this place...

An assembly of the best sherbet on the whole bloody third rock from the sun.... The BEST ever. These guys know the art of creating masterpieces for the thirst-sensors. Green Mango, Litchi, Coconut... the list goes on. And don't miss the takeaway bottles for royally treating your taste buds back at home.

This place is up for almost a century now, and I don't see any reason for them to abort. In fact, this is my 'must visit' venue whenever I'm in or around College Street.

Couple of downsides (the reason I've deducted 0.5 from a perfect five in my rating): 
1. Dine-in space is limited.
2. They do not accept cards!!!

Paramount- A name that is synonymous with great sherbets and a name that has hosted some of the greatest persons to be born in Bengal. After a tiresome journey or a hectic day or just like that on a summer noon, the sherbets of this place have the capacity to cool and pacify even the most hot headed person on earth. I honestly feel they should start serving sherbets at Indian parliaments to help stop the altercations among matured people. Jokes apart, this place is the best if you want to have good quality sherbets at a very moderate price. I am not aware of any other place in Kolkata serving better sherbets at a price range even remotely close to Paramount's.

Located in college street, this very small establishment is famous among college students, primarily because college street is the place where we head for books at discounted prices. Even then I would suggest everyone who has a taste for sherbets to visit this place for some pleasant and cool stuffs.

Coming to the ambiance. Its simply not good. Paramount is a shop serving their great preparations in a hilariously small room which at times becomes very congested. The table tops are made of marble, and they have benches, like we used to have in school, instead of proper chairs. Certain things in the shop are bound to attract your eyes. One is a list of famous people who have been to this place and the other is a head of a deer which was told to me to be real. Being an establishment of nearly a century this place has hosted freedom fighters like Netaji to celebrities like Uttam Kumar. It also boasts several newspaper articles that have been put on the wall to make new customers showcase its prestige. The sherbets are served in those standard tall glasses used by hawkers on a roadside. But the service is quiet fast. The person,who seems to be the owner is very prompt in his actions and most of the times the sherbets are served by him. The kitchen is at the rear end of the shop, hidden from the customer's view just by means of a curtain. So nothing appealing about the ambiance.

What makes paramount a place worth visiting are their brilliantly prepared sherbets and their heritage status. Most of the standard sherbets, priced at 30 rupees are curd based. They come in various flavors like rose, green mango, pineapple, banana and others. The curd base is the cardinal difference between this place and others that are similar. I, being a regular to this place have tasted most of their sherbets and each one of them proved to be awesome. Not very sweet, nor very mild, the sherbets bear the stamp of originality. They also have a topping of malai on every glass of their sherbets. If you want something uniquely different then go for their coco- malai or the dab sherbet. The dab sherbet is indeed a treat and is sure to impress everyone. It is a sherbet made with coconut water that is refreshing in its taste. Most people avoid the banana sherbet and I used to fall in the same category. But once a person in the shop recommended it to me. I was told that the banana syrup is the costliest and the best in taste and truly it turned out to be the best among the ones priced at 30 bucks. However I tend not to stop at just one glass, every time I visit this place and end up ordering at least two different flavors. I would recommend this place to every one. The old school sherbets of this place can never be substituted by any cold drinks. 

As I end my review with a 4.5/5 for this place I would request everyone to indulge yourselves in the classy taste of Paramount's sherbet and witness the fact "OLD IS GOLD".

Paramount is located behind college square.It is famous for daab sharbat which is just out of the world. All varities of sharbats are good at this place but my personal favourites are Daab Sharbat and Cocoa Malai which are strongly recommended. The space is a bit cramped.

Prices:
Daab Sharbat - Rs 40
Cocoa Malai - Rs 60

There is also option to parcel the sharbats and take home. They provide bottles for Rs 20 for carrying the sherbet home with you.

After roaming about for hours in College Street, buying books, we four (very tired souls)
unanimously decided that we had to end our hectic day with something cool and soothing from Paramount. It is located opposite to the College Square Swimming Club.
We were warmly greeted by a friendly and elderly person, whose ancestors had served great personalities like Rabindranath Tagore, Satyajit Ray, Uttam Kumar and so many others. He arrived at our table and gave us some helpful suggestions about choosing our drink. Keeping his suggestions in mind, a glass of cocoa malai, daab sherbet, crushed grapes and litchi syrup was ordered. Thanks to the prompt service, our drinks arrived in 5 minutes. All the concoctions (garnished with a layer of crushed ice) are so unique and awesome in their own way, it is hard to choose one over the other. If you want something light and subtle, then go for the daab sherbet which is made with coconut water topped with coconut malai. The cocoa malai is a milk based drink with clotted cream, chocolate, crushed nuts and raisins. The litchi drink is very fresh and full of flavour. The most interesting drink is the crushed grapes which is slightly wine flavoured. This red coloured drink is the healthiest one in the list, which also acts as an Ayurvedic medicine.
I must say, along with our fulfilling glass of sherbets we got to know a lot about this
historically significant, pleasant little parlour set up in 1918. It felt great, knowing that the
idea of daab sherbet had first originated from the great Acharya Prafulla Chandra Roy's
mind.
If there is anyone who has not yet stepped into this place even for once, please make it a
point to visit this sherbet lover's paradise. The malai and daab sherbet are the most
renowned ones, but you can have anything and you won't be disappointed. Apart from the above ones, I would recommend the kesar and vanilla malai sherbet and green mango syrup.
While leaving, we (four satisfied and happy souls) got to know that this place will celebrate it's 100th anniversary after 5 years. Goes without saying, we would love to be there again and again!
P.S : Check out their menu card! :)

It almost started 25 years back since I was taken to Paramount by my Father... and since then  it became a place of indulgence when it cames to satifying my tastebud liquid style... 

Well the place holds the same charm as far as I can recall and yes the taste hasnt changed at all .... 
The plain vanila Sorbet which they have , Daaber Jol, Shaasnsh and The syrup... it stays on your tounge for ever and then comes the new entree into the menu ranging from anything that you can image which can be tasty... 

If you are in Calcutta.... this is not a place to be missed. This is a place where I visit everytime I have the chance to visit Cal and would love keeping this habit forever.....

A must go place if you are in Kolkata, with the whole area in which it exists. I am partial about the whole package as it reminds me of the golden days of my college.
I remember going there with my friends in a hot afternoon. A small typically North Calcuttan place. Its naturally air conditioned with its high ceiling and fat walls. They serve you with sherbets and nothing else. But in hot humid afternoon, what else do you want?
If you are there for the first time get the Dab Sherbet. They make it using real green coconut water mixed with a little syrup, but the best part is they add to this a slice of soft coconut which you would have to spoon up. The whole thing is out of the world.
If you want something else to try, try their shakes. They are great too.
I remember we all had two tall glasses of sherbet each and things didn't end too well :D

A restaurant of paramount importance in College Street
3 out of 5

Situated amidst the busy area of College Street, Paramount is one of the popular destinations in the city that has retained its heritage, culture and standard since it opened in 1918.
Nowadays, I have heard a lot of criticism about this place from many people, but my honest advice is - don't judge this place by its appearance while comparing this place with other juice and syrup parlours that have cropped up in the city in recent years. Just go in and try to feel the heritage and value of this place before you draw any conclusions. 

The ambience is really very ordinary and unappealing as are the waiters. But they are very humble and polite and serve every customer in a homely fashion (without any exaggeration). Their menu only includes a variety of syrups, juices and shakes, and there's nothing more blissful than a glass of cold and refreshing drink on a hot summer day. Among their various juices, I personally prefer their Kacha Aamer Sarbot and Daaber Sarbot. But for a change, I always love to try their Rose Syrup and Mango Shake. Other fruity ones are also very nice but as I am not very fond of fruity flavors, I generally prefer to stick to these. Another item which is really mentioned worthy is their lassi (really a refreshing option for hot summer days!). 

This small family run business can easily go in for some modernization by including some more snacks or baked goods, but what I like the most is that they prefer to retain that traditional pride in their way of doing business rather than chasing modernization like other establishments. Probably this unique feature still gives this 'paramount' syrup parlour a number one ranking. Moreover, this place charges very reasonably for their beverages which are prepared and served with a lot of love and care.

The rating would have been full on had the space not been so crammed. But unarguably the best place for juices and cold beverages and the best pricing too. My parents used to date here as students and their nostalgia made me and my brother start visiting this joint at a very young age.

The place that serves the best drinks in town. Period. Has been in the intellectual hub of kolkata for ages, and  used to attract the who's who of Kolkata. A basic but very clean place, it has a simple menu. And one can never go wrong here. The drinks as tasty and refreshing and nothing like anything you have tasted before. One can go for the fruity shakes,my personal favorite green mango and pineapple. Or the speciality daab(green coconut) sherbet. It is creamy n has pieces of very tender coconut on top which simply melts away in the mouth. The owners are really nice, and they will certainly remember you if you are regular,even if that means visiting it 2-3 times in a year.Overall a must visit for anyone looking for a refreshing drink or to discover one the heritage eating places of kolkata

I wouldn't be exaggerating when I say this is the best place in town for juices and a quick drink. A small cramped space but they serve the best of drinks. The Cocoa Malai, Dub Sherbet and the Grapes Crush are amazing. And decently priced too. Paramount deserves a lot more fame and recognition. Amazing place. Recommended anyday anytime.

THE place to go if you are tired after a day of book hunting in College Street! Best enjoyed if yoy have just bought a Friedrick Forsyth for 30 bucks from a 2nd hand shop and have the 70 bucks change left with you!
Although people go gaga over the Coco Malai here but i believe The Dab Sherbet is their best offering!
The owners and the people serving are polite and helpful and that perhaps adds a bit more sweetness to their fare..
Cheers...

Being a student of Medical College, Paramount has, from my very first year of college, been a favorite of mine as far as the world of colourful fluid consumption is concerned.  Yes, it's part of Kolkata's heritage. ...but all the culture aside,  for me, this place is a must-visit because it truly does have the city's best in juices to offer. All of it at very affordable prices too. The place is sort of small in itself,  but the owners and waiters are very polite. So get down there one of these summer days and try the cocoa malai or green mango.....and join the long list of Paramount lovers.

Old is Gold.. that is what i will call Paramount.. u will often hear about paramount from your grandparents who spent their college days in coffee house and paramount and putiram .. i happened to go there once with my friend about 15 years back and i still cannot forget their green mango and coco malai sharbat. recently city centre hosted this food festival of good old cuisine where i was delighted to see paramount and headed straight to it. i ordered a coco malai and i am not exaggerating the taste remains the same after so many years.. 
the place is ordinary i guess that is the charm of the place.. now a days we do get mocktails everywhere but none compared to the sharbat and juice that paramout serves u.. it is the best..

the proprietors are very passionate about the trade which has been running for ages in their family. the quality is controlled as they source most of the primary ingredients from their own garden produce.
though the property is very basic its a must visit place for any one who loves a cool drink to hang out with.

You can get one of the best juices here at reasonable prices. Ambience is very ordinary and waiters are polite too..this outlet is located at College Street. In this intolerable heat one glass of juice is very refreshing. I love their green mango shake and plain mango shake. The Grape Crusher is also well prepared here. They also prepare awesome and luscious lassis.
I love this place. I would rate 4 for paramount Juices and Shakes.

Dropped in at the heritage place to quench my long thirst with the famous sarbats that they serve. Simply felt "aaahhhhh" after taking the first sip.Tried the malai based rose flavour, lichi drink & their traditional & patented DAB Sarbat. Simply awesome. Was also delighted after speaking with the owner of that place. An aged gentleman wearing a kurta- pajama & helping out the service staffs to serve & take orders. A sober gentleman to talk to.

In brief to describe this place I would say 'Fatafati Boss'..........simply awesome. This one is located opposite college square. Thank God finally before dying my friend took me here or else I would have missed something very precious. The prices are very low which gives you the green signal to have what ever you want. As the name suggests the juices and shakes are very well done and you are going to love it. The food is nice too though take note its 100% vegetarian. 
The only reason why I did not give it 5 is because I feel the ambience can improve immensely but the prices are low too which you should also remember. Overall lovely experience and I am really looking forward to come back here very soon.

Paramount is not just a place. Its a part of a long-standing heritage that goes back  a long way. It reminds me of my college days and the endless glasses of drinks we would sit here and consume and discuss anything and everything - from fried chicken to Foucault, so as to say. 

I recently went there with a friend to discuss some politics over a glass of something cold. The day was hot, and I instantly ran for the green mango, my favorite. I do not know how they do it, but they actually have kept the taste THE SAME from my childhood, a fact I Absolutely Adore. And the service is brisk, fast-paced, and they do not mind it if you spend a lot of time sitting there with a glass of whatever you have in your hand. 

Although people swear by the daaber sharbat and cocoa malai, I swear by the green mango and the rose. 

Do check out Paramount if you are a nonalcoholic drink lover.

A part of Calcutta's heritage this Sherbet center ( I prefer using the term sherbet because they do not serve fresh fruit juices but drinks made from fruits etc) is even more special due to its special location at 'boi-para' (the neighbourhood of books) Long before Flipkart and Uread.Com had even been invented book-lovers would throng the streets of College Street for books on any subject under the sun. Students would get a good bargain on their favourite novels and books of interest. Even today it is still a paradise for book-lovers and students. This place is mainly thronged by students from the nearby University of Calcutta and the prestigious Presidency college. Located opposite to College Square where swimmers plash around to cool off the not so lucky ones come here to cool down with their cooling drinks. Considering the fact that they use flavourings for most of the drinks it might not be a wise decision to travel all the way for the taste of the drinks but visiting it for its heritage is worth the effort because this opened its gates in 1918 and from my research it seems that it was a regular meeting place for revolutionaries  whose efforts gave us an independent nation. They have a list of famous personalities who have graced the shop hanging from the neatly painted walls.  Due to the sultry weather I opted for the famous Dab-Sherbet with crushed ice ( tender coconut water mixed with sugar and rose flavouring if I am not mistaken) It is a perfect cooler for Calcutta's humid ,unbearable heat. They charge an extra Rs2 if ice is not added since that requires a greater amount of tender coconut water to be used. A word of caution: In case you like your creamy drinks on the lighter side of sweetness ask them to add very little sugar because my aunt's green mango flavoured creamy drink was a bit too sweet for those who like mild sweetness. When visiting the area it is a must visit for anyone to cool down for a while during the summers. They get extra points for the cleanliness of the place.                    I personally did not like the arrangement of sitting because the benches where one sits has no back rest and due to the lack of space you often  bump against someone's back sitting back to back with you.

Finally, i see paramount in Zomato !!!

well u know, there are some places one can call LEGENDARY.... this is one of them ... The hav had a fan following for over 100 years... with regulars like Rabindra Nath Tegore and Uttam Kumar, this place has a lot to boast about... 

when ur sick of the kolkata humidity , one glass of the DAAB SHARBAT can take to to bliss.. 
Chiiled with pieces of tender coconut (saas) floating in it they make the sharbat out of the coconut water, with very gentle notes of kewra in it 

the tamarind and the green mango ones r mind numbing too 

The lassis are super refreshing especially the green mango one 

Also the coco malai and the cold coffee are huge favorites .. 

This is a family run place and u can see the warmth here and the pride they take in their product... the menu is not too vast but every drink is prepared with a lot of love and care.

College Street, a traditional name for each & every bengali's from his/her childhood. & this Juice bar "Paramount" is a gem of that crown. To me, the best juice bar in Kolkata. There you can find various types of juice & among them "Daber Sorbot" is the best.

I also like the "grape Crusher" & "Green Mango Juice". & those juices make my each summer wonderful.

Yes, the place is not for enough people, but if you consider that thing, then you'll get a heavenly touch of new juicy world.

Please go once there at summer & I'm sure you'll love this place.

the place is a tradition and legacy of Kolkata. the rose sharbat is a must try. the blue lagoon is also tasty. and don't forget to try the coco malai.one may easily miss the place. so, to make it easy, it's just opposite to college square towards the Calcutta University Institute. try to find SC Sarkar and Sons Book store and you'll locate paramount. it's a great way to quench your thirst in a hot sunny afternoon when you have gone to buy some books in the area.

This place may be small,but it sure packs a punch.The first thing that hits you is the old calcutta charm this dandy old place has.Its been graced by the presence of many bengali celebrities of the 80's and 90's...And it still lives upto its legendary reputation..Tucked away in the College street area of north calcutta,this place is an awesome watering hole for the parched souls all around.Ive tried out almost all their juice and sherbet offerings.Some of their more popular ones include Daab Sherbet and Coco malai..but even their simple orange and green mango and lemon flavored curd based drinks are refreshingly good. Almost all their drinks contain crushed ice;in fact it costs extra if you have one without ice. Visit this place in summer,and let this age old place help you beat the heat.

My father took me to Paramount almost 30 years back. I still remember the taste of Dab Sharbat I had over there. I was so damn heart-broken when I had it again a few days back. Paramount has definitely lost it's recipe. The magic potion definitely needs a Druid Getafix to bring back the eternal taste. But nonetheless, the place has not lost its charm. If you are a book-lover and love college street and have not been to Paramount, it is a crime. You must visit them once.

This place is purely old school calcutta..its a very small establishment with a very limited crammed seating arrangement for roughly 20 people(and when you are with friends you can always squueze in some more folks).
The ambience consists of the chatter of the customers,of the people who take and also serve the orders.Its a favourite of the college goers,the book-hunters,the university employees and the people who came back here year after after year to relive the old memories..
The place serves malai sherbets,sodas,syrups.Though most of the items on offer are great,the dab sherbet is the signature item of the place.My personal recommendation would be a green mango,you can also try rose or vanilla malai,the coco malai is a bit heavier and filling,and the more adventerous can try the grapes crush.All the drinks come with crushed ice,and they charge extra if you do not want ice.
A excellent visit on a hot summer afternoon!
