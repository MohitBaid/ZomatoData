Situated at the crossing of Southern Avenue and Lake this food truck is a wonderful option to have if someone happens to be in that area. Food served is fresh and delicious. Its price is also pretty reasonable and it can definitely be tried!!

My favorite food truck in the city does every little thing to breed healthy, happy people! From organic coffees to grilled chicken after your morning run - TGIF is a little bit of sunshine - on wheels! (Special mention to the chocolate balls in hot milk for these winter evenings) The menu surges with season's specials that hit both your sweet and savoury spots. From cooling watermelon juices to sizzling Maggi- all the food is delicious, pocket friendly and served fresh. Special shout out to the amazing staff who always put a smile on your face :)

I loved the whole idea of a food truck! It was quite cheap without the usual exorbitant taxes and the food was served promptly. We were delighted to locate this truck right beside the  Rabindra Sarabar lake.  We had some nice tea and chicken sandwich, which was delicious. Its a great place for evening snacks and takeaway . Must visit!

Sudden visit to this place was like inventing a place which I see everyday while going to office. Friends and great food, what more do you want. Everything about the food was good, the ingredients were fresh, the meat was succulent. The sandwiches overall tasted fresh and Crispy. The coffee was a surprise, came in a  vanilla cup but tasted as if made from freshly ground coffee.

Thank God there's a food truck so close to my place! :D
Well, my first time at a food truck and it was sooo good. This is hiked right next to Rabindra Sarovar, near the CRC gate. 
I had eaten here sometime back, but had forgotten to review it. Anyway, so here it is. Ordered :
• Grilled Mushroom sandwich 
• Virgin mojito
Both were really good. Especially the sandwich. Ample filling and really good to taste. 
I think the bill was around 200.
Good food at a cheap rate. Plus the guys out there are really friendly, so you'll totally have a good time. 
Keep up the good work and keep those yummy sandwiches rolling! :D

P.s. was way too hungry to click pictures. :P
