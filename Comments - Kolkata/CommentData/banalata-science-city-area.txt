Its in my locality so quite often I do visit, the food is good here.. Just the negative point is that they serve very late & one cannot ask for ambience as such; just sit & eat kinda restro..

Being a local resident of the same area its quite convenient. The service is a bit slow otherwise nothing else bugs me as such. The pasta with white sauce is quite good tbh. :)

Not sure one can term this as a restaurant but it is a single room having 3-4 tables, buffet counter, wash basin and kitchen all cramped together.
I had an opportunity to have food here as part of an workshop package. Vegetarian buffet is very average to ok; taste was flat. Only liked the Gulab Jamun which was softer than butter.
Located at fourth floor of Metropolis Inn in Metropolitan Housing Complex mainly for hotel guests.
Unless you are in that locality and starving will not recommend at all.
