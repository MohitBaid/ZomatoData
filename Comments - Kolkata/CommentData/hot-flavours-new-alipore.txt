Good service. Fast turnaround. Seating is not spacious but good for couples. Family of 4 or with children will be cramped in this place. Can improve.

Food is really good for the price. The Hakka and crispy fried noodles are great and healthy. Baby corn is also quite good though it could be made better. Non veg dishes are quite tasty

We have had chopsey, soup, crispy shredded chicken, honey chicken, Noddles and rice. Foods are extremely good. But the quantity is very less. Ambience is not very good but satisfactory. Honey chicken is a must try for everyone.

Hot Flavours located near new alipore triangular park, is a new restaurant that popped up on my zomato list. Parking was easy. Took suggestions from the waiter and he suggested us to try chinese bhel, veg schezuan noodles and sliced mix spiced chicken. Quantity is really small which is just enough to feed one person. Each and every item's quantity was small and prices are really high compared to the price. We ordered schezuan noodles but we were actually served normal hakka noodles but the waiter as well as the chef said it was schezuan noodle. I guess I'm eligible enough to differentiate between normal hakka noodle and schezuan noodle. Food tasted normal. Ambience was normal, nothing attractive. It is good for a one time visit. Definitely worth not trying again.

Nice place to have with your family and loved ones.... the ambience is nice and calm... the taste and quality of food is fantastic, though the quantity needs to be increased. They served the food before my expected time, and they have a positive attitude towards the customers... everyone should visit this place once.

If it's jst Chinese u love....then I guess it's the best place to go....
Great flavor and taste of authentic Chinese cusine.
The best part of this place is that it serves at very minimal cost.
With that price tag to get such QUALITY and  QUANTITY. ...is RARE....
U well deserve 5 üåü

Recommendation:

Oyster sause 
Hongkon chicken
Black pepper chicken
Ginger chicken
Sweet and sour chicken
Lemon chicken

Rice nd all...I guess the best one was burnt garlic mix 

Cheers....

This outlet is Situated very near to Gupta brothers . I visited it last evening alone . The ambience was pleasant . I ordered mixed American chopsuey ( half ) . After 7-8 minutes , i was served with my order . The chopsuey was served hot and seemed fresh . It was indeed fulfilling and value for money . The only thing i detested later was the presence of more ginger in the chopseuy at the end .

A very small food joint opposite to the United Bank of India, New Alipore.  It is a 2 seater place. So it's better to opt for take away.  Coming to the food, the quantity is really good as well as the quality. I tried their mixed hakka noodles and garlic pepper chicken. The garlic pepper chicken was well presented and looked really colurful with bell peppers and was tasty too. Overall, a good experience.

Back in Kolkata for a short trip and in the mood for some Chinese I turned to Hot Flavours run by a good friend of the family Sharat Mallick and he did not disappoint.

The good old Kolkata style of Chinese is what I was craving for and that's exactly what I got. Big momos with generous chicken filling and huge portions of noodles and rice.

The best part of the meal was the fish in oyster sauce which had the fish as beckty instead of basa which is what is served in most Bengaluru restaurants. 

Brilliant Sharat and team. All best wishes for the future.

I am rating and reviewing this restaurant on basis of the order through Swiggy, where the order was for a Non Veg Combo Meal. And I was not impressed. The Veg rice was just okay, but the Chicken gravy was bad. It had an unnecessarily huge amount of thin watery gravy. They should make it more consistent and gravy-like. The chicken pieces were quite small. Combo meal didn't work for me. Hope I will order some ala-carte stuff from this outlet and if my opinion change, then I may revisit my rating. As of now, not recommended.

Full marks to Swiggy, for delivering the food nice and hot to my place!

Ordered the following through Zomato

Pan Fried Chilly Chicken (1)
Fried Rice (2)
Chicken Tai Chin (1)
Crispy Chilly Honey Chicken (1)

I paid online and when the order got delivered there was one packet rice short. I contacted the Restaurant, they said they have received the order for only one Rice from Zomato and I should contact Zomato. Zomato's none of the Customer Care no. works so I had only one option - Chat with them. It took me around an hour to make them understand the issue and come back to me with a solution - I had to start chatting with 5-6 personnels in all of their options - Order Status, Incomplete Order, General, Billing Issues and so on so forth.¬†
Then after around an hour they came back to me saying they have contacted the restaurant and the restaurant is not willing to deliver anymore and they are refunding the money of one plate rice to my Zomato Wallet - which they did.

I had guests in my house and it was a disaster.¬†

Talking about the food - it was all right - OK..

Ordered a takeaway on a lazy afternoon with family. 
Dishes ordered:
Crispy chilli honey chicken - excellent , right balance of spice, sweetness , savoury and crispness .Recommended.
Mushroom in mild garlic sauce - quite watery and with very moderate amount of mushrooms , tasted ok. Order only if you are crazy about mushrooms and options are limited.
Sweet corn chicken soup - yum! Balance of sweet and savoury was on the sweeter side but still the taste was bang on.
Veg fried rice - just normal fried rice, nothing to write home about.
Crispy chilly baby corn - with a nice crunch, not too hot neither bland. Does its job, tingling your taste buds and prompting your fork to go out for more. 
PAN fried noodles ( which magically turned into Cantonese gravy noodles by Swiggy delivery) - horrible. Just horrible. I don't know for sure which dish this was, but to be on the safe side won't ever order either. Bland, half boiled, with inarticulate gravy full of cabbage - eeeshhh, baba. 
Resume - all in all an OK place for a regular takeaway. Will use.

This is one of the many eateries located on the New Alipore road.This is not a restaurant though they have one table cramped in front of their kitchen area .
On the first they we entered the place since we were passing by and from the sheer need of some greasy Chinese.
The place might not look impressive but their food tastes great. We had just ordered a pan fried chilli chicken and it arrived hot and so pretty . .hot red with spring onions.The prices are a biiiiitttt more than usual roadside places but the food is worth it. They have enough pieces of meat and that of very good quality too.
Within two days we packed some food from the place which is what I recommend for everyone. We ordered some hakka noodles,chicken and a fish. You will be very happy with the bill , I promise. The food was really good and the flavours really good and they are not too greasy. I will surely recommend the place for a takeaway dinner or lunch.

I never went to this place but last week I ordered through Swiggy. First of all the delivery service is very good. We ordered mixed fried rice, Manchurian chicken and shredded chicken in sweet and sour sauce. The fried rice was decent but they did not mix it with enough chicken or prawn. Sweet and sour was a disaster, I think after this experience I won't be having dish for a long time. Manchurian chicken was OK. Overall it was an average experience for me.

the dry cooked fish was the best of the lot, pure solid fish cooked with minimum oil and spice! the fried rice were on the dry side! a little more moist rice will be a lot better! the chicken was good too with a lot of gravy! overall, good experience! deivery was prompt as well :)

I had ordered mixed fried rice and golden fried prawn. The prawn was too dry and the batter was not up to the mark. As Shobhit Chandak said, you need to make the dishes less dry. Here's hoping for improvement. All the best. You are doing a good job. :-)

Its become a personal favourite! Also their food is not too oily or spicy which makes it ideal for weight watchers like me! Their chilli garlic hakka, diced potatoes in hot garlic sauce and hakka noodles in white gravy is an all time fav! Try their other stuff they are also equally good!:D

Tried this outlet for the first time today. Had ordered for office delivery the Mixed Hakka Noodles and Chilli Chicken trying not to be experimental on the very first go. The fare was really very good. The real bonus was that none of the dishes were too oily and spicy and the tendency to overdo things was not there at all. Homely, yet authentic Chinese food at a very reasonable price ....

For 265 odd the portion size could feed 2 and seemed value for food delivered in no - time!  Consistency is the key in dine - in places, time will tell if they will hold out well. For us, who have guests round the year, good Chinese is now a dine - in option in new alipore.

For a home delivery place that too in new alipore... getting this quality food at this cheap price is a thing dreams are made of...

we have ordered quite a few times from them and they have never failed to deliver hot and good food... agreed that it is not the  best but for home delivery in that area for this price they are amazing :D

the variety of dishes id pretty good and they customize the dishes pretty well which good restaurants also fail to do...

with that they have exotic veggies which they use lavishly... and thier portions are big also...

one request that please use more gravy in your dishes which can be almost next to none in some cases...

keep up the good work and hope to order from you soon...
