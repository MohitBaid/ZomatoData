This rating is based purely on the quality of Jaggery Shots which I had during the Street food festival in City Center Salt Lake. I must say this particular sweet definitely stands among the top. One should give it a try.

This shop at Hatibagan sells both savoury and sweet items. I had masala dosa, dhokla and 2-3 types of sweets. At this price, and the arrangements, one can have better around Hatibagan Shyambagan area. The dhoklas were good, but the other items were average only.

Located at the 4 point crossing of Hathibagan just beside hathibagan BATA showroom, this old sweet shop needs no introduction. It's a purely veg restaurant serving South Indian dishes as well. Wish to opt for South Indian food while shopping in hathibagan, K. C. Gope & Co. would be the best place to hop into! And so I along with my parents hopped into it. We ordered "Masala Dosa". It was tasty with quite a good amount of masala smash inside. But the supplements Chatni and Sambar were cold, and also didn't taste good. K. C. Gope needs to work a little on the quality of the Chatni but dosa quality was very good. Ambience is ok with quick service. Pocket pinch is a bit high but good food quality.

K C Gope at Hatibagan, North Kolkata was basically a sweetmeat shop and quite famous. It is famous for it's Radhaballavi-Aloor dom, Jive Gaja and Kulfi. Radha Ballavi is really tasty. But for few years, it has been serving Madrasi vada, aloo bonda(yummy),dosa, idly etc along with sweet meats. Very shortly, they have separated the stands. In one shop you can be treated with snacks, sweets, kulfi and cold drinks.

I have been a regular to this joint since the days when I used to visit Hatibagan holding my parent's hand . It is located near the Hatibagan More on Bidhan Sarani just beside the erstwhile Radha Cinema Hall now converted into shops . If you are moving towards Shyambazar 5 point Crossing from Hatibagan More the shop will be on your left hand side . Apart from various types of sweets they also serve dosa , idli etc which are quite good . Mostly visit here for their mouthwatering Kulfi which has remained the same since my childhood days . Ambiance & seating arrangement is clumsy due to shortage of space but the taste compensates those disadvantages .

Its a very proper location on North kolkata. It is nearby Hatibagan crossing beside Bata. The atmosphere is very good and also the service is too good.
In this shop the famous sweet is Baked Rossogolla and there is sell Dhakai Sampadhri in weight and also the teaste is super. Here the rosomalai and Dahibora was very teasty.

They had set up a stall at the Calcutta Classics Food Festival at City Centre today. They were serving South Indian and Bengali sweets and Kulfi. Their display of various sweets was appealing to the eyes. Baked malpua,firni,matka rabri etc. Was on display and it was difficult to decide what to eat. I decided to go for their Baked Rosogolla. It was yummy. The rosogollas were very soft. It's a must try dessert option here.

Age old sweet shop with sitting arrangements. Famous for lassi and basic kesar kulfi. Pictures attached are from City Center 1 Nolen Gur Festival. Located near Hatibagan Bata and Khadims. However the paneer from which they make sweets is a bit salty. Walls and the sink are super dirty. Always crowded due to it's popularity. Must go once to get a taste of vintage Kolkata.

Hatibagan is seriously developing a lot and now they have more restaurants and cafe joints than the legendary park street.I’m specifically talking about "K C Gope & Company" which is located near Bidhan Sarani close to a United Bank Of India branch.Owned by a Bengali, the place is well known and famous for the legendary collection of modern and classic sweets as well as the kulfi. A complete vegetarian sweet shop that serves south Indian food like Dosas, idlis and vadas as well along with the sweets.If you ever get a chance please visit it and try their "Ras malai" "Chocolate sandesh" "Orange rasgulla" "Maha rajbhog" "Nolen gur sandesh" "Kher kadam" and many many more. The sweets are really delicious and are healthy and hygienic as well.The cost is slightly on the higher side but it’s worth it once a while, yes not to forget their ever so yummy kulfi, just so good and delicious, one big cube of kulfi is good enough for one, the icing on the cake is the feluda and the rose syrup on top of it.

As far I remember this is the first time I have visited a Complete Vegetarian Restaurant. As soon as you enter into, you will find few posters written "No Onion No Garlic".

We went around 4.30pm and was hot inside. Unfortunately they couldn't run the AC due to some techincal issues with it. So we had to manage somehow with the fans. The restaurant is not that spacious so almost all the chairs were occupied but luckily a row was blank and slipped into.

On entering I found their wide range of sweets at the display. What I found to be their best seller was the Kulfi. Almost all of them were having the kulfi to get some relief from the heat.

And after much yes's and no's we ended up ordering Chhola Batura for both of us. We had to wait a bit because the batura took a little time to prepare. Anyway after we were served, I was literally lost with the awesome thing infront of me. A plate consits of two king-sized batura, chhola and a dash of mango pickle. You simply cannot complete your dish without giving a bite of pickle. It's just made for each other. Although I haven't tasted Chhola Batura before but I felt somehow it was perfectly made. I just loved it. Till the end you won't even get any hint that it's a veg prepararion. It's brilliantly made.

Since we were sweating we hoped for some Lassi but sadly they didn't have. Nevertheless, I wish to visit there sooner to explore more.

Happy eating!

A lot of childhood memories is associated wirh rhis place. My first ever Kulfi experience with my mother has started from here.

One of the oldest and well known name in Hatibagan area is K.C Hope & Co. 

Along with their sweets you get pure vegetarian food here too. You get South Indian as well as North Indian snacks dishes like paw bhaji , chilam bhatura etc. Food taste and quality is decent and standard. But mainly their desserts like baked rosogolla , rosomalai , chocolate kulfi and lassi are quite famous. Do drop in :)

Been coming here since childhood, mostly for their Kulfis. These guys used to make one of the finest Kulfi's in the city. A bit unclean ambiance, they have a small sitting place and can accommodate 10-15 people at the most. With Southern Delicacies and other snacks, people flock here usually to have a small eat out at economical prices. For their sweets, I used to like their Rabri and Rasmalai. Although, I do not get to visit this store much these days, K.C. Gope would always remain favorite to me for their Kulfi's.

Tried their matka rabri today. The classic food festival in city centre always works like a boon for me as I get to try many food from different joints in which I don't get a chance to visit normally. The display on the table of k.c.gope was quite attractive and I practically wanted to eat everything as they were according to my likings. There were mango doi, mihidana rabri,kesar rasmalai, kesar firni etc. The kulfis in his humid weather was enticing but as I already filled my stomach with other food items I settled with rabri which is one of my favourite dessert item. The dessert was good but the scooping the rabri from the matka was not quite easy for me and personally I would have preferred a wide mouth container. Nevertheless I would definitely visit their joint in hatibagan to try some other items.

Have been visiting this place since my childhood. This used to be a sweet shop which sold snacks also. But presently it's known more for the food. Like any other sweet shop, the food here is pure veg, without onion or garlic.

The South Indian dishes here are decent. The Aloo Paratha is also good. Chhole Bature or Paw Bhajis are not recommended.  The best item here, according to me, is their malai kulfi. It is a must try if you are around Hatibagan.

The place is not air conditioned as mentioned in Zomato.
