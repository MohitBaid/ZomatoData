This restaurant is located right beside my house, on the Northern Avenue street. 
Been here atleast 10-12 times!
An underrated place with simple but good food,if you ever come to this restaurant, without much wastage of money, you'll return home satisfied. 

Though I'd appreciate if they could make their tables a little bigger. There's not enough place to fit food for 4 people on a 4-sitter table.

Yesterday I and my best friend went here and ordered a thai soup and a manchow soup. The soups were served after 30 mins and what we found we cannot tell. My friend found three hairs and two baby cockroaches in her soup and i found two baby cockroaches and three flies in mine one. I dnt know how people rate this restaurant and the ones who have said that its good, to those please god knows what have you eaten with your good food. A very filthy place...

Visited this place for a Sunday night dinner. Ordered Chicken Kababs, Chicken Fried Rice, Mixed Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken. Service was fast. We started with Kababs. It was good. Chicken fried rice and Chilli Chicken was also good. But we found something is wrong with mixed fried rice. Finally we understand some smell is coming from the prawn. We reached out to the service boy. But he said he is seeing nothing wrong. Then we reached out to the manager. He immediately replaced that plate with a chicken fried rice. Really appreciate his behaviour and service. Apart from this, good quality and quantity of food in affordable price.

It's an old north Kolkattan restaurant serving quality food for a decade at a pocket friendly price. Placed in advantageous position near dumdum (5 min in rickshaw from dumdum station), the external look of the restaurant justifies it's age!

After couple of years,we, coaching friends went there for there special Murg mussalam after an exhaustive trip to and from burdwan and it was worth! Starting from the presentation of the chicken, the rice tossed in ghee and lightly dressed with vegetables and the spicy thick gravy-everything was synergised.The
chicken was properly tandoored and was tender.They deserve accolade specially because it's during durgapuja! It was a gastronomic pleasure at the end of day long epicurean journey..üòä

It was below average, I went there with my ¬†Buddhimoti, the sweet corn chicken soup had a smell , might be because of the out dated corns , other two orders were fried rice which was OK and chicken manchurian which was again below average , chicken pieces were not soft and was like rubber pieces. It really made me upset but the staffs were good.

This restaurant is probably the oldest and the biggest in this area. Biggest in terms of seating area where other restaurants are bit cramped. They serve everything you can typically ask for. Ambience is not that great and generally very less crowded except on Pujo days. Food is okay okay and they should uplift their items like coffee/tea and snacks items. No one like machine coffee. Item price are bit costly. Management should look into these matters seriously. Parking is also problem.

I Donno y people rate this restaurant so low... But trust me this is my second dinner stop... Whenever I feel hungry and not to eat 'barir khabar'.. I come here... Nothing special in interior... Going straight to the food..
As I have tasted most of the foods of there menu chart so according to me.. it's avarage in taste.. obviously don't expect something like 5star restaurant...
Now my favourite dishes of this restaurant and my suggestion to u guys are...
In veg section - spicy aloo dam, paneer tikka marsala
In Chinese starter - chili mushroom and crispy chili baby corn,
In Indian non veg - rajshahi mutton, chicken tikka butter marsala
In Indian main course do try there murg masallam and ice and spice special biriyani
In Chinese main course try schezwan noodles, dragon fried rice and Mongolian fried rice
Hope u vl like iy

In Bengali there's a phrase which translates roughly as 'making a goal when there's no one around'. That is exactly what Ice and Spice has been doing. The sheer lack of good restaurants in and around this locality has enabled it to carry on, inspite of dismal food qualities. My only visit to this place had been utterly disappointing. I had come across negative reviews before, but it was by compulsion that we had to drop in, for no other restaurant was found empty. The seating area was a bit crammed, but that was to be the least of our worries. Service was quite slow and when the food finally arrived, it tasted pathetic. Main courses - noodles and fried rice - were more or less decent, but the side dishes - haven't tasted anything so horrible in a long time. The paneer had just been sliced and thrown into the gravy, and served just like that. It was still perfectly white, while the gravy was little more than a mass of cornflour soaked in water. The chicken was also not what you expect in a restaurant. They should seriously upgrade their standards if they wish to continue with this business.

Being the only restaurant at Northern Avenue does help Ice & Spice for sure. This place has got quite large sitting area with two floors, average rather ordinary decor, average service, average food. This joint is mostly famous for takeaway and deliveries. If you want to you can go for their Chinese main course, fish fingers and Shami kebab for appetizers to be safe. Don't you dare try their mughlai items or Biriyani or 'Chelo Kebab'. Don't.

Ice & Spice is been a memoir of childhood for me as my ancestral house is located in it's vicinity. It can be called as an "oasis" in the dry dessert of Northern Avenue area in terms of a proper sit and dine restaurant. The TSP of the place is its minimal price compared to the generous quantity they serve.
The food and the staffs are average and going by the price they serve the food, it's completely acceptable. The Chinese here is better than its North Indian counterpart and the recommended dishes are Mixed Noodles, Dragon Chicken and Chilli Chicken dry. The Biriyani is just not recommended. If you are up for North Indian strictly, then go for Breads with sides. The desserts are okay and nothing too special !

Me nd my family have had their murg musallam many times before but never tasted any other items. Today we had their murg mussallam, chicken bharta nd chilli fried babycorn. Murg mussallam as usual is a delight to the taste buds. Apart from that i did not like any of the other items. Chili fried babycorn was too spicy, butter nan was too much rubbery. Chicken bharta was also nothing special to comment about. We always went for takeaway so cant comment on their service but the person taking the order in the phn is vry descent and patient to take the order. Another thing to mention- they use very less amount of salt in all their preparations so be sure to keep ur salt in the table.

Have you ever been to a local restaurant with the perfect ambience and the perfect food and at perfect prices? Try this if you haven't been. It was our favourite during our school days. They nail the Chinese equally well as they do with their mughlai. My personal favourite is the Dragon chicken, the lemon chicken, the handi biriyani and the tutti fruity ice cream. If its a weekend or a holiday..you need to be early here to grab a seat.

Located at Paikpara, Ice and spice, is one of those rare eateries at Paikpara, which have a seating area, and dine-in facility. In fact, I have been a regular visitor of this place, ever since it came up, almost a decade back. Besides being pocket-friendly, this place is cozy and relatively hygienic, and serves tasty stuff. The only hitch is their service, which can go from bad to worse, depending on the time of the day/ crowd. At times, the loud school-going/college-going crowd could be a major turn-off. However, the recent addition of the 1st floor seating area, is a good option, for people who want long conversations over coffee. The menu is decent, but the only thing missing, is cold coffee. I have tasted a host of items here, ranging from their special chicken biryani, chicken fried rice, hong kong chicken, dragon chicken, dry chilli chicken, chopsuey, noodles, and chocolate ripple (My favourite, among the ice-creams on the menu). This used to be one of my favourite haunts, during my childhood , teenage and college going years. However, the waiters had become pretty arrogant, a few years back, and that made me avoid this place, for quite some time. Visited it again, today, when I went to my old 'para', and found the service to be a bit better, than in the recent past. Over-all, an average, affordable option, when all one needs, is food, sans decor and glitz.

Went there once while on my way back from paying the bill for wifi. 
A basic air conditioned setup...moderate service.
I ordered a plate of rice, dal fry and a plate of bhetki paturi. Dal fry was not upto the mark...in fact it was just a regular bangali dal. Paturi came  at 4 portions a plate,well- cooked but lacking the delicate balance of flavours.
A one-time visit when there was no other option in sight.

If you are close to Dumdum and in a mood to have some Indianized Chinese or North Indian cuisine then at once rush to Ice and spice.

We got home delivered. They brought us Chicken fried rice, mixed noodles, chicken chilly, Chicken biriyani, and chicken bharta. All the items tasted good and was well prepared. Both rice and noodles had adequate amount of chicken, prawn and egg. Each plate would satisfy two people.

¬†It happens to be a very reasonable place with decent food and large quantity.

Keep eating! :)

Average food quality... Its better to try Chinese foods in this restaurant rather than trying the indian dishes. Ambience is an average and u wait a long time after ordering your food. In short.. Its an average restaurant with an average food quality.

Ice and Spice is an average eatery located near DumDum Road,nothing special about this place,it is meant for the regular take away when u r not ready to travel to a better or farther restaurant..this place is quite economical and serves decent enough foods,however one major con is the quantity served by them is very less,even their portions might not fill a single person's apetite..They serves an array of Indian and Chinese cuisines..though I would personally prefer their Indian dishes..The servers here are quite inefficient,they have two storeys of dine-in facilities..
Some of the better and recommended items are: Masala Kulcha,Mutton Patiala, Chicken Tandoori,Chicken Barabani Kebab, and their Murgh Mussallam..
Food: 2.5/5
Pricing: 3/5
Service: 1/5

This place used to be pretty good at one point of time for basic Indo-Chinese. However, the quality has deteriorated massively in the last few years. I was very disappointed the last time I ate out here and have decided not to go back. The ambiance was never something to talk home about, but it used to be a favourite because was the dishes were tasty ¬†and the bills very reasonable.

This restaurant is pretty close to my cousin's place in Northern Avenue. So, used to bring our ordered food items home for most of the times.
It was here that I first came across Singaporean Fried Rice. It had an assortment of all the protein rich items like sliced pieces of chicken, prawn, scrambled eggs and veggies like peas, sliced carrots seasoned with cashews and raisins. They had discontinued this dish for some time, but now I find that the same is back on their menu.
Their Hong Kong Chicken is also worth a try because their method of preparation of the dish is unique.
I shall, though, forbear to speak anything about their ambiance as opportunity never came my way to dine at this food joint.

After roaming whole of calcutta the worst things we had done is to visit this restuarant.  The first time I ordered at this restuarant & the waiter didn't knew what wasi n the menu . He had to come back to inform that it was't prepared today. So everyone please try other alternatives there are many better eaters at Dumdum

This restaurant is bang on the Northern Avenue, connecting Tala Park and Dumdum Road. You cant miss the spot given its strategic location. The food offered, specially the chinese ones are good but ambience and service is reeking and shall absolutely turn you down.
Food- 4/5

Service- 3/5
Value for Money- 3/5
Its basically a takeaway joint but tpp over priced to succeed. Quality of food is good but service isnt professional and ambience is a strict no no. They will make you sit on plastic chairs though they have  a strong AC.

This restaurant was the only luxury dining I received during my childhood. The food here is quite nice. The seating arrangements are good but some of the chairs are wobbly. The inside is clean with no fancy decor. The food is good and very very cheap. So, the food quality to price ratio is extremely good. We ordered the Mixed Fried Rice and the Dragon Chicken (which is my favorite here). People at Dum Dum should consider this place.

Well I don't know about other fellow reviewers, but I have a nice time at Ice nd Spice. I am a regular customer to this restaurant for a long time and I really like the food here. Nowadays most of the restaurants charge a whooping rate for any Chinese dish. But Ice nd Spice still have kept it cheap. Now @75 you cannot expect a Chicken Fried Rice that would feed two people, so whatever they provide in one plate is quite enough for a person's meal.¬†

The reason behind not giving Ice nd Spice 5 star is not because of its food, but for the service they are offering. A lot of waiters are not up to the mark and often misbehave and provide late service. But many of them are also nice guys.

So in total, whatever the ratings are, you should atleast visit the place once, if you are a north Kolkata resident and then judge by yourself. Kudos.

I have visited this place since my schoollife. that time it used to be one of the most popular restaurant in that area. i have been there more than 30-40 times, used to serve the best food in such rate. but later on, they have lost their reputation in a large extent. currently their service, ambience, food quality everything is detoriated. even last few times i got a very bad smell in the ground floor rooms. but still it is running because of unavailability of proper competitive restaurant in the northen avenue area.

regarding food, i would say chinese dishes are better than indian ones. the moti biriyani was good, they used to provide 3 pieces of chicken with the biriyani, but the quantity was quite less. rather in general, their food quantity is very less. in chinese i have tried chicken/mix/fisherman fried rice with scezwan, chilly, hongkong, sing sing chicken sidedishes and lots of other dishes also. the taste is fine now a days, still ok to have if you are very hungry. as a whole, the rating i have given, mainly based on my through out experience. if i was a recent visitor, my rating should not cross 2...

If you have not tried its Bhetki Paturi, drop whatever you are doing and try it. It serves North Indian and Chinese food along with some traditional Bengali dishes during the festive seasons. Its pricing is very reasonable, Service is pretty well managed by some friendly people. 

If you stay anywhere near this place and want to visit it just for its Bhetki Paturi, you are a wise person :D Although from personal experience I would suggest to give them a call before and find out if they would make Paturi on that day or not.

If u wanna grab a bite of chinese or north indian food it is very good..i have tried their handi mutton which is extremely tasty..their mixed fried rice and dragon chicken is very tasty and dragon chicken i find as their speciality its taste is not chilly yet not of sweet n sour..and ice and spice special chicken biriyani or moti biriyani when served hot is juz mindblowing when i get such good food in such low cost..
Though the service is little late here..yet i would recommend those who havent tried it to gve it a try...:)

When u do not want to spend a lot and u stay near northern avenue, want to have a quick bite- u can choose this place. No fancy decor - a step up from a road side small cafe. Yester day I had chicken biriyani, dum pulao (mix of chichen, mutton, prawn, egg with basmati rice) and chicken tikka masala with salad - I was pretty satisfied with the food. And my husband till night kept on saying "food was good". 
Now with this price range - either u sacrifice decor or food. I am happy they took the right decision.

In past I had ice cream and they decorate the ice cream aptly before serving. So looks nice.
It is a place mostly for localites, so if u stay near by - hop in there for some good food.. :-)

Before it was good as it is quiet cheap  and the food quality is good,but nowadays there are less waiters and  if you order your dish you will get it after an hour or so and sometimes they even forget what you have ordered .
They are quiet irresponsible and they seemed least conserned about their costumers.
Ice & Spice is located near  Northern Avenue.
It is a two floored restaurant.
They also give home delivery which is a plus point .
American Chopsey is really good and also Mixed Chowmein ,Dragon Chicken ,Garlic Chicken  and also their desserts .
In total its a good place to hangout with your friends  and the food is good,but you have to remind the waiter frequently about your food .

The only restaurant reasonably close to its proximity, it provides a spot for an unplanned dinner as no one who wants to have a good night out would opt for this. Reasonably priced though it is, it often doesn't have numerous things on its menu which is always disappointing. The food is okay, but you wouldn't consider coming back anytime soon.

Pros- Reasonable pricing and lack of alternatives in the area.
