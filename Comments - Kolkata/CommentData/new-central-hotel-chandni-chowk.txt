Best place to have good food and alcohol while you enjoy the excellent service without over-draining your wallet. Tips to order: dry chilli chicken, katla/pomphret fry.

The food here is good, tasty and reasonable. Good place for cheap booze. The ambience might seem a bit shady. Also they don't have all the booze that you order. And the service is pathetic. The waiters are rude and forcibly take a big tip. It was a bad experience to be here.

Nice place to have booze. Food quality n taste is also good. Fare service, cheap and pocket friendly. Smoking allowed. Good communication. Just behind central metro station on chittaranjan avenue. People should try this place.

Well , just outside my hostel this bar is one of my favourite places... Lots of memories are attached to this place... I hav visited many times to have a beer or rum or whisky in many times like durgapuja, holi, chirstmas or new year or for post semester enjoyment. Actually they have their permanrnt customer. And their food is also quite good. One can definately try dry chilli chiken or kebabs with their drinks. But my choice is beer with masala badam and chips.. So , yes once in your time, you can come here for a drink with your friend instead of going to park street or esplanade..
