Amount and timing are perfect. We ordered 3 thalis but found to be enough for 4. Quality of the daal to be improved. Readymade mixes (like for Dhoka) to be avoided. Overall taste is not bad, but not that good also. But must say that it's obviously value for money. If you want Bengali thali (not with high expectation) and don't want to spend much, you can opt for it. I ordered for veg thalis. But I think it would not be much different for non-veg.

Intro : Never visited - ordered through zomato 

Food -  Sabji , Rice Dal Bhaja Thali with Dhokla 

This is perhaps one of the worst meals that I have ever had 

Sabji and dhokla - simply had 90% potatoes - there was just one piece of dhokla .
Similar scenario for the Sabji 1/5

Dal - Thickness is a far away island - it looked like I was having a clear soup with traces of pulses -1/5

Overall - Bad 1/5

Dont ever order from this resturant.Worst food i had in my life.I have ordered three veg thali along with egg curry..rice quantity was good..but the soyabeen curry was rotten giving foul smell and bad taste..
How on the earth anyone can give rotten curies after taking such high price for one plate...
My sincere advice is to avoid this resturant at all cost

Well , ordered a fish thali

Bhaat - was of good quantity.
Daal- tasted good 
Aloo bhaja- the quantity was too less for one person to eat.
Sabji(Aloo capsicum Bora torkari) - bit sour , but average taste 

Fish - rui Mach sorshe , the piece was good and the portion was ok for one person..

But the worst thing delivery time. It was suppose to deliver at 12.20pm delivered at 1.20, on hour late. 
While putting up my order they said they will be giving a complementary dish for free that is "payesh" which was a hoax, I didn't t receive any sort of that..
Kindly note don't give false hope , I could have odered that separately.

Ordered through Zomato and being a member of Zomato treats got a complimentary Payesh (Rice Pudding).

Fish Rice, Dal, Sabji, Bhaja Thali - The side dish of vegetable was not so good otherwise the whole thali was quite okay.
Dhokar Dalna - I did good by ordering a separate veg side dish as the Thali side dish was awful but this one was good.
Special Chicken - The gravy was very good and overall it seems to order separately than Thali though Thali is cost effective.

An economic option if there are some emergency / requirement in your house.

Ordered 2 chicken meal, 1 veg meal (dhoka) and 1 fish meal.
Basic veg meal includes rice, aalu bhaji, dal, aalu and i guess mulo shobji, +dhoka. And other meals had either fish or chicken in extra (except dhoka).
Quantity was more than enough.
I would like to suggest that instead of providing 6-7 people's daal in 4 meals, include a little bit of chatny to complement the food. And i know aalu is cheap and excellent item to profit in food business, but it does not feel nice to have aalu bhaja,aalur torkari,aalur jol that includes dhoka. Alu alu alu is not what we want to have in lunch aftr spending 120rs per plate, 1kg aalu is way cheaper than that. Prices are good enough to include other vegetables. And keep two options for the curry, every one can not have shorsher jhol due to health problems. 
Thank u so much for providing the food today. Good luck. Hope your service gets better with time.

On a trial basis my parents recommended me for ordering this restaurant. On the auspicious day of Maha Ashtami we preferred to go for bengali cuisine as lunch! We have ordered for 3 veg combos! The food quality was fabulous! They delivered us Jhiri Jhiri Aloo Bhaja, Amrar Tok Dal, Chal Potol, Aloo Jhinge Posto and Chutney, Papad, Mishti. Found them on Swiggy also but ordered through Zomato. A great Bengali Cuisine taste that we can all say about Dubbawala. Try it once!

Food? Worst of all.
Trust me. This is the worst place for food. Not sure if they can cook a bowl of MAGGI. 
I ordered my food at around 9:30pm. The delivery man took about 1 hour 15 minutes to reach my place. When I opened the packets, the food was totally rotten. Even the rice wasn't in a good condition. I requested a refund but they refused me to pay me the sum of money. They arranged me a replacement on the following day. But there wasn't any change in the quality of food. I'll never try this restaurant ever again in my life nor will I recommend this restaurant to anyone.

Most horrible experience. My order was supposed to be delivered by 01:17pm. It's almost 4pm, no sign of the order. On top of that, the restaurant claims Zomato's Customer support that they have called me informing the delay. What lie. I simply hate to understand how Zomato vets these service providers.

Ordered for three mutton meal yesterday through Zoamto at lunch. They delivered us sabji, bhaji Dal, Mutton ( 4 Pcs ) & Chatni. Bhaji was excellent, Dal and bhaji was okay in quality and quantity. Sabji made with potol was mouth watering blended with rice. Mutton quantity, portions were too good. It was with aloo also. And more over it was not at all rich. Prepared with less oil. Chatni was okay. We enjoyed the whole lunch a lot. Spl my parents enjoyed them a lot.Â 

Looking forward for giving them more orders and will recommend all Zoamto users to taste it. I will recommend this joint to all my friend & relatives Thank you Team - Dubbawala and above all Zomato...

Had there been <1 Rating option in zomato I would have picked that one up without doubt. I had ordered from this place 2 weeks prior to my next and hopefully the last order. And trust me it has been a horrible experience overall. Food quantity is too less. Ordered 2 veg meals,1 chicken meal and 1 egg meal. Quality is horrible too. Rice was sufficient for 2 instead of 4. Dal was so less that it wasn't sufficient for that less rice amount too. Sabji for 4 was packed in a small container which felt less for 1 of us even. Ah! Crap. I am at a loss of words to describe this experience I had. Not once, but twice. My recommendation : Never order from this place they are robbing in the name of business.

Disappointing, Pathetic......

We ordered for lunch through Zomato at 12:22 PM & received the order at 2:53 PM. In the screen the expected delivery timeline was 60 min

Total cost - Rs 586/-

There was a hair on one of the box. Pic attached for reference

Item-wise experience in terms of quantity, quality n taste:
Rice - Quantity was ok but quality/taste was so so, it was not fine rice, seem I was having lunch at a roadside hotel
Sukto - Quantity was ok but cannot comment on the taste as the entire item was stale
Macher Bora - Quantity & quality/taste was ok
Telapia - Quality/taste was ok
Papad - Half baked
Chutney - Quantity is unexpectedly less as compared to the price but quality/taste was ok
Gajar Halwa - Quantity & quality/taste was ok

At overall level I personally will not order for food here & I strongly recommend others to avoid this food place

Thanks to Team Zomato for their extensive support. Zomato has initiated refund of entire bill amount because of my bitter experience at my first deal with Zomato though refund was not my concern. Zomato needs to be more cautious in dealing with such food places

Food too sweet for my taste...not sure what prompts them to add sugar to every dish but this is definitely a health concern. Also, they are unethical and service is unprofessional.  Will send you what they have and not what you order and expect you to pay the balance. More than that nobody bothers to inform if there are changes to the order. Cannot be used for daily consumption and the unreliability factor will make me think twice before ordering. There are better options around.

Ordered two fish meals for lunch from Garia for Rs. 400/. Â The Dal was stale on arrival. Quantity of rice was insufficient. Some amount subji Â (both the subjis) and a piece of Fish was leftover which I kept them in fridge at around 2 o'clock for having it during dinner. Â All of them got spoiled when I took them out of fridge at around nine o'clock. Â Their tall claim that the freshly prepared food is served is totally wrong. The taste of the food is good but Â all credit is taken away by the quality of food. Â Hope we will not have health problem. In short it is risky to use their service. I personally will never use their service again.
