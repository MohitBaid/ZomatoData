HYGIENE CAUTIOUS Foodies Can Stay away.

This area is close to my residence. Have been eating here since childhood, not frequently, but many a times for sure.

Prices are reasonable but quantity is not sufficient whether its rolls, chowmein, rice or Pakoras.
Plus, their stock isn't that great too, neither do they increase. The pakoras,momos, lollipops, are cooked long before the shop is opened , and is served hot, heated on the tawa.

DO FOLLOW ME IF YOU LIKE MY REVIEW. I PROMISE TO POST MORE REVIEWS IN THE FUTURE, AND WILL TRY NOT TO DISAPPOINT.
