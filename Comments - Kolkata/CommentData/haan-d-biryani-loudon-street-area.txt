It’s no longer that time anymore when a few names are the clear market leaders in Kolkata as far as serving biryani goes. Newer places are coming up, and are becoming hot favourites. Once such place - Haan D’ Biryani. Tried it today. The biryani they claimed was made from refined oil, truly. Usually biryani rice dries up in a matter of 10 minutes after heating it all thanks to the dalda. This time it didn’t. The chicken/mutton was cooked properly and were very soft. Rice quantity was impressive. Even tried the chicken chaap - the taste isn’t quite like the usual chaaps we have but it was still good. It’s a takeaway place so They pack their biriyani in plastic boxes, picture labelling of your dish which was different from what we usually find in town and quite convenient in the event you’re taking different types of biryanis. The AJC Bose road counter has just become operational so they aren’t serving everything on the menu, but whatever they are, they’ve already won my heart. Will go back soon.
