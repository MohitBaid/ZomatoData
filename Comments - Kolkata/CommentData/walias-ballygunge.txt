Ordered veg chowmein from this outlet today.. it was stinky.. totally spoilt food.. not edible at all. Had the same experience before when complained to the owner she refused to take my order . Extremely rude staff n owner. They seem to increase the price of their food every week but the quality of food just keeps deteriorating.
