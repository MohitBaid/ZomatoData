After roaming i found this Misti Shop.
I took away below items-
1)Rabri
2)Rosomalai
3)Misti Doi
Everything was outstanding.
I really love their Misti Doi..Mindblowing.
Must try Misti Doi here.

Good is the only thing i can say about this place. Shree Laxmi Mistanna Bhandar is close to College Street Bata, i have been here and tried few of their Sandesh. Each of them were excellent in taste. Prices are also reasonable compared to the quality. The place is also clean.

Zomato - the name which is a blessing for reviewers and owners alike, can be disastrous to some and deceive many. I have been rating restaurants for almost 14 months now I have found the ratings for the restaurants almost near perfect or on the higher side. However, for this particular sweet shop, I felt that the ratings are little lower than deserved. Yes, it is underrated.

Shree Laxmi Mistanno Bhandar is located among the prime location of Kolkata and despite being a small shop, its confectioneries are of good quality. I am not a sweet lover, but, still I found myself liking it from here. I generally do not even prefer Misti Doi, but well again, I liked it from here.

They makes various kind of rasogollas - various flavours added to the rasogolla and I can certify that the users giving less ratings haven't tried them yet. Also, the Misti Doi seems to be the best in the whole College Street Area.

There isn't any seating arrangement for people to sit and try making it lose some points but when you get value for money, those minor setbacks can be ignored. The price for the confectioneries, in my limited knowledge, can be termed reasonable.

One will always find this shop flocking with people which gives you an idea about the popularity. Because my dear, you can deceive people once or twice, but, not the entire lifetime.

A visit is recommended!

A small outlet near College Street Bata on Keshab Ch Road. Come and try their Sandesh. They have a variety of Sandesh and all of them are good to eat. I tried out one and it was very good. They also have a few Chocolate sandesh which was also very tasty.

কলেজ স্ট্রিট এর রাস্তায় হেটে বেরানো টা একটা অভ্যাস এর মধ্যে পরে গেছে , সেই রাস্তায় হাটতে হাঁটতে একদিন বাটা মোর এর কাছে এসে এই দোকান  আবিষ্কার করি । বিভিন্ন রকম মিষ্টি টে পরিপূর্ণ । প্রায় সবকটাই একবার করে চেখে দেখা যেতে পারে । খিরকদম , রসগোল্লা , আর মিষ্টি দই টা উল্লেখ ।

পড়ে পাওয়া চোদ্দ আনার মতই বই কিনতে এসে আবিষ্কার করি । ঝাঁ চকচকে ব্যাপার নেই , কিন্তু থালায় ভরা গুপ্তধন উঁকি মারছিল । রসগোল্লা আর দই খেয়ে জিভ চাটতে চাটতে শিয়ালদার দিকে হাঁটা দিলাম ।

A very renowned, popular and old sweet shop, located near College Street Bata. Minimal ambiance, but the sweets here are exceptional. Tried their Roshogolla and Mishti Doi, both of which were exceptionally. Recommended to everyone. :-)

This is a very old shop near college street bata. I only buy this chocolate sweet which everyone becomes a fan of after having. It has this hard chocolate coating on the top and a sweet soft inside with chopped nuts. They are priced at 10 a piece and are completely worth it. Bought rasagulla as well today. For 5 per piece they are wow! Soft and spongy,one can easily down 3 4 pieces at a go. :-)
