Only presentation. Nothing great in food. Slow service. Lots of items had same ingredients. Ambience is good. Valet parking availability a positive but all this does not compensate for average food.

After many years a class restaurant with excellent food, lovely ambience and excellent service. Reminded me of a French restaurant I visited in Tokyo on the 35th floor. Found a lot of similarities except that this one is much smaller. The Tokyo restaurant had a reception area on the immediate floor below and could be viewed from the dining area. This one has a banquet on the lower floor

A fine dine pure veg resturant at the heart of kolkata.
For all the vegitarians out there this is one of the perfect place for you to try.
They have a variety of mocktails like  colada cucumber mojito, pink lady, shake bite and many more the above mentioned were good.
Must try for the starters are Benaras ki chat and Patiala shahi bhatti paneer were oir favourite.
For the main course Roulade paneer and Mediterranean grilled steak, its the signature dish they serve.
From the desert Montecarlo, cheese cake and baklava is very good.
The service the really nice.
They arrange party, candle light dinners and also have  private space for a group.

Calcutta has got another pure vegetarian restaurant, Sesame, which it can boast of. Located on the 5th floor of the FBB building at Shakespeare Sarani, the place is huge. It looks classy and elegant. One is sure to fall in love with this beautiful place. I was recently invited here for a bloggers meet. I was surprised to find the huge variety in the menu of a pure vegetarian restaurant. This is definitely a paradise for vegetarians as they can find almost everything from North Indian to Oriental and Continental under one roof. I tried a number of dishes from each section, and all of them turned out to be excellent !

This vegetarian's paradise is located in Theatre Road, on the 5th floor of the building just beside Fbb fashions. This is a spacious place with a private dining area, a lounge, huge seating areas with enough tables to accommodate a large number of people. It provides a wide range of North Indian, Italian, Chinese, Thai cuisines to choose from. They have also introduced Rajasthani Thali on Saturdays. They entertain bookings for Kitty parties, birthday parties, workshops, family get-togethers and other social gatherings. I was invited to taste a few of their specialities. 
They served us with mocktails which included:
1. Mint Memorise 
2. Pink Lady 
3. Icy Spicy 
4. Russian Mojito 
5. Out of School 
6. Shake Bite 
7. Litchi Cooler 
All the mocktails were really good with perfect amount of sugar syrup and flavours to make deadly mocktails. 
The starters menu has :
1. Tandoori baked Malai Broccoli - Includes tandoor baked balls stuffed with broccoli and malai which are soft and crispy.
2. Dimag ka dahi- Fried balls tempered with curd, together with the dip tastes brilliant. 
3.Curd Rice Fritters - soft and crispy fried rice balls tempered with curd, cheese, green chilis and curry leaves. 
4. Banaras ki chaat - Typical Banarasi flavoured chaat with aloo, papri, peanuts, curry leaves, curd, sweet sauce and tamarind. 
The main course included :
1. Rauland Paneer - the presentation of this dish is very unique and the paneer chunks are very soft. Topped with cheese, the tender paneer pieces, along with the dip tastes heavenly. 
2. Apricot Malai Kofta - A unique touch to the ordinary malai kofta, with apricots. It has a thick semi-gravy with the apricot flavour being dominant, the veg koftas stuffed with malai is a very good accompaniment with naan or parathas. 
3. Mediterranean Grilled Steak- This is their speciality dish and the presentation of the same is commendable. It has grilled Vegetable patties, soft and crispy, served with herb rice and jalapeno sauce. It's quite filling and a must order. 
Finally, the desserts menu had :
1. King of Lime Cheesecake with Blueberry Sauce 
2. Tutty fruity ice-cream 
3. Volcano Chocolate with Icecream
4. Chef's special Baklava 
5. Monte Carlo 
The location and ambience of this place gets full marks. The service is commendable with the staff always ready at your service. The presentation of the dishes and the mocktails gets an A+ The food tastes really good and provide good portions, each dish enough to serve 2-3 persons. The price is also reasonable depending on the location of this place. It's a must visit restaurant for all the vegetarians.

Vegetarian restaurants are an emerging breed in the city and this competition is driving up the levels of services and culinary. Following this trend, Sesame recently opened up in Shakespeare Sarani. It is located on the 5th floor of the same building as Club Boudoir. To my amazement, the interiors and décor of this place were way beyond expectations. The furnishings have a posh finesse and there is a wide window backdrop that provides a lovely view of the greenery around. Some of us bloggers had been invited here for a food tasting event. Here’s the proceedings…

Starting our luncheon, we ordered some in-house mocktails. Russian Mojito and Out Of School were pleasantly unique in taste. Litchi Cooler and Pink Lady were some of other ones we tried.

We had some delightful starters, of which Tandoori Baked Malai Broccoli deserves a special mention. Even if you hate green veggies, you’ll definitely love this one. Banaras Ki Chaat is a crispy spinach chaat served with sweet yogurt, tamarind & mint chutney. Dimag Ka Dahi was the classic dahi kebab. Curd Rice Fritters were steamed rice balls tempered with curd, curry leaves, cheese, green chillies and deep fried.

The restaurant takes great pride in its Mediterranean Grilled Steak Sizzler. The platter comprises of grilled vegetable patty served with herbed rice and cheesy jalapeno sauce. There are also some potato fries and grilled vegetables.

For the main course we had Roulade Paneer which is rolled paneer served in tomato methi gravy and Apricot Malai Kofta which were succulent cottage cheese dumplings stuffed with apricot, saffron & nuts in cashew nut gravy. Both the dishes were pretty satisfying in terms of both flavour and quantity.

The desserts were truly divine. King Of Lime Cheesecake was served with blueberry sauce in grand style, an amazing presentation. Monte Carlo and Baklava also won over our hearts.

The service was fluent throughout the event.
So folks that was about it from Sesame.
Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!

This a pure Veg restaurant operated by one of the leading caterers of Kolkata - Ruia. The decor is quite nice and seating is comfortable. While we read a lot about the slow service - we were given extremely prompt service. The Staff were very co-operative and ensured our special requests were fulfilled. The food is quite good but the portion sizes were small when compared to the prices - the Sizzler we felt was not even sufficient for 1 person. Special mention for the Malai Broccoli - we would come back anyday for just that dish. 
Major Attraction - Spacious Private Dining Rooms for a private party/get together for 10-15 pax.
Major Mood Spoiler - The restaurant is on the 5th floor with an open area below which they also operate a Banquet hall. The noise from the Banquet area is too annoying. However, I was told that the management has planned to cover up the open space to reduce noise from below.

Just coming back from this place. The 'only' plus for me is that it is a pure veg restaurant. So you can very much guess how the review is going to go from here. To start, we sit at the table and notice that there are two varieties of glasses for water which is not normal. Then the fresh lime was also served in different glasses and so was mint chutney. If this is some sort of innovation, please tell me because it didn't come across to me atleast. Then on the menu, some of the interesting dish names have been copied for other places (e.g feta khao beta from Cafe 4/1). We ordered starters - khandvi pesto, dahi kebab, greek roll and crispy chili babycorn. Nothing stood out. Pad thai, pasta, aglio olio and risotto comprised our main course. Risotto was good, rest everything was decent. Pad thai was quite spicy despite mentioning to keep the spice low. And the portion size is smaller than regular. Not good enough for even 4 people. Overall, not one of the experiences that stays with you.

It has been a conscious endeavor of mine to promote and encourage fully vegetarian  eating out options. We really look forward to more and more fully vegetarian restaurants opening in our City of Joy. 
Guys we visited a new classy fully vegetarian restaurant -  Sesame. 
Opened on the fifth floor of Shakespeare point building off Theatre road, this is a multi cuisine restaurant with several options like Indian, Continental, Oriental etc. 
Since we were just two people we could just manage to have some appetizers, one sizzler in main course and one dessert. 
We had Tandoori baked Malai Broccoli which was super succulent and soft, topped with cream cheese, this dish was awesome. Apart from this we had Thai corn balls which had the right amount of spicy taste. Their Mediterranean Sizzler was also pretty good. 
The quality is top notch and the price range 200-300 per item. Had a great gastronomic experience and would like to visit again to try out more dishes.

Will give marks simply for the service and police staff.
The mocktails are quite poor and the cheque needs to bucks up with tickleing their customers taste buds!

The Ambiance of the place was good and so was the food (specially the starters and naan) However being a new place the service was not upto the mark.

The menu is very inspired from cafe 4/1(along with name of the items), however to my surprise its not from the same owner which is surprising

Located in 5th Floor of the same building that houses Club Boudoir as well as Fashion Big Bazar in Theatre Road,  this restaurant opened  its doors during last week only. Completely family oriented fine dine restaurant,  was completely amazed by the Ambience of this place. Service was quite good and staff were quite helpful and polite. We ordered the following items :-

1.Tomato Soup -  Taste was very good. Soup was accompanied with small bun and butter. 

2.Vegetable Cheese Cigar -  Quite good. Cigars filled with vegetable cheese and dipped tasted very good. 

3. Veg Au Gratin :- Of all the items,  we had this was quite a bit disappointment. But it wasn't bad either,  not up to expectation we had after having previous items. 

4 .Dahi  Paneer Tikka :- One of the best paneer items had in recent time.  Paneer was very fresh and crispy and flavours were bursting as soon as piece of this Tikka got in mouth. 

5. Apricot Malai Kofta :- New item. Was good and tasty. Flavour was very good and yes it was a bit sweet. 

6. Pindi Channa :- Very delicious. Yummy. Must try

7.Dal E Sesame :- Black Dal was good. Tasty and yet another dish to try for. 

8. Masala Kulcha &  Tandoori Roti :- Breads were crispy and Kulcha was filled with quite good amount of masala

9. Tutty Fruity :- Had much better in other places. It was OK. 

10. Lime Cheesecake :- Though the name was quite big,  this one is surely a bliss for dessert lovers. Must try. 

Overall experience was quite good. Food was delicious. Though a bit priced as compared to quantity,  this restaurant will surely reach among one of the best restaurants in kolkata

Sesame is a new fine dining restaurant located in the same building as club boudoir. Decor and ambiance wise it is mostly family oriented. The staff was very polite and courteous, but the service was a bit slow. We had finished nearly half our main course by the time our black Dal arrived. 
Apart from the above and that the portions were astoundingly small, there isn't room for complain. We had ordered the Aloo, paneer, kebab and babycorn for starters. The Indian starters were very good. For main course, we had ordered mushroom, 2 paneer dishes, aloo do piaza, Black Dal, and a variety of breads. I have to say, the paneer dishes were very impressive, especially the chef's special paneer. The potato was very average, and all other dishes were delicious. The cheese Nan and the garlic Nan were heavenly, but I would recommend to skip the Kabuli Nan. 
Overall pocket pinch was around 850/head without any desserts. And I would recommend it only for a 1 time visit, as the quantity served ultimately doesn't justify the price. That said, the taste of some of the aforementioned dishes is worth a try.
