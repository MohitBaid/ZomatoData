INTRO: On the last day of the Year 2017, we found 15% discount on all items of Pinchos and decided ordering from there. It was our first eating from Pinchos!

ITEMS ORDERED : Garlic Naan ; Mutton Rogan Josh

GARLIC NAAN:
The white naan with shredded sesame seeds was really soft as it should be; effortlessly chewable and tasted quite good.

MUTTON ROGAN JOSH:
A plate of this item comprises 4 pieces of mutton accompanied by a nalli(mutton pipeüòÇ).
The mutton tasted really impressive. I never actually had tasted the authentic Rogan Josh of Kashmir, but undoubtedly this tasted good to me.
Mutton pieces were too soft with hardly any presence of meat fat and nalli was awesome!
Plenty of gravy to soothe your taste buds.

OUTRO: Had the Naan been a bit bigger in size, it would have been great.
In order to completely satisfy your tummy you might require to have 2 Garlic Naan and 2pieces of Mutton Rogan Josh! 1 Naan can keep your tummy half hungry!

All over, I had a Good Impression of Pinchos!
Keep this consistency and people will be satisfied!

I just found it on the christmas eve while roaming around southern avenue in search for food. Beautiful decorations. We ordered creamy soup which tasted weird. Then i ordered mutton galouti kabab which is the specialty here. I dint like it much though but my partner liked it very much.. Will come back to try the biriyani. The stuff is very polite and the food is a bit expensive.

Ordered mutton biriyani from Pinchos today via zomato for lunch! Delivery took around 70 minutes. Service was poor.

Biriyani was ordinary. Quality & quantity were both average. It was okay, but there are far better options at the same price range. So an average rating 3.2/5

Pinchos - A great experience. 
=====
Location + Intro:

I have seen it many a times when visiting Lake Market as it's situated very near to lake market. The reason why i remember this place as the outlook of the place is quite nice and there is always a security guard standing outside the gate. Though, i got food delivered from here.

I was looking through swiggy app to scroll for food and somehow saw Pinchos was serving biriyani at INR 99 as there was some offer going on. I ordered for 2 Chicken Biriyani and costed me around INR 250 (including delivery charges) all inclusive. 
=====
What i had:

Chicken Biriyani - The Biriyani was properly packed and was abundant in quantity. They added a Chicken Piece, Egg as well as Potato. The Chicken was quite tender and the egg was properly boiled. The potato could have been a little more tender. The rice did fine but could have been a little more flavourful. The oil level was quite balanced and not too much. However, for such a price, i could not ask more. 
=====
Meal for two: A normal chicken Biriyani costs here around 180 bucks (as per their menu price). The cost for two would be around 400-600 approximate.  (Prices are subject to change due to macroeconomic factors such as inflation, etc.) 
=====
Summary: 

Taste 3.9/5

Quality 3.9/5

Quantity 4.1/5

VFM 4/5
=====
Conclusion:

The packaging done by them was quite nice. Hope to visit sometime.
=====
Unbiased review based on my eating experience.

We went for a lunch on Sunday.The restaurant was empty then started filling up. The good part was the decor.we had ordered for fish and chicken kababs, fish was good 3.5 on a scale of 5.However chicken Royal Bengal was a disaster.Lassoni murg was okay.The annoying part was the time taken for serving. We were told 15 mins but it's even more than 30 mins for a single dish, according to the staff the delay was due to take away and home delivery orders. I find it's a lame excuse. The lachha paratha was the worst part of the lunch.I am certainly not visiting for a second time.

For Food the place can score easily  a 4/5  , the CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA and CHICKEN BHARTA were absolutely spot on , the gravy of tikka masala was lipsmacking and not overloaded with excess oil unlike most places . The plain naan was another highlight , i haven't tasted such soft and fluffy flat bread without any butter or oil sprinkled on top ; i am sure the dough is made of a secret recipe.The starters ROYAL BENGAL PINCHOS and MURG MALAI PINCHOS were normal hariyali and reshmi kebabs , done decent , if not exceptional.  The firni was nice too.
Now the negetives , we we here for lunch , the chairs were kept in disorganised way , half the lights were off , gloomy interior was a turn off . Even on asking to turn on the lights , they did that for few minutes and agian turned them off. The service part had no issue though , food was served after an acceptable wait , hot and fresh. Music played is mostly old time  bollywood tracks. But somehow they need to work on  presentation and making the ambience better.

Recently ordered food from this place. The delivery was very quick, within 40 mins the food was delivered. I had ordered chicken biryani and murgh lababdar. The murgh lababdar was all creamy and the boneless pieces of chicken just melted in my mouth. It was delicious. The biryani was good, normal, nothing extraordinary as compared to the murgh lababdar. You should try the murgh lababdar if you go to this place. All in all it was a very good experience. I gave a 4 rating because I think the price that they take for the biryani, they can increase its quantity. Otherwise , food is very good and must try place.

This restuarant or kebab cafe as they say is situated in Southern Avenue. One can easily spot it as it is a roadside cafe. We went there during pujas and to our amazement we found place for us when everywhere there were long queues of people. 

A very beautiful cafe it is and the seating arrangements are really good with beautiful sofas and well lit it is. 
We have ordered for-

1) Murgh Malai Pincho ( A starter item. It tasted soo good. The chicken pieces were well charred and were covered with cheese. Served with salad and chutney)

2) Murgh Biryani ( It was really awesome in taste. After a long time I had some good biryani that too during pujas. It contained one "aloo" which is my favourite, one piece of succulent chicken and one egg. The rice was also aromatic and overall the biryani tasted perfect.)

3) Tandoori Roti ( It was also good like it needs to be)

4) Chicken Tikka Masala ( This dish was awesome. I totally loved it and the chicken pieces were also meaty and the gravy tasted yummy)

Service is prompt. Staffs are friendly, courteous and polite and they enquire also in between if everything is alright or not. Overall a satisfying experience and I am sure to drop there soon.

RECOMMENDED FOR ALL KEBAB LOVERS.

Visited this place yesterday with some friends. Liked the ambience. The biggest disappointment was the service. Had to ask for water several times. We ordered biriyani, naan, chicken tikka masala and mutton rogan josh. Here too the service failed us. Instead of three plates of biriyani they served us two, it was several minutes before the third plate of biriyani arrived. The chicken biriyani was bland but the side dishes tasted good, mutton was quite soft. Another disappointment was the quantity of the side dishes. Not sure if this was because of the festive rush, but expected the place to be better.

The place was absolutely empty except for us on independence day afternoon. The server was extremely helpful and courteous. They served complimentary papad on arrival. Coming to food,they are good only for the starters since the biryani was not upto the mark and portion too was too less. Galouti kebab could have been better but no complaints with royal Bengal pinchos and tempura fried prawns.

The decor is excellent..especially the door which is being adorned by colorful plates.The staffs are very polite and helpful.As far as food is concerned, we tried Muttn galouti kebab, fish pinchos, Chicken angaray and Royal chicken Pinchos ( dont remember the name exactly üòä)..For beverages we had shahi chai which is tea laced with kesar ...bit different but nice to sip and Berry tang ( usual stuff).Last but not the least ,we had firni which is a must have..Overall a nice place to hang out with your friends and family

Recommendation- It will be desirable if they can add few more items in their menu but most importantly whatever items are there in the menu should atleast be there otherwise the options become very limited .For example we wanted to have Prawn salsa which they didnt have and as for firni ..we wanted to order for seven but they could give us 6 .Nonetheless, we enjoyed our evening immensely.Thank you Pinchos!!

The newly opened Kebab Cafe, one of its name located near Lake Market Area came to our rescue when we were feeling very hungry in between shopping sessions. The place is big, ambience is decent and the curation of the menu is really unique. On the doors, painted plates have been put up which looks really nice. We had ordered - 
Galawati Kebab - Six in one portion served with Kesari Paratha, the kebabs were so good and it melted in the mouth. Recommended to try! 
Fish Pinchos - Suggested by their house staff, this dish was very good. Fish kebabs in a fusion Indo-Continental seasoning. Went very well with the spicy onion rings. 
Bakarkhani - Not the typical Bakarkhani. It's more like a flaky paratha. Even the staffs were confused between calling it Bakarkhani or Paratha. Tasted good but didn't live upto the name. They should alter the naming. 
Firni - This was Kesari Firni. Yellowish in texture, not to flowy or rigid. Liked this one a lot. Must try at Pinchos. 
Overall experience was good. Hospitality was excellent. Staffs were friendly and prompt. They also give a 10% YupCard discount if you're a member. Recommended to visit. Happy Dining! :)

Oh my god!!!!  
Being a foodie this was nothing less than bliss. Everything is perfect,the decor, the ambience, the food, the service, and most importantly compared to the quantity and quality of food, it's damn reasonable.
Mainly I went to this place to try Haleem, had to travel a long way from my place, and am glad that I did so. 
On reaching, I was greeted,the staff was super decent and cooperative.  They suggested with their best dishes. Coming to the food, I tried two types of kebab   which was served with special kesari paratha..the paratha looks super cute and the taste is even better. Kebabs are bound to bring Satisfaction to the tastebuds. Then came this special Haleem, with malabari paratha. Pinchos has surely mastered to serve the best paratha in town, Haleem was good enough. Lastly, comes the firni, though am not that fond of desert, but am happy that I made an exception this time.
Overall, Thank you Pinchos for making me and my tummy fully satisfied. 
I am definitely going to visit again and again and again.

Ambience : The warm lighting,the amazing lampshades and the super cozy seating gives you no point to complain about.
Staffs : Trust me when I say I've never come across a staff sweeter than each of the Pinchos people ! So well mannered and perfectly informative.
Food : We ordered the
1) ROYAL BENGAL PINCHO - This dish contains 8 succulent pieces of chicken grilled with a green marinade but tastes quite different than the regular hariyali kebabs.This dish comes with 6 cute li'l kesari paranthas,a green chutney,baby onions and a minty-mayo dip.A must try.
2)CHICKEN BIRYANI - The biryani has one boiled egg,one perfectly spiced tender piece of potato and a decent piece of chicken.The rice had a very unique aroma.One of the best biryani that this town offers.Brownie points for the raita that it was served with.
3)Papad - This was a complementary dish & was really crisp and yum.
4)MOCK CHAMPAGNE : An amazing blend of soda,pomegranate and orange juice topped with crushed cinnamon.
 
Overall,from every aspect,PINCHOS is the perfect synonym of PERFECTION in the gastronomical dictionary.

Edit:
After posting my original review, Pinchos sent me a complimentary plate of haleem. Not only that, I got a call today from them asking about the taste and apologising for the earlier delivery. I must say, the second time around, the taste and texture of the haleem was much better and the mutton pieces were rightly done as well. Am impressed by their courteousness and attention to service and I hope their food equals their standards of service. Their improved service has compelled me to give them a better rating :)

Old review:

I got two plates of mutton haleem home delivered. The reason I'm rating the place something (1.5) because the delivery was prompt. However, the haleem tasted nothing like haleem. Clearly, the chef has never tasted haleem and has no idea what it is like or supposed to be. Plus the mutton pieces were all wrongly chopped (there aren't supposed to be chunky bony pieces in the first place) and were mostly bones. Whatever little flesh was there, was undercooked. The place has to change its source of purchase for mutton and also get its chef a recipe for haleem. Should have stuck to the known names for haleem, lesson learnt.

Ordered Haleem and Mutton Seekh Kabab (order no. 27151813). Instead of haleem, Pinchos delivered loose running dal (lentils) with pieces of mutton with bones. If you do not even know what a dish is, and how it should be prepared, why are you in this business? Besides you did not describe on the online menu that you would serve Dal instead of Haleem... Complete waste of dinner (money notwithstanding).

Visited the place last week with a Kebab loving friend.. It was not very easy to locate..Google maps came to rescue...it's close to Adi Lake Palli ( near Lake Mall)...nice classy decor with great ambiance..service is too good and the staff were very polite and helpful..we ordered cold coffee (‚Çπ 110) Peshawari Seekh Kebab (‚Çπ 210), Nawabi Seekh Kebab (‚Çπ 190)..ohh I forgot to mention before serving the food they gave us papads as complementary food...we really enjoyed our food..It was quite good... between both the Kebabs I will prefer the Peshawari one the most...The prices are reasonable and they didn't add any service tax or Vat..They had made sure that we liked the food and asked about our feedbacks... overall we quite like the place and the food..

P.S A special thanks to their friendly staff who literally lit all the extra lights just to take good pics of us infront of the uniquely decored door..

Very friendly ambience, perfect for family outing. We ordered Galouti kebab, chicken malai tikka , fish pinchos, mutton biryani, Shahi tukra, and hot gulab jamun. All item were excellent. Chicken and mutton pieces just melted in mouth. Galouti kabab was awesome made mince goat and Raw papaya traditionally used to tenderize the meat mix with herbs, spices with smoky smells. Desserts were well balanced on sweetness and delectable. Will try other item on another day.

Kolkata‚Äôs first Kebab Caf√©, that‚Äôs how they like to brand themselves.. Located close to Lake Mall in Bompass Road, you can also reach this place from Sarat Bose Road side by taking the lane beside Mandarin.. This place serves an interesting array of Kebabs and North Indian dishes with a contemporary twist alongwith a casual caf√© settings, primarily to attract the Gen Y for long chat sessions over some interesting dishes.. The ambience is quite classy and the d√©cor is extremely well done.. Most of the tables provide a plug-point to charge your phone while sipping their coolers or forking through the kebabs.. The entrance door itself is uniquely decorated with painted plates, wall finished with textured paints and warm, extensive couches to help you spend long hours in a comfortable setting..
Coming to service, one USP of this place is that the majority of the Servers and even the Manager are Female, something shouldn‚Äôt be rare but actually is in Kolkata, indeed commendable.. Service was spot on, servers seemed quite professional, courteous and competent even though the food took longer than expected to arrive.. They served complementary Roasted Papads and Achar to add to your delight..
Royal Bengal Pincho: House special Chicken Kebab served with miniature Zafrani Parathas.. The kebab was soft and succulent but somewhat lacked the smokiness.. The parathas were a bit stiff to our liking..
Tempura Prawn with Salsa: The prawns were well-cooked.. Crisp and crunchy without any extra oil.. Also I liked the fact that the batter was thin and never over-powered the flavors of the prawns.. Salsa was a total disappointment and lacked any concrete taste..
Fish Pincho: Fish tikka kebab which failed to satisfy our palate.. One can find hundred other better fish kebabs in Kolkata, what‚Äôs the point in having it here when it fails to add a new dimension or even plate up the conventional dish to perfection.. Even the spice didn‚Äôt seem to blend properly..
Overall, I felt this place promised a lot, but somehow fails to impress based solely on the taste aspect.. The set-up is grand, location is strategic, they only need to work more on their dishes.. Plus they need to add a bit more variety to their menus and include few more starters and Chinese mains to suit the needs of a Caf√©.. Our total cheque was Rs. 780/- (all incl.) and they don‚Äôt include any extra VAT..

Visited here few weeks back. 
The place is very well done! 
A good amount has been spent on the interiors as well as the staff. They seemed quite professional. But that's the paradox most restaurants are suffering that all this just doesn't reflect in the food.
Nothing different , very basic and average. Quality was okay. The galaouti was more like a tikka , it lacked the tenderness of the galaouti which takes away the usp of the dish.  
Cold coffee was decent.....the  chicken buna just seemed effort less and plain.....low on salt ....and very high on keora essence.....i had it along with Malabar paratha.....i was quite shocked that half way through  I felt bloated....the parantha went dry and was breaking down like patty..... 
The shahi tukda was soggy but the taste was nice.
Over all this 3 is for the ambience and courteous staff. But the food here needs a major push because the prices are less but the quality isn't worth the price.

Its a newly opened cafe near lake mall who serves mocktails and kebabs in contemporary way.Its actually a kebab cafe.
Ambience was awesome.Loved their decor.You will love the interior design of this place.
Staffs were friendly and attentive.
Now coming to food part I had smoky chicken skewers,Royal Bengal pinchos,coral punch and orange and strawberry Julius.
Mocktails were great and very much refreshing in this scorching heat.
But sadly inspite of being a kebab cafe their kebabs were not upto the mark.Royal Bengal pincho tasted pathetic.Skewers were rubbery.Chicken pieces were not at all soft.They lacked juicyness.
Overall do visit this place if you want to have a long conversation with ur loved one.Jst hv their mocktails and do long chats because their kebabs are not at all worth mentioning.

Visited on 30.4.2017 with my wife. Had ordered mutton biriyani. ¬†Food is terribly overpriced, quantity not at all sufficient with a very very small piece of mutton (mostly fat and bone. hardly any meat on it). In fact 4 people left, after they saw the quantity of biriyani that was served to us.

The delivery was before the scheduled time and without any calls, and that by itself is excellent by Calcutta standards.  We had ordered two of their signature dishes - the Royal Bengal Pincho which had a nice, distinctive flavour, and Mutton Galauti which was also good enough. Very satisfying experience - will order again!

It's new food joint specialist in kebabs, a cafe cum restaurant serving mughlai dishes ... The outside and inside of the restaurant is very classy ... The interior and designes are really something different and the sofas and seating area is arranged in nice manner to make u feel cozy, comfortable and to be in an adda mood ... Now coming to food: we ordered for Zafrani chai, Nawabi Sheekh Kebab and Mutton Galouti ... Zafrani Chai was so so ... Mutton Galouti kebab was served with small individual kesari flavoured parathas ... The kebab was really nice, juicy from inside, well cooked, with smell of ghee and less spicy and lite ... But the parathas served with them was of good taste but very hard to cut with knife and also little hard to chew ... Overall ur taste buds with enjoy the kebab ... Now coming to Nawabi Sheekh kebab, very good in taste, medium spicy, well cooked properly minced chicken, and the outside coating of the kebab was brown in color which i liked ... The presentation of the dishes were really nice and mouth watering ... Behaviour of the restaurant personals was very nice and also they suggested us what to taste and after having food asked for feedback ... Now the best part is there is no VAT and service charge, so ur pocket will dance in joy and u can enjoy the food ... Overall the restaurant cum cafe concept is good ... Will visit again

My wife is a finicky eater. We took away the Malai Kebab and the Chicken Aangarey. She purred through them and made big round eyes at me. Then she nibbled from my portion. Rare. Then she recounted a kebab experience in Lucknow. Best Kebabs in town, she said.

A very well decorated newly opened cafe/restaurant at lake market. I was really very impressed with the decor and ambience. The music was a little faulty. But that's fine. 
Coming to the food the place is quite pocket friendly. We had ordered for:
Mock sangria- though the presentation was very good, the taste did not stand out. It was neither sweet nor tangy. I don't know what it was basically. 
Galauti kebab- good! Worth a try. 
Tempura prawns: again really nice. A little more seasoning would have made it better. 
A fish kebab(the name of which i forgot) - the best according to me. Soft succulent pieces of fish which very perfectly spiced. 
Begum burger-basically the patty made out of kebab stuffings. I thought it was pretty small and oily. Though a very new and innovative take on burgers. 
With a little a improvisation on the food part can make this place stand out among all others. 
A special mention for the staffs who were extremely good and courteous. They helped us out with the menu a lot. 
Thumbs up!! üëç

I've been here with my best friend,, we both are ultimate foodies.. Being a Foodie we always keep experiencing new places to taste their menu.. Pinchos is a place which we found in zomato and we went there and came back with an amazing experience.. Its a cafe cum restaurant which is decorated in a very beautiful decor.. Each table has a socket for charging your cell phones.. Seats are very catchy.. Staffs are very helpful and well behaved.. And their food really tastes awesome.. The place is affordable enough and if you want to spend a nice time with similarly good food then please do visit Pinchos once.. I will surely visit again ‚ò∫

All in all, an excellent location to  taste awesome good and also be in a comforting and pleasant atmosphere.

We ordered for a home delivery and we were not impressed. The Galauti kebab was nice, but the mini paratha was very oily. The Mutton Korma was greasy and the pieces were tough. The Bhuna Chicken was satisfactory.
The Firni was a complete disaster. Tasteless, to say the least.

Launch Event of Pinchos, a Kebab cafe-cum-restaurant ‚ò∫

Date: 22 Apr 2017

Situated on the ground floor of the lane adjacent to the Southern Avenue Swimming Pool (right lane if you are coming from the Golpark Crossing), Pinchos, the Kebab cafe-cum-restaurant, first and foremost strikes you as an interesting place, resplendent with the assorted elements of interior designing, making good and intelligent use of all corners, pillars, as well as the entry door!

This 36 seater outlet has the inside of it's main door adorned with hand painted circular artworks, thereby making it a cool selfie backdrop! Differently designed 3D wallpapers and Mughal style overhead lights provide the respective jazz and beauty to the place. Three types of seating arrangements are available - sofa chairs, velvet high sofas and quality leather sofas.

A soothing instrumental music plays in the background. A mute but on TV adorns one of the walls. Loo facility is also available.

On the outside, there is a takeaway counter on the left of the entry door. Home delivery service is also available.

Co-owned by the partner duo of the food truck  'thank god it's fresh', Pinchos food menu boasts of around 17 types of Kebabs, which are also served as fusion food in conjunction with burgers, sandwiches and submarines. 

The glamour quotient of the launch event was well taken care of, by the invited guest Koneenica Banerjee, one of the leading Tollywood actors. She was made to sit on a comfortable leather sofa, with the table in front laden with assorted and well plated non vegetarian delicacies. With a constant smile on her face and poised body language, she was professional enough to handle the camera clicks and queries of media personalities.

Coming to the food part, being a vegetarian, I refrained from tasting the non veg food display. However, a fixed menu comprising of freshly prepared welcome drink, biryani, kebab/tikka and dessert was served to all the invited guests, in both veg and non veg options. 

My food servings comprised of -

- Lady In Pink Mocktail: Hued in pink, it was an average soda based drink. Other similar mocktails, albeit differently colored, were also in rotation.

- Veg Biryani: A plateful of this slightly flavored rice dish, adorned with three roundels of raw onion placed on one side, was served in a white ceramic dish. Scantily infused with well cooked and spiced veggies like carrot, beans and cauliflower, and dry fruits like raisins and even one dried plum, the Biryani was well cooked and moist. It was filling and tasted very nice.

- Paneer Tikka: Accompanied with some green chutney, salad juliennes, green chilly and a slice of lime, four portions of generously marinated, well grilled and still relatively soft in texture cottage cheese squares were served, along with the customary snuck-in-between onion and capsicum chunks. The aforesaid veggies were well grilled and still maintained their crunch. The whole dish tasted excellent.

- Gulab Jamun: Two hot and fresh portions of syrupy Gulab Jamuns were served at the end. They were soft and tasted nice. However, their sugar quotient was a tad bit high for my taste. But that is a personal observation. It may have gone down well with the others.

Enough well dressed staff, both male and female, were around to put the guests at ease and cater to their dining needs.

This newly opened cafe has great potential and hopefully be successful very soon.
It was our first visit yesterday. The concept of kebabs in a cafe atmosphere seemed so attractive.
We ordered the following:
Galouti kebab: This minced mutton kebab is one of the most famous kebabs and preparing it with it's ideal taste is not so easy. But they nailed it.
Angaarey kebab: The spices of this kebab are different from the conventional tikka or reshmi kebabs.
Begum burger: This had a mutton patty in it, which was tasty and juicy. Even the fries were good.
The Kesari Paranthas served with them just impressed us. The whole idea was innovative.
DECOR: you will love it. It is way beyond average. Somehow, it has managed to fuse the feels of a cafe and a North Indian restro together. (Note the cutlery)
Service: Honestly, nowadays when the cafes pour out the water for their customers it surprises us. The service is very polite and courteous.
I am surely going to visit there again. Other items on the menu deserve to be tasted as well.

If you love Kebabs and want to try them at any time day then Pinchos is the place for you. The recently opened restaurant offers mouth-watering kebabs and delicious Biryani. But, the stand-out dish for me would be the Begum Burger. The stunning decor of the place is an added attraction. All kebab lovers should visit this once to experience great food in a grand ambiance.

Last weekend, I went to this great newly opened restaurant called Pinchos. The food was amazing. The ambiance¬†of the place is exquisite, a perfect blend of traditional and contemporary elements. The highlight of the decor is the 'Selfie Point' behind the door with a beautiful background. The restaurant offers seventeen types of kebabs to meet your hunger for Kebabs. Although, my favourite would be the Biryani. The kebabs melted in the mouth. If you are a kebab person and want to try out different types of tasty kebabs at any time of the day then this cafe is the right¬†place for you. Pinchos is Kolkata's new kebab haven.

Breaking the myth of the westernised cafes', Pinchos is a great destination to enjoy desi cuisine in a lively atmosphere all times of the day. The begum burger and the biryani topped my lists. The kebab platter was worth the name-they are called the kebab cafe'. With innovative fusions of traditional recipes with new flavours, Pinchos is a neighbourhood revelation! I thoroughly enjoyed the Zafrani tea inspite of the heat. Another quirky part of the restaurant is the Selfie point behind the door where wew njoyed clicking away! Looking forward to more fun here...
