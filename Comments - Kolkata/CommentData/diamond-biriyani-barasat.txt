Also dis the the worst biryni centre near of my house..... location is near belghria-birati auto shop......very small centre...biryni is not good nd fresh..the chicken chap is sour in taste which is bad in smell.......

Easy access and quick service. Placed near to the railway station of Belgharia, it houses delicious biryani which tastes really different. It has a poor ambience but yes, if you are hungry, short on your budget and/or have a craze for biryani, then you should definitely try this out.
