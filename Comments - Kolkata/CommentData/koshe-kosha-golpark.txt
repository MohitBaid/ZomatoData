Just off the main road at Golpark, Koshe Kosha is an absolute delight for all the Bengali cuisine enthusiasts. A cozy two-storeyed restaurant decked with traditional bengali interior deco inspired from bengal's rich rural settings, Koshe Kosha presents a look which you became familiar with from the works of treasure in Bengali literature. The best thing about this place was perhaps the staff behaviour - they were polite and impeccable. Perhaps in the restaurants of the higher echelon where good food is no less than guaranteed, staff behaviour is the factor that sets them apart, and this place definitely comes out with flying colours in that department. Now the previous statement itself suggests that the food was great....it truly was amazing. We had ordered luchi and kosha mangsho with nolen gurer ice-cream as dessert. Only a true bengali foodie will ever understand the absolute joy and inner peace one can gain with good luchis - and this place hit this right in the bull's eye! The kosha mangsho was totally grand as well with a rich, lovely flavour that went so well with the luchis. And the ice-cream is a must try for all who visit. Overall a wonderful experience and definitely recommended for everyone.

I would love to visit this place again and again .
I will never stop myself for being into such a place .
If you are crazy for bengali food then it's a must visit place.
We ordered roti, pulao and chicken kosha. I ended up with licking my hand in the end. The best thing is they don't serve spoon and allow us to have the food with our hand as bengali does.

It has Awesome food quality, quantity is sufficient for 2. Must try Chitol peti & Basanti Polau. Mutton quality is good, soft & tasty. The aam doi was not so good the last time I tested.

Visited the place once and ordered some food another day. The ambiance was pretty good. We were given a table for two. I was really disappointed as the table wasn't clean and the table mat had leftover food which was really disgusting. We told the staff and they apologized but the service was slow. We waited for fifteen minutes. People kept walking by and finally when we were about to leave the mat was finally cleaned. We ordered for basanti polao and mutton kosha. The food was good but the service was slow. We wanted to order more food but the service was slow so we ate that and ordered the bill. We left disappointed. @

We had a horrible experience on their 10 year anniversary, when despite prior ordering, my father was asked to wait outside in line for nearly two hours only to receive cold and soggy food which had already been packed and kept for the last two hours.¬†

We wrote our grievance to the management, and Team Koshe Kosha offered us a complimentary Dinner.

As the bad must be critiqued, the good must be praised.¬†

The complimentary dinner served to us, was mind-blowing. The staff was amicable and took care of our food preferences.¬† 'Ghondhoraj Ghol'¬† was served with Fish Fry as starters, the quality and taste of which was amazing.

We were asked to choose from their menu our preference of main course. Kosha Mangsho, Pulao, Bhetki Paturi, Ghondoraj Mutton, Alu Dum, Echor Chingri were not only tasty but of exteremly good quality.

The Gondhoraj Mutton, which the manager specially got made for us, is a very unique and light preparation of Mutton which is a must try.

Echor er Chingri was fabulous, while Alu Dum made with cocunut was sumptious.

Bhetki Paturi and Kosha Mangsho no doubt, being their speciality was excellent.

They topped their excellent hospitality with serving us Daab Ice Cream and Nolen Gurer Ice Cream as dessert.

We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and their hospitality. It was indeed a 'True Koshe Kosha' Experience.

Special thanks to Mr. Rahul, the manager of the restaurant who personally overlooked our dinner and took into consideration our choices and palette before serving any dish.Keep up the good work guys! Hope to visit you guys soon.¬†:)

I simply loved the authencity of the place. No unwanted improvisation but simply sticking to the correct way of cooking. The place may not be huge but the food and ambience more than makes up for the place. We ordered 2 different Mutton dishes along with Pulao and i must say it was finger licking tasty. My friends from US had just dropped into Calcutta just to try some authentic Bengali Food and now they are serriously considering to visit again before they fly back. Just one suggesttion,pls maintain a tool for toddlers. It goes a long way to visit a place with infants. Overall we loved the food and the service.

Situated on the lane beside Mouchak adjacent to other food joints like Aminia, Tinny da Dhaba etc, this place has it's own karizma. For a place serving typical authentic Bengali delicacies this outlet is forever buzzing. With time the taste might have dropped off a bit in my opinion. Only certain dishes that I don't like here. I have been to other places offering Bengali food but eating here has a homely feel to it. Service is commendable and staff are very very courteous. The interiors are very simple and reminds us of our roots. I would love to see new items on the menu. Would be visiting again, soon.

We started with gondhoraj ghol which was so tasty.It had the perfect blend of doi and gondhoraj flavour.this is a must try.then we had bhetki fry which was also again very good.then we had jeera rice,kosha mangso,gondhoraj murgi and ilish pathuri.Together if you ask me,all very perfect.They actually made you feel the bengali heritage.
The service-oh my god,they were so good.They were always at our beck and call.We also had dab ice cream which was again a must try.

I went to this restaurant when I was in Kolkata this September for Durga Puja. Every decent restaurant and eatery was swarming with people. That's the normal scene is Kolkata during Puja. I was with mom and dad and we had Elish Bhapa, kosha mangsho, macher kalia and pulao. Every dish and preparation was delectable. The ambience has a big scope for improvement at least at this specific location. The food compensated for everything else and we were happy. That's what matters.

Location-4/5
Just second structure in the lane opposite to Golpark Mouchak
Food-4/5
Decent in taste. We ordered:
Starters:

Dim Chingrir Devil-was like roadside dimer chop. My mom makes egg devils with cheese and stuffs it with the boiled yolk and mayo mixture, while wrapping the boiled albumin in cheese and bread crumbs and egg wash, frying it in nutmeg butter. So the taste here, failed me. The stuffing had potato and shell of a shrimp. I was expecting more shrimps too.

Chicken Kabiraji-was huge in quantity. Decent taste

Main course:

We were so full after the sumptuous kabiraji, we couldn't order much. We went for :

Basanti Pulao- There were no dry fruits or ghee

Mocha Chingri-Not bad

Dessert-Tender coconut icecream (was just vanilla ice cream, churned with some desiccated coconut)

Price-1335 for 3

Ordered 6 non-veg Thali for home delivery. Had a bad experience with the fish given in the Thali. However, on complaining, immediate action was taken by the restaurant manager and all the plates of fish were replaced with good ones within an hour. They were very polite and were regretful for their accidental mistake. Thanks Koshe Kosha.

I wanted to try Koshe Kosha for a longbtime. So finally went to the golpark outlet. Once entering inside, the decor looked very much ethnic giving full justice to its name. I ordered rice, mutton jhol, fish kabiraji, roti and fresh lime soda (sweet). The soda was a bit too sweet for my liking. The fish kabiraji though was good. The mutton jhol was very simple as the name suggests. The quantity of rice was good enough and the roti was sort of ok-ish. With gst in action now, i think it was a little bit expensive if compared to the food served. Nothing extra-ordinary but not bad also. Service was ok-ish kind off.

Worst Bengali food experience in my life. And being a Bengali I feel ashamed that they are bragging that they can cook Bengali food. Brought vetki r paturi and the fish was half burnt. Whether it's a fish or something else couldn't be recognized. Total waste of money. And highly expensive. If u really want to experience good authentic Bengali food please go to bhojohari manna or sudhipa r ranna ghor. Their food is far far far better than koshe kosha. And also the sitting arrangement at golpark is very poor and clumsy. Worst food experience.

We went there when there was an offer going on...All items were between 99/- -- 149/- but when we finally reached there, already a very big queue was there waiting for getting in for having lunch. It was almost 4pm and they said that we had to wait till 5-5:30 pm for getting in. So we decided to take parcel and entered. First thing which I noticed that place is very small , not sufficient sitting arrangement are there which should be .Anyways we ordered for some dishes and waited a long. It came after half n hour and the prices were not 99 or 149 .. It came included with tax which finally resulted to 200-300 and if talking about food, food was ok type.. Not up to the mark..but their baked rasogolla was the best

The rice they served did  not seem to be freshly cooked. It was hot but felt a bit dry and little hard. However their staff and service both were good. Not much spacious.

I've heard a lot about Koshe Kosha frok friends and family ,so thought of giving it a try. We went there on Durga Puja Dashami for lunch. We had a waiting time for about 45-50 minutes and finally got a table for three at 5pm!

The decor inside is good, but the ceiling in the upstairs is pretty low and troublesome for tall people. The staffs were attentive in spite of the rush in the restaurant.

We ordered Bhetki Fry (which tasted awesome), Rice, Dal, Alo Bhaja, Pabda Mach, Masala Chicken, Dhakai Mangsho (Mutton) and Sprite. I was really hopeful about this restaurant after hearing all the good reviews of other Koshe Kosha outlets but my actual experience was very disappointing. The Sprite was literally like Sweet_Water without any 'jhhaaj', as if the bottle had been opened long time back. We requested for replacement, later on the staff said it won't be available. Other than the Mutton, everything else was not at all hot. Yes, we were served cold food. The Pabda Mach was so much fried that it became hard and was difficult to separate from the fish_bone.

I'll definitely try the other outlets, and try to ignore the preconceived notion that i already have! May be this experience was because of the Puja Rush, but bad service to this extent is not acceptable at all whatever the reason may be.

We ordered Basanti pulao, kosha magsho and kacha longka murgi. We requested for home delivery but since there was a huge rush on Ashtami, they requested us to come and pick up the food , which we did. But as soon as we reached home and opened the food, they smelled awful. The pulao was not fresh and it had a awful smell. The mutton used in kosha magsho also did not tasted good. I am never ever going to order from this restaurant. And if there was a rating in minus, I would have opted for that.

When we enter that place we saw they have only one Puja special menu which was not at all special we didn't found anything special on that menu. We were really hungry so we placed our order.
we ordered Basanti pulao chanar Dalna kacha lonkar mangsho. All the dishes were bogus not at all tasty completely tasteless. I don't want to say anything more regarding that place.

This is my 3rd visit at koshe kosha outlet and first visit at Golpark outlet. I was obsessed with their food  because of my previous two outstanding visits at their different outlets. 
But this time, to be very frank I m disappointed and this is the lowest rating from my side for one of my favourite Bengali restaurant.
The decoration was okaish. Not very fancy like the park Street outlet. The ceiling is very low for upper seating area (can be a problem for tall people). Decoration could be much better.
We ordered 5 plate of Basanti polao, 3 plate of bhetki paturi and 2 plate of Gandharaj murgi (because the same Gandharaj murgi tasted like heaven at their hatibagan outlet).
This time, I quite liked their serving bowls and expected too much.
We had to wait long for the food getting served.
The polao tasted okayish (as compared to parkstreet & Hatibagan outlet).
Bhetki paturi was too spicy. (It took the maximum time and arrived after we finished the polao and chicken, the waiter explained that the cook by mistake made a wrong bhetki dish)
Gandharaj murgi didn't taste like heaven üôÅ (it was okay as a chicken dish, but I didn't get any flavour of Gandharaj).
Staffs were also okayish.(we mislaid by a waiter, initially we were about to order 6 plate of polao then he suggested we should take 4, and at the end the polao was short in quantity, he was also very uninterested to serve Gandharaj murgi)
Whatever, I expected too much at this time and it wasn't up to mark. I am disappointed by their overall presentation.

I won't visit this branch again. (Their best branches are Parkstreet and Hatibagan)

We have visited this outlet many times but this time the experience was worst. We ordered rice, basanti pulav, dal, alu bhaja, parse macher jhal, kankrar jhal, katla kaliya, bhetki macher paturi and kochi pathar jhol. Parse fish was pathetic. I could feel sand like something in it. The fish was skinny and no flesh at all. Katla piece was only bone. I refused to take it and they returned. In mutton only bones were there. When we complained manager didn't acknowledge it properly. I will never ever go there again.

Long wish to taste Bengali food from this place suddenly got fulfilled today, when 4 friends of us decided to give this place a chance to satisfy our taste buds.

Location - Just opposite to Golpark Aminia

We entered around 8.30p.m and to our surprise it was quiet and empty (considering the weekend and puja shopping going on full fledgedly). We got our seat easily upstairs.

We ordered 3 plain rice, one Sona moog dal, alu bhaja, chanar dalna, gondhoraj murgi, moshla murgi and daab ice cream.

The Sona moog dal, and chanar dalna were really really good and totally worth paying the money üí∞..

However, the gondhoraj murgi was nothing special. To be frank I did not like it (at least not with plain rice). The moshla murgi was little spicy but nothing special to talk about. The Ice Cream was okayish with a little innovative touch and I liked it..

So overall my experience here today was quite average but this eatery can definitely be tried at least once.

We have visited this outlet many times but this time the experience was worst. We ordered rice, basanti pulav, dal, alu bhaja, parse macher jhal, kankrar jhal, katla kaliya, bhetki macher paturi and kochi pathar jhol. Parse fish was pathetic. I could feel sand like something in it. The fish was skinny and no flesh at all. Katla piece was only bone. I refused to take it and they returned. In mutton only bones were there. When we complained manager didn't acknowledge it properly. I will never ever go there again.

After a lot of search for Bengali food last night, we settled for Kodhe Kosha, the one being the most trendiest. Let me be very clear. The ambience is very nice. It will give you a Bengal rural feeling. But the space is not mich big. Coming to the food, we ordered Fish Kabiraji. It tasted awesome. Next we ordered Bsanati Pulao with Kochi Pathar Jhol (Tender Mutton) and Gandhoraj Chicken. All those items were average but nothing exceptional. To sum up, my experience was a sort of less than my expectation.

Being a Bengali I seldom go out to try out the Bengali cuisine. Yet after a very long time, tried out this restaurant known for its authentic Bengali food. The decor is really sweet, and gives you a feel like we've come to a little Bengali village. The ambience was decent though the place smelled weird when we first entered. The service was good but just a little slow. Coming to the food - we had plain rice, Sona moong dal, Aloo bhaja, jhinge alu posto & Bhetki Paturi. The food truly was delicious. My complain would be that it was quite oily, especially the posto. The bhetki was really fresh. Overall tasted good and for the first time enjoyed the Bengali cuisine outside home. Also the pocket pinch isnt too high. It's perfectly reasonable. Next time you wanna take a break from cooking at home, drop in to try some authentic Bengali food. 

Food : 3.5/5
Ambience : 3/5
Staff : 3/5

Location: located at the lane beside Mouchak.
Ambience & decor: 7/10 to the decor of this outlet. Though the chairs need to be changed asap. The floor at The sitting arrangement upstairs is too cranky.
Food: ordered fish Kobiraji, Basanti Pulao & Gondhoraj Murgi. The Kobiraji is a must try. The Basanti pulao they served was Just Perfect üëå. The Gondhoraj Murgi, as the name suggests had the taste of gondhoraj lebu. It consisted of 4 pieces of chicken which was perfectly cooked. Loved the gravy. A total 10/10 for the taste & quality of food.
Price: moderately Priced.
Staff: They were cordial & very Informative as well. 

Surely going to tick off all they have in their menu.

This place is famous for the bengali cuisine. The ambience is very different - theme of a typical village side bengali hut. Coming to the food, we ordered Jire Bhat, Sona Muger Dal, Alu Bhaja, Moshla Murgi, Kochi Pathar Jhol, Kosha Mangsho and Dab Ice Cream as dessert. All the dishes tasted good except the Moshla Murgi - it was tasteless. The Dab Ice Cream was too sweet - average in taste. Overall it was not a very good experience for me.

It's located just opposite of aminia in golpark.... A small place of good ambience.... We ordered Basanti pulao and masala murgi.... Pulao was good.....both quality and quantity..... Bt murgi was a bit costly.... BT taste was good.... The tax is also a bit high.... They should atlst reduce the tax.... Otherwise it's a good experience at a hungry afternoon....

Went there on the last day of their 10th anniversary special offer period...Rs99 n 149 menu looked too good to miss out..Located opposite to Aminia...This one's a bengali restaurant..

Many items were missing...but we can get that...the rushhhhh....
But if you are providing such offer...you should be well prepared for the rush as well...the waiter was asking us to hurry up n order...which was not polite at all...but that can be forgiven given the super rushhhh....

Coming to food we ordered...Basanti Pulao...Kosha Mangsho...Bhetki Paturi...Kosha Murgi...Baked Roshogolla...Gondhoraj Chicken

Basanti Pulao-- Light yellow kaju kismis pulao...Taste was quite good...

Kosha Mangsho-- Not as good as expected...the garvy was yummy but pieces were not so soft...maybe due to the rush..don't know...

Bhetki Paturi-- This was fine...no complaints...:)

Kosha Murgi --  This was very good...4 good pieces of chicken in a very tasty gravy...

Gondhoraj Chicken-- This did not taste good...kosha murgi was far better than this one...

Baked Roshogolla-- This was the best item...Stole the show for sure...The perfect end to a bengali lunch...

Overall a tasty experience...:)

Situated at a very attractive place this restaurant never seemed to attract much of customers.. It's been a couple of years that I am hearing that it's cook has been hired from the famous golbari and the kosha mangsho that's available here is just delicious.. So on the auspicious occasion of the 10th anniversary of Koshe Kosha we planned to pay it a visit.. The ambience was like any other Bengali restro very cosy and welcoming.. The staff were cordial enough.. we went for plain rice, gondhoraj chicken, crab curry and "the famous kosha mangsho ".... within a few minutes we were licking our hands out as the food tasted so wonderful.. the chicken had the mild flavour of gondhoraj and the crab tasted exactly like my favourite dish chingrir malaikari.. And the kosha mangsho was soft and perfectly cooked.. So all out there who want to spend their weekends at a Bengali restaurant must give this a try!

Worst restro experience in my life. Yesterday i visited here with my two friends for lunch. First when we enter they asked us to wait outside as no table is vacant but after us other 3 people came and they got a table. Then we wait for more than an hour outside then they call us and when we enter they ask us to sat on the table where already 2 other people were eating their meal. In one word word they ask us to share the table with other unknown persons. Then i call a waiter and told him to gave us a personal table but the waiter rudely replied that they can't provide us any other table, if we want to eat like this then eat otherwise you can go. How bad they can behave i have seen yesterday. I will never ever visit koshe kosha again.

I have visited this renowned Bengali restaurant quite a number of times before since it's near my school and never had any complaints against it. But the offer they had introduced recently from 28-30th August, I have had a terrible experience which I would like to share.
They had launched a special menu for the offer where they provided dishes at 99 and 149. I went with a few friends for lunch and we got a table around 12.30. We had already planned what all to order. We wanted to order something from the starters menu when the waiter promptly mentioned that only Bhetki fry is available and nothing else among the starters. I have never had Chital Maacher Muitha so wanted to order that but unfortunately it was out of stock. We had to order the ordinary Dhakai Mangsho and Moshla Murgi and Basanti Pulao. Most of the items were out of stock among the main course as well. After our meal we ordered Daab ice-cream and Nolen Gur er ice-cream but to our utmost disappointment they were also unavailable. The waiter mentioned that only aam doi and baked rosogolla are available. We decided not to order any dessert and asked for the bill. But what followed was a total disgrace to the management.
While we were paying our bill we heard a waiter shouting out to another inside the kitchen to serve 3 daab ice-cream to a table. When the waiter was about to take the desserts to the table we called him and asked an answer for the false statement. The manager and the waiter got puzzled and said that the ice-cream had melted that's why they decided not to serve. But they could serve melted icecream to another table which did not seem to be melted at all. They apologized to us and gave us a complimentary daab ice-cream to taste but we refused to take it and left the restaurant. The manager at the start was also behaving rudely with us when we asked him to give us a table upstairs if there's vacancy. If they have come up with an offer then the management must be ready to face all circumstances. Most of the dishes were out of stock which was very disappointing. People outside were standing in queues just to get disappointed.
The service was poor, food quality was good, koshe kosha never gives a good portion of food anyway, the taste was good. Didn't expect this kind of experience from such a renowned outlet.

We went there on the third day of their 10th year anniversary celebration. The food is really good, and you feel at home, almost like a  'Sunday lunch at a Bengali house' feel. All the more so if you are a true bong at heart ! Despite the crowd on that day the staff and service was commendable , so was the food quality which was upto the mark just like on  any other day.

This was my first time in Koshe Kosha. I have heard a lot about this place and it had been on my wishlist for a long time. This outlet is very easy to locate. It is situated in the lane opposite Mouchak, Golpark and is a 7-10 mins walk from Gariahat.

This is a pure Bengali restaurant. The ambience of the place is amazing. They have seating arrangements both upstairs and downstairs. The staff is courteous and polite. The service is quick. Coming to the food, we tried out Kosha Mangsho, Kochi Panthar Jhol and Chanar Kopta with plain rice. For dessert we had aam doi and baked rosogolla. We are extremely satisfied with the food, both quality and quantity wise. The place has a certain bangaliyaana feel with their soft music, lightning and their interior decors which is bound to keep you easy and relaxed throughout. They also have arrangements for takeaways.

PS. They also keep Bengali books for sale here.

I had picked up dinner from your Golpark Outlet yesterday afternoon and I would very much wish to share this experience.I had packed a Pabda Jhal,Bhetki Kalia,Katla Kalia,Gandharaj Murgi and Kochi Pathae Jhol.
The first that I would say is "The Experience was absolutely DISGUSTING and HORRIBLE ".
The fish dishes were literally all doused in the same gravy.The quality of the fish was of lowest range and even one of them had a piece less.Undercooked,lots of oil and very very ill prepared.
The chicken dish was supposed to be one of your signature dishes.And I am sorry to say that if this is the quality of your signature dish then your restaurant simply is not good eating at.Anywhere in the world you will never be excused after serving literally half boiled chicken in a gravy of extremely sweet curd.Oh yes that is what it was.
The mutton-Kochi Pathar Jhol.Well first thing is when you are serving Bengali dishes you must know that Bengalees are very sensitive about a piece of mutton being "A Kochi Patha or a Reyazi" one.Extremely hard to chew it was Reyazi that was served on the plate in a swimming pool of oil,no spices nothing.
The reason I am writing this review is because even if you are serving dishes for Rs.150,you must understand that you are ought to maintain a basic standard of the food.My friends did forbid me from visiting this place as its a real one for disgust.The "Rating on Zomato" is testimonial of that fact.
I would like to sign off by saying please look forward towards improving your food and definitely your attitude.Food people say is "Love served on a plate".And what I got was pure pure Hatred.No wonder even after so many years,people name a Bhojohori Manna or a 6th Ballygunje Place or even a Kasturi for having Bengali food outside anytime before koshe kosha.
Thank you

Very poor management, and even worse food. The foods are generally overpriced and hence only went to try it out for the 99/149 menu but it turned out to be a disaster. I recommend not visiting unless it's Durga Pujo and every other restaurant is full.

This is an easy-to-locate joint of pure Bengali food. Located few meters from Golpark more, this joint specialized in Bengali cuisine has everything to offer right from Puri to Chholar dal, from Biryani to Steamed rice, from prawns to Bhetki fish. 

Area wise, not a very big joint as it can accommodate approximately 30 people in one go, but the ambience still manages to give you the feel of the traditional Bengali culture. 

Be it visiting with friends, family or as a couple, this franchise does serve you well in terms of food and service.

It was their 10th anniversary so me and my friends decided to celebrate the occassion

Interior - The interior decor was really soothing to one's eye. The place was totally covered with bamboo and lanterns and all sorts of belongings of a bengali hut in the villages. Those things added a beautiful touch to the interior. Now i must say about the washroom. I have visited quite a few restaurants but their washroom are not themed according to the theme of the restaurant. Here they even decorated the washroom like the one in old bengali homes. It consisted of wooden doors with bamboos and the ceiling was covered with straws. It looked beautiful with the deam lightings

Service - Though the place was not soo big but there were quite a few number of waiters there who were not soo much professional. They didnt paid any attention to each and every table for checking their needs. They had to be called every time inspite of which they attended after a while. So service as in our case was not upto the mark.

Food - Only two items were available and so we could go for starters and all. We ordered polau,dhakai mangso,kochi patha jhol,katla kalia,baked rosogolla and aam doi. 

1. Polau - It was exquisite in taste. It tasted just like my mom use to make. One should definately try this one.

2. Dhakai mangso - Another beauty of this place is that you get to taste east bengal food also. The mutton was soft and tender and the flavour was awesome. A perfect match with the polau. 

3. Kochi pathar jhol - It reminded me of the sunday menu at my home every week. It was prepared with lota of care and the dish tasted perfect. 

4. Katla kalia - It didnt go well with the polau. It was a dish best for white steemed rice or fried rice. This dish tasted good but the fish was soo deeply fried that its taste was absent throughout the dish and thus it was not upto the mark keeping in mind the other dishes. 

5.  Baked Rosogolla - The showstopper of the evening. Its taste and spongy matter burst inside our mouths and filled them with joy and ecstacy. A must for a desert. 

6. Aam doi - All good things need a beautiful ending and thus it was also one of the beautiful ending to an awesome dinner. 


Staff behaviour - The service staff was quite polite but the guy sitting at the counter was not at all professional. There was some problem with someone who called him on his private phone and he took someone's name and said "kelabo maal ta k kal asuk akbar (I will beat him real hard, let him come tomorrow) " were his exact words in front of a packed crowd having dinner. He was literally shouting saying these words. It was totally a baad impression for such a prestigious occasion. The management should take necessary steps. 

As a whole this place was quite a turnaround for a mid week dinner and we all enjoyed well

Thank You team KOSHE KOSHA

Being a Bengali, it's always special to taste Bengali dishes in restaurants. I was thinking so before the dishes were served in Koshe Kosha, Golpark.
First of all, due to the bumper offer everyone had to wait for long time. At that time, the security guard told us that the items are not ready, so we would need to wait there. I expected the dishes to be hot as items were being cooked as said by the Security guard. I ordered Plain rice, Macher matha diye dal, alu bhaja, Bhetki fry, Kosha mangso, ampora. Only rice was hot. The waiter boy firstly said that the Bhetki Fry was not available. After few minutes, I heard a lady sitting next to my table was ordering Bhetki Fry. So I asked the waiter whether Bhetki Fry is available or not. He said the fry is available right now. So I ordered that. When he served the Bhetki Fry it was not at all hot. I was really surprising that we had to wait as the items are being cooked, then how those items were not hot at all? Secondly, the mangso Kosha was too salty to taste. Thirdly, the Macher matha diye dal had not the essence. It was not at all tasty as it is generally.
I was really disappointed for having such dinner.
I don't know about the other dishes they are offering. But I recommend you all not to order the above mentioned dishes I ordered except the Bhetki fry. The Bhetki Fry would be more tasty if it would be hot.
Thank You!

Located near Golpark opposite to Aminia. It has two floors. Its offering special price for its 10th Anniversary. The Special Menu has been attached with this review. It is available at all outlets of Koshe Kosha. The offer is valid for 28th, 29th and 30th August of 2017. Had to wait for 20-25 min as it had a very long queue. We were two people. The more large the group the more will be waiting time generally. But the waiting was worthy when we got to taste the dishes. We ordered the following dishes-
1. Plain Rice- 1 bowl is Enough for 2 people, more than enough for couples (generally).
2. Sona Muger Dal- as Narkel diye Chholar Dal was unavailable we ordered the dish, it was just awesome.
3. Alu bhaja- its basically Dip fried potato i.e. like potato chips.
4. Dhokar Dalna- it comes with 4 pieces of dhoka.
5. Bhetki Paturi- 2 paturis will be served in one plate. It is a MUST TRY. Its just delicious. The color, the smell, the texture everything is mouth watering.
6. Baked Rosogolla- Comes in 2 rosogollas. Perfect Dessert to finish your bengali lunch.

Tips- Every dish is sufficient for two persons having medium capacity. So try more dishes instead of ordering same dish multiple times.

The shittiest place to visit.
I had visited this place the Golpark branch on the 28th after calling them up on 4:12 pm and I reached by 4:27 pm.As I enquired they asked us to come down as there is no waiting. After reaching the security was rude enough to say that we have to wait.after I requested him that I want to speak to the manager he completely said a no!!!
I did not have a problem waiting but this sort of miscommunication and misconduct is not acceptable.

"Koshe Kosha" ~ An authentic Bengali cuisine that offers you savory Bengali dishes. 

Coming to the decor first. The interior look has been designed to represent a period Bengali era with wooden chairs, book shelves & sculptures.

The food is quite good , though I find the rate slightly on the higher side. Must try dishes - Bhetki Keema roll & Bhetki Chingri Melbondhon.

On the main course, it is recommended to try the signature dish which is dhakhai mangsho. It is a  mutton preparation cooked over exotic spices. We tried some other dishes namely gondhoraj chicken & potol dorma. However, to our surprise we found that the dishes to be sweet which dampen our spirit to certain extent .. :( We somehow missed the authentic mutton curry taste for which Koshe Kosha is famous for !! Hope the management take this note, if they come across my post.

Location - near golpark crossing, opposite to tinny da dhaba. 

Food - nice place to have authentic bengali food. We tried basanti pulao, gondhoraj chicken, chitol maach er muitha. I really like the lemony taste of gondhoraj chicken. We also had baked rosogolla and nolen gur ice-cream for dessert. 

Service - service was prompt. We didn't have to wait long. Only problem is small sitting area.

If you want to try authentic Bengali cuisine,so "koshe kosha" carrying it's heritage over the years.
It's located in Golpark opposite of "tinny da dabha".
Inside the restaurant you will take you villages atmosphere,the lights,the Griffiths are amazing.
The staffs are very gentle,quick at service, cooperative.
Coming to their dishes I tried their murgir kabiraji which was sufficient for 2 people, elish Paturiüëå, basanti pulao it's seemed to be bit less quantity though it was good and the Dhakai mangso was delicious.
Well,i had a great time there and definitely looking forward to visit there again.

Nice Place, although the "upstairs" seating arrangement could do with a little more lighting and decor. But I'll give it a pass, it reminds you of the old "Calcutta". Now, coming to the food, AWESOME,

The Kosha Mangsho was the star, it's better than all the other places I have had Bengali cuisine. the Basanti Pulao was also great. Surely demands some more visits.

Location - near golpark crossing, opposite to tinny da dhaba. 

Food - nice place to have authentic bengali food. We tried basanti pulao, gondhoraj chicken, chitol maach er muitha. I really like the lemony taste of gondhoraj chicken. We also had baked rosogolla and nolen gur ice-cream for dessert. 

Service - service was prompt. We didn't have to wait long. Only problem is small sitting area.

One of the best lip smacking food joints in kolkata. Firstly, the menu has so attractive bengali delicacies that it would bring a smile to any customer and specially a "Bangali". Being a bong and a foodie I enjoyed every bit of food in this joint. 

We order rice, shona muger daal, dhakai mangsho, bhetki paturi. All the dishes are too good and how can I forget baked roshogolla. These roshogollas has some magnetic power which drags me all the time to this place.

Highly recommended!!

This is not expected from koshe kosha.

They serve amazing food I tell you. Me and my friends went there today for lunch. We had Moshla Murgi and Rotis for lunch. Wow rotis and mosola Murigi both are amazing in its own way. The taste of Mosola Murgi is still lingering like I can't forget. Their food almost taste like hommade food. And the rotis they serve are not normal rotis as they say but its ghee ye bhaja. I would definitely suggest you guys to visit this place atleast once for authentic Bengali Khawar.
 The ambience is good. Plus point goes for the interior decoration which might be small but has a rural essence in it. Also you can locate it very easily and we didn't have to wait for food that much. They are real quick.

Taste null , ambience done well bit cheap too... a room of good height has been chopped from b/w by play wood and made the second floor. The ground of t shakes literally, 
Very small place , healthy head like me may be bit uncomfortable,
Staff behaviour was friendly but one of them were too busy making up things too fast.
They give complimentary papad which was only good and highly accepted.
Else for food Being  Bengali HardCore NO
I order bhetki paturi, it was normal sea fish
It's just going bcos people will have this way or that

If wanna give treat to taste bud plz Don't. 
Lastly the price n quantity doesn't match..

Only shukto was dam good.

Went there to give my B-day treat. It was one day before Christmas last year. The place was empty, we chose to sit at the top floor. Place was nicely decorated, loved it.

Now the FOOD part!!
We had -
Dim Chingri Devil
Basanti Polao
Kosha Mangsho
Dim Chingri Devil was quite heavy for two of us. In each devil, there is a half egg and Chingri. Taste wise it was 2/5.
Basanti Polao was good, not too sweet (as I like). As we had the Devil before it, so it was sufficient for us. Taste wise it was 3.5/5.
But the Kosha Mangsho was not at all satisfying. When it was actually served, it was 'thanda', look wise it was okay, but didn't get that taste because the gravy of the mutton was no where. It was a disaster! üò†, It was like 1.5/5.

But the staffs were good.
Overall it was a okay experience!!

An authentic restaurant that serves authentic food which is located at one of the lanes of Golpark near Mouchak (sweet shop). We went there for dinner and was really satisfied with the food and service. We had ordered jeera rice, pulauo alonwith it we took gandhoraj chicken, moshla murgi and dim kosha. All of the items had that essence of Bengaliana and the ambiance doubled it too.

I usually hate bengali food but once had lunch here during Durga Puja after being forced by my friends and well, it was worth it. I'll suggest try some variety of fish here. 
The ambience is really good, all bengali style and decorated with traditional stuff. Even the food is served with bengali styled containers. 
Service was bad as it was during the puja but normal time i don't know, you'll have to find it yourself.

Hello...It's a not so big outlet near golpark, gariahat. The gondhoraj ghol (80/-) was refreshing with the prominent flavour of gondhoraj lebu. The baked paratha (60/-) is awesome and quite heavy. The dark mutton kasha (250/-) is as usual good. But the bhetki chingri jugalbandi (230/-) is a big let down with no prawns at all. It's jusy a normal fish fry which is highly overpriced. We doubt its actually a combination of bhetki and prawn or just a normal fish fry. If thats the case then they should have charged (150/- price of a fish fry) for that and not (230/-). Ambiance is good but service is not so prompt. Overall a 3/5.

Sunday dinner at this place wasn't that bad at all. This restaurant is very easy to locate. Interior of the restaurant is village themed and it's quite small in area. We had Fish Kabiraji and lime soda as starter, in the main course we ordered the very famous Kosha mangsho which was very tasty and dim bhetki bhapa which was totally mouth watering. In short, food was awesome and service was efficient too. Liked the place and hope to visit again soon.

I visited this place few months back. They serve you some typical Bengali dishes which are pretty basic in taste. I ordered normal Masoor dal, Plain Rice, Moshla Murgi, Roti and Aam doi. Everything tasted fine. It's actually more like "Ghar ka khaana" types so it was simple yet nice. They were really quick in serving our meal we didn't have to wait much which in a good thing so Thumbs up for that.

We went for weekend lunch to the golpark outlet. We reached at around 2:45pm and it was almost full at that time. We got our seats in the ground floor.
We ordered aam pora sorbot which was nice and refreshing. .the only thing we liked in this restaurant.  In the main course, we ordered plain rice, sukhto, lau chingri, bhetki paturi, pabda jhal, kochi pathar jhol. The sukhto was more like a vegetable stew..didn't like at all. Lau chingri was okay..nothing extraordinary. .though it had good quantity of chingri. The fish items were low on salt and bland..I have had better bhetki paturi at my home. Kochi pathar jhol was the worst item on our menu..the mutton was stiff and the gravy tasted like fish gravy..due to abundance of cumin in it..no flavour of mutton in the gravy. When we complained about it, we were told mutton is absolutely ok and it is supposed to taste like that. After this disastrous lunch, we didn't dare to spend more money on desserts from this restaurant. 
Will definitely not visit again.

The usual attraction to good bengali food took us to this place in golpark. On Sunday afternoon the place was quite and vacant. Once you enter you will be definitely feel good with the decor, a typical bengali village theme. We started with Godoraj Gol which was a lassi with zest of Godoraj lemon. Quite tasty and refreshing. Then we moved to main course , ordering plain rice, dal, dhoka dalna, potato fries, Aam kasundi Elish, Mutton Kosha. While serving food they forgot to serve dhoka dalna.. Really first time I saw this kind of attitude in a Good restaurant. Other food items were okiesh. Dal and potato fries having nothing extraordinary. Elish size was good and tasty. Kosha mutton quality and quantity was both not great. We then ordered dab ice cream and aam doi, of which aam doi had gone sour.. We tasted it a called and waiter to which they apologized but they don't have any more piece left. Of which we left disappointed. Quantity does not do justice to the price tag it offers. Kolkata has many other great restaurants offering good bengali food. Not a must try sure...

Good place to have Bengali dishes. I tried mochar chop, bhetaki fry, pambada  curry with plain rice. It was perfect experience. Little sweetness in dishes.

Visited Koshe Kosha on Poila Boisakh.

The restaurant was well decorated with Mat(Madur), Handfan and other necessary bengali stuffs.¬†
We ordered 1 plain rice, Kosha Mangsho, Pabda machher jhal and aampora sharbat.

Food was delicious and enough for two people to fill up their tummies,
and they offered complimentary pan too(I guess that was poila boisakh special).

The experience was overall good and the restaurant is surely worth more than one visit.

N.B- Despite all the good vibes, I felt sitting area is a bit inadequate.

One must wait for 10-20 minutes on a festival day.

Wanted to make one of my friend get the taste of authentic bengali cruisine. We went to koshe kosha. And we werent disappointed at all. We had ordered chingri malaikari beckti macher paturi and dhakai mangsho. Every thing was perfect. Price wise it was also pocket friendly. The restaurant is themed in the form of village. Service was preety prompt and whelming.

Today Visited this place... Ambiance is very good. Ordered Gandhoraj Ghol, Fish Kabiraji, basmati rice, Shona Moog dal, Alu Bhaja, Echor Kaliya, Katla Kaliya, Bhetki Paturi, Mutton Kosha.... Food was authentic Bengali cusine.. But Aloo Bhaja was not restaurant made... They just fried those ready made aloo bhaja available in the market.. Katla Kaliya was great in taste but fish quality was not fresh... Staff behaviour was remarkably great.. helped in each and every possible way.. 

Pocket pinch was slightly on higher side.. location is awsome.. just beside Golpark.

Overall a must try place... Definately will visit in future..

Ambience - though the space is a bit small.but is well  decorated to provide the feel of a typical bengali ' hneshel'. 
Staffs are well behaved. And cordial.
Food - tried kakrar jhal and dhakai mangsho with rice.
Qnty  sufficient for 2
Quality - fingerlicking good.
And they give small papads as complimentary.

We loved the food. It was authentic and had distinct flavours of bengal. Essentially we should have such speciality restaurants. In india the trend is to have many cuisines in a restaurant hence losing the specialty of a certain particular cuisine. Infact in our travels we have found that authentic cuisine of the particular land is hardly found in restaurants. So it was a happy evening to spend eating here. Please try there desserts too. The space is humble but the guys who served did so with warmth.

It was a small family lunch.
We ordered their specialty kosha manghso and basanti polao as main dishes,The polao was nice and aromatic,quantity was good.Kosha manghso was good,not overtly spicy and 4 pieces were good,though they cud have been a tad bit more soft.
Gondhoraj Ghol was unique and lime soda was ok.
The daab icecream was fantastic!
Service was good and the place despite being small,has a good traditional ambience.

Me and my wife went for an afternoon snack. Decor nice and the staff quite professional. We were seated on the upper floor.
Gondhoraj ghol - there's a difference between lassi and ghol, and it was nicely done. If you wish the heavy frothy lassi, which is usually a meal by itself, it's not for you. However the gondhoraj part of it was a bit too subtle, for my taste. The gondhoraj lime zest had settled and the flavour became more and more pronounced as the level went down. Maybe they can add a plastic stirrer.
Fish Kobiraji - Had Kobiraji after many years. Had the same authentic taste. Nice big chunk of fish. The melt in your mouth batter was done to perfection. And it was filling.
Baked rasogolla - This was the best part. The quality of the sweets were better than the ones from some of the best and famous "mishtir dokan" s around Kolkata.
Overall a nice experience. We went in the afternoon so there was not much of a crowd. However the seats are close by and may be slightly uncomfortable if the place is packed.

The feel of being able to be in the interior of a village hut and having your food is somewhat nice. Lets get it right away-
Tasty food, reasonable price, good ambience.
But the sitting capacity is low and less spacious. might be somewhat suffocating. @

Ok, I am visiting restaurant now a days like anything. This is 2nd visits to KOSHE KOSHA. Previously I was there with "Ms. T". Now yesterday was the occasion of Birthday. My mother in law. She is DK. It was a surprise treat from her daughter. "Mrs.T ". Coming to food. Her and I was looking for "Daab chingri" and "potoler dorma" those were available unfortunately. So we started with "chingri cutlet" and "murgir cutlet". Former one is literally an appetiser by its taste. Later one is deep fried with egg white and crispy but less in taste. I didn't enjoy that so is everyone. Then we ordered "chitol macher muitha", "Aam kasundi chingri", "gondhoraj chicken", "Dhakai Mutton" as side dishes and rice and rotis. We were 7 people, and we celebrated her birthday by cutting a cake. Oh ok, I forgot about chilling refreshing "gondhoraj ghol", which we started off with our day. Over all dishes were mesmerising. Authentic Bengali restaurant. But to give you an information, the owner of this chain is a guy who is from Orissa. Best was "gondhoraj chicken" and "Aam kasundi chingri". A must go place for Bengali cuisine lovers.

Well to start with the decor , it  has the old school charm of the quintessential Calcutta flavor but when it comes to the the taste , looks decieve . I had ordered‚Äã a fish kabiraj and mohcar ghonto fr  starters which was pretty good . But they really messed up the kosha mutton , it was just pathetic ..Half cooked my parents could not eat half of it and then the roti's were equally bad .Top of it , I had ordered Dab ice-cream which was nothing but vanilla ice-cream  garnished with extra dry fruits ...I mean seriously is this what you serve to your customer ..Make a fool out of them... Really not expected this from you guys ...Serve what you can , please don't brag wen u can't serve it in real .üò£

Coming to food... We ordered this time postor Bora, ALU jhinger posto, basanti pulao, chital macher muithya nd murgi kasha... Taste of all the items were genuinely good... I enjoyed every ounce of it.. The quantity was also generous... 
Overall I really enjoyed and relished my time here...

Yesterday afternoon had a lunch at Koshe Kosha, Golpark with a friend.

ADDRESS: 62, Ballygunge Garden Road, Golpark, Ballygunge Gardens, Gariahat, Kolkata, West Bengal 700019

As we entered we were welcomed by a different kind of traditional village setting theme, it was almost empty, we took our seats.

MENU: On the menu you will find a wide range of bengali dishes. We ordered

1) Fish Kabiraji: Served with different types of sauces and salads. It wasn't my personal favourite, but was good as a starter. Rating: 3.5/5

2) Cold drink & Gandhoraj Ghol: Gandhoraj Ghol was excellent. I loved it. Highly recommended. Rating: 4.5/5

3) Basanti Pulao: Wasn't as good as I expected. I made Basanti Pulao for the first time somedays back & that was better than it. Rating: 2.5/5

4) Kosha Mangsho: 4 small mutton pieces in a blackish gravy. This is a dish which is bound to be delicious & It was good, but I had better Kosha mangsho before. Rating: 3.5/5

The service & staffs were okay, food was good, quantity was okay for us as we weren't that hungry, pricing was okay.That meal was of 795 bucks.

All in all, it wasn't a bad experience.

Ordered food after a long time. Last time when I had been to the restaurant, the food really tasted great. This was around 2 years back.

But last night, the experience was really disappointing.

I had ordered Kochi Pathar jhol and mochar chop.

The Kochi Pathar jhol was not that great, missed out on some flavour.

There was abundance of powdered masala (guro masala) in the gravy that killed the enjoyment.

There was a strange strong smell of dhone masala (coriander masala).

The meat was soft but not tasty at all in itself.

As a whole it was a disappointing experience.

Now coming to the mochar chop, the skin was a bit thik than expected from a better restaurant, did not like it. Seemed like I had ordered from some local Gariahat eatery/fast food counter.

Known for providing authentic Bengali cuisine, this joint maintains the high standards of dishes and service. 
The rice variants are all very inviting and the kosha meat are all very well cooked. 
The fishes are pretty much what every Bengali would dream on Sunday's. 
However , it's a small place with not much attention to details or sitting accommodations. These improved upon, this will become a must-go to for any locals of the area.

Visited for lunch today to give a treat to my friend with high hopes. Ordered Kosha mangso, luchi, rice and godhoraj chicken, baked rosogolla and aam doi. Godhoraj chicken had no taste, kosha mangsho was very average, even home made luchis are better than this. Sweet dishes were better.Ambience is also not any interesting.My friend was very disappointed with the food, and I felt bad I have taken her to this place for a treat.I promise never ever to step in any of their restaurants.

Be it vetki fry / dim chingrir devil / ilish bhape / desi murgir jhol Koshe Kosha always serves beyond expectation..I like the ambience of urban village and homely sitting arrangement. 

They have mouth watering collection of vegetable menus as well.Ohh..that mouth watering taste of typical mom made "sukto","chanar dalna" reminds me my childhood days ..

Try malai chingrir,doi ilish here those are truly yummy and will attract you to come here again and again.

I have visited this place multiple times and gradually seeing the Menu card changing with time in terms of design as well as increased price ..but its still worth visiting

Keep it up guys  .I have no other choice except visiting the place again while I will miss my mom's cooking.Thanks for being 2 nd home to me.

I came here one day for lunch with Anamitraa/The Gut Filling .The decor is done well with handicrafts depicting Bengal's culture and heritage.But I didn't like the dim lighting at all.It would've been better if it was brightly lit up which is a mood elevator like their jadavpur outlet I went before.We were given papads to munch on as we decided on what to order.
We went for a becty chingrir melbondhon in starters and for mains we chose basanti polao with a plate of kosha mangsho on the side.

‚Ä¢Beckti chingrir melbondhon- A piece of crumb fried cutlet comprising of fish and prawn mince cut in half was served to each of us.It came with tomato ketchup and kasundi.The fries tasted decent.The filling of fish and prawn tasted good though proportion of prawn to fish was a bit less.Kasundi which is a quintessential thing to go with Bengali style fries packed a punch.It had that pungency to really hit you.I loved it.

If the starter gave a decent start.. it was the mains which hit the ball outside the park!

‚Ä¢Basanti polao-Amount is quite good.The aroma of long grained rice cooked in ghee was tantalising.Taste was even better.It was perfectly sweetened as it should be in bangali polao.Kaju kishmish were used adequately.Loved it.

‚Ä¢Kosha mangsho-Its the best thing to have at koshe kosha! 4 pieces of mutton cooked in dark coloured gravy came in a single plate.Mutton pieces were tender and pink at the centre which are indicators of perfectly cooked meat.The gravy is tempered with black pepper and it is quite hot.It was amazing as hell.I loved it and finished it off entirely.It was a perfect accompaniment to misti polao.

Service is efficient.Pricing is moderate.

Started with aam panna after that tasted the newly introduced starter of bhetki and prawn.It was crisp and delicious.We ordered thali non veg and it was having adequate variety of choices.The portions were sufficient and quality was very good.Enjoyed the lunch. In my opinion mutton kosha and baked parata are the best food combination. Try it.

An all time favorite place of mine to visit for authentic bengali cuisine with a modern take.

Whenever you feel like getting high on flavours of the Bengal, pay a visit to this place.I'm sure you won't be disappointed. 

I ordered :-

(1) Chicken Cutlet.

(2) Vetki Fish Fry.

(3) Plain Basmati Rice. 

(4) Sukto. 

(5) Muger Daal.

(6) Lau Chingri.

(7) Alu Vaja.

(8) Potol Alur Torkari.

(9) Potol Dorma. 

(10) Murgir Mangsher Jhol.

(11) Rui macher Kalia.

(12) Chingri Macher Malaikari.

(13) Shorshe Ilish. 

(14) Chitol Mach.

(15) Ruti.

(16) Kosha Murgir Mangsho.

(17) Pineapple Chutney.

(18) Papor. 

(19) Mishti Doi.

(20) Baked Rasogolla. 

The "Chicken Cutlet" was very crispy and the chicken was fresh.The crisp was just perfect.

The "Vetki Fish Fry" was indeed a tasty appetizer and especially for the one's who are into fish more than chicken and egg.If you have a taste for Vetki Mach then you should definitely try it.

The "Sukto" was very creamy and tasty.It was filled with loads of veggies.It is traditionally a mix of veggies prepared with milk.You can taste the richness of the milk and the fibre and vitamins of the veggies.A very healthy side dish to go with rice.

The "Muger Daal" is very thick and is very tasty.Just the way you mom makes it.

The "Lau Chingri" was fantastic.The veggie was diced into fine pieces and the kucho chingri mixed with it was a splendid combo.Unique flavour and a good side dish.

The "Potol Alur Torkari" was good and was bit spicy.A pure veg delicacy for the vegetarians out there.

The "Potol Dorma" comes in many varieties but the one I ordered had mutton filling.It also comes in paneer filling,alu filling for the vegetarians.It is a very tasty delicacy and a very difficult one to make too.It takes skills to make a Potol Dorma perfect and they made it really well.Juicy mutton on the inside and the Potol was very soft. 

The "Murgir Mangsher Jhol" is a traditional chicken gravy preparation.The chicken is spicy and the gravy is very well prepared to go with rice.

The "Rui Macher Kalia" is very tasty and the pieces of the fish are huge.The delicacy is prepared in the traditional manner,the taste reflects it.

The "Chingri Macher Malaikari" is a very special prawn gravy preparation.It is made with coconut and other spices.Very tasty and a must try.

The "Shorshe Ilish" is the must have for the bongs and indeed they prepare it well.With the right amount of mustard (jhaj) and great pieces of the fish.

The "Chitol Mach" is very tasty and the piece of the whole fish is very good and indeed of good quality. 

The "Kosha Murgir Mangsho" is a different take on the chicken preparation where it is not so gravy but kind of dry which u enjoy with ruti/chapati. 

The meal ends with Pineapple Chutney,Papor,Mishti Doi and Baked Rasogolla.

The perfect way to end a perfect Bangali meal.

Will return soon...
Untill the next time,hungry for more...

The ambiance is undoubtedly very much Bengali but I was not much pleased with the overall experience. I must say the taste of food was really very good but quite highly priced. Quantity of food was not enough at all and you should not expect to share your dish with anyone. The Prawn Cutlet and Fish Cutlet was really very tasty but again it is very costly and I do not think it deserved. The rating is for good taste and ambiance.

Situated in Golpark opposite aminia, this place serves amazing Bengali cuisine in a decent price.
I visited this place back in 2014 on Shoshti, and despite of the puja rush we managed to get a seat immediately. 
The behaviour of the staffs were warm and the ambience was nice.
Coming to food, this place doesn't compromise with its taste and quantity!
The kosha mangsho over here is a die for.

In all, it was a good experience and I look forward to visit this place in future.

Landed up in this golpark outlet of the franchise, for a late, late lunch with mom. Inside's quite spacious, with seating arrangements at both the ground and mezzanine floor. We started off with a refreshing glass of gondoraj ghol..a sweet lassi flavoured with gondhoraj rinds. Next jumped straight to business with gorom sada bhaat, daal, poshto-r bora. Followed it up with chanar dalna, bhetki paturi and buoyed by the success of the ghol, gondhoraj chicken. We sealed the deal with anaras chatni and some customary papad at Sesh paat. Everything tasted nice, like they should be. In my opinion it's difficult to nail simple Bengali dishes in a restaurant 'cause us bongs are so used to eating them, a minor problem becomes very evident to our taste buds. I liked the food and The m√†dre too approved, so no complaints..a success nonetheless...‚ò∫

Koshe Kosha Golpark-a great way to waste your money and time. They'll help you by serving semi cooked and rotten food. Rubbish service and illmannered staff. Moreover they won't even think a min to charge for the rotten food. I will not suggest this restaurant to anyone.

We had pulao, white rice, gondhoraj chicken, mutton kasha, cold drinks (which was not really cold but I didn't mind owing to my sore throat) & chutney. Overall it was a good experience.

Although it states that they open their restaurant up at 11am, that's not true. At least during puja, they could not maintain that time frame due to the presence of a huge crowd till morning every day. We were the first customer on "Nabami." We waited for 1 hour 30 mins to let them get ready to cook and serve food. The guards were apologizing for this which I found genuine. ¬†Coming to the food and ambience part, both were satisfactory, if not good. They tried to capture a glimpse of rural Bengal. We had Beckti fry, Basanti pulau, Chanar dalna, Gondhoraj chicken. Basanti pulau was kind of cold. Chanar dalna was good, so is the chicken dish. Main problem regarding food was the amount was so less.

Today I visited the Golpark branch of Koshe Kasha during the afternoon to order certain items (Bill No 5073). I returned home after collecting the parcel. I had ordered for 2 portions of Tomato Chutney alongwith other orders. While opening the parcel I found to my dismay that the two containers had tomato sauce instead of tomato chutney. I was shocked by such ridiculous handling of orders. I immediately called up the restaurant wherein after holding the phone for 10 mins I was told to send my address via sms to 8336990112 ( the no for home delivery) so that someone would deliver the 2 portions of tomato chutney to my address but till now no one has delivered the same to my address.¬†
I am a very old customer of Koshe Kasha but this incident has left a bitter taste in my mouth and I will advise all my friends, relatives, colleagues and known circle to avoid Koshe Kasha in future. Moreover in such a situation it was expected that the manager or someone senior would handle the complaint but I could hear the person advising the person who picked up the phone to give the story of delivering the same to my address by evening.

Worst eating experience ever. Had to wait for 1.5 h in the first place, and no waiting area available.  Next we ,  a party of 10 , we're seated on the upstairs area which was actually shaking when people walked. Waiters did not know how to wait tables. One of the waiters spilled water on the wooden floor making it resemble more like a bathroom....After repeated requests, someone brought a wet mop that had no effect ...then we had to personally supervise the clean up with a cloth map. Our group was divided into 2,  6 +4,  and we were constantly served food together meaning 3 mutton plates were served together in one bowl on one table....never will come Back here and will spread the word.

I was once told that this restaurant has one of the best Bengali Cuisine. But it had failed every bit of that. It is good but I can't say one of the best.
They humbly request us to have Sorshe Ilish as we don't want to because that was not the season. Still we had and it was smelling so bad that we have to turn that down.
The other dishes was good. But the ambiance was not the it should.

A pretty little place with beautiful, cozy, homely ambience.
We ordered for Gondhoraj Ghol, which was served to us with a plate of papads. The ghol itself was quite heavy.
Next came chicken kabiraji, Which was amazingly delicious! Light and crispy coat of egg outside and spiced meat inside. It was non greasy, which was definitely a plus point.
We had ordered for baked Parathas and Gondhoraj mutton. The mutton was slightly bitter, probably because of the lemon zest. And it was pretty hot for my taste buds. Not a big lover of green chilli. The meat , however, was succulent and cooked to perfection.
The definite show stopper for me was the Daab ice cream. I never wanted it to end!
Will be going back during winters to have the nolen gur ice cream!

If you want to have great Bengali delicacies, THIS IS THE PLACE. I went with my fianc√© and before entering we had second thoughts and were staring at the Aminia opposite to that. Searched a lot in Zomato and the restaurant appeared to be costing about ‚Çπ600 for two. Then we decided to try it out atleast (AND THAT COULD HAVE BEEN A MESSAGE FROM A FOODIE GOD or something), we didn't regret. Interiors might not attract, the space might not be real big, but we go to restaurants to enjoy the great food. And this is what they are best at. Unbeatable taste. Don't go by what I say, try for yourself and I bet you'd keep visiting as I'm already planning for Sunday.

Located right in front of Aminia, GolPark. Lovely ambience with theme of Bengal Village culture all around. They have the seating arrangements on the top floor. Visited this outlet on a weekday for lunch with a lot of expectation. Coming to food, somehow we missed that authentic Bengali taste of its spices. We ordered gondhoraj ghol, Polao, Kasha Mangsho, Luchi, Chingri cutlet. The taste of Kasha Mangsho gravy tasted good but mostly filled with bones.

Visited Koshe Kosha last Sunday for dinner.
A beautiful experience. Frankly, the best experience I've had so far at a Bangali restaurant!

Located strategically at Golpark, directly opposite to Tinny da Dhaba, this place is a gem of a place for every Bangali food lover.
This includes non - bongs too. I'm saying this because, while we were hogging our food, a non Bengali couple sitting diagonally opposite to us was raving about the awesomeness of the mocha'r chop that was served to them. Such a proud moment for every Bangali!‚ù§

The interior is done up in an authentic Bangali way, complete with woven mats and traditional owl showpieces.

Now coming to the best part of the night - FOOOOOD!!‚ù§

‚Ä¢ Dim chingrir devil - every Bangali is familiar with this quintessential evening snack which was made to perfection by Koshe Kosha. 4 devils stuffed with potato and shrimps in a plate, served with ketchup and mustard.

‚Ä¢ Luchi - needs no introduction. The only thing I would like to mention is that the size of the luchis were pretty huge. 4 in one plate.

‚Ä¢ Alur dum - I couldn't stop licking my fingers! It was so well prepared. Went really well with the luchis.

‚Ä¢ Moshla murgi - another amazing preparation dished out by the chef of KK! 4 succulent pieces of chicken cooked in tel and jhaal. This dish was such a winner!

‚Ä¢ Rice - we were served with basmati rice and the quantity was ample for 2!

‚Ä¢ Daab ice cream - the real game changer of the night. 2 scoops of daab flavoured ice cream served in a bowl. The flavour transported me to my "kaku ektu saansh ta bhalo kore chaariye dao" days. There were bits and pieces of saansh in every bite. I wish I was not so full, so that I could stuff myself with another bowl of this gorgeous creation, but alas!

Pocket pinch - 765!

What I really liked was their initiative to provide us with hand sanitizers before we dug in the heavenly spread. And also, yaay for the complimentary plate of saabur papor!‚ù§

An amazing experience, thanks to team Koshe kosha! Coming back here again for sure!
Much love.‚ù§

In the Bengali food demography, Koshe Kosha isn't a stand out. There are the wonderful Bangladeshi variants like Kosturi that serve more specialised cuisines, on one side, and the new entrants like Lokahar, on the other, that serve seasonal and not traditionally restraurant-worthy dishes like Neem Begun and Bok Phul Bhaja. 

Koshe Kosha serves very standardised Bengali food menu, and everything it serves is in the Ghoti style of Bengali cuisine -  everything is Misthi from the Dal, to the Macher Jhol to the Chutney, of course. For the Naokhali genes in me, so less Lonka was very difficult, but that's a personal choice for which I shall not deduct any points. But then be prepared for all the Misthi Khabar Dabar.

My parents decided to share between themselves a non-veg thali, which was a whopping 530 bucks, delivered home by Swiggy. 

The thali was elaborate but the stand outs were the really dark Mutton Kosha ( Maa found it bitter, but Baba and I quiet liked it), a rather nice Sukto and a very delicious Mocha r torkari.

But the Fish was really sad - the over fried fatty fish smelt of the Paak  (Marsh under a pond), and wasn't nice. The Dal, Chutney and Baked rasogollas were average.

Overall, for a thali at 520, it was average and a few good dishes don't justify the otherwise average spread. 

In verdict : visit if you want to, or don't if you don't want to. Either ways, it doesn't matter.

Now come to the dish. Yes the taste of the fish items is good. They have a varieties of fish items. They also provide complimentary small dishes with matching with your order. 
But disappointed with mutton dishes. The muttons are not soft/well cooked at all. 
Also the hospitality is impressive.

Koshe Kosha, as the name suggests, is a hub for Bengali cuisine. We were having a craving for pulao and we could hardly resist, so off we went to Kosha Kosha! While the pulao was good, the kosha Mangsho takes the cake! The aam pora sherbet was really good, but I have had better. We also had a vetki fry each (we were really hungry) which could've been better. Betki is defined by it's juiciness, and it was not up to the mark for me. Also, if they would consider a sitting arrangement for taller people like me! I was almost afraid of getting my head banged while coming down.

Todays dinner at this place was one of the most usual dinners at home, with comfort food and family. Located at golpark in the lane of ccd, which goes towards gariahat.
Ambiance and decor of this place is a bit dicey, as lack of space and a little lack in creativity haven't much uplifted the ambiance of ground floor. Service is just about average.
What should you come for? Definitely, the taste of food, which is so accurate to home food and perfect example of bengali cuisine. We ordered steamed rice, roti, pulao, daal, dhokar daalna, potoler dorma, alu bhaja and gondhoraj chicken.
The roti was not prepared well, where as rice ( both steamed and pulao) was cooked to perfection. Vegeterian dishes had all the quintessential bengali flavors. And gondhoraj chicken was definitely the show stealer, with a bit of twist to the bengali chicken kosha this was really good. It looses its point from being perfect because of the not-so tender chicken, needed a longer cooking time.
Thumbs up for the menu and intact flavors, food taste. Price is very much moderate, for 6 of us bill was about 1500 only.

It's "Koshe kasha"... so if you love "KOSHA MANGSHO", then just go there and order the mutton kosha or as their menu says "KOSHA MANGSHO", and to acompany it I will suggest Rotis... with onion salad... 

Now if this doesn't bring some water on tip of you tongue, then my friend you have some problem.

Specially I will suggest this place to them who really love Golbari's Style of Mutton Kosha. That spicy curry which sometime gives you the immense pleasure and later the immense pain!!

Though the outlet is clumsy and cramped in terms of space and seating- the pulao , kosha mansho and fish items are delectable. The service is decent but the sad faces of the waiters will definitely not make one cheerful. However, an eatery is as good as the as the food it serves. On that count this place in not much off the target.

The ambience is awesome, typical bong decor. You can never ignore Bengali food, no matter how much you eat there is always some space for ' ar ektu hok'. Mochar chop or bhetki fry or fish kabiraji they are great starters. Posto ilish hok ba gondhoraj chicken hok naaki kankrar jhal, they can take your heart away‚ô•. I love going to this place time and again and the reason typically is FOOD ‚ô°

A must place to visit in and around Golpark if you wish to taste good Bengali food. The ambience, the decor is great. And the food deserves a standing ovation. Me and my friends were in a sort of eating spreeüòã, so we ordered only gondhoraj murgi and dhakai mangsho with roti. And boy did we enjoy it. The flavours was perfect and made my day. A place I will visit soon with my family and I will make that a point for sure. Kudos to them for restoring Bengal foods glorious history and taste.

Visited this place on a warm afternoon with a friend who craved for barir khabar! Conveniently located in the heart of south Kolkata this place tries it's best to give all that signifies age old Bengal. The food is absolutely delicious, the price reasonable and the quantity optimum. We ordered veg thalis and a bhetkir jhal! Each of the items were lip smacking! The only thing that would make the experience impeccable would be the staff offering a little smile to greet!

The demand of authentic bengali cuisine with great seafood from a friend if a friend, who was visiting Kolkata for the first time took us to this place. The decor of this place tries to resonate the way bengali decor is around the state. The seating was comfortable and staff was polite. The staff though should know a little bit better English so that people who arent familiar with Bengali language dont find it so difficult to get suggestion and make their orders.

Moving on to the food, we ordered for luchi, alu dom, paratha, plain rice, chingri malai curry and bhapa ilish.

I liked the luchi and alu dom, the alu dom was a tad sweet but that made it taste better actually. We then moved on to having rice with chingri malai curry and bhapa ilish l. Both the preparations were absolutely brilliant with the right flavors and the prawn as well as fish being cooked to perfection. Iam not a huge fan of mustard gravy but the one here was amazing.

To end our meal we ordered for the nolen gurer icecream. I think this was my least favourite item for the day. I have had better ones in other places in kolkata.

The total bill was 1700 which is pretty decent for the amount of food we ordered. All in all it was a great experience!

Had Basanti Polao, which sort of tasted more like a dessert than savory rice, with Mutton Kasa. The meat pieces were tender, yes and the gravy was rich, had uniformity in spice distribution as well as texture, something that I purposely look for in Indian curries. Now, the Gandharaj Ghol, a yoghurt drink with juice from Gandharaj lemons, had a refreshingly novel flavor and taste, that I'd like everyone to try once, at least. Finally, the veg cutlet that I had for starter was a let down for its price. The fry hadn't been made sturdy enough as the outer crust wasn't of proper thickness and thus became brittle and failed to provide the crunchiness which supports the structure and as well as the taste of the fry. Overall, it was a li'l overpriced yet a venture worth undertaking for me.

Keeping aside the small area of this place,,, Koshe Kosha is best known for serving authentic Bengali food in a Bengali oriented ambiance.... Each nd every item mentioned here are worth a try once nd there are MANY in their menu....
The mutton preparations over here,,, especially mutton kosha is a must try for meat lovers...Also,,,, try their in-house special dessert ‚Äì aam doi (mango flavored yogurt).....

I was on a food trail with friend in Kolkata . He suggested that we visit this place. We went to the Golpark outlet.
Although we were almost full. Hence only tried their signature Kosha Mangsho ( Mutton in dry gravy) ¬†with Roti , avoided Luchi which is the winning combination . It was one of the best I have ever had. Well done mutton in an amazing dry gravy. Yumm ! . Ambience was great and service excellent. ¬†Will be back for Luchi Mangshi . :-)

There's always SOMETHING about bengali cuisine that steals your heart away. And here, pulao and mangsho is sheer love. So well cooked, tasted amazing. Something that always beats the pasta and pizza. 
While here at Koshe Kosha, the provide you with a typical bengali decor. Gobor shokhano to rhat Pakha. Jamini Roy r paintings. 
The bangali babu mascot in the menu card. So much in love with every single thing. 
Summed up the lunch with mishti doi. 
Great time spent!!

We visited this outlet only once since the Salt lake outlet is a lot more convenient for us.¬†
Their service is a little slack, common for almost all outlets...but I suppose it is mainly because they mainly depend of home deliveries and takeaways rather than dining in. Massive scope for improvement. Try their bengali polao and mutton.

Last night I visited this place and it was my first visit at koshe kosha.This place is very small and cozy ,but decoration is nice.On entering you we will get a rural life feeling.......from furniture to entire decoration will remind you a small village away from the city. I really like their DecoüòÉüòá. But food was simply a big disasterüòûüòûüòû and service was not swift . At first their A.C wasn't working (upper floor) and secondly we waited a long time after placing the order.Service was not so swift and smooth.Now coming to the food part........

We had fish kabiraji,polau,gandhoraj chicken and kosha mangso.

1.Fish Kabiraji: it's too large for one ..... but amount of salt in this preparation wasn't adequate...but when you add some salt ,it actually tasted good....

2.Polau: the level of sugar is a bit higher side,so I didn't like it at all . Because of its higher level i couldn't enjoy properly those sides with this .

3.kosha mangso: it was a bit spicy but not too bad.

4.Gondhoraj chicken: a total disaster!!!!!!!üòû I didn't find any flavours like" Gondhoraj"and most importantly they served very small pieces of chicken....... which wasn't satisfy us to the basis of price....
Quantity was ok but they actually compromised their quality of food on the basis of price.

I had visited this outlet of Koshe Kosha for a birthday treat. Good bengali food and pricing is good with comparison to the quantity and quality. The interiors are done in a way which takes you to the old times of Bengal that can be seen in the old movies.

I had the fish kabiraji, big fillet of fish and not just made to look big with the covering.
Then came the super fluffy and big luchis with chholar dal. Right amount of seasoning with the hint of sweetness that we love in the dal.

Then came the bangali pulao with kosha chicken. Yum.¬†
Ended the day with nolen gurer ice cream.

This was my first visit here today. I went there fully loaded with positive energy. But my expectation was not met that much.¬†

The ambiance was mesmerizing by village like surrounding.¬†
The staffs were very polite and helpful.

There were flies flying all around only our table. The staffs tried to get rid of that, but it was not ultimately accomplished.

Coming to food, we ordered non veg thaalis. All the items were good.¬†
But we were disappointed by mutton. The item was very very much spicy. It shouldn't have had so much spices. And, the mutton pieces were very small. But they were tender, soft, and well marinated.

The other items were good, both in terms of quantity and quality.

Being a bengali , i always eat bengali food often at home, so i was in search of some nice bengali dishes which are not so often prepared at home..we ordered basanti polao, kosha mangsho and bhetki paturi. Paturi was awesome , quantity was good for just rs 250. Kosha mangsho was tasty, but i felt that it was a little undercooked. Basanti polao was the best.. Really loved it. Its better than any other bengali restaurants , and also budget friendly. Every item is reasonably priced. The village like themed ambience of the restaurant made us feel the essence of noboborsho.

I have been to this restaurant 3-4 times and I was more than happy with each visit. They serve nice bengali food. I have tasted their ghee bhaat, sona mugh er daal, mangshor cutlet, jhire ilish, pulao, dhakai mutton. The taste which was with me for the longest time was that of the dhakai mutton and the pulao. The rich gravy of the mutton and the spices satisfied my bangaal tastebud. The pulao and the mutton was a brilliant combination. The cutlet was also very nice. I didn't like the Ilish much, maybe because ut wasn't the ilish season then.
But overall a very satisfying experience.

Going to a bengali restaurant while being present in kolkata initially sounded a bit ambidextrous to me, but surprisingly it did turn out be a good experience. Koshe kosha has a really nice deco and it looks really inviting from the outside. It also had fast service.  Talking about food, i tried their chicken kasha and puloa. Both of them were really tasty. recommended.

One of the better Koshe Kosha outlets in the city. I have tried multiple branches of their, and I believe, this has to be the best one among the lot. This particular outlet is located opposite to Aminia Golpark and very close to the iconic Mouchak. The ambiance here is pretty good, but the sitting spaces poses a lot of inconvenience.¬†

Had ordered for standard Kosha Mangsho and Paratha. The gravy was rich and oily, just the way it should have been. The Mutton pieces were good and contained sufficient meat and not unnecessary fiber or bones. The Paratha was freshly made and was delectable and easy to handle. The staff here are pretty helpful and they tend to look after your concerns.

Pricing is same as elsewhere. Won't really hurt you, but rather beckon you for a future visit sometime soon. :-)

This is a small eatery situated in Golpark, just opposite to the Aminia outlet. I had visited it on Poila Boishakh with my family. Was pleased to see that there wasn't a long waiting queue outside. The d√©cor of the restaurant is mediocre. We had ordered bhetki fry and aam porar sharbat for starter. The fry was quite well cooked and flavoursome. Next, we had ordered pulao and kosha mangsho for the main course. Pulao was average. Nothing to write home about.  But, the star of the meal was undoubtedly the kosha mangsho. Would definitely come back here again for this amazing dish. The staff is well behaved and quick too. Overall, a great place if you're looking forward to having good bengali food at reasonable rates.

This Koshe Kosha outlet was in my list for a very long time. I have heard a lot about this place from my friends and office colleagues and really wanted to dine out some time. So finally went there last month. The restaurant is a two storied place. The upper floor is well designed, and the look and feel try to present a rural Bengal look. One word of caution : Tall people should avoid the upper floor, the roof is quite low.

Now coming to the Food, we ordered a Veg Thali for each of us ( we were 3 in number), along with Dhakai Mangsho.

The Veg Thali consists of the following:

1. Ghee

2. Rice

3. Two types Bhaja ( Fried Dishes, Alu bhaja etc)

4. Two types Sabji (Shukto and Mocha r Ghonto)

5. Dal (Pulses)

6. Pulao

7. Chutney

8. Papad

9. Misti (Baked Rosogolla)

The Dhakai Mangsho is a Mutton Delicacy cooked in Dhaka styled gravy with exotic spices. Special mention should be made of Shukto and Mocha r Ghonto. They were marvelous and truly speaking, I did not touch Mutton and yet I finished my Rice.

Also at the end we ordered Nolen Gur-er Icecream. This was also very good.

The Food pricing is reasonable and I would definitely like to visit this place again to try other Bengali cuisine dishes prepared here.

The price was on the average to slightly higher range. I really enjoyed the baked paratha. The rice was good enough. The gravy of the dhakai mangsho was on the sweeter side, however it was quite interesting to taste. The gravy of the kosha mangsho was spicier, however it was mild compared to what this dish is in some other joints in the city. The mutton pieces are however more bone than meat. The ice cream was quite pricey, but tasted fine.

But recently, i have been there twice recently and i didn't find it amusing anymore. Food quality has definitely degraded and even the mutton was not warm enough. It has not been able to maintain the same quality of food.

We ordered bhetki fry for starter , and for the mains we ordered plain rice with rosun bhape bhetki and dhakai mangsho. First and foremost the service was very slow. The fry was not that good as the fillet used was very thin and the taste was not extraordinary. Rosun bhapa bhetki and dhakai mutton was good. Though the pieces of mutton was small but ut tasted nice.

Do NOT take home delivery from here. I ordered chitol peti yesterday and one piece costed Rs 450, as Chitol being an expensive fish. But to my surprise, I discovered that the piece was not really a real "peti" because it was the one next to head and half of it was actually head which was wasted. I called the manager Bapon Sarkar and what they could offer was just 10% discount on the next order.

The love for bengali cuisine took me to this place. We went there for lunch and had the non veg thali. Have to say the dishes were really super tasty. The thali comprises of jhur jhure aloo bhaja,  papad,  begun bhaja,  mochar ghonto, moong dal worth sabzi,  rui maacher kalia,  pulao/luchi with chicken kosha/mutton kosha,  mango chutney,  mishti doi and rasgulla. It was too filling for one person to have. The gondhoraj ghol is must have,  it's really refreshing.

Had gone to zomato with a couple of friends on 25th Jan at 1015 pm.we had eaten at their main branch several years back and we knew their koshe mangsho is amazing. To our utter dismay the koshe mangsho was full of fat encrusted pieces which were like chewing gum. We finished our food, complained to the waiters (to no response), paid 800 rs as the bill and went diagonally opposite to aminia. There we had some biryani and rezala..hope never ever to go to koshe kosha again

We went on a Sunday evening for dinner. I am happy to say that this place ¬†fulfilled our craving for Bengali cuisine.

Food: We ordered a Aam Kasundi chingri, Kosha Mangsho, baked Paratha and Polao and ended with a Aam doi. I was quite surprised with the baked parota and enjoyed it thoroughly( It felt absolutedly oil free and yet smooth and supple).The chingri was finger licking and the "mangsho" though quite rich n spicy was tasted delightful. The polao was sweet and teasted adequate and was the weakest link in our dinner that evening. The aam doi was spot on!

Service; Can be a bit spotty as we sat on the upper floor and could not get hold of the waiter always. but they served pretty quickly and provided proper suggestion for food.

Ambiance: You will feel the bengali theme there and rabindra sangeet was playing in the background. But the upper floor has low ceiling so might want to avoid that.

Verdict: A must if you want to treat your parents or some non Bengali friend to our home cuisine. the location is prime so wont be a problem to find this place.

Never thought of having bengali cuisine outside my own residence . Went to Golpark Library for a work . Checked in this place when my frnd forced . The food and the ambience was marvellous..tasty and lip smacking . It gave me an all new desire to taste more bengali themed restaurants.
The CHANAR DALNA is a must have over there üòòüòòüòò

It was the worst mistake i made , i was in golpark for sm work and was abt to enter Amenia for my lunch and suddenly i saw this Koshe Kosha located just opposite to Amenia so i decided to give this a try. I ordrd for one portion of rice , chicken kosha was what i had asked for which they serve with a single piece of chicken and they bought chicken curry with 4 pcs and a potato instd , and a plate of Pur diye begun bhaja. The food was practically horrid and tasteless , worst bengali preparation i had till date , and the chickens alu was smelly and i can gurantee it wasnt fresh. I dont know about the other outlets of Koshe but i wld give a big zero to this golpark outlet. They billed a nice amount of 421.00 for these 3 items , it was okay if the food was gud but i felt so sad that i had to pay so much and still i had to leave half the food coz it was just not worth it.

Both ambience and service of this place was good along with the d√©cor. We ordered steam rice, chingri cutlet and kosha mangsho. Rice was nicely prepared bt just about sufficient for 2 people. Chingri cutlet was very nice,crunchy on the outside and juicy inside. Stuffing was good.we loved the kosha mangsho. They serve 4 pieces per plate and the meat was very nicely cooked. It was spicy,rustic,flavours were certainly there. Overall nice experience but some of the dishes are slightly over priced in my opinion.

Easy to locate, situated in golpark, koshe kosha is one of the well known Bengali cuisine specialist in the town. The ambience is good, well decorated, service is to look after. They need some professionals for service. The taste of the food is good. I ordered mutton kasha, Kochi pathar jhol along with rice and aloo bhaja. The kosha mangsho was damn good, but not satisfied with Kochi pathar jhol. It was undercooked. Apart from that everything was good.

Very oily food. Took effort to locate the fish in the fish fry. Also the Kosha mangsho was black in colour and swimming in oil. Prawn kabiraji had a tiny smattering of prawn. delivery person did not carry necessary change

At the end we had "Dab Ice Cream" THat was the best food I had there. I loved it. If I go there I will go only for the item. Just loved it.

Yesterday, my wife and I went to the Ballygunge Gardens outlet of Koshe Kasha for some packed food which we could enjoy at home. I had gone through some of the reviews on zomato which had forewarned me that the prices were on the higher side. We ordered their signature dish, kosha mangsho along with two plates of bhetki fry and chingri malaikari.

We consulted the waiter before placing the order. He assured us that the malaikari (priced at around Rs 500 including tax) would contain two pieces of jumbo (galda)  chingri  and that the kosha mangsho would contain 4 large pieces of mutton. Since the food was packed in containers, we could not check the contents before departure.

We went home and sat down to enjoy what we hoped would be a sumptuous meal. Starting with the bhetki fry, we found that an excessive amount of spices including chilli powder had been used. This is a ploy used in second rate eateries to mask the quality of the fish. Neither of us could enjoy the fry and, because of the ‚Äòmasking agents‚Äô, I am not sure whether the fish was really bhetki or a cheaper substitute.

We went on to the malaikari. To be fair to Koshe Kasha, it was quite tasty but the two prawns were medium-sized and , by no stretch of the imagination, could be described as galda. It is daylight robbery for an eatery like Koshe Kosha to charge Rs 500 for two medium-sized prawns.

But the biggest (and most unpleasant ) surprise came at the end when we prepared to tuck into the kosha mangsho. As promised, there were four large pieces but pieces consisted of large bones and no mutton. There was nothing to eat except some gravy!

I have just one question. Does Koshe Kosha cheat all their customers in this way or did they pick on me because I look particularly stupid?

I leave it to you to decide when you‚Äôll go to Koshe Kosha!

This outlet of Koshe Kasha is located at Golpark, in the lane beside the Mouchak sweetshop. It is spread across two floors which can house a total of about 25 people.It has got a unique ambiance of a village house in order to go hand in hand with the cuisine served. Space is a bit on the limited and the low ceiling height on the top floor makes movement difficult. Chairs are not that comfortable. However, all these complaints seem insignificant once the food is served. The quality and quantity of all the dishes is praiseworthy.The mutton preparations are an absolute delight...soft and seem to melt in the mouth. However, considering the space available and the ambiance the prices are a bit on the higher side. But overall, a great place to have those delectable bengali cuisines and one of the very best in its segments!

OK, so it's funny when you are a Bengali, you live in Kolkata, but still for a proper Bengali cuisine you go out to a restaurant... But that is what Koshe Kosha is! Almost a value for money, amazing Bengali food, definitely a place where you take your out of town friends to brag about Bengali food.

The restaurant, though, seems a little claustrophobic to me, & with dark wood finish & small carpet area, so a 4.5 for the joint!

Worth trying: Mooger dal, amsatya-khejur er chutney

I have been fond of Bengali Cuisines and someone suggested this place. 

I must say Koshe Kosha has great ambience with village like feel. Randindra Sangeet playing in background. It also had some art form hung over walls and on legs if table.
But if u are claustrophobic then I would suggest to avoid it is so crammed and have little space to move freely. 

Staff were courteous and promt in service. No question regarding this.

We ordered. 
Bhetki Fish Fry -- which was good. 
Dhokar Dalna --- was average but being a Bengali cuisines speciality restaurant, I was expecting more from them. 
Bhetki Paturi-- was ok.
Kosha Mangsho was great. 
Aam Doi was best of all. It was just amazing. One spoon and I wanted another bowl of it. It was so delicious. 

Overall it was a nice experience.

Easily earns a recommendation from me.

This was a must visit place on my list in Calcutta food destinations and it was worth every bit
The ambience is very raw . Woven reed and driftwood decor gives a sea shack feel. 
The metal works look corroded but non the less well maintained . The two must try items are chingri malayi curry with rice and  chitol peti . Specials are a little on the expensive side but the flavours makes up for it all.  Must visit for all sea food enthusiasts

I ordered rice, moog dal, alu bhaja, mocha chingri and mosola murgi.... all the items were not fresh and tasted very ordinary... and thus the rating get down... later on I tried there same dishes form other outlet I was better there... never the less staffs are good here, service was pretty slow... pocket pinch was considerably high....

More is the craze than the kind of quality or quantity of food they serve. A very ordinary Bengali restaurant. Their Kosha Mangsho was good with soft and tender pieces of mutton. Pulao was equally smooth and delicious. Did not like their Chicken item much. Nevertheless, it'd be a 3 pointer for me!

Today we went here for a total bangaliana lunch. Situated just in the opposite lane of Mouchak,  Koshe Kosha is a good Bengali restaurant full of typical Bengali gastronomic dishes.  We ordered Gondhoraj Ghol,  Bhetki Fry,  Pulao,  Bhetki Paturi, Mutton Kosha, Aam Doi and Baked Rosogolla.  The Gondhoraj Ghol was Awesome, fry was also good,  the taste of the pulao just perfect, paturi being a little dry, but the taste was good and the mutton was a little bitter in taste(perhaps too much use of cinnamon). The deserts were good too.  All in all a good lunch.

Today me n my bf visited this restaurant with high expectations. Bt after enter into the restaurant my expectations was converted to disapointment. The place is very small and shabby. Interior decoration is very cheap. Now we can talk about food quality and quantity. We have ordered gandhoraj ghol,chicken cutlet,polao and kasha mangso. I have highly excitement about kasha mangso. Because i have saw good reviews about kasha mangso on zomato. Bt when i ate this i feel it was not so tasty as others review about it. Anyway,now i tell u about polao. It was totally a tasteless dish. Chicken cutlet was not so tasty. Lastly i tell about gondhoraj ghol. It was different from other dahi lassi. The flavour of gandhoraj lebu give it a heavenly taste. The quantity of food is enough for one people. For my site i rate KOSHE KOSHA 1.5 out of 5

More is the craze of the restaurant than is their ambience,quantity or quality. A very small,ordinary restaurant opposite to Aminia Golpark, with relatively no as such glamorous Bong feeling and the staff was not pleasing either. We ordered their Pulao, Dhakai Mangsho, Kosha Mangsho, Mosla Murgi and i won't say the taste wasn't good, but being a Bong we except something even more grand when we go for Bengali cuisine outside than our commonplace home made preparation. Quantity is very less compared to their price,and in all the restaurant couldn't satisfy our Ashtami expectations of dinner :D

This is a very over priced place, as coming to taste of food for which it is popular, as in Kosha Mangsho, me and my friends tried that out this pujo, firstly was difficult to get seats, when we finally did get the seats, the food was a big let down. The Kosha mangsho is "over" kosha, to the extent it tastes very bitter, very oily as well. it was soft but i would never order kosha mangsho in this joint again. Ottonto beshi koshano r tito tito khete pathar mangsho, and i am sure many will agree to this. ¬†Coming to the popular polau, its not done in kesar bt yellow food color has been used, whole spices and some dry fruits cashews mainly and taste was very good more to the sweet side than salted, but looking at the yellow colouring, makes me never want to order it again. holud rong meshano basanti polau. Tried the masala murgi, the gravy was oily, very tasty just like most oily foods are, but the chicken was not fresh, felt like stored and refrigerated. My friends and i are big foodies, we know the difference of taste of a fresh chicken and a not so fresh one. Those who dont get the difference, not gonna talk abt them, bt the masala murgi was absolutely not fresh. Heavy taxing and over priced low on quality taste and use of food colours makes me rate this not as one of the authentic bengali restaurants. Ambiance and decor was good, but quality should have been as per pricing.

We visited the restaurant during the wee hours on navami. We sat upstairs at a table for four. The ambience was awesome with soothing lighting,puja music and woodwork.

We ordered pulao, dhakai mangsho, kosha mangsho and aam doi. Taste was incredible. But the quantity of a plate of pulao was not enough to feed a mouth. Same goes for aam doi. I had a gala time and ate till my heart's content. Loved the taste but need more quantity per plate.

The behaviour of the restra staff was very good and polite unlike most other restaurants in the town. I guess this needed a special mention.

It was saptami night & our group of 8 decided to try our luck at getting into a restaurant without a wait line. To our surprise koshekosha was available. We had been lucky, coz by the time we finished it was nearly a small mob trying to get in.
Well the place is a bit small, interiors nicely done with all the woven straw mats & Palmyra hand-fans on the wall.
Coming to the food, we ordered moshla murgi, kosha mangsho, macher matha diye daal ,rice, ruti and alu bhaja.
Each and every item was tasty. Moshla murgi was excellent, the mutton was just the right amount soft. The ruti however more resembled a parota than plain atta ruti.
They also had this complimentary paan to sum it up.
Overall a very good experience.
Will visit soon.

Good place if you are a true bong food lover.They have limited menu..but the food is good.I visited the jadavpur branch on panchami(they haven't updated on zomato as yet). The restaurant isn't that much spacious.
The gandhoraj ghol was refreshing..less sweet.Moshla murgi is a bit spicy and oily but the pieces were good.The dhakai mangsho (mutton) was too good.Specially if you have it with roti.They ¬†give tamarind sauce too ,seperately and it's good.The pulao was a bit sweet but it complimented the meat well.
Everything was cooked well,quality is good.the bill including vat,service tax was less than 900 for three.
So quite an affordable place :)

Beautiful decor.
And equally beautiful food.

My mom is an excellent cook. So I never have Bengali cuisine outside home. Whenever I tried, I was never satisfied. But the Golpark Koshe Kosha was a different story.

I was sceptical about eating there on a Puja day because, from what I remembered, their food used to be very oily and heavy. But this time, I was pleasantly surprised at finding a number of other options, apart from the Kosha Mangsho and Porota. The Gondhoraj Murgi was beautiful and light. And the Sona Moong Dal was light and homely. Their ghol was as good as my mom's. Well, almost.

My only complaint: I wish they didn't make rotis with flour. A little cold and they became rather tough. Rotis are supposed to be made with wholewheat and remain nice and soft even when cold. I wish they hadn't screwed around with that.

The portions weren't great. But they were fine for three small-eaters, so we were pretty glad about that, since we didn't leave feeling overstuffed. The quality wasn't compromised on, although we visited during the Puja rush.

The bill came to INR 626.

All in all, a good experience.

Visited the place for lunch last Saturday... It's near Golpark mouchak... Bang opposite Aminia. 
Due to lack of space the restaurant feels really cramped. It has two floors... The first floor is really low roofed. You have to be careful while you move around. 
But all these does not affect the food experience... We had baked paratha, mosla murgi and prawn cutlet. All the items were well made and tasty.... Even the kasundi... Just the right amount of heat (jhajh). 
Sad part was that in the menu had Nolengurer icecream... But sadly it was not available... Would like to have it next time.. 
Staff was very courteous and helpful...

Excellent Bengali food ! The prices are decent, delivery via Zomato is mighty quick.

Their mutton dishes are very well cooked, succulent and soft. Luchi is good and so are the rice dishes.

Recco: Kosha Mangsho, Pulao, Mocha Chingri.

Not the best atmosphere, but still a good place to have Bengali cuisine. It's situated just opposite to aminia golpark. We ordered ala carte; food was ok. Specially we enjoyed the chingri maach er malaikari..it was awesome !!

5 of us went for the Sunday lunch there today, the day before Mahalaya 2015. As expected the space crunched jaunt was choc-a-bloc. We ordered 5 non veg thalis and aam pora sherbet which wasn't available. To our utter disappointment they were serving in meagre portions from the same bowl of rice,dal and Shukto to all 5 of us,despite us ordering separate thalis for each individual. We felt disgusted at their blatant shortchanging of customers that we at one pointconsidered storming out or parading the manager who could be nowhere spotted. How could they think of thriving in the service industry by so evidently hoodwinking customers.
We made our point and they were polite enough to serve individually the remaining items that followed.
The food wasn't bad though which saved the temper from rising! Mochar ghonto and katlar kalia were really palatable. The bill for 5 thalis was approx 2700 INR.
Never going back there. Too bad we opted for Koshe Kosha over Kasturi which was just a few blocks ahead.

The interior decor was worth noticing, gave the feeling of a bengal village, the service was very good, food was served with 10-15 mins.
The Moshla Murgi and Muri Ghonto was tasty, but obviously it was not like the home-made ones, was a bit spicy though, overall the experience was good.

My First time experience with this restaurant was really very bad but today in the celebration of their 10th Anniversary I visited again and my experience today is very satisfying. Updating my review after today's visit. 28. 8.17
As they are giving offer on a variety of dishes within only 149 RS , so the place was very crowded when we reached. After waiting in a long queue we finally got our table after 1 hour. But the quality of foods they served us compensate all the waiting time. Our today's order was,
* Basanti Pulao
* Gondhoraj Muri
* Kosha Mangso
* Aam Doi
* Baked Rasogolla
The service was very prompt. We were served all the foods at a time and we happily started our lunch. Basanti Pulao tasted pretty good with perfect balance of sweetness and it was aromatic with flavors. Quantity was good for sharing between two people. Gondhoraj Chicken tasted really yummy which was served in a white sweetish gravy. Kosha mangso was a delicious dish with a thicker gravy. In case of both the Chicken and Mutton dishes 4 pieces each was served. In dessert aam doi is worth mentionable. Mango flavored doi tasted too good. Baked Rasogolla was also tasty. All these cost only 572 RS including 18% GST. Overall our today's food journey was definitely a great one. Recommend for all Bengali food lovers. Go and Grab the offers. You will Surely have a great food experience in a very affordable price.

After trying Mughlai and Awadhi food for few weeks at a stretch, this week I decided to go back to authentic Bengali cuisine. Here is what I feel about Koshe Kosha :

Ambience 3.5/5 : simplistic, rustic and like village hut. ¬†I will not say it is mindblowing, but at least they have paid attention to details while decorating it

Food 4/5 : I was bit too greedy and from my previous experience with Bhojohori Manna, I expected the quantity to be in the similar range. And therefore, I ordered a lot and finally ended up having so many dishes.¬†
The basanti Pulao and ghee bhaat both are very good. Gondhoraj Mangsho in chicken is worth a try. it is very good and chicken pieces are nice too. Dhakai Mangsho is a sure recommendation. Mutton was very well cooked.¬†
I tried a Vetki fry as well, but like many other fish fries in other places, the fish sheet was too thin and the outer layer dominated the taste.¬†
I tried Aam doi as well. it is a nice one.¬†

Price : The price is not high. But it is not 550 bucks for 2 people either. I agree that you will perhaps not eat as much I did :-), but still it will cost you more if you just dont restrict yourself to a thali. The one I mentioned above plus couple of veg dishes (shukto, dorma, dhoka and aloo bhaja) cost me 1600 bucks.¬†

I will recommend if you are looking for good Bengali cuisine in medium price range. Enjoy your food !! and if you could ¬†eat more than what I did, just drop me a note :-)

Ambiance: I liked the simplistic decor, with an attempt to make it look like the inside of a village-hut of Bengal.

Service: Brilliant is the word. Really helpful, and professional.

Food: The best part. Polao was cooked to perfection- not too much sweetened and not much oily- best I've ever tasted in a restaurant. Kosha Murgi was another item to be delighted about- with big pieces of chicken and tasty gravy. Both their quality and quantity surprised us in a good way.¬†

Yes, would like to go back to try other items from the menu.

I am personally very much fond of this place. Though it's located at a very prominent location in Golpark, yet people tend to miss it. Ambience is good but legspace is a constraint. But food is an absolute delight. Be it polao or chicken or pabda fish preparation or mutton or prawn preparation... I love them all. I have been there on multiple occasions, they have never disappointed me. They even provide home delivery. Anyways its a must for all foodieals

Here's a nerdy review in Q&A format.

Where is it?
It's near Golpark, opposite Ralli's. It's on the road exactly opposite Mouchak.

Claim to fame?
Excellent Bengali food.

Why should I go?
Because you probably won't get better Tel Koi anywhere else. Their food is mouthwatering! Their sona-mug er daal is a MUST if you go there. Make sure you order a plate of aloo bhaja to go. I tried their kosha mutton. It was tasty but a bit undercooked. Their Chingri'r malaycurry as well Fish fry are also worth your time and money.

Because the decor is nice. The pictures x lightning, furniture and the music tries to create than rustic bangali ambience. Good selection of rabindrasangeet to keep you humming while you wait for your food.

Because of their prompt service. Helpful waiters offer good advice if you ask for it.

Because of their value for money. Better food than Kosturi and Bhojori and better prices than both!

Any drawbacks?
They take a long time to serve you your food. They say it's because they make everything fresh but still. They should work on that.

And that ceiling, dear lord. If you are a tall guy/gal, be careful when you're walking or standing. It's uncomfortably low.

Who should you take?
Family and Friends. Not the best place for a date, me thinks.

My verdict?
I recommend it! I'll be back!

Kolkata has largely seen a rise of authentic Bengali food restaurants starting from the likes of Bhajohari Manna, Bhooter raja dilo bor, 16 ana bangali.....and now Koshe Kosha is the latest addition to these categories of restaurants who dares to serve Bengalis in their own cities with authentic Bengali cuisine and I must admit Koshe Kosha came to me much as a surprise. Right from the ambiance to the catchy and completely new outlook of the menu card design with funny and humorous taglines, this place gave me a very good vibe just as I entered the place. The ambiance is very unique and very classy, the AC is more than comfortable, the seating arrangements are good and dimly lit to give a good feel of the place. The staff were very good and courteous. The food menu is wide and diversified and names itself will bring water to your mouth if you simply like Bengali food. I had the best Mutton Curry till date of all Bengali restaurants. The prawn is available but in limited quantity. At crunch times, the prawn gets replenished but mutton chicken and other fishes are always available. Like most of the places I foind these days, the food takes considerable amount of time to reach the table and hence I would suggest to order the food as fast as possible.

I would highly recommend this place if you are in for some authentic Bengali food.....

On my next visit, it was the pulao and mutton kasha which still lingers in my taste buds.
With the Bengali theme of the place, the place is recommended for a full fledged expensive Bengali lunch.

Authentic Bengali Cuisine. Its just aptly taglined. I had the best Tel Koi ever. The Sona Muger Dal, rice and Pulao were fine as well. The Mutton Kosha was cooked well.
Ambience was a good gram bangla one as you can see from the snaps.
Over all, its a definite go again and again place for Bengali Food and there is a big IF as to why i could not give them 4.5/5 stars. 
The mutton pieces were pretty tough, they could have been softer. Same was with the Koi fish. It was pretty hard as well.

Pros:
Good Ambience (3/5)
Good sitting (3/5)
Good Food (4/5; even after the hard mutton & fish pieces, the preparation and gravy was so fine that I had to give 4 stars)
Price (4/5; Value for Money)

Cons:
Height of the upper floor is pretty low. Its hard for anyone above 5.5 ft to stand up, if ever you need to.
Fish and Meat are probably kept deeply frozen and a quick cook does'nt make it soft. They need to work on that.

Such a lovely place it is! The first thing you will notice is a very earthy Bengali feeling! Very authentic and warm.¬†

We went on a Sunday. Its at Golpark and at a very convenient location, beside Mouchak and just opposite Aminia.¬†

I went during Hilsa festival. They have limited but interesting Hilsa preparation.¬†

We ordered rice, alu bhaja. Bhetki fry with prawn, sona moong daal, Hilsa posto and Hilsa paturi. We also had pineapple chutney.¬†

The food preparation is absolutely amazing and very authentic. The quantity of food is pretty decent. ¬†Food is completely fresh and they serve it hot.¬†

One thing we didnt like was the taste of Hilsa. Though we can not blame the restaurant for the same, probably it was the person who purchased the fish didnt really check on the quality. The Hilsa aroma and taste was missing.

Though I would love going back there simply because of their authentic taste.

The service is excellent - very prompt and warm.

Bong feeling... I must say... Small in size... Tastefully Bengal village decor... Nice ambience and you are there for what !! Well kasha mangso of course... Rice? Perfect and smells amazing... They have given us Thor bata and alu bhaja with ghee... There will always be a heart warming feeling for Bengali's if they get "gorom ghee bhat".. Feel awesome..After that... That kosha mangso... Yummmm... A place to try and die for... And don't compare with other restaurant which serves Bengali food... Its a bit different and definitely a honest approach towards customer with excellent service...

Located at golpark ,opposite to Amenia, you are greeted with soulful bengali classics being played in the background as you enter this place,ordained & decorated in the quintessential era of bengal during its hay days...Ambiance,as mentioned above is real fab.Service wise I was let down major as it seemed they were in a hurry to force us to eat fast and pay the tab and make a move,I mean one goes to a place chills aswl ,its not a 100 m race and neither are we freeloaders,such was the sad attitude of the staff.

Food::¬†
Starter- we order fish kabiraji & mutton cutlet, the kabiraji had a thick bugger of battered butter as you crush through it the fish fillet topped up relinquishes your hunger alongside the cutlet which was a trademark bengali fav had the right twist to it for one to ask for mordae. We topped it up with sweet lime sodas.

¬†Coming to the main course we stuck to ¬†Dhakai Mangsho and rotis aswl as paranthas,firstly the roti & paranthas were not served hot but yes the mangsho surely made up for it with its delicious¬†succulent pieces churning of a lovely spiced up tale of utter awesomeness once you taste the meat and the spices ingrained in them.For desserts we stuck to Aam Doi which was a perfect end to the foodgasm....As for the pocket pinch it came to 850 (exclusive taxes) for 3

I ordered Gondho rraj ghol which was nice, and somewhere I have read that Kosha mangsho and Kochi pathar jhol is one of the best and being a mutton lover I had no choice than to order these two items from the menu.¬†

But I would say that highly disappointed on the Kosha mangsho, the taste was just not that great, the mutton pieces were ample on the dish but did not taste good. Kochi pathar jhol, sorry to say but I did not notice anything kochi out here. This dis also did not taste good enough . The next was mosla murgi which was sort of OK.

A bong village ambience adds the tadka to the flavours of the bong dishes served here. The food is so good, cooked light. I loved the kosha mangsho, aam panna, channa r dalna. 
Posto r bora was the superhit.

The slightly above average reviews made us to give it a try... 

The bengali decor is ok but ultimate experience and delight comes from the quality of food and service. But were quite disappointed on every front.

we had ordered the non-veg thali and surprisingly everything which came in was not fresh and at least a days old. Right from the Rice, dal, mutton and pulao, everything was at room temperature and WAS NOT FRESHLY COOKED.

The service was quite slow, and waiters were quite arrogant and that showed in their body language.

Wanted to visit this outlet of koshe kosha for long. Finally I made it. Well, beginning with the ambience, its delightful! The quintessential bangali d√©cor and the melodious rabindrasangeet in the background, its romantic and delicate. Coming to the food, the kawsha mangsho is rich, luscious but the rotis are a bit chewy. Price is moderate and affordable. Give it a try. It won't disappoint you.

A few years ago, when Koshe Kasha opened for the first time, I had read about it in the newspaper and was interested. But at that time the only outlet was Hatibagan, where we go occasionally, so I knew it would take sometime before I could get a taste of it.
Then came an opportunity. There was a food festival at Nalban and I went there together with two of my colleagues. After browsing through the stalls, I saw this stall where the entrepreneur himself was sitting in wait for us. We went to it and spoke to him. He was glad that I had prior knowledge of his outlet and gave us comfortable seats. We had mutton kasha paratha combo there. It was delicious and added to it, not very oily or spicy. In fact, after having food, when we washed our hands, we were surprised that oil or yellowish spicy stain did not remain in our fingers.
I was really happy that it opened its outlet at Golpark, which is near to my home. We have visited there much. The small restaurant is neat and beautifully decorated. Gives a Bengali atmosphere. The staff is very courteous. Food quality is perfect. Added to it, I often had Aam pora  sherbet and daab ice cream and nolen gur ice cream and my father loved going there.

It was my friend's treat. We both had a wonderful experience together. He brought me to an unkown joint called Koshe Kosha. Very Bangaliana look yet earthly and sober that you want to enter and discover how it is actually. The place was empty and staff was courtious. We got our private time and photo moment together. The seating arrengement was like inside a hut, feels good.

We ordered for Pulao, Aam porar sorbot, Mutton Kasha, and Aam Kasungi Chingri.

Everything was good, I can say more than I expected. I gave it 4 out of 5. My friend is not here around with me now, but whenever I come to this place, I cherish it.

A quaint bengali food joint in an otherwise hustling street of golpark.. if you want to enjoy a good bengali meal in a quiet and beautiful ambience then this is the place to be. I went to this place on a rain washed aftrnoon and superrr liked the decor.. too much of bangaliana with wooden chairs, table legs with owl motifs, little wall spaces (kulungi in bngali..can be seen in old houses), lanterns hanging.. with soft and proper lighting to have the place a warm vibe.. coming to the food, we've ordered bhetki paturi, polao, luchi, kochi patha r mangsho and baked rosogolla. The paturu was okay. Polao is good. The mutton was very tasty and yumm.. baked rosogolla was average. All in all good food.
The service is good and the waiters are also very soft spoken.. 
All in all a beautifully done quiet place to have a lazy bengali meal...

This is one place to savour the delicious Kosha mangsho -- a favourite of every Bengali. Their Kasha mangsho is to die for. The taste is superb. I combined it with their polao which was complimenting so well. The aam pora sarbat is another good order.. for starters, bhetki fry and chingri cutlet are good options. The ambience is very nice and has an earthy feeling to it. Service was quick and prices are reasonable. A must visit place

A very down to earth restaurant indeed which gives one a perfect rural picture of Bengal with mud on its walls and the chairs and dishes in the village style too.The only problem here is that the ceiling above is a little too low for the customers to stand.The food was very nice indeed giving the taste of good bengali spices and preparations.

Tucked off Golpark, this rustic designed Bengali outlet is an experience. Authentic and boisterous, Koshe Koshe is a worthy addition to the Bengali food connoisseurs pallette. The kosha mangsho is an absolute delight so is the dhakai version. The staff is helpful and the wait not too long. Koshe Kosha is the place to be this weekend.

Went for dinner for the first time tonight at this Golpark joint and I was pretty disappointed. The ambience is good and the staff are courteous,and the service prompt. We ordered for the non veg thali and a bhetki fry alongwith Aam pora sharbat. The drink wasn't cold at all though it tasted good, the bhetki fry was fine.The biggest let down were the fish and mutton in the thali. The fish tasted very stale,as if it was kept on refrigeration for atleast 2weeks before being cooked. The gravy of the mutton was completely dark and tasted of burnt spices. The pulao wasn't appetizing either. The veg dishes were nice. Another disappointment was the "baked" rasogolla, which didn't seem to be baked and was extremely sweet. Wad thoroughly dissatisfied with my first venture. Maybe the ala carte would have been better.

I am not particularly in favour of going to bengali restaurants because my mother cooks amazing bengali food but still I had a go just to break the tradition.
I liked the name of the place and the decor is nice enough, they have tried to have the whole matir-bari feel.
Coming to the food, it was noting extraordinary and I don't think that the price is reasonable.
There is this complementary kochu-bala that they serve which is very good and the bhetki r paturi is also pretty good.
But otherwise , the food is pretty ordinary and the service is slow.
If you have a bengali restaurant in Bengal I think you have to try much harder to win people over.Can be tried for dishes which cannot be made easily enough at home but I don't know if they will be upto the mark.
Not happy with it in particular.

This place near Golpark CCD deserves a special mention for its authentic Bengali decor and created ambience. Great attention to detail can be seen when the interiors are closely observed. The place is quite small though.¬†
Having been there many times with friends and family, must try menu items have included Basanti Pulao, Gondhoraj Mangsho/Murgi, Kosha Mangsho, Kochi Pathar Jhol, Dhakai Mangsho. Their mutton dishes are superb. So is their Baked Porotha, perfecly flaky and oil-free. Their Baked Rasogolla and Anaraser Chutney is good too!
Their service is amazing with the servers having sound knowledge of the dishes and capable to recommend in times of crisis!

I went to Koshe Kosha with my family including a 2 and half year old. Its location is good, just a stone throw away from Golpark. Service was just ok and all the food that was ordered were brought together, and there were hardly any space left on the table. The waiters are friendly, but poor in giving suggestion on quantity and how spicy a dish would be. We ended up ordering too much veg dishes. The veg dishes are all very spicy with ordinary  taste. I found Sukto too sweet, the Mocha too hot, Dal too much. We ordered Kochi Pathar Jhol, which was too simple to be served at a place called Koshe Kosha. Although the Gandhoraj Chicken was very tasty, as per my wife. We were served with too much veg items to try more on the non-veg side. Decor is good, space limited. Washroom door too tight. Can be tried once.

What are great rainy Sundays made of - the answer has to be a sumptuous bengali meal. Comforting and delightful. So me and my pishi planned to come here. Listed right opposite Aminia near golpark on the lane having many more restaurants like Tinny da dhaba and a chinese restaurant i dont remember the name of. As you enter the room is not that big but they have upstair dining as well. We ordered Aam pora sorbot which was a tad sweet to our liking but was ok. The Bhetki paturi, 2 pieces of it was also ok. A little more sharpness and a better cooked fish would have been better. We planned to have Kosha mangsho but the waiter claimed that the Dhakai mangsho was better eaten with sada bhaat. The mutton was good but not what we expected. Overall a good experience but could have been much much better.

Intro: Situated at Golpark, near Mouchak, opposite to Aminia.
Enter and you would feel you are in a typical village  mud hut ! Good decor, lot of usage of what we call "madur" . Overall great ambience.
The place is quite small!
Food : 
Aamar chop - Crispy, served with mustard sauce, average 3/5
Mochar ghonto - Just fantastic , loved it, quality of mocha was excellent and also the preparation 4.5/5
Sons muger dal - Fine, ghee used. I would have wanted to have without ghee to understand how good the preparation was....( usually if you put ghee in any bengali prep.  the dish tastes nice ) 3.5/5
Jhuri alu bhaja - Usual 3.5/5
Steamed Rice - Long grain- Very good quality
-4/5
Katla Kalia -  liked the preparation, quality of fish good  3.5/5
Doi Ilish - Excellent preparation, we enjoyed every bit of it ! 4/5
Pabdar Jhal - I didn't like the preparation, the jhal tasted too much sour , curd was not used, guess overdose of tomato 2.5/5
Moshla murgi - Awesome, chicken preparation with curd - curry was fantastic - chicken pieces were a bit small though, nonetheless excellent 4/5
Kosha mangsho - I don't have mutton , but my wife didn't like it - tasted a bit bitter 2.5/5
Chatni - Aamer Chatni was excellent 4/5
Baked Rosogolla - Very nice 4/5
Service - Excellent 4/5
Overall - Very good - though some areas of improvement there 4/5

This place contains Kasha in its moniker that is really appealing to all Bengalis. After which person doesn't like Kasha curries? 
The place has been decorated in a rural Bengali home-style with very dark lighting. It gives you a good Bengali feel as you enter the place. I ordered the Gondhoraj Chicken since it sounded really fancy with slivers of Gondhoraj lemon leaves and pulao. The items were brought to us in plastic serving bowls that doesn't really gel-well with the environment. Nonetheless, we tried the dishes with condiments of achaar, lemon and chilli. Gondhoraj chicken was light and creamy with a barely-there hint of Gondhoraj but the chicken pieces were not particularly succulent. Pulao was light, sweet and well, fluffy. Both of them complemented each other well but it wasn't something absolutely special. I ordered Baked Rasogolla for desserts. It came to my table piping hot and it was too sweet for my liking, but the rasogollas were soft and spongy as they should be. 
Overall, the food can be considered to be above par and the staff  and service okayish enough.

. Just about one and a half hours ago, I purchased three items namely posto bora, Shukto & muri ghonto for lunch. To my utter surprise, the posto bora was stale and smelt terrible, the Shukto was sour and the Muri ghonto was just a casual mixture of moog daal with fish head and a bit of cooked rice. 
My advise for prospective customers would be to stay away from such deceit.

What a mistake to choose this restaurant as a birthday celebration. After ordering, we had to wait over 75 minutes to be served. The food is expensive and very mediocre, in fact most dishes were given between 1 to 1.5 on a 1 to 10 scale. Our entire lunch took almost three hours to finish and it wasn't just us complaining, almost very table had heated exchanges with the servers. This restaurant is a complete waste of time so don't say you have not been warned.

Best Part of this Restaurant is its ambience, the food comes not so close second. Yes, some of the food, like the Kosha Mangsho and some Chingri dishes are good but it ends immediately here. Prices are a tad on the higher side, quantity quite low in comparison. Coming back to the food, not much of novelty, its rather run of the mill & the aforementioned dishes are just about the saving grace of the chain's reputation...or perhaps the lack of it!

I haven't visited many purely Bengali cuisine restaurants, but even as a standalone place, Koshe Kosha isn't that bad a choice. Compared to all the well known places serving Bengali food, Koshe Kosha hasn't gained much popularity probably because of their high price to quantity ratio.
Located opposite the Golpark Aminia, the decor of the restaurant is that of an old village hut. The interior is small with low ceilings. The atmosphere is more or less cozy. The typical food available are luchi aloo dum, kosha mangsho, mutton kasha, ghee bhaat. The taste is quintessentially that of home cooked Bengali food.
It's not a place I would recommend for the sake of experimentation, but that's perhaps because I'm a Bengali. However, if you want to taste some Bengali food, Koshe Kosha and Tero Parbon are good options in South Kolkata.

Being close to my home, this place serves as an ideal take-out joint for those lazy Sunday brunches where you invite guests over but are hardly in a mood to cook or go out. We haven't tried a lot from the menu here but Kosha Mangsho and the Pulao are highly recommended. 
The Fish Fry is pretty average. The marinade could do with more aroma and the fish with more meat. 
The preparation of Moccha that they have is decent enough and I find it spiced the right amount. 

Drop in and give it a try. It will make a fairly decent impression, I hope.

We ordered from Koshe Kosha on Mother's day since it seemed an interesting option for bengali food which my grandmom favours. In the end it turned out to be a good choice.
We asked for delivery and while it took some time, that can explained by a destination out of the usual way, so not many complaints there.
Items ordered were Dhokar Dalna, Bhetkir Paturi, Pulao and Mutton Dhakai.
The first three items were excellent. Well seasoned and spiced without being overpowering. The pulao was especially quite fragrant and light. The only complaint would be that the mutton wasn't very tender but the curry was in keeping with the rest of the food. So A for both service and food.
Looking forward to trying more dishes from Koshe Kosha.

Last Saturday afternoon as Calcutta's heat was soaring high we were busy keeping our tummy satisfied at Koshe Kosha. Located in a convenient place at Golpark opposite to Southern Aminia , the decor is decent enough to please our eyes. Neither extravagant nor clumsy. We had ordered for aam porar shorbot and it was nice. As a starter we ordered for fish fries a little off the track order in a bengali restaurant but the fish was good and well fried. For the main course we had ordered for rice, dal , bhetki paturi, parshe and golda chingri malaikari. The quantity sufficed all of us. The bill was okay given the number of people (4 people and 1 child) and the number of dishes we had ordered. The service is good but i felt they took a little time to serve. Nevertheless it was a good experience.

visited the restaurant yesterday with family, I had ordered fish fry, dhakai mutton, alurdom, begun bhaja and dal with rice. The behaviour of the waiters were ok, I found it slightly unfriendly. ¬†The decor was just ok nothing great to speak about. The rates for the food are exorbitant when you compare it other restaurants of such stature. The quantities are minuscule. ¬†The alurdom was ok but the ¬†mutton was half done and when i informed the waiter about this he was totally non chalant. I do not recommend it at all

5 years back koshe kosha opened a stall in bidhannagar mela and there stall was the most popular among the food stalls that year. They served kosha mangsho and luchi/paratha and other fried items like fish fry, fish kabiraji chicken kabiraji and so on. Then after few years I saw that they have opened a branch in golpark just opposite Aminia. The place has nice Bengali decor with hathpakkha and aloo a wall art but the best thing is still the kosha mangsho and fish kabiraji. My brother loves eating outside food hence we do end up taking parcel for him when he is not in the mood for Chinese or Indian tandoor food.

They specialise in kosha mangsho and paratha. That is what they serve best. They have expanded their menu considerably over the years to cater to a wider range of clients. Most of thise added dishes are good. Among other mutton options, the gandhoraj mangsho is the best. Their yellow pulao and baked paratha are good. Bhetki paturi is also very tasty. Their baked rasgulla and aam doi are a must try! Always had a good experience at this place.

The food is too yummy I must say...but the quantity is not up to the mark though the taste is great. Me and my friend went on poila baishak 1422..and had a great lunch by ordering first the cool chatpata aam pora shorbot, then came the plain rice along with sona mung daal, aloo bhaja, dhakai mangsho, anarosher chutney and last but not the least aam doi. The daal was superb...better than the chicken..! I don't have so much rice but I couldn't resist myself that day. The final refreshment with the mishti paan is simply extraordinary! Loved it...though the menu was limited that day..would love to visit again for more of those mouth watering delicacies!!!

on poila baisakh this year (1422), we decided to have bengali delicacy in the dinner. so my wife ordered from koshe kosha, which is situated at golpark (near mouchak).
we ordered basanti polao, chitol machher muittha, kochi panthar jhhol and tomato-posto bhetki (special item for poila baisakh). i was surprised to find the amount of polao to be the double than what i generally get from the direct competitions (bhajohori/sholo ana). kochi panthar jhhol was very light and the meet was very tender and well cooked. chitol machher muittha was typical, nothing extraordinary but what bowled me over was the bhetki item which was very unique in taste.
overall, the food was very much enjoyed by all the family members. i will surely order from them again.

Very bad experience. Poor service . quality of food is also not up to the mark . highly disappointed . my first and last visit . other Bengali cuisine restaurants like bhojo hori manna is far better than this place . it was a big mistake for me and my family to go and try out this new restaurant . the place is also too small . AC 's not working properly , tables placed just beside the bathroom . it is just awful . I would suggest others not to go to this place especially the golpark branch . it is totally a waste of money .

Ambience is good, and has a great location. But the service is pathetic. The place is small so gets filled up easily during festive seasons, and the waiters take a lot of time to take the order and serve the food. We tried the dhakai mangsho, it was awesome and everyone should try it once. Bhapa ilish was really good but a little bit expensive.......basanti polau was good, and Kosha Mutton was great too. Dont forget to try aam doi after meal.

The interior decor is very unique. Kind of a old village look. The quality of the good is authentic. I ate dhakai mangsho, kosha mangso, lal keema with baked parota. Each item is unique in test. But I think it's slightly overpriced comparing the amount you get in one serving.

Though have to wait for a bit longer but worth every penny as food was upto the expectation. After all Bengali cuisine so waiting is must in order to relish the flavour.

We ordered a new dish called Vetki Chingrir melbondhon is nice & we had tried Gondhoraj Mutton is awesome.
Lastly its all good from my side i will¬†definitely go to Kose Kosa (Golpark)
Only thing which I have to say when we entered in the¬†restaurant played old hindi bollywood songs , its nice but if they tried some old bengali songs its more wonderful.

Koshe Kosha is a small place ¬†opposite Aminia in Golpark. I had been hearing good reviews of this place from various places, especially from a Delhi based blog. We had reached Kolkata the same day, and after barely dumping our luggage in our neighborhood flat we set out for the food journey. 

As you enter the place, you find the dark interiors of the restaurant a bit surprising. The place is nicely decorated though, with artefacts from rural Bengal. We ordered quickly and the restaurant responded by a short turnaround time.

The Gondhoraj ghol here is a perfect start to any meal. The prized lemon provides a endearing aroma to the ghol. Bhetki Chingrir Melbondhon was a fish fry with a layer of prawn it. It was decent, though I would have liked the prawn content to be a bit more.

Luchi and Kasha Manghsho which is one of their signature combos was nothing great. I have had better Kosha Mangsho (Bengali saut√©ed mutton) even in the Hyderabad Bengali eateries.¬†

The gravy in Chital Macher Muitha could not delight us ‚Äì mainly because the onion and garlic in the gravy was not saut√©ed well, and gave out a raw taste. Sorshe Ilish was nice, though I was not happy with the size of the Hilsa fish.¬†

Service was not very enterprising. The dishes arrived fast, but we had to call out repeatedly for mundane things like refilling our water.

Meal for three costed us around Rs 1400.

Everything is excellent except the food. Every item that we ordered were good, except the non-veg items. The dhakai mutton was too salty, and the pieces were bones. Chicken dishes were super oily. Pulao, gondhoraj ghol were very good in taste. Bhetki paturi was also very good.
Next time I'll think thrice before ordering non veg curry based items.

When I first came to this restaurant I had an amazing experience. The food was great. The service was perfect and the over all experience was amazing. Today when I returned there with my mother it was the opposite. The potatoes in the mutton curry had gone bad. The pieces of mutton were too small. Certainly not worth 150‚Çπ. The mutton fell apart when touched and had a stale smell. The chicken was starting to go bad. Almost like a chewing gum. The taste was ok. All in all the whole thing was awful. It was a pity that this place served amazing food a month ago. Did we catch the chef on a bad day or something we'll never know.

Its the place for Bongs exclusively.Koshe Kosha is primarily known for its Mutton Kosha,but it was a big disappointment for us.Nevertheless,there are other stuffs to try out.We tried Bhetki Paturi,and it was upto the mark.Thumbs up for that.Basanti or misti Pulao was'nt upto the mark when you compare it with one of their rivals or competitors," Bhojo Hori Manna".
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Coming to Decor and ambiance,its artistic.Bong vibes in the decor.Nothing much to say.It was not an awesome experience for the belly,though not worst.Its good.Since it was a one time visit for us,so I am not commenting much on the food.Will look forward,for some delicious and satisfying belly experience in future.

In golpark bang opposite aminia, this eatery was long pending in my list and was almost forgotten until my wife asked casually how about Koshe Kosha for the anniversary dinner? I jumped and booked a table for 8 of us for the following day. 

Parking was easy to find, people were courteous, since this was a Bengali food place and ppl were so courteous my parents and in laws totally felt at home, which they normally don't since they don't like to eat outside. 

We started with chingri bhetkir melbondhon ... And that cutlet was simply amazing... Some of us went for non veg thali, veg thali, along with chitol macher muithya which was awesome as well. The dhakai mangsho was great too. Over all not all the items were top of the class but their specialities which were asked for were really special. So tip get in ... Ask what's special today and try that out

Bangalees old acquaintance with "kosha" is evergreenly memorable... Be it puronodiner kotha or kosha. Kosha kosha is located pretty convinietly giving authentic flavour of bangalee-ana. Lovely authentic bangalee food like mishti pulao with kosha pathar mangsho or chicken gondhoraj rocks.As starter bhetki fry fish fry and mochar chop/chingri cutlet and paturis as side dish are impressive. ilish is good if not divine .plain rice with morighanta is too good. Food u can say 4/5 but the decor is impressive. Authentic bengalee pot shilpo jamini ray paintings and lather putul... Decor is 4.8/5.Daab ice cream though is not utterly ice cream but highly recommended if u r game for fusion food

Today when both spouses go out for work and cooking is mostly left to domestic helps, a plate of gratifying Bangali khabar is hard to get. 
Koshe Kosha is a place where you can satisfy your desire for quintessentially Bengali food. The hotel has elaborately-detailed rustic-Bengal interiors and ambience. The name of the hotel is derived from the iconic North Kolkata Kosha Mangsho of Golbari. 

Special dishes of the outlet includes:-

¬†¬†¬† Kosha Mangsho
¬†¬†¬† Ghondhoraj chicken
¬†¬†¬† Aam Ada Chop
¬†¬†¬† Chingri biriyani
¬†¬†¬† Roshun bhapa bhetki

Lets face it. Its a copy of Golbari so you are only going to order luchi and kosha mangsho. And if you like it enough you will come back to this place and order the same thing again.
This is the exact problem Koshe Kosha suffers from. Don't get me wrong. The luchi and kosha mangsho is great. But ask me about the other things on their menu and i have no clue. Most people would give the same answer.
While the call of the mansho luchi combination is enticing, you will probably not visit this restaurant more than 3 times in a year(possibly even lesser). This restaurant needs more variety in their menu and needs to attract customers with a dish other than the already famous combo.
The service isn't the best either.
If you are craving the famous golbari meat and luchi and you stay really far away from Shyambazar, definitely check out this place. How often you come back will determine how much progress Koshe Kosha has made from the time i went there last.

Koshe kosha is a copy of the iconic Golbari in Shyambazar. The famous dark coloured mutton dish is replicated here, in more gentrified surroundings. Taste is almost the same.

The similarity between Golbari and Koshe Kosha of Golpark ends here.

Golbari is a non fussy place where you walk in, eat and go out. The place is always packed and its heart beats with the city- warts and all. The less than photogenic interiors, the cramped seating arrangements, are a glorious salute to the city's middle class.

Koshe Kosha, in contrast, is a pretentious joint. It is similar to a late Rituporno Ghosh film, a hollowed out Bengal with style- but no substance. Prices of other items are outrageous. A simple fish cutlet is rebranded and sold at three times the price. Other items are the same- an utter waste of good money at the price. Beware of the gondhoraj ghol-a truly repelling liquid which passed my lips.

Decor is okay. Servers are courteous.  The only culinary saving grace is the kosha mangsho.

Very good restaurant. food quality is too good. we had ordered bhetki fry, posto bora, plain rice, sona mung daal, alu bhaja, chitol machher moitha & gondhoraj mangsho. Posto bora seems to be costly, but when it came & we tasted, we felt worth it. Chitol machher muitha will be liked by every person i am very sure. Gondhoraj mangsho is a special mutton dish which has its own flavor. Last but not the least nolen gurer ice cream. one should definitely try it.
Over all, in comparision to many other bengali restaurant, i would prefer Koshe Kosha much more.

Heyy,¬†
Are you looking for a place which serves you authentic "Bangali Khabar" and a "bhalo poribesh". Koshe Kosha is the place which will offer you both. Convieniently located at Golpark X-ing, near Ramkrishna Mission, Koshe Kosha has a wide variety of Bengali platter at an affordable price. I personally ¬†feel its better than 6,Ballygunje, in terms of price and quality.¬†
I would insist all to try their "Gondhoraaj er Ghol". Its a smoothie, curd based with a dash of lime and a beautiful smell of "gondhoraaj lebur paata".¬†

Happy Eating..

Very pretty place ... With a mutton kasha to die for.. And an amazing jeera rice!. The restaurant provides complimentary chips , some shaak , kumro bhaaja etc at the start.. Baked paratha is also worth a try!

I have fallen for Bengali food all the more after visting a place like Koshe Kosha..
The lunch began with some compliementary chips provided by the restaurant itself so that you kill some time..must say a smart move indeed! ;)
Being just 2 people, we ordered Laal Keema,Moshla Murgi,Bhath,Baked Paratha and 1 Roti...
Now the food taste part..
I am not at all a lover of red meat...but since the other person liked mutton more than murgi,we ordered Keema..and trust me on this I loved it simply! Combination of Keema and Green Peas was beautifully prepared...Paratha was goood..Roti was oily (which was already informed by the waiter who took the order) but as soft as Rotis made for roadside Roll counters..
All in all I would give the place a thumbsup for lovely foood :) :)

My money is on Kasha Mutton, Lunching and Daab er ice cream.
The Chingri cutlet, Basanti polao and baked porota is also worth giving a try.

Word of caution - you might need to park your vehicle a bit far from the place as the road in front of the place is pretty narrow.

A heaven for my taste buds.The chingrir polao and mutton dakghar is sure to give you mouthgasms.Cute and cosy ambience with a traditional rural Bengal feel but many might find it cramped a bit.The service is impeccable.I go back here time and again and each time fall in love more!

I loved the place n food. The person who served us today was very cordial and extremely prompt. We had Rice, Posto Bora, Dhokar Dalna, Shukto, Lau Chingri, Bhetki Paturi, Taengra Macher Jhal, Polao, Kosha Mangsho, Amshotto Khejurer Chatni and Aam Doi. Dhokar Dalna was the best I ever had till date. Other dishes were also quite good. All for the bill amount of only 1648/- including VAT and Taxes. Only suggestion is that they could improve the crockeries'. ????

i was excited to visit this place after the reviews from zomato, but was not satisfied with the service. At first place the service was too slow, we had to wait for quiet some time after our order was placed (there was only us at that time).¬†
we had ordered for below items and each of the comments are given against each item :
1) FISH KABIRAJI - it was good, the price was moderate compared to the size. one piece is equal to 2 serving. quality of the fish was good. taste was also good.
2) BASANTI PULAO - had ordered for this based on the reviews found in zomato. honestly speaking it wasnt that good. i preferred the normal ghee bhat (which we ordered later) much more. the taste was very bland.¬†
3) BHETKI PATURI - it was yuck!!!!! the fish was stinking strongly.. the spices were not well prepared before marinating the fish. the taste was awful..¬†
4) DHAKAI MANGSHO & GONDHORAAJ MURGI - nothing remarkable or worth praising. they were kind of normal delicacies.
5) GHEE BHAAT & CHINGRIR MALAIKARI - probably my entire rating is only because of the aroma of this combo dish, but again the lobster wasnt that well cooked, but ok, we still preferred it compared to our previous orders.
6) PINEAPPLE CHUTNEY - this is the only thing that i can say was awesome!

Next time i would really droup out this option coz it was not at all upto the standard.
coming to the ambience, it was a quiet place with nice rabindra sangeet as the background music. but again a restaurant would be rated for its food mostly, and this needs to be improved at Koshe Kosha. ¬†:)

In service industry, it takes time to build goodwill, bonding and faith among the customers, for your food chain, we are some of them, my friends and their families. They are the regular visitor of your branches. I also visit Bengali cuisine restaurants when I come to Kolkata But, today I am writing this mail with broken heart.  

After taking the opinion of my friends I and my wife visited your Golpark branch for lunch on 13.10.14, table 8, served by Sankar Haldar. Bill no ‚Äì 4716. We ordered 1. saada vat, 2. chanar dalna,(too sweet, like a desert) 3. chital muithya, 4. muri ghanta, 5. kakrar jhal, 6. golda chingrir malaikari, 7. tel koi, 8. anaraser chatni.

We had a good welcome, Sankar served us well. When we leave, I wrote good comments on your guest book, but then the story started. We packed Galda chingrir malaikari to have it in our home. We got surprised to see that, there is a huge difference of size between the pieces of prawns; one is too small in size, why it should be like that? Is it the way to build positive image of an eminent restaurant like you?  

Secondly, it was not well cooked at all. We had to throw those pieces as those were not at all worthy to consume. I may have thrown it in front of you staff if I consume it at your premises.  

Is this problem with the kitchen golpark branch or you are doing this in all branches? 

The plate costs Rs.399+VAT+service tax, moreover you broke our faith on you. I must say, I and my friends (who suggested visiting your restora) are very much annoyed or else I may not give time to write you.

Make money, but, atleast try to satisfy your consumer first. Please remember you are dealing with ‚Äúfood‚Äù.

So we waited for 1-1/2 hours on Ashtami night to have authentic bengali khana @ Koshe Kosha. Did the food deliver? ABSOLUTELY! ¬†Happy with the service? NOT REALLY...

Since I am from Delhi, I was dying to have authentic Bengali food outside of home. After much surfing on Zomato, we landed at KK. I think the experience would have been better if we had gone on a non-Pujo day because they have a very small space and they found it more economical to allow parties of 4 to occupy the table rather than having parties of 2 occupy a space meant for 4. Though, I understand the economies of it, I do not agree with the policy. It should have been strictly based on 'first come, first serve' basis. ¬†As such, for a table for 2 (and we were not interested to do 'sharing'), we had to wait for a much longer time. It was even more annoying that the guard who was taking down the names would not tell us the average time one needed to wait more which should have been communicated from inside. ¬†This made the waiting even more irritating.

Coming to the food - we ordered from the pujo special. Unfortunately half the fish items on the menu such as bhetki r paturi (which i was eagerly looking forward to), and some more were not available. This was a shame. Anyhow, we ordered the Ghondoraj Ghol which was very nice, followed by sada bhat, pulao, kosha chicken and dhakai mangsho. I must say I really loved all the items and none of the food items were heavy on the stomach. We finished our meals with the aam doi, which was the highlight of the meal...absolutely glorious and the best aam doi I had till date, In fact, we packed two more aam dois for home. The quantity was just enough but a little more would have been better.¬†

Overall , the meal costed around 1000 rupees inclusive of taxes which I think was quite alright. ¬†Defiitely will go back the second time on a normal non-crazy day!!

Well I guess I am the only odd one out here because I had a very very bad experience at golpark koshe kosha. My fianc√© is a big fan of koshe kosha, so we decided to go there on Nabami night. As we were only 2 of us, they immediately gave us a place to sit upstairs. I was quiet impressed with that. As I didn't had to wait. It was at the extreme end and there were spilled rice n water all over the ground. Which made me uncomfortable as I was wearing a saree. No one bothered to clean it even after asking them repeatedly. 

We had ordered kosha mangsho and palav for dinner. Initially we were told that no chapati or paratha was available. But later a group sat next to us ordered PARATHA n kosha mangsho which they were served. And to my surprise when our food came it was cold, stale and tasteless. Even the finger bowl which was given to us had cold water in it, when asked they replied they don't have warm water. Seriously??? You have a kitchen, utensils, gas, water and you are still saying that  you don't have warm water, atleast for a finger bowl? 

Well I hope I will not have to suffer something like this or worst on my next visit.

Thanks to Zomato for putting this joint up in Durga pooja specials. It was a delight. Koshe kosha is a two storey eatery sutuated in Golpark. We had to wait fir over one and half hours before we could get a place. However, the food more than made up for that. We ordered fish fry, pulao, bhapa bhetki mach, mutton and aam doi (mango flavoured curd). The food was very tasty and the fish reminded me that the authentic bengali recipe has not become extinct yet. The mutton was fresh, very soft and heavenly. Also, the ambience of the joint will remind you of rural Bengal. With the earthen oven, little decorative paintings and structure of houses found in the outskirts of bengal, this restaurant has conjured up a beautiful atmosphere.

Took home delivery from them yesterday so cannot comment on the ambiance or presentation.¬†
The staff over phone where courteous and where prompt to inform about the availability of choices. The delivery person was also well mannered and was very punctual (even in the evening during the puja traffic).¬†
The food was really good. Though they did not have the highly recommended Gondhoraj Mangsho but we settled for the Kosha Mangsho, Dhakai Mangsho, Kosha Murgi, Baked Porota and plain rice. The mutton Kosha was excellent; those who have ever tasted original Golbarir Kalo Mangsho (or the Kosha Mangsho) will be delighted with this dish, Dhakai Mangsho was a very refreshing new taste and is definitely a must try, the baked paratha was well done, the plain rice was actually basmati rice. One portion of each is enough for two unless some one eats a lot. The food was perfect for an Astami dinner. Couldn't have expected anything more.
Pocket pinch was not much. For¬†
2 Kosha Mangsho
2 Dhakai Mangsho
6 Baked Porota
3 Plain Rice
1 Kosha Murgi
it costed around 1600/- which was more than enough for 5 of us.
Anyone who loves Bengali style mutton or chicken its a must try.
Will try the dine in facility ¬†for sure.

Bang opposite Southern Aminia , never dined in the restaurant.
But , have ordered for home delivery multiple times. Over time , have come to the conclusion that the best combination is their baked parota with kasha mangsho (Mutton / Chicken).
Although , their basonti pulao is quite good as well.

The decor is very ethnic and pleasant. The servers were really polite and prompt! Food was refreshingly good (Baked rasgullas- made our day) Reasonable on the pocket. 
Try this place! Both you and your tummy would be glad you made the right choice.

One of the finest places that i have been to and i seriously have no complains regarding anything when it comes to koshe kosha.
The ambience is amazing with the village and bong decor which is mind blowing. There's the famous rabindra sangeet being played at the background which actually gives you the "being a bengali" feeling. It has a very cordial staff and the food here gives me the feeling that "my mother is right there in their kitchen".

Ordered for very simple food.. Aam porar sorbot and bhetki fry as in for the starters. And the beginning was itself very tasty.
Plain rice, musoor dal, muri ghonto, aaloo bhaja and moshla murgi for the main course and trust me..my lunch was awsome. Simply at its best.
I wanted jalpaiyer chutney for the ending bit but it wasn't available and my tummy was full..so nothing for deserts.
And this place provides you with loads of complimentary things like shaped papad and lal saakh and shukto kinda stuff..too......

I was happy.. :-)

After reading several reviews from Zomato and after planning a lot (somehow every time we planned, it got cancelled), we made it yesterday. A very soothing location away from traffic attracts you with its innovative tag line "Purano sei diner kosha". When we entered, we were the only customers and thus received the complete attention of the staff. Koshe kosha offers a mesmerizing ambiance with its 'gram bangla' decor and a good collection of Rabindrasangeet instrumentals. The hospitality of the crew members is beyond question and we were almost treated with 'jamai ador'. I juz wanted to keep it simple and ordered ROTI and KOSHA MURGI after having AAM PORAR SARBAT. The food here is really delicious but I just wish that there were a bit more meat in the kosha murgi. It was mostly all bones! apart from that, everything was really great. 

I would like to visit this place again and try something different next time..

Years ago one had to drive down to the Gol Ghar at the five point crossing to get a taste of the famous Kasha. Then there was Koshe Kasha there several outlets and the menu now has expanded across the city. The highlight is the baked paratha that offsets the oil in the Kasha. The Bengali dishes are good enough but faces stiff competition. The Golpark place is a bit cramped. but the decor is eye catching.

Being a Bengali my taste buds are naturally primed and inclined for that KOSHA MANGSHO & POROTA ‚Ä¶ and this the exact reason why  I keep visiting this small outlet near golpark whenever I have those ‚Äúkochi pathar mangsho‚Äù pangs !! Went there recently with my family and everyone of us treated us with SORSHE ILISH, GONDHORAJ MANGSHO, KAKRAR JHAL and what not .The meal is hearty ,sumptuous and very close to a fulfilling family meal ‚Ä¶ as we call it kobji dubiye khaoa without a slit in our throats ! Despite not being in the bracket of one of those sophisticated fine dining places ‚Ä¶ KOSHE KOSHA has the charm of simplicity ,familiarity that will continue to pull in its niche customers .

Koshe Kosha is a delectable wonder. A restaurant with loads or warmth and neat dining, merged with innovative approach and traditional feeling, comprising of ground and first floor seating. The plate on which the food is served is made of clay and covered with banana leaf, which is exactly how it is in affluent rural areas of Bengal. The ambiance and presentation gives a comfortable feeling. 
Food: Murgir Cutlet, Chingrir Cutlet, Mochar Chop, Postor Bora, Bhetki Paturi, Galda Chingri Malai Curry and Gondhoraj Ghol comprised the food menu for us. I would not say, that it was gastronomic delight, but certainly it was gastromic satisfaction, almost reaching the level of excellnce. 
Staff: Cordial, polite, ready to help.

OMG!!!!!! Tucked away just opposite to arsalan golpark,  we were actually contemplating whether we should just eat our biryani and go home. But but but. .. We are just so glad we didn't do that. .They have the most exquisite bengali food which is not even heavy on your pocket.  You have to try the bhetki paturi... and ghee bhat with sona muger daal and aloo bhaja. .. yum yum yum yum. ..Please go. .

i love their decor and ambiance.. it has been given a look of earthen-hut of villages with winnowing tray hanging from the wall. music played are instrumental rabindrasangeet. i love aam pora sarbat. i have tried several dishes like kosha mangsho,kosha chicken,ilish bhape,bhekti paturi, golda chingrir malaikari. but of all my favourite is kosha mangsho which is their speciality. i love the roti and baked porota. i love d tamarind achaar they serve with roti. for desserts i have tried both daab icecream and nolen grer icecream but daab icecream is the best. i always enjoyhaving food over here. i am looking forward to see new addition to their menu.

Koshe kosha, is a resturant serving excellent Bengali cuisine. We were four of us, at pretty late in the night looking out for a food joint when we decided to stick to our cliche 'Bangali Khabar' and hence entered Koshe kosha. Trust me, there's 0 repentance from my side. The decor inside was simple and gave a very indigenous village feel. Tall men and women are adviced not to take the seating upstairs as you're invariably gonna hit your head on their very low ceiling :p Nevertheless I really loved the interiors.

Talking about food, we didn't order much-Rice, daal, jhingey posto, aloo bhaja, chicken kosha and aamer chutney. But the food was still delicious, the flavours were great and I loved the chicken. Their generous with the quantity of food served and their service is quick and very efficient. Their staff is great and friendly and they definitely guide you well through the menu. Its pocket friendly and serves authentic Bengali food. What more does one need? :) 

PS: You need to try the Nolengurer Icecream!

Hi, went and ordered most of the famous items, kosha mangsho, potoler dolma, gandharaj chicken, ghol... although daab ice cream not available that day, so missed out on that. Mangsho was not that delightful as expected as it was over roasted and got a bit bitter for our liking and the chicken was bland with too "limy" smell in it. One must stick to the conventional chicken recipes, but we were surprised by the potol, the gravy and the stuffed potol was a delight and WE DON'T LIKE POTOL in general.... so my advise try out the vegetarian stuff too as it grossly underrated and by far scores higher than the non-veg items.

I had lunch here earlier this week. Small joint with nice village kind of decorations. I tried the following:
1. Fish Fry - definitely avoidable. Less of fish and more of batter coating. Its fraud.
2. Bhetki paturi - one plate has two pieces covered in banana leaves. It was nice and tasty. The mustard doesn't overwhelm you. It was well done. Give it a try.
3. Kosha Mangsho with Pulao - Very good. The pulao was not two sweet. Just perfect. The kosha mangsho (mutton) was cooked to perfection. Soft and tender. The gravy was dark and spicy. Its different from the Oh Calcutta kosha mangsho. I would rate this better than other restaurants. Can go well with Luchi also.

Will definitely recommend this place for the kosha mangsho.

Where do I begin? The decor in this place is what it should be - warm, welcoming and quirky. The chairs are super comfortable, the servers are soft spoken, and attentive without being bothersome, which is so important when you're eating alone - you want them to let you eat and read in peace, but come over and help you whenever you need help. Great staff, absolutely. And the food...it was like poetry! I ordered a mochhar chop and aam panna to begin with, and a kosha mangsho with pulao for main course. Kosha Mangsho is one of favourite bengali foods, and I've had it from about 5 places in the last 3-4 months. This one was the best, without question. The flavours were so distinct, and so amazing that I forgot to read my book! The Pulao was great too. The Aam panna was a bit too sweet, but you're in Kolkata, what do you expect? Definitely will go again.

i had been to the koshe kosha outlet at shyambazar but never been to this place..i was at my maternal uncle's house where we had home delivery from this koshe kosha outlet...
we ordered kosha mangsho and polao and baked porota..i guess this kosha mangsho was awesomeeely made..such soft meat and accumulation of spices have made it heavenly along with the baked porota..though i did nt like the polao...it had lots of ghee in it..but am a fan of their kosha mangsho amazing ..

they made their delivery within 30 minutes of the order quite quick..and the food is great..would like to go their and try other bengali dishes specially fish items there..but the kosha mangsho was mind blowing.!!

This place serves one of the best pulao and kosha mangsho, the ultimate bengali delicacy. The mutton is made very nicely and the best part is that it is always tender, which makes the entire Mangsho-Bhaat experience pretty smooth. The must try in this place is the regular kosha mangsho, kochi pathar jhol, bhetkir paturi and gondhiraj mangsho for everyone who is willing to experiment! The place is a but stuffy but a good food experience on the whole.

One Sunday afternoon a friend and I decided to have lunch here. Fortunately we reached there before the regular lunch hours. Saying this, since the seating is limited, it tends to overflow in the proper lunch hour. The decor is pretty theme oriented. I find the combo options pretty pocket friendly and portion controlled -- enough for a person, without leaving any surplus (wastage). The food however I found a little too spicy -- very heavy on chili powder dosage. But it would grow on your taste buds. We had ordered the pulao alongside, and the sweetness of it helped to balance the heat.

I had their food delivered to a friends place....hence my points are not based out of their decor or service or even price. Because it was my friends's treat. It is purely based on the taste of the food.
 Sukto was very good , So was the posto bora. 
A big let down was the mangsho r jhol :( it was runny &  extremely light ...... seemed liked for patients at hospital. Might be some people will like to have this kind of watery gravy in the hot summer months so that they can digest mutton in this kind of whather . But for me Mutton & watery- is a big NO NO. Light mutton can be little tasty & spicy too. Hence not 4 from me.

Went there for dinner last nigt. 

Location- 
This place is nicely located near gol-park (enter road beside mouchak, and turn left towards Aminia , this is opp of Aminia ), and getting parking infront of the place was quite easy.

Food Taste -
I was feeling hungry so ordered a Murgir Cutlet, and gandharaj ghol for quick snacks.The cutlet was pretty big, and it tasted well.
I was under opinion that Campari provides the best chicken cutlet, but tatse wise, this is no less. Off course, the price was 3 times more!
Ghol was also of good taste.

Since it was hot summer evening, parceled gandharaj mutton and chicken jhol for home. Both were excellent to eat, specially, the mutton was really tasty.
It was light, with lemon taste/smell all over, and chicken was also good.

Gandharaj Ghol-  Rs.65
Murgir Cutlet -  Rs.155
Murgir Jhol   -  Rs.205
Gandharaj Mangsho - Rs.245

Service - 
The service seems a little slow, as my parcel was not ready even after 20mins or order. There was no rush , so expected it to be ready.

Decor -

The resto decor was excellent with rural bengal theme, and specially, designed with ghute (Cow dung) and light n shadow.
Thank god, the 2 ton AC was working, and it made the experience awesome.

Overall -
A nice experience, will visit the place again. May ask for home delivery as well next time.

The ambiance is really great and gives you a feeling that somehow you've reached some remote 'graam bangla'r' bari to treat your tastes buds with some really good 'kochi patha'r jhol or kosha mangsho'. The taste was to be honest okay but I would have loved a bit more of meat on the bones I ordered. Never the less, it's one of a kind in Kolkata and it deserves a decent 4 stars. I personally would have loved a bit more food to be honest. I mean a small bowl of 'bhaat' is not what I usually eat at home.

Had passed by this place almost a hundred times but the door never seemed very inviting. But finally in one of my hunts for a 'new place' entered koshe kosha on a hot summer afternoon. Was pleasantly surprised to see a warm mud-hut like interior complete with cart-wheels, jute hangings, and madhubani paintings. 
We ordered gondhoraj ghol, polao, kosha mangsho and chingri biriyani. While waiting for the food we were provided with a plateful of fryums, which was an instant mood-lifter. In a moment we gobbled that up, and the food was served soon after. The polao and kosha mangsho can easily give the more expensive bengali eateries a run for their money. And then the chingri biriyani was even a notch higher, served with a heavenly gravy of shrimp paste. The ghol was very light and refreshing too. They also served 'kool-er chutney/achar' which i couldn't help but polish off at the end of the hearty meal. The staff was polite and neither did they hover around too much nor did they vanish altogether. 
So if one is looking for genuinely tasty and authentic bengali food sans the glamour of an expensive restaurant, then this is THE  place to head to. 
Next time will try out some of their vegetarian dishes, if i can manage to, after having the polao-mangsho and chingri biriyani though.

We went to Koshe Kosha last Pujo for a Saptami Night Dinner. I always wanted to go to this new outlet of this restaurant as it is in my locality. The restaurant is of two floors. Coming to the ambiance , the restro is decorated in a Bengali Village theme which I found quite impressive.  The hosts are very well mannered and looks after the guests to their best. 
    From the name itself, we get to know that this place serves Bengali Cuisine. Coming to the food, we order Basanti Polao, Kosha Mangsho, Chanar Dalna in the main course and Daab ice-cream as dessert. The quality of food they serve is wonderful. I will definitely recommend all of the main course items cause you just can't miss all those. I just loved their food!! But this Dab ice-cream became an absolute love!! Its wonderful. You will feel the beauty on the very first lick and bite. Coming to the cons, the quantity. It would be lovely if they serve some more. I would definitely re-visit this restaurant.

Its located at Golpark and thus none can ever find it difficult to locate the place.. I remember giving birthday treat to one of my friends here, last year.. She wanted to have bengali food for a change and I promised to take her to a new place.. I logged into zomato and found great reviews written and thought of giving it a try and trust me, I didnt regret it a bit.. The food was awesome.. The service was great and the waiters were well mannered.. The price is a bit high but the quantity of food was enough for two people.. I would surely recommend ths place to my friends. :-)

Koshe Kosha serves up good Bengali food. Came across this particular branch when I visited Aminia (Golpark) and have ordered takeaways a few times now. The Kosha Mangsho which is the signature dish is pretty good and a dish that is one of my favorites.... its also the first thing I ever ordered. Thereafter I have ordered Bhekti Paturi ( pretty good) , Chingrir Biryani ( decent) , Fish Fry ( quite nice though a tad oily ) . The Porota is very nice and goes well with the Kosha Mangsho. The Aamer Chutney is lovely. A great option is the Kosha Mangsho and Pulao Combo that I have picked up a couple of times for dinner. I have had the Aam Pora Sarbot while waiting for my order to be packed and enjoyed it. The decor is rustic and quaint though its a small place. A good place to drop by if you like Bengali Food. They also have a couple of other branches in the city.

Judging by the exteriors me and my friend walked into this place,nonetheless we were not disappointed at all. 

The restaurant  has two floors. The interiors has a Bengali village theme. Decorated with mud walls, big palm leaf hand fan, wooden dolls, straw basket....a shabby narrow stairs leads to the mezzanine floor.

This place is all about Bengali food. We placed an order for  Fish fry,  Pulao, Macher Kalia, Chicken Kosha and Aam Panna. Soon after taking the order we were served complimentary Fried Fritters which were fish shaped!  We were delighted to see that before food was served the courteous staff offered us hand sanitizers to sanitize. The food was perfectly cooked though the fish was a bit spicy but the chicken was  lovely. The fish fry was the most relished one.

The service was brisk, the pricing is reasonable,good ambience and friendly staff. Overall this place is worth visiting.
I am definitely going to go back to this place and recommend it to my friends.

Decided to go to Koshe Kosha after a short debate between that and a few other places nearby. The interiors have a lovely village-like feel to it, complete with "ghnute" which I daresay was slightly repulsive. However, after seating, ordered the Mutton Kasha and plain rice. A plate of fish-shaped crackers were served first, and while we were busy munching them, the rice came over. The pieces of mutton were tender, if a bit too small, and we found the kasha to be nothing remarkable. What was remarkable was the chutney that came with it, and the laal keema and baked paratha we ordered next. Tender, succulent keema, fluffy, perfectly cooked, yet not oily paratha and we were silently fighting over the last teaspoon of keema in the end. Our bill for this meal was 600/- exact.

An old house renovated ..a mezzanine floor with "pati"or "chatai" clad ceiling as low as u can imagine a wooden stair..a village setup..even the toilet has those wooden door with iron shackles...love d decor though a Lil cramped

Food is amazing..the stunner is dhakai mangsho and rosun bhapa bhetki.The later one is an absolute favourite.Other items are good like postor boda, mochar ghonto or the prawn biriyani..

This is south kolkata branch of "Koshe kosha" and I would say it's better than maniktala outlet. It will certainly give you feel that you are having lunch in a village clay hut. Just loved the ambiance, not too much hyped but simple well maintained. Next the service, well I would say the waiters are generous and they serve really very well. As soon as you be sited in your table, and order is placed they serve "fried papad" as snacks and it's completely free. If you are going for rice I would say go for it, with rice they serve 2 complementary dishes like "kachu bata", "kalmi shaak" etc. With rice simply go for "Potol dolma" and "chitol muitya" these tastes fab. If you are planning to go for "pulao" or their special "Baked Parota" then only it's companion should be "mutton kosha" they called "kosha mangsho" and sorshe lovers can try  "Jire Shorshe Murgi". Their dessert, "Daab Ice cream" is too good, I would say every time I went their I must order this no matter what the main course is :)

I went to Koshe Kosha years ago. With my mum. It was near about the time I graduated to full pants. Back then the only thing that mattered was a day out with the parents, plus the fact that there'd be no homework if we returned late. :) I don't remember exactly what the dishes were or how they tasted. I do however remember that we had a nice and tasty meal even though I displayed less than impeccable table manners by dropping a plate. Mum tells me that we had the Kosha Mangsho (Chicken) and that it was nice. ( She hates complimenting anything). I remember renovations going on back then. Judging from the pictures of the interiors now, I'd say it looks pretty classy. Although, I think they went a bit overboard with the Gram Bangla look. The look of the menu has me enamoured. The witty one liners really got to me. I also noticed that the menu has been extended nicely to include quite a few bengali starter delicasies such as the 'bhajas' as well as a host of veg items. 

 Few of my friends now head over there occasionally. They are all praise for the decorations, the taste and the feel of the place. Everyone has complained however of less than professional service. Based on all this, as well as keeping in mind the other reviews, I'm rating them 4. The fact is that there are very few good restaurants dedicated to bengali cuisine. Most of those present on the scene are top of the line, charging exorbitant prices, way out of the reach of many. In such a scenario Koshe Kosha is obviously a very attractive choice, coupled with the fine location it enjoys.

Chakraborty Tip : A functional problem is that any Kosha Mangsho preparation, as we Bongs know, goes exceptionally well with Mutton. For people like me, who are not into mutton, the basic purpose may seem defeated. However, breaking out of the traditional notion, I'm looking forward to visiting the place asap. :) Gonna keep you people posted and hope you'll do the same.

If you order paratha and kosha mangsho you'd expect to have mutton and not gravy with some awkward cuts of mutton. But that is exactly what our order was. A couple of oddly cut tiny slivers of mutton in gravy that is strangely spiced. The baked paratha is a good choice and, while others ordered the pulao+mangsho combination, the pulao was the saving grace for a good meal. 

A bunch of starters that weren't too great on taste but adequate made up the meal. There's this ambience about the place about "trying too hard" but the result isn't spectacular. Just a notch above the joints famous at North Kolkata who provide a similar meal but at a much lower price tag.

Not the very best of experience except that the company was pleasant and, being sparsely crowded - the conversation scintillating.

Located in Golpark, me and my wife went there sometime back. The interiors are unique with some seating arrangement on top. Most of the items were good and matched any of its competitors among bengali chain restaurants, but bhetki macher paturi and mutton kasha deserves a special mention. The mishti pulao was also of top draw. Prices are standard and affordable. In a nutshell a good one for family lunch or dinner.

During Durga Pujo, Nabami is the day on which Bengalis celebrate by eating traditional non-veg delicacies. There's a long queue in front of meat shops even before daybreak. And what better way to satiate ourselves on this day than to have indulged in the famous Golbarir Kosha Mangsho. We did not go to Golbari Restaurant for the purpose though, but a small restaurant named Koshe Kosha.

Koshe Kosha is an eatery started by an owner of Golbari Restaurant. It is conveniently located at Golpark and offers Bengali cuisine. Another reason for choosing this restaurant was that there was no waiting time unlike all the other restaurants nearby, all of which had a long queue. It is a small place with seating arrangement on two floors. The stairway is narrow, the ceiling on the first floor is very low and the place might feel a little claustrophobic especially on the upper floor. However the place is nicely done up with traditional Madhubani paintings and cane and wood furniture and artefacts. We were eight of us and took our seats on the first floor.

Coming to the food, we were pretty hungry and went straight to the main course. We ordered Roti and Baked Parota with Mutton Kosha and Chicken Kosha, Basmati Pulao with Gondhoraj Murgi and Jhurjhure Aloo Bhaja. All the dishes tasted great. Mutton Kosha deserves special mention since it is THE dish people are here for and it was perfect. Baked Parota had the right amount of oil and Basmati Pulao the right amount of sweetness. The only drawback was that for beverages, they only had cold drinks on offer. We wanted fresh lime juice/ soda which was not available. The total bill came to Rs. 1500 + tips for eight of us. This was a steal deal for the quality and quantity of food on offer.

We ended our Nabami completely satisfied and in authentic Bengali style!

I went there on Saptami 2013 and had Pulau with Chicken kosha and Pineapple chatni in dessert.  each and every item was awesome and the environment was so good. it made me feel like I was sitting in a village hut and the strain of bengali music made the environment more touchy. the quality and taste of the foods were awesome but the place was quite short. it was because I was on the 1st floor. but the ground floor has quite good space. the lighting of the restaurant is not enough. but if anyone wants to have a candlelight dinner type mood then it's the best place for them.

Loved the Dab malai Ice-cream, It was my first visit and during the puja so I wasn't expecting much nevertheless the food was decent and the Ice-cream was really good ( Worth mentioning that this was the first time i had one ).

Awesome food with great ambience is main feature of this place. I went there with some of my friends recently. The staffs were good and happy to help us. Though a bit costly but I think it reasonable as per the quality of the food.

Awesome bengali food.. Was so hungry for authentic Ilish bhapa for so long, they ended my wait.. The kosha mangsho was delicious too.. Went down well with the oil free baked pararha.. Guess what I took their number for ordering the kanta-chhara ilish for the next visit!

Would put bhetki paturi and kochi pathar jhol in my wishlist. The bill would be 800-900 per head..

I recently discovered this bijou Bengali restaurant in the midst of Kolkata's tastebud satiators. This place is 'blink and u miss' at the first glance from outside; inside, however, it's a conglomeration of a multitude of ethnic imprints of Bengal. The interiors look like a scene from rural Bengal... all with the feel of mud-houses and thatched roofs. There is also an upper level to this duplex, which I am yet to explore.

Coming to the main deal... the food I found was pretty awesome. Albeit I didn't try out a full course meal there (want to do so in the near future), I found myself holistically loving what my taste buds experienced. We ordered Chingrir Cutlet (Prawn Cutlet), Mangsher Cutlet (Mutton Cutlet) and Capsicum-er Chop. The two cutlets, Rs. 115/- each, and the capsicum chops (2 big pieces for 45 bucks) were a deal... well, actually a great deal. The filler in the prawn cutlet was a giant prawn, along with probably some mashed up small prawns. The mutton cutlet was sheer bliss, especially when each bite succulently melted in the mouth. The capsicum chops were good too. 

Overall, I'd say that I got pretty impressed with the taste, quality and price. The waiters weren't the typically smiley sort, but they were extremely attentive nevertheless. So next time you go to GolPark, make sure you try out this place.

We had Daaber Ice cream. We only had daaber ice cream as we had planned it from before.

This place caught my attention for its name. A good play of ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶≤‡¶æ words, and they have an innovative name. 
Then I saw their menu to get a good idea of what they have on offer, as we are specialists ourselves when it comes to "kosha mangsho". But after reading the menu, and getting a few feedbacks, I thought of skipping the plans of having a full fledged Bengali meal, and opted for the ‡¶°‡¶æ‡¶¨‡ßá‡¶∞ ice cream.

 And I must say, a bit overpriced though, the ice cream was worth the visit.
Next time I am coming for the "kosha mansho".

the only thing that woos you is the interior-simple yet representing our ethnic rural background where a place of opulence would just about look like this.having said that we tried the following items and that's what we felt about them

baked paratha- a novel attempt without the sizzle of novelty.not oily,so that's an obvious reason to go for it.

dhakai mangsho- at 190,the 4 tiny pieces of mutton seemed we live in days of famine.

cheengri biryani-very few shrimp,and the artificial flavour of ill-med biryani was the turn off

dab icecream-just as you you expect it to be(rolick serves it on streets) with a bigger pricetag.didn't like it,but stilll ordered it. why,you ask? because they were out of nalen gurer icecream

actually they didn't have most of the items they have got on menu,and we had to change order 2-3 times as the waiters have no idea what the kitchen could make for the day.

Bucolic atmosphere, soft and pleasant instrumental music, polite staff and delectable Bengali food. These are the characteristics of this small, new, but brilliant restaurant. It is located in a prime location in Kolkata and that has added to its advantage. The entrance is very small indeed and tall people might have to bend their heads to go upstairs but once seated, the place is bound to make people remember Rabindra Nath Tagore's "sonar bangla". They serve papad, and other trinket dishes as complement. The food is first-rate and preserves the subtle Bengali tastes specific to Bengal. Be it the Kosha Mangsho or the mochar ghonto every dish is appealing. They also make baked paratha that is oil free. I have been here a couple of times and tried different items just for the sake of not repeating and every time I have been pleased. The price too is very moderate and nothing that will burn a hole in your pocket.Highly recommended.

P.S
Avoid this place if you are going out in a group of more than 4 to 6 people, because it is indeed a small place.

this place is absolutely under rated on zomato. my visit to this place was perfectly unplanned. and I was floored! rustic ambience, a great staff and delicious authentic bengali food.

but the best part is the complimentary tit bits they serve. starting with sabu papor, they served up bori bhaja and thor bata before our order and the latter was delicious!

they have some neat combos too! I highly recommend this place!

Our visit to Koshe Kosha was rather unplanned. We went to this place in South Kolkata where they have many eating-out options nearby; and all pretty well-known for the food they serve, but we just decided to enter Koshe Kosha and ended up having a very fulfilling experience. The joint is a small one, but nicely done up, and the menu truly "different" in its own way, featuring quintessential Bengali dishes cooked differently. We didn't go for a very extensive spread, but whatever we had for dinner were all very good. I specially liked their gandhoraj mangsho and dab-ice-cream. The aroma and the tenderness of the meat pieces simply made our day. The staff was friendly too.

Just came back from an awful dinner at Koshe Kosha! we had high hopes..which were shattered at each items we ordered! started with chingri cutlet..the only item other than normal dal, which can b taken! posto bora had a rusty smell! Kosha mangsho was not at all kosha..mutton pieces were hard! a complete wastage!! I rated it 1.5 just for its ambience! food value is zero!

Located in a popular place, this restaurant offers different bengali foods and ofcourse with a good taste. I went there for a sunday lunch and it satisfied me. The place is small but it has a homely ambiance and descent decor. Ilish bhapa was very good where as chital maacher muitha was so so. The mutton pieces in mutton curry were soft and tasty. Overall a good restaurant for having lunch, just they need to make it more spacious.

Koshe Kosha is my third favourite restaurant for having bengali cuisine.To start with, bhetki fry is wow. Then, Chicken Kosha and plain rice is the best ever in the menu of a bong....Mochar Ghonto is great too. Dab Chingri is a must try....Prices are reasonable..
Staff is friendly.
But, very often i have bengali food at my place so it becomes boring to eat bengali food in different restaurants. 
4.0 anyday!

We are Bengalis from foodies' nightmare city, Delhi. We'd heard of Koshe Kosha from friends returning from Kolkata and we grabbed the first opportunity to check out this new eatery with the funny name ( as far as name recall goes, Koshe Kosha is a winner -- you don't want to admit you've not been there yet ) in Gol Park. We had Kochi Patha as well as Kosha Mangsho. Truth be told, the former was Gold class while the Kosha Mangsho tasted quite ordinary. We loved the Muri Ghonto too. The luchis were done well as were the fish fries. The interiors seemed the work of an art director of a realistic movie director. I've never seen imitation 'ghutey' (cowdung cakes) before and I made up my mind to look for some for the exterior of my Delhi house. A visit to Koshe Kosha, therefore, was more than a gastronomical experience. After a most exquisite meal, I emerged wiser on elements of many of the higher aspects of life. And, of course, the service was outstanding. Joy and Ronny

Fantastic authentic Golbari r black kosha mangsho. This is a place where one can find authentic Bengali cuisine especially the Kosha Mangsho. It reminds me of Golbari's Kosha Mangsho, Food is really good and its at all heavy in the stomach and in the pocket. Ambiance aptly goes with the theme but the only negative is the cutlery, no doubt its clean but its too street........

'Koshe Kosha', I dont think the name needs any introduction for all the 'Bongs' out there and (for non-Bongs) it means 'Highly Grilled'. Sounds tasty;  no?? Well after hearing the name for the first time the picture that came into my vision is one plate full of Mutton Kosha, Paratha and Pulao also it has created the sensation of having too much water in my mouth #ifyouknowwhatimean#

Enough of introduction now. Coming to the essentials. First of all from outside the first thing that will grab your attention is the vibrant color of the place. The traditional figures and the yellow color symbolizes the spirit of 'Bong Culture'. Very nicely painted, I must say. The look and feel factor is very nice. You can easily notice the tables partially made from bamboo or it will give you the illusion of that. The menu card is also very well decorated.

The staff are very courteous and welcomes you with a smile. They will also give you the perfect suggestion about what's special and everything. We ordered Chicken Kaviraaji, Baked Paratha, Mutton Kasha and Nalen Gurer Ice Cream. Chicken Kavirajji was soft and crispy but the taste was average, then came Paratha and Mutton Kasha. Parathas were oil free and perfect but the show stopper was definitely the mutton kasha. The aroma and the looks will definitely blow you out. Muttons were well cooked and also pieces were nice. For dessert we ordered Nalen Gurer Icecream. Never tried that before but it was okay.

I would give 4 out of 5. Had a great experience.The only thing they need to improve is the sitting arrangement and the card swipe machine.Overall this restaurant is awesome. Bengali cuisine re-invented. Cheers to Koshe Kosha!! :)

finding this tiny shack was a serendipity. The food was excellent. The ambience holds Bengali folk culture and the menu card reflects the bengali ADDA  dialogues. the price is very reasonable and the service is very prompt. I had bake paratha with Mutton kasha and nolen gurer ice cream. Will try the fish items next time.

I went there in last weekend and found though they are claiming about a meat/ chicken festival, fish items were better. Like basanti Polao and Chital Macher Muitthya but don't like the Kosha Mangsho, stewards are courteous but lil bit confused while suggesting ;-) Baked ROSOGOLLA was great but nalen gurer icecream was not up to the mark. Overall good

On a very lazy day, I decided to give my rumbling stomach no chance to complain when me and my friends steered into the Golpark outlet of Koshe Kosha. The place is indeed very small but very neat and the servers were very friendly. 
We ordered the non-veg thali along with an extra accompaniment of Kosha Mangsho and Chingri Malaikari. The Kosha Mangsho was absolutely divine, the pieces were well proportioned and the spice hit was very subtle. 
The Chingri Malaikari was creamy and the thali is enough for two!! The delicious meal ended with baked rosogollas. Koshe Kosha now becomes a huge hit in my go-to food destinations.

Went to have lunch here 2 weeks ago.. in spite of the terrible reviews people have written, the place is actually quite nice. The steward was very nice to us and got us the best Kohsa Mangsho and Kosha Chicken. Maybe I was lucky, but I love d the food. 
The paratha was soft and flaky, the Aam Pora Shorbot was delicious, the best I have had at any Bengali cuisine outlet, and the chutney they serve on the table is a must try. 

I probably had a good meal as I went there without any bias... and was pleasantly surprised. 

Shall pay a visit soon again.

I had a craving for mutton one Sunday afternoon and headed for the 'Koshe Kosha' at Golpark. The place was very compact and we were seated on the top floor. There are 4 tables here and you can hear everyone conversing, the tables are placed that close to each other. The food was good as we started off with Luchi and Kosha Chicken. Then we ordered 'Kosha Mangsho', Pulao and Paratha. The mutton disappointed me as the pieces were too small to identify and it was more of bone rather than meat. The parathas are not good as well and better opt for roti here. The pulao was okay. The desserts are far better than the main course. Someday would like to come back here and taste the fish items. Wonder how they will be.

I went there with my family last month. The place is cramped and you will not like to visit the place again. I found the ambiance to be a bit contradictory as it does not give you the exact feel of village when you see western crockery.

I had specially ordered 'Kosha Mangsho' (Mutton) assuming it would be good based on the name & branding of their restaurant - 'Koshe Kosha - Original Mutton Magic'. Surprisingly, the mutton was black in color. Initially I was apprehensive about consuming it and asked the person who was serving us, about its weird and unusual color. He assured me that it was an authentic one and is cooked in a way to acquire black color. I am still clueless, why ? I repent my decision of accepting it till date today. Yes, it tasted horrible ! 

Although the hospitality is little better as compared to other restaurants in the city, but do not expect a heartiest meal, which will only lose your hard-earned money in drain. 

Overall, not a pleasant experience and would suggest Bengali food lovers to blindly give it a miss !

I like Koshe Kosha because they offer platters that are quite good. Individual items are not worth mentioning. The fries are good and so are the fish preparations.The Kosha is generally good but the standard varies a bit.
The manicktala is a better option if you want to try the kosha.
