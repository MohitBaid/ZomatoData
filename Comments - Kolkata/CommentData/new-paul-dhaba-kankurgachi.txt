This year DURGA puja after finding all restaurants being closed or no food availability this place served as in mid night and handling mass crowd like pro, we found this place as a blessing as it meets our stomach, we order tandoori kabab, mixed fried rice, chili chicken, mutton biriyani and mutton kasha and though we wait for good half an hour to receive our main dishes after our starter but its wothwhile as we were assured that it would fill our stomach indeed! And we receive cokes as a complimentary!!  The quantity and quality of the food was good enough to recommend.

I have never come across a restaurent, who parcels cold coffee in plastic rice bowls. As anticipated, coffee spilled out and messed other food items ordered alongwith. Upon enquiry, we came to know that they did not have proper container for coffee or liquid beverages so the wise brains decided to provide them in rice bowls with leaky lids. We also ordered vegetable cheese grilled sandwich and chopsuey. They are of average taste. In addition, the sandwich does not seem fresh and the bread was rockhard to bite. I will never visit this restaurent.

Food is good.. they should stop the delivery service m. They are operating beyond their capacity.. serving is slow.. You must try it once. For non vegetarian people it's the best

Had a big order. Foods are quite Ok, but nothing great. dry chili Fish is having a thick coat and the fish was not soft enough. fried rice was the saving grace. Mutton or chicken are nothing special. Mix veg was a disappointment. The Dal Makhni was good.

Its the worst restaurant i have ever seen in my life.üñï
When i went there for the first time today only two waiters were there in this whole restaurant. There nothing was available such as biryani or fried rice.
Only polau was availableüòÖüòÇ and chowmein was there. So i ordered mix chowmein and they served me veg chowmein and that too in a very bad quality.
In the plate of that chowmein there was a piece of hair of a lady..üòë 
I wish to give this restaurant negative star(-5)üôÇ but unfortunately that cannot be done and i gave it a star bcoz without that star i cant review...so i will not waste more time for this shiity restaurant... I want to salute this restaurant with my middle finger up...üñï

We ordered chicken bharta and chicken kasha over a home delivery..It's taste really good , the food was yuumy n we look forward to order again..üëåüëåüëåüëå
Bharta has shreaded chicken with sliced boiled egg blended together in a rich gravy, and the kasha has 2 big pieces of chicken, altogather the food is more than enough to feed 3ppl! N the pocket pinch is also less..so a big thumbs up!üëç 
Please don't go for biriyani.

The restaurant on the first flooring with a large floor area and a television. We ordered Crispy chilly mushroom, nan & chicken reshmi butter masala. Like the mushroom very much, the nan was soft and tasty as well but the Chicken kebabs in the butter masala was a bit on the harder side. Though can't jugde with just a single dish, hope I'll have a better experience the next time..

Location: kankurgachi mitali sangha
A huge spacious restaurant with prominent decor .
Food we ordered:
*Tandoori roti 
*rumali roti
*chicken tikka masala
*green salad
And a lime soda.  
Service was very slow.. Had to wait 15 mins for food. 
Food was ordinary.. The tandoori roti was burnt and dry when complained they gave an excuse for high flame coal. 
May not suggest anyone!

I had ordered a non veg thali. It contained everything but none of the items borne any taste. The biryani was cold with no taste at all. The portion of mutton in the thali was the only thing which i could eat. The chicken chaap was something which i have never ever tasted anywhere.It had absolutely no taste of the chaap. The restaurant really needs to work a lot. Horrible experience. Not at all recommendable ...

Well mother's day special went bad due a bad service.Went to this joint on the eve of mother's day.The joint is situated 5 min walking distance from the kakurgachi bus stop.It has a good seating area for quite a no of customers.Coming to the interior it's really minimal noting to describe.A simple 2 out of 5.
Next coming to the service well as mentioned earlier they have quite a space to accommodate people,but what's the use of you only have 4 people to serve all of them.we reached there by 9 o'clock for dinner had to wait Atleast 30min just to get no one approaching for taking the orders.my brother went to the cash counter to call someone they said to wait a few min.one of them came & with joy said half of the items in the menu were over.still with selective items we opted 2 Reshmi kabab,3 mutton chaps,one chicken chap & 2 mutton tikiyas.but yet another error they came up with only one plate of kabab.when asked why they said we ordered only one.yet again we waited while other who came after us we're getting served.so with real hard time I would just give 1 out of 5.Food was atleast ok in taste.so a 3 out of 5.Realy dissatisfied with the service.

Great place for the food lovers with affordable prices. They can easily beat any one of the renowned mughlai joint in terms of food taste is concern. And top of all this you don't need to cut a whole on your pocket in the name of service tax and vat. Good ambiance, good hospitality and top of all these good food. Try to avoid Sunday for heavy crowd.

Well, my eyes fell upon this place on the very day of their inauguration on the Durga Puja of 2016! I became instantly determined to visit them someday and finally, doomsday arrived!

I placed a telephonic order for a paneer butter masala as well as dal makhani, which they promised to deliver at my home ‚Äì not very far away from their Kankurgachi based outlet. Delivery was made pretty timely ‚Äì without any additional levies for either delivery or packaging!

Coming to the food, Dal Makhani was pretty watery and tasteless. Surprisingly, it did have some fox nuts also along with rajma, however, rajma was underboiled and thus quite hard. This main course was pretty much a turn off!

However, what acted as the saviour for us (and for them also) was the superb paneer butter masala. It was an almost perfect preparation ‚Äì lots of cottage cheese topped with butter and nicely tempered, pretty high on taste. This one was a quite a treat along with the home-made phulkas!

Service is fine and prices reasonable!. Nice to see that they accept Sodexo meal vouchers as well. Quantity served is however pretty mediocre.

Overall, a decent experience ‚Äì might consider a re-visit!

i order egg biryani from here regularly, there are some points which made me able to write this post in aspect to food quality and quantity, i am a lacto-ovo vegetarian,so i often find myself troubled while ordering biryani because Egg biryani is mostly available in small shops like this.
i mostly order biryani everyday, so cant say much about other dishes available there.

1) Biryani tastes good even in the absence of gravy,
2)nothing to say about the quantity, enough for a single person
AND
3)Veg Biryani- the most uncommon, they make veg biryani separately with no sign of meats, nicely made with chopped vegetables.SO its good for vegetarians.

I am really impressed with this place.I have not been to these place so I don't know the exact ambience of the restaurant but I took quite a number of home deliveries and everytime the food was amazing.I have tasted the chicken salt and pepper,malai kofta,kadhai chicken,tandoori roti,chilli fish and sweet and sour chicken.Every item is very fresh and the quantity is huge and at the price they provide it,the food is really cheap and will make your tummy happy.I was amazed at the fish quality they use when the item charge is only Rs 160/- ,there was no fishy smell at all which is very common is other cheap chinese restaurants.I very much look forward in trying many more items from this place.

Overall a great place to dine in the seating arrangements are also good for family dinning and pretty affordable as well coz they don't charge taxes..

I had been there today with my girl and a few friends for lunch,we ordered chicken tikka for starters and for the main course we took butter naans,tandoori roti,chicken tikka masala and chicken afghani butter masala.The food was great the naan was crispy with a lot of butter,the chicken tikka masala was good as usual but the best part of the meal was the afghani butter masala which tasted great and was neither spicy nor sweet.The ambience is good and the staff are also courteous.I have visited them on previous occassions but I had only tried the thalis which are also very tasty and reasonable.All in all a very good place for delicious and pocket friendly food.

It inaugurated just before the commencement of Durga Puja and thus opened the door for North Indian and Punjabi delicacies to the people around. It is the new edition to the famed one at Manicktala.

Located beside the Kankurgachi Post Office, it is the easiest to located, does not matter if you are afoot or riding your conveyance. One can locate it to the left when passing to Bengal Chemical through Kankurgachi Moore. A two-storeyed white building with the take away section on the ground floor and dining area on the first.

It happened that I did not visit the restaurant in person as we ordered our food for take away. We first opted for placing order for home delivery. Sadly the number that was provided on their Zomato page was switched off, so we had to go there to personally fetch our food parcels( due to some reason we could not go for the online order options). We had availed their food services for three days during the Puja. Out of these three days it happend that on two days we were handed over the wrong containers and hence had to go back to the Dhaba all the way to change and bring the right food containers. It maybe because they were new and not much trained or because they were having hectic schedule because of the Puja or may have been lethargically callousness. The answer to the fault in service is not known. Hence, I would suggest that when you are there for fetching food containers from the take away counter do check before you leave.

Now the food. Well this is the part were Paul Dhaba will bag full marks. Over the three days we had ordered Rumali Rotis, Tandoori Rotuis, Chicken Bharta, Chicken Do Payaza. All tasted so good. One would think that since it is a dhaba most of its food will be spicy and at times oily. If you think so then you are wrong. They offer the right mouth tantalizing taste with the correct amount of spices and oil. The Rotis¬† were perfectly made and the chicken was rightly sauced, tender and curries were tasteful.¬† The quantity is as well justified. 

The prices here are absolutely pocket-friendly for the quality and quantity of food that they offer. It costs around 400-450 for three people.

This can be avail if you need to fetch your dinner in a hurry or while on the go. The taste will not make you unhappy.

New Paul Dhaba is expanding. Much like Goutam's they're opening up outlets in and around their main shop in Maniktala. The new shop is a lot different from the shabby old one when it comes down to it. It's larger, whiter and quite frankly, an all over better restaurant.

There used to be a dump where this restaurant is currently located, but you can hardly tell. The kitchen is open and that's always a good thing. The food is good, but it does leave an aftertaste. The naan is decent, gets a little moist if you're trying to bring it home. The Murg Bharta is fantastic, and the Kadai Lababdar is among the best ones I've had recently. They also serve massive portions, while charging nominal rates. 

The service is quick, the waiters are friendly. If take-away is the way you roll, then you might want to opt for lunchtime. Come evening, the floodlights manage to call in every single insect in the world. But it's not that big a deal if you can handle a few wings.

Ambience/Interiors: 3/5
Service: 3.5/5
Food: 3.5/5
Value for Money: 4.5/5

Thanks for reading and pardon any grammatical errors I may have made.
