No nonsense simple homely Bengali food. Big portioned fish, Dal and bhaja. Absolutely not posh. Just go for the food. Has been there for like ages. I have packed on various occasions. DO NOT order anything out of the ordinary. Just their Bengali thalis

If you’re from Kolkata, especially from South, you can not miss the huge gariahat market complex. This place is about 70years old. There’s no formal menu card. You get in, ask available and get your good. You will get a plate covered with fresh banana leaf and water in earthen bhands. Aahhh and believe me, it’s amazing!!!! You can order Mourola Machher Chochhori(fish with vegetables, locally termed as “Mourola”), Vetki Fry(Asian sea bass which tastes heavenly), Tengrar Tel-Jhol(mild fish curry), Pabda Shorshe Bata (fish in mustard sauce), Boal Machher Jhol(the famous helicopter catfish), Chingri Malai Curry (prawn in coconut sauce)and last but not the least, the mild flavoured Mutton curry, known as Kochi Pathar Jhol. I swear your taste buds will feel blessed and your heart will say please come here again!
