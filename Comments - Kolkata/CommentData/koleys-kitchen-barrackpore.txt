Have visited this outlet a number of times. Located near Barrackpur railway station this outlet is a very famous snacks junction among locals.I have tasted almost everything of this outlet.They serve good chinese  snacks. My review is based on my recent visit.I had ginger chicken and veg chowmein.
Veg chowmein -Quantity was huge.Good taste.
Ginger chicken -The gravy was not so appealing. Although chicken pieces tasted more or less good.

They have quite a wide range of food here. It's best for students like us,as all the foods are quite tasty and isn't much heavy on the pocket. Only problem is, the sitting area. they provide you chair and small stool lined up in front of the main road. But if you ask me about the food only it's best here. The Chinese thali is the most pocket friendly item on the list. And do try the Crispy chiken.

I've been a customer of Koley' Kitchen for almost 2 years & appreciated them for their food of good quality & taste @ very reasonable price....but of late I've noticed that their food quality as well as taste has been degraded sharply.
One day, I'd bought CHICKEN SPRING ROLL from them which was of very low quality & a part of it was burnt...a very bitter experience....

A small outlet near Barrackpore Station.
Its just a outlet with just normal  seating provision outside the shop. Went there just for having a quick affordable snacks.Well after having the chicken schezwan momo i  literally crave for it everyday.
I had too drums of heaven,soupy noodles which also tastes utterly good.The drums of heaven costs Rs160 max with is tooo low in price with six pieces of leg chicken pieces tossed in schezwan sauce,capsicum,spices and tastes utterly spicy and good .
The soupy noodles had a lot of soupy texture along with vegetables with the soup.
Well i must say this joint gives you a real taste of chinese food in the city. 
For me i crave for chinese food everyday so it was a cheese on the cake for meüíì and One blue tick for this place again .
Do visit it guys!

this road side food joint have always drew my attention with its 'all time' crowd. so, having go through the reviews on zomato my sister and I decided to give it a try. since they dont offer dining facility, we opted for taking the food away. so, here is my overall experience--

Price- very pocket friendly. undoubtedly a very good option for students.

ambiance- oh no!! too much over crowded. i had to repeat my order 3-4 times just to make sure that the man sitting there could heard my voice and had to wait for 40 minutes for my food. the place was a little bit dirty.

food- well, food was average. quantity was good but the quality and taste of food was not up to our expectation. manchurian chicken tasted like chilli chicken.

overall my experience was average..

Now this place is a big hit these days. A joint where you can hardly get a seat and to take ur meal you need to wait for a long time for its over populated customers. Its a famous joint in barrackpore for cllg and school goers. And now a days thay also have payment by card so a big step forward.
I had tried many of its dishes. But alove all i loved the chicken drumstick.it was so juicy and tender. Koleys special noodles its a must mention here and even the momos taste good. I didnt personally liked the fried rice and the chilly chicken. But people here fall for them too.

Koley's kitchen within a short period of time has emerged to be a famous destination of Barrackpore for chinese cuisine lovers. It has nothing much to offer when it comes to seating arrangements which comprises a few chairs and make shift tables. So the best option is to take away food rather than eat it here. The food here is one to give a try if you are in Barrackpore. All chowmien lovers in the area know what Koley's chowmien tastes like. My favourite side is drums of heaven which is really awesome. The crispy chicken served is also one to revel. Pan fried momos are another suggestion. The downside is that the quantity served is not up to the mark. Definitely not enough to fill your stomach if you are exceedingly hungry. Otherwise, got to come back here for more for its exquisite taste and variety.

Customers can choose between panfried noodles, mixed friedrice, chilly chicken,  Spring roll,  Manchow soup,  Momos to chicken lollipops. Do try as it is value for money.

I just have one complain.I have to wait every time for getting my order,specially for taking away crispy chicken.

Best Chinese place in bkp hands down . The only problem is the time they take during rush hour in the evening . Not a big place so sitting & properly enjoying the good food they serve is a bit of a bother but you forget all about it when you taste their food . Best momo , noodles , pan fried chicken in the area for sure . I do hope they get a proper place for people to sit then they will double their revenue at the very least .

Being very nostalgic while writing for this... Most probably it inaugurated in 2012/2013 when I was working in barrackpore, it was a tiny shop later changed to good shape as today's koleys kitchen. We ordered momo, chicken lolypop, soups... There was a hut type of stall just opposite to the shop, the name was Darjeeling momo, it was a famous shop, one of the cook joined this place (may b I m wrong), n this place became superhit overnight, didn't go there about 3 yrs....

No doubt it is a true fast food centre. Food quality is good and the price is under budget. Bt they have very few actually a tiny seating area. Bt for faster service  and good quality of food it is really a nice place to eat.

Its a place for quick bites..mainly it's a take away counter but you can have food in front of the outlet where small tools are placed. 
It just around Barrackpore station corner..you can easily locate it but to be precious it's just besides Khosla Electronics store.
Mainly they serve Chinese and tibetian food.
The food is great and very pocket friendly. 
And mostly I like about them that they serve gigantic quantity of food and a plate of chowmin and fried rice is enough for two people.
Service is fast and quality wise it should be appreciated.

This place is a few minutes walk from Barrackpore railway station, situated just beside Dhaka biriyani house. It is mainly the attraction of the young crowds for serving variety of foods at cheaper price. I have taken parcel from there today for the first time. Vegetable fried rice is very good at this price. The chilly chicken is tasty and they served quite big pieces of boneless chicken that is very impressive. The food in both quality and quantity is satisfactory. Only one thing that I personally don't like that is the behaviour of their staffs. They must try to improve that next time. Otherwise the food is good.

This place is located near barrackpore railway station... i had been to this place many time before... i had the chicken momo, chicken noodles, chicken spring roll, chicken lollipop from this place... the taste of the food here is good... i am a momo loving person so i often go there for chicken momo.. the only thing i dislike is the covering the place where the covering is folded is often thick and a bit undercooked.. other dishes are good.. they put up a new menu i definitely want to try them... :)
23.03.16 i went to this place to take away our dinner... i ordered veg schezuan chowmein, hongkong chowmein, singapore chowmein, crispy chicken and garlic chicken... the schezuan chowmein was the best among the other two.. it was spicy good taste, properly cooked it was good only thing off in the chowmein dish was that they were too oily... the garlic chicken also tasted good,the chicken pieces were soft, though there wasn't any flavour of garlic only could see the pieces of garlic and they serve 8 pieces of chicken per dish... finally the crispy chicken which i loved the most ¬†the chicken pieces were crispy and coated with a sauce with some toasted sesame seeds with some chunks of tomato,onion and capsicum... this dish i just loved... the price of the food here is very pocket friendly... recommended :)
05.04.16 today ordered chicken kurkure... the chicken was crispy and the coating had flavours...the amount served was also good and pocket friendly

Considering Chinese menus, tastes and price in Barrakpore and vicinity, even upto Sodepur,  this is best place. Quality of food is awesome and value for money too. Shop owner is nice person. Well mannered. However only challenge is... Not good choice if you decide to eat there. There is üí∫ arrangements but very narrow, almost over road. Commuters will be sneaking and walking over your shoulder. Also staff deployed there need little more professional... Keep them align with their owners vision...

Lately, Barrackpore has seen a boom in the food üç≤ sector. There is a rise in the no of food joints, serving quality food in reasonable price. This is one such joint, serving delicious Thai and Chinese cuisines. A good place for snacking.

Visited Barrackpore last week and discovered this place . My little bro who stays over there accompanied ¬†me .

¬†Adjacent to the Rail station on the left corner of the 4 point crossing there is this small Chinese food joint. I mean its really a good 'Chinese joint' in that region...Tried Chicken Spring Rolls and Chicken Chowmein. Both were lip smacking. Other than that varieties of good Chinese cuisines are also available..One can grab their food on their provided seats or better if they can takeaway..

Good Chinese food, Location easily accessible , Price reasonable, Prompt Service !!

Location: Outside Barrackpore rly stn, just beside Dhaka Biriyani restaurant.

Pros: 
Lip smacking Chinese food.
Special mention to the starters (chicken kurkure, crispy chicken, chicken lollypop).
One of best momos at Barrackpore, without any doubt. The soup that is served with the momo tastes superb.
Prompt service.
Great value for money.

Cons:
Outside seating, hence hygiene is a primary concern here. Also, eating here in a rainy day is not a choice. But, well yeah, you can take parcel.
Lack of proper seating arrangements, only few plastic chairs outside the stall.

Overall, good Chinese food at very reasonable price. Recommended from my side.

Barrackpore, till some time back, was hardly having any Restaurant offering authentic Chinese dishes.

Among the few joints serving Chinese food in Barrackpore recently, Koley's Kitchen stands out from the crowd.

Food: Good, but could have been better.

Price: Reasonable, worth the money spent.

Ambience: Lots of scope for improvement. The sitting arrangement is outside, almost in the road, can be redesigned with a touch of comfort for the customers would have been of great value.

Service: Moderate, quite fine for a joint like this, the service time can be reduced further.

Overall I would say with a limited options available to us in Barrackpore, in the Chinese front, Koley's Kitchen is a nice place to be with your friends for a quick bite in the evening. With family, better to have Take away ...

Very good food quality, there are many Chinese fast food center over there in barrackpore,but koley's kitchen holds the top position just becoz of their good food quality and variety of foods, you must try crispy chicken,crispy baby corn,mixed noodles,pan fried momo and non veg thali at lunch time,recently they are planning to introduce various types of rolls like shwarma roll,kabab roll etc,if u wanna give your tongue a tasty relaxation in the eve,go for koley's kitchen

Nice decor, great ambience - This place has all that a foodie needs. Keep it up. Good for casual hangouts. "Paisa bachao" resturant for enjoying with friends.

This is a good Chinese take away joint....all their rice and chow items are good ,well prepared,hygienic. Their chicken items are on the harder side but manageable.... All the whole they made good Chinese main course... In starters I have tasted momos, spring rolls ,lolypop... Among them the pan fried momo is my choice....they bit spicy, but have a great taste....easy road side eatery.... Nice take away joint....

Situated at a stone's throw away from the station, this place has become a hub for people looking for a quick bite on a budget.

Being curious I decided to try out the place myself. I ordered an old classic, chicken momo. It was served pipping hot with soup and two sauces. The momos were good. I especially liked how it was silky and not doughy which is rare in such price range.

The service was quick and the seating outside was comfortable for a food shack. This place gives you a bang for your buck and I  would definitely go back to try more stuff.

This place was a much needed addition to the long list of eateries present in Barrackpore. Located just beside the station campus (like most of the eateries of the area), this place is a dedicated take away establishment. The service is really prompt and the food served is pretty good considering the price. Their signature noodles is definitely worth a try along with the schezwan chicken.All in all, a really good 'value for money' Chinese food outlet. Definitely worth a visit (or more) :)

One of the cool joint I must say. Starting from their Momos, Sheifalis, Manchurians to different Noodles, Chicken buskets etc. all the preparations are just awesome. Being a bong foodie, I must look after quality and quantity at the same time. Hence KK is the perfect match of my choice. It is specially a take away counter, though can be managed if any one wants to have the food there itself. I wanted to give them 4.5 however, deducting 0.5 only because if any one is asking for the home delivery, they only provide that facility if only the total bill is above 500/-.
Overall a thumbs up for KK...

this chinese and tibetian  food joint is located very near to barrackpore station. it is mainly a take away counter but if you wish you can have it right there on the tools and chairs placed right on the street infront of it.  
quantity and quality wise its the best in the lot. taste sometimes vary from average to excellent, but most of the time the score is always on higher side. the main greatness is about the quantity of food they serve. 1plate chicken chowmein is enough to serve two people.
the food is always fresh and i never found a thing to complain. behaviour is very very good specialy the owner mr gaurav koley  deals with the customer personally and suits you through the palatable process .

‚ÄòKoley's Kitchen‚Äô located in-between Dhaka biryani house & Sona restaurant, just 1 min walking from Barrackpore station. It‚Äôs solely a takeaway counter. Last night I tried their ‚ÄòChicken Momo‚Äô, ‚ÄòFried Chicken Leg‚Äô & ‚ÄòChicken Spring Roll‚Äô. Service was lightning fast. I liked their food but everything tasted just average. As per pricing quantity was pretty good. I parcelled ‚ÄòPrawn Cutlet‚Äô & ‚ÄòChicken Momo‚Äô, my wife and son found them testy. I can definitely recommend this place to casual dinners.
