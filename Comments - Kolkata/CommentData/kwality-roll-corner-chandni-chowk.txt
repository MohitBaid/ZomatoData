I have had taken a roll from this restaurant while walking towards Esplanade along Lenin Sarani. As I was walking past, my stomach gave me various warnings that it was void of a meal amd hence I grabbed a roll from the immediate outlet possible and it turned out to be, "Kwality Roll Centre".

In my opinion, it was nothing out of ordinary and places itself among the busiest place of Kolkata. Since I was too hungry I was satisfied with the taste and also because of these few reasons:
- Roll making was done in minutes and hence I was at all smiles
- I did not have to wait in line for order, rather, they asked me what I wanted and did not even took the payment till the roll was done
- Serving was clean
- A small seating area is there too

Being located just on Lenin Sarani, it does not possess that "X" factor which will make people like me visit it over again!

Chandni Chowk is counted as busy streets in Kolkata & people in hurry loves to have the street rolls over here. Although their is lots of Roll counters in Chandni Chowk still Kwality Roll Corner grabs some special attention because of their such low pricing & their liver roll that is not available in every roll counter.

Decoration : The shop is very old fashioned & doesn't seem at all clean & hygienic. However as its a take away counter you will get the same street food experience.

Service : The service is pretty fast even in the crowded positions.

Rolls : I had tried their most of the rolls but their Liver Roll impressed me every time. The rolls are made with normal Parathas that is not much thick & not at all crispy fried. But the Chicken, Mutton to Liver every thing inside it tasted good. Diced pieces are soft, very spicy & juicy enough to be liked. They even fry the onions if you say them to do that. Added lemon provides some fragrance too. Sauces used for the rolls is low quality but before complaining think about the price twice. Undoubtedly this is one of the best value for money food you can get on the streets of Chandni Chowk.

Conclusion : If you love your pocket & doesn't have much problem with street foods then this place is a must try. Kwality Roll Corner definitely delivers good quality food for a very low price to fill you tummy at hurry times.
