Just ridiculous...
it was end of day we ordered fried rice+ baby corn + veg munchurian combo(we ordered paneer but they themselves changed it to veg munchurian saying paneer will take time) and chole bature......
fried rice was good not too bad like all others
veg munchurian was shitty terrible yukkk.....
bature ...those were anything but batures ...ridiculous.....
chola -too below average....didn't have enough salt only good part from the shopkeeper was that when I wanted more chole since the quantity was extremely low they gave extra chole
baby corn -just ok nothing to write about
had a terrible experience with this one

It is one of the many food outlets of the Diamond Plaza mall food court. The notable features can be summarised as --

The good --
i. The service is prompt.
ii. The food is good - Chicken hakka noodles and schezwan chicken are recommended.

The bad --
None in particular.

Overall --
If someone is looking for good decent food at a friendly pocket pinch, Global Bengal is the one for you. But, the fact of the matter is, there is not any single feature which distinguishes this place, it is good no doubt, but just like any other food court outlet.

Situated inside Diamond Plaza, this outlet gives you an authentic Chinese experience. Spacious interiors, attractive combo offers, cooperative staff, gives you lot of reasons to visit this after a huge shopping.

D outlet is located in d foodcourt of mani square & they hv a varied & affordable menu...especially d combo deals & sizzlers r very pocket friendly...but i found d fried rice & chowmien to b very mediocre & lacking in spices...but the gravy dishes were satisfactory enough .The staff was polite but not well versed with the menu.
