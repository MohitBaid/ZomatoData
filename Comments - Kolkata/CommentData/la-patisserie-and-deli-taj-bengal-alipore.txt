To be frank wanted to know how a cake tastes from a bakery of a five star. And believe me it tasted heavenly. The other items i tried were equally great.

For a perfect cake for those special occasion La Patisserie will never disappointment you. Ordered Red Velvet Cake for spouse birthday. Was delivered on time with the exact instructions as given earlier. The red velvet with layers of cheese has its every bite so juicy and yet light like velvet. Just melts in the mouth. 

No one in the city can bake Red Velvet Cake better than them. Yes quality comes with a cost. 1 pound will cost you	‚Çπ 1020 while 2 pounds will cost you ‚Çπ1940.

Don't forget to try their other specialties like Chocolate Truffle Cake and Lemon Berry Cake. Price will be lesser than Red Velvet Cake.

Opposite Alipore Zoo, is our very own Taj Bengal. La Patisserie and Deli is the best bakery in town! 
Try the chicken patty and order a birthday cake (blue berry cheese cake) just the way i did. You are not gonna regret. The brown bread that they bake is also highly recommended.

Love the pastries, cakes and breads from this place. The butterscotch cake with a peanut layering is my favourite. Love the cheese bread and the chocolate tarts. The chocolate truffle pastry is filling and made of pure chocolate. The chocolate mousse is perfectly set and the chicks toppings is an attraction. 
Love the mushroom puff also.

A small and pretty place to grab a quick bite. Lovely assortment of pastries and cakes to look at. They have a simple and easy range of sweet and savoury items to choose from. Though it's a difficult task to choose since everything looks so good. But at last we settled for Chicken Tikka Strudel, Danish Pastry, Chocolate Cronut, Blueberry and Orange Cheesecake. They even give a tiny jar of ketchup to go with the meal. It was a very enjoyable meal especially the beautiful desserts were very satisfactory.

La Patisserie and Deli at The Taj Bengal is a gem! One of the most luxurious patisseries in town has loads to offer. After having a good Saturday's lunch at The Hub, visited this wonderful place, located right at the corner of The Taj Bengal. It's a good 5 minutes walk from the main lobby area, full of attractive shops. 
Right from Red Velvet cheesecake, Blueberry cheese, to blackforest and more, you get what you want! They even accept orders, so that's good.
I tasted their chocolate truffle and red velvet cheesecake, both were absolutely delicious, soft and luscious, enough to make people salivate! 
A must visit when you're at the taj!

It was full of Tri colour pastries and cakes. One of the most interesting was a chocolate shoe and Tri Colour cupcake. Had a Red velvet cupcake and Chocolate Pastry. Both were made to perfection. 

Overall, the whole experience  was great and worth the penny.

Had my birthday cake from here. We had chocolate truffle, blueberry parfait and chicken focaccia sandwich from there. Chicken focaccia was full of chicken and the sandwich bread was freshly baked. Chocolate truffle simply melts in your mouth and given it's size and amount of rich chocolate content it was difficulty for me to complete it in one go. Blueberry parfait was also made to the perfect with slight tangy ness. Given the Patisserie in a five star property and both the quality and quantity of pastries and sandwich the price was quite reasonable.
P.S Chocolate truffle is a must have if you visit this cake shop. Simply put a spoonful inside your mouth, close your eyes and relish, it will melt inside automatically.

Whenever I come to Taj to dine at any of its restaurants, I don't miss the opportunity to take home a few of their pastries. Because for me, this is the best bakery in Kolkata. No matter what I tried, it was always awesome, made with highest quality ingredients possible. Special mention is due to anything they make with chocolate or blueberry. Considering the sizes,¬† (pastries are large enough to be shared by two) and quality, the prices are quite reasonable too.

An honest bakery which serves freshly prepared bread, pastries and savouries at very compelling prices even though it's a five star bakery. After 8 pm most stuff is sold at a large discount to free the shelves for the freshly baked goods the next day. Their whole wheat bread is a favourite. Chicken Quiche, spinach strudel and pastries are all tasty and great for takeaways. Not a fan of their cheesecake, but would recommend their fruit flavoured pastries and cakes - orange, etc.

Well, someone arranged their signature pastry ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Taj Truffle pastry‚Äù for me, and I am glad she did so! The pastry was so cutely packed in a takeaway parcel that I was initially hesitant to remove it, nevertheless, did it so after clicking a few pics thereof! This gesture unearthed this beauty of a pastry ‚Äì Taj truffle ‚Äì which indeed does justice to it‚Äôs name as well as to it‚Äôs price. 

Size was huge and I just could not finish it off in a single go. Presentation, very nice and you could simply keep on staring and adoring the pastry. It was so soft, as if prepared moments back, although, I could consume it only after storing it for a day or two. Most importantly, it was very very tasty, simply out of the world ‚Äì indeed an apt signature item for a 5 star. What amazed me the most was that it was neither too creamy, nor too sweet ‚Äì just perfectly balanced!

Really looking forward to visit this place in person soon!

This is a time when Kolkata seems to be a little confused about the bakery market. The new bakeries are penetrating deep into the hearts of Kolkatans . This place has perfectly kept its formula in place. You will find a lot of innovation in their products and at the same time it has taken utmost care of the traditional ones. The chicken leek tastes exactly the same the way it used to do in the 90s....and I think that's the best part. And its a bakery situated inside a premium hotel in Kolkata, but if you actually compare the portions with the price that you pay, its absolutely value for money. I would prefer this place over any other bakery at least if I am in Kolkata.

Most pocket friendly gourmet bakery you can have in the area. Comes with tonnes of heritage and prestige, the number of people and celebrities who have walked in and out of the glass doors getting their fix of pastries will fill out dozens of registers. No frills seating which is one area that they can look at changing, but then why fix what's not broken. Chocolate brownie, lamb pie and Mexican quiche have left deep marks on the palate.

Its a small place with many savoury and sweet items.. Once u enter the place u cn smell the freshly baked stuffs.. From patties to sandwiches to cakes and pastries all the stuffs are highly recommended... The breads out here are great too.. On my visit i had tried thr blueberry cake along with the chocolate pastry.. Both of which were gud too.. Chilli chicken crossiant was gud too.. Some savoury delights on the lists include- chicken hawaiian sandwich, mayo and egg sandwich, chilli chicken crossiant, and chicken quiche!! Too sum it up the prices are not too high so u cn easily grab a cup of coffee along wid a sandwich or a puff !!

This is a wonderful place to commence the journey of the day from. This patisserie is located at the rear of the Taj Bengal but within the Taj. It is one of Taj's gems.

I have had so many different kinds of food from this place ranging from pastries of sorts to savouries of sorts. I also had different types of buns, sandwiches and breads as in bakery delicacies from here.

The service is commendable but yes the prices are a bit high.

This is practically not a restaurant but rather an eatery and a take-away joint. The place is rather small. Although there is a little stand to place your dish while you eat from it, it can be a tad difficult if too many people walk in.

But having said that, the place is a wonderful one and not really chock-full for most part of the day as it is very much a take-away corner too.

I would recommend you to definitely try it out once. I loved the experience I am sure you will too.

La patisserie is a bakery which is charming because of their wide range of breads and cakes they offer. 
Their breads are good and fresh always.
Pasties and cakes in chocolate will tempt u to indulge more. In the fruit flavours,the pineapple pastry is very light, fresh and a must go for! 
However m less keen of their cheesecakes and find them to be okaish! :)

A true gem.

Hidden in the basement away from prying eyes near the crystal hall is this smallest public space at the Taj Bengal.

The Black Forest,the caramel crunch,the chocolate pastries,the cakes for wedding and birthdays,the quiche all above par.

A bonus are the other bottled and packed products sold on retail.

After a heavy lunch at the Taj skip the dessert and saunter here.The walk will help you digest your food as well as create space for Kolkata's best patisserie barring the Calcutta Club.

The Pastry shop at the Taj has a limited repertoire but is a good place to pickup some goodies if youre visiting some friends. You can also take home some of the stuff--the croissants are soft and substantial and make a good addition to breakfast ! The mushroom quiche is tasty and the pastry is light and not oily. The Egg Tuna sandwich are wholesome and if youre partial to tuna you can make a meal of it. The Blueberry and black forest are yummy although a bit sweet. The chocolates are basically milk and not dark¬† and found them too sweet and a bit overpriced. If you have time,¬†¬†then there are much better selections and quality available at a number of speciality outlets elsewhere.

We ordered a small pound chocolate cake for my birthday and twice more since then to give friends.. This place has been a huge expensive disappointment every time. A simple chocolate truffle cake was so bad so I wouldn't go ahead for high funda desserts. The cake seemed like they were baked two days ago and thrown in the fridge ever since. The sponge cake was so stiff and dry and rubbery. Our friends who had insisted on Taj were also highly disappointed given the fact that a humble 'Cakes' can give a way better trufle cake for half the cost!

Best bakery in town. Their breads crossiant pastries are all amazing. Do try frozen pineapple pudding if you love puddings. I love it though I'm not a big fan of puddings and prefer pastry to it. Twice they made this fresh for me and it blew me off!

Probably the best bakery in the city.....some people might say its overpriced but i think depending on the delicacy and taste of the cakes, i think its fine. The black forest cake is the best cake over there. U might also like to taste the cheese cakes .....they r made just next to perfection and melt in ur mouth like smoothies. A must try for sweet tooths...

We ordered a small pound chocolate cake for my birthday and twice more since then to give friends.. This place has been a huge expensive disappointment every time. A simple chocolate truffle cake was so bad so I wouldn't go ahead for high funda desserts. The cake seemed like they were baked two days ago and thrown in the fridge ever since. The sponge cake was so stiff and dry and rubbery. Our friends who had insisted on Taj were also highly disappointed given the fact that a humble 'Cakes' can give a way better trufle cake for half the cost!

La Patisserie and Deli serves the best Pastries that I have had in my life. Rs.100 for a pastry that looks yummy and tastes yummy and for the feel of eating out in a five star isn't too expensive. I would definitely recommend all Pastry lovers to visit the place and eat any pastry that you like. You will surely love it :)

Location: Alipore. 

Without a doubt this is the best patisserie in the city, with it's own con of being a costly affair. 

But, the offerings out here are to die for! 
Naming a few,

The Dark Chocolate Truffle Cake 
An absolute delicacy. 
No cake can match up to it's level. 
Highly recommended. 

The Blueberry Cheese Cake 
It's amazing! 

The Quiches and Croissants are great to taste.
Mushroom quiche is especially recommended. 

The list of amazingness can simply go on! 
Tiramisu, Multigrain loaf, Mexican brownie and so on.¬† 
Cut short, simply awesome! 

A rather pricey affair. 

Overall a great experience. :-)

I do not need to make it evident that La Patisserie and Deli is brilliant as its a part of the five star Taj Bengal. I have always received my birthday cake from here as a gift by my brother in law for the years that he spent in Kolkata. Needless to say, all the cakes were absolutely wonderful. Last year I had my five year old niece for Christmas at my home and she wanted a Christmas cake. So I decided on La Patisserie and got a Christmas customised vanilla flavoured pastry for her with little bells and a tiny Christmas tree on it (I have attached the photo). She was overjoyed and I loved La Patisserie and Deli more.

The best bakery in Kolkata and thats a no contest really! A lovely spread of cakes, pastries and breads! The differentiating factor is their breads - the widest and most inventive fresh from the oven range. Highly recommend La Patisserie!

Dear Food lovers . 

I know that i have been dormant for a very long time but here i am ! The same old food traveller ! 

Most of us have this pre conceived notion about 5 star hotels being all talks and no action ! However , even though i am a stern believer in this , i would recommend you to try out La Pat , most commonly known as La Patisserie at Taj Bengal . Not for anything else but just the croissant ! The chocolate croissant is to Die for ! And i am not exaggerating at all . The plain croissant is also very very good . Crisp from outside and flaky from inside . You can feel the butter melting inside your mouth. And your heart will go omnumnum ;)

The mexican brownie is another thing to talk about . Awesomeness ! The chocolate chunks inside the fudge brownie ! You don't need to pair it with anything else !  
Some other delights -- chocolate chiffon cupcake, chocolate chiffon slice , multigrain cupcake , butter cake, vanilla sponge, opera cake . 
In savouries , the best thing ever , chicken tikka croissant sandwich . I have never had anything so incredible ! I can totally vouch for it . You must try this babe . Its a blockbuster . My second most favourite thing on the menu would be mushroom and cheese quiche . It is a shame that non veggies like me think that mushroom is a substitute for meat for the poor veggies . To them - please try the mushroom quiche. You will get to know why god made such a delicious umbrella for the poor frog . 
The third thing - would be the chicken tikka strudel ! The best strudel ever ! With huge chunks of chicken marinated in the tikka gravy and then the puff pastry ! Small suggestion - please heat it up when you eat it . Trust me , you want to feel the butter :) 
Some savoury delights on the list - chicken Hawaiian sandwich, tuna and egg sandwich, chilli chicken croissant , chicken quiche . 
To sum it all , the prices are also not sky high so you can just sip on some coffee at home with your perfect sandwich or brownie and just love life :)
For more feeds , let me know , till then , Happy Eating !

Taj Group of Hotels has always been my first preference for any food items. Be it a food festival or candle light dinner or the yummy cakes & pastries.
This time i would like to say that Taj Bengal La Patisserie has a good collection of items in their stock. 
Going to Taj and having it is a rare occasion. But i always prefer to order.
Firstly, would like to thank their staff for their pleasing approach. Every order which is taken they first listen and then give their suggestions.
Secondly, would like to appreciate the Chef who prepares exactly the way i tell them. Last time i ordered a sugarless & eggless cake for my mom's birthday. The cake cum pastry was awesome and perfect to my requirement.
Lastly, would like to appreciate their deliveries. I have seen so many other vendors who spoil the cake when its delivered. But Taj has kept its quality in this. None of the parts of cake is spoiled. It looks as if its fresh from oven. 
I don't think price is a factor. Its the same as per market standards.

Below are my rating:-

Staff : 4/5
Taste : 5/5
Delivery : 5/5
Price : 4/5

Thanks Taj for being there all the time when needed.

Regards
Vicky

A little pastry shop, like desert shops should be. 

There are a few pastries on offer and the balance is a bit on the sweeter side for my taste but it is rich and over all, they give you a pretty positive feel. 

I like how usually you do not find many people here. There is just one table without seats. You go there, eat your pastry, move out. 

I would love for them to provide espressos too after the pastry but then it wouldn't be a little shop any more, would it?

The premium cake shop has its cons in the form of an expensive price tag and most items often out of stock at wee hours of the day... Yet, you simply cannot match the amazing taste of its truffle pastries, its chocolates and cheese cakes... No other cake shop in Kolkata is so authentic and brilliant in its bakeries....!!! The sweets, however, are much better than the snacks - you can skip the patties and puffs, they're blah... But it can be considered criminal to not step into this confectionary merely for the pastries, in case you're in that area.

I am shocked at having to give low ratings and write a not so rosy review for this outlet. Only my second visit last evening. Since I was at the Taj in any case, I thought of dropping by. It was almost 8 pm and some of the items were out of stock.

I zeroed on to the cheesecake, my favourite. A Mango one. The Rs 150 pricetag for a small 3" diameter and 1" high  piece kind of put me off. But it is Taj I reasoned. What also looked nice was the Chocolate Chiffon, a mousse creation. Packed two and took home. Even though the prices indicated were nett, I was charged an extra Rs 3, which the gentleman explained was due to the increase in taxes. Rather cheap I thought, they could have easily have absorbed that.

At home, tried the Chiffon at first. Maybe the fact it was less sweet, or whatever it is, I found it nothing extraordinary, absolutely nothing to justify the 125 pricetag. This morning I tasted the cheesecake. Another disappointment. The flavouring was fine, the fact that it was a baked cheesecake added to the appeal, but the cheese part was not really cheesy. It was more of floury!

Disappointment! Or are my tastes too rustic... I don't think so.

As a aside, I wish confectioners would stop using Alphonso mango as toppings and stick to our far superior (and less expensive) Himsagar.

There could not have been a better pattisserie shop in the city. Undoubtedly, its the BEST. The  blueberry cheesecake here is marvelous. And so is their seasonal strawberry and mango cake. The savouries are fantastic too, but the sweet delights are out of this world. The chocolate truffle, the mousse and the tiramisu. Naming them makes my mouth water already. Not to forget their section of breads - the multigrain being my favourite, is amazing. Each time I visit La Patt I end up falling more in love with the place. That's the kind of magic the place has.

There are times when indulgence becomes necessary and I somehow feel there is nothing more indulgent or elegant than an afternoon tea party. The Taj is a place for wealth and elegance and for some of us who fall short of being wealthy they thankfully have places in The Taj which are affordable. This is the best patisserie in town bar none. The Truffle pastry is rich with the best quality chocolate being used which leaves a sense of pleasure in all your senses. The caramel crunch is deliciously perfect. They make the caramel to perfection. I usually stick to their section of pastry since their savoury items aren't very special as per my taste but their range of bread is impressive and delicious. Everyone has the right to indulge and for that a certain Parsi owned chain of hotels is ready to take care of your longings.  Their brownies need a special mention for being moist and rich. There is only one better brownie I have had in the heart of downtown Bombay.

I want to be a billionaire so freaking bad.....and one of the reason would be so that I could visit this place very often. The pastries and desserts are just out of the world but yes the pricing is super duper high. But I guess that's what you can expect from the bakery located at Taj. But trust me the taste and ambience is so impressive that you wouldn't mind paying that much. I love their black forest, caramel and tiramisu flavoured cakes. The ambience is absolutely brilliantly done and looks like you are in US or any European country. Wish I could come here everyday but then the price and amount of calories that I would gain prevents me from doing so. 
This place deserves 4 and above for the amazing experience it gives you.

LA PATISSERIE AND DELI.. It is located in Taj Bengal, Belvedere Road, Alipore..
Has to be one of the best Patisserie in the city.. Their Dark Chocolate Truffle Cake is to die for. It is drop dead sinful!
The croissants are good and so are their Quiches and Strudels.
The huge plus point is that they give a flat fifty percent off during the happy hours they have between 7:30 to 8:30 in the evening (to clear off their day's stock, basically :P but who cares!) It's awesome ;)
Four and half stars from me :D

Undoubtedly the best Patisserie in Kolkata ...... tucked into the rear wing of the Taj Bengal this is absolutely the perfect place for a quick bite .... I love the Chicken Quiche here ..... subtly yet perfect flavors that tickle the palette .... their hand made chocolates are excellent and their palmiers are super .... they also make some wonderful cakes and a wonderful danish pastry and chocolate croissant. They have a "happy - hours " daily between 730 to 8-30 where all the bakery products are at a 50% discount.
