The kesar and strawberry falooda was quite well done and so was the quality of the mixed chat. Well behaved people at the counter. The order was delayed though.

Their counter is a part of hangout city centre , i tried a plate of chola batora from here. Took 10 minutes to serve , the food was good enough, the chola was lesser in quantity and the platter priced really high with additional vat. Morover an additional bowl of chana will cost more 70 inr. not a value for money deal.
