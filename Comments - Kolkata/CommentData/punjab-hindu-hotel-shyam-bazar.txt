মোটামুটি। চলে যায়। 
এমন কিছু আহামরি নয়। আবার ফেলে দেওয়ার মতো ও নয়।
দাম বেশী। এর থেকে উল্টোদিকে ফুটপাথের দোকান গুলোতে ভাল চাউমিন বানায়। ওয়েটারের ব‍্যবহার ভাল না।

Ended up eating in this resturant out of sheer bad luck. Food was awful (ordered chicken biriyani) in taste. Place was also very unhygeinic and service was late. Kept waiting for a long time before food was served and behaviour of waiter was also very rude

Location: shyambazar 5 point crossing , beside GOLBARI. This is a very old hotel. They serve regular bengali food. We had rice, mach er jhol, ruti, kosha mangsho. The place is very crowded. The food was good and price was okay. But you can't expect hygiene and sweet behaviour of the staffs here. All of them are always in a hurry.

Have fish rice today. This hotel is cheap but nothing extraordinary. The points it earned from me is for sake of less price and alubhaja. Veg is full of potatoes too leading my irritation.

It's a those type of hotel we visit when we have pocket crunches but still want to have something spicy . I first time visited it 2 weeks ago around 3 in the afternoon. With the table chairs  neatly arranged and  clean floor were giving the surroundings a clean look. We sat in a six chaired table oppositely but the manager asked to sit us on either side of the table. In the meantime , other two customers asked whether their food would take more time to prepare( I understood that they were waiting for long). The manager hearing this literally chastised them and told them that if you can't wait this long then next time you first call me and then come. A lungi-genji cladded waiter came to our table with a vexed face and took order. We ordered one egg roll and one chicken chow min. But we heard him saying to the cooks one chicken roll and one chicken chow  min. We called the waiter and corrected him. He was again with a vexed face and this time more annoyed. When the order came he served us chicken roll instead of egg  roll !! Even after correcting them they did it. Now, the chicken chow min was okay for the taste buds but the chicken roll was utterly bad. Next, We paid and left. :)

Located just beside the fabled Golbari, this 'not so famous' eatery serves  decent mutton kosha with roomali roti. Had more satisfying experience as compared to Golbari.

It sometimes gets overshadowed with Golbari sniffing on its shoulders and all the momo joints and tripti just beside it. However, they have some decent offering as far as the chicken kasha, egg tarka, cutelts are concerned. It is reasonably priced. Small place with congested sitting arrangements, but makes up for it with some selected Indian dishes. They claim to have a very good mughlai paratha, but its actually not that good

Horrible experience. Situated just beside the famous golbari.
Food- We ordered three rice thali. The thali only contained rice dal and fish curry. There was no sabji in it. You need to pay for everything seperately. Even for half a piece lemon they charhged rs. 3. There was no salte in dal. Fish curry was not at all good.

Ambience- The place is small. The behaviour of the food servers are not at all good.

Definitely will not visit again in my life.

Located near Shyambazar Five Point Crossing, beside Golbari.
The ambience is poor. Has seating arrangements done but very congested.
The menu is hung on the wall. So you can see and order accordingly.
Tried Rumali Roti, Tadka. It's nice and Price is reasonable.
It has room for improvements in food quality.

Overall, it's okay to visit. But you have other options too !

Yesterday I visited this place with family at 1:00 p.m. and ordered for Mutton Biryani and Chicken Masala. I ate the worst biriyani of my life here. The quality was very bad. Most probably they served the last nights stuff. Very bad experience.

Location and Description: At the shyambazar Five points near Gol bari. Not very renowned but have some very good menu set for the likings of the customers. Deals with North Indian, Mughlai and Chinese Food. 

Ambience and Staff: Ambience is not so big very few sitting arrangement but enough for sitting with ordinary hotel type walls . Not been there for dine in so cant tell about the Staffs. 

Food: So for the Food i can't tell much i just had Egg Chicken roll long ago with my friends. I remember the paratha was very good but on a oily side, The chicken was good and fried well with good quantity. Taste was fine like any other Rolls in the city.

QNQ and prices: Quality is average and quantity is good. Prices are ver reasonable.

Conclusion: The Biriyani here is very good as i heard and the snacks are also very good as per my info.

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

This is a small joint right next to golbari. They have a menu on the wall serving mostly snacks and a few mains.
Moghlai paratha, tarka and mutter paneer are the things I like having here. 
They also serve chowmeins,rolls etc which has failed to impress me.

This place is right next to Golbari. It has the most amazing mutton kasha and rumali roti. The place is clean and pretty hygenic. The service is good too. The mutton kasha serves 6 good pieces and lots of gravy in one plate costing only 145 rupees. The rumali rotis are 6 per piece and amazingly tasty. This place is a must visit.

I dropped by this place located right at Shyambazar five point crossing and adjacent to the iconic Golbari for a quick lunch.I was amazed at the amount of people having their lunch here.It was incredibly crowded even at 3pm in the afternoon.It is a small non ac joint.The interior is rather claustrophobic.

They have simple veg thali mach bhat to the elaborate biryani and chap in their menu.I tried their tarka and rumali roti which seemed to be the most popular choice.The tarka I must admit was quite nice.I do not know of the other preparations.But they seemed a bit over priced considering the ambiance.

The staff did a decent job considering the huge rush.The prices are more or less reasonable when it comes to the more simple dishes like the tarka.But the mutton preparations were priced steeply.Hygiene and cleanliness is also an issue.

Overall I felt it is a decent place mainly for their tarka.

Grading a place isn't that easy in my view, may be they have a small space, seating arrangements aren't that comfy but when it comes to customer service n food quantity they can make u feel like home, food quality need to be improved a little though. Indian, continental n chinese foods are available here,so a wide range of menu options.
