Roadside eatery serving almost the best South Indian I have had in the recent past!! They make the best Mysore Masala dosa in town! The prices are very reasonable and sitting and service is very basic. They had a number of orders pending and were not willing to serve us coffee but a little persuasion and they managed to make amazing filter coffee!! A good eatery, perfect for breakfast or evening snacks!

I wasn't a dosa lover until i discovered this place they make some awfully delicious dosa's. The ambience is not up to the mark as its not a restaurant though according to its price is good.

Located at HB Block in Sector 3, Salt Lake ( near Big Bazaar ) this is a great place to have south Indian dishes . Their interiors & ambiance have nothing to talk about but the food is of top quality . Served on a banana leaf the dosa , uttapam , vada etc are simply outstanding & at their prices it's a great value for money . Sitting arrangement consists of only two 4×4 tables & your food will be prepared right in front of your eyes ( the place is so small , wish they had a bigger place ) . Home delivery is also available but only for nearby places . Don't get distracted by the looks of this place & enjoy their delicacies .

I am a very loyal to this food joint... whenever I need to munch anything I just ask them to serve. Actually the restaurant belongs to my house only. So it's just a order away to get food for me. Generally I order their plain butter dosa with extra maska....I just love it....the owner Sanjay is just brother like to me. Thanks for everything Sanjay. Actually right now also I am munching my favorite butter plain dosa....

The lack of space and fancy ambience at Shiv Sai is more than made up for by their wonderfully comforting food and service. Try their filter coffee and double butter (trust me!) dosa, and end your meal with their rawa kesari.

Recommended for Budget dining and South Indian food. 

This small place is tucked away in Sector - 3, Salt Lake nearby the Carnival Cinemas. You can ask anyone near Carnival Cinemas for the way to Shiv Sai. At the first sight, it may look as a shack but one should not be mistaken by the look because the food here is absolutely awesome and delicious. Moreover, the place is quite clean and hygienic. 

The place gets crowded at the peak hours as it has limited seating capacity and is thronged by a lot of students. This place serves Dosa, Uttapam, Idly Vada, Curd Rice and other South Indian dishes. Dosa can be ordered in various combination of cheese, masala, molagapoddi, rava etc. according to one's preference. The dishes are prepared fresh and served hot with unlimited amount of chutney and sambar, added with a smile from the staff. Filter coffee and Rava Keshari is a must try. 

This place is pocket friendly as it is super cheap and the taste and quantity is value for money visit in Salt Lake.

For people in search of a sumptuous and filling, try their Thai which serves unlimited food. And after you have had you meal, please try Rava Kaesari and filter coffee.

I have always been a fan of South Indian food, and after living in Bangalore for several years  and being introduced to several dishes there, I craved for the taste of authentic South Indian dishes in Kolkata. After much research and reading the great reviews on zomato I decided to try out this place. We got food delivered at home. The menu offered a variety of dishes, various types of dosas, idlis, utthapams and rice. We decided to go for Masala dosa. And must say I am super happy. Everything was perfect, the masala filling, the thick coconut chutney, the perfect blend of spices in the sambhar. And they serve generous portions of chutney and sambhar. I am definitely going to try out the other dishes soon.

A pure vegetarian place for South Indian food options.

##Location: 
HB block near Carnival Cinemas.

##Experience:
I always had a pleasant experience every time  I visit this place specially because of the cordial behavior of the owners of this place. As the owners are from Tamil origin they have kept the authenticity alive with the preparation styles its not Kolkata style south indian food rather its close to the pure ones.
A wide range of variety in dosa,Idlies , Uttapam,Vada is added in their offerings which is served fresh as its made right after you order .Also the filter coffee is worth a mention as it is quite refreshing and must try here.
Will surely come back again and again .

Not so impressive looking place, but their Dosas and Filter Coffee is to die for. Been here more than an year back and I am still impressed with the homely feeling this place has. The Dosa was super yummy and served on a banana leaf. The filter coffee was absolutely brilliant with no words for its praise. The pricing is super cheap as well and won't hurt your pockets. If anyone is looking for a decent joint serving South Indian staples, please do drop in here.

Located at salt lake sector 3, this place is situated very close to Carnival cinemas. Since it is in close vicinity of my college hence we kept visiting it all through our college years. A humble shack run by a jovial couple of Tamil roots this place is a strict vegetarian outlet serving dosa, uttampam, idlis of different styles. (Cheese, plain, masala, butter etc)The food here is made right after you order so it's absolutely fresh. The cheese masala dosa is my personal favorite. 😍 The filter coffee served here is authentic as well. The attendants are very polite and efficient. One can take n number of helpings of chutney/ sambar without a single frown on the server's face. One of the best south Indian food outlets in Calcutta according to me. Must try.

Just saw this place being seated in car mentioning south Indian  and felt like laughing looking at the ambiance but when noticed this place and people seated there I immediately changed my mind to visit this place once and finally I could managed to visit this place . Ordered mysore masala dona which was served in bannana leaf placed on a pattal. Dosa was awesome as expected and chutney was made from pure coconut whereas in other good  places also you will find that chutney is prepared from dal and coconut. Price is reasonable and you get various varieties of dosa , uttapam , rice and meal with great service.

But as soon as your dishes reach your table it's like WOW. Doesn't have seating arrangement more than 8 people but the taste compensates the inconvenience. 
Obviously it cannot be called an authentic South Indian food joint but serves varieties of dishes keeping in mind the taste preferences of Non South Indians. Not to miss the Mixed Uttapams and Dahi Vadas.

A proper south Indian joint.. Good thing about this place is the variety of south Indian food you get like sambar rice, lemon rice, pongal etc in addition to the usual idli, dosa etc you will get in other south indian joints across Kolkata. A negative that can be said is lack of proper ambience of a hotel. However, it is more than compensated by the taste and quality of food served. Will recommend this to anyone who likes south Indian food.

Cheap, tasty and amazing south Indian food... The upma is really good and also the various dosas... U get two kinds of chutney. It's not very overpriced and also provides home delivery at a minimal cost... The delivery is also fast so it is worth going... It could have been five stars if the sambhar would have improved a bit and the seating and Ambien inside could be improved. Overall its a great place to order breakfast from if you live in salt lake... :)

Review : Ahhaannn South Indian mama...
Super Masala Dosa... Lovely tasty masala dosa and in most of the shop we get only two chutnis as samvar and the chutney , but here we get an extra chutney as "tamatar chutney" and thats really tasty... 

Presentation : Nicely made and presented with banana leaf.

Price : Not much expensive only rs 45 for masala dosha..

Ratting : I will rate 4/5.
Rmb review.: perespective may matter.

Located near the EZCC Big Bazaar, the inconspicuous and unimpressive-looking eatery going by the name of 'Shiv Sai Snacks' is anything but inviting. However, if you let go of your inhibitions, step into this cosy place with plastic tables and chairs, and savour the food, you will realise that looks truly are deceiving.

I have been frequenting the joint since my school days and I absolutely adore the food they make. Crispy yet less oily, their dosas are authentic and delicious. They serve generous amounts of chutney and sambhar (both spot on with their flavours) an unlimited number of times - something I love to see in South Indian restaurants. The idlis and vadas are quite large and filling. 

Run by a friendly South-Indian lady, low on manpower, the small place is not ideal for home-delivery but if you love your dosa being swiftly served to you on banana leaves, do give it a try :)

This place is located in the residential areas of HB Block, Sector III,  Saltlake, probably 2 minutes walk from Kulraj Broadway towards GD Island. This is an authentic South Indian food joint.
The most positive point of this joint is that they have a wide range of items quite unlike from the rest of  the South Indian food joints in Kolkata. I had their Sada Dhosa, Masala Dhosa and  Onion Tomato Uttapam and this place is quite close to my Institute. I must admit one thing that the Sambar prepared by them is too good. My friend who tries to avoid sour taste always, liked their Sambar a lot and yes, their rich and thick coconut chatney was also good with a good aroma. I did not like their Onion Chatney as It does not suit me, I guess. I want to try out their rice items on my subsequent visits. 
It is a non AC food joint with an average seating arrangement. They use banana leaf plates to serve foods which is quite compatible with the South Indian ambiance.  They do not have the typical restaurant ambiance, it is a canteen sort of place. I think that their price is on the higher side.  

I just prefer to give them 3.5 not because of their ambiance or a bit high price but just for  serving a good South Indian food.
