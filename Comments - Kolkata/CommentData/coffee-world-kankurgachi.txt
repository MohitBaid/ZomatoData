This outlet is located on the 3rd floor of Mani Square Mall. Tried the Chicken Breast with Mashed Potato and Veggies along with a Caffè Frape. It was quite good as far as the taste is concerned! It was a fine experience.

Excellent grilled fish, very well made good fish. Freshly grilled. Lots of veggies green red and yellow. Corn buttered rice was very well done. Very impressive dish. Great job

I like coffee world at most of their outlets. Good food and beverage and fast service. This one, located at food court of Mani Square mall is nothing out of the same order. Food is good, we tried the waffle and sandwiches- former was not too crisp but latter one was quite good. The service could be a little prompt- they do take a little while long. However, I like it enough to go back for a second round.

Awful coffee shop. Firstly, most items in the menu were unavailable. We finally ended up ordering a hazelnut hot chocolate and an Irish coffee. In simple words the hot chocolate was home equivalent to Bournvita or beverages of such kind and the Irish coffee was plain cold coffee. Period. Further the dilution of milk in the beverages almost tended to infinity. Please don't waste your money if its hard earned.

Stress buster has it's another name for me and that's Coffee world.
Cookie crunch is my favourite. 
Milk finely blended with oreo and coffee results into a soothing drink for the chocoholics!
It comes at a reasonable price in a mason jar. Love it!!
