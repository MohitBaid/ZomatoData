Once a popular bakery in New Market this joint has gone down in popularity chart . With new bakeries springing up every other day in Kolkata the competition is now intense but they are lagging behind as they have not been able to upgrade their products . Yesterday had visited this joint for Rose Cookies . The cookies were of good quality & very fresh but other pastries or patties did not look very encouraging . They need much improvement to attract new generation customers .

This is a nice little shop located inside New Market, just a few steps away from Nahoum's. I tried several items from here and was luckily able to be there when there was not too much of a crowd. The only thing that disappointed me tremendously was the brownie. It was dry and kind of stale and, at least personally, just not sweet enough. The veg and chicken patties were good; the first one lacked a bit in texture, admittedly. The Black Forest Cake was delicious, although, to be fair, I have had better. What really got me, however, was the Butter Fruit Cake that we took home and have been consuming over the last thirty hours or so. It's soft, the fruits combine to form a delectable mixture and it smells beautiful. Definitely a place I would recommend and would visit again in the future, but, to be fair, you do not stay away from Nahoum's if you are that close to it. Still, it's worth a shot, for the pocket-friendly nature of the establishment, if not anything else.

Located at Hogg market gate no. 15. They sell all kinds of bakery items from cakes, bread and pizzas. But my favourite is their masala bread and garlic bread. Only 30 rupees for a freshly prepared bread loaf is definitely worth trying once.

This is a shop inside New Market, near the back gate opening out into the road that leads to the iconic roll and biryani joint, Nizam's and the Kolkata Corporation Headquarters.Its a very old shop and at one time it was renowned for its pastries , cakes and patties
 Alas with the passage of time this place is well past its glory. The standard has deteriorated and many times you get served stale food. I've had from here many times earlier so I have a point of comparison
 The parties are just about ok .But not so the pastries. The fruit cakes were also ok. But price wise it's quite low down.... Cheap.But quality needs to improve.

Imperial Bakery is one of the big cake shops in hogg market. They have pastries and savouries here. All being average. I have tried their sweet buns, chicken pizza and chicken patties. As compared to the price they are okay. The buns can be filling for a quick snack. The chicken pizza was something i liked at this place. The patties however wasn't good. For this place too I wouldn't recommend you to go for the pastries.

Wasn't that much impressed with the quality of the products, the brownie was no doubt very good, but the fruit cake wasn't good, the cream roll wasn't that good either. The chicken pizza didn't taste good at all. The service was good though, needs improvement on the quality.

Occasionally I eat bakery and pastry items and I have tried little stuff of Imperial Bakers and Confectionary while doing my shopping at New Market. I have tried few items like veg sandwich and muffins with coffee which was not at all good in taste. The preparation and the quality of the stuff were not commanding. I have also noticed some dryness in the sandwich which raises the doubt of its freshness. As it was a sandwich, you can easily predict by seeing its vegetables like tomato, onion and capsicum that it was cut much earlier and hence lost its freshness. I asked for the ketchup and it was not good in quality in terms of taste and look as well because its appearance indicates that colour has been mixed in this ketch up. Muffins were also not seemed to be fresh because it was not too puffy which a general fresh bakery and pastry items are. After eating also, I did not have the satisfaction. But I can evaluate the reason for being such a dire condition of this restaurant. First thing is that New Market is one of the prime location of Kolkata for shopping hang outs, so people prefer to have chat and other street food items and not the bakery stuffs. Another most important reason is the availability of Kathleen and Monginis pastry shop at every street of Kolkata which is famous for its freshness and taste, so people will not like to visit this restaurant unless they decide to try a different taste. Therefore, sale does not seem to be regular and hence sustaining quality becomes a competitive issue. It is a small stall with few tables to seat and rest have to manage their stuff by standing around. The staffs are few in numbers to serve your stuff but that does not matter when you do not like the taste. I will not recommend to visit this bakery stall as there are other better food options in this part of the city.

Fighting with more famous bakeries in the neighbourhood, IMPERIAL has a difficult task at hand. They offer all usual things but the varieties are more old world compared to the modern bakeries. Quality is just okayish...commensurate with the pricing...

Located at Hogg Market, this may be considered as a decent alternative to Nahoum's. Although, their standard is not that high, they make standard products when it comes to confectionery items atleast. Had tried their fruit cake once during Christmas. A bit on the dry side, but tasted good.

Imperial bakers & confectioner's is located right inside new market so as you step inside you will get to see the bakery holding its existence for over some glorious years responsible for the speciality of making cakes , chocolates and other eating stuffs which are very popular among the localities of Kolkata . The place isnt very huge but comfortably ok as you enter inside .And as when Christmas comes you will find this place loaded with all different types of fruit cakes and cream cakes available which sells out very fast however throughout the year they have varieties of stuffs to try out apart from the big celebration days .
The rates of cakes are pretty reasonable compared to other Bakeries and so is their making style and ingredients which is dominated mostly with sweetness over great taste at times. For me personally I find this place a no competition in the current market scene of some great bakeries but yes their presence in the city makes you revive the old fond memories and has a strong connect to the feel of you entering New market and trying out cakes for the sake of revival of old Kolkata eating points .

The last thing I tried here was an Easter egg today ( 27-3-2016 ) and the pricing was pretty ok and so was the size decent but the taste of mazipan was flavourless as for the colour showed in the outer shell portion. As only sugary taste was very high killing all the flavour making it a Big No for me however there were candies inside when I opened the shell which was of good quality so somewhere I got saved in between my first trial of having a Easter egg from here .

I am going to gamble my money someday again maybe to try out some other cakes from here even though I got a bit of dissapointment but that's what i love to do with every trial I can give you my piece of mind till I can justify the place in proper .

Imperial is one of the most oldest bakery shop in Kolkata. It is located inside the Hogg Market. During Christmas you will not be able to stand as it is full packed. They have variety of cakes but according to me the best one is the fruit cake with loads of dry fruits inside. It is a must go place for all KOLKATANS....

This is a small bakery inside Hogg market which often gets concealed by its illustrious neighbour, Nahoum’s. Despite the immense competition, this place did not fail to make a mark of its own through the fresh pizzas that it sells like hot cakes every day. One late evening, after a lot of shopping, we were just on time to get hold of the last few slices of the Chicken Pizza and Olive and Parsley Pizza. The chicken pizza was laden with cheese and chicken cubes. It was nothing exquisite, but highly comforting. The olive parsley pizza had a much refined flavor with the distinctive taste of black olives bursting out of an ample amount of cheese and parsley. The pizza crusts were of normal thickness. There’s nothing to complain about, when you get these for just 35 rupees!
Made a second visit to this place which sadly made me lower my rating for it. We tried out the Chicken parsley olive pizza which was really very good, but the nut corner and black forest cake was so not up to the mark. The nut corner stank of rotten cashew nuts and the sponge cake for the pastry was pretty hard. It'd be better to stick to pizzas only.

This confectioner is located inside new market, offering various types of pastries, cakes, tarts, patties, pizzas, fudge, brownies etc. It was a second complete confectioner inside new market after "Nahoum's". Hence it was expected to directly compete with it, though it couldn't. This joint offers variety of savories revolving from sweet to salty with legitimate quality and taste. It has got a modest and average decor. After trying out foods from this place and according to my experience it would be unfair if i say it was not "tasty" but people like me who is habituated feasting in place Nahoum which has set up a very high standard of expectation which this joint couldn't fulfill. Though this confectioner provides versatility but still it is somehow overshadowed by the legacy of Nahoum.
