They serves really well and the quantity of the food is also good but it won't match your expectations. I prefer going there at evening only than you can enjoy the outside view.

This restaurant is easy to locate. It is located on bypass. Ambience and food both are good.

We had :

*MUTTON SPECIAL BIRYANI (3.5/5) :this item was little cold. Do check the biryani before eating if it is cold or warm, so that you can change it Atleast.
*MUTTON BIRYANI(3.5/5) : this item was also little cold. And the potato was not cooked properly. We told the management to change the potato, which they did but the second one was also not cooked properly.
*CHICKEN MALAI KEBAB(4/5)
*CHICKEN BHARTA(2/5)
*MUTTON STEW(4/5)
*MUTTON CHAAP (2.5/5)
*BUTTER NAAN(4/5)
*PLAIN NAAN(4/5)
*PLAIN GARLIC NAAN(4/5)
*TANDOORI ROTI(3/5)
*FIRNI(3.5/5)
*COLD DRINK

I had always been curious about this place.I used to think that they served the Shimla version of the mighty pan-Indian biryani. What used to intrigue me further was the fact that Shimla's take on the biryani is not widely known, like say the Awadhi, Hyderabadi or even the Malabar biryani. This curiosity was soon doused by people who informed me that Shimla Biryani, in fact, serves our very own Calcutta version. A couple of days back, we were looking for a place to eat biryani. It was quite late and we ended up here.

FOOD- We ordered Chicken and Mutton Biryani, Mutton Pasinda, Chicken Tikka Masala, Butter Naan and Firni.
The biryani was good.Just good.Not great. The rice was of good quality, the pieces of chicken and meat were tender and quantity was sufficient. My potato was nicely cooked though one of us got a slightly undercooked potato with a raw centre. But the flavours and the aromas left me slightly underwhelmed.
The Mutton Pasinda was a great dish. The delicious gravy let the mutton do the talking.It was subtle yet impactful. 
The chicken tikka masala was loved by the majority of my companions. I found it too spicy. The gravy of the tikka masala should ideally heighten the flavours of the chicken that is marinated with yoghurt and other spices and baked using skewers. Here, the gravy just overpowered the chicken tikka. You felt that you were having chicken with spicy (albeit tasty) gravy which is a shame because the pieces of chicken were delightfully soft and could have been better utilized.
The Butter Naan was average and small.
The firni was creamy and pleasant.

SERVICE- The people were courteous and efficient. 

AMBIENCE- We sat on the first floor which is air-conditioned. The sofas and chairs were comfortable. I didn't like the table mats which were drab. Its a large and well lit space with a view of the bypass.

Overall, Shimla Biryani is like like Everton. It won't win many trophies but does enough to keep it's patrons  satisfied.It isn't very expensive and is conveniently located.Adios.

Shimla biryani is located near the ruby hospital area. If you want to tickle your taste buds with the taste of biryani while at the same time don't want it to be too heavy then this is the perfect place for you. The mutton in my biryani was cooked well. The kababs and the chicken I ordered were also good. Overall it is a nice experience

Food quality is really good. But i ordered today from the restaurant a mutton biriyani special which was supposed to have 2 mutton pieces, they delivered me 2 aloos and 1 mutton. The zomato help team tried reaching the restaurant a multiple number of times but nobody recieved. Finally zomato reverted the difference in money through zomato credit which was not their mistake but the restaurants. Highly disappointed.

This is an elegantly decorated place to go with family and friends. The ambience is good with well behaved staff. Tried with Chicken Hot and Sour soup, Chicken Hariyali Kabab and Salt & Pepper Fish for the starters and they were extremely good. The quality of Biriyani is super. To add on, tried some relishing dishes- Murgh Kasturi and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala and these were not at all disappointing. Finally the tutty-fruity was a great additive for sweet tooth. The package altogether was amazing and pocket friendly. Thank you team for giving such wonderful food and service.

This place was taken very lightly by many people but now with the introduction of some new dishes Shimla Biryani is back with a bang. Not only they serve those typical mughlai dishes but also they manages to put a twist to the new dishes.
The first floor is magnificently decorated, you will be starstruck to see it from inside.
The white interior makes you feel like a fine dining restaurant. Team Panchphoron went to taste some their new signature dishes alongwith their biriyanis offcourse, which goes like this-
‚Ä¢Cilantro Cheesy Chicken
‚Ä¢Malaysian Chicken Satay
‚Ä¢Spanish Drumstick Polo
‚Ä¢Kothu Kohzi Chicken
‚Ä¢Ghumnewala Chicken
‚Ä¢Ginger Friendie Chicken
‚Ä¢Media Special Veg
‚Ä¢Meen Moilee
‚Ä¢Rajasthani Laal Mans
‚Ä¢Biriyani (chicken/mutton)
‚Ä¢Vestal Mandarain Mojito
‚Ä¢Virgin Mojito
‚Ä¢Mango Shake
Full marks given to spanish drumsticks, malaysian satay and offcourse the biriyani. Others were also not lagging so much back. You will get other varieties of veg & non-veg item too. Even the smoothies surprisingly tasted well.
With so many new places coming up with north indian cuisine as well as there are some legendary outlets already existing, this places will surely hold its glory with their new innovative menu. Do visit it in order to be judgemental & also to enjoy some mouthwatering delicacies.
P.S.: Pocket pinch is on the average side.

Went here for a lunch with my family last Thursday! And have to say that the ambiance and food are quite good. But I am giving a 3 on 5 because of the over smart and annoying waiters and servers! Highly annoying, they force you to order dishes and then, you give them negative feedbacks, they would constantly answer¬†back saying that their restaurant serves the best food! They would also say things like, "I have worked with xyz restaurant before and this dish was served like that and not like this over there!". I was like wth during the entire time! Disappointing!

Shimla BIriyani is one of the oldest restaurants on em bypass.
The name Biriyani itself is an emotional attachment to us. But don't blindly go only with the name.

They also serve an awesome range of food spread, delicious Kebabs, Veg Starters, Authentic cuisines of several states of India, mocktails, some unique own house inventions and the most important biriyani.

Their biriyani was light, less oily but yet to beautifully prepared with soft mutton and aloo.

In this winter they came up with some brilliant new delicacies like:
¬†
Cilantro cheesy chicken
Ghumnewala chicken
Ginger friendie Chicken
Kothu Kohzi Chicken
Malaysian Chicken Satay
Media special Veg
Meen moilee
Rajasthani Laal Maas
Spanish Drumsticks Pollo
Vestal Mandarin mojito
Virgin mojito
Mango Shake

Location: 610, V.I.P. Nagar, Ruby Hospital Area, Kolkata
Price Range: Mid-Low [pocket-friendly]
Must-Have: Spanish Drumsticks Pollo, Ghumnewala chicken, Mutton Biriyani, Reshmi Malai Kebab

An elegantly decked up place which will not disappoint. 

The ambience, service and the food is nice. The restaurant had opened a few years back and I always thought of visiting the joint but never managed to. On one fine November eve I decided to pay a visit to Shimla.

Things that I tried -

1. Chicken Biryani: Different, light and one of a kind. Enjoyed it.

2. Garlic Naan: Tender and nicely made.

3. Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala: Garnished with cashew nuts this dish was tasty. The chicken was soft.

4. Mutton Keema: This dish was delicious. A fine balance of flavour, aroma and spices.

5. Firni: The firni was OK.

PS: Advise to the management of Shimla Biryani. Since you started your franchise with the name SHIMLA BIRYANI I would suggest you to stick to that name. Shimla Biryani and Shimla Restaurant written on the same building doesn't look consistent. A brand depends on consistency. 

The sign, reading Shimla Biryani, on the ground floor has got hidden behind the trees. Would advise the management to trim the trees so that your sign is visible to the cars passing by.

Located in the vicinity of Ruby, this place is known for its Biryani, and doesn't serve alcohol

Started with their recommended Mix Roti Pe Boti Kebab Platter. There were 3 types of Kebabs (Hariyali, Reshmi and Tikka) served atop miniature Butter Roti.
The Kebabs tasted good but the Reshmi Kebab was a bit dry.

The Main Course included Chicken Biryani which tasted passable. The Biryani wasn't very oily and Chicken was properly cooked.

The waiters recommended Chicken Lazawab as the side dish but this tasted very bland and flavourless.

Service is good & pocket pinch is medium.

Food - 3.5/5
Ambience - 3/5
Service - 4/5

This is one of the best places in kolkata to have biriyani. Located near Ruby hospital it's a multi cuisine restaurant.
Coming to the food both the chicken and mutton varieties of biriyani tasted splendid. The chicken kassa was a delight. The quality and quantity of food served is pretty decent.
I suggest all biriyani lovers to visit this place.

So thumbs up for their cooperation...Coming to the food part...we ordered Kashmiri pulao...chicken do paiza... chicken biriyanis ...mutton biryani.....firni....the chicken do paisa and kashmiri pulao was good.... But the chicken biriyani could have been a bit better.... The quantity was more than enough...... So guys u can give this restaurant a try üòé

B I R Y A N I‚Ä¶. The name will attract you..  For Kolkatans, it‚Äôs love..!! Not only biryani but I found some items very reasonable and tasty too.. Worth it..!!

Location- Located near Ruby Hospital Area at Vip Nagar. (E.M Bypass). The restaurant has two floors‚Ä¶ Ground floor opened fron day to eve whereas 1st floor is only opened from Evening till Night.

Ambience ‚Äì It‚Äôs decent enough. Simple but good. Upper floor is spacious enough and I must say good choice in the matter of table and chairs. It can give you royal flavor.

Food -  The most important part. Some items are really good but need to work on their food decorations part. I must say food is good even the quantity too. This is why I say it‚Äôs worthy.

In the matter of taste, I will say good job but can be improved. The best one that I loved was Murg Nazartali, Malai Kebab and Special Shimla Mutton Handi. Biryani is good though but it needs little extra touch. I will rate this biryani 4/5, after concerning the taste plus quantity along with the price. Other thyan that the above three items are really awesome. Murg nazartali is a must try where mashed boneless chicken being moulded with cooked chicken inside as filings. You will get different flavours of this chicken while munching. Nice one.

Other items that we tried was :-

Breads :- 

* Masala Kulcha

¬†* Laccha Paratha

* Butter Naan 

Starters and Main Course:-

* Murg Lasuni Kebab

* Special Shimla Fish

* Chicken Malai Kebab

* Veg Tawa Tamanshi

* Paneer Latika

Drinks:-

* Mango Shake 

* Tutty Fruity

One of the worst service that I had experienced in my entire life. Visited there with my relatives & after they had kept us waiting for atleast 30mins they told us that it would take another 20 mins to get our order done. Then we told them to cancel that particular order & will give them a fresh order. Before taking our fresh order to my astonishment they told me it will take 20 mins to get it served. After waiting for 45mins with lot of embarrassment in front of my relatives I had to leave the restaurant.  I don't know what kind of service is this but will never recommend this restaurant to anyone. 1 of the worst service.

Visited shimla biriyani today. Ordered chickn drumstik, chickn tandoori, chkn hariyali kabab and Mutton biriyani.
Service is not up to the mark, regarding food drumstik and tandoori was good but chkn hariyali kabab was not cooked well and there is no flavour of any green spices. Mutton of biriyani was hard to tear and no taste at all. Quality of biriyani is not at all upto the mark.

Biriyani to a calcuttan is that overwhelming amount of aromatic rice grains with that perfectly flavoured chicken/mutton and ofcourse the egg and potato is a must and "Shimla Biryani"  knows the right ingredients to add to the characteristic features of biriyani to win the heart of the food lovers of kolkata.

Situated near Ruby Hospital,Shimla Restaurant is the perfect place to hop in when it comes to accessibility as it lies just beside E.M.Bypass and the accomodation capability is good enough to cut the chaos and make their seats available all the time for the hubgry ones.

|| Food ||

Shimla Biryani is not only about BIRIYANI but much more than that and thus we were invited by Mr. Arav to get over this funny misconception.

‚Ä¢ Murgh Nazartali (5/5) : Grinded chicken fries moulded with chicken kebab.This dish is the perfect definition of craft cooking.Looks beautiful and tastes rich and buttery.

‚Ä¢ Lasuni Kebab (4/5) : Flavours of raw garlic fused with the perfectly marinated chicken giving it a vibrant taste.

‚Ä¢ Malai Kebab (4.5/5) : Succulent & buttery,the moment you take that first bite,the juices oozing onto your tastebuds will surely rejuvenate your senses.

‚Ä¢ Paneer Latika (3.5/5) : Finely chopped veggies fried to give it a brownish tinge and the whole material moulded with a "gigantic paneer".Tastes flat yet it's simplicity is the striking feature many might love to indulge into.

‚Ä¢ Veg Tawa Tamansi (3.5/5) : An all vegetable sizzler which surely is a delight for all the veg as well as non-veg lovers as the characteristic feature of this dish is the blend of flavours of various vegetables which mixes up together to create a fusion,which tastes new.

#ShimlaSpecials

‚Ä¢ Shimla Special Fish (3.5/5) : Deep fried fish tandoori(coated with rich spices) gives it a brittle outer layering and a contrasting fibrous inner flesh.
Tastes tangy.

‚Ä¢  Shimla Special Mutton Handi (4.5/5) : This one is the perfect companion for your Naan,Tawa roti or Lachha as the thick gravy which this dish has to offer tastes delectable.
A shoutout to the chef for the effective garnishing which adds to the look and feel of the dish.
The mutton tastes buttery and adds vibrance to the gastronomical ven of Shimla Biryani journey.

#TheBiryani

‚Ä¢ Shimla Special Chicken Biryani(4.5/5) : Potato(Softer than cotton),Egg,Aromatic Rice(king sized grains) and "TWO" chicken pieces(perfectly cooked,beautifully presented)
Shimla Biryani has all the characteristics a calcuttan craves for and the qualities he/she searches for in a biriyani.
Not too spicy nor too dull,tastes soothing and wins your. <3

|| Drinks ||

The companionship of Mango Shake & Tooty fruity to this food journey of Shimla Biryani was comforting enough as the richness of flavours of the food was being rehabilitated by the freshness of the juices and thus giving a cooling sensation.

Thus to wrap up the whole context in brief,Shimla Biryani to me,knows how to satisfy the biriyani loving tummy of every calcuttan and thus adds to the city,again,another Biriyani joint(with the other amazing dishes) in your "To EAT list".

A must visit :)

'Shimla Biriyani' located in VIP Nagar near Ruby More is a perfect place to be for people looking for mouthwatering Mughlai dishes. People searching for good food, good ambience and economical pricing then Shimla Biriyani is the place for you.

Mr.Aarav Kumar Shaw invited our group Munching Monks (a group of eight) for the pre launch of pujo special menu.

‚óèMurg Nazartali (4.5/5)- It is a mughlai dish prepared with two layers of chicken. The outer layer is a thick layer of chicken and the inner layer is filled with chicken keema. 
‚óèPaneer Latika (4/5)- As the name suggests it is a paneer item and it is prepared with two layers of paneer. The inner layer is filled with paneer crust.
‚óèLasani Kebab (4/5)- It is a chicken kebab dish with soft chicken legs wrapped in foil papeers.
‚óèVeg Tawa Tamanshi (4/5)- This dish will be loved by people looking for veg dishes. Vegetables are finely cooked and prepared like sizzler ejecting smoke from it.
‚óèSpecial Shimla Fish (4.5/5)- This is basically tandoor fish wrapped with  a outer layering. People looking for fish items can give it a try.
‚óèMalai Kebab (5/5)- The chicken is marinated in malai and then prepared like a kebab. It is highly recommended.
‚óèSpecial Shimla Mutton Handi (5/5)- A mutton dish well prepared with different spices. Mutton lovers give it a try.
‚óèShimla Chicken Biriyani (4/5)- Biriyani is no more a food for people. It is an emotion. For biriyani you can never have enough of it.

I just can't resist myself when it comes to Briyani . So i go on exploring resturants serving briyani in kolkata . And now its Shimla Briyani , near Ruby Hospital , on EM Bypass . It's just by the side of the road so its won't be difficult for you to locate it . They have 2 branches at present in the city . I have seen this resturant before many times while traveling but finally last week i got a chance to turn up .¬†
The resturant is very well decorated and the ambience is good as well , and now i come to food . The food we tasted was too good than i expected really , and i will specially mention their kebabs and side dishes . The briyani was good as well not very oily .

Very unsuspecting ambience but the interior quite well done. Power is an issue, something that I reported to the management.

Food quality is seasoned. I went for a lunch and also had an opportunity to taste some exclusive dishes they are going to launch post puja.

I am all for Hyderabadi Biriyani and so will not discuss the biriyani I had there (although this could be their representational menu if one goes by the name of the restaurant). Having said this, the chef, a young man, may not be perfect in plating, but he has got some craft and wow that malai drumstick that can drum up anyone's dead appetite.

Very reasonable, good food, a great joint for a budget gathering. If I cross Ruby again and it is close to a meal time, I am sure to drop in just for tasting any or all of it.

Sundaes, not now. They have to focus on that part.

4 for only and only tasty, stomach filling, expert cooking.

It was my birthday and my and my wife decided to try something new and we opted for Shimla Biriyani.

Being a biryani lover this restaurant was on my wishlist and they dint dissappoint us.
We ordered Tandoori chicken , Mutton biriyani and chicken chanp.
Tandoori chicken was well cooked and juicy and a perfect start. Then arrived the biriyani and the chanp. The aroma was very temping and we jumped on it and noticed a hair on one of the biriyani plates. The staffs were very well mannered and they changed it with appology. The biriyani was nice and quantity was perfect. Perfect bengali biriyani flavour.  

Ambience was very nice, clean and well maintained. I would definitely recommend everyone to give it a try.

I am giving a 4 star rating and would be happy to escalate if the below mentioned concern is taken care of!
Located at EM Bypass road off VIP Bazar area this restaurant adorns pure white decor and beautifully crafted sitting arrangement.. The food was quite unique - Must Try Chicken Tangri kebab, chicken reshmi kebab, chicken biryani, keema naan and mutton keema..

The only downcast is the stench outside the restaurant.. One cannot be expected to bear with the rotten smell when they're waiting outside for their turn inside or waiting for their cab to arrive..

Our 1st visit here. We ordered chicken cheese kabab in starter which is really tasty, mutton special biryani is good too, not so rich but flavourful. Fresh lime soda and firni also met expectations. Service was prompt and really impressive. 1 star deducted as shahi tukda was not available, although in menu. I understand gajar halwa can be seasonal but why not shahi tukda available regularly, it doesnt require seasonal ingredients. Very less option in desserts.

This is a multi cuisine restaurant near Ruby hospital. I opted for home delivery from there.
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I've tried Chicken Kassa, Paneer butter masala, Dal Makhni, Butter Naan, Masala Kulcha, Lachha¬† Paratha. I must admit that I was highly impressed by the food here. It delivered in both the quantity as well as the quality aspect of things.

FINAL VERDICT- I would highly recommend this place to all and can pretty much assure that you would not be left disappointed.

Nice place for casual dining. Food is okay but service is very nice. Very caring staffs. Sometimes food takes time to serve but its okay to wait. Food is worth enough as price is quoted. Chicken tikka butter masala and chicken reshmi butter masala is best dish if you are coming with a group of 3 or more.. Portion serves atleast 3 person.

Located near Ruby More, this restaurant has extended their section to the first floor. The ground floor is more of a casual dining area whereas the first floor is nicely decorated and good for enjoying with family. 

The first time I visited this restaurant was during the pujas. The food was just bland that time. This time I expected better food quality but alas! The starters were not at all up to the mark and was small in quantity. The Mutton Biryani was okay-ish. Comparatively the Chinese dishes (Mixed Fried Rice and Manchurian Chicken) were tastier.

We went there in a huge group from office. But nobody was satisfied. The staffs were reluctant to serve us. They even denied to switch on the other air conditioner. Overall, the second visit to the place was again a bad experience!

Hope they will improve their food quality and service.

Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Considering the budget food is really good. Biriyani was tasty and as we like them to be. Lucknowi stylebof cooking and less oil/ghee and minimum of added essence. Had the food at around 8 PM and was hungry again by 11. Thus it shows it is easily digested. Tengri kabab was yummy. But the blue bayo drink was not worth taking. It contains essence of camphor. A lot of side dishes and kebabs were not available. Dont know why. Ambiance was attractive and the road side seating was good too.

Shimla Biriyani is like roadside dhaba on EM Bypass. The surrounding of the restaurant is amidst rumble due to ongoing construction. The parking area is very dirty.¬†
Mughlai cuisine is recommended. Chicken/Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Mutton Pasinda are few mentions. Taste is good and decent in portion.¬†
Coming to ambiance the ground floor is for stags. While first floor is more decorated and recommended for family crowd. The restaurant management will insist to fill the ground floor and reluctant to let one sit on first floor during off-peak hours.
Service is poor and waiters are reluctant to give required cutlery, unwilling to switch on AC. Lethargic to serve food on plate. Will recommend this restaurant for take-away.

Visited this place on Saturday with family.was quite pleased with the parking facility available and the outward decor.But frankly the interior was not upto the mark.
Though the manager/owner himself came and explained to us the new features of the menu, but he failed the notice that the table offered to us was dirty and remains of the last diner was very much evident.it was only after pointing it out to the nearby server, the table were cleaned and the table mats were reversed but not replaced.
The food was ok though the Reshmi butter masala
 could have done better with less sugar component.The pocket pinch was not much which was an added advantage.

P.s: do try their dal which was best among all the dishes we tried.

Location- on the main road towards Ruby from science city, to Ur left

Decor and ambience- must say they have worked hard to give this place a modern yet classy look to go with the theme of mughlai cuisine restaurants. The white and gold combi works perfectly for them with pleasant and comfortable seats, chairs and sofas and a neatly done glass walls all around

Food and menu- as the name suggests, you have mughlai cuisine. The biryani is good with a nice texture and taste, cheese naan was excellent with the chicken chaap. But the cheese kebab felt to liquid and dint taste good.

Service and staff- a bit delayed with their service although the staff are very nice.

Overall- medium pinch on the pocket bt a good experience if not extraordinary

This restaurant is surely a hidden gem people. If you want good food, good ambiance and economical pricing of food then this is the place to be. The restaurant is located at Vip Bazar area on EM bypass road. It is a roadside restaurant and can be easily spotted. I went there on a Sunday noon with my bunch of friends and had a quite pleasing gastronomical experience.

While stepping inside the restaurant, the guardman welcomed us with a 'salaam'( that's quite a nice gesture I feel). Now we headed onto the 1st floor of the restaurant. Usually their 1st floor part remains closed during noon but we got lucky as we found it opened on that day. Compared to the ground floor their 1st floor is more beautiful and soo eyesoothing. It has a very nice interior decoration. It is a place where you can be with your family or can hop in with your date too.

Now let's come to the main part..that is FOOD!
We have ordered for--
1)Chicken Haryali Kebab( Chicken pieces marinated with spices and herbs and grilled. The taste is kind of a combination of chicken reshmi kebab and pudina chutney. It tasted really good and the kebabs were soft and tender).

2)Chicken Cheese Kebab( I must say if you are a fan of cheese and chicken make sure you try this one while you visit there. Chicken reshmi kebabs mainly with oodles of cheese coating. Ample amount of liquid cheese solidified and used as a coating for the kebabs and it tasted heavenly. The chicken pieces were also succulent and and all in all a 5/5 dish for me).

3)Chicken Special Biryani( Well, brownie points for the 'aloo' and the egg. There were two pieces lf chicken and it was tender and good in taste. The rice also tasted good and the biryani was aromatic and it was light)

4) Cheese Nun( This Nun deserves special mention as it is itself very tasty. It was soft with a burnt cheesey flavour with a tinge of sweetness. It will surely go well with some Chicken/Mutton/Paneer sidedishes).

5) Chicken Hong Kong Fried Rice(Well, it tasted like normal fried rice but with excessive amount of chilli flakes,dried chillies, crushed cashews,raisins, mushrooms, brocolli, scrambled eggs, chicken pieces and God knows whatsoever. Personally, I really did not like it very much as there was no balance of flavour and no balance in quantity of ingredients used.)

6) Chicken Schezwan Gravy( It was good in taste and a bit spicy with gravy and chicken pieces. Chicken pieces were well cooked and good in proportion).

7) Mutton Rogan Josh( Another tasty and amazing mutton in gravy dish. The mutton pieces were meaty and well cooked and the acidity of the dish brings out quite a different taste..well different in a good way obviously. It went well with Laccha Paratha).

8) Blue Bayo( Well it is basically Blue Lagoon,good in taste and a good refreshment mocktail)

9) Masala Colddrinks( Coke and pepsi with jaljeera and other condiments. Good in taste).

All in all had a lovely time out there and definitely recommended for all you foodies. Just go there and have a great gastronomical experience. I feel their North Indian cuisines are delightful and much tastier than their Chinese cuisines. A bit of an improvement is needed on their Chinese section. Some staffs were polite and courteous though they lacked a bit of a professional training. Another staff's behaviour annoyed us. He just switched off the AC and denied doing so. This kind of unprofessional behaviour is really displeasing and it forced me to cut some marks from the rating. Otherwise all good and great and I wouldn't mind visiting here again for sure.

P.S. Don't miss out their Chicken Cheese kebabs. It is oh so yum! -with

A good place to eat out, with reasonable rates and good food. I had tried the biriyani and I wasn't disappointed. Quantity was also sufficient. Will visit again soon.

This restro hunt was planned by one of my friend. The interior was superb. The decoration, interior design, ambience were undoubtedly awesome. 
We ordered fish tandoori kebab,chicken cheese kebab as starters. The two items were outstanding. Specially the chicken cheese kebab dish. 
Then we ordered chicken biriyani,butter nun,laccha paratha,mixed korean fried ryc,chicken lajawab,mutton pasinda. All the items were very much tasty and served beautifully. 
The foods are super tasty and enough in quantity. 
Overall a great place for food lovers..a grand place which provides you a royal service,tasty food.

These guys had been serving good biryani in topsia for a pretty long time. They sell loads of biryani, and you are bound to get fresh and warm biryani any time of the day.

This outlet is new. The location is good and interiors decent, unlike their eating house in topsia khalpar. Other ala carte are also upto the mark but nothing to send a postcard home. If you are anywhere between kalikapur and ultadanga on EM bypass, this might be the second best bet for Biryani.

This place is located in VIP Bazaar on the roadside, so it has got a convenient location. It has two floors. The Ground Floor is simple yet fine. But the First Floor was mesmerizing. üòç What a classy decor ! 

AMBIENCE - We chose to seat on the First Floor. You can have a look at the roadside (which is beautiful again !). The Decor is classy with golden lights put on. The White Chairs are comfortable to sit on and Seating arrangements are huge yet comfortable. It played good music. Since we celebrated a friend's birthday, so it suited our mood and the experience was pleasant. üòä

FOOD - Had Fresh Lime Soda, Chicken Cheese Kebabs, Chicken Tikka Kebabs, Cheese Naan, Chicken Biriyani, Chicken Biriyani (Special), Mutton Biriyani, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala.
*Fresh Lime Soda was nicely done. But quantity to be increased. 
*Chicken Cheese Kebab was good. However the kebabs could have been served a little more hot. The cheese would have tasted even better.
*Chicken Tikka Kebab - Pieces were a bit hard and wasn't that good.
*Cheese Naan was great !! 
*Chicken Biriyani & Mutton Biriyani were really nice. 
*Chicken Tikka Butter Masala was nicely done. Gravy was really well made.
*Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala was good.
So Fresh Lime Soda (quantity wise) and the Kebabs need a little more check. üòä

SERVICE - Service was really quick. The Staffs are courteous and Hospitality is commendable. 

Overall to ignore the hustle bustle of Kolkata, you can gorge on the North Indian Dishes here with a roadside view. Quite valuable for money ! üòä So give this place a try.

I have had takeaway food from Shimla Biryani on a number of occasions but have never had the time to sit at their restaurant and enjoy the food. Today I did have the time and walked in for lunch with my father. We ordered two mutton rezalas, tandoori roti and salad. The place makes exquisite rezala and they serve a lot more of the rezala gravy unlike other biriyani places . The tandoori roti was perfect for complementing the rezala. Following our lunch we packed a mutton rezala and chicken lasooni kebabs for home. I have always had their lasooni kebabs and enjoyed it thoroughly on every occasion . It's one of their kebab specialities, which is a must try. It's unlike kebabs offered at most biriyani outlets.

The prices are moderate for most dishes but steep for a few popular dishes. The ambiance of the restaurant isn't much to talk about . But it's a clean air-conditioned place for a peaceful lunch or dinner . Their waiters aren't very courteous which is why I'm deducting 1 point from the rating. However, the gate security and other staff members are extremely courteous.

Do try the food at this place though. No other place can make a gravy that is not too oily and yet very tasty . This is definitely one of my go to places for kebabs and kebabs cooked in rich gravy. My father tried the chicken rezala and loved it . The tandoori roti here needs improvement because it's a but chewy compared to their tandoori naan which is perfect. The naan is not thick and chewy like that served in most places . It's light , fluffy and crispy in certain places Do give the combo of mutton rezala , chicken reshmi butter masala and chicken reshmi butter masala a try.

A very convenient place and well located on E.M.Bypass. food is also quite good. Service is very poor & the service team looked unprofessional. They have worked on the ambience but could not make it to the desired level.

Wished to try this place for a long time due to it's reputation but frankly I found it a damp squib. We had ordered 3 special mutton biryanis... the taste was ordinary... nothing to go over the top for the exorbitant price of Rs 270.00.. mutton pieces were so hard that it was not chewable and the biryani was just soaked in oil.. we had to throw those away.. not at all upto the mark given the reputation of the place

A sudden plan leads me and my wife to this place ... I must say that what I got was more than what I expected... very nice ambience...the interiors well made... polite staff... special biriyani was very good so was the Nabab chicken ..... both in quality and quantity...... even the firni was proper and .. communication is very nice from this restaurant...a key feature!!

This is the 6th time I ordered food from Shimla Biriyani. As usual the Mutton biriyani was very light.  Mutton Pasinda was juicy, the chicken pieces in Chicken Lajawab was extremely soft  And yes of course all the mentioned foods were perfectly balanced with spices and salt.
Somehow I felt the Chicken Lasooni Kabab could have been cooked with little bit of spices. It was totally spiceless(Compared to the preparations I had from other restaurants).
Absolutely no complains about the quality,  quantity and the price.

Although the new pictures of Shimla Biryani has not yet been uploaded on Zomato but there has been a drastic change on not only the food quality in Shimla Biryani but also the decoration and the entire look of the restaurant. The second floor is unique and well decorated like a luxurious restaurant and the food quality has been immensely improved since the last time I had my food there.

‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt resist mutton biryani. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve loved eating as a child too. Whenever I‚Äôm feeling low, I just pep myself with some good biryani‚Äù ¬†‚Äì Riteish Deshmukh. Shimla Biryani is another popular restaurant now expanding to multiple locations around Kolkata.¬†As the name suggests, it specialists in North Indian¬†cuisine. It¬†is quite popular among biryani lover , location wise this restro easily accessible. What I liked about this restro is its prominent location and prompt service. Staffs are good and attentive. Moreover, it has kept a reasonable pricing.¬†Not a great ambiance, but provides some quality food with Muglai taste. It a mid range eat, specialized for Biryani. This place is very convenient stop for lunch while you are in EM bypass at Kolkata. Just a stop before Ruby crossing it is very popular place for lunch or dinner.

Will score well in food but low in presentation.
We ordered
1.Mutton SPL Biriyani. Rs270 . It had 2 good Mutton‚Äã pieces 1egg and 1 alu. 
1. Mixed Fried rice had good mix of prawn chicken egg
2. Akbari Kabab 6 pieces 
1. Chicken butter tangri masala
Total had come to 1650 . 
Quantity was moderate. Although for a couple we had to parcel some amount of fried rice and chicken curry along with 1 plate Kabab.
Good experience overall. Nothing special though.

Have passed by this outlet everyday n after seeing their 1st floor renovated, wanted to visit. Went on friday evening, ambience wise really nice decor of tables, lights n cutlery. Ordered half tandoori chicken in starter. Food came in quick but disappointed with portion n size of chicken served, expected tandoori pieces for Rs170. Ordered mutton n chicken biriyani n nawabi chicken in main course. Biriyani was palatable, mutton was soft n juicy n chicken ws a bit non-spicy. Nawabi chicken ws a good option n tasted really well, fried boneless chicken with a bit of gravy garnished with cheese n egg. Also ordered a mocktail named Which one is mine(litchi, strawberry, lime soda), drink ws refreshing but lacked the fizzy soda needed with a biriyani. Overall for a quick bite n ambience of overlooking a busy bypass road, a stopover would be nice üòä

Biriyani was good, the chicken pieces were soft and nicely cooked even the potato was well boiled. We ordered tikka butter masala as side dish and it was well spicy and delicious.. Atleast better than sanjha chulha and other other restaurants on that stretch..

We arrived at 11:50.. But they still served us so no complaints regarding service.

Lol... When you order butter naan, you get lachha Paratha and after serving you are told butter naan is actually butter lachha Paratha. .. and haha... You are left in a room to sweat because ACs switched off in the middle. Poor servicing.

Must visit if you plan on getting scammed. Ordered butter naan and got butter lachha paratha. When confronted to the staff, they said this was how it's made in this place. They also retaliated by saying it was a butter lachha-naan which I haven't heard of in any other Indian restaurant in my life. Not recommended for Indian cuisine

The Indian cuisine here is really not up to mark. Their butter naan is butter lacha and when asked they come up with a whole new dish not even in the menu.

It's located near VIP nagar. You can easily locate this restaurant as it is visible from E.M.Bypass. As we entered the restaurant, a security guard opened the gate. He is continuously staring at inside. It's pretty obvious that the other staffs are staying in the AC room and he has to do his duty in this horrible summer by standing outside. The manager doesn't have the courtesy to offer him a chair. Anyway, the staffs are busy seeing television. One of the waiter took our order. But he came after 5 minutes and told us that tandoori or kebabs are not available and many of the mocktails are not available. Finally we ordered drums of heaven, laccha parata, daal makhani, Kashmiri polao, chicken bharta, phirni, gajar ka halwa and black forest coffee shake. The service is very slow. But the food was awesome. The price doesn't pinch your pocket much. Quality and quantity both are  good. But we will never visit this place only because of its poor service.

I stay in VIP Nagar and having it in walking distance I have tried their biryani. the price they charge and the biryani they offer somehow does not justify I feel as the likes of Arsalan and Zeeshan offer better at the same price.

Have been to Shimla Biriyani couple of times now and was very happy with the food. Biriyani, Tandoori chicken, Hariyali Kabab is what one must try here. They serve good food at a reasonable price and is easily accessible with car parking.

Anyone can spot this place while travelling from Science City to Ruby hospital.
Food served at this place is tasty and good.
This is another place in the city for good biriyani.
Must try : Biriyani, Rezala, Tandoori chicken and Cheese kabab.

Went to a birthday party of my friend. Booked a section of the restora. The food was really really tasty. Staff behavior was good. Ambience quite good too. Prices a bit on the higher side. Though one thing is that the seats weren't that good. Anyways Looking forward to visiting again only for the quality of food.

Whenever I rate 3, I don't like it. It's my review after all. Always like it to be the best.But why? The reason being an old restaurant cant change the thing of being not up to the mark. They have proper interior but cold food. Good ambiance but less tasty food. Service was good. Cant help it to rate it 3. Ordered one Mutton Biriyani with mixed Raita.

This place is like a hidden gem in the city. not at all very small, in the ground section there are two section one is normal another one is quite very good,decorated beautifully with comfortable sofas. the first floor section is really really beautiful,i was quite impressed the way they decorated the place,comfortable sofas and decorated wooden chairs. one of the best place which you can book for any kind of parties.in the ground section they can accommodate around 45-50 people at a time. in the first floor section around 90-95 people can seat and eat together.the ambiance of this place just great,as well as decorated with lovely lights which are hanging from the ceiling, interiors are quite classy and well maintained. i was really impressed the way they decorated the whole restaurant,simply just beautiful.located 610, V.I.P Nagar near Ruby area. this place is famous for North Indian dishes, specially here you will found one of the best biryanis,various types of kebabs and side dishes. apart from that they servers really good Chinese dishes. i was went there couple of days back with my fellow foodie friends over a food tasting session which is all about delicious biryanis and kebabs. they served us various types of drinks in mocktails along with lip-smacking food.

I was passing from dis place today evening wen I thought to take home a packet of mutton biriyani.....I am a biriyani lover since my childhood n I couldn't resist myself while passing a Biriyani house like dis wid an empty stomach.....a parcel of mutton biriyani cost Rs 175 which I think is a decent rate in a quality restaurant.....after having it my opinion is d biriyani tastes ok kind of but d bad part is it's too much oily n even I have to waste a portion of rice at d end because of d oil....

This restaurant is well worth the money. Ambience is good. A place where you can both take your family or go with friends. The quality of the food is excellent, though the service is a bit slow and the seating arrangement gets restricted due to the humongous sofa arrangement making it a fixed seating plan for a specific number of people. Only complaint is that the way the flour dough is kept outside with flies buzzing everywhere is a let down. Otherwise its a must visit

A day in SHIMLA BIRYANI gave me mixed flavors. 

FOOD: We ordered CHICKEN TIKKA KABAB, FISH SHIMLA KABAB and FRESH LIME SODA (SWEET & SOUR) & also FIRNI.All the items were good, Firni was awesome.

AMBIANCE: Nice. Saturday evening was less crowded. But the loud music in the background was pretty annoying and disturbing. A little bit attention should have been paid while playing the music.

STAFF: They were well behaved but little carelessness was observed. We ordered three items but they missed to note one item and we had to wait quite a long time after re-ordering. Besides though it was less crowded, they were not attending us properly. We had to call them each time even for getting the  bill. ÔÅå

This place is Value-for-money place. It has got sufficient parking space and is bang on the EM Bypass Road.¬†
This is a place that delivers quick service, decent portion sizes and is inexpensive. The firni and gajar ka halwa is good for dessert. The chicken and mutton biryani is good to taste and even the vegetarian guys were liking their food as well.

I am a huge biryani lover...and had been eyeing Shimla Biriyani for quite some days.so decided to try Shimla Biriyani with my family and was immediately taken over by the quick service and the pleasant ambience. We had ordered Chicken Tandoori.It was juicy and tender. For main course we had Chicken and Mutton Biryani with Murg da bharta. The biriyani was delicious and light and really went well with the bharta. We ended our course with Firni which wasn't overtly sweet and Gajar-ka-halwa which for me was okeish. Overall it was a good experience. Would recommend if you want a pocket-friendly dine out without compromising on the quality or quantity. The newly added section on the first floor with better sitting arrangements and preety chandeliers adds to the splendour.

So I was going through E.M. Bypass and I was pretty hungry. This place will surely catch your eyes when your passing by it. So I decided to enter and have a plate of my favourite food - biriyani. So I ordered Mutton Biriyani. The ambience is quite good. The food also came quickly. The taste was not bad. But not very good. But you can surely try it if you're hungry.

I wanted to try a new restaurant today when my friend suggested Shimla Biryani. I went there for lunch. Location is very nice . As soon as we entered i was in awe of the interiors . Very well decorated and maintained . We ordered chicken biryani , paneer butter masala and cheese naan . The food was served late due to a booking party going on on the top floor . The waiter genuinely apologized for the delay. When the food was served , i was impressed by the look itself .Fresh and hot. It looked tempting . Tasted even better . We also ordered gajar ka halwa which was again very yummy. I loved the place. And would strongly recommend it to all of you.

Visited during the pujas with utter starvation. The restaurant is well furnished on the first floor with beautiful chandeliers all over the place. We had the mutton biryani. The rice was good but the mutton was neither a good piece of meat nor was it well cooked. The serving of food was not good either. We had to ask for the waiters several times to provide us with spoons and forks. So allover it was not a very good experience for me at the restaurant.

3 star for its food and 0 star for its service. Now a days we have no cash,we are using only Card in restaurants. Before order we talk about card payment,that time they told no problem. But when we went to pay the bill there is so much issues and conversation about card payment. Card payment method is their responsibility, not ours. Another thing is the middle age man who is sitting in the cash counter he just dont know how to behave with a customer. #badexperience #badservice

Feels nice to be back here. It's our comfort food joint not quite far from home. This time we had Navratan pulao, mutton biriyani, paneer palak and mixed raita. Biriyani was yummy as always. The pulao was a surprise package. It refreshed the palate especially since it came only after the oily biriyani (which I'm definitely not complaining about). The service was prompt. 
Will visit again.

Although this seems like restaurant-dhaba hybrid type of place but the food here is amazing. Especially the Biriyani! The decor is average and the ambience is nothing great but the special Mutton biriyani will make up for that. And if you wish to get the complete heavenly feel, order Chicken Kashmiri or Chicken Lajawab on the side and get your foodgasm.
I have already been here about 20 times in the last one year and still can't get over the amazing biriyani taste.

This has been my go to place for Biriyani and Chaap everytime I travel from Airport to home late in the evening. The place is open until 11:30 or that's the latest I've picked up food from here.While the business has come down significantly, ever since Arsalan opened up next door I still prefer this place. PS: The Tandoori Chicken or the Veg. Pulao aren't great. Would recommend to stick to the Biriyani and the Chaap instead.

¬†I have been here for many times for snacks and dinner takeaway. Parking space is nice and accessible. Chicken bharta is good, biryani(chicken) is somewhere between ok and good. Tandoori rotis are nice and soft (this matters if you are taking without butter).
But I must recommend biryani if you are looking for a moderately spicy type. Other varieties in this locality are a bit spicy and delivery timing of this place is good.
For the snacks counter; chicken rolls are sometime very good sometime not so good. Quantity is fine.

I ordered mutton biryani and mutton chaap. The mutton chaap is good but the taste of mutton biryani makes me disappointed. It probably contains vegetable oil and its odour is good but contains more smelling agent.

Found it to be a good restaurant with quality food and average pricing. 
Ordered Tandoori Chicken and Special Chicken Biryani with two pieces of Chicken, good enough for two. Noticed a lot of take aways !
# Good Taste
# Prompt Service
# Ample Parking Space
# Variety of Non Veg Items.

Overall, not a big hole on your pocket for the amount of food you have üòâ.....

Last night we ordered special Mutton Biryani and Chicken Biryani from this restaurant via Swiggy. The price of the items is average and the taste of Biryani is also good. The boti size was normal. The Biryani rice quantity was huge, so some portion of rice wasted. We just miss the Arsalan Ruby park Biryani due to not available at Swiggy at that time may be due to rush hour but the Simla Biryani is not bad. We enjoyed the food and hope we can order in the near future.

In the contemporary time, people have been "brutally" eyewashed with Aminia and Arsalan and other big biriyani joints. However, with due respect to their spirituality and awesomeness in biriyani, Ihave experienced many other biriyani joints in kolkata which are not that hyped yet serve very nice biriyani. Shimla biriyani is definitely going to stay up in that unsung restaurant list. 
We ordered for different items for a lunch treat at our bantala office last week. The price for the items were very pocket friendly. They delivered the items bang on time as promised. The mutton piece in the biriyani was really mind blowing and so was the rice and the flavour of biriyani. No ultra colors, no unnecessary flavours - plain and simple biriyani but doesn't create a gas chamber at your "middle east" that it becomes hard for you to move around. Definitely worth a try !!

Recently went there with friends since we were hungry. Having a biriyani house nearby, we went there to fulfil our hunger. 
The place is located at vip bazaar near ruby hospital. It is easily noticed since it is located by the e m bypass only. 
The ambience is not bad. 
We ordered butter naan, lachcha paratha, chicken biriyani and chicken bharta. 
It took a long time for the food to arrive. The food was not so good. It was average. But good enough to fulfil our hunger for the afternoon.

A new one on VIP bazar bus stop from Shimla Biryani...
As its a better decorated one with more things to offer have obviously increased the rates...
Though i still love the biryani of their old Topsia branch where you can get chicken biryani @ Rs,90 and salad Rs,10...
Been in this new outlet once and that too for a takeaway...
Took mutton biryani,chanp and firni...
Found the rice a bit overcooked and mutton very fibrous and tough...
Chicken chanp was decent compared to biryani and even the firni was good...

Have seen this restaurant umpteen time during passing through EM bypass but never had the opportunity to enter it or order from from it. Now ordered via swiggy app ¬†and really surprised by ¬†the good quality of food at a very pocket friendly rate. Ordered kabuli naan, special fried rice, dry chilli chicken, dhania chicken ,kashmiri aloo dum and to our astonishment all the items were really good, never expected that king od good from from this restaurant. price was very cheap and they dond charge extra VAT or service charge, everything included in the price written in menu card. ¬†Food came within 40 mins so all the things made us very happy. Now im eager to taste other items in near future.

A friend got me a packet of their Chicken Biriyani yesterday, while coming from the Ruby Hospital area. This is a shop which I had noticed innumerable times before, but somehow never had the opportunity to go inside and eat. 

The Biriyani was a good version of the Kolkata Biriyani. The potato was cooked through well, and the rice wasn't sticky.

I took a Chicken Biriyani ¬†as a part of my delivery which later on found out to be ¬†little dry and ¬†not what I expected. Mutton in the chap was soft and tasty though but the gravy was oily .

1 week ago I tried the Chicken Lajawab & Tandoori Roti. I must say one can only find this huge sized tandoori roti that too in just 15/- only at Shimla Biriyani. Chicken lajawab has is own spices and as I feel It was some well friedd chicken pakoras with spicy gravy of tikka butter massala. Over all I had a great experience. For 2 people it would costs 300/- approx. And Here I go again for ordering the same.

Whenever I saw this restaurant from the outside, I have found it often crowded. Hence it was on my wish list. Coming to the biryani? It was average. Nothing special really. 145/- & that too without an egg. Sounds a tad bit high for a mediocre restaurant?? All the hype from my end vanished.

Shimla Biryani.
 Located near EM bypass, Kolkata. One of the oldest North Indian restaurant located in the heart of Kolkata. Ambience is very ordinary ,its a small cosy place to visit and spend time with dear ones. Food quality is decent , service is prompt.The waiters are polite and helpful. Transportation is not easy due to congested road conditions. Price of all the dishes are reasonable. No extra taxes, be it Service Charge or Service Tax. Mutton Biryani , Chicken Bharta ,Chicken tandoori , Chicken Cheese kebabs, shahi tukda, gajar ka halwa are recommended. All in all, a good place to hang around with friends, nice food and easy on the pocket as well.

Went for a takeaway some few days back when I ordered their Mutton biriyani and Chicken Tikka Butter Masala. The Biriyani was very good to my taste and had a sumptious quantity. The potato was well cooked which I look for in all good biriyanis. The Chicken Tikka butter masala was lipsmacking too however was too less in quantity for a full plate. Overall, we had a satisfying meal in an economic range. Would definitely come back to try some more dishes.

The latest kid on the block is Shimla Biriyani, a hard to miss restaurant on the EM Bypass. The signage and facade was quite impressionable and the decor is standard. Coming to the food, it was quite good and includes Mughlai and Chinese items that are well cooked and tasty. We ordered Mutton Biriyani, Masala Kulcha and Chicken Kadai. The biriyani and the chicken item were very good though ¬†I was sorely disappointed with the masala kulcha which though immense in size ¬†had practically no taste and stuffing inside it. I am not very sure about the chinese items though going by the standards of the mughlai food, they might be quite good. All in ¬†all, the restaurant can be tried out multiple times.

This place was not that impressive yet it satisfied our combined appetite. We were starved and was searching for a place to sit and eat when we came across this place. We didn't have the biriyani as the name suggested but had some of the pioneer dishes which you would have in a moghlai place. The chap was not that impressive but the kebab was good. If I were to visit this place again, would definately try their biriyani and will do a full circle with the review

Heard a lot about this joint from my father who for some reason is a fan of their biriyani. The outlet is located right on the main road ( EM Bypass) about 3 mins drive towards Science City after crossing Ruby. Since i was quite eager to try out their delicacies, decided to order their biriyani along with Mutton Pasinda for home delivery. The Biriyani to be honest was very ordinary. The taste was nothing brilliant and it was also slightly on the dry side. The positive part was their portion which was quite generous and also the amount of meat that was served. Even the Mutton Pasinda was disappointing. It had a weird taste dominated by some kind of spice which i was unable to decode.

After passing by this place quite a number of times and hearing good reviews of te place we decided to try this place on a Friday night for dinner. The place has ample parking space and being bang on the em bypass its easy to locate. They have a small sitting area inside which has sofas n is a little cozy if u want to spend some good time over food. As we entered we overheard that this is a better place than the nearby Arsalan outlet which has opened up. We ordered the chicken tangdi butter masala along with kheema nan and garlic nan. And one portion of mutton biriyani with it. Obviously the green salad and raita is an accompaniment. The biriyani was quite good except the fact that the mutton in it was not at all juicy n succulent. It seemed as if the mutton had been kept inside the fridge for 3/4 days and then being served. The roti preparations and tandoor items were quite good. The pricing on the menu is quite competitive. However if someone wants to have biriyanis here then go for the chicken biriyani and not the mutton as the chicken seemed more fresh as compared to the mutton.

biriyani lovers it is your place as the biriyani taste really good which really surprises me because after arsalan and zeeshan no other place can beat them but this actually did.. its tandoori chicken is very soft and tasty. Firni you will always get it and is yumm.. what else to have when you have these three combination together.. Kolkata has its place with a small restaurant but a good taste of food. Go by its name and enjoy the roadside dhaba in any weekend.

Use the coupon SFOODS to get Rs 100 off on your Zomato online order.( Payment needs to be done by card if you use the code).

Did a takeaway from this shop, as I didn't know that they do home delivery for orders above Rs 1500.
The restaurant wasn't crowded inside nor was the takeaway counter. Well behaved staff and hospitality is commendable. The exterior decorations do crave attention. Tax isn't charged on delivery/takeaway.
IF YOU TRY THE TOPSIA'S SHIMLA BIRIYANI, THE QUALITY WILL BE NOT AS GOOD AS THIS OUTLET, BUT CHEAPER DUE TO AREA.

Heads: 6
Orders
7 Chicken Biriyani (7x145)
2 Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala(2x205)
Total expenses: Rs 1425

Biriyani(9/10): It's not too rich nor too dry, just the perfect blend. The rice was well cooked and had a mesmerizing aroma. The potatoes were well cooked and just melted on our tastebuds. The Chicken piece was big and soft, professionalism is present. Quantity was really good. 1 plate was enough for me, still I had 2 pcs of Chicken and 1/4th extra plate of rice. Wonderful experience. This is exactly the Biriyani I want. I might not be able to pay for this from my own pocket money now, but its value for money. It wasn't tasteless.

Chk Reshmi Butter Masala(9/10): 6 pcs big in size and was very delicately cooked. The Chicken was soft and each bite sprouted the appropriate blend of the spices. This was maybe the best Reshmi Butter Masala i've had(even better than SHIRAZ). The gravy would keep you craving for more. Reshmi Butter Masala is rich in all cases, so it will reduce your capability to eat in terms of quantity. A wonderful experience after a long time.

DIFFERENT FOODIES HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES, OPINIONS & CHOICES SO DO READ MULTIPLE REVIEWS FOR A BETTER CONCLUSION.

One may have noticed this outlet of Shimla Biryani while driving through E.M. Bypass. It's a standalone building inside of which the restaurant is located. It's certainly not the best place for a family dinner on a Sunday evening. The restaurant could be a choice if no other options are available or budget is a concern.

I went there with my friend today in the afternoon. It was not my first choice, as we found Pride of Punjab and Sanjha Chulha to be closed, we had to stick with this restaurant. The place was empty but there were a lot of staff around. It was hot as hell as the air-conditioning was probably not working properly.

The food that were ordered were Chicken Biryani, Chicken Haryali Kebab, Chicken Lasooni Kebab, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala and some Raita. Chicken Biryani was not very good, it certainly had a big piece of chicken and a well cooked potato but had a taste of overpowering rosewater, moreover it was very oily. Chicken Haryali Kebab was soft and had a minty taste. Chicken Lasooni kebab were the best of all, it was big and soft pieces. The kebab was well charred and had a mild taste of ginger and black pepper. Chicken Tikka Butter Masala was also below average, the gravy was non spicy and very oily. Raita was good and was helpful to gulp down the oily Biryani. Also some soft drinks were taken after the meal.

Pricing was not a big deal, for two people the bill stood at ‚Çπ980. Quantity was very good, one plate of Biryani was more than enough for a person, I would say that sometimes it is sufficient for two persons with moderate appetite. Service was also good, the waiters did their best job. Took our orders quickly, made sure our glasses were filled and made the billing very swift. Serving time was not good though, Kebabs were served within 10-15 minutes and the Biryani and gravy took them 30 minutes.

Ambiance was mediocre, the place itself is very small and noisy. There were too many staff within a small place. Interior decoration is minimal, tables and chairs are very standard and nothing premium. Cutlery is of cheap quality, plates are so small that Biryani alone takes all of it. Outside of the restaurant is completely littered, it is a garbage dump outside and the land outside is dug up. Parking is not an issue as there is ample of space.

Bottom line, I would not recommend this place. It's nowhere close to authentic North Indian food. There are other good places out there. Plus Arselan is opening nearby, so maybe they need to perform better to be in competition.

This place is located right on em byepass at VIP bazaar, between Ruby crossing and science city. Ample parking space. Boasts of a ground and first floor. So large, clean and pleading dining area. Also has a takeaway counter. Serves mughlai and Chinese. I have scary experiences of trying Chinese in mughlai joints so stuck to basics. Mutton biryani was delicious. Just the right moisture. Not too dry as well. Soft, tasty, sizeable piece of mutton and potato. No eggs though. Kebabs were well marinated and spiced, with large portions and the accompanying sauce was not rancid for a change. However chicken tikka was a bit undercooked. Butter naan was SUPREME. Cooked to perfection. Chicken chap was pretty good too. However if dining with family might opt for the inner enclosure/1st floor. And as usual the waiters don't understand half the instructions and are rude. Most points however are happily checked. Will go back to try their variety the next time. Recommended.

I was there at Shimla Biryani on Panchami 18/10/2015, had Chicken Lasooni kebab - truly worth paying, it was juicy, soft and yummy. Butter Naan - very soft and big in size, Chicken Bhartaa - needs improvement in taste, too greasy, Mutton Biryani - more than sufficient for one person, I felt salt was a bit less but all over was pretty good, Firni - too sweet and smelt high of rose essence, needs improvement.¬†

Wish them all the best... :-)

We went here on our way back from office. We were really hungry and ordered mutton Biriyani and Chicken Tandoori. Both the items were really good. Chicken Tandoori was cooked perfectly and the Biriyani was light and the flavor was really good. Will surely visit again.

This place is near Ruby Hospital area. Though i had ordered food 4m here many times before for parcel, today i visited the place. We had ordered half tandoori chicken and 1 mutton biryani. The tandoori chicken was perfectly cooked and the biryani tasted superb. The price is reasonable and its inclusive of tax. The interior is quite good and the service is good too. Summing up , it was a good experience. I recommend ds to da ones who want to eat wholesome at a moderate price. I will visit this place very soon.

A regular customer and whenever we go there they never disappoint us. 

First off all the ambience. Very clean and refreshing. I love it. 

Food. The best you can get in a budget of five hundred. Every dish make you crave for some more. Its cheap and best. 
P.S - Do order drums of heaven. 

Just go for it. I promise you won't return home empty stomach.

The restaurant has gained fame over the years. Their 2nd outlet. One of the places where you just go to eat.. Mughlai dishes..
The restaurant has the small enclosed sitting area, I try to sit there, whenever i go..

I live in the vicinity and have been wanting to visit this place in quite sometime.... This Saturday turned out to be the day after a long wait! It wasn't crowded, just enough number of people, and we were glad for that. I don't like waiting outside a restaurant to get in. Well, we ordered hariyali kebabs and they were good. We ordered tandoori naan (had never tried it before, so decided to try it). It was really good! With it, we ordered a navratna veg, and wanted to know what exactly it was before ordering. The waiter did say that it was sweet, but we were in for a shock... We had no idea that it would be bathed in milk/cream.... My husband hates anything to do with milk. He just ate a little while I had to eat it up, even though I couldn't bcoz it was so rich! However, it did taste good, and I mark it a 4 because the waiters could be trained to know & explain dishes better to prevent customers from getting a shock. No doubt that it was excellent in taste. I couldn't care less about the ambience, as I believe that you go to a restaurant to eat, not for the ambience :)

i used to order tandoori regularly from this place but today n another day previously they packed half cooked, rather 95% uncooked tandoori chicken and when i called those people up to complaint for the same, first they said "coals that are used for tandoori got over" then they said "we don't serve uncooked tandoori" then they said "manager is out to have lunch"...what kind of attitude is this....a regular customer will not complain on false grounds for freebies. At least they could have said sorry. very disappointed with such behavior. will never go back to this place.

I didnot like the restaurant.. neither the food quality was gud nor the plates and spoon were properly washed! The prices are even pretty high! You can easily find good food in a cheaper prices in many places or atleast the plates would be properly washed!!! Shimla biriyani is not not not good to visit!!!!

Had there been negative rating option available in Zomato, I had given this place a straight (-5). I had ordered a home delivery, where this delivery guy first tried taking the money from me before handing over the parcel. I check to find that everything(gravy, chicken and vegetables) was scattered inside the carry bag. On telling him to take it back and to deliver the menu fresh, he misbehaved, wherein my location is just a few blocks away from the restaurant itself. I called up the restaurant and asked the person who received the call to send me fresh delivery, on which he misbehaved too and hung up the call on my face.

Located in E.M BYEPASS and place is wide. We entered at between 4:30 pm and try to order some Kebabs and they said not available. That's very surprising that a tandoori restaurant doesn't serve Kebabs at evening. Well they forced us to take Chinese food. We ordered Chilli Chicken Dry as a Starter which tastes like Dragon Chicken and looks like Thai chicken. Later we ordered mixed rice and chilli fish. Fish was stinks somehow, I can't eat and rice was cooked earlier. Overall very bad experience.

The service is fast and good. The staff is well mannered and well behaved. The place looks good and clean. but the food is very average. As per its name "shimla BIRYANI" the biryani does not at all have the WOW factor dat its suppposed to have..the biryani had too much potatoes and was oily too. other than the biryani u can order whatever u want.. The price and the parking space are only the USPs here.the quantity of the biryani is also more than enuf..
I wont visit this place again though..

There are lot of famous biryani joints in our city like Arsalan, Shiraz, Aminia.. So called big names.. But this restaurant is actually good for their quality. If I consider only biryani, this is a right place to dine in! Absolutely stunning taste with quality product. They have variety of kebabs also! A must try!!

First of all i dont know why they have named it SHIMLA BIRYANI..... so i was quite inquisitive to try out the BIRIYANI they make.

Well the restaurant is not having a great ambiance at all.. Seating is also not cozy.

Coming to the food.. I tried the mutton biriyani and chicken tangri masala on my first visit.
Mutton biriyani was good to taste..with quite a generous portion of rice..quite a big piece of mutton to top it off.. So i was quite happy with the quality and taste of the biriyani.It was really good.
Chicken tangri masala was also quite well prepared..
So i liked the food they did serve me.May visit another time but for people who dont like the ambiance much can always go for Parcel.
But i wish the ambiance was better .
Still Worth a try !

Can't tell about the ambiance of the restaurant  but one thing that's the taste of the biriyani...
It's just fantastic..
It's a little bit oily but not beyond the limit..
N the firni is also tasty...
Luvd it & will try to visit the restaurant soon.

I had ordered a plate of chicken biryani at this decent restaurant,I must say it was worth every penny spent and in addition to that the service was pretty pleasing and most importantly it was only ‚Çπ140. In comparison to the giants in the business SHIMLA BIRYANI is doing great and the quality of the food is above average.

Yesterday, we went to Shimla Biriyani to have dinner with a friend. There is a big parking lot in front of the restaurant. The waiters are good in behaviour but inattentive. We had to ask for the menu card.
The price is reasonable compared to other Biriyani specialists. We ordered Tandoori Chicken for starter. Mutton Biriyani and Chicken Lajawab as main course.
Coming to the food quality which is to me, the most important aspect of a restaurant. Tandoori Chicken was quite good. Well marinated and cooked. The marination went inside of the Chicken compared to many other restaurants. The Mutton Biriyani is lightweight, not very much of Biriyani smells which I actually like. The piece of Mutton is decent and soft. I am quite disappointed with the Lajawab. The taste is not distinguishable. Even the Chicken pieces have kind of cornflour coatings as they are used for Chilli Chicken. Did not try the desserts as my tummy was full. They do not add any taxes as its already added in the menu. 
Overall experience is quite good. Will be back once again to test other side dishes. Hope this helps all...

Located at E.M bypass after Ruby towards science city. Ambience is ok but the biryani they served was really good. Not to oily yet delicious. My orders included mutton biryani and punjabi mutton. Both the dishes were really good but one thing is that the piece of mutton in the biryani was not that satisfactory. One advantage is that the price in their menu card is the final price as they don't charge extra vat. Overall a good place to just hog food in.

Just for name its Shimla Biryani, they serve Chinese too, went with colleagues yesterday to have lunch, amenities are good but not satisfying, decor is ok types, location is very good you don't have to search for it on EM Bye pass, one person taking order, serving water, cleaning table, others are watching TV,,, Biryani was not satisfying to me, neither the rice had that flavor nor the edible which is been used was good, total no Biryani here again,,, rather try the Korean rice which was good and even if you are not hungry you will feel like to have it..

I noticed the E M Bypass restaurant often due to big signboard and well decorated entrance. The experience was somewhat ordinary. I went to the restaurant around 2:30 pm today. The main hall had a handful of customers and the AC was not working. The place was hot, humid and claustrophobic. The waiter offered me a place but I asked for a place with AC. They took me to a cabin with two tables which were already occupied by two couples. The waiter then ordered me to sit in front of them if I wanted AC.
I decided to cut short my menu to the bare minimum and ordered a mutton biryani and salad. The biryani was not warm. There was hardly any aroma. They did not use pure ghee. The rice used in the biryani cannot be compared to that of the famous Mughlai restaurants of kolkata. The mutton piece was of medium size cut. The quantity of rice was more that the usual plate served in other restaurants. While I tried to eat biryani, the couple sitting opposite to me hurried through their lunch and had to ask twice for the finger bowl. Price and quantity are the two USPs of this place.¬†
I won't visit this place again..

Had seen this restuarant innumerable times while passing by, but the overall rating in zomato didn't encourage me a lot to visit this place ..... but on getting a recommendation from a senior colleague of mine who stays nearby this area ...... finally managed to visit this one last Saturday(23rd May) .......
Its location is quite good and also has a car parking space which is much needed nowadays .....
the ambience inside was so-so i should say ..... but the problem was that the AC was not working up to the mark of satisfaction of the customers .... we were sitting under a fan so somehow managed ,but some other customers were really sweating and complaining as expected ,though the AC was turned on ..!! The waiters though weren't rude in their behaviour ,infact they seemed to have understood the concern of the customers and were quite modest in behaviour ,but were helpless too (i.e couldn't solve the problem).
Coming to food ....we tried tengri kebab¬† in starters ..... was quite good i should say ....then came the biriyani .... frankly speaking,i was not expecting much with regards to food quality , but i was amazed ..... the biriyani was indeed quite tasty ..... we also tried chicken dopiaza ..but didn't find it that good ,wasn't bad but ok ..... 
Pricing is ok considering its location and all ...
I think if the ambience(including AC and all) can be improved a bit, it should deserve a higher rating (or at least better than its current rating of¬† 3.1) ..... i am thinking of visiting again for the biriyani ...maybe try out some other side dishes as well ......

Visited this place while returning from some work and as it was a tedious day without food, my hunger levels were at its max. 
We tried Special mutton Biryani, Chicken Lajabab & Tandoori Roti along with soft drinks. 
The Chicken item tasted good & new, although one can clearly understand that its Chinese fried boneless chicken (Cornflour coated) from the first bite itself. 
The Biryani was good too and the quantity was really sumptuous with proper & well cooked Mutton pieces.
The behavior of the waiter was cordial and service was prompt although it lacked a bit of professionalism. 
The pricing is also moderate as per my views if quantified with the quality of food, service & ambiance. 
All in all I would say that this was a good experience and I would surely go back.

Visited this outlet while coming back from office. We ordered Special mutton biryani, chicken lajawab & tandoori rotis. The biryani was mildly spiced but with sinful aroma. The quantity of rice was sumptuous and the mutton was tender. The boneless chicken lajawab was ok as in Indian gravy items you do not usually find boneless, corn flour coated fried chicken which is used in Chinese dishes.. If u remove the gravy.. U'll feel you are having corn flour coated fried chicken. That is the only thing I didn't find good. Other wise if u want to have biryani.. Its a good place with good location.

It is a budget restaurant. Though the name suggests north indian cuisine one will also find Chinese dishes over there. Out of my order Chicken tikka kebab was good, but chicken reshmi butter masala was not upto the mark and firni was okay. I personally loved the mutton biriyani though it was rich, the actual kolkata biriyani as it used to be previously. If someone is calorie and diet conscious one needs to avoid it. And the best part it is tax free i.e.the menu card is inclusive of all taxes. So if someone is searching for rich authentic kolkata biriyani forgetting about the diet this is the place to be.
P.S :- the order must be carefully made as all the dishes are not that great

Once returning from office picked up their chicken biriyani. It wasn't up to the mark. The Biriyani was greasy and the chicken piece was over cooked. There was more "Kewra water" which was overpowering the natural taste of the biriyani. Disappointed completely even paying standard price if you get average quality biriyani Its embarrassing indeed. They need to improvise their biriyani.
