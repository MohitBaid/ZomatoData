White sauce pasta was good. Sauce tasted delicious. It could have been more creamy though. I would suggest to take the chicken one. Overall out was fine.

Sizzlers were good. I ordered for Paneer Tikka and hakka noodles sizzler. It was hot and sizzling. I think the spices were a little low than expected to be in sizzler. Over all it was good. ‚ò∫

Ordered a chicken steak sizzler here.Though the food was fresh the quantity was extremely less and the smoky feel that you get with a sizzler was not present and the price was too high for the quantity offered.Not recommended.

This is the venue where I had my first sizzler ever. It was such a nice stuff to have. I just love that smoke which comes from the food. Its so great. Even the crispy chilli babycorn which they serve, is of great quantity.

Hygienic and quality sizzler joint of the area. Had mixed sizzler with family here and it was good. Good option for students of the area to hang out for taste change with sizzler.

Tried the Barbeque Chicken Sizzler here. Located at the food court, probably a decent option at economical prices. However, the sizzler I tried was pretty less in quantity. Although, prepared fresh, it wouldn't even fill the appetite of a single person!

This small food counter is one of the kiosk at hang out food court at the city centre 2 Rajarhat. I have tried their sizzlers on many occasions which taste quite decent. Grilled chicken or may be Barbque chicken is one of their hot selling dishes. Food is average nothing extraordinary. Also I would recommend to improve the presentation.

Tried their barbecue chicken sizzler on a post-shopping lunch with my sister.The service was prompt,the food was fresh and quite tasty but the quantity wasn't enough for 2 given the prices.A bed of noodles or stir fried rice would have done the trick.Nevertheless recommended if you find yourself at hangout,city centre 2.

Its located in the food court (hang out)of city centre and the sitting arrangement is kinda scattered as a normal food court,I have had their more than a couple of times but recently they have deteriorated a lot,the grilled chicken smells very bad and the garnishing or the taste is not at all up to the mark,it will make someone hate sizzlers even if they love sizzler...

It was a post movie lunch there..
Unplanned though..
We had ordered chicken sizzler (bbq) & hakka noodles mix..
I must say that the sizzler was too good as the spices r mixed at the exact proportions..
One thing i will mention that the guy was so helpful & has a thorough knowledge for the dishes of his stall as he chose our dishes while we were puzzled..
Good food & hospitality..
Must try..
