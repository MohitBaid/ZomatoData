Just dont go. Its bad in every way. Bad food. Bad ambience. Worst service.
The other chain shops are equally similar.
Low standard people go here.

As the name sounded interesting i decided to check this place out...But it turned out to be a disappointment..

Nothing impressive about the interior to mention in specific...I expected it to be a Punjabi themed decor...Nothing great about the service either...

Now coming to the foods-

Starters -
¬†We ordered chicken reshmi kebab and chicken tandoori in starters were failed to impress...
These were very much bellow the average...

Main courts -¬†
Butter nun,Chicken biriyani,chicken Tikka masala was equally unimpressive...

The experience was horrible...

I will never give the recommendations for this restro....

I had a pretty bad experience! We had to return the pan fried fish because it was smelly. Then we replaced it with prawns and even that was not fresh. The dry chilli chicken was a saviour. Fried rice was average. To sum it up, I am not coming back!

The name of the restaurant carries more flavours than its foods!! Don't visit with much expectations.
Five of us visited this place for our dinner.
We didn't drink. So we chose the family section. Ambiance z not so good. Staffs know a little about the foods on their menu. They care a little once u have placed ur orders!! The management z a total mess!!
Still, this place runs well just becoz of its favourable location.
Now what u can try? Among the 7 to 8 dishes we ordered only a few were palatable!! Have Punjabi chicken, kashmiri Pulao. These items r good. Breads r not bad. Don't dare to try anything other than north Indian food!!
But it ll be better to avoid this location unless unavoidable!! üòÅ

Not at all a good place.
Staffs are really untrained and unprofessional.
Once you are seated they don‚Äôt really care about you.. they‚Äôre more interested in attending new customers.
Food is also not something to go back for.
Only reason this place runs is because of the IT hub nearby.

I have been at this restaurant twice. And my experience says that, the food served by them could be a bit better in quality, with respect to the prices they charge. They have a dim lit ambiance, which might be appealing depending upon your mood and company.

I don't know why people gave it low rating. I guess it is the CHEAPEST bar in this area u can find. SERVICE is also very good. Waiters are always ready to serve you drink everytime u finish your glass. 
Good VARIETY of food u can avail here (Tandoor and Chienese, Both Veg n Non-veg) and they are well in quantity and taste is also good.

One of the worst places to dine. I have been here once quite a while ago. Back then the service was poor. Now, after I visited the place again, I found it became worse than before. The staff behaviour, the food quality, the quantity all are poor. Only the prices are high. Avoid.
PS: When the mall closes so does the AC system. So at night you wont get any air inside this restaurant as they do not have their own AC/fan to reduce running costs. Dont bother complaining, as no one will care. I have seen myself, most of the people cancelled order and left this place because of that. Even on my second visit, we had to do that.

As a home delivery option they are can be chosen if you live near axis mall but if we talk about the food then I have to say that the quality is average. Some of the dishes like chicken Tandorri is good but personally I don‚Äôt like the food quality. And also The service should be more flexible or good.

Decor is not so impressive.Service was bit late.Food taste was so so. I love there variety in chicken dishes.My personal favorite dish here is Kadhai Chicken or Chicken Handi served with Masala Kulcha or Butter naan.It serves Chinese food also,though i never tried.Price is not that much high.

Place was not good to visit on a saturday. The place had a good amout of customers which i can hardly say crowded. Their service was very irittating, need to call them twice or thrice till they respond although there were abundant waiters there, environment was not upto the mark. Food was okay. Since i can't put 0 hence 1. This is the last time that i went there.

On weekend and Holidays we generally order the food ¬†from here in our office , every time we are facing some issue ,some time they forget to bring the bill, one day we have ordered the Gulab Jamun but they don't deliver it but the price was included in the bill.

Had a chance to visit this place last month along with my kins. The ambience is ok though spacious. Food is alright , good quantity. Tried their fish tikka, peas pulao , chicken tikka butter masala, chicken bharta. Food is served in good quantities . The chicken bharta was good to taste but the chicken tikka masala was too spicy. The eatery provides some variety in the dessert section like hot Gulab Jamoon with ice cream , kesar koolfi etc along with the usual ice creams. We tried the Tooti Fruity which had lots of fruits in it. The joint also serves alcohol . Overall the experience was not a bad one and the place can be visited once.

I had visited today afternoon for lunch. To put it straight the experience was awful ! I had ordered yellow dal makhni , chicken kassa and roti . The dal makhni was no better from a roadside normal dal. The chicken in the kassa was stale and was smelling bad. I told the service person about it and he called the manger . First he tried to deny , claiming it was fine. After insisting its stale , he changed the chicken and it was worse than the last one ! Now he started denying it and not paying heed to my complaint anymore and gave me the bill . Finally i paid and left.... Very bad experience....the shedding off the responsibility by the manager was worse than the food. Hope the management looks after it and does some necessary checks and training.

It's located in axis mall. The restaurant n bar lounge are separated,which is good. As the name suggest, Indian food is better than Chinese. I have ordered both and experienced the same. Price is really affordable and staffs are also nice. But they have very few options in desserts and beverages. If u r a dessert lover, then this is not your type of restaurant. Otherwise it's perfect for family/friends lunch/dinner.

Chicken kadai is tasteless and chicken was hard. Kebabs was so so not up to the mark. And the tandoori roti oh man I will never forget that one really sucks. And dishes were served too late I repeate toooo late. Price is so high even the drinks as well.

The taste of prawn pakoda wasn't good either. The only edible dishes were naan and kolhapuri chicken. Service was slow. But I'm grateful that they cancelled one order when we requested before it was served.Loud bollywood music was being played which was a disturbance. Got no mehak in mehak e punjab.

This was my first visit and quiet satisfied with the experience. We ordered chicken lababdar and amritsari kulcha, which was not in the menu but they suggested it. The taste was too good and it's a must try for all.. now coming to the ambiance and hygiene, it was also quite good. The service was fast. So we enjoyed it

At first, the  food quality is shit... They don't even know how to make a Naan .xD ... And secondly , I think they serve frozen food and not freshly cooked ... This isn't the place , u r planning to take your friends or family... In alter, while visiting axis mall .. u can eat out at the food court rather than this shitty place... (There's an absurd rule , that,  if you  don't bring a female in Mehak-E-Punjab .... They'll ask you to sit at the bar , which is pretty uncomfortable for people who don't take alcohol)
(The Quality of food can kill people , it's better to suspend your restaurant.... If you fail to upgrade your standards)

This place has gone from bad to worst in the past couple of years. The food is still okay but the basic hygiene factor has taken a huge backseat. The place reeks of months of being left dirty. The plates spoons have not been replaced in years and the ambience is that of a roadside stall. Maybe it's the owners' version of a Dhaba ;) the behaviour of the waiters is unbelievable.it's like they are doing you a favour by taking your order and getting  you food. They have even lost the jug to pour regular water.instead they use an used mineral water bottle.lol...I'll avoid this place for the rest of my life until the management makes this like it was when they opened. The only reason I have given it 1.5 is because the food is still okay and the tandoori rotis are better than most other  places.

This is a perfect mood spoiler restaurant. If your day is going all according to a plan, this place‚Äã will make a mission to ruin it. Awful staff and equally disgusting food. And if you happen to complain about your terrible experience to the manager, he would calmly reply, "On certain days, certain tables make it a point to complain." So nice of him. His generous thought lending will make you numb for a bit. It would take a while to regain your argumentive perspective. And I warn you, do not even dare to try their crispy chilly baby corn. The dish is a perfect recipe for Donald Trump's proposed brick wall on the Mexican border. Oh, another thing I should add. Always check the bill (that is if you still go and visit the place) before paying. They might add more dishes to your bill even if you hadn't ordered them. Lovers of food, please refrain from going to this restaurant. Thank me later. Ok bye.

As the name sounded interesting, i decided to check this place out. But it turned out to be a disappointment. On the entry itself you somehow get a feeling of the place not being very hygenic.

Nothing impressive about the interior to mention in specific. I expected it to be a Punjabi themed decor. Nothing great about the service either.

Starters - We ordered fish fingers but the fish didn't seem to be fresh. Chicken pakore in starters also failed to impress.

Mains - Chicken Tikka masala and Mutton Kasaa was equally unimpressive. For a punjabi food joint non veg should be good but it was not the case here.

Couldn't dare to order dessert after this experiece. The place is not a recommend from my end.

Good place to hangout with friends. The good thing about this place is they offer draught beer. The service is pretty appreciable. We had 2 pitchers, mixed schezwan rice, crispy chilli babycorn and hot and garlic chicken. Preparation was good. Nice place for people who stay nearby DLF-1. Rates not so costly.........

My visit to Axis mall led me to this place. A small restaurant cum bar. Their starters tasted good and had quite a variety of kebabs. And there are days when your food tastes just oil, its when our main course was served. The butter nun and the mutton were way too oily, so much so that we couldn't finish the food. Not recommended at all.
A good place just to grab a drink i suppose.

The staffs are ill mannered. The food is so so. They take a decade to serve the food. The alcohol we ordered was not available. So we had to take the expensive one because obviously it was too late to walk out. Never visiting again for sure. The biggest disappointment was the staffs. Bunch of ill mannered hooligans.

Forget about the Food, that is important.. but what important most is the hospitality you are getting..
The staff even don't know how to talk with proper manner.. They don't know how serve the dishes .....
If you are in axis mall, and want a to take food, get it from the out food court ! or even you can try the road side stall out side.. But don't waste your money, time there.....

It's a very ordinary outlet. For a bar environment it's a good ambience with some TV and dim lighting and stuff but food wise it was just okay. The kebab was usual. We had a chicken dish which was just fine and tasty, Chicken Bharta along with butter nun, the nuns were soft and good. Overall food wise fine but quantity wise along with pricing was not so economic. Service was a bit slow. Overall a I must say good option for food in Axis Mall rajarhat.

Located in Axis Mall with a fair amount of space, it is a common place for mall-goers and IT people for takeaways or for casual lunch and/or dinner parties.They do home and office delivery as well.Food is okayish but very spicy and oily.

Service is pretty decent..

Went to this outlet since I had to be at a hospital nearby. First of all no one cares went you enter or seat yourself. You need to "ask" for the menu. Then you need to "ask" for a glass of water. When the glass of water is presented to you it comes with patches of fingerprints. And then you wait....
They do not care when you call in the meantime. 
They also took the order wrong and served me an extra naan. I asked them to keep it though in case we need an extra helping. The waiter seemed to be losing his job if I didn't keep that naan, going by his facial expression. The wash basin is dirty with a dettol dispenser with probably two drops of hand wash and rest was water. The food is average. Yes..Average. The time taken to present the bill was almost same as the time taken to serve food. 
Please avoid this place as much as you can or you might have severe expectation fits!!

I dropped in here one afternoon ,and it was an unplanned visit. The restaurant has two seating areas. One was almost full and the other one was almost empty,so we chose the latter. 
Ambience was quiet and relaxing. 
Staff were courteous. 
We ordered veg Hakka noodles, schezwan fried rice and veg Manchurian. Food was amazing. And the quantity was very very satisfying. 
A satisfactory visit it was. Looking forward to trying out their north indian menu as well

The worst ever restaurant I have ever been. Starter was made by expired chicken and it was smelling bad. Roti and rice that were served was probably made a day before and those were hot served hot. I ordered Soda lemonade and that was so bitter and smelling like rotten lemon. They preserve raw materials those were probably purchased long back and serve them till the stock lasts. Never expected such worst quality in a super mall. Frustrated. They must be closed by the Govt. They are risking customers life. I just hope that I'm not going to suffer from food poisoning. ¬†DO NOT GO there. Too costly. 1000 buck are just lost.

We visited this place yesterday,my girl had suggested this place to me long back and even though the reviews of this place are not that good I was not disappointed by the food.It is located in Axis Mall In Rajarhat.
Coming to the food for starters we opted for the sharabi murg which was good to taste but they could have been softer,for the main course we opted for tandoori butter roti,masala kulcha and handi murg.The masala kulcha was great and very tasty and the handi murg was also really tasty,not too spicy and the chicken pieces were also quite big.The ambience is nothing special and the service was a little slow but considering the taste of the food was quite good so it was worth the wait and the pocket pinch is also very reasonable.

The Afghani Murg Tandoori was top notch and impeccably done... A plate costs 375 and has 4 huge pieces... The other kabab we tried was Sharaabi Murg Kabab... This had 6 pretty large boneless pieces and came with a lot of spices... This was fulfilling too... Pretty laid back ambience and prompt service...

The service is too slow and neither food nor ambience makes a difference. The staffs are not bothered by that. They made us wait for 15 minutes just to take the order and then another 20 minutes to get the food. Nothing remarkable about the taste. Neither the makki roti, nor the chicken tikka. Sweet-salt-balanced fresh lime soda was too sweet. The firni wasn't delicious either. So, we didn't want to pay any tips. Surprisingly, the waiter ASKED FOR MONEY!! Whoa!! Who does that?

I went here with my friends since this is near to my office at Dlf 1. I must say that i didn't liked the food there at all. We ordered biriyani and i don't know why it was just horrible. It felt like it was stale. I will really not recommend going here. This was my first visit and hopefully the last.

To start with the ambiance, it's gud if you are planning with friends or family; the food was served 40 minutes after it was ordered. Now coming to quality the taste was average, nothing special. The service was not gud, one of the item was stale and though they changed it after much of chaos but the behaviour vexed me. The manager over there doest not understand the meaning of hospitality.  The same complain was made by anther group and so they were asked to leave, very disappointing. Could have given 3.5 star if the manager and staff would have been more courteous and the chicken would not have been stale. The texture of other items was gud but chicken should have been cooked a bit more.

Good place for hangout with friends, prices are also pocket friendly, varieties of items are there, quality and taste was also good but it was taking more time to serve otherwise overall good place. We took Arabian kebabs, mocktails, noodles, mixed rice, Hong Kong chicken, hot garlic chicken and we were not disappointed at all üòä thank you

The best part is ambience and food. Specially Mutton Galawati Kabab. One of the most beautiful dish, mutton was tender, soft, spices were proper and it was equally distributed. Biriyani is nice.. Drinks are fine and price is ok with the quality.. Best place to hangout and eat.

Visited this place for lunch one afternoon with a friend. The interiors are dimly lit and mostly packed with people looking for cheap booze. Not a very family friendly environment in my opinion. We placed a very ordinary order of tandoori roti, chicken tikka kabab and chicken butter masala. The taste was bland to my surprise..because normally punjabi restaurants serve awesome tasty cuisines.

The food taste was ok type. We ordered veg and non-veg items. But in veg, the menu named "punjabi kofta" was stinking. But the manager was not accepting his fault and he was challenging me to give 1 year free meal if that item is good. Then, I told him that if any person in this hall will say its fine then I will pay double the amount of the total bill. Then suddenly, his reaction changed and he started saying Sorry mam I am canceling this menu from your bill. 
I will never go there again.

Pros :- 1.Good ambience

What we had :- 1.Chicken Tikka Masala (Was awesome)

2.Keema Nan (average..not value for money)

3.Tandori Rotis (Stale)

Try out :- Chicken Tikka Masala

Quality of food has gone down since last time.Had ordered for Palak Paneer and chicken reshmi tikka masala.None of them were good in taste.Palak Paneer had no taste of actual palak in it.Gravy was bland and tasteless.ordered for Creamy mushroom soup but it tasted like dessert.

My honest request is to bring up the quality of food because the restaurant had its name few years back for good food.

The restaurant is quite big in space with many places to sit. The 4th floor of Axis mall mainly consist of this restaurant with 4 places to sit. Even the food court belongs to this restaurant. Though the food quality is saml in all the places, but the ambiance is quite different in different sitting place. The food quality is normal and mughlai items are better compared to chinese. Booze is quite cheaper compared to other restaurants. the price is reasonable in this restaurant.

Decent ambience, decent service. We went on 6/11/16 for dinner. We started with a tomato soup which turned out well, a mocktail called pamola which was over priced and very bad in taste, paneer tikka which was decent, chilli paneer dry which was too hot for my palate. For main course we ordered for a veg fried rice, mixed veg, daal fry and butter tandoor roti. The dal was very good. It was felt that the veg fried rice and mix veg had too much of sodium bicarbonate so we couldn't eat much and got them packed. Despite the cold weather the food didn't survive even one night so that got us thinking about the quality of food and hence, the rating.

The location of the place is good but that's all. The restaurant is run by a group of highly unprofessional bunch of people. They won't let you sit where you want to, when you ask for water they would provide you with a bottle only and no glass. When you talk to them their attitude seems to be way rude and nonchalant. Seems that as if they are the customer. We had ordered Chinese which took them way to long to prepare even when there were hardly any customer present. And when the food finally arrived we found toothpicks inside our noodles. When we complained the waiter seemed unfazed, as if it was a daily occurrence. The whole incident left a bad image of the restaurant, I hope the manager could turn things better in the future.

At first we ordered beer then we ordered Tandoori Roti, Chicken Bharta, Hakka Noodles, Chicken Szechwan Noodles, Chilli Chicken and Garlic Chicken. The food quality could have been better according to me. The service is good. Overall the experience is not great but good.

Mehak -e- Punjab does not live up to its name, in that it doesn't bring you the essence of Punjab or Punjabi food. They have opened so many places in the fourth floor of Axis Mall, serving all kinds of food items. They have one family style restaurant room for north Indian Chinese. They have another area for the bar. Yet another area is the food court style, serving south Indian, chaats, combo meals, juices, sweets, icecreams et all. The puri with aalu dum was ok. The papri chaat too was ok. The juice too was ok. In short just about everything was just ok, tolerable . In other words not much to speak of.
Needs to improve tremendously, both with regard to food and with the ambience.

Worst restaurant I ever had in kolkata.
I visited there on 8th October 2016 (between durga puja) for lunch.
All the items are spoiled. They've added excessive red chilli to supress the bad smell.
All 7 members of our family got stomach upset.
I don't know why the government banned this sort of worst "Man killing" restaurants.
Our honorable chief minister made some verdict that spets against be taken whoever sell spoil foods during pooja. I think in that clause this restaurant owner should also be punished.

I went for dinner tonight with my friends (I warned my friends as per zomato's review but they insisted so had to go there.). It is a third grade restaurant with worst food quality. We ordered butter naan, masala kulcha, veg jhal frezi and mushroom masala. Veg jhal frezi was STALE and mushroom masala was just like boiled mushroom. Waiter's behaviour was worst, he started shouting with other customers. Then after all these we wanted to try so sweets, waiter told we have a combo of gulab jamun(2 PCs) and vanilla ice cream (1scoop) but when it came it was 1 gulab jamun and 2 scoop of ice cream when we crossed the waiter he said this the combo, not even saying Sorry. 

If you want to get embarrassed in front of your friends and family then I recommend this place.

PATHETIC!!!!!

Me and my husband visited this restaurant few days back for dinner. We ordered lachha paratha, fried rice and chicken kolapuri. After 20 minutes the food was serverd. The fried rice was hard and footpath category ( sometimes they also serve better than that).
We found 3-4 piece of shredded chicken in a bowl full of gravy. And the worst thing is that they served a cool hard burnt ,blackish lachha paratha after 25 minutes. We were shocked . Is that a lacha paratha? Then we asked to change this for a better one. It will take more 15 minutes . But what was that? The paratha was served hot than before but this was torn, brunt and hard. Then we asked their manager about the paratha. The behaviour was so bad that he told me "that type of lachha paratha we made here , you don't know what is lachha paratha" . What an arrogance ! We did not finish our food. We left empty stomach and with  an experience we had never before. We will never go for this restaurant again. Horrible dinner we had that night.  If any option, I just want a Big 0 for rating . But I rated this 1.0 just for the boy who serve our food .

It was a Mahalaya afternoon and my friends and I decided to visit a new place for a change and we landed up here. Mehak-E-Punjab, the one in Axis Mall. The interior decor was nice; the starters good; the main course not good. But then comes the blot in the picture, and that would be the quality of service. Describing it as poor would be an understatement; it was awful. The staff members, including the waiters and managers, were very few in their numbers and highly uncooth in their mannerisms. The food that was told to be served within 15 mins took 25 mins (we had to take a nap in between). Highly disappointed with the service; we had to cancel the second round of order and leave the restaurant with our stomach half-empty. Such a poor display of service by a restaurant of such repute begs the question that, "Is it worth visiting this place another time?". After my experience it shouldn't come as a shock that the answer to that question is, "No.".

I have been visiting this place for a long time since we never had bars close to the vicinity in Rajarhat area. It is located on the 4th floor of Axis mall, they have 2 bars, one family restaurant and a food court in the same floor. If you are focussed on just the liquor and snacks then its a good option because its rather cheap compared to others. But over the years it has lost the quality and charm or may be it seems to be repetative with the craft which is on the downside. The taste is swingy rather somedays they are awesome and at times they are not.

The place has no maintenance. they have opened so many sitting areas but they can't manage it. Consider the Person asking you to order everything at once because they have lot of people to serve. Seriously if you can't manage then close those areas. It's not acceptable asking people to erder everything at once.
The food served was no doubt good. everything tastes just fine but the service sucks.
Water not served. No glasses. no side plate.¬†
with the food you serve this service just degrades the experience.¬†
We ordered three vegetable in Baby Corn Masala, Baby Corn Jhal Farezi, Paneer Tikka. they tasted yumm and especially the Baby Corn Jhal Farezi. The Kali Dal was also cooked well.
The breads were a little smaller in size like the serving bowl for vegetables were not full (75% Full).
¬†
P.S. go there for the food but dont expect an authentic Punjabi Flavour and service dont even dare expect that.

Went for a quick lunch on 15th August before catching a movie at Bioscope. A number of visits to this restaurant has made me believe that they lack consistency in quality and taste of food.
Nothing much to write about the ambience.Dimly lit and very basic.
We settled for Crispy Chilli Babycorn ,Kashmiri Pulao and Chicken Tikka Masala.The babycorn was overfried and a few pieces were slightly burnt even. Nevertheless, the sauce in which it was tossed was good enough for my liking.The pulao had small pieces of paneer and pineapple which lent it a sweet taste. As for the chicken dish there were 6 big pieces of chicken cooked in a silky smooth gravy and topped with cream. The gravy was delicious but the chicken pieces were tough and chewy. We were served pickle, small onions dipped in vinegar and green chillies as accompaniment.
Pocket pinch:Rs639.

Location : ¬†4th Floor , Axis Mall , New Town

Ambiance : Just about floats the boat . Nothing to go gaga over ! ¬†Although at night the dimmed down lights do render a certain mood .

Service : Not their strong point . ¬†The waiters are careless and absent minded . ¬†Takes forever to get their attention be it for the Menu card or otherwise . They don't even have the proper know how as to which dish of theirs is a hit ! All they know what is spicy ¬†& what isn't .. Even the waiting time was far too long for someone waiting to have their dinner on a Sunday Night ¬†: 40 mins. plus¬†

Food : The name says it all ! ¬†Although they serve up Chinese as well .. ¬†So much for Authenticity ! Anyway Ordered the Rara Chicken , Mutton Bhuna along with a handful of Tandoori rotis . ¬†The mutton bhuna was actually interesting . I believe it's their signature dish because i've never tasted anything remotely close to this at any Dhaba . Beautifully aromatic & tasty . Even though the gravy was scarce yet we were licking our fingers . The mutton was cooked very thoroughly and was very soft . ¬†The rotis were good enough thin but crispy . ¬†The rara Chicken on the other hand was submerged in a flood of gravy !! Like we had to throw 20% of the gravy even by the end of the meal ¬†! The chicken was spicy but tasty none the less . Overall the food quality is quite good even though their service isn't .¬†

Cost for 2 : 700/- +¬†

Random Knowledge : The pictures here in Zomato are of the Bar section which is completely different and isolated from the family portion . Both are absolutely separate .

Conclusion : Their service gives them a bad name ! Food quality is comparable to ¬†say Rang de Basanti in Sec-5 . Prices are reasonable . Service aside a good place . Don't go by the poor ratings . ¬†Although i could be a bit biased because this is the only punjabi place nearby from my place ! As for Axis mall it's in the Top 3 for sure .

Tthis place is on the 5th floor of the mall.  As the name says mahak e punjab but it does not look like  a Punjabi restaurant neither the dishes  they serve taste like punjabi dishes. Mai tikka are not sweet and u dont apply auger on it.  Not the best of experience.

One of the pocket friendly restaurants in new town..  The ambience and service is average. It gets cramped up during rush hours.. The food is okayish.. Only the kebabs are worth a notice.. Sharabi murg is one dish I relished eating here. This dish can set you up on fire, but totally worth it :)

I visited this place recently on a Sunday, with my family. No doubt food is good, especially mutton bara kebab and fish tikka, but service time is very poor. I would have given this place a 5 rating for the food and the price, but the experience has been bad last time regarding their service. We had to wait for nearly 45 minutes after the starters were served, despite having ordered for the main course and starters at a go. And the waiters were not attending properly. I would have wanted to visit this place again, but I would think about it now. However, it might have been a bad day for them for some reason, you could check it out for yourself as food is definitely recommended here!
Good luck Mehek- e- Punjab team!

Service offered by the food court run by Mahek Punjab is pathetic. ¬†There is restaurant by the name "Chinese" which had served us cold and stale chicken fried rice ¬†and overfried chilli chicken. Even after complaining they served us the same thing and did'nt bother to replace it. Such a sort of lackadaisical attitude was'nt expected and in future I will make sure that I am not ordering food from that place. Zomato should allow customers to put a negative rating for such kind of food outlets,. Putting a +1 is not at all justified because these outlets of the food court don't even pay heed. Stringent action must be taken against them.

THE most pathetic food experience of life time. I would probably give -10 for services and -5 for food. Opted for Mahak-e-Punjab with colleagues for a team dinner, as Addiction was already occupied and could not take our bookings. We did mention before hand that there would be five tables with six people sitting at each, and each of the tables would have separate order and would be separately billed. The manager assured that everything would be taken care of and handed over his card to give a call, if we needed anything.

The ambience was very, very basic and the place was so dimly lit that we had to read the menu using the flash lights of our phones.

The orders were taken and it was more than an hour nothing was served. When the food arrived as per the order of our table, our colleagues at some other table asked if it was their food and the person serving gave it to them. When we enquired, he jovially informed us that it was taken by the diners at some other table. This incident kept on happening throughout the time and with all the tables. The service staffs just brought food and served them randomly without checking who ordered what. The service was literally at snail's pace. We called up the manager several times, yet nobody picked up.

Our lungs dried up asking for water, again and again. A colleague who doesn't consume alcohol, asked for an coke almost 17-18 times, yet the coke did not appear, ever. The menu clearly mentions Bailey's Irish Cream is available by glass, yet they kept on insisting that I buy it  by bottle.

The food was horrendous. The hot and sour soup tasted exactly like chilli sauce. The tikka kebabs were ice cold (yes, you read that correctly). When we complained they explained that it got cold by the time is was brought from the kitchen to the table. Yes, that was the excuse. The fish kebab was stinky and smelled of stale fish. The mutton gilawati kebab was totally rotten and was slippery like boiled okra. The only edible thing was chicken tandoori. When we complained about rotten fish and mutton, the service person denied. We sent the food back and that particular service person stopped responding to the diners at our table. Naan and two chicken sides were okayish, and at least edible.

Needless to mention the bill wasn't prepared table wise and the entire bill was a mess. They even charged us for the dishes which we sent back because they were rotten and stinky. 

My point is, if you don't have enough experience, expertise to serve 30 people, or if you are under staffed, why take the booking in the first place?

Today I visited this outlet with my friends. We checked in to fulfill our cravings. The food quality and quantity was too good
Also the prices are reasonable enough to not to burn a hole in the pocket. But the service is very poor. Roadside joints are far better in servicing than this restaurant. Also they are taking min 30 mins to deliver foods. Do we have enough time for these?? 
The rating is just for the food. Servicing is a big zero.
Go for their Butter Nun. Punjabi Mutton. Hakka Chowmein and Garlic chicken..

I frequently visit this place since it is near to my office. The food served here is good. Mughlai dishes like Mutton Kebabs are delicious. Chinese dishes are nice. Sometimes the chicken preparations are not upto the mark since the chicken gets chewy! Alcohol served here is reasonably priced but the staff our extremely laid back. The service is slow and ambiance not upto the mark. Moderately satisfying services on a lazy afternoon/evening is expected if you visit the place.

The worst bar ever visited. Me and my 04 of friends visited last Saturday evening and at first we asked for water and waiter came with a bottle of water and when we asked for glasses he told they can only provide glass if we take drinks. Its really pathetic. Then, we have ordered 01 hookah but the hookah filter pipe given only 01 for 04 pax. We have make starter order but what we get is not good chicken and the worst part is when we complained the manager didn't even accept about food complaint he is blaming us that food is good. Last worst part is they add one additional item in bill and rectified after our complaint.

I often order food from this restaurant. The Indian dishes are pretty good. The food is quite oily though, and rarely they are not as tasty as they normally are. But pairing the dishes with rotis or rice they're sure to get you satisfied.
The fish tikka is pretty good in here.
And in chicken side dishes, I would suggest Reshmi Masala and Tikka Butter Masala.
For Chinese, there are better places.

As a post nabobarso celebration we opted for this place. It is situated at the top floor of the axis mall in newtown. Near to our office. Best of a quick lunch! Girls dressed up in saari and boys in ...same ol formal :P we reached this place at about 2 o clock all ready to have a "nabobarso" worthy lunch! 
But.. The experience was.... best to say... Not what we had expected! Half of our gang ordered Chinese and the other half settled for Indian! 
**Chinese**
The good stuffs first: The fried rice was great! A bit oily but full of chicken, shrimp and vegetables! The babycorn crispy chilly was appealing both looks wise and taste wise! 
The bad part was.. I guess they used old precooked chicken pieces for the chicken dishes! The gravy tasted fresh and flavorsome but the chicken pieces in it were dry and kind a blunt! Like "out of freezer and cooked".
**Indian**
The Indian breads were great! So was the mushroom masala! But the chicken!! The same problem! The gravy was tasty but the pieces were dry!! 
A bit of attention needed for the non veg dishes !!

Located on the top floor of Axis Mall this its a fairly cheap place regarding the expense if you ask me. They have done a lot with the display but not so with the quality of food. We ordered reshmi chicken kebab, chicken fried rice and chicken manchurian. The reshmi chicken kebab seemed overcooked. The chicken manchurian was quite tasty on the contrary. The fried rice can be deemed as just good. Watching IPL matches on the big LED TV was a treat though. The waiters were amiable but they took a fairly long time to prepare the food. However cannot give a score of more than this as overall it was pretty commonplace and not unique.

Located on the fourth floor of Bengal Axis Mall this is one of the pocket friendly restros that we can find in Rajarhat Newtown area. I visited this place for lunch a few days back. The food was not so great as it looked. We ordered sharabi chicken kebab, chicken kolhapuri, veg pulao, butter naan. The sharabi chicken looked great but the taste was kind of bland. The chicken kolhapuri was good and quite flavorsome. The pulao was good but still a feel good factor was missing might be because "Laaga Chunri mein daag" was being played on the 41" LED TV. Jokes apart the waiters were good to us and their reception was good. But as I remarked the feel good factor and warmth was missing and so the justified score.

After bill payment somehow they stole our bill so that we can not report about them on higher level, and then just denied about the staled food.

An example of a situation when you consider the case "Expectation vs. Reality". I am telling this because every time I visited here before, the food and the environment were quite good and I was very pleased. However, when I visited here on the Holi night, the total environment was a mess. Firstly, the hands of the waiters were filled with colours and it was very unhygienic (probably they should have worn gloves). Secondly, the space was very congested and the food quality was not upto the mark.

So, I advise this restaurant to look into these matters to make it a better place.

Good Ambience. Price is reasonable.
Service is too slow.
The food was good.
Took over 45 min for an order of chicken kohlapuri & veg hakka noodles.
The staff is not good at handling a large number of customers.

Overall a somewhat satisfactory experience.

Visited this place on a very special day with high expectations, but, it all came crashing like a wrecking ball! Their biryani is probably the worst i ever had. It was just plain jeera rice served with an undercooked piece of mutton. Rest of the dishes were consumable. Very bad experience. People, stay as far as you can from here!

Visited quite a few times since it is close to home. Situated on top of Axis Mall, it is close to the cinema hall. We have tried very few items, but we liked it. The veg items are very well prepared and the Rotis were good. Decor is a bit dimly lit. We noticed a lot of families and never did we see any altercations. Waiters were nice and helpful and service is quick if you go after 1 pm.¬†

Note - we stuck to selected veg dishes every time we went there. So no idea about beers or biriyanis. Had diff mixed veg and all kinds of koftas. they are pretty good.
            

Edit : After going there multiple times, we realised that we were just lucky earlier with regards to Service. One decent waiter and others simply tend to forget what was ordered.

I have been there at least hundred times; not because of their great quality of food , but for that the place is inside Axis mall - the most less crowded place used to be around 3-4 years back. 
As the name suggests, its predominantly a north indian restaurant, but gradually they built their expertise in chinese and other cuisines as well. Later on they opened the bar inside which added another petal in their blooming garden. Yes definitely in a calm and quiet place like Axis mall where if you don't have ur own vehicle, u wd always keep this place as ur last resort - this place was really a sigh of relief to me at least. Grab 3 beers, 2 chicken kebab starters - and ur bill will not criss 1000. 
Another great part of this place was, the parking was free of cost (now a days they charge 10/- per hour) so out of our middle class mentality I didn't have to look repeatedly to my wristwatch so that it doesn't ticks over a round figure time that I have to pay for the additional surplus minutes.
They used to arrange for buffet on weekends on a very nominal charge of 350 including tax. Though not that good, but if u can choose the best items- it surely gonna create the mouthgasmic ecstasy.
Overall a nice place to hangout within budget!!

When you hit a place on a Sunday evening, you've an expectation. You've a thrill and excitement. But this place turned us down. 
We were accommodated in a large executive dining room since the restaurant was full. But the door to the room was kept open the entire time we were there. The servers were lazy and didn't understand or know what were asking for. They took time to prepare and serve the food, even the liqour. The food was fair enough but nothing to brag about.
Oh BTW, they don't give until you ask to.. :(.

This outlet is in Axis Mall which is pretty close to our office so pretty convenient for a team lunch. I have tried both eating in and ordering. The eating in was not so bad, their food is extra spicy with limited taste but reasonably priced and ambience is alright. The service was kind of slow.¬†On the other hand, ordering was a pretty bad experience - they do not carry sufficient change, they do not come on time (they promise 1 hour I think and are still late). I find it strange how they do not have the common sense to supply a spoon or two with a dal dry.

The chicken tandoori is the only thing I liked about them that's why gave 2.5 stars. Their service being the worst nightmare we could ever had. we had to wait for like 1 and half to 2 hrs for the food and we had to gobble the food since we had to return office. That was the most annoying part. Coming to ambience which I didn't like at all, the lightings were not proper and the floors or the tables were not that much clean. They didn't even provide any water to drink we had ask for water. Overall not a great experience at all.

Extremely poor service! had to wait a lot during lunch hours for the food to arrive. And they specialize in their mutton - you will need hammer and chisel to cut it. Even my shoes seem softer than their mutton. I don't mean to be rude, but I paid for something which I could not even eat ! The chicken was well prepared though. Will never visit this restaurant again.

N delicious kebabs, in all tastes and shapes. Fish kebabs are the best with no fishy smell at all, then comes the mutton Lucknowi kebabs, the soup is simply priceless. Green apple martini with crushed cherries,the creamiest freshest pinacolada are just to name a few!! Visit to explore..

Been here twice and this place mostly remains not so crowded. They offer liquor at quite reasonable price and you can order starters from a plethora of items. Do try their egg pakora, its nice. Apart from that I've had tandoori chicken,chilli baby corn,sharabi murg,mutton galoti kabab,chilli mushroom,paneer tikka,fish finger. They are all tasty but my recommendation would be sharabi murg - its yummilicous. Apart from these starters you can try tandoori roti or butter nan or garlic nan in breads section or pulao or biriyani from rice. The Hyderabadi murg is also a dish to try out if you like creamy chicken curry. You can have it with both rice or bread.

This bar-cum-restaurant , located on the topmost floor of Axis Mall, Rajarhat is a favourite haunt for office-goers and you are sure to always find a large group eating out there. The restaurant is invariably crowded, especially the family section and this leads to the staff diverting the family restaurant customers to the bar section. All this does is make the whole experience uncomfortable for both groups of people.
      We had aimed for the bar section and thus had no such problems. The ambience inside is a bit gloomy but most bars in Kolkata are decked up similarly so it wasn't hard to adjust. They have a whole range of drinks on offer and more importantly most of them are available. (This is in part due to their adjoining off-shop) 
      For starters we had ordered Malaysian style Chicken and Oyster Chicken. The Malaysian chicken was a kind of fancy kebab and tasted ok. The Oyster chicken was lip-smackingly good and we were left wanting for more. For main course we ordered for Chicken Biriyani which was quite good actually. On the side we had Chicken butter masala which tasted fine but could use a bit more seasoning. 
    The bill didn't burn a hole in our pockets thankfully. 
     If you are going there for the first time i would definitely recommend the Oyster Chicken. It was out of this world!

I, along with three other friends, went to Axis Mall for a movie this Friday. Being famished during the noon, we decided to hit Mehak-e-Punjab. One of my friends is a regular at their bar, therefore, on his recommendation, we end up coming here.What we ordered:Sharabi Murg (kebabs)- 200/-Kashmiri Pulao- 120/-Paneer Tikka Butter Masala- 150/-I found the kebabs quite soft, tender and moist. With the salad and the green chutney, it was quite delectable at such a reasonable price.The pulao had the right amount of sweetness to it, nothing too edgy. However, I felt it could have been a little less oily.As for the paneer, I really didn't find any flaw. It was cooked just the right way to satiate my taste bud.As for the ambience, the dim lighting was really a warm welcome for us, all of us wanted a nice, cozy place to dine in with the right amount of quiet. The staff was quite responsive too.However, I found one of the corners having a very strong pungent odour of I do not know what. But it was way too eerie for me to have my lunch there, so I had to opt for a different seat.¬†Another downer I found was, the kitchen comes right in the middle of the restaurant, with the seating arrangement being divided into two separate sections.
All in all, Mehak-e-Punjab filled my stomach, and in a good way, in a time of dire need, hence I award it with 4 stars.

This review is more about the bar at mehek e Punjab. I have been there couple of times and the service is pretty poor. The only good thing was the prices. They would also offer a discount card that doesn't work on public holidays. Now here's the trick this public holidays are decided by the management/owner and it is without prior notice. When you are about to pay your bill don't be surprised.

One of my friends is a regular at their bar, therefore, on his recommendation, we end up coming here.What we ordered:Sharabi Murg (kebabs)- 200/-Kashmiri Pulao- 120/-Paneer Tikka Butter Masala- 150/-I found the kebabs quite soft, tender and moist. With the salad and the green chutney, it was quite delectable at such a reasonable price.The pulao had the right amount of sweetness to it, nothing too edgy. However, I felt it could have been a little less oily.As for the paneer, I really didn't find any flaw. It was cooked just the right way to satiate my taste bud.As for the ambience, the dim lighting was really a warm welcome for us, all of us wanted a nice, cozy place to dine in with the right amount of quiet. The staff was quite responsive too.However, I found one of the corners having a very strong pungent odour of I do not know what. But it was way too eerie for me to have my lunch there, so I had to opt for a different seat.¬†Another downer I found was, the kitchen comes right in the middle of the restaurant, with the seating arrangement being divided into two separate sections.
All in all, Mehak-e-Punjab filled my stomach, and in a good way, in a time of dire need, hence I award it with 4 stars.

This review is more about the bar at mehek e Punjab. I have been there couple of times and the service is pretty poor. The only good thing was the prices. They would also offer a discount card that doesn't work on public holidays. Now here's the trick this public holidays are decided by the management/owner and it is without prior notice. When you are about to pay your bill don't be surprised.

I really like Mehak e Punjab. We had ordered Butter Nan, Chicken tikka masala, Chicken tandoori and chicken Hariyali Kabab. The chicken was very soft and juicy, melt in the mouth type. The gravy was also very tasty though a bit oily. The amount of food they give is really great! The butter Nan were soft and fresh. I also enjoyed the lassi.

A good place in the axis mall.Ambiance was average.Food was tasty from starters to desserts.Pocket  friendly.Service needs to be improved.One thing is that it doesn't have authentic taste or the original taste from its name Mehak-e-Punjab...Apart from this no issues.Recommended!!!!

Nice ambience. Dimly lit with separate smoking and non smoking areas. Tables are neat . Although the place was almost full but they provided quick service. Staff is very humble n well mannered. I had some great tasting food here that too for such nominal price. The portion of chicken provided in chicken tikka curry was plentiful and very tender. Full was spices n flavours. Chicken fried rice was good. nice place to fine in with family n friends.

This one in the Axis Mall is the most visited one because if this location. It's a nice place to chill after office, but then somehow or the other whenever I land up there, I get the feeling that I could gone to a better place. 1. They don't mostly have the alcohol of your choice. 2. The ambiance is too dull. 3. They play pathetic songs (that could be a coincidence as well).
Food on the other hand, is good. Be it Indian or Chinese. The service is good as well. 
I just hope to see some betterment in the coming days.

Let me come straight to the point:

Pros: "Excellent Service, we ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Plain Rice and Fish Masala. The taste was pretty good with the Punjabi flavor as promised. The fish could have been better though. At a convenient location and it has a exterior food-court too, if you need a change for your test bud or you are keeping to the budget. The ambiance is homely and cosy"

Cons: "I felt the food is overpriced. Could really do with slashing away the prices. Another thing I noticed is that if the numbers of customers increase, the waiters struggle to manage. An increase of employees is suggested to handle such situations"

Visited this place 2 times but 2nd time experience wasn't as good as 1st time. They have 3 seperate rooms. 2nd one attached with the bar counter is far better in decoration, ambience and service. Food quality is ok not that great. Not much expensive, reasonibly priced. If you visit this place try to be at the 2nd room. Service is worst in 3rd one.

We have visited ¬†there once.The restaurant is decent from budget to interior.We order malai kebab and chicken reshmi kebab for our starter. Malai kebab was real good.Then we ordered some naan and a mutton preparation.That was also thikthak.We tried the chicken Biryani too.But the taste was not that good.Local restaurants even provide a better Biryani than them.So never try the Biryani here.
But the place is a lil bit crowdy and service was not real good.We had to wait for 10 minutes to pay our bill.And waiting for food will make u sleepy sometimes.Service is the worst here.Still the food was ok.So i am going with a rating of rating 3.

This is a pretty bad restaurant in new town axis mall 4th  floor area. Ambience is not so good. Food is medium costly but not at all tasty. I am not sure if food quality is consistently so bad but i have faced low quality. Chicken was not properly cooked and not at all salty from inside. Gravy was having uncooked onion. Also found frozen smell in naan. It is a complete waste of time and money.

After my wife and I moved to Rajarhat eight months ago, this has become our favorite restaurant in Rajarhat. Their preparations are good, portions are generous and prices are reasonable. Service is satisfactory. 

We have eaten here several times and entertained guests too. Their biryanis and Punjabi dishes are good. We tried Chinese once and found it satisfactory. 

Overall, this restaurant probably offers the best value for money out of all the restaurants in Axis Mall, New Town.

Located at the top floor of axis mall, this joint offers alcohol at very reasonable price. Ther is a small smoking place inside the restro that helps the boozers a lot. You have to wait to get your food. Quality of food is average. They have arranged tables for family, group of friends, couples and have a good space also. Lemon chicken was awful.

This place is divided into two separate sections, one the food only and other one, bar cum restaurant. It's a popular place among the office goers in Rajarhat, specially during weekends. I have been to both the sections on couple of occasions. I must say the food only restaurant section is far better than the bar cum restaurant, in terms of service. Usually any good restaurant would have a dedicated attendant for a large group of customers, but I didn't see anything like that here in the bar cum restaurant. The waiters had no coordination. We were almost forgotten at times. We had to call and scream at times to grab their attention and to get even a bottle of water. They were short-staffed. Waiters lack etiquette and proper mannerism. Service time took ages. We had to wait for a long time for the starters and other foods. Coming to starters, they were pretty average. We ordered Paneer Tikka Kebab (okayish), Chicken Tikka Kebab (ordinary), Prawn Pakora (waste of time and money), Chicken Amritsari Kebab (okayish), Mutton Seekh Kebab (tasted like sick kebab)! However, the mocktail, Sex on the Beach was good.

Now coming to the good part, the main courses. Honestly, after the horrendous starters experience, they surprised me with the main dishes. Having said that, I did try their food earlier as well, where I liked the Biryani, Mutton Korma and Chicken Tandoori. This time we went on an office party, so we ordered a lot of items. Mutton Biryani, Masala Kulcha, Naan, Butter Chicken, Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Cantonese Noodles, Mixed Fried Rice, Chilly Chicken Dry and Veg Biryani too. I must say, I loved the Reshmi Masala, tasted sweet, to my liking, (also the way they garnished the dish by writing "welcome" over it with some cream), also loved the Butter Chicken, really great quantity and wonderful pieces of chicken and delicious gravy. And lastly, the Mutton Biryani, which is to die for. I am a biryani freak, and trust me, it was awesome. It had 2 pieces of mutton and a small potato in it. Nice and soggy texture, super color and great taste. The mutton was beautifully cooked, tender and too good in taste. Looked and tasted more like Awadhi biryani. The prices are on the higher side.

My rating 3 is actually on the main course food they served, or else I was not pleased with their service. The seating is slight uncomfortable, with the wooden chairs. It would help if you can manage to get one of the sofa arrangement, if you are going in a large group. The ambiance is okay, lighting on the lower side. 

If you have to visit Mehak-e-Punjab, please do not try the bar cum restaurant option, but go with your family or friends and enjoy the food only restaurant and get treated to some delectable dishes!

Went to this Restro last month.....overall satisfied with the food quality and ambience. It is spacious and that is the reason you will not find people waiting outside often. We ordered Tandoor Chicken, Butter Naan, Kadhai Chicken, Handi Mutton. All the dishes were coocked well, service and behaviour of stuff was good, however foods were delivered lately, we got the starter about 40 mins late than the time when we ordered, followed by the main course, which was served quickly after that. Overall good experience and recommends for good hangouts of friends.

Okay so Mehak-e-Punjab is the Mamata Banerjee of restaurants. It runs only because you don't have a better alternative anyway and you are a stuck at a wrong destination (Axis Mall).

You go to Mehak-e-Punjab only when you:

(A)

1. Have you workplace around New Town area
2. Landed up at Axis Mall accidentally¬†
3. Went to watch a movie at Bioscope (because you did not want to spend more than 100 bucks)
4. Are tired with Penguin, Oval, KFC located at the DLF Buildings 1
5. Planned for a short drive with your date and she suddenly felt the need to buy a hand sanitizer from Specer's.

(B)

1. ¬†Decor: Tacky
2. Staffs: Most of them are under aged (yes, below 18 years)
3. Food: Yeah, whatever. Just for the sake of drinks.
4. Complimentary Drinks: Are you kidding me?
6. Crowd: Weird couples.¬†
7.  Value for money: Only if you close your eyes and drink.
8.  Referable: No

Good place for first date: Only if you are mad.

(C)
Negative Points: Child labor (and everything else)
Positive Points: Smoking zone, car park (which comes with axis mall), month end eatery.

There have different bar area which has been separated from the family crowd visiting the mall. A number of drinks are not available which is disappointing. Popular with the office goers in Rajarhat and Salt Lake for a drink and get together after office hours. Visit this place only if the others around it are not available.

Today I went there. But I am totaly disappointed with the food served over there.  We ordered for tandoori chicken as starter and then butter naan, mutton do pyaza,  chicken tikka masala and salad in main course. Firstly I ll tell about the worst service. They served us some onions as complementary but those were not fresh at all. They served our food after almost 35 mins. Tandoori chicken was not coocked properly. Rest of the items were very average in taste. So overall its a bad experience for me today.

Quite a hype. This place is in Axis Mall. Right next stop to New Town.
The Mutton was quite a quantity served here. The garnishing was just fine, but I felt that they overdid a little. There was a slight smell in their meat which was striking. The butter nan was the usual one we normally find. The other dishes I tried here weren't striking enough for me to give a second visit. Though quite a lot of numbers prefer this place.
I have had Punjabi cuisine in the authentic restaurants, hence I will not rate this place any better.
The service is quite variable. They keep the crowd quite uninformed about the inside seat section and their special menu items. Hence, I might go here only if there is a very high deniable situation.

Well. When I entered the place I was little disappointed over the ambiance as it is a very normal looking restaurant and in any shopping mall you generally expect a little costly restaurants with at least a beautiful ambiance ¬†if not some great food. But this place is certainly lack of this quality.

Now, lets come to the service part. In a word, the service is below average. We have got our food nearly half an hour after placing the orders and that too starters only.¬†

And finally "The food". As they have a separate menu for kebabs, we thought their specialty would be in kebabs. So, we have ordered - ¬†Chicken Afghani tengri kebab, Mutton golouti kebab, butter nan, amritsari kulcha, kadai mutton, chicken butter masala.¬†

The kebabs are good but not that great. I found the golouti kebab a little more spicy than usual but that's OK. However, the main dishes are again below quality. Except the butter nan, other foods are not that good. It seems Amritsari kulcha is a very cheap modification of aalo paratha. And the kadai mutton is actually worst among all dishes. I can bet that ¬†you have never seen such huge mutton pieces in your life and I am seriously doubtful about the mutton. The taste is just horrible and to chew the mutton pieces you need a really strong teeth with lots of patients.

So, overall verdict, it is not at all value for money and I would never like to go into that place again.

The taste and quality of food has gone downhill, but the upward revision of the prices have not stopped. The service sucks, too. All in all, not a great experience being here.

Well. When I entered the place I was little disappointed over the ambiance as it is a very normal looking restaurant and in any shopping mall you generally expect a little costly restaurants with at least a beautiful ambiance ¬†if not some great food. But this place is certainly lack of this quality.

Now, lets come to the service part. In a word, the service is below average. We have got our food nearly half an hour after placing the orders and that too starters only.¬†

And finally "The food". As they have a separate menu for kebabs, we thought their specialty would be in kebabs. So, we have ordered - ¬†Chicken Afghani tengri kebab, Mutton golouti kebab, butter nan, amritsari kulcha, kadai mutton, chicken butter masala.¬†

The kebabs are good but not that great. I found the golouti kebab a little more spicy than usual but that's OK. However, the main dishes are again below quality. Except the butter nan, other foods are not that good. It seems Amritsari kulcha is a very cheap modification of aalo paratha. And the kadai mutton is actually worst among all dishes. I can bet that ¬†you have never seen such huge mutton pieces in your life and I am seriously doubtful about the mutton. The taste is just horrible and to chew the mutton pieces you need a really strong teeth with lots of patients.

So, overall verdict, it is not at all value for money and I would never like to go into that place again.

Nice comfy but kinda small restaurant in Axis Mall. Food is good not that great. Price not much, nice alternative to hv lunch than my office canteen as my office is close to Axis Mall we end up going there now and then. Nothing special about it but ok ok :) 
One major turn off of this place and a very important suggestion for any who are planning to go there is please order all ur food at once and then just forget it for the next half an hour at least if u r lucky u will get it in less than that but I really doubt that and this is the scenario when it's not at all crowded. God knows what will happen when it gets crowded if at all it does ever :P
If u miss out on something and u order something in between or when u r about to finish I would rather suggest go and have a round in the mall u might get it when u r back or don't do it at all coz it will take ages to come :P this is exaggeration but I think u get the point ;)

I went there with a my colleagues for farewell lunch of one ( total 16 people) and the waiters were not courteous enough to make arrangement so that we can sit together. We had to make arrangements ourselves. We order biriyani, butter nun, kulcha, mutton vuniya,chicken tikka masala. Chicken items had a nasty smell. Mutton biriyani was good. Mutton vuniya was well cooked. Couple of plates we found not cleaned properly. Overall not a very likable experience.  Should definitely work on the hospitality part.

The starters are pretty delicious. The main course , however, was not at par with the quality of the starters. We ordered chicken lollipop,which were,for the three non-veg guys,insufficient. So we ordered couple of more dishes chicken malai kabab and crisply chilli baby corn. 
I must mention that among the three veg dishes we ordered,the baby corn was the best. So we ordered another plate of that .
The main course lacks the taste we expected. The presentation skills of the chefs are also questionable as they looked like some home made food made by your younger sister with lots of spices and excessive oil. Surely they have to improve on that.

The 'chkn pahadi kebab' is a kind f unique concept here, kebabs coated under fried egg omelette. 
They give fruits in kashmiri pulao.. But if u wanna go for traditional yellow pulao, go for the vegetable pulao. Don't get confused then ;)

Not a great decor to impress, this restaurant beside the food court offers just good food... Divided well into family restaurant and bar (one section of it is dedicated only for stag). Surprised to see it pretty much filled at 4.30pm. We were late for lunch and ordered chicken kolhapuri, egg tadka, butter nan, and tandoori roti...service time was OK but the food compensated for all the small hiccups... The chicken was tender, balanced and had a rustic taste with good usage of garlic, egg tadka was too good and one plate easily suffices for two...the breads were made perfectly... All these at a very pocket-friendly  price and specially for a restaurant located in a mall...a must visit for just the honest food they serve...hope to visit sometime very soon...

Team outing in Rajarhat is becoming a pain in the neck due to the absence of a good restaurant. This time we chose Mehek-e-Punjab at Axis Mall. There are three sections in the restaurant, a family section, a drink and food section and a complete bar. We sat at drink and food section where the ambience was good but can do better with a little more light. 

There were flurry of starters which were not bad. Special mention to chicken tengri kabab even though it was a bit salty. The mutton was very spicy. The main dish section was a disaster in my opinion. Biryani looked and tasted like polao. Mutton piece in the biryani hadn't been cooked well either. Side dishes were equally dissapointing, none of them tasted good even though all were edible. Keema nun seemed to be relatively better.

I am not going back in recent times for food, might be there with friends for drinks.

Mutton Punjabi! Ask your waiter for this because it is not in the menu and this is the best dish they have. I heard about this place from my colleagues and finally got a chance to visit there. We ordered crispy chilli baby corn and chicken reshmi kebab as starter. The kebab had a good smell of roasted spices and soft pieces of chicken. With a glass of sweet lime soda, the starter set the mood for the evening. The main course had butter naan, mixed chicken noodles and chicken reshmi butter masala. Naan was soft and warm, chicken reshmi butter masala had tasty gravy and soft pieces and noodles had standard taste and good quantity. But the dish of the evening was mutton Punjabi. With the soft well cooked pieces of mutton and very tasty gravy, it was nothing like I had before. We tried with both naan and noodles and surprisingly both tasted excellent. Planning to go there again as soon as possible :)

Well..what not to mention about this place. Its just has a perfect share of quality,quantity f food with price. Have been there innumerable times and every time I visit it feels really good. The service is good and they surely make you comfortable in every possible way. I simply love the food and even the pocket pinch isnt much. Well everytym I visit these items surely are there on the list - chicken hot n sour/chicken manchow soup, crispy chili baby corn - very spicy, so if u rnt a spice lover plz do tell them beforehand, mushroom - either tandoori or masala both are good, garlic naan and lastly the yellow dal tadka..simply delicious.
You can try these for sure..
Rest are on the variable string.

Visited this restaurant on a sunday for lunch. Its a very small place with very dim lighting. So the ambience isnt great. 
We ordered for the nonveg platter which had chicken and fish kebabs, daal makhani,butter naan and boondi raita. 
The food overall was good and the quantity was decent. Its very light on the pocket as well. I didnt like the service, the moment the plates were cleared the bill appeared. Got the feeling that they wanted to get rid of us. I did observe that the people next to our table had to ask the waiter a couple of times for some extra bowls. The waiter was kind of rude to them.
Im not sure if i wuld visit again, as there are better restaurants in the vicinity.

Located on the 4th floor of axis mall, rajarhat, this place serves lip-smacking food. They have a large seating capacity thus getting a table for two at 7.30pm was not a tough job. For starters ordered chicken reshmi kebab. Taste was good but the chicken was a bit rubbery and wasn't tender enough. For main course, we opted for a butter nan, a paneer kulcha and kadhai murg. The kadhai murg was a bit on the spicy side but tasted well though. Best was the paneer kulcha. Stuffed with mashed paneer, it was really tasty. Butter nan was okayish, could have been better. Decor was good, waiters were friendly and prompt in their service. Pocket pinch: 685rs. with alcohol.

The chicken tikka and naan were fabulous. 

We ordered a delivery of these and after being told it would be one hour, the food arrived in 35 minutes. The tikka was succulent and the butter naan were moist and tender.

Fast delivery helped make it a better light meal.

Pros: Amazing afghan tandoori chicke, bhetki fish tandoor tikka was mindblowing.
Cons: Service could be faster, rotis are a bit chewy.

Overall, good place for typical north indian cusine around salt lake.

Among those very few places to hang out in axis mall. Both chinese and indian items are good. Best part is pocket friendly liquor though not much of choice is available. Mixed crowd is a downside.

Don't go for starters here because they have spoiled ones. you can go for main course, they are nice and tasty. We ordered starters first some are OK but most of them are watery and even smell came from tandoori chicken so be careful before ordering them

Thinking really hard what to write about this restaurant apart from¬†being a very 'typical' & run-of-the-mill food that gets served in good Quantity. Well the quality could have been better for sure. ¬†I kept wondering why call a restaurant Mahek-e-Punjab (fragrance of Punjab) and yet have a Chinese menu tucked into.¬†A¬†neutral name to accommodate more than 1 type of cuisine would have been more appropriate, I felt. Anyway we tried a¬†few regular Punjabi ones and yes they were regular stuff. Ditto for¬†¬†Chinese. Its a restaurant where you would not have a specific complain, yet you would perhaps not want to make a planned visit.

A reasonably priced restaurant amidst a mall.... Although the name is a big misnomer !!
Ordered chicken kebabs and prawn pakoda. Although I usually avoid prawn, thought of giving it a try. It didn't taste at all of prawn! Kebabs were good. For main course, ordered chicken biriyani which was at best "edible".. Waiters are n't very courteous and sometimes you would hear them argue  unnecessarily with customers. 2.5 stars for only the reasonable price and location.

Terrible!!! thats the one word for this. yesterday I went their to grab Tandoori chicken at around 10PM.
After 15 mins I got that and came back home. But once I opened the foil it smells foul. Then after first bite to try I realized that ¬†Tanndory chicken was stale and rotten. and the foul smell was coming from there. immediatly I dialled in there. The person was really very polite and offered that he will send someone with fresh dishes. The delivery boy was promt and arrived in 15 ¬†mins and handed over the fresh one in exchange of the stale ones.
Any way my delight to this exceptional service didn't last long as the remaining 2 pieces out of 4 was again stale and with bad smell. We didnt take a chance at midnight to call or give it a try. I think their cook or the owner think that people in Kolkata and rajarhat area will try whatever is in their plate. Anyway I am opting out this from my list .

The food is average. The food is very oily. Nothing new on the menu. You will get regular food here.
Positives: They never say no for home delivery. It's never too late to call them up for ordering food. They will deliver food from North Indian cuisine to French Fries :)
Negatives: Regular food. Deliver time is more than an hour.

Well this restaurant has no interior decorations except for some wooden designs surrounding you ,so nothing much to feel good about the place . Now about the food if we talk it fairs good cause the quantity is nice as well as the preparation,so eating over here isn't a bad option for a moderate dinner to save the wallet from ending up spending way to much as compared to other restaurants.

My verdict - Don't go with your girlfriend or Date over here cause Romance factor won't be developing thanks to the ambiance but with friends or family to this place will be fine.

A good eating joint in Axis mall. Interiors are not very impressive. The restaurant is not well illuminated. 
The food is reasonable and descent. Their Indian food is better than chinese. ¬† The dal makhni is great. The masala kulcha and chicken reshmi butter masala was good. The service is very poor and needs to improve a lot. The staff is not courteous enough. However, if you do not want to make deep holes in your pocket, this is the right place. Worth a try.

Mehak e punjab is a multi cuisine restaurant located in Axis mall. The restaurant is not at all a visual treat. Looks like they have barricaded a corner on the top floor of the mall. Space constraint is a big issue. I have given it 4 stars only because of the food which believe me is awesome. Must trys :- Chicken wings, Tandoori chicken, Mushroom salt and pepper. The chinese dishes are also good. The only downside is the cheap crowd that comes in because of the cheap liquor that is served in the bar. The waiters are quick to serve but poor in management. They were letting people drink and create a mess in the area where families were having dinner. So if you are looking for a quite place to go with your spouse/children this might not be ur kind of place but if you are looking for a place with cheap, tasty food to hang out with friends this is the place to go.

Have been to this place quite a time. The place has been renovated. Earlier there used to be a single large room for the bar section with a blue hue enhancing the ambiance. But the recent modification is quite banal and shabby. Mehek e Punjab is a renowned brand for good food. But the teghoria outlet is much better when it comes to the dine-in-bar . The waiters are not much friendly and the service was one of the worst . An order took more than hour to deliver to our table. The TV channels propping from the walls was decided by the bar owners which will make u feel to watch as they want to show you.¬†Coming to food quality, non veg platter looked very good but the chicken was half cooked. The experience was not good in this outlet.¬†Would try to avoid this outlet ¬†and go to an alternative place from the same brand.

Despite the name Punjab this place also serves chinese and one if those restaurants on Rajarhat which does offer a pocket friendly nature
Had a visit last year after watching Hawa Bodol in Bioscope
Located in Axis Mall in 4th floor

--QUALITY N QUANTITY--
For starters we ordered Chicken Pakora, which was filled with flour n Chicken was hard to find, so we asked one of the waiter to explain, he came n broke all the other pieces on the plate n it was no different, we had to sent it back
For main course we ordered 1 Chili Garlic Fried Rice N Shezwan Fried Rice, and 1 Shezwan Chicken 
After that disappointing start we felt all the other dish wont be any different but they followed that with some excellent quality. The fried rice was great n the chicken was also. 
And the quantity was perfect for a couple to enjoy. 

--AMBIENCE--
Ambience also nice, but instead of a tv if this place could play some nice tunes, it would have been better.. 

--BEHAVIOR OF STAFF--
The staffs were well behaved, when we complained about chicken pakora they did reply with an even nice quality of pakoras. 

Would love to visit this place again..

Went there yesterday afternoon with friends. Nice cozy place, we were ushered to the inside, decorated with comfy sofas. Food is really great, and quite pocket friendly. Service was little on the slow side. We tried 3 diff kebabs - pahadi, malaysian and malai. Good variety in taste and all were nice.. Our main course order of lachha parota, chicken biriyani and chicken tikka masala also tasted right, and of nice amount. Overall, I always like to hit this place whenever I feel hungry and near Axis mall. :)

With very less options in Axis mall this place is the best restaurant in Axis mall. Interiors are neither very good nor very bad. Seating arrangement is not very comfortable, also the restaurant is not well illuminated. 
They have separated the restaurant into three parts:-
1. restaurant without bar
2.family bar
3. stag bar
food served is reasonable and descent. They serve chinese and Indian but i feel that Indian is better than chinese. 
Mahek-e-punjab is basically a bar which also serve food.
Overall nice and affordable place in Axis Mall

Due to unavailability of any good food joint nearby, we decided to arrange our corporate team lunch at this place. Though i expected the place not to be as good as famous resturants of kolkata, but to my utter bad luck i discovered even the foods sold at roadside places are way better than this. Among 3 varieties of kababs only the fish kabab was a bit edible . Coming to the main course we asked for fried rice , a chiken preperation and a mutton dish. The fried rice was stinking, chicken was pathetic and i get a better mutton when cooked at home . So overall the experience was really pathetic.

After reading couple of reviews where it was written this place offers fast home delivery, etc we decided to place an order from this place. My apartment is quite well known on the main road about seven kms away from the eatery. They took a bit more than 1 hour 45 minutes to reach my place! When asked the person whether he had difficulty locating the place, he said that he had just started late from their place! Nearly 2 hour delivery time is sometimes really not acceptable. Anyway, then coming to the food - we had ordered for chicken reshmi butter masala, chicken tikka masala, chicken biriyani and masala kulcha. Out of these masala kulcha and chicken reshmi butter masala were good. They were nicely cooked with nice taste and aroma. Chicken tikka masala is not worth a mention, just another average north indian extra-spicy dish. The chicken biriyani was actually bad, it had NO salt in it. God knows how can they miss out on such basic ingredient like salt. It was really horrible to have this biriyani, and in the end I was compelled to leave the plate unfinished. So the cooking is very inconsistent and average to say the least. Overall - a very average dining experience. Also we had been to this place one time few months back at their bar, the place has average sitting arrangements and nothing really great that is worth a mention. So there is scope of improvement when it comes to the ambiance as well.

So, why 1.5 when the Mehak-e-Punjab supposedly won Zomato User's Choice award as proclaimed and displayed by the management in the holding area at the entrance of the bar?

Few of us thought that today was the best day to celebrate the start of monsoon after the scorching heat of last few weeks. And, we headed off for the Mehak-e-Punjab in the Axis Mall. It was 01:30 pm. To balance off the gloomy weather, we needed some quick vodka shots and food.

The bar has two sitting areas - the area at the entrance is complete with sofa and has a lounge feel with dimmed lights and the inner area is more of a normal not-so-innovative sitting area with shocking orange lights. The interior decor guys evidently did a mess of it.

We wanted to sit in the lounge area because it was virtually empty but we were ushered into the inner area. There were no particular reasons why they did not wanted us to sit in the lounge. We were sober, with business casuals, and even the company tags were poking out.

We were just about to sit down when we noticed there are large pile of rubbish cluttered in the floor. And, it was not in a single place only, there were isolated pool of rubbish and dust on the entire floor. It was a disgusting sight, more so in a place where you are going to eat and pay a large sum of money. We asked the waiters to clean up the area, and they asked us back to wait out as it will take some time for them to clean up.

It was not that we arrived at 4 AM in the morning or 3:30 PM in the afternoon. It was 1:30 PM. The peak time at any restaurant to serve the lunch seekers.

I have heard a lot good about this restaurant but I need to admit that the first impression is probably going to change for quite a long time. No, we did not wait. It was easy to find another restaurant.

This review is STRICTLY based on  DINNER BUFFET in the restaurant

The dinner buffet is served in separate banquet hall. The charge is 290 r.s (including tax) per person. BASED on the PRICE the food was VALUE FOR MONEY. The menu was given below

Cold Drink  ----  Not Chilled
Salad ---  Average
Raita   ---  Average
Chicken Lemon Soup --- Average
Veg Lemon Soup ---    Not Tested 
Chicken Lollypop  ---  Average
Paneer pokora ---  Below Average
Dal --- Average
Mixed Veg --- GOOD
Roti --  Average
Veg Chow ---  Average
Paneer Manchurian ---  BAD
Peas Polao ---  Average
Chicken Makhani --- Average
Gulab Jamun --- Not Tested

There are lots of food for that price range so that is the Good part. Chicken Lollypop was deep fried and looks like forzen packet chicken was used because it has a distinct smell which you usually will not find in fresh chicken or even in Arambag chicken. Same is applicable for another chicken dish. The Mixed veg was really good and tasty and that is the only thing in the menu I can not complain about. 

The ambiance is another area where I am not satisfied. The restaurant has permanently decorated the hall for kids birthday party because that is why this banquet hall has mostly been used by local people. Another bad part is that HARD DRINK is NOT served in the banquet hall. Therefore if you want couple of drink before your food then you need to go another area

You can definitely try this restaurant for small budget office party BUT DO NOT BRING YOUR BF/GF here as you will definitely regret that decision 

VALUE FOR MONEY -----   4
AMBIANCE ------     2.5
FOOD ---   3
Service --- 3

Serves good food and at reasonable rate too. Ambience-wise, it's not a good place as it's always crowded especially during week-ends as it's one of the few places to eat in the neighboring areas. I have tasted the same item tasting wonderful 1 week  and horrible or bad some other time. 

Rate will be Rs.600 per person with good appetite. Overall, it's a good place for people living nearby with better and slightly expensive or cheaper alternatives available for people around Salt Lake.

It's a place where the IT crowd hangs every now and then (has a bar too). In Axis Mall, it is the best place to eat, and its the only place in Action Area 2 that would do a prompt home delivery. Personally I like the food quite a bit - their Indian fare is very decent and will not burn a hole in your pocket. They also have dirt cheap buffets on weekdays and weekends - a good thing for quick project party arrangers like me. The staff is courteous, warm, knows the menu, makes smart recommendations, and is generous with the condiments (I like). 
The pick of the place for me would be the Achari Tikka. I also recommend Chicken Reshmi Butter Masala, Peas Polao. and Mushroom and Mutter Curry. They also do the mutton well, and the Gulab Jamuns are good too :)

The service is a bit on d slower side, the spread of starters and main course not as elaborate as one would like!! Bt its afterall a budget buffet, so no complaints!! Overall an ok sort of place for a casual buffet dinner!!

This place has a decent atmosphere coupled with budget rate food.
The pricing makes it all the more attractive as the food is at par with the others in Rajarhat area. 
Overall, A nice restaurant for quality food.

The place is nice, reasonably priced and always packed. The waiters are well behaved and their recommendations can be trusted upon. We had chicken lat me kai and and pan fried chilli fish. The fish was so good that we had to order another plate. In the main course we had paneer stuffed kulcha and punjabi chicken. The kulcha was good but he chicken was simply outstanding. It comes in a huge plate and is boneless. Please do have it when you visit this place. We ended with fresh lime sodas. For six people the bill came to be around  2200

This is a bar cum restaurant which also has a small disc inside. Space planning is very haphazard. It could have been done in a better way. Taste of food is highly inconsistent. On best days we had excellent tandoori chicken or chicken tikka. On not so best days we had slightly under cooked pieces of butter chicken. Though it is name Mehak e Punjab but they serve Chinese also. Its highly indianized but nevertheless the taste is good. The good part i that this place is pocket - friendly. The home delivery is also fast.

I visit this place quite often, this time I went to celebrate my birthday. I must tell you awesome food and drink. We ordered martini, masala papad salad, tandoori mushroom, tandoori chicken, masala kulcha and punjabi aaloo dum.
Food tasted fabulous fresh warm. Tandoori was very soft. Aaloo dum blew me away it was so tasty, best I ever tasted. Value for money was good too. But I deducted  1.5 marks for service and ambience it wasn't up to the mark.

We had been there on 01/04/2014 and totally became an April fool of the day. The service timeline of "√Ä la carte" order is horrible taking more than an hour and that is also during a time when the restaurant had hardly any other guests! The kebab platters are so hot and too much spicy that you will fill into tears. The chicken of the biriyani smelled such a bad odor that most of us had to throw that to dustbin. The mutton-burra dish was also very much distasteful because the mutton was not very well cooked and too many spices were used. The amount of biriyani is also not adequate for one person. In my opinion, this restaurant should be avoided for the real foodie guys and also who are conscious of their health.

Mehek e punjab is located at the top floor of Axis Mall.
The decor of the place looks "confused",it has not been put together properly.
I'd have preferred if it was kept simple.

Now comes the main part,food!
I ordered:
1.Chicken tangri kebab.
2.Murg tawewala
3.Tandoori butter roti.

Chicken Tangri kebab dish had two pieces and it was tasty.
Murg tawewala had 4 pieces of chicken (with bone) and it was yum!However the chicken was overcooked.
Tandoori butter roti was good enough.

Price is on the reasonable side.

Next time I'd go to the branch in VIP road.

Price: 3.5/5

Located at the Axis Mall Rajarhat, Newtown along with other popular eateries there on the same floor. This place is basically a bar cum restaurant but they have started a disc beside that too. As per the for the food goes I would recommend to have their Indian dishes specially tandoori items which are really good. The food really contains the punjabi aroma and taste in it. Alcohol is real cheap here so you often get the bar section full and may opt for the family section. Here you get 3 breezers for 90 bucks only but limited to 2 flavors only cola and lemonade, not sure this offer is still available or not.

Initially the ambiance was good but now they have opened a disc beside the bar now you'll get to see a lot of unwanted people roaming around the place which feels quite cheap specially at the time of leaving after having dinner with family. Washroom is a real mess and always found it in bad shape, all wet and dirty. Service is quick and can be considered as good enough.

We had the buffet which didn't have a very large spread but all the entrees were well-cooked and tasty.  It was slightly odd that they had noodles but no non-veg entree to go with it, and peas pulao with no accompanying veg entree!  Overall, not a place to go out to eat, but not a bad place if you're hungray and happen to be in the area.

We went to Mehak-e-Punjab yesterday. Food was really good in quality and quantity also.  We have ordered Chicken Biryani and Dum Aloo Punjabi. Dum Aloo was great but biryani was not upto the mark. Typical Biryani's spicyness and taste was missing. Overall ambiance was really good. Staff was also good and well mannered. I would recommend everyone to visit once.

This chain has been around for a while.Their USP is Punjabi cuisine , albeit they try and rake some Chinese too .During the winters their sarson da saag is well worth a try .The tandoori and kebabs are average and edible.Everything on their menu is very well priced , and for what they charge its well worth it.Taking food away from here maybe a better option than eating here itself because at times things can get a little garrulous .They are consistent with taste and quality.

We had a very bad experience at the restaurant. We had ordered for an office party around Pujas, but the food delivered was pathetic. It was stale . We returned the order and the staff agreed that it was stale but still the behaviour was very arrogant. They were not ready to give any compensation for that and we had literally lost our money ordering the stale food, and the order was huge. So, i'll advice not to go for home delivery.

You have option either to try their food court on 4th floor of Axis Mall or their dark restaurant. Will not recommend eat-in. Food court is the best option. Price for food court is lesser compared to their restaurant menu but quantity will also be lesser. I will recommend parcel option. In non-veg will recommend Kolhapuri Chicken (spicy) and Makhani Chicken (mild). Their home delivery option is pathetic. 

Quantity is good for Chinese menu and feels less for Indian menu. Buffet available 249  tax again the spread will not fascinate you.

Having been there several times on dinners organized by collueges & friends on bitty occasions, I am very much familiar to their menu. Our usual order includes both chinese and north indian stuff. The servings are delicious but the waiters are bit on an ignorant side. During all my visits I noticed the mistakes in the quantity of food/drinks being ordered and those being served. The poor lighting is also a bit of concern for the visitors. Time of delivering the order is acceptable but needs an improvement. Thus, to conclude, I can say that if the mentioned concerns are met then the place can move to the next level of food industry.

We went for a get-together last night, we had starters - Chicken Tandoori and Tengri   
Kebab which were bit ordinary but when it came to main course where we ordered Mehak-e-Punjab special mutton preparation, it was horrible and I never felt smell anywhere like that from the mutton they used and we just couldn't eat.  And the service was very poor too.

Although it is called Mehak-e-Punjab, the place serves both Chinese and Indian food. Located at Axis Mall, the place is great for those who want to have a quiet drink after driving out to Rajarhat. The booze is very reasonably priced, and it can become a place where one can get quite drunk easily. The food on the other hand is actually pretty nice - there are some hits and misses, but overall okay. I actually loved the Chinese segment more than the Indian, but that was just me. They make a very good fish finger and fish tikka, but the biggest issue is probably the service, which, while polite, is quite slow. Good place for takeaway as well, and we enjoyed the chicken chowmien we carried back home. There is a good bit of potential here, and space for improvement.

Today I visited the restaurant with two friends. We ordered for one chicken kabab(6 pcs), two chicken fried rice,one hakka noodle, chicken amritsary and Hunan chicken as side dishes and sweet lime sodas. I didn't like the hunan chicken, it was a very simple preparation, all other were good. Total cost came about Rs. 890/- so it was reasonable. The ambience was just Ok.

The fact that there aren't too many options for dining out in New Town definitely helps this place a lot ! Located in Axis Mall, near the food court, this place doesn't stand out for its ambience. But on the few occasions that I've been here, I've never been terribly disappointed. Service time seems to have improved over time, which is a plus. Last went there a month back....
For Starters we ordered Veg. Hot n Sour Soup, Chicken and Sweet Corn Soup, Fish Tikka and Tandoori Pomfret. While I'm not a fan of soups, the others said that they were fine. The Pomfret tasted nice though I hate dealing with fish bones ! The Fish Tikka was really yummy and probably the best thing in the whole meal.
Then for the Main Course we ordered Chicken Biryani, Veg. Biryani, Plain Naan, Chicken Reshmi Masaala and Mutton Kadhaai. The combination of the Naan and Chicken Reshmi was good. The Chicken was well cooked and flavorsome. The big disappointment was the Chicken Biryani ! Although the quantity was good....It was way too spicy. Whatever happened to Biryani being aromatic and subtle tasting ?! It was a let down.
Hence, while the food is satisfactory, it isn't exceptional. In a city where people know and love their Biryani, Mehak-e-Punjab really needs to do a better job at it. 3.5 stars from me.

This place has just one minus. The distance. Else this place is one of the better wining and dining places in kol. The bar menu reminds you of old oly prices. The vat is included in the prices so no extra hassles for keeping a check on the bill. The ambience is pretty good which better than average for the price they charge and yes you do get tequila out here. The drinks menu is pretty stocked up. But the best thing has to be the food. Both the chinese and indian are equally good. The best two dishes have to be the gravy chicken chowmein and the crispy chilli babycorn. The babycorn is so good that inspite of being a voracious non-vegetarian the only thing I crave for there is the babycorn. The place would have easily got a 5 if they stocked all the beer brands mentioned in the menu.

Too good food to be offered at such prices. The restaurant though not a family or a date kind of ambience provides you with ultimate delicacies. Dal Makhani needs a special mention on my part, as I am a big fan of this one here. There is scope for improvement in the quality but the service and the attitude needs a special appreciation. The guy who runs the place always asks for our reviews when we finish our food whenever we dine there. Would recommend to experience it once.

We had dry chilly chicken, crispy chilli baby corn, chicken tengri kebab, chilli paneer, jeera rice, butter nun, malai kopta and paneer masala, which were pretty good. On the other hand we also had pomfret tandoori, a spicy dish of mutton which were not good. The pomfret was fresh but not roasted properly an the mutton was totally smashed and over boiled. We could hardly get a solid piece. The lassi was ordinary. Service is good.

Visited this place few months ago. First of all the decor and the ambiance will attract any one. We ordered for mutton biriyani and mutton kadai, The food quality is really good and so as the quantity. The biriyani they serve is not dum biriyani but their biriyani has a real good taste. Service is also good bt the staffs are a little bit unprofessional. Whatever over all experience is very good. Lastly it will make u a little more happy as the pocket pinch is not high at all.Have a plan to visit again.

If you are looking to throw a treat or watch a game of cricket with great food and drinks, this can be best choice. Located in Axis Mall, Rajarhat this bar cum restaurant is certainly worth it. 

What the restaurant lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in the quality and quantity of food. The Chicken Tikka Masala had 6 pieces for INR 175 only for crying out loud! And they were really yummy. The food is served hot and fresh, though the clumsiness of waiters might tick you off. 

So, if you are looking to treat your stomach and don't want to burden your pocket Mehak-e-Punjab is your best option.

Probably all the dishes are good with taste and quantity as well.Try tandoori mushroom there
Price was much reasonable earlier but now as it is in demand and has became known one they have  increased the price  but still it is reasonable.

A place you can just have food...they lack the basic concept of flavours n spices...bjt the foid us edible...funny incident-on having being asked about Creme of Mushroom Soup by my chef friend...the Chef of restaurant failed to explain us the concept...overall just an average place...probably just a low end dhaba in a mall!

Visited this place few months ago. First of all the decor and the ambiance will attract any one. We ordered for mutton biriyani and mutton kadai, The food quality is really good and so as the quantity. The biriyani they serve is not dum biriyani but their biriyani has a real good taste. Service is also good bt the staffs are a little bit unprofessional. Whatever over all experience is very good. Lastly it will make u a little more happy as the pocket pinch is not high at all.Have a plan to visit again.

If you are looking to throw a treat or watch a game of cricket with great food and drinks, this can be best choice. Located in Axis Mall, Rajarhat this bar cum restaurant is certainly worth it. 

What the restaurant lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in the quality and quantity of food. The Chicken Tikka Masala had 6 pieces for INR 175 only for crying out loud! And they were really yummy. The food is served hot and fresh, though the clumsiness of waiters might tick you off. 

So, if you are looking to treat your stomach and don't want to burden your pocket Mehak-e-Punjab is your best option.

Mehak-e-Punjab sounded so nice that I could not resist trying it out. Located inside Axis mall Rajarhat, have been to this place thrice and have enjoyed the food on all three occassions. The ambiance is good with a nice decor and decent seating. Love the Dal Makhani here as well as the Paneer and the Aloo Do Pyaza styled veggie. The breads were also good.The Paneer tikka is also tasty. I was surprised by the quantity and quality of food at this place at such modest prices. 
Suggestion: Please improve your service speed. Its an eternity before the food arrives. Furthermore, there's no power backup which frustated the hell out of me on my last visit. The attendants are polite. There's ample parking space outside and inside the mall. You can also catch a movie at Bioscope if you want to. Overall a good place for food.
3.5 stars for Mehak-e-Punjab.

The food is decent. The best point about this restaurant is their free home delivery. I was tired of the callous attitude of Azad Hind Dhaba delivery and found this restaurant to be much better in terms of the responsiveness. The drawback of this place is that the food is too oily and you can see the oil dripping in the dishes. Also the mineral water is super premium, Rs. 50 per bottle.

We had been there with a group of 15. Ordered a lot, but got them in significant less time including starters, main course and appetizers. The Chicken Tandoori items are really well tendered. And in starters, crispy babycorn is simple awesome. I enjoyed a lot. The ambience was awesome with IPL live and nice cool around there. It was a great experience. Looking forward to go there many times again.

The Tandoors and Kebabs were excellent. Price  wise very competitive considering the locality.
I think for larger groups of 10-12 people this should be a good choice.

It is known to me as a value for money restaurant. The price of drinks is not as high as other places, although the ambiance is not as dark as the other niche B&Rs. Have tasted both tandoor and chinese dishes and i preferred the latter. Had hunan chicken with schizwan fried rice last time and the taste was much above par, Kababs are nice to have starters with drinks, although i think they are a bit pricey. Serving and other things were at par, as much as expected from budget restaurants. The only annoying thing there is the TV. It may be helpful for some, but they keep the volume at minimum.

I changed my rating for this place. The food quality has drastically deteriorated. The biriyani was almost inedible. It seems that they have someone like me sitting in their kitchen and trying to improvise dishes on his own. It is not that they do not give the right ingredients, they just do not know how to use it.

been there recently on a friday evening for a drink. the place was buzzing with IT people and i liked the atmosphere with cricket on TV and people enjoying food/drink while watching india's match. cost of food/drinks were reasonable and food tasted very nice. we ordered chili chicken and then fish finger and both were tasting great with our drinks. they had offer going on for one of the drinks that we had and it was very nice. would surely visit again with more friends.
