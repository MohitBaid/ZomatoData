It’s a fun place, and quite literally has mind boggling games! The only turn down is, ALL GAMES ARE CHARGEABLE. Even if it’s a 10min game of foosball.

It’s better to go with a lot of friends/kids if you want to just hangout and do something fruitful.

Food is GOOD! We tried their fish which tasted AMAZING!
Would rate the food 4.5/5
And ambience 3.5/5

Would recommend people to try out this place if you’re a big group of at least 4-5 people. The more, the merrier.

My friends and I wanted to try this café because of it's unique concept. They house a HUGE variety of board games from all corners of the world, some of them very expensive in the market. The playing charges are Rs 100 for the first hour and Rs 50 for every incremental hour.  The staff very dedicatedly help you choose a game to play and explain the rules as well. We played this really fun game called CATAN which has been touted as the "Game of the Century". 

However the food is not at all upto the mark. We ordered Maggi Pakora, Veg Au Gratin, Veg Peri Peri burger, Spaghetti in Roasted Pepper Sauce and Chinese Chopsuey. The Maggi Pakora was tasty and unique, and the Au Gratin had a really thick, creamy, white sauce, and these were my picks of the day. But the spaghetti tasted very bland and none of us liked it. 
The service is extremely slow, our orders took around an hour to arrive. But since one would be engrossed in playing the games, it won't be that big a bother.

A cafe located in Kalighat area. The cafe is not so popular in zomato but it is definitely a good cafe to hangout with friends. Their uniqueness is that they provide an ambience to play board games while hanging out with friends. The food quality is of average category but their quantity is really good. The cafe is running low in space but overall it is a good place to play games while having delicious food with your friends.

Prime location.
Not so good food.
Quantity is good but the taste is not so good.
Grilled Chicken and Charmolata Fish: both the dishes had same flavoured sauce. Mashed potatoes had lot of red chilli flakes and even sauted veggies were full of chilli flakes.
Mushroom A La Kiev was good in taste and was server in a good quantity too!
Crispy Chilli baby corn was not at all crispy!
We were the first customer in the morning, so if this is the quality of the food in the first hour only at 12.05, then I doubt how will be their service in the later part of the day.

We have an option here to enjoy from a wide range of board games, footsal..overall a nice place!

Located just near the Keya Seth's showroom which is in Kalighat, this place is just a mind boggling place for gamers, but mind it, for gamers who loves to spend time on board games. Not one, not two, there are thousands of board games in this beautiful cafe. The food is also too good with mirchi fusion on one side and on the other side with Oreo cookie nutella which simply has just all the three in it. It doesn't end here. There were fried onion rings with an amazing dip and also there is an amazing set of desserts which fall in the group of 'surprise me' and it kind of changes everyday. The other foods were also awesome. Everybody should pay a visit to this super fantastic place, to play and also to taste their delicious food items.

Good food, good interiors, good service but pretty expensive! Costed us around 1000 bucks for a light meal. Portions are much less. Two people cannot share a single dish.
Grilled fish is superb here. Do try it. Pasta with alfredo sauce was good. Lemonade was normal. Coffee on the rocks was an unique experience. People who like black coffee would like it - Iced black coffee with a scoop of icecream
Board games are chargeable. We didn't try it. We had to shell out 1000 bucks only for the food.

We were invited here for a food review. 
And believe me, I was amazed that someone can opened a restaurant not only for food but with an outstanding collection of Board Games.
In this regime of social networks and so called busy lifestyle a child can not think that he/she seats with family members or friends and plays a board game.

Bogglingames comes with a huge collection of board games in their restaurant. Anyone can come and play any of these games.The servicing members here will guide you how to play these games.Most rare collection of games they have.

We had 
1. Triple layer egg chicken sandwich
2. Veg Sheek kebab
3. Baked Fish with Lemon Butter Sauce
4. Oreo Shake

Please visit and enjoy your time with incredible board game.

A board game cum resturent near kalighat tram depot. We choose this for the board game purpose but it chargeable  (Rs.100/person/hour) which should be informed at their page. We ordered cheese ball, jumbo sandwich, veg au-getrin, mixed fruit punch, coffee on the rocks. We like only veg au - getrin, this was good. But in the jambo non veg sandwich is full of onion. I think this is a good creativity if the game will not be chargeable for 1st hour .

If you want to spend a few hours having fun with friends over a few board games, this is absolutely the place. Takes you right back to your childhood. They have trained staff who can explain all the rules needed to play the games. While playing do try out the mushroom a la Kiev! It's heavenly! The Oreo Nutella shake was a bit disappointing, thus the 4 star rating. Other than that it was a complete experience.

This cafe is quite easy to locate and we visited this cafe on Shoshti during Durga Puja. The cafe was empty and we were the only people there. 😊

As the name suggests, they have games there, but for playing the cost is 100 per person.

Coming to the food, we ordered pepper chicken nuggets. This was awsome in taste! 😊

For the main course we had Grilled chicken with herb rice and Chicken Takrai. Both the dishes being part of the main course is quite less in quantity, not even enough for a person with small apetite like me. In terms of taste, grilled chicken was okayish, the flavour of the sauce with the grilled chicken was good. Chicken Takrai had a tangy spicy taste. 😊

Intro: So it was a pre pujo meet up day for us (missus and I) with our friends. We thought about visiting another place, sadly it was closed , so we ended up here.

Location: Located just at the Kalighat stop or rather the previously famous ujjwala cinema stop. 

Ambience: A ground floor, converted into this cafe cum board games parlor. The interiors is pretty basic, with okayish seating arrangements.

Service: I understand people here come for playing the board games , so they don't mind a bit of delay, but the service was exceptionally slow. Took around 45 mins to serve us our order.

Food: we ordered a gg special chicken sandwich, chicken and mayo bruschetta and peri peri nuggets along with cappuccino and tea.
The cappuccino and tea were usual.
The gg special chicken sandwich was okay in taste, nothing special to talk about; double decker sandwich with usual chicken, omelette and veggie fillings served with french fries was kinda heavy.
The bruschetta was a lovely affair; perfectly toasted bread slices topped with chicken morsels and covered by mayo n cheese.
The peri peri chicken nuggets is the usual ready to fry chicken nuggets tossed in peri peri sauce. It tasted spicy and okayish.

Conclusion: it's an okay place, good for kids who like to play board games, but the service is slow and the food isn't extraordinary.

PS: it's about 700 for two people minus the board games' price which is about 100 bux per head.

We bumped into this cafe after a hectic day n was quite satisfied with their service.
It is a fun zone accompanied with interesting board games and amazing preparations.
We started off with the cold coffee. Perfect drink to uplift your mood!
Pasta Alfredo was way too creamy and tasted amazing. Garnished well with mint leaves and extra amount of cheese.
One can spend quality time with friends here playing merrily and having a gala time over amazing food.
My favourites are Pasta and grilled fish with lemon butter sauce.
The platter was served with herb rice(well sauteed with butter) and grilled fishes.
Wish the food was served within expected time :)
Happy weekend folks 🎉

In today’s fast growing world and with the expansion of nuclear families, isn’t it true that we are losing our touch with the old school ways of rejoicing life? About cherishing the little things?
As we are realizing this fact, our city is coming up with new ways of incorporating little tinge of fun along with the bourgeois world. Hence the idea of gaming café is something which has been made popular due to public demand. One such café is “Bogglingames”.
Located in Kalighat adjacent to Keya Seth’s mall, Bogglingames is a special sort of cafe which focuses in the revival of the old school tactics of childhood, that is board games. Once you visit here, you cannot help but admire the super-packed collection of board games covering one entire section of the cafe. The collection of board games vary from different origin covering 80% from European countries, 20% from Japan. Special mention should be made for ancient board games that caught our attention, who’s origin dated way back to the 18th Century India and provided by an NGO “Kreeda”.

Apart from the wide variety of board games, the owner of the cafe Kirti Rathi thought of providing not only a good time but also good food. Our team was welcomed with warm greetings and the staffs were very cordial. One thing which sets Bogglingames apart from other places is that, they have a separate set of employees who make sure to come up to each table and help them in learning and engaging in a new game.
Coming to food, we tried 3 very drinks:

1.Oreo cookie nutella shake
2.Berry blast
3.Mirchi fusion

The oreo cookie nutella shake had a very smooth and rich consistency, however the taste of nutella was not felt much so it somewhat tasted like a normal chocolate shake. Out of these, the berry blast however stands out to be the best and one can go for the mirchi fusion if in a mood for experiment.

After we were done with the drinks, it was time to taste the starters and we went with the chef’s recommendation.

1.G.G  special non-veg sandwich
2.Veg thai seekh kebab

The first dish was served to us along with a crisp platter of fries, some good old ketchup and coleslaw. The G.G special non-veg sandwich consisted of three wholesome layers of vegetables, egg and chicken. And with every bite, all the flavors just mixed perfectly in accordance to our taste bud. For the vegetarians, this menu surely have a perfect alternative as well and that is the veg thai seekh kebab. The beauty of this vegetarian dish is, its complete. Personally we liked it more than the non-veg starter. This dish comes with pieces of veg skewers shape kebab made out of mashed potato, carrots, peas, beans, and sweet corn; along with two dips: peanut dip which was sweet and creamy with a hint of the nut’s crunchiness and another curd based dip with aromatic spices. Along with coleslaw and salad that acted as a palate cleanser too.

For the mains, we were given two dishes. One vegetarian dish and another non vegetarian dish.

1.Pasta aglio e olio
2.Grilled fish with lemon butter sauce

The vegetarian option, which was the pasta dish looked very tempting with a stunning presentation but sadly this was an average dish. Served with two slices of garlic bread with herb seasoning and some grated fettuccine, the dish had a specific dryness. Thus, tasting bland. But, then it was the turn to try out the non vegetarian dish, and without a doubt it was worth it. The grilled fish platter was perfection. The dish comes with a portion of herb rice, mildly stir fried vegetables, two fillets of fish cooked in lemon butter sauce. With the first bite, one falls in love because gluttony is sinful. Isn’t it? Each element summed up to one completeness and we experienced a lip-smacking foodgasm!

Coming to dessert, there was a twist. We were served the “today’s special”. The thing about this particular section of the menu is, everyday there is some specials. For us, it was Lemon creme with cheese and digestive biscuit. This is a very light yet a tasty option, and goes well after enjoying a complete meal. Though the quantity could be improved, there has been made zero compromise with the quality. It maintained a right balance of lemony zest with the flavor of creme cheese and the digestive biscuit layer.

Overall, our experience has been good.

Overall ratings:

Food : 3.5/5Ambience : 4.5/5Service :4.5/5

Cost for two :

Cost for two will be Rs 700 approx.

It is a truly and surpassingly exquisite experience at Bogglingames, entirely one of a kind and offering a vast array of games and dainties to choose from. I cannot possibly recommend this place more highly. Anyone fond of gaming or even of having a mellow, comforting time in general is certain to adore this place. Best place to chill with friends. To top it the food is very refreshing and filling. Burgers and sandwiches are jumbo and very tasty and filling. Greem apple fusion is what inhad in drinks and it was perfect accompaniment to the sandwich.

The ambiance and the decor was nice. The staff are very helpful and helped us learn Catan, which is a rather complicated game. The food was average, but the staff were nice enough to replace one of the pastas for free. All in all, a nice place to enjoy with friends as long as you'll are up for games. Don't count on the food

Amazing place. We were astounded at the variety of board games on offer. We opted to play Catan and had a LOT of fun. Our host was very helpful. Coming to the food, the cheese bruschetta is one of the best I have had. The french fries were very tasty as well. However the nutella milkshake left much to be desired for.
Overall, it was a very fun experience and i am planning to go again and try out other games.

Editing my rating because I love going to this place again and again and again... Visited 4 times already..

Have been wanting to go to the place for so long now. Had heard so much about the place and I wasn't disappointed.
 A gaming cafe that too a board game one, pretty new concept but totally took it to a new level. The no. of games they have is huge. The games boxes I must say was very sophisticated looking, but they hv people they call Game Managers who will make u understand the games. So we played Splendor, Tokaido and Catan. All the games that we played, I never had heard any of the names but they made us understand the games so easily. We tried their Thai Chicken Salad, Peri Peri Chicken Burger and Mushroom a la Kiev along with Berry Blast, Oreo Cookie Nutella Shake and Green Mirchi Fusion and they were so filling and the drinks were just awesome, I can have it everyday. Next we had Pasta Aglio E Olio and Musturd Steamed Fish with Steamed Flavored Rice. It was something unique and we loved it. The Aglio E Olio Pasta was well seasoned and topped with Parmesan cheese. Couldn't try the Grilled Chicken and their mystery item Coffee on the Rocks there, hence got a reason to go back again. And they also hv a dessert section which has a Surprise Me! item in it which makes it 2 reason to go back there. 😝😝 
A great place to hangout, with amazing ambience and great staff members. Thanks and Cheers!!!!

Went here with my five year old. Lost track of time playing various games here. Excellent host who made sure that we understood the games and enjoyed playing it. 

Food- lots of options and customisation available. Tried the arrabiata and garlic bread and liked it. 

Ambience, decor and music- tastefully done interiors which suits a cafe!

Bored at home? Finding it hard to find a perfect place to hangout with your friends in this extremely hot weather? Then you found the best place. 
The concept of scrumptious food with amazing board games is just phenomenal 😍
The ambiance is just perfect for a group to sit, chill, play and eat loads of food. 
We played the game splendor, it was a strategic game and your entire excitement revolves around this part. 
Well! Coming to food we had ordered roasted chicken sandwich and special non veg sandwich. 
Must try this special non veg sandwich which is like 2 decker , one part is veg and the other stuffed with egg and chicken. They serve with french fries. 
This place is worth many visits. 
The staff is really very good. There is the guy who sits in the reception and he explains everything very nicely. 
Loads of food and fun with not much a pocket pinch.

Today as I was walking from Hazra towards Rashbehari Avenue along with my friends, beside mall we noticed Bogglingames, a board game cafe. The name is a little bit different in the first place, so we were are not sure that we can get food or not. But after inquiring & after seeing the menu we decided to have food in this place. Good ambiance, good tasty food. Value for money. cool, neat & clean place.Staffs are also very helpful. We don't hv many this type of good & hygienic food joint. We Ordered 6 snacks Thai Chicken Seekh, mushroom kiev, crispy chilli babycorn along with Oreo Nutella Shake, Mirchi Fusion & berry blast. In mains we took hot garlic fish with burnt garlic non veg. fried rice, pasta aglio e olio, grilled chicken & Mustard fish. Great food but menu is limited. The best part it is a cafe that also a huge collection of Board games. In the duration of order processing times we played some board game with taking help of Ayan ji. It was a really good experience in the cafe. Thank you team member of bogglingames.

It will not be incorrect to state that the   restauranting business is experiencing a sort of revolution . This cafe is a befitting example of how the concept of restaurants is changing in Kolkata. "Boggling Games " is a gaming cafe. It is a place where you can enjoy your food , mocktails and smooties while playing board games. They cafe boasts of an impressive collection of board games from around the world. At weekends there are groups who come over to the cafe to play unique character playing games.
Apart from the games the place serves nice palatable delicacies.
Items I tried:
Classy Lemonade- The quintessential lemonade which provides respite from the sweltering heat.
Coffee on the rocks- coffee with an infusion of ice cream, served in a martini glass. The drink tastes perfect once the ice cream melts.
Mirchi Fusion- A sweet tasting drink with the perfect tang added by the presence of green chilly.
Nachos with Tex Mex - The perfectly made nachos served with Tex Mex and salsa dip
Thai Chicken Sheekh- This is my personal favourite and a must try.
Mushroom A La Kiev -Perfectly flavoured mushroom with a crispy coating.
The chicken Peri Peri Burger is the perfect choice for the Burger fans
Chicken Thai salad - A salad infused with roasted chicken.
Mustard Steamed Fish-The fish comes in a creamy gravy, served with herbed rice and mashed potatoes.
They even serve Pasta Aglio Olio.
I absolutely went ga ga over the perfect dessert.The Mango popsicle is sure to win hearts.
Location- Beside Keya Seth's showroom in Kalighat
Prices- All the items are very reasonably priced.           

During this summer holidays, this will prove to be the best choice for both mothers and kids.

Impressive to see new thought processes coming into restauranting. This is a gaming cafe.. Where they stock games from 5 years and above.  Their board games collection is enviable having pieces from all over the world. 
On a hot summer afternoon along with some forgotten old Indian board games as well as German boards games...  We tried the really good Classic Lemonade with a hint of black salt which was served in a masons jar.  The other drink which I loved was Berry Blast.  The Mirchi Fusion was interesting too. 
We also tried the Thai Chicken Seekh which the kids too Will love as its not spicy.  I loved the fresh and colourful Chicken Thai Salad and also the Nachos.  The fish with lemon butter sauce was OK.  The pop pick?  The Mango Popsicle with mango pulp,  hung curd and a whipped cream. 
If you are looking for fun and food...  Drop in.

Bogglingames cafe boasts of being the first board gaming cafe in town, and rightly so! This cute little place is located on the ground floor of a building. They have a parking right in front of their door. The owner is a delight to talk to! Her 4 year old daughter is her inspiration to start this - conceptualise this. Why? Because she would find it difficult to distract her daughter from digital media hence it took a lot of effort to distract her from there to her love for board games. 

The place caters to an audience of all groups - they have games starting from the 5+ range. Award winning games are proudly acquired and showcased here. They have annual unlimited gaming membership programs as well. They charge 100 rupees per hour for playing their board games, an additional 50 rupees is charged beyond that one hour slab.

Also, in case your food bill is over 500 rupees, you get 2 hours of gaming complimentary.

The cafe specialises in board games, and also good food. Kirti recently along with the chef's help decided on a lovely food menu, perfectly suited for the summers.

Mocktails - Our pick :

1. Classy Lemonade: For the freshness of the drink. The fizz is evident and gives us the much needed refreshed kick. Served in a mason jar.

2. Coffee on the Rocks - For all the coffee lovers out there. A strong black coffee is served in a fine glass, with a dollop of ice cream. For the brave hearts I tell you.

3. Mirchi Fusion: You savour it the more when you allow the drink to settle down.  
You must order -

1. Nachos with Tex Mex: Nachos with a twist! Chef special tex mex accompanied the dish, and a fiery salsa dip to go with it! Dip the already loaded nachos and you are set with a drink, and a board game!

2. Thai Chicken Sheekh served with a peanut dip: Succulent sheeks loaded with spices, and peanuts, has a sweet taste to it but highly recommended. 

3. Chicken Peri Peri Burger served with fries on the side, is a very filling burger, and is not at all dry! The patty is thick, and makes you realise you're actually eating a burger!

4. Chicken Thai Salad: Fresh, crunchy, spicy, colorful. The salad is a visual delight. The peppers, onions, chicken, dressings - a perfect summer salad!

5. Mustard Steamed Fish; My favorite from their menu, the fish was perfectly spiced and steamed. The rice was flavoured with saffron and almost flowed onto the combination. Excellent dish.

6. Mango Popsicle - Names like popsicle but not like  a popsicle. The bottom most layer is a mango pulp, followed by hung curd flavored with mango and finally whipped cream. Nicely set, the perfect dessert.

All in all, a perfect place for food and games. This one's a welcome delight from the other gaming cafes so far because of their variety and innovation.

Had heard about the place through friends and wanted to take kids to this latest zone. Nice place for all age groups.Kids we're overjoyed to find so many options to play.Very helpful staffs.They we're there to help the kids with minute details too.They really need to improve upon the food. Rather the quality is weak.I had to give my cold coffee back once as it was room temperature and again for it being too bland .Overall they should concentrate more upon the food as rest has been taken care of.!!!

Been here last month!  This place is located near the keya seth mall!  The place is big as compared to other hangout spots!  They do have immense no.  of board games! Worth a shot to try.  The only thing tht disappointed was the food they served.  They did make a gimmicky menu card but the amount they served is too less compared to price.

Landed up to this place for the bloggers meet. A very new concept the owners have come up with. Though its a bit too challenging for them where food joints are doing extremely well. Its not only about food here its more than food. The name itself gives you an idea that it is completely related with games. And you heard it correct they have over 150+ indoor table and board games which you can play here with your companions. The food is standing at the back complementing the gamers for their hungry tummy. The ambiance is all decorated with gaming environment with the photo frames are too relevant to the place. 
Tried few of the mocktails here. The first set of mocktail was a little turn of but you always find a diamond in the coal, the cranberry mocktail was fabulous. 
In the food section we had some delicious momo platter followed by shaky drinks and Crispy baby corn with the dips.  Continued with more of their dishes which were absolutely well done in forms of egg poach, rice and bacon sandwich. 
Later we tried few of their board games which was truly very interesting to play with the people present. An hour passed and i was wondering how it happened. 
Finishing things of with two type of desserts on the table those were pretty decent in taste. 
Overall if you are looking to have a fun time with friends and family with some indoor games then you should visit here once for sure. I hope the much i liked playing the games you will like it more for sure. They also have a combo of games and food as well to make things even fruitfull for you. 
Lastly the service part was very good and i was very happy with it, most importantly all the staffs are well trained and well associated with all the games.
I wish Team Boggling games all the best and wish they come up with more of those games. Cheers!

Well loved the place, most importantly loved the idea of games with food. Played games such as Battleship, Ticket To Ride, Chess etc.
There is a downside they charge individually for the games so 100* star means if I take 4 people with me its going to be ( 100×4 = 400) , I have no problem even if they charge like this but it should be clearly mentioned in the menu. The owners and their employees were extremely friendly a huge plus side indeed when interacting with customers.

Coming to the food, we went for Fish Momos, Fish & Chips, Nuggets Of Tandoor and Green Chilli Fusion.
All the items were nice and tasty.
All the best to the management!
