Came to have a Samosa here. Little store very close to College Street Bata on Keshab Ch Road. We took a samosa which costed Rs.4 and it was average in taste.
Then had the very popular Joy Nagar's Moya which again costed Rs.4 and was good.

This Sweet Shop at Keshab Chandra Sen Street is pretty old & you will found this shop empty every time. With no decorations & no special sweets it attracts very less people. However small sittings are available inside the shop to have their food over there.

They serve very below average quality sweets & very less variants are available compared to nearby Laxmi & Ghosh sweet shops. The serve Puris too but only at morning times & they are again average. Prices are low but you doesn't get much for that either.

If you aren't set on budget then visiting nearby Shree Laxmi Mistanna Bhandar will be better option than this.
