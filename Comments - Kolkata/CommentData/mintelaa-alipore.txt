Visit this place for an extremely friendly and mannered staff. The food is extremely satisfying(i ordered a chilly babycorn and a mix sauce pasta). Entertain yourself with a collection of board games, live pizza counter and more. And yes, they make perfect shishas. :)

The food is okay. Shisha can be better, smoke too less. Ambience is nice, cozy and comfortable. Hookah section is claustrophobic. Not worth the visit second time. Everything is copied from chaibreak. Nothing new about the place
