Went only once and discovered that can not dine in. Ambience is not satisfactory at all. AC doesn't work. One person somehow managing all the works as receiving calls for delivery, taking orders, trying to fix unstable table, serving our orders, feeding a fish in an aquarium and before serving food he had disappeared for so long as we doubt that he was the cook too. Taste and quantity of so called Chinese food brought so little relief at least.

Went for some evening snacks last weekend!
The restaurant was small and a bit clumsy!
Difficult to locate too..

We ordered Bon Bon Chicken, Chicken Sweet Corn Soup, Dry Chilli Baby Corn, Chicken spring rolls and Egg Gravy Noodles!
The taste was good but the service was slow!
They r actually more interested about the home delivery orders!

This place will have you confused for a while when you're trying to get there for the first time. There's a small alley next to 'Blue Bubble' which leads directly to the place, and surprisingly enough it's empty during lunch hours. I say surprising because Mom's Green Chilli is an absolute dream for budget eaters and Chinese enthusiasts. Very few places in Kolkata will provide the amount they do, at the price they're willing to do it for. 

What Green Chilli does best is in-restaurant PR. The man who served us the food was an absolute gem. He recommended trying out the Chilli Chicken (his speciality as he puts it). He seemed to also cook the food, which was particularly impressive. An absolute delight, his service itself made me contemplate a second visit.

The interiors are very standard. Chairs and Sofa Chairs for seating, with glass top tables. Thankfully, the air conditioner works fine. There is a slight space problem, but that wasn't very evident. The Cutlery was clean, and so was the crockery. Nothing seemed out of place. Very clean, very comfortable.

The food was absolutely top notch. We ordered - the Mixed Hakka Chow, Honey Duck and the Chilli Chicken. The Chow was standard chow, nothing sensational. The Duck was very good, bursting with flavour and thankfully, not excessively sweet. The Chilli Chicken was gorgeous. Food is where Mom's Green Chilli redeems itself, if there was anything to redeem at all. The portions are massive! Definitely one to frequent.

To summarize, Green Chilli combines the best of both worlds -- good food and extreme value for money.

Tricky place to locate that's for sure. You can find this place near Kuoni SOTC office.  Ambience was cool but not so great. To be honest I thought the food would be average but my oh my i was totally wrong , went for Mixed Hakka Noodles and Hongkong Chicken both the items were exquisite in taste. Overall a pretty good experience.

Totally exhausted after a long and tiresome day,we were around sector 1 and was seeking for an easy-on-pockets restaurant,when zomato helped us out and hence we came up with the decision to drop in here. First of all the place attracted me with its name---mom's green chilli! To everybody's awareness and to every person,the best chef in the world are their mothers. So i was waiting for something really delicious to bite on. Totally unaware of its location,we called them up and they did their job perfectly well to guide us to their place. It was around 7pm when we entered and even in the late evening the place was totally empty and we were their only customers there.

The place has a mediocre sized aquarium with only one but very large fish(pic has been uploaded) which was really beautiful and really attracted me. The silky white color of the fish was something that i laid my eyes on for nearly 10 mins. Adjacent to that lied a big statue of the lord ganesha. The piece was done beautifully and it enhanced the beauty of the place to an unmeasurable extent.
The restaurant wasn't highly spaced but wasn't cramped even. Tables along with big red couches provided immense comfort for us to dine in. The air conditioner was doing its job well. The dim lights added to the soothing ambience.

We were served cold water as soon as we were seated. We decided our pick but the guy attending us seemed very less thorough with the menu and wasn't able to answer our queries properly so the manager took over his part and helped us out. We ordered 1 chicken fried rice and 1 plate garlic chicken.

Food was served fast and was piping hot. The fried rice had ample amount to fill up the appetite of 2 people. It was well done with chicken pieces and eggs and the flavor and aroma was really impressive. The chicken side dish had 10 pieces chicken which was enough for 2 people and it was also done beautifully and the gravy tasted awesome. The whole meal was worth every penny.

The place is very well maintained and the only guy serving there attended to us really well whenever we needed assistance. The food was done perfectly,though i think the place needs a little advertising. Overall the place is highly recommended if a budget friendly restaurant with good ambience and food is on crave.

Situated in a quiet lane at Salt Lake, it may be a bit hard to find if you do not know your way around. Let me start with the directions. If you are coming from City Centre towards CA Island, take the last lane to your left falling just before the round island and after you enter take a right turn.

Else, simply take a left turn from CA Island and going towards Vidyasagar Island (Bidhan Nagar College), take the first lane to your left and then another left turn.

This small restaurant is placed in the ground floor of a residential house and thus has that homely feel. The decor and ambiance is nothing special or extraordinary but plain and simple. Coming to the food, I had ordered for a Mixed Noodles (Hakka), Kung Pao Chicken and Chilli Garlic Fish. The noodle was decent but a bit on the dryish side lacking flavor. The Chicken was disappointing as well unlike one of the reviews posted here. It seemed, someone had simply microwaved it to heat it up. However, the fish was just lipsmackingly delicious. I guessed it was freshly prepared and had quite some taste in it.

The quantity was sufficient to fill up the appetite. The waiters seemed a bit on the slow-ish side lacking professional courtesy but one cannot expect much from a novice restaurant.

I visited this place with my family and had tried out a few things. Since I am not a chinese food lover, so I try to stick to my same set of menu for eating. I dunn try out to much of the chinese stuffs.
We had ordered crispy chilli baby corn for our starter. Really good taste and suffecient quantity for 2 people. They made it fresh and had served it hot. Really nice.
In the main course we had ordered for Chicken Hakka Noodles, Veg. Fried Rice, Schezwan Chicken and chilli chicken. All the food items were huge in quantity and great in taste. Really loved it all.
Now when you come to the service, it is little weak in terms of the delivery of the food. Try and visit this place. Its nice to dine out. :)

Small and decent place. Have been to this place recently in one early evening, so haven't experienced any crowd. It is located at the ground floor of a house, so basically not a huge place. Have seats for almost 15 people, but not congested. One can have a meal comfortably enough. Nothing very fancy about the ambiance, few wall paintings, an aquarium and some English folk music, was a good to go with Chinese meal.

We had ordered Kung pao chicken, Chicken Manchurian along with Mixed fried rice and mixed noodles. Rice and noodles both were good, but prawns were nearly invisible within. Chicken Manchurian was also great, but kung pao was the best pick, it was really tasty.

Service was alright, didn't take much time for the food to arrive, neither we found any glitch. Last but not at all the least, prices are very reasonable, smooth with our pockets! :)

Have ordered a few times from here usually stick to my favorites. The Chinese food here is fresh and always very prompt in delivery . Not brilliant in taste but way better than many places offering delivery inside Salt Lake 

Coming to the food : 

The Sichuan Nodles ( gravy ) ... if you order one of these ... you will be full. The portion size is huge and the noodles are yummy. The only local joint that put pak choi in the noodles 

The Honey chicken and the garlic chicken are both nice and they also make a fairly decent Paneer Manchurian . They even make nice haka noodles . 


Advice : do not order momos the skin is not very nice

Rated 5, why? Here's the reasons:
1) Fantastic food, and extremely cheap compared to others serving same quality.
2) Quantity of food is huge, love it.
3) Friendly staff. They try to take care of the visitors as much as they can.

Mostly people DON'T like this place for the following reasons:
1) Homely atmosphere, not everyone likes a restaurant to be like this.
2) Staff are not suave, but they are well mannered. They might not know the "style", but they surely want you at "home".
3) Not a broad bandwidth of the menu. 
4) Not a big place, but it's very calm and quite.

Bottom line: If you want a calm environment where you would love to spend some time with quality food at a damn cheap rate, this place is for you. If you are used to in 3+ star etiquette, you won't like this place.

I went to Green Chilli a few days ago... it was a slight pain to find the place, because I am not much into Salt lake and so this places needed time to be found. And once you get there, the seating arrangement is small, so you might have to wait. thankfully, most of the people opt for takeaway, and does not do a sit-down. The menu is nice and predictable and reasonably priced. We were hungry, so ordered the American Chopsuey and the Chicken Momos. 

Here is what I noted soon after. The waiter did not give us water for nearly 10 minutes, and the manager did not notice it. He was busy taking phone orders for 4-5 minutes, but even after that, he did not notice our empty glasses.

The food came in together, although we had asked for the Momos to be given first and then the Chopsuey. The Momos were nice, but soggy, which was the reason I switched my attention to the Chopsuey. That was a batch of steaming hot noodles, served with a tomato sauce on top, and in our case, nearly drowned in sweet tomato sauce. I did not like the overly sweet sauce. 

The bill was very reasonable, and I have been told that they have a lot of other dishes which are good. However, the inattentive service and slowness did nothing to endear them to me.

A stone's throw away from home, Green Chilli is a really good Chinese food outlet in salt lake. However, I have a major complaint about the place. 
I've had food ordered here a couple of times now, and the quality of food has been really good.
I'd especially recommend trying their Mei Foon (rice noodles), and even their momos with clear soup. The food is a LOT in quantity, yet you can safely gobble it all up without putting your tummy through too much of an upset. 
A plus point here is they send you free prawn chips and omelettes with the Chinese dishes you order.
The only negative (and thoroughly  disappointing) point I've found is from the staff's side. 2 of the times we've ordered, they've misled us on the prices. Both the times, the delivery guy came and said that prices are more than what they confirmed on the phone. Unless I see a change there, I'm not ordering from here again.

GREEN CHILLI - DOES NOT LIVE UP TO ITS NAME - 2 OUT OF 5.

Green Chilli in Salt Lake is best known for its Chinese delicacies and nothing else. Few people know that their north Indian preparations are also mouthwatering. The quantity and quality of food from this joint will definitely leave a lasting impression in your mind. The joint is simple looking with cozy and comfortable sitting arrangements though their service can be bothersome at times. Their north Indian fare is light on the stomach without being too spicy. The Chinese food, however, is fresh.  It is not bland as well as non spicy and non oily. The taste, quality and quantity are always the same with Green Chilli.

The noodle and rice preparations are not only scrumptious but are non greasy as well. The noodles are soft, thin and light. Their chicken preparations are succulent and full of flavours. Some of the popular chicken preparations (namely Chilli Chicken and Manchurian chicken) go really well with many of their rice and noodle staples. 

The soups served by them are good. They have a strong flavour and are aromatic as well. This is especially true of their Thai soup and chicken hot and sour soup both of which I particularly enjoyed. Both the soups are mildly hot with seasoning at the right place. The hot and sour soup with its mushrooms, tofu and chicken meat, is bound to bring a wide smile to your face. The Thai soup, on the other hand, has the right balance of sweetness, sourness, saltiness and spiciness.

Coming to their Indian fare, the biryanis and mutton and chicken dishes are acceptable and palatable though good biryani and kebabs are probably best had from the many popular Mughlai joints that dot the area. Skip the North Indian and have the Chinese fare here as the place is good for occasional visits, and you do get really genuine and authentic delicacies at good prices here.

It is the most cheaper and tastier restaurant in Saltlake.It is fully air conditioned.Home delivery is also free,but it takes alot of time to serve.All over it is quite good.In fried rice it gives many veg. including babycorn.There is a big aquarium.All types of food we can get here-Indian,Chinese,Biriany,Chopsuey,etc.It is quite clean.It dosent adds too much spices which are harmful for health.Once in a week we can have it.
All together ,it is amazing.

The price is very cheap, with soups starting from 50 rupees, rice/ noodles at 65 rupees which can be easily shared with another person.
Quantity and quality of food is very good.
My personal favourite is Chilli Fish, Chicken Manchurian, Fried Rice and the Prawn recipes.

Regarding Price.....It is not the same as mentioned here....prices/dish are around Rs 90-100.

Overall experience is good. When you are in a nearby locality, it could be a good option to have Chinese.
