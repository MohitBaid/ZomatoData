Shabby shop with not much variety of sweets. The rosogollas are good but I tried their kaju barfis which doesn't have any hint of the nut in them. This pne is located near the Bangur super market. However the prices are cheap.

One of the oldest sweet shop of bangur area. You find them on the left side near the bangur super market while entering bangur from VIP road. They make fresh sweets at a very reasonable price and that's really commendable at a location like bangur. Specially I would give them the credit for competing with big brands in the area which started up very recently. Well done !! :)
