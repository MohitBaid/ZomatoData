It’s been few months that this shop started. Located in Sealdah near Jharna Ghee. They sell a wide range of Mughal food. Their biriyani is something like a must try, not at all spicy. Even the firni that they serve is wow. Their home delivery service is on point. Must try their yum food and it’s absolutely pocket friendly.
