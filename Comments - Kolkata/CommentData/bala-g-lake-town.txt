Price is average.

Located on the ground floor of the Amway office near VIP LakeTown, this spacious vegetarian eatery is where we went for snacking one evening.
The delicious chhole bature perfectly relieved the famished souls though the quantity of chhole could have been more.
The pav bhaji wasn't satisfactory at all. They provided extra bhaji for no added cost though we'd asked if we could get extra chhole.
The crispy chilli potato was quite tasty.
Overall, a pocket friendly place!

A nice veg restaurant located near the Big Ben in Lake Town, Bala G served us the most delicious Masala Dosa and Pav Bhaji we ever had.

I had an experience which can never be forgotten. The place is pretty decent and a family restraunt. Pure veg has its perks also. But unfortunately the management here is the worst possible. On a Saturday night, when there is good enough crowd I expect a waiting but not as long the one I faced. Also 4 families does not even pass as crowded.We ordered a tandoori alu for starters and waiter told us it would take 10-15 minutes , which of course was okay with us. After half an hour of ordering the food and waiting we called the waiter to ask what's the situation. He told us alu would take long. We were surprised. We asked him to bring in the main course then. After another waiting of 20 minutes there was no sign of anything and not even an update. We decided to walk out as it was already 10 and neither did any waiter came to tell it would take more time and even ignored when we asked. After we started to walk out, none of them bothered to even have the courtsey to atleast ask what was the issue even after we had ordered. So basically the service and the behaviour was worse than any other eatery I have ever been to. Do not think of visiting this place if you wish to enjoy the experience.

A pocket friendly restaurant in lake town area ,food quality is good with adequate food quantity, crispy chilli babycorn was just awesome,in the main course we  ordered dal makhani and panner lababdar, paneer was very good but dal was ok not up to the mark, in breads don't order cheese nan as they just grate the cheese on a butter nan, so instead of ordering it order butter nan and you will be more happy.. hospitality and cleanliness is poor, needs urgent improvement as their is lack of coordination among the staff and dirty floors ..
If it gets improved then this outlet will rock..!! 
Cheers..!!

Bala G located in canal street doesn't look really like a restaurant on the outside but its a really large one. The decor and the ambiance is really nice, comfortable and spacious. Cleanliness is really well maintained here, though I would not recommend the washroom on this regard.
The staff is really friendly and up to the mark.
Coming to the food, its really delicious with great quantities on their really pocket-friendly. Its a great place, if you have a great appetite and wish to go easy pn your pocket. We had crispy chilly babycorn, mixed fried rice, dal makhani, kadai paneer and naan. The baby corn were a bit too crunchy but tasty and rest were spot on and delicious. We ( we were two people) could not finish all this and had to pack it and take it home to enjoy it again.

It was a really great experience and will surely come back again.
