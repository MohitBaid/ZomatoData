People usually come here for breakfast in their cars because there isn't any seating arrangement. This place offers a variety of sandwiches and dosas. You can also savour it with lassi and tea/coffee. My favorite is the Cheese Chilly sandwich . However I have also tried their cheese corn sandwich and Paneer sandwich which are pretty decent. The cheese masala dosa is something you can dig into. It's yummy. It costed around 500 for 6 people. 
We had ordered 
One Cheese Chilly sandwich 
Two Cheese Corn sandwich 
One Paneer sandwich 
Two Cheese Masala dosa 
Two tea
One lassi
Definitely worth it.

Yum malai toast, corn and cheese toast, aloo sandwich and tea.
Only minus point is lack of seating arrangement and parking space (specially early morning).

Tea here is ðŸ’“. The malai toast, the cheese toast and the cheese corn sandwich of this stall are what you can have cravings anytime. This outlet is an exemption to the rule that you get bored of a particular place after some visits. 

Frequency of visits is 3-4 days a week for the last 4 years. I can conclude that its the best tea available in town. Cheese corn Sandwich is what I can have daily, the other option worth mentioning is panner sandwich. The malai toast goes well with the tea.

Come here for breakfast, lunch or evening snack or anytime you wanna have long talks. The only thing this place lacks is consistency, one day you get 2x of cheese in the sandwich and another day(generally few ones) you get half the cheese.

This morning I have gone to this tea stall to have my morning tiffin...I ordered none other than Kolkata famous malai toast. It's a great cool morning for me. This Saturday I'm going again here and this time I will enjoy their sandwich.

This is a local tea stall located right under Kolkata Stock Exchange on Lyons Range Street.
Park your Car around and the waiter would come right upto your window to take your order. 
Tea with Masala Toast & Cheese and Corn toast are a must have.

This is a perfect place for some light breakfast or mid day snack. Recommended visit over weekends until 11-12 in the morning or Weekdays till 10AM to avoid rush hours.

If you're looking for some roadside delicious sandwiches and tea, then this is a renowned destination! Was there with a few friends and tried different sandwiches like the mushroom, corn, paneer, cheese, aloo! They were all lip smacking. The tea was great. We get good quality and quantity at reasonable rates here! Perfect spot for a Sunday breakfast with friends! =)
