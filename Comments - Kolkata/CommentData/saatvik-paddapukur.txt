The ambience is pretty good. The service was fine as well, considering it was a packed Sunday. Coming to the most important factor, the food - it was delicious. We were a group of 20 people. Not a single person had any issues with the food. The food seems slightly heavy, but the taste and the quantity are fairly impressive. Good job!

Do not go by the name. Name (Saatvik) suggests no onion no garlic but not in this case as all food preparation are filled with it. Probably the meaning of Saatvik is not known to the management

Was in Kolkata recently, and we were planning a family dinner.

My sister who works there suggested this place. The place was crowded but we managed to find a table for the 5 of us.

We ordered Paneer Tikka Zafrani and it tasted brilliant but loved their Crispy Chilli Baby Corn more!

For main course we ordered their yellow dal it was one of the best I had ever eaten. Their paneer butter masala was great too and both of these tasted good with the garlic naan.

Ordered jeera rice to end the meal.

Cost was 2000 for 5. Totally worth it!

A place to go to if you are a vegetarian.....
Ambience: well, what does one say, the decor is decent enough,but, since there were many women's groups it became extremely noisy.....
Food was good. Some items were delicious while others were well good. We had the tomato soup, which though slightly sweet was to my taste. The veg aprica was delicious. The tandoori aaloo was good. In the mains the lachha paratha and stuffed kulcha with jalfrazie and stuffed paneer made for a great meal.....
The service was good....
Happy with the place..

Was here on Sunday afternoon with my frnds.. booked in advance the table as weekends are generally crowded! Good decor once you get in but we had horrible experience...! There were private lunch &kitty party ladies and the entire place was booked with only handful available for outside ppl.. It ws vry noisy too... Seeing crowd we understood that food would take time & did it take lot of time!! Starters & soup took 45 mins aftr repeated follows up!!

Now the only good point was food due to which we were there ..

In starters we ordered manchau soup, panner 65, veg aprica which was good..

For main course we had ordered stuffed paneer.. masala kulcha& Mongolian Rice...

For drinkers we had coconut mint drink & evergreen sweet lime soda..

Coconut drink ws good if you enjy coconut flavour more of on milky side as mint ws vry less! 

Food was good but the noisy ambience made it bad experience..

This relatively new pure veg family diner is 10 mins from my house . Was planning to visit someday and we finally reserved our table for a Navami dinner this Puja .

We reached , the gatekeeper opened the gates to a lavish restaurant with beautiful lighting and attractive interiors . The ambience was perfect . We were escorted to our table by the manager which comfortable sofas and chairs . We were given the Navratri Special Menu . We ordered a mocktail which was kind of ok . But following that everything was good .

The Paneer Tikka kesarwala was something I tried for the first time and liked it .

Coming to the mains ,

Stuffed Paneer Masala had nothing new to offer . Just the regular Paneer Butter but stuffed with mashed veggies .

Matar Methi Malai was good but again nothing different or better than what we get at other restaurants in the area .

Coming to the breads ,

The Masala Kulcha was nice . Stuffings were generous and was perfectly prepared .
The Tandoori Rotis disappointed a bit . It was too crunchy for a roti . Tasted like a thick papad .

The Burnt Garlic Fried Rice was my favourite that day . Had a tinge of uniqueness and was full of flavours .

Food was good . Service was better . But the main drawback would be the pricing . The pocket pinch is high , actually quite high , taking into consideration that you are not dining in a fine dining restaurant . Yes , they don't charge you GST as of now but the prices in the menu seems more than what others charge even after applying GST . This sure needs to be taken seriously when you are a new property .

Pocket Pinch : 1500 for 2 ( full course meal )

Saatvik! The name resemblance to Goddess Durga. Anyways, this outlet is just behind Paddapukur Swimming Pool from Sarat Bose Road. Decoration is so pleasant that after entering it feels like a peace in the mind! Coming to food, corn cheese kabab as starter is pretty good as well as crispy baby corn (we requested it less spicy). Three mock tales Colour of Love, Mint Mango & Coconut Mint are very nice to accompany with main course. Nargisi Kofta & Garlic nun were just the perfect to accomplish our dinner out there. Staffs are very courteous. Overall a nice experience.

The taste buds need bit more tingy and spicy.
Veg Lattica was blend, wherein I had expected it to be spicy.
Over all, it's a nice place with courteous and gleeful employees.
Cost for 7 people, 2100.
BTW, the part is that they do not have taxes. A plus point. :-)😋🤗

The only word that can describe my experience here is Pathetic!
I went with my family for dinner on a sunday.Reservations were made beforehand.The only positive thing about the whole experience was atleast the place didn't look dark and shady.For starters we ordered Manchow soup,Sweet corn soup,Corn cheese kebab and Paneer Zaffrani.The starters were average but the dip provided with the starters was so spicy that we couldn't have it(We generally like spicy food). They tried correcting it but in vain.We had a wait for a good 30-35 minutes after placing our order for main course.My nephew,who is just 2 years old was with us and was supposed to have rice and daal that we had ordered.We kept on telling the staff to atleast serve those two dishes for the kid but they couldn't do that also.However we noticed that tables with more guest who even arrived after us were being served very promptly.There was nothing  good about the main course,not even a single thing was even average. We are definitely not going there again because even though the food is cheap,the quality of the food is below par.

A good pure vegetarian restaurant with a reasonably priced menu. Must go for veg lovers. The 'Maa ki Dal' is a very innovative dish and the kesaria kulfi is also a must try.

This newly opened place near Bhawanipore, is a food paradise for vegans. But I would suggest non-vegans should absolutely give this place a try. The ambiance, hospitality is really good. If you are a cheese lover then their Fusion steak should definitely be on your try-list. Their waldorf salad is excellent. The delicacies range from Continental, oriental to Indian nd many more.. So this weekend, food lovers should definitely try out this new place.

So it was my Birthday and I was here with my friends for lunch on a Sunday. And I would say I was so disappointed with the food & service, that I have added it into my 'Never-to-go-again places list'. I had made the booking of table for 8 a day before, but when I reached I was told that there was no reserved table and we had to wait for 15 minutes to get a table.
That was not all. The starters course took 25 minutes to come even when the crowd was not so much. Crispy Chilly Babycorn was okayish. Chinese Bhel was an insult to its name. Too much sweet with no spicy flavours, it had a bland taste.
Next we ordered Hakka Noodles and Vegetables in Garlic sauce. The noodles were more like chowmein. Fried Rice was fine.
The major drawback is that they provide pure Jain food only. So even in Babycorn, there were no onion and garlic. The service is too poor. Nobody listens & we had to ask for anything 3-4 times for it to get it. I came here for a new experience and had expectations since it has replaced Spice Ocean, but I was really disappointed.

This is located on the edge of paddapukur crossing, the place where Spice Ocean was situated.
This is a pure veg family restaurant. The food here is very average nothing exceptional. I would not like to go here once again. I had gone on a Sunday and the service was a little slow.

This restaurant has an elaborate menu for a vegetarian restaurant. The service also is friendly. I had the masala kulcha which was reasonably good. The Nargisi kofta was soft and tasty and did not have the creamy heaviness which is found in most restaurants. It had a natural flavour. The mocktail was also interesting. The food is not exceptional, but quite good. The restaurant is an interesting option for vegetarians.

Saatvik, located on 1C Madhav Chatterjee Lane, is a restaurant that is 100% vegetarian.
The place has a great ambience with fast service. The staff is friendly and efficient.
The restaurant offers Indian, Oriental and Continental. They offer a variety of mocktails to choose from. The mocktail, Colour of Love, for 135 had a fruity taste which leaves your taste buds satisfied. The pasta is excellent and for those who prefer Indian the Paneer Butter Masala and the Dal Makhani leave you wanting more.
The quality and the quantity is satisfactory and isn't too heavy on the pocket either.
The ambience will make you love the food more.

Saatvik - Pure For Sure ,Veg Restaurant is tucked in a small road off the main Sarat Bose Road, Near Poddopukur Swimming Club...The atmosphere and Cuisine is simply beautiful. Background music is also based on Saatvik style.. You won't be feeling heavy after having the food of Saatvik.. Less oil, less masalas and a unique style of cooking are the main key features of this veg family restaurant...Ideal place for your parents to bring here ... Opening time is 12:30 pm and the last order time is 10:45 pm.
Super personal service will surely make you happy and homely feeling....
You will get here Pure Vegetarian food (Indian,Tandoor,Oriental, Continental) along with No Onion No Garlic and Jain preparation....

I was extremely pleased to visit this newly opened place. Had a good time. A must try starter is Crispy Chilli Baby Corn. Moreover, the prices are all inclusive. First, I thought that the items are overpriced but it was later that I realized that the items are decently priced as they are inclusive of all taxes. Go ahead and enjoy good food over here. Also, the infrastructure is quite good. Cheers.
