Located near Gariahat, this restaurant has nice decor ,great ambiance and quite spacious. I went there last week to have dinner with my family. We ordered:
1. Red pepper fish: fried pieces of fish prepared with red pepper.
2. Chilli garlic squid: fried squid prepared with chilli garlic sauce.
3. Chicken singapore noodles: different kind of preparation, liked it. 
4. Korean fried rice: Korean style fried rice served with veggies.
5. Schezwan chicken: the usual preparation of schezwan chicken, but it wasn't that spicy.
6. Sweet and sour prawn: this dish turned out to be very sweet , didn't like it much.
Courteous staff and prompt service. Nice place to have dinner or lunch with family or friends.

Krystal chopsticks was ticked off my bucketlist this afternoon when i finally got to visit this place with my mom . Hungry and tired from shopping, we opted for main course directly and ordered chicken fried rice and the much reputed chicken with red wine . Chicken fried rice was well- cooked and red wine chicken was truly commendable... it had in total 8 pieces of boneless chicken in sweet n spicy gravy ,rather a bit tangy one . I liked the dish very much. In desserts we ordered vanilla with chocolate sauce and butterscotch icecreams . The restaurant is very much spacious , decently decorated and can almost accommodate 40-50 people at a time . So , to end with visiting Krystal chopstick turned out to be a good decision indeed.üëå

Kolkata is famous for its Indo Chinese offerings and you will find hundreds of restaurants offering their versions across the city. Krystal Chopsticks is one of those restaurants which I have seen while growing up and which I know to offer decent varieties of the quintessential Chilly Chicken and Chicken Chow. I have been there a number of times, with family and friends and the restaurant is a hit with all age groups. During festive occasions like Durga Puja there are huge queues outside the restaurant but that doesn't deter huge crowd from lining up and waiting for their turn to feast. They have a pleasant ambience and a warm look feel. Overall, a good choice if your are in the area.

The most horrible Chinese food I‚Äôve ever had in my life.  The soup was like boiled water on vegetables.  The Hakka chow seemed sweetish with no flavours and the manchurian dumplings were all maida.  To goof up on such standard food items  is really remarkable.  And on top of that the attitude of the steward was to die for ????

Krystal Chopsticks had been one of our go-to places earlier for family dineouts. I still visit the place at least once or twice a year when the headcount in a group is large, and the pockets are relatively empty. However, the quality of food has gone down drastically with time. The food is still decent, but it used to be much better earlier. I like the seafood dishes they prepare, and their Thai Chicken tastes great! So, if you're dropping in, make sure you order some of them.

This has been my go to place for Chinese food for a long time. The quality of the food served are very good and nothing to complain about that.
I'd really recommend the hakka noodles from here (of any kind) along with the honey chicken/ chicken in oyster sauce and the American Chop-suey.

The price is a bit on the higher side of things in here so that's something to consider, but the quantity of food goes well with it, where a plate of rice or noodles will be enough for one person, or even two for a bit lighter meal.

The services from the staffs are great as well and nothing to complain on that front.

There's also a section with various birds for watching while you wait for your table, which always facinated me as a kid so if you're taking kinds along with you they'll have something to keep them occupied if you have to wait for the tables.

Overall I really like this place and would recommend it.

We were a group of 5 people and entered this restaurant on shashti afternoon after just seeing the Hindustan Park Durga Puja. The restaurant was half-filled at that point of time so got our seats quickly. The decor was very good with a couple of Buddhist statues near the entrance and a huge bird cage for finches. The stewards were courteous and had a smiling face. We ordered Spring Chicken with bone, Red Pepper Chicken and Chicken Sweet Corn Soup. The soup was good and had good quantity of chicken in it. The Red pepper chicken was just perfect but the stand out item was the Spring chicken. It was superb! It had the right mix of spices and it was so tasty that we ordered again. The only downside was the prices. We thought that the price of the dishes were a bit steep. We paid Rs 430/- for a plate of Red Pepper Chicken. For a second I thought we were at Mainland China and not at Krystal Chopsticks. They seriously need to bring down the prices if they want to retain their clientele.

Considering we went to this place in the extreme rush during the Puja hours, the service was surprisingly prompt and food was good. Albeit quite expensive, the food was light on the tummy and of substantial amount to feed 1.5 people per plate.¬†We tried everything on the menu which has pork. It was succulent and perfectly cooked.

Had lunch with my parents yesterday.We ordered chicken asparagus soap,mixed fried rice with a side dish of chilli fish and garlic prawns.How do they taste-
1)Chicken Asparagus soup=3.5/5 (Boring asparagus was saved by a nice broth).
2)Mixed fried rice=4/5(Very good sadly quantity suffers with regards to price they charge).
3)Chilli fish=5/5 (The best dish of the table,liked it very much).
4)Garlic Prawns=3.5/5 (Too sweet to handle).
Overall we had a decent if not filling meal at the price we paid.Service was slow yesterday because of temporary shortage of staffs.
Honorable mentions- Very well behaved staffs, Beautiful decor.

We go to restaurants for food, ambiance and service. 
Taking it one at a time. 
Food was mediocre with no exceptional spice to it. Half of the dishes were served cold and quite less in quantity compared to the price.
The ambience would have been appreciable had the service been nice. We had to wait for everything - even water was served 15 minutes after getting in. The manager himself had a rude ring to his tone with the waiters almost clueless about what they had to do unless told. The presentation of the small quantity of food made time here all the more worse.

Me n 2 f my frndz were the first customers here on Choturthi noon this Puja...Soon after though it was housefull as expected n people waiting outside...we were quite lucky ;)

Now the Ambiance is pretty nice with beautiful decorations...Lighting is fine..not very bright neither too dim...Spot On!!!

Dishes we tried ---

Oyster Chicken --- Well this one tasted just like Chilli Chicken...The taste was fine...Nothing special or new about it...

Manchurian Fish --- This one was quite flavoursome...The fish pieces just melted in the mouth...so soft they were...Full marks to this one for sure... :)

Mixed Fried Rice --- This one was also quite fine.

Now speaking of Service...No complaints there as well...

The quality of food here is very good...no doubt about it...Good place to try out for Chinese Lovers...

But the Price is quite a bit on the higher side...In fact starters are horribly expensive...we 3 friends couldn't afford to try one...Main course dishes also are quite overpriced man...So Price is the thing you have to keep in mind if you're thinking of visiting this place üò∞üò∞

Tried out this restaurant in Hindustan Park with a few of my friends. The ambience and service was fine.
            I tried out Chicken Hakka noodles, Chicken fried rice, Chilli Chicken and sweet and sour chicken. I must admit that the quality of the food could not do justice to the price. It was just average.

FINAL VERDICT- I found this place to be just about average and it could not totally meet my expectations.

Went to this Chinese restaurant during the fag end of Durga Puja. Maybe that's why the eatery was not so crowded. Found the decor to be dainty and neat. The restaurant is spacious. Waiters were quick with the orders. We ordered chilli chicken with chicken noodles. The items were good, though a tad overpriced and would have tasted great with a little less oil. 
Our first visit here was a good one, overall.

Lovely ambience sorry I am a sucker for it, can't help. Never ending que often gives way to compromise in the quality of food. Krystal Chopstick impressed me with the quality being perfect inspite of the usual Pujo rush. 
Tried Veg Hakka chowmein with Schezwan Fish and I did not regret it. Though the quanity of chowmein was not for two as I had expected but the quality was nevertheless quite good. Schezwan Fish left my tounge numb with it's spiciness . 
Overall it was a nice experience and I am quite eager to visit Krystal Chopstick again.

This is an overpriced restaurant where I didn't find anything great. Food prices are exorbitantly high whereas both the quality and quantity are nothing as such. A plate of simple chicken Manchurian which tasted like the roadside food is being charged around 350 bucks. Will absolutely never visited this place again. Ambience too is nothing great. It's just because we were tired after pandal hopping and didn't want to go anywhere else we went there. Took chicken hakka noodles and Chicken Manchurian which simply tasted like any other normal eateries. This 3 rating is only because their service were fast.

Food is good. But not the service. We ordered for common chinese dishes: chilie fish, hakka and gravy chowmin, chicken fried rice etc. The foods were served on time and were tasty too. However the service of the employees are really poor. Often we waited long for water, serving, bills, tissue papers etc. which was really annoying.

Hygiene plays a very important role in each and every food industry. Krystal Chopsticks is a place which is ignorant about hygiene. So first of all I will recommend my readers not to visit this place. You'll get a ton of restaurants which is far better in that area. This place is overpriced, lacks hygiene, the attitude of waiters is unacceptable, and service is also very bad. I visited this place twice and I was disappointed every time. First time when I visited the place, my first impression was good as I found it very cozy and the decor was also nice. But then within a few moments everything changed. They served sizzlers which was cold and obviously there was no sizzle in it. Then the worst thing that happened was there were a couple of cockroaches on our table. When we informed the staffs around they were very casual about it. Second time I visited the place thinking that the previous incident might have been an accident. But my assumptions were not true at all. This time a couple who was just beside our table found dead cockroach in their food only. So according to me this place is a waste of time and money and I'm never going to visit this place again.

This restaurant is situated in Hindustan Park near Gariahat more in the lane opposite to Basanti Devi college. A very good Chinese restaurant which I visited recently. A small cosy restaurant with beautiful decoration and it was soo calm and quaint inside. We went there for lunch after some shopping and the ambiance only soothed us. A very good place to be with your family or friends and a great place to take your date too.

We ordered for-

1) Egg Fried Rice ( The fried rice was soo light yet tasty. It was really delicious and full of fresh veggies and eggs with minimal oil. Quality of the food was good and quantity was well enough for two. )

2) Spicy chicken in munchurian style ( This dish was also good but it was not spicy as mentioned in the menu but on the lighter side. Chicken pieces were really fresh and soft. I quite liked this dish too.)

Food was really great and quality and quantity both lived upto my expectations. Staffs were really polite and courteous. Prices were a bit on the higher side but that doesn't matter much when the food items were that good.
RECOMMENDED FOR ALL CHINESE CUISINE LOVERS. I would be surely visiting to try some other dishes.

This is a worse restaurant to dine out. Hygiene has a major role in the success of any restaurant rather, in any industry, which is entirely missing in their food. I ordered from this restaurant as a treat for my friend's birthday.

One of our item was fried chicken wings, the food was not cooked properly and when we raised the issue to the waiter about it, he brought in his manager and we were insulted as well. It's almost like they just want to loot your money.

Located in the lane opposite to basanti Devi college this is a good place to have Chinese food. A bit costly on the pocket but the food and ambience will make up for it. The walls are painted in Chinese style and the Chinese type lanterns hanging from the ceiling add to the ambience. The staff are courteous and well manered and are always ready to help. Coming to the food we ordered chicken noodle soup, mixed fried rice, chicken in oyster sauce and chocolate souffle. The soup was good. The fried rice was also very good but the chicken in oyster sauce was not upto the mark and hardly had any taste of oyster sauce. The chocolate souffle was average. Overall okayish. The price was around 1100/- with tax.

Went to this place on a saturday evening. It was quite crowded. Had crispy fried shredded chicken,red pepper fish,noodles, fried rice,etc. The food quality is good but the service is not good. We had asked 3 people for a knife and got it after 10-12minutes. They should work on the service a little and everything will be perfect then.

It is a very beautiful restraurent and the decoration is awesome, located in Gariahat. This is a mainly chinese restraurent and i'm a chinese food lover. So, i visited there with a high expection of great Chinese food and my expectation not only just fulfilled,that's not, i'm totally satisfied with their decoration, food items and also their behave. We ordered fried rice, garlic chicken, ginger chicken , thai chicken - these were just yummy üòã and delicious. The price is too high and the tax is also applicable , but overall, i say , this restraurent is just superb for the chinese food lovers.

This has been one of the places my mother and I have been eating at after shopping in Gariahat. Recently we had gone there for dinner with our extended family and I fell in love with this place yet again.
SERVICE: 4.5/5
Right from the gateway to your designated table, you will have a warm welcome. No matter how busy this restaurant gets, there is always someone to attend you at just one call.

AMBIENCE: 3/5
Simple yet elegant decor with subtle lighting. Perfect for family dinners.

FOOD: 4/5
We ordered thai soup and chicken sweet corn soup and crispy chicken for starters. Thai soup has always been my favourite but this place just enhanced my love for it. Normally soups make your tummy quite full but I was surprised by the fact that their soups are so light yet so fulfilling. For the main course we had ordered chicken singapore noodles, garlic fried rice and mixed fried rice, chilli fish, hot garlic pork and prawn in schezwan sauce. I am more of a rice person, but this place made me a fan of noodles as well. Their singapore noodles was nothing like any noodles I tasted before. The chilli fish(basa) was exquisite, so was their prawn in schezwan sauce. However I was a little disappointed in the rice as there was hardly any difference between the garlic fried rice and the mixed fried rice. Hot garlic pork was rather sweet. Apart from that I have no other complaints. As this place was quite crowded, they ran out of chocolate souffle, so we settled for vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce.
I should also mention they had special dishes for the day..quail dishes caught my attention. Hope to try it out next time.

A meet up with a friend ended up in dinner at this place...

The first drizzle in Kolkata helped to alleviate the scorching heat of the day...without wasting much time we got down to business...not before I had noticed the bright welcoming entry and an ample and comfortable seating...the waiters are smiling and at a comfortable distance without appearing nosey...

The sea food soup with lemon coriander lifted up our mood as well as the taste buds...this was followed by the deliciously juicy and filling chicken pan fried noodles with generous quantity of veggies thrown in...
The prawn in pepper and salt was the magnum opus of the night.
We left the place with an umbrella in our hands and satisfied tummies...

Warning: before asking for the check, remind the management not to add the service charge, which according to the Supreme Court guidelines, you aren't supposed to pay as a mandatory custom!

This place has a special place in my heart as I have been visiting this place since childhood. I have celebrated so many birthdays here. Once upon a time when Kolkata's food scenario hadn't changed so drastically it was a happening joint and the crowd used to flow in at this place for Chinese. This restaurant is surely not authentic Chinese but the Indian version of it. The decor is very subtle and pleasing with love birds at the entrance, Chinese paintain on the wall and a smiling guard welcoming you at the door. Coming to the food, most of the dishes here is worth a try specially the chicken hot and sour soup which is just perfect here. They serve good chop suey as well but the rice is always very bland. Their desert is nothing worth a try. The staff here is very courteous and helpful. They also have a PDR inside the restaurant for a family to dine in. If you get a chance to have lunch after some shopping in Gariahat do try out this restaurant. Its located in the lane of the famous kimbadanti shop, near indthalia in Hindustan park

A tad bit disappointed with this place. Had expected much better. The food that was served to us drew mixed response from us. Some were good but other dishes were absolutely lack lustre. The service too was erratic. They would forget to fill our water glasses and had to be told to serve. Even forgot to remove the empty bowls from the table.The chicken mixed rice and Chilly chicken side dish which my friends had was good, according to them. I had the lemon, coriander, mushroom soup which was very good. But the Hakka noodles was pedestrian, tasted just like the roadside ones! The veg side dish, devil veg, recommended by the server was also ordinary. The price for this kind of meal was too high, the food didn't live up to the steep price!!

An after office visit. The first thing I liked about this place is when you enter just at your right hand you can see a whole lot of love birds & nests - something unique & pretty. Next, looking at the place itself you'll find the perfect hygiene factor - too clean & shiny. Perfect lighting & a soothing Chinese decor. Service was quick. In the starter, we have ordered a chilly mushroom babycorn & lime soda. For main course, there was sea food noodles & spicy chicken mongolian style. Good quantity & taste. However, I felt the price is a little high which can be lessened.

Very disappointing experience. The service was extremely slow, soup was good but tepid. We ordered the crab sweet corn soup. It took too long for our food to arrive, and it wasn't just us but a lot of people kept waiting; some even got up and left as the time taken to serve food/water was almost an hour plus. Food quality was good, it deserves a 3/5. Although the staff was warm and welcoming, perhaps they were stressed out, as they seemed very confused and flustered. Simple things like water or chopsticks also took ages to reach, and to end it we got somebody else's bill, which we didn't pay of course, but it was carelessness on the staff's part.

This was on my list since ages. Finally managed to treat my tastebuds here on Poila Boisakh.
Naturally the place was crowded and we thought like others we too would have to wait for an indefinite period to recieve what we ordered.
Thankfully that didn't happen. Quite happy with their service. ‚ò∫
The menu promises great tasting Oriental food.
We ordered fish in mustard sauce and mixed fried rice. And a fresh lime soda too to beat the heat.
Rice was great both in quality and quantity.
Fish was exquisite. Loved every bit of it. 8 pcs were there so enough for twoüëç
Decor is beautiful encrypted with Chinese letters all around.
It has a touch of warmth. Another cute thing about this place was the bird shelter that was just behind the seating area(on its right side) at the entrance. It was charming üëå

A nostalgic place to be as it reminded me of my school days, an apparently frequent visit. The place hasn't aged much and keeps its ambience delighted. The food is a value for money. Of the basics that were tried were a mushroom based, a momo and a sweet corn soups- the cliched one where the taste was maintained. Overall a good place to be coined as value for money.

This restaurant has been around for a long time and is quite close to our heart. Since my childhood days, we have either frequented this place or ordered food from here. The biggest positive has been that the quality and quantity of the food has been pretty consistent. The ambience has always been excellent here and the service matches the ambience. The food has always been and still is delectable. And I hope it stays that way too. I love their Chilli Chicken, Fried Rice, Chowmein. I have never found them compromising on quality and it still stays the same today. Hope they continue the good work and keep satisfying our taste buds, even in the future.

2. Chicken fried rice - The usual fried rice one gets in every Chinese restaurant.

However the plus point about this place is that they serve really tasty food in very big proportions at reasonable prices.

The Honey Chicken and Hakka Mix Chow are well tested but the gravy chow is not so good, as the amount of gravy is quite tiny to the chow. Sufficient quantity, and two plate can easily shared by three persons. Reasonable Price. All types of Card Accepted.

The interiors were spotlessly clean with some urban touch to the Chinese culture. We order Mixed Hakka Noodles and Dry Chilli Chicken. The noodles was fantastic and adequate for two. The chilli chicken was spicy and juicy. I recommend this place to all who dotes on Chinese food.

Visited this place a few days back with my friends. Having a limited budget, we ordered a plate of steamed chicken momos and chilli fried babycorn for starters, and it was really good in taste. But when ordering for the main course, there was nobody to take an order. Despite it being fairly empty, it was amusing that nobody was there to take orders. Really poor management. After 15 minutes, we found a waiter who took our order of chicken fried rice, honey chicken and garlic prawns. As soon as the food arrived, we forgot about the issue as the food was really enjoyed by us all. The prawns were really great in taste. The chicken could have been a bit more tender as it became a bit chewy. Overall, the food was great. Will give it a 4/5. But management issues must be sorted out.

Krystal Chopstick is a great place to have good Chinese food with authentic Chinese flavor. It's not like the indo-chinese we get here in India but their main focus is on the actual taste you'll get in China or a China town for that matter if you are in Kolkata. Do try out their crispy fried chicken as it is one of the best I've tried in the city, even better than Mainland China for that matter. Prices are a bit on the higher side which can be lessened but the quality of food is up to the mark and it won't disappoint you.

I was catching up with an old friend of mine one fine evening in Gariahat and after hanging around for a while we were craving for Chinese food. I suggested we have dinner at this place as I had heard some nice reviews. Upon arrival we received a warm welcome and were greeted cordially by the staff. ¬†The ambiance felt nice as the place was slowly filling up. We ordered -

Starter: Fish Finger - The fish didn't seem fresh

Main Course:

‚èπMandarin Noodles

‚èπFried chicken with almonds - It was a dry chicken dish served with almonds and tasted good.

‚èπChicken in oyster sauce - This was extremely bland and with almost no trace of the oyster sauce

Now coming back to the noodles, it looked good at first glance nicely tossed with vegetables. Midway into our meal as we dug in more, we gradually started to feel a burnt flavor throughout the dish (top part cleverly covered up the burnt layers underneath). This was immediately reported to the member of the staff who brought in the food. The person looked at me in complete disbelief and tried making excuses. After
a few seconds of argument a senior staff member intervened and apologized and we received a fresh plate of noodles after a 10 minute wait. By the time it came in there was no appetite left in us and very sadly the second plate was no different than the previous. Disgusted, we decided to simply walk away with a parcel of the leftover food. (Regret not clicking pics to show everyone).

Totally agree this place being over-hyped n over-priced...the food is average n does not live up to the price....Overall a bad experience!!!

We went there on a sunday. As hatari was too crowded, thought of trying this.
Food: We ordered regular chicken hakka noodles, rice noodles,sliced chicken in spring onion, chicken manchurian. Taste was okay. Noodles were extra boiled so felt sticky to my tongue. 
Ambience : Quite spacious with decent crowd around. Interiors are good to give you a nice feel. 
Service: Slow. They took ages to deliver the 2nd order which was just one plate of extra noodles. 
Overall a very average place and only pay a visit if you are very hungry and there is no other option around. 
To all Chinese connoisseurs its a 'No' from my perspective.

Just back from a delightful family dinner at Krystal Chopstick. The ambience was quite nice and the fact that there was not a single empty table speak volumes about this restaurant.
We ordered chilly garlic squid and chilly baby-corn for starters.
The squid was delectable, but the babycorn was quite different from the ones you get elsewhere. The corn was not cut into pieces but the whole babycorn was batter-fried and not very crispy. Also, the dish was extremely hot. But, it WAS chilly babycorn so we shouldn't really be complaining.
For mains we ordered chicken rice noodles, prawn fried rice, chilly garlic crab, chicken with mushroom and spring onions and chilly quail.
Both the staples were abundant for 5 of us and tasted quite good. The chicken was very light and comforting to the palate, the quail was again quite spicy and can be a delight for those who enjoy spicy 'desi' Chinese and the crab looked and tasted lovely. The crab shells were stuffed with cooked crab-meat, eggs and other vegetables in a tangy sauce.
We washed all of it down with tall glasses of Fresh Lime soda.
The bill came to around 2700 with taxes for five people, which going by the amount of food we ordered was quite reasonable.

Visited this place a few days back since we were in the vicinity of Gariahat. This place is located in Hindustan Park, near where the Hindustan Park takes place. The ambiance is good, and the outlet is pretty spacious and neat. We were looking for some light refreshments and hence we kept ourselves to Chicken Fried Momo and Red Pepper Chicken. Both the items were adequately tasty and the quantity too was decent enough. The total bill came to be around Rs.663 including VAT and Service Tax, so it was reasonable in our opinion. We would like to try out the main courses for dinner here someday.

Craving for some good food and in Gariahat? You know what I am hinting at!¬†

The prices are tad bit high but the quality is higher, therefore compensating!
Have been here multiple times, 7 years ago and now. Food has always been overwhelming

1. Food - Good and high quality, fresh!¬†
2. Ambiance - ¬†Soothing and Warm
3. Service - Very humble service stave. The FnB people are really nice. They do know how to push their menu.
4. Moderate.

Also, if you are a sea food person, dont forget to try their calamari. Trust me, its worth it!

A pretty good chinese restaurant in Gariahat.
It has been there for a long long time and has been preparing pretty good food ever since.
However , a problem with this restaurant is that it takes a lot of time to serve food :'3

Visited this place during durga puja.. So it is not the perfect time to do a review. But my experience there was not very good. First of all the the price is not proportional to the quality and quantity of food. After long wait they served cold food. But the interior was nice and good staff.

Good old Krystal Chopsticks! This time we had the Red Pepper Chicken, which is probably their speciality. But look out for the chillies though! Had the sweet corn soup and later the mixed gravy noodles which had the wonderful Calcutta Chinese flavour about it! Good atmosphere and good food. Although some of the items were missing because the menu was festive and slightly highly priced. Not a problem at all!

i dont know how this place is maintaining a 3.5 still because as many times i have had food here the service has been bad and if they serve without much waiting time the food has to be stale. I had ordered normal schezwan chicken and a plate of chicken fried rice the last time i visited. i was kept waiting for almost 30mins before i could eat. so if you are hungry and the food fastest then this is just a big NO NO!
Otherwise food is pretty okay but the price is on the higher side.
There are various other options in this price bracket i feel.

Was at gariahat,and then it started raining like cats and dogs , had nowhere to go so stood beside this restaurant in the shade, the staff of this restaurant were very generous,they said the we could wait inside  until rain stops,we thot we would just sit for a while and leave until rain stops,their ambience was good and welcoming hence we decided to have lunch here.The menu here was not very pricey so orderd chicken n corn clear soup,mixed fried rice,fried chiken in red wine,Cajun stlyed fried prawns, overall good in taste but lesser in quantity,enough for two if both of you are not very hungry.

Typical so so kind of food as per standard & quality... above all, ‚Çπ20 mineral water charged ‚Çπ50+vat+ service tax in the final bill. As per quality of the food & price comparison, I must say a bit over priced.

The place was clustered and found the staff very clumsy. Order took almost eternity to reach us. Or may be it was the puja rush. Coming to food, the quality was decent. The prawn dishes were good. But the thai curry was extremely spicy. All in all a decent place for chinese food which is not heavy on the pockets.

My 6th visit it was after a long time.. Ordered chicken wings, mixed fried rice, chicken fried rice and chilli fish and two thumbsup.. Chicken wings was okay... Nothing special in it.. It was just normal chicken fry.. Fried rice was good and chilli fish was average.. Staffs are not at all helpfull.. Too noisy restro to sit peacefully.. It was feeling like we went to any fish market.. Then they gave us the bill.. They took extra money, instead of two bottles of thumbsup they charged us for 4bottles with taxes.. Thank god we checked and asked for our money back.. First they denied to do that asked us to visit next time and they will adjust then after arguements we won and took our cash back.. Horrible experience.. Too costly.. Too bad service.. Noisy place..  Will not visit krystal chopstick ever.. Never ever..

One of the oldest Chinese food courtyard in Gariahat area. The restaurant has a decent ambience. But according to the food the charge is overpriced! Taste of the dishes r quite normal nothing exquisite yet the prices r high which shocks u more when taxes get added.
We ordered for the following:
Chicken fried rice: simple fried rice tossed with chicken, scrambled egg n spring onion.
Garlic chicken: thick sweetish gravy with chopped garlic serving 8pieces of boneless chicken.
Chilli fish: diced onion n green chillies gravy in soy with chunks of basa fish is very simple n tasty.

Overall, serves simple happy-go-tummy food but the only problem being it overpriced.

I have seen this chinese restaurant in hindustan park for quite sometime now but due to hectic shopping schedules in gariahat ,could never visit it. Today, I had some work in hindustan park , so decided to have my lunch there..the first thing thats worth noticing there is the beautiful coops meant for lovebirds.. it was a beautiful sight though I am quite against keeping birds in cages... we were welcomed warmly by the waiter ,and promptly gave us water. The ambience is typically red and black with beautiful chinese frescos on the walls.. 
We ordered chicken sweet corn soup,egg friedrice,hoisin pork and surpise,surprise !! Quail in oyster sauce! Soup was really nice,though I wished the corn kernels were boiled a little more.. egg friedrice was just awesome, not at all greasy, yet moist it was refreshing. Hoisin pork was nice,though nithing great, they mainly used the fatty part of pork in the dish which didnt augur too well with me,taste was good though. Coming to the quail, itvwas the first time I was having it, and I found it to be just superb , tastes similar to duck meat actually.. we polished it off with a yummy,sinful chocolate souffle which was just excellent.
Overall, I would say its one of the better places in gariahaat area to have chinese food though they need to improve on their pork dishes... :-)

Visited this Chinese restaurant today after several years and I was a bit disappointed with the food. The quality of the food has deteriorated over the years and the items just taste like Indianised Chinese food. The restaurant no longer serves authentic Chinese food which is a bit letdown. The service was average and the items are overpriced compared to other Chinese restaurant and the quality of food. Overall it was not a bad experience but it could have been better.

After a long time have been to this place.
They have completely changed the decor,sitting arrangements.Used to visit this place back in 2007-08.
Still they maintained their consistency of serving delicious food.
The moment I entered this place I could see small small,colourful love birds on the right side of the entry door..they were too cute to avoid.The manager greeted us and helped to settle down.T he waiters were well behaved and greeted us with smile.
The ambience was good..dim light and Buddha statues around.
We orderd fresh lime soda and Singapore noodles (chicken) with hunan chicken as we went for some evening refreshments only.The fresh lime soda was served quickly and it took 25 mins for the noodles to be be served on the table.I found the service was little slow .But yes the food was yum.which has compensated everything.And the Hunan chicken was good enough.The quantity was enough for two people.The chicken was also fresh.
Then we ordered one ice cream with hot chocolate sauce.The chocolate sauce wasn't that hot .But yes we loved it.The preparations were good but i will suggest them to focus on their service a bit.
Overall I think it's a nice restaurant and will surely visit again.üòÉüòÉüòÉ

Had an overall excellent experience at this place. This is a classy restaurant with a sophisticated ambience, and i got some much-craved-for peace and quiet over here without a rowdy crowd, which i felt was lovely (yes i hate people...hence i am planning to eradicate humanity...muahahaha). The wall deco, paintings, tapestries, lighting, all give you a great (*cough* wall of china *cough*) feel. The seating arrangements are pretty good, the restaurant has used the floor space well with divided sections. Another really really huge plus point was the service, the attitude and behaviour of the waiters. Only the serving time was a bit slow, otherwise it's definitely one of the best which i have ever experienced in all the years of my food gobbling at restaurants in kolkata. The waiters were really helpful and cooperative. Now comes the main part: the foooooooood. The menu is pretty vast with a variety of delicacies, i really wish to visit this place multiple times more to try more of them. And the taste is amazing. Period. I can't describe it any better. I may go on stringing a variety of fancy words (and trust me my vocab is more expansive than the menu here) but none would do justice to the food. And the waiters really helped us out to pick exactly what we wanted. And even made sure that we got our cravings (Anonymous lady sitting beside me: "i want something spicy") fulfilled. Overall it was a great lunch here and i'd definitely look to visit it again. And one more thing people. Chopstick. Singular. And K-R-Y. As in Krypton. Superman's home people. Don't mix the name up. No Lois, it's KRY. :)

For savouring oriental cuisine this is a must visit. We ordered for korean fried rice (‚Çπ230),pork sizzlers (‚Çπ380),chilly duck (‚Çπ360) on table and mixed fried rice (‚Çπ210) and lamb in pineapple sauce (‚Çπ320) in takeaway.Fried rice was a bit bland in taste while rest of the side dishes lived up to the expectation. Portions were adequate for two.
Stewards were somehow cold in their approach and should have a more vibrant approach towards the customers. The positivity was missing.

When we were searching for a good Chinese restaurant in gariahat we found this well interior decorated Chinese restaurant. Previously thought for a high price menus from outside hesitated before to enter but later our predictions proved totally wrong. A wide range of dishes were there from quail to duck n pork to crab. Price were within 200- 350 in range. We ordered a clear soup with chicken, mushroom, broccoli, carrots, cabbages, beans and capsicum which was healthy and tasty as well as...Then for main course we took mogolian fried rice and fish in hoisin sauce..Quantity was enough for two and both r really good in taste...Ambiance was quiet and staffs r very attentive..1000/- for two people dinner.. Wish to go for next time definitely..It is just near to Hindusthan park durga puja and Indithalia..

I had the most horrible experience today at this restaurant. ¬†Their sense of customer service and hospitality were at the lowest levels. There were seven of us who intended to have dinner there today. But from the moment we entered we were made to feel & understand that if we sit we have to place our orders immediately finish your food the moment it is served and get out asap so that they can have the next set of diners in immediately. I am not getting into the details but the overall experience was so embarrassing in front of my friends since I had suggested this place. The manager Tirthankar Sen was rude and not even apologetic ¬†rather he kept on arguing. I am appalled at such behavior. He should be replaced immediately. I head a division of my company where customer service is the key word for business and if it would have been any of my team members acting such would have been sacked immediately. I am not going to recommend this place to any of my contacts anymore.

What a horrible experience! The old look of the restaurant, the cozy ambience is gone! There are two ill mannered managers who do not let you wait even for a minute. You have to order like a robot! You can't wait for friends to join you... They are so busy!!! Busier than a Park Street restaurant on weekends? 
Can anybody be so fast as to go, order, eat and come out like lightening?
We had to leave the restaurant with bitter feeling, all our love for the age-old cozy restaurant gone in a flicker!
I blacklist Krystal Chopsticks forever from my list of restaurants!

Krystal Chopstick is located just opposite to Indthalia.

Restaurant was huge so as seating arrangements. Service was quite fast and attentive. 

Took sweet lime soda, it was very good. 

As a starters we took red pepper fish, it was just out of the world.. excellent taste... The portion size to coating, spices all were perfect.

We ordered mixed noodles and chicken in red wine.

Noodles was very good, it has huge prawns and diced chicken.
On the other side chicken in red wine portion's had some extra cornflour coating, else taste was fine..

The food is good and reasonably priced, no doubt. But the service leaves a lot to be desired, sadly. And I don't even mean pampering by the staff but the very basics. It borders on the edge of 'I don't care' when they put up quail dishes as 'Today's Special' and then actually tell you that quail is not available, when you order. Am I expecting too much? How difficult is it to not indicate something on the menu and that too as a 'special' when you actually don't have it? Just because this place has a good footfall, what with being around for 20 years, doesn't mean such attitude from the staff/management.

We wanted to have something new as we left Azad hind dhaba and this place did not let us down. Service was prompt quantity is good a single dish suffice for 2. We had squid and quail but were great. Would come again to try duck and lamb. Has parking place which is a plus.

God this place has deteriorated so much. It was a really popular place when I was a kid and I used to go there quite often with my parents. This Monday I went there after a span of five years and was appalled by the service and the quality of the food. Noodles soaked in oil and an abomination of a dish which was supposedly "Garlic Chicken" was enough to tarnish my memories of this place. Overall an extremely unsatisfactory and disappointing experience.

Tucked away in the confusing lanes of Hindustan Park is this joint. Had heard not so positive points about this place but tried it out nonetheless...the food was okay. I mean how could somebody go wrong with the basics! The price for the quality they serve is on the higher side.

When you are looking for good taste, this is the place where you must stumble upon. Located in the lane just opposite of Basanti Devi College, krystal chopstick is a truly a gem. The floor area is very much spacious, even they have distinct waiting area too. Interior is just like typical other restaurants not to brag about anything. Coming to the food which brings me here again and again. Though i only tried the Chinese and thai stuffs here, which beholds its attraction. Pocket pinch is standard. If you visit here must give a try to Chinese and thai delicacies.

Because of the low rating I never wanted to come here.. But alas yesterday evening a friend took us there to give her birthday treat but the food explained it's low rating. Though the service was warm they even gifted my friend a Krystal chopstick cup as her birthday gift.. But that clearly isn't enough to keep the customers lured..
Crispy chilly baby corns was good but not up to the mark.
Sizzlers- don't ever order that.. What they provide can't be called a sizzlers
Rice and noodles were saltless
Chicken preparation was okay.. Can be tolerated.
I would never recommend this place.

There are two types of restaurants, 
1) the once in a while place.
2) the go to place that's dependable and comfortable.

This is the latter. And I love it, its one of those places that I go to when I'm confused and just want a good Chinese meal which is classicly Calcutta.

1 word: Good. This is my second visit to this place, and I wasn't disappointed either time. The location is quite easy, being in the lane bang opposite of Basanti Devi College. The ambiance is cool. Nothing spectacular, but good. The food is really good. Not great, but good. I tried the Fried Chicken Wantons, Fried Rice in Oyster Sauce, Chicken in Red Wine and a Fresh Lime Soda. All the items were cooked well and were tasty. The service was prompt. It was a bit over priced though. I would prefer this over other restaurants in the vicinity any day. Well, except Azad hind Dhaba.

Krystal Chopstick an old name in multicuisine restaurants.

**Location**
Very easy to locate as it's located just opposite to Basanti Devi College.

**Experience**
On a durga puja evening after visiting the Hindustan park durga puja pandal went here for dinner as a part of my first visit here. Food was decent and quantity is sufficient for twin sharing. Pricing was reasonable that point of time.

Recently they have increased their rates very high which doesn't justify the quality at all. And the quality has come down as well. Not very impressive now . They really need to work on their whole infrastructure all together.

Been here many times and this place is sheer value for money. Their chicken wings are awesome in starters replacing my long time favorite threaded chicken. Recently when I went there, I was suggested to try out the red pepper and garlic chicken which was delicious too. Other than that their is a variety of soups and main course available. Their Singaporean rice noodles is quite sleek as well. Anybody looking for a Chinese restaurant around golpark/gariahat area should definitely try out here.

I was looking for juicy soft pork and tried many renowned places of kolkata.. but nothing matched the mouthwatering chilly pork ( dry) of Krystal Chopstick! A must try I would say.. we had also ordered mixed meet fried rice which was average and salt and pepper fish which was awesome! Though price is on the higher side will definitely come back for the juicy parks!

Located at Hindustan Park,  this place had pretty decent reviews and hence I decided to check it out.  It had soft lightning and usual seating arrangements in its decor.  The staff weren't exactly warm people,  they seem more like there to just do their job and get paid.  Coming to the food,  I ordered seafood noodles and half plate of Brown Glazed Duck.  The waiter had previously mentioned that the duck dish won't be a boneless one,  yet I went ahead with it.  The duck was tasty on the outside with all the spices,  but inside it was pretty bland.  The seafood noodles.  I have no idea why it's called that since all I had was plain noodles tossed in oil with some egg and prawns.  It's not heavily priced but isn't light on the pocket either.  With the prices they set,  I expect the flavours to be there.  Pretty average all in all.

A place that can be easily located.. A more or less ok ambience with awful food.. I have never had such oily Chinese food elsewhere.. I wish I could have rated this place negatively as far as food is concerned. An overhyped place it is with zero food quality. We ordered for dry chilly mushroom.. With oil floating everywhere.. Mixed Hakka noodles again with oil floating over the plate.. Shredded garlic chicken which of course had the chicken julienned ... !!! Will never recommend the place to anyone else !!

I wish I could rate this outlet in negative, but alas Zomato won't be kind enough to me. To start off, I had heard good reviews about this place, but I guess I was wrong. One evening, while returning home, I decided to head off to Gariahat/Gol Park to pack up some food for dinner. It was raining abruptly, but even then I decided to go on.

As I was crossing by this restaurant, the downpour slightly increased, and I decided to try this one out rather than get myself completely drenched. So, I walked in and made myself comfortable. Requested one of the waiters to switch on the fan, to which he expressed extreme displeasure. There should have been a disclaimer that the fans were put up for show.

The restaurant was pretty much empty with hardly 2 more tables being occupied. I decided to order for a Mixed Rice and Chicken with Oyster Sauce. The food came in no time. Rather it was quicker than I expected. Clearly indicating that it was just heated up. The rice was bland, but the toppings were in sufficient quantity. What I liked more was the number and the size of the mini prawns. The Chicken tasted bland too with the Oyster Sauce resembling absolutely no hint of Oyster Sauce. The batter was thick with very little Chicken in it.

I tried finishing up all I could but was pretty tired to get the entire thing. I requested the waiter to pack the remaining food up properly. Kindly note here, that the remaining food was virtually untouched, and wasn't spoiled. This was again followed up by a much reluctant waiter. He came back after some time with one paperbox and the final bill amount. When I opened the paperbox (Or Mishtir Baksho), the Rice and Chicken were stuffed forcibly in a plastic pouch and both of them were tucked into the paperbox.

Is this how you the restaurant packs up the food? You don't even put up such a behavior while serving packed foods to a beggar! Amazed, astonished and pissed, I paid off the bill, came outside, threw the packet and went back home after getting myself some snacks from a nearby joint. In short, this restaurant rates in negative when it comes to service and customer interaction. A hyped up joint serving tasteless food at exorbitant prices.

Krystal Chopstick is by itself a landmark, located near Hindustan park. Iv been to the place many times in the last 3 years and found it packed with ppl almost always. Theyve got a wide variety of non veg items, which are pretty nice. The ambience is also pretty nice. Overall it's a gud experience , expect that the service standards need a bit of a tweak.
Pros:
1. Prominent location 
2. Sufficient parking space
3. Good Chinese food

Cons:
1. Service is a bit tardy.

The craving for chopsuey since many days led us to hop in to this place while we were at gariahat. The whole restaurant was empty except for me and mom. Ambience was nice and the staff were courteous. But I must say I had one bad experience of having American Chopsuey over there. The gravy was supposed to be sweet and sour but I found no element of sourness in the gravy. Even though I hate wasting food I had to waste the last bit of it. Highly disappointed with the food.

Have ordered food several times from this place and the below review belongs to the latest such instance.

Chilli Prawn-Had pretty large pieces of prawn which were soft. They also sprinkle some fried noodles which was good. I personally like spicy food but this was VERY spicy. So, in case you want to order it you can ask the service staff to keep a check on it.

Thai Prawn-The same as the above but I will not complain.

Mixed Fried Rice-Had sufficient quantity of eggs and prawn. The quantity and quality of rice was okay.

I feel the prices are steep in this place and can be altered.

Going by the goodwill the restaurant has garnered over the years, i went for a try with my friends on my visit to Kolkata this February. I was starving after a tiring flight journey. Firstly, the restaurant looked shady, may be they tried to give it a candle light-dreamy affair, but all i could see was a cheap candle floating its way through the water bowl. Anyway, i kept my hopes intact and asked the waiter to place the order. Am a vegetarian. Half of the things i tried to order was not there. The waiter gave me a stupid explanation of thai food ingredients, fearing that i did not order. Even mushroom & brocholli in chinese food was missing, forget about the exotic vegetables. I ordered for a soup, which was nothing sort of a plane-jane salted noodle water.

Overall, I was thoroughly dissapointed and wished could give a zero. Vegetarians please avoid!

Nice small cozy place. Though I must say the service is a lazy one. Portions of food are huge so order carefully.Else you will end up wasting or taking it back home.

I visited krystal chopstick on the 1st of Feb for dinner with my cousins. The exterior did'nt strike me so appealing. Luckily one of my cousins knew about the reputation of this place so we opted for it. The interior was comfortable and cozy, though it could have been better.
We ordered hot and sour chicken soup which was quite satisfactory. However, another few members of our gang ordered for chicken clear soup. We tasted it a little and it appeared rather dull and tasteless. In the starters, we ordered Chicken wings and Red Bell Pepper Chicken. Chicken wings was just fine but Red Bell Pepper Chicken tasted amazing.¬†
Next we ordered for Chili Pork which ¬†tasted satisfactory and Crispy Lamb teamed with rice noodles and mixed fried rice. I was however not satisfied at all with the Crispy Lamb cause none of us really got the taste of lamb int. The rice was just fine and noodles the best.
In the desert we ordered vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce which was really blunt and blatant.
The price is a little on the higher side as compared to the food quality.
Overall I would give it a 3.

We went here on a special occasion to treat a friend to her fav Chinese food.

Food: We had ordered a chicken mushroom soup which was quite good. Then we had red pepper chicken, shredded lamb with green pepper n red chilly along with Korean fried rice and I was quite satisfied by both the taste and quantity. We wrapped it up with fresh lime soda.

Service: Service was on the mark and courteous, though I remember they were somewhat slow to serve, after we placed our order.

Ambiance: nice cozy ambiance and they have a beautiful waiting area with a huge bird cage.

Verdict: Recommend you to visit this place if you love Chinese food and good dining experiences; even with chopsticks if you are up for it.

Thus has been my favourite Chinese restaurant for the last 19 years. The food is the best in Chinese that I had and perfectly suits my palate. Been there atleast a 100 times if not more.

Patrick was my all time favourite Steward and he had taken special orders for me. Unfortunately he is not there in the restaurant anymore.

However, the food continues to excite me. Devils' pork, Schezuan pork fried rice, crispy Konjee lamb and Cantonese chowmein is something that I always have and never miss.

Keep it up guys.

One word of advice ..... there is scope of improvement of service and efficiency. 

Thanks for the last 19 years

A nice cosy place with an Oriental look needing some cleaning and maintenance. The food quality was not excellent, a little too oily and had the taste similar to the Chinese street food in Kolkata. We went in the late afternoon so it was almost empty except for a few couple and may be because of that the service was not upto the mark. It is a okay place to visit if you are looking for some cosiness, where you can sit with your partner or friends and are ready to compromise on the food to some extent. Food really is average.

This is one of my favourite Chinese restaurant, and their sizzlers are probably the best. The ambiance is amazing. You can probably never have dinner here without waiting, cause it's always packed, until recently. Located conviniently it promises for good food everytime you visit this place. Their vegetarian dishes are equally good. And the ambiance is quite good. And because it is a really old restaurant you can expect for a good crowd.

We ordered chicken spring rolls, which was quite oily and thick, looks like laccha parantha roll with chicken stuffing. We also ordered honey chicken and Singaporean noodles. Overall the food quality is poor. Very oily and had an essence of roadside Chinese flavour.

I have been to this place but didn't had such a good experience. The place was quite gloomy and it was quite crowded. Now coming to the food which is the main part of any restaurant. We ordered some Thai rice and prawns in red wine preparation. The names sounds quite interesting but unfortunately the taste was not at all good. The rice was nothing extra ordinary, it was a very simple preparation lacking taste and the prawns were so hard that was not even able to cut off with even knife. It seems they didn't gave us the fresh prawns but the stale ones. This was very disappointing and we paid quite high amount as well for this kind of food... Not worth at all

Visit the place only if you want to get harrassed by the mindless staffs there. Their Debit/Credit Card machines are faulty. They will make you pay twice for your bill even if your bank statement arrive at your phone in the first transaction only, saying they have not received the invoice.
So your account will get debited twice and they will constantly say you will get back the balance, and if you don't please come back we will pay u back. As if people have no work. And after all these the ridiculous staffs will follow you down the street and will ask, "sir did u pay for your bill?"
Means you have paid twice, still they will question you. Utter nonsense.

Food is exceptionally good, no doubt with that.
But over all, pathetic experience.

Visited few times for something or other reason. Once you enter manager will keep you to wait for 2 to 10 mins in pretext of that tables are not empty however you can clearly see tables without guests may be they want you to feel that they are always crowded. Anyways let me talk ambience, well its an average looking with a big mirror on the wall which become best friend for a girl :) (Take this as humour, no derogatory statement). In regards to service they are very very slow to serves you food.    Food was nice and u cant miss duck. It was all in all just ok restro where u can have food and come back but cant hangout with friends or family. Note- Beware of cockroaches. You might find on table. Plate, glass or on the spoon. Very unhygienic.

It was a great experience for me and my family...Hospitality was good though the manager was a bit hurried to take all the orders at once. Coming to the food it was delicious and sumptuous. Specially the dry chilli chicken,pepper fish and crispy chilli babycorn were great to taste. The choupsey was also very good and so were the noodles. Overall a great experience... Looking forward to visit again

One of my fav. place for Chinese. neat clean well decorated. have to buy water, which I find very irritating. they serve best chopsuyes, have tried almost all chickens, hey taste almost same, but good. Can order any Chicken dish as starter, or soups. Price is ok , portion is good, but avoid this place during puja.

The authority takes care about quality and reputation, although some of the waiters are very haughty.

Never miss their bird collection which you will find at right hand side of ur entry.

This is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the Gariahat area. I have been going there since my school days and even after so many years they have maintained consistency in serving good quality Chinese food. I really like the spring chicken, red pepper prawns and crab in exotic sauce. The ambience is perfect for a family lunch or dinner.

The ambience of Krystal Chopstick is top-notch. Good for a quiet family dinner. The service is pretty good and waiters are polite. I have been here a few items. Commendable dishes include the Fried Chicken Wings, Garlic Noodles non veg, Chicken Fried rice, Honey chicken. The Fried Fish in Lemon Sauce is also good. I am yet to try the pork and lamb dishes. All in all, a good experience. Ting! :-)

A very good place to eat if Chinese is your favourite cuisine. We ordered Red Pepper Chicken for starters which had 8 pieces in it. Then came the main course where we had mixed noodles and mixed fried rice with chillie chicken and Garlic Prawn. The Garlic Prawn were delicious. The size of the Prawns were very big too. They have a nice and cosy ambience and the service was also decent. When you enter the restaurant to the right you have a little aviary, so the bird watchers better watch out for that.

Had a great expectation from this place but was really disappointed with the food during puja.. ordered chicken noodles which was very dry and very less in quantity, chicken fried rice was average, schezwan chicken was extremely spicy and hot(way more than it was supposed to be) and left us with burning taste buds , sweet n sour fish was too sweet . Hope to get a better service next time.

We visited this place during durga puja. All were tired and hungry so after seeing this place we entered.
We ordered red pepper chicken,mixed rice and schezwan fish.
The food was not that good though we enjoyed as we were hungry.
And inefficient man power to handle such a big rush.
There is room for improvement.

We went to this place in peak durga puja time so the experience might vary if we do decide to go there once more but for now the feeling of being really let down is overwhelming! The prices were exorbitant! The quantities were okayish! And the quality was horrendous! The sweet and sour chicken and the pork was just inedible! They tasted like 10 spoonfuls of sugar was dissolved in a bowl of tomato ketchup and fried prices of chicken and pork was thrown into it! The pork and chicken were not distinguishable with both of them being dry! The gravy chowmein and fried rice was just about okay. The decor was nice with an innovative concept of a glass window to a big bird cage being the center of attraction . But all thoughts about things like that go way away when you are told that there isn't any regular water and you would have to buy water bottles worth 50 bucks each to quench your thirst after a long day of pandal hopping! All in all wont be returning to this place in a hurry!

Thought to hang out with friends to take a break from pandel hopping but sorry to say the worst Chinese restaurant I ever visited....I can assure you even the street side Chinese stalls are much better...the food quality is worse and quantity is very less ...feel like puking..price is too high ...Bad ambience...During pujas they don't give normal water from restaurant...u have to buy bisleri mineral water...Must mention 1 litre bisleri bottle of 20 rupees will cost you 50 rupees there...Nice policy to earn money....will never recommend anyone even my enemies to dine there....

This place is located at hindustan park, opposite to Indthalia. I heard this is one of the favourite destination of food lovers apart from Hatari, in this neighbourhood. We went here today for a lunch meal. The quality of the food is very good and quantity is upto the mark. But the point is there foods are overpriced and the waiters/security guards are not that trained that you expect from these kind of restaurants. We had chicken fried wings as starters, chicken chilli, sweet and sour prawn with hakka chow as main course. Not at all pocket friendly restaurant, very very overpriced, Zomato is showing its 800 for two, we took only 1 dish of each of the above mentioned items and it costs us around 1700. So left without dessert :p Happy Mahaastami :)

Today I went hoping to grab some good Chinese. Well you don't always get what you hope for. After waiting for 35 minutes of ordering I realized that I was served wrong items. The waiters are very polite , they pretend not listen to you when you call them . Even if you manage to get hold of them they don't bother to help you out . I was served mixed noodles and rice with pork when specifically I mentioned that I dint want pork . I wasn't give a glass so had to drink water from the bottle itself. The only thing which was good was the food. Although I had ordered garlic fish and got sweet and sour fish it was yum . 
I duly understand that with the Pujo round the corner it's difficult to manage the crowd but they need more stable and efficient men on board who know their job and do not have a gruff attitude. After all it doesn't matter if the food is tasty and mouth watering whereas the ambience sucks. 
I hope the concerned people try to pull up their sleeves and get to work.

The food is quite good in here...although the menu lacked in variety,which may be because of the Puja rush. I liked the din and the dim lights, with my favorite band the Eagles playing lightly in the background. The Chinese portraits all over the wall were interesting and beautiful to look at!
Compared to the quantity served and the menu,the price felt a little bit on the steeper side, more so if you compare it with Hatari which is just 3 minutes away from this one.
The service was good as well.

I am always so delighted by this place. This restaurant is located on the alley that is situated right on the opposite side of the Basanti Devi College Gariahat.
The ambience is fetching especially for people with a penchant for art works. Also they have a uniqueness of keeping little birds abutting the main space separated by a glass wall. The place exudes Chinese traditions and art collections.

Cuisine is variegated. My personal favourite is the Chopsey. From rice to noodles from chicken to duck, gourmets will be spoilt for choice in exchange of comfortable pinches on their pockets! This restaurant is marked by homeyness and the service is expeditious and good. The restaurant cares to uphold good hygiene conditions around. The restroom is also pretty squeaky clean with the only problem lying in the angle in which it has been constructed making it difficult to swing a cat. There is a waiting parlour for the restaurant-goers.

In any case the place is basically a thumbs up for me.

Went to Krystal chopstick after a long time, and was very delighted to see they have kept up their standards for quality of food. Patrons are greeted by a small aviary to the right upon entrance and the decor inside is a mix of oriental art and abstract design and definitely catches the eye. Servers are helpful although the time taken to serve was a bit too long in our case.
Coming to the food, we had steamed chicken momos and chicken sizzler as appetisers. Although we were discouraged to opt for the sizzler, i found it delicious, with cubes of chicken smeared in a dark gravy , an unconventional sizzler, but none the less tasty. The momos were average.
Next we had chicken fried rice, yamban chicken and fried chicken with red wine. Both the chicken dishes were extremely good. Chicken in red wine clearly had the flavour of wine and the yamban chicken had a flavour i tasted nowhere before,but was very good. The quantity of fried rice was sufficient for the two of us. The virgin mojito was refreshing and went well with our food.
Prices are on the higher side i believe, but the food makes up for it.
Overall i was very satisfied with the meal we had, and glad that Krystal chopsticks has kept up its reputation.
A highly recommend place to go with family/friends or even with a special person.

Most Calcutta neighbourhoods have a Krystal Chopstick like place these days, whether new or old, serving up almost similar quality food, in the very, very stagnant Indian Chinese food- scape in Calcutta. That sums up the review basically - average food, standard menu, a few good dishes, and reasonable pricing (it's only unique feature being a birds show-case in a comfortable waiting area). If you are the Gariahat shopping-hopping kinds like me, drop by. Else, skip.

If there is one place, in South Kolkata that has a character of its own this is it. From the large waiting area with the budgerigar birds to the exquisite menu. Few restaurants serve such diversity. Pork duck crabs squid apart from stock chicken and lamb, and not to forget vegetables. The quantity is humongous. The flavours delectable. Having eaten here umpteenth no of times and with scores of people this is a restaurant which reserved a fond place in our collective consciousness. This is a place which needs to be experienced and not read about

A perfect example of a good restaurant on the throes of death.

Late night visit.Only one table was occupied.

Good ambience but unchanged for the last 20 years.

The bird enclosure is one of a kind at the entrance.

This was a fine restaurant which opened in the mid nineties and served decent,value for money food at an upscale ambience,much before the mainland China,red hot chilli peppers of the world.

We ordered Chinese toasts,mixed chow mien,chicken fried rice,chilli pork and schezwan chicken.

Toast was the best of the lot.

Rice was good but dry.

Chowmein was average.

Chicken was below average.

The pork was bad since there was no pork,only fat ( see picture )

Like all Kolkata establishments without direction,they were in a hurry to close shop than to cater to customers.

But on complaining they did not bill us for the pork dish.

Regrets.

One of the better chinese restaurants in its locality and offers a pretty decent value for money experience. Food is very tasty and delicious,quantity is adequate for all kinds of hungry souls!!It is located in Gariahat right in the lane beside  the Kimbadanti shop. Ambiance is decent and food is served rather quickly. The only drawback of this place is the comfort of the seats. There are no sofas and you have to manage with cushioned iron chairs which are not very comfortable to say the least. But overall a good place to be at and enjoy delicious chinese food at a reasonable price.

I had actually deprived myself from jotting a review on Krystal chopsticks by searching a competitor to the taste but I give up as they have an edge over others 
The place to be for good Kolkata  rich Chinese/Mongolian cuisine. Infact I will appease the  food connoisseur when I say that it's one of the authentic yet palatable Chinese food . This place can arguably stand up as one amongst the good sea food joints of kolkata and the calamari served here is lip smacking and crunchy fresh . The noodles and the gravies wriggle in taste of the Chinese spices and sauces without the killer msg  .
Oh yes I will make a historical faux pas if I miss out on the tender lambs which makes you feel that the etymology of lamb in black bean sauce is at Krystal chopsticks 
Be there to use the CHOPSTICKS to gulp down the KRYSTAL taste .

It's located in a very prominent place and I 've found myself trudging up to it, after a long days of shopping at Gariahat. Staff is professional, ambience is good. Seating capacity is less though. Food is pretty good. I loved their fish in black bean sauce and fish sizzler. There food has a tendency of being a little on the sweet side, but they would customize it to suit your taste buds.

Featured in casual dinning and a bit underrated. It should be in legendary. Restaurants. My rating says I have a very good experience to share. Something like that. First day we spotted it out  easily at Hindustan park. Their behaviour was very warm, pleasant, homely. We accidentally came to know that they arrange candle-light dinner every Wednesday. That experience was really really special. A dinner in dim light in cold december night. Enough said.
Interior decoration is very classy. I found this place peaceful. Until a group of college students entered. :s well that's okay, when I have fire in my belly and such good food in front of me, I can ignore every aspects of this world. 

This is one of my favourite restaurants judged by quality of food. I don't know why it is underrated, as an often visitor, I found no issues here. Neither with the food, nor environment. First Wednesday there was a small gift from them. 

Tried starters like fried chicken wings, crispy thread chicken, red pepper chicken. Havent tried noodles yet. In main course I already gave these dishes a try like mixed, chicken, schezwan, pork fried rice, delicious side dishes like schezwan lamb (very spicy and smelling good like hell, must try this), shredded lamb with green pepper and red chilly, pork in hot garlic sauce, some of the chicken items, duck in oyster sauce full and some dishes i forgot. Rest of our food was packed very well when we couldn't eat more. I love  the deserts. Vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate sauce was the special attraction of this place for me. Wish to try their crab and squid.

Nice place to have good Chinese food with family and friends. With a good mood and a well decorated restaurant. The only problem is that it serves food very late. The best part of the restaurant is the weighing room with birds.

I'm going to jump right on to the review this time. 

Chilly Garlic Squid- I can't be a good judge of this as it was my first squid dish. I loved it. 

Cantonese Roast Pork- Loved it. Basically because I'm all for pork. 

Chilly Duck- Wasn't the first choice duck dish, our first two choices were unavailable. This one was bad though. 

Fried Wings- Awesome. That's the word. 

Chicken Singapore Noodles- Liked it. 

Overall, the food was nice. I'd want them to do something about the availability issue.

The food is delicious and made to perfection.
Every dish has a unique scent and flavour that is like no other Chinese restaurant in town.
I have been to China and have realized that much of the food here is actually how you get it in China.
The ambience is pretty nice. It provides a soothing calmness and comfort.

I dont like spicy food and for people like me, I recommend:
# hoisin pork
# korean lamb
# pineapple lamb
# crab sweet corn soup
# cantonese roast pork (a bit spicy)

Visited this place this afternoon, with a friend. The ambience was good, but it tends to get a bit crowded, and noisy since a lot of children seem to accompany their parents, specially on weekends. Surprisingly, a neighbouring restaurant is not so crowded, even at peak hours. The only explanation could be the food, which was comparatively more yummy and fresh, here. We had ordered for Hakka chicken noodles and Honey chicken, both of which were delicious. The quantity was decent as well. However I ¬†found the place a bit dark. There was some creative and authentic Chinese decor, which was hardly visible in the dim lights. Over-all, this is a pretty decent place, which has a pocket-friendly, but, varied menu and relatively fast service.

Visited Krystal Chopsticks on my mother's birthday for a family dinner and was really impressed with the food. Being a Chinese cuisine freak i loved the food. The place is well decorated and the ambience is average i would say. Wish they had played some music. The service is prompt and fast for sure. The portion sizes are average, though it was enough for our little family of four :)

They serve good squids and hence when you visit this place give it a shot !  üòä

Being a chinese food fanatic, I was really excited to try this place at Gariahat. The ambience and service are really good. The starters were satisfactory at most, with the Red Pepper Chicken being the exception, thus deserving a special mention. The main course was pretty standard, but the lamb and duck preparations are exceptionally good. Overall, a good place to have dinner with the entire family.

If you're in search for tasty Chinese, you've come to the right place. Like many restaurants, Krystal Chopstick is also well-decorated. It is bigger inside than it would appear outside. 
The side dish preparations are really tasty. For a sweet tasting side dish, honey chicken is a very good option. Garlic chicken and lemon chicken would be a bit bland. Hunan chicken and Dragon chicken are quite spicy. Another recommendation would be the chicken in red wine. All their side dishes are worth a try. A conversation with the waiter should help you pick a dish that suits your taste buds.
The staff could be less morose, though. And fast service never killed anyone.

The place has a lot of nostalgic importance. In some distant past as a college student I didn't have much money and my cousin sister was upset and wanted to go out and have lunch. So I took her to this place... We loved the food generally and this place has become a part of our lives. Whenever she is down to Calcutta... We two always go there...
The food is decent... Not extraordinary but quite palatable....
The soups are good and love the chicken drumsticks and shredded lamb.

Krystal Chopstick has been in my neighbourhood since the time I was really young and now I am ancient so I guess this place has been around for quite some time. 
Once upon a time before fancy restaurants started cropping up in each and every corner of Kolkata, Krystal chopsticks was really the "it" Chinese place! 
Their American chopsuey, their lemon chicken ( an all time favourite) their chicken Hakka chowmein and their chilli Chicken has always fascinated my family and me over the years! Be it a take away or a restaurant visit, for any occasion this was our first and last choice! Their decor has mostly remained the same. 
A giant glass window with lots of chirpy birds are the first things that used to catch my attention whenever I walked inside the place. 
But the last time I visited this place with my cousin and sister I was rather shocked & downright disgusted at their service and "hygienic condition" since then I didn't dare to step inside this place! 
We ordered chicken sweet corn soup which was served along with some body hair, which they changed promptly, upon complaining..then they served chicken noodles again which came with hair, we got really fed up and left the place!! 
May God bless the chef and his alarming hair fall condition!  Basically moral of the story is after that incident I didn't dare to step inside again but I do keep reading in zomato about their so called amazing food & service but I will be honest...I am scared ..very very scared to try their food ever again.

Visited Krystal chopsticks recently and I was very impressed with there food. I am a big fan of Chinese cuisine and this place does serve some really nice Chinese food.  But I will suggest u to sit and eat in the restaurant rather than ordering for home deliveries as they have a habit of serving lesser quantity while doing home deliveries.

I had been there quite a few times , recent one being during Durga Puja. It's one of the cheapest and most preferred restaurant in Gariahat, known for its good food in affordable rates. We had gone there during the Durga puja. Honestly, we had not kept any expectation as it's that time of the year when the rush is more and quality automatically decreses. But we were quite pleased with the food, and the prompt service. Ambiance, well it's nothing extraordinary, but it's clean and likeable. It was good to know, they still had maintained their quality standard.

Located at a very convenient position just at the brim of Hindustan Park and Gariahat connector , as per reviews Krystal Chopstick is one of the sought out Chinese restaurant of Kolkata . But from my personal experiences  quality of the food  is little bit demeaning pertaining to its standard .  We ordered a Chicken sizzler , fish in housin sauce and noodles.   Although the food is edible  special mention  is the fish in housin sauce which has a peculiar smell  like a rotten fish . On the contrary the ambience is calm , serene lit up with dim lights ,with the chinese wall hangings flanked by different posters of Chinese monarchy pitched against the walls.  On entering the restaurant u will b welcomed by 2 gigantic laughing Buddhas  with their million dollar smiles giving it a fresh feel incorporated by the Chinese restaurant. Nevertheless a good  restaurant with very average food quality.

Poor quality of food served. We ordered a simple chicken Hakka noodle, garlic chicken and fresh lime soda. I believe all of which are easiest Chinese dishes that one generally doesn't mess up. However, the noodle felt stale as if it was cooked hours ago and simply refried and served. The garlic chicken was sweet..how on earth. The fresh lime soda way too sweet. In fact a bad experience in terms of food. I will think twice about going again. The only saving grace was the server who was all smiles throughout. Nice behavior and conduct.

I have loved this place from when I was a kid. Their waiting room a bird hosiery which to a kid is quite fascinating. So you don't have to worry Abt ur child getting cranky as u wait for a table , which is possible as it gets quite crowded and they dont take phone reservations. Their overall decor and ambience shouts feudal China and has a very sober and soothing effect. 
Food has always been awesome over here. And they have maintained it for I guess more than 15 20 years. To list a few must try items -
Chicken wings , golden fried prawns, chimney soup, noodles, their chef spcl chk and fish. Very tasty food and I guarantee that you and your family will have a lovely evening. It's a no booze joint always has been so might not want to come with your drinking buddies. Do bring ur wife , mommy and daddy along for a bit of family time

An old restaurant, but one which is always crowded due to its convenient location in the heart of Gariahat. I have been to this place on numerous occasions for quick dinners since its extremely close to my house. Food has never disappointed me, and has not decreased in quality or quantity over the years. However, the quality of service remains inversely proportional to the number of people. They are not very good at handling very large orders which take a lot of time to get delivered. The food however is delicious and will leave you satisfied. I would especially recommend their Cantonese style spicy chicken and the red pepper chicken starter (I do not remember the exact name) which are exceptionally good.

A fantastic place for chinese in South Kolkata. Abstract paintings, dim lights and a small bird gallery, which are changed on a regular monthly basis,¬† adorn the ambience inside.¬† Coming to the food, this is the place to be if you want a nice first impression for your appetizers/starters, be it the soups especially hot n sour, tomato, or starters like crispy chilly babycorn or spring roll¬† (sorry since i am a vegetarian i won't be able to comment on the non-veg items) . After an impressing start,¬† the main course dishes that i have found awesome¬† are Veg chopsuey, Veg manchurian/Chilly Paneer with fried rice/hakka chowmein.¬† Recently, i had a bad experience with their sizzlers. These people serve fried pakodas placed over cabbage leaves on a wooden base named Chinese Veg sizzler. The service is very slow irrespective of the fact whether its crowded or not. So keep some time in your hand before entering inside. An ideal place for dinner than lunch i would say.

Located in the lane right opposite to Basanti devi college, adjacent to kimbadanti this little but packed restaurant serves some best Chinese food in the town. Quiet, dimly lit place with a sober decor and equally sober crowd of gariahat, its a perfect place for family eating, get together.
The food is in one word delicious. I have been there a few times. The momo they serve as starters is perfect, soft juicy meat n veggie filled, perhaps the best in town. You may try the sizzler starters, its the item u want with minimal salad served on a sizzling pan, not your typical continental sizzlers though. Not my favourite.
I prefer the fried rice over the chowmein served there. In side dish my favs are red pepper shredded lamb n Thai prawn. Both are exceptionally spicy n hot (one may order at his own risk, esp the Thai prawn). The lamb dishes here is unlike every other place, soft, tender n juicy. You should order a lamb dish here. 

PS cost for 2 ppl will be 1300 approx.

We visited recently as a family and while the food was okay and sumptuous, the service was awful. The waiters behave like government office clerks and are quite high-handed. There were long waits in between dishes. The dishes were of good quantity (standard Chinese fare) and kept the children busy. But then the next course will take long to appear, so long that my children and their father went to look at the birds that are kept in a glass aviary (which is quite pleasant actually) and then they would return to the table (where I am sitting to wait the arrival of the dish) and still the dish wouldn't come. In a neighboring table, someone ordered dessert and left without eating it because of the inordinate delay.

Ocean fish and the fish fingers should not be missed for starters. Mixed fried rice with chicken in oyster sauce and Cantonese chicken is my favorite there. Also the chicken and mushroom and the prawns are delicious. With simple yet cozy ambiance and colorful birds welcoming the guests, it serves quite a large number of people on a daily basis. Quality food. One of my favorite Chinese restaurants at the present time.

Very good quality and quantity of Chinese food is available. Service is very good. I think you can try any of the items available in the menu card because all preparations that are available are very good. All staves there are very friendly. It's location is very good car parking is also available infront of the restaurant. Interior decoration is also very nice. It's a family restaurant.

Located in Hindustan park, this restaurant was on my wish list for a long time and finally when I visited this joint I was completely awestruck and overwhelmed and by now I am almost a regular here. This restaurant is heavenly spacious and probably one of the biggest restaurant in the locality as far as size is concerned. The interiors are completely extravagent, from the lights, the cozy furniture, to the wall color, then the masterpiece paintings everything were class apart and complements each other. They offer a wide variety of authentic Chinese cuisines. Their offerings has that perfect distinguished aroma of Chinese dish, perfect balance of condiments and sauces, in short complete heaven for the taste buds. The proportions served here are also more than sufficient and the prices are also within the reasonable range. Overall an ideal restaurant to savor authentic Chinese cuisines in an imperial ambience.

This place is an old favourite of mine. The food is somewhere between good and bad. Some items are really good while others are just average. I like their Chicken Momo, lamb items and soups. The amount of food that they serve is good. The ambiance seems nice as always. Food quality has deteriorated over the years. Price is okay, considering the location of this restaurant.¬†

Tip: Try to avoid their sizzlers.

Well one of the best retaurants in the Gariahat area, it's located in the Lane opposite of Basanti devi college.. The Place is really very good in terms of food and the ambience is nice as well but when its crowded the service becomes very slow.. Been there twice.. Its a great place to visit with family and friends...

Now coming to the quality of food... even in extremely busy days they don't compromise with the food quality... and that's a plus point of this place.. 

Last time i visited the place with my family & moreover we all like to have spicy food(Bangals After all).... So for starter we ordered Red pepper Chicken, Fried Thread Chicken and Chicken spring roll.... All were really good specially Red pepper chicken as it was more spicier than the rest...

For the main course we had Mixed noodles and ordered Schezwan Chicken, Spicy chicken Cantonese style, Thai chicken, Red pepper fish & Spicy fish Schezwan style so that we could taste a bit all these dishes...

And we weren't dissapointed at all.. All the dishes were really good...When we entered the place we all were very hungry and after having the food we all left the place very satisfied..

The waiters are helpful and are well behaved...¬†

I'll surely visit the place again for some tasty food...

See this is one of those old-school places you love going to if you're a South Kolkatan.I have been coming here since I was 6, and this place has always been pretty damn good. By far one of the oldest Chinese joints in the city, nestled up right inside Hindustan Park. Perfect place to go to if you're tired from all the Pujo shopping or pandal-hopping in and around Gariahat.Their Chicken Noodles are to die for. Plus, the Sweet and Sour Chicken is something I've been loving for 14 years now. They've recently introduced the Schezwan Rice which is really nice too.The ambiance is typical Chinese-restaurant type, and the huge cage of birds at the entrance is quite wonderful to watch.A nice place, on the whole.

With a range of mouthwatering Chinese dishes that it offers, the ambience is as fine as the food. It is very cosy to the extent of being almost overcrowded, when all the tables are occupied. However, Krystal Chopstick is quite overpriced with respect to the quantity of food and the service of the same.

Getting to the food, i had simple stuff. Chicken not pork, but the quality was good. But the quantity is disappointing. 

In terms of taste i love the soups here. 
Situated in a prime location in gariahat , in the lane of Kinnor kinnori this is a good place to grab your lunch. But I do not like the quantity in terms of the price

I think this place is a bit too crammed up, and does not really provide you much privacy. Overpriced as hell, didn't really like the quality of food that much either. Definitely not worth the price!

One of those restaurants which I have frequented so many times that I have actually lost its count. It holds a special place in my heart as I went there a day after I got my first job!! First thing - the ambiance.  I find it quite cozy, really clean, and the waiting area has a bird enclosure which children really enjoy. The food is definitely above average, some of the items being really great! I am a big fan of the Schezwan Chicken and Korean Lamb served here. Also, the American Chopsuey is one of my favorites here. Not many places can make this dish as perfect as they do! And the food here is quite rightly priced as well.
The hospitality of the waiters is something that needs some improvement. The manager kind of reminds me of our strict school principal! But none the less I have never been able to ignore this place! So please do pay a visit and you won't be disappointed I believe. Cheers!

This Chinese eatery stands bang opposite the Basanti Devi College in Gariahat,in the alley of the Hindustan Park locality.
I had visited this restaurant on a rainy day in August,and the treat was worth every penny paid.
The ambience is pretty good-offering a pleasant view to the interior decorations inside.The staff were very polite and service was very much up to the mark.
For Chinese Delicacies one can try the Chicken Soup, Chicken Spring roll and Drums of Heaven for starters.
For the main course I chose the Cantonese Chicken(a super speciality over here) and the regular Chicken Hakka Chowmein.
I have never tasted the Pork here,so won't comment on it.
If you are visiting this place for the first time you can opt for the prawn preparations and the Schezwan Chicken.
The desserts include the normal Ice-creams which I didn't have because of the dear price.
An alternative will be to visit this place on a rainy October afternoon, when the silence of the raindrops adds a nostalgic effect, to the dinning.

The tables were too close to each other and the ambience was not good. The food quality was poor .

Visited this place with my friends few days back .... on recommendation from my friend who was with us too on that day as well ..... :) .... locationwise it was not at all difficult to find this one .....being opposite to basanti devi college near gariahat .......
We went there mainly to try out squid ....along with duck and pork as well ....... but unluckily , squid was out of stock before 8:30pm .......
I tried Hoisai Pork .....Shredded Lamb with green pepper and red chilli .... Duck with ginger sauce ..... and Red pepper chicken .....along with mixed fried rice and chowmein ....... lamb and duck prep was so-so ....... i have tried out duck preparation in other places like Benjarong (in South CIty) which was better compared to this one ..... and better lamb prep as well in places like Punjaab (park street) ...... Redpepper chicken was quite good ......... Hoisai Pork had a combination of sweet and sour taste ,and was crispy as well ..... overall i liked it ........ 
Talking about quantity , its quite good ....one plate fried rice or chowmein will easily suffice one person on an avg ...but there's a catch :) .....on seeing a full plate of fried rice, initially u might be fooled into thinking that its huge .....but after u start taking in rice into your plate, u realize that the shape of the dish (in which it was served) is designed in such a way to make u think like so (coz the bottom surface of the dish is curved back inside ..... go and check it out for yourself u will understand) :)
Ambience inside is appreciable as well ....... serving time can be a scope of improvement though ......
Maybe i would like to visit it again for the squid item which was missed out that day .....

we went there for birthday treat. my birthday treat. 3 of us went there yesterday. there were other 2 family.most palces were vacant. ambience z 4.5/5 and the waiter was good as he helped us a bit.

for starters we took crispy thread chicken and chkn hot and sour soup and both were really good. liked both very much. then for the main course we took mixed rice noodles, cicken singapore noodles , chicken yamban and lamb with green pepper and red chilly. rice noodles and yamban chicken were delicious. especially  the yamban chicken. i must add a thing. people can also try fried chicken in red wine. yesterday i didnt have this but here this dish also tastes fav!...coming back to yesterday... yamban was pretty good. quantities of all dishes were good. then the singapore noodles and lamb was a setback. i felt the singapore  noodles could have been a bit oily. may it z the way singapore noodles are prepared but i didnt lyk much. and lamb was also not very tasty. it was ok.it had shredded lamb. I kinda xpected peices. and due to shredded lamb , i think it slightly tasted like chiken in red chilly..i would have given 4 but due to the lamb i had to reduce 0.5 marks

paid 1650/- incuding vat and tip... this z a wonderful place to try but do order after knowing the dish!..:P.

and again pics are not good as taken on mobile.

Krystal Chopstick serves one of the best Chinese in the Gariahat area. I visited this restaurant along with family on several occasions and have always found them to be good and quite prompt with their service. My personal recommendations include- mixed chimney soup, which is a great way to kick off your gastronomical journey. their pork momos are good too, if you love pork and wanna try it out here. The Peking Lamb, chilly pork and chilly garlic squid are some of the other items which I like. In case you are wondering about the place, do give it a try. Its not going to disappoint you, even if it doesnt manage to hook you.

Went there last week to celebrate my friend's birthday. The place is located inside the lane opposite to Basanti Devi College. Our first choice was Hatari for that night's dinning out but unable to get seat there we moved to this place. The decor and ambience of the resturant is good. We got table for six within 5 to 10 minutes.¬†
The first this that welcomes you when you enter the restaurant is a waiting launge and on the right wall of the launge there is huge glass cage where the have kept birds for amusements of the waiting guests. I strongly disliked the concept of keeping the birds in a cage.¬†
There are tables with different sitting capacities we got a table whice was made for 6 people by joining tables for 4 and 2 persons the seats are of wrought iron which were not comfortable.¬†
Coming to the food; we ordered¬†
Starters
1 Crispy Lamb:- Absolutely dry thinner then the thinnest lamb pieces coated in a batter and fried; taste aweful¬†
1 Chilly Wings:- Juicy soft well made wings tossed in a sauce; taste good

Main Course
1 Lamb with Green Onion:- Thin lamb strips tossed with green onion in light sauce; taste so-so
1 Thai Chicken:- we wanted to order Korean Chicken but the staff said it would be sweet so we sifted to thai chicken, its very hot. You dont get the heat while eating but its hits you afterwards; taste blunt¬†
1 Spicy Chicken Manchurian Style:- modarate chicken pieces very normal taste
3 Mixed Rice Noodles (with no pork and prawns):- almost no veggies just few chicken pieces and fired egg; taste no good¬†
1 Schezwan fried rice:- very normal nothing extra ordinary
1 mixed fried rice :- good

The bill came around 3000 rupees. The food was nothing extra ordinary considering the price, we found atleast 2 to 3 whole dry red chilly almost in every starter dishes and gravy dishes. The staffs were almost non functional, when we asked a staff to serve the food he served us 2 dishes and gave other dishes a miss. The glasses were laying empty no body bothered to fill the up utill we asked then to. The only plus side of the restaurant that it is positioned very stratigically but quality and price is a major let down.

Frequented this place since college days, mainly because it's very close to a friends house and I recommend the chimney soup, fried crab in exotic sauce, fried prawns in wine and tomyum soup. When I visited last week though the food tasted good and the ambiance was very nice (special candlelight dinner for diners) I must admit I was a little dissapointed at the tiny bit of metal wire found in the momos. Also ordered chicken chowmein (gravy) as take away but got hakka chow instead. Still the staff were kind and apologetic, giving us a discount for the inconvenience/ trouble.

The decorations of the place is good. It has a bird cage in the waiting space which keeps the waiters entertained. Which is very important. Cause they took almost 30-40mins in preparing just two dishes for take away when i went to this restaurant for the first time.  Even when they said it would take just 15mins at the time of order.  
However, the food quality was fairly good. Had ordered veg spring roll & chilli babycorn to have for evening snacks with friends at home. Both the dishes were good. Which partly compensates for making me wait that long. But still. I wish the restaurant could improve its management skills or atleast say the approx time that they would take to prepare the dishes in such cases. And not test the customer's patience.

i have been to this place twice, and last time i visited yesterday. they have obviously improved a lot in between. it is located in a very popular spot, just opposite gariahat basanti devi college. their inside decors and stuffs are very impressive. my intention to visit here was to have squid, but it was finished before 9 pm.

in food, i have tried red pepper chicken, mixed rice and chowmein, duck in ginger sauce, hoisai pork, lamd in red pepper and green chilli. the red pepper chicken was very good. the other main courses are quite good to have except the pork which one they made too sweet and the duck, which had more bones than flesh. but as a whole, the experience was good.
now i have few points to highlight here:
1. they should increase the quantity, else the price looks a bit higher compared to quantity.
2. their inside space is very less.
3. they should add more non-veg starter items (other than soups) in their menucard.
4. their service is quite slow, even a normal dish takes around 30 mins to get processed...

The decor is stereotypical but well-done 'Oriental', with miniature Buddhas placed in greeting on the fringes of the lobby, and 'Chinese' traditional paintings decking up the walls. Not to mention the lamps and lighting. The seating is very comfortable. But the food: the noodles has been sufficiently tender and easily miscible with the sides everytime I've been there; chicken is tender, and the dishes I have on repeat - the garlic, the honey - have delivered the exact measure of sweet or spice I've desired. It is fine chinese fare thus far. The pork is as glorious as it is in most good Chinese places - the moment the fat dissolves on the tip of my tongue I compulsively want and devour more, with scoops of the gravy along with a helping of noodles. I'm no expert on the methodology involved but I will keep coming back to this place. It serves some of the best varities of what is flat-out one of my favorite resturant cuisines anywhere in the world.

The starters are good, gives high for the main course. Although good the food contains too much oil that goes for both chicken and lamb side dishes as well as the noodles. The souffle was horrible it felt like frozen chocolate. The chocolate momo with vanilla icecream was a treat though. The ambience is nice soothing and the service is impeccable.

We odered for a chicken spring rolls... Which were like one of the best I have ever had! The next was a crispy chicken which was just perfect! For main course we ordered a fried rice which was good along with a fried fish in lemon sauce... The fish was nothing great but yes edible! We ended our meal with choco pudding which was a hit amongst us! Good service and as mum says "nostalgic ambience"

Long before I first went there, I fell in love with the name of this place. This is a small place which serves only chinese food. The quality I have always liked, but their quantity never satisfied me. Especially when I think of hatari 2 stops from there which surprises you with their overwhelming quantity. If you have never been to this place, it is worth a one time visit.. Tastes do vary from tongue to tongue. So you might become a regular visitor after that. When it comes to me, I do not visit this place anymore as I have far too many cheaper, yet better options.

i have been here quite a few times and i like the food. i like chinese and after mainland china, this is the place i would recommend always for good chinese food. last time i visited, we took chicken sweet corn soup for my son who liked it very much. it was full of soft chicken and corn. amount was decent. in  the sides, we ordered red pepper chicken, which was spicy and hot. in the main course we had chicken garlic noodles and chicken fried rice. noodle was hakka, hence well fried. they used good fine rice for the fried rice. their pork items are worth mentioning, specially the pork in hot garlic sauce. it was tangy and the pork meat was very tender. along with that we also tried fish in lemon sauce, which was a bit more sweet than what i expected, then fried chicken with cashew that tasted very good as well. the interior is soothing with not too dim lights. staff here are friendly and always come to your table with smile. quantity of each platter is enough for two. this is a value for money restaurant so, it should be a must visit if you are a chinese lover.

KC is one place where i can go and eat my heart out. The place hasn't changed much over the years which in a way isn't good but i kind of like it at times, gives me a nostalgic feel.

Located in hindusthan park near gariahat crossing opposite Indthalia, it is a pretty big restaurant though might not look so at first sight but accommodates quite a few people. There is quite some rush during meal hours any day of the week. The decor is average but seats are comfortable. There is big display of birds near the entrance which is loved by everyone i know but i am personally not comfortable with caged birds so dont like it. The staff service is a bit slow and one needs to poke them quite a few times to get ur wishes addressed.

Coming to food i like their spring rolls and crispy chilli babycorn, wanton soups. The hakka noodles and garlic fried rice are pretty well prepared and i love them accompanied by a spinach oriental or mixed vegetabe in hot garlic sauce. The spinach oriental is their mixed vegetable prepared in sweet and spicy sauce with a nice flavour from the orange juice added to it.  It tastes amazing but i would suggest one should ask chef to give lesser cherries in the same coz otherwise they create trouble while eating.

I feel the preparation has lost that flavour over the period of time alongwith deteriorating standards of service. Yet the generous servings at pretty pocket friendly prices eventually do not disappoint and give you your money's worth.

I get nostalgic on hearing the name as there was once a time when Chinese dinner meant Krystal Chopsticks to my family. The food is good, the ambience nice, they still have the different colored birds near the lobby which I used to count when I was small. A few items worth mentioning are their chimney soup, yambam chicken, chilli Turkey (not on regular menu) etc... The pricing is fair too.. Overall a recommended place if you are on a budget..

Visited ths place last year during the pujas with my friends.. I was shocked to find around 20 people waiting outside.. I remember waiting for more than 2 hours to get in.. But once we got in and the food came, we forgot that we had to wait for so long and were quite pissed.. The chinese food they serve is to die for.. The prices are high but when it comes to their quality and quantity, you dont wanna complain abt the high prices.. Service was good too.. Would like to visit it soon.. :-)

Located near Gariahat, the restaurant Krystal Chopstick is one of the several Chinese cuisine restaurants in the area. The restaurant is not a budget friendly one and seems to be extremely pricey from its competitors.

Food is nothing special in fact quite ordinary. You do have some good starters, but again they are very pricey than other restaurants. Main course dishes such as Chicken Fried Rice or Chicken Hakka Chowmein neither look special nor taste any good. Other gravy dishes such as Chilli Chicken are descent. Fish, Prawn, Crab, Duck and Squid preparations are also available here.

Service is descent. Ambiance and decor is nice and interiors have been done very well which is a treat to eyes. Home delivery is also available however food is somewhat cold when delivery is done, which spoils the taste horribly. Prices are a major concern and if kept on the lower side, Krystal Chopstick is nice restaurant overall.

So, overall a descent Chinese restaurant that adds to the flavor of Gariahat. There are many scopes of improvement and improvisations they can make to improve their food and services.

Definitely among the ten best Chinese restaurants in Kolkata. The only minus point is the service which seriously leaves much to be desired. The decor and ambience is perfect for anything ranging from a business meeting to a family outing or even a friends gathering. Even the birds across the waiting lounge provides a distraction in case of a que.

Inside the lane opposite to Basanti Devi College, there resides this pricey little average Chinese restaurant named as Krystal Chopstick. This visit was a mixed one at best but considering the pocket pinch, sadly I have to put the experience to be a disappointing one.

Three of us went there a few days back on a sudden urge and the main incentive was the availability of squid on their menu. We were also interested to see lamb prepared in Chinese style. Upon entering the place, the ambiance grabs you as being calm and soothing & on that hot April afternoon it was a welcome change from the heat outside.

The starter, Red Pepper Squid came first and we only later realized that it was going to be the highlight of the meal. The squid was fried and cooked and seasoned well. Squids go rubbery on cooling down if not cooked properly and we were happy to observe that such was not the case and the dish was very entertaining. However, the mains we received shortly after, Chicken Noodles and Chicken Fried Rice, were bland and way way below average. They lacked any kind of taste. We took Chilly Garlic Pork and Shredded Lamb with Green Pepper and Red Chilly on the sides. These were pretty okay in taste and pretty high in quantity but nothing to write home about. Also surprisingly, except the texture of the meat, both the dishes tended to taste similar.

While the quantity is definitely merry, the prices charged is exorbitant. Our total bill for these 5 dishes were 1445/- (and about 240/- went down only in taxes!!). Every dish is overpriced by about 30-50 rs and you could find better dishes in lower price ranges in other restaurants. I also felt that the waiters were under trained and from a distance they were always trying to keep a probing eye on you instead of granting you a certain privacy.

All in all, its a nice looking place with inconsistent food available at a high price. Visit at your own risk.

I went here during poojo last year. 
Ordered chicken Hakka and sweet and sour pork . 
Had to wait for half an hour to get a place , which is fine cus it was during poojo . 
The food took about 30more mins .. 
Initially I thought I would order the crab but they didn't have it .. After a pretty long wait the food was there . 
Chicken Hakka - 2.5/5 
Sweet n sour pork - 3/5 
Expense - 3.5/5 
Service - 2/5 
Over all - 3/5 
Not a place I highly recommend ,but you can surely drop by.

I have visited this place many times and have always come back satisfied. But last week when I went there with a friend I was completely disillusioned. We ordered for Singapore fried rice and Prawn in red wine. The noodles had so much chillies in them that it was impossible to eat them at all. As did the prawn. Scehzwan Chinese cooking is supposed to have chillies, but this was like hot Indian curry. Please note Mr. Chef‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. adding extra chillies does not enhance the taste of the dish, it just draws away attention from its main ingredients. Finally we had to order some more chowmein which they made without any chillies and we finished our meal. But I will think many times before visiting this place again. Btw, all across the world the dish 'Singapore noodle' is made of rice noodles and has a serving of veg/chicken etc in white sauce poured over it. If you are changing the dish please be kind enough to rename it so we do not get confused. Sorry to point this out.

Krystal Chopstick - The name itself is sweet :) The use of K in place of C , makes the name pretty unique.

Its situated at gariahat(hindustan park), very easy to locate and situated in a much peaceful locality.
The servers are jolly and attends with a smile.

Its essentially a chinese restaurant.
The dishes to try out are - Chilly babycorn or chilly mushroom as starters ( both are real chilly and tasty :P )
American chopsuey and mixed fried rice would be efficiently enough for 3 persons. Its really well prepared. You can try chilly fish or schezwan chicken, both the fish and chicken are pretty yummy :D

Also try the chilly squid if possible it also tasted nice :)

Overall a sweet and nice restaurant to enjoy tasty chinese :)

For shoppers who often throng to Gariahat and are lovers of Chinese food, this joint is an obvious go-to option.Krystal Chopstick has been around for ages and this was my maiden visit.Sounds strange but true given the fact that i happen to be a resident of South Kolkata. But this joint somehow slipped out of my radar.But at last managed to make amends today.
I dropped in at round noon only to find  that i was the first visitor of the day.Decor and ambiance was fine with dim lighting and the usual Chinese paintings and artifacts.Waiters were prompt and courteous.They did a fine job at recommending the right dishes, so that is an obvious plus.
Items which i tried out for take away:
1. American Chopsuey-My personal favourite. Taste was perfect and had the right balance of sweet and sour topping.
2. Fried rice in oyster sauce- The beauty of this dish was it was neither very dry nor very wet and soggy.The quantity was huge and it had a very generous sprinkling of  small bits of chicken and fried egg.
3. Garlic Fish- This dish comprised of several slices of fish-( am not too sure whether it was basa or beckty) in a thick tangy gravy. The gravy was spicy and rich in flavours. It is a gravy dish but i had asked them to make it semi-dry, something which i prefer.It was perfectly made to order.Kudos for that.
4. Fried chicken in cashew-This dish comprised of boneless pieces of chicken in a light gravy that came loaded with lots of veggies-  the likes of broccoli, spring onion, capsicum,carrot and cashew of course.I liked it though some people do not like their nuts with chicken!!! Each to his own.
All in all a very satisfying experience in terms of food taste and quantity.Prices on the slightly expensive side.I would say each dish is overpriced by 20-25 rupees.Chicken American Chopsuey priced at Rs 200 would reinforce my point.Many joints have a lower price point for this dish. I guess the buzzing location of Gariahat justifies the prices . Do drop in after your marathon  shopping  saga.

Was out for shopping in Rashbehari area with my family on a sunday.. and actually forgot about lunch time till our tummy gave us a serious call!! It was 3.30pm when we enetered Krystal Chopstick.. it was almost full.. and we were seated in the only empty table.. the ambience is nice but kind of extra darkness which I dint like.. but we were super-hungry and concentrated only on food and kept the order the simplest and ordered Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken in Oyester Sauce and Garlic Chicken.. 

Time went by chatting.. we went hungrier.. it was 4.15pm and we tried to grab the attention of the server.. he did not pay heed.. even waving hands did not work... they roamed around slowly.. served others.. but we must had done some mistake that we got unnoticed!!! it was 4.30 and no sign of our food coming in... finally we got to catch a server and asked if they were going to serve us the food in dinner!! That kind of woke them up and finally our food was served... 

They are quite good in terms of quantities I must say... we were 5 hungry souls and 3 plates of rice seemed huge! The rice tasted nice.. a little indianised I felt.. but tasted good...so was the chicken preparations.. both the chicken items tasted quite good... just a little more gravy would have made it better.. we decided to order a few fresh lime sodas to get rid of the dryness of the items.. nevertheless, they tasted good.. 

We were done with gobbling by 5pm.. the bill was decent... nothing extraordinary but nice regular chinese food.. and yes, huge improvement (read, speed) needed in their service...

A regular Chinese restaurant with excellent ice creams. Well, dessert specialty does not really count on a restaurants claim to fame. 

You can try the lamb which is always well cooked. They provide a pretty decent quantity of food and one cannot complain much about the food quality or variety. 

There is nothing extraordinary about this place. But this place won't disappoint you either. One can always visit it to try out new Chinese food places.

With the honour of being the first upmarket Chinese Restaurant in South Calcutta, Krystal Chopsticks has managed to maintain its quality and keep up with the trends for well over a decade. Unfortunately it has declined to change its tableware. It still serves everything in glass plates and bowls, presumably in order to stick to its once intricately-devised ‚ÄòKrystal‚Äô brand image. The Chopsticks too are of the same make and design that they were way back ‚Äì just a bit long in size, but fine otherwise. Although, using melamine chopsticks to eat out of an ornate glass bowl a bit ‚Äòjarring!‚Äô

It seats 50-60 in moderately comfortable chairs, and there is not more than ten feet between the entrance and the kitchen door. The menu is large and heavy abundant with choices. You can have your vegetables and meats flavoured in any of the various spices and herbs that constitute ‚ÄòIndian Chinese‚Äô. Being a high-priced eatery, the decor hasn‚Äôt kept up with the times and, probably, therefore the lighting is low.  

We started with a Seafood Coriander soup which was is fast becoming an institution in the Chinese menus the city over, just like Chilli Chicken became back in the 80‚Äôs or whenever. It was just about okay. The Chilli Pork was quite a stunner, large slices of boiled and then fried pork ‚Äì tossed in ground spices. There was a hint of Chinese Five-spice powder and a few very interesting flavours I couldn‚Äôt quite place. Most interesting! The Red Pepper Prawn was next ‚Äì large fresh prawns in a fried with a thin batter and tossed with Red Chilli Pepper and a bit of Pepper. Sounds like a bit of a tongue-burner, but it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äì quite tasty, just a little dry though and no overwhelming taste of Ginger or Garlic. The Crab Claws ‚Äì not easily found ‚Äì was, I must say, insane! Humungous round chunks of claw meat sitting on thick sharp claws deep-fried in a not-too-thick batter and tossed in a superb sweet-n-spicy sauce loaded with mild Chinese spices.  A top, top dish. 

The Mixed Cantonese noodles were a terrible disappointment ‚Äì a mush of strips of meat and a sprinkling of vegetables (mostly sliced cabbage) on a bed of oily noodles ‚Äì as unappetising as the sides were scrumptious. Should have gone with the Hakka or the Fried Rice.

The meal was well attended to by an efficient but slightly unctuous waiter. The bill was more than what we expected but being in a bit of celebratory mood, weren‚Äôt too affected. Nonetheless, I can‚Äôt say that I would go back for the experience. Maybe pack some of those lip-smacking but rather pricey sides to go.  Although the portions were large, it was pretty expensive! Oh! And they have a bird-cage in the... yes, waiting room!

So I like the ambience here but I do not like the food. Maybe it was just the wrong order that my brother gave when he treated us for his birthday but it was just not my cup of tea. I did enjoy their chilli octopus though but other than that the chicken just did not do it for me. It has been about four years since I visited the place but never have I been there again in spite of being on the lookout for a place to eat. I would have given it a 3.0 for the ambience (again it is just tolerable but too dark) but the high prices vis-a-vis the quality of food just makes me give it a 2.5.

Krystal Chopstick serves up pretty decent Indianised Chinese Cuisine. Its one of those places that has been on the Kolkata food map for ages and had suffered a bit of a slump in terms of consistency but has improved of late. I quite enjoy their Chicken Wanton or Spring Roll to start my meal with.  Chilly Chicken , Garlic Prawns , Shredded Lamb with Green Pepper and Red Chilly or Chilly Pork are good with the regular Fried Rice and Hakka Noodles which are both fairly nice. Prices are quite good and its almost always crowded with crowds who drop by after their shopping .The waiting area features a large bird enclosure which adds a nice touch to the otherwise simple decor.



----- 28 Dec, 2012 -----

Krystal Chopsticks has been around for a while now. At one point they served pretty good food consistently but in recent times their chef seems to have turned quite moody and the taste of the food varies. The standard fare is usually decent but this place can get fairly crowded due to its proximity to Gariahat. For starters the momo's , springrolls and wantons are good. For mains stick to the usual fried rice, hakka noodles and chilli chicken. The pork dishes are just about ok as the quality of the pork is not always upto the mark.Prices and quantities are good however which probably explains the continued popularity and patronage.

A regular chinese restaurant with price on the higher side. But quality is very good especially the pork. I keep coming back for their pork dishes. Meaty chunks of pork and zero pork fat. Chilli pork and Hoisin pork are my favourite. The prawn and fish dishes are also good. I love the waiting area as it features a large bird cage/enclosure which poses as a nice distraction with cute colorful birds chirping. The decore is nice and soothing. The wait stuff are attentive. A nice chinese place and potential pork lovers heaven.
P.S. Have to try their lamb and duck dishes.

I am writing a review after 9 years since I last ate here. I am doing this since I had duck today in Bangalore and remember the most awesome chilly duck I have ever had. And no brownie points for guessing that it is in Krystal Chopsticks!!!

It was a lazy Sep afternoon and visited the place with a friend. I used to stay right behind Basanti Devi at that time. We ordered Hakka chow mein and some chicken side dish. And then the chilly duck. Oh Boy I just fell in love with this place just for this dish. Other were ok. Quantity is good and price fairly reasonable.

Who cares how stupid or knowledgeable the waiters are as long as you know what you want and know your food. Recommend  ed for chilly duck. Give this a try guys!!!

Walked in for quick lunch before a meeting today. The decor was simple, but what always matters to me is the quality of food and it didn't disappoint.

It was served fast and the portions were nice. A Tasty  and filling treat it was for sure. My lunch of Spring rolls, momos and chinese chopsuey  surely tickled my taste buds enough to make me come here again when I am in the area.

I have been here from my Uni days, and although I am not too frequent here, I sometimes come here to get my lamb fix. They make a very nice shredded lamb, and I generally order that, or the Szechwan lamb, and I like both. Also, this place has a very good array of starters. On my last visit, we were a group of four people, and decided on eating fast, so asked what would come fast. The server was helpful. The vegetable hakka chow was tasty, if not spectacular and the crispy baby corn was not really crisp, which was a crib.  The honey chicken was okay, but it was way to sweet this time, compared to the last few times I remember. However, we did order Chinese chopsuey and it was very good, and in the end that sort of saved the day.

I would always repent of visiting this place this puja.Perhaps the worst chineese resturant i have ever been to...pathetic bad quality.We had ordered chicken wings which was served 30 mins later cold and perhaps from the taste of it ordered either broaster or kfc good 5-6 hours back.No lung fung or thai soup in a chineese restro really did surprise me.Food is excessively over priced for the quality and quantity offered.Ambience and decor is is quite ordinary.Staff will  stupidly recommend you  sezwan chicken and chilli chicken  and fried rice on being asked for starters.Lastly i would seriously ask people to visit indthalia which is diagonally opposite to this place which offers better food at fair price, but then again there are people who swear by chilli chicken and fried rice.

Krystal Chopstick is easy to locate.It's in the Kimabanta lane,the one opp to Bashanti Debi college.
I went there with a group of friends on a Durga Puja afternoon.

We ordered:
1.Schezwan Chicken
2.Mixed Hakka Chowmein
3.Mushroom pork.

Even though it was puja time,all of the above dishes were quite tasty,price was reasonable and the ambiance was pretty average.The mixed chowmein had thick pork fat which I hated.I especially loved the pork mushroom dish!The quantity of schezwan chicken could be increased I felt,otherwise I cannot complain about the quantity of other dishes.

I'd love to revisit !

visited the place on 11/8/2013 for dinner.

we were 3 of us and visited the restaurant for dinner. the restaurant was not crowed. they were only few people having dinner. we ordered for 2 mixed noddles , 1 chicken with mushroom and babycorn & 1 chili chicken. Also we ordered for 2 diet coke. after placing the order it took 50 mins for them to serve the food. we have to keep checking with the lobby manager for how long it would take. every time he kept answering 10 mins and which made the food to come after 50 mins. the waiters were extremely unprofesionals and untidy. Some of them were smelling badly , they were signing hindi songs while serving food. the experince was pathetic.

This place is a family favourite,particularly my mother's. So it goes without saying that we drop by atleast 5 to 6 times a month. 
Foodwise,I'd say it serves pretty decent Chinese in a moderate price range. The portions are good and fulfilling. The flavours rich and distinctive. 
A personal favourite of mine is Chicken in Red Wine,paired with any order of rice or noodle,though given my buds' craving for the spicy taste, I always end up with either Chilly Garlic Noodles or Schezwan Rice. 
For starters,the Spring Chicken with Sweet Chilli-Garlic Dip and the family-portion soup called Steam Boat deserve special mention. 
Desert is nothing special here,though one could end the meal with some Chinese Tea.

Krystal Chopstick was one of the first Chinese restaurants in South Calcutta. It was also distinguished by the fact that it served lamb long before other Chinese restaurants in the city caught onto this trend.

The food today is average, though most of the old items remain on their expanded menu. The Lamb with Green Onions is a personal favourite, though the pieces are no longer as soft and tender as they used to be. The squid dishes sound interesting, but squid turns rubbery very quickly if cooked badly, so it might be a bad idea to try them. Most of the other items - soups, noodles, fried rice, etc. are standard.

The ambience is good, with soft lighting and muted shades. The service is not that good. The waiters tend to ignore you even if you are the only person in the restaurant. Overall, there is no particular reason to recommend this restaurant any more.

Among the few Chinese restaurants having chilli paneer on the menu. It's an amazing Chinese restaurant in gariahat which serves squid,lamb and pork which attracts me all the more. Though i found their szechuan fried rice a bit too spicy, the chicken dishes are delectable.  No complaints in terms of service or ambience. A very good place for hangout and non veg exploration!

Friends and I walked into this place for dinner during the pujas. We had to wait a while obviously, but realised after awhile that it was worth it. I've heard people complaining that food served at restaurants during the pujas are not quite as good as compared to ' other ' days. Well, was definitely not the case here. The food was served quick, it was cooked well and delicious. We had a great time there. Do come here if you're looking for a good place to eat in the Gariahat area.

This place is a legend when it comes to chinese. Hugely popular in south kolkata, this place is famous for its Chicken in Red Wine. The place is small, the decor is average. However, it is hugely populated. The reason being the food. Its one of the oldest places in south kolkata serving chinese and is visited by some of the most famous names in town. It is hugely popular for being easy on the pocket. The price is moderate and on the cheaper side. However, during the peak hours and special occasions, long waiting times are common and a spoiler with the waiting line queue stretching all the way outside and on the road.

Must try for anybody visiting Gariahat. It is just 5 mins from the Golpark Crossing and is well connected and easy to find. 

Recommended for the food !!!!!

A nice place to drop in for a meal with friends. Stick to the regular Chinese known food items and you shall have an enjoyable meal. The ambiance may not be of fine dining, but it is pretty nice for a casual meal. Have been visiting this place since childhood. It would be better if this place spaces out seating a little. Else it at times feel claustrophobic when it is crowded. Stick to more common items on the menu and you shall have an enjoyable meal.

Horrible experience!
The clear soup was definitely the worst I've ever had..in fact we cudn't even finish it.. It was uncooked, smelly and tasteless.. The chicken wings were too oily.. Noodles again was substandard and at par with the local street shops (too oily and over fried)
I would definitely not visit the place again!

The 1st restaurant in kolkata i experienced....when i came to kolkata for study,our teacher took us to this restaurant on his birth day....so it was a new experience and left me with nostalgia....i still remember the food we ordered...for starter...sweet chicken corn soup and thai fish and chicken spring roll...it was a great taste i felt in my semi urban tongue where usually we get only roll and moglai (!!) parata....
in the main course..we took mixed friend rice,mixed noodles...and a few chicken items....quality were superb and regarding quantity i remember we had to overfed..
ambiance was superb with a great waiting place....service was also good.....

Stumbled upon this place while coming back from gorihat... Started off with a horrible Tomyom soup... smelt of fish and was tasteless... more of a salty water preparation. Decided to give it a miss halfway and ordered chicken momos...could not proceed beyond one coz the momos were saltless.... Had already ordered chicken prawn noodles, honey chicken and chicken schzewann so sat in fear of the agony to follow.... what lay ahead was the worst attack on my senses. The honey chicken was like soaked in honey, not the usual palatable tinge of honey stuff which you get in regular fares. The prawn noodles were too salty robbing it of the taste of the prawns... and the chicken schzewann was more of a masla curry meant to confuse your senses and making you beleive you are eating chicken. Believe me guys i had better chinese food in roadside eateries while travelling than this one. They seriously need to change the chef unless they are aiming at shutting down very soon. The good part was the air conditioning and the courteous staff who brought you the final bill with a smile and you feel someone has robbed you of your moolah....but only a good seating and air conditioning dont make a good restaurant .. or do they?

ACCETABLE FOOD @ KRYSTAL CHOPSTICK!

Krystal Chopstick restaurant is more likeable for Indian Chinese rather than Chinese fare. The place is adequately decorated. The food quality is tolerable.  I say this because this is one restaurant in south Kolkata where the taste of the food varies from time to time.  Apart from the usual fish and prawn dishes they also serve up several squid and crab dishes. But this place is acceptable for the regular soup, noodles, and rice and chicken dishes. Though they have so many meat items, their pork, lamb and duck dishes do not have the same consistency in taste as you will find in other restaurants. 

Nevertheless, items to be ordered from here can be their chicken hot and sour soup, garlic rice and spicy chicken Mongolian style. The quality and quantity of the last dish is not only good but plentiful as well. This dish besides being unique is also one of their many well made dishes. Besides the items for the main course, their starters are satisfactorily well turned out. The Chinese toast is considered by many to be their signature dish. 

For starters their Momos, Wantons and Spring Rolls are satisfactorily. For the main course it will be in your interest to stick to the usual Hakka noodle, Chilli Chicken and Fried Rice. Despite the numerous negatives, the restaurant still continues to have a loyal clientele due to its moderately priced fare. The servers are very competent in their jobs. They are instantly by your side to take your order. Sometimes, the service might suffer a bit and you might require waiting a while for the food.

 The food joint is, therefore, worth a visit for its acceptable food at reasonable prices. Otherwise there are many other restaurants in Kolkata that offer better Chinese food at those same prices.

Conveniently located near Gariahat, this Indian-Chinese restaurant is above the "average indian-chinese restaurant" in the Gariahat region. Decent food, deft service with parking facilities and a lot on the menu. Starters are better than the main course items.

If  you are coming from Gariahat crossing, you need to take a left before Kimbadanti to reach krystal chopstick. If you appreciate simple indian chinese and would be happy with just soup,noodles/rice, and chicken, and also have some extra cash to spend i would recommend to you this place. Nicely decorated place, more or less friendly staff members, and the food is okay nothing great! They have a lot of things on their menu, and the usual things people order are reasonably nice. I personally do not like this place because i have had far better Chinese cuisines served at other places in kolkata with lesser pocket pinch! Also, their pork,lamb, and duck, whenever i have dined and whenever available, have turned out to be weird and smelly! Therefore i stay clear of this restaurant! Also their quality of food is questionable at times! 
However I personally happen  know people who would swear by this place for Chinese. Therefore if you are willing to try a new place and have some cash on you, I would suggest you try it and decide for yourself! :)

I have been visiting this place since I was a kid and I absolutely love them. The place is reasonably decorated and the interiors are simple yet nice. Their chinese toast is a speciality and a must try. The momos and others starters are good as expected. If you love Indo-Chinese food this place won't disappoint you. Trust me you can order anything here and you will love the dish. The pricing is just right I feel.
The staff here is satisfactory and tolerable. So I give it 4.5 for all its good efforts and great preparation. The serving time is also less and if you are hungry you won't get starved here waiting for the food. So do spare a thought and visit this place without fail.

I have been driven away many times thanks to the long queues for the table but luckily managed to get a seat yesterday ... loved the bird display as we enter.... very positive feel it gives .

in spite of the fact that they were packed the staff was calm and composed and very warm

we didnt order much but what ever we ordered came promptly which to me is a big plus

our order
- Veg Fried Rice
- lamb with green and red pepper
-Yam Bam Chicken ( or what ever it is called it was recommended by the order taker)

all three were perfectly seasoned and the especially the chicken that was recommended
it was mind blowing ....

........................

I visited last night again and was shocked to see their place empty. 

We ordered crispy thread chicken and chili fish 

Both were horrid 

Huge let down

A decent joint conveniently located in Hindustan Park.  People do shopping in the Gariahat area and drop in to this nice restaurant.  Food quality is good.  Mostly remain occupied.  Due to high turn over, food mostly remain fresh and tasty.

I have a long association with this restaurant and will love to rate it 4 in a scale of 5.

Oh !  By the way, if you are a bird lover, you will get an extra bonus !

The service for TakeOut here is so bad that it is beyond words. On Thursday night  (28/03/13) I placed an order over the phone and was told to come after half an hour. My wife reached there after 35 minutes and was told to sit by a person who presumably was a waiter. After this half an hour passed with no response from anybody. Only intermittently this person who had earlier told my wife to sit and wait, was popping his head out and on inquiring he was heard to say that "he had no time".

Exasperated my wife telephoned me after sitting there for more than half an hour, and  I placed a call to the restaurant. Hearing about my wife's experiences I had by then already lost all appetite for any food from here. But surprisingly I was told by the restaurant that food was long ready and there has been a misunderstanding and it would be immediately solved. Later when my wife returned  I heard that instead of apologizing the other waiters were mostly trying to save this waiter who was at fault.

Earlier I myself had some issues so I had skipped this place for almost two years. This time I decided to give it a  second chance but am already regretting my mistake. The food here is also quite average for most items and can be rated good for a handful of items only. The price is "medium" and there are ample restaurants of this caliber  in South Calcutta, so this place can easily be given the miss. The owner of this place certainly has to be taught that the customer cannot be taken for granted. This restaurant has certainly seen the last of me.

had been to this place quite a few years back.Both the food and the ambience, as I remember was nice at that time. 
However, on revisiting, it left a bitter taste in the mouth.The seating area was cramped and noisy, over crowded, with tables jammed against each other.
what disappointed us more was the quality of food.We ordered thai soup and fried chicken wantons for starters. the thai soup was an orange coloured extremely sour liquid, with two big chunks(!) of boiled chicken. BAD. the chicken wantons, though crisp, hardly had any fillings.
The shanghai noodles for mains was strictly ok. quantity was also okayish.The chicken in oyster sauce had a strange smell. didnt enjoy at all.
overall, for the price you pay, the food is definitely not upto the mark. there are many more joints serving far better chinese food at a much cheaper price and better /same ambience(Kimli or golden dragon or Hatari).
AVOID

Please read this before u enter this place.
On 4th feb 2013 on a fine evening after shopping at gariahat, my friend and myself visited this place for a quick snack at around 6.30pm. The restaurant was quite empty because of the odd time and apart from us there were 2 more families. My friend and I sat at a corner table from where I could get a clear view of the private dinning area which was a separate chamber. After placing the order, I saw one the the waiter entering the chamber. 
While I was talking over the phone by chance my eyes turned to that chamber and to my horror I saw the waiter performing some socially inappropriate acts. It was very hard for me to believe my eyes. In the first place, I told my place I must be hallucinating and asked my friend to turn around n see what the guy is going. She was in shock too. I asked her to slowly creep down and call the manager. We caught him red handed but this guy was not affected by this incident. He was taken at once inside the kitchen and I didn't see his face till we left.The manager was sorry. I wanted to speak with owner and after requesting a lot they connected me to him. He said he would take action.We wanted to leave at once because I was very uncomfortable but they requested us to have our food. N even after such a big incident I was charged the full amount of the bill. I guess they are not bothered. It was a nightmare for two of us to encounter such a situation. If its a family restaurant I guess I have to check the meaning of family in the dictionary again. Never ever I can imagine to face such an incident even at the cheapest restaurant in the world. And just for the information the name of the leech is Pronob Rauth. So choose your dinning option accordingly.

This place synonymises chinese food for me. Great fish fingers for starters, with garlic sauce served on the side. Another absolute winner, the crab in hot garlic sauce. One of the very few places where I make it a point to order gravy noodles. The lemon fish (flavoured with star anise) and dry chilli chicken are droolworthy.

In terms of ambience and overall packaging, its a winner for a quiet family eat-out experience.

This is one of the most unpredictable restaurant that I have come across. I have been to this restaurant quite a few times and the experience varies time to time from being strictly average to good. They have a very uncanny tendency to make some of the dishes excessively hot (it becomes so hot at times that you can hardly eat..and that too if you have not ordered it to be extra hot). For all other times, the food is fairly good. The soup and starter are good. Ambiance and decor are very good. The staff is also very good. 
Price is a bit on the higher side considering the quality.

PS - During puja, they serve a modified and shortened menu.

It serves pure authentic chinese and food quality is really delectable. Quantity is immense and service is great too. Ambiance is good with some birds and sitting arrangement is fine. I tried for Prawn Spring Roll, Chicken momos for starters. Then for main course i tasted their mixed Fried Rice and Chicken Schezwan. You can also get pork here. ANd,also had chicken clear soup. :ricing is moderate and i would suggest you to visit there. I would rate 3.5.

The foyer has a glass window. And all you can see is birds of different colours. This is the Krystal Chopsticks, that has been time tested and still stood unnerved. Its a small haven of authentic Chinese food, that's slowly receding on its authenticity. It still satiated my taste buds last time I visited the restaurant. It can seat at most 75 people. The waiters seems laid back. The ambiance isn't that appealing. Yet, as the door of the kitchen keeps flinging open  with the waiters' entry and exit, the smell would keep you salivating. The food still tastes good enough. It is so moderately priced, that you can think about hanging out there and having a ball anytime you feel like. Krystal Chopsticks wont really let you down.

Delightful joint serving Chinese Cuisine. Positioned in between fine dining and roadside eateries. This is a true value for money food joint. Makes good preparations of uncommon items like squid and pork along with the usual fare of chicken, lamb, fish and sea food (crab, prawns, etc). The food tastes excellent (well balanced), portions are quite big, service is prompt but could be a little more courteous. Pocket pinch is low, making the place stand out in an are filled with eateries.

Been going there for a decade. Friendly place. Food is reasonably priced; preparation is good. Menu is scattered all over the place though, no specific compentency. Food quality is maintained; amazingly enough never fluctuated much in taste...Fried Momo good :), Hakka Chowmein, Chilly Babycorn, Spring Roll, Chicken in Oyster Sauce, Shredded lamb, Fish in Black Bean sauce good :D, Honey Chicken not up to the mark ;( , Duck hmmm nah, Crab Pork nope, some Soups okay. Overall a thumbs up. 

Thumbs down for Restroom - really shabby and it smells. The owner is too busy making money and seem not to care for customer comfort. That's an essential ingredient in today's business. 

Take out option good. If you are not keen to open a container business, take something with you when you home order ... trust me ... I got like 50 containers home people ... wondering what the heck I should do :>

Happy eating ...

When you enter the place, you have a nice feeling that you are someplace nice.. 'pop!' it goes when you see the whole place super congested and you are requested to almost share a table, if not sit at a table adjascent to another.. Food is not bad.. The crab sweet corn soup is a must try! We dared to go for Shredded lamb with chili and pepper, and regretted.. And yes, The service is a big thumbs down! They are all smiles and warm, but once you have to wait for 40 minutes to get even a soup, you really start thinking if all those smiles were to cover these up! One plus is that price is rather on the cheaper side, so if you dont wanna see a hole in your pocket, you might wanna try it.. But then again, there are far too many restaurants in Kolkata which provides much beter food and service in a similar price.. So overall, it's an okay place.. Maybe a one time try!

we have visited the restaurant number of times and found the food to our liking but when we ordered for home delivery (two times in all), on both occasion the food (some of the dishes) were not fit to be consumed by taste. Moreover, when the matter was reported over telephone, the casual approach at the restaurant-end has been dissapointing. Our experience in this regard drive us to give an AVERAGE RATING.

Crabs and ducks. Like 'em, then this place is a must for you. Do try the Peking Duck and Roast Duck. Rest is the regular Chinese fare. Pricing is fair. It might get crowded at times and you'd have to wait. Parking is problematic, but manageable.
Avoid during pujas, they have an extremely limited menu.

I went there last week. Opposite to Basanti Devi college at Hindusthan park. It looks like a house from the outside. I was surprised after I entered. There are some beautiful small birds in a glass cage in the waiting room. Got seats in corner. The atmosphere is very good and the decoration is nice. Ambiance is good too. 
We ate Chicken Pan Fried Momos. it was very nice. Chicken Fried Rice was good too. But the Chicken Boneless Manchurian is not that good. You can find Duck meat here. 
Next time I will surely try the Ducks. Prices are okay. Staff is very friendly. 
Overall experience was nice. Worth a visit.

Tired after busy shopping in Gariahat... jump into Krystal - in a relaxed and comfortable environment, enjoy some chinese dishes. Krystal is there for a very long time.. and there is some timeless dishes there have.
Hakka noodles here is better than the gravy ones. Rice is decent. Advise you to go for standard side dishes, as I had some failed experiment some unknown dishes like chen-tu chicken and fish with pinapple. 
If luck is with you - you can also find duck - very few resturants in Kolkata serve duck meat.

Krystal Chopsticks. The name always takes me down the memory lane. I was a regular to this Hindusthan Park Chinese joint a few years ago. Today I went there after a few years though (Park Street food seems to have narrowed down my gastronomical diversity). For first timers: if you've been shopping at Gariahat and walked down Rashbehari Avenue till 'Kimbadanti' (opposite Basantidevi College), you can't miss this place. My advice to you is that do pop in for a meal with your co-shoppers (or grumbling spouses whom you've dragged along so far). You won't regret it.

I was a bit disappointed to see that the painting of the 'restaurant-defining' horse (by Samir Das) in the waiting lobby is now replaced. Also, the numbers of lovebirds in the glass cage was visibly reduced. But that shouldn't put you off much though, because the rest of the restaurant's (including the food) is pretty much the same (Read: Yummy!).

Getting on to the proper review. The waiters have always been helpful and good with their English. And they also suggest side dishes with the noodles/ rice you choose. They make pretty good lamb here, so I went for a plate of Shredded Lamb with green pepper and red chili, along with some mixed fried rice (they DO give you the pork/no pork option). I was a bit disappointed with my choice of lamb, as going by this name, you do expect something more spicy. It tasted almost sweet! But otherwise, it's good in quantity and taste. Any two modest eaters who specify on having good quality food and not much of the quantity (like me) should have a decent meal. It shouldn't be fair to end this review without mentioning the dish I always have here (and today was no exception): Chicken Spring Rolls. Somehow it's my hot favorite, and its taste gets me all the time. Do order it, you'll love it. The prices are pretty decent- a three course meal for two costs about 500 bucks.

Overall, I felt that the food quality has gone down a bit in a few years, but it's still worth a visit any day. This foodie rates Crystal Chopsticks 3.2 out of 5!

Happy Dining! :) :)

Situated off Rash Behari Avenue, this quiet Chinese restaurant is ideal for a small group or couples. The first thing you notice when you walk in through the door is a glass pane in which there are birds flying around in a large enclosed space. The prices are extremely reasonable and the Chinese cuisine amongst the best in the city. The service is erratic though, ranging from extremely competent to indifferent. Though much smaller than other stalwarts of the Kolkata restaurant fraternity, the simplicity and serenity associated with Krystal Chopstick make it stand out. My recommendation : the Crispy Lamb !

This place has a very well thought out menu, but food is simply awful.. The restaurant we all loved (Crystal Chopstick) is dead..  Their preparation and quality used to be flawless..  not to mention the warm service... the current 'Krystal' is a huge disappointment ..

Horrible service. Never order for home delivery. takes 2 hrs to deliver and by the time the food reaches, its too cold to eat. prices too high and quantity too less. In one word- Just Pathetic.........

This restaurant is one of my favourites. Located in the lane opposite Basanti Devi College, the restaurant is not too large. However, the long evening queues and the amazing food define this place. Try the Fried Chicken Wings to start with and top it with the Korean Fried Rice and Schezwan Fish. 
The only drawback of this place is that it may not be as swanky as you hope for it to be, considering that the food is excellent.

Can't compare this place with any other Chinese restaurant in south kolkata. Just loved their dishes all are prepared in well care and to the most perfection.

Decor is not to hyped it's decent to have a sit and eat. visited several times, from the soup menu "Crab sweet corn soup" and "mixed chimney soup" are best! with soup or without soup "Chicken spring roll" can be taken they are awesome. In crab "fired crab" is best in their menu.

In main course you can try any kind of rice or noodles trust me you won't be disappointed at all. can try "Singapore rice " or simply go with "mixed fried rice" (with pork or without pork option is available via waiter :) ) another dishes just want to tell is "fried fish in pepper sauce","spring chicken" are excellent.

If you like Chinese food must visit!!

The food is uniformly good, and sometimes has pleasant surprises in store. However, it does not really rise to the level of being transcendental. Add to that the most supercilious attitude of the maitre d', and the long queues during the weekend, and the overall eating out experience is not quite what it could have been.

its one of my favourite restutants in the busy shopping destination - gariahat. there are very few quality eating joints in gariahat anyway. for the people who will go there for the first time, enter hindustan park from the front of kimbadanti (famous bengali kurta shop) opposite basanti devi college.the place is cozy and comfortable though not very spacious. they have a nice waiting area too. food is great in taste and quality. i specially love the dry chilli chicken. noodles are also good. chicken preparations are also delicious. the restaurant is not very expensive also. ideal for a lazy lunch after a heavy shopping spree. your feet and tummy, both will get some much needed rest here. at any time of the day you will always find this restaurant crowded. its very popular among the local college going crowd.you can also take away food from here as they make a real good packaging. all in all one of the must visit restaurants in gariahat. go and enjoy with your family and kids. definitely worth repeat visit.

Good food, nice ambiance. The place seems to convey a sense of nice comfortable spot  and the food and staff do augment that feeling. 
On the food front most of the dishes are quite agreeable. The lamb and pork dishes are pretty good.
It tends to be crowded and one has to wait for some time, but that is the only not so positive point I can think of for this place.
All these factors along with the location of this place makes it a repeat visit.

Overall:
F & B: 3.5 out of 5 
Service: 3.5 out of 5
Ambiance: 3 out of 5
