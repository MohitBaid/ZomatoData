Firstly this restaurant is not at Belur but Zomato shows it's at Belur... 
I visited here once it's a little messy with so many chairs and tables, ambiance was otherwise neat and clean. service was little late but the food worth that much waiting... I liked the food quality, quantity was nice, we ordered
Paneer tikka 4/5
Kashmiri pulao 3/5
Paneer butter masala 3/5
Butter naan 2/5 ( little hard to tear)
Dal makhani 2/3 ( need to improve it's taste)
Sweet lime soda...

Expecting to see non- veg too...

I went here for dinner a couple of days back.... while it has improved a lot from my previous experiences but still there is room for a lot more improvement. The price is slightly on the higher side considering the other options available locally. 

Areas of improvement:
1) Area is very small. In the small area I would prefer less seats.
2) Tables,chairs, Cutlery need upgrade. 
3) May be employ one more staff. I could see only one person serving all the tables hence waiting time is a bit more.

But not to forget the food was served HOT and tasted good. 

Still a long way to go ...

What the place is this a restaurant or a 5star hotel.Really disgusting.Just before a few minutes i have ordered kashmiri aloodum really bad and you r telling its a cheap restaurant it cost 120 rupees and food king cost the same food for rupees 50 rupees.Chapati cost 3rupees in food king but in this restaurant they take 10 rupees for one chapati.Chola bhatora was not good.And if we order below rs 250 they will take 20 rupees extra for packaging in this place this all thing happened.I will never order anything from this restaurant.Really disgusting place.

I was here with my family for lunch. Quality of food was near perfect and had lots of stuff in menu.Service is good. Ambiance is OK. Giving a try is worth.
