Located near Ashoknagar Park in Tollygunge, Sharma snacks is a famous place for breakfast. It is quite popular among the people living here. Early morning, their kachori, sabzi and lassi and hot jalebi are the best. U can even try hot gulab jamun and the samosas served by them. They won't fail you. :)

I love the hinger kachuri and samosa from sharma. As a snacks hinger kachuri is just awesome with a chutni and green chilli with mustard. As nowdays with a delivery app service I often order it.

Ordered via swiggy from their shop in a rainy day. Delivery was swift enough.

Ordered hinger kachuri with alur tarkari. 1 plate of hinger kachori contains 5pieces of kachori. They also provide chatney with the kachori. Also ordered 1 plate dahi vada. 1 plate of dahi vada contains 4pieces of vada.

Kachori was soft, less oily and properly sized. The alur tarkari was normal..not so much rich of oil and less spiced. Dahi vada was yumm.. it will definitely please the South indian food lovers. Vada was nycly cooked and soft. Satisfied with their food quality and quantity and services.

I happened to order from this joint through a food delivery app a couple of months back, the delivery was quite fast and the food was hot. I had ordered the hing kachoris that this joint is famous for and the gulab jamuns.
I don't have much of a sweet tooth, yet I found the gulab jamun absolutely delightful, very soft and warm and the hing kachoris were great too but I felt they were not as hot as I'd like them to be, they were pretty cold to be honest but decent experience nonetheless, would definitely try their other dishes and snacks

Near Ashoknagar park in tollygunge, sharma snacks is a popular destination for breakfast among the people there. This being the first outlet of the sharma snacks chain is very popular in the locality. You could spot a lot of swiggy delivery vehicles standing in que there to pick up their orders early in the morning. 
Among other things available there, kachori sabzi and lassi are the most popular edibles sold there. One could also try hot gulab janums or samosa or the cutlets available there.

Sharmas have a reputation for making tasty Indian snacks. And this Sharma does justice to the heritage. The food is delicious and tge cost is reasonable. But the only thing that lets us down is the space. The huge kadhai is put right in front of the entrance, making it an infernal experience to wait for your food. But if you are looking for a take away. You are in the right place. The packaging is done with modern equipments making it easier to carry.

A perfect place for outstation students in tollygunj near Ashok Nagar Park. All kinds of snacks nd sweets with amazing taste at affordable price. Tried their club kachoris and Dhoklas. Those are awesome. Lack of proper space so you have to wait for a while to satisfy your hunger. Their Gulab jamuns are also good. If you are a Indian snacks lover just visit this place once.

This place is a hidden gem for any veggie. From the most awesome kochuris to awesome malpoahs including some amazing shingaras, this place is too good. It's a shame that they have limited capacity and the pavement outside is a bit too narrow causing a deficiency of space to eat when there are 3-4 people inside. Nevertheless, it's a gem!

Today i tried club kachori through swiggy home delivery. 
Delivery was very fast. 
It cost me rs 75.
I found kachori average. 
It could have been much better. 
This place remains crowded all the time and it becomes difficult to stand and eat there because of space issues.

I almost always go there whenever I visit tollygunge. I love this place and their food. Their kachoris,sabzi and chutney,served with few pieces of green chilli is a complete meal in itself. Tasty and filling at the same time. Have also had their samosas and bread pakoras. Food is not oily here. You will get hot gulab jamuns here which are awesome to taste.I have heard good things about their lassi too. Lovely old fashioned snacks which won't hurt your pocket :-)

Well, this is more of a takeaway rather than eating inside unless you're considering checking in after a match of football maybe, for breakfast with your buds. This strictly is a no go for those who's always health conscious. But you definitely should give some days off. The kachori and torkari(potato side) is what people basically come here, For Obvious reasons. The samosas are amazing as well. You always find varieties of other items like the dhokla and veg sandwiches which are better left untried. To satisfy that sweet tooth of yours you definitely need to try the Gulab Jamun or the Jalebis. Both of sell out really fast. Special mention-lassi. Thanks for reading. Have a great day. Peace.

A classic vegetarian snacks takeaway. They have multiple branches in south kolkata. This one's very close to Malancha cinema hall. I had been to this place multiple times, but each time I went there for the kachoris. They serve hot crispy lip smacking kachoris with an aloo curry. The curry has a refreshing smell of kasouri methi which lingers long after you have finished with them. I often had gulab jamun after having savoured with the kachoris. 
The place needs a makeover though. The presentation needs to be clean, and the kitchen needs to be more hygienic.

One of my favorite places, whenever I visit Tollygunge area. Simply love their Kachoris and Sabji. Both of them compliment each other so well. Located near Ashoknagar park, try their Lassi as well to finish off the meal. Price tag isn't high and the place deserves numerous visits.

A classic vegetarian snacks takeaway. They have multiple branches in south kolkata. This one's very close to Malancha cinema hall. I had been to this place multiple times, but each time I went there for the kachoris. They serve hot crispy lip smacking kachoris with an aloo curry. The curry has a refreshing smell of kasouri methi which lingers long after you have finished with them. I often had gulab jamun after having savoured with the kachoris. 
The place needs a makeover though. The presentation needs to be clean, and the kitchen needs to be more hygienic.

One of my favorite places, whenever I visit Tollygunge area. Simply love their Kachoris and Sabji. Both of them compliment each other so well. Located near Ashoknagar park, try their Lassi as well to finish off the meal. Price tag isn't high and the place deserves numerous visits.

Want to have a peaceful tiffin.. well stop by this counter.. The best Kachori of that area can only be found here. Kachori with aloo sabji and chopped green chilies will make you fall in love with this place. Jalebis were good too.

This place is pretty good. I love their kachoris and jalebis. They are an absolute mood lifter and you will fall in love with the jalebis as soon as you have them. The only perk is that it's sold in the morning only. Quality of other sweets is not that up to the mark. That's it. Happy Dining! :)

On a Sunday morning if u are in a mood to have a breakfast with a punch, head to Sharma snacks. Hot kachauri, spicy aloo curry, tangy mirchi and crisp jelebis will satisfy you like anything. The shop is dingy, difficult to stand and eat at times, the hot kadai adding to the heat and sweat. But go for a lassi and .... peace...

It's good, typical nimki, sinhara, jalebi shop my favorite is the jalebi which is different & good there are various other types of innovative stuff too but try them only if they look fresh which they usually are, the lassi and chae is a must though!

Sharma snacks is a very old name on this line. Their kachuri is very popular in Calcutta. Their lassi is very good and it comes in many different sizes. The jelabi and the amritis are also very good.

Sharma snacks on Netaji Nagar main road, just few steps in from NSC Bose road is one  of those neighbourhood food joint that becomes part of your life when you live nearby. Hing kachoris and jalebis are the staple. Lassi is one of the best you find around. Insist on fried green chillies with your order. If you have any doubts about food quality or popularity, try visiting the joint on weekend mornings...you may end up waiting for almost half an hour before your turn comes. I am lucky, live next door...   ;)

Just at the chalia more you can find this shop. The new renovated look is better than the previous one. being a localite i have been there quite a few times. The best thing about this place is that they will serve you fresh stuff. Although i feel that the samosas are a bit salty out there but sweet like hot gulab jamun is awesome. Good place for a quick snack.

From netaji nagar modh walk a few steps towards Gourmet Hut and then a few more steps on your left you would find Sharma Snacks.. The best thing is that whenever I have been there for kachoris, I have been served with kachoris which are hot. Special mention would be the chatni that they serve with the kachoris. Also the lassis are great.. Try it out guys who haven't yet..

Oh, residents near ashok nagar knows what Sharma Sweet is, trust me its not only about sweets :) 
FOOD-„Äã If you stay somewhere near and yet didn't try KACHORIs from here,  then you are missing something.  They made it best.  Four kachoris enough for anyone but you will crave to have more!! They also offer laddus barfi and other sweet options but I would like to have what they are specialised in. 
Location-„ÄãIt will be on the left side if you are coming from Tollygunje towards Garia. 
Mornings are generally full with customers here. Specially the sundays, who wants to miss the Sharmas Kachoris on Sunday morning ;)
