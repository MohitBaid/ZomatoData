With the varieties of üåΩ and üçù to try from the taste of corn is good but the cold salad pasta is awful in taste with very little veggies in the pasta and pasta with the mustard sauce not great combination.

Tasted their hot butter corn. Corns were bit hard then it should have been. Probably due to use of much matured corns. Quantity was enough for one person to have a cup, but there was nothing much special in the preparation. Felt like, just the corn dipped in butter and then served.

This is one food stall from where I have ordered the most while in City Centre. Their corn cups are good. But my favourite is their mixed salad. It's almost a complete meal for me. You can customize it according to your choice by omitting some items or adding something in some specific quantities. The sauces are great and spicy too. Really yum.

I have visited the outlet in Homeland mall before this was my first visit to this one. I was on the lookout for something healthy and tasty to eat and I found the perfect place.

They have a variety of salads on offer along with streamed corn done up in various avatars.

I went for the the mixed salad with pasta
And chatpata corn

The corn kernels were fresh and juicy and the spices were just right.

The salad bar is quite impressive;
There are 4 dressing options like mayonnaise, Thai dressing, mustard, salsa etc..
Pasta along with
Carrots
Cabbage
Beet
Boiled potato
Raw papaya
Sprouts
Corn kernel
Boiled chickpea
Capsicum

You can choose all or few among these toppings which is tossed with dollops of the dressing of your choice and served up in a plastic container.

The quantity was good.
Taste was good.
I was full without feeling guilty.

Suggestion : whole wheat pasta should be made available.

This review is based on the single item I order everytime I am here. The mixed salad. I just love it.

The best part is we can choose what goes and how much, and avoid the condiments we don't want. The quantity is good. Price is reasonable considering the neighborhood. Service is fast most of the times. And the taste awesome.

First things first. CHANGE YOUR STAFF. We are done with fast food chains employing what seem like rejected party youths who desperately need exhaustive lessons in how to talk to people, let alone customers.

People do not go to your stall to get a callous, devil-may-care "ekhon hobe na" or to be yelled at when asked, why do you open the kiosk when you can't serve what the customer wants now. The fellow at the kiosk got rude beyond what is acceptable as standard in our city. He lashed out unparliamentary words when my back was turned. He doesn't know the H of hospitality.

I am not asking you to fire him, but I am simply stating that you guys need to stop hiring anyone and everyone you find you can afford, who just drops by without any training in how to talk to people. You're in hospitality, even if it is a kiosk, and you can't afford your brand name getting tarnished by such pathetically trained employees than by unhappy prospective customers. Just by opening a kiosk at a mall which doesn't have stuff or staff ready to be served or to serve,  you entrepreneurs bring this upon yourselves.

Please, it's a request, if you want your food business to grow, you NEED to take care of the employee selection process and, above all, the people who represent your brand in front of customers. Such ducked (refraining from profanity but you know what this rhymes with) up attitude in hospitality is a massively frustrating deterrent to your brand in this city. 

Thank you.

Always u don't hv to grab heavy foods,sometimes little, tiny foods can make your day. That's why u should come here to take simply a large cup of any corn as m taking it now n feel d taste!!!  Its just awesome... So I always go for hot butter corn n masala corn. It rates 10 on 10...only d simple n healthy corn items. I ll never try pastas n other foods at a corn outlet,so I can't rate it. But u can take their variety of salads....tax max salad is a fabulous one. Surely quantity of foods are not so large as it is priced;but dont go always for quantity, especially when its an issue of taste only. Carry on.

This place is one of my favourite place for having some tasty salad. It is located on the ground floor of city centre, saltlake, just opposite to just casual store. I love their mixed pasta salad. The salad is tasty, healthy, may not be that fresh, filling and are reasonably priced. Its main ingredients being penne pasta, sprouts, carrots, sweets corn, beetroot, potato, cabbage, peppers etc. I rarely try their corn. But i liked their butter corn which I tried about 6 months ago.

Overall nice place to have pasta salad. Highly recommended.

sometime ago I opted to have some corn preparation here while waiting for a movie to start. i asked them to suggest a preparation which is less spicy. but ironically they suggested "masala corn". with some doubt, i ordered that, but thankfully it was not that "masaledar" and pretty good to taste. these items are very good time pass as well as healthy snacks option. I'm looking forward to check their pastas and salads sometime latter. Surely recommended.

I was a fan of this place previously, but lately it has let me down quite a few times. I just go there for the delicious butter and/or masala corns, and recently they're just giving ridiculous amounts of it for a humongous price. The medium cups of early days are now large ones, and the cost has been increased to 70 Rs. In 60 Rs you can buy half a kilo of frozen sweet corn, and boiling it and mixing it with a couple spoons of masala and butter doesn't even take 5 minutes of your time! However, coming to the quality, the last couple times I tried this, once it was too salty and I had to throw half of it away. And the next time the corns were boiled for much longer than needed, giving them a weird smell and taste. So all in all, probably won't be going back.

Masala Corn and Hot Butter corn is yummiest..I didn't get the chance to try Salads and Pasta here,but sure they also taste yummy.

Overall,For a happy tummy and light mood this is the perfect food joint.

I am not at all a Go green and health conscious type. But I simply love this. Because corns are my favourite. Sweet corns n babaycorns are something I love eating. I have tried nearly everything. In the corn section i love the chinese corn with capsicum n different chinese flavoured masalas. But what I adore is the authentic hot butter corn. I aint a salad person but I love the pasta and vegetable salad out here. As for tge pastas.  I am a white sauce freak.  So what else but the white sauce pasta with babycorn and mushroom. I love love it for the authentic italian taste. You may also try the fresh vegetable pasta with cocktail sauce. Suits the appetite of people who love to have loads of veggies in their dish. Which ever outlet u r in. Simply corn will never let you down

Not every time you feel like eating in a restaurant when you are hungry. Otherwise those roadside food stalls would have disappeared long ago. The only exception is Simply Corn sells healthy food without depriving your taste buds. I was introduced to this place by a good friend of mine. I had this nagging doubt in my mind that how can salads be so attractive? Being a hardcore meat lover, my first option in City Centre was KFC. My friend changed this biased decision soon after she gave me a treat here. The Pasta with Vegetable Salad, Alo Chana Salad, Hot Butter Corm, Masala Corn you name it... they are all lip-smacking delicious! I'll break down the positives and negatives.

Positives:
1. Inexpensive.
2. Nothing unhealthy.
3. Serves a large amount! If you are not literally starving, you will find it difficult to finish the salads.
4. They prepare the salads and corns really fast and well.
5. You can take the food away from the stall and eat at a preferred and less congested place.
6. Even as a meat lover, me and my friend didn't miss anything. The taste was so good!

Negatives:
1. They don't have a dustbin. To dump the containers and food wastes, you have to walk towards the Cookie Jar store. I wonder why they cause their customers so much inconvenience!
2. They don't have every item ready all the time. That too within their business hours!
3. Last time we went to this place a person (who looked and behaved like the owner) was scolding a staff for taking a day off. He stretched it unnecessarily long in front of the customers. Unprofessional! A serious turn off!

6 positive points and 3 negatives, that pretty much explain why I like this place and would love to visit again.
