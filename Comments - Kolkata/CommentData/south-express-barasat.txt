I opt for a home delivery from here almost every alternative day. i am not a big fan of south indian dishes but i must appreciate the quality which makes me love the food here. however i find quality of food differs eveeyday. you'll find yourself licking your fingers one day and abusing the same item the other day

The quality of the food was not at all good. The Rawa Dosa's taste was soo bad.
The price is too high.
The delivery was up to the mark.
Packaging was decent.
