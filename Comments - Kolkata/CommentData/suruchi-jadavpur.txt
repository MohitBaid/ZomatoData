Not good. Below average food quality tried a few items but none of them are acceptable. The location is although good there is not much people visiting the food joint because all the local people are well known about the quality. But actually I think its not in javapur its proper location is Ramgarh.

A run of the mill fast food joint in Jadavpur. I have tried their rolls, chilly chicken and a few staple chinese fare. The food is pretty average as per kolkata standards...and one thing they can surely avoid is dunking stuff in too much of sauce. It actually kills the taste. The menu is pretty exhaustive for a roadside eatery...but then thats how it is in kolkata.

Food quality is more or less ok. The only wierd thing is that they use tomato and chilli sauce in their chicken roll. The other foods like moghlai, fish fry and chilli chicken is quite good. their biryani is quite  tasty.
