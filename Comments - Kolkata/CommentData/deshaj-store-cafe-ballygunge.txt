Nice ambience. Not very crowded. Food is good for a quick bite. Service is average but may be because they prepare things fresh. We ordered cole slaw sandwich. The portions are fulfilling

The cafe looks like a cottage and when you enter it has a shop at one side and the cafe area on the other. It has a seating area outside in a balcony kind of a setup. I went with two of my friends and we ordered walnut brownie milkshake, iced mocha and grilled chicken burger. The food is good but needs a little more attention. The service is average. The ambience gets full marks, it has various clothes, home decor and lifestyles items for sale. You can enjoy your food while shopping. It's a nice place to visit.

Do u love to sit quietly in a cafe and sip tea while reading a book? Do u like to sit outdoors and watch the world go by? Do u love shopping for clothes and jewellery? R u fond of interior  decor items n artifacts? If any answer is yes then this is the place for u. An experience in itself, I would visit this place again. The cinnamon green tea was so refreshing and the veg pesto sandwich was generous in portion size. Bought gamcha-pouch bags n Diwali lights too from the store! U can look around the store while sitting at ur table due to the open layout. Just a suggestion for the owners: do serve tea cupwise instead of potwise as different people at a table may want to sample varied types of tea.

There has been a sudden spurt of Tea Cafes, (not sure whether that's a term), in Kolkata. I must say they are quite good as well. This is the kid on the block and quite impressive. This place is a store cum restaurant and the collection of stuff is quite good.
We had ordered tea (Duh!) and fish fingers. The fingers were delicious. They have live performances and the place gets crowded. however, there's a small catch, the service is very very slow. May be the management needs to work on that. Over all a good place.

Located very close to my house here in Broad Street...This one's new in town...:) 
This is a store cum cafe...they have many things for sale such as sets of cups n glasses...clothes as well..

Hopped in with my Mom few days back...

Ambiance is quite Nice. Refer to the pictures below :) 

Food-- We Had...

Fried Fish with Chips-- It was damn tastyy...Only disappointment was the quantity...One piece was big..quite ok..but the other piece was just too small..not fair...but the taste was excellent...have to say that...

Mustard Mayo Chicken in Whole Wheat Bread-- This was also delicious...Brown bread sandwich yet soo tasty...it had generous fillings of chicken pieces as well as mayo...lovely :) 

Cold Coffee-- This was just pathetic...It tasted like plain coffee cooled in freezer nd served to you...Horrible!!! Should be kicked out of the menu ASAP!!! 

Barbeque Chicken Burger-- I had this previously at home...Though this one did not have any kind of sauce or mayo inside...just the patty and onion tomato cucumber(maybe) between the breads...it tasted really good to me...The patty was juicy so it made up for the absence of sauce or mayo..u would prefer tomato sauce with this :) 

Though if they add mayo...it would be perfect...

Prices are average...:) Service is Fine. ENJOY!!!

Went there this evening, hoping for a cosy cup of tea, and was utterly disappointed. This place looks very inviting at first glance; we went into the AC interior and found no comfortable place to sit as not only is the small space afforded to the café very crowded with tables and half the people have to sit side by side, a performance was being set up in the tiny space as well. It takes effort to move there. So we came outside to the patio like space and found ourselves a comfortable looking two seater. Alas, no fan, we got soaked in sweat in a minute. The water glass served to me was unclean and took about three tries to get the wait staff's attention. We ordered a chicken sandwich and tea. Roasted vegetables and pesto sandwich was unavailable. Sandwich came, tea came later with (finally) fresh​ glasses. Tea was unremarkable, normal and not enough for two cups, as they claim. Sandwich filling was average, the bread was not only burned, it smelled old. The management and staff seemed preoccupied by the ongoing guitar playing and singing, and their own friends seemed to fill the place. Customer service seemed to be the last thing on their minds. I have hardly ever been so dissatisfied with a café, and the  only positive I can find is that the food came fairly quickly, so we didn't have to sit in the heat for long.
