Do not have any misconceptions because of its name! This is a very ordinary place with a shabby look, but its food is amazing and very reasonable. Being right in front of my coaching center, we used to have its food almost every weekend. I've had its chicken biryani, mutton biryani and chicken chaap. The quality is simply amazing. The place, however, does not have seating arrangements.

This place is located near Jatin Das Park Metro and is a very popular haunt among college going students and people who like to keep their expenses to a minimum. 

I was shocked at the price of the chicken/mutton biryani during my first visit (Rs. 50 for half a plate)! However, ever since my first visit, I have become a regular since the biryani is so damn good. This place is a must visit if you are tight on cash and want to eat really good biryani at one of the lowest prices on the planet (yes, planet!). Service is immediate however there is no dedicated table to sit, therefore people looking for a high end experience may steer clear.

Tufaani Biriyani is the place where you can get a plate full of Biriyani in a affordable price. But! But! If you don't like roadside food then please don't come here coz this place is too small to make a dining area for us. But if you are a food lover and you are in Hazra Road or if you read in "Asutosh College" then I think you already fell in love with this place. I mean just tell me you just have 50-100 Rs in your pocket and you are just crazy for Biriyani (just like me) and you just want to have it , then what will you do? No! You don't know! Okay I am telling you come to tufani biriyani and yes tell them to pack it for you and then ghar jake shanti se khao. Pet khush pocket bhi khush. And yes the main thing is I live in hazra and I can't remember from which year I started eating their Biriyani I mean its good and you can try their rolls also.

All the Asutoshians here know the taste of Tufaani Biriyani..
So much pocket friendly and biriyani starts at just 50 rupees..
Half plate (chicken/Mutton) : 50/- 
Full plate (chicken/Mutton) : 100/- with egg only.
My friend and me every alternative day visit here after college and half plate is enough for me. Biriyani tastes just lovely.

Where else can you get mutton biriyani with 2 good pieces of mutton, an egg and alu for 100 bucks. This is the "to go" place when you are dying to have biriyani but can't burn a hole in your pocket. 
You can either take away your food or have it there but take away is suggested as its doesn't have any dine-in place just chairs for a quick meal.

Good enough outlet for tasty Biryani's:
1) Normal quality Rice with well flavors, rich with spices...
2) Potato and meat cooked well with the spices locked in the form of good taste... Quality also normal enough...
3) Taste of little sweetness can also be found in the Biryani... Probably bcz they won't add saffron but sugar...

Tufaani Biriyani is a small biriyani outlet at Hazra, Kolkata.

Ambience is not nice with minimal sitting arrangements.

Tried chicken biriyani , after a few recommendation and after trying I was surprised. Biriyani tasted very nice , with the right amount of spice, well cooked and tender meat pieces.

Pocket pinch is very reasonable with sufficient quality.

Don't go for ambience, it is a must try place .

On a nice afternoon after recommendation from my friends i decided to try this place. Generally i dont like to eat from biryani stalls with minimal seating capacity and zero ambiance but again i was amazed by the biryani quality and quantity they serve. At Rs.50 you get a half plate biryani both Mutton and Chicken and moreover the taste is really really good. The chicken piece was big and juicy. It was not a bad decision afterall and you can definitely have a quick biryani snack at low price here.

Zero ambiance and minimal sitting arrangement, but the place is quite popular due to the lipsmacking and delicious Biryani they serve. The rice has just the right amount of spices and the chicken and/or mutton portions are unbelievably soft. The pricing is quite affordable, so unless you crave for fine dining, do try this place out.

Mainly caters to the office goers and the students. This place offers tremendous value for money and will give u a sumptous meal.

It was a planned outing with friends to this small joint located near to PathFinder, Hazra Branch. Don't expect much of a ambience or courteousness from this place as this looks like a street food shop always crowded with students or office staffs. Most of the time you have to stand and eat. Now coming to the food which I ordered was Mutton Biriyani, it was like "Happy Birthday To Me". It was just fabulous, the tenderness of the mutton pieces makes it so juicy that it melts in your mouth. I sweated the whole time when I was eating but didn't at all cared about it. This hidden legend proves to be a true value for money. Looking forward for the next visit.

Today went to the Tufani Biryani with my friends. It is situated just opposite to the Hazra Pathfinder branch. This is a small roadside joint famous for its biryani, available at a cheap price. Today tried their Half Chicken and Mutton Biryani which was totally awesome. The mutton and chicken pieces were juicy and well cooked specially the mutton. The Rice was well cooked and garnished with heart touching spices. If you are thinking that in a half plate biryani you will get less quantity with small chicken pieces, then I will say you are totally wrong. In a half biryani you will get sufficient rice (you can see the picture) with same mutton and chicken available in the full plate. A half biryani can fulfil anyone's hunger.This is a perfect example of Biryani and the best I ever hand. The only negativity is their sitting arrangement. So for me its 4 stars.

A very pocket friendly and good biryani place in the city. Chicken and mutton are equally priced. Half plate will cost you a mere Rs 50 and a full plate will be Rs 100. The chicken is very juicy and tender and the rice is pretty tasty. Although this can never be compared with the likes of Arsalan and Zeeshan. 0/5 for ambience though. There are around 10 plastic stools available for seating. The place is usually crowded in the afternoon by college and office goers looking for a cheap place to subdue their hunger. Food quality is pretty decent. Service would get them 4/5 since food is served pretty quickly there.

The place is very close to my office. Exactly right next to the Pathfinder Coaching. I had rolls and parathas and dum aloo several times. Recently I had their Biryani, the place is very cheap. 50 for half plate and 100 for full plate both chicken and mutton. Half plate biryani contains 1 meat 1 potato and rice. Full plate contains 2 meat 1 potato 1 egg and rice. 
The meat pieces were juicy and solid and tasty. The rice too was well balanced and well cooked. 
It is a snacks corner. So do not expect sit and dine. 
Good place to have snacks with friends.

If you are Hungry & low in cash this is where you will get super delicious mind blowing biriyani at affordable price. The half plate biriyani ( 50/-) which consists of a chicken piece , a potato is more than enough for a single person. The chicken roll here is also very tasty.

well if you are passing by Toofani Biriyani nd ur stomach screams for food dont rethink to stop by and have their delicious biriyani. 
i am really amazed by the quality of biriyani they serve at such cheap prices and moreover they serve half plate as well which quiet enough for a single soul. Oh yes forgot about the roll,...  they have a separate counter for rolls nd yes the rolls are toooo good fr a light snack. The fact they dont have a place to dine in is  the only back drop.. but whn Biriyani tastes good who wants to seat .. :D full points for their food .. i still visit them frequently nd thnk God they havnt yet compromised with their quality.
