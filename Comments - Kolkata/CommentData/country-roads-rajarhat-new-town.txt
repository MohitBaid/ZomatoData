The best craft beer in town.
The German Weizen and the Belgian Blonde was super smooth and are definitely a good value for money.
The Chicken Wings was finger licking good.
Equally tasty was the Crispy Chilli Babycorn and the white sauce chicken pasta was no less.
A complete 5/5 for food and drinks.
The ambience is great as well.
Service is fine.
The smoking room needs to be better. That's the only reason I deducted that point.
Must Visit.

The location is a bit off route, but there's a lot of conveyance available, not a prob.. Their in-house beers are to die for... Quality quantity and price of food are also satisfactory.. Beer lovers should definitely visit this place.. one thing I'd suggest, please change your item for house starters.. Roasted papad really turns me off... Try replacing with peanuts or cheeselings.. Even slices of ginger, rock salt and chaat masala would do if you want to cut down on cost..

Location- Located opposite to Axis Mall this place is in The  Gallaria and Country roads is in the second floor of the building 

Ambiance- Country roads is a place which can accommodate a good number of crowd . It has wonderful bar counter with lots of variety and great music. The decor is very catchy.

Food quality - I have tasted their Mughlai , continental and Chinese version and all were as expected . But the crispy chilly chicken which had some fancy name in the menu card could have been much better. 
Chicken Nafis as an appetizer is a must. 
Drinks ordered - Country Roads' special Scottish beer and Belgian beer and Blenders pride
The Scottish beer was excellent while I did not like the Belgian beer after having the Scottish one.
Food quantity and Price- Food quantity is reasonable according to the price.
Staffs and Service - Staffs are courteous and service is decent.

One of the first restaurant to introduce us to created beer

Loved their

Chicken wings - moderately spicy and juicy combines perfectly with the Scottish ale

My favorite beer - scottish ale 

Russian burger tastes pretty well as a main course and fulfilling for the tummy too

Country Roads name is a misnomer for this place. Doesn't give you any feel of country Roads and neither do I think that they intend to. So don't go by name.

They claim to be the first micro brewery of Kolkata. 

A place to visit with your gang and have great gala time.I strongly recommend to visit this place, if you are going in a group of 10+ but I wouldn't recommend if you going to sit their and have small chats. Not that kind of place.

Drinks are great, German Beer and Scottish ones are the best one. Rest are just fine.

Cuisines are average and not a speciality. So, you can obviously have something with your beer but if you plan on having meal then there are better places than this.

Staff was quite helpful and accommodative. Even though we were a boisterous crowd. They handled us very courteously and always with a smile.

Must go place in a large group.

This Microbrewery is located in the Galleria Mall near Central. This place is quiet isolated from the busy city center and crowd is mainly the IT goers. Visited this place for lunch with one of my friend.

The ambience is good gives a food feeling of old American Pub with visible distillers directly connected to the bar.

We ordered - Mango shake, Panko fried fish, Chicken Stroganwoff which tasted very good. One good reason to visit this place is that rates are pocket friendly.

The service was quick, though couple of requested items were not available from the menu.

Country Roads recently got added to my favourite list.
Located in DLF Galleria opposite to the Pride Hotels, this micro-brewery is a heaven for beer lovers.

Drinks:
•Tried Classic Martini(chocolate) and it was perfect, proportion of alcohol to that of Chocolate was well maintained. (Recommended)
•Belgian Blonde: I’d be coming back to Country Roads again and again for this crafted beer. Served in a glass of 500ml quantity, the beer was well crafted, smooth with a slight fruity taste. (Highly recommended)
Other than this two tried Jacob Creek Red, Single malt whiskey, and a couple of beers.

Food:
•Octopussi: Baby Octopus fried in spicy oriental sauce won the prize of being the best Appetizer. The octopuses were well cooked, tasted a bit crunchy and succulent at the same time, went very well with Crafted beer. (Highly Recommended)
•Lamb Sukkasta: Minced pieces of baby lamb along with veggies cooked with perfection, lipsmacking and goes well with Red Wine. (Highly Recommended)
•Grilled Chicken Breast: Chicken breast grilled with wine sauce to perfection, with a nice aroma of wine sauce all over the dish, served with herb rice. I’d like to address it as a perfect main course. (Recommended)

Ambience:
Well decorated with dim lighting and pretty bulbs above every table. One may take a tour to the brewery and witness the brewing process.

Highly Recommended.

Have been here a couple of times but somehow not jotted down a quick review yet... Visited last night as well and found the place to be unusually empty, it being a weekday... The lack of crowds translated to uber prompt service, without compromising on the quality though... 
We ordered only starters to go with the vast array of craft beers... The Wok Fried Fish, Mongolian Fish, Makkhanwala Chicken were just outright brilliant... I also liked their version of the non-veg Nachos with cheese and chicken... 
On the beer front, I tried the German Weizen, Scottish Ale and the Belgian Blonde... The Premium Craft is due for next time, but my suggestion would be to stick to a particular craft at a time... 
One more plus point is nothing here is over-priced and boasts of a great pub ambience... Would definitely go back to try out some of the other dishes and beers...

A micro brewery , that's finally berewing some nice crafted  beer. The german wheat varieties are pretty decent. Though the belgian wheat it's the Scottish ale donot match up to the expectations.

The choice of starters are nice.. We ordered the Mushroom Salt and Pepper, Cajun Spiced potato, and both were authentically done. The Murg Nafees kebab is unique. The Golden fried prawn is also crispy and nice.

The service would definitely need more warmth and friendliness. 

The ambience is nice with soft lighting and lots of seating area. Plenty of parking, as the mall is mostly unoccupied.

The bar cum restaurant is located in a seems-like-abandoned mall 😊. But it has a good vibe to it. I liked it. Courteos people. We had few draft beers brewed in the restaurant and they were light and good enough. along with it we had chiken tikka, mozzarella sticks, potato wedges and shredded lamb item cooked with onions and capsicum. chicken tikka was pretty good with big and soft pieces which were nicely marinated and cooked. Coming to the mozzarella item... i have to say “take it off your menu”. and there is a diffrence between mozzarella and american cheese. it was not good. shredded lamb was good when hot. ambience was good in the restaurants and even at 11:30 at night there were many people in the restaurant. overall good experience.

One fine Saturday afternoon my husband decides to take me for a date & we chose this place.                   
The location is not so difficult to find, galleria building 2nd floor. Once you enter the place it gives you a country feeling. They brew their own beer. Hygiene is well maintained.
We had a coupon from Little Deals which had 1 ltr of house beer & 1 plate of crispy chilli baby corn. So ordered 500 ml of house beer & one non-veg platter. 
Talking about the beer we ordered for german ale. It was quite subtle and smooth. Crispy chilli baby corn was perfect, it was one of the best baby corn I tasted so far. They put sesame seeds which elevated the taste more. Flavours were intact. Non-veg platter had calamari, served with mayo, which was a little over fried and chewy however the outside coating of it saved the taste. It had seekh kebabs, full of flavours and the certain heat from the spice made it quite bang on. Platter had 4 chicken wings, according to me that was the best portion. Wings were coated with balsamic glaze, garlic and spice mixed. I completely loved 4 of them best part of the platter. Lastly there was one tangri kebab which was pretty bland and chewy in taste. All of it was served with cabbage and mint chutney and mayo. 
If we talk about value for money, the coupon costed us 529/- and rest of the bill was of 796/- adding a corporate discount. This place could’ve been a 4 but one small thing I felt about was that the waiter didn’t ask us if he would serve for us. He just put the food on the table and left without anything. Else it was a good afternoon well spent, worth another visit.

My 2nd visit to the place with my spouse after more than a year. Was pleasantly surprised to know that they serve 4 different beers now instead of just one, as it was during our 1st visit.

The place exudes the charm of a genuine microbrewery, rather than a gastro-pub. Brightly lit and ample seating arrangements with hight tables, and even arrangements for families and large groups. You can walk in solitary, in small groups, large groups, stags – everyone is welcome.You can even bring in your kid. All this gives the impression of a comfortable family joint, rather than a place selling just beer.

Friendly service staff, friendly manager, who made us feel welcome. We had parked ourselves at the bar counter due to space paucity but the manager (baldish with a French cut) took the initiative to suggest us a table, which we took. A friendly bloke who took interest in what you are interested in and strike up a conversation. He informed us that by the Pujas, there will be two more flavours introduced, but unfortunately, not stout beer as that is not popular. Being a beer aficianado, I was more than excited to try out all the flavours available and I did, though, my wife stuck to the wheat beer.

They have 4 beers on tap – Premium Lager, German Wheat, Scottish Ale, Belgian Blonde.

The food is of good quality too, along with the respectable crowd. There are a few places which truly suck because of the crowd quality.

I can think of only two negative points:

1. The place is at quite a distance from our place so its quite a drive in the traffic.

2. The washroom for the ladies needs to be clean (as stated by my wife). Pls do employ women janitors.

Otherwise, it was a good evening out, far far better than the pathetically running The Grid.

Have already visited on several more occasions and will continue do do so even though, driving breaks my back!  

P.S. Unfortunately, the expectation of more beers on tap is not going to happen. The manager informed me of the amount of money the state govt takes away as tax for each litre of beer produced. Hence, sadly for beer lovers, the plan is currently shelved.

This place is too good for enjoying the best beer... the brewing is just perfect which gives the beer an altogether different and great taste. The ambience reminds of the real country road side shops where you can sit and enjoy the drinks. Another drink which I really like is the Country Roads special LIIT, which is awesome in taste. The food here also tastes good. We have tried both continental and indian, both are equally good. The ambience is lively and the service is good. It is always a place of going out on a date with my fiànce.

Good ambiance. Alcohol. Near office. Music. Good food.After a lot of discussion, we decided to hit the microbrewery, a few kilometers away from our office.

Ambiance and staff:
Good, lively, dim and has this old American feel throughout. High rise table and chairs, a semi lounge style seating, or proper dine out sofas were there. Loved the light and the blend of blue and yellow light. All around. The distilleries of the beers were pretty visible, and had connecting taps to the bar counter. The smoking room was pretty small and did not boast of a good exhaust either.
Staff was pretty well behaved and knowledgeable with the food in the venue and often suggested a few as per our liking. They were really helpful, post getting drunk too.

Alcohol:
We started off with their in-house beers,
1. Scottish Ale: Pretty light but a bit more bitter than the normal bottled ones out there. 
2. Belgian Blonde: This was the man of the match, as it tasted different and better from what we have.
3. German Weizen: Pretty much the same as the Scottish counterpart.

Apart from the above, we did try our hands, in the 
1. Gold and silver variants of their tequila.
2. Baileys Irish cream and 
3. A pitcher of LIIT, dark rum cola based.

Food:We focused mainly on appetizers, 
1. Wok fried fish: Tasted normal. Was really crispy, and the flavors were on spot
2. Yakitori: Teriyaki sauce dipped chicken. Did not really like the extra salty and acidity the dish had
3. Mongolian Chicken: Tasted more of schezwan chicken, with extra hot and soy. Probably the worst decision we took

For mains, we stuck to bread and burgers
1. Triple X Sauce Russian Burger. Pure chicken burger with salads in excess and a sauce, which they call sinful, but is pretty average and normal
2. Mozzarella Stick hot Dog: Liked this one more, as the mozzarella really made up for the rubbery fillers filled inside.For a quick drink or two if your office is nearby, this place can be a good choice.

One of the worst restaurant in  town ,aaa
Atrocious behavior by the waiters .
They are not able to treat customers properly..  The moment they take orders,  they are prepared to show the exit to their customers.  
Beware before entering .. You might not be served to your expectations  !!

The staffs are almost untrained, bordering rudeness. The management is also not clear as to how to run the place. Further the choice of the craft beers made here did not seem much varied in taste on my palate. Food, on the other hand, is average.

Ordered through Swiggy from this restaurant hoping to try some different thing.
And it was different too.
Had ordered Veg Schezwan Fried Rice.
WARNING: Please reconsider taking this dish or tell the hotel to not put “Red Chillies”.
So so many Red Chillies that you will surely curse yourself next day for what you ate the night before.
Taste was good but hell spicy.
Delivery was before time.

The food was quite good,however, the service was really poor. I have been to other breweries but this was below the standard. They didn't offer us their brews to taste and decide, so we just had to randomly pick one. The main drawback was there was a weird smell lingering around.

Located Near Hometown in Galleria Building Rajarhat,newtown. The building is quite desolated from the hustle and bustle of the city ,so you might find it difficult to locate for the first time. But googlemaps does the magic as usual. 
This is a brewery and the beer is quite good here but not that amazing .

What I ordered -

1.POLLO STEAK AUS ROSEMARY JUS 

2.YAKITORI : ( which is skewered grilled chicken with teriyaki sauce ) , which tasted good 

3.WOK FRIED FISH WITH BELL PEPPER : This dish is basically fish ,which is pre marinated ,and pan fried with bell pepper and red wine .This is a star dish. So do try 

4.MOZZARELLA STICKS : This tasted crispy as it was crumb fried and served with a lipsmacking coronna dip .

5.CHILLI PARATHA : This was something new, as the paratha was infused with green chillies and red pepper. 

6.ROGHNI NAN : This was lipsmacking as the nan was deep fried. So do try.

Prices are reasonable and the ambience is good , but the food came very late. Service should be a bit fast .

Good things first..food is nice! That's it.
Ambience..ok!
Staffs..too much confused and don't know what to do! You order a beer and wait for an eternity to get that.
Now comes the best part.. Policies..in one word..lame! You get to taste 4 of their craft beer in shot glasses only once.. whether you come alone or in a group of 10..
You get a complementary papad only once..no matter how many times you repeat your beer or drinks.
P.S. Please change your stupid policies..and be a little more flexible with your clients!

The ambience is decent. The craft beers are enjoyable. The quality of service is moderate. Some of the food items were not on the menu and being a first timer to the place I felt very disappointed looking at the food and drinks ordered by people around me. The servers also didn't provide much help with the selection of food and drinks. 
The service needs to be improved. Otherwise a decent place to hangout over the weekend.

I happened to visit this place after a friends recommendation..
It is in the Galleria building near Hometown in Rajarhart.
The building is very desolated and the place is right in the top floor.
The place ambeiance is not so happening comapred to the new brewries in city.
I was very dissapointed by the quality of snacks served..(veg)
Potato Wedges , corn salt and pepper were amongst the few I ordered.(overcooked and very spicy)
The drought served was also not upto mark.
I recommend to please improve on it but yes despite so much complains the waiters were very courteous and patient..

For county roads-if u a die hard fan of beer,a visit to this s a must place. Out of the three flavours that are served-scottish ale is the best rest flavours are also good. They have a soothing ambience & excellent service. Quality food at cheaper rates are served. But the babycorns needs to b more crispy in the chilly babycorns. Location is a bit odd for country roads.
Overall, a place one must love and for the very same reason I have visited this palace a dozen times.

Been there a couple of times and the best thing I like about that place is its beer and ambience. They brew three types of beer - german, scottish and belgian which tastes way better than domestics. Whether you prefer domestic liquor or premium or imported, alcohol buds will find every type in the menu. Food is great though not awesome. Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines are on the menu. Only thing I find irritating is that most Indian non veg starters are not boneless and to me, the Indian side of apetizers is a bit limited. Otherwise lots of food options to choose. Tried Octopus for the first time there. Was good and it had that seafood aroma. Ambience is top notch but you would need to go early on weekend evenings to grab a comfy sofa corner otherwise you will have to adjust on tools. Would recommend only if you wanna try some good crafted beers.

Karaoke nights, DJ nights, local brewery, loud music and comparable ambience will make your evenings special if you visit this Microbrewery. It is located opposite to the youngest shopping destination in the town; Central in New Town.
Kudos to the management for selection of such a vast number of Continental , Chinese and Indian dishes in their menu. 
They are good in what they serve was proved when we tried Ceaser Salad and Golden Fried Babycorn. Along with the appetizers we tried regular Chinese dishes like Hakka noodles and Manchurian. 
 I would like to recommend Kiwi's group and Orange Virgin Mohito for teetotalers. The orange and kiwi pulps added vigour and taste to the mocktails; undoubtedly my favorites.
A bonus for IT executives working in the vicinity.

Pathetic experience. This place was relatively empty when I went today with my wife. I asked table with a sofa as we didn't want to sit on the high stool table. Since two table of 6 was available they initially refused to give it. I asked if there was a prior booking and I was told that it was not reserved. They asked me to wait and finally I got a table for 6. We order a starter, a beer and a soft drink. Food was good and the beer was also nice. Till suddenly a waiter by the name of Pinto ( my wife asked his name specifically) came to us and said "I need this table". You forget that in a service industry it's always a request. We were about to order a second round but stopped and asked for the bill. When the same waiter brought the bill I told him I was about to order a second round but his behaviour forced me to ask for the bill. Instead of apologising or offering us another table, his reply was OK. This is a restaurant where food and service must compliment for a great experience. If I was the owner I would look into this seriously, unless he has other thoughts. So I will never suggest this place.

Our favourite orders are pepper mushroom, lamb ribs in Chinese or tandoori preparation.Its a casual hangout place ideal to go out after long day at office with colleagues or friends.Their choice of music is poor 😂 and the desserts are average nevertheless I would definitely recommend a visit for the beer and the ribs!

Went to this place a couple of weeks back with friends on a Saturday! 
Ambience -- 3.5/5 … This place has got a 'soothing-to-the-eye' decor inside. With high chairs, couches, etc. Lightings are calm, not to vibrant which makes the eyes go crazy! Has got enough space to entertain 70-100 guests at one go. Lacks a dance floor.

Food & Beverage -- 3.8/5 … This being a microbrewery, serves pretty good beers i.e. German, Scottish & Belgium. They all tasted good. They happen to serve another crafted "Premium" beer (Not in the menus) which simply won over the former three. Do ask for special offers/menus of the day. Food was not upto the mark. Well, maybe the beers made my expectations higher. Food was average.

Staff -- 4/5 … Staffs were courteous. Well behaved, friendly and always around when you need them. 

The location of this place makes it bit tricky to locate [Thanks to Google Maps]. Maybe that's why it lacked the crowd even on a Saturday evening...

There's a lot of scope of improvement «One of them being giving tasting samples of home brew to the guest» I'm afraid, I wasn't given. Nonetheless, this place is recommended!

But I got some great "garlic bread" for my beer sides.
You might call it garlic naan. Cause that's what it is. But naan, bread. Garlic. It's ok and it's delicious.

Needless to say one of the best micro brewery in the area which is already over crowded with bars and pouring houses. Nice decent place. Being a Sunday it was less crowded and we got a seat easily without waiting. Choice of fresh brews are only three with 2 option in sizes. The finger food we ordered also did not take much time and was served piping hot. 
Try chicken wings in Barbeque sauce..goes well with Scottish ale or German beer. Lal maas though being spicy..but was really good. Pocket pinch for 2 inclusive GST 1500. Quite reasonable. Look forward to visit again.

Looking for a quiet place to chill with friends after a long stretch of shopping, this microbrewery caught our eyes. Located in a secluded place, this restaurant was first recommended for their varieties of beer. But the waiter turned us a bit off as he was insisting us to seat on the long stools many a times as we were 3 people and seated on a 6 people's table. Finally we settled in a table for four. We ordered lime soda, German weizen(wheat beer basically). In food we took, mushroom salt and pepper and shrimp noodles. Though mushroom dish was pretty good, noodles was a bit too sweet for our taste. Then we took brownie with icecream for dessert. It didn't impress us as we got a burnt smell from it. Though ambience was relaxing, I am pretty sure that it was just a one time visit place.

The fact that there's a brewery just a 2-minute drive from my home is quite satisfying. However, only the Scottish ale suits my tastebuds out of just three variants of brew. The barbeque chicken wings and wok fried fish go quite well along side whatever drink you order. Besides, the decor and music, along side good service, offer me ideal, lazy Sunday evenings to chill with buds. People staying in Rajarhat should head to this place to detox on weekends.

Absolutely not worth the money. To begin with, the location is thoroughly inconvenient and the beer they brew is below average. The food and drinks are overpriced and the food is frankly boring. The staff is untrained, the servers are inattentive and entirely uninterested in the customers and their experience, and they don't have the first idea of their own products and don't know how to advice customers on the menu. The menu cards are torn and falling apart, they look moth eaten. The food section has nothing to offer except chicken and fish, it looks like the menu was put together by waiter at a "Dhaba", to say nothing about the taste of the food. It would all be acceptable if the pricing was modest too, which it is extremely not. Knitting a blanket out of your currency notes would be a more admirable waste of the same rather than throwing it at this establishment.

This is one such place which is located in a desolate area - The Galleria mall in Newtown opposite to Novotel.
The decor is fantastic and the ambience is a cream on the fudge!!
Food is basically Italian, American, Chinese, Thai, English, Continental and oriental cuisines which they make very delightfully tasty.
Coming to the mai part in which they are renowned for that is Micro Brewery - In Kolkata there are limited micro brewery and this is one of the best serving 4 types of brewed beer.
The price is reasonable for brewery, but other drinks are remarkably higher.
Food is Fantastic and worthy of the penny spent!!
Keep up the good work and kindly introduce more brewed beers with some more tinge of alcohol.

And although it was a bit confusing to locate the place as it was situated in a building that did not look at all like hangout hub, once we reached it was like uncovering a hidden jewel in the middle of nowhere. I was amazed to see that they made the place quite hep and very Gen-Y theme based. The ambiance was great, we began to settle down nicely. We had ordered 2 Scottish Ale craft beers, along with a Chk. Stronganoff and a Burger. Plus Chk. Wings of 8pcs, and that was it. The food was great, the beer was greater. As a beer lover, I loved the Scottish Ale, it gave a very smooth flavour making it a great accompaniment to the food. Overall, I feel that Country Roads has lived up to the hype. Just try to make the service a bit more faster.

Excellent craft beer! Food is okay! We ordered fried calamori and mutton liver platter. Calamori was good in that price but mutton liver was a bit spicy.

1. The brewery is good as in Kolkata there are few options only..
2. Coming to the food..U can expect capcicum & onion on all dishes irrespective of whether it compliments the dish or not..Selection of spices are very poor...
3. Service - They will not let u sit in a 4 seater sofa even the place is vacant and there are hardly any people inside...And if u insist they will tell u have to shift if people comes and that too rudely..

Serving of the dishes are in cheap plates without any sense of how to serve...and the waiters will casually put the plates on ur table...

Overall the behavior and service is poor...Brewery is good but again food sucks..

Looking for a perfect restaurant away from the hustle bustle of the city, which serves really good food? Country Roads is here, mate! Located at Newtown, at the Dlf Galleria Mall, Country Roads is one of the best places to go for chilling over some beer and good food! The fact that it's a microbrewery piques your interest to try their beer, which is by far one of the best in the city!

Subham Ghosh and I were invited here for a food tasting session, which turned out to be a hit!
First of all, the long drive is something to look forward to, plus the free carpark at the mall is a bonus. So the next time you wanna take your sweetheart for a long drive and wrap the day with some good food, do drop by, and I can assure you won't be disappointed.

The interior is done up in a very upbeat manner, which plush sofas and bar stools. The microbrewery set is on display and is quite a sight, to be honest. The fact that the beer you'll be having is being brewed then and there is quite a plus point!

Coming straight to the menu for the afternoon.

On arriving, we were served with their speciality - different brews of beer. Staring with German Weizen to Premium Beer, to Belgian Blonde and lastly Scottish Ale. Each of the beers had different shades and tasted distinct. While the Scottish Ale was too strong for me, the Belgian Blonde and German Weizen were clear winners. Such a "beerful" afternoon!

We were served with a number of appetizers to munch on while sipping on chilled beer.

• Thai Crispy Veg - This was an assortment of veggies starting from broccoli to potatoes to mushroom and what not cooked in sweet and sour sauce. And it tasted heavenly!

• Mongolian Chicken - One of the best dishes of the afternoon! Shredded chicken cooked in spicy sauce with a generous amount of bell peppers. This dish was love!

• Rice Cake Fritters - Honestly, I had never tried Rice Cake and here I was munching on them nonstop! The fritters had the perfect amount of crunch and well amazingly well with beer.

• Veg Balls - Don't get fooled by the name, this isn't like any other veg pakora you've ever had! What intrigued me most was the outer covering of poppy seeds which added a distinct flavour to this dish.

• Murgh Nafis - How can you have beer without some kebabs? It's downright sinful! So we started the kebab fiesta with this dish, which was brilliant. The chicken pieces were tender and had a creamy yogurt based marination! Perfect with the German Weizen!

• Chicken Haryali Kebab - Another classic kebab dish which can never go wrong when paired with a glass of chilled beer! The chicken pieces were juicy and succulent and were grilled just the right amount! Amazing.

Time for the Main Course now.

• Mie Goreng - This dish, or the Indonesian Flat Noodles is another speciality of Country Roads. And how well it was prepared! So much so, that we didn't even need a side dish with it. The noodles had a soothing green colour, and had the perfect texture.

• Chicken Steak - Two breast pieces of chicken served on a bed of Herb rice, and sauteed veggies, this was another perfect dish. The chicken steak was saucy and tasted very good with the rice.

To wash down the main course, we were served two mocktails - Kiwi Cooler and Orange Mojito! Honestly, I loved both of them. Both were refreshing and had the perfect amount of fizz!

With this our scrumptious lunch came to an end, and in conclusion I would say that Country Roads is a must visit!
Another thing that I loved was the hospitality! The chef himself came and interacted with us, and suggested us the best items. Places like this are bound to win your heart. The service too, is quick, and the staff is always ready to assist you with a smile.

I had an amazing afternoon here! And I'll be back again for sure!

One of the very few breweries in Kolkata. Definitely worth a visit. Good place to go with friends. Quite a few varieties of beers are present on the bar menu even though all were not available. As a brewery it's expected to house all the flavours of beer that are present on the menu. The ambiance is nice but the location could have been better. Just a suggestion guys....Move the brewery closer to Infospce and business will be blooming....

Country Roads is one of the finest microbreweries in the city. This is located on the 2nd floor of Galleria Mall. I was invited here for a food tasting session with Nilanjana Bagchi

The interiors are cool and well done. The seating is very comfortable. We were welcomed by the chef who served us a number of their speciality dishes.

We first tried four variants of beer which are prepared in house - German, Belgian, Scottish and Premium. Each of the flavours tasted good and distinctly different from the others. I personally loved the German and Premium ones.

To munch with the beer, we tried some appetizers. From the oriental section, we had Thai Crispy Veg, Mongolian Chicken and Rice Cake Fritters. The veg was sweet and crispy. It somehow impressed more than the chicken dish. The Mongolian Chicken was soft and flavourful. The rice cakes were crispy, with a delicious stuffing inside.

The Indian appetizers were Murgh Nafis, Chicken Haryali Kebab and Veg Balls. The Nafis was soft and creamy, with a yoghurt based marination. The Haryali Kebab tasted brilliant with the chicken being perfectly grilled. The Veg Balls were innovative as they were coated with poppy seeds to impart an extra crunch.

We had two mocktails - Kiwi Cooler and Orange Virgin Mojito. The Kiwi Cooler was chilled, fizzy and refreshing. It had a beautiful balance of flavours. The Orange Mojito was slightly tangy.

In the main course, we started with Mie Goreng. It is a type of Indonesian Flat Noodles. They were well boiled and tasted great. One can easily have this without any side dish. The Chicken Steak was good, though I found the chicken to be a little stiff. The sauce tasted nice.

Overall, Country Roads is an amazing place to spend some time over some good food and drinks. I'm surely coming soon to try the other dishes on their menu.

Country roads, well the name has no significance with the place. I thought itd be a nice place after I saw the pictures  however it turned out to be a really pathetic place in terms of service, beer, food, location and atmosphere. We entered the place and had a little argument with the staff regarding the seating , there were four of us and found the table he allocated to us to be a little small so we decided to shift to a bigger table only to realise that "their policy" didn't allow 4 guests to sit on a 6 seater table. Its really petty for a restaurant to make issues over such small things. If a guest is not comfortable to sit at an allocated table the restaurant should do everything to make the guest feel better. The next big turn off was the beer, a microbrewery should be making good cold fizzy beer, the beer served was bare minimum cold and flat. Also we found an insect in our beer(made me wanna throw up) we ordered bbq wings to realise it's their chilly chicken wings served on a broken plate.

Really sad to see a place such bad food, give horrible service and most importantly serve BAD BEER WITH INSECTS!!  

Wouldnt suggest anyone to come to this pathetic excuse for a restaurant to spoilt their evening.

Awesome ambience, nice music, courtous staff makes this a happening place for the young. The place went full by 8 'o'  clock in a Sunday night. Its inside The Galleria which was pretty empty as very few showrooms have opened but this place alone makes Galleria a busy place. Drinks and food both are reasonably priced. This place has microbrewery of its own where three flavoured beers are available- german, scottish and belgian. We tried both German and Scottish but liked the scottish ale more. We had tried starters only and there indian starters are far better than the chinese ones. Mutton sheek kebab is a must try and noorjahani tikka is also good. Tried cocktails and mocktails also which were pretty descent too. Overall a nice and happening place to visit with friends.

We ordered Honey Chilli Chicken Wings(good),Corn Salt and Pepper(good), Mozzarella cheese sticks(not as good as we expected), Chicken Wings in BBQ sauce(okayish) with all types of beer. Personally I liked the Scottish Ale. For Main course, we had Tandoori Roti, Prawn Lababdar, Murgh Makhan Shahi, Kashmiri Pulao and Mixed Veg Pulao all of which were good enough. Overall, we enjoyed a nice Friday eve with good starters!

Hidden gem of Rajarhat

Food: We ordered a Dry Schezwan chicken, an Yakitori and a Brownie flammbe. The spicy schezwan chicken was extremely good to taste and especially with the special sauce they served, it refreshed our palate. The Yakitori was a bit downer in its part mainly due to it’s sweet taste. However, the chicken served were very fresh and well cooked. But the best item was the brownie flammbe. A smoking hot brownie was placed on the table in a sizzler plate and burning Honeybee brandy was poured over it. And the brownie was literally set on fire!! As the flames burned off the brandy, we started eating the brownie and found that the brandy has mixed with the brownie in an extremely even way resulting in an awesome gastronomic pleasure. This was an instant favorite and we decided to return again just to try this very dish one more time.

Ambience: The restaurant is located on the second floor of Galleria, walking distance from the Rajarhat Central mall. We went there after a tiring shopping session at Central. The entire of galleria looks like a deserted place like the ones we see in zombie movies. Plenty of empty nooks n corners available, ideal for horny couples!! However, once you cross the deserted look of galleria, u reach this small microbrewery cum restaurant. The seating arrangement is plush, interior decorations very good. The bar at one side is well equipped with choice of drinks as well. But the main attraction is the microbrewery located inside the restaurant. However, the choice of music and the continuous recap of cricket matches on the live screen were a bit downer for me. The place remained more or less empty during our visit. Parking is available inside galleria, free of cost. 

Service: The staffs were helpful. But we had to call for them every time we needed water or we needed the next dish. There is room for improvement in the service. Cash n card both accepted. And there is no system of giving tips! The place being empty, we sat and ate and had a long long chat without being disturbed at all. 

Overall: Nice place to have foods, drinks and to chat with your friends. Hard to find restaurant, but definitely recommended for anyone in that area.

Tried the German Weißen beer pitcher and Long Island Iced Tea with Mushroom Salt and Pepper and Crispy Chilly Babycorn to go along. 
Beer tasted fresh as it should in a microbrewery. The Iced Tea however did not meet expectations. The food tasted okay-ish too. Thankfully the menu is not too long which indicates they have stayed with their strengths. Where they earn brownie points though are the prices.
Ambience is cosy and service is quick. Staff are polite.
Drop by if you are primarily looking for a refreshing drink alone or while catching up with your buddies.

This particular brewery is located in "Galleria" in Newtown area. While you are on your passage towards entry of country roads , you will have to pass thru the empty halls and deserted shops of Galleria which would make you wonder if you are making a good choice coming in here....... Believe me ...you are

Ambience : It is well lit and the seating arrangement is spacious and not congested. Its not a big place. So you might find it to be crowded , especially on a weekend. (This brewery is slowly becoming the talk of this part of the town). Will give 4 out of 5 for Ambience

Music :  Well , if you're a rock lover , you are in for disappointment.  In general too , who likes hearing "hit me baby one more time" while you're drinking beer/scotch. Its even ok to mix it up for the various people coming in and would be nice if they play a few numbers from Dire straits, Metallica , Nirvana , GnR , Rolling Stones etc. 1 out of 5 for music

Service : Staff were very friendly and would communicate regarding the choice of beers , food and would make sure we order the right thing. They will even offer their different beers for tasting in case you are not sure which one you want to order. 5 out of 5 for Service

Food : Almost all the food are tasty (atleast what so far i have tasted). Chicken Wings and Mongolian Chicken are my favorites. People loving fish should try mongolian fish. Mutton kababs are not well cooked(although its better in aminia , i tried it once as the difference here is they cook it in barbecue sauce.). If you are drinking beer , mongolian fish/chicken would be perfect compliment due to its lil spicy flavour along with the pepper...(those having allergy to pepper stay away from this one). 4 out of 5 for Food.

Beer : This brewery offers 4 major beers. People who love wheat beer would love the German Weizen served here. This one is my personal favorite here along with the premium beer. The other 2 beers are scottish ale and belgian blonde. These two will be liked by people who would prefer a certain fruity, honeyed flavour or a smell of caramel in their beers.  I liked the scottish ale amongst the 2 more. 4 out of 5 for Beer

All in All these 4 beers would be loved by people who love the wooden aroma of the draught beer, well balanced malted beers and the food here is certainly not bad...

Was pleasantly surprised to find a bar with a lively ambience and amazing brewed beer in the midst of a building which has only closed shops. The Belgian beer is a must try for everyone visiting this place for the first time. We also quite liked the Scottish Ale. For food, we had ordered three chicken starters and they were very prompt with their service. The only thing that did disappoint me a little was the music, probably because we went on a weekday at a time which isn't very crowd pulling. But overall, had a good experience in this place and their brewed beer is definitely the attraction for this place.

Standing isolated near rajarhat new town, this place is quick get away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
The location is quite decent but it might get a bit spooky as the surrounding area is silent and empty amd not much of pedestrians or roadsiders nearby. So given a thought of safety, one might consider dropping by with a group or so when exceeding the usual evening hour.

Coming to the food, no complains but could have been better. We had ordered noodles and chilly chicken. Descent taste and flavour but had those extra spoons of salt and the tangy flavour in it.

However the service is not so decent. The waiters waiting your table will throw in your plates towards you and you need to have quick hands to catch it. The rude and arrogant attitude will also have to be tolerated along with the very unwanted loud music. Food will be served late and they will definitely spare time in checking the ladies more rather than sparing some time on their deaignated activity.


Having said all the above, one thing that it does good is that it does little or no damage to your wallet.


P.S: Work on your weaknesses.

Terrible service. Asked for fresh plates thrice even after which we dint get it. Beer wasn't chilled at all. Food was not that good to be honest. Service personnel were kind of rude. Not a good experience.

This place serves the best freshly brewed beer in Kolkata. If you are a beer lover then this is definitely the place you need to visit. Food is good but slightly overpriced. The ambience is good and this place has big tv screens so you can enjoy cricket and football matches.

A really cool experience. Me and my gang visited this place after hearing about it from many friends. This place rocks. They have ticked all the check boxes on this one. Good food, good beer(try the Scottish ale), classy interiors and upbeat music. I
Since it's a microbrewery, I have to talk about their beers.I liked the ale and the Belgian beer but the rest of the 2 not so much. Go for the 24 piece chicken wing spread, its the ultimate beer food. We had 2 rounds of beer and a pitcher of LIIT(has enough alcohol to fuel a rocket ship). So come and grab ur mug full of beer at this place. P.s, this place should of special interest to single people as the crowd is great. Cheers to that 😎.

This is my first visit to this new addition @Newtown. I have already heard a lot of good things about this place from my friends. So we hit the floor and had an great experience. The collection of beer is impressive, the Orange virgin mohito was also very nice in non-alcoholic section. We ordered crispy chilly babycorn, fish and chicken dishes also. Most yummy was the garlic bread. And the chef special Tandoori Bhetki needs a special mention, it was outstanding. The staff was very friendly, specially Mr. Saleem was very enthusiastic and helpful towards us.

If not anything, one must go here for their beers. The place has a microbrewery and as you can see on the menu, there are several types of draught beer on offer. I tasted the German beer and it was great (and I dont even like beer that much) The food is good, we ordered some snacks to go along with a pitcher of Long Island Iced Tea, which was again well made. The staff is really, really great and courteous. The place has a brilliant lighting and good music. Everything's great, but the place is kinda hard to reach if you aren't availing a cab (read, you gotta walk some, which I, being the laziest guy on the planet, don't want to do much)

If you are a IT professional working in Newtown Kolkata looking for some after office booze then this is your nearest destination.Located just opposite of the axis mall.Coming to the food and drinks it has in house microbrewery like some other pubs in Kolkata.You get to taste before you order these crafted beer.My suggestion will be scottish beer.The service is very good and the staffs are very well behaved.Food is not upto the mark could have been better.You can try the phuchka​ shots as it's kind of new.

We have been there quite a few times. I don't know whether I have reviewed it earlier or I missed it somehow. This place attracts a lot of crowd during the weekends & despite enough seating arrangements the waiting is there...!!!
Amazing home brewed craft Beers, we all loved all three flavors( German, Belgian & Scottish) ...however didn't like their newly brewed Premium one... Very well equipped cosy bar, good collection music being played...enjoyed IPL match...
BBQ Wings & Russian Burger is must try...
The pocket pinch is also not heavy...
Above & all the atmosphere enhances the actual Microbrewery feeling with courteous & jovial staffs by the showmanship of the manager Sanjay...!!!

A place which is not that known... But its worth knowing.. love the place and had been here a number of times and not even once it has disheartened us.. its a microbrewery so they brew their own beer.. on my first visit our main motive was to try their beer but somehow we did not find it that great so we ordered their cocktail ROADERS which is said to be the great ancestor of LIIT and believe me its ultimate...then next visit we tried another cocktail which was GANG BANG..which was a fruity citrus and very fresh cocktail... The pitchers are quite reasonably priced.. coming to food we always tried the days special menu in fish.. and it was decent..nothing extraordinary.. coming to ambiance a feel good relaxed ambiance to enjoy your evening with friends...and  not to forget good staff... Overall I love country roads..!! .

Considering the upmarket appeal that this restaurant wishes to appeal, it has to fine tune a lot of micro services. 
Beer: good. 
Food: marked price way above what it should be.  Got half cooked mutton which they replaced (at least they acknowledged their shortcoming)
 Ambience: 
Visual: average 
Lighting: the owner must be concerned about global warming. 
Television: three 32 inches Televisions  serves the purpose of existence, not visual experience.
music: yes, only if your inclination is towards techno genre; And punjabi songs when you are drunk. No live music btw.
Sound quality: excellent
Seating arrangement: similar to dharmatala bars.

A perfect place to sit, relax and chug down some cool craft beer to beat the sweltering heat. Located just opposite axis mall, the place has a comfortable setting about its interiors that adds to the ambience. 
Three interesting choices for craft beer; the belgian blonde which lives up to its name, ever smooth on the palate like the Scottish Yale and strong like the German. 
Being an ardent beer drinker, a few more options would do better however all three are brewed to perfection. The perfect combination of craft beer and the chicken wings is a match made in heaven.
The place doesn't burn a big hole in the pocket, add to that the friendly employees; a must visit for all craft beer lovers.

If you don't drink alcohol, simply don't go. Main course food is rubbish. Price is high enough which doesn't justify the quality specially taste. I have eaten over a thousand restaurants around the country and the cook is cheating with names of the dishes. It's like you ordered biriyani and got polao instead.

Country Roads , a restaurant cum bar and microbrewery, relatively new,  that mainly  serves North Indian, Chinese, Continental  (focused mainly on bar food) and German, Belgian and Scottish beer.

Location - 2nd floor, Galleria building, Rajarhat New town, Kolkata. 

Ambience - Cosy ambience , dimly lit wooden restro bar with good music and with apt environment of a bar. The place is spacious with good sitting arrangements.

Staffs & Service - Staffs are courteous and well trained with prompt service.

We Panchphoron team went on a food tasting event and had the following - 

The beers  served were tingling, bit bitter with a hint of sweetness and were good, can't find any fault.

Oriental Noodles – Delicious stir fry noodles infused with a combination of Oriental spices. It was palatable, well cooked, flavourful with generous fillings.

Lawrence Chicken –  This was smoky grilled Chicken breasts  and legs, served with Green Pudina Chutney was flavourful and juicy.

SS Mustard Chicken – Chicken grilled in honey and mustard sauce. It was awesomely flavourful and delicious . Highly recommended.....!!

Haryali Paneer Tikka – 
Grilled Cottage cheese cubes marinated in green paste or chutney which has ingredients like Pudina , coriander, green chillies, ginger- garlic paste, spices etc. It was lipsmacking and well cooked.

Nasi Goreng –  literally meaning ' fried rice ' in Indonesia and  Malay can refer simply to fried pre-cooked rice, a meal including stir fried rice in a small amount of cooking oil  or margarine , typically spiced with sweet soy sauce,  shallot , garlic,  ground shrimp paste , tamarind and chilli and accompanied by other ingredients, particularly egg,  chicken and prawns. It is distinguished from other Asian fried rice recipes by its aromatic, earthy and smoky flavor, owed to generous amount of caramelized sweet soy sauce and powdered shrimp paste, and the taste is stronger and spicier. It was well cooked and tasty.

Yakitori – Marinade in a savory sweet sauce, these chicken and scallion skewers (Negima) are hard to resist!  Yakitori is commonly made with bite-sized pieces of chicken meat, chicken offal, or other meats and vegetables skewered on a bamboo stick and grilled over charcoal. Yakitori are usually available in izakaya restaurants (Japanese tapas) . It was irresistible.

Laziz Tangri – Stuffed chicken Drumstick marinated with chef special spices were subtly spiced but very flavorful & succulent.

California Fried Chicken – Chicken breast marinated with herbs and corn flakes deep fried. It was crunchy from outside but soft and succulent from inside. A must try .....!!

Golden Fried Prawn – Deep batter fried medium sized prawn served with hot Garlic sauce. It was nicely made and mouth watering.

Wok Fried Fish – Well marinated fish pan fried tossed with bell pepper. The sauce served with it was tangy and a perfect combo with the fish. It tasted awesome.

Country Special Non Veg Platter –   

1)The Lawrence Chicken

2)Makhmali Seekh Kebab – Delicate and delicious, Makhmali Sheek Kabab is a great combination of soft-minced chicken, spices and creamy cheese.  It was thoroughly yummy.

3)Chicken Wings –  is an U.S cuisine (flapper or drumette) that is generally deep-fried , unbreaded, and coated in vinegar-based cayenne pepper hot sauce and butter. It was served with  special house sauce.

4)Deep Fried Calamari (Squid) – .Crispy and perfectly deep fried calamari.  It tasted nice.

Prices are quiet reasonable along with good quality drinks and amazing food. Non - alcoholics can also come here to relish their amazingly tasty food.

Special thanks to the management of Country Roads for their warm reception & hospitality.

Thank you Rajdeep da for your invitation.

Yummy food it was,what an ambience it was. The place impressed me with its marvellous  taste of food and beverages. I was introduced to MICROBREWERY with whom i feel in love with...dont take me wrong its kind of freshly brewed beer. 
Belgium blonde beer and German weizen beer  welcomed itself with its magnificent  taste.
Beer is the speciality of this place. The presentation of the food is palatable ah!splendid. 
Me along with my squad had a fun experience. The only  con of this place is its location.
The staffs were well behaved and they welcomed with a smile.
The place is worth visiting 
I would love 2 visit again.

This place could have been rated 5 stars easily .. The ambiance, decor, food everything were up to the mark .. So as the live band on couple of Wednesdays.. That I visited there .. But the reason I kept it 3.5 star, is the brewed beer and the price (to some extent) .. Only the blond beer( I guess the name was Scottish ale) was okay kind (just okay) .. Rest are not at all up to the mark .. Also the beer mugs were horrible looking ( it looks like some kind of glass jar) .. I would not visit there for the brewed beer definitely (it is overpriced too.. House brewed beer should be more reasonably priced).. Otherwise food tastes good.. All in all everything good other than the brewed beer and the price tag of the food n drinks (everything felt a bit overpriced) ..

Need to work out a lot. Although there are limited options for microbreweries in Kolkata, but it's always good to have one near your place. They have just four fresh beer flavors (Irish, German, Belgium and Scottish) and all of them are light. Irish will leave a post sip residue on your tongue. The food really impressed me. Chicken wings guess good with the beer and chicken steak is a must try. Coming to the ambience, I though Kolkata has to grow over Brew pub culture so my expectations were not that high when I entered. Although the place was a little bit let down, first of all they took a lot of time to respond and took 20 min to bring the beer tester ( that are irritating). They at the end there was some billing issues and we faced rude behavior from the staff and because I am new to Kolkata I am getting a bad image of how bongs treat their customers. But at the end the manager handled well. I guess if you don't have enough options to go for then visit this place, but you can give it a try for the food and definitively for fresh beer.

Cheers!

Went for lunch. Had Russian Burger which is a Recommended Dish for this place on Zomato (this weirdly was not present on the menu, so we had to put a special order for it). Also had Penne Pasta in White sauce and wok fried rice Mie Goreng. Such good burger and pasta is very rare. It was my first Mie Goreng and I am happy that I tried it at Country Roads. German Weizen beer, red wine, white wine and Sangria were also ordered. This place is a microbrewery and people come here searching for good beer and drinks. From my experience I have learnt that the food here tops it's drinks anyday. I've noticed that some people have complained about the poor service. There wan't much rush that day, maybe that's the reason why service was good. Lastly, coming to the ambience - it was good enough. Overall, Country Roads made our day.

Visited this place on a Thursday night when d mood was already low as weekend was too far to reach. Bt after entering there , my mood certainly became lighter.may be it's d dimly lit  wooden resto-bar which resembles d good old  cowboy culture or d lip smacking snacks and gulp down in one go cocktails that they offer or may be both. I ordered yakitori (chicken screwers ,as they appeared to me) and a LITT....D chicken was nicely done with d juice glistening inside d coating (kudos to d chef) ..It was something that I can eat ,eat and eat without  complain. And abt d drink ,well it was smooth and d proportion of cola and 5 spirits were  so on point that it gave me a nice kick without giving me a hang over d next day.
Pocket pinch : a bit on heavier side.
Strongly recommend if u r in rajarhat and in d mood of pubbing.

This is a pub located in The Galleria, 2 ND floor in Rajarhat. If you are willing to taste varieties of beer then, this is the right place for you. Keeping this expectations in mind, I just went there today. After seeing the decorations and interiors, it seems like I am in country side restros. As I had came here to enjoy variety of beers. So I ordered Belgium, German and Scottish beer with chicken tandoor and chicken sizzler. Food was excellent but service quality is very poor. Overall good experience...

We have been there 3-4 times now and it's been a decent experience every time. The place is usually packed, even though it may be situated in galleria which does not seem to be much of a happening place. 
The service here is quick and they have a micro brewery so you can try some of their own beers. I've tried different starters and most recently tried their murg nafis and caesar salad. Food quality is good and portion size is good too. 
They usually telecast live sports so the ambience is quite lively. 
I tried the chocolate martini recently, it's amazing and I would recommend all chocolate lovers to give it a try!!

One of the most awaited openings of the past year, as Newtown got its very own Microbrewery. Located in a rather deserted mall named DLF Galleria, this place is by no chance a loner. Starting from the brewery, craft beer as they call it, German, Scottish and Belgian tastes are offered. None of them was a stand out, but yes, German was the one I liked, but obviously that doesn't imply anything. Taste choices differ. They do introduce some other brews from time to time but German was still the best to me. Coming to food, the labels on the menu are rather fancy and I would suggest knowing about dishes before you summon them. Food all in all was okay, so no surprises there to. The service and music are good, but the place needs to work on its punch that it still lacks. But still a good place to hangout for those 11th hour plans.

P.S. Do not forget to ring the bell when you come out after a fun night.

It's a good joint! 

They play good music, looks like an all western diner.... has good beer and reasonably good food. 

We tasted all their beer (there were 4 available, Rice Beer unfortunately wasn't available).. live their small half pint glasses. German Weizen, Belgian Blonde, Scottish Ale and Irish Red Ale. Loved the Scottish Ale, followed by Belgian Blond. Irish Red was a bit strong but not bad and the German was a fun beer (a little flat and very light) 
Food wise... we ordered nachos, pan fried fish and mozzarella cheese sticks. Pan fried fish was excellent and mozzarella cheese sticks were good. Nachos were a disappointment. We ordered the Vegetarian ones, thinking they will be served with black beans, but it was served with a rather salty salsa (which tasted more like a gravy) topped with cheese. I forgot to take photos of cheese sticks.

The staff is friendly and very cooperative. Thank you Aastha :) 

We are definitely going back for the beer!!

First time, I decided to visit a brewery in Kolkata. Wanted to have some draught beer. On zomato, I found out that Country Roads is the most famous brewery here. After entering, I was amazed by the ambience. But after having the beer, my experience turned out to be a terrible one. Draught beer is like water here. Even the food wasn't upto the mark. Maybe next time, will get some other brewery here.

Take Me Home, Country Roads                                            – John Denver. Country Roads , fantastic microbrewery, relatively new, people working there are always with a smile and keen to help you out. A huge place that serves North Indian, Chinese, Continental  (focused mainly on bar food) and German, Belgian and Scottish beer that they brew on premise.The atmosphere is really cosy, there is a nice selection of beers and the plates we tasted were extremely good. The food is very good, comes in big dishes and nice presented on the plates. Popular with young crowds, the atmosphere is friendly and welcoming.This is a place of beer, friends and a good ol’ blues and rock in the background (not loud, just the exact volume to have a good conversation).

The ales are good. The Scottish ale is the best among all of them. Very authentic. We tried calamari fry, chicken wings and they were both good. The staff was very helpful and friendly. We also liked the seating of the place. A good place to hangout.

It's a good joint! 

They play good music, looks like an all western diner.... has good beer and reasonably good food. 

We tasted all their beer (there were 4 available, Rice Beer unfortunately wasn't available).. live their small half pint glasses. German Weizen, Belgian Blonde, Scottish Ale and Irish Red Ale. Loved the Scottish Ale, followed by Belgian Blond. Irish Red was a bit strong but not bad and the German was a fun beer (a little flat and very light) 
Food wise... we ordered nachos, pan fried fish and mozzarella cheese sticks. Pan fried fish was excellent and mozzarella cheese sticks were good. Nachos were a disappointment. We ordered the Vegetarian ones, thinking they will be served with black beans, but it was served with a rather salty salsa (which tasted more like a gravy) topped with cheese. I forgot to take photos of cheese sticks.

The staff is friendly and very cooperative. Thank you Aastha :) 

We are definitely going back for the beer!!

First time, I decided to visit a brewery in Kolkata. Wanted to have some draught beer. On zomato, I found out that Country Roads is the most famous brewery here. After entering, I was amazed by the ambience. But after having the beer, my experience turned out to be a terrible one. Draught beer is like water here. Even the food wasn't upto the mark. Maybe next time, will get some other brewery here.

Take Me Home, Country Roads                                            – John Denver. Country Roads , fantastic microbrewery, relatively new, people working there are always with a smile and keen to help you out. A huge place that serves North Indian, Chinese, Continental  (focused mainly on bar food) and German, Belgian and Scottish beer that they brew on premise.The atmosphere is really cosy, there is a nice selection of beers and the plates we tasted were extremely good. The food is very good, comes in big dishes and nice presented on the plates. Popular with young crowds, the atmosphere is friendly and welcoming.This is a place of beer, friends and a good ol’ blues and rock in the background (not loud, just the exact volume to have a good conversation).
                                                                ...

This micro brewery was on my list for many days and yesterday I got the chance to visit here. The seating area is huge with well decorated inside. U could actually see the brewery while seating. The staffs were well behaved. There is a separate room for smoking too. We ordered the special Belgian, Scottish and Irish draught beer. The beers were absolutely incredible. The essence was fantastic. We also ordered starter as chicken wings in bbq sauce and it was too good. The sauce was adding incredible flavours to the chicken wings. We also ordered grilled chicken with garlic bread and herb rice with dip. This dish was also not a let down. The grilled chicken was too good and the bread with rice was complementing it very well. This is a must visit place and will visit again. Keep up the good work.

If you like own making brewery for beers, then only  try them. Either Seafood or continental ,both were delicious. I visited with my brother and love one. Place  was best to enjoy the evening. Try them please.

Heard of microbrewery? It's something that produces small amounts of beer. They are smaller than larger producers and are independently owned.

These are generally characterized by their emphasis on the brewing techniques, quality and flavour.

It was 1970s at United Kingdom when the concept of Microbrewing was coined for the first time.

Although the traditional brewing method existed throughout the Europe and the new method gradually spread to other  countries. 

The movement subsequently grew and some breweries expanded their production and distribution and a newer and effective concept of craft brewing emerged.

Country Roads, an restaurant cum bar, is the only place in Kolkata to practice this concept, and that too excellently. Country Roads, located in Galleria Mall, serves different types of beers and delicious starters and main. 

Recently I went over to attend their tasting session with my  fellow foodies of Panchphoron.

So we start off with it!

Oriental Noodles- It's a vegetarian  preparation made with udon, a thick wheat flour noodle type. 

Spiced up with a variety of ingredients, later drained and cooked with chopped veggies, that's all it had. Light yet tasty.

Lawrence Chicken- Chicken Leg and breast pieces marinated with yogurt and spices. Grilled with perfection over an clay oven. 
  The servings that were with it included chopped salad, pickled onion and a coriander dip. Chicken was soft and juicy. A pure delicacy that all must try. 

SS Chicken Mustard- Marinated Chicken grilled on honey and mustard sauce. 
Perfectly garnished with fried onion, colored cabbage leaves and a croquette of veggies.  The chicken was soft, juicy and tasty. 

Haryali Paneer Tikka- Dice shaped paneer marinated, and attached with bell peppers and onions on a skewer.  Well grilled and a spicy layer on top, this dish is served along with pickled onions and coriander dip. Soft Paneer and the tangy side-kicks makes it a wonderful combo. 

Nasi Goreng- A famous Indonesian delicacy, comes with preferences on prawn, fish or chicken. 

It was served along with Wok Fried Rice and accompanied by Chili Mushroom and poached egg portion.  The taste was unique and satisfying. 

Yakitori- A Japanese skewered chicken cuisine. Chicken pieces marinated with spices and coated with a sauce known as the Teriyaki. 
Next the chicken is put on skewer and grilled. The chicken had a spicy essence but tasted tangy and sweet. 

Laziz Tangri- Chicken pieces marinated with some secret spices and grilled to perfection. Served along with pickled onions, chopped salad and coriander sauce.
The dish was delicious and the chicken was soft and juicy. 

California Fried Chicken- Chicken breast marinated with a whole lot of spices, herbs and corn flakes.

 A coating of flour followed by and then was deep fried. The exterior layer was crunchy though the interior portion of the chicken was soft and juicy. 
 It was served along with fried onion rings and a sweet dip. 

Golden Fried Prawn- Medium sized prawn pieces battered and deep fried.   Served along with hot garlic sauce, this dish is a must try for prawn lovers. 

Wok Fried Fish- Small fish pieces marinated and fried. Later tossed up with bell peppers and a bunch of sauces. Soft and tangy, a must try for everyone. 

Next we hit the Country Special Non-Veg Platter- Basically a combo of four starters, first comes the Lawrence Chicken with a quite decent taste, 
 next up is the Dora Kebab made from minced meat, also good in taste, thirdly it's the well known delicacy,  the Chicken Wing and finally its the crunchy and deep fried Calamari. 

Overall this place is a great place for hang out with your friends over a cup of beer. List of these above dishes are newly launched and hopefully it will served from next week.

Overall I had a great experience,the foods they served and prepared for the food tasting session it was amazing. 

I would like to thank to the owner of this place who accompanied us as well as the stuffs are very helpful. 

Their service is very quick,thanks to the Chefs and helping stuffs. I would like to thanks to the Rajdeep Bhattacharya, Panchforon and the owner for inviting us.

Wish all the very very best entire team of Country Roads.

A long long await came to an end last Sunday.Had planed to visit this microbrewery when it just came to town,but for few ups & downs we couldn't.so coming to the place it's a bit odd.As the Galleria in Newtown Rajarhat is really odd only few stores are active.We were greeted warmly at the gate.Got two seats just near the bar counter.The ambience is just like a american diner.We can view the Brewery near the end.so for ambience 4 out of 5, coming to foods we wanted to have their in-house bears but it was out of stock which was really unbelievable.so they gave us a rice bear & Irish ale.They had a menu for chicken wings 12pcs but couldn't serve it as they had some changes in time of serving that.which was another letdown.next we wander their Russian xxx burger.tgey do serve calamari but dats not on the menu which should be updated ASAP.wings were bit too spicy,burger was upto the mark.the only thing I loved was the calamari but they were supposed to give mayo as dip but they served a hot sauce.so 3.5 out of 5.service was yet a let down.they hardly noticed that we were done with the plates the table was fully crowded,had to ask them to clean it.3 out of 5. Just a reminder to all corporate card holders please carry your card as they provide 10%discount on foods.finally a another visit might be left for this sack.

From their sparkling minds they serve beer from their microbrewery. The beer is cloudy, less lager, fresh and refreshing. If u tasted bira 91 or bud light - more or less similar to it. They serve it over ~pickle glasses which also adds on their improvising setup. On the food, palate may dangle between receptive taate. Chicken wings was key for the beer at least for me.

Decent place in a commercial building. Don't quite like the ambience but service is decent. 
Not very costly but food is a bit oily for my taste. Their microbrewery has nice German beer but the Belgian was disappointing.It's not really a place I would visit unless I was in the building.

The chicken item we ordered was good but quantity was very less considering the price.

More known as a brewery this place is not worth a visit. Never order nachos here as they serve anything but Nachos. On complaining the waiter was apologetic but a staff approached us with his excuse of those being home made nachos. If I want home made nachos then why would I pay a restaurant? 
Overall the food quantity was poor. Their own brewed beer isn't a reason enough to visit the place. I'm not going back ever.

This place is located in the 2nd floor Galleria building opposite to novotel. Microbrewery in kolkata. This place had this kind of environment where you can actually hang around with a group of close friends.

We visited in the evenning. We ordered mixed noodles and prawn in hot garlic sauce. The food tasted awsome . The tag brewery s a bit too much. Though the loud music and the great ambiance was something amazing.
In total the place is great and pocket friendly.

Although I never write reviews but this is the SHITTIEST place one can ever visit. Only for this review I had to create my account on zomato .. 

1. Situated in the ghostly mall that too on the second floor . With every approaching steps the negative vibes keeps growing stronger and stronger. The Satan will himself welcome you to his hell, don't fall for the smile of the lady devil you meet next.

2.The place is full of mosquitoes , even after complaining there excuse was that allout is not working.So you are not paying only your money but also your blood. The probability of dying with malaria is higher than getting good quality food or booze.

3.Creepy background music that too on repeat mode will never let you get high . Forget about chilled you will be served luke warm beer as if it is a soup. The waiters will be gathered in one corner discussing how you brought disturbance to their force. ask them for water and they will stare you as if you asked them for their kidney.

4. Coming to food , the Crispy chilly babycorn was the only GOOD thing. Nachos and chicken wings are not that good.

The review doesn't ends here, we were 5 people who visited this place out which 4 are suffering from stomach ailments and the only one who is still healthy is the one who did not ate or drank anything.

We finally found a place in New town where you dont have to shell big bucks and yet have the enjoyment to that of a decent pub with great music, beautiful ambience and the feeling of a happy place. The service was great. 
for drinks, two of us ordered the belgian blond and german weizen each 500 ml and while i loved the belgian blond's taste and how smooth it was, german weizen was as a german drink should be, strong and hard. 
My sister ordered a mango flavored martini which was delicious to the tounge in every sip.
For food we ordered Mur Nafeez, which was delicious and so well cooked. The pieces are not those regular chewy pieces you get in restaurants, rather it was good portion of meat.
The veg item we ordered was friend and made of corn and corn flakes with a delicious tomato dip. This is one of the most delicious corn dishes i have had. They didnt have a couple of items from their menu which was quite disappointing but we were happy with whatever they had and we ordered.

This place is located on the 2nd floor of DLF Mall in New town , opposite Axis Mall and Novotel. The service here is very warm as the staff greeted us even before we entered the pub. The interiors are lit with hanging lamps and the decor is perfect for lounging with Friends . The brewery tag however is a bit of a hype as they hardly have more than 3 of their in house brews on offer . We were offered a sample of three types of beer , namely , Irish , Scottish ale and basmati rice. The irish beer was very pale to taste , lacking the punch of a typical beer . The basmati rice tasted very bland. So my friend and I decided to go for the Scottish ale , which had a slightly sweet undertone . The beer was accompanied by their in house chicken wings in honey and chilli sauce , which tasted  crispy and sweet . The food was served hot but the beer was not chilled . The bill was served in a glass with sugared fennel seeds and payments could be made by cards.  The music was tad loud but the overall ambience is good for a chilled out time with Friends .

After some tiring shopping at a nearby mall, we needed a chilled brew and upon zomatoing, we zeroed in on this microbrewery nearby. We were excited, holy cow!
As we drew closer, the energy kept sapping slowly.
First, the mall is ghostly and eerie. Very off-putting. Then as you draw closer to the outlet, you notice the interior and the crowd (measly) and you draw a big question mark.
We ordered the German wheat craft beer, one large (500ml) and one small (250ml). What we got was a what-could've-been-perfect-but-missed-the-mark-by -many-miles beer.
To begin with, it wasn't chilled. I mean who does that? You have one thing to get right and you totally ignore that... Why!
Then with a bitter taste in your mouth (literally), you start noticing that the place is near close to shutting down. I mean on a Sunday eve, staff members outnumbered the customers. The sofas are cheap and there is no ambiance. Would give this a miss, any and everytime I pass this place by.

This place is bang opposite of Axis mall. I took a coupon from nearbuy which included beer, Crispy chilly baby corn & a burger. Well the amidence was good... Staff was generous & the food was very good. Now let's come down to main thing as the place is a microbrewery. They have 3 type of beer so if you are a beer lover you should visit for sure. The only problem with this place is that it situated in a building which is almost empty.

 speak. the only cooling for the beer kegs is something close to a wet towel.ANY beer connoisseur  would like to have a chilled beer and cool beer will just not do,especially in a speciality beer pub, it shows that they are not committed  to serving good beer. VERY DISAPPOINTED.SO IF YOU LIKE A GOOD BEER, DONT COME HERE,

One of the few microbreweries in Kolkata, this place could have been awesome but alas it just turned out to be mediocre!
The pub is situated in an awkward place which is quite desolate making it difficult for the people to find out. The food is just ok. The kebabs, chicken yakitori and pan fries fish tasted good.
Coming to the main attraction, the craft beer is pretty good to taste. We have tasted belgian blonde, german and irish beer. But they dont keep bottled beer which is a bummer. Those who dont have taste in craft beer will be disappointed.
Overall a ok place and a missed opportunity!

Near my home so I ventured into the microbrewery near to home in a newly opened mall Galleria. This pub is located in the second floor & parking was free.
Had ordered a white wine sangria, Scottish ale & Chicken wings. The sangria was okay with the overwhelming tangy punch, the wings were chewy & had previous day smell in it & besides the ale being at room temperatures even the tasters were so.
Ambience & service was 4.5/5.
Overall a peaceful place to enjoy with your folks and a better place place if the brewed beer was cold.

A very good place with a nice ambience. Talking about the ambience the decor is also very good for the place.
Now coming to the food the quality is good but not something out of the book. Like they charge a very high price but compare to that the food is not that good. If the price would have been a bit less then the pricing would have been justified.
Then again the chicken stuffed breast the mac n cheese was really good. Also they make very good cocktails that is the dirty martini was very good. Last was the beer like they manufacture beer themselves and hence the quality is very good for the same particularly in this case the price is less when compared to other cafes of the same range.
About the part I didn't like was the product idea of the person serving. In other words he was not atall able to help us in deciding our food.
In short a nice place to visit often provided you have full knowledge of the food that u order.

Ambiance is really good for couples or lesser group of people. As this is a pub the sound is of louder side so talking and listening is a hard thing to do unless you are sitting too closely. The overall light is also a bit of brighter side. The foods are really good. Ordered laziz tangri, yakitori these are really good. The price is lil expensive but its okay with the place.

It was not without apprehension that we picked this place for our Christmas dinner. Some feedbacks I had received were not very green. Yet we 2 pair of couples all senior citizens booked a table and landed there around 7pm. The very first impression I got was this is not our place. It is for the youngsters. However we put our best brave attitude forward and were shown a corner seat. The brewery actually drew us there and we settled down. The music was bang bang and just above our bearable limits. 
The best part was yet to come. The young boy who was attending us not only steered us to the choice of beer but also was very sweet to have us taste the variety first. A special mention for this gesture. 
🍺is their speciality so no comments on that. The Bloody Mary was superb. Food here is very good. Nothing to complain. Only the ice cream part was disappointing. Otherwise this a thumbs up place.@

Neatly done sitting areas...decent music even in a weekday was a merry experience!
The russian chicken burger with saucy sides was pretty lipsmackin!!
The beer was good as per my friend and the orange mocktail was nice and tasty!
Only request would be to please add some french fries to the menu and thank you for the Scottish feel that surrounds you once you walk in!!

Will be back for more!!

It was rugged yet classy. The staffs are really sweet and patient  especially the bartenders who tendered to all our requests while we sat there waiting for a table. The music was good not too loud so one can actually talk and not sit mute.

Now coming to food and drinks: we had their housemade beers and i think their scottish ale was milder tastewise while the other two were bit on the bitter side. I am no big fan of beer so dint really enjoy them but their signature cocktail jimmies jar was yum and STRONG!! Almost blew my mind  off but good no complaints. 

From the food menu we had their barrah baluchi, chefs special non veg platter and their chicken wings. They were all super delicious especially the barrah baluchi(lamb chops) . It was soft , juicy ,the meat just fell iff the bone and was so well marinated that i am salivating right now thinking of them. The chicken wings were equally delish and moist. Wasnt chewy at all. The non veg platter too was having good variety and were very well done except for their oriental nuggets which were hard and not upto mark with the other items.

As mains honestly i wanted their Russian burger but they were sold out so we had hara masala ki tengri and butter nan and both were yum. I am not a big fan of palak chicken but this was really mouth watering. 

The dessert was a complete nono i.e their ice cream nachos. It was worthless. I would rather have nachos and cheese.Price wise i have to mention pretty reasonable keeping in mind the area and set up. 

A fun new swanky place to hangout without being on a budget.

This place lacks the quirky ambience and is a little dim, although the entrance is done nicely.
Coming to food we ordered mozzarella sticks, veg quesidilla and belgian beer.

Mozzarella sticks were nice and the quantity of cheese was perfect and was served along with tangy spicy garlic dip.

Veg quesidilla was a bit average.. it was like paratha stuffed with kidney beans n cheese.. nothing spectacular about it!

Belgian beer was crafter by their own brewery and was suggested by them. It was mild with good flavours.

Overall an average experience. But one major disappointment was that they had just one salad preparation which was being served along with every dish, nothing innovative as dish perspective! Udit Kapoor

Microbrewery of the town. A place for a perfect runaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. A place where people gather to hangout and have a conversation over a beer. This place is not for hardcore party lovers. An ambiance apt for enjoying the ordered food and drink.

The management is very helpful and the service provided by them was also very comforting. There was someone or the other who was continuously attending the tables. So overall the service they gave was very much markable.

One of finest drinks out there is the DIRTY MARTINI. Someone will just love the cocktail. Moreover you should order a long island ice tea. That also adds to the flavour. And to order a side dish one must go for the noorjhani chicken. Its quite delicious. And from the microbrewey one can go for the German beer or the Belgium one. 

All in all, this place can raise the bar of you having a drink and a good conversation. I found this place very interesting and would love to visit again cause I want to leave a message again on the board.

The ambience was nice, though a little more peppy music would do it good. The place needs a helping of life. Despite everything being present, something very vital was missing, giving you the impression that it is incomplete. The service was friendly. The food was decent. The beers they brew aren't exceptional.

We tried house special chicken wings in honey chilli sauce( they have 12 pieces in a dish) along with mozzarella sticks ( 5 sticks). The mozzarella sticks are actually the best I have had and the little sauce they give with it is quite tasty too. The chicken wings were nice. A little more meat on them would have been nicer. The honey chilli sauce was sweet and slightly spicy. Will definitely visit for trying other good items.

This place has the most cheapest in house brewed beers in Kolkata, they have 3 flavours the Scottish ale, Irish and the Belgium... This is a nice place with comfortable interiors, decent food ... I liked their chicken wings. Situated opp. To axis mall and beside home town in Newtown. Nice place to enjoy brewed beers.

Located at the deserted DLF mall , the Country Roads is probably the only microbrewary and pub in and around the newtown area and surprisingly not crowded on a Sunday evening too. The ambience and service is decent but unavailability of too many items from the menu was an issue that needs to be looked into. The entire tandoor section was closed , some of the popular liquor options were not in stock. We settled for one 500ml of BELGIAN BLOND , one 250 ml of SCOTOSH ALE and i liked the taste of both , one honey and the other had hint of caramel flavour in it. We had SPICY CHICKEN WINGS in tangy garlic sauce which was good enough along with our next pegs of Bacardi . Tried one cocktail The JAMAICAN HORSE which looked awesome but since i dont prefer dark rum i didnot like it , my friend seemed to enjoy it. For maincourse PESTO GRILLED FISH was our choice which was upto the mark , nothing to drool through.

A friend of mine suggested me their signature ROSOGOLLA SHOT and JIMMIES JAR . Attaching those pics as well. I wish i got these suggestions before our visit , hence it calls for a second visit!

During my last visit to Kolkata, i was excited about visiting Country Roads, the microbrewery which happens to be just across the road from my home. But disappointed to say, it fell way short of expectations. Very limited brewed beer options, and of them only 2 are available at any given time. No dark beer is available. And sad thing is they dont even serve in beer glass/mugs but in those juice jars. Any true beer lover will find it offensive. We ordered for both the available beer varieties in 500ml each, the German blonde and the Irish beer. The German beer had a smooth taste but no hit, after a while i really did not know if it was beer. The Irish one, though had a sting in it in first sip, tasted better in after taste and was drinkable. However the biggest concern was the temperature. Forget ice cold, they were passable chilled. On complaining, the staff said nonchalantly that this is how brewed beer is coz it comes through a tap!! Biggest facepalm moment ever. We didnt ask for any more beer, in a brewery. We had a wine and some chicken wings. Wine took repeated reminders to get served and wings by that time even if they were ok, I had lost appetite. Dont think i'll waste a visit there again unless i dont get to hear the place has improved in quality.

The new Pub in town. Located in a mall not frequented by a lot of people still, the pub is pretty popular. The microbrewery concept is catching up with Kolkata and people seem to be visiting them. The restaurant serves their two brewed beers, Scottish Ale and German. I liked the taste of Scottish Ale and having had it in Scotland itself, the taste was pretty close to ale. The ambience is decent too. However they need to work on the food. Food was average. Not a lot of things to order from and taste was average. Will go back for the ale and the youthfulness of the place

Visited this place on last Friday for Lunch (Thanks to Thanksgiving Day). Situated inside an almost empty mall opposite to Axis Mall, the restaurant, mostly termed as Microbrewery was also almost empty when we visited. Fortunately we visited for the food and not the liquor since most of them remain unavailable in spite of having their presence in the menu (As is quite clear from the other reviews as well). Ambiance is quite good with large space and comfortable seating arrangements. The brewery is just on the side visible from outside the glass. The huge instruments and containers some how reminded me of Breaking Bad ;-) Coming to the food, we tried the Chinese cuisine, starting off with House Special Wings and Wok Fried Fish will bell pepper. Both tasted wonderful, though we liked the fish more due to its tangy taste and succulent nature and I have had better wings elsewhere. From the main course we had Mixed Noodles along with side dishes: Thi Chin Chicken and Fukien fish in ginger sauce. Strangely for Mixed Noodles they offer either Chicken or shrimp. The Noodles was prepared nicely though with a reasonable quantity though wouldn't say massive. We absolutely loved the Thi Chin Chicken which was spicy and tasty, but for the Fish it was exactly the opposite scenario. There was no taste whatsoever and none of us liked it. Overall it was a good experience from the food perspective and would probably visit it again sometime soon.

The management is horrible kind of,dont care about the feedback or else, we had some sides with beer, they counted nachos can u believe it? The quantity of any dish will give u shock, the prices of other drinks are high too. The only thing is decor which is good. Not recommended

This place was a disappointment. The place is touted as a brewery having its own speciality beers. Those were nothing to write home about. To top that they don't have the big bottles of the Budweisers and Carlsbergs either.
We ordered a charcoal grilled chicken but it was so sooo undercooked, no smoky flavour at all, kinda bleh. We wanted to get something light to go with our drinks after the chicken disasters, but there wasn't anything on the menu. On asking for French fries, we were told they couldn't accommodate it. Feeling hopeless after this, we cancelled our dinner plans at this place. Wouldn't recommend or revisit. Visit at your own peril..

Heard a lot about this new microbrewery in town. Got mixed reviews about this place. But finally i was able to go to this place on a Saturday evening. It is located in a deserted galleria mall. A little difficult to find.
Some beer festival was going on at that time so they were providing some combos. We ordered one of them. Ordered 1 ltr scottish ale nd honey lamb. Beer was good. But the lamb was disaster mostly having lettuce and a little lamb (that also was leather type) dipped in honey. We had to waste half of the dish. As we couldn't fulfill our desire we ordered some regular drinks along with spicy chickens, those were normal.
Coming to the ambience it was just like a pub where u can hang out with friends n grab a beer. It was almost full.it has a smoking zone.  Some live bands were playing at that time.
Their waiters are not very professional and have no idea of the food items. We were provided a menu card which didn't have most of the pages in it. Pocket pinch was a little on the higher side.
So really it was a mixed experience. But the management should look into their food items if they want to continue with this new initiative.

My wife and I visited this place for the first time today for lunch and liked it very much. 

We live in New Town and though Country Roads is just 2 km from our home we did not know about it till a friend told us about it recently. It was a wonderful discovery. 

My primary aim was to try beer from their microbrewery. I wanted Scottish Ale but out of 3 varieties of 'crafted beer' on their menu only German Weizen was available and I had to settle for that. But it did not disappoint me - I found it quite good and took a second helping. My wife liked her mocktail. 

We had tandoori chicken with drinks which was cooked excellently. For the main course we ordered boneless chicken (Murgh Makhan Shahi) and rice. We found the chicken preparation deliciously different from the usual butter chicken in Punjabi restaurants. 

All in all, it was an excellent experience. Our bill came to Rs 1500.

An average outlet in terms of food & beverage and over all experience. Efforts are visible towards the designing of the interiors. Only selected beer was available. My colleague tried Ale and I had my regular drink Vodka. The beverage prices are okay. Tried their Chinese food, which was good. The outlet is difficult to locate as it is situated in a isolated wing of a office building in Rajarhat. The outlet has poor maintenance. Menu cards are almost torn, the seats are uncomfortable. Staff is helpful and pleasant.

Went there on a Wednesday evening. The place had a live band and about 5-6 guests. The server offered us a table behind a huge pillar, so we requested to be seated on an adjacent one so that we can see the band playing. The server refused to give us that table as it was meant for 6 people in an empty bar! What was a bigger surprise is that 3-4 other servers came and they all had the opinion that it's better to lose customers than offer them a comfortable seat! And the Bar was empty!!!!! Beat that....Never stepping foot in this disgusting place again.....It's out in the middle of nowhere and has below average food, and to top it all pathetic service! I think they want to close the place down.

I am told that this is one of the first microbreweries in Kolkata. So i visited this place during my Kolkata trip and i would have to say it's a pretty charming place and gives off an english/scottish vibe. We ordered beers and food which were quite good. Service could have been prompt though. But would definitely go back when I'm in Kolkata again.

On weekend nights the place gets little crowded but other time it has  a light atmosphere. I loved the chicken wings and  the Insalata Di Caesar chicken Salad . The German weiner is a bit strong. I liked the XXX sauce Russian burger first time I visited but it was not available during my last visit.

Leme start with a captivating story.. Am sure it will grab many eyeballs coz its the story of beer and why men love it!;) So, Beer is one of the oldest beverages humans have produced, dates backs to the fifth millennium BC. So when the cereal agriculture was in excess and the people then would use it to concoct the malted grain steeped and heated slowly in the water, and then baked and again submerged.. Thats how Beer was brewed.. Men brewed it coz if consumed it would be nutricious to their hearts and so they transformed the water into palatable beer! So lets start the gupshup on this place Country Roads which is a microbrewery.. fresh beer is crafted here.. Situated in Rajarhat, Newtown right next to Hotel Pride Plaza.. Looks deserted once you enter the building in which this lounge is! Place looks good with dim lights and huge machines which brews the types of flavours.. the seating area however is not happening particularly for large crowds. The place isnt tidied up as well..
The Food consisted of larger portions of beer and starters to go with it.. We ordered:
German weizen: Twas mild drink as per my group buddies.. so almost everyone went for this one!
Crispy Chilli Babycorn: Twas soggy and not that saucy.. could have been better
Quesdillas: Had the corn filling and was hopeless.. just had a bite and couldnt have another bite!
Tandoori Aloo: was okayish.. amongst all the starters this dish was still bearable.
Masala Papad: Was okay.. but when we ordered a papad without other veggies and just onions.. the staff said its nt possible to remember your order and so he dint get it..
Highly unprofessional..
Mozarella Poppers: The first portion was good.. nice and gooey.. and then we placed another order and it smelled of fish somehow.. so we couldnt devour it later.. Honestly, this place is just good for brewery and horrendous when it comes to food..
The Staff and Pocket Pinch: The service is not upto the mark.. needs to tighten its belt.. Its fairly priced but has to improve on the quality.. whats your story for this place? Do post your thoughts.. Thanks!!

I write this as I am on my way to office on a Monday morning.. reminiscing of a fun Friday. Monday blues? Yesss. Coping mechanism?? You bet.
So I have visited this Brewery/pub/restro some 4 times, since it had opened its doors some time early this year. Most recent one being last Friday. It's located at a Stone's throw from my place of work and our gang is a regular.
The most important draw is without a doubt, the beer. There's three varieties available all year 'round. Belgian blonde, it's a light beer, with a frooty taste, my personal favorite. A second close is the German weizen, it tastes malty and is stronger. They have Scottish ale, which is the strongest. I found another addition to this list last Friday, dunkel weizen, which was part of their special menu for the month long celebration of Oktoberfest, not sure if it's gonna be a permanent addition to their menu. It's a dark German brew and certainly an acquired taste.
On previous occasions I had their cocktails the dirty Martini to be specific, which was good and packed punch. We did the rosogolla shots as well. It's a brandy based shot with a brandy infused rosogolla, not for the faint hearted I must add.
The food is average, good enough to accompany your drinks. We mostly have the starters, the favorite is Mahi irani. Other than that chicken wings, Calcutta bhetki fry, the house special nachos were decent. Never tried the mains, so would not comment.
The most important part is the ambience. We had live music played last Friday. The crowd's good, mostly IT crowd like us.
It somehow has become a go to place to hang out for our gang and hopefully will remain so.

Brewery that leaves a tingling taste afterwards.

We were there for a short while and had ordered Dunkel Weizen home brewed beer, crispy chilly baby corn and mozzarella jalapeño poppers. For the main course, it was fried rice. All were good except the jalapeño poppers. They were not cooked properly and there was no cheese flavour in it. 
The beer also left a tingling taste afterwards. Fried rice was cooked properly and portions was sufficient enough for the two of us.

The ambience was also alive in the almost new DLF Galleria complex of Rajarhat. Nice place to be.

This place is at the second floor of the galleria mall opposite to axis mall. We went there for lunch this Friday. The place was quite empty - infact we were the first customers followed by only two more groups. They have launched a puja special menu in addition to the regular menu. We tried fried calamari, coconut and basil smoked mussels, char grilled chicken in lemon sauce and grilled fish in cilantro pesto sauce. The presentation of all the dishes were superb! Calamari was soft and crispy - perfectly accompanied with a hot garlic sauce. The char grilled chicken was succulent and tasted nice in a sweet tangy sauce. The fish was bit little over grilled but overall tasted nice. Mussels were a bit rubbery and it took a long time to get served (over 30 mins). For mocktails we went for orange mojito and kiwi flavored fresh lime soda and both of these were well made. The only complain we have is about their service - they are polite and all but very slow and have absolutely no clue about their menu. They must train themselves to help and guide the customers better.

Worst place i have ever com across. The only good thing is the ambience. But just to remind a pub doesn't run only on good ambience. The primary drawbacks are:
1) U need to beg for water( we were 5, on asking for water, they served only 2 glasses)
2) there is very less salt in the food( main course: chicken stroganoff and chicken steak). The problem isn't that there was less salt in the food but the issue was there was no table salt or pepper.
3) lastly the washrooms sucked. It seemed as if people puked several times and it wasn't cleaned. 
Though the beer was good. Starters: chicken basil reshmi kebab and charcoal grilled chicken was okayish. House special wings was sweet as hell. 
The service was damn slow and the staff was lethargic. I wish it had been a better place. Please work on the drawbacks.

Country Roads is a nicely decorated restaurant having a micro brewery. Well, locating the place is difficult and is a nightmare if you plan on getting home in a cab. However, on a positive note, house brewed beers are good although the Scottish one didn't taste like a scottish beer, coming from someone who have lived in Scotland for almost 3 years. Moreover, I hated the fact that they served beers in a glass jar which is awful. We have glasses for beers, people around the the world cherish having there favorite beers in there favorite glasses. Coming to another positive thing i must say that the music, crowd and the ambience is pretty good but could be done better by changing genres of party music. Waiting staff is prompt and responsive and on request they served our beers in a glass, however on refill they just took the glasses from our table and filled it in the same glass which was weird.

Country Roads is good but could do better.

This new microbrewery is a Gem. Not only does it serve great beer, the food is lip-smacking. 
Went in for a late lunch. Ordered the Noorjahani Tikka and Wok Tossed Fried Fish With Bell Peppers for starters. Both the dishes were so tasty!! The fish was really soft and tangy and spicy to the right extent. The tikka was done to its perfection! The chicken pieces melted in the mouth as if it were fish. One of the best starters.
Then we had Mixed Hakka Noodles and Thi Chin Chicken. The noodles were great. I don't generally like hakka, but loved this one!! The chicken dish was average though. The sauce could have been better, I felt. 
For drinks, ordered a cocktail called the Primer. A creamy concoction of white rum, chocolate syrup and hazelnut. It was like a cherry on top. They did not have a good dessert menu. So if you are up for something sweet and sinful, Primer is just your drink! 
Loved the experience!!!

The place is easily accessible, right next to the Pride hotel opposite Axis Mall.
The three varieties of brewed beer German , Belgium, Scottish (arranged in increasing order of strength ) are very good. You can ask for tasters which they happily provide. Cocktails/Mocktails served are excellent in taste and a lot of options are available. I would suggest you go for LIIT as it is the best cocktail mix I have had after visiting almost every available bar/pub/restaurant available in North Kolkata.
The options for food are limited but the available options are pretty good be it the taste or the presentation.
Calamari Fry, Chicken Wings (3 flavours available), Octopus, Wok Fried Fish and Crab Fry would be the best options from the food menu.
Main course options are limited if compared to main stream restaurants.
Staff is friendly and helpful. Ambience is very good, music is good as well. Wednesdays would be nice to visit the place as they arrange for live bands which normally do perform well.
1500 per person would be enough for a nice high and filled up tummy.
Good place for couples as well as a group of friends to hang out.
Last order for drinks is taken at 11:30 pm and Country Roads closes down at 12.
The place justifies a score of 4 in all respects

This was the second visit to this place when I went their yesterday with few of my friends. Last time I visited during day time and it was a quite affair. But this time the most annoying experience was the non stop full blast music. That spoiled the whole evening which otherwise would have been a nice beer drinking experience. Regarding the Kraft beer, I enjoyed both time . The grilled salmon in pesto sauce was a welcome change. But we had to leave the place without having dinner because of unbearable cacophony of loud music.

The best microbrewery in Kolkata. Their homegrown beers are awesome. The Scottish Ale is a must have one. They prepare delicious sides as well which complements the drinks beautifully. If you are looking for a place to hangout with friends and have quality beer, this is the place to be in.This is what beer is supposed to be. Just loved it. Apart from this the place is run with passion by owners who are foodies themselves and they are mostly around making sure that the guests are taken care of. I strongly recommend the craft beer to all beer lovers in Kolkata.

It's been very rare occasion when I wrote any bad review on Zomato. On Zomato it seems a perfect place to hang out with friends. So we went there attracted by their microbrewery as well as the Happy Hours they offer. So at first when we asked about their happy hours they told us there's no happy hours. We told the waiter that we came here after seeing their Zomato profile and then we even showed their Zomato profile on our smartphone to that waiter where it clearly says Happy Hours started from 12PM. Then when we decided to order the crafted beers, they told us only the German Weizen is available out of the three crafted beers they offer. The Belgian Blond and Scottish Ale isn't available. Being compelled we ordered the German Weizen and it tastes not so different than common beer frankly speaking. And the food item they are showing on Zomato is much different than their actual ones. There's not much anything good to say about this place. Apart from the atmosphere and ambience nothing else is good at Country Roads.

We went the place with lot of expectations, it's far away from the main city. I So thought place will have a lot to offer. 
But all things turned sour. Ambience is okay, but food was utter bakwas. The crispy chilly baby corn was the worst of all. 
We ordered LIT pitcher of 1ltr but it had more than 700ml by vol of ice. Even the brewery quality is poor. 
Staffs were really awful as per as service and courtesy is concern. Had a horrible tie here today.

Went there on dashmi evening where they were running there puja special menu. Less options for veg starters and among that also one was unavailable. We were left to order tandoori alu and quesadilla. Very average. I somehow didn't like the quesadilla. For drinks we ordered kiwi group, that was kiwi lemonade, which tasted nice. Sangria in red wine was looking appealing, tasted okay. Service was quick but presentation wasn't delightful. The cocktail looked sad in a mason jar. Also, we were served broken plates which was a big turn off.

Went on Panchami evening with friends. As per my knowledge, this is the first microbrewery in Kolkata. My husband and our friend ordered the German Weizen (wheat beer) and I called for a watermelon basil martini. We were happy with the drinks. We were not hungry so ordered just a chicken nachos on the side. I have had chicken nachos at a lot of other pubs where the nachos, cheese and chicken are usually baked together. However, here nachos were just dipped in a cheese and chicken sauce which did not quite appeal to me. Ended with 60 ml Sauza silver shots. Would update this review after I try more from their menu, but for now it is a 3.5 from my side.

Wanted to get away from the crowd on saptami '16.Hence dropped in here.It is located near Hometown in Rajarhat inside a building called the Galleria.They brew their own beer.There are 3 options in beer which you get to taste before you order.We had ordered two glasses of the drunken wizard or something and a glass of LIIT.The LIIT was really good.Beer was good as well.Quite reasonable as the bill was exactly 1100 bucks.Decor is nice and the ambiance is great.The playlist rocks.

Went there with a lot of expectation, but sadly was really disapointed. first of all, only one type of crafted beer was available that day as opposed to the four that was mentioned in the menu,i believe when a place advertises itself as a microbrewery, they should atleast have all the beers. Secondly the  servers were quite rude, we had to ask three times for the food menu. The food was average, compared to the price they charge, they seriously needs to step up on the food department. Overall not at all a good experience, wont be coming back any time soon.

I entered this place and felt that finally, finally Kolkata is catching up with its gastropub contemporaries.  And then the following happened:
1. Only two types of beer available as opposed to the four (I guess) mentioned on the menu.
2. No breezer available.
3. No French fries or wedges available (what even?).
4. The quantity on a chicken nachos plate/platter was a joke.
5. The non veg platter just about decent.
6. We ordered chicken noodles and were served mixed noodles instead.
7. The prawns in the mixed noodles weren't de-veined and the poop shoots were just staring at us. 
8. The mocktails were so sugary that our non-alcoholic friends stuck to fresh lime soda.
9. The service is sloppy. And slow. And rude.
10. Most of us woke up with a stomach upset the next day.

I'm sticking to my old favourites in Kolkata for the rest of the Pujo days.

So this place was on my bookmarks from the time it had been launched since it was the only Microbrewey in Kolkata. Visited yesterday evening and it was a pleasant experience. The ambience totally awesome. Service was also impressive. Coming to the food and beer.
Food: I ordered a Badshahi Paneer Sula and House Wings with BBQ sauce for starters and both of them were pretty good. the paneer was very soft and fresh. chicken too was tender. Ordered mac n cheese in mains and it was too good. Simply blown by its taste. The menu is very compact with not much choices in vegetarian though. Eg I didnt saw an option of mushroom. The dessert section also needs to be worked upon. All they had was an ice cream.

Beer: I had the german weizen which is i guess their rendition of the hefeweizen. Well I was very sad to see that they didnt had a porter/stout on their taps. Its a common beer category should be available in my opinion.

Overall i would revisit the place for the hefeweizen and the mac n cheese😊😊😊😊😊😊

I was really looking forward to sampling their menu. But I have to say, I was slightly disappointed.
I'd ordered the honey n chilli chicken wings. This was reasonably good. And the spare ribs. This wasn't good at all.
In my opinion, the chef was too heavy handed with the sauce, and no other ingredient, including the mutton, touched my taste buds.
The mashed potatoes accompanying the ribs were worse. It tasted of salt and potatoes - that's it.
If they are advertising themselves as a microbrewery and nothing else, then food like this might be pardonable. Else...
Would not recommend it to anyone for food.

P.S. Will write a separate review for their bar!

Located in the Galleria Mall opposite Novotel in newtown Country Roads is part of the new trend in Kolkata of Restro Bars with Micro breweries.There speciality is there home brewed beers and house cocktails.I am not a fan of beer so tried a few of there cocktails and they were pretty good.The Dynamite,which is there house special and includes 8 varities of liquor is sure worth a try.Options for food are also good,there is a nice mix of Indian,Continental and Chinese.So if your live or work in newtown/rajarhat this is worth a visit.

I was looking forward to good food, good music and good spirit. Got them all, though at a pretty high price. The ambience is happening with peppy loud music. I didn't expect the music to be low as it is a pub so I won't complain about the loudness. The waiters are quick to serve and take orders. The food was served pretty quickly, even though it was a Saturday night. We ordered Yakitori, Noorjahani tikka & Chicken wings in BBQ sauce. Really good food. We repeated the chicken wings. The chicken stroganoff was tasty as well. The alcohol is expensive, as is with most pubs. We had been suggested a snack of cashews with salad veggies which was surprisingly tasty with the alcohol. Overall, music 3.5/5, food 4.5/5, service 4.5/5, price 3/5.

This place is kinda okay if all you want is a beer,  but fails to deliver on making it a nice experience overall. I guess microbreweries still got a lot to catch up in kolkata to meet the expectations we have (reference standard would be Delhi, Chandigarh, Bombay)
Also these people need to train the staff better,  as they seemed to be completely uninterested. I understand it's not  a fancy job. But now since you are at it, do it right.

Fresh beer off the vats is mind blowing of course. Tried the chicken wings in honey. Tasted lousy as the chicken was stale,probably two month old. Dropped dinner plans and went off to Axis Mall across the

Amazing place, ambience, food and drinks. One of the very few places, you can get tequilla shots at affordable prices.

The service is good too. Although located in a little off-beat place, you can still have a very good time with friends here. It was my first visit to a microbrewery, so was a little fascinated. 
Not a beer lover, but liked trying out different beers.

This place is over rated. It's noisy,  had uncomfortable seating arrangements, lights that make u like ur calm.  The servers don't know what beer they have, or the concept of chilled beer and wth they don't even know to pour beer onto a glass or mug, saving the froth.

The first microbrewery in Kolkata and quite a cool one. When we went there, we ordered for a Sangria and Roaders. Both of them are awesome in a reasonable price.  Roaders is their own version of LIIT (Long Island Iced Tea). Instead of coke as in the case of LIIT, they use Blue Curacao to prepare the Roaders. To my amazement, they customized this classic cocktail beautifully. I'd like to visit this place again soon.

Amazing place, ambience, food and drinks. One of the very few places, you can get tequilla shots at affordable prices.

The service is good too. Although located in a little off-beat place, you can still have a very good time with friends here. It was my first visit to a microbrewery, so was a little fascinated. 
Not a beer lover, but liked trying out different beers.

This place is over rated. It's noisy,  had uncomfortable seating arrangements, lights that make u like ur calm.  The servers don't know what beer they have, or the concept of chilled beer and wth they don't even know to pour beer onto a glass or mug, saving the froth. Food is avoidable, wings and nachos and everything others have posted here-in simple English they aren't worth the money.

Foods and drinks are good..high level hangover alert for those who are taking Liit or jimmeys jar..but they take extra 27%tax apart from vat and service tax on the whole bill..didnt get any justified reply from management when asked..so beware of getting pick pockets in the form of huge tax..

Country Roads is a microbrewery located on the 2nd floor above Jagdish Store opposite to Novotel. The place is buzzing with office going crowd from the Newtown/Rajarhat area. Sitting area is quite small and the high chairs are not very comfortable. Speakers are not good that's why music gets 1/5. They have 3 types of beers out of which I liked the Belgian blonde the most. They have a great selection of starters both veg and non veg. We ordered tandoori aloo which had a little sweeter taste. Veg submarine burger was really good along with crispy potato wedges. Noorjahani is the one I liked the most     Perfectly cooked and spiced with the regular green chutney. Service is very quick and staff is friendly. Ambience gets 3/5.

Never been to a micro brewery ever. As this was my first experience this whole brewery thing was a 'Waoh' . Perfect place to hangout with friends and colleagues with drinks of your choice. The incessant smell of brewing beer is a plus to drinker and a minus for non drinkers.
The food is average though. The menu is limited. The quantity is decent but the tastes are average at the best. I would have rated it higher had it been a bar only. But, this being a restaurant as well, needs more to deliver.

Being a beer lover and a New Town resident, Country Roads has long been on my list. It's a hidden gem inside the sleepy Galleria mall..the mall's deserted alleys and vacant shop spaces were a stark contrast to what Country Roads had in store for us...it was almost magical how the lonely mall suddenly transformed and we were in the middle of a crowded and vibrant space..I wanted to try the crafted wheat beers and so I ordered all three one after the other...I liked the ale best but the other two were good as well..to my surprise they were served in mason jars, which I thought was a nice little touch... We ordered chicken wings to go with the booze... The wings were so yummy that we ended up ordering it a second time.. Country Roads deserves a perfect rating for its ambience, food, and most importantly trying something daring.

In a deserted mall that reminded of dawn of the dead, one place was booming with music and bustling with happy chatter. It was Country Roads on the 2nd floor of DLF Galleria.

Great food, awesome beer, and an ambience to match. It is an experience to be there on a Friday night. Being a regular of HRC Mumbai, it kind of reminded me of that. Ordered (and repeated) their house special wings (spicy). Too good. Followed that with masala papad tokri, Brochette de Langoustine al Oriental, and Miso Goreng. Everything was great (taste and amount). For drinks we had all three of their crafted options but I loved the Scottish Ale the best. I finished my meal off with The Red Lips. It was almost like an apple milkshake but lighter, smoother, and yummier.

Why 0.5 missing? Because they should serve steak. That was all that was missing. And I would make a few more tweaks to the food menu. It's too safe. :)

Microbreweries are our new answer to all the beer cravings. Country roads is a fairly new micro brewery and family restaurant in Rajarhat in the Galleria mall. It has a sprawling seating arrangement . You can see the fresh beer being brewed in front of your eyes in a glass enclosed area. The staff is very polite and helpful. They generally brew three different kinds of beer but the downside is that you can never find all the three types in a single day. Me and my friends tried the Scottish ale which was pale in colour and was less bitter  in comparison with any other beers available in the market. The food is quite tasty but nothing extraordinary. This place has the vibe of a classic American restro and can be visited once in a while for a sip of freshly brewed beer with friends. :)

Rajarhat needs more such places. Have been here thrice and the quality of food , music and service is on the rise. What i love the most here is the Belgian brewed beer. Perhaps can add a more variety in starters as the options are limited. Finally , it would disappoint me to listen to guetta when I am expecting country side songs. Music has improved though. Would rate 3.5. Hope they keep doing better and will visit again.

Why depend on foreign brands when beer can be fermented in house? Beer fans can now rejoice. Microbreweries are the new in Calcutta. Country Roads is a Family Restaurant and Microbrewery serving in house beer, cocktails as well as Indian, Chinese , and Continental Snacks and Dining.

Location: The beer cafe-restaurant has opened.up at the heart of IT land in New Town, Rajarhat. Located in the Galleria mall , just beside the Pride hotels in Rajarhat.

Decor and Ambience: It is a slick joint keeping up with the trends of beer cafe. The glass walled onsite tanks looks subtly smart with a promise to brew the best flavours in town. The red, beige and brown sofas, a sprawling bar, TV screens, brick walls and English classics keeps the place alive. The cosy ambience is a sheer breakthrough amidst concrete tall buildings. 

Food: Was invited to taste their innovative in-house beers, cocktails and some innovative starters to complement the mood.

Beverages- The Beer which we served that day was

1. German Wiezen - German Wiezen has pale in colour with wheat based beer.

this eatery is situated on the second floor of GALLERIA MALL,rajarhat.This eatery has it's own microbrewery.The freshly brewed beer has 3 category :German,belgium & scottish.I had tried german & belgium.German was mild while the belgium was sweet in taste.In the food section I had fish tossed with bell papers & YAKITORI.Foods were good in taste.serving time was a bit too long,attendants were informative.The beer would come in 250ml & 500ml glass.Decoration was nice & very much contemporary.Fifeteen hundred to two thousand will be the cost for two.

This place holds a mesmerizing charisma in itself, at least I felt so at that time 🍺😉.

Well on a serious note, the place is a fabulous hideout for spending some quality time with friends. The interior fashions a contemporary look with pretty fancy lights, comfortable couches and some TVs for the sports days. The prime uniqueness here is that it has its own mini-brewery system which can be seen from within the seating area. Four kinds of beer are brewed here. 

The food selection too is pretty sumptous and holds quite a variety in it. We had ordered for quite a lot of chicken dishes (the names of which I never knew 😝). All of them were absolutely brilliant.

As its situated within the upcoming Newtown area, it is not very crowded and gives its customers a chance to socialize and enjoy to the fullest. A must visit from my end.

Microbrewery is THE attraction for all to throng this place and that's how we decided to drop in despite not being a beer aficionado. Interior is nicely done up with nice music keeping the spirit high. You get to see a young workforce running around to take care of guests under the General Manager Mr Abhijit Chakraborty. The quality of food and presentation was all quite good. Freshly brewed beers came in 3 variety aka region viz, German, Belgian and Scottish. While I found German to be mild, Belgian tasted a bit too sweet with caramelized sweetener. Scottish was more closer to Indian taste bud. I hope to find a few more of variation in the coming days. I also hope the story of microbrewery in kolkata continues and grows with the time.

Place is good. I went there last night with my friends. There is one issue with the entrance of the galleria mall. As the mall is not opened completely yet, people are less but the road condition before the entrance is so bad. 
Coming to food... not costly at all, but taste is also average. Order "Chilli paneer" with some dry sausce, Crispy babycorn, some Fish items and 2 plates of hakka noodles. Whats unique about them? The 500ml beer mugs. There are some quotes in there walls... "two beer or not two beer: shakesbeer"... hilarious and inspirational. Two girls were promoting some cigarette brand and gave a packet of cigarette each for free for a foolish survey to everyone in our group. Btw they were hot. Beverages are good.. but do not try Belgian beer, German ones are good. Normal whiskey we ordered, complementary oil fried papad was there. We went out of that bar around 11:15 pm.
Happy weekend. :)

The first thing that strikes one is how far Country Roads is... but the interiors of the place is lovely... and it is one of the first micro breweries in Kolkata. Me and friend went to the place after we received a voucher of 500/- and a free sampler (of their home brewed beer) from Zomato! 
We ordered a pint of Scottish ale which was okay I suppose, can't give you my opinion as I am not a beer person at all.
The food however was mostly disappointing,
We ordered chicken nachos which was corn chips with a chicken chutney.... which tasted weird.
The pasta alfredo with chicken always ordered and we got veggie pasta first, and then we had to call the server at least 5 times and then he came and changed it... although he was very courteous I admit. The chicken breast with veggies and jus was the other order, the chicken was dry and not at all tasty. The food could be improved upon.... but top marks for decor and services . And if it was not so far away I would have certainly gone once more to see if they had anything better food on the menu!!!

If you stay in Bangalore and when you talk about microbreweries, there are a bunch of them in the city which excite any party animal.
So when I stepped into this microbrewery, I was excited and eager as well to know how such thing is gonna turn out in Kolkata. The place didn't disappoint me at all. Although I didn't get all their freshly brewed beer. But on a weekday, the place was amazing enough. With nice music, ambience and on top of everything a live stand up comedy show. Quality of the food disappointed me a little. That can be improved. The smoking zone is suffocating. But overall a very decent place to hang out.

Country Roads is a welcome addition to this side of town. It has the typical Irish pub feel to it.. the decor and interiors adding to it. The concept is of a microbrewery which means the various types of beers are brewed in house in huge barrels which are visible to the customers. It is a new concept in Kolkata and is catching up with the trend. The place was visited thrice by me and my friends. The first two times the food and drinks were good. But the third time was disastrous. The nachos, the chilly chicken and the nasi goreng tasted the same. The gravy was the same with the items being changed as per the order. The chicken steak was also not up to the mark both in quality and quantity. The only food which had consistency was the Russian burger. It's a must try item at country roads. Overall a very average joint which has a lot of potential and opportunity to save it's grace. 
Tried the chicken wings in honer chilly sauce...it was terrible. The chicken was smelling and it was uncooked. Horrible food.

Got to know about this place from Zomato, after reading the reviews finally decided to drop by.. Quite a nice place to hangout in the evening. food is good also got to know this interesting fact that it is the only microbrewery in Calcutta.. Though I am not a fan of beer..
anyways coming to the food the quality is really really good,we ordered a beer and a cosmopolitan for drinks and a chicken stroganoff and pollo steak au rosemary jus.. Both the items were really really delicious..it's a must try if you go there , but as it was served as the main course so they should really work on the quantity..for desert we ordered something mixed fruit ice cream which was 3 scoop of ice cream of 3 different flavours (vanilla, strawberry and chocolate) and the whole bill came around 1500 something..
Also an amazing thing happened is that there was some show going on and after a fun chitchat with the host we ended up getting free shots..
So manage a good company and this place is ideal for you..

I heard about this concept long back through my friend circle. now i am really happy that finally in kolkata country roads introduced this type of concept. their speciality in house fresh brewed beers.it is a all new concept and very unique one. located second floor of the Galeria mall,now the mall is very new all of the stores are not yet opened.the term craft beer was coined to distinguish the distinctive product of micro and regional breweries from the products of traditionally large breweries.come to the restaurant it was just lovely ambience with some extraordinary interiors.around 90 above seater.consist with comfortables sofas and tall chairs. i was invited there by the management with my fellow foodies to taste the lovely drinks along with lip-smacking starters.we started our session with lovely drinks.

Went there on a Thursday afternoon for lunch.
Firstly, they just had one variety of beer available. That too was not served cold. Imagine paying Rs. 200 for such a filthy beer!
Secondly, we hav ordered for a veg. Nachos. When the order came, we found a worm moving on top of the nachos platter. Gross!!!!
After all such incidents, when we asked to talk to a higher authority, there was no one available and the staff casually ignored the incident and said sorry.
I dont know the story on weekend's , but if such is the quality on any given day, then just imagine the quality you will be served on a busy weekend when ur drunk!!

THINK BEFORE GOING!!!

In the words of the classic song... Country roads.. Take me home, to the place i belong.... This place actually is nice to hang out with friends. Brewed beer and good quick delivered food to table is what i like to see in most places, could improve on Margarita's but then again its tiny details in the overall nice picture which could be overlooked.. Will surely try it another time or two.... Will recommend the place only if u go with friends.... Otherwise u will sulk watching others with friends

Bloggers Meet over Tasting session at Country Roads Microbrewery

Country Roads was the first microbrewery in the city of joy, it was set up when most of the city dwellers were not even very conversant with the term ‘microbrewery’. After Country Roads came into picture two more microbreweries started their operations and within couple of months Kolkata boasted of having three microbreweries which is quite a feat in itself. So since this kid and the concept are pretty new in town, let me just run through the information what a microbrewery is supposed to be. As the term goes, microbreweries are small brewing units independently owned and much smaller in size when compared to giant corporate breweries. In encompasses the concept of Craft Brewing that gives the importance to high quality and essence of crafted beer rather than concentrating on the quantity produced.
                                                                ...

Where do i start from...
This place situated in Newtown, Rajarhat, inside The Galleria. The coolest pub & the first microbrewery in town.
This place surprised me with its ambience. Perfect lighting, perfect music, the interior is perfect with the setup of microbrewery on 1 side of the room encased by glass casings. Such place in Kolkata does exist.
Food: We ordered apetizers only. House special wings(12 pieces) & Yakitori. Foods were tasty.
Brewed Beer and Camino silver tequilla was a pure bliss. This was my first time with the tequilla & the experience was quite good.
The service out here is amazing, the waiters are very generous and they were quick.

Though i broke a glass & the people working there are so generous that they did not even charge for that, it was a shameful moment for us but they did not act to it they were very cool. They laughed and told that it is completely fine.
I am so in love with this place, gonna visit this place again, very soon.

Will explore more and update more.

Brewed beer at its best. .ambience is average but music is too loud. .When u r having a Scotish Ale or a Belgian Blonde the hard core loud metal tracks playing in the background does not match the ambience. ..However sea food was excellent. .I tried the kalamari and squid both and they were really tasty. ..All in all if u like loud music while drinking then it will be a 5 star. ..

Nice looking place with various seating arrangements. The lighting is perfect too. And you have an overhead light above each table. Music is almost inaudible.

Food. We had the Dora Kebab, a mutton delicacy, chicken wings, and the massive Triple X Sauce Russian Burger. It's huge, and very good too. The Dora Kebabs were very tasty too, a little hot though.

BEER. They have three blends, but only the Belgian Blond was available. Wheat beer. Very nicely brewed. With the right texture and a malty aftertaste. But no pitcher. Funny thing, they have 1.5-liter pitchers of LIIT, but not their own beer.

Anyway, cool place. Worth a visit.

Well my experience with this citys new microbrewery is average , Everyone going gaga over citys new trend crafted beer . I went there on Sunday afternoon, and amongst 3 types of crafted beer only 1 was available. Along with I ordered their signature dish ' Russian Burger ' , but it was nothing new compared to the other Burger as it was signature dish . The ambience is good as they have some live band concert during weekdays I guess . Overall I would give 3.5 .

Last Saturday, i been there for a glass of beer in Country Roads Microbrewery in The Galleria, New Town .  First thing i would like to tell you about the decor and ambience. They have designed this bar cum restaurant like what we have seen in UK or other part of the world . Loud Music gives you the rhythm to drink more. Their sitting arrangement is perfectly made for casual dining and drinking. I have seen they have very good side dishes in the menu. I tried the beer from their own brewery and also veg nachos. Both were good. 

they have some downside which i think, will be taken care of very soon. Stuffs are not so professional. They didn't have enough options of beer although i was there at 6:30pm. i was told that more option of beer will be available after 7pm. 

I will visit this place again very soon!! also recommend others..

An intoxicating evening at Country Roads, Rajarhat..!

Country Roads, one of the coolest, popular and the first microbrewery in town welcomed Team Panchphoron with open arms for a food and beer tasting event. Located in the quiet and calm Rajarhat, this place is an easy find. Just pop up Galleria Mall in the Maps and you shall reach this place. The interior is quite vast, and to an approximation can easily handle around 150 heads. With the setup of microbrewery on one side of the room and encased by glass casings, it is quite a sight to behold. With this concept of brewery not so popular in this city, Country Roads brought a much needed change to introduce all of us to this much talked about variant.

The ambiance here is very simple and not eye-catchy. The dim lights actually help you to get imbibed with the intoxicity of the surroundings. The sitting space deserves a special mention as they are all cozy and provides you with the ultimate comfort. The place is always buzzing with people, so do not be surprised if you have to wait in the queue or if you find a certain variant of beer already over. The staffs are ever-friendly and always working on their toes to give you the ultimate experience. There was already a set menu prepared for us, and we wasted no time but dig in instantaneously as soon as we had arrived.

BEER:

1) German Wiezen: Based out of wheat, the color and appearance of this particular variety is absolutely pale. The froth is almost negligible, but do not get fooled by the simplistic appearance. The flavor quite packs a punch and has strong smell of raw wheat. Normally popular in the foreign countries, you may also find a high citric consistency, giving you a rather fruity and strong flavor at the same time. To me, this could be an ideal replacement for Desert Wine!

2) Belgian Blond: This one had a high citric consistency as well, but to me it was higher than the German Wiezen. The appearance here was light golden, almost in sync with the regular beers we see and consume in our daily life. The froth level was a bit more than the German one, but with the amount and consistency of froth combined with the coloring, one may assume it to be a Peach flavored or Passion Fruit Flavored drink as well.

3) Scotish Ale: The tanginess and bitterness was the highest here. Made out of light ale, this drink was the strongest, and hence may be resented by few. The citric level was too high, and personally, having given up on drinks since many years now, I passed the drink on to my fellow bloggers who happily enjoyed the courtesy sharing. The color here is the darkest, almost giving you a hint of how strong this beer can be. For the hip-hoppers and crazy alcoholics, go for this one, if you are up for a challenge.

DRINKS (COCKTAIL):

4) Watermelon Spritzer: The citric content of the watermelon did not go well with the citric consistency of the beer. The taste was a bit conflicting as per my palette. Served in a tall glass, the drink looked appealing enough. Can be tried by someone who prefers fruitiness.

5) Puchka Shot: One of the most innovative drinks, this one had a mix of tamarind water to go with Vodka and a Phuchka on top of it. A throwback to the quintessential Phuchkas and our love for it, this one had a unique flavor altogether. Must try if you are here.

6) Blue Berry Blush: A mix of Blue berry and Bacardi, the appearance was quite strong with beyond natural texture. An upgrade to the usual Blue berry mojitos and lemonade, this was quite flavorful and refreshing.

7) Tango Twist: What would you expect when Capiso Sause goes with a Cocktail? With a mix of Capiso Sause, Vodka and Canberry Juice, this one was a spicy affair altogether. The juice provided enough citric flavor to balance the spicyness overall. Must try if you have undying love for spicyness.

8) For The Angles: A simple version of the Phuchka shot, this one just lacked the Phuchka. A simple mix of tamarind water with Phuchka, this one was a perfect blend of alcohol and tanginess with both of them complimenting one another.

FOOD:

9) Fried squid with Garlic Mayo: Soft squids, tossed in a thin batter, and fried to crispiness and light brown. Served with garlic mayo and almost minimalistic decoration, this one was a perfect starter for us to go with the flavored beers.

10) Calamari Salt & pepper: Probably tossed in some sauce, and wasn’t the dry variant I was expecting. A bit on the drier side, I didn’t like it as much as I did the other two starters for the evening.

11) Szechuan Fried baby Octopus: The cut-through against the Octopus is never easy, as it has a tendency to get stiff within a small amount of time. For many, this particular seafood variety may seem chewy, but to me, the ones served here was absolutely soft. Tossed in spicy and tangy Szechuan sauce, the batter was light, thin and crisp and was again a perfect love affair with the mighty beers and cocktails.

The USP for this place would always be their microbrewery. For beginners like me, I found them with a bit citric touch and the mocktails a bit spicy, but rest assured, the toxic level here is so high, that you are bound to come back again and again. I was astonished to hear, how some of their popular beers and cocktails gets over by evening, with so high the demand being! The service here was quite good, and with affordable price, this place surely visits a drop-by!

This place can be marked out among few of newly opened microbreweries in kolkata. Commuting to this place can be a little concern for some but manageable. Weekdays would hardly see much of crowd so can be a good option for those doesn't like much of hustling. The speciality lies in fresh home brewing of crafts beer. Food is just up-to-the-mark. Decor is quite bright and spacious. Overall it can be quite a good option for weekend hangouts.

This one hardly needs any introduction. Kolkata’s very first microbrewery excelling in brewing speciality craft beers. A restaurant cum gastrobar, fresh brewed beers are the specialities of this outlet. The concept of in-house brewing though not uncommon in India, was totally absent as far as Kolkata is concerned. We used to listen about those awesome craft beers from our friends in Bangalore. Not only friends, even tv shows & popular online webisodes were practically teasing us all the time. The idea of a microbrewery in Kolkata seemed a far-fetched dream! Country Roads came to the rescue, thanks to God that it did!

Go straight from hometown where the road ends on the right is entrance to this mall. On second floor of that building. If it's a weekend it's very dull area. 
Ambience inside is nice. However, being a microbrewery it was serving only of the kinds :( 
Also it has only three options. 
Something new in Calcutta that's only good thing about this place. 
Food doesn't taste good. 
Another good thing about the place is its good service. Well behaved and good staff.

The beer they serve here tastes like some liquid prepared at home. It can be hardly termed beer. It is not cold and has no fizz. I have had the best beer in Gurgaon microbrewery and was extremely disappointed to taste the beer here. If you have tasted the real stuff you will hate it here.

No doubt food and ambience wise, it is one of the finest in the city. Only thing is that the price is on little costlier side. But then again its upto your choice when you decide about the venue. Drink spread is also good (very good in fact) with only flip side that I experienced specifically was the home brewed beer they serve is not that chilled. When complained about it, the waiters told that it was highest chill which they could serve. That particular thing I didn't like. So if you are a beer lover and plan to be here for finest home brewed beer then the aesthetics may not satisfy you 100%. Rest is all good.

Went to this place with low expectations after a very disappointing experience at Beer Republic only to be pleasantly surprised. As far as craft beer is concerned (specifically the Scottish Ale) this place gets 10/10. The Long island iced tea was very well made as well although there was too much ice in it. Snacky foods were generally quite good and reasonably priced (Fried Calamari/Squid w 500 ml of Scottish Ale). The chicken wings were very good. The fried fish with tartare sauce was average and the Russian burger was distinctly underwhelming. But this place gets 4/5 for its amazing beer, well made cocktails and very palatable snacks. I honestly wish they had more offers on the craft beer since the maximum unit on offer is only 500 ml. Why not go up to pitchers (1L) or towers (3L)? I know I could easily drink a tower of their brewed beers in a single sitting with or without company.

I have spent 15 K in this place in one night we were 5 friends , i want to suggest you if you don't want to waste your money do not come here , Only beer they are having that is good else every thing at this place is bad.
Music Bad, Food Pathetic  Service of the staff like nobody listening you there when you order better to carry a whistle with you .
Let me tell you example of there food they have mutton kabab option you wont believe they are serving the kababs which available in  Spencer (Frozen ) and this restaurant is selling those kababs MUGHLAI dish .
Order chicken dish there will be Same Masala and Names Given different different Mughali Dishes they are .
Friends believe me i had a 15 thousand bill cause every time we were ordering different recipe hoping that next will be better .
Thanks

I had no idea about the existence of this restaurant till my friend @Subarna Sarkar got a gift voucher for this place from Zomato for writing some great reviews. It is situated in the 2nd floor of Galleria opposite Axis Mall Rajarhat and Novotel. They have a microbrewery inside where they brew three different kinds of beers. Neither of us are much of beer people, but our voucher included a free sampler, plus we were sitting at a microbrewery, so to honor the occasion we tried their Scottish ale. It was not too bad, it had a sweetish aftertaste, which was rather nice. We ordered the house special chicken nachos which tasted somewhat like papri chat with its tangy sauce and chickpea and tomato blended with the chicken pieces. 
In the main course we ordered the polo steak au rosemary jus (stuffed chicken breast in rosemary sauce with sauted vegetables, potato wedges and garlic breads on the side) and the penne in alfredo pasta. The chicken steak was a little unsatisfactory- the chicken was dry, the wedges were not cooked enough and the portion was rather small. The pasta was fine. We were served the vegetarian pasta at first, but when we realised the mistake the waiter was extremely apologetic and changed it immediately. 
Although the food has definite scope for improvement, the decor and the ambiance is really nice. The service is a little slow, but the waiters are extremely courteous. The real clincher was the bill. Even without a discount, it would have been really cheap.

Needs lots of improvement. Hardly any food available after 3-7pm. Even sometime it is just not the time, they just dont have any food to serve except Nachos and some Continental food which can give you heart attack.. they simply use ghee instead of butter. Seriously this resturant can change the meaning of continental dishes. Been there different times just for the crafted beer. Tandoori dishes were awesome. You will only get one choice out of three when it comes to crafted beer. So they have big time availability issues in regards to food and beer. They dont even play music in the afternoon. Some zombies staff who looks so unhappy...and yeah has to be.. No music No food... Nada...So what it is afternoon...it is a pub isnt??no one even lives there or going there for studies. Duh..? Comon...

The place is situated right at the extreme end in DLF Galleria. We went for a team lunch so could taste it's brewed beer :( but their service regarding food was satisfactory. We ordered Squid, some dishes in chowmin, rice and chicken which didn't tasted so exciting. They have a good interior which gives a feeling of pub. 
The restaurant is in need of some serious branding & improve in food quality.

We ordered Scottish ale, and it was really good in quality. The decor was also very nice.It has a very good menu(a perfect mixture of cuisines).Overall ,this place should be able to pull crowd.

This place is near to my flat. That's why I chose to go there. The ambience is average. It gets crowdy after 8pm. The staff cooperation is average. Try going in happy hours only, otherwise be ready to burn a big hole in your pocket. The only positive thing is that they have their own microbrewery. You might give it a try sometime.

Was there a while ago.. My bday.. 16.07.2016.. And the service was extra ordinarily horrible.. Just too bad.. 

Firstly,  They do not serve any complimentary munchies with the alcohol.. I mean which place in the world does that.. On top of that, they do not have any munchies in the menu itself.. Except masala papad, which we ordered and received soggy. The person waiting at our table was least bothered to be even present near the table, and dint even care to gv us a comfortable seating, even after repeated requests. Then we ourselves kept a track and found a table getting clear,  hence shifted there. They do not serve onions or chutney with paneer tikka.. Nor do they serve any condiments with indian food. Now I ask for a finger bowl and the reply is "we do not provide".. Period. Cherry on the cake.. They dint even ask for regular water the whole 2 hours we were there. No action was taken on my complaints to the waiter.. Or some apparently senior waiter.. Or even the duty manager present there. 

Am thoroughly dissatisfied & disappointed. Thanks for the great service.. You guys loose me as customer and probably many others am gonna ask not to visit your shit place.

Ever grateful to Zomato..for providing the voucher for Country Roads..
I was elated to be in such a microbrewery for the first time...
The ambience is classy..high step up stools in front of high desks just gives you that international feeling..comfortable couches..loud music.. bingo...a perfect place to party..
The Scottish Ale..was one of the best beers i have tasted..smooth flavour..honey coloured stuff made my day...
The house crispy wings in tangy garlic sauce was the perfect companion for this beer...a tad bit undercooked wings tossed in the sauce made me lick my fingers time and again..
The russian burger with xxx sauce served with gratin was out of the world..the mayonese..the cheese..bright colours..fresh veggies and the chicken patty..was a delight to my taste buds..moreover...the Yakitori was a perfect end to our gastronomical journey..skewered grilled chicken in a tangy sauce though very common tasted extraordinary...
Heartfelt gratitude to Zomato..for providing me the gift voucher....

Visited this place today. If you are a beer lover and u didn't checked over here, then it's a big miss for you. Tried Scottish Ale, and I must tell you it was superb!! The ambience was fantastic. Music choice is undoubtedly good. In food we had ordered Wok fried fish with bell pepper, Brochette de langoustine al oriental and Country's favourite. All of them were yummy enough to chew your finger till end.

They gave us one sample brewed beer which is made after more than one month of fermentation. To be very honest I have never ever experienced a beer with tangy taste !! I hope they are going to launch this one very soon.

So my recommendation is, go over there and enjoy a happy time. Get drunk with Scottish Ale. Cheers!!

P.S - I was very keen to try German Weizen and Belgian Blonde. But alas! At that time only Scottish Ale was available. So I want to request the concerned people of Country Road's, please keep all the brewed beers available, so that a 'MATAL' public like me can taste whatever I want 😃

Been there loved the concept of micro brewery which is at the very nascent stage in the town. Ambiance is fairly good however they still have a lot to improve on food and presentation both. Whisky was served over tall juice glasses, and alike. Food quality was average to good. The place is worth a visit, however they also need to improve on this.

Marks only for the fact that they have microbrewery and you get freshly brewed beer , not much costly too. 250ml is just 129, and 500ml just 199. That too in happy hours bogo. Food doesn't tastes great. Ambiance is ok, newly constructed spacious empty mall adds to the peace. Its perfect for a long drive down rajarhat road and freshly brewed beer to follow. Don't eat if not necessary ;) also at this moment they serving just one out of three types of in-house beer on their menu. By the looks of it, seems it would be half empty most of the time, still waiters aren't interested in serving you. Only for offering you second beer they are.

This place is a shame to be a microbrewery. Am on a visit to kolkata, and was drawn to this place since it was near and was a microbrewery as mentioned. As I stepped in, no complains on the ambiance. When asked on the best selling beer flavour - was informed there is only one flavour available!! That was shocking on a satarday evening! Anyway, ordered that ( am forgetting it's name- it was wheat something :-( ). Taste was just time pass - it was cloudy and watery, with lots of froath.
I felt the team had lost focus on it being a microbrewery - they were most happy serving other run off the mill cocktails. Felt like just another bar.
May be it's still some time off that Kolkata fcan appreciate a full fledged microbrewery - this place is not.
Service associates are comparable with any other road side bar - nothing to write about.
Food I ordered was excellent in presentation, but very average and oily in terms or taste. ( Tagdi Lazzis it was named I think).
Cost was low - may be that's the reason for all these. I was ok to pay more for a better experience - don't think this is a place for me.

Dlf galleria is one secluded stop and to have one of the handful microbreweries of the city here is to take away half the fun.The interiors have both couches and long stools,and barside seats to partake.The ceiling shows all the pipelines just like at Biker's cafe,I am not sure if this trend started with center pompidou,Paris.Anyways,we ordered wok fried fish,yakitori and their home brew german beer.The food,both of them,look better than they taste.Which is not to say they taste bad,but rather they are served pretty neat.Specially the yakitori is quite regular saucy chicken pieces skewered to look good.The beer is not too different than say a regular corona,just a bit golden hue,and less frothy,less bitter,and as I hear it,more healthy.The bright lit interiors and the young milieu provide added incentive to visit.

Must say its really close to my home and that makes me happy. I have longed for the fact that Kolkata didn't have microbreweries. But now it does and real close to my place. Specifically Belgium Blonde and Scottish Ale - both the beers are great to taste. All brewed beers for 500ml cost about 199 flat. We had it along with chicken wings. Its been crowded since the microbrewery opened. They play good music too!

The first brew pub in city. Ambience in good. Well decorated and cozy. The crowd is decent..music was too bad initially around 6pm then gradually as the crowd increased they gave good music. Brewed beer is really nice. The best one is the German one which is mostly ordered by all. Food is just average. Not bad not good. Price is reasonable. Bt serving time is too much. Our first order for 2 starters was served almost after an hour. 
House special wings-12 pieces of chicken wings..in a tangy sauce with chopped onion, little sweet flavor, good taste, quantity sufficient.
Wok fried fish with bell pepper- 8 small pieces Pan fried fish stirred in a sauce , with veggies and bell peppers. Quality of fish could be better. Average taste. Quantity very less.
Murg Nafeez- 6 pieces of chicken kabab, pretty bad and less tandoored, lacking the Smokey flavor. Did not like the item.
Country's favorite- Cheese Stuffed Fish Fry with tarter sauce. Good item. Liked the taste. Quality of fish could have been better, or more marinated. Tarter sauce is too less for 4 big pieces.
Ice cream with tutti fruity - 3 scoops of ice cream, vanilla chocolate and strawberry in a bed of Fruits, only small cubes of Apple they gave. Too mediocre. A home made dish would have been better.
Overall food is average. Nothing worth mentioning. Staffs are well behaved. Serving time and the taste should improve otherwise decent place for hangout with friends.

It is taken to account that the beer you get here is undoubtedly gorgeous. What surprised me was the delicious food that we came across.
To start with, there are three types of crafted beer on the menu, Belgian, German and Scottish. We had Belgian as the others were not available.
We ordered Chicken Stroganoff amongst continental, which was pleasant but could have been better. Amongst the available Indian dishes, we asked for Makkhanwala Tandoori Murgh and Noorjahani Tikka. The Tandoori Murgh was fascinating with the essence of rich butter thriving your lips. The tikka was good too, but was marred by the tandoori item at hand.
What totally ripped us off to a world of taste was the Chicken Wings. The flavor of honey was magically mixed with the BBQ sauce that proved to be soothing to the taste buds. 
Wish the management could improve a little on their continental and make sure that the choices for all the three crafted beers are gettable at all times.

We are very happy to have a place that serves continental food in this area. Finally got a chance of ordering food from this place. Ordered Chicken Penne in Alfredo, Pollo steak au rosemary Jus & Chicken stroganoff. At its best, all the dishes tasted average. The white sauce in the pasta & the Pollo steak tasted bit less on flavours. Specially when the prices are pretty steep, we do expect a far better quality of food. The quantity is also on the lesser side. Overall, I'm bit dissappointed with the food.

A microbrewery in Kolkata. Such happiness. 
Well for people South of the city it is far but then when you taste the beer you forget the fact that you traveled so much.  So we tried the German beer and it was very very nice.  The ambience is pretty neat especially because you see the brewing eqipment
 right in front of you. Very classy. Food was okayish.  They had a few things and we did have to wait an hour before the other items on the menu were made available. And they did run out of the German beer and again we did wait for a while. All in all it was a good experience.  Keep it up!

One of the very few microbreweries now operational in Kolkata, or should I say the one of the two microbreweries as far as my knowledge goes in this city. Have been there mostly on weekends so found a queue everytime. I guess an expansion could be helpful since this place is actually doing well. I have found only one variant of fresh beer available at any given point of time and thats the witbier. I would therefore request the management to introduce few more choices in beer like the microbreweries in other cities. I havent tried any main course at this place so wont comment on that. However the starters they offer is pretty decent. I am simply glad to have a microbrewery in my city to hang out and would like the thank you guys for the initiative...all the best!

Well,  Kolkata is slowly catching up the Microbrewery trend...!! The place is located  inside the uninhabited DLF Galleria mall.We had one of our office party and needless to say the place and decor is a complete delight.We were a group of 25 peoples and we all  were happy with the hospitality and free flowing drinks without waiting...!
The staff also greeted us with a cake to celebrate our success..! That indeed was a nice gesture...!
They house 3 variants of brewed beer of which a particular one available on a day.We were served Scottish ale beer on that Saturday night which was okay...!
For starters, i liked the house special nachos,Murg Nafeez & House special  wings..!Chef's non veg  platter also seemed to be  a good deal for us.
I also happened to try a few cocktails like long island ice tea & Dirty martini  and they did meet my expectations..!
Lets not compare Country roads to the Bangalore or Gurgaon microbreweries..This place has newly started up and has a long way to go...!

I generally don't write down reviews but last night's experience at this place calls for an exception. Been here once before, didn't like the food much back then either, but the overall hospitality and service was at par. The recent fuzz over the Microbreweries and Craft beer took us back to the place on a Saturday. 

Speak of bad service and hospitality. We sat on a four seating couch, and a guy from the pub actually asked to change our seats as it was two of us and the place is meant for fours.  So they shifted us to one of those towering footstools. The table wasn't cleaned properly which was gross and i believe a major turn off for anyone. To top that off we had to wait for long time till we had to actually call someone and request to take the order. The food, to no-one's surprise hasnt improved. Any "down the road" fast food joint serves better chicken nuggets than they do. The Music was loud and the playlist could have been way more hip. 
For what its worth the inhouse ale wasn't good enough either witha bad lingering aftertaste. So Bottomline.. Beer Bad, Food Bad, Service Very Bad. Not going back again. There are way far better places around to make your drink and dine a fine one.

Well I went there with a old friend of mine to try this new place. Its bang opposite to Novotel hotel. The place is spacious, sitting options are nice except the corner sofas. We ordered for chilly chicken,chicken kebabs I guess and beer. They don't have much options in beer. I didnt like the wheat beer. Waiters were to busy take the order at first places,they were very slow and they had no idea about the menu. We didn't like the overall experience and left the place without any repeat orders. At 7.30pm on Saturday,that's is a weekend they were not having enough stocks of beer to serve the customers. Little disappointed with the place. They need to work on the their staffs,menu.. Best of luck

The food was good, ambience good, beer BAD. They have ONLY wheat beer and it was cloudy, when asked the waiters didn't have a clue of what I was saying, and said " its like this here", when i went upto the bar then they admitted there was something wrong and since the manager is on leave they can't do anything. Settled for long island tea, which was drinkable, if you're a beer lover and been to good microbrewery it will be a disappointment

Ohk..So my first visit to the microbrewery!! Yeah!! N Thanks to #Samridhisinghvi of Zomato ..for the meal voucher...
Yes it was a gift from the Zomato team..Received the voucher on 20th June..N visited the outlet today(22/06/2016)..On my birthday.. :) 

Now the review---

Situated at the 2nd floor of the galleria mall..A well maintained place..
We went at about 2:30 pm...n it was not so crowded.. 
We ordered a Sangria, House special nachos(chicken) and whiskey(ab)!!

The House special nachos n sangria were too good..
The pricing is pretty decent..
The staff is really helpful but they the lack of training is evident...

Would defintly visit again(for the sangria n nachos) ..Highly recomended..(ideal for team lunch :-p )

A happy get together was spoilt by bad service and pathetically unhygienic atmosphere of the restaurant. To start with, even though they boast of 3 varieties of inhouse beer, only 1 was available which was a big disappointment. Next, the person serving the beer spills a glassful of beer on the table and breaks the glass. The replace it with a quarter glass of beer. Just when you think the worst part is over, you suddenly discover a DEAD FLY lying at the bottom of the glass. Just imagine the level of our disgust!!!!Food is below average, with very little variations and options. The serving time is pathetic. It took more than 40 minutes to serve a simple dish of chicken and butter naan.Have rated 0.5 extra for waiving off the price for a glass of beer in the final bill of 5k. Utterly dissatisfied at the experience.

Micro-brewery is the new buzz in the town! So on a Thursday evening me and two of my friends decided to go to this place known as Country roads, well nothing country about it!!

Location: located in a near empty mall where only this pub have people coming in.
Parking: Free and there is enough space to park
Ambience: Good
Service: Prompt and good, we ordered for Craft beer but only one flavour(german) was available.
Food: Did not order any food,  cannot comment on the same.

The reason to give 4 points to the place is because of the crowd they are pulling and any pub or bar looks best when packed and there comes the vibe! Cheers!!

When after travelling long we reach the destination we expect a lot specially when its about food because food is life!!!situated inside the Galleria in Newton opposite to the Axis mall and novotel!!!  Its like in a vast deserted place a single place serving food,as really the place was so  deserted nor do they operate the escalator,so we had to climb up the escalators till the 2nd floor,and then on the right and then left and comes The country Roads.

So the concept of microbrewery finally has been added in the city of Joy,food and foodies!!!
The decor is fine but as they have got nice space they should work upon the decor a bit more.

Coming to the hospitality the waiters are fine but not at all good at communicating with the customers.

We ordered mozzarella sticks which the waiter informed after 5mins to us that it wasn't available so we then replaced it with the recommended kasundi ka jhinga a prawn appetiser,which was very average in taste nothing special in the serving style,the prawns were cooked fine and that's all,then I we ordered a mac and cheese,when I asked is it the classic mac and cheese or something innovative you've done,the server was so confused,first of all when I asked about the macaroni he said it's just the cheese and veggies I was shocked as said mac and cheese contains no pasta nor does it comes as a baked dish,so I tried explaining him twice but he kept on repeating the same,so by getting fed up I just told him bring what we have ordered.

For the drinks we had Scottish ale beer and Russian choice well the beer was good but the Russian choice was okay,I couldn't get the aromatic taste of the red wine or the whiskey!!! 

Now the taste of the mac n cheese,first of all it contained penne pasta then it was baked,now what to say,the taste was average again,nothing special no burst of flavours as there are many good restaurants in the city serving delicious and far more better continental dishes so there's a tough competition always I just told them to be more understanding and improve,though they didn't bother to ask how was the food or the drinks being a newly opened place in town they should take feedbacks,to improve and make it more better as they have got all the needed things just no proper utilisation!!!

Heard about this place... with alot of hype about the first brewery in town.
Some of the famous reviewers recommended this place also.

Firstly it's a very odd located place to visit.. because of the location, to be precise the Galleria house is just opposite of Axis mall and beside of Pride Hotel.

I checked in to Country Roads with a hope to try some new brewed beers.

As this new trend of micro brewery hits the city and this place is one of them.I was excited, the decor is much like the chillis..the wooden furnish interior with american cafes kind of look.
Everything went dissopointing after that.
It was one of the horrible places i visited so far..they only offered one kind of brewed beer and remaining two which is in the menu are not available,when i enquired about the reason why all the three options of beer is not available. So they gave an illogical response by saying the fragmenting tanks are small in quantity until one flavor is finished they can't make another flavor.. ( Horrible reply ever expected from a so called brewery )

Even the only one beer we ordered..tasted pretty basic or rather pungent in taste.. ( just spoiled my mood )

And even the worst was that they didn't had an food menu...but they offered us to order something in fish which was only food being served their at that day.

I won't recommend this place to anyone not even for dates also.
Though it's reasonable place to buy a drink.
But ambiance is boring... normally local people go there for cheap booze.

Conclusion - Total waste of time..

A decent place but didn't live upto my expectation. After visiting places The Irish House, TGI Friday's, Chillis so many times, this place failed to impress me.

Coming to the food and drinks:
We ordered an appetizer Kasundi-Ka-Jhinga it took fifteen minutes to reach our table still waiting is not much of an issue if the food is good which it wasn't. It has a typical parar Bangali Biye bari kind of flavour to it which i hated. I had feeling as if I'm enjoying free food which wasn't the case. By the way this dish was recommended by the server whereas we wanted Mozzarella sticks which wasn't available thus we trusted the server and ordered.

For the main course we ordered Mac n Cheese & Country's Favourite. Now something I would like to say I think many of us we know that Mac n Cheese is cooked with Macaroni Pasta but here it was cooked with Penne pasta so they should mention it on the menu. People do notice. The server seemed clueless when he was asked about macaroni pasta so we didn't bother to carry on the conversation as our food was getting cold. But the Mac n Cheese was good though not like country's favourite which was again like a very average, the quality of fish was not good at all and it tasted like an average fish fry we get in any fast food corner in the neighbourhood. The only difference I found is the filling and that it was served with tartar sauce.
For the drinks we had a pint of Scottish ale beer which was very good. I think it was from the micro brewery they had and was the best thing we had over there. We also tried a Country Roads special cocktail, Russian Choice it was okay not that good.

Talking the Ambience:
It has all the elements to be one of the hip n happening places but for some reason I don't find it be so. The place seems dull & lifeless. I think they can do much more than what they are right now.

Service:
They do need to give special attention to their servers they lack good communication skills because sometimes they fail to make the customers understand what they are talking about. And also they should have proper knowledge about the food they are serving.

I hope they'll improve the way they are operating right now.

Confession: I wanted to rate the place 2.5 but my friend, a philanthropist, insisted on rounding it off to 3.

She and I visited Country Roads on an early weekday evening, navigating our way into the yet-to-be fully functional Galleria Mall, only to find that most of their brewed beer as well as most of the cocktails was unavailable and that the kitchen would be operational only after 6:30. So we whiled our time on a couple of cocktails and whatever food that they could serve up at 5.

(1) The House Special dish was surprisingly good and the fish was fresh.
(2) Chicken Wings (when the kitchen finally opened up) in garlic sauce wasn't too bad either but the pieces could've been larger or at least evenly sized.
(3) Caesar Salad was plain underwhelming with the miserly portions.
(4) While Cosmopolitan was fairly strong and well-made, Old Fashion seemed really dull and for lack of a better word, weird.
(5) They, disappointingly enough, only had Swedish ale of the three kinds of beer that they brew on their own, and the wheat taste of it, for me personally, was very overwhelming. I usually am fond of every kind of beer but it took me a long time to finish a glass of this.

The ambience is on the positive side but the music is too loud for even light conversation. The seats, though large and comfortable, have one downside: they are attached to one another, thus, if someone behind you moves in his/her seat, you're likely to feel it and quite a bit of it.

The concept of naming the bathrooms 'Roosters' and 'Hens' instead of the usual is novel and quirky but an accompanying icon on the doors would be helpful for those who might not be in the best shape to figure out the difference between the two.

The service is average and it was difficult to communicate with the waiter, especially with the loud music.

Inclusive of tax, the food and drinks (we also had a couple of rounds of white rum) came to 2304 rupees.

The ambience is great, perfect for a family dinner with members who also want to experience the pub feel! Service is very poor, some used (entho) beer glasses were being refilled with the nozzles being touched to the glass. We had ordered for a simple garlic naan and we waited for about 45 mins and found out that our waiter was too lazy to even place the order. Our tequila shots were diluted with water too. Bad experience due to service, but just hope that it will improve with time and feed backs.  And not to forget there were only 3 tap beers on the menu,  but only one was available....

A microbrewery in Kolkata. New concept completely. Its a very interesting place as u get to see the barrels of beer bein brewed. 5 on 5 on Ambience. The most disgusting part is the AC doesn't work properly so it was pretty uncomfortable sitting there. The staff members are excellent. They make u taste the house beers for free. The food and cocktails are excellent except for a chocolate cooktail (forgot the name though).
Its pretty crowded and if you are late you might have to stand in a queue to enter the place. For people living in South Kolkata...its a very off route but its worth try this new concept Microbrewery in Kolkata.

Even though their food Menu is not exhaustive but whatever they have are best.

I visited this place after looking at some positive reviews and because it has its own micro brewery which makes it only the second place now to boast about it. Situated in the the middle of Rajarhat in a deserted new Mall called Galleria, I have to say is not the ideal place for a new outlet to be situated. The décor seemed decent with the bar and the micro brewery visible straight when you enter. The menu is well maid with good variety to choose from. It is well priced too. I ordered for chicken wings and chicken nachos. Both were decent both in terms of taste and portioning. My issue with the place starts with the micro brewery itself. With 3 variety of fresh brewed beer to choose from, they only have 1 variety available at any given point. It's a complete disappointment considering, that's the selling point of the place. The service is ok but the servers need to be more cheerful. An experience that could have been better.

Such a welcome change in the drab dining scene in Rajarhat! And the awesome microbrewery only adds up to the 'eating-out' experience! Order what catches your fancy on the menu and be sure that you won't be disappointed! The food portions could be a tad bit bigger, but given the delectable house brews, it was all a worthwhile evening!

The entrance very slippery and dirty to move up the stairs. Senior citizens and kids to be careful as the entrance gets horrible if it rains. Unfortunately I landed up the day it rained. 

Entered with my partner. Staff well behaved and attentive. 

Main attraction are mini breweries. Sad but just ONE FLAVOR WAS AVAILABLE - the German Beer. 

Food - Chef's Non Veg platter - didn't  seem to be eye catching and very ordinary taste. Costing Rs. 599 for 4 pieces of chicken nugets, 4 chicken wings and 2 pieces of horribly cooked mutton, neither seemed eye catching nor did it surprise my palate. 

My partner ordered Masala pappad. Surprised it came with mixed salads of on every layer, looked Mexican but tasted like roadside. How on earth do you give pappad with salad on top? It spoils the whole crispy part of it, and ruins it. 

Ordered another chicken kebab item ( hoping things will be better ) but again failed. Either the Chef doesn't know how to cook, or the raw materials are just pathetic. 

Only attraction is Beer. 

Please note rather my advice: Eat outside and just come for drinks here. Else you might end up having a very bad day. Cheers.

The trend of microbrewery has landed in Kolkata holding the hands with Country Roads.

**Location**
At New town Rajarhat. On the opposite side of Axis Mall the new Galleria Mall. On the side of the Pride hotel and home town.

**Ambiance & Decor**

With a small sized microbrewery displayed while entering this place has set up a chilled out ambiance with the wooden tables and different styled stools all around. With that there are sofas was well as a part of their interiors.

**Food & Drinks**

We had tried various food and drinks here...

I had high expectations from their food part which they fail to meet. A little over hyped.

1. Nachos chicken: very ordinary expected better
2. House special wings: This was nice and delicious
3. Nurjhani tikka: Usual chicken tikka nthg special
4. Tandoori aloo khusnama: Well prepared and quite liked it.
5. Wok fried fish with Bell pepper: The taste of the dish was nice but the quality of fish needs improvement.

Drinks:
Beers are the most attractive part over here. Stick to that only. Others are very ordinary.

Virgin mojito: Average
Martini: Decent
The jimmies jar: Really a quality one.

Rossogolla shots : Very innovative one but it is not attractive as it sounds too be.

**Service**
First I got impressed with their crowd management but later on while entering the place the service became very disorganized. It was not the staffs fault but I feel they are under staffed to handle usual crowd. Also lack of training also there because a place like this needs some expert people who will guide others. I hope management will take it seriously and try to improve.

It was after a long wait that I got to visit this place. I had read about it here itself. So on entering the restaurant it has a bar like feeling, which obviously fits in with their own brewery. We had gone for lunch so we did not get the opportunity to try any drinks. Food is good,not very extraordinary. Staff behaviour however was not up to the mark. While ordering please do it carefully, or else the staff might confuse you.

Brief: The First Micro-Brewery in Kolkata is a disappointment. Hope the second will be better.

Ever since the first micro brewery put up its signboard in Galleria, New Town, we were waiting to have a turn at this place that would bring pride to Kolkata, rather New Town, by taking it in league with happening cities of India. This particular Sunday we got the opportunity to fulfil our desire.

As we entered, the visible beer vats were an exciting invitation to enjoy freshly brewed craft beer. The establishment is quite spacious with decent seating, but beyond that it seemed to be in doldrums. Although there were a host of service staff, none bothered to greet, usher or show a table. The staff seemed to be totally phased out and as it turned out, are absolutely raw hands without any training not only in the nuances of craft beer, but in general service as well. A waiter appeared after an agonizing wait of more than 10 minutes. On asking about varieties of beer offered, we were told that choice was limited to only one called “German Wizen”, which turned out to be a pale coloured wheat beer, rather flat with characteristic turbidity of wheat beer and which could do with a little more effervescence. The establishment serves only in portions of 250 or 500ml. There is no concept of serving by the pitcher.

The food menu had a long list of pan-asian, continental, Mexican offerings in addition to Indian items. However, when ordering for a starter, we were finally informed that choice was limited to two vegetarian and two non-vegetarian items. Our order of Chilly Baby Corn was served in due course and turned out to be reasonable by the pallet and outstanding in quantity served.

When the time came for a refill, I asked to repeat my drink. I was told that now my drink “German Wizen” was not available any more and I could have only “Scottish Ale”. On interlocution, I learnt that this establishment is able to serve only one variety at a time. Once the stock of a particular variety is fully consumed, they serve another variety. “Scottish Ale” turned out to be a dark coloured beer, bitter to taste with an overtly fruity after taste. The bitterness seemed to be synthetic, with its tendency to linger on, like taste of quinine. Not to my liking.

Finally when we sought to order for main course, we were told that only Chinese and Indian dishes were available. So when we proceeded to select as per this guide line, after a lot of negations to our choices, the admission was that we could choose any item from the menu as long as it was featuring in their buffet spread!

All the while there was cacophony of different music playing in high decibel in different areas of the same restaurant.

We decided to leave and complete our Sunday lunch elsewhere.

I wonder why someone would spend huge money to open an establishment like this and then allow it to be run so shoddily.

I came here today as it was a sunday and me n my fiance were dying to get a quiet drink together. The plan of visiting here was impromptu and I am glad I tried out this new place. Its very near to Axis Mall and inside the quiet DLF Galleria . The place has a charm to it that draws you close to the place. This was my first time in a brewry and I must say I loved the place.

It serves 3 boutique beers that are brewed in house. Unfortunately they were only serving one today. The Scottish Ale was a delight. It was light and had a nutty aftertaste to it , which was delicious. We also ordered the House special Chicken Wings . The wings deserve a special mention as I am yet to tast@e this good wings in the city. It was perfectly done and also the BBQ sauce was au extraordinaire.

The only damper to the whole mood was the unavailability of the other two live beers and some of the dishes that we ordered. But the great taste of chicken wings and the fresh brewed beer, made us forget of these short comings.

The microbrewery in town raised everyone's expectation.Located inside Dlf galleria mall in rajarhat ,the place is quite and cozy. We had a good hang-out with good food ,lots of different starters noorjahani tikka worth mentioning and others are also good . Scottish ale and German Weizen was the option of brewed beer ,personally I liked Scottish ale much but Weizen also quite good. The after taste of these brewed beer also very good. In food wok fried fish with bell pepper,triple x sauce russian burger was good and tasty. All in a all a good place to hang out with friends. Go and enjoy.

Amazing place with nice decor and relaxed seating layout! Service is prompt and no delays in any of the ordered items.

Food quality and taste is amazing! Had chicken wings and pasta penne, both were superb having different choice of sauces.

The place is mostly popular for its crafted beer! Belgian Wheat and Scottish Ale both are classic and perfectly brewed. We also tried the L.I.I.T pitcher, they serve it in a big jar and was an amazingly strong cocktail 🍸 

Overall pricing is slightly on the higher side (500ml of craft beer costs ₹199  taxes), but the ambiance, atmosphere, food, craft beers, and service are worth the price! Also, till 6 pm you get happy hours (buy one get one) on some beverages.

Suggest to reach this place early to avoid waiting time as it gets fairly crowded!  Would definitely visit it again; for me it's a place which can be visited regularly 😉

For a microbrewery it's terrible, they had only 1 craft beer available out of 3 and given that it tastes worse than Kingfisher lager, 400/liter is an extremely obscene price. Also, the Russian burger with xxx sauce is a specialty which was not available, just 3 veg and 3 non veg items were there to munch on.  No choice in craft beer, no choice of food, wonder what sets it apart then. Aah right, the lack of pulsating music ! 

Btw, having had actual Belgian blonde in Europe, the brewery is not so far off in the taste department though !

However, I'm gonna stick with Beer republic in the future. 
A definite No-No

Here I went with my friends on my bday...The first microbrewery in North Kolkata.It a perfect place to drink and hangout with friend for people near sector 5 and Newtown.The first thing that catches my eyes were the beer barrels ,it looks superb,trust me guyz..We ordered the Chef's veg and Non veg platter and it came out to be amazing.The chicken and meats were well good and taste great.
Just was little disappointed, as they didn't inform us about the Happy hour offers.

I was here with a friend from Guwahati and was very excited to take him around to a brewery in Kolkata. We dint face much problem in locating the place.The sitting arrangements were nice and the place was tidy with good soothing music. However they only had one beer which was live brewed and the rest available were bottle beer. Also as we reached the place at around 5 we were told that the kitchen was closed and will only open at 7 for which we could only order nachos which was okay in terms of taste and bad in terms of quantity. Also the service was ok with nothing great in it and the pricing is ok. I think the management needs to check on new innovative things so as to make the place more exciting anfd wanting to visit.
A one time visit judgement from me

Compete disaster. Should have read the reviews before going there all the way from Salt Lake. They have exactly three items on the menu: the fish, one salad, and the nachos. Oh, and ONE beer. Literally every other thing was unavailable.

Needs new management. They're nowhere close to being ready to open.

A microbrewery that serves exactly two beers, yes only two beers! One, an ale brewed there that was just about average and the other a bottle of Carlsberg. When inquired as to why there isn't anything else available, I am very knowledgeably informed that it takes 10 days to brew a beer! They probably didn't have enough time, is it? That aside, the entrance is through a dump with garbage and bottles in the passage leading to the place. Once inside though, the place isn't bad at all and the appetizers were good. The place has potential if they get their act right.

Went there on a Saturday evening at around 6pm. To start with waiters doesn't have a clue to whats going around. They ade all confused and took min 3 minutes to provide us seats.
Comming to food, none of the hoyse special beers were available. Neither were most of the dishes. Only nachos n stuff like that were available. Pretty disappointed we ldft the place.
Although the decor seems promising the inside is screwed. But i will give it another shot after some months.

As promised i gave another shot at the place. It had hugely improved from my last visit as the brewery was functional and they served good food.
All the foods and beverages were good with the mutton deserving a special mention as it was soft moist and had enough flavors.

A thumbs up for the huge improvement. Room for improvement on the service front.

Yakitori, spare ribs, country's favourite are a must try here. Out of the three craft beers available, German one is great, rest are pretty bad. Present scenario, they only serve Scottish Ale(worst of the lot) in the afternoon, & any two variants at night; kind-of giving customers no option to chose. A pretty bad strategy!!
Another disappointing fact is that the service is very bad. Hope for some improvements..

After reading a lot of positive reviews about this place I and my friend decided to visit this place yesterday. Was very disappointed. Ambiance of the place is good, good music playing in the background and free wifi is provided. We did not order any food so cannot say about the food, I had decide to visit the place after seeing that this place has HAPPY HOUR. But we got to know that most items on the menu are not included in the Happy Hour offer, to be honest very few basic spirits were eligible for Happy Hour offer, No cocktails in happy hours. First we tried  ABSOLUT VODKA with sprite, they forgot to give had to request to give ice, second cocktail i tried was "Long Island Tea" it was good. The waiters were very unprofessional no one had any idea what all drinks are eligible for Happy Hour offer.

The new kid in the town – Country Roads – The first microbrewery in North Kolkata!!

The place got opened for people few months back however the live brewery was still not operational. In very recent time they have started the “Live Beer” – which gonna be the USP of this place as in North Kolkata side, we hardly have any place with live beer so for people who are afraid of beer belly due to the glycerin and other fatty particles of beer, can get a sigh of relief.

We dropped in here around 6:00 PM last evening. The place is located inside “The Galleria” which is just opposite to New town Axis mall. While entering inside the mall, I felt like I am going inside the Axis mall around 7 years back – An entire empty mall where if you shout it sounds you back!! However, the Country roads is at the 2nd floor of the mall and we took the escalator. And when we entered inside, it was a complete opposite story – A totally packed up area where hardly a table is available. The interior decoration is real raw with all types of sitting arrangements starting from comfy sofa to high chairs.

We somehow managed a small table with high-chairs and ordered the first brewed beer . In the menu card, there were 3 choices - German Weizen, Belgium Blond and Scottish Ale but only the Belgium Blond was available. We ordered 2 glasses of 500 ml for each 3 of us. Definitely the after taste of the beer was awesome – a different never- before kind of flavor resides in your mouth for some moment which is the essence of this brewed beer. This was followed by House special chicken wings and Wok Fried Fish with Bell pepper and one cashew nut masala. All the items were really impeccable in their own way. Special mention is the chicken wings – Commendable product!!

We also took few tequila shots after this, though very expensive but were going nice with the flow. Overall, if the expense is considered as out of discussion, this place is worth visit thousand times.
Interior – 4/5
Food – 4.5/5
Staff Behaviour – 4.5/5

P.S. I again dropped in here this evening with my wife and kiddo...Only German Weizen was available but that was not as good as belgium blond. In starters we took the Hot oak fish, mozzarella stick and yatukuri. Both these items were nice. But the reason I am re-editing my review is something else. Just after they server our first pair of beer glasses, for some collission with her handbag, one beer glass fell on the table, completely broken into pieces, the entire beer was scattered. We both were kind of very disappointed and feeling sorry. But the stuffs were so so friendly that they didn't even say a single thing. Just requested us to take the sofa beside, cleaned the place and to our astonishment DID NOT CHARGE A SINGLE PENNY NEITHER FOR THE GLASS OR THE BEER AND PUT A NEW FULL GLASS ON OUR TABLE.....we were totally flabbergasted, now a days this kind of hospitality is really very rare.....
Again my nest wishes for them!!

Country roads located at New Town, Rajarhat is a nice joint mainly attracting people for freshly brewed beer. The place is strategically located. Ihad gone there on the weekend with my friends to hang out. We had tasted couple variants of carft beer. We liked the raste of german wit beer when compared wth the ale variant.
Food were pretty good. Enjoyed the ambience too.

One of the very few micro brewery in town who brews its own beer. Although they have launched only one choice yet... it has all the capability of growing into a hub. Located at a very convenient location in the IT city of kolkata, the place will be booming. The food quality is top notch and pricing though a bit on the higher side is quite reasonable enough.

The best thing is the support of the staffs. They are fast at giving you your orders. Next is the beer. Out of 3 kinds only one is available. But it's nice. Food is tasty. 

Though tasty, food is costly. Way too costly. As a result one has to pay hefty tax. Ambience can be much better. The making of beer is shown in cylinders under tube light, these lights just damages the ambience. 

Location is nice. Food cost must reduce considering the ambience.

Really had high expectations from this place after going through the reviews and all. I quite liked the place and ambience. Food was good too. We had ordered for a signature dish named jalapeño cutlet which had fillings of cheese,rice,oregano and chilli flakes and was really well prepared. Along with it they had given salsa sauce which was good too.
Tried some cocktails which was decent enough. However, I'm really disappointed with this place as they had charged extra 500 bucks just coz one of my friend had puked in the washroom coz she was feeling a lil unwell. Freaking 500 after giving them all sorts of service tax n shit. Really unexpected and disappointing. Would never feel like visiting after such hospitality from their end. Main motive of any café should be hospitality and service which may b lacked in this case for obvious reasons.

It is essentially a pub with a small microbrewery. The interior is nice but when I visited it was not fully done. Staffs are well-manared and well-informed. The food is good. In fact the grilled chicken we ordered was cooked to perfection. Price wise this place is reasonable. Only thing is their service is slow. This an area they should improve and I won't mind to give them a 4 rating

It's a very okay place. Since it's a microbrewery , the beer is light and frothy. I really liked it. The food is not that good. It was pretty oily and we had to constantly drain it on tissue paper before eating it. We had the corn fritters, mozzarella sticks and jalapeño rice and cheese type of cutlet which was deep fried. We ordered nachos too where the salsa was good but the nacho chips didn't seem good. They were soft and soggy too. We also ordered a kiwi fruit drink which was good. Overall an okay experience.

A new addition to the drinking holes in town,  country roads lives up to its name in its rustic decor and the feel of raw energy that the place exudes. The first microbrewery in the township,  it serves decent good beer and its Scottish ale is my favourite.  However,  if you want some good bites,  then you will be disappointed as the food is not even okay. ..it is borderline bad. Special word on the nachos which were doughy and not crisp at all. But in all,  good place to try out if you want a cold one after a hot day.

Good ambience.
Famous because it's one of the few microbreweries in kolkata. And quite close to our place of stay. Have to admit though, given it's interior location inside jagdish store in new town, it's quite crowded, even during the weekdays. The food is good. Live screening of matches, so a nice hangout place for the sport buffs. The apple flavoured beer is especially great.

Nice place overall.

Located at DLF Galleria opposite to Axis Mall, Rajarhat.

Waiting time on a Saturday evening is around 30-45 mins.

Ambience is great. Service is good.
USP: Craft Beer. Decent taste. There's room for improvement though.

Food is standard. Portion sizes are good.

We ordered:

Orange Virgin Mohito : 3/5.

Craft Beer : 3.5/5.

House Special Wings : 3/5.

Wok Fried Fish with Bell pepper : 4.5/5.

Yakitori: 4/5.

Loved the bar counter! 

Overall, worth a visit.

This micro brewery is located inside a desolate mall at a far flung location from the city close to the so called IT town of Calcutta. Went there with some old friends from the city and was pleasantly surprised. The decor and ambience was very nice. They have three brews of beers and I tried them all. The Scottish ale was my favorite. Ordered a few burgers and some finger food and it was not bad. But the quality of the service was a bummer. The servers were not trained and friendly as one would expect in a pub and did not understand English well. It took more than an hour to get our food. However, compared to the ambience and quality the prices were really cheap, then again it is Calcutta. Totally recommended if you don't mind driving a few kilometers away from the main city.

Brewery is still one of a kind thing in Kolkata... N being one of the first ones... This place is attracting a lot f people... 
Nice ambience with a view of the barrels around...although only one type beer , German Weizen was available, which tasted good.Amongst cocktails The Jimmies Jar was awsumm...
Food was good too, we ordered 3 plates of Yakitori which served good for 7 f us.For mains ordered chicken stroganoff that tasted good too.
Overall the experience was good but service was v slow.They need to work on the service part.
The place is new,a little disorganised but hopefully will come up well wid time,adding varieties f beer to have the name brewery justified...and then would start having a greater footfall.

The first microbrewery in the city dragged lots of attention of beer lovers. They call it craft beer which lacks too much fizz and glycerin. Hence even people who don't like beers are also enjoying sipping chilled fresh brewed beer. One wont feel heavy at all like bottle beers. Getting space to stand on evening weekdays or weekend is a challenge.
Three varieties of available fresh brewed beers are German Weizen, Belgium Blond and Scottish Ale. Each one of them has one of its unique characteristics leaves a wonderful after taste on each sip. Raw materials are imported from round the world. However the downside is all three varieties are not always available. The Rosogolla Shot is the next best thing can happen here, served topped with brandy flamed with torch.

Now coming to food can't be ignored too. Some notable dishes are House Special Chicken Nachos, Triple X Sauce Russian Burger, Yakitori, WoK Fried Fish with Bell Pepper, Fukien Fish in Ginger Sauce, Noorjahani Tikka and Nasi Goreng. But the winner dish is House Special Chicken Wings with Tangy Garlic Sauce goes perfectly with chilled beer.

Please note lunch buffet has been stopped since a while. Price is of course on a higher side but quality comes with a cost. Servers are clueless when too much footfall at a same time.

Firstly being a Beer lover.... the beer they make is pretty awesome.....But only a single flavour available....'The Blonde Ale', Ambience is cool..... Now coming to Food... Food is not as expected..... Even though they have it on the menu but they don't have it in the kitchen. First experience was pretty awful..... Hoping for changes. Before commenting about it in my food Blog, would visit again and rate it.
Would love to try the 'Scotch Ale' next time.

Why 4.5 and not 5? Simply because of the shortage of the freshly brewed beers. I could only taste Belgian Blonde. The micro brewery does not suffice the huge demand and therefore if you reach there at 7 in the evening, you may or may not be able to taste their signature brews!!!.

But the staff, especially Abhijit are extremely cordial and helpful. The food is tastes better than lots of other pubs/bars in the city and the signature cocktails are smashing and awesome. GET THE ROADER !!!!!

All in all a fun place to hang out in the weekend with buddies who can seriously gulp and the pocket pinch is very basic and moderate. 2 Thumbs Up to Country Roads. Just get us the beers please..........

Another microbrewary in town and hence the visit. This particular place is situated inside the newly constructed DLF Galleria opposite to the Axis Mall at rajarhat. After we arrived we had to wait for around 30 mins to get a table and this gives an idea about the kind of rush they handle. The place has a typical English pub kind of a decor with plush couch and bar stools. They have a decent sized bar counter and you can take a seat there if you wish to. 

Now coming to their food. VERY IMPRESSIVE. At first we ordered for a portion of BBQ Mutton Ribs. Though they could improve upon the quantity of meat but the red sauce used for tossing the ribs was amazing. A very nice mixture of tangy and sweet. Even the mutton was very soft. Then came the Wok Fried Fish with Bell Peppers. The best dish of the night. Small pieces of fish were served which was equally crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. A dry item which gels best with the beer. Then we ordered for their Chicken Wings. This particular item sells like hot cake out here and after tasting i could understand why. Apart from the succulent chicken wings the sauce had the spiciness and the tiny garlic pieces was a treat to the taste buds. The Masala Papad Tokri was disappointing though. The quantity of toppings is something that could be worked upon in terms of flavour and quantity. 

The Microbrewary is functional but sadly they had only one variety available which is the Belgian Blonde. The beer had a subtle aftertaste after every gulp which is impressive but still after having tasted a lot of crafted beer across the country i must say they have a lot to improve in their quest to satisfy the thirst. 

Service is something which is their highlight. Inspite of the rush,  the servers were prompt and attentive. They had idea about the dishes and if need arises they were ready with their suggestions. 

I could have given an extra 0.5 but the loudness of the music and the non availability of the beers have to bear some consequences. 

PS - They have their own Wifi and cheers to the management for having this facility.

Even though they have only started brewing one flavour of beer-belgian ,its still worth a try.I would also suggest to go for the noorjahan tikka,the chicken wings,chilli babycorn and chilli paneer were all prepared from the same sauce and its very difficult to rate that way.The ambience is a set back,music gives the esence to any pub,and it that respect it is poor.The decor is good especially the view of the fermentation tanks.Worth a visit.

Great place close to house. Gives me a proper feeling of English pubs which I have been missing since I left UK. Kebabs are quite good but sadly in house beers are a let down . Would love to try the apple -pear flavoured beer . I have been missing kopperberg for quite sometime would love to see if it meets the expectation of Kopperberg . Price is pocket friendly . I would give 8/10. Good job guys!

Negative side-Service has to be improved . Waiters need to take a good note on what customers are ordering!

I went to this place just to check out the microbrewery of the town. First day and the experience wasn't that good. The taste of the beer is too sour and the alcohol percentage is is low I.e 4.5. % so anybody who is looking for a strong beer might not like it.
The food on the other hand was good. They could have done better with setting up the mood. Well they don't have competition in the town but if they want to stay then they must need to up the ante. 
The main concern for many will be how much it affect your pocket. Well, it's pretty affordable .
Yes the biggest drawback I found was the unavailability of a pitcher. My only suggestion will be to add a pitcher to your menu. That will just do the trick.
All in all abover average. 
Rating : 3.5/5

I can come back here for the mutton ribs. Awsmmm.. though i was dissapointed with the brewed drink ( since ths s also a microbrewery) but the food decor ambiance made up for it. One more place for kolkatans especially sec5 guys to hangout.nd best part is that the place s never overcrowded..

Went for my b'day lunch. The place has an american feel to it. Its more like a lounge. Good yet simple decor. Bright and rusty colour combo. Seating arrangements pretty comfortable. 
Food is quality..quantity is not bad. 
THERE IS NO BUFFET NOW.
Price: Pocket pinch not much. 
Cant comment on...

This place is best for dates. The decor is good enough and the microbrewery looks cool.
They need to put more stuffs on their menu and i think it's quite over expensive as the restaurant is new!
The starters need to get more better in terms of quantity & quality both!
You can always try their pasta! 
Don't go for their desserts as they are horrible.

Been here on 20May16, had a 30-45mins waiting because of the fact that this is the second microbrewery in Kolkata and most of the people in Action Area 1 and 3 have no where else to booze. Rates are decent but the in-house beers are a let down. On a Friday evening the place was running out of stock of in house brews. Only Scottish Ale and an experimental "Mango" flavoured beer was available. Scottish Ale was ok, but had a strange stink I haven't come across in Kolkata microbrewery or even in most Bangalore breweries. That too ran out after 2X500ml was served. On a Friday evening, this was unacceptable! Finger food was good, tasty and easy on the stomach. Full marks for the food but guys if you wanna be a true blue microbrewery, time to pull up your socks!

I read about this place in t2, saved it for an early visit. I had called up for a reservation on my hubbys bday, but they refused cos they followed 1st come 1st serve. After visiting I realised, being so crowded it's ok not to take reservations.

Location: In a place which badly needed such a joint. 👍🏻

Ambience: it has a proper pub kinda feel, great simple interiors. Best thing is you can see the brewery plant through the glass section. Washroom was very dirty, guys you really need to work on your hygiene part. Smoke Room too small without proper ventilation.

Ordered:
Mozzarella stick Hot Dogs- it was served along with two potato wedges. The wedges were crispy from outside with herbs and spices, wish they served more😋
The hot dog was too good, the patty, the sauce, quite like burger but do try it.
Garlic Naan and Paneer Gulabari: Naan was okay. Paneer Gulabari was our waiters recommendation, twas good, different dish but the the paneer balls were very hard. They needed to be softer or submerged for a longer time in the gravy.

Drinks: We wanted to try all the freshly brewed beers, but sadly out of the three beers they brew, only one was available. A brewery is supposed to have enough stock of its beers, sadly I had heard this complaint from my friends too, I also ended up experiencing the same. We got Belgium Blonde, which was fresh and had a very nice after taste. The best part about breweries, you don't get such beers elsewhere. I wish we could try the other ones.

Pocket Pinch: Really cheap, One of the best thing about this place is its price, very affordable.

Service: The waiters need to be more prompt and active. 
A Special mention of Mr. Abhijit Chakraborty, manager of the place, extremely warm and welcoming person. He made sure we were well attended to and that service and food were fine.
He is a real asset to the restaurant.
We were also given a dessert as complimentary dish. I always love such gesture thank you guys.

P.S- This meal was complimentary from Zomato, thanx to Miss Samridhi for sending in the complimentary meal offer. Love to review and glad to make a contribution.

Microbrewery restaurants are rare in this city and this is one such place to hang out. I went there with my friends to try out locally brewed beer. Three of us ordered 3 glasses of Scottish Alle (500ml). Let me tell you people it was awesome. 
We ordered few starters as well- House special chicken nachos, Chicken Yakitori, Laziz tangri and Chicken Noorjahani tikka. 
Out of these, Laziz tangri was the best. It had 3 stuffed chicken leg pieces served with green chutney. Nachos dissapointed us as the chips were not at all upto the mark. It lacked the crispiness. Yakitori was average but Noorjahani was way better. 

The interior is really well decorated and is quite different from the traditional pubs. The brewery plant could be seen from inside which added an extra dimension to their decor. 
Service and hospitality is also worth mentioning.

A pathetic experience! From dirty cutlery to horrible service to bad food and unavailability of beer. Being a brewery having just one out all the mentioned beer in the menu is not justified. This was where our bad experience started. The server assigned to our table could not be more restless, a person who did not have the patience to stand and take an order. He had to be called thrice for an order. An attitude which was hard to tolerate. I wanted a nine hills wine which was not available again so I settled for a Sula. If availability is such an issue why do you stack up ur menu cards? My friend settled for the only beer available, he liked his beer though. We called for a veg trotta, the tomato sauce at the base was extremely sweet and sour(like a tomato chutney), on complaining the bearer said it was supposed to be like this. He got us a paneer kebab then, it smelled burned, horribly prepared I have never tasted such bad tikkas anywhere. My plate was dirty and had to be changed. The guy serving us was to callous. After such a horrible experience they say they don't have a feedback form. We settled our bills and were about to leave. When we came across me.abhijit an extremely warm person, who listened to our issues and apologised. His humble behaviour was what saved the evening. Maybe he's just one good point the place boasts of. Buck up team country roads to get going in the long run. Very disappointed. I would give them lower ratings! It was just for mr.abhijit they got rated better than what they expect.

Have been here couple of times!!
Earlier they did not start brewing, but recently they have started serving brewed beer. But there are only three varieties you can choose from, and if it's a Friday, or weekends there are chances to have even lesser varieties. The location is also very easy to find. It is inside Dlf Galleria, which is near to pride hotel/ hometown.
The food is too good!! The brewed beer tastes good. Recently, this place is getting over crowded. If it's a Friday or weekends you need to wait for at least 30-45 mins to get a seat. What I have noticed is they have very few tables for 2 people. Mostly seating arrangements are like where a group of 4-5 people can sit. Loved the ambiance though. Interiors are also very well. 
Service is also very quick.
A 500 ml of brewed beer costs you ₹199 and a 250 ml costs ₹129. 
My suggestion would be to visit this place on a weekday (excluding Friday) and visit in between 12-6 coz they have their happy hour (buy one get one free) during that time (not on brewed beer).

went to country roads yesterday to check out what was all this fuss about being a microbrewery. A journalist friend had visited recently and held them in high esteem
one thing that I may say is if this is an experiment, in that case it has really paid of well becoz the beer is of superb quality. only one flavour was available which was a bit disappointing but I was told that the demand for freshly brewed beer is huge and hence the demand-supply gap. for food I had russian burger wid sauce becoz i m not much of a foodie, all that i wanted was d drink and the drink was excellent.
I recommend Country Roads to all people who thinks of beer as serious business....and that a pint of beer can help people unwind.

special thanks to the country roads management for such conceptualisation and welcoming hospitality...and for a brew par excellance..5/5 for an evening well spent.

Me and my 5 friends went country roads Saturday at 5 pm. We were expecting a very good reception there but alas we were welcomed with "we don't have the head chef today so no food till 7 pm and a non availability of in house beers".
The staff behavior was poor in quality and answerability.

This 2.5 Rating is only for the Brew that they are selling. Had it been a regular Bar/Restaurant I would have given it a 3.5. The decor is nice, the staff & the Manager are polite, the AC is under par, the food is okay. That brings us to the Beer.

3 different Ales available on the tap and by 8pm 2 of them were over. I only had the opportunity to try the German ale & the Scottish ale both of which lacked spunk. They were brewed beer that did not have anything to write home about. Neither of the beer had a foam head which is important to restrict the carbonation bubbles. The smell and taste to both were extremely mild & a bit fruity. I was expecting the Scottish Ale to be a little hoppy but it was disappointing. They also lacked a stout which I would have liked to try at a microbrewery. I am a beer person and I like my beer to  give me a kick which was lacking in both these ales. They are more like fermented juices than beer.
I hope they get better at Brewing and increase the number of Fermentation tanks. I will go back after a year to try them again.

Visited on 14th May!

The plan was for Beer Republic, but due to their un-understood cover charge, I looked for some other place nearby, that's how accidentally I came across The Country Roads. To my surprise and inadequate knowledge, the place was a Microbrewery! I couldn't have had a better substitute.

Location : In Newtown, in the Galleria Mall, 2nd Floor, opposite Hotel Novotel. I had a tough time reaching this place inside the mall. Therefore, I advice you to ask the gatekeeper for directions!

Interiors and Service : The place has amazing interiors. Good music. Decent crowd. And comfortable seating.
The staff was attentive, cordial and friendly, even after being so crowded and hectic for them. Service was quick! Plus one!

Food and Beer : There are three kinds of beer that they offer, but we just had the option of one as the other two weren't available. It was called German Beer! It was high in taste. We really liked it.
For food, we ordered crispy babycorn. It came in an unusual way. In toothpicks and with tomato ketchup. We didn't mind it as it was good in taste.

Pocket pinch : 500ml (one glass) for ₹199. The Chilly Baby Corn was for ₹229. Decent rates.

WiFi, unbelievably, available!

I recommend this place, at least once, for those who stay far off and travelling is inconvenient. And to the rest..if it's beer time, it is The Country Roads!🍻

We live so near and never came to this amazing place.so today we thought of trying the food here . The time we entered I liked the ambience . So we ordered one strawberry bacardi mojito and one Russian choice cocktails .and then we started with Yakitori which is a chicken preparation with teriyaki sauce . Loved Yakitori and specially the strawberry mojito. Then we ordered cracking Mozzarella Jalapeno and chicken stroganoff which was seamlessly good. Mozzarella jalapeno was so so I would say . I asked for more spicy sauce for Jalapeno but they never gave me. I guessed they didn't understand. But anyways overall experience was good here and would like to come here again.

last wesdnesday we were in kolkata to see of my brother who is pursuing his resident training in gynaecology from vellore...one of our cousin insisted on visiting this new place near hometown..when we heard that we can see beer being brewed we felt intrigued. i felt that the concept is awesome...fresh beer as opposed to bottled varieties... I dont understand why people would visit such a place and ask for bottled beer:) we ordered chilly baby corn finger....amazingly the fingers had almost no oil....cooked in a very healthy style. we had ordered belgian blonde....the brew was mind boggling....it had a fruity aftertaste....the interior furnishing is very appropriate...and the staff at the microbrewery cum restaurant were very polite and accomodating.....it was an afternoon well spent...

thank you guyz...will be back sometym soon :)

The signage says "Come for the beer, stay for the food." I say, go for neither and be saved! 

The microbrewery boasting of their own unique flavours has only 2 of the flavours available as mentioned on the menu. The food is a different story altogether. Food we ordered was not very fancy - an orange mojito, a basic penne aglio olio, a westboat burger, chicken noodles and and ice cream sandwich. 

The penne aglio olio was oily to say the least and maybe a creation of the chef since I was not aware that crispy babycorn is a part of the recipe of an penne aglio olio (which is anyway not supposed to have vegetables but I have made my peace with that). Hands down, possibly the worst version of pasta I have ever had! 

The westboat burger ordered by my husband was on another league. It was a six inch sub sandwich (not a burger) with the bread generously laden with butter and no butter paper or protective covering given. How is one supposed to have this sandwich without getting hands oily with every bite is beyond me? 

The generous helping of chicken noodles did nothing to save the disaster of the food had before and the less about it said is better.

The icing on the cake was however the "Ice Cream Sandwich" - a Country Roads special creation. I must say it takes immense amount of guts for a chef to plate and present 2 scoops of icecream served in between jam filled burger buns! Really...that is not a creation, it is an amateur effort to do something different which didnt pay off. I didnt realise I was ordering a literal translation of ice cream sandwich. Bad is an understatement for the experience we had. 

The only and only one saving grace was the Orange mojito which was refreshing and quite tasty with the right amount of tangy zest to give that added punch! The mojito is the reason I have given a rating of 2. My rating - Can Avoid.

Finally we seem to be having more option in the area around Axis Mall. And this one is different given that Kolkata does not have many breweries. Must admit that I was surprised to see that the place was almost full  even on a Thursday night. Beer was good. Although it was disappointing that they did not have any option - only one variant was available and the others were not. Music was loud and good (my favourite nos were being played). Food could have been a lot better. Overall it is definitely worth a visit.

A little piece of heaven for the Beer loving IT Sector crowd....it was a Wednesday when we decided to give it a try, but the place was full...the manager was very courteous and managed a place for us in the bar counter...started with a German Weisen...followed by a Scottish Ale and Rosogolla shots. The German Weisen was better than I expected...and so was it's aftertaste...the Scottish Ale was a bit strong and spicy....They ran out off stock on the Belgian Blonde, or I would have tried that too... We also ordered BBQ spare Ribs and Tandoori Aloo Khusnama....Needless to say, Kolkata was really lagging behind in the brewery culture, but after Raize The Bar and Country Roads, the Beer lovers have something to cheer about....

One of the few microbrewery available in the city as of now. I went there yesterday with my friends. 

Pros: Good Food. It can be way much better. We loved their Mozzarella Sticks and Veg Platter. Courteous Staff. Nice Ambience and Good Music. 

Cons: Beer. Not at all good. I have been to many breweries all over the world .. Their brew was just off the mark for me .. For Starters they have only 3 flavours - Scottish Ale, German Wieze and Belgium Blonde. They didn't have belgium blonde, so we tried the other two and we didn't like it much either. So if they can set their brew straight then they are golden. 

Overall a nice experience. Would love to visit them again if they introduce new flavours.

After a long wait Kolkata gets its microbrewery . Cool indeed. I tried to go their with my wife on a Friday evening and found the queue is too long and hence came back. After that I got a chance to visit there during afternoon hours and did not miss the opportunity. The place is nice and interior is not too jazzy or classy. You can see the brewing units beside which on of the attractions I believe. 
Coming to the food and drink experience , the place was literally vacant at the point when I went there (which is quite obvious) and only german wheat beer was available as the brewing units was going under routine maintenance to serve during the evenings (quite understandable ) . I have ordered German beer and spar ribs (mutton) first and then oak fried fish with red wine sauce and Irish ale beer. The german beer was nice and malt was fresh I believe, how ever I did not like the irish ale after that. Mutton ribs were soft and good in taste. the fish preparation could have been better i.e i wished to see those more soft.

Overall a good place in the town and pocket friendly. I wish to visit there again and want to taste belgian  variety next time.

Note : 12 to 6 (except weekends) are happy hours, but happy hours are not applicable to the drinks from microbrewery .

Went to this place last weekend, located near Pride Hotel inside Galleria Mall. The overall experience was good but not a great one.

Good: The interiors, the feel of freshly brewed beer, courteous staff.

Bad: The taste of the beer (needs load of improvement), the food is not up to the mark, the music is a bit sad. 

Overall: May be a one time visit since it's one of the limited microbreweries in the city, but definitely not a place to be made a regular hangout.

I went to this place yesterday as I was excited about microbrewery in Calcutta as there are only a couple of them but the whole experience was quite disappointing.
The good
- The person at the door, Abhijeet, was very courteous and welcoming
- It is a microbrewery, so one can get good flavours and fresh beer
- Reasonable menu prices

The bad
- Service was very poor. The service staff does not care that the customers are present and they need to serve them
- We were served food but without cutlery and plates
- They charged my card but did not present the bill

I will really have second thoughts about going to this place again

We visited the place after getting so many positive reviews. It was the most pathetic sunday lunch we ever had. They should stop making non veg food immediately, we have ordered non veg platter nd mutton ribs nd barrah baluchi, nothing was upto the mark. The chicken nuggets tasted like chilly chicken balls before getting into gravy. And precisely they should never make nachos on their own (use the store bought ones), it was filled with oil. Chicken Nachos was only boiled chicken pieces trying hard to hang out with desi salsa without cheese. Never had nachos without cheese ever. The only savior was mozzarella sticks deep fried. Nd the drinks like Jimmy in jars. So they should brew their beer nd only keep veg foods on their menu.

My visit was good. The drink price is economical. The food was great. I liked a kebab so much, took some for my parents home. Good ambiance, very courteous staff. Nice music, relaxing atmosphere.

Will visit again to try their beer.

Located at the galleria mall, Newtown ( beside Pride hotel) , this new sports bar hits the right notes on food, ambience and service. 
Great choice of appetizers to go with alcohol. Chicken wings come with choice of 3 sauces. We tried the barbecue option and liked it. The wok fried fish with bell peppers had the right amount of soya sauce and maintained the crispness on top while being succulent inside. The  "murg nafeez" provided an exotic fusion of chicken kebab with a melt in the mouth cheesy sauce. A must try. The only negative was the Mutton dish, "barrah baluchi". The meat was undercooked and the portion was too small (just 2 moderate sized ribs) for tbe price (399 without tax). But, a word of applause on the part of the service team. They replaced the dish with dry chilli chicken, on the house!
Now, coming to alcohol. There were only 2 option of foreign beer available, Carlsberg and Tuborg. This is think may be a deterrent for the beer lovers , till the microbrewery becomes functional.
***Note: The microbrewery had not opened when I had visited the place on 29th April. They said it will open in a month's time ****

This is a pub a place u can catch up with frnds and family 

Deco: very pleasing with both high stools and low couches ... Nice light and music and plenty of giant screens

Drinks : they have not started brewing yet but the drinks r rsnbly priced and cocktails were good

Food : was okay though portions were small , had teriyaki chkn and pan fried fish 

They don,t have fish finger !!!!

Service: though the stuff were friendly they need to improve a lot in this dept 

Will go back once they start brewing and if the brew is good .. Count me in as a regular

Yes you heard it correct they brew their own beer.
They also offer good quality mocktail and cocktails. They also offer different varieties of Mexican and Indian food. The pricing was pretty affordable. happy hour 12 to 6. Ambience of the hotel is pretty cool.
But the location of this restaurant is not that accessible.

I was absolutely pleased to enter this place after a long day at work. The cocktails we ordered(Jimmies Jar pitcher & Long Island Ice tea pitcher) were great.  However I did not finf the food along with the amount was not up to mark as expected. But it was a good value for money.

We are total 8 people and we are writing this review one by one:
1)The Chicken Yakitori was as tougher than Rhino Skin. Well, the Indian army could use the cooks talent to make bulletproof vests.
2) The Crackling Mozzarella Jalapeno was straight out of a Kanti Shah movie. Yes, it was that horrendous. You could imagine what the folks during the great depression were going through. I pass. I cannot write anymore.

3)microbrewery was not operational. Also food sucked big time. Everything we ordered
 sucked. Veg non veg, seeks, fried, baked. Worst food ever. I will have maggi at home.

4) Dear chef kindly take my suggestion and stop killing happy people on a Friday night with your sucking food. Please take a break from your current profession and try to learn first.
5) Really below average. I covered like miles of distance to reach here only to be disappointed by the food. Nice packaging(set up), need to improve on content(food).
6) life is unfair but the food here is the most unfair of all.  Didn't expect it to be so yuck. 
7) I was so excited for the brewery but alas! Its just for the show,I being a hard core non veg,skipped all the non veg food coz I can't take it anymore.
8) the only thing good here is sealed beer by Carlsberg, everything else is a big disaster. And for vegetarian, God save us :)

This is located in the 2nd floor of Galleria Mall, Rajarhaat beside Pride Hotel.

The first thing that will catch your attention is the big red board with its namesake.
To speak about the interior and decor you would find similarity with Chillis and TGIF but they have their uniqueness. The large Brewery which is yet to be functional will catch your attention. 2-3 LCDs are their for you to enjoy TV while you eat and also they have a open space with couch if you have come in a group.

Cant talk about efficiency of the staffs much as we were the only customers at that time and they did ok to serve us

We ordered

Wok Fried Fish with Bell Pepper - This is spicy fried fish, tastes good and we tried it on their recommendations and which i must say was a good one.
Nasi Goreng Prawn - Indonesian Fried Rice. Spicy again served with a omelette on top of it and Prawn gravy. You also have the option of Chicken.
Mee Goreng - Malaysian Noodles served with chicken.
Orange Virgin Mojito - If you want to try mocktail, you can opt for this one.

2nd Visit:
The Red Lips - Apple Juice with Strawberry flavour - Too sweet for my taste
The Mango Twist - This one is good
Chef's Non Veg Platter - Comprises of Oriental Nuggets, Chicken Wings & BBQ Mutton Ribs - Wings and gravy of the Ribs are a highlight
Nasi Goreng Chicken - Last time had prawn, had chicken this time.

This place is just fantastic. The setup and the ambience is really nice. They have put up a well thought menu. Right from the appetizers to the dessert, the food was really good. Chicken wings in tangy garlic sauce was one of the best appetizers I had in a while. The West coast burger boat and the chicken stroganoff met the expectations that the chicken wings had raised. All preparations and presentation of food was really appealing.
It shouldn't go unmentioned that they had really good service. 
 I just hope next time when I visit, I get to taste the recommended Russian Burger with Triple X sauce.

Frankly I was not expecting what i saw today. Most themed restaurants in the city sticks to celebrating festivals which matches with their theme, but Country Roads have gambled in a big way today. as far as i am concerned the results have been very good. I had the pleasure of the Nabobarsha special menu today.....all bangaliana packed in...
starters was Panchphoron murgi kabab, followed by kaju kismis pulao, chholar dal and gondhoraj betki paturi. The food was lightly cooked and spices were proper too. kababs were soft. for dessert we had malpoa.....soft and sweet.....finishing it off with the creamy mango twist....
The staff is well groomed....and the prices dont pinch the pocket.
a superb way to begin the year...affordable luxury, is what my father said...thank u country roads for the food fiesta.

a sumptuous feast at great prices. Yesterday we had a blast at country roads. now this is my third visit to this place... and i have never been disappointed. 
First things first.....the location is accessible. Lots of parking place if u are on ur own vehicle, if not then taxi aggregrators can track u easily.....hometown is the nearest landmark. once the galleria mall opens fully i think Country roads will be the talk of the town.
the place is calm and serene...and you can sit and enjoy with your friends or family. now for the hospitality; the staff did treat us royally,everytime, taking special pride in serving quality food. i never had to wait long for the orders.
the menu cards are a innovation in themselves..as is the internal decoration...the microbrewing machines are in open view, and the lighting is catchy but does not hurt the eyes. A soothing view all around. 
The menu offers a wide variety of mouth-watering dishes. Yesterday we tried the Indian buffet. Veg Amritshai seekh, Tandoori aloo, dal tadka, Zafrani murg, Roghni Nun. If u are a vegetarian and u r in country roads, never miss the dal tadka....by now i know that it is the chef's special skill. 
We topped it all up with attractive looking drinks Cosmopolitan for myself and Kiwi's group and Orange Virjin Mojito for my wife and sister in law.
A special mention of the music...awesome selection.
I had a pleasant dining experience with food of the most exquisite flavours. For this reason I highly recommend the Country Roads to all food lovers.

First of all. I have read through most of their review, I think most of them are fake and are written by the management themselves. ( its my opinion)

Now coming to the place:
Location of the place is odd. Its get scary specially if your looking for a late dinner.

Ambiance is nice. Good interiors. What makes a bar lively is the people!! but this place was deserted, only one table occupied though it was a Friday night.

Coming to the menu, I find it full of Indian cuisine and not much of continental. As a bar I expect some European dishes which were missing. Names are fancy but no new fusion. I didn't see use of any special cheese or exclusive ingredients In the description.

Staff is okay. You always feel awkward when you're the only one sitting in the restaurant. They really need to attract more people

We ordered a stater, pasta, one more main course and a desert. 3 beer and a Moctail.

Food taste was just not up to the mark. Comparing it with any other Bar in the city food was really below average. I don't know what's went wrong but none of the dish was finger licking.

Brewery not yet started so its a big set back too
Overall it was a disappointing experience. Only suggestion would be to work on their menu and add some interesting dish.

With 2-3 more Micro brewery coming up in Kolkata I think it would be tough for them to sustain in long term.@raghav sharma

Situated at 2nd floor of DLF Galleria near to Pride Hotel is Country Roads, the first microbrewery of the town. The ambience is very nice and its not crowded at all as many people are not aware of it. The staffs are very courteous and the waiting time is less also. In the evening, the feel of the place is just awesome.,with good music and food. The starters are good, though main course needs some improvement. Price is moderate so it doesnot burn a hole in your pocket. Definitely should try out this place.Nice hangout place for a group of friends or a couple to have dinner..Happy Dining

During the last weekend of February, I along with some mates from my college days decided upon a reunion in Kolkata. We selected Country Roads because we thought that the place would be a calm and quiet one. Contrary to our expectations when we arrived, we found the place to be quite full and had to wait for our turn. And I must say that the wait was worth it. We had a great time. We ordered Chi Nachos and beer..Since the microbrewery was yet to start then, we had bottle beer. There were 3 girls in our group, They ordered Long Island Iced tea as was suggested by the bar incharge....it was served in pitchers...which has a very classy appeal.the nachos were crunchy with lots of cheese, and tasted very good. 
all in all it was a wonderful evening and many thanks to you guys. i will be looking forward to a whole course dinner at Country roads

The ambience of the place is perfect for spending some quality time with your loved one or friends. The courteous staff, the microbrewery, the well though and modified starters demand to be noticed. The cocktails are above average but nothing out of the box. The minus point were the indian main course, otherwise it's a thumbs up for Chinese and continental. However, my review is from the point of view of a vegetarian. Non vegetarians should find the food better.

Dear Country Roads!! I would like to thank you for making my weekend! it was a satisfactory experience to visit the new restaurant. A hidden, peaceful place with delightful music. The menu had tempting names. we ordered few snacks, main-course and desserts. Though there was a delay in serving the food, but the food was so delicious that I and my friends decided to go for more. The dessert 'Malpoa' was yum! Even the mocktails and cocktails looked tempting and were refreshing and tasty. 
I suggest you advertise the Country Roads restaurant well so that it gets noticed.

this was our first visit to this place, having heard quite a lot from one of our family friends. the place is really cool and cosy. my husband ordered mocktails for us, Russian Choice. the mocktail was wonderful and we ordered it again. for food we decided upon Grilled chicken and spano salsa. the chicken was cooked tender such that it really did melt in the mouth, and it was served with rice. the food was tasty as well as spice and quantity was good enough to fill ourselves. 
the service was timely and courteous, we had a wonderful time.

we will be looking forward to visit again :(

I decided to celebrate my birthday here and it definitely spoilt my day. The location is really odd to start with. Secondly the menu is so limited for vegetarians. We called for a veg platter and it was a huge disappointment. The jalapeños crackers were disgusting. Tasteless and dry. Even the Nachos we called for were horrible as they had fried the nachos which made it so oily. You could feel the extra oil in your mouth. When we asked the waiter to replace the jalapeños crackers, he got us babycorn fritters instead. The babycorn fritters were under cooked and raw. It was a huge disappointment. Lastly the mocktail menu is so limited. Music is nice but it just doesn't lift up the mood of the place. It just looked a better version of a local bar to me instead of a lounge. Overall it is a huge disappointment. Definitely not recommending this place to anyone.

Silent place..with nice ambience.
But quite disappointed with the buffet experience.We went for team lunch here one Friday.
Didnt like anything except some starters mainly one fried fish n dry chilli chicken in non_veg which were good.However the main course was a disaster.Especially the chicken curry had no taste(totally spiceless).And for desserts only icecream was available which was not even served in an ice cream bowl :(
The starters along with the unlimited complimentary beverage(fresh lime or coke) were the only things that we liked.
May be al a carte options are better.
However the staff behavior and response was quite nice. :)

It was a pleasant surprise to see a restaurant that looks the way Country Roads does in Rajarhat, a locality that is starved of even regular Indian restaurant options. So, my hopes were up despite myself. The microbrewery s not functioning yet but the restaurant was in full flow. 

The mozarella sticks with jalapeno bits was the pick of the lot. Piping hot and chilly. The veg nachos were a slimy mess, courtesy the runny, oniony salsa. Main course for me was a "mixed sauce" pasta which turned up with very little sauce. There was zero flourish and it was a home style dish (Indian spices, et al) at best. The piece de resistance was dessert. The try-hard "chocolate icecream with makai roti" turned out to be a tiny scoop of icecream with corn tortillas. Salacious misrepresentation and the actual dish was not even great. We hoped for better with our beloved icecream sandwich. It was even worse with a molten, gooey slush trying to hold itself between 2 burger buns. A failed concept met with disastrous results. 

Please buck up, Country Roads. Work on your service, have the staff know their stuff. Work on your food, you should be getting the simple stuff right at the very least. Work on your menu, don't seduce people with creative names and then grossly under-deliver. Then you will see that a little will go a long way in your case. Good luck.

Had a team lunch recently at country roads. Since it's new opening and in a less crowded mall in Rajarhat area, the environment was quiet peaceful. Ambience was quite nice, and feel like a pub actually. Staff was very courteous and proactive. Couple of us took buffet@399/- plus taxes, and couple of ordered for a la carte - chicken stroganoff  and honey chicken. Both of them tastes good. Buffet had lots of starter, and tastes fine, main an deserts are very limited in no., but who cares if you had taken a plateful of starter. The buffet concept is more like chai break, but here they serves main and desert in table as well. Didn't tried any Mocktail or cocktail, that's for next time. Menu is interesting and will be soon there to try them !!

I know I have rated them highly and by my standards that's high enough!
It was the eve of the World Cup T20 semi final 2016 and India were to take on West Indies and we were to take on one of our colleagues for a grand treat at a sports lounge. But it had to be in the salt lake new town area. Zomato led us to Country Roads .... The most attractive part of their appeal was the Microbrewery. Alas we learnt that it was still not ready by that time. Located in a deserted Mall, the Galleria in a sparsely populated New Town area the buzz of a world cup eve was missing and I believe half the appeal of a pub lies in its crowd.
We got a big tv screen almost all to ourselves and cried and shouted in a losing cause.
But the food and drinks experience and was good enough to satiate the broken hearts. The glasses were just perfect for each kind of drink. They dont serve accompaniments which is a let down. The food was better than average. Can't say excellent though. The staff behavior was very good and homely but not professional enough. But that didn't spoil our experience a bit.
We had ordered Mutton spare ribs which was good, cashewnut masala, mutton sandalwood sheekh kabab, chicken makkhan tandoori and few other dishes too.
Definitely visit this place for a great experience !

Went with family for dinner to celebrate my wife's birthday & had an awesome time. Excellent ambience, there was a wide variety of cuisines to chose from  and last but not the least, the shooters, cocktails or any other drinks that they served were so innovative & fun that it made the evening even more special for us. The resturant manager & the young men who served us were extremely friendly & courteous. The chefs platter for starters was awesome, the kebabs from their Indian cuisines menu just melted in our mouth, the jalapeño cutlets, Russian burger & the Chinese noodles & rice were also really scrumptious. As for the drinks the 'rasgolla shooters' and the 'flaming Lamborghini ' were outstanding with all the drama & the right flavours .... And that made our evening even more memorable. Can't wait to come back for more .

High Five to the new Country Roads Microbrewery and Restaurant in Kolkata, the first of its kind! A unique and offbeat hang out with friends and family. Perfect for corporate dinners as the place, although overlooking the busy Rajarhat-Newtown Expressway, is as quiet as it gets. I have been here multiple times with friends and the tasty retreats have left me spellbound. 
We recently had a full family get together here, each of us ordering something different. I was stunned to see that the helpful staff not only served us our meals on time but also ,made sure that we had ample fun. They took care of the little ones running around the whole restaurant, took pictures for us, played the kind of music we wanted and what's more.. we watched the cricket matches too on the large screen plasma TVs. All in all, we had a fabulous time and we simply recommend this amazing restaurant to everyone!

We decided to visit this place today considering it was new so we drove all the way from theatre road to new town expecting something new and different. To my utter surprise rather shock there was not a single person in the entire complex nor at the restaurant when we entered. 
The menu selection is limited specially for the veg, mock tails are ok... But the service is the worst, they lack trained staff namely shubhankar chakraborthy who had the audacity to tell us that they don't serve onions with Indian food... I mean even the cheapest Dhaba will serve lemon n onions... When we ask for it they delay it and bring it when we are almost done... There is no manager or owner on floor on Sunday night to provide any explanation or any service for that matter... Most shameful and horrible experience.... Micro brewery was shut so it was a total waste of time energy needs money....

Silent posh place.Tht have a microbrewery in making that will be open.it ia visible from.outside.that makes the place special. We had ordered chicken which was too soft and tasty.the butter tandoori roti also bore the proper characters that it must have.. Only drawback.of the place is that it is located in Dlf Galleria mall which is least noticed due to the flyover in front of it. In the mall also.it is not located in a.much noticeable place. But if you wanna visit you wont regret.. I recommend this.place to all the couples as they can spend a.lonely quality time here.

Tucked away in The Galleria near Home Town, Rajarhat, Country Roads makes up for it’s slightly out of the way location with fine-dining-worthy dishes at very reasonable prices — perfect for impressing a first date without breaking the bank! Away from the hustle and bustle of City, Country Roads is Kolkata’s first in-house micro brewery, modern restaurant cum gastrobar and it’s perfect for a date night out.

On the eve of Valentine Day I got invited by their management to enjoy my dinner with family at Country Roads, love is in the air and what better way to celebrate it than enjoying high-quality food and astonishing drinks with nearest and dearest one?

The wonderful background music and charming ambiance is best enjoyed with your loved ones or a best friend, the kind of person who won't judge when you make inappropriate noises at dinner. Both the relaxed atmosphere and honest food demand that you leave all etiquette at the door — you're gonna get your hands and face a little dirty.

This space is outfitted with simple wooden tables and designer chairs and sofas, lending an elegant old-world charm that puts you at ease. Sit at the high chairs at bar if you want an even more casual vibe. The staffs are both knowledgeable and friendly, answering your every query about food and drink.

Committed to bringing you specially-crafted cocktails with a strong emphasis on local flavours, this bar boasts a uniquely Kolkatan take on their cocktails with flavours you'd never think could be combined with alcohol. After some discussion with their specialist bartender Prakash I decided to have ‘Jimmie's Jar’ and ‘For The Angles’ cocktails for myself and my wife to quench our thirst while my son preferred to enjoy ‘Red Lips’ mocktail. 

Jimmie's Jar – Don’t be fooled by its fruit juice like appearance — the drink contains mind bowing mix of alcohols, so don’t pace yourself. Vodka and Gin punch perfectly mixed with smashed fresh orange, pineapple & plum juice with hint of grenadine and cranberry juice. You world get a distinct sense of balance between thoughtfulness and boundless imagination. Jimmie's Jar, the signature cocktail surely packs a good punch, making it really value for money.

For The Angles - Expect to be intrigued with creations such as For The Angles — Tequila, triple sec mix with fresh tamarind water. This amazing drink can relieve your stress in no time. Spiked with Tequila and served in a proper cocktail glass, this ice-cold fresh tamarind water strikes the perfect balance between tanginess and an alcoholic punch.

Red lips – the heart-stoppingly delicious fresh Green Apple blend with house special Irish cream and apple juice. My son had fun sipping on this cool baby.

We started our food adventure by ordering warm Noorjahani Tikka served with mint-coriander chutney, these make for a fine introduction to the flavours of the Middle East that inspire the food here. Let the melt in your mouth flavourful chicken pieces seduce you, before you assault your tastebuds with the piquant mint-coriander chutney. Truly wonderful starter to start our meal.

Country Roads is great at both their cocktails and bar bites, so get your appetites going with creative tipples like the tropical vodka and gin-based Jimmie's jar while nibbling on moreish starters like Chicken Noorjahani Tikka, before moving on to the mains.

It is entirely worth your money to splash out on either the five or seven-course degustation menu, so as to experience the true depth of Executive Chef Niladri’s cuisine.

For main course I opted to take pleasure in their Shahi Dum Aloo, Yakitori and Pollo Steak Au Rosemary Jus accompanied with three mocktails Kir Royal, Mango Twist and Orange Virgin Mojito.

If you prefer something lighter yet flavourful and mild spicy to start with, go for the Shahi Dum Aloo — the sweet fillings pair beautifully with mild spicy greavy. Beautifully cooked stuffed potatoes with scrumptious filling of mawa, dry fruits, beaten curd and mix of different spices, definitely a delight for vegetarian. This might just be one of the best mild savoury versions you will find as it really hits the spot with texture and flavour.

Next, most crucially, was the flavour base — The Yakitori, an indulgent starter come main of Country Roads. The dipping sauce was marvellous, and the chicken pieces were fresh, generous, well spiced, and unbelievably tasty. Seriously, you have to try it to believe it and you won't stop swooning over how good this is.

If you think you're rather well-acquainted with French cuisine, allow the unique, lip-smacking Pollo Steak Au Rosemary Jus at Country Roads to open your eyes. Wine, rosemary and sauce? Not the typical union of flavours, but Country Roads’s rendition proved it to work. The Pollo Steak Au Rosemary Jus - sprinkle stuffed tender chicken topped with layer of green onions, wine, sauce and rosemary here plays on the balance between sweet and salty. Their Pollo Steak with Rosemary Jus was a unique find and definitely worth a try.

The mocktails pairings were all well thought out — for example, the marvellous Mango Twist - Mango juice blend with fresh cream and passion fruit, goes seamlessly well with The Yakitori’s rich flavours. 

What's truly enticing about a good mocktail was a balance of salty and sweet, and the one at Country Roads totally nails it with their Orange Virgin Mojito - fresh Orange muddled with lime and mint leaves, top with lemon lime soda.

Kir Royal – was basically a Kiwi punch with sweet sour mix and a touch of pineapple, topped with cola. This refreshing drink works perfectly as palate cleanser.

Before the desserts arrived on our table I ordered one more cocktail ‘Russian Choice’, found it another master piece of Bartender Prakash. Over the course of your night, sip on a Russian Choice — Whisky blend with sweet-sour mix and egg white, topped with red wine! You should not want the night to end and let the rest of the date unfold.

Don't expect classic cocktails here. Instead, they do quirky, interesting cocktails like the Jimmie's Jar, and Russian Choice served in one-of-a-kind vessels, as the bartender prefers adding his own twist to create unique cocktails.

A must-try dessert is their Nachos Ice Cream -- a truly innovative dessert of ice cream and hot nachos. Chocolate ice cream and strawberry sauce packs lots of texture and flavour in every mouthful. Soft and crispy nachos, gives a salty and sweet effect, this dessert was loaded with just the right amount of crunch and smoothness.

So, if your tummy space permits, end the night with the signature Nachos Ice Cream, a most unique dessert of chocolate ice cream and strawberry sauce served with hot nachos, and perhaps one more cocktail…

There's something calming about this cosy space, perhaps it’s the sitting arrangements or the wall decoration, or the furniture — it sends you to another place and time. The place instantly puts you at ease with its brick walls, and super friendly staff who are more than happy to help you find a drink you'll love. This is the kind of place for those looking for a novel experience, while still being able to relax and enjoy a good conversation with friends at the same time. As promised, you will be satisfied long time.

A pleasant surprise in Newtown. It feels like an American Sports Bar sans the TV, but the decor with the faux leather upholstery, the bar and especially the micro brewery (which is not yet operational by the way) makes the place quite unique, at least in this part of the city. The restaurant is spread across and gives the feeling of lot of space. The food is tastefully served and the servers very polite and forthcoming. We tried the chicken steak, stroganoff and the American burger - all three score full marks on taste and presentation. Serving is adequate but not too much - a normal rice portion will serve two adults.  If you're adventurous then try the Rosogolla Shot, it really hits you! 
Overall a very nice experience and we'd a lovely time with friends.

It was the perfect spot for our college reunion after many years. The atmosphere is hip - reminded me of gastro pubs of San Francisco - first micro brewery of Kolkata will be very interesting - the food was excellent - we tried their kebabs and the lamb chops and the Chinese main dish - everything was just too good !
The best per was the drinks - we just went for Indian whiskey and they had exactly what we were looking for - the service was perfect - the adda fantastic and the smoking room a nice touch - overall you will love this place and I can see this to be the place to hatch your new startup idea or meet with friends or take you date out to an unique joint in new town Kolkata !

Heard of this place through word of mouth. Headed over to check it out in a weeknight. They have a large spacious area. The music is just right, soothing tunes at just the right volume. Well, the microbrewery hasnt started yet, but you should check out this place anyways.
They have a large variety of cocktails available. The bar too, is well stocked. Quirky options of shots too, for those fond of it. Do try the Rosogolla Shot, its something else.
Food menu is limited, but dont let that fool you. Quantity is enough. Quality is excellent. Presentation is quite good.
A very good experience on the whole. Staff are very courteous and well mannered. Even the prices are reasonable. Hope though, that the as this place gets older, things dont get worse. Cheers!

A group of school friends meeting up regularly at regular intervals with the intention of chatting up of old times, family news and career tit bits can get pretty demanding on a restaurants staff and kitchen.
The Country Roads staff and choice of food, be it the large spread of choices, well made preparations and the very large selection of cocktails and mocktails met and surpassed the expectations of the assembled 7 odd souls.
The pluses:
Service was prompt and efficient.
Food preparation was quite good.
Prices were competetive
Parking was easy
Decor was good

The major minus:
no micro brewery yet
choice of wine lacking
On the overall rating, very happy with the experience....would certainly make it a primary jaunt

Kolkata gets her first microbrewery restaurant! An offbeat location. Ample space. Seating arrangements for big and small groups. Drinks available. Food wise, set menus and a la carte. 
Only Con, the customer was not allowed to choose their food liking from their set menu. One has to eat ONLY offered by them.
Also, the food was huge in quantity for four people, they didn't allow us to pack!!!

Visited this new resturant today with my office mates. Please find me ratings below :-

1. Ambience - 4/5
2. Service - 4/5
3. Food - 3/5

Ambience and service is very good. Not awesome though. But food wasn't tasty in comparison to the price. We ordered chicken strognoff, some fried rice with chicken (cant recall the name), non veg nachos (not crispy) and a continental dish of prawn. But I must say the food wasn't tasty. Need to improve on that. Presentation of the food was very good but taste was not that good. Please improve on that.

One of my friends suggested this restaurant- although the microbrewery is yet to start, the food was excellent with a personal touch as the owners and the chef were interacting with the diners. The various cocktails and mocktails were amazing and best thing I liked about it - was the decor...the theme of the restaurant matches with the microbrewery concept and this is probably the first time I have come across a (micro)brewery situated in the restaurant premises...its A TRENDSETTER OF SORTS...the price is reasonable... but most important is to grab the offers that they have floated...I took the Rs.299 + tax (unlimited assorted burgers with beer)...awesome...expecting to visit again with my family & friends...

Since my friend was a vegetarian so we ordered all veg dishes. Loved them. The look is yummy....All those who like a tangy taste, please try the For the angel cocktail. Waiting time was very short. I will be eagerly waiting for the microbrewery to start. The place has a old english travern like ambience....and the name resonates...."Take me home, country roads"
