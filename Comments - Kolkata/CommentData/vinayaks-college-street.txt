When we had to run between classes and grab some quick bites, Vinayak's often came to our rescue. But the food quality was just below average. I always had the south Indian options though there were pure veg North Indian and Chinese options as well. 
The idlis were too hard, the chutneys didn't taste good at all. Can't rate more than this.

Vinayak is a pure veg restaurant situated near the MG road crossing and catering North Indian and South Indian dishes. Dropped in for a quick snack and took a masala dosa which tasted really nice. Good food in budget pricing.

This restaurant is situated near Mahatma Gandhi Road crossing. Its mainly a vegetarian restaurant with a collection of south Indian food and sweets. Tried their dhosa. Its good in taste but the restaurant needs improvement.

This place is situated exactly at the mg road crossing. We went there in our college lunch break. Ordered masala kulcha, falka and chana masala. The food was not at all tasty. Masala kulcha was a piece of maida with plain  potato filling. Even the condition of the place was not hygiene. The staff was pathetic.  Waste of money and time. :-/

I was feeling like having some cold food and in the terribly humid and hot weather and wasn't actually in the mood for street food. This economy joint popped up as like a bliss as I crossed CR Avenue from the Chitpur side. The seating is high stools. 
I ordered dahi vada. Even in decent joints I've seen bhujia sprinkled on the top for cutting corners, but this place uses sev, what is supposed to be used. The dahi vada tasted good, though I felt it could be a wee bit less sweet. No complaints, though. Prices are quite reasonable. The waiters are in uniform and cooked food is properly stored in modern fashion. The environment looked hygienic which is a plus point. Overheard that they do vegetarian catering as well. 
This seemed to be one of the reliable budget joints of the area. They sell a range of sweets besides Indian, Chinese and south Indian snacks and meal items.
I would like to try their kesariya kulfi next time.
