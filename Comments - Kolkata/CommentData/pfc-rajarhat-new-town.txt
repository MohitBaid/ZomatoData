KFC like chicken preparation for about half of the price than KFC. Had chicken Burger and it was satisfying...found not much difference between the original kfc zinger burger. The areas that they can improve is the packaging and the choice of dips & ketchups. Otherwise pretty affordable and tasty option for a quick meal in this area. Hopefully they would start operating in the morning and may start the home delivery service also.
