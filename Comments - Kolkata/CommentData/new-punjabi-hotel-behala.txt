This place is famous for lassi. You won't get the feeling of a restaurant because of the ambience. You might find the food a bit oily and spicy because it is indeed their tradition. If I talk about the quantity well it's more than enough. But quality and ambience don't allow me to give good rating.
Thank you

I am pretty sure that most of the residents of Behala, AT THE LEAST, have had Roti Tadka or Chicken Bharta (red or white) from this place. If you haven't please try it out and soothe your taste buds. I visit this place regularly because there are hardly any North Indian (non-veg) items on the menu which I do not like!!
Please let your joint be the way it is because the day you renovate, you'll be increasing the prices. So... :-D

I have rated this highly because of its typical roadside Dhaba style food. Its not a restaurant which is neat and ambience is shaggy. But the food is awesome if u are a fan of Dhaba food. Chicken Bharta, Tarka, Roti and Amritti (sweet) are its main attraction alongwith Lassi.

This place has two seating arrangements one in the ground floor which is non AC and remains crowded mostly and the other in the first floor which is AC. Our order for today was roti, tarka and paneer butter masala. The paneer was yummy. I have been visiting this place since a long period of time. I prefer their veg dishes over non-veg ones.

When on a budget, you wish to have some lip smacking and red hot spicy Indian food look no further. This is my daily go to takeaway joint for tandoori rotis, egg tadka, chicken do piaza and some other super oily acidic curries when I'm in town! The quality of food is decent and has never let me down. The portion sizes are adequate and filling. They have some delivery partners but I always prefer visiting them and pick up my food since I can give some special instructions while they cook my food.

Cheers!

Haven't been there. Ordered food via Swiggy. Once I ordered Chicken Bharta, chicken was not good but the taste of the gravy was good. A few days ago I ordered Chicken Tandoori. This was really good. Good in taste. Quality and piece of chicken was also very good.

While looking for combo deals over Swiggy came across this dhaba situated at Ajanta connecter of Jameslong Sarani , offering a mouth watering combo at Rs 345/- plus taxes and packaging charge.
The combo consisted of two piece each of Reshmi Kabab and Chicken Tikka Kabab, full portion of Chicken Bharta and four piece each of Tandoori roti, Rumali roti and Butter Roti.
Now the two tandoori items were accompanied with a chatpata Coloury Green - Green Chatni.The two tandoor pieces were succulent with a smoky flavour intact.Now chicken Bharta which is an inevitable item in the menu of any restaurant and dhaba ,was creamy in taste with the shreaded chicken being well cooked and the natural sweetness of cashew being just appropriate.
Now coming to the Roti's , the tandoori Roti's were absolutely rubbery, as it was chewey and elastic like

Rumali roti had the same issue though not that intense and not chewey at all.Only the butter roti was soft and was satisfying to eat with the Bharta and an extra Mixed veg that I had ordered.
Mixed Veg had a monotonous taste ,and it being just sweet, with all veggies being cooked.
Now both the tandoor items were packed in a aluminium casserole, Roti's in aluminium foil and the chicken Bharta and Mixed Veg in plastic containers.
Over all with a overdose of roti variety ,I  would like to re- Kristen this combo as " Roti Khao Khud Jan Jao".

Ordered from New Punjabi Hotel a plate of chicken bharta via swiggy few days back.

The chicken bharta was overflowing with oil. But it tasted good. The quantity was enough for two. It was a pretty good deal considering the price range.

I know it's not fair to rate a restaurant after having only one dish. I am rating the dish as a 3.5 out of 5. Hopefully, I will update the review after trying their other dishes.

I have nt ordered food frm here online bt hav taken takeaways many times... The taste of the food is nt extraordinary bt is gud.. Nd by gud I mean quite gud.. Must try their Rumali roti nd Shahi panner... Then Kashmiri Aloo Dum is also quite gud... Also some other items like Aloo Butter Parantha, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Paneer Tikka nd Chicken Sheek Kababs are also nice.... Nw coming to being a quintessential bong nd nt havin the taste of Biriyani of any food joint qualifies as rude.. So frm my opinion the Biriyani is so so.. Bt nt dt much of a recommended things frm the menu... Another important fact is dt the prices is also very pocket friendly which also works in their favour... So a definite place to go fr if some1 has a pocket crunch nd wnts to hv decent food....

On the occasion of Women's Day I ended up ordering from this restaurant but was a bit sceptical on what the taste would be like. After I opened the packaging that beautiful smell of Ghee on the Mutton Kheema was mesmerizing. Coming to Chicken Bharta, I assure you all reading this such taste can only be found in dhabas in Punjab. Ordered a simple spread...Mutton Keema, Chicken Bharta and Rumali Roti.
I take this forum to thank the team of New Punjabi Hotel for bringing the authentic taste of Punjab to Kolkata. 
Keep up the good work. My best wishes are with you.

We went for a takeaway last October. Took egg tadka and rumali roti. My tongue is accustomed to having cheap egg tadka easily available along EM bypass, near Ajaynagar. After that, this tadka felt heavenly. Decked with spices and oil and other unhealthy stuff, it still makes my mouth water from time to time. Needless to say, it went hard on my stomach. But the food experience was good. I can "risk" once more to try more dishes from the place. The review may improve after more experience.

We ordered food from here last night and the food was brilliant. Here are the things we had.
• Rumali Roti : Good sized, two of these is enough to feed a hungry soul. Price is just Rs.6
• Panner Butter Masala : The perfect side dish for Veggies. The Panner tasted very good. The gravy was the best part of it.
• Chicken Bharta : Little spicy and comes with 6 pieces of chicken. Very good.
• Chicken Reshmi Kabab : Soft and much juicy six pieces of Chicken. It was a great starter. Had perfect amount of butter rubbed on it.
• Egg Tarka : The Tarka tasted average. I didn't love it much, as it tasted more like roadside restaurant.
.
Prices are very pocket friendly. We 7 friends had our dinner and it costed us only Rs.620

Ordered Mutton biriyani and veg palau through swiggy. So i have no idea about the ambience or decor of the restaurant. Coming straight to the food, the veg palau was really nice. It had the taste of ghee and with lots of veggies the way i like. Its perfect to team up with either chicken, mutton or even paneer.
The mutton biriyani was tasty but it was so damn spicy. They used too much cloves in it. After sometime my lips started to burn. So anyone who does not like spicy food must keep this in mind. The quantity was really good. It is one of the oldest restro in the area and the food was kind of average. Nothing fancy but not bad too.

If the cook's absent from work, this is the place where the food came to our plates since I can recall. Open almost whole day, their Reshmi butter masala and palak paneer are a must. Even the dine in, with the added air conditioner, is a good bet for a dhaba.
I recall coming here early morning for tea and sweets. My university almost became a fan of this place back in my time.
The tandooris and kebabs here are also a must. Hygiene is an issue but I have never heard of anyon falling sick from the food at this place. And I've been a regular for 20+ years.

Good food. The place is not preferable for dine in. It is a dhaba. Although they have the separate place for dine in .I would recommend only take away. The staff were well behaved. And the service was very fast . 
Now about the food. Food was good in quantity, quality and taste. 
We ordered Matar Paneer, Chicken Tikka Kebab, Chicken Tikka Butter Masala, Egg Tadka, Rumali Roti.

#Mattar Paneer
The mattar paneer was good in taste . The paneer was very soft. If the green peas were less in amount, then it would perfect.

#Chicken Tikka Kebab
I love their Chicken Tikka Kebab. You can try any of their kebabs. The chicken was very soft and fresh.

#Chicken Tikka Butter Masala
That was too much spicy. But I liked that flavour. The dish was well cooked and chicken was soft. 

#Egg Tadka
I never had such Tadka before. I would recommend everyone should try this at least once. 

#Rumali Roti
Rumali Rotis were soft enough . And I think 3 rotis are sufficient for anyone. 

The packaging for parcel was good. They also provided some onions and green chili with the parcel.

This is a place I visit quite often for take away. I have dined in many a times as well. But the better option is always the prior one. The place is more of a Dhaba with some tables and chairs in it. They have too section, one of them is the Non A.C. Section which is in the ground floor and the other being the A.C section in the first floor. The service staffs are nice and you will get your food super fast. The prices are minimum with no tax. But what takes you to this place over and over again is their food. The food has been good since years and has become very famous in locality.
Most of the time I order Tandoori Roti or Rumali Roti with Chicken Bharta which is their speciality. The quantity is quite outstanding and two people can easily fill their stomach. The Lassi over here is very famous and they make it superbly well. They also serve somosas, jalebis and other snacks in the evening.
A very good place to have some good Indian food in very minimum price.
4/5 for this place

THE FOOD QUALITY TODAY IS VERY AVERAGE ,ONLY THE TADKA,MATAR PANEER,MUTTON AND SOME CHICKEN DISHES ARE WORTH TRYING FOR A QUICK MEAL OR TAKE AWAY.
I WILL NOT RECOMMEND THE TANDOORI DISHES.
NAN AND TANDOORI ROTIS ARE NOT THAT GOOD.
ADDS GREEN PEAS TO MANY DISHES WHERE IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE ADDED FOR EXAMPLE CHICKEN BHARTA.

to this place but after 8pm as there a.c section opens by then. the food is great is taste n dangerous in portion. n there waiters are very polite n decent too.recomeded chicken reshmi kabab,chicken tandoori, butter chiceken,chicken bharta n dal with tandoori roti or butter nan.n yes dont forget to have a lassi in the end.

Intro: New Punjabi Hindu Hotel is quite an old place and i had visited with a few of my friends for few times. The ambience of the place will not mesmerise you at all. Not even the A/c section. Nevertheless, if you solely go by the ambience, i would not recommend this place at all. 
=====
Food ordered:

1) Daal Tadka - It was just okay. Butter was spread on top properly. The taste of the daal could be enhanced much more. 

2) Chilli Paneer - It tasted sweet. Probably add on of too much of tomato sauce. 

3) Tandoori Roti - The roti's were crisp n hot. 
=====
Pros:

1) Quite reasonably priced.
2) Service is fast. 

Cons:
1) Ambience is bad.
2) Hygiene is not maintained.
3) No quality food herein. 
=====
Expert Suggestions:

1) Improve your quality.
2) Improve your ambience.
3) Improve your hygiene. 
4) Improve the menu card as well. 
=====
Meal for two: 200-500 
=====
Summary:

Food Presentation: 3/5
Food Quality: 3/5
Food Quantity: 3.5/5
Ambience: 2.5/5
Hospitality: 3.3/5
Value for money: 2.8/5

Located just opposite to Ajanta cinema hall. A place you can check in always when you are low on budget. Though they have sitting arrangements, . Then again most of the people prefer takeaway than sitting over there and eat. Foods taste delicious and also prices are reasonable. Must try- chiken tikka butter masala, chicken tengri masala, hariyali kebab, tandoori butter naan and egg curry. Ambience is ok with ok staffs. I always go over takeaway from there and would suggest the same to others also.

This place is a gem for those craving for authentic punjabi khana...last weekend,when dad completely surprised us with a gala punjabi dinner bought from this outlet...i do admit i was a bit sceptical..as i hadn't ever even heard of this place...But then magic happened...and with every morsel i gulped down...i felt sheer gluttonous bliss...We had Tandoori roti and Matar paneer..Simply fabulous...i wouldn't mind saying.If the veg dishes from here can be so good...i cant imagine how heavenly the non veg counterparts would be like...can't wait to try them...

Its a good place at a quite cheap cost. The quality of food is quite good. Since it is quite pocket friendly its a good place for teenagers.
