A reasonable place where you can hangout, enjoy non alcoholic drinks, watch matches etc.

Visited the place on weekend. It wasn't much crowded. They have limited sitting area. A big screen where you can watch matches otherwise songs will b played.¬†

Food is ok. It is not like exceptionally tasted but it is fine. We tried mixed sauce pasta and veg schezwan noodles, I personally loved the pasta. Quantity wise it's sufficient for 2 heads. Drinks prices are very reasonable so that's a big plus point which can overcome a lot of drawbacks :P Sisha was very smooth which proved they use good quality material in the making. A private room is available for group parties.
The ambience is set up in a simple way and the music is not that loud. Most of the time they play desi songs and EDMs. They played channa mereya and tum jo aye. :v

¬†The chef, who is also the PR, personally made sure everyone was having a good time. He is a wonderful person, quite rare to see anywhere. Go for it guys. Definitely worth your money. PS: Rightly priced.

Overall it is a good place. i enjoyed being there, i would also like to visit again.

They dont charge any extra GST on sisha or any food items. What you see is what you pay, no extra charges. Oh I remember, they charge a minimal 6 percent service charge(optional). Parking is available. Go for it guys. Thanks!

Well I have been here several times to have shisha,the staffs are wonderful you can get food also not only hookah and the best part about kiaat is the staffs are very very friendly,the shisha is good,and the private rooms are awesome,you get these rooms where you can watch TV while having shisha and you can play some card or board games as well,you need to get your gang to access the private rooms other than that it's all good,if you didn't visit kiyaat yet then you definitely should.

They make so good hookahs at such a low cost. Any flavour( single or double) its the same price with a free coal change within Rs. 250 only. The food is not so good. The French fries were not well fried, some of them were raw at the centre. The mixed sauce pasta was not so good and it was too sweet. Its a small place with nice ambience and amazing staff. This place is a great place to have a hookah with your friends when you are broke or short on money.

It's okay for a hookah cafe... The food is average, service needs to be improved... I guess the teenage clientele is the main influence for the casual attitude

The joint is situated near Lake Mall just opposite to Jawad Habib Salon at Thakurbari lane which makes the place quite easy to locate. This place is quite small but yet very relaxing. The ambiance of this place is mind soothing. The staff is quite friendly and the service time is short. Despite a short service time they provide you with food that lights up your taste buds. We ordered ‚òÖmclawa,chef Amar special sandwich, shashlik kebab along with a vanilla-rasna base and a brainfreezer‚òÖand by the end we couldn't really say which one was better cause they were all so good. This place is quite pocket- friendly too which simply adds the cherry to the top. Because, teens or college student whoever wants to enjoy food that is tasty and isn't too costly can come here with their squad and have a good time.so if u r in a doubt where to go this cafe would surely not dissapoint you. ‚ô•:-)@

Never been a huge patron of Veg food, but I occasionally try my hands at it when accompanied by my vegetarian friends or when the food served at an establishment is actually good and accommodates a lot of flavours. With no hope whatsoever I stepped into this new establishment, Kiaat Reloaded, one fine evening last week, after a hectic spree of shopping at Lake Market.

We went forward and ordered quite a few things from the menu. To start with we ordered a plate each of the Veggie Grilled Philly Sandwich and the fried Jake cube. The Sandwich is filling and quite nicely balanced, unlike sandwiches at other places which either go extremely skimpy on cheese or over do it so much that the actual flavours are lost, none was the case here. The Fried Jake Cube on the other hand was a complete cheese extravaganza. 

For the main course, we moved on to the Mixed Sauce Pasta and the Kewa Dasthi. The former was announced to be the Chef‚Äôs special and it indeed tasted like that. Comforting flavours with every fork full of pasta satiated our hunger wonderfully. The Kewa Dasthi was a pleasant surprise and was not something I have had in any other establishment before. It is a Meghalayan speciality served in the form of a light cheesy sauce with green chillies and vegetables, accompanied by butter rice. 

We settled with the Pineapple Delight and the Black Current Mojito to go with our previous courses. While both the drinks were quite refreshing, the black current mojito was a sure shot hit. The black current flavour went exceedingly well with the lemonade and basil combo, without being overly sweet.

All over, there was a constant sense of satisfaction throughout the table. The service was quick, which added to the experience positively.

Hanging out with friends and family at Malls and Parks are quite a old fashion now. The young Gen is all looking for some exotic places where they get to chill out with lots of delicious food, drinks and now the heating up the trend Hukkah. No complaints that Kolkata dosen‚Äôt have good places but depends on the area or region where it is required the most.

Quite a few cafes and hookah parlours have opened around the Rashbehari area, ending the caf√©-drought-stricken period. Kiaat Reloaded is one such place which has been established recently. Earlier, this caf√© was located on Prince Anwar Shah Road. However, it has been relocated to the Lake Mall area now.

The place is located after crossing 2-3 buildings in the lane just opposite to Lake Mall. Refer to Google Maps for the perfect directions. Keep your eyes open so as to not miss it, as the fa√ßade is not well illuminated. This caf√© has a unique jungle based theme. The ceiling and walls have been decorated with maple leaves and grapevines. Middle-Eastern and Mughal era designed lamps adorn the d√©cor. The selection of songs playing in the background is praise-worthy. Overall it has a dim-lit environment. This place would be best suited for small groups of 4-5 people. However, they also have a private room for larger groups.

I found the service to be fluent and efficient, even though the place is fairly new. A sign that they have been well trained. The main thing for which we had visited the place, the hookah, was slightly off. It had nice aroma and flavour but indecent smoke density.
I would also recommend them to change their serving cutlery and upgrade to something a bit more appealing. Other than that everything went quite well.
Would like to thank Shahbaaz Zaman for recommending this spot.

So folks that was about it from Kiaat Reloaded.
Check out my blog for a wholesome experience. Stay tuned and watch this space for more updates about restaurants in Kolkata.

And Be Suavy !!

Earlier what used to be in Prince Anwar Shah Road now has a new address opposite Lake Mall.

Kiaat Reloaded is now open on the Jawed Habib lane, a jungle themed caf√© featuring shisha and veg food items.

The entrance of Kiaat welcomes you with bricked walls and ceiling leaves. A cozy environment with the newest playlist, the place is divided into two settings.

They also have a private room with a flat screen TV.

Coming to mocktails, we first ordered their Pineapple Delight. Now I'm not a big pineapple fan, but this drink tasted nothing like your regular boring juice.

However, I liked their Kit Kat Shakes better. Served in a glass mug, was our thick chocolatey, Kit Kat shake. They finished the entire drink with swirls of chocolate sauce and a Kit Kat piece on top.

The other mocktail that we took were Black Current Mojito. Probably, the prettiest drink we had that evening. A clear drink, obviously with strong hints of black current. They presented it with slices of lemon, mint leaves and ice on top.

Coming to starters, we first ordered their Sesame Fried Finger Corn. Six pieces of corn fingers, deep dried with sesame seeds randomly placed here and there.
What I liked about this dish the most was not just its spot-on flavour, but its technique. There was not one speck of oil on the fingers yet it tasted amazing.
They served this with a homemade secret salsa. A strong recommendation if you're visiting this place.

Next we had their Veggie Grilled Philly Sandwich. Big pieces of sandwiches served with French fries and a dip.

Next came Fried Jake Cube. Five cubes stuffed with gooey, molten cheese. This item was delicious in taste. They also served this with a small bowl of dip. Strongly recommended.

In Main Course, we had Kewa Dasthi- a Bhutanese dish which you would normally not find in any other restaurants.
Served in a bowl is a buttery-cheesy sauce which you're suppose to mix with the plate of rice that you're given. Definitely a unique dish to try out.

Mixed Sauce Pasta made our way next. A specialty in this caf√©, and a good main course to go after your starters.
Quantity-wise this is very pleasing. Served in a big bowl is penne pasta cooked to perfection and smeared in mixed sauce.

Our dinner ended with Fried Ice Cream. Plated pretty, this dish is fried on the outside adding to the hot element and is ice creamy in the inside, giving off the cool element.

The staff here seems to be on his toes to cater your needs. Service is done under ten to maximum fifteen minutes, which is very nice.

A newly opened caf√©, a new menu but the same old good quality food. Don't miss out on Kiaat Reloaded!

Decided to try this new vegetarian hukka place with some of my friends. The place has just opened and the theme of the interior decor is jungle. It's a very cozy place with comfortable sitting area and a special room with TV meant for small gathering.
For moctails we had
Pineapple delight-a light fizzy drink which complimented the starters perfectly
Black current Mojito- Something that I have tried for the first time and was impressed by the fresh taste.
KitKat Shake-A lovely wholesome shake, perfectly blended and beautifully presented.
Starters-
Sesame Fried Finger Corn- Baby corn with beautiful cover infused with sesame. The fritters were perfectly fried and the dip augmented the taste.
Veggie Grilled Philly Sandwich-A filling sandwich that comes with crispy French fries and a beautiful dip
Fried Jake Cube- Perfectly fried fritters with a soft tender inside.
Main Course
News Dasthi-Beautifully flavoured rice, cooked to perfection that comes  along with a creamy, pepper rich concoction
Mixed Sauce Pasta- A perfectly cooked pasta in a bed of rich creamy gravy topped with cheese . A must try!!
Dessert
Fried Ice Cream-If you have a sweet tooth you will surely love this dessert
So this is a perfect place to hang out with friends.
P.S- located on the opposite side of lake mall in the lane adjacent "bancharam".

With some of my friends I'm visited lake mall for some shopping and after tired of shopping we needed some good place to fulfill our hunger in budget price at nearby. So I called some of my foodie friends to suggest some place and then Shahbaaz Zaman suggested me this vegetarian Caf√©. So we been here for something Delicious to eat and try some hookahs.

‚óè Location- It was situated exactly where the zomato map shows but still it sometimes hard to find for first timers because it was in narrow lane. It was just opposite side of Lake Mall in a narrow lane in same street where Bhancharam Sweets Outlet was.

‚óÜ D√©cor- Decoration was really nice. Low light smoky environment. Traditional Royal themed lighting. Black leather couch. Mughal art tables. Intresting wallpapers. Plastic leaves on top. The moment you enter you'll see a small hall with couch and tables for dine in & hookahs & they also had a TV screen there for live sports action. And they also have a separate small cabin where easily approx 8 people can sit for private meet. In this cabin they also had a TV screen for Live Sports action. We take this cabin for our dine in.

‚óè Service- Ambience was really cool and hospitality was very warm it touches our hearts. Both owner and staffs were very friendly. We had some chitchat with owner she was very kind. Service was good and in reasonable time. Presentation was also good they just need a bit improvements in which they are already working. So very soon they are perfect in presentation too. Price was pocket friendly and very reasonable in comparison with taste, quality and quantity.

Now let's discuss about the food and beverages which we try today and first I liked to discuss the beverages.

We tried three beverages which were reviewed below-

‚óÜ Kit Kat Shake - First we want to start with a Caf√© drink so we ordered Kit Kat Shake. It was perfectly made and tastes amazingly. Presented beautifully with KitKat & spread dark chocolate on top and served in mug with pored chocolate in sides. Made with perfect mixture of chocolate powder and milk.

‚óÜ Pineapple Delight - from shakes we move on to mocktails and first ordered Pineapple Delight which was simply soda based Pineapple syrup mocktail which tastes heavenly Delicious. Mixed properly with perfect amount of syrup and soda and sweetness was also perfectly balanced.

‚óÜ Black Current Mojito - Classic Mojito made with tanginess on lemon and refreshment of mint with added Black Current Syrup on it and made a tangiest Mojito which tastes very refreshing and Delicious. Served I mug with mint leaves and lemon cutouts on it.

With Refreshing mocktails we ordered some tasty snacks which were reviewed below-

‚óè Sesame Fried Finger Corn - Crispy, crunchy and spicy deep fried baby corn with coated Sesame seeds and inside carrot, spring onion and green chilly tastes amazingly Delicious. Tastes best with their homemade spicy salsa dip. Full of spicy and full of crispiness deadly combination. Totally loved it.

‚óè Veggie Grilled Philly Sandwich - Grilled Philly bread cheesy sandwich stuffed with overloaded green, yellow, red bell peppers & onions, corn, carrot, mushroom, liquid cheese and oregano. Cheesy and tastes amazingly Delicious. Served with french fries and cheesy dip.

‚óè Fried Jack Cube - Deep fried jack cheese cubes stuffed with veggies like carrot, bell peppers, onion etc. Crispy from outside and melting soft from inside. Spicy and very Delicious in taste. Served with spicy mayo dip. Totally loved it.

After we finished off with our mocktails and starters we ordered couple of Delicious and intresting dishes on main course reviewed below-

‚óÜ Mixed Sauce Pasta - Penne pasta cooked in Delicious mixture of cheesy & creamy white sauce and spicy red sauce with butter & Cheese and with veggies like bell peppers, mushroom etc. Taste was little spicy and full of cheesy. Very Delicious.

‚óÜ Kewa Dasthi - This was something very unique and heavenly Delicious. Steamed rice served with Cheesy and buttery curry with some boiled veggies in it like bell peppers and carrot. As the curry made of liquid cheese and butter it was amazingly Delicious like heaven and tastes really good with steamed rice. Buttery, cheesy and creamy personal favorite.

We ended our Delicious evening with live cricket and Fired Ice Cream. We all know what Fired Ice Cream. Crispy and crunchy from outside and melting sweet from inside. It was made perfectly and tastes very Delicious. Garnished with cherry and pored dark chocolate on top.

We also have their hookahs they were aromatic, smoky and made really good. Liked them alot.

Liked to thank the owner and staffs for this warming evening. Totally loved this place. Must visit caf√©. Personal favorite. Highly recommended to all.

With some of my friends I'm visited lake mall for some shopping and after tired of shopping we needed some good place to fulfill our hunger in budget price at nearby. So I called some of my foodie friends to suggest some place and then Shahbaaz Zaman suggested me this vegetarian Caf√©. So we been here for something Delicious to eat and try some hookahs.

‚óè Location- It was situated exactly where the zomato map shows but still it sometimes hard to find for first timers because it was in narrow lane. It was just opposite side of Lake Mall in a narrow lane in same street where Bhancharam Sweets Outlet was.

‚óÜ D√©cor- Decoration was really nice. Low light smoky environment. Traditional Royal themed lighting. Black leather couch. Mughal art tables. Intresting wallpapers. Plastic leaves on top. The moment you enter you'll see a small hall with couch and tables for dine in & hookahs & they also had a TV screen there for live sports action. And they also have a separate small cabin where easily approx 8 people can sit for private meet. In this cabin they also had a TV screen for Live Sports action. We take this cabin for our dine in.

‚óè Service- Ambience was really cool and hospitality was very warm it touches our hearts. Both owner and staffs were very friendly. We had some chitchat with owner she was very kind. Service was good and in reasonable time. Presentation was also good they just need a bit improvements in which they are already working. So very soon they are perfect in presentation too. Price was pocket friendly and very reasonable in comparison with taste, quality and quantity.

Now let's discuss about the food and beverages which we try today and first I liked to discuss the beverages.

We tried three beverages which were reviewed below-

‚óÜ Kit Kat Shake - First we want to start with a Caf√© drink so we ordered Kit Kat Shake. It was perfectly made and tastes amazingly. Presented beautifully with KitKat & spread dark chocolate on top and served in mug with pored chocolate in sides. Made with perfect mixture of chocolate powder and milk.

‚óÜ Pineapple Delight - from shakes we move on to mocktails and first ordered Pineapple Delight which was simply soda based Pineapple syrup mocktail which tastes heavenly Delicious. Mixed properly with perfect amount of syrup and soda and sweetness was also perfectly balanced.

‚óÜ Black Current Mojito - Classic Mojito made with tanginess on lemon and refreshment of mint with added Black Current Syrup on it and made a tangiest Mojito which tastes very refreshing and Delicious. Served I mug with mint leaves and lemon cutouts on it.

With Refreshing mocktails we ordered some tasty snacks which were reviewed below-

‚óè Sesame Fried Finger Corn - Crispy, crunchy and spicy deep fried baby corn with coated Sesame seeds and inside carrot, spring onion and green chilly tastes amazingly Delicious. Tastes best with their homemade spicy salsa dip. Full of spicy and full of crispiness deadly combination. Totally loved it.

‚óè Veggie Grilled Philly Sandwich - Grilled Philly bread cheesy sandwich stuffed with overloaded green, yellow, red bell peppers & onions, corn, carrot, mushroom, liquid cheese and oregano. Cheesy and tastes amazingly Delicious. Served with french fries and cheesy dip.

‚óè Fried Jack Cube - Deep fried jack cheese cubes stuffed with veggies like carrot, bell peppers, onion etc. Crispy from outside and melting soft from inside. Spicy and very Delicious in taste. Served with spicy mayo dip. Totally loved it.

After we finished off with our mocktails and starters we ordered couple of Delicious and intresting dishes on main course reviewed below-

‚óÜ Mixed Sauce Pasta - Penne pasta cooked in Delicious mixture of cheesy & creamy white sauce and spicy red sauce with butter & Cheese and with veggies like bell peppers, mushroom etc. Taste was little spicy and full of cheesy. Very Delicious.

‚óÜ Kewa Dasthi - This was something very unique and heavenly Delicious. Steamed rice served with Cheesy and buttery curry with some boiled veggies in it like bell peppers and carrot. As the curry made of liquid cheese and butter it was amazingly Delicious like heaven and tastes really good with steamed rice. Buttery, cheesy and creamy personal favorite.

We ended our Delicious evening with live cricket and Fired Ice Cream. We all know what Fired Ice Cream. Crispy and crunchy from outside and melting sweet from inside. It was made perfectly and tastes very Delicious. Garnished with cherry and pored dark chocolate on top.

We also have their hookahs they were aromatic, smoky and made really good. Liked them alot.

Kiaat Reloaded is the latest outlet of Kiaat which was situated near Lake Gardens Flyover. Though the actual reason of the change is debatable. The new place is very difficult to find as my friends had to ask many people to find it and because of this the place was not full like it in the earlier one. Food still is costly here and on the other hand its Veg. Place is perfect for Time pass but nothing else. Rated less because I miss the old joint.
