We tried their combo which includes batura, kachori, rice, 2 types of curries and papad. Price is â‚¹189. Rice is more oily and tasteless. Kachori was really good. Curries are just okay nothing special. Good to satisfy hunger.

Hot N Spice Chaats is located at the food court of CC2, Rajarhat, New Town.

Ambience is nice.

Service is swift.

Staffs are nice.

Tried  papri Chaat & Paav Bhaji. Both were nice but nothing to rave about.  

Pocket pinch is bit high.

This outlet in Hangout food court in CC2 serves decent pav bhaji and chaats. I had the papdi chaat and the pav bhaji with extra butter in it. It was nice to stop my craving for pav bhaji for some time. :)

I don't know why, but I ordered Aloo Chat.. The taste was horribly bad. How could someone make aloo taste so bad I didn't understand. Did not had the courage to try their other items

Visited this place on the food court of city center 2 for some veg based platter so after going through the entire menu I had ended up checking out the SPECIAL PLATTER available there . At first I decided to get seated so had spotted an empty table and chair with a good view of the entire mall from above so that was a lovely feeling . Then as soon as I had given the order I was told it will take about 10 to 15 mins which is fair enough so I waited till 12 mins and yup then it was my number displaying so they kept up to their words which is a good thing here .
Moving on to the main part which is the food well I must say the platter was over floaded and sufficient enough as for the price they charged .In the platter there was 2 curries which were chola curry and paneer curry , then there was one bowl shaped full quantity of peas palao rice and 2 aloo parathes cut in 4 slices . Not forgetting there was papad , salad & dahi too .
Now the food that was given was hot and fresh so no problem there with that thing but the curries were soaking with a high amount of excess oil which was not much appealing however the taste was pretty fine . The aloo parathe was very nicely made and stuffed with generous amount of masala aloo and was soft and filling . The peas palao rice was also a bit oily I felt as it was so nice on taste but the oil factor just gave me a bit of a negative vibe not to go through it completely.
After spending my money I still have full faith that they make some good foods but they should have check on the oil and other things which is not expected to be present in the food in excess so that we can eat with a good spirit and feel good and repeat the visits with every positive eating moment here .

Yay..this is the 3rd time I am writing a firt review.

I had craving for pav bhaji for quite some time and I thought of fulfilling my craving today.

The bhaji was nicely made,but I wish it was hotter.I asked for extra pav and they said only one extra pav can be given.How bad.

I enjoyed the pav bhaji though.
Located in the food court of City Centre 2,just beside subway.
