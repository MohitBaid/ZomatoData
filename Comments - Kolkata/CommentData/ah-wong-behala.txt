Excellent service, small restaurant but humble owner. They are fast and the food tastes at par with The Blue Poppy and the price is much much cheaper. Only 4 tables so you may have to wait but trust me it will be worth it. Must try for all those who love Chinese food.
Do try chicken momo and Drumsticks, they are highly recommended.

This is a very small restaurent jst at the crossing of jameslong sarani and manton. I have been looking at the positive rrviews of this place for a long time and hence decided to try it myself. Well the food here is as said by many ,value for money. The quantity is also good... i have ordered mixed fried rice which is truely awsm bt the chilli chiken  i ordered was not quiet up to the mark as the chicken was small and mostly coated . Also  if you guys plan to dine here.. well you dnt expect a gr8 ambience as there is hardly any place for 10 people to sit here.
But you guys must give it a go... may or may not like it but its a definately BUDGET FRIENDLY restaurent.

Today I visited here with my bunch of friends for lunch around 12:30 P.m. thinking it to be opened for public. As the Zomato app showed me it opens by 12 noon so I showed up and I was told to come back around 2:00 P.m as the chef weren't present . Its doesn't have any proper time to open but it says  12noon in Zomato

Best for dinners when there's a pocket constriction. Cheap, affordable and decent ambiance, Ah Wong on the DH Road-James Long connector via Manton is one of the few places in Behala that serve quality Chinese food. Try their choupseys, soups and momos, among other things. Perfect for a quiet couple dineout on weekday nights, on your way back from work. I hope these guys stay, unlike recent examples.

A small little restaurant at the four point crossing on James Long just opposite to Manton.It is more like a take away counter with 12 chairs in three tables.Took parcel  of Ah- Wong Mixed Fried Rice and Sapo Chicken. 
The fried rice was just favoulusly prepared with shredded chicken, eggs,prawn, button mushroom and cashew.Portion size adequate for two.
Coming to Sapo Chicken it tasted sweet, sourish and lightly spicy .Tasted really good with the Special Fried Rice.Prices are extremely pocket friendly with no other taxes being charged.
Though all items are not always available , as none of the fish based items were available on a Sunday.Anyway food is good and pocket friendly, thus should be given a try by all foodies.

This is a small place to have food. 
The food is not extraordinary but just normal. The ambience is not good if you're expecting a luxurious treatment. It's a place on the road with see through glass doors and not a very comfortable place for dinner. It's good for casual outings and sudden plans because it is cheaper than neighbouring restaurants.

Came here on a quiet Sunday afternoon to try some of their authentic Chinese cuisine. The weather relented and I could travel all of 11 kilometers to reach the place. The decor is nothing much to write home about, a few Chinese hand fans mounted on the walls and doors, a welcoming mechanical cat on the table, and that was pretty much it on the ambience front. The saving grace was that the place was air conditioned and it was this fact which made me last the entire course.
                                                                ...

Behala, a neighborhood in the South West flank of "city of joy", is popular since ages for a variety of reason. The mythological connection of "Behula", the palacial residence of our Bengal's Dada "Sourav Ganguly", the historical connection with zamindar " Sabarna Roy Choudhury", the age old "Chandimela", and with relevance to the modern day city scape, the quintessential development of residential apartments, shopping malls, Fine dining places, altogether makes Behala, a promising concoction of historical legacy, and modern day lifestyle.
Specially to highlight upon the fine dining places, a stroll through the James Long Sarani is enough to make one understand how alluring a place is Behala for the foodies, with reference to the number of restaurants on either side(including some big brands like Hatari, Chowman, Cafe Coffee Day, Going West, etc.)
And one such addition to that count, happens to be a Chinese joint, right after crossing 'Hatari', is "AH WONG".
The restaurant is kept simple on decor and interiors, and the ambience is also normal/common. But, what makes it special is the delicious dishes they prepare. Among the wide range of delicious items, the ones that really stand out of the crowd are " Dragon Prawn", "Chicken hot wings", "Sapo fish" and "Thai Soup".
The other dishes are yummy too, and importantly, the quality of the raw materials used to prepare the dishes are exceptionally nice and worth mentioning.
And even if you are on a tight budget, I can assure you that here you'll get a sumptuous meal at absolutely reasonable price.
So if you are in Behala, and planning to try out a place other than the known/popular ones, walk in to "Ah Wong" and enjoy your meal. Happy eating!!

Thanks to

If you are on a tight budget and are craving good delicious hakka Chinese, come to this place!  This place is very pocket friendly and the food is really good. Their Chicken drumsticks (which are actually chicken wings tossed in a chilli - soya - garlic sauce) are too good! The dry chilli chicken is good but could do with some extra onions and bell peppers. I am not very fond of the thick noodles that chinese restaurants use because I am very fond of the roadside thin chow of kolkata but that a personal choice and chicken noodles here have chicken, and vegetables in abundance. The momos are decent. We order for home delivery very often from Ah wong and they have always been very consistent with their taste and quality of food at unbelievable prices.

Behala area is all being flooded with some varierty full and quality restos. Its a high competition with all those 132 places in the entire behala this new outlet came up good with very recent opening here at   the james long sarani.Dealing with complete chinese menu for you Mr.Haider the owner of the resto has kept  the attire and ambiance of the place very simple and decently chinese (nothing much to talk about the decors). Three tables up for grabs with full air conditioned.Tyhe locality of the place is a bit issue as  it falls at the bypass part so less the chance of getting flying customers to step in. The nearby school students has the oppurtunity to be at this place for a hangout and have their meals with so low prices. 

Moving ahead with it  so we were all ready and excited to have some chinese bombs to fell over us. The dishes were as follows: 

1. Steam Momo - The presentation was very good first up. The coating of the momo was a bit thick, the minced chicken inside was tasty but a bit over cooked a little.Served with the regular soup which contained too much of egg in it. 

2. Chicken Hot Wings - This was fabulous. From the presentation to the marination to the garnishing everything were well done. Soft and juicy inside. Well done this. 

3. Hongkong Chicken - It was good, conatained seasonal vegetables in it.Chicken in it was lil soft and juicy but needs to be marinated for more time i guess. 

4. Dragon Prawn - Excellently done this! The size of the prawn was perfect, the blends of the spices and the gravy in it was near to perfect. The best one on the table. 

5. Chinese Chopsey - It is typically served with rice but can become the Chinese-American form of chowmein with the addition of stir-fried noodles.The quantity of chicken in it was too much. Satisfactory  dish yet improvement needed. 

6. Sapo Fish - Presented nicely. Granishing looked good in the plate itself. Taste was good. I guess the raw material used is pretty decent. 

7. Special Fried Rice - Had so many fried rice from many place with so many varities. And regarding this one, so it was pretty average to be honest. Spices needed to be more flavourful and in quantity so that it  reaches the mouth.  

8. Soup Thai Style - Soup thai style was looking a match winner when it was placed on the table. The soup was

thick, contained chicken, small prawns, quantity full eggs and related spices in it. Too Good.

Though it has small ambiance but very pocket friendly prices & the service needs to be fast and improved.The quality of dishes are no doubt good and said earlier raw materials used is pretty good. The only negative is that they open after   4 o'clock and the positive is that THE RATES ARE INCLUSIVE OF ALL TAXES.

I wish them all the best and hopes to do well ahead. Cheers!

NOTE: This review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

On a rainy afternoon, I steeped into this small eatery with a bunch of friends. We were starving, and Ah Wong turned out to be a surprisingly good choice. It is located close to Orient day School, Behala. As we stepped in we realized it was an improved and improvised version of a fast food joint.The delicious smell from the kitchen allured us in, and we got seated. Once we looked at the prices we were alarmed, everything was very cheap. I would have given this place a 3.5, but I'm giving a .5 extra for the prices and for the fact that they have an AIR CONDITIONER (thank god for that) !! With pleasant Chinese fans, small and clean tables, and the gracious nature of the Owner - Mr. Haider, we felt welcomed and homely.

All you STUDENTS out there , this is the place for you - Cheap Prices, Air Conditioner, Great Chinese. What more do you need?

WARNING: Do not expect great ambiance!!

Our FOODATHON started :

 *Chicken Momo with Soup* : It was delicious, had a slightly thicker coating, inner chicken was juicy and the sizes were big. All in all a good start!

*Hot Wings* : Hot wings were plain delicious. The portions were good, it was spicy and yummy. Loved the presentation!

*Hong Kong Chicken* : This was less spicy dish, with chicken(had a very thin coating, so I loved it) and veggies(mushroom, onion, capsicum) in a colorless gravy-ish mix. I liked this dish.

*Dragon Prawn* : One of my favorites of the afternoon. It had 6 big pieces of prawn with lots of onion and capsicum and came in a red sauce. It was plain yummy !

*Special Ah Wong Fried Rice* : The rice had lots of Chicken, Prawn, Egg,Mushroom, Capsicum, and the 'special' part was that it had Kaju too.  This dish tasted nice.

*American Chopsuey* : This dish was a let down. The fried noodles had a oily smell and there wasn't much of gravy. But they gave good portions of chicken and veggie, which i liked.

*Sapo Fish* : This was the showstopper of the afternoon. I simply loved it. It had very thin flour coating. The fish was fresh and the gravy was spicy. It was plain perfect.

*Thai Soup* : This was also one of the best of the afternoon. It had lots of minced- chicken, prawn & fish, some mushroom & egg. This was thick soup and tasted very delicious.

All in all I had an yuuumilicious experience!

Ah Wong is a place which is very near to my place which has come up very recently. A place with a very comfortable price tag and great food. It has been quite a few times I visited this place and I loved the experience here. The quality of food is great. Even though the price is low it's great that they provide such food. The place is located in the main road just near Orient Day School on James Long Sarani.
I loved the Chicken Steam Momo here. It's juicy, it's big in size and well stuffed. The soup is just too good which accompanies the momo.
The Dragon Chicken was another dish which is worth recommending. It tasted as good as it tasted. 

A very good place which has come up and a great value for money.

Ah Wong is one of those restaurants in Behala which has come up very recently. A very promising restaurant which delivers some nice Chinese food in a very reasonable price. A place which concentrates on only food. Though it looks small and make your expectation level lil down but it quickly jumps up as soon as you start having their food. The place boost about their Chinese Chef who has pretty good experience in countries like Finland and Dubai. This food joint also serves some nice varieties of Chinese and Thai dishes and you would not get this quality of food at this price anywhere else in the locality.

These are the items which we tasted:
##Chicken Steam Momo: One of their speciality and they boost about it. The momo was soft and well stuffed. The soup accompanied with the momo was just too good.

##Chicken Drum Sticks: The drumsticks was one of the best of the afternoon. It was spicy, juicy and tossed well with the sauce to make it tasty.

##Chicken Thai Soup: The three dishes were bang on. The Thai soup was another great thing which we loved. It had minced chicken, prawn and fish. The soup was as good as you would like. One thing which I missed a bit was the lemon flavour.

##Dragon Prawn: The Dragon Prawn looked beautiful as it came on the table. It was red. When I had my first bite, I fell for it. The prawn was of great quality, perfectly marinated and well cooked. What a surprise to us with this dish.

##Chinese Choupsey : The presentation was good and looked beautiful but it was one of the few dishes which disappointed a bit. The noodles were not cooked well and the gravy was lil less. The ingredients put in it was remarkable. It had a good about of Chicken and mushroom.

##Hong Kong Chicken: The Hong Kong Chicken was not that great compared to the other dishes. It could have been better. The presentation was good though.

##Ah-Wong Special Fried Rice: They call it special because there are lot of ingredients which are used in it. It had cashews, mushrooms, chicken, prawn and egg. The quantity was good and it was not oily. A lil more spicy would not have been bad.

## Sapo Fish: The Sapo Fish again did a wonder with its taste. It was really delicious. The fish was fresh, well cooked and soft. One thing which I should mention is they don't compromise on quality.

|||| Why Visit This Place?
** Great Variety of Chinese Dishes.
** No Compromise on Quality.
** Very Reasonable Price.
** Easy to Locate.
** Taste

Location: On the Main Road of James Long Sarani. Just in between of Orient Day School and M.P. Birla School.

Last Words: One of those places which will provide you with great taste and good quality food. The place is a new food joint which has a promising future. This small outlet is worth your money and time. So guys definitely a place to try out.

4/5 for this promising place.

A small eat house on James Long Sarani Manton. As the name suggests its a place that serves Chinese dishes as Ah Wong is a Chinese Surname. Coming to food, i ordered a few chicken dishes on my course of 3 different visits. Chicken with mushroom oyster, sweet and sour chicken, Kung Pao chicken and Schezwan fried rice. The quantity is no doubt good but the quality was nothing special to talk about. There was no signature taste in any of them. It was very normal as you get it in most of the Chinese joints. As the owner informed the fishes they serve in all the fish preparations are bombay bhetki and not pure Bhetki so I din't order any fish yet as I am a bit too specific of fish preparations (Absolutely my preference). Nothing much to talk about the decor as there was again nothing eye catchy. Over all a good place for some quick food.

Well I am the first reviewer for this outlet..
Situated in the crossing of behala Manton and bhupen roy road. I ordered mix Hakka noodles and stream chicken momo. Hakka noodles was good , quantity wise and quality wise. Sufficient for two people. Momo was disappointed and that forced me to give 3.5 . otherwise I would have easily given 4.  
Carry on and best of luck
