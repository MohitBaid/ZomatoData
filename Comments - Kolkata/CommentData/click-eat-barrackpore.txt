Horrible experience!
The chicken pieces were hardly visible! Taste was also not up to mark.. chicken pieces were too small.
Needs a lot of improvement!

This is located near 4no. platform barrackpore station, it is basically a south indian restaurant that provides various south indian dishes, quality and quantity pretty good, ordered 1 plate idli, a chicken dosa roll, and a special dosa, I'm impressed by the food they supplied taste wise very good. Would recommend everyone to try chicken dosa roll it's just superb.

This is a new South Indian food joint at Barrackpore. I ordered masala dosa, chicken dosa and idli, costing 117 INR. The dosas were near-perfect, the sambar was a bit too tangy for my palate, though. The delivery was prompt. Will definitely order again. Hope they'll maintain the same quality in the long run. 
Edit: I ordered again today and this time, it was a taco along with special masala dosa. Dosas were perfect. However, for two dosas, they provided insufficient amount of sambar.
About the taco, that wasn't taco. No respectable food aficionado would approve of a piece of batter fried chicken along with mayonnaise-coated cabbage, herbs and julienned carrots in a taco. Sear the meat in a pan, buy taco seasoning, use it, use fresh tomato, onion, jalapeño. Mayo in a taco is an abomination. Avocado is easily available these days. Make guacamole!
