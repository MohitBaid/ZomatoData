One of those typical local fast food centres. They are prompt. The food is mediocre at best. They always have rumali roti and the place is open till quite late. Their garlic chicken is good. I haven't tried their other chicken dishes. What i like the most here is their rolls. They are significantly larger than other such joints and their tikia roll is a steal at Rs 45.

I have been having food from this small takeaway joint from 1999 I guess, so you can imagine how much I've liked my experience. Not only me, Lokenath (as it is locally called) always has a que in front of it, which still proves that they have maintained their quality. A favorite among every Dhakuria resident, the place serves both North Indian and "calcutta" chinese. I personally prefer their romali roti and chicken chap, which they actually serve in an earthen pot even for take away.

This tiny take away counter is located on maharaja thakur road.I've ordered for Boneless chilly chicken.Taste was good,quantity was moderate but only thing was they should have used plastic container instead of aluminum  Foil. This was a pocket friendly take away counter.

Want a quick bite but also want taste, good price, and quantity? Then this one is for you. They are mainly famous for their rolls and they have a variety of those. They also make the good Kolkata street food style chowmin. Their chops, fries, and finger foods are quite good. Funny thing is, you can eat a whole lot of those without reaching for antacids. So, obviously they use good quality cooking oils and don't sneak in stale and rotten one left over from the day before into the fresh ones. They make such big rolls that one will fill you up for the night. And they are tasty.

One of thousands silent cavalryman of Kolkata street food kingdom. 
I have tried almost each and every dish they serve and i got everytime what I expected. If someone is searching for delicacy, it is definitely not the place.
Rolls are their USP. 
Chaap is not so good.

You can't expect much from this joint which is a modified road-side joint. Like all such Kolkata joints, they prepare a variety of stuff like Biriyani, Chicken Chaap, Various fritters like Egg Devil, Mutton Chop, Fish Chop, gravy items like Chicken Kassa, Chicken Masala, etc.
The experience was definitely not what we would have liked it to be keeping in mind their standard and stature.
