You must learn and respect bengali culture if you want to run business in west bengal. By insulting a bengali speaking customer you insult our whole nation. You must leave bengal and close your business.

Its a small food joint but the food is really delicious. Their double egg double chicken roll is really a big treat. Its located on Kona express way before carry road crossing. They prepare good biriyani. Its light yet tasty.

Nice place to have a quick Biriyani or Mughlai break if you are around this area.... The main item here, that is Biriyani, is quite good both quality wise and in quantity.... We tried their Chicken Mashala.... and that item is not that good.... hope to visit again....
