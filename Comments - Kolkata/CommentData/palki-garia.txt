I visited this restaurant a couple of times very recently ; and a little unsure about how to rate this place . The firs time I went there , I ordered Chinese food . Both the starters and main course were simple and light and not too spicy and quite tasty ! It impressed even my mother (which is no mean feat) ! The second time I visited this place , I ordered Indian food - jeera rice , pulav , dal , Kashmiri dumaloo , fish gravy items . None of the items , to my dismay , tasted good ! The worst of the lot was Kashmiri dumaloo (it looked and tasted like boiled aloo mixed in tomato gravy) ! Anyway , I may give this restaurant another try simply because it's so close to where I stay and the food is both stomach & pocket friendly ! But, if you are looking for a place that offers great food and awesome ambience , this is not for you !

The place is quite ok. The location is amidst an upmarket residential neighborhood and the decor is good. The place serves liquor and snacks are tasty. We had ordered Chinese which was good; not too oily. The place can be visited once.

A dinner plan gone horribly wrong...@ Took ages, 50 minutes to be precise, to get our starter - tandoori chicken. Ordered chicken bhuna but got something else. Not to mention it was not good to taste. Thanks to our waiter who mistook the order. The peas pulao literally reeked of flavored rose water and was too sweet for our liking.

If that was not enough, we got handed the bill meant for another table. And literally had to Chase the waiter to get the correct bill.

This place was our frequent go to option, close to home. But now with deteriorating food quality and even worse service, we will give it a miss from now on for sure.

I have been visiting this place since childhood and I am a little sad to say that the quality of the food served has dropped a bit in the recent days.
The service needs to be improved along with the food. This place has great potential.Though it is hard to compete with the nearby places which serve quality food.

Since I live nearby, this was our go-to place when we wanted something. But sadly, the quality has deteriorated much from since I was a kid! Result:We no longer rest our hopes on this place!
I still remember there hardly used to be seats, if not prebooked, on Pujo days.
Hope they improve the food quality soon and we can again hop on to this restaurant frequently.

I went there many times and I was a satisfied customer of them. But this time it's pathetic experience. The food was tasteless. We ordered the chili prawn, mixed rice and pan fried chili fish. The prawn was made of rubber, fish was full of bones, but they claimed it's Vetki ( may be they have invented this type vetki with full of bones). We couldn't be able to eat the rice as it had a very bad smell. When I asked them, they replied rudely, "if you don't like the food, don't come here". I'm  shocked with their behaviour. Firstly shocked with their food, then this rude behaviour. It's sure, I'll never go there. I think they don't want to continue their business. I didn't find any negative rating here. So, it's 1 out of 5. Else, it's -100.

Location: Garia

Ambience and decor: a nice and well maintained classical wallpaper decor, soothing ambience, perfect for family and friends

Food: we tried the chinese bit, the greenland chicken seemed wow and awesome, the noodles too was great and made to the best taste, hong kong chicken too had the correct flavour and color

The kebabs were succulent and creamy

My personal favourite would be the vanilla float we got right at the beginning of the menu

Price: moderate costs and something that goes easy with your pockets

Overall verdict: when in garia, u dnt have many options, so its advisable not to miss out on a great option

This place was a craze when they opened back in 2000. But since then the restaurant degraded like anything. This even tanked down with opening of the bar. Not a place to take your family. You can find full drunk out people shouting and arguing with the waiters it's a mess. Food quality is waste. They serve you ages after and you have to just plead the waiters and check if they have not forgotten your order. 

I really feel sorry for this restaurant.

The rating is for the vegetarian food of the restaurant - specially the paneer, vegetable dish and the naans that were ordered.

The quantity of the side dishes is good although the taste and quality is not comparable to those served by better Punjabi restaurants. This restaurant serves drinks as well. Service was prompt.

To sum it up, I had 2 Pudin Haras to digest the food that I regretably ingested. If by chance you get a glimpse of their kitchen on your way, towards the right hand side of the entrance, you may surely reconsider any future visits.

Lets talk about the main business of a restaurant, FOOD! Palki seems to have forgotten that its in the food business and therefore a bare minimum standard needs to be maintained. We ordered a peas pulao and fish nilgiri. The peas pulao tastes very ordinary and the fish was absolute crap. The gravy was tasteless and an utter waste of money. I have had bad food served to me but nothing comes even close to this. AVOID AT ALL COSTS

One of the oldest places out in its locality. Again definitely a place where you should be going when you are pocket concious but... donot want to get satisfied at that cost. The "food venture" did not go well as expected. The first turn down was when I searched for the restaurant over zomato. The place has a bar, but does not have it enlisted, anyway when you approach the place still there is no hint of that till you look up at the signboard as it says some Palki Multicuisine Restaurant then when you are about to finally enter the place at the door it says in a small insignificant metal plate Palki Multicuisine Restaurant cum Bar. After we went in and were seated the next turn down was about to shape up, well this time with the placing of the order. The order was placed for a small whisky and 2 beers, the whisky was there on time but the beer was definitely not at the table for let me think..... the next 30 mins or so !!! Finding no logic behind it the waiter was asked for it, who approached the table with the hell-did-you-order-beer-too attitude. Well at last when we did FINALLY start off with our drinks and I was in a mood to take a drag it was almost impossible to get up from the clumpsy seat. Anyhow after managing to get off with the lousy experience the most weird thing happened when we were about to be billed and can finally leave. Well guess what the billing too was wrong, anyhow the waiter I believe realised the fact and billed us once again. In a nutshell more than a bad experience, it was a weird and funny experience all in all. Definitely word to the management will be "You seriously need to look into whatever is going on in there and if this is what you call a restaurant then I should rather not be in one". And for rest of the people, for the time being this is just not a place which you should put on your wish list.

Palki is one of the oldest restaurants in that area. 

**Location**
Located on the side lanes of the road from the bypass patuli to Garia. Visible from main road.

**Experience**
I have been here on a couple of occasions in past and honestly I quite used to like their Chinese. Usual Chinese dishes like fried rice noodles chilli Chicken is a safe bet according to me. Quantity is decent for two person to share one dish. Recent reviews tells that the food taste was gone down, will visit again to verify that soon.

I don't know how it is still running and not been shut down yet. 
Located at : Patuli/45 bus stand. Single storeyed building.
Pathetic service. They take a long time before bothering to ask for the order. No one seems to care. 
Stale, tasteless food (if you can call it that) 
No hygiene at all. 
Expensive by all means for the kind of food they sell.
Never visiting again.

Once upon a time Palki was the best restaurant in Patuli /Garia area. We used to frequently visit during my school days and even later. But my last experience  was shocking.

Service has become pathetic. We had ordered only three items- Fried rice, a chicken side dish and a fish side dish. They made us wait for all most an hour to serve the food. Finally the food arrived but the fish was smelling.  It is really sad to see how an old restaurant can deteriorate to such an extent. I am not going to take the risk of another visit.

The problem occurred during payment as they said that the credit card pymt was not happening due to "server problem" .....seems they have only 1 bank's pos machine...or else they were trying to avoid card pymt...I am not sure. But we had to pool in cash to manage the payment as we didn't have time to wait.

We have visit this place last week and that was the worst experience and ever. Behavior of the staff was not good at all. I think they serve the biriyani taking out from the fridge because it was dam cold and the chicken in it was as hard as a rubber. Overall not recommend

Maybe the most un hygienic restaurant I have ever been to. The food is of no taste. Once I opted for a takeaway and found flies in a mixed fried rice and hair in the chicken. That was the last time I have ordered food from them. I don't know if any one visit there ..why????

One of the oldest restaurants in garia palki seems to have lost its charm in recent times. This was literally my go to place whenever i longed for Chinese food but given the fact that many new restaurants are coming up in this area , palki's competitive abilities are surely being tested. The place serves alcohol at pretty reasonable rates and my favourite over here is the shredded chicken. The service and the attitude of the staff definitely needs to be improved.

If you are one of those who don't judge a book by its cover and won't miss the ambience or improper table manners as long as the platter is lip smacking then this is your kind of restaurant. The moment you enter the under lit and gloomy ground floor you are welcomed by some tacky and timid decor. Past that the attendants usher you to a table all the while scratching his armpit. Place the order and pray to God for grace and boy does He deliver. The food is so tasty and sumptuous that all other fade away and all you feel is love while cozying up to the place. Do try the pan fried chilly chicken. Bon Appetite!!

visited more than two times. Once celebrated sibling's birthday here. Last visit 2010. ordinarily decorated, plays soft music, air conditioned.  This seemed not a very good place for family dinner. I mean you have better options when you are with family.  A dinner or lunch with friends in here sounds great. Service was always a bit slow. dont know about their chinese dishes but i found their north indian dishes good. Chicken bharta used to be the special attraction of this place those days. Recently, i heard the food quality they used to maintain, fell down.

Don't get influenced by the exterior look of the restaurant as once you enter, it seems like run down bar. The ambience is disgusting. Its nowhere near a family restaurant. The food is below average.  The waiters have no idea what they are serving or any idea of the menu. The price too high.  Don't come.  Save your bucks.

This place is located near to Garia, precisely close to 45bus stand. Few years back the place was quiet famous. I personally feel the place has lost a bit of its glory now due to the increasing number of food joints all around.
The ambience is OK. 
Service is a bit slow.
Food is good. I especially love their kashmiri pulao with mutton gravy dishes. 
Price is reasonable, easy on pocket.

I visited this restaurant for once and i admire the quality of food they serve. The ambience is pretty good but their biggest drawback is its horrible service. The waiters seem so slow and lazy. The starters that we ordered was served after 40 mins which is pretty late. But definitly the food scored high especially pepper chicken and the chinese dishes. They must look into the issue of their delaying service.

Palki restaurant is situated mid-way on the road which runs from Patuli towards 45-bus stand. It is one of the oldest restaurants in the area. Sometime back in the afternoon, me and my mother were passing through this area. It was around 2:45pm and we decided to stop at this restaurant for lunch. 

On entering the restaurant, the first thing that would strike you is the dim lighting. It is extremely dim and when you enter for the first time, it takes time for your eyes to adjust to the dimly lit ambiance. Once we could see, the ambiance did not look very attractive. The tables, chairs, clothing and decor are pretty simple and shabby looking. The sofas and chairs are low and uncomfortable especially for elderly people.

We settled down and called the waiter for order. The behavior of the waiter was good but he did not seem very knowledgable about the dishes and ingrediants. Considering things, we decided to keep it simple and ordered Chicken fried rice, garlic chicken and chilli chicken. While we waited, we  felt unconfortable as the smoke and smell of dishes being cooked in the kitchen wafted to the place where we were sitting. My mother does not like the smell of raw garlic which comes when it is cooked and she had to cover her nose with handkerchief.

When the food were delivered, it was nothing special. In my opinion the fried rice was dry and the curries were too oily and lacked taste.The quantity was good though. When the bill came, I discovered that compared to the pricing the quality of food is not upto the mark. Not at all value for money. I would keep avoiding visiting to this restaurant in future unless the management takes steps to change things for betterment.

Will definitely cut your pockets. So so cooking but 4star price. Paid nearly 80 rupees extra each item compared to the price list available in zomato. Also 14.5% vat and 4.94% service tax extra will definitely cut your purse. Would give 1 star. An extra star just for somewhat consumable items.

It was only last night when we decided to pick up some food on our way back home. Palki was the restaurant that caught our attention as there was no other restaurant in that area. 

It was 9:30 pm and we found the place to be pretty crowded. The ambience is not good with dimly lit lights making the place a bit more dark than it should have been. The sofas and chairs are low and uncomfortable especially for elderly people. The staff were however well behaved. So in all, ambience gets a 1.5/5 from my side.

Now coming to the main aspect, which is food. 
Things we ordered :-
1) Chicken sweet corn soup (2 portions) : The soup was good, nothing extra ordinary though but a better amount of chicken pieces won't be bad. :) 

2) Daal Tadka (Torka) : The oiliest daal I've ever had. It tasted okay-ish. It was  nothing but a mixtures of daals (basically masoor and cholar daal) which was then given 'Tadka' with tomatoes and garlic. It was not at all the punjabi style daal tadka.

3) Chicken reshmi butter masala : Again, the oiliest chicken dish ever consumed by me. Firstly being "reshmi chicken butter masala", the gravy should have been white which it was not. It was purely red and normal chicken pieces were used in the place of chicken reshmi kebabs according to the authentic recipe. However it did not taste bad. 

4) Mutton Biryani : This biryani was over loaded with rose water and hence it did not seem like normal biryani. It was a bit less oily than the previous two dishes. It was accompanied by 1 potato and 2 pieces of mutton. 

The total cheque came upto 890 bucks. Not worth it at all. 

They had put a lot of oil in our dishes inspite of asking them to keep the oil content low. They took more than an hour to prepare our order which was really disgusting. 

Not recommended unless you are around this area and desperately hungry.

Last week me and my friend visited this place after quite some time now. On its early days this one used to be pretty good in terms of food quality. Moreover this restaurant is among the very few around Garia which offers both drinks and a variety of food. But, we were utterly disappointed this time. We went there pretty late at night around 9:30 and thus didn't order any starters. However, we decided to try out two of their side dishes which was garlic and chili chicken. We took a plate of them each and two bowls of chicken fried rice. The rice lacked taste as if it was just steamed rice with raw vegetables over it and the garlic chicken's taste was also on the lower side. The other one was just okay type. Though they looked good they weren't cooked well enough but the quantity was good. I would say compared to pricing the quality of food is not something to mention about. The ambiance is also not up to the mark and is a bit shabby and the service there is just pathetic. There was a family who left just after we arrived and their table was just beside where we sat and through out our course there weren't a single guy who cared to take away the used plates. All the staff there remain busy chattering among themselves and doesn't pay any heed to any customers' orders. The food quality has deteriorated a lot since I visited it some time back.

So my friends and I decided to walk in here since it's pretty close to my place and plus it serves alcohol. 
So we ordered 3 half tandoori chicken and beer. 
Well it didn't take much time to serve food, plus the service and staff were good. 
Coming to the food. 
Half tandoori chicken costs about 160 which is pretty normal , it was finely cooked and came along with salad and hari chutney. 
Food wasn't actually bad, considering I was apprehensive about trying out this place. 
Not the best tandoori chicken but it was just fine. 
One major turn off was the crowd around ! It was insanely cheap. So DO NOT go there with family you don't wanna land up in some awkward situation. The bill came around 1000 something. Which was okay.

this is one of the very few options in garia area for both food+alcohol. location is good with no problem with parking space. interior is ok, nothing fancy, they have many tables though in a small area. food price and alcohol price is reasonable, no complain with that. coming to the food quality - this is the area that they need to improve. in my multiple visits, i tried fish finger (fish quality was not good), pan fried chilli chicken (pieces were good, too much spicy), drums of heaven (chicken within was very less), fish tikka (good), chicken tandoori (tasted good, but served cold), chicken reshmi kabab (good). so, it seems their tandoori items were better than chinese items. another area of concern of delay to take order after you have your seat. it took almost 15mins to attend us and take our order every time i visited palki. also, serving time is long too. staff were friendly and polite though.
i would not recommend this if you are looking for an exotic dinner on weekend nights. it can be mostly used when you don't have any other option or want to dine close to your home (if you stay in garia area).

Palki was one of the very first standard restaurants around this area. It used to have a good menu, good food, service and it pulled hoards of people. 
However, this cannot be said for now as well. 
This was the place where I first had crispy chilly baby corn and fell in love with the dish.. And fell hard! 
The Indian food used to be good and the Chinese fair was delectable as well. 

With time our visits eventually stopped here because my parents weren't fond of this place as much as I used to be, but I made sure to order home deliveries once in a while. 
However, when I visited here recenty I was highly disappointed. The place was stinking literally, the waiters were very unprofessional and the food- oh my god, what has happened to the place which served my favorite baby corn? The baby corn sucked. 
This place has just become one of the over priced restaurants which serves bad food and has over smart waiters. The walls are broken and damped and the sofas are uncomfortable too. 

In short- do not step in here unless you're left with no other options.

One of the most over priced restaurants i have been to.Perhaps it is only for those who need a bar.Foods are very inconsistent and on weekends the waiters seem to be doing us a favor by serving foods.Thosewho have never been there may visit it once to challenge their luck.A serious no no from me.

Palki restaurant is located at a 10 min walking distance from my place. The way this restaurant has always managed to garner extremely  negative reviews on a consistent basis has actually been a deterrent for me from trying this place even once, until today. I had planned to order some very basic stuff like biriyani and a chicken side dish to go alongside for home delivery, but was told that they do not have home delivery service available on weekends !!!!! And I was told their biriyani is so much in demand always that I should place an order before 9 pm to have a plate !!!!Anyways I decided to order mixed fried rice with manchurian chicken and almost reluctantly had to go myself to pick it from there. The wait seemed longer than due but ultimately the food arrived and the fried rice was decent. This was by no means even close to the best fried rice I have ever had..but had generous amounts of chicken prawn and eggs in it, the quantity seemed good..taste was okayish. Same goes for Manchurian Chicken. I am pretty amazed the way the place is bad mouthed because the food actually didn't seem that bad for I had the misfortune of having been to much worse places and much much worse food in few other places. This place at least deserves an average rating and I will be more than happy to give this place its due 3.0 rating. Certainly food quality and ambiance has lots of scope for improvement.

I don't know what happened to this restaurant in recent years. Way back in the first half of 21st century, this place was rolling quite smoothly. It was the only decent restaurant in Patuli area. Service and food both were good. Previously they served similar kinds of platter, but then they revised it. I think that they might need to overhaul. Considering how immensely competitive restaurant business has now become, I need them to be back in their golden age, need them to evolve. Maybe a major change in their management style.

This restaurant is located right next to the 45 bus stand in Garia on the Garia- Patuli connector. The lok and feel of the gate would seem as if you are into a roller-coaster ride of an amusement park. However, once you enter, you will feel the ambience to be a bit dull. The work "BAR" mostly describes this place than a family restaurant. The staff is ill-mannered, uneducated and very unpolite. We ordered chicken biriyani for 6 person which while serving came to 2 and the rest were made up by mutton biriyani. Packaged water is of a local brand which is marked at Rs.30/- having a printed prce of Rs.18/-. Chingri r malaikari tasted stale and the chicken butter masala was not that great. The waiters further didnot serve teh food for which a service tax was charged in the bill. there is no provision of finger bowl concept. Credit card was not accepted. Only debit card of SBI and HDFC were accepted. Overall bad food, bad decor, bad ambience. A strict No-No!

Bad food, bad service, moderate ambiance. Nothing much to say about this place except that try to avoid being here. Located close to 45 bus stand this place serves many cuisines but none very good. There is a Azad Hind Dhaba nearby at patuli. Avoid Palki and go there for better food. I don't even feel like writing much about this place. So signing off.

Avoid It !!! The place is small , cramped. The food is very average. The staff is inattentive and service is very very slow. However this doesnt end there. The food is hugely overpriced for the quality and even suffers from poor quantity as well. 

Overall, pathetic place. Avoid it under every circumstances!!!!

It was about 5 years ago. We were returning from pandal hopping and i begged my parents for a dinner outing. They said it was getting late at night. So we reached a middle point by going to the restaurant and packing the food. I was naturally excited as i returned home. We had order fried rice and chicken kasha. The rice tasted like steamed rice with no flavour whatsover. the gravy of the chicken was burnt and the pieces of chicken were too aweful choices. Nowadays I always see revies of unknown restaurants I wish to try in zomato first. I dont want a Palki experience

Had takeout from there recently. Bad food. Tasted like cheap spice powder, lots of it. Could not eat more than half. And the food was quite expensive. 500/- for two items. Dinner for two would have been 700+. Not recommending anyone to go there.

Pathetic food. Pathetic service.
They will give you manual bill for drinks (challan)
And they will charge tax on that & take. If chased they will say the printer not working & will refund the tax.

Most worthless restaurant ever went.

Only it helps in giving locations

Food quality & quantity is good. But agreed with Aritro, staff is very lazy. But if you want to spend lot of time with friends & alcohol, then this is the right place for you. In other bars they always want you to finish ur food & drinks as quickly as possible.

Well this place near patuli thana.i ve been there several times.

About FOOD: food was not bad.tandoori chicken is a catch. Though the tengri kebab tasted like sweet dish. Naans were soft and nice.over all the food rating can be 3out of 5.

let's talk about AMBIANCE and STUFF: one word,HORRIBLE. They are too slow,even if they just standing beside you they wont take your order,they only concentrate on those tables where there are more people,even the manager does not say anything if you complain,once i ordered for my bill,which took 20 minutes to come.so not a good place to eat.

As it is close by so i visit sometimes,but NOT a good place.
