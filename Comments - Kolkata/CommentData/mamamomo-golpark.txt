After a long time, we got the oppurtunity to witness a new place that serves some real good home made style juicy momos at the most reasonable.

Specially the quantity and and quality is amazing and soup taste great and with their special organic Dal-leh sauce these momos are must try. For every momo lover this place is must!! must!! vist.

They also serve native kebabs from Nepal called “ Seekhwa” they looked yum and right now they are on my bucket list for next visit.

Below are few pics from Chicken and Veg steam momos from my trial and the soup along with Dal-leh sauce.
