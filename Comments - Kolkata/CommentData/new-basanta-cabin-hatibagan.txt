Its a heritage restaurant in Hatibagan Area. I always love to visit them. They are far better to have some crunch in choice of Rolls, Chowmin or fries than visiting any other roll corner.

Being the resident of North Calcutta I am highly fascinated of the old renowned eateries. I have tried Moghlai paratha ample of time. Only the glitch which I think they should look upon is the infrastructure of the restora .ðŸ˜Š

In search of a very pocket friendly restaurant near Hatibagan area I ended up here once. Prices seemed to be low, but the quality wasn't good at all. I think there are many Chinese restaurants in Kolkata which serves much better Chicken Chowmine that they serve for Rs.100 and also has a decent seating arrangement which this place lacked.
The Noodles quality wasn't good, and it had very less amount of Chicken in it.
Not recommend.

Well, as the name suggests, it's a cabin, not a restaurant. If you keep that in mind, there will be not much to complain about. If you are short in budget (as we college students often are), go there. You will come out with a full stomach without having to empty your pocket entirely. Food quality is average, don't expect anything miraculously great.

Went once just for it's name...
Ate moglai paratha there...
And it was tasty... I liked it... Price is cheap...
But the place is not hygienic.. and the plate, spoon in which they served paratha were very oily and not properly washed...

This is a historic name in college street area. I dropped in a few times. You will mostly get the different street foods here the chowmein and moglai being the most popular item. The food quality is pretty ordinary. You can drop in if you have no other options or if you are running low on money.

Old calcutta and dingy, dim lit  (yet legendary in their own ways) eateries are almost synonymous. Basanta cabin is one such place and having been a bethune college student Basanta has been visited by me several times. Never did I think that I would review that place but then today I came across Basanta on zomato and was like WHAT!! anyways so getting to the point, the food is good (specially the chicken hakka noodles and chicken fried rice). The quantity that they serve in one portion might require 2 to 3 people with normal apetite  to finish it all off. But you cannot expect to have a high class ambience and superb presentation on food.

Basanti Cabin is an epic name among the restaurants in Kolkata. The word "Cabin" has been used for a lot of old places in the city as the sitting arrangement was actually done in somewhat that style.

**Location**
Located at the Hedua Crossing. Beside Blossom restaurant.

**Experience**
Though the name is quite familiar to the old foodies but not known to new generation that much as because these places are loosing their popularity for growing competition. There is nothing much about their decor or looks. Plain old school style usual Kolkata fast food is available such as chowmin ,moghlai Paratha , fish fry etc. Along with some very own touched Chinese gravies to accompany those.

Had dropped in here few times a couple of years back. Located at Hedua Crossing beside Blossom's, this is an age old eating place. Economical prices but the food quality isn't up to the mark. I remember trying Moghlai and Noodles, both of them were pretty ordinary. A decent option for youngsters from Scottish and Bethune, but for people living far, absolutely no reason to drop by here.

New Basanta Cabin is an old food joint located   at Hedua just beside blossom. They serve Indian, Chinese dishes and with fast food. 
Tried Moglai Paratha here. It seemed pretty good to me and even my not-so-moglai-loving friend also appreciated it.

I have heard that the legendary Uttam Kumar had his meals here-I was too intrigued to visit it one day,when lectures had drained our stomach and minds.Not a good ambience and poorly maintained.But thats for all North Kolkata outlets,I mean most of them(No Offence).The Chowmein we ordered was dripping with palm oil,with bits of chicken there and here.The place is shabby and smells bad.However,the food was average.It is one of the places where you would go in when you are famished,and both Fatso's and Blossoms are shut.

Had heard a lot about it from my father...during college days he used to visit this place....so when I found this place in hatibagan near hedua park I got intrigued and went there. The interiors are shabby...there were few loud people and 1 couple who seemed to be college goers sharing a plate..overall the ambience was not lively and was uninteresting... the menu card didn't gave us too many options to choose from..only thing we can find out is chicken chowmin so ordered it...
The food quality was like esplanade Street food and the water they provided was also not hygienic. .
My experience is not good and won't try such restaurants in North kolkata any more

After killing their old reputation,in order to imitate others they changed their menu card,which at least successfully driven away their old customers!! I don't know why they sell chinese....at least the worker should pronounce or even could read the name of the foods!!! One should not make any comments about the quality,about the oily tables,dirty cups,unhealthy hands and farness atmosphere inside.Boy oh boy!! had I told about their 1st floor mistry?....200 rs, 2 items, cold drinks and 1hr time in a curtained cubicle!!!
