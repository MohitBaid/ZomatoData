My experience at Tiretti by Tak Heng has been really good. The food is bound to be liked by all chinese lovers, be it the noodles, rice or chicken dishes. However, the best dish i liked there was their steamed momos, amazingly juicy and delightfully full of minced meat. I wish they delivered to my home, would have ordered the momos every week!
The decor of the restaurant is pretty low profile, compared to their high quality food. Would have loved it more then

A little restaurant serving Chinese delicacies. I was here with my sister to have breakfast. We ordered for fish ball soup and chicken fried wontons. Both were very good. A nice place for good food and definitely pocket friendly.

1. The restaurant wasn't clean. Smelt like hair. Should've got out when we could but hunger trumped all. 

2. The food was underwhelming, cold. What also left me cold were the prices. The actual Tiretti would be half the price and many many times the yums. 

3. Service was really weird. When I complained about the noodles being served stone cold, he says it's because they were boiled... They weren't pleased about reheating everything. It didn't make it taste any better. It was, overall, an awful experience.

One of the best pork momos in Kolkata. The best part is that it you can actually get it for breakfast in this part of the city. Another point which I'd like to make is that this place far outshines its namesake area in our city famed for the legendary oriental breakfasts. The individual momo portions are a bit small in size and can do with some improvement on this part (keeping the prices the same).

Being a religious pork lover I'd love to see a few more pork options prepared in authentic Sth Est Asian style.. Keep up the good work team Tirettiüëç

Located in the lanes of Southern Avenue near Vivekananda Park this place is excellent for having a lavish Chinese breakfast in the morning. If you don't like pork and only eat chicken they think twice before going there as the Chicken items are not that good the chicken Momo's are average too.We went there to try out their breakfast items ;tried 2 types of Bao(CHICKEN and PORK),veg wantons, chicken and Pork Momo's,Fish Ball soup (it was refreshing), Green tea, konjee (served with egg and roasted pork) and Hongkon style kao Pao.
Amongst all I loved the Pork Bao
Pork Momo
And Pork konjee

TIRETTI was earlier known as Tak Heng and it used to be one of my favourite Chinese joints in South Kolkata. After renaming the place it was my first visit here where the monthly meet was organised by Foodzpah. Around 20 people gathered around a table on a rainy Sunday morning gorged on some early morning breakfast delicacies inspired by the Tiretti Bazaar breakfast. We had - 
Fish Ball Soup 
Fried Wontons 
Steamed Pork Bao 
Hong Kong Style Baked Chicken Kao Pao
Konjee Rice with Roasted Pork 
Steamed Pork Momos 
All of the items were good except the konjee rice. It tasted like fyana bhaat that only kids and patients are fed. And for the wontons, they were too oily. Rest were well and good. 
Need to come here again to try out their main course delicacies and write more about it.

Had been there on a rainy day accompanied by quite a few friends for breakfast. The place was small, but quite decent looking and clean. 

Since we were a large group, we decided to order quite a few stuff.

‚óè Fish Ball Soup
‚óèChar Siu Bao Chicken
‚óèSteamed Chicken Momo
‚óèRice Congee with Chicken and Egg
‚óèFried Veg Wanton
‚óèGinger Ale

The soup was not something i liked due to the way the fish was cooked. The exterior of the Bao tasted fine, but the chicken inside was not to my liking. The star of the show were the momos. Amazingly soft with enough chicken inside. The wantons were good too. The congee was fine, but nothing I would like to have in a restaurant. 

Service was top notch and the owner was more than happy to serve us even on a rainy morning.

Went there to have breakfast with my fellow foodies on a sunday morning. Located in a lane beside the Vivekananda Park in Souther Avenue this place is not very spacious with limited seating arrangements and minimal decorations. Our menu was elaborate and consisted of the following - 
1. Fish Ball Soup - a clear soup with balls of fish in it. The soup was light and tasty but didn't like the fish balls much. 
2. Char Siu  Bao Pork - the pork filling was very tasty. 
3. Hong kong style Baked Chicken kao Pao - A stuffed chicken bun. It tasted really good.  
4. Steamed Pork Momos - melt in the mouth momos with amazing pork fillings. Was a bit apprehensive to try it at first but after taking the first bite I was transported to somewhere else, it was that good. 
5. Rice Congee with Roasted Pork and Egg - am must try dish from this place. The taste was really very good. 
There was fried veg wantons and green tea as well. 
My favourites fromm all of these were steamed pork momos and rice conjee with roasted pork and egg. Will visit the place again for trying out their other offerings. üòä

Went there to have breakfast with my fellow foodies and i wasnt disappointed by their servings. Located in a lane beside Vivekananda Park, this place is not too big nor too fancy. Decorated was quite good. We had green tea,fish ball soup, wantons, chicken and pork momo, rice konjee and roasted chicken/pork with egg,green tea, pork/ chicken bao and hong kong style chicken kao pao. Each and every pork dishes were great. Infact i loved the pork dishes over the chicken ones. My favourites were soup, momos, pork bao and the green tea. Had a hearty breakfast there. Will visit again for sure.

A great place to hang out with friends. Some of the items here will remind you of your childhood whereas some items will make you fall in love with the place itself. It's a soothing and peaceful place both on its outer looks and interior feels. Service is awesome. Cooking is to the point especially the momos. A must visit.

This place is located near Tyagraj Hall on Raja Basanta Roy Road. The place is small and the decor is not that great. Even the ambiance is not too good. We visited the place on a Tuesday night for dinner. We started off with some Pork Wanton Soup followed by Chilly Garlic Pepper Prawns and then Dry Chilly Chicken. For Mains we ordered the Cantonese styled Pan Fried Gravy Noodles (Mixed) and the Hamei Fish. I love Chinese food and the food was delicious. It is for that reason that I gave this place 3.5 otherwise it would have been 3.0. We wanted to try out some desserts but we were told that they did not even have a scoop of ice-cream. The menu had various dessert options but they had none to serve in reality. We had ordered a bottle of Coke (as that was the only option available) so we decided to have another one as they could not serve us dessert. On asking for another bottle we were told that they did not have any more Coke to serve. So no desserts and no second round of Coke. After we had finished our delicious meal we wanted to pay by card. At time time, after we had finished our full meal, we were informed that the card machine might not work and it did not. Thankfully we had some cash so we were able to pay the bill. This is something that they should mention at the very start that payment by card might not be available. The food was amazing but the overall experience was truly unforgettable but not in a pleasant way. Would definitely try this place as the food is great but next time maybe home delivery!

I had heard so much about the fish ball soup and the roast pork here that I absolutely made it a point to not miss them during my short stay in Calcutta. Unfortunately, this is the third time in five days that I've been trying to order from this restaurant. And every single time it has been declined. I don't know whether the restaurant itself is at fault here or Zomato. But I must say I'm terribly disappointed with the service. And I'm almost certain that I don't even want to try and order from Tiretti any more. Because I'm quite sure what the outcome is going to be. Again.

Update:

After having a conversation with the management where I was notified that they are out of bikers for the last 10 days, I suggested that they keep their online order option closed since they won't be able to deliver, a thing you would believe they would have done long back. Anyway, the management replied by skirting the issue and telling me that Swiggy WAS offering a discount as well. I don't see how it helps me because Zomato IS offering a discount right now.¬†
So 2.5 hours later I went back to their restaurant page to find out whether they have closed the online order service, but they hadn't. Curious to know what would happen, I ordered again. And you guessed right, it was rejected again!¬†As customers we spend we spend a lot of time deciding upon the restaurant to order from, selecting from the menu, making the payment and waiting for the confirmation and consequent delivery of the food. I would say it's fairly irresponsible and inconsiderate of a management to take its customers' time and energy for granted. A random case or two here and there are aberrations, but it certainly shouldn't be the norm day after day after day. When they know they won't be able to deliver food for the lack of bikers for the last TEN days, I see no reason why their online order is still open, even after the issue was addressed.

Ok... So this is the least I have ever rated a food joint. But what happened has not happened only once but twice and I completely am sure now that the food here is not hygeinic. My friend and I had hot n sour soup and some chicken. The soup was extremely hot and I had ask them to make the soup milder which they did. But he chicken tasted a little off. Well next day both my friend and I suffered from acute food poisoning and we are still suffering. The food was definitely stale and caused instant reaction. This happened once before but I had given them a benefit of doubt. But no more !!
I don't recommend at all !!

The moment first visited this hidden gem, instantly fall in love with it and the affair continues.First things first, although they renovated the place recently still it's not a place to have a posh dining experience.Rather if you really love authentic chinese and thai food at a reasonable price,this is the place to be.Been there multiple times and the highly recommend to try their sea food.They make amazing crab dishes which is the freshest in town( they know there vendors, believe me).Another of there speciality is the roasted chilli pork which if you are lucky enough,you can customise( more lean meat and less fat...voala!!)There wantons are as good as the famous tung naam of chattawala galli( as far as I know the owner trained the chef from there).They recently came up with the chinese breakfast menu and changed the name from take heng to tiretti by TAK HENG.The all day breakfast menu is as good as the original place but my recommendation go there and order chilli garlic crab and dry roasted chilli pork or chicken any day and pair it with thai soup and for staples go for yum min.Althogh nowadays all of their knowledgeble staff was moved to their premium branch,calcuta stories and the service is a letdown but for good food one can wait.This small ventures trying to provide authentic food with reasonable price should be encouraged.Keep up the good work guys.

This was a great find! After decades did I get to eat Chinese the way it should taste & of what I remember was there during my childhood in Kolkata.
We tried the wanton, momo, soup, pan fried noodle, roast chilly pork & a special dessert. All were of a great taste.
The ambience is that of a good neighborhood good chinese restaurant in china with minimalistic but right props.
Keep it up!

What is the first thing that flashes in front of your eyes the moment you hear Tiretti? Well for any true Kolkata‚Äôbashi‚Äô it has to be the buzzing, not-so-clean Chinese Bazar dishing up authentic comfort Chinese breakfast in Poddar Court area. Soups, momos, home made sauces and noodles- you name it they have it. Unfortunately for lazy folks like me it is often not possible to catch the deliciouness at the strict ‚ÄòCINDERELLA HOURS‚Äô of 5am to 8-30 PM!!! JAnd this is the exact reason why Tiretti By Tak Heng was on my wishlist for quite sometime now.I was invited for a dinner along with some wonderful fellow food enthusiasts of the city to this place.
                                                                ...

Normally a big fan of Tak Heng, yesterday I was very very disappointed. The food I ordered was quite unpalatable. The chicken chowmein had no chicken or veggies and was quite tasteless. The burnt garlic chicken fried rice was the same. The only thing that was not too bad was the pork rice rice, which was wrongly labelled. The pork main dish had no pork, only a flour coating. The sweet and sour chicken was completely under seasoned. Very very disappointed.

The typical true blue overly nostalgic¬†Bong¬†was happy to sample the food at Tiretti by Tak Heng and why not especially when the old style Chinese food at Tiretta Market is now nothing but history. I will for sure share the present¬†status of the Chinese eateries¬†at Tiretta Market sometimes in near future but this post is meant for the new Chinese Restaurant with the old flavors in the city of joy, Tiretti by Tak Heng.¬†As it is quite understandable from the name itself, the owner has given special thought while naming and even while planning the menu, and interior to add every possible glimpse of the China town joints. The Cozy Chinese eatery is located at Raja Basanta Roy Road and I was invited there to sample the delicious Chinese spread along with a group of food bloggers from Kolkata. The interior matching with the name, no fuss with the minimal¬†but required decor. The only thing I found a little odd is the mismatch of the cutleries and plastic glasses, however, those were not looking bad given they wanted to present the homely charm I guess like a typical old-age China town eatery and in fact, I found the service also on the same line. A bit casual may be intentional carelessness of the servers was just like we used to see in the old eateries.

Ordered from here and the food is definitely very very close to that available at Tiretti Bazaar. The Chicken Hamei and the Pokchoi were well done, Yam Mein was good too. The Bao, although ordered for dinner does fit the bill as a very apt breakfast item. The momos were a delight. The food was all in all packed with the right amount of flavours and thus produced the right taste.... a taste that only good culinary skills can produce. So, kudos to them and I sincerely wish that they keep up the good work.

We ordered a pork steamed momo and pork meatball soup. You would think that something as simple as this which you can get at most restaurants would be the safest dishes to go with,but you would be proven wrong the very moment you open the box of momos which are smelly and there is nothing  about them that makes them good ,they don't look good,the meat is dry,they are not juicy and just covered in oil. The momos were very bad but the meatball soup was on a whole different level,they could not even hold themselves together .when you lifted them on your spoon, which should be very easy, since the only thing you can taste is cornflour. my dog was the only one who managed to eat a full meatball but he eats everything you can think of .
Conclusion:bad food .would never order again and suggest you do the same
Final rating: -50

What do you do when you are craving for some good, old Tangra style Chinese but do not feel like venturing to the shady lanes of the city's Chinatown, replete with muddy ditches and unending queues in front of all the popular eateries? No, you do not sit at home and sulk. You hit this new place in the peaceful neighborhood of Southern Avenue and eat to your heart's content. At least that's what I will do!

The Fish Ball Soup here is excellent, with three fluffy chitol balls. I had this with a Pork Bao. And I was forced to wonder how comforting a combination this will be in winters. The Prawn hargao and the pot-stickers met our expectations easily, but the Spare Pork Ribs exceeded my expectations by miles. It was a joy to see the tender meat literally falling off the bone. 

The main course is a replica of the Chinese that most Calcuttans have grown up with. The Pan fried noodles had the perfect mix of soft and crispy noodles in a subtly smoky sauce. The meal ended with yet another favourite of yesteryears, the Tutti Fruity. 

In all, it was a happy meal for me and I will surely go back to this place with my family for the simole yet beautiful food that this place offers.

P.S. Tiretti by Tak Heng may not offer cheap booze by the bottle, but it does offer a kick-ass Ginger Ale and the Ice-cream Soda sure to tickle the nostalgic soul.

We were invited for the newly introduced breakfast menu at Tiretti by Tak Heng . This outlet is located where the earlier Tak Heng was there- near Tyagraj Hall, Raja Basanta Roy Road. Whereas, the original and once-famed chinese breakfast at Poddar Court has steadily gone towards becoming shitty, this joint has done a phenomenal job in reviving the classics. The fish Ball soup and Pork Bao were fantastic, wherein Prawn sargow (a thin skin momo with supposedly whole prawns inside) was a revelation.

And the Cotton's IceCream Soda and Ginger Ale are something not to be missed.

Overall, recommended. P.S: It is an all day breakfast available from 730 AM on all days except Monday.

Restaurant is always giving a new excuse and strangely enough gives out different versions to the customer and the one to Zomato.

Rightly named tiretti as it brings out the flavours of the ethnic Chinese cuisine from the the base tiretti Bazar area of Calcutta. I had their chicken bao and yam mein pork noodles. Although there are many outlets serving chicken bao lately but this one is more fulfilling. Packed with right kind of flavours test, it is good for the appetite of one person. The yam mein pork noodles was a delight. Tasty and healthy authentic Chinese noodles topped with pork and vegetables. Try this if you want real authentic Chinese.

OLD SCHOOL INDO-CHINESE AT AFFORDABLE PRICES. From the kitchen of Tiretti bazaar they have imported and recreated some of their delicacies.
We decided to go for Chicken Hamchoy and Chicken fried rice. The chicken slices were cooked in a mild garlicy gravy with kolmi greens. It went well with the fried rice and a gave a tribal feel.
Ambience was okayish. Service was cordial. But they should improve their cutlery.

My uncles house happen to be in b b ganguly st which is just a walking distance from tiretti market which is all so famous for the chinese breakfast they serve. As a child i had been there several times. As i grew up my morning began to start at 8:00 and thus my chinese breakfast seemed like a distant dream. Not any more though. Although not for breakfast almost with a sense of childish excitement me and my wife went there on a sudden dinner date. We ordered the quintessential chinsese bun, noodles and a strange yclept chicken dish. The food was typically tirreti bazaar flavour which was delightful. I m so happy my fish bowl soup and chicken bao is just a phone call away. I wish they tie up with swiggy soon.

I went there since its in my neighborhood and the name and sign board attracted me. 
I have been having momos in Sambhunath Pandit Street since 1984 when no one had even heard of them. 
I ordered for chicken momos but was disappointed on two counts. First an authentic momo is always freshly prepared and steamed. Here they were made earlier and we're just reheated hence the outer layer of flour was brittle and not soft. Secondly there was no momo sauce. I was given the normal sauces that are used in Chinese dishes. The momo sauce is a different sauce and the momos taste very different with it. 
The taste of momos was good though the authenticity was missing.

'Tiretti by Tak Heng' is the newest addition in the Chinese food scrnario of Kolkata. It is located in Raja Basanta Roy road just a few steps away from Tyagraj hall.

We went here yesterday at 6.30 pm. We called the shop beforehand to know if it was open or not. The interior of the shop was spacious and could accomodate nearbout 30 people.The chairs were very cozy. 

We ordered one chicken fried momo first. The food came within five minutes.The momos were delicious but the there could have been more filling inside. Next,we ordered one Chicken hakka noodles and one Kung Pao Chicken. The Chicken hakka noodles was delicious and was filled with chicken chunks and vegetables. The Kung Pao Chicken was the star of the show. It went well with the chicken hakka noodles. It had cashew in it which added to the favour of the item.

The staff was well behaved and amiable.All in all,a great experience and we will visit again.

Chinese Food At It's Best...........

Tiretti by Tak Heng is a restaurant which serves mainly Chinese dishes, located at Southern Avenue.

They provide both dine in & home delivery facility.

Moderately spaced for around 30-35 people.

Simple homely ambience with Chinese props all around as decor.

What is most appealing here is their food. We went in a food tasting event with fellow bloggers and tried the following items- 

1)Dry chilli pork
2)Chicken steam momo
3)Schezwan beetroot momo 
4)Chicken Wanton fried
5)Pan fried Chicken Momo
6)Plain Bao
7)Hamchoi chicken
8)Hamei pork 
9)Chilli Garlic pepper fish
10)Chicken pan fried noodles.

All dish were in their best form and cooked realy well. The star of the day were Dry Chilli pork, Chicken Wanton fried, Hamei Pork & Chilli Garlic pepper fish. Highly recommended.üòòüòòüòòüòò

Service is prompt. Staffs were well behaved. 

Pocket pinch is pocket friendly.

Quantity of food provided is sufficient.

A place not to miss for people who loves Chinese dishes.

Highly recommended........

Thanks Rajdeep Da for your invitation.

Chinese food is something which no one can‚Äôt ignore,even i am big fan of Chinese dishes.right now there are over hundreds of restaurant in our city which serves Chinese dishes.but whenever comes to authentic & traditional Chinese dishes i always prefer to eat at Tak Heng restaurant.recently they relaunched the place where once upon a time Tak Heng there,a all new restaurant known by ‚ÄúTIRETTI by Tak Heng‚Äù.for those people who tried the foods of Tak Heng for them a must visit place and for those who didn‚Äôt yet tried the mouth-watering foods prepared by the Chef.located in Southern Avenue area for about 5 mins walking distance near Raja Basanta Roy Road.decoarated perfectly with the lighting effects along with different types of wallpapers which decorated this place beautifully.around 30-35 people can seat & eat at a time.i went there over a food tasting session with my fellow foodie friends.a newly joint but still i was pretty much sure the foods they will serve here it will be extraordinary.apart from the dine-in section there are home delivery option also available.well coming back to foods they served us different types of starters along with main course.
                                          ...
