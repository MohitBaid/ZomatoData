So had visited this restaurant in Tangra named as Kim Ling. 

Restaurant view - The building looks a Little shabby from the exterior side, and from the interior end you can see two sections one for men(looks a typical men bar place) and the other section is for family(looks up to the mark) 

Staff review- Unexpectedly the staffs are snooty ,arrogant and throws attitude to customers.

Overall - The food is good and tasty. 

Crispy Chilli Babycorn- It's little different from that of babycorn we usually eat. It's usually small corns tossed in sauce but here it was fried corns with onions which was okayish.

Szechuan chicken(dry)-it was tasty and filling and the tangy taste was apt

Overall a must try but the staff have to work a lot.

Food is not bad.
Delivery on time.
Cleanliness is needed more.
Value for money. For a perfect dinner it will cost around 1500 for two. Good place for chilling with old friends and spending time.

It’s the first restaurant I ever dined in so it holds a special place in my heart ! But without bias, this is one of the only restaurants which has held on to it’s standards still. I love their Dry Chilli Chicken and their Cantonese Noodles which are a must try along with Chilli Pepper Prawn and Golden Fried Prawns. This place is a must visit ! Enjoy !

Actually there are 2 parts to this restaurant.
One is the main hall and the other is a small hall mainly meant for Family dining.
The table service is quite slow but its worth the wait as the food here is quite good.
Also this place is cost-effective as well as worth the wait for the food
I would suggest chicken crispy or golden fried prawns as a starter and then go for any main course.

Definitely the best place for an amazing feast! Beautiful dishes served consistently and the noteworthy items being - Cantonese Chow, Fried Rice, Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken, Drums of Heaven, Crispy Fish, Chilli Chicken. The staff is so well behaved and helpful that they add on to the want of coming back again. My go-to place for more than 10 years.

Resturant offers good food at fair price, I could have ended up with a rating of 10 out of 10, but Couldn't. We were a group of 4 people, visited this place friday afternoon. We started having food at 4.30 and continued till 6.15 or so. When you meet your old buddies, you don't only eat right? You try to have a life long experience as well. Resturant was half full around 6pm and staff's started giving us wired look,and used all means to let us know -if we could leave the place. Our billed amount was 4.5k, which is not at all a small amount. We didnt order a fresh lime soda and spend a whole hour rather we ordered food and gave them good business.
Unfortunately uneducated staff's couldn't make it.
I am a frequent visitor of Aarsalan park circus. This place is always full but their staff's don't behave in this way. Another example is Opium of Sector 5, where staff's remain courteous and generous even after you stopped ordering.

Anyway, I wont visit this place again, and won't suggest someone to visit this place. Now a days lot of better options have come up in and around Kolkata, let's go for it leaving dying China town of Kolkata.

I had dinner with my family tonight, food was really good but the ambiance was horrible. We were in the last room (family room),already there was another 2 family, one group was around 15 person,there were feeling just like having food in there home, shouting rather screaming, pushing the chairs while moving, using horrible languages just like 'Machhi Bazar' & lot of things which can not be expressed but the Kim Ling Management was silent as 15 persons bill would not be that bad amount rather concern of the customer may not be their headache.
Previously we been there couple of times but this time we got new experience from Kim Ling.
In future anyone would like to go Kim Ling, pls do not go with your family,you will embarrasse yourself.

Kimling is an excellent example of how dynasty fails over the time. It was one of our most preferred destination at China town. Last Monday it was a family visit on the eve of my wifes birthday . 
She was fond of the starter at this place and always used to ask me to stop by this place to have the starter specially sauted Drumstick. 

On this occasion also we ordered Chili garlic pepper chicken, prawn wafer , drumstick both sauteed and fried, chili chicken dry.
But apart from Chili garlic pepper chicken all tasted so bad and even the main course fried rice and gravy item too.

Couple of months back we were there on weekends that  time also food was not upto the standard and we thought that might be because of weekend rush. But this time we were totally disappointed. And might be the last visit to this plae atleast for next couple of years.

Visited the place during my brother's birthday. The family space inside in not a spacious one. The room looks congested once people start coming in. We were six people and sat on a table for 8. We ordered for Button Mushroom, Crispy Fish, Prawn pakora, Chili Garlic Pepper Chicken and prawn chips. The dishes came one by one by after a long delay. The taste and the presention were good but the way of serving and the service was pretty disappointing. We ordered for the main course - Mixed Fried rice, Mixed Noodles, Cantonese Chicken, Chili Fish and Prawn tossed in oyster sauce with veggies. The taste did not disappoint me but they did not have the option of adding mushroom in fried rice and the rice was little less fried, plus my cousin wanted a bowl to eat rice which wasn't available. At last, since, it was my brother's birthday he wanted to have soup. So we ordered for Chicken clear mushroom soup. The soup was very tasty. 
It was overall a good experience.
A little tip would be, to make the family a bit spacious and the staff to be a bit more courtesious.

If you want waiters burping so loudly that it echoes or if you're looking out to poison someone with 'maida' this is the place to be. Clearly the food is way worse than a roadside Chinese stall and the only you taste is soya and maida in EVERYTHING. When I asked for the manager I was told that he only comes in the evening. No wonder this place is so shabby! NEVER go there.

Kim Ling is one of the oldest eateries in this locality, second only to Mr. Lee's Eating House. I have been here on earlier occasions but the festive season calls in for huge demand which results to low performance. Hope they are better on any regular day!
The starters will never fail to appeal you. We began with spicy Drums of Heaven and Chilli Pepper Garlic Fish. Perfect crispy crunch adds on to these well-marinated delicacies! Hugely recommended.
The Lung Fung soup was a disappointment. Excess of starch spoiled this egg-drop beauty. If they had cared for the perfect viscosity of the texture, the ingredients would not have worked anything less than a wonder.
Rice Noodles were regular. Chilli Garlic Fried Rice was a disaster with less chilli and vanishing garlic. The grains demanded proper coat of oil and spices.
Chicken in green pepper sauce is nothing but an overstatement. This is simply mediocre Szechuan Chicken with no twist at top or tale.
The sole gradesaver be Lemon Prawns. Fairly good-sized prawns sauted in sweet and sour sauce and garnished with lemon.
The space is inadequate on a crowded day. Might consider minimising a table or two.
p.s.: Chinatown is no longer the novice's delight to get good food at cheap price. If you are dropping by, do prepare to have a hole drilled in your pocket.

A very old and popular place in Chinatown, my experience at the outlet was not so good. Chinatown being known for comparatively cheaper drinks and food, we visited the place to enjoy a few drinks. Well the place is okay ambience wise. Not so cosy or private but a general open area. The waiters were not much attentive. The food was standard. Not anything to be proud of. Quantity wise it was up to the mark based on the price for a full plate. Quality was just say okay. Overall quite an average bar cum restaurant and if you want to go easy on the pocket than a posh pub, it's worth a visit.

The food is really good. U get half and full plate for starters and gravy, price is a little high! Had ordered fried fish, chicken garlic,mixed chow,Cantonese chicken! Taste was really good! Drinks price is pocket friendly compared to any bar in parkstreet area and equivalent! Bottle of beer (650ml)starts from 170/-. One thing which I did not like is, they don't serve any complimentary snacks like bhujji/nuts,etc with drinks.
Ambience is good, you have family sitting arrangements as well which is usual in most joints in China town.

Many an amazing meals eaten here. They have a few rooms-a family and then just for gentleman which is very thoughtful as they serve booze, and men plus strong beer-you know what I mean. 
Their food is another level. One thing that stands out above the rest is a starter with button mushrooms garlic and chilli. Spectacular is not the word. 
The food is inexpensive and they are extremely hospitable. It's my favourite place in all of Tangra. 
Well done guys.

Apart from having to wait in queues to get a seat inside the restaurant, honestly I have never been dissatisfied with them.
Their Cantonese noodles are simply out of this world as well as some other non-veg starters.
Interiors are okay and price is fair considering they face stiff competition from all the neighbouring restaurants.
Recommended to try out at least once.

Being a Bengali foodie Bong-chinese is but bhaat machh (read as rice and fish) to me. Hence, it must be considered a credit to the restaurant that they could pleasantly surprise me with the food. The chicken Thai soup and the chilli garlic pepper chicken were delectable starters but what really stole the show was the plain old mixed meat(no pork or beef) hakka noodles. It had no fancy spice added to it but tasted heavenly all the same. The chilli garlic fried rice and green pepper chicken were good as well. The service is pleasant and the staff were kind enough to help out in little ways like letting us charge our cell phones. On a slightly different note if you are planning to visit on a rainy day you may want to reconsider as water logging is a serious issue and cabs tend to decline bookings.

In these recent years, I have been to Chinatown quite a few number of times and the number of visits to Kim Ling is pretty much on the higher side.

It is located in the heart of Chinatown in Tangra and is run by Chinese settled in Kolkata. The interior of this place is dimly lit and articulately decorated. Once you enter the place, you feel like getting transferred to another sphere away from the rush of life.

The staffs are polite, softly spoken and they are seen to give maximum privacy. They will hardly interrupt you lest for pouring water and handing over the menu.

My friend ordered for two plate of fried rice, one chowmein, one dry chicken with a prawn dish. Taking out the order, they went inside preparing the dish which took a little bit of moment.

The time taken to prepare the dish will be instantly forgotten when you will be served with food. It is more than adequate in quantity and well the preparations tastes quite well. We spend almost three quarters of the hour mixing our food with gravy, munching our way through chicken and tasting prawn. After having completed the stuffs, we chatted for long and still didn't find anyone bugging for further orders or for bill. Later, we asked for the bill and they presented it.

The taste and quality of the food needs no more explanation as they are perfectly in line with the standards.

A visit very much recommended!

Rated 1 because a negative digit rating doesn't exist! The poorest experience of Chinese restaurant experience I've had ever...and I have been in a few places before! My expectation and craving with Tangra was spoilt entirely because of this one rotten experience! Have not ever seen such total lack of decor and taste in a Chinese restaurant of a similar price range. The waiters are zombies presumably caught up in a Sisyphus existence and trained to make the guests suffer equally! They have zero belief in "service" and don't even try to make a false effort. The one's taking down orders are the closest resemblance of God, or at least they believe they are - for you will be forever waiting for Godot! And when your prayers are answered and they finally arrive, you better be ready with what you want, for time is short and you have only one chance! The food - well, it's a food review and I having to make a passing mention of it as I sign off - if this doesn't spark enough food for thought then what does? Average at best - have much better things to say about any roadside Nepali Chinese joint anywhere in India. My biggest worry is what to make of the overall Zomato ratings for I feel seriously cheated and misguided by it, having only a 2-days stopover in Kolkata, and this experience spoiled my good old memories of Tangra when I grew up in this city. Sad!

Thanks to This is a Chinese restaurant serving good food which is value for money. Not fancy at all in terms of decor. But if you want to have just food this place is a good option. We had pepper fried chicken,rice noodles,chicken hot and sour soup,chicken sweet corn soup ,chicken and mushroom clear soup,dry chilli fish and mixed fried rice. Soup were good but mushroom quality could have been better. I loved the mixed rice noodles and the quantity was more than enough for two people.This place is worth visiting if you wanna have Chinese food at a affordable price.

This place has been a favourite due to it's economical rates and some good dishes. But yesterday the dishes tasted bland and the ambience has become horrible.(We ordered pepper chicken and garlic prawn as starters. For main dish we had Cantonese noodles, schezwan noodles, garlic noodles, schezwan chicken, lemon chicken and chicken manchurian((every member of our family suffers from gluttony)). Apart from garlic prawn and garlic chicken everything was below average) Blame it to the Sunday rush added to it being the Mother's day, am already rethinking about my options for Chinese food in Tangra.

Went there to have lunch with friends. We ordered chilli garlic pepper chicken & chicken manchurian (dry) for starters, then chilli garlic fried rice, schezwan noodles, schezwan chicken and hakka noodles for main course. To be honest, none of the preperations were upto the mark, the noodles were too ordinary and extremely oily, and the rice was okay-ish with the veggies undercooked. The schezwan chicken was sweet and didn't taste like "authentic" schezwan chicken at all. Quantities were not consistent as well, as some dishes had more, and some had less. Overall, the experience was a bit dissapointing.

The above rating of 3 is just because of the cheap price of drinks and super fast service. The quality of food was below average. Ordered crispy babycorn..chilly pepper chicken..fish fingers..prawn chips..salads and chicken chowmin & ofcourse booze. All the food items were extra oily and salty. Didn't like at all. Suggestion: plz improve the food standards.. The service the booze the pricing is perfect, just work on food quality.

Visited for dinner one day with the team, while was staying in Kolkata for 3 days. I had earlier visited the place last year, and couldn't write the review that time. The food is indeed lip smacking, but found it to be high on spice factor, and high on the oil. Tried the chilli chicken, prawn papad,honey chilli potato, fried rice, noodles with prawns in chilli garlic sauce. The chilli garlic sauce was perfect, and the star. Chilli chicken was ultra spicy, but went well with the cold beer. Will try the restaurants in surrounding, whenever visit the next time.

Whenever you are anywhere near Tangra, don't forget to take shelter in aroma and food of Kim Ling. This place has nothing to do with ambiance, nor will you find flashy Chandelier around. Just good food at an affordable price what they have. The Kim Ling is divided in 2 parts, one of them kept separated for family so, no eerie feeling if you don't love to drink wines and alcoholic beverages.
We have arrived at a lazy afternoon and had very run-of-the-mill food. Nothing experimental. Good enough to get 3.5 rating because, there are big-wigs in the same ally.

Located in chinatown in tangra amidst numerous outlets....
Although,there are few big names here like Beijing, Big boss... I like it most because of its authenticity.
Ambience- okayish
Food - excellent, both in quality and quantity. No perticular dish to mention,each of them are equally good. They serve a home-made mint-green chilli chutney,which is very good
Service - so so. Staffs are efficient.
Pricing - food potion is huge.very much pocket friendly.
Overall - my favourite restro in this location. :-)

This use to be one of the top name restaurant of those days and had been around for as long as I can remember Tangra. They have one stag section and two family room section inside the restaurant. The ambiance is cozy and has a typical Chinese restaurant feel and very average and simple in terms of interior. Its a great place for family dining and the pricing is also good and won't call it over priced.

Being here, I would recommend thai soup, chilli garlic pepper chicken and crispy baby corn for their starters and even their fish finger which is great. I find their main course pretty routine Chinese food available in most tangra restaurants.

Like most the restaurants in tangra, they serve good amount of quantity in terms of their pricing.It would be great once they start working on their presentation of food part. Rest all I feel is good however nothing appealing for me to keep coming now as their are many restaurants who are as competitive and better.

Visit Kim Ling quite regularly. This is one of the few restaurants in Chinatown who have actually maintained their quality, though they have inflated the price. The food variety and the taste is amazing, however they do stumble on them whenever the rush hour is on. I would advise you to leave home a bit early to find the place empty and food at it's best. 
I find the pricing a bit high compared to it's location and it's decor and service provided however, the food usually makes up for it. 

Order Highlights: 
Veg. Springroll
Spring Chicken
Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken
Crispy Fish
Spring Fish
Pepper Chilli Babycorn
Chicken/Veg. SweetCorn Soup 
Chicken/Veg. Hot and Sour Soup
Lung Fung Soup( Do try if you are non vegetarian, you'll love it)

Discovered this Chinese food paradise on a friends recommendation 6 years back. Been here innumerable times and introduced a lot of friends.
My last visit here was after demonetization and about a fortnight ago.
The quantity has come down alarmingly and has brought the quality down as well. The price stayed put.
Going to avoid this place.

This place has lost all its charm from what it used to be. Food quality has become very very bad. Roadside food should be preferred. The rates and the quality are going hand in hand

Thought to have some drinks and lunch.. we went there with high expectations but the waiter was a dumba**s my phone was on the table and he broke a glass of cocktail and he didn't feel sorry for that and told us to change the table.. we ordered 2 kingfisher strong, 1 screw driver and 1 full plate chili garlic drums of heaven.. the chicken was stale I didn't bother to tell them as my phone was not working at all.. they didn't feel apology and didn't give any discount on our bill... 
Pathetic service..

Located close to the highly popular Chinese kali temple,  this place is easy to find. The entrance is a little dingy but we were surprised to find some families inside. The staff is quite senior. At times they seem passive and arrogant and at other times they seem careful and observant. The food is undeniably delicious. 3 beer,  a chicken Thai soup,  chilli garlic drums of heaven(full) and a schezwan chicken chow,  fetched us,  a group of 4 people,  a bill of Rs. 1438. The quantity is sufficient. It's a relatively peaceful place to have dinner. Would certainly love to head back again and try more options from the menu.

This is oldest Chinese restaurant in Kolkata... I had Gd memories with this place .. bcoz I started eating non- veg food from here ! It was delicious... but yesterday I tried food from here after a decade , but I truly disappointed with their food ... pathetic food !
Earlier it's food compared by 'Mainland china' .. uhhh 🙄🙄
But drastically their (Kim ling) food gone down !
Food was extremely greasy... I order spring baby corn , it was ok , crispy fish is too much expensive.. and it smell like prawn.. later I discovered it was same oil in which prawn, fish , chicken were fried ! It's stinks 😬 Lemon chicken is too sweet .. no tangy taste in that. Sweet n sour fish was full of tomato sauce .. so now u can imagine the taste, chicken manchurian was ok , chilli chicken is less than ok ! Fried rice nd chow was extremely greasy that u can't imagine 😳 !
Now time for bill - it's aroun₹3100 nd tax near about 885 /- total 3985 -/
My hard earned money gone into water .. nd my calories gone high 😭 ... so I had to do more cardio nd jogging to loose Kim ling's worst calorie! 
Who said that this restaurant is pocket friendly 😤😤
I will sue them !🤔

This was my first visit to this restaurant in China Town, and the experience was disappointing. The interior was shabby (i'm trying my best not to be too harsh here). We were a group of 8 and the staffs were clearly puzzled as to where they should place us. After a few minutes of confusion, we finally got a table. We ordered starters and drinks, the quantity and quality of food was average. 

However, the staff members definitely need to learn what "hospitality" means. They were too reluctant (not because they had to attend to a huge no. of customers, the place was not crowded at all) and it almost felt like they were doing us a favor. We went there for lunch but left after the drinks and went to another nearby restaurant. With so many potential competitors around, they really need to mend their ways. Definitely not visiting this place again, got better ways to waste my money.

I've been to many restaurants in the city, but have never seen such bad hospitality anywhere. Food was not at all good either. 
Kim Ling, being the one of the oldest restaurants in the city, I really think the management should look after the people they are hiring for their hospitality department. Because it is really making a very bad impression on the age old reputation that you have.

Went there on my friend's treat sometime back. It was the first restaurant I visted in China town:
Ambience:
- It is congested during the evening and dinner.
- Decore is not dat good to mention nor the ambience
The Food I had there:
i. Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken: It was really good and they serve it wit a honey ginger sauce which very well complements its taste. A must hav here..ne restaurant in Chinatown

ii. Dry Chilli Chicken: Being a die hard fan of Chilli Chicken I always wanted try it out in authentic Chinese restaurant... And the CHILLI Chicken Here was Just Awesome... I don't like the gravy variety

iii. Thai Crabe Soup : Not a big fan of Soup.. But this Soup was Also GREAT with a good consistency and filled with ingredients in every sip.

iv. Mixed Fried Rice: It was good but not remarkable though it had proper proportion of chicken , prawn and egg to meet ones expectations.

v. Mixed Hakka Chow: Quality & Quantity was good but it was too oily and a bit bland in taste

vi. Garlic chicken Gravy: It was not note worthy.. pretty bland and uninteresting...

vii. Fresh lime Soda: A must hav add on here.. as its pretty cheap here and complements well with the food available here..Kushal

Visited this place today with my friends. It was a birthday treat invitation. We were a group of 18 people and so huge quantity of food was ordered. What bothered us was that compared to the other tables, our portion sizes were less. The food tasted OK. Also they were not courteous enough to convey to us that some other people around were having some problems due to loud noises made by us and as a result we were publicly scolded by another customer to keep quiet. (A group of 18 is always loud even if each person individually is not loud, but eeh you don't care).
Also, they stated that the tip we gave was not satisfactory. A tip is given when we are happy with the service, we were until another customer insulted us in front of the staff due to the staff's inability to convey.
Unfortunately you lost 20 families as your customers. None of us are ever visiting this place. I guess you people don't care.

Tasty chinese at an affordable price. 
Kim ling has stood the test of time and retained it's quality over the years. 
I've liked every dish I've tried so far. They are quite generous with the quantity served. Their Chilli garlic pepper chicken is a MUST try. 
If you can locate it successfully and reach there,you won't be disappointed. The only downside of this restaurant happens to be it's location. 
Adequately spacious,you can call them and make a reservation if needed.

Been to Kim ling with cousins today (14th August '16). A decent restaurant in China town tangra area. Ambience is average. Food was good. Chilli garlic pepper chicken was tasty. Main course was average. We had ordered mixed schezwan fried rice, hot garlic chicken and a fish item. They were average in taste but good in quantity. In a nutshell, a decent place to go with family or friends and it is averagely priced.

This was probably my nth visit to this restaurant. 
No matter how shabby the ambience is,They make the perfect GOLDEN fried prawns here! (The medium sized ones). And i keep visiting this place again and again for this.. fresh,tender and perfectly fried just to make it finer.
Dinner follows as a mere formality.
The Cantonese noodles they make is decent and the rest are okayish.
Nevertheless, worth recommending this for some beer and starters! 

Cheers!:)

Kim ling , one of the oldest chinese resturant in china town serving average to good indo chinese varients to eat.
Simple decor , lots of space so dont have to wait much. Also good part is they have separate dining space for family and others...
Not much to talk about ambience lightings music so if they have to attract food lovers. The service personel were well mannered but not very enthusiatic to help you out choose from the menu, something which is a miss in kolkata..The only criteria should be foood.
Food quantity wise good. If we talk about taste , quality it is nothing to die for. 
So to help you with names of few dishes we had for the evening.
Dry pepper chicken - nicely done chicken good taste.
Dry swezwan chicken - nicely cooked perfect spice content.
Gravy chicken chowmin - nice semi thick gravy could have been better.
Lung fung soup - disaster of the evening , stale and no consistency. 
Over all if you like to check out old china town resturants with low dim light and the benefit of ordering full bottle liquor which saves a lot money...this is the place to try out once in a while.

The food is great along with the quantity... just don't take anything with honey in it.. you will regret it for the rest of your life just like I did trust me! A plate of rice or noodles are way more than enough for two people ( and trust me, I do not eat less). The rice and the noodles are very very delicious as well as the chicken preps. Also the starters are amazing. Here again, please nothing with honey! 
Ambiance is pretty okay, it stays empty most of the time... I personally do not like deserted eateries but those who do it's good for them :D so thumbs up to this place except for the honey thing!

If you try to judge this place on the basis if its infrastructural sophistication without tasting its food, you would surely be missing the taste of 'the best' Indo- Chinese food available to kolkata. People who really love Chinese food and has the finest taste buds would not mind waiting in a queue for about half an hour to grab a seat in here. I would strongly recommend you to try the starters on their menu card especially their specialities( you can order any of them with closed eyes and the taste will surprise you). The prawn chopsuey is my favourite on the main course. The quantity is a bit too much for one person per plate. If you have never been to this place, you definitely should. Its worth your money.

Tangra or China Town serves indo-chinese version of chinese cuisine. Long, Long back a section of Chinese population moved to India and settled in Kolkata around teriti bazar area. These people then later on moved to China Town or Tangra and set up this lane full of restaurants. Their cooking involved a mix of indian and Chinese spices, and so Indo Chinese Cuisine was born. One of the oldest of this string of restaurants is Kim Ling. 

While one may complain about the decor not living up to the standards of the posh south kolkata fine diners, we have to understand that the purpose of Jim Ling was never grand decor - They wanted to server great food/alcohol at cheap prices, and they have excelled at that.

Love their chili garlic pepper chicken, crispy chili baby corn, szechwan chicken, mixed fried rice. Order run-of-the-mill dishes, just to on the safe side. Do not expect thai dishes to have any thai any flavours, but they taste good nevertheless.

To start off I'd say that the place is quite unwelcomly... And neither should u expect any better ambience inside... The waiters do not offer that friendly touch and guidance they should(I've noticed them standing in front of us keeping a watch on how much we tip them which creates an awkward situation)... Now coming to the food... It was at par with the price, nothing too great or mouth watering... It is a good place for students but I won't recommend it for families...

Also incomparable mei foon.. However the only thing is that the aginommoto used for all the Tangra Restuarants make me dehydrated the night following the dinners.. Health wise it's not the best sign that your body has to offer.. Hence we try and avoid Tangra food these days.. However a great culinary treat this place turns out to be..

I have a lot of friends who are foodies and I will personally at least tell them not to visit this place.    No wonder it stays empty in a place like China Town on a Sunday evening.

And probably that sums up the entire experience!!
Location - 2.5/5
Food - 3/5
Interior - 1.5/5
Staff behaviour - 3/5
Price - Very high, almost can compete with Beijing and Golden joy or even beyond that.
We took one BP 375 which costs 765+tax and in starters we ordered for crispy pepper chicken, Crispy fried fish, pepper fish, prawn papad and one rice noodles. Trust me, none of the food was that much praiseworthy - all of them were just ok. Only the rice noodles might be a bit ahead in terms of taste. But the bill was huge, the half crispy fried fish was 350+ tax and the total bill was 2267 rupees.
This place might be a very old and renowned place among the best 5 restaurants in tangra but to me, it was very ordinary.
Along with the other pics of the food and place,  I am also attaching the bill for the same so that if you are planning to drop in here, u can have a firm idea about the cost.

Being a great Chinese food lover and getting to eat in such a place is equal to being blessed with this life. No seriously, i won't be able to stop writing about the food. 

Let me begin with the prawn chips we ordered with the beer. The flavour of the crunchy chips with the chilled beer was a heavenly feeling and i got to know that this 35 years old joint, make their own prawn chips. So, please make it a point you order them.

Coming to the food, we ordered Mixed Chow and Fried Rice with Schezuan Chicken and Garlic Chicken both in light gravy. I can say that the Mix Chow was the best i have had in 3 years in Kolkata. The fine mix of prawn, chicken, egg and the use of the veggies( if only i wasn't that hungry, i would have posted a picture 🙏) with the noodles. The other dishes were awesome too but i couldn't stop admiring my Mix Chow. 

My visit to Kim Ling was a very memorial one and i am going to visit again to fill my Chinese food cravings.

The best in China Town.. the chilli garlic prawn is to die for! Infrastructure wise, it might be a little disappointing, but service is absolutely great. Too bad they don't serve dessert!

Had gone there on Sunday after leaving another restaurant in Tangra cos of the ridiculous prices they had!! Was looking forward to being in kim Ling as we had been there many a times previously! But we were quite let down as the taste and quality of the food had gone down big time! We have a lot of expectations from here so please get back to the same restaurant you used to be before ! Will come back soon but hope the food improves !

The restaurant is located in the famous Chinatown part of Kolkata. It has a pretty high rating in Zomato, but i felt it was overhyped. There wasnt much of ambience or decor or anything. The food was okok. Maybe i went at the wrong time or something, but my experience wasnt too good. I had the Spring chicken, pepper garlic chicken and a couple of beers. Compared to some other restaurants of the neighbourhood, it is a bit more expensive too.

I went there several times and tasted several dishes of them. every thing was well tasted and not typically similar with other chinese restaurants. :-)

Recommended their chilli lemon chicken or chilli lemon fish. This is very innovative dish. But quite easy to prepare. I also prepared in my home also as I liked that so much. Their family section is different from bar section. Thats also a very good of them. :-D

Overall I am very satisfied.

Been here last weekend for a sunday lunch. One of the oldest Chinese restaurant in the Tangra area, this place serves amazing Chinese dishes. Had Beer & Chicken Wanton as starters and Garlic Chicken, Schezuwan Chicken along with Mixed Schezuwan Rice, Cantonese rice & Mixed Haka noodles in the main course. The quality of the food was amazing. The only reason that I'm giving a rating of 3.5 is just because the interior of the restaurant is quite dull & life less. Even tough I don't know about the family section area (Yes the seating arrangements are divided into two areas) but the section where we sat was poorly lit. Apart from that, it's a great place to have Chinese cuisine.

The overhyped China Town popularity took me to this place as per recommendation of friends and family. To start with the place it's really filthy and shabby. Even the restaurant isn't too good. Ordered the food,  however my expectation of authentic chinese food was suffocated to death. Foods were too oily and sticky (full of corn starch). Big no no to anyone who haven't visited this place and anyone who likes clean environment.

Being a restaurant in tangra one expects it to be good. I found it just okish as the food was extremely oily. Service was a tad bit slow. Restaurant is not too big to accommodate a huge crowd. But being in the heart of tangra its still surviving. Depends on your taste, u can definitely go and try it out. But its just my opinion. No harm in trying out. Good luck!! 👍

Chinese and Tangra or "China Town" Go hand in hand.......  There are a lot of gems in this place but I like this one a lot. Its good food... hospitable and friendly servers and the fact that its not too expensive makes it a good choice for eating at China Town whithout having to spend too much.... 

Loved the prawns and the Chicken preparations. The noodles too were delicious. Love the place. The ambience however could be improved.

We had really high expectations going to this place . It's Christmas and we wanted to have a perfect mix of booze and food. For that we thought of visiting tangra .We did not go for the conventional restaurants and went for Kim Long for a change . This restaurant is located around 5 minutes away from Beijing if you keep in walking the road forward . I was not satisfied by the ambience moreover because we were not seated in the family place . Being 3 in number they obliged to let us seat in the bar area . Being a very busy day the waiters were very busy so I will skip their points. When it comes to drinks this is not the cheapest of joints , so donot go there with such expectations . coming to the food , we ordered : - 

Starters :-
1. Pepper chicken ( 3.5 / 5 )
2. Fried babycorn ( 3.5 / 5 )
3. Prawn Crackers ( 4 / 5 )

Main Course : -
1. Mixed mehfoon ( 4 / 5 )
2. Shanghai fish ( 3.5 / 5 )
3. Chilli garlic pepper chicken dry ( 3.5 / 5 )

Now for every dish in the menu you will get 2 prices one for full plate and another for half. You will find the price of full plate really huge and mind you the quantity if full plate is about double so you can easily order the half price .The food was good as you can see the ratings . Among all the dishes mentioned in the list the pepper chicken from the starters and mehfoon from the main course were the only items that were taken full plate. Others were half and the quantity was very good. If you ask me I will recommend this place but only if you are in tangra and looking for a booze and meal combo . They did not have much for the deserts so we took cold drinks . It was a decent experience but not going  for a second visit .

Its is one of the oldest in the tangra zone located beyond the usual biggies. A kind request to all, dont judge the place from outside. They served the best chilli pepper garlic fish/chicken i have ever had! The dish is spicy and crispy and the fish was very fresh and half plate contains 7pcs!! Mixed gravy noodles was usual, lemon chicken was good but a bit to the sweeter side. But the fish and the chicken starters won my heart over!! Service is very efficient and the place is well maintained.

Ah! The good old tangra. For those who don't know, Tangra is the term used for the Chinese colonies settled in India. This particular one has a wonderful history. There were alot of tanneries in this area which were basically full of Chinese folks. Sadly they moved after these tanneries were shut down.
Luckily, they left some yummy food behind. Kimling is a wonderful restaurant. Quite big on the outside with a varied seating divided in three sections. The exteriors mind you aren't classy or anything. Quite the contrary. One section deals with only men's section, which equates to drinking permit. One is a family section, where we sat. And third from what I've heard is a more comfy couchy posh family section.
This was my first trip here, after hearing all the rave reviews about the golden fried prawns from my family.
A party of five, we were welcomed by friendly faces and the hustle hustle of the loud chatter made it feel like a Chinese restaurant. 
For starters we had some golden fried prawns (no surprises there) and chilli chicken. Now chilli chicken is my barometer for measuring good India Chinese in any place. It passed with flying colours. We also had some chicken pepper garlic which was nice.
The fiery soup ( and we received a fair warning) was Tom yum and boy was it spicy. Lovely if u are a sucker for hot food.
The mains were a little bit of a let down. Honestly why I probably knocked off a few points. The noodles were decent. The gravy saddened me. Mainly the schezwan    Chicken. The fish gravy was very under par too.
Overall the experience was splendid and the golden fried prawns by themselves were the best I had. Huge chunky, golden, crunchy and so yummy.
Can't wait to go back for round two.

I had high hopes walking in here as it was highly  recommended by a few people. Surprisingly empty on a weekend afternoon, we were greeted by the friendly staff and promptly seated. The variety offered on the menu is huge. The starters, both veg and non veg were nice and spicy but lacked any other flavour as such. Moving on to the main course the chowmein was nicely done. Sadly the chilli paneer and the chilli lemon fish were a disappointment. They lacked any flavour whatsoever. All in all a bad experience and a place i would avoid the next time i am in Tangra.

Today we had dinner at kimling, it is one of the famous and oldest restaurant of Tangra. I am rating 3.5 only for the starters and nothing else. The starters were finger licking, we orders chilli garlic fish and chicken drumsticks our all time favorite here. The fish was really fresh and it was really crispy, the drumsticks were crispy from outside and juicy from inside. I think it is the most ordered dish here. But the main course is really disappointing as usual. In the main course we ordered mixed rice noodles(meifoon) and chicken manchurian. The meifoon was really oily with to much of onion. The Manchurian was OK but it was little bit salty.. They must look after their main course for sure. The price is really high but they used to provide huge quantity now they have reduced it too. Earlier, in full plate they used to give 15 to 16 PCs now its reduced to 10. Now the waiters, I haven't seen anywhere asking for tips. I saw one family was leaving after paying the bill but the waiter stopped the man and asked him to pay tips, this is not at all acceptable.

I have been to this restaurant many times over the years as it is close to my house and have seen it slowly degrade to what it is today. 
1.Service- the service is very slow and the waiters are lethargic at best and often get the order wrong
2.food- over the years they have maintained the quantity served but have lowered the quality drastically. in More than one occasion i have found bone in the boneless fish and the chicken items are very oily and substandard 
3.the environment and ambience was never its strong point or was rather its Achilles heel and it has only gotten worst as the owners have not done improvements, the plates, glasses and table cloth look like they have been not been changed since the 90s 
4.Value- well just over a year ago a plate of noodles would cost me ₹115 inclusive of taxes and now the same thing costs me ₹250 , the cost is still not as even though the price has more than doubled but what pinches me is that the Service, Food and ambience do not justify that price 
All in all it is just a not so cheap bar being paraded as a restaurant, the only people who enjoy there are the ones who would like to drink at a lesser price than the other good bars.

We went there on a saturday,Everything was too much overpriced...Okk now if the food is good that should suffice,but the food is equally worst.We ordered Chicken Drumsticks but i think the Chef didn't know what is chicken and we were served what looked like Crow Drumsticks.

Add to that the behaviour of the staff.It seems that they are least bothered to serve customers,therefore acting rudely and with utter disinterest.

Went there for a birthday celebration of our friend, don't judge them by the interiors, but apart from the drinks, the mouth watering, prawn crackers, fish finger and dry chilly chickens are good, the service is really friendly, we ordered both rice and noodles and quality is too good. Two bottles of 100pipers, 2 breezers, 3 plate prawn cracker, 1.5 plate of fish finger, three plates of chilly chicken, three plates of garlic rice and two plates of mix Korean noodles, for seven heads there, we spent around 10k.

I visited this place yesterday with my friend. A narrow passage leads to the dining room which is minimal in decor. The staff was well trained and consequently service was efficient. We ordered drums of heaven and lung fung soup as starters. The soup was nice(but I am afraid , can't call it delectable) and the drums of heaven were average in taste and quite minimal in size. Our main course comprised of gravy mixed noodles and chilli garlic prawn. The noodles dish was yummy but can't say the same about the chilli garlic prawns...only a lil above average. Being a regular at Mainland China and Tung Fong , I had visited this place after reading rave reviews about it. But sadly the place didn't live up to my expectations.

The Thai soup , mixed rice noodles , mixed cantonese noodles, chili garlic chickn & manchurian chicken are the dishes we stick to whenevr v go der.

Had a wonderful experience here. GPS guide is needed to reach you here. 
The ambience is very good with very courteous waiters. 
The food served here in general is very simple and truly delicious. The quantity is too much considering the price. 
We ordered chilli lemon chicken (dried) with mixed Hakka noodles and wanton soup as the starter.
The wanton soup was a clear soup. We ordered a half soup and shared it between two of us. Each of us got two chicken wantons in it. It was very light and delicious.
The mixed Hakka noodles had shreds of chicken and prawns. There was no smell of oil. The preparation was very good.
The chilli lemon chicken was really the best of its kind that I ever have tasted. It was yummy yum. The chicken pieces had a coating of cornflour and fried and the gravy was of syrup and ample lemon with lots and lots of chilli pieces. It had sweet sour hot flavour. I think the chillis  used were not the regular chillis  that we get in the market. It had the flavour of chilli but wasn't hot; what I mean is that it had the jhaanj but not the jhaal. 
For drinks we ordered fresh lime soda which was a lemon juice with sugar in soda; and a fresh lime juice which was lemon juice in water without sugar which was very sour. On requesting the waiter provided some syrup and it tasted good. Later the drinks helped us digesting the food better as we had eaten loads of food considering the beauty of the taste.

Considered among the prime restaurants in China Town, this place is somewhat difficult to locate and in case you don't have a car you might as well overlook it. Judging by the facade it looks very ordinary but the interiors are well-lit and spacious, and though not very ornate, but fairly decorated. The restaurant is also conveniently separated into stag and family sections.

The food was good, but reading the reviews I had higher expectations. The so-famous Spring Chicken was soulless and Crispy Chicken was just average. Next we had opted for Szechuan Chow, Fried Rice and Cantonese Rice along with Sweet and Sour Chicken, Manchurian Chicken and Szechuan Mutton. To be honest none of the dishes were standouts, and even the quantity was begging.

The service was courteous. The price however was on the expensive side. Overall, it was a fairly decent dining experience.

When we talk about the ‘Famous Five ’  at China Town,  we mean ’Kimling ’ ;along with  Beijing, Golden Joy, Big Boss and Namking. A perfect place for a bunch of rowdies to hang out, to get drunk and cherish some fine Chinese dishes. We went on a Saturday night, so it was pretty crowded.

N.B- If you are with family or want a little privacy, always go inside. If that is full, please go to some other place.

The liquor is cheap and only the most basic and regular ones are available. If you want to go for a sophisticated, fine dining this certainly is not the place for you!!

Now the food is fresh, hot, and tasty and value for money. I was a bit disappointed at first finding no Pork items on the menu. Setting that despair aside for a while, we ordered a bowl of Chicken Sweet Corn soup (half) which is sufficient for two.  The sweet yellowish corn in the thick hot soup, is indeed a pleasure to have. As per my partner’s request, we had Chicken Fried Dumpling (momo).It was well fried and staffed adequately. For the main course we ordered Mixed Fried Rice and Fish with Baby Corn and Mushroom. The quantity was more or less enough for two. The rice had an abundance of chicken, egg and fine quality tasty prawns. Fresh baby corn and Button Mushroom along with the Betki fish in a white sauce gravy is surely a must try over there.

Recently been there with my best buds. Basically amidst Chinatown in Kolkata, once visited the place, one can get the feeling of being in China for a moment :P. I found the chicken soup quite tasty and the starters had baked pan fried chicken which was too good. Main course included mixed fried rice and saucy chicken with Chinese blend. Moreover, a nice place to have lunch or dinner with family and friends.

Kim Ling is one of the oldest & best Chinese restaurants in Kolkata. My father used to visit this place with his friends when he was in college. I have been visiting this place with my family since I was a kid. This place has remained same over the years. I have been there atleast 10 times and each time I go there this place amazes me with its lip smacking Chinese dishes. The price is very reasonable & the quantity is also good. This is why this place is always packed with people & every time we go there, we have to wait for atleast 15 min before we get a place. The only thing that Kim Ling lacks compared to other restaurants is its ambiance. Now, coming to the food. I would like to mention some of my all time favourites. Most of the soups they prepare are very delicious. I especially love the Chicken asparagus soup, Lung Fung soup, Chicken mushroom soup & Chicken hot & sour soup. Coming to starters, the Chilli garlic pepper chicken and Chilli garlic pepper fish are absolutely delicious. For main course we always order the Chicken Cantonese Noodles. It tastes heavenly. Chicken Chow and Chicken Fried Rice are also my favourites. The Schezuan Fish, Hot Garlic Fish, Schezuan prawns, Hot Garlic Chicken, Fish with baby corn and mushroom, all these taste absolutely yummy and go very well with rice as well as noodles. Overall, the quality of food is very good and I would suggest everyone to visit this place atleast once.

The starter of choice, Honey Chicken, was slightly underwhelming. Otherwise, the Mixed Fried Rice, Mixed Gravy Chow and Chili Garlic Chicken were very good, not only in terms of taste but also in terms of ample portions served. Overall, a very decent experience in the heart of China Town. Will definitely be looking forward to returning again.

This joint is part of the famed FIVE of Tangra, other FOUR being Beijing, Golden Joy, Big Boss and Namking. Dropped in on a weekday afternoon only to find it empty. We were quite early by Tangra standards, so the vacancy was not unexpected. Ordered a plethora of dishes which comprised of Chilly garlic drums of heaven, chilly garlic pepper fish, plain pepper fish, mixed fried rice, mixed meifoon noodles, chicken Manchurian  and the good old Kolkata favourite Chilly Chicken. Amongst the starter items the drums of heaven and pepper fish were both deep fried sautéed in liberal amount of green chillies and finely chopped garlic. They were both pretty spicy and not for the faint-hearted. However it tasted heavenly along with the vodka. The plain pepper fish looked pale white and bland. However it was a hidden gem-pretty flavoursome. The quality of fish was top-notch as expected from this joint. In the main course the mixed meifoon (rice) noodles was decent enough and went well with the chicken Manchurian. I had got the mixed fried rice and chilly chicken packed for home. And both the dishes were outstanding.As far as the food items were concerned I would say thy scored petty high on both the quantity and quality aspects.A special mention about the prices of booze. As is the norm in Tangra they do serve liquor in bottles for large groups of diners and we were no exception. A 375 ml bottle of Smirnoff vodka was priced at Rs 645/-.No wonder joints in Tangra are a tippler's paradise.The drawback of this pace is it lacks in ambience, décor, sophistication and presentation of dishes. If you are not the fussy types and longing for a good Chinese meal paired with booze then look no further.

The place has remained same over years but the prices but has become way too expensive. The quality of food remains good. The quantity is very good. We ordered one prawn noodles which was sufficient for three adults. The dragon chicken was good but had a hint of garlic. There is no parking space and the approach roads are not good.

Booze prices have shot up and that's where they have lost their USP
But no complaints on food..They have degraded a bit but still very good.

It is always a good experience at Kim Ling.. This was our third visit today for lunch. We had
golden fried prawns, Thai soup, garlic pepper chicken as starters. Main course - rice noodles, lemon garlic chicken, fish with veges
The green chilli sauce which is at the table is to die for and made fresh everyday.
My only negative comment is that the lemon chicken dry was a bit sweet... Going by the name I was expecting a sour lemony item to come.
Customer service - major plus. We had praised the green sauce so the waiter packed some for our takeaway 😀
Overall very good.

It is just one among many other restaurants of China Town and has nothing in it to really stand out of the crowd. They serve good food , have a really good place for family dining but then nothing really is there to visit again. One must try out their Thai soups as that is what I found them really good at as compared to other restaurants. All other food that we ordered also had the China Town magic . The fish finger was delicious and the Crispy Babycorn was equally delightful. But they can really work on the way they present their dishes. I had thought of uploading pictures but the presentation wanted me to reconsider even clicking them. Overall the food was really good but on an overall scale I would rate this after Namking, Beijing and BigBoss

           The ambience of the restaurant is good and cosy. The service is very fast. The dishes you should concentrate on according to me are the starters. The Spring chicken and Chilli Garlice Pepper Chicken are out of this world. Rest is all routine great chinese cuisine.

Kim Ling is loacted a bit deep in South Tangra Road,one of the better family restuarants in China Town and one I have frequented ever since my childhood..It serves some of the tastiest and flavourfull food in this area..Though the same owner also owns Beijing this place seems to be a bit economical and pocket friendly while offering the same quality of food..They have separate stag section and 2 family rooms..though the decor is minimal and nothing to feel like being in China Town the staff is quite helpful and efficient..One thing which amaze me is they have maintained the same standards over the years..never compromised on taste,authenticity or quantity..Also most of their side dishes are available in dry or gravy style as per ur choice..Loved the use of chillies and hotness of their dishes..Some of my favourite and recommended dishes here includes: 
Chicken Drumticks: Easily one of the best I ever had,loved the crunchiness..
Chilli Garlic Pepper Chicken: One thing which I personally prefer here above other tangra outlets is the balance of spices in their dishes..Also I love the sting in the taste buds due to the small chilli granules in their dishes..
Schezwan Fish Dry: It tasted brilliant..the fish is crunch and fresh..while the sauce is super hot and tangy..goes well with alcohol..
Hot Garlic Prawn: Special mention to the flavour and aroma of garlic..
Thai Garlic Chicken: A word of caution..this dish may not be suitable for the weak hearts!!Extremely pungent..goes well with your fried rice or hakka noodles..
However this place is not suitable for tipplers since booze is a bit costly compared to other places here and they don't serve alcohol larger quantity of 375ml or 750ml..Overall cost for 2 should be approx Rs.1100/-..
Food: 5/5

Well, when it comes to eating out I always go by the whole experience. I must say i was not really impressed when i first entered this place. It did not look like a restaurant. Its just a big white room with tables and chairs and very bright lights. No decor, nothing.
Now lets come to the food. The Chilli Garlic Red Pepper Chicken was a cracker of a dish and the Fish Springs were also very good. The rice and Chicken side dish was pretty amazing too. Quantities were pretty good and we had to end up packing up some of it. 
If you are a food person only then you should definitely give this place a try. However, if you are a person who wants to have a good dining experience this is definitely not the place for you.

Nestled in the original China Town of Kolkata, this Chinese food restaurant is amongst the best I experienced in recent years. Don't go by the ambience or decor but relish the food. The best dish we had was Honey Chicken which was amazing. Even mains has a wide collection of dishes.  Sadly mutton or duck or crab mentioned in the menu was not available. Not sure if that is available at any time. Nevertheless chicken and prawn dishes that we ordered were yummy. And the quantity is worth the price. Visit this place if you are in the area.

The taste was awesome & worth the visit. Quantity of the dishes were very good in my opinion since we had packed the left over food.

Mind you they prepare spicy dishes so dont forget to specify about that to the waiters. Prices are a bit expensive but its justified with the quality they provide

I was introduced here by my uncle and revisited here after couple of years. First thing one will realize about Kim Ling is its location which is much interior of China Town. Getting a parking or cab is a huge challenge. Day by day their price is increasing and ambiance is getting lousier. We always asked for table at family section.

It’s the only place where I prefer to have soup and always go with Tom Yum and Lung Fung soups. With soups I love to munch those famous addictive Prawn Crackers.

Believe it or not to me they prepare best thin and delicate rice noodles in the area. For me Chili Chicken and Lemon Chicken make the best combo with Meifoon.

To my surprise service here is not that slower like Beijing or Big Boss. But ambiance and location is a huge huge let down.

Joy of being in Kolkata is visiting tangra. It just takes you back in time, slows you down in life which is a happy feeling. What adds more to it is that you get to have a happy meal. Loved the atmosphere in Kim ling, soft dim lighting and red color chairs brings some kind of coziness to the place. The well dressed waiters are always willing to serve you. We went bonkers when the food arrived. Tom yum soup was the spiciest we ever had, but the flavors were intact and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The main course was betki fish in black bean sauce, chilli garlic prawns, chilly chicken which was savoured with absolutely thin garlic infused rice noodles and Veg fried rice. We loved the food, we ate to glory. Will visit this place when we are on Kolkata next.

It was our maiden voyage to China Town and we chose Kim Ling as our first destination because of its better rating than its neighbors (e.g Big Boss, Beijing). We chose to ignore the pathetic surroundings  to satiate our taste buds. And I must admit the food that turned up in due course of time didn't disappoint us.
 We ordered half plate fried chicken and two sweetened fresh lime soda to wash it down. In main course Chicken Manchurian Rice and the Thai Garlic chicken tasted perfect. The sauce and the the spices were nicely blended with the succulent chicken cubes to make the Thai garlic chicken a spicy affair. 
The pocket pinch in this place is on the heavier side. Even our modest order sans alcohol costed us 800 bucks. The price of the dishes are high considering the location and the ambiance. The family section,where we had our lunch was stuffy and clumsy. The staff behavior is nothing to complain about. But the staffs' waiting for a tip even after levying a hefty service charge is a bit annoying.
Overall, for many, visiting this place may be a walk down the memory lane, but for me  it is just another place to have decent Chinese dishes at a premium price. I have to think twice to visit Kim Ling again.

I was introduced to this restaurant about a decade back by some of my friends and I had fallen in love with this one. Inexpensive, Kim Ling offers a variety of authentic Chinese menu. My favourite is the Lung Fung soup, Chilli Lemon Chicken and the Honey Prawn. The interesting thing I had noted here was that all dishes come in two prices - full and half - something that you'd not see in any other restaurant in the city. 

The restaurant has three sections - includes one only for the folks who'd prefer a drink or two with their noodle.

Legendary place and awesome food. But really not so different from Beijing or Big Boss. On top of that, it is pretty expensive in its category. My latest order was half a lemon chicken and half a chili garlic chicken. And it cost me Rs 555 which is way too much for the pathetic ambience of China Town, Tangra. Don't get me wrong, even Beijing has a similarly pathetic ambience.

But I still strongly recommend going here because Bong people are fascinated by Chinese food. That being said, keep in mind that this place still serves "Indian" Chinese!

Quantity is quite massive, price is very reasonable. The only problem is, they(the chefs) didn't like to put much salt in every food we ordered. ????

Kim ling !! the name itself is delved in nostalgia for many old timers of china town .  However , on recent visits , many would agree that the present scenario of kimling is far removed from the glorious heydays of it's past .  I went there Recently hoping to rediscover the flavours of  the time past , but came back  with a lingering bitter taste in the mouth .   First of all you will discover that the family section is much smaller than the stag section . Also the quality &  quantity of food has gone down drastically .   I  went there with a friend of mine , & ordered for starters 1/2 plate chilly prawn ( rs 420 ) & 1/2 plate chilli garlic pepper fish  ( rs 285 ) along with 60 ml peg of smirnoff ( rs 105)  & 60 ml peg of bacardi white rum ( rs 165 )  ,   to be had with 2 soft drinks ( 2 X 25 = rs 50 ) . The chilly prawn was served quickly , but had medium sized pieces .  When i am shelling out 420 bucks , that too for half plate ,   I atleast expect the pieces to be Big enough to justify the price tag .  Same goes for the chilly garlic pepper fish , not succulent enough to justify rs 285 for half plate . Dissatisfied , we looked for other options . We went back to the basics & ordered 1/2 plate prawn pakora ( rs 275 ) for starters to  go with our drinks . To be fair & to our pleasant surprise  , the prawn pakora turned out to be the best starter of the lot .  Cooked to near perfection , it momentarily made us feel that maybe we have been too  quick & too harsh to pass judgement so quickly on such a  legendary outlet .    having gorged on the prawn pakora , we   decided to give kim ling another chance at impressing us , by ordering the main  course.  We ordered 1 plate mixed hakka chowmein ( rs 155 )  & 1/2 plate szechuan prawn  ( gravy ) { rs 420 } . Imagine our disbelief , when the prawn arrived in a Dish & not in a  bowl .    Without making any effort to complain , we decided to finish off our meal quickly & leave . The noodles were well cooked , but  sadly , again , i cannot say the same about the prawn .  Utterly disappointed,  we even stopped chatting amongst ourselves  ,  to finish off the food .   WE ordered the bill  &  it came at rs 2200 [ rs 1875 + 14.5 % VAT + 4.944 % service tax = rs 2200 ] .  For an hour & a half spent mainly on  starters  & negligible amount of alcohol , i personally thought it to be on the expensive side .  I would loved to be proved wrong , when i say that kim ling has lost it's old charm , but sadly don't see that happening anytime soon . Go there for the memories alone , not for new experiences !!  is all i will say .

Tangra or China Town as the locals call it is the Chinese food hub of Kolkata and Kim Ling is one of the best restaurants out there. It falls short on the ambience front but the food makes up for it.

Food as usual will not disappoint you.
The taste is just like what I had tried since my childhood.
However I would like to point out that the Cantonese style noodles was made with a red spicy sauce instead of the traditional bland white sauce. This had taken me aback as this is one of the oldest Chinese restaurants and mistakes like this hamper the customer expectations.

We ordered Spring chicken,dry chili chicken,prawn wafers,chicken fried wontons and red pepper chili garlic fish for starters along with a couple of drinks and breezers. Food was good except for the quality of fish. For main course,we ordered a chicken hakka noodles,chkn fried rice and chili garlic chkn.. noodles and the gravy were excellent but the rice was just okay. Service was a tad slow. Bill came around 3500 including taxes for 5 ppl.

Second destination in Kolkata. This one was in the famous Chinese food district of the city. And Kim Ling certainly lived up to the reputation of the area. I had one of my most favourite preparations, Chicken Lollipop, called Drums Of Heaven here. And it was heavenly. Other preparations were also nice. Ambience-wise the place is very old school. A nice place to go to, if you are in Calcutta.

A great place to be in on Sunday nights with family. This place has got a really cozy look and a relaxed ambience. Chinese served here doesn't get any better. If you're a fan of Chinese delicacy this place is a 'must' to be in.  Hence, I think the 4.0 score is justified. Thanx.

if you are in Kolkata and you really love Chinese then a must visit place  . Although the place is not so well decorated but  spacious but pretty good for family outing.
Hard to locate the place as it's not in heart of china town area but it won't disappoint you after getting  in.
Must try their mixed garlic Fried Rice  and duck in Chinese sauce  .Quality of food  as well as taste is really good .

Kim Ling is quite a bit hike if you enter from the first gate to Chinatown. We trudged along the by-lanes in the hope of some delicious Chinese fare. The front facade is not very impressive but I am not someone who cares much about visuals. We entered and were directed towards the family seating area. The decor is non-existent and seating was simple but clean. We were quite late to arrive and could notice the lack of servers. It took them around 10 mins to even inquire about water which is ridiculous. I have no idea whether this is the normal behavior for waiters here because everywhere else in Chinatown the severs are exceptionally welcoming. Anyhow, we ordered food and drinks. Alcohol prices are decent here. Our order was simple as we were too hungry and were not in the mood of experimenting. For starters we ordered Drums of Heaven and Prawn Crackers. For main course Mixed Fried rice, Mixed Cantoneese Chow, Hot Garlic Chicken and Schezuan Chicken. Food was well seasoned and decent. I am a sucker for cantoneese chow and was quite happy to find the prep delicious. Hot garlic chicken is a very popular choice and I was happy to ave found it as per recommendations. other dishes were not mind blowing though. Service was very poor throughout our meal. 
Overall, its was an experience to have dined in THE famous Kim Ling, but at the same time I would prefer other restros in the vicinity over it.

Touch better than lot of Tangra restaurants because of the food quality. Hard to locate this place amidst those dingy lanes of Tangra. Ambiance was ok and service was average. I was expecting more than what I came across. Little disappointed.

In case you don't have a car, don't even think about this place. Amidst the winding roads of tangra, this hidden temple of food is quite hard to find. It is about a 15-20 mins walk from Beijing( mad friends,mad expedition !). The place doesn't look much from outside, but you won't be disappointed once you go in.
The restaurant has two sections : the bars and a family dine-in.

Ambiance: The family dine-in area is well-lit and has spacious seating. Not very decorated , yet quite acceptable for family outing.
Actually, when you have 5 hungry friends ready to worship their tummy, almost anything would suffice.

Food: Food was ok. I have had better chinese before, and reading all the reviews , i had expected a little more. I don't know whether it was us or the food, but 3 side dishes of starters weren't really enough for 6 and we were craving for more.The so-famous spring chicken was quite blant and  crispy chicken was just average.A double check on our pockets helped us to move to the main course.
We opted for schezuan chow, mixed fried rice, cantonese rice- noodles with chicken sweet and sour, schezuan chicken and chicken Manchurian. About 4 plates of the main course was good for 6 and the proportions in the side dishes were OK.

Service: Service was courteous. However, price was reasonable, not much difference with Beijing. Overall, it was just an average experience.

Tucked in some lanes of Tyangra, lies Kimling. A modest restaurant with bar in "China Town" style.
The quantity of food is hand some. 
For side dishes,  1/2 plate comfortably serves 3 person and for main course,  a full plate serves 2 persons. 
The quality of food is not something out of the world.
The price they charge is definitely on higher side. We took-
1. Thai Soup- it was simply wow
2. Chilly Fish- they fried some fish distinctly related to Bekti and served.  It was not Chilli Fish  at least. 
3. Mixed Friedrice- Good quality rice tossed full in  Chicken, Prawn and Egg.
4. Cantonese Chicken- Simply WOW.

Hence,  
Food- 4.5/5
Ambience- 3.5/5
Value for money- 3.5/5

One of my favorite joints in Tangra, this restaurant offers real value for money. Especially when one wants to relax with friends. Their chilli garlic pepper chicken is a best seller and so is the legendary drums of heaven! Another hot selling item is the crispy fried prawns which is just awesome! Prices are very reasonable and quantity is pretty good. 
Highly recommended.

Have been going to Kim ling almost all my life. It is amazing and their food is amazing. Thai soup and chicken mushroom are the two soups which everyone should try and with the soups u should order a plate of spring chicken. In the main course their Chicken cantonese noodle is really good with fresh vegetable and chili garlic chicken. Their portions a big so order carefully or else u will end up packing the leftovers.

I have been reluctantly taken to this place by a friend, but let me tell you i did not regret it. The food is good and they serve quite generous proportions for affordable prices. We had Drums of heaven and Golden fried prawn for starters , followed by Manchurian chowmein, Chicken szechuan rice-noodles and mandarin fish. It's a decent place and is not much crowded like the other Tangra restaurants. If you are a little low on cash and craving for good Chinese food, this is the place i recommend.

Had read a lot of good reviews about this place so visited this joint around 2 weeks back. We reached around 12.4 and the place was pretty vacant. Location is not that convenient and ambiance is nothing worth mentioning about. Coming to the order we went for 

2 Budweiser 
1 crispy pepper chicken 
Shanghai prawns
Egg Chilly garlic noodles 

The food was ordinary to be quite frank and the quantity was also not impressive . The prawn item though we mentioned gravy was served with pretty less gravy.

The service was average and price like Beijing. The place is not cheap and there are better joints around the place which serve good quantity and taste and price . Overall an average place and experience for me .

I decided to try this place after reading a lot of good reviews. We went for lunch at around 3 p.m. and it was  empty at that time . If you are looking for a place with great ambiance and decor , this is surely not the place. 

We ordered the following items:
# Stir Fried Spinach
# Prawn Rice Noodles 
# Mixed Fried Rice
#  Mandarin fish with Black Bean (suggested by the staff)   (half)
# Garlic Tofu (half)

 I  actually thought the  Stir Fried Spinach would probably be bland but to my surprise it really tasted good. It was cooked with a lot of garlic which gave it a different taste. The Prawn Rice Noodles and the Mixed Fried Rice  was also cooked properly, no extra oil which you often come across in many Chinese food joints, so a thumbs up for that. The Mandarin Fish with Black Bean recommended by the staff was okay, nothing great. Lastly , the garlic tofu was  a surprise  since my experience with tofu has never been been good before. The tofu coating had the right crispiness to it and was also very tender..just loved it.

We ordered the food for 3 people and our bill came close to  1000 bucks, quite reasonably priced and the food served was also enough. The staff was also very courteous . Overall, a good experience.

Kimling used to be our hangout during college days. We were a big group and the round tables here served our purpose of organising birthday parties with friends. The food is always good here and the quantity is huge. The price will never pinch you and if you are in a big group you will be surprised to find out how little you paid comapred to the food and drinks you consumed. i love the manchow soup here and the pepper chicken. The service is usually prompt and quick. You have to be be an early bird here during weekends as the place tends to get filled up very soon.

Ordered Prawn Crackers, Prawn Fried Crispy and Pepper Chilly Garlic for Starters and Mixed Cantonese Noodles for Main course. I am not a Gravy Noodles fan but I just want to try it once at China Town and I did But seriously I don't like it at all. But The Appetizer I love it i mean the Chicken and the prawn was awesome. The taste is seriously I will not forget.

Kim Ling: A place with a quirky entrance but decent dining. 
========================
Location: Kim Ling is located in the Tangra after crossing Beijing Restaurant and even the Royal enfield service center. 
========================
Intro: 
I had been hearing a lot from my foodie friends about Kim Ling and finally i got the chance to try this place. As i went there, the ambience was quite strange to me. They had three sections. First and foremost was the bar section. Thereafter came the staff section and then the restaurant. When i went there it was around 2:00 pm and after trying beijing, i understood how the gravy portions work in Tangra. After taking my seat, i began ordering the food. 
========================
Food ordered:

1) Chicken Sweet Corn Soup (Small) - The small portion was enough to feed me. Quite as large as we get in restaurants. I can't expect more. It was excellent to taste. It was neatly made. 

2) Veg Hakka Chow - The chow was way too oily and it could not be eaten at ALL. I don't know why it had to happen with me. 

3) Chilly Garlic Paneer ( Half) - The paneer was well made and saute in the greavy. The half plate gravy portions they serve in tangra are serve in plates and not bowls which is a little bit weird to me. However, it was also quite oily too. 
========================
Pros:

1) Decent seating capacity.
2) Has a bar too as well as serves drinks in restaurants.
3) Prompt service. 
4) Reasonably priced. 

Cons:
1) Not suitable for vegetarians. 
2) Hospitality can be improved much more.
========================
Suggestions:

Please try to maintain the oil level. 
========================
Summary: 

Food quality 3.5/5
Food presentation 3.7/5
Taste 4/5
Value for money 3.6/5
Hygiene 3/6/5
Ambience 3.5/5
========================
Conclusion:

I would like to try out the non vegetarian portions as the vegetarian portions did not seem up to the mark to me specially the hakka chow.

The spring chicken can give KFC popcorn a run for their money.Ideal place for weekend with freinds albiet with a bottle of beer.The place well does not score high in terms of ambience though.

My first experience of China Town was having dinner at dis vry particular place long time back..After dat I have visited several times.This place have travelled ages. Lot of things have changed around da place but the one thing which havent changed is da passion for delevering quality Chinese delicacies.
Prawn lovers shud definately try da Golden Fried Prawn..Trademark dish of dis restaurant is da Chili Crab claws a must try. Infct this restaurant is da 1st to have presented this dish.However nowadays u can get this in most of da restaurants. Fried Rice & Noodles tastes excellent. Shud also try Crispy fish, Thai soup, Chilli Garlic pepper chicken to name among few. I can rest assure u will not be disappointed with da quality of da food & service. Infct this place serves da best quality fish in China Town.
You may find da ambience not at par with da present day standard or in comparison with ther sister concern Beijing(China Town) & Tung Fong( Park Street) still if u are a big foodie u will be realy satisfied after a quality meal.

Kimling has been an old time favourite restaurant for me for quite a long time..It has always rejuvenated me with the Chinese food they serve.

If you are a foodie at heart with an inclination to get a good quanity of well prepared Chinese cuisine and oblivious about the ambiance(which is below par) as long as your taste buds are satisfied ,then this is the place.

The Schezuan fish ,Spring chicken,Chilli Garlic Chicken  to me are surely the top raters amongst their vast list of palatable Chinese delicacies..

The prices are moderate compared to the quality and quantity of the food they serve..Its always good to be in a group to do justice to the quantities .

Food Quality :-5/5
Quantity :-4.5/5

Great food, good service but a very dingy ambience. That pretty well sums up Kim Ling. Nestled in a place of thriving Chinese restaurants, this place sets the benchmark for quality Chinese cuisine. For people preferring fine dining places, I would request you to buck this place since the ambience and setting is much below par. However for people who solely care about what they eat and how much they get for a certain amount of money, Kim Ling is a treasure trove. 

Priced moderately, Kim Ling is bound to pacify every foodie with their exciting preparations that reflect the heart of Chinese cuisine. The portions they serve are pretty good as well. The service is also acceptable. I have been here a couple of times and have loved every single preparation they offer. Do try out their prawn starters. The honey chicken is also delectable. 

Try out this place if you are not an ambience freak and go gaga over Kim Ling.

Kim Ling is one of those legendary places which serves great Chinese food and has been one of my favorite joints. 
The ambience here isn't something you should be looking out for... 
... If you are one of those who looks out for a good ambience then this isn't a place for you. :) 
This might not be place you would opt for a family dine-in. 
I would suggest for takeaways from here. 

Recommendations 
-Sweet Corn Soup 
-Veg Thai Soup 
-Crispy Chilli Babycorn 
-Sweet n' Sour Vegetables 
-Chilli Garlic Noodles (Veg) 
-Szechuan Rice Noodles (Veg) 

»Portions are quite generous. 

The service is quite brisk and the staff is well-informed. 
Prices are slightly towards the moderate end but personally, I wouldn't mind paying that cost for the food they serve. :) 

Has always been a good experience. :)

Being a Chinese lover, I have been to Kim Ling quite a few times. I enjoyed almost every starters, my favourites are chili garlic pepper chicken, fried baby corn, chili garlic prawn pepper chili garlic fish. In the main course I liked the preparations like chicken in oyster sauce, mixed hakka noodles, mixed fried rice etc.  They use fine rice and uses good amount of chicken pieces in it. The price is very reasonable and food quantity is decent. However, the service is not  so good. You may find the staff members are  bit rude sometimes.

One of the best chinese restaurant in kolkata.. " KIM LING "
Location - 13,South Tangra Road, Kolkata

Decor and Ambience - Pretty much average..like any other typical restaurants in TANGRA.

Service and staffs - Service is fast and staffs are very friendly and polite..always have a smile on there face.They know their job very well

Food recommendation - Sweet corn soup,Chilly garlic prawns,Pepper garlic fish, Chilly garlic crab claws, Honey chicken, Lemon chicken,Hot garlic chicken,Mix rice noodles ( Best hakka noodles in town )

Brief - I have been visiting KIM LING from last 4 years.. I prefer to take the food and enjoy them at my home.. By far the most yummiest rice noodles i have tried.. Its really light and tasty.
The other dishes are very much mouth watering.. Just the right taste to tickle in your taste buds..
KIM LING charges pretty decent price.. Just the place were you can enjoy your food without worrying about your budget.
Overall, a good place for a bash with your friends

You love oriental chicken..  You go here.
You love fried prawns..  You go here. 
You love Vegetarian delicacies..  Well,  still you go here. 

A place so small,  you might mistake it for a run of the mill restro. But once the food is inside you,  washed down with a couple of beers,  you know the taste you had been missing all your life.

Well it was my second time at Chinatown and first at Kim Ling and I was not at all disappointed. The ambience is nothing special or up to the levels of top resturants in Kolkata to be very honest. Nice family resturant and normal interiors. 
Coming to food. Well this is what matters more than anything and am impressed.
I ordered Pepper Fish and Thai Soup for Starters and I was not disappointed. They both tasted quite good especially the former. Nice crispy fresh fish and great to start with. The soup was quite good as well. Quantity being very nice. So for the main course. I ordered Cantonese Chicken Chow ( Gravy ), Lemon Chicken as I heard its quite nice there and it was indeed and Szechuan Fish. Quantity again good and taste as well. Very perfect. Typical. The Chow could have done with some less gravy though. Would have been better.
But overall my experience was quite nice. Food quite good. Not that pricey too.

I will give it a 4 because of the ambience. Which could have been way way better but food is quite good. Can well be given a shot.

I don't venture into Tangra often, the evening lights and the narrow gullyes make me feel lost.One afternoon, after reading Poorna's review for Kim Fa, I embarked on my Tangra adventure. Many did not know Kim Fa which lead to a long search for it...  we finally found it, but it was closed and so went for Kim Ling nearby.
The place has minimal decorations,The waiters were so helpful with their suggestions and amiable.
The food is great, I dont think you can go wrong with ordering anything from here. The Honey Chicken was absolute perfection- chicken glistening in stickiness of the bitter-sweet caramelised honey along with a dash of lemon. The hakka noodles was a it on the oilier side for me, but tasted good. Thai chicken had a slightly pungent flavor which I adored. The portions are generous, and tastes excellent. 
Obviously, I would be going back for more and would urge you to do the same.

This place has been on my list of favs everytime I visit kolkata. I particularly make it a point to visit Tangra...for Kimling of course. An old hotspot since my University days...Kimling still remains unshaken and retains its standards. The portions are huge and great value for money. Talking about the taste...its authentic chinese. The place has a nice, casual feel to it...its done up in an inexpensive kind of way. The place usually stays full with families and groups chatting away to glory....something we come across almost everywhere in Kolkata. We bongs are in love with our addas...and the ambiance and food at kimling suits just right. 

I have tried a lot of stuff on their never ending menu and everything tasted oh soo good!  Be it the chilly garlic prawns, or the chicken rice noodles (thin glassy noodles aka meifoon), the dry deep fried chilly chicken or the mixed fried rice...it was all in all an ultimate gastronomic experience. Going back for more!!!

I visited Kim Ling 1st almost 5 years back when they made some very good chinese dishes at an affordable price,since then i have visited the place quite a number of times and its disheartening that their prices hiked but not the quality. I was a huge fan of their garlic pepper chicken but the last time i visited i somehow doesnt liked its taste. The Sweet n Sour or honey chickens have a tendency of tasting very sweet than expected. Also i felt that the quantity where Kim Ling edged other biggies in Tyangra like Beijing or Big Boss has also been reduced. Previously a full plate of fried rice could be easilly shared by 2 persons, sometimes 3 also if they are not gluttons like me. But now it wasnt enough for filling 2 plates fully. Anyway, I still like their Cantonese Chow which stands out with its mellow taste. Other than that their prawns are also quite good. The ambience is descent in the family section but the bar section looks a little shabby and seating there with women is not quite recommended and they might feel uncomfy but great place to chill with male buddies. Service is apt..a little on the slower side. This place remains crowded almost all the time even in the weekdays.. so try to reserve beforehand if going out with family. Overall, a very good restaurant earlier presently not on their best form. If u want better fooding experience Beijing might be your pick, But its more pocket friendly than beijing.

Good quality food. Would specially like to mention about crab claws and chilli garlic prawn. Tastes like heaven. But the ambience (except the family area) is lousy, noisy and full of young drunkards. Its like a normal local bar.Would have rated as 3.5 but minus .5 for the ambience. However, the family area is decent and peaceful but I was taken aback to find that they won't even allow you to enter the family area if you don't have at least one girl in your group. We were forced to sit in the lousy general area. A little later we found a friend of us there and asked her to join us so that we could enter the family area. Also, bottle system (for liquor) is not allowed in the family area, only peg system is allowed. So guys, if you wan't to enjoy the food here in a decent ambience, get a girl into your group. :)

Though I am not from Kolkata, but being a born-Bong I had heard of the “Tyangra” and its Chinese cuisine from the time eternity, and it was my wish to try it once, as soon as possible.

During my last visit to Kolkata, we went there on one afternoon for lunch. As I and my wife both never been to that area, relied upon certain foodie friends’ recommendations and searched for Kim Ling. In Google Maps the place is wrongly tagged, so had to ask people to reach there.

The entrance is a lane – it looked like an illegal bar rather than a restaurant. Anyhow, went inside and was surprised to see that even at that time of day (it was around 2 PM), on a weekday (7th Feb, 2014), 50% of tables were occupied. We were seated promptly. We ordered pepper chicken and honey chicken for starter and chicken Cantonese chow-mien & schezwan chicken for main course, along with some beers.

While giving the orders, I clearly told the waiter (who looked an old and experienced person) that I will ask them when to bring the main course, as we wanted to enjoy beer for some time. The starters came, and surprisingly after 5 minutes the main courses also came!! In starter, pepper chicken was OK (strictly “OK”). Honey chicken tasted like it was prepared from molasses – it was sticky for the teeth and for the plate too (the chicken pieces were sticking to the plate). Taste was horrible. In maincourse, the semi-gravy chow-mien was great, but in schezwan chicken I did not what they had put (seems certain weird sauce or pickle) which gave it a very yellowish colour and tangy-pickly taste.

And I heard that Tyangra restaurants were supposed to be cheap. When the bill came, I was slightly surprised as it was nothing but cheap. 2 beers, 2 chicken starters, one chicken chow and one chicken main course was priced at Rs 1359. Nothing out of control or very expensive but not cheap either – it was fairly at par with any good restaurant.

Overall, a not so good experience and did not met the high expectation we had from Tyangra.

Tasty food at a reasonable price!

During our annual Kolkata visit during Dec-2013 to mid-Feb-2014, we had gone for lunch to Kim Ling at Tangra, erstwhile China Town of Kolkata. We were two of us and had ordered for Crispy Honey Chicken, Chinese Chop Suey and Chicken Fried Rice. The food was freshly prepared and tasty. The service was swift and friendly. The items are reasonably priced so as to provide value for money. The ambience is not fancy but down-to-earth. Kim Ling is recommended for singles, couples, friends and family. It is best to avoid the front portion of the restaurant, where the bar crowd can be found and is noisy. It is best to go to the middle or rear halls/rooms for a quiet & peaceful meal, particularly, if you are with children and family. Car parking is available in the adjoining lane and also on the street in front.

This is certainly one of the best Chinese eateries in China Town. In the midst of other much hyped contemporaries located in Tantra, Kim Ling is a welcome change in terms of food quality and pricing. The food is way above average and the prices are sooper reasonable. Its a must-visit when you're treating a huge group of friends, who, er, love their liqour a lil too much :) So I give 4 stars to Kim Ling for being what it is.

One of the best Chinese restaurants in town. 
I had ordered for Honey Chicken as my starter, Chicken Rice Noodles, Lemon Chicken (gravy) and Chicken Manchurian (dry).

Chicken Rice Noodles from Kim Ling is my all time favourite so I loved it, Chicken Manchurian was the best among the four items. Lemon Chicken was good. Honey chicken was extremely gooey and I loved the caramelised flavour of it.

No wonder Zomatoers gives this place a Very Good(4) rating :P
Have tried their take away mostly.

*Location -  Tangra : The CHINA TOWN,Kolkata(need I say more) :P

*Food - They are the masters of Chinese at Kolkata.
Had packed Mixed Fried rice and Chilly Chicken(dry) for dinner.
The rice was of huge quantity and had large quantity of chicken,egg and prawn. I prefer their dry chilly chicken, they are very much chilly and loads of chicken pieces :D Taste is just perfect of chinese :) They look yummy as well(pics attached).

*Purse Check - Marvellously pocket friendly. At these rates such brilliant quality of food is mind blowing. We all are ready to pay if the food quality is good right? Trust me they are worth paying this much.

*Overall - Very much satisfied with my dinner tonight :P
I am going to hit back again soon and have a dine in :D

Enjoy :) very much recommended :) The chinese food lovers of Kolkata must try China Town once before dieing :P

The food made me INSANE and I grant them a 5 pointer :P

We went to kim ling after reading positove reviews of this place and I did expect it to be good. And kim ling did meet my expectations. The food here is just what one could expect from a decent china town restaurant. We started our meal with chili garlic pepper chicken and to be honest I wanted to have more after emptying one plate. Not that the quantity was less but it was delicious. We then ordered chicken rice noodles with chicken in black bean sauce and manchurian chicken. The latter one was a bit less salty to my taste, but the combination went very well. I was very delighted with the food but the service totally displeased me. The waiters seemed reluctant to attend, not sure if it was like that because it was crowded but we had to wait quite a bit to order the food and receive the bill. That is the sole reason I could not give it a very high rating.
Also the menu needs to be updated. The prices are a tad higher than shown.

The food - nothing special
The place - crammed and crappy
The hospitality - least to expect
The courtesy - none

We ordered some foods and beers, and while drinking the beer; we were served one plate of prawn chips. Since we did not order for it, we were under the assumption those were complimentary.
Within few minutes, waiter comes and informs it was a mistake. Since we were already eating it; he informed we were to pay for this. But as we did not order it, I refused. The manager came in; and had the same odd request. I refused again. Guess what happened next - the plate with the remaining chips were promptly taken away from our table. Good riddance I suppose, but I was wondering who will be served with that after we leave (or even before it)?

We had guests with us who were new to Kolkata and never been in ChinaTown - it was utterly embarrassing and shocking.

Save yourselves and find a better restaurant.

Again, one of my favorite chinatown haunts. this place promises amazing food. True, the ambience is not very nice but the taste of food is awesome. I love to eat the haka noodles (mixed) and the lemon chicken here. The dry chilli chicken is as always a favorite dish of mine. Among gravy chickens and fishes, I prefer the garlic, the ginger and the sweet and sour. The chicken is soft and tender and goes down very well with pepsi. 

I do not like to drink alcohol here because the ambience is not worth it and they often serve you in plain glasses which is not my way of drinking. However, I feel that it is completely worth coming here and enjoying a lovely lunch or a dinner. I recommend this place with full gusto!

One of the oldest restaurants in Tangra and proponents of the Tangra type Chinese food of Kolkata. Very tasty food and at reasonable rates. The chicken and prawn is really delicious and well made, not so happy with the fish though. The Honey Chicken is good and so is the dry chilly chicken. The prawns are just about ok. But, the rice noodles is really light and tasty. Overall, a good place for a bash with a few friends.

The restaurant is actually split in two sections - one of them designated as the family area. Drinks are served in both sections though if you are a group going heavy on the drinks, it may be a better idea to avoid the family area. Food is fair enough - but I felt it may not be worth the trouble of travelling to this place for it - you can get similar or better Chinese fare elsewhere in the city, for the price. Staff is courteous and service is good enough. Ambience is OK.

We were in the mood for some dry starters and prawn fries. Being on the road driving on the bypass - tangra was an obvious choice. 

I haven't eaten at too many places in tangra , but my friend confirms that this place serves the tastiest food in the area. So Kim ling it was. 

Valet parking is a huge help in the congested road. The ambience and decor is slightly better than your college canteen. Service and crockery/ cutlery used is less restaurant more club like of this city.

To be honest I prefer the Chinese at park street or mainland c. But yeah it's different and a treat to many in this city. 

However don't be fooled by the shabbiness of the joint - it doesn't reflect on the price tag. You might end up paying more than you would at bbcue in park street.

EVERY TIME I VISIT KIMLING AND GET PAMPERED BY THEIR FOODS, AMBIENCES, AND DECORATION. RECENTLY THEY HAVE OPENED THEIR NEW SECTION FOR FAMILY. FIRST OF ALL I HAVE STARTED WITH THEIR STARTERS, DRUMS OF HEAVEN... EVERY TIME WHEN I TAKE IT I FEEL THE TASTE OF HEAVENLY PLESSURE. ITS JUST AWESOME. IN THE MAIN COURSE SECTION I HAVE ORDERED CHICKEN FRIED RICE . MANCHURIAN FISH AND GARLIC CHICKEN. ALL 3 S ARE VERY GOOD IN TASTE. AND THEIR MUSHROOM SOUP IS ALSO VERY FINE TO TASTE. BUT THEY HAVE SERVED THE SOUP IN A VERY BIG BOWL. THAT IS WHY THE QUANTITY IS ENOUGH FOR 3 PERSON IF U ORDERED 1 SOUP. PRICE OF ALL FOODS ARE VERY MODERATE. LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST ITS A VERY GOOD PLACE FOR FAMILY DINING.

I consider ‘Kim Ling’ to be the best value for money Chinese restaurant in Kolkata.
I like it so much that I try to find any excuse to visit and stuff my face with their food. 
Staffs are friendly and the ambiance is fine as the place is always crowded. My mates also prefer ‘Kim Ling’ for having alcohol for its low prices. But be warned, don’t get too drunk coz madam (owner) might through you out of the place by herself.  There is a family dining area, so if you go with your family and want some seclusion, they might open that area for you. I have gone through most of their dishes so I recommend that you try pepper chicken and lemon chicken as a starter. Half plate will feed 2 people. There chicken pakora and fish pakora are really crispy and goes well with the chatni/dip they provide. On main course you got to try there Cantonese noodles its heavenly, it has a mild flavor to it, with it must try is Chicken with black bean sauce, they really complement each other. Another good one is their honey chicken. If you ask me stick with their chicken items although crab preparation is also divine but its better that we avoid because if crab is not washed properly, they might give you food poisoning. So basically, you will not be disappointed with their food and the whole in your pocket will not be significant unless your friends trick you in paying the entire bill and not paying you back….god damm it!!

Kim Ling is my home in Tangra - The China Town of Kolkata. I have been there on numerous occasions and even today if asked for good Chinese food in Kolkata, I would recommend Kim Ling blind fold. Of course the decor and ambience is very ordinary but u have a family room where you will be reasonably comfortable with ladies and children. The men's section is like a local bar with lot of noise and vivid drinkers. I luv both the sections depending on my company. The food is delicious right from the word go. Prawn chips, chilli garlic button mushroom / baby corn, fried prawns, she wan fried chicken / prawn, chilli garlic prawn are some of my favourite starters. They also have crab claws which is a must try for sea foodies.  In soup one can try the lemon coriander , chicken clear, sweet corn chicken or chicken noodle soup. My favourite main course is Pan fried Cantonese mixed noodle with either lemon / garlic / honey / shezwan chicken or prawn. The place has some uniqueness in the menu. You can order small or medium or large prawns and the rates vary. You can also order Half or Full plates. It's a bar and you can order drinks bottle wise too when you are in a group. I luv the food here and I have one dish out side the menu which is garlic tossed pak choi ....which I luv to order all the time. Be there if you luv Chinese cuisine !!!

Yeah, definitely they are one of the best in town for schezuan and cantonese Style Indian Chinese food, Pretty old and famous too. But, if you are looking for an ambience, please don't go. Worst of the lot in ambience as well as staff is not very friendly, though they do their job kinda professionally, but, the atmosphere inside is not even like a good pub, it is something you can only compare with nasty local drink joints for hoodlums. Awful place for dine in, specially with your family. Again the main course and specially staples (like fried rice or noodles) are not at all up to the mark. The best advise would be to go and pack yummy starters and very few real good mains, get some staples from any other good restaurant and have them all at your home. Soup and starters are best in class, mains are just good to okay and staples are almost not edible with only a few exceptions (like cantonese rice or mixed rice noodle). By the way, they serve one of the best home made sauce (green chilli sauce in town). Another downer, the doormen sitting outside will never help you to get a cab or depark your car, but, after you find a cab yourself and get onto it, they'll come together and very strangely almost stick to you and don't let you go unless you pay them a tip (don't know why, probably they have not taught the manners or the management don't pay them, the tips are actually their pay, not at all helping and courteous, but, very irritating).

Kimling is the very first place where I ate in Tangra over 2 decades back ! Its the founder concern of Bejing ,Tung Fung and Mandarin ... and I still keep on going back for more.
Starters that I recommend are the Crab Claws ( which are hardly ever available now sadly ) , Chicken Wantons , Chilli Garlic Prawns , Spring Chicken , Honey Chicken and the Chiili Garlic Baby Corn. For soup the hands down favourite is the Thai Soup. Our usual order for the main course is Mixed Rice Noodles, Fried Rice teamed up with Hot Garlic Prawn/Chicken , Chilli Chicken , Lemon Chicken . For those who want something light and different (although many may find it bland) try the Cantonese Rice. Don't miss out on their awesome green chilli sauce which is my absolute favourite but is very spicy !

Woah man what a place....simply delicious I would say. The food pricing is very affordable and hence your main area of worry already vanishes. The Chinese food here is prepared very well and the quantity of food too is quite impressive. 
The ambience is nothing mind boggling but decent I would say. The staff are friendly and cordial. When service is good it always turns you on and you simply cannot brood no matter how depressed or tensed you are. 
Overall this place seemed awesome to me and I rate it 4 without any hesitation. You must visit this one if you happen to be in this area.

On a scorching afternoon, to celebrate a birthday and an anniversary, my friends and I tediously journeyed to Kim Ling. Upon entering, I noticed the dimly lit, air-conditioned and cosy dining space. We were a group of six and were immediately led to a large round table in the corner.

From the elaborate menu, we ordered the usual Chinese fare: Spring Chicken for starters plus Chicken with Baby Corn and Mushroom and Dry Hot Garlic Chicken to go with several plates of Hakka Chow and Fried Rice (Chicken and Mixed) for the main course.

Soon we were staring at handsome (it reached the point where we encouraged each other to have one more morsel) amounts of delicious Chow and Rice. Spring Chicken was tasty and adequately crunchy. Garlic Chicken stood out with its spicy flavours. However, Chicken with Baby Corn and Mushroom was completely bland and we knew we would regret it as soon as we spotted the dull-looking dish on our table.

Towards the end of our meal, it did feel like the servers were rushing us. Other than that, Chinese here never does disappoint - a most satisfying meal. To top it off, we overate at a modest expense of around a grand.

STILL GOING STRONG!
3.5 out of 5

After all these years Kim Ling still remains popular among kolkatans for its delish Chinese delicacies. While other places have witnessed a decline in food quality, this is not the case with this very famed Chinese restaurant. The food is genuine and authentic Chinese fare. The food portions are overwhelming especially at the cost that it is available from the restaurant. 

There has not been much significant change in the decor and ambience of the place. It still has that old world Tangra charm. The furnishings are simple without much change in the decor of the room. The servers are all very friendly and well mannered. The food service is always prompt and efficient.  Besides the food, it is the friendly environment of the restaurant. The crab claws - when they are available- are a specialty of this restaurant. It is regarded by many to be their house best seller.

There are a number of things from the menu that are simply to die for. For soups, the Thai soup is still the reigning champion. It is the much sought after soup dish. The broth tastes excellent with generous amount of seafood and chicken pieces. Otherwise, even their hot and sour soup is a strong contender. Kim ling Chicken items like hot garlic chicken, spring chicken and lemon chicken (dry) are perennial favorites of diners. Even seafood items like hot garlic fish, mandarin fish and fish fingers are typical foodie's delights. Not to forget about their Momos; whether it is chicken or pork; they are always juicy and big in size. Pork items are also available in their noodle and fried rice section as well.

The food of this evergreen restaurant is always meant to be relished with full satisfaction. The food served here can be compared to those served at certain high end restaurants like Mainland China for instance.

This was a family favourite and was looking forward to a great lunch on my recent yearly visit to Kolkata, but was sadly disappointed. 
located in Tangra, we dont go to Kim ling for the decor which is plastic chairs, and ratty table cloth.In those terms Kim Ling lived up to its heritage.
Our waiter was a bit gruff when we asked him about the specials. "we serve standard chinese food, no specials here." The classic dishes were ordered- pepper garlic prawns (definitely recommended), chicken wantons,lemon chicken (which was very good as usual),american chopsuey, crispy chicken (do not order this),meinfoon noodles (recommended),and gravy chow (pan fried gravy noodles).
The food was good, and I must say that it depends on what you are ordering and it helps to know what is good here before you come to Kim Ling. This is one of those places where if you ask what is good, they always say everything! (which by the way is not the case as we saw with the crispy chicken)
The surprise was when we got the cheque. My mother is the kind of person who pays what the bill states with a generous tip to go. Thankfully we checked the bill this time and were horrified to note that we had been given a hefty liqour bill!! We had not had any hard drinks and when we asked for a correction the establishment was quite unhelpful and WORSE unapologetic. After a tedious change of bill we left with a bad taste in the mouth and a vow to not return to Kim Ling.

It is probably the undisputed champion in the sector of Chinese food in Kolkata and remarkably has maintained its splendid food quality over the years....
For starters, I must recommend the Crab Claws and Lemon Chicken (dry) ;
and for Mains, the superb Rice Noodles is worth your money!

This place is quintessential Tangra. The food is absolutely brilliant. However the ambience  leaves a lot to be desired but then thats part of the old Tangra feel. Must visit if you want to eat chinese in Kolkata

Clearly the second best restaurant in Calcutta to have Chinese ( after Mainland China ). I have been visiting this place from my early childhood, since 1996. And even now in 2013, the food and the ambiance is still exactly the same.

Simple furnishings in a rectangular room, this place (like any other Tyangra restaurant) is famous for the food and not the decor. That's why they didn't change a single bit of it in 20 years.

Starters like Drums of Heaven and chilli garlic pepper chicken are worth trying.
RICE NOODLES are fantastic. Period.

Food: 4.5/5
Ambiance: 3/5

Way back in 1992, this place first made me taste the essential beauty of Chinese cuisine, and we dined on crab claws and mandarin fish and chicken with button mushrooms in a large table, perfect for a group of 12. From then, I have kept on visiting and revisiting, my experience, not even once, bad. Maybe its the friendly service, or the fact that they seem to be hanging on to every word I say? 

In the years since 1992, they have opened Beijing, and they apparently are the owner of Tung Fong and Mandarin as well. I specially recommend a number of things straight off the menu. The Thai soup is gorgeous, filled with bits of chicken and seafood in a superb broth. The chilli garlic pepper chicken and spring chicken are perennial favorites. So is the fish in hot garlic sauce and rice noodles. Service is fast and friendly.
