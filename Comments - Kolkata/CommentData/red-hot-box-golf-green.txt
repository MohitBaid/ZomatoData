Nice outlet . it's small but the menu is big ...with good behavior of staff's working there . deliveries sometimes are time taking ..but food is good .. Guess it's under rated .. Pocket friendly .. Quality of food is good compared to the price .
Yakitori chicken is an unusual  starter ..must try it once .
Different variety of rice and noodles available here .

Rated pretty low, but I kid you not. Try the Butter Garlic Chicken, Devil Chicken, Veg Fried Rice, and you too would beg to differ. They need to work on the consistency, but otherwise, they're top class for the pocket pinch.

It was one of those days when you want to have something good but don't want to spend too much. We came across this food joint and was impressed instantly when we saw a variety of foods in such low prices. So we decided to order 1 schezwan chicken and a butter ginger chicken with veg noodles and veg fried rice.
The amount of the food was humongous, more than enough for three people. Plus the butter ginger chicken was too good. Fried rice was also good. Noodles & schezwan chicken were mediocre, but you can't really expect extra ordinary food in such cheap prices.
Bottom-line: if you are looking for variety of foods in low budget, this is the place.

Red Hot Box is a kiosk located near Golf Green , which mainly serves Chinese cuisines at a very affordable price.

Service is quick with well behaved staffs.

Tried crispy chilli baby corn , mixed fried rice & garlic chicken . All were tasty and well cooked. 

Though the ambience is not good, but the food taste and quantity is enough to make you come here.

যদি খাবার নিয়ে খুব খুঁত ধরার বাই না থাকে তাহলে এরকম জায়গায় যেতে পারেন । পরিমানে প্রচুর , উষ্ণ আতিথেয়তা সবই পাবেন । খালি বসার জায়গা নেই । ফ্রায়েড  রাইস এ দক্ষতা আছে ।

Its a ordinary joint near golf green. You can only opt for takeaway. Behaviour of the guys was polite and friendly. We ordered Chicken fried rice and chilly chicken. Chicken fried rice was superb in taste but chilly chicken is ok type. Overall a normal road side joint were you can have casual dinner but when you are opting for party it i snot recommended.

Had steamed chicken momos from here once. I must say it was utterly pathetic. Didn't love the fillings at all and the covering was really thick. Everything was competent enough to kill your cravings for momos.

To be true and fair, the food is not bad. Though the place from outside might seem a little less inviting, but this is a pure case of not judging the book by its cover.

I have visited thus place a couple of times, both times opting for take aways. Some of the items I settled for, included red pepper chicken, pan fried fish, devil chicken, garlic and pepper fish and mixed fried rice. 

When you start off with an outlet this small, one of the best ways to attract the crowd is to offer larger quantities of food at a pocket friendly price. This is exactly what this place has done and hence is comfortably banking upon the pockets of single men/women staying away from home and students.

Coming back to the food. The starters and the sides I settled for were average with decent flavors. There were no extraordinariness in either of them that will probe me to write any more adjectives. The fried rice though, is a bit disappointing. It is very dry, surely needs an extra splatter of oil.

Found you.. Haha..

I simply love their food. Had ordered many times from Foodpanda or calling them directly. Speaking about the food, their quality and quantity of food is excellent. Simple yet delicious. 

From konjee crispy chicken to crispy chili babycorn then fried chicken wings, chicken chilli garlic rice, drums of heaven, tom yum soup and so many items i cant recall now. 

They prepare their dishes exquisitely no doubt. Din't had the opportunity to try lamb or prawn.Keep feeding our hungry tummy's :P

I am totally in love with the crispy, chili fried baby-corn! Although the fried rice, and mixed chow wasn't so good - the garlic chicken is yummy. Just wish there was a seating arrangement, but otherwise it's a great place to dine at!

Tried there Crunchy Fish. Pure Bhetki was given and its similar like fish fry but much better. Its a must try from this outlet. I opted for home delivery and they delivered fresh and hot in no time.
