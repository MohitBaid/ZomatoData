I have went their many times. The angara chk tandoori of this place is remerkable. Chk 65 is also very good. But the quality of biriyani has never improved. Once i ordered butter chk which was also not good. But the rezala and the dal makhani of this place is very nice. It is just beside the em byepass and you can try it.

We ordered lunch for a Team Lunch, in Cognizant, Bantala. The order came in expected time. I must say the restaurant people are very irresponsible, they didn't give Mutton in Mutton Biriyani, after calling them they first agreed to refund later they told they will give a fresh plate of Mutton Biriyani delivered. They delivery came 2 hrs late and the delivery boy was asking the old biriyani back. Shameless! Really disappointing. Will try to avoid Sanjha Chula next time I order.

A little low on the variety but catches up by having two cuisines. The food is good for the price. You can also catch the buffet to have a variety of kebabs. The service is really good. You can try the chicken 65 if you're a spicy food fanatic. And you can try the murgh makhan Malai Wala if you're not interested in spicy food. Be sure to taste the garlic naan and assortments of bread.

This is a very nice place with nice decor and pretty good staffs with quick service. We ordered only Mutton Biriyani. It was pretty good in taste. A bit oily but not that spicy. Will definitely visit this place again.

So today on 1st Jan we went there and after waiting for 20 mins we managed to grab a table . The ambience is overall nice. They attended us very promptly and our order was served in no time. So we ordered 3 mutton biriyani which was light and rich in aroma. Though my mutton piece was not properly cooked but overall we liked it.

Paisa wasool khana. Always tried to deliver timely.Baby corn starters are awesome. Paneer and chicken main courses along with masala kulcha are delicious. However, there are scopes of improvement and they should try to make it better, specially the rice items.

Located near Ruby hospital, this outlet of sanjha chulha is way better than the one at southern avenue.
Went there on 30th dec.greeted warmly by the staff we were offered a window seat.It was around 5.30 pm and were not sure whether any food will be available but to our surprise the service was swift and our order was placed promptly on our table.
We ordered mutton biryani, chicken butter masala, keema and raita.
Special mention to the mutton biryani which was a great relief from the plate of saturated fat we are usually served at the more popular biryani joints of Kolkata.
Very satisfying experience.keep up the good work

Sanjha chulha is one of those modern restaurants that pertain to both the old world cooking norms of a typical punjabi delicacies and new age concept of healthy food. 
Me and a few other friends went there some time back. We ordered the huge assortment of non vegetarian kebabs called Balochi tashtari and had burnt garlic rice and schezwan noodles accompanied by Devil's chicken and Chilly garlic Fish. And then we moved on to and we were awed by the gulag jamun on rabri for dessert. 
The kebabs were well done and beautifully proportioned. 16 pieces of meat comprising fish and prawn and lamb and chicken done in various techniques and grilled to perfection in the bhatti.  
However the only complaint I had was with the main course for the burnt garlic rice was not that strong on the beautiful flavour of charred garlic. It was more on a softer caramelised version. And same with the Schezwan rice because it wasn't that spicy. But I absolutely adored the Rabri with gulab jamun for a hot gulab jamun fried in clarified  butter placed on a not so sweet but consistent portion of thick rabri can do wonders to the taste buds. 
Overall , it was a pleasant experience.
In my opinion, the decor could be done better and the menu could be modernised a little more. The service was pleasant if not great.

It is pretty bad in almost all sense. I have previously gone to their Deshopriyo Park outlet and thay was far better but this Ruby area outlet is not up to the mark. We went there on Christmas eve and the only satisfying point was we didn't need to wait and that's it. We ordered Mixed Noodles, Chicken Manchurian, Chicken Clear Soup, Naan, Chicken Bharta, Chicken Methi Malai. The Indian dishes were ok but the chinese food was horrible. The soup was tasteless and the Chicken Manchurian contained very small pieces of chicken. Sorry but they weren't even that much efficient too regarding the service.

It's easy to locate. It's located near ultodanga bridge..at uttarpanchanan bus stop(2 stpages after Ruby area).
It's not so much specious..but well decorated..and ambience is pleasant!
We ordered murg makhmali kebab, chicken biriyni, butter nun, mutton Rogan josh.
I specially liked their makhmali kebab 😋😋 all the items were lip smacking 😋
Good service..
Cost is relatively high (slight)

I always have believed that chicken tikka and Biryani are a match made in heaven. I wish restaurants in Kolkata also start believing this. Chicken tikka biryani is a rage in Bangalore and most of southern India.
I was carving for it from quite a long time. So I zomatoed it and this restaurant came up. 
The chicken tikka biryani was not exactly what I expected but it was blissful. 
The tikka pieces seem to be the pieces from rolls that was my only disappointment other than that everything was perfect. The taste was awesome loved every bite of it. 
For dessert I had rabri with gulab jamun. 
Everything was awesome.

In the city of Kolkata everyday you get to see a new change in all dimensions and possibilites. Be it any kind of business the aim somewhere loses it’s grip in the long run if not executed well and maintained right throughout the whole venture. Food eating places are the biggest example of success only by holding on long,and the survival totally depends on what you put at the table every single day. Restaurants don’t become a preferred favourite place overnight as it takes years to get a good name and recently i was invited by Supreeta & Shagufta to one such restaurant which has excelled in keeping that flag of customer delights right at the top for over 15 beautiful years now.

First of all, I congratulate the whole team of Sanjha Chulha completing 15 glorious years of impeccable hospitality and sterling quality in the city of Joy. This also brings me to my review of this restaurant as I was invited to the restaurant to celebrate “Special 15” – a occasion marking 15 tears completion of this restaurant featuring 15 popular dishes that is being served at the restaurant at the price of INR 200/- plus GST. The items are : Tandoori Chicken, Murg Malai Kebab, Murg Tikka Kebab, Chicken Geelafi Seekh Kebab, Mutton Jalandari Seekh Kebab, Chutney Paneer Tikka, Bharwaan Aloo, Butter Chicken, Chicken Bharta, Mutton Keema Matar, Paneer Butter Masala, Palak Paneer, Gosht Roganjosh, Pindi Chana and Vegetable Jhaal Fareezi. The “Special 15” offer is valid from November 5 to 30, 2017. Now that is done with, let's get to the real deal.

Coming to the food, here's what we were served :

The starters had Firangee Seekh Kebab, Jugal bandi seekh, Sarson fish tikka, Chutney paneer tikka. All of this was plain awesomeness and more. Juicy and delicious kebabs to begin the feast.

For the mains, we had :


•	Methi malai paneer
•	Chicken Changrezi
•	Rhara ghosht
•	Murgh Tikka Biryani 

These were paired with Dhaba dal, Khasta roti, and Butter naan. On this note, I must say that I had never before tried eating at this restaurant and I seriously regret that decision. The food here is absolutely amazing and authentic adding to that charm of North India with robust flavours and spicy aftertaste. I absolutely loved the mains. The food quality at this restaurant even after 15 years seem absolutely amazing. Perfect north indian food in a fine dining style environment. No more, no less.

For desserts, we had Phirni and Gulab Jamun with Rabri. I loved the phirni, it was such such a delight. Although somehow I felt that the gulab jamun with rabri could have been better. However, after this hearty meal I definitely have to say that I am going back to this place whenever I have north indian craving for sure. Thank you

Dining at Sanjha Chulha has always been a gleeful experience for me. Recently this Kolkata’s very own North Indian restaurant completed 15 glorious years of its operation. Business partners Asif Ahmed and Anup Mehrotra started off Sanjha Chulha as a small outlet on EM Buypass fifteen years back on October 10, 2002. The place is today well known to every foodie in the city for its impeccable hospitality and sterling quality of dhaba-style comfort food in an impressive classy ambiance. It has truly set a benchmark for restaurants serving North Indian food in the city of joy!

It's not everyday that a restaurant in the City of Joy turns 15.

Yes. You heard it correct. Sanjha Chulha turned 15 recently and we were there to try out their signature dishes. They also introduced a menu where you could choose a dish at just Rs. 200 each. Congratulations on this achievement.

Located near Science City, this branch is a casual dining restaurant where one can lavishly dine with friends and family. As we entered this outlet, we were warmly greeted and the staff provided us a table. With dim lights and a casual ambience, this joint will automatically grab your attention.

We started off with :

1. Firangee Seekh Kebab : WOW! One of the best kebabs I've ever had in my life. They were smooth, consistent and flavourful. The authentic taste and the wonderful texture will make you crave for more and more.

2. Jugal Bandi Seekh : The kebabs had a spicy and fully loaded taste as it had a lot of condiments. It tasted amazing too. Damn. What a great start it was!

3. Sarson Fish Tikka : This kebab will definitely leave an impact on you. The marination and smokiness being on point, the taste which came out was outstanding!

4. Chutney Paneer Tikka Kebab : Loaded with spices and served with green chutney, this veg kebab tastes splendid.

The kebab section turned out to be an absolute hit. Every kebab delicacy tasted so well that it left me confused which one to vote for. In the main course, we opted for,

5. Murgh Tikka Biryani : Eternal love for Biryani in Kolkata is from time immemorial. Served with potato, the biryani tasted great. The authenticity of their Biryani was that it was light on the stomach and not at all oily. Extra points for that.

6. Chicken Changezi : This delicacy goes hand in hand with the Biryani. The chicken pieces were well cooked and tossed well with spices which blended well to give an amazing taste.

7. Rhrara Ghosth : It had flavour, taste , aroma, spices as well as delicious marinated soft cubes of chicken. In short, I loved it.

8. Butter Naan/ Khasta Roti with Dhaaba Dal : This combination is deadly. You can choose either Butter Naan or Khasta Roti with the Dhaaba Dal. Both of the two staples go very well with the side dish. The Dhaaba Dal was very tasty and it's presentation was more impressive. It was served in a small bucket which stole my attention.

So this was the grand main course we had. Every dish is amazing just like the other. I highlighted the Non-Veg dishes more as I loved them over the Veg ones! We headed towards the much awaited dessert section without which the meal was incomplete.

9. Firni : The typical firni served in any North Indian restaurant. No such speciality in it. Nevertheless, loved it.

10. Gulab Jamun with Rabri : This was something to cherish for. The hot Gulab Jamun blended perfectly with the Rabri which was delicious! Being a bong myself, there's a special place in my heart for Rabri. Gulab jamun served as an icing on the cake!

The service is great. The waiters are co-operative, to be honest. They have amazing pretty food at a very reasonable cost. I recommend this place for a hearty meal and getting the proper North Indian Touch.

Ambience and Decor : 4.5/5
Pocket Pinch : 4/5
Food quality and quantity : 4.5/5

I would like to start with the expression "OMG" ...
All the foods we tried here are the tastiest foods we ever had till now ...
Drums of heaven tastes like its made in heaven , so yummy.... 
Try their murgh pulao , it's awesome ...
Their mutton roganjosh also smells perfect and the tenderness of the meat is perfect... 
And their murgh malai kebab is sooo tasty ....
Butter naan is quite large by size and also perfectly cooked... 
I am giving them 4* only because of their lill late service...
Otherwise this place deserves more than 5* for their decoration, staff's behaviour, and Specially FOODS....

Both of the two staples go very well with the side dish. The Dhaaba Dal was very tasty and it's presentation was more impressive. It was served in a small bucket which stole my attention.

So this was the grand main course we had. Every dish is amazing just like the other. I highlighted the Non-Veg dishes more as I loved them over the Veg ones! We headed towards the much awaited dessert section without which the meal was incomplete.

9. Firni : The typical firni served in any North Indian restaurant. No such speciality in it. Nevertheless, loved it.

10. Gulab Jamun with Rabri : This was something to cherish for. The hot Gulab Jamun blended perfectly with the Rabri which was delicious! Being a bong myself, there's a special place in my heart for Rabri. Gulab jamun served as an icing on the cake!

The service is great. The waiters are co-operative, to be honest. They have amazing pretty food at a very reasonable cost. I recommend this place for a hearty meal and getting the proper North Indian Touch.

Ambience and Decor : 4.5/5
Pocket Pinch : 4/5
Food quality and quantity : 4.5/5

I would like to start with the expression "OMG" ...
All the foods we tried here are the tastiest foods we ever had till now ...
Drums of heaven tastes like its made in heaven , so yummy.... 
Try their murgh pulao , it's awesome ...
Their mutton roganjosh also smells perfect and the tenderness of the meat is perfect... 
And their murgh malai kebab is sooo tasty ....
Butter naan is quite large by size and also perfectly cooked... 
I am giving them 4* only because of their lill late service...
Otherwise this place deserves more than 5* for their decoration, staff's behaviour, and Specially FOODS....

Visited here couple of times...
Last time I gave my b'day treat here, their food quality, quantity and taste are good enough.
We ordered angara tandoori chicken, drums of heaven, butter naan, kadai murg, fried rice and one more item and in dessert there was gulab jamun..

The taste was really great and according the treat it was kind of pocket friendly and the service was quite impressive.
Want to visit here again. 😊

Sanjha chula has gained quite a name for its north Indian cuisines. From mughlai to Dhaba food this joint has been doing pretty good for itself.
Sanjha Chulha recently completed 15 years and on this happy occasion the restaurant is offering a Pick Any For 200 menu where all the dishes you order will come for 200.
The menu includes the dishes Sanjha Chulha started with bearing their signatures and the offer lasts Till end of November.
The kadhai chicken here has always been a favorite here though and the kebabs!
The vegetarian options are equally wondrous and not a let down.

now coming to the food. it has also changed but sadly has detoriated. still i would recommend the butter chicken and reshmi kababs.
they are pretty good n go well with butter nan!

A COMPLETE ONE STOP FOR NORTH INDIAN...ITS ALWAYS BEEN KEEPING UP ITS QUALITY AND SERVED THE BEST ONE OF NORTH INDIAN CUISINE IN KOLKATA..THE HOME DELIVERY IS FAST AND ON TIME..The new outlet near Vivekannda park had a good feel to it. 
About the menu. Everything is top class ..
In Veg selection I would recommend 
1. The paneer 65
2. Dhabba daal
3. Jaal frazi 
4. Paneer lababdar
5. Daal makhni
And garlic naan and kulcha 

Just go there to feel the goodness

Have ordered countless number of times while working during the graveyard shift.

They are open till 2 in the morning and travel pretty far to deliver orders which is an USP.

They serve typical dhaba food but are not consistent in terms of seasoning their dishes.

Its a great place for lunch or dinner if you are ready to spend a little to relish your taste buds.
Its a beautiful decorated restaurant .
We ordered -
Shahi pulao : Good Quantity, great taste . The aroma itself did justice to the name of the dish. And the taste was like cherry on the top. And yes cherry literally... ever thought of trying cherries with pulao? No, right? Well then u should give this one a try . Cherries, paneer, vegetables  and papaya bkended in the best possible way.
Cheese kulcha : Melted cheese and capsicum will do the magic for you.
Kadhai paneer and Malai kofta : Both were very well cooked ... quantity is also ok. The dishes were a tital thumbs up.

And luckily we visited Sanjha Chulha on the day they had their birthday . And we were given complimentary sweets and cold drinks. Also a sweet gift from sanjha chulha .

Sanjha chulah last day of the pujas was bound to be a hit and miss yet with great expectations we soldiered on . We stepped in almost around 11 pm but were promptly seated irrespective of the place being chocablock with diners. The service is great here and more than makes up for the restricted puja menu. We ordered the chicken bharta which was nice except it wasn't chicken bharta at all just a generic chicken in malai and badam gravy. Very nice but not bharta. Also the same to be said for the mutton roghanjosh . The hero on the plate was the tandoori jhinga . The butter tandoori rotis and kulcha were rock hard  and chewy . This is a good place for kebbabs and tandoori but that's about it.

We have ordered multiple times from here for office lunch parties. We have also dined out here. They have never failed with flavours and quantity. Even hardcore non-veg lovers like me have found their vegetarian preparations too good. Their must try dishes include chicken / fish 65, tandoori chicken, mushroom masala, chicken tikka pulao.

All marks for the ambience. I used to visit this place earlier in my childhoods with parents. After so long time visited again with friends. Ambience is okay with the cost. Rest the quality of the food is not upto the expectations. Worst : Lacha parantha. Good : Biriyani.
Will recommend for one time visit while younare driving overnight EM bypass near Ruby and science city.

Ordered mutton biryani for team lunch at office. Was really frustrated with the quality of biryani. Whole team was unsatisfied with the quality of food they sent. 

The food they sent didn't taste like biryani.

Sanjha Chulha needs to work from starting for the quality of biryani. 

However, delivery guy was good one.

It was my second visit to Sanjha Chulha and we tried north Indian this time. We ordered pahari kebabs in starters, masala kulcha, butter naan and dum ka murg in main course and lastly ending it with firni. Well, I tried north Indian cuisine for which this restaurant is famous for, the very first time and I'm quite impressed with the taste of each and every dish and even it's quantity is quite filling. They took just 10 minutes to get the food and it was delicious. Pure authentic north Indian. Yes, the waiters could have been a bit more friendlier. And another thing is the firni which was not up to the mark. Otherwise it was quite a good experience over here and this place is quite cheap as well. Do give a visit. :)

This is one such restaurant that impresses me each time I visit them. The restaurant is situated on the 1st floor. This outlet near VIP Bazaar has been renovated and redecorated recently. Needless to say, their ambience is prettier now. Their new menu card is also so beautiful with illustrations of North India and its people.

We ordered Mila Jhula Pulao, Kandhari Chicken, and firni. The food tasted absolutely outstanding. Though the price is a bit on the higher side, it is worth spending that much. The staffs were nice and were constantly around to help us with anything we needed. This restaurant remains open till late night (till 2 am) and is perfect if you have car/bike with you as they have a large parking space in front of the restaurant.

So...go there and enjoy authentic North Indian food! Cheers to food! Cheers to life!

Pocket pinch: 650 for two (apprx.)

The restaurant is located after VIP Bazaar stoppage on Bypass road. It is easy to locate. The restaurant is located in 1st floor and it is well decorated. An out and out family restaurant and I liked their ambiance though it is a bit noisy.
Now let's discuss food. Food here is lipsmacking though the prices are on the higher side. We have ordered Chicken malai kebab and chickem reshmi kebab as starters. In the main course we had chicken shahi tikka biryani, regular chicken hakka noodles and kung pao chicken. Each and every item tasted really good except we were dissapointed on one issue; that is we were overly charged for chicken malai kebab which came out as a dissapointment otherwise all good. All of the items were superb in taste and the chicken tikka biryani is worth trying as it is a bit different from the normal biryani we usually have and it is full of yummy gravy and worth special mention.

I have always been awed by the jugalbandhi kaabab whenever I have visited Sanjha Chulha on EM Bypass. The last trip was good with the great food, fine ambience and not so warm hospitality. My family had ordered both north Indian and Chinese cuisine including the jugalbandhi kaabab. Since we couldn't finish off the entire food on the table, we requested the extra food to be packed. It was done as requested, but when I opened the foil boxes back home, I noticed to my disappointment that the quantity of food packed were way less than they should have been especially the Chinese fried rice. I say this because I was the only one to have the fried rice at the restaurant and I ended up with only half a box of fried rice which was packed. Such practise should be avoided unintentional or ortherwise as it brings down the reputation of an awesome food joint.

I say this because I was the only one to have the fried rice at the restaurant and I ended up with only half a box of fried rice which was packed. Such practise should be avoided unintentional or ortherwise as it brings down the reputation of an awesome food joint.

Don't visit this place if you are health and hygiene conscious but do if you are in a hurry and want some fast food while being seated at a restaurant. Thankfully the hospital is close by. You would likely find it vacant of customers as well as staff and there happens to be much better tasting fast food in many places of Kolkata

Feb 2017:

Recently, I was appointed the official Food Critic of Tastes of India (ToI), the biggest food carnival in Kolkata, which was held from 25 to 26 February 2017 at Nalban Food Park.

Sanjha Chulha was one of the participants there.

I opted to taste Dal Makhani, Methi Malai Paneer and Butter Naan. 

This comfort Indian vegetarian meal looked quite inviting.

Dal was OK. Paneer dish was super tasty. Naans were soft and fluffy.

This place was never on my list but since we were out of options one night we stopped by for quick dinner. The ambience is ok . The place has two wings left one with sofas and one wing/side with chairs. We were escorted to the sofa side saying that it was better. I dint see much difference except for the crowd. Our side had more families so now you will know why we were escorted to the left wing of the restaurant. Staffs were friendly and courteous.

We ordered for paththar kebab which surprisingly was fabulous . It had a bit of smoky charcoal like flavour. Something new and must try if you are in sanjha chulha. Next we ordered for mutton roganjosh and butter naan. Naan was usual, fluffly soft buttery. The mutton was soft but gravy was just average. For dessert we had the gulab jamun and firni which was good. Overall food was good at reasonable price.

This a one of best place to be if u wanna try dhana style food especially I'm the bypass while on a long drive wth friends n family. The restaurant makes good biriyani and some delicious north indian food. U can try their rumali roti or butter nun with dal makhni, murgi malai methi which is very tasty and even mutton roman josh. The food is served and presented well and a must try.!

It was last year when the Ahare Bangali was going on at Milan Mela. After a very unfortunate and eventful evening spent at the fair ground, we left the place hungry, in search of some food. There, Sanjha Chulha happened. We were literally famished. So without wasting any time, we ordered butter nun, keema pulao and kadhai chicken. Wow! Much to our surprise, they promptly served us the food. The food was really tasty and looking at the rate, it seemed way better than many other restaurants who offer north-Indian cuisine. The ambience was good and cozy for a peaceful dine out. The staffs were friendly as far as I remember. You can say Sanjha Chulha saved us that day. So if you are looking for a new place to enjoy reasonably-priced mughal and north-indian cuisines near the EM Bypass, you should definitely try this place.

This outlet is near our college so we tried it out on a fine evening! We just wanted to try some rolls from here so we ordered for a paneer roll and a chicken roll! The rolls just had fried pieces of paneer and chicken and was the filled with tomato and chilli sauce, some chopped onion and rolled! Thats all! We did not like the preparation since there was no flavour in it, just a paratha rolled in ketchup and fried filling! A bad experience and would not suggest it at all.

Saraswati Puja calls for khichuri and labra and mostly all things veg in Bengali households. But it's only fun when you can have the best of both worlds ! So, after attending the puja at college, we bunch of friends decided to complete the non-veg chapter at Sanjha Chulha. We were pretty late for lunch, and with such an elaborate seating arrangement, it was one of the few places still open to host us. We were a huge group of nearly 17-18 people. However, our common love for Biriyani and Naan kept us together. We decided to go for their Mutton Biriyani, Butter Naan, Butter Chicken, Methi Malai Murgh, Dal Makhani, Butter Paneer and conclude it with Firni and Ice Cream. The surprising bit was the inclusion of the Chinese menu, though it was closed during that time. For the rest of the food, I can safely say that this is one of the places you can crash into if you're looking for good food at cheap prices(provided you have a big gang). The Biriyani is fairly good, though the mutton in somewhat dry, and the rice is less spicy. The Chicken Side dishes were quite good, but I have tasted better vegetarian dishes elsewhere. The Dal Makhani especially was disappointing. The Firni too wasn't up to the mark and the quantity was too little for 75 bucks. But the ice cream kind of made up for it !

One of the iconic joints of Kolkata located of EM Byepass near Science City.. These place serves quintessential North Indian and dhaba style food at an affordable pricing.. Even though a number of restaurants have come up in recent years in the area the strategic location and being the oldest name has helped this place to retain its brand value..
We visited the newly renovated first floor family section which is indeed a classy set-up to enjoy your meal.. Beautifully ornated with an earthy and metallic finish, traditional decor on the walls add to the overall charm.. Service was a bit slow even though we visited during lunch hours when they were mostly empty.. Coming to the food, we tasted:
Kasundi Murgh Tikka: A speciality from their quirky kebab festival.. it was unique in taste and the presence of mustard added a bengali touch with a strong flavor.. the chicken morsels were soft and nicely marinated..
Fish 65: This dish was fiery hot and not meant for the faint-hearted..even i had to help it down with a glass of water..taste was authentic with the typical south indian flavor of curry leaves and if you can manage the spices and heat then none beat this dish..
Jugalbandi Seekh Kebab: Their signature dish.. honestly the highlight of the meal.. mutton keema rolled within chicken fillet and grilled to perfection.. Passionately Recommended..
Keema Pulao: Nice, strong aroma of flavored rice with ample keema making it a delightful affair with the gravy.. the long grained beautifully cooked rice without too much spices added a subtelity to the dish..
Mutton Rahra: Another of their speciality, where mutton keema cooked beautifully with mutton cubes to add a richness to the whole dish.. the assortment of spices makes the gravy extremely delectable..
Butter Chicken: Dhaba style meal can't end without this flagship dish.. slightly on the sweeter side but the chicken was fork-tender and goes well with the Butter Nan..
Chicken Tikka Biryani: Normally you won't see restaurants in Kolkata serving this variety of the staple..as soon as I found it on the menu didn't hesitated to order it.. But since we were so full decided to get it packed.. the spicy marination of the chicken tikka added to the flavor of the rice and was indeed a novel experience from the usual biryani tasting..
Overall, we had a whole hearted meal with not much scope to complain both on the metrics of quality and quantity..definitely a perfect place if you are a large group planning for a not-so-pricey meal.. Our total cheque was approx Rs.2200/- (all incl.) for 3 people abd definitely worth for all the foods we tasted..

Heard a lot about this place... So finally we landed there on 31st night and surprisingly we got a table for five of us in the newly added section.. The ambiance is nice (the newly opened section - Chinese) Yeah it was!! to my surprise a restaurant which sounds like north-indian actually giving you a feeling of ancient chinese...LOL. Jokes apart.. Coming to the menu we started with Soups (Chicken Sweet corn n veg sweet corn) both were okayish.. In starters we opted for kebabs (Chicken pahari kebab n one more but forgot the name) both of them were good... In main course we ordered Lachha paratha, kabuli nun, alu paratha, chicken biriyani, one chicken side dish and paneer tikka makhani) all were fine.. No space for dessert hence we asked for the check and it comes around 2100 which was okay.. Just one more thing to add staff need to be more attentive.. Apart from that a good experience though...:)

Overall a great place for dhaba food with amazing taste. Service is quick and prices are not too high, hope to sit and eat at this restautant next time

If you don't mind the calories, go here right on! :D

We have tested Kandhai Chicken, Mutton Biriyani, Rumali Ruti, Butter Nan, Chicken Masla & Baby Corn Mushroom etc. The service quality is very good. No doubt it should have a five points. But am giving 4.5.
Everyone should taste once.

The food was just average. There is not much options  if you want to dine with vegetarian foods. 
Nothing seemed to be tasty. The kulcha we ordered tasted burnt a little extra.  
Price was average. However one has better options available for the budget.
Most importantly, if you are a vegetarian this is just not the place for you!!

Earlier Sanjha Chulha used to be one of my most favourite places to order food from due to it's authentic Indian flavours and taste in the food. However of late I am noticing a rather disturbing trend where not only the food quality has gone bad, but also the food portion packed and the delivery service. The food which I earlier used to relish with great enjoyment, now I can barely eat it because of it being a very poor reproduction of the original food. Taste of food has become bad and today the delivery took 1.5 hours when normally it takes about 20-30 minutes. When I complained to the person who picked up the phone in Sanjha Chulha, he started to justify the lateness by saying that the delivery boy had been calling for 30 mins. In reality the boy had called just once about 10 minutes ago. Then he revealed that the boy was new and did not know the area. That man argued with me the whole time justifying the cold food and bad delivery service I got. I do not know why I even paid for it. Sanjha Chulha if you are seeing this please improve your food and customer service since both have gone down the drains. If you keep this bad defensive attitude up while serving really poor quality,cold food, you will soon lose out on your customers like you have just lost me ever giving home delivery order to Sanjha Chulha.

Located on the EM Bypass, i would recommend all the food lovers not to visit this outlet during the durga pujas.They move to a set menu concept and the quality and quantity - both were not upto the mark.

Having gone here on my birthday,  my primary concern was the bill. Having some friends who chomp down food like a super car guzzles petrol, I was understandably concerned that I might be in for a ton of credit card debt come the end of the day.  Keeping my worries aside we went in and ordered our starters. Chicken 65, chicken malai kebab and and chicken hariyali tikka was the order of the day. By the time the food arrived we got a chance to look at the interiors which were classy yet not over the top. The starters were nice with the chicken 65 being the pick of the lot.  The waiting time was reasonable. The main courses arrived and though we could fault them,  they weren't knocking our socks off either. The biriyani was nice, the chicken bharta was okay, the chicken butter masala was good while the butter chicken was average. The waiters took some time to cater to our needs but it was fine I guess when you consider that they were few in number on a lunch hour weekday. Finally the bill came and I let out a sigh of relief as it was really quite reasonable.  All in all, a decent affair at a very good price point.  Would return definitely if the need arose.

Had ordered home delivery at 8.30 pm .. food came at 10.30 pm and without full order. The delivery boy took more money saying that he is bringing the remaining item. Never came back. Called several times but no one was answering and then finally at 12 midnight someone picked up to say that the order would reach. That too didn't come .. pathetic service.. even the food was total rubbish..

Convenient location,just beside EM Bypass. Though it's named as dhaba, the feel is of a restaurant. Its known for its north indian delicacies. Not really much ambience in the place though. Good for groups.
Was very excited to try this place as I had heard good things.
They had a decent selection of food and an especially large selection for vegetarians. We ordered Malai Chicken, Crispy baby corn, Crispy chili fish pepper flakes, Tikka Biryani, Mutton rogan josh and Kadai paneer. However the paneer was bland and somewhat lacking in taste. Spicy, but no tasty spices. The Biryani was not great, but it was good enough to consider decent. Noteworthy however I enjoyed their malai chicken, baby corn and that green yogurt based chutney sauce... and all its spicy tangy green goodness. Overall, the food was okay, It's not that it was bad at all, it just didn't taste like anything special. Service is acceptable but no one asked us if it was okay or needed any thing else.
I had hoped to feel like a nice occasion but left feeling a little deflated.
still recommended, always busy and fast service. Sanjha Chulha is a good/moderate restaurant overall.

Sanjha Chula was very good for me as it was the only restaurant without waiting during Durga Pujas. Though I found ou the veg items to be a bit too over priced but the food quality was good as expected.There was something on Murg Masala which was really good. Firni was awesome here better than Arsalan. Good ambiance nice and friendly people. The cooking time was a bit more though. Must Visit... If u are in town :)

Situated on the bypass the place is very easy to locate and it serves some good Indian food.. the servers are well behaved and are friendly.. the quality of food is quite up to the mark .. dal makhani, dahi pulao, kalaunjee kebab, kadhai chicken and kadhai paneer is what we ordered and the taste was pretty good..

Sanjha Chulha is located near the Ruby Hospital and is quite easy to locate. The interiors are quite simple but elegant and comfortable. The big sofas are very cosy. The staff is quite friendly and helpful. I have tried the north indian dishes at this place and they have impressed me a lot. The murgh malai was extremely buttery and tasty ,rich in flavours. The price is also affordable that is the reason why its a eatery which shouldn't be missed. :)

The food is ok. The Service is bad. The ambience is ok. It's like majboori mein Khan ho to chalega as there are no restaurants around so ok it's the only option.The restaurant is very unhygienic and dirty. It's like an oasys in desert. At least veg food is available. Ambience and taste sucks! Also according to the price the food is not good.

It was my brother cum friend's birthday and we ordered food from Sanjha Chulha. Though it was a bit expensive but quality was better than any other restaurant.
We ordered two starters chicken cheese kebab & chicken 65.
We also ordered to kadhai chicken & malai chicken gravy along with butter rotis.

I personally loved the chicken 65. I have never had such spicy authentic south Indian style chicken 65 with a mix of north Indian spices.
Cheese kebabs were extremely soft and tender.
The main course dishes were awesome. Overall it was a wonderful dinner that night!

When I used to live in Pune I had become a fan of the biryani from an eatery. It was spicier than usual and did not have a huge chunk of chicken embedded in the rice. Instead, it had small pieces of spicy chicken to go with the rice. After relocating to Kolkata, this biriyani shaped hole was finally filled up by the chicken tikka biryani of Sanjha Chulha, EM Bypass.

So, I happened to be at this place after a very tiring day at my car's service center in Tiljala. I had ordered their chicken tikka biryani and hariyali kebabs. 

The restaurant was kind of empty (possibly because it was a weekday afternoon). The service was decent (not over the top). But the food; just blew me over. The biryani , the same spicy one with chicken pieces in it made me forget every problem in my life. The succulent, haryali kebabs accentuated the flavours immensely.

Will recommend this just for the food, specially the tikka biryani.

I visited here with my group of clinical posting partners during college days 3yrs back.For starters we had chicken malai kabab which was pretty good.In main course few of us had biriyanis which they said was pretty good.The others in group including me had butter naan with butter chicken and chicken methi malai.Butter chicken was average..I had better in other places.But chicken methi malai was out off the world.It was too good.Later for  desserts we wanted to have rabdi saang gulab jamun.But they said only gulab jamun was available but no rabdi.So we didn't have amy dessert.

This one is very old and probably the best around the place still with dhaba kind of food. Loads of restaurant have came up around the place including arsalan but I still feel this is the best option. You get this authentic dhaba food taste and aroma. After renovation, ambiance is improved a lot. Only issue I faced sometimes is service is sometimes slow. Otherwise they have never failed to dissapoint the taste buds.

if u r searching for a Moghlai-Chinese combo, u can be rest assured with the food served at Sanjha Chulha (Off E.M Byepass branch). Had been my 1st choice whenever I'm around the EM Byepass area during lunch hours. the Tandoor & Kababs are wow even with the Chinese spread.
Surely a too good at taste food joint.

Well to have a full course proper meal of north indian delicacy, when the chips are a bit down you can dine in here. I was a bit ashtonished when i first entered the place. What it looks from outside is completely different from inside. The interiors are good and so is the reception. The food served was delicious and serving them took almost no time.  So if you are thinking of spending not so much on your meal then i would suggest you this place.

Had their chicken roll numerous times and they were tasty. Visited the actual restaurant once and the food was too good. I was suffering from fever and their spicy Kandhari Chicken tasted amazing. However, when we ordered home delivery from their place, it was one of the worst food I had ever tasted. The drastic change of quality was way too disappointing and I never ordered from them again.

Dropped in today for a real late lunch.
The outlet is being renovated so the outside is covered with bamboos and water is leaking profusely. The staircase is filled with flies. The right side entry to sanjha chulha was being cleaned so was asked to step inside Pind on the left side. A very clean and nice atmosphere greets you and you forget everything. Very friendly staff and finger licking good food. The plates given were stinking so on informing them they changed it immediately.
Ordered cheese kulcha which was so soft and fluffy and delicious! The dal is served in a balti with a big dollop of butter on top. Onions,chilies and lemon wedges are complimentary. The butter naan was equally soft and delicious. The chicken was juicy and tender. Loved the food and ambiance. 
Wish the management all the very best.

Sanjha Chulha has been my favourite, always. 
During a recent trip to Kolkata,  I came to this place with my friends for a buffet lunch. 

I did not try all the dishes from the buffet but the ones which I tried were all good. 

Best dishes from the buffet : Honey tossed babycorn,  hara shami kebab,  tandoori chicken, kali mirch chicken,  veg hakka noodle,  peas pulao (could have been better), roti or naan and the gajar ka halwa. 

Not so good dishes : Lemon pepper soup,  chilli potato,  chilli chicken. 

Total 450 with out taxes. Happy tummy!

I had been hearing so much good things about this place since quite long. Finally visited here last week. And I must say, it is a great place to serve your North Indian food cravings. Although very beautifully decored, the restaurant still has that punjabi dhaba style feel  to it. We ordered Mila jhula pulao, kandhari murg and bhuna gosht. The taste, quality, quantity everything was just on point. Though being a huge fan of mutton, I loved the kandhari murg over bhuna gosht this time. The chicken pieces were juicy, tender with just right amount of flavours to them. A bit pricey but totally worth every penny spent. Would recommend the place and looking forward to visit again.

We ordered Chicken Do Piyaza, Naan, Biryani, Noodles and Chilly Chicken.
The quality of Indian dishes were really good while I didn't like the Chinese items as such.
The service was okay.
The ambience is nothing great.
Overall a good place to have quality Indian Cuisine.

This place is situated on e m bypass midway as one goes from ruby to science city. The biggest problem is parking . In the ground is the takeaway counter which i must say is very prompt. On the first floor is the restaurant. The food served is good, and is moderately priced. I prefer their reshmi butter masala and their kababs. But the sweet lime soda is exorbitantly priced.

I have been visiting this place religiously for the last 6 years, on Durga Puja, every time during a night out. We land up around this place, say around 1-ish in the night, to just hog on the kebabs. The place is jam packed, even at those late hours. All that been said, there is little, according to me, that sets sanjha chulha, apart from any other regular North Indian eatery. The kebabs are decent but, do not blow you away. Neither the flavours, nor the texture of the kebabs are something that you will be in awe with. The kebabs need more flavour and definitely need to be softer. Same goes for the biriyani. Nothing extraordinary.

I was waiting for a long time to visit this place, but could not make it as it was not in our route most of the time. 
Finally visited on the day of the earthquake last year. It was heavily raining outside and we went there for some food. This food joint is definitely spacious and provides a variety of food delicacies. So far I rem, they serve really good north indian food. We had a full chicken tandoor. They serve chinese also. We had noodles ( forgot the name) but the ultra spicey 'Devils Chicken' can never be forgotten. It was just awesome for those who love hot and spicy food. 
PS: I long to go to this place very soon.

We ordered Indian food and the food was finger licking delicious.

Not your quintessential dhaba, the restaurant being situated on the 1st floor, but definitely a place to stop your vehicle and have a bite considering its location. Their tandoori chicken and the biriyani are delicious and the quantity is more than adequate. Having frequented this place quite a few times I can vouch for this place over the other restaurants in the same vicinity.

Iocated in bypass between ruby and science city, just after hotel sheldon and beside mustard. Nothing extraordinary, an okay sort of restaurant. The food is good in quality but not enough in quantity. Overly priced in terms of quantity. We ordered murgh kalimirch and butter tandoori roti. Although the dish was spicy but the essential flavour of kalimirch was missing. Delivery was pretty slow even though they had adequate staff members and a few handful customers. The menu hasn't been updated in zomato. It shows a considerable change. All in all, decent but needs a lot of improvement.

The ambience and service over here is very nice. We went for biryani tandoori chicken and some kebab. I will say the food is above average although i feel the cost is  quite high. Their quantity does not do justice to what they charge.
And yeah the lassi at the end was the only really satisfying part.

While our office was in Bantala, and nobody would agree to deliver food, Sanjha Chulha was the only restaurant who would provide us with food!
They had no minimum order value, needless to say the entire team would order and the price would shoot up anyway!
We have always ordered in their Indian cuisine. Apart from ordering in, we have also visited the restaurant on many occasions and tried their food.

This is sometime back & I don't know if they have pulled up their socks in these few months!!! Certain things I am pretty sure would be the same.....its crowded even on a weekday, for good food you need a bit of personal environment, kinda missing here.....now for the good food....apart from the roasted chicken the rest of the order was pretty ordinary and for two people it costed roughly ₹1700/-.... even today I am a bit confused as to whether it was reasonable considering the experience.... the time between order and serving was quite a bit and that too didn't actually hit a home run....was tempted for a 3.5  but think will settle for a 3, a well deserved 3!!!

It is a family restaurant located in em bypass just beside of Ruby Hospital . Location is convenient.  Ambience was ok.We had taken buffet lunch. Service was very cordial.Mostly  over north indian delicacy was served. Food was very good mainly the starters, specially the chicken tandoori kabab and chic lollipop and hot and garlic fish. Though there was not much variety of deserts still the hot gulab jamun with vanilla ice cream was mouthwatering.

Well, visited this place sometimes back for dinner. Theres enough space for parking, and people are there to help. We were shown the upstairs to sit. The interior and the ambiance is average. There was a buffet menu going on, but most of the things in the buffet, we didnt like, so we ordered by the menu. 
We ordered tandoori Roti, Mutton Kosha and Chicken Biriyani
First of all serving time is way too much. The food took almost 25mins to come. The biriyani was horrible. It was too dry and 90% of it was uncooked, cold and rest of the part was full of salt. It was totally uneatable. So we called the waiter and asked for a change. After 10mins it arrived. This time, there was no difference, but it was stired. They just took it, and stired it well and gave us back, but it was still uneatable. Then we again asked, and the process repeated. Now this time it came back with a uncooked potato, and the for the rest difference was, this time it was little hot. But taste was horrible. The mutton kasha was average. 
Prices are fair enough. But service is very poor. The waiter doesnt remain presnt on floor on maximum times. So when you need anything, you have to wait long for the waiter to come, even for water. 
Overall, very average.

Sanjha Chulha is in an area where I hadn’t ever gone for dining. At its place in east Kolkata, on VIP Road, there are a few restaurants near each other. The feedback available to me about this restaurant was that it was a decent place.
I received a gift voucher of Sanjha Chulha from the Zomato meetup I had recently attended. So visiting it was by default. I went to this place with my daughter last month. 
The dining area is on the first floor. The brown-based décor is pleasant with use of wood. It seemed a good ambience for family dining. Along the wall, there are sofas seating three each on the two sides of the tables and there are chairs as well. The wash basin takes a bit of a walk though, to the toilet, out of the dining area. 
The menu is pricy. All the non-veg starters or main course dishes are noticeably expensive than other restaurants falling between fine dining and economy segments. Curiously, in Chinese cuisine, all the side dishes have a fixed price depending on whether it is a vegetarian, chicken, prawn or fish dish. Chilli Chicken cost Rs 190 with a serving of 6-7 pieces, as the waiter said. That’s much expensive compared to other restaurants from the same category. 
I ordered mutton biryani (Rs 150) and mixed fried rice (Rs 150). Both were decent in terms of taste. The mutton in the biryani was succulent and the potato well-cooked. 
It’s a place where one can go to only if it is convenient than other options and you don’t mind paying a bit more.

I have been a regular to this restaurant since it was in the ground floor of its present location. It always stood for value for money. Great food at affordable price. But off late the quality has gone down. The food has become unnecessarily hot, oily and spice. Morever the chicken and mutton pieces in the curry are not at all tender which is a big let down. Expect they will take note and change.

I am quite a regular visitor of this restaurant located on EM bypass between Ruby and Science City. The place serves excellent kebabs and Indian cuisine. They have added Chinese dishes to their menu which I am yet to try. I strongly recommend their jugalbandi seekh kebab which I have not found in any other eatery in Kolkata. Fish ajwain tikka has also been an winner each time we tried. Good ambience and courteous staff are added bonus. Good food at acceptable price -- I will definitely go back.

This restaurant is located on em byepass, between science city and kasba. This place used to be a regular spot for dinner since it stays open till late and cos of their sufficient parking space. My friends and myself used to visit the pind , which is on the first floor. The food there is decent, service good enough and ambience nice. 
We used to try the tandooris, which were very nice.
Pros:
1. Prominent location
2. Decent taste
3. Large parking space
4. Nice ambience (in the pind)
Cons:
1. taste is not consistent. At times u get bad food too.

Our palette were delighted by the following:
Butter chicken with Tandoori roti
Masala kulcha
Fried rice with sweet and sour prawn
Food quality is totally commendable. Delivery was quick. Only downside is their phone reception, who was rude at some point when we were asking about same menu twice over phone. How a person is supposed to remember all the menus at one go.
Apart from that, have your wrist-dipping lunch/dinner :)

One of the very first Sanjha Chulhas in this area. Located right after Science City, while going towards Ruby Hospital, this place has almost turned into an institution or a landmark down these years. First time when I had visited year was sometime during 2005-2006. Food quality has gone downhill as time progressed but this is still worth a visit. Had tried Biryani, Nun, Kebabs, Roti and some Chicken Side Dish; all of which were satisfactory.

Food-
Chicken 65- decent but too spicy for my taste.
Kandhari murgh- yum, well made.
Jeera rice- the rice was overdone so it spoiled the taste.
Would go back soon someday if I'm in that area.

Biriyani and tandoori are worth its price.  Several chicken items are good as well.  I visited there as well as ordered biriyanis for home delivery for hundreds of times. Yes i mean it.  Hundreds of times.  And it is really good.  
But when it comes to buffet experience,  it could be a lot lot better.  Because,  the competition is really tough.  And it will need to go a long way to catch up with others in this race.

we went for a late night dinner. It was past 11 and sanjha chulha was still open, so we headed to it. the restro was full of people at that time.decor is simple and clean.
we ordered masala chaas.. kabab platter.. rumali rootis ..keema matar and chicken kandhari.

kabab platter: they served us 12 pieces of fish chicken mutton varity kabab. pieces were small sized and taste wise nothing special.They charged 650 for it.. not worth.

masala chass: salty cool refeshing light drink. love it.
keema matar: this is a okay type preparetion. either bad nor vry good.

chicken kandhari: this one was nice. bite sized boneless soft chicken in a gravy. gravy tasted good.

If you went for a late night dinner plan then go to this place. otherwise you will get lot more other options within this price.

This place is a pretty old restaurant. I have been here many times. The ambience as you can see in the pics is well maintained joint. 

We had Murgh dum Biryani and Kandhari Chicken. The Biryani was nicely made with a big piece of Chicken and a piece of potato with it. The Kandhari Chicken was recommended to us by the waiter as he said it was quite popular. The Kandhari Chicken had 6pieces of boneless chicken and it tastes very good. 
The service was very efficient by the waiter's and they did not keep us waiting at all. 

Overall this place has kept up with its reputation... Am definitely going back to the restaurant once again....

Visited the restaurant after a long time...found the place completely changed...the addition of Chinese dishes in the menu means they are wanting to attract more and more customers....we ordered Mutton Biryani and Chicken Malai and Chicken Tikka kebabs...both the kebabs were well done....yet not overcooked...soft,moist and full of flavours...the biryani was filling and neither dry nor oily...which is really a delight to find.
Yesterday we visited the place in the evening to grab a light dinner and use the coupon that zomato sent for a discount of RS. 500 for the same. After a bit of confirmation from the owner whose no zomato had provided in the coupon, we ordered 3 simple dishes.... The first one was mahi tikka amritsari, ie fish lightly grilled in medium spice....the fish was fresh and the taste was satisfying, but the fish could have spent a minute more in the grill...although drying the fish would have been a shame, may be the cook was trying to avoid. Coming to the main, the dal makhni and garlic bread. I've tasted better dal makhni in smaller cities and smaller restaurants though...and am yet to find a dal makhni to my content in Kolkata. The garlic naans were spot on. Would be back to try their buffet dish :-)

The rural Punjabi teracotta style artwork in metal is beautiful alongside the kinda dark setting which goes with the delicious handmade dishes from the small villages of Punjab. The biriyani is a real 'lazzez' !! Also the kebabs and chicken tikka butter butter masala are a a rage. The window seats are kinda romantic and the service is very good!

While searching for buffets in town for a birthday party, I found about Sanjha Chulha and decided to have a lunch there... Sanjha Chulha is located at Uttar Panchanongram near Rubi-Desan more... The ambience was quite nice and quiet and the place is nicely decorated with Chinese paintings,lanterns etc...
It has both buffet and ala carté...
We took the buffet...
Now coming to the food

At first they gave
Cold Drinks (It will be refilled whenever you need)
Then, Sweet Corn Non veg Soup

In Starters, there were
Drums of Heaven (Chicken Drumsticts/lollipop)
Chicken 65
Crispy Fish Chilly Flakes & Pepper
Mutton Seekh Kebab
Crispy Chilly Baby Corn
Hariyali Paneer Tikka
Subz Galwati Kebab
Papad
Salad

In Main course, There were
Veg Hakka Noodle
Jeera Rice
Roti/Naan
Hot Garlic Chicken
Chicken Bharta
Bhuna Mutton
Chilly Fish
Paneer Kalimirch
Masala Aloo
Veg Manchurian
Dhaba Dal
Sweet & Sour Vegetable

In Dessert,
Gulab Zamun
Ice cream were there...

All the Starters were very scrumptious... Specially Fish chilly flakes, Drumstick and paneer tikka were really awesome in taste...Main course was normal though... Noodle, Bhuna mutton & Hot garlic chicken were good...
Hot Gulab Zamuns and Icecream were lip smacking...
Coming to service, every food was served hot and fresh... But serving process was a little bit slow...
Overall in just 540 bucks the buffet is worth a shot in a restaurant that gives a feeling of Punjabi dhaba with some Chinese decor...

Had the buffet. Starters was good but main course was awful. But the ambiance was good and the staffs were also good. You can give a try but that was last for me.

Starting with the good point which is the ambience and decor of the place. 
Dal was not that kind which you expect in a dhaba setup. Similar problem was with the service. After the first round, we reordered rotis, which was served after 15 mins.

Went there today. Had the buffet. Good at this price level. They served normal cold drinks as a welcome drink and refilled every time we said. Went there with bunch of college friends.
Now the main part: Food. Starters were good enough. Nice items. Main courses were ok. Not so much dishes. Mutton was good. Tandoori roti with chicken was better. Noodles were ok.
But they disappointed us with the number of desserts. There were only 2 desserts. The first one was Gajar ka Halwa. Taste was just awesome. Then the vanilla ice cream but no choco sauce with it. So not satisfied much with the desserts. Overall good experience and pocket friendly buffet. Enjoyed a lot with friends.
P.S- I want to give a higher point but can't, because zomato couldn't allow me to give point between 3.5-4.0.

Its on the bypass highway. When we were returning from metro cash and carry we went there with lots of hunger. They served really good food with very affordable price. 
Their ambience also very good. We ordered chinese items as well. Chinese and north indian both are equally good. Enjoyed a lot. :-)
Wish to visit again.

Located just on the Eastern Metropolis Bypass near the Ruby Hospital more, this is a real gem in terms of Indian dhaba food. We tried Chicken 65, hunan chicken and butter nun. The quantity was enough for 2 people. The spicy chicken 65 tastes good, but the hunan chicken was indeed delicious. Certainly, one of the best Indian dishes I have had so far. The ambience is quite nice and the staff is friendly. Overall, 4.0/5.0.

This place is very near to my place and I visited it last month to celebrate my parents' anniversary. The restaurant has a facility of both buffet and a-la-carte and we opted for the 1st one. We had ordered Manchow soup which was absolutely delicious and very filling. After that, we decided to shift to Northern dish and tried the Hariyali Kabab which was equally amazing. We ordered Chicken Tikka Biriyani, Garlic Naan and Chicken Bharta. Let's just say, when the food arrived, we hardly talked! Every dish was perfectly cooked and the taste was divine. We ended our meal with a dessert, Brownie with ice-cream and that was superb! The rates are pretty affordable and I am hoping to come again to this restaurant to try out the Chicken Tandoori. Cheerio!

Going in for a lunch here, we were surprised to find out sanjha chulha providing buffet at a minimal pocket pinch of Rs.450. Straight away we decided to give it a try. Yes, certainly its not the best but also not the worst keeping in mind the affordable buffet rate.

This is a pretty decent restaurant located between Science City & 
Ruby hospital.Went there around a year ago with a friend for lunch.We ordered-shahi 
pulao(pulao with veggies,fruits & paneer) which was ok,aloo matar 
tariwala(potatoes,peas & tomato in a thick gravy) which was 
good,& chicken hariyali kabab(6 small pieces of chicken cooked with 
coriander) which was great but would have been better if it was less 
salty.Service was ok..ambience was nothing great..prices were a bit on 
the higher side.We got a different menu with much higher prices & 
fewer options than what was provided here.

We went to kolkata book fair today....we all know about the food at book fair which is so bad....I had very bad experiences with eating at book fair....
  So as a foodie this was my chance to try a bypass side eatery... The closest of this place is sigree oh Calcutta and mainland China....but for to day we choose sanjha chula... To give it a try...
  Parking is so easy...
  Now coming to decor yeah well decorated restaurant,ambience - when we entered it was nearly nill.....
  They gave us buffet menu, Chinese menu and Indian menu...after seeing each and every menu we decided Indian a LA carte.....
  We order butter nun ,chicken kadai,green salad and mutton biriyani....
       They gave us complementary pickels and onions like roadside dhabas...
    Nan was extremely well..kadai chicken was good... Biriani was also good.... The waiters are very much well behaved and help full.... After all this the bill came 677 inr....it was a good experience...

We planned for buffet but they said it was already 3pm and the buffet time was over!

We ordered Fish Tikka, Chicken Tikka Kabab, Chicken Malai Butter Masala, Chicken and Mutton Biriyanis and Raita! I must say the food (starters+maincourse) was excellent!
Had a good experience!
Will be visiting again  :-)

Located just on the EM bypass, after crossing Science city island towards Ruby hospital, this place is mostly known for its exquisite north indian preparations. Off-late they have started buffet service as well. The most mention worthy point of this place is their Home delivery service. Be it Unitech or Be it Brahmhapur, they never refuses the customer. Special mention required for their Special Biriyani and Kadai Chicken. Staffs are very cordial, Interior is fair enough, ample of parking space avaialble. Must try for Biriyani and North indian food lovers!!

My review might differ from the rest but I honestly did not like the food. This is one of those boring Indian restaurants where no matter what you order( be it kadai paneer or mixed veg) the gravy is awefully the same. Too much oil floating in every dish. Maybe the restaurant provides a better treat to non- vegetarians.

If you are passing by Ruby hospital and want a quick munch...try out the rolls here.
I am a lover of rolls and that has given me a certain authority to say that when it comes to wraps and rolls, this place is one of the best.
The mughlai items are also quite tasty,however with so many competitors in the same area,they can try a little harder when it comes to this department.
The ambience is okay and if you consider the fact that it is frequented mainly by college students, the reasonable prices do help.

We ordered masala Kulcha, naan, chicken kandhari and kadhai vegetables. Kulcha was perfectly stuffed, loved it ! The flavours in the chicken prep were perfectly balanced again. The vegetables had a smokey flavour. Over all it was a good experience . looking forward to ordering again .

Happy eating :)

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION : This franchise has couple of outlets all over the city of joy. A reputed food station for many people across the city. We went to this Outlet on the Saptami Night. This place is at EM Bypass near Ruby Hospital. On the road side very easy to locate from the road. This is more a dhaba type on the way. This was my first visit to this joint.

AMBIANCE AND STAFF: This is a very nice place to be in with your friends and family. The ambience is very attractive, It is on the first floor with both ways seating Arrangement with full AC. Walls are been covered with designed , wallpapers, Dim lights over the table AND CEILING were made with a classy designed way. More than 12 tables up for grabs in the floor in which i dined in. The atmosphere was nice and crowded as it was puja time. Staffs here was very friendly and very attentive. They were quick to receive us on the gate and escorted us to the table. As the table was for us they provided us the Centre round table for out 10 people group. The Staffs were very sound and took the order very quickly and cooperative. The service was also very quick on the other hand that was a plus.

FOOD: Finally coming to the food. So we decided to have complete Indian here. So we went for regular 
1. Tandoori Chicken as well as newly introduced to me the Angara Tandoori chicken. The regular T.C was just a fab to have here. The smell was awesome and taste was fantastic. A.T.C was also on the fab side, it was tasty chilly and was marinated like that. a little bit of masala was seen over the chicken and was tasting really well. (TANDOORI CHICKEN IS A MUST TRY). 9/10

2.Baby corn was also ordered for the taste for the veggies with us and it was so well made and fried. The corns were soft and completely wrapped with the chilly masala. 8/10

In the Main Course:
3. We had Paneer Tikka Butter masala for the Veg which was very good. The gravy was thick and taste was very buttery and sweet. 8/10

4. In the non veg main course we had Chicken tikka butter masala which was also tasty but i found it on somewhere ordinary and it was just like the paneer tikka butter masla. 7/10

5. Chicken Kadai was really a pathetic item i had here. The taste was Bizarre and chicken was also not tasting that we.. ( Not recommended) 5/10

6. Chicken Bharta was also good but i found it was also just as tasting the butter masala flavour. I think all the gravy was the same. 7/10

7. Tandoori was good and big in size, some parts were burnt but it is ignorable. 8/10

8. Masala kulcha was good and was tasting nice with the chicken bharta. 8/10

9. Mix Pulao was the most Money waste item i had here. The Rice contained no taste. The salt was absent as well the chicken prawn were felt like dead in the dish. NO TASTE AT ALL. Instead of eating it with the gravy i found the Mix pulao to be the worst choice in the entire order. (Seriously Not Recommended). 2/10

QNQ AND PRICES: Quality of the food was good, it had a decent look on the plates. Quantity was average on the other hand. Dont know whether it is like that or it was due to the puja. Prices are a bit high somewhere, Thou 650 for two but i think it should be cut a bit less in the prices.

CONCLUSION: After drove for 45mins and reaching this place was very enjoyful until and UNLESS i had the experience of the food here. My review is all on the experience on the puja day. Will reach this place again for a second take. 

NOTE : The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

2.Baby corn was also ordered for the taste for the veggies with us and it was so well made and fried. The corns were soft and completely wrapped with the chilly masala. 8/10

In the Main Course:
3. We had Paneer Tikka Butter masala for the Veg which was very good. The gravy was thick and taste was very buttery and sweet. 8/10

4. In the non veg main course we had Chicken tikka butter masala which was also tasty but i found it on somewhere ordinary and it was just like the paneer tikka butter masla. 7/10

5. Chicken Kadai was really a pathetic item i had here. The taste was Bizarre and chicken was also not tasting that we.. ( Not recommended) 5/10

6. Chicken Bharta was also good but i found it was also just as tasting the butter masala flavour. I think all the gravy was the same. 7/10

7. Tandoori was good and big in size, some parts were burnt but it is ignorable. 8/10

8. Masala kulcha was good and was tasting nice with the chicken bharta. 8/10

9. Mix Pulao was the most Money waste item i had here. The Rice contained no taste. The salt was absent as well the chicken prawn were felt like dead in the dish. NO TASTE AT ALL. Instead of eating it with the gravy i found the Mix pulao to be the worst choice in the entire order. (Seriously Not Recommended). 2/10

QNQ AND PRICES: Quality of the food was good, it had a decent look on the plates. Quantity was average on the other hand. Dont know whether it is like that or it was due to the puja. Prices are a bit high somewhere, Thou 650 for two but i think it should be cut a bit less in the prices.

CONCLUSION: After drove for 45mins and reaching this place was very enjoyful until and UNLESS i had the experience of the food here. My review is all on the experience on the puja day. Will reach this place again for a second take. 

NOTE : The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

The kebabs are brilliant over here. Though i didnt liked the tikka butter masala the first time i visited it. It did disappointed me. But they changed it later on that was a good service i must say. All over it was a good experience though.

Had different experience the two times I visited this place!

The first visit was worth a 4.0. 
This was before the renovation.
The kababs were brilliant . So were the naan and the chicken and mushroom dishes.

However, my 2nd time round (after the renovation) was a disaster. Definitely a 1.0 !!

The naans were too hard to ever tear. The chicken was stale. The paneer was bad.

I hope they have got better!

We ordered food from this place for our office lunch party.We had ordered previously also but saw improvement in their service this time with on time delivery and professional attitude.
Coming directly to the food part as I have not experienced the ambiance, we have ordered the following
1.Chicken Tandoori - It is the masala version of the original chicken tandoori. But it was very tasty .
2.Butter Nun - the usual stuff with the usual softness
3.Rumali Roti - they were soft and thin.
4.Masala Kulcha - delicious with nice stuffing.
5. Mutton keema - This is our constant favourite. The keemas are well cooked with spices and tastes good though the oil is on the higher part.
6.keema pulao - what a disaster!! Stale rice with minimum amount of keema. The keema was also stale and as hard as rubber.
7.Bhuna Mutton - disaster repeats itself. A dish cooked with unnecessary spices and extra oil but with awful taste.
8.Firni - this was good but could have been better
9.Gulab Jamun with Rabri - this was a winner. Both the gulab jamuns and the rabri was delicious. The gulab jamun was soft, delicious and lightly aromated. The rabri was little less in quantity.
Apart from keema pulao and bhuna mutton, the other items were good.

This review is based on my third visit to this joint. We found that the ambience has greatly improved compared to our last visit. Its not a very big place but beautifully decorated.

We had ordered for Fish Tikka, Mushroom 65, Angara Chicken for starters and Chicken Malai Butter Masala, Mutton Bhuna, Mutton Keema, Chicken Bharta, Naans and Kulchas. The starters were fabulous but main course seemed to fulfill 80% of what we experienced last time. It wasn't bad in any way but we had expected better from this place. The mushroom was beautifully prepared and nicely savoured by all among us. The angara chicken was extremely juicy with all the spices infused into it. The fish was no different either, very fresh and mellow. We experienced some extra saltiness in the mutton which was a turn off but malai butter masala acted like a taste breaker here. It is always recommended to have a mix of red sauce and white sauce gravies in your order in any Indian cuisine restaurant.

Hoping for somewhat better food the next time.

Let me first say some of the bad things about this place..the waiters here are not all skillfully trained..they don't know how to tackle a large group, how to suggest menu and how to gather order..the worst thing, most of them don't even know how the item is cooked..one more noticable bad thing is the time to deliver the ordered time..it is more tham too long..also the quantity  of food is also not satisfactory as per the price..

Good things so far is the item cooked by them..quite good and tasty..must try kandhari chicken and mila jhula pulao..also fish 65..great food for price..

The ambience is not so great but can be considered as a family restaurant..

Once in a while visit can be nice here.

If it's got to be Indian and also from a dhaba and you want good car service, it has to be this place. Have been here lot many times, sat in both the restaurants and tried car service too, the guys down giving car service are better. Restaurants are too loud but the food is up to the mark. You can't return disappointed. Their breads are just too good. Very prompt service. 

What I found most astonishing in this place is that they apply some kind of tax on Mineral water which makes it double the cost on the menu. Believe me, never checked but no other place puts 100% tax on the cost of mineral water. Nevertheless you can always call for beverages to evade that. 

I ate up half a rating for its locational inconvenience. And the other half for the fact that I choose to eat in the car here than up in the restaurant.

We, at our work place in Rajarhat tend to order lunch from outside quite a lot, and based on our experiences we have settled down for this place, although there are far many restaurants in our area including some big brands. There are several reasons for it.  

1) Food - They have quite the variety when it comes to Punjabi food. I love their kebabs. The tandoori murg is outstanding, and their naan are.. oh so soft! Yesterday we ordered baby corn 65, corn seekh, mushroom masala, peas pulao, tandoori roti, butter naan, tandoori chicken butter masala and mutton rhara.  I must say their vegetarian offering is disastrously limited, and not very good. A restaurant needs to be holistic in coverage. That's where they lose 1 point. The corn seekh tasted like mashed potatoes and the baby corn seemed a little old. The worst part was the curry leaves in this dish. It's a Punjabi restaurant selling a Chinese dish. What's a curry leaf doing there??? Anyways, the non veg dishes saved the day. The tandoori chicken pieces in the butter masala was so soft and well done. The gravy too was amazing. Then came mutton rhara. I don't eat mutton so much but boy was I pleasantly surprised. Faadu gravy, and tender pieces. Clean bowled!! One more item of special mention is their use of atta instead of maida for the tandoori roti. Keeps it soft and edible even after 2hrs.

2) Taste - Sanjha Chulha scores brownie points here. Unlike other restaurants, all their dishes taste different, which is a big relief. And they all are very good to eat too. There is a nice balance of spices and oil and one doesn't feel sick after eating, which is yet another great relief. Although, I would still recommend reducing on the amount of oil for health reasons. They lose 0.5 here.
 
3) Delivery - Their delivery is prompt although the restaurant is situated about 18km away from our office. The food arrives hot. Perhaps the hotness of the food could be attributed to the Kolkata summer heat.

4) Experience - I'm one who believes in eating with all the 5 senses. I don't want to hear the roti crunch, I don't like my gravy too slippery, the aroma must transport me to cloud nine, the taste must transport me to the heavens and the presentation must make me want to order next time. Sanjha Chulha cuts a good deal across the table.

I remember visiting this place with my parents many a times, specially for the cuisine they serve (Indian, Punjabi)..my dad's favorite. The food they prepare, they are really mouthwatering and yum. Specially the kebabs, and my all time favorite chicken butter masala and the chicken bharta. I have tried diiferent dishes out here, because of the multiple visits I made. Now-a-days they have started serving Chinese too, which too I have tasted and found quite satisfying. 
The reason I like re-visiting this place, is due to the interior decoration, and the courteous staff. I feel so warmth in their greetings, and the ambiance is simply lovely. One side of the place is designed as per Indian cuisine they serve, while the other part as Chinese. Both the wings are well decorated (though anyone will not expect it to be from outside). 
My profile pic was shot here only. Cheers Sanjha Chulha !

My second visit after 12 years and ut just got hell better ! Back in '03, with only one room and a jolly spirit, I remember the Chhole Bhatures being the best I had ever had at this dhaba. Yet again, with a renewed infrastructure and a first floor restaurant, it is still one of the best dhabas I've been to. The most surprising factor was the little time taken to prepare our order. Liked the ambience and the hospitality. The food is delicious and the price well within comfort range. Always worth more visits. Do visit to have a great family time !

The atmosphere inside is one of peace and tranquillity.
When i wanted to order a soup from the Indian section of the menu, they said that it was not available and that they had stopped making it. May be due to the fact that the person who made i t in the first place quit and that only the chinese soups were available as there are packed soups available for those.
The food is not too much of any style and it is a bit confusing at that. The service is at times crawling.

It was a sweaty summer afternoon and me and my friend were roaming through E.M Bypass approaching Ruby after some tiring work. It was then when we decided to have our lunch at Sanjha Chulha. Now I had a feedback of their food being very oily and not good for health, but still decided to give it a try since I had never been to the place.

Entering the restaurant was a big relief as the air conditioner was working at full force and the place was nearly empty. There was no one at the door so we entered and sat on a nearby table near the window. The place was cool and the ambiance was very nice. Table was a bit small but comfortable enough. The decor was moderate and lighting was dim.

Food we ordered was Chicken Pahadi Kebab, Murg Biryani, Butter Chicken, Boondi Raita and Firni. Chicken Pahadi Kebab was supposed to be spicy as said by the waiter, but it was not spicy at all. Anyways it tasted really nice and was very soft. Murg Biryani was too good and not at all oily, neither it had overpowering flavours. The piece of chicken was quite big and quantity was stomach filling. We enjoyed it with Boondi Raita. Butter Chicken was boneless and chicken pieces were again very tender and the gravy was as it should be. At last, the Firni which also deserves an appraisal. The earthware container in which Firni was served was bigger than commonly seen and hence could hold more Firni.

Pricing was very nominal. I thought we would be greeted with a bill above ₹1500 considering the items we ordered. However the bill just came around ₹1100 including all taxes. Quantity was more than sufficient, all the items had a good quantity. Service was fast, waiting time was around 15-20 minutes before the food was served. Waiters were efficient and helped us choose our menu. They also do home delivery to with a good coverage of areas, so would order in the near future.

Finally, a great place to have some tasty biryani and other North Indian delicacies. A good dine-in place with calm and quite ambiance. Location is also advantageous as two-three more restaurants are located close-by.

I went here with my friends and family in the durgapuja time. My experience was nice but nothing extraordinary about it. Foods were nice. We ordered biriyani, Butter nan, paneer butter masala, kadai chicken, mix veg and veg pulao. Foods were just OK tastewise. But again lot of Dalda used, and I am particular about the qualityof ingredients used in making the food. Dining space and ambience was average.

North Indian at its best is what you get at this small place by the main road near the Ruby Hospital area. The commendable dishes are chicken hariyali tikka, tandoori chicken (cooked to perfection), mutton biryani, kadhai mutton. Their garlic naans are one of the best in town. This place definitely calls for more visits.

Food- 4/5(Moderately good considering their price structure and ambience)
Service- 3/5(slow service for most of the items)
Location: 2/5(Mid way between Science city and ruby)

Please note: Try their Pahari kebab and chicken malai tikka along with sweet lime soda....its a must! 
In the evening time, getting a table is also a bit difficult....but one should visit the joint!

Neither the location nor the ease of reach will make you go for this place. But give the food a shot and get surprised. The taste, the quantity are quite on the mark. Quality and consistency - need a few more orders or visits to judge on that. But thus place is definitely worth a try.

Was treated here by one of my good friends. We went there in a big group of about 20 people. The ambience was decent. We had mutton biriyani, masala kulcha, kababs and some chicken side dishes. The food was quite good. The kulcha was brilliant. Perhaps a bit on the costlier side. But had a good experience nonetheless.

This is an old restaurant on the em bypass which serve brilliant tandoori chicken and biryani. Well the chicken pieces have reduced in size from what they used to serve earlier. But the taste still remains the same. You will actually find it very crowded on weekends. i love the seat next to the window. they have also opened a family section on the left of the staircase to take care of the footfall. i have always been a bif fan of the tandoori here.

The location of this dhaba is a little off beat, especially for women, but my sister and I, we were coming back from salt lake and our car broke down in front of this place - how convenient! Since we were starving and it was getting quite hot inside the car, we went inside, I remember visiting sanjha chulha sometime in 2002! My friend was a huge fan of this place and their food. So I went in practically after 13 years! 
There's no decor as such, very moderate and humble looking furniture and honestly the crowd is a little funny. Stares at you more than their own food. 
The waiter came promptly and handed us the menu, obviously the menu is full of delicious North Indian delicacies ! We quickly ordered two drinks : Lassi & Jal Jeera ( quite nice and refreshing ) the lassi was very nice and creamy! For the main course paneer tikka butter masala, dal makhani, Kadhai Chicken with butter nun was ordered. They served everything within two minutes of arrival, they are that fast! 
The taste is just like that of any other average dhaba in town, nothing to brag about, reasonably priced, staff is quite efficient, the only problem this place has is its location. It would be great if they could make their restaurant a bit more family friendly and in a better location.

Located on E.M bypass this outlet is very visible and easy to reach. The ambience is nice and staff are very friendly and professional. Most importantly the food was very tasty especially the non- veg orders. However during crunch hours when the occupancy is almost 80% , they take quite some time to deliver the orders. This is one area of improvement.
All in all it was a wonderful experience. Separate counter for take-away also available.

The staff was good and also delivery was as per expectation.

Firstly i was overjoyed when I received a Rs500 Voucher from Zomato for this renowned restaurant.  Thank you, Zomato for this kind gesture. 
Now for the food. I ordered Chicken Malai Kabab, Butter Chicken and Roti. The kababs were small in size, but tasty. One plate had six pieces. The portion of butter chicken was good, unlike the kabab. But it didn't taste great. I was kinda disappointed. I'm giving a 0.5 extra just becoz zomato delighted me with the voucher.

We ordered Methi Malai Paneer Veg Seekh Kabab Mutton Bhuna and Lachcha Paratha for Home Delivery at dinner time few days back from their outlet near Ruby Hospital. Delivery was in 45 minutes.
Vegetarian items we ordered were tasty and were enough for three portions. Mutton Bhuna was in semi dry gravy and excellent. Except that Lachcha Paratha was not hot at delivery point, it was on the whole a satisfying meal for three of us.
Next morning they rang up to get a feedback from us. This feature is to be appreciated.
Gross rating I can give is 3.8 but the point system above allows either 3.5 or 4. So I placed it at 4.

We visited this place on a weekday from office and after we found Pride of Punjab closed, and I have to say it was a boon in disguise. Had a pretty great time here. The chicken tandoori was great, so was the chicken malai butter masala. The mutton biryani was pretty good too along with the Mutton Rogan josh. The only letdown came with the Keema Rice.
The staff was good but a bit on the slower side. 
The ambiance is same as that you'll find in most Punjabi dhabas, i.e. noisy..!!
Having said all this, the best part was yet to come. They offered us a cool 15% corporate discount on the bill.

I have been here once and used to take delivery to Sector V frequently during few months in 2010.
There are certain things I like about this place -
1. They are not a multi-cuisine jukebox with lots of contradictory music struggling to survive with its own tune. Only North Indian. Simple.
2. Even being a restaurant and express counter in all respect, they are extremely successful to maintain the true spirit of a "Dhaba"; in their food and in their location.

Food is very simple, spicy and very tasty just as it should be in a dhaba. Quality is not very health friendly to be critical but it is never anything that would result in stomach upset and again that is how it should be of we think of a true dhaba! Quantity is good and same is the service. Delivery is also as per expected timing.
I loved the experience. One of the true dhabas in the city.

Just Superb!! Has always been.
The only place for Tanduri chicken for me in Calcutta.
Nicely done not  like a roadside Dhaba except for the dusty entrance to the place.
Food served piping hot .Quality and Quantity fabulous.Service courteous.

1. Regular tanduri ~ delicious and tender.
2.Kesari  tanduri ~ amazing flavor and tender too. well marinated.
3. Garlic naan ~  the BEST  I have  had in the city. My sister who went with me asked me why I had ordered 4?? I did not ! it was 2 split up which they were huge and very garlicy. Too bad cant bring it home its gets kinda hard very quickly, needs to be eaten warm.
4. Mutton Keema ~ very flavorful w/ peas
5. Jugal bandhi kabab ~ moist made w/ mutton and chicken.excellent.

The waiter more told us more than once. zada ho jaiga madam!! ha ha ha...He did not realize I knew that and I ordered  more as I  was going to bring the leftovers home.

We have been ordering food from this outlet since a long time but the dine-in experience is much much better .I visited this place after years and I must say it was a good experience.
The place is pretty low maintenance.There is nice artwork adorning the walls,depicting the rural scenes of punjab.
I just have a problem with the seating,the sofa is too flat and low in relation to the table so its slightly uncomfortable.
Coming to the food , we ordered the Chicken Tandoori Angara,Fish Tikka,and daal makhani with roti,paratha and naan.

The Chicken Angara was a very unique type of Tandoori Chicken.It had light and subtle flavours.Chicken was also very juicy and well done.

The fish tikka was slightly spicy.It melted in the mouth and I loved the taste.

The daal just stole the show.The tadka was something different.The daal had strong flavours which hit the tongue.Amazing !

The only disappointing part was the naan.It was very fat and wasnt cooked properly.

In the desserts,we had Gulab Jamun.It was fresh,soft and yummy !

So overall I had a very nice experience.I have no idea why I do not get such food in the home delivery.But I hope they take care of that part now.Hope to visit again soon and try some other kebabs from their extensive menu !

Situated aside the busy EM bypass road, this restaurant is rendering a trailer of what's inside as you glare at your destination. An apron-clad cook standing behind a glass wall can be seen 'tandoor'ifying several chicken legs, breasts and kebabs. 

Dont get all puffed up yet, as the insider story might just underscore your expectations.
I was there with my roomies hoping to have some North Indian cuisine as our maid decided to take a day-off without prior notice. So the ambiance is amazing, people who come there are amazing, place is dimly lit, a good mix of families and friends you must find on a regular night. Quite a classy place I must say for a restaurant that says 'Rs. 600 for two people' on Zomato.

When it comes to food, I must say, anything coming out of their 'tandoor' is pure gold. That apron-clad cook knows what he's doing. (ok, he may not be the actual cook, but whatever) But then as you come across the main course things get a little gloomy and very average, their 'very spicy' items are not so spicy, the service is a bit slower than expected. Overall a worse-than-some yet better-than-most performance here.
I sincerely feel a little harsh while rating their main course, but damnit I had such high expectations after that mouth-watering tandoor dishes at the start!!!!

I would recommend a stop that this place for the Tandoor dishes, cz they are just awesome!!
Happy dining!

Yesterday Went on a Dinner Date with my boyfrnd. Location is convenient, though the place is a bit messy due to the Metro project. Ambiance is good. Other than this everything is not upto that mark. Service is very poor. We had to wait 40 minutes to have the Shahi Kabab. Then we took Chicken Bharta, cheese kulcha and butter nun in main course.. And I really didnt like the food quality.  Even the Firni wasnt that good.

Totally Disappointed.

Visited Sanjha Chulha after ages. Last time I guess within few days it was opened. The front of the restaurant is a mess now due to metro work hence parking is a pain. They opened a new section called "Pind" at first floor for family or working crowd. Glass enclosure saves you from dust due to construction work outside.

For the gang we ordered Paneer Sashlik, Murgh Pahari Kebab and Murgh Malai Kebab. Paneer Sashlik was decent however taste for both chicken kebabs was similar to my surprise. Prefer Murgh Pahari Kebab though between the both.

In main course we ordered Methi Malai Murgh, Murgh Butter Masala, Kadhai Chicken, Paneer Makhaanwala and Kandahari Chicken. Kandahari Chicken was just pieces of boiled chicken dipped in spicy gravy. Rest of the dishes I found as it should be, no special touch at all. Also had Butter and Garlic Naan. Naan was soft but most thought Butter Naan scored over Garlic Naan.

In desserts not much option hence we opted for Gulab Jamun with Rabri. Don't fall for this by its name. Just two gulab jamuns with dollop of rabri as topping. Will not recommend unless you have sweet craving after heavy meal.

Service was very slow and I heard from many its deteriorating day by day. Received 10% of corporate discount. Price was not too high. For 11 adults final bill was INR 3265 inclusive all.

Note: For Friday lunch they have offer on kebab dishes where they serves 10 pieces instead of 6.

Last Saturday, we placed a bulk order to Sanjha Chulha for our office team lunch. The meal comprised of garlic naans, paneer tikka butter masala, chicken biriyani, chicken pulav, tandoori chicken, mutton roganjosh and kadhai chicken. Each and every item was delicious, notwithstanding that they were swimming in oil. Their USP is the punjabi essence that it evident in their cuisines. I intend to visit their restaurant next time to try out the other dishes.

Nothing great apart from a good view of the passing vehicles on the bypass. Average food.
Kebab was not that warm which was not enthusing and bread (lahsuni naan) was not soft

Visited this EMBypass eatery for dinner. Ordered their famous Bharwan Tangri kebab which was just something ive never tried so far. It took some preparation time but the wait was worth it. It was tangri with a layer of spiced and marinated chicken seekh cooked and then again a layer of another marinated creamy chicken held together on a chicken leg. With a dollop of mint chutney this kebab was a great to taste and apt appetizer. We moved to main course comprising butter naan, tandoori roti, chicken makhanwala and chicken pulao. The pulao was tasty to our delight and light as there was no biryani available but pulao covered up for the absence. The main chicken dish was good food too. In  all the starter is a winner of the dinner. Do try it next time you swing by this eatery.

Biryani is pretty decent ...
But rest isn't that remarkable .
Paneer items r good again..n had daal makhani which tasted like tadka!!!
N chicken bharta also tasted like normal curry chicken with chopped chicken bits here n there...no shredded chicken was included.
N oh their green salad is always a salad made n kept in prehistoric time!! So if u r opening that onion packet that comes along with ur food as well as the onion dumped below ur green-salad box...u better b ready for a stinky rotten veggie smell all over the place n that might kill Ur appetite too :/
Whatever rating I have given to this place is becoz of its oily n smooth biryani...which is an absolute hit hit for a biryani lover ;) : P

Another day, another Groupon Deal. I had been wanting to try this out because it was all about kababs. So made the purchase on Groupon (Rs 499 for 2 people) and then called the outlet. I tried many times but I could not get through. Either the line was busy or not answered. Finally they did answer, and they said no prior bookings were needed.

We headed there on a Saturday evening. After a bit of a work on locating this place, we parked (on the big ground in front) and walked up the steps to the first floor outlet. Somehow the place did not exude confidence. We were soon seated in the restaurant which was pretty passable. No complaints. It was standard decor, towards the darker side. Very artistic looking menus were provided. We went by the Groupon coupon (Kabab Platter with 16 pcs, one Dal Makhani, two Lachha parathas) and ordered two extra rotis. We were wondering whether to order a chicken curry separately, but the server very kindly advised us to wait as the coupon would would have sufficed. And as we found out soon enough, it was enough.

Serving time was par. The Fresh Lime Soda was well made, though I would have preferred slightly larger glasses. The Kabab platter looked interesting and the kababs had their individual tastes. There was mutton seekh, fish in mustard, another fish, a couple of chicken ones... 8 kinds in all. Some were cold and I had to return those along with a particularly all bones and no meat kabab they had! The rotis / parathas were well made too, rather swimming in butter. The Dal Makhani was standard, seemed to be made with a dollop of cornflour :-)

We were stuffed by the time we finished our meal. It was hearty and well enjoyed.

Been there a couple of weeks back and the ambiance has improved drastically since the last time we went there. Ordered keema polao, Kandhari murg, rumali roti and firni. While the roti was a bit hard, the rice was cooked to perfection. and the chicken preparation was too good. And I simply loved their firni. It was one of the best i had after arsalan. Service time was a bit longer than expected but the food more than made up for it. Overall a fantastic experience.

Oh the kebabs here are just mind blowing! Simply the best I've ever had in Kolkata! 

We had the Non Veg Kebab Platter. It was so so sooo good! There were 8 varieties of Kebabs - 2 pieces of each! I don't remember the names but there was an Ajwain Kebab that tasted outstanding! On asking the staff, he said that the kebabs in the kebab platter were not available on the menu. Whatever may it be, it was brilliant!

We also had the dal makhani and Butter Naans. They were pretty awesome too! 

I'd recommend this place to everybody and I'm hoping to visit them soon. :D

E.M by pass road is considered as one of the most important road way to the city connecting south kolkata and north kolkata...
Situated on the said road this resturent serves the best of my knowledge among all the nearby pocket friendly resturents... Serves a good quality food.. Though the serving time could be a little faster, this resturent will surly satisfy... Good thing is that it is a late night resturent and provides food till 2 after midnight. Good to visit on weekends.

Without harping on aesthetics too much, let me state right at the outset that I absolutely loved what was served to me here last evening. 
I was there with a friend who survives on food that strictly steers clear of animal flesh, so I too willingly made the most of chomping on authentic vegetarian food, after weeks of moribund non- veg fare. And my word, wasn't the food just too outstandingly good!
We weren't in the mood to have starters, so we jumped on to the MAIN COURSE bit without thinking twice. We settled for PANEER KULCHA, BUTTER NAAN, KADHAI PANEER and SUBZ QANDAHARI after a couple of minutes of deliberation. We didn't exactly have to wait for eons for the food to be served to our tables. The food arrived just at the right time and we binged along merrily for the next 30 minutes! The Kulchas and Naans were delightfully soft, the side dishes were scrumptiously oily with a creamy texture as I developed a special affinity for Subz Qandahari for it's unique blend of spices. The vegetarian food tasted so exquisitely good that I couldn't resist myself from ordering a PANEER TIKKA BUTTER MASALA for my folks back home.
But hey, I know this place specializes in authentic North Indian non- veg fare with a wide assortment of succulent kababs on offer every day of the year. This gives the carnivores in me& my friends enough reason to march in another evening and treat ourselves to a teeny- weeny piece of absolute bliss!

I have ordered a lot of times from Sanjha chulha for home delivery. I thought their food is nothing out of ordinary. However, in the recent past I visited the restaurant and I was mindblown with their food. They have the most awesome garlic naan and Angara chicken tandoori. I am sorry I don't have pictures to show because by the time the food arrived we were so hungry that we just began to dig into it.  Since then I have become a fan of this restaurant. Day before yesterday I went there with a group of friends and this time I ordered murg tawa lahsooni which was a starter. Awesome taste but had a big flaw! It had a lot of corriander seeds which I hate. So I have conflicting thoughts about this particular dish. Next we had keema naan and nizami keema matar which was ok. N then we finished off with the fresh lime soda and firni. Sanjha chulha biriyani is also very good. But if I had to choose between Sanjha and arsalan , I would go for arsalan. But my friends would disagree with my choice. However, to each his own. This is just my opinion.

it used to my kabab experiment place, when i started my proffessional career. i used to come here just only for the varity of kababs, a long back. i have visited this place just few months ago again. the ambience, inside decors are quite ok, a bit improved. both sofa and chairs are there as seating arrangement. the stuffs' behavior are quite impressive. but in my last visit, i found a little lack in their taste that used to bring me here. even i used to insist my colleagues to bring food from sanjha chulla for any occassion. 

Regarding food, i have tried almost all the chicken kababs here along with biriyani. chicken tikka, pahari, malai kababs were my favourites. but in my last visit and few office deliveries, i found the kababs a bit dry, biriyani was ok to have, nothing special. i took a mutton sidedish, but it was full of bones.

considering these few odds, i would still like to see sanjha chulla to come back with the same old taste and i would be more than happy to visit again after that...

Must say one of the best Indian food joint ever. Prompt service and delicious taste made our day. We ordered for Chicken , Mutton Biriyanis , Masala Kulcha, Keema Polao, Chicken Kalimirch, Chicken Rhara, Kandhari Chicken. Masala Kulcha, Keema Polao are awesome, though got mixed reviews about Biriyanies, personally I did not like that much. Kandhari Chicken contains juicy boneless chicken pieces dipped in very spicy and delicious gravy. Must try for all. Chicken Kalimirch ,made of keemas tastes very nice. Chicken Rhara contains giant leg pieces with a very tasty gravy, yet another must try. Quantity is more than enough for this price. I am really looking forward to taste their other items.

Very very very bad experience. I won't recommend it to my enemy, or may b I would. Do not go for their takeaway. A big no. I ordered 2 mutton biriyani parcels today. They charged me pretty good, that is to say I did not pay peanuts.. But look what I got.. Two packets of really poor quality biriyani( I would not be surprised if it were the left overs of the dine-ins that they parceled) it looked so soggy and greasy,and over spiced to the point of distastefulness. It looked bad the moment I opened the parcel, as if somebody has literally put his both hands into the handi and nastily mixed the contents to one's fill.. And I have not even started on the mutton part.. Sadly there is nothing from where I could start.. There were just crumbs of really stale mutton in it. The less said the better. I felt cheated. It was an awful experience. Do not ever order a takeaway from sanjha chulha, and biriyani is a strict no no.. They wil parcel you the diner's leftovers, and you would'nt hav a clue till you reach home.

Sanjha Chulha was a place earlier on to go to when in the area of science city there was nothing else... people used to crave the drive to this place as it was "far away" according to those days.... now in the time of  options so many options available around town this place has lost it charm and the quality of food has also gown down a notch.... 

the dal makhani and the paneer is pretty good out here while the other items are just average to below average experiences in taste.... 

they have redecorated this place as well which adds a little bit of ambiance to the place but does not help all that much... by 8 this place gets very crowded and getting a table then is a little bit of an effort... 

overall the food is pretty average and ok and the place is just about nice... just the problem is the surrounding as other places near it serves alcohol for a cheap price making it a little uncomfortable....

over and above this is a just about average place with just about average food...

chicken tikka
mushroom masala

dal makhani
butter chicken
chicken do piaza
garlic naan
cheese naan
tandoori roti

All the above items were good , special mention to aloo masala which was surprisingly great. The chicken pieces were soft and juicy and well prepared. A nice experience. Price could have been less specially considering the tax which they charge.

The ambiance is perfect for chilling out with your friends. The Malai Chicken Butter Masala is hitherto the best dish that I have tasted at Sanjha Chulha. The pulao and fried rice dishes have a strong aromatic flavour to add to your choice of chicken preparation. The staffs are well-mannered and well-behaved and the size of the bowls and vessels, in which the dishes are served, couldn't get any bigger. Highly recommended, especially when you are hungrily stranded at the otherwise "vehicularly"  populated E.M. By-Pass.

Had visited this place a few years back for a family celebration over dinner. 
The ambiance was nice and was somewhat okay for those days. 

As far as I recall, the Dal Makhani, Paneer Tikka Butter Masala, Cheese Kulcha, Butter Naan were the only few things that tasted good. 
The dishes that completely turned us off were Pindi Chana (the chickpeas weren't boiled properly) & Masala Kulcha (the filling was quite bland). 

The service was quite slow out here and the staff was laid back. 
Prices were pocket friendly. 

-The whole experience lacked the value for money. 
Overall an average experience.

Our Rating

Food -- 3
Decor -- 3

Value for Money ----  2.5
Portion -----  4

We visited the restaurant for Lunch. It was hot summer day and the restaurant was completely empty .  It was Fully AC and therefore a relief from outside heat. Overall ambiance was  average, but It looks like most of the sells are takeaway and therefore waiters have lots of free time and they were chatting among themselves in front of customers.

The food we ordered, were delivered promptly. Also waiters voluntarily suggest about the food combination and that was impartial therefore I will say very good .  Food taste was average and nothing special and gravy taste same. The portion was good for  2 people.  Overall it looks costly when I took everything into consideration.

Suggestion ----  I will not suggest it for couples or going out for Dinner. I think One time meal while you are in that area for work and want to go for lunch/dinner Otherwise takeaway for a change in taste is the best option.

The waiters were not very gentle and at the peak time you have to wait outside in open place .'d visited there in Puja.We had ordered Lassi,Dum Aloo Punjabi,Chicken Biriyani,Mile Jhule Pulao(which acctually tasted like Mixed Fried Rice),Butter Chicken Masala(that was delicious and finger licking),and chicken daal tarka(also awesome).Well I could not say the overall cooking or ambiance  was bad but pretty average. Bad was their behaviours,I know they were under a lot of pressure during Puja days but that's their job right?we expect them to be courteous. and the Management may provide a sitting arrangement in shodow at the time of Puja.

Loved the chicken dishes here. Angara tandoori murg was my favorite! Even tried out the tasty chicken tikkas! Should say, great north Indian food in Kolkata.
Good ambiance and service.

I'm a huge fan of this restaurant. Being a foodie and a mutton lover, I had ordered bhuna mutton with butter nun and that tasted awesome. I also loved the chicken 65 and chicken malai butter masala. Should mention that the chicken dishes are delicious here. Great Mughlai food at a reasonable price.
Liked the ambiance and had a lovely time with my family.

This is a pretty average North Indian restaurant having nothing much to go gaga about. It is not extraordinary nor there is too much to criticize about the place.
The ambience is pretty good and the service is commendable.
The food is kind of OK. I love their Mili Juli Polao. The kebabs are also pretty good.  Somehow it lacks the X factor or the zing that makes a place better than the average. 
However I won't rate it badly and will recommend it for a good overall dining experience.

the only time i sat and ate at sanjha c, it was a bad experience, but that was almost three years ago to be fair. since then we order food home very regularly and their tandoori chicken (regular and various varieties) are pretty great. butter chicken for once tastes close to the real punjabi butter chicken and not the bengali (white gravied) version. food is good, delivery time is ok (can be improved upon) . overall a good place to order your tikkas, etc. for a north indian, non vegetarian meal at home.

In this column most of reviews says that Sanjha Chulha -- bah bah that means great and I see this restro when ever I go through the bypass so I went there in one fine day with my better half to enjoy our lunch but I think that is my mistake that I carried a corporate lunch coupon with us value of 1800/- to 2100/-for 2. They took it and take maore than 30 minutes  to confirm about the coupon whether I had a pre booking then they offered us a combo meal. Ok up to this its fine now they served water with such glasses that I hd to change and at last they served us our much awaited lunch just to disappoint me in every aspect that is in decorum etc. specially in quantity u see our coupon value is not vey low.Only thing is good that ambiance.Quality of food is so -so coz u can get those items extremely well in many known or unknown restros.

Well, this is the first time I'm reviewing on zomato.
The place is located conveniently, though the recent construction work going around nearby may deprive it of the location 'stars'. Ambience is good, they have two decent sized halls for dine-in. Staff is courteous and service quite prompt. We were a total of 5 people, 3 of us being veggies. We tried Shahi Paneer, Subz Kadahi and some chicken dish along with tandoori roti and jeera rice. Food quality was good and quantity wise it was more than perfect. Not expensive. Would visit it again.

The location may not be the best considered the construction of the flyover near science city. Too much dust and uneven roads. But once you get inside, you'll like the atmosphere of the place. They have two huge area for sitting. Both are clean and well maintained. The one on the left has been renovated and looks awesome.

The food specially Chicken Bharta (white gravy), Chicken do Piyaza, Kadhai Chicken are awesome. The quality of chapatis, Nans and kulchas are equally good. Chicken Biryani is good. Regarding starters they have good paneer preparations as well. Firni and Rabri with Gulab Jamun is good.

This is one of the better options for Mughlai food in Kolkata at great price.

Good location is the strongest point. As far as the food is concerned, it is safe to stick to the North Indian dishes- the dal tadka, rotis, chicken bhartha and the kebabs are all above average. The tandoori chicken is well made if they are not under pressure with a lot of orders.  But the biriyani and other stuff on the menu card is best left alone. Definitely over hyped and priced but once again, the location scores above anything else.

This place feels like a crossover between a roadside dhaba and a decent restaurant .
All the items in the menu are dhaba styled spicy 
Babycorn 65 is worth trying though my non veg friend says that the chicken 65 is way better 
Some items feel overpriced based on quality and taste though the quantity nevertheless is good
Ambiance usually is noisy and staff are not very well trained .
Spoons and Plates felt a bit greasy though.
Parking is not an issue .

A restaurant serving average quality food with lots of hype surrounding it, primarily because its on E.M.Bypass, and acts as a roadside dhaba. Kebabs and tandoor items are average and overpriced. The worst item on the menu, Biryani. Seriously, what were they thinking ? A simple add-on to your Murgh/Gosht Biryani is exorbitant. And it tasted so below average. The mutton pieces were full of fat and were greasy. A strict no no. You can try other dishes, but do not have Biryani. 
You have been warned !!!

Ordered :-
•Fish tikka
•Chicken kandhari
•Paneer tikka makhanwala
•Mili jhuli subzi
•Butter naan
•Salad

They served us the food within 15-20 minutes. First I had the fish tikka, it was very soft (seemed as if it melted in my mouth) the taste was also brilliant. Then with the butter naan I had the other three. Mili jhuli sabzi was good in taste, paneer makhanwala was also good and the chicken kandhari was amazing! The chicken had a fenugreek leaves flavour which made it "hatke".
That day it was raining heavily and thanks to the men present over there who helped us a lot.

P.S. Don't forget to have the Chicken Kandhari if you are a non - vegetarian.

I've been visiting Sanjha Chulha for years now, food over here is good and in the starters I personally love the way they prepare chicken 65. It is different and better than what I've tasted in Hyderabad. You should try their Kesariya Murgh in starters which is regular tandoori chicken marinated with kesar milk. It adds to the flavor. Murgh malai makhanwala and chicken lababdaar in the main course are my personal favorites. You should try the stuffed cheese nan they serve here. Its very nice. Lahsooni nan aka Garlic nan is also at par. 
Off late Sanjha Chulha has introduced their new section, "Pind" which has a better ambiance and decor though the aisle is not sufficient to comfort customers. Initially they would allow customers to choose the section they'd like to thereby avoiding extra charges which you have to pay at "Pind". Now they force you to "Pind" and the prices has gone up by quite a high percentage. Its no more pocket friendly but the food remains to be taste bud friendly. :)

No doubt this place gives the feel of a dhaba alongside a national highway...Ambience in the new section is nice but I still miss the old ambience which I assume to be in the right part of first floor....Chicken 65 is legendary here and I believe its the best in town A-la-carte starter...Biriyani & kadhai chicken were pretty good and amount was satisfying...The waiters are decent too...Nice place worth a visit if you prefer punjabi food...Must try tandoori bhetki as the starter....

Went there during last pujo. and the food tasted good. And that says a lot. Nowadays there is some construction work going on in the area but the management seems to have made alternate arrangements for car parking. Last time around my friends and I really liked the Mile Jule Pulao. It's a non-veg pulao, with chicken, chicken sausages and shrimps, if I remember correctly. It's not sweet. The rest of the fare was decent too.

This is located very near Science city and it used to be a regular place we ordered food from for almost 6 months. 
The place is consistent with the food. And they also give generous portions ... I cant say they are remarkable, but value for money for sure.

I dont like eating here as it is usually crowded and very noisy ... But usually opt for take away. 

Coming to the food.. The tandoori items are good. Especially the mutton seekh, the veg seekh and the fish tikka. 

Even the main courses are decent Would recommend the methi chicken (had it long ago) and the chicken bharta. 

 Their consistent taste is their biggest strength .

It was heavily raining outside when we reached there for an authentic North Indian Lunch. And believe me, Sanjha Chulha is one of the best dining place for those who love North Indian food. The Do Ratni Dal is a must try and also the Mila Jula Pulao. I was in a dilemma whether to have this or not. But i decided to go with my Fiance's choice, as she had some wonderful moments over there. And trust me the food was superb. 

But there are some setbacks. They should at least develop the parking area. It became hell and muddy after the drizzle. Although they have Valet parking, but those who don't own a car, have to cross the muddy parking area to get a cab from Bypass. And some of the staffs really need to be more professional and quick enough to respond to a  customer call. 

Above all..... this place is must try and i am looking forward for another outing over there and want to have the Do Ratni once. Cheers

I didn't like their desserts though and feel they should introduce more varities in this department. Overall it was a very nice experience.

This is a Punjabi cuisine beside EM Bypass near Ruby crossing.I have seen it for many years during passing through the by pass but never had the time to try it.Last week during a joy ride with my girl friend we planned to visit this place and we slowed our car and saw there is vast space for parking,a field actually in front of the restaurant.Then i was surprised when a boy with red uniform came and told me to hand over the car key to him,that is they have valet parking facility and then i noticed a board which displayed the name and below it was written about the valet parking with an arrow towards the restaurant.At that i moment i felt just like to be at a roadside dhaba beside a long highway..it feels great you know....

We stepped up at the 1st floor,at the left hand side there is a glass door of a restaurant named "pind-an extension of sanjha chulha" and we stepped in and acquired a table beside a glass window from where we can see the busy EM Bypass.Ambiance is therefore decent and it was time for order our lunch.

Though we never tried any soup except chinese cuisine,my girlfriend forced me to order a soup named "murgh makai malai shorba" as far i remember and it was hot and really tasty and huge in portion though the white colour of the soup was a let down.Then for the main course we ordered butter naan and "murgh methi malai"...ahh,this is a dish i will remember for long.Delicious chicken with an amazingly tasty gravy with a hint of methi made our lunch to the higher level and i swiped up to the last drop of the gravy,it was neither too spicy nor to bland,just perfect to go with naan or kulcha.I recommend everyone to taste this awesome dish.

Service is a little bit on slower side,as we had to call them every time to fill the glass of water,to serve another naan or to provide bill but i ignored these fault once again when i saw them to give a TAB to fill up a feed back form.

Over all it was a good experience to be there.

Of the many restaurants that have come up along em bypass sanjha chulha has to one of the better ones. It has been for many times been our go to place after a drive on bypass on saturday nights and I have to say they serve some top notch north indian food. The decor is pretty decent not too spacious but adequate enough to house a usual weekend crowd. But the food speaks for itself. The dals remind you of the tadka dals served in roadside highway dhabas. The kebabs are pretty decent. Of the main course my pick has to be the murg tikka makhani. But the one thing that everyone should try here is tge cheese kulcha. Stuffed with ample cheese it is in itself tasty enough to be enjoyed without any side dish. The menu has been redone recently and the prices have been upped but it is worth it.

My family & I had been there on Teej, celebrating Sindhara- a hindu festival.
We reached there by 7:40 and the place was empty- only one group of friends there. But by 8 pm, the place was almost full.
The place is divided in two sections. One section is renovated with improved ambiance whereas the other part is just like before- white walls and the old normal tables.
The arrangement of the table and the sofa wasn't up to my liking- the sofa was too low given the height of the table.
Anyway, coming to the food, we ordered a tandoori aalu: It wasn't so great. Just felt like boiler baby potatoes with some spices smeared.
Then came the baby corn 65: It is an amazing Indian take on the chinese dish. Absolutely different from whatever you get anywhere. The curry leaves took this dish to another height & the babycorns were crispy.
The tomato shorba fell absolutely flat- more like a gracy of some dish.

 For the main course we ordered Zafrani kofta- tasted good, except for it being a little too salty.
We modified The methi malai paneer and made them add sweet corn- it was the absolute show stealer. I LOVED it.
The masala kulcha wasn't up to the mark either. However, the onion kulcha was really good.
The jeera rice was nice, but the pind di dal (dal makhni) wasn't delicious :3

The worst thing was however, the jaljeera. they charged some 70-80 bucks for the jaljeera which was just the jaljeera packet powder which is available for 2 bucks in any small shop. 

All in all a very average experience.

decor: decent enough with a feel like hatari.
food: excellent. especially the kababs. the angara murg tandoori which is a spicier version of the chicken tandoori is a must try. the mutton seekh kababs were also really well prepared, like the ones you get in authentic places in Delhi. in the main course we had masala kulcha, mutton rogan josh and garlic naan. the kulcha was ordinary. but the mutton was really tasty which was enhanced because of the fact that it was boneless. i had read good reviews about the garlic nan of this place in zomato and it didn't disappoint me. the firni didnot satisfy me though as it was sticky and not cold enough. the sweet lime soda was a perfect way to end the heavy meal. we left quite satisfied especially when the bill was hardly Rs.1500 for 4 persons

North Indian food is what Sanjha Chulha serves !! The food is pretty good and the cost is also a little on the cheaper side. The place is just located on the bypass 10 mins from the Ruby Hospital crossing. Its hugely popular for the ample parking space it offers. Ideal for takeaways. The service is a letdown. The staff is forgetful and needs to be continuously rushed to get your order. The Non-Veg dishes especially Kadhai Chicken is a must try. The food although tasty is sometimes inconsistent in their quality and that is definitely a spoiler.

A must try if you are on a bit of a budget and want some dhaba experience. Takeaway would be ideal though if North Indian on a budget is what you are looking for!!!!!

went Sanjha Chulha with my partner Rohan just yesterday. An awesome experience.. We ordered mutton biryani.. I haven't expected that much from this restaurant.. We were having a cozy seat and were enjoying every spoon of that biryani.. To me, that is the only biryani which can beat Arsalan.. In fact, me and my partner were fighting over the pieces of mutton.. The biryani was so light and well cooked that you never feel overloaded..and the flavours were just amazing.. I just cannot wait to taste the other recipes of Sanjha Chulha.. the sitting arrangements were pretty good.. The ambiance will help you to relish your food.. I am very happy and satisfied with their biryani.. and prices are okay.. So i just love sanja chulha and will go there very soon to grab other dishes..

Their Gosht Biryani (mutton) is one of the best available in Kolkata. Everything else on the menu is pretty decent too. The major plus for this place is the ample parking space that they have. 
A perfect place for a family lunch and dinner. The waiters are quite pleasant too.
Do give it a try.

I was taken here by my school friends quite long back, and I remember having a pretty decent Biryani experience. We were a group of about 10 guys, there more fun than anything else, and I'm pretty sure our loud storytelling was a good source of irritation to the staff, buy the service was beyond any complaint. We basically had a plate of Biryani each along with some chicken gravy to ease the gulping down. The food is quite good, and prices go easy on the pocket. The location makes it quite accessible too. I might visit again soon .....it's been a while.

NORTH INDIAN FOOD @ SANJHA CHULHA
2.5 out of 5

For people who love north Indian food, Sanjha Chulha, located very near Science City, provides a decent dining experience. In comparison with other North Indian restaurants this is not a much sought after restaurant. The ambience and decor of the new section of the restaurant greatly enhances the dining experience at the restaurant though it is definitely nothing great, so do not raise your expectations too much. The jeweled tone decor lends a sophisticated atmosphere to the whole setting. The seating arrangements are comfortable and cozy, but at times it could get too cramped for comfort. 

Their food and service needs improvement though. The place serves food that tastes is very inconsistent (sometimes excellent to middling) at economical prices. The food is economical considering the quantity and quality of food they serve (on a good day the food is quite nice!). At the same time, the food served here does bring out the essence of roadside dhaba fare. Consistency is not a strong point of this food joint. Sometimes, their roti would be stiff and unpalatable. The quality of their meat items (be it chicken, mutton, or fish) suffer from the occasional drop in standard.

Nevertheless, they do have some meat dishes that are house bestsellers. No meal is complete without having them. These are handi da kukkad, chicken malai kebab, Kadhai chicken, tandoori fish, rogan josh and tandoori chicken. These can be had with their array of Indian bread offerings. Amongst them, the garlic Nan deserves a mention. On the surface of the nans, you will find crisp and caramelized garlic pieces. Even their dal and soup preparations are wonderful side dishes. The flavours and aromas of the Indian spices used in the dishes are evident in all of them. A proper North Indian meal cannot do without their good old lassi and soda shikanji. To round off the meal they offer desserts like firni, rabri and gulab Jamun of which the firni is the only one we have tried.

Went there on a Sunday evening.The old section was crowded for some birthday party celebrations, so waited for about 15 mins and then were seated in Pind, the new section. the decor and lighting was ok, and the seating comfortable but the tables were too close to each other for comfort, and being jam packed didn't help.
We ordered mutton galouti kebab, garlic naan and Kandahari chicken.
The galouti kebab was basically 4 flat balls (shaped like mutton tikiya) of minced mutton with a blob of sour cheese at the centre.The dish was unusual and nicely made, though a bit on the tangy side.It was quite filling as well.
The Garlic naan was a treat for those who love the flavour of garlic.The pieces of garlic were crisp and caramelised sticking all over the surface of the naan. tasted quite nice.
The Kandahari chicken, though tasty was nothing exceptional.We were amused to find pieces of curry leaves in the gravy!! Nice fusion of afghanistan (kandahar) and south India, must say!! :)
The bill was reasonable Rs.616/- including VAT.
Overall, we liked the taste and would like to try out the other dishes on our next visit.

This is a good place for people who have an affinity for good north Indian food and do not really care much about the quantity and price comparison. I think the service should also be made a tad better.  Overall its fine but can be improved as there are numerous other better restaurants there.

We were very frequent to this restaurant, but then realized quality of food is very inconsistent. Same dish will taste different on different days. Basically two types of dishes are a viable one white gravy based &other one red gravy based rest all will taste same.

Never been dissapointed ! Awesome Tandoori Chicken - #1 recommendation

Main dishes are good : Try for any North Indian Dishes.. You will love it !

Avoid Biriyani ! this is a pain part here....

Dishes are a bit oily so make sure you are not a cal consious human being ;-P

Its an average roadside dhaba, ambience nothing special,food quality poor. we ordered masala kulcha, chicken malai kabab, fish tikka amritsari and mixed veg, all the items were bad, fish was not bhetki, some low quality rubbery fish..price was higher for the quality of food they serve.

Sanjha Chula and its Chicken Malai Kabab had been a favorite for years. The place supplies good food at reasonable price. 

The ambiance is not really great to take your family. But their home delivery is pretty effective. The Kali Dal is also great. Chicken Tandoor has deteriorated off late. The Tandoor Fish has also lost its charm. But having said that, the place is definitely producing good stuff at reasonable price.

The meaning of the name suggests that diners should get good straight out of the oven, but alas the food does not suggest that.  Very much roadside unbranded dhabas on NHs, not the top notch ones.  should do some justice to the name.

While I would recommend some of the food at Sanjha Chulha (Kadhai Chicken, for example, and the Makai Khumb, I personally do not like the ambiance much. I would much rather go and call them up to get food ordered to my home. They have an extensive circle where they deliver (Right upto Kamalgazi More) and that is a great thing for those hungry hogs who are too tired to go out.

Its a nice place that offers services till late of nite. The place is nicely decorated. I had Murgh Biryani, Roti and Hand da kukkad. They make great tandoori murgh. The tastes are good and not too much spicy. The seating has a nice ambience. It can accomodate quite a big no of people.The service is very quick. The prices are affordable.

I ordered from here so cant comment bout the ambiance. The food i ordered from here was some prawns which were served very untidy. The over all taste of the prawns was good but it always seemed that I am eating some thing "not clean". Laccha parathas here were well made but the chicken kadhai was just ok. They put too much capsicum and too many small shredded onions which made the dish loose taste. Chicken was fresh but again the dish felt unpolished. Overall a so so meal good for one time ordering

This place started out with great promise but has steadily gone down - hill since ! The tandoori chicken , murgh malai kebabs and dal amritsari were pretty decent but of late the overall taste and quality has gone down badly. The serving staff is all at sea and very slow to react to any request from the guests. The cleanliness is very questionable and last time I felt the chicken bharta was stale and had a attack of food poisioning after eating it. Thereafter I have not visited this place. Hope they pull up their socks.

Perhaps a 5 star rating would seem a little overboard! But the delicious kebabs make me very generous! It is a delightful experience to dine at Sanjha Chulha! The wonderful dishes make it worth every penny you spend! It doesn't pinch your pocket a lot and is total value for money! The knockout dish is the Mushroom Matar and do order the Makai Seekh Kebab!

Have been there two times and i felt the biriyanis,tandoori were middling and nothing special. but i liked the Chicken Rogan josh. Staffs are a bit weird cause when i asked one of them to serve pepsi, they served a glass of water.....The Tandoori roti was stiff and very hard to tear....It is nor bad or worst but its a good restaurant... actually a dhaba kind. I would rate 3.5 for it.

Economical food with a wow factor !

PRO's :

Ambience right on the mark, quite chic
Food was just what the doctor ordered ! Quite tasty and totally worth every penny
The best thing which i liked was their presentation really involved some effort

CON's :

Service was quite below average.
If one is very hungry, he might as well die before he can be fed !!
Location is Yuuckkky ! 

FINAL VERDICT :

A well made restaurant in that part of Bypass, with good food and quite economical as well.
Considering the lack of quality places to eat around there, this one seems to be a gold mine !!

We used to come down to Sanja Chulah from Sector 5 somedays and it was worth it. The kebabs and biriyani is pretty decent at the place. Service is a bit on the slower side and there is much scope of improvement in that front. The assortment of breads and roti available is quite good. The Masala Khulcha was pretty good each and every time.

Contrary to popular belief Sanjha Chulha is terrible because they serve EXTRA ! Yes you have read it right!!
Along with your order they have their own bodily hairs to offer you.So for me, a place which has no hygiene as such, I would definitely give it a minus rating if possible.

I once went to the Maruti driving school and while returning I was terribly hungry. Sanjha Chulha was the place that gave me the goose bumps when I tasted their biryani. Its scintillatingly tasty. The phirni tasted divine and for a moment I thought I had never tasted anything like it. Maybe it was my hunger pangs then. Nevertheless the food is tasty and had it not been so far away from my line of duties, I would have been a regular.

Sanjha Chuha is popularly known as a 'Dhaba' - being located on the Eastern Metropolitan (EM) Bye-Pass. We found the 'Dhaba' was on the first floor and had a quite large sitting area. We had gone at dinner time and enjoyed the food in general and particularly liked the Murg Pahari Kebab.

Bharwan Tangri was awesome.....never ate a kebab like this before.....two chicken legs filled with yummy stuffing....nothing less than superb would do to describe it! Other dishes are also very good. Starting with babycorn 65 and paneer tikka makhani. Babycorn was to tasty that I really wanted to order another dish,but saved the hunger for the other dishes. Chicken kalimirch is not recomended for those who can not eat hot and spicy food. Hundi de kukkud was good. overall a satisfying experience.

I liked "Chicken malai kebab" and "Chicken makkhanwala" very much (Didn't like "Chicken tikka" which was below average). Masala kulcha was also great! But don't try their Biriyani it's below average. Don't judge this place eating Biriyani. Try Kebabs, Indian Breads and some of Chicken Mutton dishes.
