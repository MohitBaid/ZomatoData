The food was very spicy... They used lots of chilli powder and dry red Chilli that the entire dish just smelled of chillies.  Tasty but too spicy

I had ordered their Mutton Rogan Josh and Cantonese Chicken. And at the price the restaurant is charging for the dishes, I was fairly surprised at how good the food tastes. The food was delicious, filling and totally worth the money.

The mutton Rogan Josh was amply spiced. The meat was tender, juicy and the right sized. The preparation wasn't too oily. Liked it a lot.

The Cantonese Chicken was a bit on the sweet side. Would have liked it more if it were a bit spicier. Otherwise, it was quite delicious.

Will order again soon.

The delivery was really fast in this time of Christmas eve.Coming to the food , we ordered drums of heaven , burnt ginger and capsicum rice and cantonese chicken. 
The rice was really good and so was the cantonese chicken but i am really disappointed with the drums of heaven which had a heavy outer coating though the gravy was no doubt tasty.

Ordered mixed fried rice and kung pao chicken. Tastewise fried rice was ok but quantitywise it was more than enough for 2 people and chicken was just awesome.

Good little takeaway food outlet in naktala. Prices are quite pocket friendly.

Tried the following:-

1. Chicken hot & sour soup - Good quantity of hot & sour soup consisting of chicken,mushroom & chopped vegetables. Good in taste with good balance between hot & sour taste.

2. Fish fingers - 6pcs of healthy looking fish fingers served with mayo dip. The stuffing of basa was generous. The fish was very fresh & well marinated, it was super tasty. The outer crispness was also spot on.

Total value for money. Both the quantity and quality are up to the mark, which is why I am one of their most regular customers! The combos are awesome, and the crispy chilli mushroom, crispy chilli potatoes...they are phenomenal!

The Combo offer is undoubtedly Very Very Lucrative for those having passion for both Chinese & Tibetan foods. Keeping in mind that this is a Combo Offer and Not Full Plate has Satisfactory quantity of Hakka type Noodles with 3 good sized well tendered boneless Chicken pieces with Option to select one's favorite taste. This Combo has the Tibetan Food Chicken Momo 2pcs with only Sauce. The soup is Missing, and I feel this could be easily managed by this Restaurant without extra cost. One I did not like is that the chicken pieces in the Noodles were over fried and thus lost its natural tenderness. These two improvements are required.

We had ordered a fish finger and a dry chilli chicken.
Dry chilli chicken was good but there wasn't any capsicum.
Fish finger was horrible.
Batter lacks any sorts  of flavour and the fish wasn't good. There was practically no fish inside. It was full of Maida.

Not recommended  to anyone.
Worst place.

Thank you for spoiling our evening this way.

First of all let me say, I am a regular user of zomato, I've tried many restaurants.
Now Happy Eating is the only place I order foods from, the reasons are,,,
1. Price, 2. quality, 3, 3. Quantity, 4. fast delivery,
For the price the quality and quantity of foods you get is just unbelievable. They always deliver 20 mins before estimated time.
Price - 5/5
Quality - 4.5/5
Quantity - 5/5

Would recommend it 10/10
