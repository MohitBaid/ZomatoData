On my sister's birthday I wanted some cupcakes. On being recommended this place by my friend, I decided to give this place a try. 

The minimum order for any type of cupcakes is six. I ordered Red Velvet Cupcakes with Cheese Cream and Chocolate Cupcakes with Ganache Cream. The cupcakes were well decorated and looked attractive. They were soft. The size of the cupcakes was satisfactory as compared to its price. 

Overall I like the place. People with a sweet tooth can give it a try.

Absolutely phenomenal. The kind of stuff they can make is absolutely exotic and one of a kind. Every time I've had anything made by them, I'm left speechless and I only feel like ordering them again immediately.

Chocolic cakes and puddings are the best I've tried recently. We ordered a cake for my friends birthday, creamy dark chocolate with a layer of orange and it was the best pudding I remember having eaten. Even the cookies with a Nutella base are to die for. The chef and owner helps you personally to design your cake and customize your order with a smile and it's worth every penny (even more). Always going to be a happy customer!

Just brilliant. Never had such an amazing cake. Highly recommended. Not only did the cake look beautiful, but it even tasted better. The price was nothing compared to what it was.
Keep up the good work.

Desserts have never been better looking, better in taste and have never had better value for money. They'll exceed your expectations every time.
