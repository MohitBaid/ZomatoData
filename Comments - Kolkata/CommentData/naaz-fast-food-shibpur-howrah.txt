I will cut to the chase-
food quality-not good (read: horrible); they add so much scent to their biryani, after 1-2 spoons, you will keep the food to rest in peace. Their Roll corner is good, makes kind of decent egg chicken roll/egg roll.
ambiance- O_o
hygiene- not good.
Try other food joints opposite to this place, at least they won't let your tongue down.

Had a good experience while giving them a bulk order of biriyani during freshers welcome at BE college. I guess this is the only biriyani joint in shibpur that serve chicken biriyani from desi murgi. Tastes better than it's nearby competitors.
