This is a pure vegetarian outlet right as you enter Bidhan Sarani from 5 point. The place is a strictly no-frills place, the interior really is weird,with gaudy,chaotic wall decor but simple tables and chairs.
The food is good, I had their masala dosa and the sambar was nicely done with that beautiful tang. Then again,for 110 bucks,I'd expect a masala dosa to be damn good.

Its overall a good food place but the rates are a bit high . Average look of the restro doesnt demand much of hype bt food is tasty  . It wont disappoint a foodie bt rates and quantity may do . 
I like the masala kulcha and corn capsicum here and the maharaja thali is also good. 
Being located very near to the Shyambazar 5 point the place is catchy nd crowded alws. Good place for pure vegetarians  .

Well..this place at shyambazar..umm..makes kind of okayish south indian food...
Being a pure veg store..i missed the onions and garlic..but however the cheese masala dosa was very average..the masala was a bit bland..the veggies tasted pretty bland..the sambar was good..but the coconut chutney was pretty average..
The uttapam was decked like a pizza..tasted pretty bland..
We ordered thumbs up..but the bill showed masala cola..while there was no masala..on enquiry..they said..the price is same for both masala and plain..strange place..overpriced..

Located at the shyambajar 5 point crossing it has spot on loaction. It has both AC and non AC sitting arrangement. The decor could have been much better. Its a veg restaurant serving Chinese, North indian and south indian food. We ordered tandoori roti, lahori kofta and Navratna korma. The korma was a little too sweet for me. The kofta had too much kasturi methi. The good point is that the food here is not oily. Overall an average experience. Very good for vegetarians.

Quite cheap, pocket-friendly old-school joint with smiling and cordial staffs. Hit items in the menu include Masala dosa, butter naan, paneer butter masala, utthapam, papdi chat, Chinese combo thali, dahi-vada, lassi, chocolate shake with ice cream,kulfi and much more. A must visit place for people who happen to be in shyambazar for any reason.

Its one of my favourite restaurants in Kolkata.
It does not serve Non Veg Food.
They served also Veg food.
I had their 
1)Vegetable fried rice with sweet corn(Very tasty)
2)Malai Kofta
3)Masala kulcha
4)Butter nan
5)Chana Masala
6)Green salad
Everything is quite good as they are very much specialized in making these veg foods.
Malai Kofta is just mind blowing.
AC restaurant.You can seat in Ground floor as well as in 1st floor(little bit higher price for having lunch or dinner in AC )
Service->Average 
Wthether you are Vegeterian or not must visit here.

Its a pure veg restaurant with no onion and no garlic. So to make their dishes tasty all their dishes are both spicy and oily. Dosas are very good here. My personal favourites are their mix vegetable, fried rice, kulcha, malai kofta and paneer butter masala. Gajar ka halwa is a must try here.  The airconditioned part of the restro is small and quality of service is mediocre.

There are few joints are there in so called Old Kolkata, North Kolkata, those are ruling the streets for decades. Dimpi is such type of restaurant. Located near the Shyambazar 5 Point crossing, so easy to find. Been there few days ago with one of my friends just for have some quick bite item.

Now come to the review part -

Positive Point -

1. Full Veg Food - There are very few outlets are there, that serves you full veg item. So blessing for them, those who loves veg food.

2. Variety and pricing – Although they serves only veg item but they have some great variety in food. From North Indian to South Indian, all types of foods are available here.

3. Service – The stuffs are really good in terms of their service and behavior. But lack of perfection is very much noticeable.

Negative Point –

Nothing as such negative point I found there, except the payment method. They accepts only cash. No cards are accepted there, so check your wallet balance before placing order. 

We ordered –

1.	Dahi Vada – This is one of the popular item there. The item tastes really good. Two big pieces of Vada were served in Dahi with chutney, jhuri vaja and few pomegranate on top. Looks well and tastes good too. Full recommendation on my side.

2.	Masala Dosa – Comes in a triangular shape with chutney and sambar dal. The outer crust was not so crispy and the masala inside it, is also not worthy. Just mashed potato, cooked with spices. Nothing extraordinary and fails to satisfy my taste bud.

3.	Mango Lassi – A big glassful pulpy mango juice, came with Rose water. The juice was very much dense in nature, which justify its purity. Dry fruits on top makes this drink really wonderful. Probably one of the best Mango lassi, I have ever tried. Full recommended.

With all three items mentioned above, it costs only 250INR, which is really a decent pricing. They don’t add any kinda VAT or Service charges, all the pricing are inclusive of all taxes, so it is really a blessings when you are tight on your budget. In conclusion, I will say, Dimpi is one of the best budget restaurant in its area. Being a South Indian restaurant, lack of South Indian flavor is very much noticeable. But, if you ask about other food, they are really good. Overall a good dining experiences.

This place is located a few steps from Shyambazar Bidhan sarani crossing towards Shyambazar Tram depot. It's basically a pure vegetarian restaurant with basic ambience. The food is really tasty although the price is just on the higher side. The lassi,masala cold drinks are very good. It's a very good place to have dosa. The veg Hakka chowmin is also very tasty with lots of corns, veggies and paneer in it.

Visited this place yesterday. This joint looks really old but thankfully it is clean and service is quick. It experiences a really high footfall and hence the staff is almost always super busy and sometimes they get stuff mixed up. Had lassi while waiting for a take-away of naan and paneer butter masala. The lassi was great- an assortment of rabdi, badaam, milk and anaar over the normal components. A little too sweet for me though. The naan and paneer were very good- soft, low oil, low in spices. Over-all a good experience.

Located very near to the great five point xing at  Shyambajar. Its a purely veg restaurant. It serves north indian, south indian and chiense foods. We ordered a Dimpi special Masala Dhosa, lassi with ice cream. Taste is superb. Ambiance is good. It has both AC and Non Ac service. Sitting zones are comfortable. But only low point was the behaviour of the staffs. They were more busy with watching Television  rather than to listen to our orders carefully. Hope they will improve it. Overall a good veg restaurant.

It is a pure vegetarian restaurant. I went with a friend over there. It's located in close proximity to Shyambazar. We ordered for aloo paratha, shahi paneer and paneer butter masala. The aloo paratha was good but the paneer butter masala was too good. The paneer is tender, well cooked and gravy is too buttery that's enough to salivate on it's smell. The restaurant is pocket friendly and the staffs are well behaved.

Located at a prime location like Shyambazar Crossed. They serve Indian and Chinese Veg Dishes only along with Sweet, Deserts and Smoothies. Have not visited there in recent times. From the memory lane I can just say that quality of food they serve is pretty good in reasonable price tag and friendly environment. Yet I remember I had Mixed Chat, Special Dosa and Lassi. 
Probably the only Good Quality Vegetable Restaurant available in Shyambazar.

Been here today for lunch. I really hated their service and ambience!!!! Pathetic!
Their service is Dhaba type. I ordered 1 dimpi special masala dhosa and 1 combo fried rice which come along with a two piece of veg manchurian. Both rice and manchurian tested stale, rotten so I couldn't actually eat them. Dhosa was good though.
It was a waste of money and time both. They use to ask for tips on billing.
No recommendation!

It is a pure vegetarian restaurant and generally serves good quality stuffs. However there are times they tend to dish out worst food too.

Possibly the only good quality veg restaurant in shyambazar area.

The food is nice although quality of noodles coild have been better.

They dont offer ac so you may have to face a lot of sound pollution of tge shyambazar crossing.

The mistis are nice but again comparing with the price tag not soo good deal

It is a pure vegetarian restaurant and generally serves good quality stuffs. However there are times they tend to dish out worst food too.

In my last visit I opted for Masala Dosa which was too salty for me and hence I did not like it.

Well, you can visit at your own risk.

I visited dimpi to try out the malai lassi. And it was yummy. Thick,creamy and smooth. It was a glass full of heaven. 
Now about ambiance its nothing special. Should visit the place for the lassi . HAPPY EATING 😊

Dimpi is a place I used to go as a kid with my mom and dad.. fond memories. Always liked this place for the emotional connection I had mostly. I tasted dosa for the first time in my life in this place! It has always been a great experience for me. It has been awhile since I have been there since I do not live in Kolkata anymore. But my parents still visits and still love the food!

No onions and no garlic
Food to try out hakka noodles with gobhi manchurian.
The noodles itself has hefty amounts of veggies included in it even paneer is there and without onions and garlic the noodles tastes awesome.
Dimpi's special dosa is also good
Hot gulab jamun is nice try out in deserts

I along with my parents went there and ordered 1 papri chat ,2 masala dosa ,1 paneer butter masala ,1 nun and 1 masala kulcha. And in desert we ordered 1 kulfi malai. The papri chat is just incredible and delicious. The masala dosa can be better .Kulfi malai tastes good .The nun and masala kulcha needs improvements.Ambience was not up to the mark .The service was quite fast .The staffs are okay .@

This restaurant is located on the busy streets of Shyambazar. Visited it quite a few times after shopping from shyambazar. The ambience isn't something praiseworthy. The tables are clustered together hence the walking space is reduced to something negligible. Hence it looks ugly when crowded. The dosas are kinda okay. Wont pinch your pocket much. The paneer pakoras are my personal favourite.

Its a pure vegetarian restaurant. I absolutely loved the food. Though the restaurant is not very decorated and fancy. Very normal furniture and interior. Average staff running around and just serving food. My rating is just based on the taste of the food they served. The price is very reasonable. If you ever feel like giving vegetarian food a try without spending any extra bucks i promise the tasty food they prepare will not disappoint you . But if you have an eye for ambience ,staff behaviour and all, avoid this place.

A good place for pure vegetarians. The outlet is small and congested  and go there only to fill your stomach with some really tasty veg meal, don't expect any great restaurant like experience and you are fine. NO ONION. The food is good, even a hardcore meat lover like me go back to this place again and again. Try chana bhatura and paneer dosa. Also the beverages and chowmeins are good.

We had chana bhatura and also khulcha chole... Both were good... But the lassi... Ooooooo that was something... I have never had any lassi better than that lassi... Took 60bucks but it was worth it... It was smoothy frothy... Yum yum... Try it people.

I brought paneer masala dosa for tonight's dinner. I liked their packaging only. I did not find much paneer in the dosa. I was turned down by the way they insisted me to but speciaal paneer masala dosa and gave me a totally stupid reason that on my buying so will round off the billing amount. The location is great as it is the shopping hub of North Kolkata. Though I feel only based on dosa rating them is an injustice but still I can of-course change it at any point of time.

I went to this food joint yesterday for a quite bite. Situated in the sidelines of 5 point crossing in shyambazar towards hatibagan. Its an old restaurant with carved designs on the walls. They offer pure vegetarian food.The staff is really courteous and always on their tows while attending the customers. I ordered for a butter masala dosa, kulfi malai and a laddoo. The dosa was great and the masala inside it was full of flavors with a combination of finely chopped tomatoes, coconut, capsicum and mashed potatoes. The chutney wasn't very thin with a perfect consistent and spice. The malai kulfi was not extremely sweet but delightful and quantity was good. The laddoos were just yummy. The food is total value for money and really hygienic. If one is in shyambazar and looking for vegetarian food, they can pay this place a visit. One place for really good south Indian food including Chinese and  Punjabi cuisine.
Food - 3.5/5
Ambiance - 3.5/5
Service - 4/5

A nice vegetarian restaurant in the vicinity of  shyambazaar five point crossing. The outside is modelled as a eatery for quick bite and go... but there is an air conditioned cabin inside where you can have a quiet time with your family.
I have been to this place a couple of times...and i haven't been disappointed. Some of the dishes that i have had here over the years are milk shakes, veg chowmein, dosa, dahi vada.
Give this place a try...it wont disappoint you.

The quality of the food served at Dimpi restaurant is very average and the rates are very high. I have visited many hotels across the city and nowhere have we found this high price for food items. The price is equivalent to star hotels but quality , quantity and service is much inferior along with non AC seating arrangments.
Prices are Inclusive of Tax.
They boast about their lassi(s) but try the Street lassi instead its far better and cheaper.

Review: The TRP is it's "pure veg". We tried the Dimpi special masala dosa, rava masala dosa and sambar vada. One of the finest in this locality I must say. Ambience decent, hygiene good, presentation for. Would surely pay a issue once more for the Chinese.

Dimpi has been at the heart of Shyambazar five point crossing for a long long time now. I remember my sudden kulfi faluda cravings since childhood whenever I used to pass by  this. I visited Dimpi today along with my Maa and Didi after four long years and to my great disappointment this place has lost its shine with time. The food quality has degraded drastically. Be it the Handi biriyani or the Mixed Polao, they were tasteless. The tandoori aloo tikka masala was average, so was the veg Manchurian. Even my good-old- favorite rather famous kulfi faluda of Dimpi was stone hard. With a new eating place popping up every other day at Hatibagan now, Dimpi really need to go back being the way it used to be to survive.

A pretty good authentic Indian veg eatary situated almost near the shyambajar 5 points crossing. In my 2 visits there, I was pretty satisfied with the dosa and roti paneer kofta. The utthapam pleasantly surprised me! The taste was great and the amount quite generous. And all for a good price. The menu is pretty varied, with plenty of items to choose from. Hence for any vegetarians in the area, this is a great option.

Being a regular in the region, have spotted this oldy long ago but never wanted to go in or try. But yesterday we wanted to try vegetarian food. The interior has a very nonKolkata feel to it, a typical north Indian restaurant kinda touch to it. 
People there are very well behaved. Service is decent.
We had tried paneer dosa , mixed utthapam, and chocolate milkshake.
Paneer dosa- the dosa was pretty large, with ample filling and generous amount of grated paneer, the masala tasted really good. Coconut chutney and sambhar served was good as well. 
.
Utthapam- I loved the way they presented the utthapam, totally looked like a pizza. Tasted really good. But heavy and filling. 
It was served with coconut chutney, green chutney ( I fell in love with ) and sambhar
.
Chocolate milkshake- decent that's all I could say, not outstanding but definitely good for the price. 
.
The place is very easy on pocket. I Strongly recommend it to vegetarian people out there.. And I might visit again on some fateful day when I decide to go veg 🍻

A pure veg restaurant is hard to find these days especially in Kolkata providing u mouth watering vegetarian delicacies! Oh but wait! We have dimpi here right at the heart of the city at the five point crossing at shymbazar! Lovely food, pocket friendly n overall a compact fooding destination! The only thing is that the quantity of the food had been reduced a bit from the previous time that i had been there, but there is no change in the taste! A must to visit place if you are looking for some pure veg food destination!

After being a regular customer for over 3-4yrs,the manager humiliated us. Felt really bad. Poor customer service. Never expected this. If u can't cater ur customer properly then don't even dare to raise the price too.Everytime we managed if we were not served properly but today was something else. Such a humiliating behaviour by that old man at the desk......

Very bad customer service and food quality was even worse. They served horrible kasmiri paloou. Didn't at all enjoy. One of the worst restaurant i have ever visited in this area. The manager was so mean. Would never like to visit again. In this area there are far far better resturants easily available.

This is one of the finest South Indian cum punjabi cum veg chinese restaurant in North Kolkata. They serve pure veg foods.I like their butter masala dosa, chola bhatura,mixed paneer,zeera rice,dahi vada,mixed chat,dhokla n special mention is their plain lassi. Its superb, made with pure curd n creamy milk. All these items deserve 10 on 10. They recently have introduced special chinese thali. Veg thali @rs 220 include roti,aloo paratha,2 kinds of sabzi,dal, salad,dahi vada,pulaw n lassi n quantity is enough for 2 persons. So,if you visit shyambazar area,visit this pure veg food joint once,u ll nt b disappointed.

Dimpi is always crowded..coz it serves good food..we had taken a mysore masala dosa which was lacy n nice, Paneer masala dosa was average, but what swept us away off our feet was spring masala dosa..period..had nothing of this sort before..I would highly recommend this special item..to end it we had malai lassi n kesar kulfi.
Hi there..visited it again yesterday..had some amazing dimpi special dosa,paneer dosa, dahi vada,gulab jamun and malai kulfi...no matter what I say is less.. Extremely cordial staff made my day..the most beautiful part was that they treated me with a complimentary baby lassi..too good.. Will keep visiting..

A vegeterian getaway...don't know if its a regular thing, but they serve you a complementary rose flavoured drink in shot glasses...which is actually very refreshing. Couldn't differentiate much among the tastes of different kind of dosas...though the taste was excellent. However, the white chutney needs some working upon. The Baby Corn with Mushroom appetizer thing ain't always available...but do taste if u get hold of a plate. Set up originally as a road side south Indian eatery, this place has a relatively better ambience. Air conditioning can do magic to this place.

I visited this place on dashami evening with two of my juniors who recommended me to try out this place. Firstly I hesitated coz its a pure veg joint. But still I had to go on their recommendation. 

It was almost full on dashami evening but luckily we managed to get a seat. Surprisingly the menu had options from south Indian to north Indian and even Chinese. After much consultation, we ordered a masala dhosa, one fried rice, one chilli paneer and a papri chat. First came the dhosa. It was great. And the chutneys were simply lip smacking !!! It's long since I had tasted such great dhosa!
 
Then came the papri chat. It was not up to the mark. The fried rice tasted good but the chilli paneer was too watery and lacked taste. I have given a 4 rating only for the dhosa. I would recommend only south Indian here.

I am glad that this restaurant has finally made a comeback. 
Since past year,till two months before, my experience here has been very very bad and disgusting. Food had no taste at all and was so dirty.The chapati in thaali were not fully cooked and they mixed chowmin in veg biriyani which tasted horrible. 

BUT NOW,
THEY MADE A BEAUTIFUL COMEBACK.
FOOD IS AWESOME AND TASTY AND POCKET-FRIENDLY.
I AM SO SATISFIED WITH DIMPY AFTER A LONG TIME.
THIS TIME I HOPE IT CONTINUES TO SERVE LIKE THIS.

Good food and budget is my coin of expectation at anywhere. I heard someone talking about Dimpi of Shyambazar and just curiosity took my hungryself there just yesterday. I was hoping to get a dinner far cry from the daily dose i am consuming for some days. This place is a No Onion, No Garlic place. So, ordered crispy baby corn, paneer mirchi and nun. Baby corn was fine with some extra oils which i consumed without a fuss because of its tenderness. Paneer chilli was full of cheese on the top and i didn't like it by its look. However, it tasted fine to my taste as it was light and consumable. Overall a clean and tidy restaurant where you can visit often to try something new from the menu every timw without thinking much on the pocket.
P.S. My husband rang the hanumanji bell as it was clearly mentioned 'ring the bell if you like the food'.

But I warn you, the dosa is too big for a single belly. Don't go for tutty fruity ice cream, because they can't make it.Take coke or lassis, especially mango lassi or lassi with ice cream.Moreover, cheese dosa and dimpi special uttapams are also good.

Initially they used to serve mainly South Indian food but now they serve almost everything in veg. Food quality is not great yet not bad. Here the South Indian food is very good. They provide home delivery facility to a long distance.

Dimpi used to be our place to chill out whenever we went to Shyambazar. We generally used to take special dahi bada and coffee. It suited us. The restaurant is clean and staff on toes. I being a more adventurous one, graduated to masala coke and veg sizzler. Masala coke used to be wonderfully cooling and a good appetiser and the veg sizzler was a revelation. Set on a sizzling stone plate, it contained everything veg - baby corns, tomatoes, potatoes, panirs, noodles - and they tasted heavenly. It was enough for three of us to eat. It was filling and we used to go home happy. 
But yes, the sweets were not kept in hygienic order. I have seen ants moving around them.
Last time we went there was in 2011. After that personal problems cropped up and we did not visit it recently. But after reading the reviews in Zomato, I am appalled. Could the quality of a running restaurant diminish so much? I wonder. Will have to check it out myself.

Yesterday was my first visit to this place. I am from South Kolkata and I happened to visit this place with my best friend who is familiar with the North Kolkata streets. This place is located in the heart of Shyambazar and is divided into two floors. The non ac ground floor and the ac first floor. Surprisingly, though the menu is same for both but the prices for the ac floor is higher. We had a plate of paneer masala dosa and a plate of idly. The food was tasty but since we were seated in the ac section we had to pay more... Apparently Rs. 60 for a plate of idly according to me is not a good option. Any way,  I came to know it is a very popular restaurant over there and I noticed most of the people sitting in non ac ground floor, which I realised is a better option for frequent visitors. Yet again, since it was my first visit and I do not belong from that area I didn't mind the difference much.

An overpriced vegetarian restaurant which is probably the only good veg option in the area. The south and north Indian offerings are better than the rest.

Average veg food at high prices.

 This place used to be a good hangout joint back in my school days. They used to serve very tasty veg food at pocket friendly prices. But with time their quality went down rapidly and prices went up. Now the prices are very high for a veg resturant and ambience is below average.  

 Their south indian items are okay, chinese items are disaster! North Indian and punjabi items are good but costly. Coffee tastes like water. 
Still, this place may be a good option for strictly veg lovers as there are no other veg resturants in that part of north kolkata.

The first time we visited it, this small eating joint, off the Shyambazar crossing, we had ordered dosa and aloo parantha.The dosa was not at all upto the mark.The parantha was dry.On top of that, on asking for a helping of pickles or ketchup to go with the parantha, the waiter simply refused to serve it.According to him, we had to order a dish alongside the parantha.This was downright rude and not at all professional.Hence, I have been propelled to avoid this place once and for all.

Pure veg restaurant situated in the heart of north Kolkata. The place is small, a bit messy also. But I can assure about the food quality. They serve fresh and tasty food.
I like Dahi Vada the most. Apart from this, they provide a large no. of menu which contains South Indian, Chinese as well as North Indian food.
You will like the Dahi Vada/Mixed Chaat, Veg Chowmin with Manchurian, Butter Naan with Panner Butter Masala/Navaratan Korma/Kadai Paneer/Kashmiri Aloo Dam, Butter Onion Dosa, Pav Bhaji, Kulfi and many more.
According to me, the rating is :
Food Quaity : 4 out of 5

Home to very tasty pure veg food, located in the heart of North Kolkata- just off Shyambazar 5 point crossing. Have been visiting this place since I was a kid. From dosas to chaat to cold coffee, they have a host of options on their menu. However, the place is dimly lit and may appear to be a bit stuffy in summers. The dessert menu isn't that great. However, it is a pretty pocket-friendly place.

Dimpy is located in the heart of Shyambazar...the most congested part of the area...so it attracts huge crowds in the form of shoppers and even college students.
They serve Veg only. The quality of food is not that great but you cant get too expecting at such a price level and in an area that's not known for multi-cuisine restros.
However, considering the quality, I still feel that the pocket pinch is a little on the higher side. Probably Dimpy is banking on its apt location where after a day of shopping they are willing to pay a little more than usual.

I have been a regular in Dimpi specially as they offer veg food without onion and garlic...though they are multi cuisine but the north Indian is best offered by them...my recommendation are garam tawa (sort of veg sizzler), pneer butter, mix veg, palak paneer. The papri chat is awesome as well as the kulfi...they also serve pocket friendly Chinese combos which are not bad keeping in mind they don't put onion and garlic...the staff is also very hospitable... Only thing I have noticed over the year that the interiors becoming bad ...

The food here is in between average to mixed, service is not bad at all but not fast unlike some others and the price is reasonable. And lastly, one thing that I found worth spending my money is the Kulfi available their, its really good. Good Luck.

Well, its a ok ok type restaurant. Dahi vada nd wada pao is low standard, even a normal fuchkawala makes better than them. The cheese butter dosa is really good and if i again visit this place again, that will be definately for the kulfi. Fyi: they charge higher than the food quality as well as the quantity.

The Description: 1st of all place is at the most conjusted area "Shyambazar".thirdly its Pure Veg so its definitely not in my wishlist always as m a hardcore non veg lover. 

The Ambience:  You will find this place so dark from outside. It has been very old resto there serving pure veg food to people. Seating arrangement is quite decent.

The Food: They got variety but the taste is just eating like a dish without taste. Dahi vada is good.

The Conclusion: Mainly u will find ladies and kids at this outlet..
Food is not that average according to me don't know what other feels. Prices are reasonable thats a plus..

Note: The review is based on my personal visit and experience to this place.

Good place for a vegetarian. It has been a long time I tried this place. Time when I did not really mind going out for dining and having vegetarian - now I prefer both and mainly non-veg :-) Remember having gravy veg noodles. Location is too good and that's what it makes a happening place. Lots of people cross that place and visit the place for quick snacks.

For a very busy place like Shyambazar five point crossing this place is perfect for a quick completely Veg snack. I regularly visit Dimpi to enjoy quality vegetarian food. Their Cheese Paratha is marvelous along with the sides like palak paneer,paneer tikka masala,dal makhani. Also I like their dosas especially I just love the tangy taste of their special Spring Masala Dosa, i would recommend anyone to try their spring masala dosa it tastes delicious.

Okay, the thing with dimpi is very simple. You just simply don't go there and start experimenting with the food. The only way to survive in dimpi is to order South Indian food. I was feeling too adventurous when I ordered hakka noodles with chilli paneer there. It was plain bad. Don't ever try it there. But again, the South Indian food is actually good and can be given a try. Enjoy!

I m a regular visitor of this renowned restaurant of north kolkata, if not wrong, for almost 15yrs n more. So i have a weakness for the restaurant. All the staffs r known to me n my family. In such an over crowded place in shyambazar, this restaurant gives me a bit of solace. My favourite items include masala dosa, combo fried rice, combo hakka noodles,  dahi vada(deteriorated in taste in last few yrs), papri chat, paneer items like butter paneer masala sahi paneer, malai kofta, paw vaji with chole bhatore. So if u r veg freak, should turn up to this place for at least once. 
Thanks.

Dimpi is a very normal resturant. I had cheese dhosa there. Taste of food is not that much wowy. Average tasting food. Serving is a bit delayed. But the taste of the south indian items are good. Chowmeins are also good in taste. As it is located in the shyambazar 5 point, it  the only cheap eating place in that surrounding.

One of the best vegetarian restaurants in north kolkata located the five point crossing      in ur way towards shyambazar tram dipo..i visited this place with my family...it is a small redtaurant with minimum decor but serves u some awesomeee veg items...
I havent tasted much of their items..we ordered for cheese masala dosa,butter sada dosa,masala uttapam, my aunt ordered for a lunch thali which had parantha,roti,polao,dahi vada ,sweets etc and each and evry item was soooo tasty and made with great care..i love their dahi vada it is mind blowing and whwnever i go i  would never come out without their dahi vada u can neva get such awesomely made dahi vadas newhre in town..
Being a hardcore non vegetarian...am a fan of this place coz it serves some awesome veg food and in a reasonable price..it js pocket friendly and a well maintained place..
I would go back there for their dahi vada and dosa...^_^

Located in shyambazar area, the place serves only vegetarian food including north indian, south indian, chinese cuisines which makes the menu pretty comprehensive. The restaurant is small, congested. The decor is nothing great either. Seats are comfortable enough. Staff are polite and service is reasonably fast. 

The food quantity is generous and the prices very reasonable but i am not so fond of their food. The food is on the oily side or rather extremely oily. The south indian food is decent and only face saver. The north indian food is a disaster in my opinion being very oily and taste is below average. The dosas are well made but i do not love their chutney, sambhar so much. I have not tried their chinese food yet so cant comment. Overall, the place disappoints !!!!

Dimpi is really great for veggie eaters, and also really awesome for non veg people to feel a change in their tounge and tummy. Yummy food, reasonable price and good position- these are the main USP of Dimpi. As a north Kolkatan I always prefer this place for quick refuel after hectic shopping at Hatibagan-Shyambazar area. Chaat, South Indian, are must have.

Dimpi is good, only because it's in Shyambazar, the place with the least number of decent restaurants in town.. This is not exactly a full-fledged restaurant.. A rather small joint, divided into AC and Non-AC section, they serve nice vegetarian dishes.. 

If you decide to visit this place, keep your eyes open, as the hawkers and their array of bed sheets could block it.. But once you do enter, sit in the AC section.. It's much more comfortable.. 

Now food.. They make good Dosas,.. In fact, every time my mom goes there, she orders nothing but a dosa.. I personally love their Papri Chaat n Dahi Vada.. The curd they use is cold and yum.. You could order a glass of lassi in the meantime, and the hot Gulab Jamun for dessert..

Easy on pocket, this place could be worth a vist if you're at Shyam Bazar and want a change of taste from the hot curries of Golbari.. :)

This is a very humble place in Shayambazar which is famous for its 100% veg tag. If you don't know where this is, chances are you would miss it behind all those hawkers in the pavement. The place is divided into an Ac and a Non-AC part. The Non-AC part is not worth seating as the heat of the road blows directly into your face as there is no gate or front walls! Seating in the Ac is the only option if you ask me. The insides are very dim so much so that sometimes you would find it difficult to see what you are eating! A bit more light can do wonders for the ambiance!
The food is very standard and tasty though nothing spectacular and the menu is also extremely common. Also, it is a tad pricey comparing the portions of food.
But if you are a "Sudha Sakahari" then this is your place as they truly serve 100% vegetarian food.

Despite....being a hardcore non-vegetarian.....I  go to Dimpi....because of its wide range of vegetarian treats. I recommend this for those people who think that good food can be prepared only with non-veg item. I have never found any vegetarian retaurant as good as this one. The foods are garnished and served well. The people inside are hygienic and very helpful, too. Price as you can see, is pocket-friendly. The hotel is located at most coveted place. Please, have some good vegetarian treat at this place...this is probably the one of its kind!!
