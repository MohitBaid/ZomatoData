You'll definitely find a hidden gem out of this place.
Located near Banik More ,Birati.This place not only give you some good cozy ambience along with some good food it also serve.
We ordered for Blue Lagoon,Lovebird as the refreshment drink.Both were good but could have been better.
We ordered for Chicken momo which was great.Never expected such experience out of this newly junction.The steamed momo was filled enough with chicken fillings and served with hot soup and momo sezuan sauce.
We ordered for Prawn Tandoori which was amazing.The size of the Prawn and the presentation was quite well.The size was too large and fresh and this dudh is a one must recommend dish out of this place that serve.They also give out options for preordering for Prawn items which is a new concept so that they can serve you with the fresh pieces.Just give a try to these prawn pieces.
Next we ordered for Stuffed Masala kulcha and Mutton Rogan josh.The stuffed khocha was the most amazing one as it tastes and one of the best khocha i had till date.
The mutton tasted well with the kulcha and Mutton pieces were four in numbered and cooked well.This two Dishses are also RECOMMENDED .
We ended up with Having Fried Ice cream .Which was also one of the best. ❤

Had a wonderful experience from one othe best place in Birati.

1.Ajwaini Fish Tikka
2.Tandoori Prawn
3.Blue Lagoon
4.Masala Kulcha
5.Mutton Rohan Josh
6.Chicken Momo
7.Fried Ice cream

Starting up with the freshly refreshment juice this serves for some good mocktails. Tastes good and the mixture aas great with the Blue lagoon syrup.A great Refreshment.

Next came the starters which includes some freshly fish ajwaini tikka.The fish was fresh and well cooked and baked. This seemed out something out of box.

The tandoori prawn was something that was n

Masala Kulcha and Mutton Rohan Josh was something that just goes appropriate with each other.Masala Kulcha is well stuffed and the masala was good in quantity stuffed inside the bread and the thickness was too good of the Kulcha.Mutton tastes amazing with this Kulcha. The Richness of the food and the mutton was Cooked well.

Lastly came the dessert the fried Ice cream.Its was too good to end up with a good tone :)

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION:
Staying in North Kolkata and specially near Airport or Birati Area? Looking for some fine food with some decent ambiance and a pure family restaurant? Well your search ends here as B Square is opened here at Banik More, Birati. Rest of kolkata have been filled with some outstanding places and most of the crowd drag their way to this side of the city to find better kind of eateries. But some hidden gems dont make a shoutout for themselves and silently they create name for themselves and B Square is from one of them. 

AMBIANCE AND SERVICE: Not a very huge setup but still they will manage to accommodate around 30 people at one shot. With the soft sofa and wooden tables the vivid paints as well as lightings give a different texture to the place. Service is prompt and the men were up on their feets and professional.

FOOD AND DRINKS:

1.  Blue Lagoon : One of my Favorite drinks and i am very watchful about this drink. Nothing went wrong from the fizzyness till the taste. Pretty satisfied and Recommended.

2. Ajwaini Fish Tikka : Golden looking tikka looked and shaped like chicken kabab but the mystery broke when the fork did it work. It was soft and juicy fish with perfect marination and balanced flavour.

3. Chicken Momo : It is very difficult to make a perfect momo and everything has to be perfectly ok. Filling was extremely well done but the coating needed to be a little thin.

4. Chicken Makhani : Flavorful and tasty gravy. Thick and full of spices. Meaty chicken full of softness.

5. Masala Kulcha : One of the better masala kulcha i had in this recent time. stuffing was very good and complemented the chicken very well.

The food experience to this newly opened place has been a memorable one with the kind of food they are serving with such affordable prices. Prices are inclusive of taxes.

B Square is located five mins walking distance from Birati Railway Station.The ambience is pleasant.
Ajwaini Fish Tikka was an awesome dish to start with.Chicken momos were enjoyable too.Tandoori Prawn was satisfactory in taste.One can also try the Chicken Hariyali Kabab and Mutton Sikh Kabab.

In mocktails,Virgin Mojito was average in taste,Blue Lagoon was refreshing but Lovebird is the true winner among them,highly recommended of them.

They used to serve decent chinese dishes.Mixed Fried Rice was terrific in taste with the Lemon Chicken,the chicken was mouthwatering,both are recommended one.

In Indian dishes we have tried the Kulcha with Chicken Makhani and Mutton Rogan Josh,Kulcha was brilliant and again the Chicken was amazing with it.Mutton could be better.
Fried Ice Cream was wonderful at the end.

This a small restaurant located in Birati just at the Banik More. Even though the restaurant is small in size, their food surely packs a punch. The interiors are pretty decent.

The best items on the menu are the chicken hariyali kebab, mutton seekh kebab and chicken tikka masala. You can also try the fried ice cream.

Special mention: The masala kulcha is one of the better ones I've ever had.

Our first experience with b square is not so good.We ordered chicken bharta, chicken tikka masala with kashmiri pulao and butter naan. They delivered the order within 30mins.which is good. But the quality of food is not that good.The pulao was not at all freshly done. It was like some previous left over, smelly, spoiled and cold rice. Chickens were good, naan was perfect. Disappointed with B square.

A newly opened restaurant in the heart of Birati near Banik More. I visited this place a week back for taking parcel. The ambience and decor are nice and modern. The Mocktail counter is eye grabbing (though haven't tried any yet). The staffs are courteous. I gave the rating as 3 based on the dishes I tried. i.e
1. Jeera Rice
2. Paneer Butter Masala
3. Kadai Chicken
Personally I found the dishes to be a little bit more rich, oily and spicy. Will try to avoid these Indian dishes in my next visit as it could have been better.
