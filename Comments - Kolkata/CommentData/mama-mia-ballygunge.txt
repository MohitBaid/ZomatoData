You can simply drop by this place when you are having a sweet craving. They serve variety of deserts. The place looks pretty and the staff is extremely friendly and cordial. 
Recently, I tried their German black forest sundae which was nice and I loved their New creation "Death by chocolate". It has loads of chocolate in it starting from chocolate ice cream to brownie, Choco chips and cream. The only disappointment I had was with their brownie. It crumbled when I used the spoon rather than getting softly cut. 
The ice cream flavours are nice. 
Foosball is also a reason for loving this place. 
Overall, this is my go to place for deserts (especially coz I live nearby).

The presentation is also impressive. Perfect place to hangout with friends. Mama Mia made my day. I would definitely go again to try out the other items too. Highly recommended:)

Located in 59, Ballygunge Circular Road, Ballygunge, Kolkata.¬†

In first look anyone thinks this is a normal ice cream parlor like others. But when you get in the parlor then you will feel the difference as first of all they will not pressures you to take the ice cream from there menu. But you can firstly taste the available flavors and then you can choose the flavor of your choice which you found best. This option was quite good and different. This outlet has a good seating capacity and they also has a Foosball table.

So visit the parlor and enjoy the taste with your loved ones either in the parlor having space for sitting or take the delicious ice cream at home.
                    

1) Skillet Nutella Mudpie
2) The Hot Chocolate (Sea Salt)¬†
3) Nutella Trilogy Sundae
4) Rocky Road Sundae
5) Flamed pineapple and cherries Sundae
6) Fresh Strawberry Sundae
                    

They are extremely delicious! They had several flavors of ice cream, including fruits,chocolate etc. so I was very excited to try their ice-cream and I was not disappointed. try their charcoal with mint and red velvet. They are awesome. The staff was very friendly and very helpful.

This is definitely one of the best dessert parlours hands down in the city. 

From a vibrant and cheerful Ambience along with a quirky and well decorated interior this place is bound to give you the positive vibes. 

The service is humble and prompt and the hospitality was commendable. 

We were lucky enough to be the first ones to try their new menu and the experience was literally sweet and one worth remembering. 

Summed up as follows:
-- Skillet Nutella mud pie - this particular dessert was amazing in the sense that the presentation was visually attractive and the quantity was unparallelled,  the taste wasn't compromised either and overall it was a complete package.

-- the hot chocolate sea salt -- the artistic skills involved in this dish was simply amazing and the presentation was unparalleled I really loved the taste of the hot chocolate and it was impeccable. 

-- Nutella trilogy Sunday -- delicious in terms of taste amazing and artistic in terms of presentation and appearance and visually quite attractive, the quantity was a lot a lot to take in actually so it is more than enough for two to three persons 

-- Fries- in the middle of ordering so many desserts we decided to order in some fries to change the course of our taste buds so we had the Peri Peri fries and the normal smiley faced aloo tikki fries and both of them were really nice. 

-- fresh strawberry sundae -- the decoration and the beauty of this particular dessert dish was impeccable and unparalleled.  I was completely astounded and astonished by the grandeur of this dish. It looked so amazing visually. In terms of Taste also I found it at a very competitive level and it was really  refreshing and loaded with lots of strawberries. This is the ultimate dessert dish which you should order if you are over here. 
-- Rocky road sundae-- Highly recommend in terms of quality and quantity. 

-- Flamed pineapple and cherry sundae-- i was highly impressed with the presentation and decoration. 

This place is truly a paradise for dessert lovers! Cheer's to this place!

Soo it was an unplanned trip to this place.. we're just passing by and saw this place and decided to try some gelatos. This place is a bit expensive not too much ..but yes. As gelatos were something very new for us , so we had to try. We tried berry gelato and it was good. We also had a chocolate mousse and it was super yummy and a must try. Fries were well fried and one of the dips we chose was super tasty. It was overall a nice experience for us.

Perfect place to satisfy your dessert cravings. Went there to try out some of their delicacies. Each and every dish i tried were outstanding. Everything was just absolutely droolworthy. They were
‚Ä¢Skillet Nutella Mudpie: this was just out of the world. Goey mudpie with nutella spread and bananas and nuts with a dollop of ice cream. Sinfully delicious. Highly Recommended
‚Ä¢SeaSalt Hot Chocolate: the best hot chocolate drink i 've had till date. Its rich,thick and smooth. Just beautiful. Highly Recommended
‚Ä¢Nutella Trilogy Sundae: you get to see the layers of ice cream and nutella. Just yummmm.
‚Ä¢Rocky Road Sundae: a droolworthy dish. You get the sweetness from the goey chocolatey cake/brownie, the smoothness and coldness from the icr cream and the praline gives it a rocky and crunchy texture. Highly Recommended. 
‚Ä¢Flamed Pineapple and Cherries Sundae: though i am not a pineapple lover but this dish made me go 'wow'. The dish was just perfectly balanced. 
‚Ä¢Fresh Strawberry Sundae: another beautiful dish. You get the freshness from the strawberries and then the cool note of the ice cream.
‚Ä¢Peri Peri Fries: they also have fries as well. Tried the peri peri ones. They were crunchy and tasted good. Indeed a nice idea to have fries in order relieve yourself a bit from all those sweetness and then again order another dessert.
I absolutely loved the place. Indeed a perfect place to hang up with friends, family or a date over some delicious desserts.

Fries amidst Sundaes was like bliss to us! They came with mayo dip n tomato ketchup. It was crispy and yummy!

Went especially to try their well known Vanilla Stardust which one can get only in Mama Mia outlets in Kolkata. It's good in taste and looks charcoal black in colour. You can go for a black cone which will make your ice cream look fancy.
I also tried their Sizzling Brownie which was okay but not great in taste. I expected it to be better. The ambience is nice and the place is cozy. Service is very prompt. Recommended for every ice cream lovers as you can get a wide variety of delicious flavors. Though a bit overpriced, i think. Would love to visit again to try the other flavours. 
So, go get a scoop of ice cream there and feel what real love tastes like.

This is heaven for Chocolate lover.I don't mind getting fat fat and fatter after eating ice cream here.
This is my regular place to visit if I am sad,happy,angry or any emotion where I crave for chocolate.
Tried almost all the sundae Ferraro Rocher being my favorite!!
The sofas are too cozy to sit and have the sundaes and the quote on napkin: " Life's too short to not eat" encourages you to stop thinking about the calorie intake.
Yet if you feel guilty:
Time to feel good that they serve 96% sugar free ice cream.
Cant get enough of it!!

"Black vanilla icecream"- such an attractive stuff for the soul who loves black... I went mama mia only because of black vanilla icecream/stardust icecream.. but I was really disappointed after having it.. It tastes horrible... was like I'm having powdered charcoal..

Anyway I'm in love with their french fries..

Sizzling brownies, pastry ( i forget the name) & oreo concretti (shake) were good

Then it comes to sundae-(from left to right)
1- twilight cookies- my friend found it ok..bt I didn't like it.. so much of mint like a chlormint
2- Ferrero rocher rocker sundae- it was nice..
3- Italian tutti frutti- it's awesome.. A must try..

After a bad day we were craving for some desert. So we decided to barge into a uce cream parlour. We ordered italian tutti frutti and cafe mocha biscotti. As usual mama mia never disappoints.

We went here late night for ice creams.They have lots of variety to select from.Fancy ice cream with extra toppings,price wise worth it.Though the service was a little slow at night.

The desserts were not overpoweringly sweet and hence one could actually enjoy the flavour of the ingredients used. 
The blueberry coolie is delicious 
The presentation is good 
This place only has hot chocolate as a hot beverage.. I wish there was more variety ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüå∏ü¶ãü¶Ñ rest was love

I've been a regular at Mama Mia New Alipore, however ended up going to the Ballygunge outlet last night. Was really disappointed by the quality of the ice creams as well as the attitude of the staff. The ice cream seemed melted as well and the Belgian chocolate definitely was not the same. Hope this was a one off day for them!

Mama Mia is a place where anyone can satisfy their dessert cravings.They have a wide range of icecreams,concrettis and cakes !! 

We ordered fererro rocher rocker sundae and slurpy brownie concretti. Words would be less to explain the delight and joy in every bite of the ice cream and each sip of the concretti !!

The place also has a foosball table !!

Mama Mia is the best ice cream parlour in town! The ballygunge outlet is a nice small one having a convenient location!

CHOCOLATE DIABLO: An ice cream having a rich chocolatey flavour and a smooth consistency. A safe bet for chocolate flavour lovers.

APPLE CRUMBLE GELATO: An experimental pick that paid off! One can smell the aroma of cinnamon before biting into the grainy apple crumble. It's a complete reminder of a standard apple pie sans the pie.
Highly recommended!

Thank you Mama Mia for being a complete treat to us ice cream lovers!

The muffins are also good. But strongly recommended for having a scoop of gelato ice creams.
The ferrero rocher is another must have

Had at the Mama Mia in inox, quest mall. Very dissapointed. 
The server just scooped half a scoop of ice cream and over it he placed another half scoop of ice cream after which he asked me which size I wanted to order. I said 1 scoop that he had served was enough. But he claimed he had filled that tiny little cup with 2 scoops of ice cream. Anyone with little common sense and who has ice cream at parlours will know that such a tiny cup that mama Mia had, can barely fit 1 scoop, forget 2 scoops.
He then insisted that he served 2 scoops as 1 scoop is too tiny to have! 
We did not want to create a scene so we simply paid  180 for 2 scoops( according to the server) and left.
Definitely not having at mama Mia again to get myself cheated.
Anyone going there, make sure you do not get cheated by the servers as we did.

Mama mia! makes delicious ice cream cakes. I have had them over the years, usually at birthday parties. When ordered at the outlet, the slices are too cold and hard and need to be thawed for a good 15 minutes before consuming. 
The sundaes and cones are top notch though. Board games and a foosball table make this place a laid back hangout zone.

From sundaes to gelato cakes Mama Mia simply tops it's genre. If you are in for a sundae they do try the black forest sundae and tutty fruity sundae.
Also the seasonal Nolen Gur sundae is still on the menu which is simply out of the world.
Grab it while you still gave the chance.
PS: Do try out the mousses.

A lot can happen over such gorgeous sundae(s).
This place is situated on Ballygunge Circular Road beside Saptoporni Apartment.
Mama mia has been always been famous for their ice creams and cakes and recently i have tried two sundaes : Strawberry & Chocolate duet Sundae and Ferrero Rocher Rocker Sundae and both of them look gorgeous and taste surreal!
The decor is very comfortable with big sofas and small tables. They also have a Foosball corner which always attract me and reminds of FRIENDS where Chandler and Joey used to play the game almost everyday!
The service is good. Perfect place to hang out with your pals on a lazy afternoon.

The place is wonderful and serves the best gelatos and wonderful sundaes. I recently tried their Seasonal Limited Edition Nolan Gur gelato. It tasted brilliant and the rich creamy texture elevates it to a different  level altogether. It also has chunks of sweet inside which adds another layer of taste and texture to it. Do try it and you will surely love it to the fullest. Overall a great experience.

My Ratings of 4.5 because of their high quality offerings & courteous staff!
Mamamia has always been a place to enjoy delectable gelatos, especially loved by my kids! A cosy ambiance, good lighting & a fussball to play! One of my favourite is the Italian Tutti Fruity Sundae with its colourful presentation & awesome taste!
Mamamia is offering in store a Nolen Gur (Date Palm jaggery) Gelato - A Seasonal Limited Edition Collection! 100% natural, low fat & zero trans-fat! Includes pieces of @sandesh from a legendary sweet shop and it enhanced the overall taste! Available in 500ml Tub for limited period! My honest review - It tasted awesome! Especially with the pieces of Sandesh in it! Give it a try at any of their outlets.

P. S. Thank you @mamamiaindia & @zomatoin for sending the gift pack to taste! #kolkatavegfoodwalk #goodvegfood #vegetarian #icecream #mamamia #zomatoin #nomnom

This place is a favourite for anyone who likes deserts. Ice creams, sundaes , sorbets , cakes, and fusion milk shakes, this place has it all. 

This was my 2nd visit to this place and I was equally happy with the food and service, the place has a very lively ambience, good decor and friendly staff. 

We had ordered the Coffee Chocolate Biscotti Sundae and it was a delight, you had the crunchy ness of the wafers and the bittersweet combination of coffee and chocolate icecream . Sinful as it is , it was also a great item for any desert lover. 

The ice creams and sorbets are a must try too, they have a great variety of flavours. Till next time . 
Cheers

Located in the peaceful lanes of ballygunge circular road its suggested to use google map.
There can't be any preference for any flavours but German Black Forest Sundae & Italian Tutti Fruity is recommended.
They serve you with very affordable stuffs and minimalistic decor.

These people need to be educated about Zomato and how it works! A rather insulting and humiliating experience a few days back left me shocked with disdain. I was prohibited from clicking pictures. Specially if they had their menu visible in the background! When I showed them similar pictures that had already been uploaded on their Zomato page , the ignorant person at the counter said that they were uploaded by their 'DIRECTOR'. I tried my best to explain what Zomato is and why I was taking the pictures.. Nothing worked..
People like these trying to act smart for no rhyme or reason bring down the name of a place! It's a shame! Never expected such pathetic treatment at a well known destination for foodies in this part of the city!

Those who know me personally would very well remember a time when I used to suggest mama mia for every single outing and my day just wouldn't end without a cup of the belgian chocolate. Recently Mama mia renovated and the store looks even better now.

The ice cream range has increased and I absolutely love the black label chocolate ice cream I had on my last visit, hope that one sticks around! :DFor photos of places where I eat in Calcutta or other cities, follow me on Instagram. (Same name in both places)

This is one of my favorite place for hanging out with buddies over sundaes.I end up trying the chocolate based sundaes like Ferrero Rocher Rocker,Nutty muddy,Death by chocolate.All these are their signature sundaes and are too good.Every yr after the adda session at Maddox sq during Durga Puja me and my friends drop by this place away from the hustle bustle and chill over some decandent sundaes.

Recently they have collaborated with Kaos.So I randomly dropped by this place few days back to try some gourmet brownies with Mama Mia's gelato.Combined the nutella brownie with a vanilla flavoured gelato(French Vanilla Ancanto). The warm gooey brownie and the smooth vanilla gelato..a classic combination that doesn't usually go wrong.Here it was heavenly as both the components in the dish were of premium class.Its a perfect comfort dessert for any time.Will surely drop by very soon..for the sundaes or mixing up the best of gelato,brownie and cookies.

A beautifully decorated cozy ice cream parlour located in ballygunge circular road... really liked the interiors... it is an appropriate place to chill out with ur friends over cups of mouth watering sundaes.. after listening a lot about them, thought of trying my hands out on their sundaes... we ordered one german black forest sundae... the sandae was beautifully decorated with loads of topping.. we took it in a regular size.. it was extremely delicious.. but i was very much disappointed with their quantity.. previously i had regular sized sundaes from various reputated ice cream parlors.. but was really disappointed with them.. it all looked amazing from outside.. but after a few spoons of ice cream, the inside of it is completely nothing.. the first layer is loaded with toppings, the second layer was quite blank and below that there was just a little bit of crushed brownies with minimum ice cream... As i was expecting much from them.. It was disappointing and not worth the money..

I went to Mama Mia with my mother after shopping in Nalli. This outlet of Mama Mia is situtated opposite to Nalli saree shop. My mother abstains from ice-cream as she is not much fond of it. I ordered one CHOCOHOLIC SUNDAE for myself.

CHOCOHOLIC has vanilla & chocolate ice-cream with choco chips, cream, crushed almonds and topped with liquid chocolate fudge. 
My mother couldn't restrain herself from indulging in it and just loved it. 

Those who have yet not been to Mama Mia, please visit it as soon as possible. I promise you would not regret it.

                There's nothing better than gelato and there's nowhere better to get it than Mama Mia! I've always enjoyed their gelato in the waffle cones. Recently I tried their Ferrero Rocher ice cream cake which was both delicious and reasonably priced for its size. Truly lit up my friends day and is a perfect substitute for just a regular cake.

Summer is around the corner and if you Mamamia is the best place to visit for sinful sundaes! The Ferrero Rocher sundae is nothing short of magical. Also love their new addition of fries to the menu - a great starter to the sundaes. We tried the piri piri fries with habanero sauce on the side - delicious!

Mama Mia! Fantastica. Eccelente. These are the words that come into mind when I sit down to think about Mama Mia! Located at Ballygunge, this joint produces the best gelato in town, needless to say. Not only does it sell its customers ice cream that are of high quality but the variations in flavour and the new, unique gelato that it brings to the table are worth praising for.

*Kesar Pista Royale: Luxuriously smooth in texture and heavily flavoured with saffron and pistachios makes Kesar Pista Royale a popular choice for people who agree to try strictly familiar flavours. (3.5/5)

*Belgian Dark Chocolate: Large swirls of solidified chocolate hidden inside silky, smooth chocolate gelato. Rich in flavour and a great choice for children and even adults. (4.5/5)

*Blackcurrent Connection: Beautiful black currants blenched with milk and cream to get that creamy texture. I personally liked this more than the above two gelatos. (4.5/5)

*Pink Guava: Although pink in colour, once in your mouth it's almost like a puzzle. It's guava and not your regular pink coloured strawberry ice cream. An interesting choice, and a more interesting tasting session. Tasty and is a definite hit among people. (4.5/5)

I am sure this establishment has been the reliable drop in place for numerous Gelato cravers in the southern part of the city. It has seen endless adda sessions at the end of school hours and also a number of tired feet dropping in during pujas to give the aching limbs some rest and for the taste of their much loved gelatos.¬†
If not you, I have been guilty of doing all the above and have hence, enjoyed every visit.

Over my last visit, I had all the luck to pamper my taste buds with some of the house specials, other than my regular cookie & cream and Belgian chocolate. I tried the black currant, kesar-pista, pink guava, BDC Dark Chocolate and finally the star, of the show the cafe creme Columbiana. All the gelatos proved to be textural delights, as always. While the pink guava had a fresh fruity note to it and is absolutely refreshing, the BDC dark chocolate is rich and chocolaty, enriched with sumptuous brownie bits.¬†

The Cafe Creme Columbiana is a bombshell in its own right, producing little explosion with every second spoon full. Filled with crushed coffee nibbles, the Cafe Creme Columbiana is stronger than your morning espresso. If you love your coffee, you cannot afford to miss this. Take a tub of this back home and sandwich it between two sweet buns, pour some chocolate sauce and crushed oreos on top and bite into it as soon as you can. I am salivating right at this moment, thinking about it.

You can also shake things up with the Blueberry Cheesecake Concretti and the Strawberry Concretti.

Conveniently location near Ballygunge Circular Road, Mamma Mia is a delight for dessert lovers such as myself. More than the ice creams I'm fond of their wide range of cakes and pastries. The chocolate fudge tart and their Chocolate Overload are my personal favourites. The ambience is great with mostly young groups of friends having a nice time. There is foosball table to keep you engaged while you wait for your mouthwatering desserts.

You scream, I scream, we all scream for ice cream. Hell yeah - if there's anything in the world that can fix your life, that would be chocolates and ice cream. And when those two are fused together in the most delightful of ways - you can conquer the world baby. Therfore, missing this place will be considered a cardinal sin. Yes! They are that good!!!

Situated near Ballygunge Circular Road, had dropped in once. When it comes to Gelatos, Mama Mia happens to be one of the favorites, and right so. Their flavors are unique and gives you that unique comofortness. I had dropped here once and tried the Bavarian Chocolate. Who does not like Dark Chocolate? But these guys have taken them to a whole new level. Personally, I love the Bavarian by Mama Mia more than the one made by Baskin n Robbins. The pricing is definitely on the higher side but as they say, good quality products come at a higher price.!

Must have spent half my life here. Mama Mia is a delightful joint , located strategically on Ballygunge Circular Road. Wonderful cakes , ice-creams and pastries, my eternal favourite are the melt-in-the-mouth truffles that are served here. Seating arrangements are good. Also , the added benefit of a Foosball table makes it the perfect place to chill with a group of friends in the evening :)

Now a days, my sweet tooth craving is at its zenith and here I was exploring my taste buds. Though I find the place a bit difficult to locate but it's a very delightful and spacious dessert parlour. There's a foosball table at its very entrance which is very amusing. I must mention the way they have designed their menu book, it looked so vibrant and colourful. Now, lets come to the sundaes we had :

#Italian Tutty Fruity - This is there signature special sundae. It was fully filled with chunks of ¬†juicy and fresh fruits which tasted divine. This is truly a glass of heaven in a lazy summer afternoon.¬†

#Blueberry from very berry fields - It looked very tempting but a few more spoons of blueberry coulis could have done the magic. Though the shortbread cookies at the top and vanilla gelato was quite a pleasure to have.

Pocket pinch was slightly on the higher side but tolerable keeping in mind those mouth-watering ice-creams. A must must visit !!

An awesome experience of tasting delicious ice creams. This place is near from my university and I have bookmarked it a long time ago. Today finally got a chance to visit there and this visit is worth mentioning. Nice and comfortable seating arrangements as well as the ambiance is very impressive. We have chosen two signature sundaes from their menu. Nutty butterscotch and Italian tutti fruity. Both the ice creams are equally delicious. The tutti frutti was served with several pieces of delicious fruits along with vanilla and strawberry flavored ice cream. It just tasted awesome in every spoon from first till the last. The nutty butterscotch was superb in taste with almonds, dry nuts in it. Just loved today's ice cream session and definitely coming back soon to relish other flavors. üòã

Late night cravings for ice cream. We decided to go to Mama Mia! for some late night gelato. 
We entered after their closing time, still they were polite enough to take our last order. Not delaying much we ordered a few scoops and all of them were served in waffle cones.
We chose Irish coffee, Belgian Chocolate ( they are known for this), Almond something and French Vanilla.
All the ice creams were amazing, creamy and smooth. There were no ice crystals which destroy the ice cream's smoothness. In my opinion these were some of the best gelatos i have ever had.

This place is must recommended and though everyone prefers the Belgian Chocolate, i personally thought Almond one was better.

This is our favourite desserts parlour but we had the fortune of visiting this place after 10 (Yes ‚Äì TEN) long years as it is quite far away from my place. The outlet is conveniently situated near St. Lawrence High School, Ballygunje Circular Road ‚Äì of which I used to be a student till 2005. Ambience of the place is quite cosy and comfortable ‚Äì perhaps, 1 of the best in Kolkata. The environment is very soothing, temperature maintained to optimization and comfortable seating arrangements. Mind you! that this is a self-service styled outlet. We saw their Foosball table as soon as we entered, which can only be played after depositing Rs. 200 (Fully Refundable). A couple of other games were also available- which are suitable for children. We had Alphonso Mango Magic scoop which was superb ‚Äì real alphonso flavoured with distinct mango pieces. The ‚ÄúWhy So Blue Berry‚Äù scoop (i.e. Black Currant) was fine ‚Äì nothing great. Kitkat ice cream (Chocolate containing kitkat pieces) was also good, but pick of the scoops was the Fudge Brownie ‚Äì just out of the world. It had decent bits of brownie with just the appropriate sugar and chocolate content ‚Äì an almost perfect scoop. We also bought their Chocoholic sundae which was superb ‚Äì a scoop of vanilla, a scoop of Belgian dark chocolate served with chocolate sauce, almonds etc, whipped cream and a choco pipe roll. I believe that chocolate sauce content was quite high ‚Äì but, still, this Sundae just made our Sunday (Lol)! We also had their Chocochip muffin for takeaway.

Nice to see that they also have a sugar-free ice cream and a decent variety of pastries (both egg and eggless) as well as shakes and sundaes.

Service and behaviour is nice ‚Äì only drawback at this place is the exorbitant charges ‚Äì which defer or limit your frequent visits.

P.S. ‚Äì all the items mentioned above cost us Rs. 900/-

I really really enjoy their ice creams and sundaes. It's really creamy and has a variety of flavours. We had the caf√® mocha biscotti which was blissful , with a scoop of Irish creme and chocolate with a thick chocolate syrup topped with biscuit halves . The next thing we tried was the death by chocolate , which was good too. Had a lot of chocolate chips , brownie bits and chocolate ice cream. We even played fooseball. It's a good place to chill and definitely one for trying out great ice creams

Located in one of the posh locations of Ballygunge, this is the only ice cream outlet located near my place of stay. After tasting various flavors settled for the alphonso mango and 60% dark lucinet chocolate.

Both the ice creams were pretty good, but is way too expensive for two small scoops. The sundaes may be a good option for the price charged.

This outlet of Mama Mia is located in Ballygunge Circular Road ¬†and coming from St. Lawrence High School gate you find it in the left hand side. Though it wasn't very easy for me to locate the place I suggest you to opt for GPS.¬†

This is the only Mamma Mia outlet I've been to and being a dessert lover I couldn't miss this place. I more or less liked the interior and ¬†best part is you get a hell lot of variety. Yes, the pricing is a bit inclined here but that's alright if you want to be here. They allow you to taste before you order a scoop. I don't have all the pictures to support the review still I suggest to take a chance and visit the place as experience wouldn't be bad out here.

This is the first Mama Mia outlet that I had tried and it was absolutely amazing! I went with ones of my school friend and it was a really great outing and experience as a whole. We stayed there for atleast 2 hours even though all we had were 4 items.
We started with two scoops of Philadelphia Cheesecake ice cream and it was heavenly! One of the best if not the best ice cream I have tasted!
Then we had a Death by Chocolate which was also really nice. It was a bit common in terms of flavour as it was basically a brownie with ice cream and some toppings. I think it seemed lack lustre simply because the ice cream we had already had was not just really tasty but also quite different from anything I have had before. So yes, the sundae was a tad disappointing, not in terms of flavour but just due to higher expectations!
Then I was thirsty so we had a Coke Float. Its was really nice and had lots of nice levels of sweetness.
Finally, we tried the bombe fries which were basically normal fries customised as per your choice with two sauces. The garlic mayo we chose was very tasty and the habanero sauce was also nice.
The real star of the experience was the Foosball table. The One I remember in friends! It was the first time I had tried playing it and it was a lot of fun!
The staff is also courteous and well the place is definitely worth a try. You are bound to get your money's worth!

Where is it?

‚Ä¢ Go straight from St.Lawrence High School main Gate and this World of Happiness is to the left.

Why Should You Visit this Place?

‚Ä¢ Sweet Tooth Cravers will agree to me. This place is Heaven if u wanna gorge into some amazing desserts. And Yes, FOOSBALL keeps me bringing back to this place. Lovely pink brick walls and superb Decor.


What did I love?

I had ordered Nutty Butterscotch, Sizzling Brownie.
‚Ä¢‚Ä¢Nutty Butterscotch: This sundae deserves a 6/5 . Yummy butterscotch Ice cream with Caramel and Nuts. Ah! What Joy. Yummylicious is the word. This is Definitely a #MustTry

‚Ä¢Sizzling Brownie: The brownie was not Sizzling and the staff informed this while taking the order. No Grievances. It was Nice. Hot brownie with loads of chocolate Sauce and Chocolate Chips topped with Vanilla Ice-Cream.

Thumbs up:

‚àö Ambience
‚àö Pricing
‚àö Foosball
‚àö Board Games

Thumbs Down:

√óPastries.

I didn't like the pastries here. They were hard and could not match up to the bar set by Ice creams and other dessers here. Please Note Team Mama Mia! Else,All Very Good‚ò∫

The geletos are amazing but what I like best are the frozen deserts... The soda combos are also good. Some variants like the black forest and Columbiana may not be that nice...
The decor is very good.... Though the experience comes at a cost.

Their ice creams are just too good. They have maintained their quality. I went back there after a long time and found that the decor had changed. I liked the new look. Had twilight cookies sundae and loved it. We also had single scoop of Sicilian lemon and oooh.....it was light,fresh,lemony!! Refreshing.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Visited Mama Mia again after a gap but was not disappointed at all. The place continues to serve amazing ice cream. This time we went for the more traditional tutti frutti and it was good, packed with fruits and mix if ice cream. Yum. Also tried their thick shakes...slurpy Brownie and well this too was Yum. The red velvet ice cream cake was a novelty( though slightly hard). But I didn't like their chocolate tart as I felt it was too dense. Their special Fries served with two dips was good. But maybe they should think of introducing grilled sandwiches, so that people get savoury and sweet in the same place.

Went there for desserts tonight...and went straight to heaven and back!!! I have not been there in a while, so I got to check out the newfangled menu for the first time. I chose a German black forest sundae and my friend chose a butterscotch one. Both were amazing! There are some new and interesting items like thick shakes and a chocolate fondue. Also, they are now offering fries with your choice of cut, seasoning, dip and extras, which I definitely mean to try next time. You know, just a good hour dedicated to yummy fries and delicious gelato. Mmmm...

This is a place where you can great ice creams and amazing gelato. After seeing some good reviews I decide to go there and taste some amazing gelato. This place is nice staffs are also good. We ordered mango cheese cake, chocoholic, and a gelato thickshake(muddy cookies). All the items was amazing and mouth watering. But for cakes there are limited options to choose from only three cakes are available there and the other cakes was out of stocks. But apart from that it's a amazing place to go.

I went there twice during the hot month of May. The first time I went there with a friend, we noticed mango season was on and ordered mango sundae. It was out of the world. Being a chocolate lover, I then ordered a scoop of Belgian chocolate gelato but I suppose since we had the sundae already, it tasted somehow bland. The next time I went alone, beaten by the hot sun rays.unfortunately  they were not serving since there was construction going on and so no gelato. Disappointed, I turned back, but seeing my wretched condition, the staff kindly asked me to stay and enjoy the coolness of AC for sometime. Then I noticed mango mousse. I wanted to take it home but understandably, they desisted me from doing so as it would have melted by the time I went home. So I had one there which they served. It was soft, creamy and smooth and I was no longer feeling disappointed at all. Wish to visit it again.

Its one of my all time favourite ice cream hangouts. Cookie Crumble, Nutty Muddy and other seasonal flavours like mango are some of my top picks.
The bonus is they are atleast 95% fat free so no guilty pangs after eating! üòù

The staff give you a feeling of having done a favour to you through their service. They have the most disinterested look on their face and are extremely rude. Prices are on the higher side and there has been no innovation over the years. The management, which changed a few months back, clearly is not doing anything to keep up the image of the brand. Would avoid this place in the future.

Located in the posh area of Ballygunge Circular Road, very near to the famous St.Lawrence school is Mama Mia! 
Sometimes I really wonder, with this kind of location this place could have reached heights but unfortunately it hasn't and seem too lazy to actually do something about it.
Personally I am not a huge gelato fan, and especially for the price I don't think it's worth it. Of course some of their ice cream flavours and cakes are really good but otherwise I don't find anything special about this place. 
They are situated in a prime area, still the seating area looks too tired, it's an ice cream parlour and they also have some baked items but something is amiss. 
Especially the staff, they always give you a supremely bored & disinterested look every time you walk inside the place as if they are working because they have to, no hospitality nothing. 
For two cones with two scoops ice cream each they charge a whopping Rs.327 which I feel is a bit too much.
I do visit here from time to time especially when I am in a mood for some ice cream but honestly I would any day prefer some other brand over this one.

--------- Latest Visit on 10th May 2015 ---------
We thought of celebrating my Birthday with a cake. In this summer, ¬†ice-cream cake of Mama Mia was the best option we could think of! So, been there yesterday evening. Incidentally, we could not get any whole ice-cream cake. All the cakes were incomplete with one or two slices taken out from it. We selected the one with largest size i.e. the one for which 7 out of 8 slices present. The whole cake priced Rs 600. But we were asked to pay for 7 pieces each at Rs 80! I did not understand the logic behind. Someone else took a slice out at Rs 80 but why should I pay at the higher rate when I am ready to take the whole cake? It not me who is responsible for the non-availability of the whole cake! Neither I asked for less than 8 pieces initially! I requested them to charge me for 7 pieces at a rate that makes the whole Rs 600 when I saw there was no whole cake. But they said, they system did not allow! Then I tried to adjust by proposing taking a whole at Rs 600 with the one piece compensated with another Rs 80 piece from any other cake. That also was not allowed. Ultimately, I ended up taking 8 pieces of cakes 2 taken from each of the 4 types of cakes available there. I understood the system limitation but would like to raise it. Due to non-availability, slice rate should not be charged to someone who wanted to take a whole cake. There should be some gentle mitigation for this scenario. The rest experience is as magical as I expected. That same dreamy taste made my birthday evening. My rating remains unchanged.
------------------A super fine dessert parlor. I visited this outlet once only but it was a memorable experience to have what they served. I was looking for a combination of ice cream with pastry. I had the knowledge that it is the place when I can get it. Once I talked to the staff and when he took me through all the options they had, I was just confused about what to order. After a lot of brainstorming, I selected one and the taste of it took me in a dreamland. An extremely innovative and intelligent combination of vanilla ice cream, chocolate cake and chocolate cream prepared with extra ordinary care and expertise. I felt literally sad when it got finished. Unfortunately, I did not get a chance to visit there again but always looking for an appropriate opportunity and time.

Not entirely sure how "fat free"  they really are, but I love having a scoop of Gelato at Mama Mia! after dinner. I'm not too much of a chocolate person and love their non chocolate offerings. Among my favorites are Sicily lemon and Philadelphia cheesecake. After 8 is another one I end up eating when I want something with chocolate but not too chocolaty.

Me and my friends almost always visit this place. Its never too crowded so you can chill and enjoy a variety of ice cream flavours and ice cream cakes. My favourite is the Belgium dark chocolate and the hazelnut Brownie also the ice cream cake called hoopla cake !
This place is cute and cozy and probably one of the finest ice cream parlour situated in this area. :)

A nice little place to unwind after a long day! I went there after a particularly long day and found it soothing enough. It's interior decor could be a bit better but no major complaints. Personally, I'm a fan of gelato and liked the taste here. Would recommend the Belgian Dark Chocolate and Strawberry Cheesecake flavours.

Mama mia indeed! Have some friends with you? In the mood for some ice cream? Then this a place you must try!
There is nothing much to comment on the ambience, cause you're just too busy with your ice cream. So let's get to it.

We had chocolate diablo , It wasn't as dark as I expected. It lacked the diablo effect (devil in Spanish) however take nothing away from it's taste, for it is just too good!
We also had the KitKat sundae which was the bullseye for me! Pure chocolate! Pure taste. I have nothing else to comment on that either. Just beautiful. Another one we tried was the butterscotch sundae, which was quite tasty ( personally I hate butterscotch, but this one to my amusement was quite delightful)
Over all nice place. Here are the quick ratings.

Ambience : 2.8/5
Service : 3/5
Value for money : 3/5
Food : 3.7/5

Enjoy! :)

I went with my cousins and we were 11 of us so we ordered almost every sundays which were there in the menu and also the sorts, both of them very very good and of course yummy.. And the other flavours apart from these were also good no doubt.. So basically a thumps up shown to this place from my side..!  :)

A cozy place which holds few of my lovely memories!

This place would serve you ICE CREAM which you can sit and have for as long as you want. YES! They would never NEVER tell you a word even if you spend hours chitchatting over an ice cream scoop! However, I very strongly feel they need to improve upon their price listing. As in, no proper price notation is provided. I have never seen a menu card or price listings.¬†

What happens is, you randomly order ice cream and pay for what they ask after you are done. Weird! But the service is sweet. Even the peppermint flavour wont disappoint you. All the chocolate flavours are my favorite though. There is a special brownie mixed ice cream (dont exactly remember the name) which is dark and super yum. The sofas and seats are also pretty comfortable! Visit this place for a complete lazy time with ice cream and long chats :)

I had heard a lot about this place, expected something exceptional.
The place is little dull. decor is old and not maintained.
Options of ice creams were less. I tried few fruit flavors but they were not upto the mark. Belgian dark chocolate, chocolate&mint and black forest seemed to last options left. after eight was good and belgian dark chocolate.

Hope they work on the flavors and sitting area.

though being lactose intolerant... i have to keep coming back to this place with others as they love the gelatos in this place... the fun thing about the ballygunge one is that it is absolutely clean and kept nice and cold... which is something that i love... well the only thing i can eat here totally and like a hog in the Sicily lemon and thats something they make to perfection... my family and friends have tried a lot of things here... like the hot chocolate fudge and the kit kat sundae or the apple crumble... i keep taking a bite cause thats all i am allowed... they are all fantastic and they are made with no misery on the ingredients... i don't mind places charging too much as long as they give something of substance and keep the customers happy... thats the main thing... and this place lives up to that.... from trying to serving the guy does it with a smile whenever i have gone there... the only problem with the place is that they never seem to have any change for whatever amount the bill is for... which is strange to me....

for my father who is a diabetic, he loves this place as this place always has one variant which is sugar free and he can enjoy himself with that as well... really sad that they removed the fuzzball table which was fun to play...

This outlet of mama mia is located close to cosmo club.I visited it yesterday after dinner at ammini with family.It was very crowded though the servers were very calm.We managed to get a table.
FROM THE FREEZER: Our order was a scoop each of forest berries,banoofee pie(in waffle),nutty muddy(in waffle),triple chocolate,mango incante and strawberry cheesecake icecream.I tasted everything and all were good.Im partial towards nutty muddy and strawberry cheesecake flavours.
FROM THE BAKERY :We also ordered a blueberry cheescake and a chocolate praline mousse,while the latter was tasty i didnt like the blueberry cheescake,it dosent taste like one!
Our bill was 640
Overall a good good experience.
I managed a few clicks(resisting temptation! ;) )

ÔÅä  It surely fills up the void of good icecream parlours in the city , with its comfortable sittings and lipsmacking options. Personal favourites are Belgian dark chocolate,Salty caramel and Coconut icecream(seasonal) .A highly recommended place for those who crave for that sweet rush oce in a while ÔÅä

I love Mama Mia. I live a stone's throw away from the place, in the literal sense, and that allows me to frequent this place. Their service is pretty giod according to me and the servers always offer the customers to taste an ice cream before finalising. The seating is really confirtable too unless its completely packed. I have almost tried all the gelatos and some of the gelato cakes. Also I love their sundaes, not all but most. If you like sorbets then you can try Sicily Lemon & Blueberry, but the best of them are the Litchi and Mango, which are unfortunately as seasonal as the fruits themselves. The Watemelon is not too bad either.
The yogurt based are also pretty good especially Forest Berries. If you are more of a chocolate person then you are bound to be spoiled for choice. Do try the Fudge Brownie and Belgian Dark Chocolate. Personally I am not a big fan of the Kit Kat and Ferrero Rocher.
After Eight (mint chocolate flavoured) takes the crown as my personal favourite.

This outlet of mama mia is located close to cosmo club.I visited it yesterday after dinner at ammini with family.It was very crowded though the servers were very calm.We managed to get a table.
FROM THE FREEZER: Our order was a scoop each of forest berries,banoofee pie(in waffle),nutty muddy(in waffle),triple chocolate,mango incante and strawberry cheesecake icecream.I tasted everything and all were good.Im partial towards nutty muddy and strawberry cheesecake flavours.
FROM THE BAKERY :We also ordered a blueberry cheescake and a chocolate praline mousse,while the latter was tasty i didnt like the blueberry cheescake,it dosent taste like one!
Our bill was 640
Overall a good good experience.
I managed a few clicks(resisting temptation! ;) )

This place holds a special place in my heart as they baked sheer beauty and happiness on my first anniversary ! ! ÔÅä  It surely fills up the void of good icecream parlours in the city , with its comfortable sittings and lipsmacking options. Personal favourites are Belgian dark chocolate,Salty caramel and Coconut icecream(seasonal) .A highly recommended place for those who crave for that sweet rush oce in a while ÔÅä

I love Mama Mia. I live a stone's throw away from the place, in the literal sense, and that allows me to frequent this place. Their service is pretty giod according to me and the servers always offer the customers to taste an ice cream before finalising. The seating is really confirtable too unless its completely packed. I have almost tried all the gelatos and some of the gelato cakes. Also I love their sundaes, not all but most. If you like sorbets then you can try Sicily Lemon & Blueberry, but the best of them are the Litchi and Mango, which are unfortunately as seasonal as the fruits themselves. The Watemelon is not too bad either.
The yogurt based are also pretty good especially Forest Berries. If you are more of a chocolate person then you are bound to be spoiled for choice. Do try the Fudge Brownie and Belgian Dark Chocolate. Personally I am not a big fan of the Kit Kat and Ferrero Rocher.
After Eight (mint chocolate flavoured) takes the crown as my personal favourite.

finally kolkata has a nice ice cream parlor .. there is small arrangement of seating..  We get to choose from a variety of options from the different flavors.. the ambiance is pretty nice and comfortable..
coming to the ice creams  i prefer the sizzling brownie or ferrorer rocher or black forest sundae generally.. the seasonal fruit flavors are also pretty good.. 
my suggestion would be to include more options or varieties in the ice cream sundaes section...

This place is a treat for ice cream lovers. The extra rating to this place is because -
A) It is the bestt ice cream adda for manyy because of its location.
B) All the varieties of the brand are available here,as this is the main branch in the city.

The ice cream,mud pies,the ice cream cakes,the desserts,the frozen yoghurt,all are superb.
The fooseball table just adds to the fun ! 
Personal favs - Belgian Dark Chocolate and Irish Coffee ! :D

Mama Mia is owned by Natasha Agarwal who also happens to own the Rollick brand that was started by her father and also known for her mexican cooking classes. This is one of the foremost outlets of the brand whose success lead the way to quite a few outlets in the city.

I have always felt that the city lacks ice cream parlours and the ones that open tend to get overrated. Nevertheless, this is one of the few premium gelato outlets with quite a variety of sundaes and gelatos on offer. But my fondest memory of this place is that huge foosball table that used to be a craze for our college gang. Loosing a few calories over the game and adding a lot more via a ferrero rocher sundae used to be part of the schedule day in and day out.

Located near the calcutta comsopolitan club, this is one of the biggest mama mia outlets with comfortbale and spacious seating arrangement. The outlet is neat, clean and well-lit and seems very inviting !! The staff have started giving a bit of uninterested kind of feel lately which is bad. The service is fast though. The decor and ambience is good enough.

Now coming to the best part of a review which is the food itself and the place never disappoints. The gelatos are good especially the belgian dark chocolate, forest berries, french vanilla. Few sundaes are very good too with my favorites being ferrero rocher sundae or an apple crumble. Italian fruit burst or a tutty fruity sundaes are average though. They also have ice cream cakes which are good but not so overwhelming and i have had better ones elsewhere.

The place has been one of my favorite ones for quite a while but it could not keep up that charm over time. My humble suggestion would be to reinvent a few sundaes and improve upon the staff hospitality.

Mama Mia! serves a good range of gelato ice-creams in various flavours and combinations. Their most elaborate options are their sundaes. The Ferrero Rocher Sundae, for example, is very good. However, their uniqueness lies in the various fruit-based flavours that they stock. These are light and quite delicious. These are generally more reasonable than the sundaes.

The ambience is rather good. At one point, they had a foozball table that attracted a lot of people; sadly, that is closed these days. The staff are quick to serve you and the ice-cream is rarely over-frozen - a problem that happens in other shops where ice-cream melts and is then quickly refrozen, leading to ice crystals forming inside it. Overall, a nice place to go to for an ice-cream, though it is not on a road accessible easily by public transport.

Mama Mia! Here I go again!

No, all musical references apart, I do keep going again and again to this absolute heaven for those who have a humongous sweet tooth. I don't think I'll rest till I have tried out all that is on offer- and even then I might start all over again.

I really cannot stress how exactly perfect it is. The first sundae I had was the Kit Kat Sundae. I still remember the burst of chocolatey taste- I suppose my intense love for chocolate combined with the creamy texture of the gelato and the sinful dollop of smooth, whipped cream germinated my obsession with Mama Mia! The same raving review goes for all the chocolate-based sundaes. 

As for the gelato served in nutty waffles, I like to deviate from chocolate once in a blue moon (or once in two blue moons would be more appropriate I suppose) to try out the seasonal flavours. I really liked the Alphonso gelato which had chunks of the actual mango embedded in it.

The only reason I had to deduct a point from the perfect 5 is that it requires you to walk a long distance from Ballygunge Phari. But then, maybe it is perfect because of the immediate guzzling of an insane amount of calories.

P.S: Gelato contains less calories than the same amount of ice-cream, so despite its creamier and richer taste, it's actually healthier to eat a scoop of gelato. Or so I tell myself.

Mama Mia at Ballygaunge Circular Road used to be my happy place. My birthdays are associated with memories of icecream cakes from here. But on my recent visit there I was a little dissapointed. 
Previously the staff here would always be very enthusiastic. They would offer suggestions and also implore you to try all the gelato flavours before you could make up your mind and settle down on one or maybe two. They treated you well and made you feel special which was an added charm to the place. This time they were much less enthusiastic and seemed a little irritated because my 6 year old niece was taking time to make up her mind.
My favourite here used to be the Tangerine Icecream Soda Fizz so I ordered that, but they did not have it. We ordered the Apple Crumble and they did not have that. 
I finally ordered the Chocolate Overload, my sister ordered the Cheesecake and my niece got her own sundae. I must say that whatever we ordered was sinfully yummy as usual.And all my three points goes to the food.

I have never been a great fan of the gelato. Most of them lack taste. Mama Mia is not much better. Though a couple of their offerings are not too bad. Their frozen desserts are often fairly good, but I have been served one on a very soggy cake base, a total put off.

On my visit last evening. I was disappointed to see no cheesecakes available. I tried the caramel brownie, thinking it could be interesting but was sorely disappointed. It tasted like plain vanilla. Not for me! My fried suggested the Belgian Chocolate and I opted for that. At least it had flavour if nothing else.

My favourite here is the orange cheesecake. They do make it well, and cheesecakes being a favourite, I find it hard to resist.

The place has become shabby. There was water dripping from above at the steps to the entrance. The insides have seen better days. The staff are okay.... not terribly enthusiastic.

This place is awesome to hangout with friends but when it comes to ice-creams and desserts it does not impress me. The pricing is too high and the desserts offerred nothing worth it. I feel coming here often and having their average ice-creams at an unbelievably high price is nothing but getting fooled every time. The sundaes aren't anything unique or out of the world.
Yes the ambience is good and quite relaxing and you can play with your friends the various games setup there. The staff are quite well trained and know exactly how to make you pay and spent as high as possible. I feel the ccd next to it is way better. 
This one is located almost opposite St. Lawrence school. 
Overall the ice-creams and desserts are nothing to crave for and the high pricing is a barrier for you to try and experiment with this place. I rate it 3 for it's ambience and staff or else it deserves much less.

Mama Mia was a perfect example of what a Good place should not be.I would have rated this place VERY POOR but the category doesn't exist. Ordered a 1 pound cake (Rs 738/-!!!) and got something other than what was told to me at the time placing the order and shown in the photo. Ended up speaking to the GM, who was even a worst experience with rude and " Couldn't care less" attitude. She suggested that I didn't like the cake then I could leave it, as if birthday can be celebrated on any day!!!!Please take  a sincere advice and avoid the the plave if not for the cake then their behavior and attitude.
